        "Ridge is in Katie's office when she gets a phone call that Bill is here to see her. Ridge ducks out the other door. Bill comes right to the point. He says he has made a decision. He wants her back. He wants to love her again. He asks for her to give them a chance. Katie is skeptical. Ridge is back so naturally Bill would come running back to her. He begs her to give them a chance. He vows that he is committed to putting their family back together. She smiles and says part of her would love to have him back with her but she knows he's here because he is out of other options. The first one is off the table. She adds and she is not going to be a consolation prize for any man, not even the father of her child. Some day there will be a man who will love her completely and say beautiful words of love to her and mean them and she will love him back freely. But that man is not Bill. She says they have Will so they will always have a connection. She's sorry if he had another epiphany and wants to come home, but she is not home anymore. He turns and leaves. Quinn walks in on Liam and says she heard begging between him and Hope. She doesn't believe he has a relationship with Hope anymore. They immediately begin sparring and she tells him to stop meddling in Hope and Wyatt's relationship. His interference is over as of today. He scoffs that she doesn't know him very well if she thinks he is going to back away from Hope. He starts in on her bringing Steffy back from Paris and getting her to the cabin. Quinn says she merely did Hope a favor and in time she will realize that she was protecting her. Liam says he doesn't know if Wyatt knows about any of this, but Hope does and does not like it one bit. And the only people that Hope needs protection from is Quinn and her son. Quinn reminds him that Liam almost cost her her livelihood and all those people working for her. But Liam wouldn't care as all he cared about was his insecurities. He says he had a right as look how it all turned out. She walks closer and says he doesn't know how far she will go to protect her son .and he probably doesn't want to know. She says this is no threat, just a friendly warning but next time it might not be so friendly. Liam says that isn't going to stop him. He's going to find out just what kind of people she and her son are, as he bets they have a lot of secrets.",
        "Ridge is sketching in the office when Brooke walks in and declares his sketch stunning. She says she has some news. Bill is getting back together right now with Katie. Ridge is not sure he buys that. Brooke makes another pitch to Ridge. She knows she made a mistake but she still wants Ridge. She thinks they can work this out for both her and Katie. She'd like to know where they stand. He says he wants no more drama. She promises they can do that. He says okay but he needs more time. Outside in the hallway Pam and Charlie are exchanging some baked delights and joking about later they can play the Cowboy and the Sexy Stable Girl. He wants to be the Cowboy. Liam saunders by when they are discussing Charlie still being hounded about his part in the jewelry heist. Liam ducks behind the clothes rack and listens. Finally when Charlie keeps dropping the name Wyatt and him being the hero, Liam comes out and joins in the conversation. He says he'd sure like to hear more about this from Charlie's perspective. At Pam's urging, Charlie is only too willing to give every little detail. Quinn walks up just as Liam asks Charlie if that is really the truth \u0096 that Wyatt caught those jewel thieves. Ridge calls Katie and asks if congratulations are in order or did she turn Bill away. She said she did not take him back. He thinks she made the right choice. She deserves the best and Bill Spencer isn't it. They will get through this together. She likes the sound of that."

        "Katie: Uh, excuse me. Yes? Uh, he is? Um... Bill's here.",
        "Ridge: I'll leave.",
        "Katie: Yeah, uh, tell him I'm finishing up something, and then he can come in.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Bill: I've made a decision.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Bill: I want you back.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Bill: You, Will, our family. No lies, no games. I want to love you again, Katie. Give us a chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Couldn't help overhearing.",
        "Liam: Oh? So, you were spying on Hope and me?",
        "Quinn: Spying? No. I work here. The door was open, and I heard begging.",
        "Liam: Oh, great. Then you heard what you wanted to hear. 'Cause Hope and I were just discussing our relationship.",
        "Quinn: Why? You don't have one anymore.",
        "Liam: Hey, Quinn?",
        "Quinn: Hmm?",
        "Liam: Stay out of it.",
        "Quinn: No, Liam. You stay out of it. Stop interfering with Hope and Wyatt's relationship.",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Quinn: Okay, you know what? I'm tired of this. It's starting to wear on me. You're done interfering today. It's over. What is it gonna take for you to realize that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: I stocked the fridge with your favorite bottled water.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Pam: If you run out of it or if you need anything at all, you just buzz me. Between you and me, Donna is a little flighty.",
        "Ridge: Thank you, Pam.",
        "Pam: And I'll call that supplier and find out what the heck happened with those samples.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Pam: Okay. And, um, welcome back, Ridge.",
        "Brooke: What are you working on?",
        "Ridge: Logan.",
        "Brooke: Wow. That is stunning. I see some things never change. I know you're busy, but there's something I had to see you about. I have some news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: See, I'm not really sure why you think I would give up on the woman I love. Maybe you just don't get it. Maybe you've never experienced this 'cause you're too fixated on your adult son.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs]",
        "Liam: But if you think I'm just gonna walk away, Quinn, you must not know me very well.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] You have wronged Hope so many times. How much more are you expecting her to put up with?",
        "Liam: Oh, God, Quinn, come on. It's you. It's all you. You orchestrated the whole thing, bringing Steffy back, forging the note, getting Hope down to the cabin.",
        "Quinn: I did her a favor.",
        "Liam: No, you manipulated her and you betrayed her; and I don't know if Wyatt knows about all that -- maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. But he is your son. And this does not bode well for him, and Hope already knows what you've done, and she is not happy about it.",
        "Quinn: In time, she's going to realize that I was protecting her.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] Protecting her?",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] The only people that Hope needs protection from, Quinn, are you and your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I know you've been talking to Katie and how concerned you've been. But I was just speaking with Bill, and he wants her back.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: He's speaking with Katie right now.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] So, what is this? Another ploy?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Ridge: No? You're sure about that?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, it's true. He wants to be home. He wants his family back.",
        "Ridge: Well, I don't think I buy it, but either way, he doesn't deserve her.",
        "Brooke: Well, that's up to Katie.",
        "Ridge: She's a smart girl. I hope he doesn't hurt her again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: This all sounds vaguely familiar. Oh! That's because I've heard it all before. You came to me, and you said these exact same things, and then you conned me, and then you were gone before breakfast. I realize that I'm really gullible, but even I learn after a while.",
        "Bill: Obviously you're right. I did come with an agenda before, a selfish one.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: And I'm here with an agenda today -- to fix us, to put our family back together.",
        "Katie: What about Brooke? She's no longer the love of your life?",
        "Bill: I started a life with you, Katie. And that's the life I want to live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You don't seem like a very happy, very stable person, Quinn. And I think we're only just beginning to scratch the surface. We haven't even seen the worst of you yet.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Well, I'm sure you mean that as a compliment. Liam, this time, I encourage you to respect Hope's decision. You almost cost me and Wyatt our livelihood, all of our workers', but you didn't care, because it was all about your insecurities.",
        "Liam: Well, I guess I was right to be concerned, wasn't I, because look what happened.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] You got sloppy and complacent. And now Hope finally is with a man who respects and appreciates her.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you don't know a thing about me. And come to think of it, I don't know anything about you and Wyatt, either. But I bet you got a lot of secrets.",
        "Quinn: I will do anything to defend my son. And you don't want to know how far I'm willing to go to do it.",
        "Liam: Is this a threat? Is that what you're doing?",
        "Quinn: Mnh-mnh. No. No. Consider it a... a friendly warning. Next time, it may not be so friendly.",
        "Liam: You think I'm gonna let you do any more damage, Quinn? No, I'm gonna put a stop to it. And I'm gonna find out what kind of people you and your son really are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: She's incredible.",
        "Brooke: I'm glad you're such an advocate for Katie. She needs our support.",
        "Ridge: She's been through more than anyone I know, and she survived all of it.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, she is a fighter.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Oh, even when you guys were, uh, climbing the mountain, she was concerned about Bill. Sort of caring person she is.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. She can be really kind of difficult sometimes.",
        "Ridge: Yeah? Can't be easy growing up as your little sister. She's always been the most decent... [Sighs] Eh. Doesn't matter.",
        "Brooke: What? Of all the Logan women? Let's not talk about Bill and Katie. Bill's asking her to forgive him. You should be happy.",
        "Ridge: Do you think they'll get back together?",
        "Brooke: I hope so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Did you really think that it would be this easy?",
        "Bill: No. I've got a lot of work to do, a lot to prove.",
        "Katie: There is no you and me anymore, Bill.",
        "Bill: We can change that, Katie. The divorce isn't finalized yet.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] And what about Brooke? I'm just supposed to believe that your feelings for her have vanished overnight?",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: You know what? Don't bother answering that. I know what's going on here. You're beginning to realize that everything I said is true. Ridge is back, and now she doesn't want you anymore. She wants him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: You know I like it slow.",
        "Charlie: You are such a tease. You know, you will kill me eventually.",
        "Pam: At least, you'll die smiling.",
        "Charlie: [Laughs]",
        "Pam: Come on, Charlie. I want this to happen at the same time.",
        "Charlie: All right.",
        "Pam: Mmm!",
        "Charlie: Oh! Oh! Just plain wow. You know, Pamela, I think that is the most fun I've ever had.",
        "Pam: Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet, mister.",
        "Charlie: [Chuckles] Hey, listen, um, later, you want to play the cowboy and the sexy stable girl? I'll be the cowboy.",
        "Pam: And I'll be the sexy stable girl?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Pam: In four-inch stilettos.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, you know I'm a sucker for stilettos.",
        "Pam: [Laughs]",
        "Charlie: Not -- not when those guys wore the stilettos, but, uh... you know, to this day, the press will just not leave me alone.",
        "Pam: I know. That diamond heist. But it sure put Hope for the Future on the map.",
        "Charlie: Really?",
        "Pam: And I'm telling you, that Wyatt is some kind of PR genius.",
        "Charlie: And a hero.",
        "Pam: Tell me the story again.",
        "Charlie: No.",
        "Pam: Please, Charlie? Tell me about my big, bad Charlie stopping those big, bad cross-dressing diamond thieves.",
        "Charlie: Okay. One more time. There I was staring down the muzzle of a large- caliber handgun. And those guys had no reason not to pull that trigger.",
        "Pam: Except your scalding-hot coffee.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. You know, you know, it was actually mostly Wyatt.",
        "Pam: Now, Charlie, come on.",
        "Charlie: All right. You know, it was probably 80% Wyatt and probably 30% me.",
        "Pam: That's 110%.",
        "Charlie: Right. And that's what I gave that day -- 110%. But in all fairness, it was mostly Wyatt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Ridge is back, and here you are. I don't think it's a coincidence.",
        "Bill: I don't give a damn about Ridge. Whether he's here or whether he's in Paris is of no consequence to me.",
        "Katie: You really believe that?",
        "Bill: Katie... [Sighs] Can we make this about you and me and not a third party? I want to put us back together. Just give it a chance. Maybe I don't deserve it. I've made a lot of mistakes. I want to try and make up for those mistakes. I'm committed to you, I'm committed to Will, I'm committed to putting our family back together.",
        "Katie: There's a part of me that would love to take you back. I would love to have our life, our family back together. But I know you're here because you don't have any other options. Your first choice is off the table. And as much as I would love to give Will his parents back together again, I'm not gonna be a consolation prize for any man, not even the father of my child.",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Bill and Katie are reuniting right now, and we have to look at that in a positive way.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I'm not sure I can do that.",
        "Brooke: Why not? It's a good thing, especially for Will.",
        "Ridge: But you're talking about Bill Spencer. He treats Katie like a second- class citizen, and I'm not sure I buy it.",
        "Brooke: Only Katie knows what's best for her. And I hope she makes the right decision.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Your friend Bill is a power-hungry egomaniac. So what happens when he gets his company back, he gets his son back, he gets Katie back? What's his next target?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I don't know, but we can't think the worst. We have to believe that everything is gonna work out, and I have faith that it will. I made a mistake, and I was lost without you. I know that's no excuse, but I am getting my priorities straight. I want to be together again. I want our family back. Bill and Katie are doing that. They're trying to repair their relationship. I think we should do the same.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Yes, sirree. Wyatt was a big hero that day.",
        "Liam: Yeah, the missing diamond. That's a fascinating story. You know what? I'd actually love to hear, uh, all about it from your perspective, 'cause that's -- that's got to be exciting.",
        "Pam: Right.",
        "Charlie: Well, listen, Wyatt Fuller is the guy I'd want in my foxhole.",
        "Pam: Oh, can I be in your foxhole?",
        "Charlie: Have I ever denied you anything? Now, listen, Wyatt was amazing.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, I-I-I know. Big -- big hero.",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah, listen, he took that thermos right where I conveniently left it and flung that hot java right in their faces.",
        "Pam: And Charlie likes it hot. H-O-T, hot.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Not many people can handle that hot except for maybe Y-O-U. And the publicity.",
        "Pam: Forget about it!",
        "Charlie: Yeah, you can't buy that kind of promotion.",
        "Pam: No.",
        "Charlie: Well, you can, but it's really, really, really expensive.",
        "Pam: I'm telling you, that Wyatt Fuller -- I mean, a true gentleman, handsome, brave, criminal catcher, knows his way around the ladies. Hey, that reminds me of someone else I know.",
        "Charlie: Unbelievable.",
        "Liam: You know, I had the exact same thought. Charlie, you can be honest with me. Is that what really happened? Did Wyatt really catch those jewel thieves?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You know how I feel. So I just need to know where we stand.",
        "Ridge: Uh, I just don't want any more drama. Is that a possibility? Can we do that?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah. I promise. I will behave.",
        "Ridge: What am I gonna do with you?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Just, I need more time.",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "[Ridge kisses Brooke's cheek]",
        "Brooke: Get back to work. Too soon to be slacking off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I don't want to talk about Ridge and Brooke. I want to talk about us.",
        "Katie: You know, I have spent a lot of time beating myself up over what happened, for letting you back into my home, into my bed. I swore that I would never let anything like that ever happen again, that no matter what anyone said to me, I would treat their words with skepticism. I would protect myself. But I've realized that if I do that, Bill, if I become jaded and cynical... that I lose myself. 'Cause that's not who I am. That's not the kind of example I want to set for my son. Someday someone is going to say beautiful things to me, and I want to believe every single word. Someone is going to love me, Bill, and I want to be able to love him back as openly and freely as I ever would have. But that someone isn't you. We have a child, so we will always have a connection. [Sighs] And I'm sorry if you've had another epiphany and you want to come home. Because I'm not your home anymore. Now, I really have to get back to work.",

        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Is he still there?",
        "Katie: No. Bill just left.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] So, are congratulations in order, or did you take him back?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Ridge: Good for you. I think you made the right decision.",
        "Katie: Me, too.",
        "Ridge: Well, I think you deserve the best, and, uh... Spencer ain't it.",
        "Katie: Yeah, he's proven that.",
        "Ridge: Bit of an idiot.",
        "Katie: Thank you for coming by earlier.",
        "Ridge: Okay, well, we'll get through this together. I'm here.",
        "Katie: I like the sound of that. Thanks for calling.",
        "Ridge: Bye, Katie.",
