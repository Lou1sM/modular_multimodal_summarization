        "Hope: I used to worry so much, always second-guessing myself and making sure \r\nI was doing everything right and -- and making sure you were, too. There were \r\njust -- there were no surprises. It's like we forgot how to have fun. But I now \r\nknow that you can't take life too seriously. You have to enjoy it. But I wasn't. \r\nI was too busy living it the way I thought it should be lived. ",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Hope, you -- ",
        "Hope: No, Liam, it's -- it's true. It's true. But now I know that I can have \r\nmy values and say my message and live my life the way I want to without being \r\nsuch a drag. [Laughing] Honestly. Liam... I believed my brother over you. And I \r\nshould not have done that. It was a mistake. I want another chance. ",
        "",
        "Brooke: Sorry I'm late. I got stuck in a meeting. So, you haven't started?\r\n",
        "Rick: Not without you. ",
        "Brooke: No Taylor? ",
        "Eric: Can't make it. Emergency with a client. ",
        "Brooke: Should we postpone? ",
        "Thomas: No. I am ready for this to be decided. ",
        "Rick: My thoughts exactly. ",
        "Marcus: Hey, Dad. Is it okay if Dayzee stays? ",
        "Eric: Of course it is. I'll be curious to get her reaction. ",
        "Dayzee: Oh. Pressure's on. ",
        "[Laughter] ",
        "Thomas: Granddad's right. You're our target age group. It'd be good to see \r\nyour reactions. ",
        "Rick: We market to all age groups, Thomas. ",
        "Thomas: I'm aware. ",
        "Marcus: Well, it's too bad it's not an \"Intimates\" showing. I wanted Dayzee \r\nto pick out some pieces she might want to take home. ",
        "Dayzee: [Forced laugh] Pieces for me to take home? ",
        "Marcus: Yeah, for you, Babe. ",
        "Dayzee: For me? ",
        "Marcus: Yeah. All you. ",
        "Dayzee: You sure it has nothing to do with these models walking around in \r\nskimpy lingerie? ",
        "Marcus: Models? I don't even notice models in lingerie. I like Steffy's \r\nartistry. [Laughter] I do! ",
        "Brooke: Um, is Steffy coming? ",
        "Thorne: Well, uh, no. ",
        "Pamela: You haven't heard? ",
        "Brooke: What? ",
        "Donna: Uh...um... she's on her way to Paris... to visit her dad. ",
        "Brooke: Oh. Great. That's good. I'm glad that she's... he'll be happy to see \r\nher. ",
        "",
        "Hope: I never should have lost faith in you. But we can't change that or how \r\nwe've been cheated. But what happens next we control. We can make it right. ",
        "Liam: [Sighs] You make it sound easy. ",
        "Hope: If I believe in you and you believe in me... we can do anything. ",
        "",
        "Steffy: [Voice breaking] A baby. Liam. [Sighs] A baby. [Laughs] ",
        "",
        "Eric: It wasn't that long ago I had a pretty clear idea of what my future \r\nwas. I was all but retired and I had handed the reins to the business over to \r\nRidge. But things changed. And for whatever reasons, he doesn't want to be here \r\nanymore, and retirement without Stephanie seems -- seems kind of pointless. Big \r\nchanges for all of us here, in our family and at the business. And now it's time \r\nto move forward, and that's what this challenge is all about. I am back as \r\nC.E.O., and I want someone by my side, an heir to Forrester Creations. My \r\ngrandson. My son. You're both very talented, and you've worked very hard on this \r\npresentation, and I, uh, appreciate that. But now it's time to go forward. I'm \r\nonly gonna name one president today. Whoever wins will be running this company \r\nwith me. All right. Let's get started. Thomas? ",
        "Thomas: Well, first I want to thank all of you for being here today. \r\nGranddad, you and I would make the perfect team. You as C.E.O., the founder of \r\nthis company inspiring us all, with your grandson as president, a designer who \r\nnot only has creative ideas, but can also put them on paper. Look, I respect the \r\ncompany that you and Grandmother started, but it's a different world. We have \r\nto...build on that tradition while pushing the boundaries with form and \r\nfunction. I'm the only one who can do that for you, staying ahead of the trends, \r\nutilizing the constantly changing technology available to us. And my \r\npresentation will prove that. ",
        "[Pop music playing] ",
        "Hush, hush now don't say a word baby, just play, play, play me a simple chord \r\nto my heartbeat like it was yesterday I'm getting weak so please, please, please \r\nstay stay, stay, stay baby, please stay, stay, stay every time I look in your \r\neyes, I get butterflies I get butterflies oh, baby just strung out of time make \r\neverything better I just want to feel the music forever just strung out of time \r\nit'll bring us together strung out of time strung out of time strung out of time \r\nstrung out of time come, come back you will let it be baby, just fall, fall into \r\nmy gravity ",
        "[Applause] ",
        "Just take my hand and please let me have this dance dance, dance, dance I \r\njust want to dance, dance ",

        "Steffy: Okay. Okay, okay. [Sighs] \"So -- so, the thing is that I...I knew I \r\nwas late, Liam, and I\"... no. No. No. [Sighs] ",
        "",
        "Hope: Where do you think we'd be right now if your dad and my brother had \r\nnever lied to us? ",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Probably here, married. ",
        "Hope: I was gonna say in bed, but yeah, that works, too. [Chuckles] Look, \r\nLiam... ",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] ",
        "Hope: Let's make this right. We were manipulated and lied to over and over \r\nagain by your dad, my brother...Steffy. We owe it to ourselves to pick up our \r\nlives where we left off before any of them interfered. I know that you care \r\nabout Steffy and supposedly she's turned over a new leaf, but... that doesn't \r\nchange everything she's done. You deserve so much better. Steffy's on her way to \r\nParis right now, and... I'm glad she's gone. This is our time, Liam. ",
        "Liam: [Sighs] ",
        "",
        "Rick: Thomas talks about pushing boundaries, as if that's something new for \r\nForrester, as if we're some backwards company that's in the need of being \r\nrescued. Really? With our history? With our clientele? I think not. Do we need \r\nto move forward? Yes. Do we need to implement new technologies and be mindful of \r\n-- of trends? Absolutely critical. But doesn't Thomas understand that that's \r\nexactly what we've been doing since day one? What I want, and what Caroline and \r\nI have been working on with our designs, is to continue that delicate balance of \r\nwhat's new and what's timeless. Let's face it. We've raised the bar in this \r\nindustry since the conception of our company, and I will continue to do so. Now, \r\nCaroline is still recovering from her accident, and she's here in spirit, and \r\nshe would agree that we need to do more than just simply follow trends. We need \r\nto transcend them. And I'm confident that you all will agree that our designs \r\nwill do just that. ",

        "Hmm yeah, yeah I like waking up in the morning walk to the store with my PJs \r\nstill on I like standing on the edge of a rooftop and being scared that I just \r\nmight fall off call me nuts, but I think it's all good I'm just misunderstood \r\nand if we're all gonna go someday, then why live by the book?

        "Hope: [Laughs] Look, Liam, you're a nice guy, and I'm nice, too, and we never \r\nwant to hurt anybody. And where has that gotten us? Now that I know the truth, \r\nI'm not letting this go. I'm taking up this battle. ",
        "Liam: Oh? Oh, battle? It's a battle now? ",
        "Hope: Yeah, it is, for the life that we should have had, life we would have, \r\nthe life that we deserve. What has happened that can't really be undone? ",

        "Hope: I know. I know. You -- you have feelings for Steffy. I know you do. \r\nThat's nothing new. Okay, but to be honest, I really don't understand why, \r\nbecause after all the lies and manipulations from her, it... whatever. You care \r\nabout her. But... you are not married to her. There is nothing tying you to her. \r\nNow is the time. Is this hers? ",

        "Hope: We are doing this. Going back to who we were before Italy -- two people \r\nbeginning a life together. Your father totally screwed us, and Steffy suspected \r\nit and she said nothing to you. She claims to be loyal, but she's not. She only \r\ntells you the truth when it benefits her. And you deserve to be with somebody's \r\nwho's gonna tell you more than bits and pieces of the truth. ",
