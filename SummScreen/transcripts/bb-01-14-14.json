        "Wyatt is rocked. Bill picked him up at the airport and brought him to this fabulous beach house. Bill tells him that it is his. It's time to move out of the warehouse and break that leash around his neck from his mom. Wyatt loves the place and thinks it is a killer but he's a little concerned about the timing. Bill says absolutely there is an ulterior motive. He wants him away from his mother. He doesn't want Wyatt to be disrespectful but just keep a healthy distance. Wyatt says he will accept the house and he can't wait to tell Hope.",
        "Rick wants to hear all about Hope's trip to Hawaii with Wyatt. She says he was the friend that she needed. Rick can't get her to say more other than no they didn't go any further than friends but they are getting closer. He asks where does this leave Liam. She tells him that Liam holds Quinn responsible for the non wedding and really now so does she. She doesn't think Quinn is dangerous but she does think she has to be watched. And she is taking control of her life and moving on. She knows she will never be done with Liam and she knows Wyatt is committed to her and that's nice to see a man without another woman standing behind him. There's no drama with Wyatt. Things are so easy with him, no pressure to get married. Rick seems to be on Wyatt's side and tells her to go for it. Quinn is listening in to the conversation as Liam continues to pry information out of Charlie by calling him the true hero in the jewel heist. Charlie is called to the Boutique and Liam asks if he can tag along. There he goes through an enactment with Charlie of exactly what happened on that day of the heist. He determines at the end it was just Charlie and Wyatt in the shop just prior to the two thieves stepping out of the back and later was found with the diamond. Wyatt calls Hope and says his dad just brought him back to town. Wyatt has a surprise for Hope and he will fax her the address. She's impressed at his new digs. She mentions Hawaii and she can still smell the flowers, the half flowers. That is what she was, a half person until then. He gives her more flowers which has a note attached asking her to live here with him."

        "Wyatt: It's incredible.",
        "Bill: I used to live here with Katie. I just bought it back.",
        "Wyatt: So, are the two of you gonna live here, or is it you and Brooke?",
        "Bill: Neither one at the moment.",
        "Wyatt: So, you pick me up from the airport, and you brought me here. Why?",
        "Bill: It's yours.",
        "Wyatt: No. Come on.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I think it's time you got out of that warehouse.",
        "Wyatt: Well, yeah, but this -- I can't, no.",
        "Bill: I did the same thing for Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Certain perks to being a Spencer.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. This is killer, and I love it, but... you kind of got to wonder about the timing.",
        "Bill: What do you mean?",
        "Wyatt: My trip to Hawaii, time I spent with Hope -- does that have anything to do with this?",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So, tell me about Hawaii.",
        "Hope: It was -- it was great.",
        "Rick: Great?",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rick: Just great? That's it?",
        "Hope: Wh-- I mean, what do you want to know?",
        "Rick: I don't know. Maybe Wyatt, for starters.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] He...he was the friend that I needed.",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm. Anything beyond friendship?",
        "Hope: Nosy! You are a nosy, nosy brother!",
        "Rick: Just a protective big brother. That's all.",
        "Hope: [Laughs] No, no, it didn't go any further.",
        "Rick: But something is happening.",
        "Hope: Well, we're close, Rick.",
        "Rick: And getting closer? So, where do things stand with Liam?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You see, the way I heard it, Charlie, you were the hero.",
        "Charlie: Well, I certainly did my part, but, uh, Wyatt saved the day.",
        "Pam: Oh, no, don't be so modest. You and Wyatt worked as a team. Those jewel thieves didn't stand a chance.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] And Wyatt just happened to be there when the whole thing went down. How about that.",
        "Charlie: And a good thing, too. That -- that kid is quick on his feet.",
        "Liam: Indeed he is.",
        "Pam: Now, Liam, I know that Wyatt isn't one of your favorites, but you got to admit, I mean, he did save this company a lot of embarrassment. And he scored us a lot of publicity in the meantime.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah. A diamond heist will do that.",
        "Charlie: Oh, sure will. I mean, uh, Wyatt and I were talking about that.",
        "Liam: You were -- wh-- when?",
        "Charlie: Well, the day it happened. I mean, that morning. I mean, imagine that -- I'm telling Wyatt about all these famous diamond heists, when one happens to us that very night.",
        "Pam: Right?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Imagine that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So, have you talked to Liam since you've been back?",
        "Hope: Yeah, I-I told him that I was dating Wyatt.",
        "Rick: Oh. How'd he take it?",
        "Hope: I don't know. It was kind of hard to tell.",
        "Rick: He'll get over it.",
        "Hope: He blames Quinn. I kind of do, too.",
        "Rick: Mom told me about that.",
        "Hope: I know! Isn't that weird? I mean, she gets Steffy to come back to L.A., and then she sets it all up so I see her with Liam on our wedding day.",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm. You let her have it.",
        "Hope: I-I mean, I-I told her that I was starting to not trust her.",
        "Rick: What did she do? Did she try to squirm her way out of it?",
        "Hope: No, she -- she didn't. You know, Liam thinks she's dangerous, but I wouldn't -- I mean, I wouldn't go that far. But I do think that she has to be watched.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I mean, that is quite a coincidence, now. You guys are talking about these infamous jewel heists and -- and then one happens right under your noses.",
        "Charlie: Unsuccessfully, thanks to Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Yeah, what a big hero.",
        "Charlie: You have an issue with Wyatt.",
        "Liam: I have my reasons.",
        "Pam: Because of Hope?",
        "Liam: It's not just that. I mean, his mother Quinn is -- is --",
        "Charlie: Is a sweetheart.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] So it appears.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I'm fully aware of the situation between you, Liam, and Hope.",
        "Wyatt: And you're giving me a beach house so I can do some proper courting?",
        "Bill: I am giving you the beach house because it's what you deserve as my son.",
        "Wyatt: Well, thank you. Quite a change from the loft, that's for sure.",
        "Bill: Yeah, the sooner you move out of there, the better.",
        "Wyatt: I just have to break the news to Mom first.",
        "Bill: Well, while you're at it, how about you break that leash she has around your neck?",
        "Wyatt: Wow, okay, Dad --",
        "Bill: I want you on your own, Wyatt, away from your mother.",
        "Wyatt: So there is an ulterior motive here.",
        "Bill: Absolutely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Charlie: Uh-oh. There it goes again.",
        "Liam: What? What's that?",
        "Pam: He gets alerted every time there's a news story about the Hope for the Future diamond heist.",
        "Charlie: Oh, man! They spelled my name wrong!",
        "Pam: You can't believe how many people just love this story.",
        "Charlie: Uh-oh.",
        "Pam: What? What does it say?",
        "Charlie: It looks like those two nitwits they arrested insisted on a lie- detector test.",
        "Liam: What happened?",
        "Charlie: They passed.",
        "Pam: How is that even possible? I mean, you and Wyatt caught them red-handed.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, you know, those things aren't 100% accurate, and these guys are pros. You know, just another stunt for two incredibly guilty guys to avoid conviction! Don't get me started!",
        "Liam: So, I mean, for them both to pass a polygraph, that's... right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Employee: Ms. Fuller, they need you down in the fitting room.",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: You and Mom -- that ever gonna change?",
        "Bill: I'm not gonna bad-mouth your mother, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: You just don't want me around her.",
        "Bill: She raised an incredible son. How about we just leave it at that?",
        "Wyatt: No, let's not, though. What is your problem with her, anyway?",
        "Bill: All right, well, since you're pushing it, let's see, where do I start? How about not only does she not tell you you have a father or tell me that I have a son, she is getting way too involved in your life.",
        "Wyatt: She's a mother. That's what they do.",
        "Bill: She is orchestrating things without telling you. Sending the Steffy video to Hope, bringing Steffy here from Paris to ruin Liam's wedding.",
        "Wyatt: But isn't that sort of a page out of your book, though?",
        "Bill: Yes, it is. So I speak from experience, don't I? Except I learned from my mistakes.",
        "Wyatt: We all learn our lessons, and so will Mom.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I'm -- I'm not real confident about that, Wyatt. Look [Sighs] I know this is hard for you to hear, but she's not quite right, at least when it comes to you.",
        "Wyatt: I was her entire life for so long. But that's not the case anymore. She's got the Forrester contract. She's busy as hell. She's even taken an interest in Eric Forrester, which that ain't all about business.",
        "Bill: Right. So, are you saying she's in love?",
        "Wyatt: No, I mean, I wouldn't go that far.",
        "Bill: No, of course you wouldn't. If she has taken an interest in Eric, there is a reason, and it's got nothing to do with cupid.",
        "Wyatt: Talk about looking at the glass half empty.",
        "Bill: Wyatt, I can't solve your mother's problems, but I can sure as hell try and keep you from getting sucked into them. Now, I'm not telling you to be disrespectful with your mother. I'm just telling you to... keep a healthy distance.",
        "Wyatt: Like all the way out here in Malibu?",
        "Bill: Not a bad option.",
        "Wyatt: Well, mother discussion aside... not a bad option at all.",
        "Bill: So, you'll move in?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I can't wait to tell Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: [Clears throat]",
        "Rick: Sounds like you got a handle on things.",
        "Hope: I am taking control of my life.",
        "Rick: But you're still caught between two men.",
        "Hope: No. I'm moving on.",
        "Rick: You're done with Liam?",
        "Hope: I will never be done with Liam. He certainly isn't done with me.",
        "Rick: They're both two really good guys. But after another botched wedding, I'm starting to lose patience with Liam.",
        "Hope: I know. I know. But you have to remember that that was not exactly Liam's fault.",
        "Rick: Quinn's. Her handiwork. I know. But still, when you look at the baggage, it seems like Liam's got a lot more than Wyatt.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Wyatt is committed to me. And it's so nice to look at a man who loves me and not see another woman standing behind him.",
        "Rick: You may never get that with Liam.",
        "Hope: The thing is, though, Liam is so certain that we'll end up together.",
        "Rick: And you're not?",
        "Hope: Well...I don't want that drama. And with Wyatt, there isn't any.",
        "Rick: So enjoy it! You guys are great together! Not to mention everything he's done for the company.",
        "Hope: Yeah. I know. Ever since that crazy diamond heist, we've been on a roll. Oh, it's just things are so easy with Wyatt. There's no -- no pressure to get married, and there's no Steffy.",
        "Rick: So go for it. You deserve it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: [Sighs] You, uh, really don't like that woman, do you?",
        "Liam: Quinn? What's there to like?",
        "Pam: Oh, now, come on. I mean, she's done a lot for this company.",
        "Liam: I'm not saying she's not talented. I'm not.",
        "Pam: And I suppose we got to say she's a good mother. I mean, the way she looks after Wyatt like a mama lion. [Chuckles]",
        "Charlie: Boy, was she proud of him after the boutique caper.",
        "Liam: Was she, uh, present when the robbery occurred?",
        "Charlie: No, no. They were talking earlier, but, uh, she was gone by then.",
        "Liam: You -- you know a lot about these, uh, these infamous jewel heists, don't you?",
        "Charlie: Well, it's just a professional interest.",
        "Pam: Oh, come on. Charlie could write a book. You should have seen him at the boutique. He was holding court, telling one amazing heist story after another.",
        "Liam: And you said that -- that Wyatt took a special interest in it, too, right?",
        "Charlie: Well, he'd never heard those stories before. He was intrigued.",
        "Pam: Who wouldn't be? Million-dollar diamonds just -- poof -- suddenly disappearing?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Gets a lot of media coverage.",
        "Pam: Yeah. I mean, look what it did for us. Everybody wants a piece of Wyatt and Hope, the hero and the princess.",
        "Charlie: I am out of here. People need me.",
        "Pam: The boutique?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Pam: Don't forget -- tonight, my place. Albanian barbecue tonight.",
        "Charlie: I am so there.",
        "Liam: Hey, Charlie, do you mind if I tag along with you? I mean, I've got some more questions about Wyatt and the jewel-heist thing.",
        "Charlie: Suit yourself.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "[Paper tearing]",
        "Quinn: Sounds like you were getting an earful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Hey, um... thank you for this.",
        "Bill: You're welcome. Quite a change in lifestyle.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] Big time.",
        "Bill: You can do some quality entertaining here.",
        "Wyatt: Well, there's only one person I'm looking forward to entertaining.",
        "Bill: You've really fallen for Hope, haven't you?",
        "Wyatt: Hawaii was unreal, just to have Hope alone, and so unexpected.",
        "Bill: She must have been in quite a state.",
        "Wyatt: Upset, disillusioned, everything I didn't want for her.",
        "Bill: Well, you've been through a lot together. Your business success.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, there's all that, but...it feels like more. I bring something out in her, and I know that now. She laughs when we're together. She's not gonna find that with anyone else. I don't doubt that anymore.",
        "Bill: All right, well, just try and take it slow and easy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I don't think so. That's not the Spencer way, hmm?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Hope: Hi.",
        "Wyatt: Hi. Just got back. Dad picked me up.",
        "Hope: Oh, cool. Where are you?",
        "Wyatt: I have a surprise for you.",
        "Hope: Don't you always?",
        "Wyatt: Meet me, okay? I'll text you the address.",
        "Hope: Okay. I'm on my way.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Rick: Was that, uh, Wyatt or Liam?",
        "Hope: That was Wyatt.",
        "Rick: Go. Go be happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Oh, you know Liam. I mean, he's just a little out of sorts these days.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, Hope's the one that ought to be out of sorts.",
        "Pam: Well, I can't argue with that.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Still, I...I know I'm not one of his favorite people.",
        "Pam: Oh. You overheard?",
        "Quinn: Well, I was passing by. I couldn't help it.",
        "Pam: Well, you know, these kids, you just got to let them work it out.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they will. I just... I wish Liam and I got along better, that's all.",
        "Pam: You do?",
        "Quinn: He's a good boy. He's a little obsessed with Hope, but there's nothing we can do about that, can we?",
        "Pam: Well, you know, I just think it's better not to get involved with these young people and all their dramas.",
        "Quinn: Yes, no, I agree with you 100%. I just -- I just wish that -- that we could talk, you know, mend our fences. Do you happen to know if he's still in the building?",
        "Pam: Oh, no, he went to the boutique with Charlie.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Pam: Oh, excuse me. Forrester Creations. Um, no. He's not in the office, but I can take a message for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: [Sighs] Well, it isn't Big Blue, but it still needs a professional guard.",
        "Liam: That's nice.",
        "Charlie: You know, uh, every time I come in here, I can't help but think about it.",
        "Liam: What? The attempted robbery?",
        "Charlie: Should never have happened.",
        "Liam: Well, hey, it didn't happen, thanks to you and Wyatt.",
        "Charlie: Still, I...I could have been more alert.",
        "Liam: Charlie, do you want to tell me exactly how it all went down?",
        "Charlie: Good question. Okay. Okay. The diamond was there...",
        "Liam: Right.",
        "Charlie: And then the diamond wasn't there.",
        "Liam: Uh, but you saw the guys take it, the jewel thieves.",
        "Charlie: No. Didn't even see them in the store.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Charlie: I mean, they had to be lurking somewhere.",
        "Liam: Wait a minute. I'm not following you.",
        "Charlie: Okay, look, look, look, look, look. The store was closed. The customers were gone. The clerks were gone. I turned around, the diamond was gone.",
        "Liam: Okay, but, I mean, whoever took the diamond, I mean, they were obviously still hiding in the store somewhere.",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah, they had to be.",
        "Liam: But you didn't see them?",
        "Charlie: Well, not when the diamond was stolen, no.",
        "Liam: And who -- who else was in the boutique?",
        "Charlie: No one. I told you. We were closed.",
        "Liam: So, you were totally alone?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Well, no, I mean, you know, there was one another person.",
        "Liam: Okay, who was that person?",
        "Charlie: Wyatt. It was me and Wyatt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Hi.",
        "Wyatt: Hi.",
        "Hope: So, what's the surprise? And what are we doing here?",
        "Wyatt: Well... ah. It's a nice place, isn't it?",
        "Hope: Uh-huh.",
        "Wyatt: Dad, uh, picked me up from the airport, brought me here, handed me the keys.",
        "Hope: This is your new place?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Moving on up in the world, right?",
        "Hope: Um, I'll say!",
        "Wyatt: You like it?",
        "Hope: Yes! I love it! Look at you. Fresh off the plane from Hawaii at your new digs at the beach.",
        "Wyatt: Was something, wasn't it? Hawaii.",
        "Hope: Yeah, it was wonderful.",
        "Wyatt: Alone with my beautiful Hope.",
        "Hope: Hmm. God, I was a mess when I got on that plane.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I was a mess until you got on that plane, so thank you for that.",
        "Hope: [Laughs] We're even. It really was a great trip.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: The necklace, the surprise luau that we had, all the flowers, naupaka. See, I remembered.",
        "Wyatt: The half flower. Yeah.",
        "Hope: That was me. I felt like a half person until you took me to Hawaii. I feel like I can still smell the plumeria.",
        "Wyatt: Well, speaking of flowers...",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Hope: Oh-ho-ho! They're beautiful.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hope: Did your dad get these for you, too?",
        "Wyatt: Yes, Dad got me these. He likes flowers.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: No! Look. There's a card.",
        "Hope: Oh!",
        "Wyatt: And it says \"Hope.\"",
        "Hope: It sure does.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs]",
        "Hope: Let's see what it says. \"Today I move into my new home hopefully not...alone.\"",
        "Wyatt: Live with me."
