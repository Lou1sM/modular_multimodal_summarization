        "Searching for his baby girl along PCH, Thorne spies Ally seconds before Taylor's car is barreling down on her, but she puts the brakes on in time. He admits he knows he should have told her about the accident sooner, he was only trying to protect her. That was no excuse for her running away. She cries that she hates Taylor because she killed her mother. Taylor doesn't feel they can get married with Ally feeling that way about her. Thorne feels that in time she will come around. Bridget confesses to her dad that Shane stayed with her for a few days. She was able to keep an eye on him and Phoebe that way. She realizes Nick is a four letter word to Eric because he took away the company, but part of her loyalty is in his corner. She admits she still has deep feelings for him.",
        "Nick drops in on Taylor and finds Brooke and he admits that he will be there for Taylor if she needs him. She scolds him for taking a company he doesn't really have an interest in. He states that he is moving on and hands a stunned Brooke the divorce papers. She assumes there is someone else in his life \u0096 is it Taylor? Taylor returns and they have a free-for-all about Taylor's feelings for Thorne and why she really is marrying him. Brooke thinks it's none of Nick's business, and accuses them of having feelings for each other. In her opinion, this is not a normal patient-doctor relationship. She demands to know the truth."

        "[Breaks screech]",
        "Taylor: Oh, my God!",
        "Thorne: I got you.",
        "Taylor: Oh, dear God! Thorne -- what is she doing in the road?",
        "Thorne: It's okay.",
        "Taylor: Are you okay, baby? Ally?",
        "Thorne: Let's get her in the car, get her home. I got you, it's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: It's so nice to have Aunt Pammy here. I forgot to ask her, how long is she going to stay?",
        "Eric: I really don't know. And to be quite honest, having a house guest right now is --",
        "Bridget: I know what you mean. Well, Shane McGrath was staying with me.",
        "Eric: What? Bridget --",
        "Bridget: No, Dad, it's okay.",
        "Eric: It's not okay. Shane McGrath is --",
        "Bridget: I know. I know. I've heard it all. But he was sick, he needed my help. And I was there. Plus, I was able to keep an eye on things between Phoebe and him.",
        "Eric: Yeah, that doesn't make it all right. I mean, Ridge is going to be furious.",
        "Bridget: He'll never know. Shane already left and found his own place. You know, so, it was nice to have someone there when I came home. The last time I felt that way, was when I -- was with Nick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Nick? What are you doing here?",
        "Nick: Well, there was a situation with Thorne's daughter. She found out that Taylor hit Darla.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I know. Hope told Alexandria. That's why I'm here. So, how is Ally?",
        "Nick: Well, probably exactly how you'd think, given what she just found out.",
        "Brooke: Is she upstairs with Thorne?",
        "Nick: No, she went over to the beach house. She didn't want to be anywhere near Taylor.",
        "Brooke: And where is Taylor?",
        "Nick: Went to the beach house. She's just -- wanted to see if there is anything she could do.",
        "Brooke: And you're still here because -- you expect Taylor to come home and need a friendly shoulder?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandria: Can I go to my room?",
        "Thorne: After we talk, okay?",
        "Alexandria: Okay.",
        "Thorne: Sweetheart, look at me. Look at me. Listen, I know that you're angry with me, okay? And Taylor. And you have every right to be. But running away is not the answer. You know that now, right?",
        "Alexandria: You lied to me! Both of you!",
        "Thorne: Honey, we were going to tell you the truth when you were a little older, okay?",
        "Taylor: We made a mistake. You should have heard it from us.",
        "Alexandria: You killed my mommy! How can you marry her? I hate her! I hate you!",
        "Thorne: Sweetheart, hey. Listen to me, okay? Taylor thought that we should tell you, okay? But honey, I knew how terrible I felt when I found out. And I didn't want you to hurt like that. You are my precious, precious little angel. And I love you more than anything in this world. All I could think about was protecting you, okay? It's the only thing I could think about.",
        "Alexandria: I know you love me, Daddy. But how can you love her?",
        "Thorne: Honey, it was an accident. It was a horrible, terrible accident. It was foggy that night and mommy was helping Phoebe change the tire on her car. But sweetheart, something happened. And mommy slipped, and she fell back into the road.",
        "Taylor: I tried so hard to stop, sweetheart. But I couldn't. I couldn't -- not in time. I didn't want it to happen. I didn't want it to. You've got to know that, baby.",
        "Thorne: Sweetheart, it was hard at first for me, too. And I wanted to blame somebody because mommy was gone and I couldn't imagine life without her. But I came to realize that it really was an accident. And honey, Taylor would never hurt anyone, knowingly, especially your mother. I forgave her, okay? And I think you can forgive her, too.",
        "Alexandria: I want to go to bed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Bridget --",
        "Bridget: Dad, I'm sorry. I know that Nick is a four-letter word around here. I'm sorry.",
        "Eric: Oh, you don't think he should be?",
        "Bridget: No, I think you have every right to be as furious as you want to be. He took the company away from you -- twice.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, think? Dear, he has no interest in the fashion industry at all. He's just a sailor for God's sake. He just did this whole thing out of revenge.",
        "Bridget: But it's -- it's not that he's against you. It's Stephanie.",
        "Eric: And Ridge, for taking Brooke away from him.",
        "Bridget: I think when he forced the family to sell the company the first time, it was about mom, yeah. But this time, Dad, it's just about Jackie. It's only about Jackie.",
        "Eric: Is that what you really think? Or is that what you want to believe because you want to believe in Nick?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Are you implying something, Brooke? 'Cause if you are --",
        "Brooke: It was a simple question, Nick.",
        "Nick: Well, then the answer to your \"simple question\" -- yes. I thought I would hang around in case Taylor needed someone to talk to.",
        "Brooke: Because she's been there for you?",
        "Nick: That's right.",
        "Brooke: Look, I know she's helped you a lot, and I'm glad, especially after everything that happened at the fashion show. It was is inexcusable. And I would never defend Stephanie's actions. But what you're doing in retaliation -- look, Nick, I'm not saying that you're totally unjustified, but to put everything that you have into a company just to stick it to Stephanie, it doesn't make sense. You don't care about hemlines and haute couture.",
        "Nick: I do now. It's my company, not the Forrester's.",
        "Brooke: Well, maybe the Forresters don't want the company back. Maybe they've moved on.",
        "Nick: As well they should.",
        "Brooke: I guess we've all been forced to move on, haven't we?",
        "Nick: Do you really want to do this now?",
        "Brooke: Do you? I never meant to hurt you, Nick.",
        "Nick: We never meant to hurt each other. But it happened. We deal with it the best way we know how. And now we're moving on. I was going to call you later today and have this sent to you, but I guess we can deal with it now.",
        "Brooke: Divorce papers?",
        "Nick: I've signed them. All it needs is your signature. Our marriage is officially over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Listen, once Ally has had time to process things, she'll come around. She'll understand that it was an accident, and she'll forgive you, just like I did.",
        "Taylor: I want to believe that. I want to believe that for you, for Ally and for us. But it's like you said. I mean, it took a while for you to get past that. It took you a while to understand. It took you while to forgive me. And you're an adult. She's a little child. She sees me as the person that killed her mommy. I don't think that she's ever going to be able to forgive me.",
        "Thorne: Don't say that, okay? Don't even think that. Yes, it's going to take a little time, but --",
        "Taylor: But right now, all she needs is you. She just needs her father. You're the only one she has left. You're all she can depend on. If we -- if we try to get married -- how? How can we do that when she -- she feels this way about me?",
        "Thorne: Listen. Hey. I love you for putting her first and her happiness, okay? But Ally is resilient. She's very resilient. And she will come around. Hey, you and I Taylor, we're going to be man and wife.",
        "Nick: Your attorney's been calling, so I moved on it. This is what you want, isn't it?",
        "Brooke: I just feel so lost when it comes to you sometimes.",
        "Nick: Lost is a good word.",
        "Brooke: You can visit hope whenever you'd like.",
        "Nick: Thanks. It means a lot to me.",
        "Brooke: You mean a lot to her -- you always will. To me, too.",
        "Nick: Anyway, you really won't be free in the eyes of the law till the waiting period is over, so -- in a few short months, you'll be able to go about your business. Brooke, this is what you want, isn't it?",
        "[Brooke sighs]",
        "Brooke: What I want is for -- for us both to be happy. Me with Ridge, and you with -- Nick, I know you. I know how you think, I know how you feel. And you wouldn't have signed these divorce papers if there wasn't something else going on in your life. Now, there is something going on, isn't there? Or should I say someone? Is it Taylor? I mean, I was horrified, what Stephanie did to her, but I have to admire how Nick stood up for his mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Yeah, that's one of the things I've always loved about him. He really would go to mat for the people he loves. It's not like he wears his emotions on his sleeve, per se, but he definitely -- you know, if you need him, he will be there. What? What?",
        "Eric: So you still have feelings for him? It's all right, honey, you can admit it.",
        "Bridget: It's not like I need to admit anything really. So -- yeah, maybe I have a little bit of feelings left. Finding out what he went through as a child sheds a little bit more light on him, as well. I don't know, dad. If I'd known everything before, maybe things would have turned out really differently between Nick and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: What's going on?",
        "Nick: We were concerned about you and Ally.",
        "Brooke: Taylor, I'm sorry. Hope never meant to --",
        "Taylor: No, I -- I don't blame Hope. It's my own fault for not anticipating this.",
        "Nick: Anticipating what?",
        "Taylor: Ally ran out in the middle of the PCH and I almost hit her.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God! Is she all right?",
        "Taylor: Yes, thank God.",
        "Nick: What about you? Are you all right?",
        "Taylor: I stopped just in time. And then Thorne came and had to move her out of the middle of the road.",
        "Nick: Drink this.",
        "Brooke: Taylor, I know this is upsetting, but --",
        "Taylor: I killed her mother. No wonder she doesn't want me to marry her father!",
        "Brooke: Just give her a little more time. She just found out --",
        "Nick: You are not doing this little girl any good by pushing this. And marrying Thorne -- it's wrong. It's wrong for you, it's wrong for Ally. You're doing it out of guilt because you feel as though you owe this man something.",
        "Taylor: I don't feel like I owe Thorne anything.",
        "Brooke: For God's sake, Nick! Taylor is a grown woman and a therapist. She knows what's in her heart, in her mind. She's marrying Thorne because she's committed to him, not because she's feeling guilty.",
        "Nick: Well, I don't believe it. I think you're doing it for other reasons.",
        "Taylor: Please, Nick --",
        "Nick: If you'd be honest with yourself -- you know that I'm right about this.",
        "Brooke: It's none of your business, Nick. Unless -- unless you're doing this to try to bring more misery onto the Forrester's life.",
        "Nick: What?",
        "Taylor: That is really a stretch.",
        "Nick: You can't really believe that.",
        "Brooke: Well, I'm not saying this to hurt you, but you can't deny that you've been hell-bent on getting revenge against the Forresters.",
        "Nick: This has nothing to do with that!",
        "Brooke: Really? Well, then what does it have to do with? Because I can't see anything else possible. Maybe there's something going on between the two of you.",
        "Taylor: Oh, Brooke, that is ridiculous!",
        "Brooke: I wonder. I was here just a little while ago listening to you going on and on about what a wonderful man Nick is and how close you'd become in therapy. Taylor, Thorne loves you. He is committed to you. He's planning a life around you. And what about Ally and everything she's gone through? Are you gonna just break their hearts all over again? No, this is not a normal patient/therapist relationship.",
        "Nick: Brooke --",
        "Brooke: Have you fallen for her? Has she fallen for you? Has it already happened? I want the truth, damn it, and I want it now!"
