        "Steffy is heartbroken as she peers through the window at Hope and Liam kissing and rollicking on the bed in each other's arms. They are hot and heavy, but Liam pulls away and says they can not do this. This is not fair to Steffy. Meanwhile Steffy has seen enough and drives away. Eric tells the group that the last thing that he wants is this to be a rift in the family. This is a family business and they have to trust each other and work together as one. They've made their cases and now he needs to make his. He congratulates them individually for their stunning, innovative designs. He names Thomas as the new co-head designer but Rick as the President. He explains to Thomas that Rick's experience at International gives him the tools to do this and Eric's and Thomas's designs can lead them into the future. Thomas says he can not be happy with being co-head designer and walks out. All of them congratulate Rick and he tells Eric that he is looking forward to this as he knows he can't run Forrester alone.",
        "Thomas catches Taylor in Steffy's office as she is leaving her a note. She doesn't have to even ask how the morning went; she sees it on his face. Taylor spies the pregnancy box hanging half way out of Steffy's bag. She picks it up and looks at it skeptically. Steffy catches her and makes her promise to secrecy. She wants Taylor just to treat her like a patient now and say nothing, not even to Liam. The timing is wrong and she needs to give it more thought before revealing it. Caroline is there for Rick to help him celebrate being Mr. President. He tells her it will mean a lot of long hours behind the desk and he hopes she does not mind overtime. Liam tries to explain to Hope why they had to stop. She counters with that now that everyone knows the truth, there is no reason they can not get back together. She offers that neither of them are people who want to wreck people's lives, but it was outside forces that divided them. They were robbed and they need to make it right, the way it was supposed to be. He admits that he loves Hope and he feels cheated, but he will not do this to Steffy what was done to Hope. He needs time. Steffy is on the plane, alone and crying when the young man claims his seat next to hers. He asks if she is all right and she stammers yes, just leave her alone."

        "Steffy: A baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I saw a lot of passion here today. You should both be very, very proud of yourselves.",
        "Donna: Eric, stop being such a diplomat and tell us who won already?",
        "Pam: Come on, Eric. Who is the next president of Forrester Creations?",
        "Caroline: Did I miss it?",
        "Rick: Hey!",
        "Caroline: Hi.",
        "Rick: Oh, my God. How are you feeling?",
        "Caroline: Much better. Thank you. How'd it go?",
        "Rick: Great. You're just in time.",
        "Eric: Overall, both teams did very well. Everyone should be proud. Made this a difficult decision. The last thing I want is for this to cause a rift in our company. I want everyone to remember we're all on the same team here.",
        "Thomas: But only one of us will be president.",
        "Rick: One of us won't.",
        "Eric: And I'm still C.E.O. And it's my job to make certain that the transition goes smoothly. Remember, this is a family business. We have to trust each other. We have to depend on each other. That's critical to our future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You know I'm loyal to you. [Echoing] I'm loyal to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: You have both made your cases. Now it's time for me to make mine. I want you all to understand why I made this decision.",
        "Brooke: We trust your judgment, Eric.",
        "Eric: It was very exciting, actually, seeing everything that you brought to the table today. Good job, both of you. Thomas, you brought a whole new level of refinement to your work. I've never seen that before. Good job. And I've always been impressed with how you're willing to push the envelope here, work outside the box. Congratulations. Rick, you and Caroline presented a modern look that incorporated all of the things that Forrester is famous for. Beautiful fabrics, stunning silhouettes. Very well done. Innovation and classicism -- both things we need. I believe Thomas can bring those to us. I think that his forward thinking and his enthusiasm will drive this company into the future. As co-head designer, your creativity can fuel Forrester's renaissance. But Rick will be the one to lead us. Congratulations. You're the new president of Forrester Creations.",
        "Brooke: Oh, Rick! I'm so happy for you! That is great.",
        "Thomas: Rick.",
        "Eric: I'm sorry, Thomas. You want this company to grow and you want it to change. It's the president's job to convince the clientele and the stockholders that change is good for them. Rick's tenure at International gave him the tools to accomplish that.",
        "Thomas: How can you talk about change and put him in charge? He doesn't want to change anything! He wants to keep doing things the way we've been doing it.",
        "Eric: We've been doing it right for many, many years, Thomas. Your father and I... your father and I were one of the best design teams in the world for many, many years. Our collaboration established the brand that's Forrester now. Together, you and I can do that, too -- we can do even more than that.",
        "Thomas: I want to be flattered by that. I know I should be, but... before she died, my grandma gave her shares to me, so I shouldn't just be running Forrester Creations. I should own it. So don't expect me to be satisfied with some... co-head designer, 'cause I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Wait, wait, wait. No. No, wait. This is -- this is not right.",
        "Hope: Then why does it feel so good?",
        "Liam: I know. I -- I know it does, but... we can't do this.",
        "Hope: Oh, I don't want to hear that.",
        "Liam: I know. I know you don't.",
        "Hope: Liam, I am done telling myself that this is impossible or that we can't do it, because we can if we want to.",
        "Liam: Hope... not like this.",
        "Hope: We should be together. And we would be together.",
        "Liam: I know, but we're not. And this isn't fair to Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Love the one you're with.",

        "Marcus: President of our dad's company, huh? How does it feel?",
        "Rick: Humbling.",
        "Marcus: I bet. Congratulations, Rick.",
        "Rick: Thank you for the support.",
        "Marcus: You got it. Look, I got to go, so I'll check you guys later, all right?",
        "Thorne: Congratulations, little brother.",
        "Rick: Thanks, Thorne.",
        "Thorne: Listen, don't let what Thomas said get you down, okay? He'll come around.",
        "Rick: I hope so. I need him.",
        "Thorne: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Hell, I need all of you.",
        "Eric: Glad to hear it.",
        "Rick: I cannot run Forrester on my own.",
        "Donna: You can count on us, Rick. Good job.",
        "Thorne: See ya, Prez.",
        "Pam: Uh, there's just one thing I want to know. Which one of you do I come to about a raise?",
        "Both: Him.",
        "Rick: [Laughs]",
        "Pam: Congratulations, Rick.",
        "Rick: Thank you. Dad, I, uh... I don't know what to say.",

        "Taylor: Steffy?",
        "Thomas: You looking for my sister?",
        "Taylor: Oh. Hey, how did it go? Or do I even have to ask?",
        "Thomas: Not really. Granddad went with his son.",
        "Taylor: Rick?",
        "Thomas: That's whom he's chosen -- the new heir apparent.",
        "Taylor: Oh, honey, I... I am so sorry.",
        "Thomas: I ought to be used to it by now, Brooke's family always coming out on top.",
        "Taylor: I feel your frustration.",
        "Thomas: He loved my designs. He knew they were better.",
        "Taylor: I'm so sorry, honey.",
        "Thomas: I got to go.",
        "Taylor: Hang in there, okay?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You understand why we had to stop?",
        "Hope: I understand why you thought we had to stop.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] We just -- we just let things get out of control.",
        "Hope: We gave in to our feelings.",
        "Liam: I know, and we shouldn't have.",
        "Hope: We couldn't help it. But that happens when you suddenly know the truth -- everything makes sense and falls into place.",
        "Liam: It's not that simple.",
        "Hope: No, it wasn't that simple a few days ago. No, it wasn't. What was it you said? You said we tried. Too much has happened. Too much got in the way. But, Liam, none of that was real. None of it. It was not fate or bad luck. Our relationship was not doomed. It was your father and Rick. They lied and tricked us. And now that we know the truth, nothing can stand in our way.",

        "Steffy: [Gasps] Mom! What are you doing here?",

        "Taylor: Guess you forgot your purse.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I know. I got to go to the airport.",
        "Taylor: So why does your father want to see you?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. He didn't say.",
        "Taylor: Are you all right?",
        "Steffy: Of course, I am. Why wouldn't I be? Look, I'll call you when I get there, okay?",
        "Taylor: Don't you want to know how the fashion challenge went and who Eric picked? Or were you too worried about your pregnancy test? I saw it. It was hanging out of your purse, Steffy. Why? Are you pregnant?",
        "Steffy: Mom --",
        "Taylor: I want the truth.",
        "Steffy: You listen to me. You saw nothing, okay?",
        "Taylor: Why are you upset? What's going on?",
        "Steffy: A baby, Mom? The timing is all wrong.",
        "Taylor: Well, you don't always get to choose that.",
        "Steffy: No one can know.",
        "Taylor: Steffy, Liam has to know.",
        "Steffy: Promise me, Mom. No one can know.",
        "Taylor: What is the matter with you?",
        "Steffy: Can you just treat me like one of your patients? You tell no one, okay?",
        "Taylor: Steffy --",
        "Steffy: No, Mom, I have to catch my flight.",
        "Taylor: Look -- okay, fine! I'm not saying any-- oh, my gosh.",

        "Caroline: You did it. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: We did it.",
        "Caroline: You are president of Forrester Creations. You're running this whole company.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Side by side with my dad.",
        "Caroline: It's your legacy. Because you are Eric Forrester Jr.",
        "Rick: But I still have to prove myself.",
        "Caroline: And you did that today.",
        "Rick: Every day -- to my vendors and clientele and employees. It's not just about the next line or the next collection. I have to represent every aspect of this company.",
        "Caroline: It's a big responsibility.",
        "Rick: But I have the training, and I know this business.",
        "Caroline: You will be great.",
        "Rick: Yeah, but I'm gonna be busy. A lot of long hours behind the desk.",
        "Caroline: Mm. Well, it's a good thing I work here, too.",
        "Rick: I hope you don't mind overtime, Ms. Spencer.",
        "Caroline: Not at all, Mr. President. In fact, I'm looking forward to it.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Sighs] How did we get here?",
        "Hope: Mm.",
        "Liam: And what do we do?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Well, since I found out the truth -- all of it -- I've done some soul-searching. It is not in my nature to wreck other people's lives, and it's not in yours. You're a loving, compassionate, caring guy, and I love that about you. They're such wonderful qualities. But it also makes you vulnerable -- just like I've been -- a victim. For so long, I have wondered what went wrong, and now we know that it was outside forces. So, now that we know the truth, do you really want to say that we can't go back, that we don't deserve the chance we never got? I don't. And I don't think that you do, either. We were robbed, Liam. Let's make it right.",
        "Liam: Oh, man, my head is spinning.",
        "Hope: That is how it's supposed to be for us.",
        "Liam: Sure.",
        "Hope: This is our passion. I know you feel it. It's burning inside.",
        "Liam: Yes, of course I feel it. Yes, it's burning inside me, but, listen...",
        "Hope: Hmm.",
        "Liam: I love you. I always have. And we have been cheated. But I will not do the same damage to Steffy that was done to you. And if there is any future for us... I need time. I need to think about Steffy. And I need to show her the respect she deserves.",
        "Hope: I understand. But... don't let it slip away. We deserve this.",
        "Liam: I just don't want anybody to be hurt.",
