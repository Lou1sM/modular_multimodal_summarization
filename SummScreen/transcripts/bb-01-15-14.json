        "Hope is shocked that Wyatt wants her to move in with him in his new digs. He admits that it is too fast and they should wait, but why. They know how they feel about each other and they should just do it. She mentions that she was ready to take it slow. He says okay, she can just move in one shoebox at a time. He tells her to say yes, has he ever steered her wrong? He asks her what does his past have to do with this. She reminds him that he just asked her to move in with him so that is a valid question. She asks pointblank if he has ever lived with anyone before. He quips what - in his one tiny little loft room in the warehouse. He tells her that he knows why she is hesitant but his inexperience in the co-habitation department is a plus. He assures her that she is the only person that he's ever wanted to share his life with. He says this place is amazing and the only thing to make it better is living there with her. She says she will come visit him a lot and he says he will hold her to that. She hopes he is not upset with her. He says no, he knew it was a long shot but he's a spontaneous guy. Hope says that is what she likes about him. He's full of fun and adventure, the way he looks at the world and not afraid of taking chances. But they don't have to rush this. He says he will ask her again and she says she hopes he does. Wyatt says but then there is Liam. He keeps letting her down but pulling her back in. He's not going to let him do that anymore. Hope tells Wyatt that he is not her rebound guy, but if they move in too fast then it will look that way to others. He agrees. He says they have worked too hard for HFTF to have it undermined by their relationship. How people perceive her will affect the label. That's why the diamond was a perfect tie in for her line. He wants to make sure that she continues to have her message heard.",
        "Quinn asks Pam if Liam went to the Boutique with Charlie. She asks if he is writing an article about the jewel heist. Pam says Quinn is probably right and that is why Liam was asking so many questions. At the Boutique Liam is still asking questions of Charlie, even getting him to re-enact his exact movements before the heist. Then alone Charlie watches the footage from the surveillance tape. Liam goes back to Forrester and runs into Aly and she answers Liam's question about Quinn not being there at work. She wants to talk to him about the Boutique so he steers her into the Executive office so they can talk privately. Liam gloats to her that he thinks he got him. He thinks Wyatt is involved and now he's got him. He tells her that he's got Charlie looking at the Boutique tape now, but he found out he and Wyatt were alone in the store that day. According to Charlie it was there and then it wasn't. And the thieves passed their polygraph test today so it is suspect how the diamond got in their purse. Wyatt benefited the most by coming out as the hero. And he got Hope. Aly can't see how Wyatt could have been involved in just publicity as the thieves were real. Liam admits he hasn't figured out that part yet. Aly tells him that she is sorry for the wedding being cancelled but to try and tie Wyatt to this doesn't make sense. He keeps insisting the guy has no boundaries and Hope is not safe and she needs to know that. Until now it's all been Quinn but if he could just prove that Wyatt is just as involved. Aly says she knows Liam feels this way and maybe Quinn has done some questionable things but she does not feel either of them would hurt Hope. Charlie is about to give up on the tape when he spots one more frame, one that shows Wyatt taking the diamond off the display cone. He picks up the phone to call Liam when a voice behind him tells him to hang up the phone. He turns around to see Quinn glaring at him."

        "Hope: You're asking me to move in with you?",
        "Wyatt: Well, my dad gave it to me, and I want to share it with you.",
        "Hope: As a couple?",
        "Wyatt: Hope, if I was looking for just a roommate, I'd have skipped the flowers, okay?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: I-I know we should wait -- you know, it's too fast -- but why? What are we waiting for? We know how we feel about each other, so why not just... do it?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles nervously]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: So, Liam went to the boutique with Charlie?",
        "Pam: Yeah. Oh, if you need him, I-I can just call over for him.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no. That's okay. I was just curious. You know, I-I saw them talking. Is -- is Liam doing an interview? Is he doing an article about the heist?",
        "Pam: Oh. You know, I hadn't even thought about that, but I bet you're right. That's why he was asking all those questions about it. Oh, here -- you want me to sign that? There we go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You and Wyatt were alone in the store when the diamond went missing?",
        "Charlie: Well, we thought we were, but, uh, the thieves must have been hiding in the back somewhere.",
        "Liam: Well, could they have snuck out and taken it when you weren't looking?",
        "Charlie: Well, they must have. But I don't know how. I mean, the whole thing happened like that. Oh, sorry. Sorry. By the way, that's a lovely color on you. Yeah. So, okay, okay, okay. So, I was -- I was, um, -- I was about here, and Wyatt was about where you are. The diamond was on the stand, and I was, uh, -- I was shooing the last of the customers out the door. I locked the door. Click! I turned around... [Gasps] ...And the diamond was gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Yeah, Liam seemed really curious about the robbery.",
        "Pam: Yeah. He did want to know all the juicy details, didn't he? I bet you're right. I bet he is writing an article. I mean, why else would he want to know everything that Charlie remembered about the heist?",
        "Quinn: Well, he was there. He saw everything.",
        "Pam: Yeah. [Chuckling] Could you imagine -- my Charlie in \"Eye on Fashion?\"",
        "Quinn: Um, Pam, will you excuse me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Yes?",
        "Aly: There you are. You're needed in the showroom.",
        "Quinn: No, I was just on my way out.",
        "Aly: Well, there's a question about the pairing for the green dress.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Okay, but then I really have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I didn't make her mad, did I?",
        "Pam: Oh, no, sweetheart. I just think that there was somewhere else she needed to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I only took my eye off of that diamond for one second -- maybe 10 -- 30, max.",
        "Liam: Uh-huh. And -- and -- and where -- where did you say Wyatt was?",
        "Charlie: Well, he was at the counter, telling the clerks that they could go home.",
        "Liam: Okay, so, he wasn't standing next to you. You had your back to him.",
        "Charlie: Wait a minute. You don't think the -- look, look, look -- Wyatt stopped the robbery. He didn't have anything to do with it.",
        "Liam: Charlie, I'm -- I'm -- I'm just trying to get a timeline here. I mean, it might help to know what Wyatt was doing at the time the diamond went missing. Right?",
        "Charlie: All right, I'll have a look at the security footage.",
        "Liam: Security f-- wait. You're saying the police didn't take that?",
        "Charlie: Well, they didn't need it. One of the thieves was caught with the diamond in his very lovely designer handbag.",
        "Liam: Okay. Okay. No, this is good. This is -- can you -- would you look at those videotapes and call me if you find anything at all?",
        "Charlie: Okay, well, I'm just saying, though, that...",
        "Liam: What? Excuse me?",
        "Charlie: ...Well, the diamond -- I mean, big jewelry heists. You know, like I told Wyatt, somebody tries to steal the diamond, and everybody in the world wants to know about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Hope: Moving in together is a really big step. You know, I think that just because your dad got you this house...",
        "Wyatt: That's not why I'm asking. I mean, being on this trip, away from you, after Hawaii -- texting and -- and seeing you on the computer was not enough for me. Hawaii was so great -- just having you right next door. It could be just like that but just a little closer.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: Oh, and I told my brother we were taking this slow.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so you could just move in one shoebox at a time.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Look, I-I know it's crazy, but flying down to Mexico to get that diamond and then running off to Hawaii... say yes, Hope. When have I ever steered you wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: [Sighs] Okay, Liam wonders what you were doing, Wyatt, so where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Aly: Hey, are you sure Quinn wasn't annoyed?",
        "Pam: Oh, no. Uh, anyway, if she was, she wouldn't let you know it. You're Eric's granddaughter -- don't forget.",
        "Aly: She seems to be pretty nice to everybody...usually.",
        "Pam: Yeah. Well, she's not too fond of Donna, but, then, hey, neither am I.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Aly: I just hope I didn't throw off her entire schedule.",
        "Pam: Oh, you keep her schedule?",
        "Aly: Oh, just her meetings with Hope.",
        "Pam: Oh. Is she meeting with Hope today?",
        "Aly: No. Um, Hope left. She, uh, said she might be out for a while.",
        "Pam: Oh.",
        "Liam: Hey, Aly. Pamela.",
        "Aly: Hi.",
        "Pam: You're back.",
        "[Telephone buzzes]",
        "Pam: Oh, just a second. Um, Pamela Douglas.",
        "Liam: Hey, have you seen Hope?",
        "Aly: Oh, she's out.",
        "Liam: Really? I've been trying to get ahold of her. She's not responding to my texts.",
        "Pam: Um, I've got to run these down to marketing. But I want to hear what happened at the boutique.",
        "Liam: Ah.",
        "Pam: And I want to hear more about this article that you are writing.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: [Chuckles]",
        "Aly: What article? What happened at the boutique?",
        "Liam: Um, you know, we can't talk about it here. [Clears throat] I think I got him, Aly. If Wyatt did what I think he did. Then I've got him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: What does my past have to do with this?",
        "Hope: You asked me to move in with you. I think that it's a very valid question.",
        "Wyatt: Are you looking for reasons to say no now?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Wyatt: Is that it?",
        "Hope: Have you or have you not ever lived with someone before?",
        "Wyatt: In my one tiny room in the warehouse? Yeah, a lot -- lots of people.",
        "Hope: No, I mean, like -- like, when you maybe traveled around. And your -- your mom doesn't count.",
        "Wyatt: Getting along with my mom is very challenging. I'm an incredibly patient man.",
        "Hope: Is that so?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Look, Hope, I understand why you're hesitant.",
        "Hope: Do you?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Do you?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Hope: Wyatt. You just got back from a business trip, and you text me an address and said, \"Come down here. Look at this new place that I live in. And, hey, live here with me.\" That's -- that's a lot. It's a lot.",
        "Wyatt: When you say it like that, it sounds like a lot.",
        "Hope: It's a lot.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. But, hey, my -- my inexperience in the cohabitation department's a plus, right? Hmm? Look... [chuckles] you are the only person that I've wanted to share my life with. What else do I have to say to you?",
        "Hope: Nothing. Nothing. There's -- I'm -- I'm not looking for you to say or -- or do anything to prove that you care about me.",
        "Wyatt: That's good. That's good, 'cause the truth is, is I am being completely selfish right now.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Look, this place is amazing. And the only thing that would make it better is living here with you.",
        "Hope: I...I will come visit you a lot.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I knew you were gonna say that by putting your hand right here.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I'll take it.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: I will. [Chuckles] I'm gonna hold you to that.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Okay, here we go. Okay. This must be when it happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Hope, you know I would do anything for you.",
        "Hope: Oh, you were gonna give me the big bathroom, weren't you?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Hope: You were?",
        "Wyatt: Yes. Yeah, I was. I will ask you again.",
        "Hope: Good. I hope you do.",
        "Wyatt: Good.",
        "Hope: Are you upset with me?",
        "Wyatt: I knew it was a long shot.",
        "Hope: But you asked anyway.",
        "Wyatt: I'm a spontaneous guy.",
        "Hope: I love that about you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: I do. Your -- your sense of fun and adventure -- the way you look at the world. You're not afraid to take chances.",
        "Wyatt: Well, you can't succeed if you don't try, right?",
        "Hope: But we don't have to rush this. And we're -- we're together now, and -- and that's a new feeling for us.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: You know, we keep having these little windows of opportunity, but I feel like the window's open for a little bit, and then it gets shut again.",
        "Wyatt: Well, it was Liam... just letting you down and pulling you back in. I'm not gonna let him do that again to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I warned Hope. You know? I told her there was something off about Wyatt and his mom. I told her.",
        "Aly: You found out something about them?",
        "Liam: Well, I got Charlie is working on it right now, but he says that he and Wyatt were alone when he first noticed the diamond was missing.",
        "Aly: You mean stolen?",
        "Liam: Well, according to Charlie, it was just there, and then it wasn't.",
        "Aly: Right, because the jewel thieves took it.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but not according to them. I mean, did you see it? It was all over the news today. They both passed a polygraph.",
        "Aly: But the police found the diamond on them. If they didn't take it, how did it get there? You think Wyatt had something to do with it?",
        "Liam: I'm just saying, who benefited? Right? Hey, who -- who came out looking like a hero? Who ended up with Hope?",
        "Aly: I'll admit, foiling a robbery with a jug of hot coffee seems a little farfetched, but it couldn't have been a publicity stunt. Those robbers were real.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I haven't quite figured out that part yet, which is why I have Charlie helping me. But I'm telling you, Aly -- I'm telling you, something about this does not add up.",
        "Aly: Liam, I'm really sorry about what happened with you and Hope and the wedding. But to try and tie Wyatt to this robbery just seems --",
        "Liam: Aly, you don't understand. There are no boundaries with this guy. There's no line that Wyatt wouldn't cross to get what he wants, and that's a dangerous attitude. I mean, Hope is not safe with him, and she needs to know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You are not a rebound, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: But if we go too fast, if we move in together right now, it's gonna look like that.",
        "Wyatt: I know. And we didn't work that hard to rebuild Hope for the Future, just to have our relationship undermine it.",
        "Hope: Wow. I wasn't even thinking about that.",
        "Wyatt: You should. Hope, how people perceive you affects the label. That's why the diamond was the perfect tie-in for the line.",
        "Hope: But I don't want to keep our relationship a secret. I'm really proud of everything we've accomplished together.",
        "Wyatt: And you should be. I mean, you have an impact on so many young women, and that's why I'm going to continue to make sure that you get your message heard. Flawless beauty, incredible strength, and integrity. That will all come in one priceless package.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I do not trust Wyatt and his mom.",
        "Aly: But -- but Wyatt brought the diamond to Forrester. Why would he steal it?",
        "Liam: I don't know, -- so he could find it again, save the day. I mean, come on. Isn't that exactly what happened? Hope and Wyatt were trending all over the world. He knew it would generate that kind of publicity.",
        "Aly: It's kind of an extreme way to increase sales.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] Yeah. That's exactly how I would describe the Fullers -- \"extreme.\" There's -- there is nothing they won't do to advance their cause. I mean, whether that's, you know, landing Hope, or getting in good with your family, or promoting themselves and their business. I mean, whatever it takes, Aly. Whatever it takes. Quinn has hacked my e-mails. She's forged notes. She's flown halfway across the world to get Steffy just so she can sabotage my wedding. And up until now, it's all been on her, but if I could just -- if I could just prove that Wyatt is no different...",
        "Aly: Liam, I know this has all been really hard for you. You know, you and Hope were just about to get married.",
        "Liam: Well, we would have. We would have, if it weren't for Wyatt and Quinn.",
        "Aly: Quinn's done some pretty questionable things to you, but I just really don't think that she or Wyatt would do anything to harm Hope.",
        "Liam: Aly, all they care about is getting what they want, and, fortunately, right now, that means putting Hope for the Future on top, but what if that changes? What if Hope gets on one of their bad sides? I mean, Wyatt might have just sent two guys to jail for something they didn't even do. What else is he capable of?",
        "Aly: Liam those \"two guys\" are notorious jewel thieves. They came into the boutique with guns. That was not a hoax. They got caught, and now they're saying they didn't do it. It's kind of what criminals do.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. I know. I know what you're thinking, and I know it's a long shot, but maybe Charlie will find something on the security footage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: [Scoffs] There's nothing there, Liam. Wait a minute. Hello. [As Gollum] There you are, my little precious. [Normal voice] Oh, no. Wyatt. You had the diamond the whole time? You're no hero. Liam was right.",
        "Quinn: Charlie. Put the phone down."
