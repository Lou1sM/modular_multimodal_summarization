        "Ridge and Caroline kiss passionately. She says if they do this they can not go back. Whatever they do or don't do it will be lost. He is not with Katie and Rick has moved on. They both want something they have not had before. Maya and Rick are snuggled in bed and she asks if he has ever slept in here before. He laughs that yes although it wasn't even overnight. All were away except the staff and he came in and climbed in the bed to see how it felt to be his dad .until he was startled by a screaming Stephanie who had returned and was stunned that Brooke's son was in her bed. Maya says she had made mistakes but she wants to be good to him. He says that is why he put her picture on the wall. They hug and kiss when she says she will make the best wife for him. They do joke that he does not know what a small orange, actually a tangerine is, since he's only been to a grocery store once. Ivy and Aly walk into the Forrester home and wonder if Maya and Rick are there and are afraid to barge in and find out or see something they don't want to see. They notice the clothes strewn on the staircase. And they decide not to let the family dinner go to waste and make plans to serve it on the coffee table. Maya tells Rick that she thought she heard a car. Rick says there is always someone coming or going not to mention Aly and Ivy. Maya says wishes her family could see her now. They always thought she'd never amount to anything. Every choice was a catastrophe and it almost was. She asks if they will last and he says it is up to them. He can not predict the future but she more than makes up for it by saying she has a super power and she can.",
        "Caroline is not sure she is ready and Ridge says he is not pushing her. Caroline does not like these feelings of being out of control or feeling that she failed. She wanted to stay married. Ridge says he knows and he wanted to be a better person so there is plenty of failure to go around. They did not have an affair but it was more than that and they know it. She asks what does he see in her now. He says fear and the other Caroline had it too although they are not alike. He says Caroline is not reckless or sweet. He says he is not living in the past and knows exactly where he is going. Caroline says she wants him but she wants this to last and she needs time. He says he will not seduce her and he thinks it can be easy to filter out what others will say. Ridge holds her in his arms when she says an hour ago she would have thought this impossible but now it feels so right. Ivy calls Rick upstairs to see if they are going to come down for dinner. He is not hungry and Maya forgot to tell him their dinner was ready. Ivy says she will see him tomorrow. They decide to just have some wine and Maya offers to go down to basement to get a bottle and she will stop and get some cheese to go with it. He tells her he is sure Eric has a corkscrew around here somewhere. With Maya gone, he looks on Eric's side in the drawer but does not find and then he opens the other side and is taken aback when he finds a gun. He picks it up and holds it."

        "Maya: Did you ever sleep in this room before?",
        "Rick: Only one time that I could remember. But it wasn't overnight. My dad had let me use the pool. And they were all away, like, on a golf tournament or a tennis tournament or somewhere. So I was all alone, except for the staff, of course. I don't know. I just wanted to see how my dad slept. When I was a kid... I used to crawl in bed with my mom and dad, and it was great, you know? My dad has moved on, and... you know, I just -- I was curious. I wanted to see how he slept and where he slept now. So I came into the bedroom, and, you know, covers were made, so I crawled in the bed real carefully, and... laid on my back. I didn't move a muscle, and I just crossed my arms. And I just stared at the ceiling, just... wishing that I could have my dad back. And the next thing I know, there was this blood-curdling shriek that came out of nowhere. I don't even know how long I was out for. And there was Stephanie. She'd come home... and here was Brooke's son, laying in her bed, looking like a corpse.",
        "Maya: Was she awful to you, Stephanie?",
        "Rick: I don't know. You just never knew what Stephanie you would get, and that's not the reason I took the picture down.",
        "Maya: So why, then?",
        "Rick: You know, most people are like that -- you never know what side you're gonna get. Most people. But not you.",
        "Maya: Oh. [Chuckles] We both know I've made my fair share of mistakes. So don't love me because I'm good. Love me because I want to be good to you.",
        "Rick: See, that's why I want your picture on my wall.",
        "Maya: I will make the best life for you, Rick. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Okay. So tell me more about this.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] I'm never gonna get these earring designs done!",
        "Aly: Oh, I am sure you will.",
        "Ivy: Gosh, what a day.",
        "Aly: Yeah, I feel old enough to retire.",
        "Ivy: Huh. Well, do you think they're on the patio?",
        "Aly: Oh, I wonder if there's dinner.",
        "Ivy: Why are we whispering?",
        "Aly: I don't know. I don't... feel like breezing in and calling out, \"hey, Rick and Maya, I'm home!\" Do you?",
        "Ivy: No, but... on the other hand, it could be better than walking in on something that we don't want to see.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] Well, I don't think they're on the patio.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I heard a car.",
        "Rick: Yeah? Maybe it's a delivery.",
        "Maya: Wouldn't they ring the doorbell?",
        "Rick: Well, people are always coming and going. If it's not the maids or the watchmen, it's Aly and Ivy... or anybody else who has a key, for that matter.",
        "Maya: Well -- oh! -- We didn't have grapes in the bowl on the landing. Only kiwis and clementines.",
        "Rick: Clementines.",
        "Maya: Uh-huh.",
        "Rick: Is that like a mandarin or tangerine or...?",
        "Maya: Oh. Right. Rick Forrester's never been to the grocery store.",
        "Rick: I take offense to that. I've been one time.",
        "Maya: Okay. Well, this is a Clementine, but you don't have to worry about that because I'll just go for you and get all the food that you need. Can I peel you one?",
        "Rick: Actually, I've changed my mind.",
        "Maya: Was it something I said?",
        "Rick: It's everything you say. I've never had anybody talk to me the way you do... with so much love and so much care. And I'm sitting here, and I'm wondering if I'm even deserving of it.",
        "Maya: Well, people don't get what they deserve in this life, as far as I can tell. They get what they're given and what they can take. Take me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: No, I --",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Caroline: I'm... I'm so sorry.",
        "Ridge: Don't do that. Don't, um... uh...",
        "Caroline: No, it's -- oh, God -- it's not you.",
        "Ridge: I want what you want. Just trust that.",
        "Caroline: It's... if we -- [Chuckles] We can't go back.",
        "Ridge: That's a given. Whatever we do or don't do, it's, um... everything else is lost. Katie's gone... Rick is living with someone else, and -- and... good behavior's not gonna bring that back. The only thing that's left is wanting something we've never had before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: You know, we really should've stopped somewhere on the way home and eaten.",
        "Aly: Maybe not. Rosario wanted to know whether to serve dinner in the dining room or in here.",
        "Ivy: Oh. How did she know that we're home?",
        "Aly: Well, she didn't. She's cooking for Rick and Maya.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Who are where?",
        "Aly: Well... we wouldn't want Rosario's cooking to go to waste now, would we?",
        "Ivy: Now you're talking.",
        "Aly: I told you I wasn't perfect.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You know, my family never thought I'd amount to anything. They thought every decision I made would be a complete catastrophe. Although, to be fair, some of them were.",
        "Rick: We all have people in our past like that. Unfortunately, we're related to most of them.",
        "Maya: True that. Sometimes... I just wish they could see I turned out okay.",
        "Rick: Lead model of Forrester Creations -- I mean, come on.",
        "Maya: Blissfully happy partner of the C.E.O.",
        "Rick: That's not what makes you amazing.",
        "Maya: Will we last, Rick?",
        "Rick: I would say that that's up to us. But, then again, I don't think I'd be honest. Unforeseeable things happen. We can't see the future.",
        "Maya: Well, then maybe that's my superpower. Because I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I don't know if I'm ready.",
        "Ridge: For what?",
        "Caroline: You -- uh, this.",
        "Ridge: I-I'm -- I'm not pushing you. You can take me or leave me. It's good.",
        "Caroline: I haven't been very good at either of those things. I... I-I don't -- I don't like those feelings.",
        "Ridge: Which one?",
        "Caroline: This... out-of-control feeling. I...",
        "Ridge: That's what people live for, isn't it?",
        "Caroline: I don't... I don't like feeling like I -- I failed. I-I wanted to stay married. I...",
        "Ridge: I know.",
        "Caroline: 'Cause I -- I could've... I could've made it last.",
        "Ridge: Wasn't up to you. I mean, I -- I wanted very much to be a better person. So, there you are -- a lot of failure to go around.",
        "Caroline: There's nothing wrong with you.",
        "Ridge: Really? I couldn't get past my ex-wife having an affair with her sister's husband, and now I did the same with my brother's wife.",
        "Caroline: We didn't have an affair, though.",
        "Ridge: No, you're right. We were just kissing, huh? We both know it was always more than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Mmm.",
        "Maya: That's a clementine.",
        "[Intercom beeps]",
        "Rick: That's the intercom. What? Who's calling me?",
        "Maya: Oh! Rosario. I asked her to make us dinner. I totally forgot.",
        "Rick: This is Rick.",
        "Ivy: Hey. So, uh, Aly and I are home, and, um... hey, are -- are you busy or on another call or...?",
        "Rick: Ivy, you dialed this extension. You know exactly where I am. So you were wondering what?",
        "Ivy: Yes. Uh, we were just -- we were just wondering if you were gonna come down for dinner, because if not, then we'll just, uh --",
        "Rick: I've changed my mind. I'm not hungry after all. Got everything I need here.",
        "Ivy: Okay. Well, um, I guess I'll just -- I'll see you tomorrow or -- or sometime.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'm sure you will. Bye.",
        "Ivy: Well, it's ours, fair and square.",
        "Aly: So, Maya's with him?",
        "Ivy: Well, that was definitely the gist of it, yeah.",
        "Aly: She has basically cemented herself to his wallet.",
        "Ivy: Well, I don't think it's his wallet that's in play right now.",
        "Aly: How can Rick be acting this way? And how can you be so calm about it?",
        "Ivy: I think it must be a really powerful feeling to know that somebody is backing you, no matter what, and that is exactly what Maya is doing for Rick.",
        "Aly: Okay. That's true. I have that with Oliver.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I hope I have that one day, too. Come on. Dinner is getting cold.",
        "Aly: If you were Caroline, would you give up?",
        "Ivy: I can't say I understand why she hasn't. I mean, it's not like Rick is giving her any mixed messages. Unless she's afraid.",
        "Aly: Of what?",
        "Ivy: Of drowning if she lets go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I -- I need to know something.",
        "Ridge: Ask me.",
        "Caroline: What do you see when you look at me?",
        "Ridge: All right. Now I see fear. Why is that? Are you afraid of me?",
        "Caroline: No.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Then what is it?",
        "Caroline: Is... that how she looked? To you? The other Caroline.",
        "Ridge: My first love.",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: You're not that. You're not her. And fear -- there was fear... but not of each other. Just of what was gonna happen. And do you look like her? Yeah, you do. Do you remind me of her? Yes, sometimes you do. She was, um... she -- she was a studied woman, and she was deliberate... and she was sweet. And you're not deliberate. You're not reckless. And you're not sweet.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: But I'm not living in my past, Caroline. I know exactly where I am, and I know exactly who's standing in front of me.",
        "Caroline: You don't think I'm sweet.",
        "Ridge: I...",
        "Caroline: No, you're right. I'm not. And I'm not reckless. This... this thing that's... leading me to you, if it was... if it was just wanting you, if it was just... purely physical, then --",
        "Ridge: Then we would have done it already.",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. I'm not seducing you.",
        "Caroline: Well, maybe I'm the one. Maybe I'm seducing you.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: You have to --",
        "Ridge: You can't do that --",
        "Caroline: You have to just let me --",
        "Ridge: Okay. You lead, I'll follow, but you can't -- in the middle of it, you can't.",
        "Caroline: God. Do we have room for this, though?",
        "Ridge: In our real lives, you mean?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I mean, God, that's why -- we're working together, and -- and your family and my family...",
        "Ridge: It's gonna be hugely difficult and a little messy maybe, but it could be fantastico. What do you want, Caroline? What do you want?",
        "Caroline: You. Time.",
        "Ridge: Take all the time you need.",
        "Caroline: We can wait?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: I-I real-- I want this to last. I do. This part -- the getting to know each other that...",
        "Ridge: Me too. I just -- you know, I didn't... I just didn't want you to run.",
        "Caroline: Where would I go? I-I can't just... close my eyes and jump, but I... I won't run.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] I'm just thinking about tomorrow. Trying not to think about tomorrow.",
        "Ridge: Well, then don't think about tomorrow. Let's just enjoy today.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. 'Cause that's so easy.",
        "Ridge: It is. If you can filter out what other people think about you, maybe you can filter out... what you think about yourself.",
        "Caroline: Does anybody actually do that?",
        "Ridge: I don't think so. That didn't sound good. Hey.",
        "Caroline: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: This feels good.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. It feels right. I think that we should pay attention to that. I think that we should... pay attention to what feels right. 'Cause...an hour ago, this felt impossible, and... you know, now it just feels...",
        "Ridge: It feels like... what happiness may be, for a minute.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] Yeah, maybe for a minute. You know... all my life, I was trying to find happiness. And... what if... all along, it was trying to find me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I'll go.",
        "Maya: Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't worry about it. So, uh, just down the back stairs and into the basement, I guess?",
        "Rick: Uh, no, actually, it's the wine cellar. It's more like a vault.",
        "Maya: Oh. How vampiric of you.",
        "Rick: Well, this is California. We have earthquakes. We don't want to waste our precious wine with the house collapsing on it.",
        "Maya: Okay. Uh, and then I'll pop into the kitchen and get some cheese or whatever?",
        "Rick: Read my mind.",
        "Maya: And a bottle opener?",
        "Rick: If I know my father, there's a corkscrew somewhere in this room.",
        "Maya: Okay. Be right back.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Maya: Oh, I forgot to ask... did something happen?",
        "Rick: No. No, no. Uh... I just realized this must have been Stephanie's side of the bed. What did you forget?",
        "Maya: What kind of wine do you want?",
        "Rick: Anything.",
        "Maya: Anything?",
        "Rick: Anything. Just don't take too long reading the labels.",
        "Maya: I could take a course. I'll learn all about wines.",
        "Rick: I'll teach you. I lived in France for years.",
        "Maya: I will learn to be a good hostess, Rick. I will. I will never embarrass you.",
        "Rick: You never have. You never could.",
        "Maya: I love you.",
        "Rick: We're gonna need that corkscrew.",
        "Maya: Okay.",
