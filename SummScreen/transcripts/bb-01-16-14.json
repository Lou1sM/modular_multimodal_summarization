        "Brooke opens the door to find Bill standing there. He says he saw Katie and she turned him down flat. They will have to find another way to go on from here. Brooke says they broke Katie's trust so now he is going to have to try harder to make it work. She says Katie wants her family so he must convince her to let him come back home. He reminds her that she used to want him so how can she turn it on and off like a switch as he can't. She points out that she always wanted Ridge. If he had not left her on their honeymoon she and Bill would have never happened. Bill says Ridge was a bad habit that she never had a reason to break before now. She tells him that he is going to go home and convince Katie that their marriage is worth saving and she is going to do the same with Ridge. She warns Bill that he is going to have to fight and show Katie that she is worth a little effort. He says it is hard thinking of her and Ridge. She says don't think then. Just get Katie back and think of her and she will think of Ridge. He needs to bury his feelings for Brooke. She needs Ridge to trust her again. And she needs to see love and respect in Katie's eyes again. She picks up a picture of her and Ridge and RJ and says this is the family she loves. She is not going to sacrifice them for anyone not even him. He slips around behind her and starts to nuzzle on her neck. She jerks away and says don't ever touch her like that ever again. Aly tells Liam that his theory about Wyatt is very interesting. Liam replies that is not even a theory, just his gut wrenching intuition that Wyatt had something to do with taking that diamond. But he needs proof. But if Wyatt did take the diamond just to make himself look like a hero then he's as dangerous as his mother. He starts to call Hope but Aly says he needs to wait and get proof. If he doesn't have proof it will just look like the jealous ex-boyfriend trying to shoot down the new one. He argues that Hope is not safe. Wyatt has full access to her and he's not trustworthy. Liam needs to protect her now. But he agrees that Aly is right; he needs to wait and get proof. Wyatt tells Hope that she is beautiful and would be even more beautiful if she changed her mind and moved in with him. She says that is what she likes about him; he's consistent. He says yeah she doesn't have to worry about him. She's beginning to believe that. They all make mistakes but they just have to learn from them and not do it again. He says he hears her. He's certainly done things that he's not proud of. But she makes him want to be a better man. She kisses him.",
        "Quinn tells Charlie that she has a wild guess that he is calling Liam. Charlie says Liam deserves to know that Wyatt is not a hero; he's a thief. Quinn stands over him and says he is not going to make that call to Liam or anyone else and she will tell him why. No one got hurt. Charlie says they could have and it happened on his watch and that is very stressful. And Wyatt was the one that put his life in danger and set the thieves up. And Wyatt comes off like some fearless wonder to Hope. It's not true, it's not fair and he's not going to let it stand. Quinn sits down and nicely points out a few facts. Charlie likes his job, he likes the Forrester's, he even got a girlfriend, Pam, out of the deal. Wyatt and Hope are together now and happy but if he goes and badmouths Wyatt then Hope might not want Charlie around anymore. She tries to convince him that Wyatt taking the diamond was an innocent prank to generate publicity. It wasn't his best thought out plan but he doesn't deserve to go to jail for it. And as a mother she can not let that happen. Charlie says he know where she is coming from. Mothers should protect their children but they can't go around breaking the law. She says Wyatt has never been in love before and he got caught up in the moment, one that will never happen again. Very sweetly she asks Charlie to keep Wyatt's part in this between the two of them. Then he won't have anything to be sorry about later. Liam calls Charlie. Quinn tells Charlie to be careful. Liam is so sure that Charlie must have found something to implicate Wyatt but with Quinn's hand on his shoulder, Charlie tells Liam sorry kid, nothing. Hope opens a message from Liam that he has something important to tell her. Then she opens the second one that says never mind."

        "Brooke: [Sighs] You can't keep showing up here.",
        "Bill: You insisted I go to Katie. Thought you'd want a progress report.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Okay. So, what happened? Did she take you back?",
        "Bill: No. Turned me down flat. So, what do you suggest, Brooke? Where do we go from here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Your theory about Wyatt is interesting.",
        "Liam: Well, at this point, it's not even a theory. It's just a gut-churning intuition that Wyatt had something to do with stealing that diamond, if he didn't take it himself.",
        "Aly: She won't believe that without solid proof.",
        "Liam: That's why I have to find some, because, Aly, if Wyatt did this, I mean, if he's capable of stealing something just to make himself look like a hero, then he's just as dangerous as his mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You're staring.",
        "Wyatt: You're beautiful.",
        "Hope: Oh. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: And here with me in my new home, which could be your home if you change your mind about moving in here.",
        "Hope: You know what I like about you?",
        "Wyatt: What's that?",
        "Hope: You're consistent.",
        "Wyatt: A nice change?",
        "Hope: I'm not making comParisons.",
        "Wyatt: You don't have to. I know what you've been through. You don't have to worry about me.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I'm starting to believe that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Let me take a wild guess. Calling Liam?",
        "Charlie: Well, he -- he deserves to know what's happened here. I mean...Wyatt's no hero. Wyatt's a thief.",
        "Quinn: You're not going to make that call. Not to Liam or to anyone else. And I'm going to tell you why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: If Wyatt the jewel thief is a tough sell to me, you can imagine how it's gonna fly with Hope.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Can you tell me why this is so hard to believe? I mean, I knew something was off with Wyatt the moment I saw him. He -- he was so immediately entitled to everything -- Hope, my dad. This makes perfect sense to me. So -- so educate me. What am I missing?",
        "Aly: Well, you just said it. Wyatt made a play for Hope right off the bat. He didn't try to hide it, so naturally, you're not gonna like him. He was a threat. It was personal. But to most, Wyatt's just this charming guy, talented, funny.",
        "Liam: Whoa, whoa, hey. What side are you on, pal?",
        "Aly: I'm just trying to make you see that your point of view isn't the same as everybody else's, especially Hope's. Wyatt's only shown her his best. Without undeniable evidence, there's no way you're gonna make her believe that he stole that diamond.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I don't know if you have kids or not, Charlie, but even if you do, a father's love is -- it's one thing. But a mother's -- it's, well, it's a different animal.",
        "Charlie: My sweet mother, rest her soul, always taught me to tell the truth. And the truth here is something you just don't like.",
        "Quinn: Nobody got hurt, except for the would-be jewel thieves.",
        "Charlie: What about me? Wyatt put me in danger. And I was really stressed that this happened on my watch.",
        "Quinn: Charlie, you came out of this a hero.",
        "Charlie: The point is, is that Wyatt set me and those jewel thieves up. And then he comes out of it looking like some fearless wonder to Hope. It's not true, it's not fair, and I'm not going to let it stand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: This.",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Wyatt: You and me, together. It's nice.",
        "Hope: You what?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Hope: Sorry, you've... you've always been this really intriguing combination of safe and unpredictable. You know, like, you keep me off balance, like anything could happen.",
        "Wyatt: And that's a good thing?",
        "Hope: I like it.",
        "Wyatt: Then it's a good thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You have to get Katie to take you back.",
        "Bill: I tried!",
        "Brooke: Try harder!",
        "Bill: She keeps turning me down.",
        "Brooke: Because she doesn't trust it. And that's what we did. We broke her trust. Now you have to try harder to make it work. She wants her family, Bill. Convince her to let you come back home.",
        "Bill: Well, part of me still wants that. But a bigger part still wants you. You used to feel the same way. You saying those feelings have died? You can just turn it on and off like flipping a switch? I'm gonna need some pointers, Brooke, because I can't do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Even if Wyatt was smart enough to nab the diamond out of camera range, I know he did it. I'm gonna find some way to prove it.",
        "Aly: What are you doing?",
        "Liam: I am texting Hope.",
        "Aly: You're telling her?",
        "Liam: I have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Charlie, who pays your salary?",
        "Charlie: Well, what does that have to do with anything?",
        "Quinn: Hope for the Future, right? In other words, Hope.",
        "Charlie: So?",
        "Quinn: You like working here?",
        "Charlie: What's not to like? I mean, the Forresters are terrific -- wait.",
        "Quinn: You even got a girlfriend out of the deal.",
        "Charlie: You leave Pam out of this!",
        "Quinn: Oh, whoa, Charlie. No need to get touchy. I'm just trying to point out the perks that you walked into here.",
        "Charlie: What are you getting at? Wh-- you gon-- gonna have me fired?",
        "Quinn: N-- Charlie. Come on. You're hurting my feelings here. Wyatt and Hope are together now, and they're happy. Now, if you come along, virtual stranger, and start making accusations against Wyatt to Hope, well... she may not want you around.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well -- well maybe it's Wyatt that's going to be, uh, persona non grata. And I-I think that's what you're really afraid of.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt taking the diamond was a prank. It was an innocent ploy on his behalf to generate publicity for Hope and her line. Now, granted [Chuckles] Was it one of his best thought-out plans? Absolutely not. Does he deserve to go to jail for it? Absolutely not. And, Charlie, as his mother, I cannot let that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: How does it feel?",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Wyatt: To be you.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. This inspirational person.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Young people all over the world just admire you, emulate you. They want to wear what you wear. They -- they look to you for a direction on how to live their lives. I mean, that responsibility got to be hard to handle sometimes.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I mean, it can get dicey.",
        "Wyatt: Huh.",
        "Hope: When I first decided that I wanted to tie Hope for the Future in with my principles, nothing had happened to me. You know, I'd never had my heart broken. I'd never made any really terrible decisions. And -- and that changed. And, um, I don't know. It got hard, but I-I think I learned a valuable lesson.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? And what's that?",
        "Hope: That we all make mistakes. And we just have to do the best we can not to make the same ones again.",
        "Wyatt: I... I hear you. [Chuckles] I've done some things that I can't say that I'm proud of. But you make me want to be a better man. You give me something to live up to. And I'm so just incredibly proud to be with you. I want you to feel the same way about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I know you still love me.",
        "Brooke: Ridge has never been my second choice. He's always been my first. And if he hadn't hurt me so badly, if he came back earlier, you and I never would have happened. Being with Ridge is what I want.",
        "Bill: Or it's a conditioned reflex.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] What does that mean?",
        "Bill: He's a bad habit you've never had any reason to break.",
        "Brooke: No, no --",
        "Bill: But now you do.",
        "Brooke: You know what? You're gonna go home, and you're gonna reclaim your marriage. You're gonna reclaim your family. You're gonna prove to your son what a commitment is all about. You're gonna stand by your vows. And you're gonna do whatever you can to convince Katie that your marriage is worth saving.",
        "Bill: And you're going to the do the same with Ridge?",
        "Brooke: I'm gonna do the same with Ridge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I thought you were gonna wait for proof Wyatt actually took the diamond before telling Hope.",
        "Liam: I know, but she's with him. Wyatt has full access, and he's not trustworthy.",
        "Aly: But what if you're wrong? You'll look like a jealous ex-boyfriend who's trying to shoot down the new one. You can make them even closer.",
        "Liam: Aly, I... okay, yeah, I... I hear what you're saying. But I don't trust them, and that means there's a clock on this. Look, if I'm gonna be Hope's husband someday ever, then that means I have to protect her. It's my job to protect her. Not later. Now. I mean, I-I know my theory about Wyatt is a little far-fetched, but if I'm right, if he's capable of this kind of deception, then Hope needs to get far, far away from him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Am I getting through to you, Charlie?",
        "Charlie: Look, I-I respect where you're coming from. Mothers are supposed to protect their children. But sometimes you have to take responsibility.",
        "Quinn: It was a mistake made with the best of intentions. Was it foolish? Okay, it was foolish. But Wyatt's never been in love before.",
        "Charlie: But you can't just go breaking the law in the name of love.",
        "Quinn: He got caught up in the excitement of an idea. It was a moment. That is never going to happen again.",
        "Charlie: What about Liam?",
        "Quinn: Hope and Liam have had problems for a very long time, having absolutely nothing to do with Wyatt. Charlie... I am asking you very nicely... keep Wyatt's involvement in the jewel heist between us, that way you won't have anything to be sorry about later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I love it when I'm right.",
        "Hope: [Laughs] Oh, yeah? About what?",
        "Wyatt: Us. That we're meant to be.",
        "Hope: Really?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hope: Always believed that?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Hope: Yeah?",
        "Wyatt: Actually, I had a moment of doubt. Um, when you asked me to back off, and, uh, respect your wishes.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: And I did. It wasn't fun for me. Just knowing you were gonna marry Liam and I couldn't do anything about it just killed me. [Clears throat] But you didn't. And you're here now.",
        "Hope: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: And these past few months, the way my life has changed, living in a warehouse loft to [Chuckling] This...",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: ...Business is ridiculous. But best of all... most important... I have you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Katie wants her family back more than she wants to be mad at you.",
        "Bill: Listen, I-I don't know what more I can say, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Bill, you're gonna have to think back and reconnect with those feelings, when you and Katie were first in love.",
        "Bill: Yeah. You make that sound so easy. But you're forgetting that Katie has a vote, and she has made it crystal clear that she's not interested in getting back together.",
        "Brooke: [Scoffs] So that's it? You're just gonna accept that? You have to fight. You have to show Katie that she's worth a little effort.",
        "Bill: This is hard, you know.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Thinking of you with Ridge.",
        "Brooke: Don't think of me and Ridge. Think of your life, and I will think of mine.",
        "Bill: I can't do that. Not with the feelings I still have for you.",
        "Brooke: Bury them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Bury my feelings? That's your solution?",
        "Brooke: You know that horrible plan you came up with when you were dangling off the side of the mountain to deceive both Katie and me? Well, that changed everything, Bill. I just need my life back. I need Katie to look at me with that love and respect in her eyes. I need Ridge to trust me again. [Sighs] This is my family. These are the people that I love. And I am not gonna sacrifice them for anybody. Even you. [Sighs] Don't. Don't. Please don't touch me like that ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Charlie: It's Liam.",
        "Quinn: Careful, Charlie.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Charlie: Hi, uh, Liam, uh, I was just gonna call you.",
        "Liam: Yes! You found something, didn't you? Did -- did the cameras catch Wyatt palming the diamond? I know they did. Charlie? You there?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I'm here. Um...",
        "Liam: Hey, whoa. If you're hesitating, don't. I mean, think about Pam. Right? If she were jeopardy, what if -- what if she were hooking up with the one kind of guy? You'd want her to know, right?",
        "Charlie: There's nothing.",
        "Liam: Nothing?",
        "Charlie: Sorry, kid.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Singer: Time and space is a lonely place",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Singer: There's no sound just a heart that pounds life's unknown where's the way back home? In my mind is a silent cry what you feel",
        "Quinn: Good, Charlie.",
        "Singer: What you know you're not in control oh-oh-oh-oh-oh if you just let it go there's a peace you'll know oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh there's a peace you'll know oh-oh-oh"
