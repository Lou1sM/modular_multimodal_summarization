    "Recap": [
        "Revitalized, Caroline starts sketching when Ridge comes in. He tries to kiss her several times but she pulls back, yet seems happy. They finally do kiss and he says he does not care what her Uncle Bill will say. She has no choice as he is not going to let her go. She says they need to take things slow. He agrees, he does not want it to end before it begins. Ivy asks Rick if he has heard from Wyatt as she needs to proceed on a few things. Then she asks about Hope and he says no to both fronts, but it won't be long. She starts in again about him and Caroline and wants to know if he no longer loves her. He tells her they have had this conversation before. She says there is only so much a woman can take. So if he is just hurting Caroline to get back at her, it may backfire. Rick says he is not distracted by Caroline now; just the business. He could not be at his best with Ridge challenging him at every turn. Having total control of the company for a year will prove he can succeed. He appreciates her concern but he has a lot of work he needs to get done. Carter is working out and Othello joins him but they don't get into much when Maya joins them and is happy to announce that Rick told her last night that he loved her. What they have is real. She is his lady. Carter laughs as this only came up when she told him, presto just like that. She says Rick moved mountains to be with her so what else do they want.",
        "Caroline tells Ridge that she feels sort of guilty but for the first time in a long time she does not feel miserable here at work. But how is this going to work with them working and yet reporting to Rick. He says he is here now so he does not want to talk about Rick. At that moment he gets a text from Rick wanting to see their designs. Maya admits to Carter that she was intimidated by Caroline with the hold she had on Rick but not know or ever again. Maya wants to make a few changes at work and Carter reminds her she is not the CEO. She says no, just the woman behind the CEO. Ivy notices that Caroline is smiling once again and wants to know what is up. All Caroline will do is smile and say they will wait for Ridge. Eventually Ivy gets it out of her that this new attitude is due to Ridge. He has told her she is beautiful and strong. They are more than just a team but are taking it slow, very slow. Ridge marches into Rick's office and says it will be a cold day in hell when he takes orders from Rick. Rick says they had a deadline and it was due this morning. Ridge says Rick is disrespecting his mother and his father. Rick says Eric is not his father and Stephanie is not Rick's mother. And he is living in the house now and can do what he wants. Maya comes in and throws in her two cents that Ridge is a problem and if he can't handle it he can find employment elsewhere. If he can not respect Rick's choices then at least respect him as the boss or go somewhere else. Ridge storms out and Maya goes to Rick to smooth his feathers. He says no one has ever come to his rescue like that but they have each other and will run this company. Ivy tells Caroline that her lips are sealed. They are interrupted by a young girl who wants to see Maya, her sister. Othello tells Carter that Rick has always felt like the family bastard because of how they all treated Ridge."

        "Ridge: Work with me. Hi. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",
        "Caroline: I was up all night. Is this crazy? I mean, can we -- can we let this happen? What are people gonna think? What is my uncle gonna think?",
        "Ridge: I don't care about uncle bill or anybody else. Oh, and by the way, you're off the hook. You don't have a choice. I'm not letting you go.",
        "Othello: Dude, you've got that much steam to blow off? You should roll through the club. I got some ladies you need to meet.",
        "Carter: Yeah? Really?",
        "Othello: Oh, yeah.",
        "Maya: Oh, ladies, ladies, ladies. Hello, Othello.",
        "Othello: Maya, how are you?",
        "Maya: Carter.",
        "Carter: We're in the middle of something, Maya.",
        "Othello: We can always make time for a pretty lady.",
        "Carter: Well, what is it, Maya? You look like you're in an exceptionally good mood.",
        "Maya: And why might that be, Carter?",
        "Othello: Because she's the queen of this whole empire.",
        "Maya: Stop.",
        "Carter: Well, mistress of this whole empire would be more accurate.",
        "Maya: Not even your snarky little comments could deflate the high I'm on today.",
        "Carter: Maya, I want you to be careful. Falling head over heels for a guy who's not even committed --",
        "Maya: Oh, but he is. And he told me last night, and then later last night, this morning, later this morning, five minutes ago in his office. Rick loves me.",
        "Ivy: So, have you heard from Wyatt? I'm just wondering if I should e-mail him about these new designs or wait until he gets back.",
        "Rick: No. But, uh, he shouldn't be away much longer.",
        "Ivy: Okay. Have you heard from hope?",
        "Rick: No, I haven't. But hope's strong. She and Wyatt will pull through this.",
        "Ivy: That's what I admire most about marriage. You say these vows on a day where you love each other the most, and then you hold on to that feeling, and you remember it when you're facing your worst.",
        "Rick: Whatever it takes to get them through this horrible time.",
        "Ivy: You know, that could get you through yours, too.",
        "Rick: Ivy...",
        "Ivy: Look, I-I-I care about you, Rick. And Caroline, too. Can you honestly look at me and tell me that you don't love her anymore?",
        "Maya: What Rick and I have is real. I'm his lady, and he loves me.",
        "Othello: [Chuckles] You know I've always been team Maya.",
        "Maya: Okay.",
        "Carter: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Carter: Nothing.",
        "Maya: No. What?",
        "Carter: It's just fast, that's all. I asked if Rick said, \"I love you,\" you said he didn't, and then, presto, it happens.",
        "Maya: So?",
        "Carter: So did you say, \"I love you,\" and he responded with \"I love you, too,\" or did you confront him about it?",
        "Maya: What difference does it make?",
        "Carter: A big one. If he only said it because you brought it up, then how do you know he didn't just say it to not upset you?",
        "Maya: Rick loves me. We are in love. He moved mountains so that we could be together. How much more proof do you need?",
        "Rick: It's not a conversation I want to have with you.",
        "Ivy: Rick, I'm just concerned.",
        "Rick: And there's nothing to be concerned about.",
        "Ivy: You are deliberately trying to hurt Caroline, and in turn, you're lashing out at everyone else.",
        "Rick: Come on. Don't be ridiculous.",
        "Ivy: You devastated Pam when you hung that portrait of Maya.",
        "Rick: Ivy, we've already discussed this.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, and -- and before the truth came out, you basically threatened to kick me out of the company if I dared say anything about you kissing Maya.",
        "Rick: Okay, that was a little bit extreme.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Rick: But as C.E.O., I need to know that I have allies.",
        "Ivy: Rick, I knew how much that would devastate Caroline, and I didn't say a word. Surely I've earned your trust.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] You have.",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, then trust me. Rick, if you're doing all of this just to get back at Caroline because, deep down, you still love her, you have to know that there is only so much a woman can take.",
        "Caroline: How do we know that this is real?",
        "Ridge: Real and not just... fear and pain sparking two artists?",
        "Caroline: That it's not just something that we're...conjuring up, you know, to deal with the loss of Katie or Rick?",
        "Ridge: We don't know. And that's why we can't rush this or -- or even try to define it.",
        "Caroline: We just...have to take things slow.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. I don't want this to end before it ever had a chance to begin.",
        "Rick: My concern is no longer about Ridge and Caroline. It's about running this business.",
        "Ivy: How could you not be distracted by all this?",
        "Rick: [Sighs] I've only ever had one dream. Ever since I was a kid, I dreamt of making my mark at this empire and making my father proud.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, by tRicking him. Seems pretty risky.",
        "Rick: It was, but I believe it's a decision that will prove successful. I-I couldn't be at my best with Ridge undermining my every turn.",
        "Ivy: Do you really think that this contract is gonna stop Ridge from challenging you?",
        "Rick: No. No, I don't. My father favoritism towards Ridge no longer tips the scales. And having absolute control over the company for a year gives me that opportunity to prove what I can do. Ridge has tormented me since I was a child. First my mother and now my wife. [Sighs] Look, Ivy... I appreciate your concern. I do. I have a lot of work I got to get done.",
        "Caroline: I can't believe this.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Caroline: I... this is the first time in a very long time that I haven't been completely miserable here.",
        "Ridge: You're welcome.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] And I-I-I feel kind of guilty that I feel so...relieved, you know? I mean, no more tears for... the man that does not want me.",
        "Ridge: He was an idiot. He lost of sight of who and what you are.",
        "Caroline: How is this all gonna work? I mean, us being together and... working for Rick.",
        "Ridge: Can you do me a favor?",
        "Caroline: Hmm?",
        "Ridge: Can we not talk about Rick right now? I'm here.",
        "Caroline: You sure?",
        "Ridge: Absolutely.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Ridge: Ah, there we go. Speak of the devil. He wants to see the designs.",
        "Othello: My boy Rick is not the most subtle -- replacing Stephanie's portrait with a portrait of you?",
        "Maya: I know. I know. I was shocked at first, too. And it was a little awkward, but, hey, if my man wants to spoil me --",
        "Carter: Is that why you came up here? To flaunt the affections of Rick Forrester?",
        "Maya: That and to let you know you were wrong. You thought Rick would never choose me over Caroline, that -- that I could never measure up.",
        "Carter: Is that what you heard?",
        "Maya: I'll admit it. I was intimidated by Caroline, the hold she had on Rick, but not anymore. Not ever again.",
        "Ivy: Caroline, I've brought in some pieces to show you from, uh -- from the latest... from the latest collection.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Ivy: Well, it's -- you're smiling.",
        "Caroline: I am, aren't I?",
        "Ivy: Yes. What's brought this on?",
        "Caroline: Um, about those samples. Uh, ooh, I can't make a decision without Ridge, because he and I are a team, and it's our line, so I can't...make any decisions without...Ridge.",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, I guess we'll just -- we'll wait for Ridge, then.",
        "Caroline: Yes. We'll...wait for Ridge.",
        "Rick: Oh, good. You got my text. Where are the designs? Well, Ridge, I don't exactly appreciate the silent treatment.",
        "Ridge: Whatever games you played with dad, that's between the two of you.",
        "Rick: This has nothing --",
        "Ridge: With all due respect, Mr. C.E.O., it's gonna be a cold day in hell when I take orders from you.",
        "Maya: I just feel like this place is -- it's so old-fashioned. It's, like, almost colonial. You know, they need some new pieces, something to jazz it up a bit.",
        "Carter: Hate to break it to you, but you're not the C.E.O.",
        "Maya: No. I'm the woman behind the C.E.O., The one he relies on for support.",
        "Carter: Well, he -- he has a whole company he relies on.",
        "Maya: Like your BFF Ridge?",
        "Carter: Ridge is committed to Forrester.",
        "Maya: Is he committed to his boss? Because Rick is an amazing C.E.O., And I won't let anyone disrespect him or our relationship.",
        "Othello: Spoken like the first lady of Forrester Creations.",
        "Maya: Mm, at least someone knows what's going on.",
        "Caroline: These are really beautiful.",
        "Ivy: Thanks. Look, um, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Th-this -- it's just -- it's weird. You're happy. Sorry, that came out wrong.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Ivy: No, I'm -- I'm happy that you're happy. It's just the last time I saw you, you were kind of a wreck, so what's changed?",
        "Caroline: I guess I have. You know... I gave so much of myself trying to save my marriage that I-I really just lost sight of who I was and -- and how much I have to offer.",
        "Ivy: Hey, good for you.",
        "Caroline: And then... someone was able to look inside me and -- and remind me how beautiful and strong I am.",
        "Ivy: Someone? Someone meaning Ridge? Oh, my go-- oh, my gosh. So, wh-what, what? What does this mean? Are you and Ridge, like --",
        "Caroline: No, we're taking it slow. We're taking it very slow.",
        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Caroline: But, yeah. Ridge and me.",
        "Rick: I'm C.E.O. I asked my lead designer for his designs. This is not an unreasonable request.",
        "Ridge: You know this isn't about business.",
        "Rick: We have deadlines here, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Uh-huh.",
        "Rick: Yours were due this morning.",
        "Ridge: You're standing here with that pompous smile on your face. What are you doing? You're supposed to lead this company, but what -- you're just disrespecting everybody.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] You want to talk about disrespect?",
        "Ridge: You moved this woman into my father's house. You -- you take down my mother's picture and hang hers up? What is that?!",
        "Rick: All right, her name is Maya. I live in that house, and I can do whatever I please.",
        "Ridge: You're disrespecting my mother and my father.",
        "Rick: He's not your father, and she, Stephanie, is not my mother. You want that portrait, do you? Go get it out of the garage.",
        "Ridge: No. You know, you -- you -- you're an arrogant child. That's what you are. How do you even look at yourself in the mirror in the morning?",
        "Maya: How can someone who has caused so much pain be so self-righteous? Rick is your boss now. And if you can't leave your personal baggage at the door, then maybe you should go design somewhere else.",
        "Caroline: So, this whole thing with Ridge -- it's -- it's new, and -- and delicate, so...",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah. My lips are sealed. [Chuckles]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nicole: Excuse me. Could you help me? I'm looking for Maya Avant.",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah. Uh, Pam, our receptionist, must be at lunch. Did you have an appointment?",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] I don't think I need an appointment to see my own sister. I'm Nicole Avant, Maya's little sister.",
        "Othello: How are you cool with all this? [Chuckles] Your ex talking about the love of her life?",
        "Carter: It is what it is, man. I just wish she would dial it back. You know, she acts like Rick is some wounded bird who needs to be nursed back to health.",
        "Othello: You'd be surprised. I've known Rick for so many years. Snowboarding back together in aspen, he was that kid that had everything imaginable. But he actually -- he didn't have it easy. Stephanie -- Stephanie had such a strong hold over this whole family that Rick was just a reminder to her of Eric's relationship with Brooke. He's Eric's blood, but Rick has always just felt like the bastard. But now, he finally has someone who he knows has his back thanks to Maya. Ridge better be careful.",
        "Maya: I see right through you, Ridge Forrester. Magnificent designer, collector of beautiful women, but that's not who you really are, is it? You hurt people. And Rick has been on the receiving end of that his entire life. You broke his mother, and now you've destroyed his marriage, so if you can't respect him as a brother, respect him as a boss or get out. Find some other place and some other C.E.O.'s wife to help you draw.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Carter: Whoa, hey! Hey, hey!",
        "Ridge: Hi.",
        "Carter: You all right?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] No, I'm not all right.",
        "Carter: Hey, Ridge. You need to chill, man. What's going on?",
        "Ridge: He's deceived me, he's deceived my father, he's deceived everyone. If he thinks I'm just gonna fall in line, it's not gonna happen.",
        "Maya: You okay?",
        "Rick: I'm fine.",
        "Maya: You don't have to hide your feelings from me. Not me. Not ever. And no one has the right to talk to you like that. I-I'm sorry if I overstepped my bounds, but --",
        "Rick: No, no. Thank you. No one has ever done that. No one's ever done that for me in my entire life.",
        "Maya: I'm here for you totally and completely. It's a brand-new day, Rick. Eric and Stephanie laid the foundation here, but the future is up to you.",
        "Rick: No. It's up to us."
