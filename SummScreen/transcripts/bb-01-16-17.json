{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7500 ~ Quinn calls Ridge out on his manipulative scheme to make her look bad to Eric; Katie is not shy with her words about Eric's plan to reunite Steffy & Wyatt."], "Recap": ["Quinn cannot believe Ridge would ever think she would fall in bed with him. He agrees he would do anything even to harm himself to get her out of his life. She says he is charming but this time he got caught. He won't get out of this. Katie listens as Eric explains that by sending Ridge and Quinn off together maybe they would quit hating each other's guts. Wyatt says Katie has known Steffy longer than he has so he wants to hear her opinion of Steffy staying with him over Liam. Liam tells Steffy that he understands she wants to wait before living together but he also knows these alliances between Quinn, Ridge and Wyatt can be overturned ever so easily. Quinn quips that Ridge thought he could seduce her. He says maybe not this time but who knows tomorrow. She says she knows some things about him, like he thinks he is special and wants people like herself to beg him. But those blinds are closed and no one sees inside. Katie tells Wyatt that she does not want to hurt him, but Quinn kidnapped Liam while he was impaired and then she was responsible for Wyatt marrying Steffy. He cannot just overlook and forget that. Steffy laments to Liam that it won't always be this way with Wyatt and Quinn in their lives.", "Quinn tells Ridge that it is amazing that he is made of the same stuff as his father. She wants him to take the key card and go to the other suite. She laughs that poor Thorne cannot get out of Ridge's shadow no matter what he does. Wyatt says he does not think of himself as a loser just because he thought his marriage was real and now Steffy is turning him down. Ridge tells Quinn that she wants his father and to take his mother's place. She is a control freak. She asks when is the time he ever wanted anything and then his roving eye looks toward something else. He said all he was going to do was take a picture to send to his dad. She says sure, and it had to be sexual. That is the way men win and women always lose. Sometimes they just want lunch or cab fare. He does that time and time again, always getting what he wants. But now it is her turn to say it is time for him to go."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Quinn: I can't believe you thought I would fall into bed with you.", "Ridge: I will do whatever I have to to keep you away from my dad.

From the --", "Eric: Yeah, that everything's going all right. It was really good on the stage, Ridge said some nice things. Yeah.", "Wyatt: [Scoffs] How long you think that's gonna last?", "Eric: [Laughs] We'll see.", "Wyatt: You know what I just realized? It's just you and me tonight. You know what I'm thinking...", "Eric: Uh, review the security footage? See if there's any raccoons outside?", "Wyatt: You really do that?", "Eric: [Laughing] No.", "Wyatt: No, I'm talking bachelor party, dude! Break out the brews, bring on the women!", "Eric: No, aren't you forgetting something, though?", "Wyatt: Chips and salsa?", "Eric: Um...", "Wyatt: Hmm?", "Eric: Neither one of us is a bachelor.", "Wyatt: Right. [Laughs] Maybe not. Sure feels like my marriage is only missing one or two more nails in that coffin. [Clears throat]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Come home with me tonight.", "Steffy: Liam...", "Liam: You know you want to.", "Steffy: The decision's been made, and I know we both hate it...", "Liam: Just for tonight. Not a big packing project. Just tonight. Just tonight.", "Steffy: I can't say one thing and do another, okay? Yeah, Quinn's out of town, but Wyatt's still here, and I don't want to do that to him.", "Liam: Well...you never know. Quinn could come home with a whole new attitude.", "Steffy: Is it time for Quinn to become a brand-new person yet again?", "Liam: I mean, she's in san Francisco. It's a magical city. She could fall under its spell. She could think better of coming home at all.", "Steffy: As much as I want to come home with you...", "Liam: [Sighs]", "Steffy: Until the divorce is final, this is where I'm sleeping.", "Liam: Okay. Okay. You know something, you never used to be such a stickler. I'm just saying.", "Steffy: I'm -- I'm thinking about Wyatt's feelings. Why aren't you?", "Liam: You want the long version or the short version?", "Steffy: [Sighs] Okay, fine. Fine. You don't agree. I'm just asking you to respect my decision.", "Liam: And I'm asking you -- are you sure it's even your decision?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Your mother's convinced that Steffy's gonna change her mind before the waiting period's over.", "Wyatt: My mother's been convinced of a great many things over the years.", "[Knocks on door]", "Wyatt: You should ask her to show you what she bought to protect us from the collapse of civilization for y2k.", "Eric: [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: [Clears throat]", "Katie: Hi!", "Wyatt: Hey, our neighbor from next door!", "Eric: Hello!", "Katie: Is it too late to come by?", "Wyatt: No, no, I just got done with work, and you know Eric, he's a party animal.", "Katie: I've heard.", "Eric: What is that?", "Katie: [Laughs] Will was playing down by the property line and he found this, and I figured it might belong to someone in your family.", "Eric: [Laughs] Look, it is ours -- it's got RF on it! This has been there for like 35 years!", "Katie: Yeah, used to be ridge's, I guess.", "Eric: Yeah! Oh, wait till Ridge and Quinn get back from san Francisco.", "Katie: I'm sorry, what? What was that?", "Wyatt: The design conference up north.", "Eric: It seems it's already done wonders for their relationship.", "Katie: [Chuckling] Huh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: You realize that life as you know it is over, right? Because Eric is gonna strip you of everything that goes with the Forrester name.", "Ridge: No, Quinn. You're so silly. You don't really believe that, do you?", "Quinn: Oh, Ridge. You're so charming. But you got caught. You're not gonna charm your way out of this one.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: So, you thought that by sending Ridge and Quinn to the design symposium, they would stop, um, hating each other's guts?", "[Laughter]", "Eric: Well, is it really that far-fetched?", "Katie: Uh... [Laughs]", "Eric: Well, Quinn has the ability to unite people.", "Wyatt: Yeah, unite 'em all against her, maybe. [Laughing] Come on.", "Katie: Oh, did you get a new painting?", "Wyatt: Yeah, uh, turned out to be a little premature, though.", "Katie: Uh, can I take a look?", "Eric: Sure.", "Katie: [Gasps] Does she always have to look so beautiful?", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Well, Eric was thinking of a future day where that portrait would hang where her grandmother's was.", "Eric: A day when she might live here with her family, with her husband and her children.", "Katie: With Liam?", "Wyatt: I'm still her husband, Katie.", "Eric: I invited her to come live here with us.", "Katie: [Scoffs]", "Eric: I see you have an opinion about that.", "Wyatt: I want to hear it. You've known Steffy a lot longer than I have, so let's hear it.", "Katie: Well, I just don't think it's smart to pressure her into anything.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Listen, they teamed up and they did a number on you, Steffy, dangling the prospect of being Eric's heir apparent, only if -- only if you stay married to Wyatt.", "Steffy: No --", "Liam: That is messed up.", "Steffy: It wasn't like that, and I said no.", "Liam: Steffy, you can't tell me that the idea of you being chosen over your father, over rick, over everyone else, doesn't wield some power for you.", "Steffy: Liam, why did we have to pick tonight to just rehash all of this? Why?", "Liam: [Sighs] I don't know. Partly because I miss you. And partly because I know that these allegiances between Eric, Wyatt, and Quinn can fall apart just as suddenly as they were formed.", "Steffy: What makes you say that?", "Liam: Just a feeling.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: You want me to freshen that up for you? There you go. The whole idea was to get me drunk, right? I mean, this little cat-and-mouse game you got going -- you realize it's over, right?", "Ridge: I think we both know you better than that.", "Quinn: [Scoffs] That's -- that's almost comical, considering how wrong you have me.", "Ridge: Do I? Maybe I do. Maybe you're not the scheming black widow that I thought you were. Maybe you're just this insatiable black hole of need. All you needed was for me to flirt with you for a little while, and those big eyes are staring back at me.", "Quinn: Okay. Come on. Come on, rich boy. Seduce who you think I am because that was the whole idea, right?", "Ridge: You know, I don't think I have it in me. And yes, maybe you're smarter than I thought you were.", "Quinn: [Scoffs]", "Ridge: You caught me this time.", "Quinn: \"This time.\" Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think there's gonna be a next time?", "Ridge: Of course there's gonna be a next time! Because whatever you hate today, you're gonna love tomorrow. That's how you roll.", "Quinn: Oh, man, see, you -- you remind me of a shrink I once knew.", "Ridge: You had a shrink? You tried mental health? Why would you stop?", "Quinn: Oh, you know what, see, 'cause the thing is this -- people tell you all the time that you need help. [Laughs] So you either tell them to go to hell or you give it a try. And I learned a lot. I learned a lot from this guy. But here's the one thing that, um...that I took away more than anything else. Nobody knows anything about anyone.", "Ridge: I can see that.", "Quinn: Yeah, well -- caveat, because that being said, there's a couple things that I know about you. You are just like everyone else. You don't want me to have anything. You want me to know my place. You want me to beg. \"Love me! Oh, love me! See how special I am.\" Mnh-mnh. No. No, those -- those blinds are drawn. Nobody gets to see inside.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Steffy feels like she's been injured, and... rightly so. She's not ready to forgive and forget. I mean, has she said anything like that?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: How have Wyatt and I hurt Steffy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Katie: [Sighs] I -- I shouldn't be talking about this.", "Wyatt: No, no, something you're saying sounds right, so come on. I want to hear it.", "Katie: Okay, well, to be blunt and honest, your mother and your wife pretty much kidnapped Liam when he was mentally impaired and fed him this story that wasn't true and -- and you wouldn't be married to Steffy if Quinn hadn't interfered. And I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm not. I -- I know how much you love her, and I think that she loves you, too, and that your marriage was real, but -- you can't ignore her loss. I'm sure she feels like a part of her life has been hijacked, and she can't just forget about that. It's not fair.", "Wyatt: There's enough unfairness to go around. Trust me.", "Katie: I know.", "Wyatt: But you're not wrong about where it started.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Just thought I felt it vibrate.", "Steffy: Expecting a message?", "Liam: Uh, just working on something remotely.", "Steffy: Well, should you go, then?", "Liam: I don't know. Should I?", "Steffy: Eventually. But I don't want you to move. Mmm. [Chuckles] Hey, I want you know that, um... this -- it won't always be between us.", "Liam: What?", "Steffy: What Quinn did and that I was married to your brother.", "Liam: Oh.", "Steffy: Yeah.", "Liam: Yeah, I -- I know. I mean, I suppose it'll always be a part of us, but... not between us, no. Boy, this thing sure is hanging on, isn't it?", "Steffy: [Sighs] Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'll just cut this finger off, but then I'll have to cut this one off, and then it'll more symmetrical.", "Liam: No, no, no, no. I need all your parts. Just have to, um, find a ring big enough to cover up what's left.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Either give me that other key card, or just go to the other suite and go sleep it off.", "Ridge: No. I might miss something.", "Quinn: Nothing's going to happen.", "Ridge: But what if all of a sudden you're overcome with desire for me?", "Quinn: Oh, God. It's -- it's amazing to think that you're made of the same stuff as your father.", "Ridge: I'm not. Not at all. And this usually only comes up in heated conversation, but... the stuff I'm made of is... an Italian blowhard billionaire. Only I wasn't adopted. I was passed off as the real thing. So I'M...what do you call that? I'm an imitation Forrester.", "Quinn: Men think where their DNA comes from and where it goes is so...terribly important. See, I actually -- I knew about the accident of your birth. But it's easy to forget, since you've made yourself over into the definition of what a Forrester is. [Scoffs] Poor Thorne is biologically the real deal, but he can't get out from under your shadow. That's how you got your revenge, isn't it? I mean, you made them all over in your own image, not the other way around.", "Ridge: Now, you grew up without a father, didn't you?", "Quinn: Says who?", "Ridge: You can't have mine.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: And I'm not saying I'm a sore loser.", "Katie: Well, getting a divorce doesn't make you a loser.", "Wyatt: Well, it does in the literal sense, if you don't get what you want. But just asking Steffy to move in with us, into her family's home, and then get shot down like that? It -- that stung.", "Eric: She didn't say never.", "Wyatt: She basically did, Eric. I mean, come on. [Scoffs] I've -- I didn't kidnap him! I felt that our marriage was real.", "Katie: The feelings were real.", "Wyatt: Exactly. But luckily I had a true-blue friend to cheer me up -- Mr. Tequila!", "Katie: I've heard that drinking alone is not always a great idea.", "Wyatt: Yeah. Well, anything you do with your mother's wholesome, right? I re- introduced her to Mr. Tequila. It got her to open up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "Ridge: You want my father. You want our name. You want our money, our position. You want to take my mother's place. And you want my daughter and her future.", "Quinn: She made vows.", "Ridge: Under false pretenses.", "Quinn: My son deserves to be happy.", "Ridge: Then let him figure it out! Don't be such a control freak. You can't hand somebody happiness! The same way you can't hand them health.", "Quinn: It's so easy for the one who has all the money and all the power to call me greedy and a control freak. When have you ever wanted for anything? You just take whatever you want. Whatever you see, snap your fingers and you have it. And then when you're done with that, your roving eye looks to see what you want a taste of next. Is that -- is that what it was gonna be with me? I mean, once I realized... \"he's not so bad. He just needs to be loved.\"", "Ridge: No, it wasn't gonna be that.", "Quinn: [Scoffs] Liar.", "Ridge: I was gonna take a picture. Nothing crazy. I was gonna send it to my dad, to show him how wrong he is about you.", "Quinn: Wow. You don't care who you hurt. Even if it's you. And, of course... it had to be sexual. Because that's how men win and women lose. We lose if we love it, we lose if we hate it. We lose if we say yes just a little bit too soon, right? And what does it matter anyway? I mean, it's rarely more pleasurable than a hot shower, and it barely lasts as long. But that's the only game that men want to play because we always lose. Especially if we want... just a little bit more. Like lunch, right? Or cab fare or...or kindness. Because it's fun for you, right? It's fun to hold those little things from us. But you don't win big until you realize how I hurt and how I don't want be alone. That's when you get to sit back and go \"yeah! I-I got her, I used her for everything she was good for.\" You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're Ridge Forrester. You're the ultimate womanizer. You get together with women so you can do that, so you can get them into bed and make them a conquest, and then you just get to drop them! I've been that woman! So -- don't. Don't you sit there in judgment of me! Of who I am, where I've come from, and what I've had to endure! Because you -- you can go to hell, Ridge Forrester, if hell will have you, because I won't! And now...you can go."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoT_zJM_D0A"}
