        "Taylor: \r\nI'm fighting for us, ridge. For our children, for our family. I don't want us to \r\nlose what we have. ",
        "Ridge: Had. What we had, \r\nTaylor. ",
        "Taylor: Are you're saying \r\n-- you don't love me anymore? Is that what you're telling me? ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************",
        "[Knocking on door]\r\n",
        "Hector: Stephanie? \n",
        "Stephanie: Hector, stay \r\naway from her. ",
        "Hector: What? ",
        "Stephanie: I don't want \r\nyou to see Taylor again. ",
        "Hector: I don't know if I \r\ncan do that. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yes, you \r\ncan. And you will. Or, I promise you, you'll regret it. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************",
        "Brooke: So you want me to \r\npromise -- ",
        "Nick: If ridge and Taylor \r\nsplit, you can't go back to him. The thought of you and him together again --\r\n",
        "Brooke: Nick -- \n",
        "Nick: No, it just tears me \r\nup inside. I can't stand it. Because the same thing is going to happen. The same \r\nthing that always happens -- this weird, vicious cycle you have with this man. I \r\nmean it -- do not give him a chance. Do not let him back in your life. \n",
        "Ridge: It's not a question \r\nof love. It's a question of character. ",
        "Taylor: You still feel I'm \r\na hypocrite toward Brooke? ",
        "Ridge: Taylor -- when you \r\ncame back, I felt like all my prayers had been answered. That night in the \r\ncemetery -- to hold you, to look into that beautiful face again after all that \r\ntime -- I felt like we were the only two people in the world. The reality is, we \r\nweren't the only two people. I'd moved on with Brooke. She and I had built a \r\nlife, a family, a future together. That didn't mean I loved you any less. I will \r\nalways love you. Your intelligence, your compassion, your sensitivity -- you \r\nunderstood me like no woman ever had, or ever will. It's not even to mention how \r\nright you were about all the things that I just didn't want to see. But I see \r\nthem now. And what I see is how right you were about my feelings for Brooke. I \r\ntold you that I had put her behind me. But the truth is -- I haven't. \n",
        "Brooke: Ridge and Taylor \r\nare having a crisis in their marriage, and suddenly you're seeing me with Ridge \r\nagain? Promise me -- promise me you won't let him back in your life. Promise me, \r\nno matter what happens, what he says, what he does, you won't let him -- \n",
        "Brooke: Nick, stop. You \r\ndon't have to worry. I'm not going back to Ridge. I can't. And you know why.\r\n",
        "\r\n*****************************************************",
        "Hector: You don't run my \r\nlife, Stephanie. ",
        "Stephanie: I'm trying to \r\nsave their marriage. ",
        "Hector: You're blaming \r\nRidge and Taylor's problems on me? ",
        "Stephanie: Hector, she was \r\nvulnerable, and you took advantage of it. ",
        "Hector: No, what I did was \r\nto help her come to terms with who she is and what she deserves. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you call \r\nthis helping? ",
        "Hector: You don't think \r\nthey need it? ",
        "Stephanie: Not from you. \r\nHector, she's in love with her husband. They have children, they're a family. If \r\nyou continue to interfere -- look -- just stay away. Or else. ",
        "\r\n***************************************************",
        "Taylor: I don't \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Ridge: I'm so sorry, doc. \r\nI wanted this to work. But our marriage hasn't been working. I think we need to \r\nreally look at the reason why -- the real reason. I'm still in love with Brooke. \r\nI know that can't be easy for you to hear. It can't come as a complete shock, \r\neither. I mean, you knew there were feelings. That's why we went to counseling.\r\n",
        "Taylor: You told the \r\ntherapist -- you said -- ",
        "Ridge: I know, I know. I \r\nknow. At the time, I thought I was being honest -- with you, with myself. But \r\nnow -- ",
        "Taylor: So, it's been \r\nBrooke all along? You told me you would love me forever. No. No. No, ridge, \r\nwhatever you feel for Brooke, it's not real. Whatever it is, it's just -- it's \r\nnot. Your life is with me! It's with our family! ",
        "Ridge: I have a family \r\nwith Brooke, too. ",
        "Taylor: You're my husband. \r\nYou renewed your vows to me, Ridge! ",
        "Ridge: At my mother's \r\ndeathbed. Or so we all thought. Taylor, I didn't want to hurt you. I didn't want \r\nto hurt you then any more than I want to hurt you now. But I was so overwhelmed \r\nby your return that I couldn't even think straight. Taylor, time didn't stop \r\nwhen you went away. My life didn't stop. I mourned you -- I kept your memory \r\nclose to my heart. But eventually -- eventually, I found happiness again -- with \r\na hell of a lot of Brooke's help. And that happiness only intensified with the \r\nbirth of our son, R.J. That's what you came back to. That's what I put on hold, \r\ntrying to pick up where you and I had left off. But that wasn't possible. It \r\njust wasn't going to happen. I can admit that now -- to myself, and to you. \r\nBecause I've finally realized -- that being with R.J. and Brooke is where I need \r\nto be. ",
        "Ridge: We have to help \r\nThomas and the girls understand -- ",
        "Taylor: We're not telling \r\nthe children anything. ",
        "Ridge: I know you want to \r\nprotect them. So do I. But I think, on some level, they probably already know. \r\nThey lived with Brooke and me, they saw the love that we shared -- ",
        "Taylor: Stop it, Ridge!\r\n",
        "Ridge: Taylor, we'll help \r\nthem get through this. ",
        "Taylor: Stop it! We are \r\nnot going to give up on this marriage! I love you. I need you! Yes, what I did \r\nwas wrong. Be angry with me, but don't end this marriage. Don't do that to us. \r\nDon't do that to our children! Dear god, please, don't let it be over! Oh, god.\r\n",
        "\r\n****************************************************",
        "Nick: Doesn't seem to get \r\nany easier, does it? ",
        "Brooke: I'm okay. I can't \r\nalways follow my heart. I've learned that the hard way. Ridge is always going to \r\nbe a father to my son. He's always going to be a very important part in my life. \r\nBut am I ever going to love him again? Or anybody else, for that matter? No. Not \r\nwhen I'm -- you and I are committed to the life that you have with Bridget.\r\n",
        "Nick: Yes, we are. \n",
        "Brooke: Because she \r\ndeserves much happiness. ",
        "Nick: Yes, she does. And \r\nshe's going to have it. But don't you deserve to be happy, too? Don't you?\r\n",
        "Brooke: I had happiness, \r\nfor one very brief, magical moment right here on this boat. When I think of the \r\ntime that we spent together, there was this level of comfort, this connection -- \r\nand all of my insecurities were gone. But with you, Nick, there was just peace. \r\nYou treated me with respect. You honored me with your love. And even though we \r\ncan't be together -- I will never forget that -- ever. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, I'm sorry.\r\n",
        "Nick: You don't have to be \r\nsorry about anything. You know you can say whatever you want to me. You can \r\nalways depend on me. Because I will always -- I will never stop wanting -- \r\nwhat's best for you. And Forrester is not what's best for you. ",
        "Brooke: So you don't think \r\nhe's good enough, huh? ",
        "Nick: I don't think \r\nanybody's good enough for you. But that doesn't mean he's going to stop from \r\ntrying to convince you that he is. ",
        "Brooke: Nick, I told you \r\n-- but then ridge did say he was going to meet Taylor up in big bear. Maybe he's \r\nplanning on ending his marriage with her in hopes that he and I would -- oh, my \r\ngod. ",
        "Nick: What are you doing?\r\n",
        "Brooke: Calling Ridge. Oh, \r\nit's just the voice mail. Damn it! Ridge, hi. It's me, Brooke. Look, I know \r\nyou're going to talk to Taylor, but I'm afraid of what you're planning on \r\ntelling her -- for many reasons. Please, don't end your marriage to Taylor. \r\nDon't do it. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************",
        "Ridge: I think we've both \r\nbeen running from the truth for a long while now. Me in Europe -- you with \r\nHector. Those are both just symptoms of a much deeper problem in our marriage, \r\nDoc. One I didn't realize -- it's killing me, what this is doing to you. Knowing \r\nthat all you wanted, all you really wanted was to save us. But that \"us\" -- the \r\ntruth is, that \"us\" changed forever when that crazy woman pulled that trigger \r\nand took you away from me. She ripped you away from me, and threw my life into \r\nshambles. That \"us,\" we can never get back. ",
        "Taylor: Because of \r\neverything Brooke came to mean to you when I was away. ",
        "Ridge: I know it's unfair. \r\nYou're the one that lost all those years. You came back expecting everything to \r\njust be the same. And I wanted to give that to you. I wanted to give that to our \r\nkids. So I thanked god for everything that he's given us. I tried to find some \r\nway to make it all work -- to be \"us\" again. But it wasn't just you and me, \r\nTaylor, and our children. It was Brooke and R.J -- and this incredible pull \r\ninside me that's just gotten stronger. My little boy needs me, Doc. R.J. needs \r\nhis daddy the same way Thomas did when he was R.J.'s age. ",
        "Taylor: But it isn't just \r\nR.J. You need Brooke. ",
        "Ridge: When you married \r\nme, you made me want to be a better person. You taught me the most important \r\nthings in life were family, a home filled with love. And I hope there's some \r\nway, somehow you can forgive me someday. Because I will always love you. But I \r\ncan't do this. I can't be your husband anymore. I'm so sorry, Doc. I'm so \r\nincredibly sorry. "
