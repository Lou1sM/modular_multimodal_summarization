        "Katie shows up unexpectedly at Brooke's. She tells her that Bill visited her at her office and wants her back. Brooke tells her she is happy for her. This is what Katie wanted. Katie seems to feel that Bill's words came straight from Brooke. Brooke says Bill takes orders from no one. Katie says she knows he was lying. She can't believe Brooke would want that for her. Brooke argues that she just wants Katie to be happy with a man that she loves and married. Katie adds \"and wants you.\" Ridge sketches and Caroline comes in and thinks it is grand. Rick asks Ridge if he is the reason that his mom is not coming in to work much anymore. Ridge answers that he doesn't think so but Rick needs to ask her. He's talked to her a few times. Rick says he always thought actions speak louder than words. Before they finish they are interrupted by Bill who opens the door and waltzes in. He says he is a major shareholder so just protecting his interest every now and then. He makes sure that Rick is treating Caroline right and she says he is. Bill then says he actually came to see Ridge, so Caroline senses they may need some alone time and she spirits Rick out of the office. Bill tells Ridge they make the best croissants in Paris and if he hurries he can make the last flight there. Ridge says he can't help but wonder why his place of residence is any concern of Bill's. And Bill says he can't help but wonder why Ridge can't put down that little pencil and look him in the eye. Ridge lays the pencil down and looks right at Bill and declares that Bill hasn't given up yet on Brooke. Bill says that is a personality trait of his for sure. And Ridge is not being an obstacle but more like a tease or a spoiler. And then he sniffs the air and turns up his nose and wants to know what that smell is. Oh yeah, it's that stench of Ridge's superiority that comes off of him that everyone around him is defective. So if he's going back to Paris he is just suggesting he speed that process along. Ridge says he lost him somewhere in that last statement. Ridge says so Brooke is done with Bill. This conversation has nothing to do with Ridge but is all about Bill. Brooke wants Bill to go back to Katie. He announces he is busy and jumps up.",
        "Bill continues and Ridge cuts him off again and tells him that he misunderestimates just how repulsive he is and what he stands for. Ridge shakes his head and says Bill's hands on his wife, that keeps him up at night. Bill says due to the very sensitive nature of Ridge but he was not there, so he does not know how it went down between him and Brooke. Ridge says then there is nothing more to say, because if Bill thinks there is a certain set of circumstances where it is justified that he dumps his sick wife and sleeps with her sister then they are not on the same planet. Bill tells Ridge to whoa and back up. He wants to know if this is the same self-righteous high horse that he was riding a year and a half ago when he dumped his wife on their honeymoon over a text. He says he went to Katie and tried to repair the damage and return to his family. He thinks that is more than Ridge has tried to do to repair his. Bill asks Ridge if he has slept with Brooke yet. Ridge doesn't answer. Bill goads him that it's all right. They are just two guys talking. Ridge still doesn't answer, he just glares. Bill smirks and says he didn't think so or Ridge wouldn't be here playing this coy little game; he'd be gloating. Ridge says Bill knows him too well. Bill reminds him that Ridge couldn't bear to touch what he had touched. He can't believe that Ridge would walk away from a woman like that over little old him. This is a whole new power that even he didn't know he had. Ridge says they need to review. Katie doesn't trust him and probably never will. Brooke knows what she wants and that doesn't include Bill. And now he is sleeping on his son's couch. He's the poorest rich man he knows. Bill tells him to go, stay, Paris, Timbuktu, he really doesn't care. He even says that he is not immune to looking down on people and the pleasures of that, but boy Ridge has elevated that to an art form. He's just too good for this world. The rest of them have dirty hands and that will not do. As Bill leaves Ridge's office, Ridge says he thinks Bill should stay away from both women. Caroline leads Rick to the steam room where he laughs that it has certainly seen plenty of action. Katie tells Brooke that maybe she should just take her bitter pill and take Bill back just like Ridge is trying to do with her. But she cannot do that as he lied to her .and to Brooke. She wishes she could just wish that old feeling back, but she's not Brooke. She's so secure and falls in and out of love so easily. And if one doesn't work out, it is okay as she knows there is another just around the corner. She cannot love like Brooke. For the longest time Bill was the one, the love of her life but he's lost to her now. She keeps waiting for that man to show up. And she cries that Brooke is lost to her too. She is just trying to move forward in this life that she does not recognize and to make the best life she can in this life that she has left. Crying she runs out with Brooke unable to stop her. Katie runs right into the arms of Ridge who is walking up on the pavement."

        "Ridge: Women like to feel daring and desired. It never changes.",
        "Rick: I don't mind being a captive audience for your design philosophies, Plato. [Chuckles] I mean, Ridge. You're not thinking about poaching Caroline from Hope for the Future, are you?",
        "Caroline: Oh, no, I was just looking over his shoulder.",
        "Ridge: Unless she wants to be a little more hands-on. Is that what you want?",

        "Caroline: I am working with Rick, and I'm proud of all of our accomplishments.",
        "Rick: You know, Ridge works with me, too. Somehow he easily forgets. Speaking of people that work with us, are you the reason my mom hasn't been coming around here?",
        "Ridge: I don't think so. You'd have to ask Brooke.",
        "Rick: You know how long she's been waiting for you to come home?",

        "Rick: So, what's the problem?",

        "Ridge: You're part of the family now. Sink or swim. I'm talking to your mom.",
        "Rick: Talking? That's it? It's always been my assumption that actions speak louder than words.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Bill: Your receptionists are a joke. \"Hi, Bill. How you doing?\" Well, good. Thanks. How are things going here at Forrester Creations? Well, I hope I'm not interrupting the flow of your creative process.",
        "Ridge: No, you're not.",
        "Bill: Hmm. So, tell me, when you -- cover your ears. So, when you were a kid, teacher wasn't looking, did you ever draw dirty pictures, just between you and me?",
        "Caroline: Uncle Bill! Were you looking for me?",
        "Bill: Well, I do own part of Forrester Creations, so, um, just checking on my investment.",

        "Bill: Well, even funnier, it's always true.",
        "Rick: I know. It's funny.",
        "Bill: So, tell me. This guy over here -- is he treating you the way a newlywed husband should be?",
        "Caroline: I wake up every morning thinking no one should ever be as happy as I am.",
        "Bill: Good. I'm glad to hear that. Now, as it happens, I was, uh, looking for someone. And I found him.",
        "Rick: Well, you could borrow Ridge if you two want to go out for a coffee and croissants.",
        "Ridge: I'm kind of comfy here, thank you.",

        "Rick: Sure.",

        "Bill: I love that girl. Speaks her mind. As opposed to her mother, who is a passive-aggressive mess.",
        "Ridge: What can I do for you, Bill?",
        "Bill: Do you know where you can find the best croissants? Paris.",
        "Ridge: I agree.",
        "Bill: Good. So, if you hurry, uh, yeah, you can make the last flight there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I had a visitor at the office. Do you know who it was?",
        "Brooke: I'm sure you get lots of those.",
        "Katie: It was Bill.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Well, that couldn't have come as too much of a surprise.",
        "Katie: Do you know why he was there? He said he wanted me back.",
        "Brooke: I told you that would happen.",
        "Katie: Did you put those words in his mouth?",
        "Brooke: You think I have that kind of power?",
        "Katie: Yes. Was he on an errand from you?",
        "Brooke: Bill does what he wants to do. He doesn't take orders from anybody.",
        "Katie: So, this is the first you've heard of it?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Yeah, that's what I thought.",
        "Brooke: I've been really consistent with Bill. He knows that I believe that his place is with you and his family.",
        "Katie: But he doesn't believe that, does he?",
        "Brooke: Katie, if he came to you and told you that he wanted to be with you, then you should listen.",
        "Katie: Who was he trying to convince? Was he making me an offer that he knew I would refuse to score points with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: You need to relax.",

        "Caroline: Will you look at the sacrifice that I'm making?",
        "Rick: I'm looking. I don't see any sacrifice.",
        "Caroline: My hair! It's gonna be a disaster the whole rest of the day! But I am willing to look like a drowned rat for you.",
        "Rick: You couldn't look bad if you wanted to.",
        "Caroline: What's that? I'm sorry. The steam -- I couldn't hear.",
        "Rick: [Loudly] I said that you couldn't look bad if you wanted to.",
        "Caroline: I'm sorry. What?",
        "Rick: [Louder] I said --",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: You know, I don't know why people don't use the steam room more often.",
        "Rick: Oh, trust me, it's, uh, it's seen plenty of action.",
        "Caroline: Did you used to bring what's-her-name down here?",
        "Rick: Maya? No.",
        "Caroline: No, not her. The other one.",
        "Rick: Which one?",
        "Caroline: How many other ones are there? [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: I thought this was supposed to be relaxing.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So, I find myself wondering.",
        "Bill: Let it out. Wonder aloud.",
        "Ridge: Why my place of residence would be any concern of yours.",
        "Bill: I find myself wondering why you can't put down your little pencil and look me in the eye.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] You haven't given up, have you?",
        "Bill: Well, that is a personality trait of mine. On what?",
        "Ridge: On Brooke. I'm not sure what else I would be an obstacle to.",
        "Bill: No, you're not an obstacle. You're a... a tease, a-a spoiler, a... [Sniffs] What is that smell? Oh. That's your stink of superiority. Your condescension rises off you like -- like a fog, and it's -- its oh-so terribly sad, because, you see everyone around you as defective. So, off you go to Paris. I'm simply suggesting that you speed that process along.",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. You lost me in the middle there. So, Brooke is done with you. Was a terrible lapse of judgment? So, really, this has nothing to do with me. It has everything to do with you. She wants you to go back to your wife. You agree with that, right?",
        "Bill: You need to leave her alone.",
        "Ridge: I'm busy.",
        "Bill: What is your deal? Is it just a sadistic tendency? You like to watch Brooke beg, you like making girls cry -- that kind of get you off?",
        "Ridge: My deal, Bill, is I thought I was coming back to a life that I remembered.",
        "Bill: Well, then, why don't you go for it? You just told me that she's done with me, right? Say the word. She'll shower you with rose petals.",
        "Ridge: You know what I think? I think you underestimate how repulsive a person you are, and everything you stand for. And your hands on my wife... that keeps me up at night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: What is wrong with me reminding Bill of what he owes you and your child?",
        "Katie: Nothing. Nothing. I should just learn how to trust my instincts, that's all.",
        "Brooke: About what?",
        "Katie: About now, about Bill, about all of this. I knew he was lying.",
        "Brooke: Oh, come on, Katie. He knows what he did was wrong. He's trying to make it right.",
        "Katie: Wrong is not part of Bill's world view, and you know it. Let me guess. Did he say, \"Well, Katie won't take me back. I went to her. I tried. She's impossible\"?",
        "Brooke: I talked to him, if that's what you're asking.",
        "Katie: And did it proceed from there to \"Brooke, you're the love of my life. Katie's not having it. We can't go back\"? And what did you say?",
        "Brooke: I just told him he shouldn't be here. I-I told him never to come here.",
        "Katie: Did you tell him to try harder, that I would take him back eventually? Brooke, is that really what you want from me?",
        "Brooke: I want you to be happy and be with the man that you fell in love with, the man that you married.",
        "Katie: A man who wants you!",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Okay. I... I-I just want to do the right thing.",
        "Katie: I believe you. And the funny thing is... so do I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: It's working.",
        "Caroline: What is?",
        "Rick: You dragging me here against my will.",
        "Caroline: [Giggles] You know, I know that you get exasperated on occasion, but... I really do think that you're handling it well, Ridge being back so suddenly.",
        "Rick: You like Ridge, don't you? Damn it. Every woman likes Ridge.",
        "Caroline: No. Everyone likes Ridge.",
        "Rick: I've got some serious resentments about how he treated my mother. Being at his throat all these years has made my mom that much more miserable, so I'm just -- I'm just trying to take a step back, you know, and put it behind me, because I know just how much he means to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I do respect to your very sensitive nature. You weren't there. You have no idea how it went down between Brooke and me.",
        "Ridge: Well, then, there's nothing more to say.",
        "Bill: And why is that?",
        "Ridge: Because if you think that there's a set of circumstances that would justify you dumping your sick wife and sleeping with her sister, we're not on the same planet.",
        "Bill: Let's just put the brakes on, back that up a little bit. Is this the same self-righteous high horse you were riding over a year-and-a-half ago when you dumped your wife on your honeymoon over a text? Now, I went to Katie, and I told her that I wanted to try and fix what we had. Now, I believe that that's more than you have done to try and repair your family, isn't it?",
        "Ridge: Now, that's a high horse.",
        "Bill: Did you sleep with Brooke? Oh, come on, now. You don't have to be shy. We're just a couple of guys talking. I mean, I know you were at the house, 'cause I saw you there. Yeah, I didn't think so. You want me to think that you did, but it -- it didn't happen. If it had, you wouldn't be playing this little coy routine. You'd be gloating.",
        "Ridge: I forgot how well you know me.",
        "Bill: And it wasn't Brooke who said no. I know that, too. It was you. You couldn't bear the thought of touching where I had already touched. Wow! [Chuckles] You would walk away from a woman like that over little, old me. This is a whole-new power that even I didn't know I had.",
        "Ridge: Let's review. Can we do that?",
        "Bill: Sure.",
        "Ridge: Katie doesn't trust you. Probably never will. Brooke knows what she wants. That doesn't include you, either. And now you're sleeping on your boy's couch. You're the poorest rich man I know.",
        "Bill: Or the richest poor man. But, of course, that's just semantics, isn't it? Listen, go, stay, Paris, Timbuktu -- I-I really don't give a damn, because I realize now that it -- it just doesn't matter. You know, I'm not immune to looking down on people, the pleasures of that, but... [Exhales sharply] You elevate that to an art form. You're just too good for this world, aren't you? The rest of us, we just have dirty hands, and that will not do, not for you.",
        "Ridge: You know what I think, Bill? I think you should stay away from both of them.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You really think I should just take Bill back, that I should say, \"Okay, sure, we can reside in the same house, and you can sleep in your bedroom and I can sleep in mine\"? And maybe I should. Maybe I should swallow that bitter pill for my son. Maybe that's how Ridge feels, trying to put the pieces of his life back together with you.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] You loved him, Katie.",
        "Katie: Yes, I did.",
        "Brooke: He used to make you happy.",
        "Katie: Yeah. We were very happy.",
        "Brooke: You had some quarrels, but for the most part, you loved each other. I mean, why can't you find that again?",
        "Katie: Because he lied to me. And to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Hmm. What I want to know is how the steam is not burning us, yet the boiling water would.",
        "Rick: What I want to know is when my dad is gonna fix this situation. I mean, Ridge sails in out of the blue not needed, no one missed him, perches himself at the top of command in his own mind, as if we were just... sleeping in our own separate pods waiting for his return. I'm on this constant collision course with -- with his -- his delusions of grandeur! [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: Would it be too much trouble or possibly in bad taste for me to have a moment of crisis?",
        "Rick: Now?",
        "Caroline: Do we think that getting married ruined everything?",
        "Rick: We don't. Why?",
        "Caroline: Well, I mean, here we are alone... hardly dressed at all, and you don't seem overcome with lust at all.",
        "Rick: I-I totally am.",
        "Caroline: Oh. Okay.",
        "Rick: The lust thing is great. I-I see it lasting 40, 50 years. You know, what I really appreciate is all the other things. Like this thing, knowing that I needed a timeout.",
        "Caroline: I think my moment of crisis is okay now. We can go back to yours.",
        "Rick: Mine's okay, too. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I should go.",
        "Brooke: What -- what did I say?",
        "Katie: Nothing. You just -- you asked the wrong question. That's all.",
        "Brooke: Why you couldn't love Bill again?",
        "Katie: Yes. It's not important.",
        "Brooke: Yes, it is. It is important if you could just try to get that feeling back.",
        "Katie: I would do anything to get that feeling back, but I can't just wish and make it so. I'm not you. You fall in love and out of love so easily, and -- and you're completely secure with the fact that love will always be there for you, so when a relationship doesn't work out, you know that someone else is just around the corner, and you'll be able to capture that same excitement, that same feeling with him.",
        "Brooke: Is that really fair?",
        "Katie: I can't love the way you do, Brooke. For so long, Bill was the only person I could see. I couldn't imagine taking a breath without him. He was the love, he was the life that I wanted.",
        "Brooke: You can have that life still! Bill wants it also!",
        "Katie: No! I can't! I don't even know who he is anymore! I keep waiting for the man I fell in love with to show up! But he's lost to me! [Voice breaking] And ultimately, you're lost to me, too! I don't know if I'm coming or going! I am just trying to figure out how to move forward in this life that I don't recognize! I'm just trying [Sniffles] To make the best of what I have left!",
        "Brooke: Katie, wait. Stop.",
        "Katie: Just don't.",
        "Brooke: Please. This is not what I wanted for either of us. What do you want? Whatever you want, I'll do it!",
        "Katie: I don't know what to do, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: I wish I had an answer for you. I just don't know.",
