        "Quinn asks Ridge to leave but he says he is not going anywhere. Katie remains with Eric but he tells her she does not have to sit with him and wait. He trusts Quinn as much as she trusts him. Bill tells Liam that sometimes things take more time than you want, like with him and Brooke, but Liam should not give up on Steffy. Quinn says Ridge does not know a damn thing about her if he thinks she could ever deceive or cheat on Eric. He says perhaps; then maybe they need to get to know each other better. Steffy says she likes Wyatt and she does not want to put him through this but she and Liam have to wait. Eric tells Katie that it may seem foolish to her but he has total faith in his wife. Ridge tells Quinn to tell him about Quinn; make him understand. She doesn't know what she could say about being abused and overlooked. Slowly she tells him about Bill who got her pregnant and then just tossed money at her. Then there were all the scumbags that came after him, including men her mother brought home. She vowed she would never let another man get to her like that. She rants to Ridge now she has found the one man who loves and respects her and she is not going to give that up ever. He understands why she would want to fight for Eric since he is the first man who treated her the proper way. Ridge says he is his father's son and it is his place to protect his father from gold digger's like her. She says he sees the world a lot differently. She is not a gold digger otherwise she would have gone after Bill and his billions. Ridge has never had to worry about paying bills or even feeding his child. She says she has hated all the things she has done to give her son a better life but they do have one thing in common, they would do anything for their children. She just had to be more creative than Ridge. There was years and years of hard work and then she found love and she is not going to let Ridge take that away from her.",
        "Katie wonders with Quinn and Ridge together if they will make it back alive. Eric says there might be a broken limb or two but he is hoping this will bring them closer together. Ridge tries to convince Quinn that he does not want to take Eric away from her but he does not want her to prey on his life. He is only telling her the way he sees it. She says she has no other choice as she has been burned too many times. She's had to push people away and she did not care if they thought she was a bitch. She did not care what people said about her, they made it through somehow. But the greatest man on this earth saw and loved her so she will not follow Ridge's marching orders. She is not alone any more. She cries and he gives her his hankie. He says he will deny this but he knows now what she has been hiding and what his father fell for. Everything is going to be fine. She is amazing and she needs to trust that. He starts to leave and she calls him back to give him his hankie. He comes back and takes it and then holds out his arms and she gives him a hug. As she pulls back, he looks down and gives her a kiss which she responds to, then she looks up at him."

        "Quinn: Why are you still here?",
        "Ridge: After what you just said, you want me to just walk out the door?",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: I can't do that.",
        "Quinn: Why not?",
        "Ridge: Because you shouldn't be alone right now.",
        "Quinn: I'm asking you to leave.",
        "Ridge: Well, maybe I shouldn't be alone right now. I don't -- [Sighs] You want another?",
        "Quinn: No. Yes. Leave.",
        "Ridge: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Katie: I should go.",
        "Eric: Why?",
        "Katie: It's getting late.",
        "Eric: You live next door.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Your wife is out of town, and I don't want to...overstep.",
        "Eric: You don't have to worry, Katie. Quinn and I are fine. She trusts me as much as I trust her.",
        "Bill: Don't be late for this meeting tomorrow, Liam.",
        "Liam: Uh-huh.",
        "Bill: No, not \"uh-huh.\" I mean it! I mean, these bozos are always asking me questions I have no tolerance for. You need to be there. I'm gonna say my spiel and get the hell out. Did you get the agenda from Alison?",
        "Liam: Uh, yes. Also, some of those bozos like to be called employees.",
        "Bill: Oh! So you were paying attention.",
        "Liam: What does that mean?",
        "Bill: Means you seem distracted.",
        "Liam: Oh. Yeah. Actually, yeah, I am. I'm trying to be patient here, and I just -- I can't. I want Steffy home.",
        "Thomas: And, of course, we were down to our last diaper. No outfit changes left.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Thomas: Three hours left on the flight. Insanity.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my gosh!",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Right? Needless to say, Caroline's gonna be packing a carry-on full of diapers on her way back.",
        "Steffy: When is she coming back?",
        "Thomas: I don't know. It's hard being away from them for this long.",
        "Steffy: Sounds like you two are gonna get back together.",
        "Thomas: We don't know, taking it slow, a day at a time. [Clears throat] Speaking of, it might be nice, when they do come back, to not have a roommate around -- hint, hint.",
        "Steffy: Oh. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Besides, you don't want to be living with your brother. Isn't the goal to get back to Liam?",
        "Bill: You need fatherly advice.",
        "Liam: Oh, boy.",
        "Bill: You actually do have to be patient.",
        "Liam: Says the most impatient guy I know.",
        "Bill: What?! Are you kidding me? You know what I've been going through with Brooke! She talks herself into getting engaged to Forrester. Now I can't even convince her it's the worst decision she ever made because she's visiting hope in Europe.",
        "Liam: So, Forrester patience.",
        "Bill: I-it doesn't matter. The point is, sometimes you just have to know that things will work out. All right, it might take some time, but eventually, Steffy will move back in here. And Brooke... there is no way in hell that marriage to Forrester is ever going to happen.",
        "Quinn: If you're here for the tequila, you feel free to take it with you.",
        "Ridge: I'm not here for the tequila.",
        "Quinn: No, that's right. That's right, of course. You're here to humiliate me, take me away from your father. And that's never going to happen. If you really think that I could ever betray Eric, you don't know a damn thing about me.",
        "Ridge: You're right. I don't. So let's change that.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: I care about Wyatt. You know, I hate putting him through this. That's why Liam and I, we have to wait.",
        "Thomas: And you're okay with that?",
        "Steffy: You know I don't want to put Wyatt through this. I -- just think about his mom. I mean, he's gonna be stuck with her for the rest of his life.",
        "Thomas: Maybe we are, too. She is married to granddad.",
        "Steffy: Well... you know, I do think it's possible that her feelings for granddad are genuine. I just -- I know I'm never gonna trust her.",
        "Thomas: Genuine or not, I'm surprised it's lasted this long. This is Quinn we're talking about. I mean, isn't she supposed to have a Quinn meltdown by now?",
        "Steffy: Well, I'm sure that'll eventually happen. I just hope granddad isn't too hurt by it when she does.",
        "Katie: So, you and Quinn -- no trust issues at all.",
        "Eric: None whatsoever. It may seem foolish to you, but I have total faith in my wife.",
        "Ridge: Tell me.",
        "Quinn: Tell you what?",
        "Ridge: Tell me your story.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] You don't want to hear it.",
        "Ridge: I do.",
        "Quinn: Unh-unh. Why would I tell someone who hates me so much about myself?",
        "Ridge: Maybe there's a slight chance that he'd hate you less.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] You think I really care about that after -- after everything that's happened?",
        "Ridge: Talk to me. Make me understand. Tell me about Quinn.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Please.",
        "Quinn: Try... try explaining... what it feels like to be disrespected and used, over and over and over again and you -- you always say to yourself, \"you know what, the next guy is gonna be different,\" but he's not. He's just as awful. I was so young... ...when bill Spencer came into my life. And he tossed me aside. He threw money at me and told me, \"get rid of the kid.\" And then every guy that came after was just another version of bill, or of the men that my mom used to bring home, all lecherous and self-serving. I swore -- I did, I swore I would never be like her. I would never just give men what they want and give up power.",
        "Ridge: So bill was the first one. He ordered you around, but you made your own choices.",
        "Quinn: No, I kept him away. I kept my son protected from him. And from every other scumbag that came after. And with a lot of hard work and a lot of dedication, it paid off. It really did because my son -- my son is nothing like the rest of you guys.",
        "Ridge: The rest of us? I'm in a boat with bill Spencer now?",
        "Quinn: Really? Really? You weren't about to use me tonight? So you could humiliate me and disgrace me to my husband? Of course you're like the rest of them! You're like all of them! But not my son. And not my husband... ...who is the first man to respect me. Now that I have that, now that I have the one man on this planet who knows what it is to truly love another person, after years of turning my back and of guarding myself... I'm not giving that up! Not ever!",
        "Liam: All right. When's Brooke coming back?",
        "Bill: I don't know.",
        "Liam: Well, I got to say, I respect you for not giving up.",
        "Bill: We're Spencers. We don't give up.",
        "Liam: Yeah, turns out that's kind of a problem when Wyatt and I want the same thing.",
        "Bill: You do have a kind of point there, don't you? See, Steffy's lucky. I mean, she wins either way.",
        "Liam: Hey!",
        "Bill: Brooke on the other hand... I mean, if I don't convince her to come back to me, she's stuck with that loser.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] You'll convince her.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I will. Although, I probably won't have to, he'll do it for me.",
        "Liam: You think so, huh?",
        "Bill: Man, he's so freakin' stupid. He'll mess up. He always does.",
        "Ridge: My dad was the first man to treat you well. The first man that didn't make you feel degraded. I understand why you want to fight for him, why you don't want to lose him. I understand that completely. But here's what you have to understand. I'm his son. And he's kind and he's gentile. And it's my job to protect him from people like you.",
        "Quinn: People like me? Meaning what?",
        "Ridge: Gold diggers, maybe.",
        "Quinn: A gold digger. Wow. Well, see, if I were a gold digger, don't you think I would have gone after bill Spencer's millions? Geez. [Sighs] How you see the world... all those poor, unfortunate ones who weren't born with a million- dollar trust fund.",
        "Ridge: That's not what I'm saying at all.",
        "Quinn: You are so different than me. You're so different than most of society. You don't know what it feels like to be on the verge of bankruptcy... what it feels like to go hungry because you decide to give your son the last bit of cottage cheese you were able to find in the refrigerator.",
        "Ridge: No, I don't know what that's like.",
        "Quinn: You don't. As a Forrester, you -- you didn't have to worry about paying bills and feeding yourself, feeding your child, all while trying to get a business up off the ground. And you wonder why I'm guarded? Really? You wonder why I come across mean and aggressive? It's because I had to be!",
        "Ridge: So you build a wall around yourself. You use meanness to push people away. I understand. But you go too far. What you did to Liam, to ivy...",
        "Quinn: I hate it! I hate who I was! I hate all the things that I have done! I hate how I would justify in my head how I was gonna give my son a better life! You and I, we may be so different, but there is one thing that we have in common. We would do anything for our children.",
        "Ridge: That's true.",
        "Quinn: That's true. So, for you, that might have been writing some sort of big check to a private school. But, for me, no, I had to be a little bit more... I had to be more creative. Did I make mistakes? Yes, I made so many mistakes. But after years and years and years of hard work and dedication... I finally am able to give my son a life worth living. I -- I am getting that life worth living because I'm loved! [Laughs] That's something that I never even dared to hope for. And now that I have that, now that I have that, I am telling you this, ridge, and please -- you have to hear me. I am not letting you take that away from me.",
        "Katie: So, Quinn and ridge in san Francisco.",
        "Eric: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: Think they'll make it back alive?",
        "Eric: There might be a broken limb or two.",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Eric: I have high hopes for this event. It'd be a chance for them to get to know each other better. Maybe even some kind of a breakthrough. It might be exactly what the two of them need.",
        "Ridge: I don't want to take my dad away from you. I don't want to take anything away from you. I want to protect my father and this family and this company and our legacy.",
        "Quinn: You're afraid of me.",
        "Ridge: No, I'm not afraid of you. I'm afraid that my dad doesn't see you for who you are.",
        "Quinn: He's the only one who ever has. That fear you're feeling -- I've lived with it every single day of my life.",
        "Ridge: I'm not afraid of anything.",
        "Quinn: Really? Really? A single mother...on her own? I knew every single month could be the month that we end up homeless. [Scoffs] God, and you think I wasn't afraid? [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: I'm just telling you what I see. You go through the world and you push people out of the way.",
        "Quinn: I had to be guarded. I had no other choice. I had been burned and burned so many times, so, yes, I did. I did, I pushed people away! I -- I had to! And who cares? Who cares if people thought that I was a bitch? Because I survived. I endured every single thing that I had ever been through. [Scoffs] I don't care what people said about me or my son because we made it through somehow! And, somehow -- [Chuckles] The greatest man that has ever been put on this earth was able to see through that. And he took a chance. He took a chance on me. [Sobbing] So I am so sorry. I'm sorry -- I'm sorry if I don't following your marching orders. Because after years and years and years of being guarded and being alone... I'm finally not! I'm not alone anymore. And I don't -- I don't want to be... I don't ever want to be alone again.",
        "Rick: You're not alone. And I'm gonna deny that I said this... but I know why my father fell for my mother. And now I can see why my dad fell for you. And not because you're pretty or you're young, but... not because of those crazy eyes that can stare right into your soul... but because he sees you for who you really are... the woman that you're hiding from the world. And she's beautiful. Well, you don't have to hide her anymore, okay? It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be fine.",
        "Quinn: You really believe that?",
        "Ridge: I do. So stop spinning your web and stop building walls around you...",
        "Quinn: [Sniffles] I'm -- I'm trying.",
        "Ridge: You got to stop completely. Because who you are, who I saw tonight... you're amazing. You got to trust that. Trust that.",
        "Quinn: Ridge...",
        "Ridge: Okay."
