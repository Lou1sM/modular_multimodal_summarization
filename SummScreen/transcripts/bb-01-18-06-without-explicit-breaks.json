        "Eric: Stephanie. \n",
        "Stephanie: Eric? \n",
        "Eric: Just stopped by to \r\nsee Felicia, got myself a soda. Hope you don't mind. What's wrong? ",
        "Stephanie: Ridge and \r\nTaylor. ",
        "Eric: She's still upset \r\nwith him for not being here New Year's Eve? ",
        "Stephanie: As usual, ten \r\nsteps behind. ",
        "Eric: Spare me that. \r\nWhat's the problem? ",
        "Stephanie: Brooke. \n",
        "Eric: Brooke? Well, \r\nsurprise, surprise. ",
        "Stephanie: Look, he and \r\nTaylor are struggling with their marriage -- you know, Brooke smells blood, and \r\n-- it just frightens me. The whole thing. It frightens me for Ridge. ",
        "\r\n*********************************************************",
        "Brooke: Why isn't Ridge \r\nanswering the phone? I've got to get to him before he talks to Taylor. \n",
        "Nick: Well, he could be in \r\nthe middle of that right now, you know. ",
        "Brooke: How could she even \r\ntry to justify what she's done? Keeping her affair with James a secret from \r\nRidge all these years. ",
        "Nick: And passing judgment \r\non you. ",
        "Brooke: I don't care about \r\nthat anymore. It's the children that I'm worried about. This has been a very \r\ndifficult time for them. First losing their mother -- trying to adjust to that, \r\ngo on with their lives -- and then, suddenly she's back, and their lives turn \r\nupside down all over again? Look, I don't know if Taylor and Ridge should be \r\ntogether. But Thomas, Steffy and Phoebe, they need stability in their lives. \r\nWhatever Ridge is feeling, he's going to have to be able to look at his kids and \r\ntell them that he's doing the right thing. For them. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************",
        "Ridge: They're going to be \r\nhere pretty soon. ",
        "Taylor: How do you expect \r\nme to explain something to the children I don't even understand myself. \n",
        "Ridge: We're just going to \r\nhave to be honest with them. ",
        "Taylor: Really? That's \r\nwhat you want? Then I'll have to tell them that I don't want this marriage to \r\nend. That's being honest. Come on, Ridge, there's got to be another way. We're \r\nsmart people. ",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. \n",
        "Taylor: I guess -- the \r\ntruth is, I've felt it all along. I just didn't want to see it. I just thought \r\nwe could pick up where we left off. I wanted to believe nothing had changed \r\nwhile I was gone. It was all that kept me alive until I could get back to you. \r\nBut, by the time I got back, your feelings for Brooke were so deep. I guess I \r\nshould've -- I should've just accepted your relationship with Brooke and moved \r\non myself, but I couldn't. ",
        "Ridge: Doc, my love for \r\nyou hasn't changed. But I just can't ignore the hypocrisy of what you and mother \r\nhave done to Brooke over the years. Look, I'm really hoping that you and I can \r\ncontinue to have a strong, productive relationship. We're still our kids \r\nparents. We need to find a way to be united, in that regard. ",
        "Taylor: Do you really want \r\nme to tell them that I've accepted this decision you have made to destroy our \r\nmarriage? ",
        "Ridge: Yes. Yeah, I do. \r\nIt's going to be hard enough for them to come to terms with all this without \r\nhaving to watch their parents fight over it. We need to let them know that we \r\nlove them, that we're still going to be a family -- just not in the way they had \r\nhoped. Can you do that, Taylor? ",
        "[Door opening] \n",
        "Thomas: Dad. Mom. What's \r\ngoing on? ",
        "Steffy: Is there something \r\nwrong? ",
        "Ridge: Everything's going \r\nto be okay. I just wanted all of us to be together up here. Look, your mother \r\nand I want you to know how much we love you -- how proud of you we are. And we \r\nwant you to know that there is nothing that we won't do for you -- for the rest \r\nof your lives. ",
        "Thomas: Dad -- you only \r\nsay things like this when something terrible is about to happen. What's wrong?\r\n",
        "\r\n*************************************************************",
        "Nick: I think it's very \r\nadmirable that you're worried about Taylor's kids. ",
        "Brooke: They've been \r\nthrough so much upheaval. I don't want to see their lives being turned upside \r\ndown all over again. Please, Ridge, pick up. ",
        "Nick: He's probably made \r\nup his mind. I really don't see what you can say that's going to make a \r\ndifference. ",
        "Brooke: I can remind him \r\nof his responsibilities for Thomas and the girls. And I can also make him \r\nunderstand that if he's thinking about getting back together with me, that's \r\njust not an option. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************",
        "Thomas: Dad, why'd you \r\ncall us up here? ",
        "Ridge: Thomas, Steffy, \r\nPhoebe -- you guys have always been so sensitive -- so aware. I'm sure you've \r\nhad to realize that things haven't been very smooth between your mother and me.\r\n",
        "Phoebe: You were gone \r\nChristmas and New Year's on business. We understood. Right, Mom? ",
        "Steffy: It's not like it \r\nwas some big crisis. ",
        "Thomas: Does this have \r\nsomething to do with Brooke? ",
        "Ridge: When your mother \r\ncame back, no one was happier than I was. ",
        "Steffy: What's that \r\nsupposed to mean? ",
        "Ridge: Okay. We were all \r\necstatic. We were finally together again, the way it was supposed to be. But -- \r\nI had another family -- with Brooke. With R.J. and Hope. You guys were part of \r\nthat family, too. You know how much we all meant to each other. My feelings for \r\nyour mother haven't changed. But Brooke and I shared a life together, too. And \r\nthat was just thrown away, like it didn't matter. Well, it does matter. I need \r\nto go back to it. This doesn't change how your mother and I feel about you guys. \r\nWe love you very much. We always will. But our marriage to each other is over.\r\n",
        "Steffy: Mom? ",
        "Phoebe: Mom -- tell him \r\nhe's wrong. Tell him you don't want him to go. ",
        "Thomas: So you're just \r\ngoing to walk out on her? After everything that she did to come home to us?\r\n",
        "\r\n***************************************************************",
        "\u00a0Brooke: Ridge, if you get \r\nthis message, please call me! Don't do anything until we talk. He might not be \r\ngetting a signal up at the mountain, so he's probably not getting my messages. I \r\nhave to go up there. I'm going to stop him from making this huge mistake. \n",
        "Nick: Whoa, whoa, wait a \r\nminute. I don't think that's such a good idea. You know, you're the one who \r\nwalked in on her and the fireman in the first place. ",
        "Brooke: I'm going up there \r\nto save her marriage. ",
        "Nick: I really don't think \r\nthat Taylor would appreciate that. Especially coming from you. ",
        "Brooke: I'll do what I \r\ncan. ",
        "Nick: Brooke -- be \r\ncareful, driving. ",
        "Brooke: Nick, we both love \r\nBridget very much. And we want her to be happy. But that doesn't mean that we \r\nhave to pretend that we don't have feelings for each other. I will never regret \r\none minute of the time that we've spent together. I wouldn't change it for \r\nanything. I've got to go. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************",
        "Thomas: How can you do \r\nthis to Mom? ",
        "Taylor: Thomas, wait. When \r\nI came back home, I thought everything would go right back to the way it was \r\nbefore I left. I wanted that. I expected it. I had no way of knowing that \r\neverything would change so much while I was gone. I had ridge, I had all of you \r\nfrozen in my mind. But you couldn't stop yourselves from growing, and moving on. \r\nI would have wanted that -- if I knew that I was never coming back, I would have \r\nwanted your father to get married again. I would have wanted him to make a home \r\nfor you. I would have wanted him to make something that was nurturing and loving \r\nfor you -- all of which, he did. But then, he and Brooke had R.J. and when I \r\ncame back home, that little boy lost his father. And he misses him just the \r\nexact same way you miss me. I didn't think of what all the ramifications would \r\nbe of me coming back home after being gone for such a long time. I just -- I \r\nwanted to close my eyes and pretend that everything would go right back the same \r\nway it was before I left. But that's not living in reality. And I don't want to \r\nlive like that anymore. But I still have you. I still have my girls, and I have \r\nmy son. We're all still together, we're all still a family. And your father and \r\nI will always love each other. We just won't be married anymore. ",
        "Phoebe: I still don't \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Taylor: We have plenty of \r\ntime to answer a lot of questions later, okay? What I want you both to do is go \r\non home, and I'll be there in a little bit. I just need to talk to your father \r\nabout a few more things. ",
        "Steffy: Don't take too \r\nlong. ",
        "Taylor: I won't. \n",
        "Thomas: I can't say that I \r\nagree with what you're doing -- but I know that, sometimes you have to make \r\ndecisions that are going to hurt people you love. Staying in the game, with your \r\nheart only half in it -- it wasn't good for mom, either. I hope this is better \r\nfor both of you. ",
        "Ridge: They took the news \r\npretty well. ",
        "Taylor: You have no idea \r\nhow this may have affected them. You may not know that for years. ",
        "Ridge: They live with \r\nBrooke. They understand. ",
        "Taylor: What they \r\nunderstand is that Brooke never let go of you. She's loving the turmoil we're \r\nin. She's responsible for it. Dangling R.J. over your head, blackmailing me \r\nabout Hector -- ",
        "Ridge: She forced you to \r\nkeep your affair with James a secret? ",
        "Taylor: You can end our \r\nmarriage, Ridge, but you will never change my opinion about Brooke. I was going \r\nto go to the dry cleaners later -- here's your ticket. ",
        "Ridge: Thank you. I'll \r\ntake care of it. ",
        "Taylor: I need some time \r\nalone. ",
        "Ridge: All right. \n",
        "Taylor: Our marriage was \r\nso beautiful. It was the most wonderful years of my life. But I never should \r\nhave put my ring back on. ",
        "\r\n***********************************************************",
        "Stephanie: All of the \r\ndevastation, and all of the problems and scandals that have been brought upon \r\nthis family are the result of one person, one woman -- Brooke. ",
        "Eric: You're the one on \r\nthe warpath here, not Brooke. ",
        "Stephanie: You know, you \r\nand Ridge have never, ever seen her for what she really is. I'm telling you, \r\nshe's scheming to get her hands back on Ridge. And the wonderful marriage that \r\nhe shares with Taylor is going to be destroyed. We've got to do something that \r\nstops her. ",
        "Eric: This is sad, you \r\nknow? You think that your manipulations and your machinations are things that \r\nhave saved our children from themselves. You think you're the glue that holds \r\nthis family together. But you've only made things worse. It's your lying that \r\nput ridge in this situation in the first place. Do Ridge a favor -- stay out of \r\nhis life from now on. Let our adult son make his own choices. That's what a good \r\nparent would do. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************",
        "Brooke: Ridge? You here? \r\nI've been trying to reach Ridge -- he hasn't been answering his phone. \n",
        "Taylor: He just left. You \r\nshouldn't have any trouble finding him. You never do. ",
        "Brooke: I'm too late. \r\nTaylor, I'm sorry. I didn't want this -- ",
        "Taylor: Take your victory, \r\nBrooke. Dance on my grave with it. But don't play miss innocent. I know who you \r\nare. I know what you've done. And I hate you for it. Do you have any idea how \r\nmuch I hate you? "
