        "Brooke invites Donna to the new launch by Forrester's. She supports Nick and hates the Forresters for what they did to her parents and to Nick's mother and to Brooke. She doesn't want to stand by and watch Brooke get hurt again. She realizes how special Nick is, he really cares. Ridge purposely drops Nick's wedding gift to Thorne and Taylor and tells him to butt out of their lives. He gives reference to their company going down like the Titanic. Nick had never beaten him before, he sure as hell isn't now. Nick likewise fires off a few rounds that Ridge's new business venture will be over tomorrow. Felicia fumes when Donna has the nerve to show up at the launch, but Brooke tells her it's okay she invited her. And Brooke wants Donna to join with them in a new job. Ridge is not pleased with this. The lawyer warns Eric he may have a lawsuit if he uses the name Forrester. Eric says it is HIS name and Nick can go to hell.",
        "Watching on TV screen, Nick is worried, not so much about the name but his own designs. They may not measure up. They will have to exercise patience and do whatever they must to stay on top. Ridge tells the gang just watch, he has something planned for tonight that will bring the place down. The launch is huge success despite them calling it the Forrester Originals and Nick being incensed. Ridge manages to get a few digs in about the crusty old sailor and his rags, and if they want to reach for quality, reach for Forrester Originals. Eric introduces Our Miss Brooks \u0096 Brooke Logan as the Ultimate Forrester Original. After walking the runway, Ridge says a few words, bends down on his knee and in front of God and everybody proposes to Brooke and she giddily accepts. Disgusted, Nick vows they made a mistake. They have only high-end clients and he can corner the market. Spend every last cent on their precious collection and they will dig their own grave. That family will be crawling on their knees with no one to turn to but him!"

        "Brooke: Donna, hi. It's Brooke. I'd really like it if you could come by Forrester's new offices today before our launch. I hope to see you.",
        "Donna: Should I go?",
        "Nick: You clear on how you feel?",
        "Donna: I support you, Nick.",
        "Nick: She's your sister. I know how she's going to feel about this. She's not going to want you competing against them.",
        "Donna: Look, I hate the Forresters for what they did to my parents, your mother. For what they've always done to Brooke. It's only a matter of time before she's going to get hurt again. And I'm not just going to stand by and watch that happen.",
        "Nick: You know, Donna, I tried to protect her. I lost her. You could risk losing her, too.",
        "Donna: You know, I didn't think much of you at first. But now I see what made you so special to Brooke. You cared. Really cared.",
        "Ridge: I would have thought you'd have better sense than to take a job with this fool.",
        "Donna: Well, I don't remember any other offers coming my way. Not that I'd work for somebody who almost killed Jackie. Oh, and then publicly humiliated her for good measure. It's nice to be reminded what your family's made of.",
        "Nick: Isn't there someplace you're supposed to be? Something about the launch of the Titanic?",
        "Ridge: Oh, I do believe that's the ship you're on, Nick.",
        "Nick: This attempt to rise from the ashes. It's not gonna happen.",
        "Ridge: You've never beaten me before. Sure as hell not going to do it now.",
        "Nick: That looks like my wedding gift to Taylor and Thorne.",
        "Ridge: You had no business giving it. [Glass shattering] You've somehow managed to take our company, Nick, but that is the last thing of ours you will ever touch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Wow, there's a record amount of press in the showroom!",
        "Brooke: Yes, that's exactly what we want!",
        "Eric: It is.",
        "Taylor: The showroom looks absolutely beautiful.",
        "Eric: Good, I'm glad you like it. How's Aly?",
        "Thorne: She's better. You know, she's upset about what she did to Taylor's dress. But we sat up and talked about it for a while last night.",
        "Eric: Did you?",
        "Pam: Aly will come around, she's such a smart little girl.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, she is.",
        "Eric: In the meantime, I'm glad you're here.",
        "Felicia: That's right. 'Cause we're making history!",
        "Eric: You're absolutely right.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I certainly hope so.",
        "Thorne: Listen, Arthur Harrison and Harvey Golden are in the showroom. And I ran into Lauren Fenmore here, too.",
        "Eric: Good, I'm glad she could make it.",
        "Thorne: She can't wait to see what we have to offer.",
        "Eric: Well, she's not going to be disappointed. Nick Marone may have taken our company, but today we launch a new one.",
        "Thorne: Yes, we do.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Felicia: Oh, excuse me, but nobody that works for Nick Marone is welcome here.",
        "Brooke: It's all right, Felicia. I invited her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Sounds like something broke.",
        "Ridge: Different rules when it involves my family.",
        "Nick: I'm not the one who stopped that wedding. It was a frightened little girl.",
        "Ridge: Alexandria loves Taylor very much.",
        "Nick: The marriage would have been a farce. You're the one who should have stopped it in the first place.",
        "Ridge: You just don't know when to give up, do you, Nick?",
        "Nick: You're in my office now, Forrester. Playtime's over.",
        "Ridge: You may be in this building, but you didn't take what was here. We're launching something really nice, Nick. Real fashion with real designs. I suggest you enjoy being in this office while you can, because I think very soon, there's going to be a \"For Lease\" sign out front.",
        "Nick: It's all gonna be over tomorrow, Forrester. Your new venture is going to be finished. I suggest you go home, make a dress. You'll feel better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: I can't believe Donna had the nerve to show up here. We never would have lost Forrester Creations if she hadn't claimed that Mother shoved Jackie over the banister.",
        "Taylor: Well, she is still Brooke's sister.",
        "Felicia: Yeah, who Nick is using as a tool for revenge.",
        "Taylor: Well, considering how this family has tortured Jackie these last few weeks, I don't know why everybody's accusing Nick of anything.",
        "Thorne: Felicia's just pointing out --",
        "Taylor: No. I know, I know. Nick is always wrong. This family's always right. I don't know what's taken me so long to get that. I'll see you in the showroom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Attorney: Here's the paperwork regarding the name of the new company.",
        "Eric: Good, wonderful.",
        "Attorney: I have to caution you once again, Eric. Using this name is certain to bring a lawsuit against you.",
        "Eric: The name is mine. It belongs to me. If Nick Marone doesn't like it, he can go to hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Storm: Press release from the Forrester's announcement today.",
        "Jackie: Have they named the company?",
        "Storm: Well, that's what bothers me. It doesn't say on the press release.",
        "Nick: We've got the name. It's the designs that worry me. They don't match up to the Forrester's.",
        "Clarke: If that's how you feel, why did you hire me?",
        "Nick: Because you've learned something from Sally, and that will have value down the road.",
        "Jackie: Nicky, we have the upper hand. We own an established company with an established name. It's the Forresters that are going to have to start from scratch.",
        "Storm: Jackie's right, Nick. Sally's style tactics will only cause trouble.",
        "Nick: Okay, then we exercise patience and discipline. And we have to do whatever we have to do to come out on top of this little game we're in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: I'm surprised you summoned me to the inner sanctum. Obviously, the Forresters were too.",
        "Brooke: They have a right to be wary of anyone connected to Nick.",
        "Donna: The only person the Forresters should be wary of is Stephanie. You most of all. Brooke, after everything she put you through, how could you allow yourself to get sucked back into that family?",
        "Brooke: Stephanie has accepted the fact that Ridge and I belong together.",
        "Donna: This week. What about next? You'll be the one over the banister, embarrassed in front of the world.",
        "Brooke: Donna, I really don't need this lecture.",
        "Donna: Well then, you shouldn't have asked me here.",
        "Brooke: I asked you here for a reason. I want you with us.",
        "Donna: What? You're offering me a job?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Donna: You're serious?",
        "Brooke: Yes! Yes, I am serious. I understand Nick's allure, I really do. But come to work with us. Having a skunk for a husband can be... whew!",
        "Brooke: Come on Donna, you can win them over. I don't want to compete against my own sister.",
        "Donna: It's not something I look forward to either. But Nick has been so generous to me. And I signed a contract.",
        "Brooke: Fine, we'll get you out of it.",
        "Donna: Break a contract Storm wrote? You do know he's Nick's legal counsel?",
        "Ridge: It'll take more than good legal counsel to save Marone from failure on this deal. Spying for Popeye, are we?",
        "Brooke: Oh Ridge, I invited her. I offered her a job.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Donna: You see, this is exactly what I was talking about.",
        "Ridge: She helped Marone steal what was ours. Why would we want her working here, hmm? I'm going to go get changed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Storm: \"The Forrester family proudly announces the launch of their newest creation. Join us for champagne and caviar as we toast to a new beginning.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Are you sure it's okay for me to be here? I wouldn't want anyone to think I'm spying.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry that Ridge was so rude to you. Well, you know how much he loved Forrester Creations.",
        "Donna: Yeah, well he's lost it now.",
        "Brooke: Yes, I know. And that's why we're launching a new company today. When we become a huge success, you might just change your mind.",
        "Donna: Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Everybody settled?",
        "Felicia: Yes, and chomping at the bit.",
        "Eric: Good, let's get started.",
        "Felicia: I'll let Brooke know.",
        "Ridge: Well gents, I've got something planned for tonight that's gonna bring the place down.",
        "Thorne: I don't think you're going to be able to top what you did last time.",
        "Ridge: Watch me.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Eric: Thank you! Thank you. Thanks everybody. And welcome. Thank you for being here today. We're back and we're better than ever! We're redefining ourselves as the premier fashion house in America. In the world, really. Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Forrester Originals!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clarke: They're using the Forrester name!",
        "Jackie: They can't do that!",
        "Storm: It's a complete violation of the terms of the sale agreement.",
        "Jackie: Nicky?",
        "[Light guitar music]",
        "Clarke: They can't use the name Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Nick Marone may have purchased our old company. He may own the real estate, and he may think that he has access to our history at Forrester Creations. But my name is still Eric Forrester! We're all Forresters here! And we are the people who will make this company a major success!",
        "[Applause]",
        "Eric: Forrester Originals! More exclusive and elegant than ever!",
        "Ridge: To our loyal clientele, you can rest assured the quality you've always known lives on at Forrester Originals! Do not, I repeat, do not be fooled by the crusty old sailor and his rags. The choice is very clear here, ladies and gentlemen. When you reach for the name that stands for quality, reach for Forrester Originals.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Storm: I'll get the lawsuit started.",
        "Nick: Wait a minute! The Forresters expect us to sue. They might even hope we will.",
        "Clarke: Lots of free publicity.",
        "Nick: There's another way to go here. Mother, exactly who is at the show? Who does Ridge and Eric hope to sell these exclusive gowns to?",
        "Jackie: High-end distributors. Harrison's, Fenmore.",
        "Nick: People the Forresters depend on.",
        "Jackie: Well, absolutely. Age-old relationships.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: The same people who are responsible for making our former company such a powerhouse in haute couture will be doing the same thing for us now.",
        "Nick: Then it's time to test those relationships.",
        "Eric: Including Brooke Logan. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Logan -- our Miss Brooke is more radiant and stunning than ever. But you don't have to take my word for it. Ladies and gentlemen, the ultimate Forrester Original!",
        "[Applause]",
        "Ridge: Have you ever seen such a beautiful sight? Brooke Logan is the embodiment of a Forrester Original. A bold and beautiful masterpiece. Unforgettable. And when you know you have the best, it's very smart to never let her go. Logan, if I could have just one wish, it would be that you would be my wife until the day I die. [Reporters talking] We've been blessed with beautiful children. The best days are still ahead of us. Our marriage will flourish as will our new company. Oh hell, you know the drill.",
        "Brooke: Oh my God. Yes! Yes! Of course, I'll marry you.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clarke: Unbelievable. Every trick in the book. They've got a hell of a team. They could wipe us out.",
        "Jackie: Nicky? Are you all right? Nicky?",
        "Nick: I know what to do now, Mother. They made a mistake, they left themselves vulnerable. Couture boutiques. High-end retail. They've narrowed themselves down to a precious few distributors. Fenmore, Jackie M, St. Julienne, Harrison's. By the time they launch their first line, those boutiques will be mine. I'll corner the market, control the distribution. And when they've spent their last cent on the precious collection, they'll have dug their grave. They'll have no place to serve their clientele. A bust of biblical proportions. And that family will be crawling on their knees, with no one to turn to but me."
