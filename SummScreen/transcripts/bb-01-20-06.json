        "Ridge shows up and it playing with R.J. in Brooke's house. She is surprised as he tells her what happened the night before at Big Bear. She tells him she was there. Clearly she is not interested when Ridge makes his move to tell her he tried, but his heart belonged somewhere else. He admits he knows he hurt her and he has no right to ask, but can she forgive him and take him back? She turns a deaf ear and tells him to go back to Taylor and pray that she will take him back, because she won't. Stephanie visits Taylor and begs her to fight for Ridge. Taylor tells her she is through fighting; she won't do it. Ridge pleads his case. Leaving Brooke was the biggest mistake of his life (he blames Stephanie's manipulations). He made the wrong choice but he made her happy once and he knows he could again. They are interrupted by Nick and Hope. She manages to get Nick to take Hope to Jackie's Boutique and she will handle it with Ridge. Nick spills all to his mother, how Ridge is trying to worm his way back into Brooke's life. She tries to calm him down, not to get caught up in Brooke's drama. He needs only to focus on his wife. Stephanie pleads with Taylor who says she will treasure her time with Ridge, but it's over. They both need to make new lives for themselves. They embrace and part still friends. Dante show up with a red rose. He's sympathetic; he knows how hard she fought to come back from the dead to be with Ridge. She smiles that he helped her then and here he is again. Brooke asks Ridge to leave. He confesses again his big mistake, but this is where he belongs. Out of the blue, he asks her to marry him. He points out his home is with her, R.J. and Hope. He kisses her and she rather weakly tells him don't do this to her; just leave her alone."

        "Brooke: Ridge? What are you doing here?",
        "Ridge: Wanted to see my son. And you. Something happened last night when I went to see Taylor.",
        "Brooke: I know. I drove up to Big Bear to try to find you. Stop you from making a huge mistake. I guess I was too late.",
        "Ridge: We tried, but we just couldn't make it work.",
        "Brooke: Try harder.",
        "Ridge: You can't just pick up a marriage after all those years, when you know there's somewhere else you need to be. We have a child, Brooke. We built a family. I know I hurt you. And I have no right to ask. But could you forgive me? Is it possible -- remotely possible -- that you could take me back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Stephanie: Taylor? Taylor, are you home? Oh, honey. Oh, Taylor. I know, Ridge -- Ridge came to see me. He told me what happened, honey.",
        "Taylor: It's over.",
        "Stephanie: No, it's not. Look, he's just overreacting to this whole situation. He's mad at everybody. He threatened to throw me out of his life if I don't accept Brooke, so --",
        "Taylor: He's going back to her.",
        "Stephanie: No, he's not. Now, come on. Come on now. Pull yourself together. I mean it. We have a battle to fight here.",
        "Taylor: No. No, I'm through fighting. I won't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You can't just give up on your marriage.",
        "Ridge: My place is here, Brooke, with you, R.J. and hope.",
        "Brooke: You just said you can't pick up where you left off and expect everything to be the same.",
        "Ridge: It's different with us.",
        "Brooke: Yes, it is different. I'm different. Things have changed.",
        "Ridge: But they shouldn't have. I should have ended it with Taylor the moment I realized I was manipulated into renewing our vows.",
        "Brooke: But you didn't.",
        "Ridge: The kids were so happy to have their family back. After everything that had happened -- everything that happened with Taylor -- I made a mistake, Brooke. The biggest mistake of my life. I was wrong. I made the wrong choice. I wanted to please everyone and wound up pleasing no one. Especially you. Brooke, there was a time when I made you happy. Brooke, I can do that again.",
        "Nick: Yo.",
        "Hope: Guess what we got?",
        "Ridge: Well, from the smell -- I'd say it's breakfast.",
        "Brooke: Nick took Hope down to the pier to get some Belgian waffles.",
        "Hope: Want some?",
        "Ridge: Oh, no thanks, kiddo. Your mommy and I have some things we need to talk about.",
        "Nick: Like what? Brooke, what is it the two of you have to talk about?",
        "Brooke: Ridge, why don't you take R.J. and Hope, and go into the kitchen. Catherine can help you put some butter and some syrup on those waffles, okay?",
        "Ridge: You and I still need to talk.",
        "Brooke: I know, I just need a moment with Nick, that's all.",
        "Ridge: Come on, sweetie, let's go to the kitchen to get something to eat. Come on.",
        "Nick: He's not wearing his wedding ring.",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Nick: Which means he called it off with Taylor.",
        "Brooke: I couldn't get there in time.",
        "Nick: And here he is. Here he is. The guy didn't even take a breath, and he jumped from Taylor to you.",
        "Brooke: Nobody's jumping anywhere.",
        "Nick: I told you this would happen. It's like some sadistic ping-pong match with the two of you. Back and forth. You, Taylor. This family, that family. It's got to stop. You've got to get him out of this house.",
        "Brooke: Nick, calm down. I'm handling it.",
        "Nick: Why don't you let me handle it? I'll throw him out of this house right now while those kids are having breakfast.",
        "Brooke: No, you won't.",
        "Nick: He's R.J.'s father, there's nobody that questions that. But that's not why he's here, is it? So tell me -- he asked you to take him back, didn't he? How long this time, huh? How long before he changes his mind and breaks your heart again? And guess what, I'm not going to let it happen.",
        "Brooke: Nick, wait.",
        "Hope: Look at me!",
        "Nick: Well, what are you wearing there, sweet pea?",
        "Ridge: Oh, just a little present from Paris.",
        "Brooke: You look so pretty. I bet I know who would appreciate that hat. Jackie. Maybe Uncle Nick could take you to go see her.",
        "Hope: Can we? Now?",
        "Nick: Well, I'm going to have a little talk with Ridge first outside.",
        "Brooke: I think you should go now. I'll handle this.",
        "Nick: Come here, kiddo. Thatta girl.",
        "Ridge: Don't forget this.",
        "Brooke: All right, honey. Have a good time, okay?",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: You and Ridge are still married. You can work this out.",
        "Taylor: No. What we had is in the past, Stephanie. The perfect life I wanted -- that ended a long time ago. When I was gone, my life stood still. But Ridge's moved on, with Brooke. And now, it's my turn to move on. And I think you should, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jackie laughs]",
        "Jackie: No, no, no, no, no. Please, the pleasure was all mine. Bye bye, Oscar.",
        "Nick: Oscar? Like my cousin Oscar?",
        "Jackie: De la Renta.",
        "Nick: Oh.",
        "Jackie: Hello, darling. Oh, my word. Mademoiselle, I love that beret.",
        "Hope: It itches.",
        "Nick: Of course it itches. It's a present from Ridge. Here, take that.",
        "Jackie: Well, you look beautiful in it. Better than that sailor's cap.",
        "Nick: No, it's not. Look, now that's my girl. Look at that. Huh?",
        "Jackie: Oh, Andrea, I'm glad you're here. Why don't you take Hope into my office. You might find a little surprise in there waiting.",
        "Nick: Go on, go with Andrea. There you go. Will see you in a little bit.",
        "Jackie: The beret? The beret? Come on, sit down. Okay, tell me, what's going on?",
        "Nick: I just left Brooke's house. Forrester's over there right now.",
        "Jackie: He didn't want to visit with Hope?",
        "Nick: Oh, he wants to do more than visit, Mother. He split with Taylor.",
        "Jackie: What? They're getting divorced?",
        "Nick: I don't know -- divorced, annulled, whatever. It's over.",
        "Jackie: Poor Taylor.",
        "Nick: Don't you mean \"poor Brooke?\" This guy is going to try to worm his way back into her life.",
        "Jackie: Are you sure? I mean, I could think of plenty of other reasons that he was over at the house.",
        "Nick: Oh, please, Mother. The guy breaks up with his wife one night and the next day, he's parked right in the middle of her living room? No, I don't think so. There's only one thing on this guy's mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Am I wrong or did Nick just ask me to step outside?",
        "Brooke: He's just looking out for me. He thinks that you're here to sweep me off my feet.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I would never be accused of trying to do something like that.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, I told you -- we had our chance. It's over. So why don't you just do yourself and your family a favor and go home. Go back to your wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Sweetheart, you cannot allow yourself to get caught up in Brooke's drama, it's --",
        "Nick: She's gonna get hurt, Mother. She'll get hurt.",
        "Jackie: And so will your wife. And so will you, if you don't stay focused.",
        "Nick: This has nothing to do with me and Bridget.",
        "Jackie: Exactly.",
        "Nick: What about this family, Mother? What about little Hope? I mean, Brooke's a big girl, but what about Hope? If this guy weasels his way back into their lives, all he's going to do is get her to love him and then disappear again!",
        "Jackie: Brooke will not allow that to happen. She's seen it so many times before, she'll stop him. She won't fall for that.",
        "Nick: Well, if she does, he's going to answer to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Brooke, what happened with Taylor -- I was confused.",
        "Brooke: I'm not.",
        "Ridge: I let you down. I know that.",
        "Brooke: I've already accepted your apology.",
        "Ridge: But you deserve so much more than that, Brooke. Now, I'm able to give it to you.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, we had a life. We had a family.",
        "Ridge: We can have all of that again.",
        "Brooke: You turned your back on us.",
        "Ridge: All I'm asking for is a chance to make it up to you.",
        "Brooke: I gave you a chance. After Jackie and I exposed Stephanie's deception. And you decided to stay with Taylor.",
        "Ridge: Things are different now.",
        "Brooke: Not for me. You hurt me more than anybody ever has. And I'm not going to put myself in that position again. So why don't you go home -- go home to Taylor, and just pray that she'll take you back for the kids' sake. Because I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: The battle is over, Stephanie. I am done fighting.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, you have so much to fight for.",
        "Taylor: I know this is hard for you. I know you've done so much to get Brooke out of your life, but it's got to stop. I'll always cherish the time I had with Ridge. And the years that we had raising our children together. But it's over. That time has passed. And I need to move on. And so do you. For ourselves, for our children -- we have to put down our weapons, and take off our armor, and make new lives for ourselves. Wonderful lives. Lives with new goals, new priorities. We can do that, Stephanie. We can do that together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Your favorite -- I figured you could use some cheering up.",
        "Taylor: You heard what happened?",
        "Dante: Yeah, Bridget told me that you and Ridge have been having some problems.",
        "Taylor: We ended our marriage.",
        "Dante: When?",
        "Taylor: Last night. Things just weren't working. No matter how hard we tried.",
        "Dante: You know, sometimes it's just not enough.",
        "Taylor: No.",
        "Dante: I mean, look -- look at me. I came all the way here from Italy to be with Bridget.",
        "Taylor: She and Nick --",
        "Dante: And I believe it in my heart that I'm the right man for her. You know, that I can make her happy. But I guess it just wasn't meant to be.",
        "Taylor: Ridge and I have just -- we've already gotten through so many other things in life -- I don't know. I knew things weren't right. I just thought if I had faith --",
        "Dante: Hey, listen, that faith is what brought you home. I know how hard you fought to come back home to Ridge. It's like you were obsessed. You had one vision, one goal. And you would have done anything.",
        "Taylor: I guess just to see him again, and to have been able to hold him.",
        "Dante: That determination may have saved your life.",
        "Taylor: With a lot of help from you. And here you are again.",
        "Dante: I hate seeing you this way.",
        "Taylor: I'm all right. I'll be okay.",
        "Dante: You know, there's this Italian proverb that says -- [Speaking Italian] \"Not everything that was bad will come back and hurt you.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Logan, Logan --",
        "Brooke: I asked you to leave.",
        "Ridge: I'm not going back to Taylor. I'm not going back --",
        "Brooke: Ridge, please.",
        "Ridge: Now, just listen -- when I walked away from you and our family, that was the most difficult thing I've ever done. When you left the house, I loved you as much as I ever did. But, manipulated or not, I had an obligation to Taylor. So we said vows -- and I had an obligation to uphold them. But more and more, that's all it seemed to turn into, was an obligation.",
        "Brooke: You love her, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Yes, and I love seeing her with our kids.",
        "Brooke: So go back to her.",
        "Ridge: I can't.",
        "Brooke: She hurt you. She lied, but you can work past that.",
        "Ridge: Maybe. But I can't work past my love for you, Brooke. It's still there. It always will be.",
        "Brooke: It wasn't strong enough to keep you from leaving.",
        "Ridge: I messed up. I made a huge mistake in my life. And I don't blame you for shutting me out. But this is where I belong, Brooke. This is where I belong, if you will just forgive me --",
        "Brooke: It's too late. Just go home, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: My home is here with you, and R.J. and Hope.",
        "Brooke: No. That's never going to happen.",
        "Ridge: Marry me.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: Be my wife again, Brooke. I know it's out of the blue, but it is right.",
        "Brooke: No!",
        "Ridge: Brooke, we can raise R.J. and hope together. Our son will grow up with his father.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, don't do this! I can't.",
        "Ridge: Yes, we can. I love you, Brooke. I love you, and I want you in my life. I want you back in my life. I want you now.",
        "Brooke: I said don't. Don't do this to me. Please, just leave me alone."
