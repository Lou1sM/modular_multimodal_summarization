        "Ridge catches Katie as she flees from Brooke's house. He tells her that she is in no condition to drive so come with him. Hope dumps a lot of paperwork on Pam who is disgruntled because Donna didn't show up; she had a broken shoe strap so they won't see her until after lunch. Wyatt tells his mother about his new place. She thinks it sounds great, but she does not want him indebted to Bill. Everything comes with a price. He says he is not leaving the country; it's just Malibu. She says fine, when do they move in? She had him for moment. He says normally he would not mind her moving in, but right now he needs his privacy with a girlfriend. She's ecstatic that this is what they are calling it now. She's only a little offended when he mentions he has another gift for Hope besides the necklace he gave her. Since she designs jewelry, she would have thought he would have come to her. He says no, it is not that kind of gift. And certainly if he ever needs that sort of ring he will come to her. She is about to tell him something about the Hope diamond when Pam interrupts and says Wyatt has a delivery out front. He asks his mom to come with him. He might need anther woman's opinion.",
        "Ridge brings Katie back to Eric's. She says she is sure that he has more things to do than talk to her. He say no, not really. He wants to know what drove her into his manly arms. She tells him about her visit to see Brooke. And Brooke wants her to just go back to Bill but Katie doesn't think she can do like Brooke does which is just follow her heart. She is not concerned with the past nor the future just lives in the present. Ridge quotes a sonnet from Shakespeare that makes Katie smile and she recites the finish of the verse. They have that in common that she did not know. Charlie shows up at Forrester and surprises Pam. He tells her that he has been assigned the Forrester company now and old Hawkeye will be guarding the emeralds. He looks a little down when she says he is like royalty around here as he saved the diamond. Liam stops by and he tells Hope that he is not there for a fashion piece. He does slip in that he misses the two of them together and she agrees so does she. He asks if it is Steffy that is still keeping them apart and she says partly. Liam counters that he has not been in contact with her since their aborted wedding day. And the only reason she was there then was because of Quinn. The only reason they are not married right now is because she got involved. Hope acknowledges that Quinn has done some far out things and she has called her on it and said she did not like it. But she has not done any worse than his own father has in keeping them apart. Liam says if she will listen she can almost hear Psycho music playing in the background. Hope says no, she is not that bad. Liam says all he is trying to do is make sure she is safe and in good hands. Then he goes into a tirade of all that Quinn has done to push Steffy between them. He chastises Hope for always falling for what Quinn does. Neither her or her son should be in Hope's life or in her company and he will not stop until they are gone.",
        "Liam leaves and runs into Charlie talking to Pam. Liam thanks him for trying to help with the boutique footage. He asks again if Charlie is sure there is nothing on those tapes. Charlie spies Quinn listening behind a potted plant and tells Liam no nothing revealing. Wyatt escorts Hope outside to see his surprise. It's an Airstream motor home, like a big old Silver Bullet. He points out that it is completely air conditioned and heated, has full bathroom, beds with pillowtop mattresses, furnished kitchen .no sleeping on the ground here. She says she feels like she is getting to know what he must have been like as a little boy on Christmas morning. He tells her he always wanted one, so now he finds himself with a little extra cash. And the most important part is that he has someone to share it with. She jokes that guess his mother didn't want to go along. He said no, it wasn't that but camping is about getting away from everything \u0096 work and family and mothers. It's about freedom, going to beautiful places like beaches, the woods, or the desert. He's ready to christen this bad boy. He's enthusiastic and begs her to please come just for a few days or a week just the two of them. He says she needs to live the dream. He kisses her."

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Be careful. Sounds like a great opportunity. Free accommodations courtesy of dear, old dad, but there are always hidden costs, and I don't want you indebted to him.",
        "Wyatt: You didn't mind me living rent-free above our warehouse.",
        "Quinn: I wanted you close, that's all.",

        "Quinn: But?",
        "Wyatt: But a guy's got to keep his options open. I love you, but having a place with a little bit of privacy is not such a bad idea now that I have a girlfriend.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] Girlfriend? Are we using that term now?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. Yeah. Did -- I'm trying it out, okay? Don't look at me like -- come on! Ah! I mean, spending all that time with her in Hawaii and growing closer... I don't know. It's only appropriate, right?",
        "Quinn: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Why are you so giddy!",

        "Pam: Charlie, what are you doing here?",

        "Pam: You are? Charlie, that's great!",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah. A special assignment. You know, with, uh, all the new gems in the house, Mr. Forrester didn't want to spread his guards too thin, so old Hawkeye here is gonna keep an eye on the emeralds.",

        "Wyatt: [Laughs] It might be arriving now, okay? I think my girlfriend might even like it more than a necklace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I got to say it. I -- Quinn is crazy.",
        "Hope: Okay. [Sighs] Quinn cares about her son.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs]",
        "Hope: And yes, she's gone to some, you know, extremes, and I-I hate that she's interfered, but is it any crazier than the things your dad put us through?",
        "Liam: I don't know. When my dad sticks his nose in, it's like a guy with an ego problem who doesn't know his boundaries. By comParison, he's easy to rein in.",
        "Hope: What?!",
        "Liam: Quinn --",
        "Hope: No!",
        "Liam: Quinn -- I hear the music from \"Psycho\" playing in the background! She is not right in the head, Hope. And both she and Wyatt are capable of a lot more than you realize.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Katie: Brooke thinks I should just forgive him, that I should just forget about what happened between the two of them. [Sighs] Part of me wants to do that. Part of me wants my life back. She acts like it should be easy. Maybe... maybe it should be. Maybe I should consider it for my son.",
        "Ridge: I realize it's a -- it's a big draw to put your family back together. I get that. And maybe I should try that with Brooke, and maybe you should try it with Bill, but...",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Before all that, I think we need to take our time, think about it. I know. How do I say that? I'm proud of you.",
        "Katie: Brooke -- [Sighs] Falls in love with such ease. And if one relationship doesn't work out, then it doesn't matter, because there's always someone waiting in the wings. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.",
        "Ridge: It's okay. I understand.",
        "Katie: In her mind, it all makes sense. I just go back to Bill. I forget about what happened, because that's what she would do. She would follow her heart. She doesn't think about the past. She doesn't concern herself with the future. She just lives in the present. Maybe it might be nice if all of us could live like that.",
        "Ridge: \"Desiring this man's art and that man's scope, with what I most enjoy contented least.\"",
        "Katie: \"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising...\"",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Katie: Sonnet 29. I think this guy named Shakespeare wrote it. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: \"Haptly I think on thee, and then my state... like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate. For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings that then I scorn to change my state with kings.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Are you going to tell me what the surprise for Hope is?",
        "Wyatt: I'll show you. It should be arriving soon.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Well, I have to say I am a little bit offended.",
        "Wyatt: What? Why?",
        "Quinn: Because I design jewelry for a living, and I assume my son would come to me if he was going to have somebody design --",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no, no, no! It's not jewelry, Mom. No. I-it -- trust me. If I need that certain kind of ring, I will definitely come to you for advice.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: If only Ricardo would give me the Hope for the Future diamond. I mean, that rock on her finger. [Whistles]",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, she wouldn't be able to lift her hand. But here's the thing. I've been meaning to talk to you about the diamond and the heist.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Pam: Um, excuse me. Wyatt, I just got a call from Security about a delivery for you.",
        "Wyatt: Perfect! Yes! I'll be right down. Thank you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: Come with me. I think she'll like this surprise, but maybe I should get a woman's opinion, huh?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Yes, Quinn made some bad decisions. She did, but I called her out on it, because I'm not going to put up with that kind of interference, especially if Wyatt and -- and -- and I...",
        "Liam: What? Stay together? Get married? I mean, is that what you want? Do you want a life with him?",
        "Hope: I don't know.",
        "Liam: Am I gonna drive myself crazy trying to fix this thing between us?",
        "Hope: I don't know, Liam! I don't know! I'm not trying to see the future! This is too much.",
        "Liam: No. It's really not. It's so simple.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Steffy showed up on our wedding day. That was beyond either of our control. I sent her away, and I haven't spoken to her since. Quinn and Wyatt are trying to convince you that Steffy is this huge governing force in my life, this connection that I can't break. Well, if that's true, how come Quinn has to manipulate every situation in order to make Steffy a problem?",
        "Hope: Quinn didn't make that video.",
        "Liam: No, she didn't. I did. Steffy asked for it, I made it, I sent it off, and I was done with it. I never even gave it a second thought until Quinn dredged it up again. Hope, do you honestly think that I was sitting around our house making videos for Steffy, pining away for her while we were planning a wedding?",
        "Hope: No, no.",
        "Liam: Did I have anything to do with Steffy coming to LA?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Liam: Anything to do with her showing up at the house or the cabin?",
        "Hope: No, no, I know it was Quinn, but it doesn't change how I feel.",
        "Liam: It is insane the lengths this woman will go to in order to drive Steffy between us! And you fall for it every single time! One look at Steffy, and you're running away to Hawaii with Wyatt. It's not right. They shouldn't be in our lives. They shouldn't be in your life. They shouldn't be in your company. And I will not stop... [Sighs] Until I've convinced you of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] Oh! Yes!",
        "Quinn: This is Hope's kind of thing?",
        "Wyatt: Well, maybe not yet. But look at it. Quality time with me, adventure, romance. How could she resist? [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Katie: Did Ridge Forrester just quote Shakespeare to me?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Wow.",
        "Ridge: Come on. Don't make fun of me. I had a lot of time on my hands in Paris.",
        "Katie: You must have had a lot of time on your hands. Is this, um, a new hobby?",
        "Ridge: Hobby? No. It's -- I just always liked language and words and the way... not right now, but usually. [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Well, um, I have been a big fan of poetry for all my life. [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Well, then, you're way ahead of me. I've got a lot to learn.",
        "Katie: About poetry?",
        "Ridge: About poetry. And everything else -- relationships and love and life and all of it.",
        "Katie: Oh, boy. Relationships. [Chuckles] Sorrow and love and passion and longing.",
        "Ridge: Passion? That's the one that always gets me in trouble.",
        "Katie: [Clears throat] Thank you.",
        "Ridge: For what?",
        "Katie: For making time for me. For bringing me here. I get myself all worked up, and I-I get obsessed with Brooke and Bill. And it... it hurts all over again. Thank you for reminding me that sometimes being with a friend makes all the difference.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Hi.",
        "[Quinn spies on them]",
        "Pam: Okay. I think I know what's going on. I think that maybe I shouldn't have told you about my past. But I just -- I like you, Charlie. And I don't think I should be keeping things from you.",
        "Charlie: No, no, no, no. I-I-it's like I told you before. I mean, everybody has a past. I-it's just that I'm more concerned about the present.",
        "Pam: Okay. If you're sure. I remember what it was like to be on the wrong side of the law, and it's much better on your side.",
        "Charlie: [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: Besides, I-I kind of like a guy in uniform. [Chuckles] Wouldn't want to mess things up.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Liam: Oh, hey, Charlie.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Pam: Hey.",
        "Charlie: Liam.",
        "Liam: Hey, you know, thanks for, um, helping me out before.",
        "Charlie: Sure, I'm sorry it, uh, you know, didn't led to anything.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're -- you're sure, right? There was nothing on the security footage?",
        "Charlie: [Glances over at Quinn] Uh, like I said, sorry.",
        "Liam: It's all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: All right. Are they closed?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Yes, they're closed.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, a little farther.",
        "Hope: What are we doing?",
        "Wyatt: Just say you'll do it.",
        "Hope: Uh...",
        "Wyatt: Say it!",
        "Hope: What is it?!",
        "Wyatt: It's a surprise!",
        "Hope: Are we bungee jumping?",
        "Wyatt: No, no. Nothing scary. It's just you and me together, cozy weekends away, spending time by the lake or the mountains, stuff like that. Okay, you can open them. Huh? I mean, check this baby out! I mean, this is camping in style! Air conditioning and heat and a full kitchen. Two of the burners work. I don't know about the other ones, but why would we need more, right? There's a shower and a bed. You're not sleeping on the ground. There's a pillow-top mattress.",
        "Hope: Ohh. [Looks at the vintage silver Airstream travel trailer]",
        "Wyatt: And check out these wheels -- aluminum. Made out of the same material as the exterior.",
        "Hope: Wow.",
        "Wyatt: Right?",
        "Hope: I feel like I have a really good insight to you as a little boy on Christmas morning.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: Well, I've always wanted one of these, and I've never had the money to get one. And for the first time in my life, I got a little extra cash. But most importantly, someone to go along with for the ride.",
        "Hope: Your mom never wanted to go with you?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God! No! Camping is about getting away from everything -- work and family and mothers. And it's about freedom. And it's just going to beautiful places, like the beaches or the woods or the desert. I'm thinking of christening this bad boy with a little surfing safari.",
        "Hope: Ohh.",
        "Wyatt: So, what do you think? Ready to head to the coast?",
        "Hope: I... I mean, I-I don't know.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on! Look, just let's -- let's get away, all right, for a little while. Like, for a few days or -- or maybe a week, just us. Come on. What do you say? Live the dream, baby! Come on!",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "[They kiss]",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Hmm? No?",
        "Hope: Uh..."
