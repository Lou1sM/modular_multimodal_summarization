Quinn vows that Brooke will pay the consequences for meddling in her marriage to Eric."], "Recap": ["At the Forrester mansion, Brooke continues to insist that Eric get rid of Quinn and Shauna. Quinn is indignant that Brooke would dare ask her husband to kick her out. Eric says that while he's disappointed that Quinn smacked Brooke to the ground, he loves his wife and isn't going to get rid of her. Later, Quinn brings Eric a martini and tries to make peace. Eric suggests that she be the bigger person and leave Brooke alone, and leave her marriage alone, too. Quinn visits Shauna, still steaming mad at Brooke. She declares that she has to get rid of Brooke once and for all. At Forrester Creations, Sally has just kissed Wyatt in her office, wearing sexy lingerie. She tells him how much she loves him and that they have to do a better job of making time for each other. Wyatt tells Sally about Katie's asking everyone to forgive Flo and how he still loves Flo. She can't believe that he's dumping her again for Flo. Sally rants and raves about how stressful her job is. She insists that they love each other and that he made a commitment. She tells him that she's not going to let him do this to her again, and then she leaves, to give him time to think.", "At Spencer, Katie thanks Bill again for allowing Katie to ask everyone for forgiveness for Flo. Bill admits that he can't really forgive her for what she did. Flo arrives and thanks them again for what they said. She tells them that she and Wyatt are probably going to be back together again. Bill wonders what happened to Sally, so Flo tells him that Wyatt is there now to tell her the bad news. Bill admits that he isn't a big fan of Sally's, but Flo hopes that he will one day see how much she loves Wyatt and become a fan of hers. Later, Brooke visits Katie to tell her about Shauna kissing Ridge. She thinks Quinn is behind all of it. Katie is appalled. Brooke declares war on Shauna and Quinn, the \"sluts from the desert.\""], "Recap Author": "Suzanne", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Brooke: You've settled too long, eric. I get that you were lost and devastated when stephanie died, but quinn has taken advantage.", "Quinn: Did no such thing.", "Brooke: Enough of this travesty. You can do so much better than this she- devil.", "Shauna: Oh, my god, are you really saying these things?", "Brooke: Open your eyes, eric, please. Quinn has taken advantage. She tricked you into marriage. She wanted you to believe that she was oh, such a great person. But she proved that she's not the second she hit me down to the ground.", "Shauna: Only after you slapped me first.", "Brooke: Shut up! Stay out of it.", "Shauna: Wow.", "Brooke: She's another one. You are so kind to let her stay in your guesthouse, and how does she repay your hospitality? By going after ridge, by undermining my marriage, kissing him, with your wife's blessing, no less.", "Quinn: Oh, my god.", "Brooke: They both have to go, eric. They don't belong here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Hmm. That kiss was just the beginning of me showing you how much I missed you. I hope you've got all night because this could take a while.", "Wyatt: Oh, uh, sally, um...", "Sally: Mm. It feels so good being in your arms.", "Wyatt: Sally.", "Sally: Shh. Please don't talk. I just want to be in this moment with you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I'm really happy with the way things went today. I know that you're not all in when it comes to flo, but I appreciate that you allowed us to offer forgiveness without commentary.", "Bill: All right, look, I'm not the forgiveness police. I'm just concerned that if you and will, donna, wyatt, you put your faith in flo and it turns out she's incapable of living up to it, you're gonna be very disappointed.", "Katie: You really doubt her that much?", "Bill: Uh-huh. Flo has said a lot of words since she got busted, but I can't forgive what she did. She participated in keeping beth, my granddaughter, from her family for months, katie.", "[ Knock on door ]", "Katie: Oh. Come in. Oh. Hi. Did you forget something?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Flo: I just feel like I didn't get to properly thank you. Maybe it's because I don't really know how, but, um, your acceptance and your support really does mean everything to me. I think it could actually be changing my life right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Uh, let's, uh, sit for a second.", "Sally: All right.", "Wyatt: Um, ahem...", "Sally: Look, we have to do better. Personally, I mean. Okay? We've both been so busy that we have been neglecting this-- sitting alone together at the end of a day... me half dressed... or half naked, whichever you prefer.", "Wyatt: [ Chuckles ]", "Sally: No, but we-- we need to make us a priority again. Look, I know-- I know that you were annoyed about my little slip-up-- me calling you liam-- but I swear to you that is all that it was. Any feelings that I had for your brother are fleeting and long gone. You're the only man who has my heart.", "Wyatt: Sally.", "Sally: Sorry. I'm--I'm not letting you get a word in.", "Wyatt: No, it's--it's, uh, it's fine. I just, um... oh, geez.", "Sally: What? Why do I have a feeling I'm not gonna like what you're about to say?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Quinn had the audacity to call herself the real forrester matriarch, as if she could ever, ever compare herself to stephanie. I mean, it would be laughable if it wasn't so pathetic. Eric, you have to stop defiling your real wife's memory and put an end to this sad excuse of a marriage.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Who do you think you are? You don't have any say in my relationship.", "Eric: All right, stop, both of you. Both-- you're both way off base here. Brooke, I understand how upsetting it was for you to learn that ridge and shauna were sharing kisses and whatever out in the guesthouse. Make no mistake, I wasn't very happy about that, either. But what I really wasn't happy about is that quinn knocked you to the floor in here. I was appalled by that.", "Quinn: You're only gonna see what I did?", "Eric: Let me talk to brooke. For you to suggest-- no, for you to demand that I end my marriage-- that's not gonna happen, brooke. No matter what you say about quinn, I love her. And nothing that happened here today is gonna change that.", "Quinn: Thank you, eric. And now that we've established the lady of the house, don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Flo: For the first time in a long time, I am feeling really optimistic about my life here. What you said really had an effect on wyatt, and I love him so much, and I know he feels the same way about me, and it-- it looks like we might be getting back together.", "Bill: What about sally?", "Flo: He's, uh, over there right now telling her that we want to be together.", "Bill: I want wyatt to be happy, and I've never been a big sally fan.", "Flo: I know you're also not a very big flo fan, but I intend to change that, once you see just how much I love your son.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Okay. I was at my dad's earlier, and katie asked the whole family to get together and invited flo to join us.", "Sally: Why would she do that?", "Wyatt: Well, uh, after the transplant and, uh, katie's new lease on life, I think she's apparently all about forgiveness, and she extended that to flo and asked the rest of us to join her. And just, I don't know, when I stopped to think about it, I realized that I was already there.", "Sally: Great. Good for you. Good for flo. But I really don't understand what any of that has to do with us.", "Wyatt: Uh...", "Sally: She coughed up a kidney. Good for her. Forgive her. But, I mean, that's-- that's as far as it went. Right?", "Wyatt: Ah, [ Muttering ], I don't even know how to say this.", "Sally: What?", "Wyatt: You... you are a beautiful person. All right? You are talented. I have loved spending every moment with you, every minute.", "Sally: Wait a second. Why are you talking in past tense?", "Wyatt: Oh, god, I'm so sorry. I S... I still love flo.", "Sally: No.", "Wyatt: I don't know. I'm just--uh... I j--I want to try and--and make it-- make it work with her again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: You haven't earned the right to kick me out of here.", "Quinn: Would you like to put that to the test?", "Eric: All right, all right, stop, both of you. Look, I'm not gonna have you going at each other like this. When am I gonna have some peace in this family?", "Brooke: Eric, get rid of the squatters already-- thomas, quinn, shauna.", "Eric: Yeah, well, obviously that's not gonna happen. But some coexistence could. A little civility and tolerance, maybe.", "Quinn: Would you like to what, mix up a round of drinks so that we can all-- oh. That's right. Brooke is an alcoholic, so she can't toast to that.", "Brooke: Wow. I mean, eric, she proves me right every time she opens her big mouth. She has desperately tried to get us to see that she's not that dangerous woman that committed all of those awful acts. But I believe that she's been in there all along. Let me tell you something. I will fight with everything I have to protect eric from you, just as I will fight to protect my marriage from this one.", "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Well, I'm warning you, brooke. You don't know the meaning of the word fight until you tangle with me. So back off or suffer the consequences. Tired of clean clothes that just don't smell clean?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: You are dumping me for flo. Again.", "Wyatt: I--I am so sorry.", "Sally: You're sorry?", "Wyatt: I know that's not nearly enough.", "Sally: Oh, my god. Are you freaking kidding me right now? Is this some kind of joke?", "Wyatt: I-- you have every right to be angry with me.", "Sally: Yeah. Hell, yeah. I do. And I don't need your permission.", "Wyatt: Look, I never meant to hurt you. You've got to believe that.", "Sally: Okay. Fine. Then it's simple. Don'T. All right? This really is too much, wyatt, as if things didn't suck enough already. I've been designing for steffy, living and breathing it for months, and it might all be for nothing. Okay? There's a very real possibility that the line might get canned. I might get canned. How much, seriously, am I supposed to lose?", "Wyatt: Sally.", "Sally: What? No. I am not-- I'm not gonna let you leave. Okay? I did that once, and it was a mistake. You came back to me. You love me. That is what you said.", "Wyatt: I do, but flo and I--", "Sally: I don't want to hear her name. Okay? Your pride is hurt because I called you liam. I get it. But you will get over it. Okay? We're engaged. We made a commitment to each other.", "Wyatt: W-where are you going?", "Sally: I am going to give you some time to get your head on straight. Because if you think you're gonna casually dump me for flo, no. Not again. Not this time. I'm not gonna let you leave me that easy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Door closes ]", "Katie: Uh, what's going on? Your text sounded urgent.", "Brooke: Yeah, well, um, ridge and I spoke earlier, and you know we're still trying to work things out. But he didn't file the divorce papers yet.", "Katie: Well, that's good, right?", "Brooke: Yeah. But he told me something today. Shauna's been kissing my husband.", "Katie: [ Scoffs ]", "Brooke: Yeah.", "Katie: Oh, I don't understand why ridge would be kissing shauna when clearly he's still in love with you. I mean, is he trying to make you jealous?", "Brooke: I wouldn't put this all on ridge. It's shauna, too. I mean, she's living right across the courtyard from him. And he's there. He's alone. He's at loose ends. She saw an opportunity, and she pounced. I mean, she is completely inappropriate, katie, just like her bestie.", "Katie: You think quinn is involved in this?", "Brooke: Oh, god. Yes. I am convinced that quinn engineered all of this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I come bearing gifts.", "Eric: I accept. This does not let you off the hook, though. I'm angry with you.", "Quinn: I wasn't the only one in this fight with brooke.", "Eric: You're not the one who ended up on the floor. I can't believe you did that to her.", "Quinn: Okay, first of all, brooke started it when she slapped shauna. And please don't make excuses for her. She was assassinating my character, attacking our marriage, and demanding that you throw my best friend out of here. Brooke's finally lost her damn mind, and I'm not gonna let her attack everything that I hold dear without fighting for it. And frankly, you should be encouraging me.", "Eric: What, to fight with brooke all the time? The two women I care most about in the whole world? Why would I encourage that?", "Quinn: Stop making this out to be all my fault. Brooke is the one who came in here screaming and yelling like a loon.", "Eric: Then be the bigger person.", "Quinn: Ohh.", "Eric: Don't let her get under your skin. And do not-- and this is important-- do not interfere in her marriage. You and shauna need to stay out of ridge and brooke's life. Is that understood? This is great.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: You really think quinn is engineering kisses between shauna and ridge?", "Brooke: Shauna and quinn are matching sluts from the desert.", "Katie: Wow.", "Brooke: They've been scheming together for decades over pennies. Now look. Quinn is living large with eric in his grand mansion. Oh, and surprise, surprise. She happened to move in her best friend into eric's guesthouse, and now shauna is going after ridge. Look, I know that you want to forgive flo because of the transplant. But these vegas women, they cannot be trusted. You know that quinn hates me, right?", "Katie: Well, I don't think she's fond of any of us.", "Brooke: Well, you're lucky she's not aiming shauna at your relationship.", "Katie: Do you really think that's what she's doing?", "Brooke: I'm positive. That's why I told eric to kick both of them out of there.", "Katie: Quinn and shauna? Quinn is eric's wife.", "Brooke: Well, then she should act like it. She should be loyal to the family, not trying to slide shauna into my rightful position next to ridge. I mean, it's disgusting. Quinn hit me.", "Katie: What?", "Brooke: Yeah, she did. She knocked me to the ground.", "Katie: Oh, my god.", "Brooke: I mean, she's as demented and as crazy as she's ever been.", "Katie: Are you okay? Did she hurt you?", "Brooke: No, I'm--I'm okay. I just-- I wanted eric to know the kind of woman that he was married to. So I didn't hold back.", "Katie: Well, I don't-- I really don't know what to say.", "Brooke: Ridge and i have been struggling lately. We've been fighting these obstacles because of everything that's been going on with thomas. And now quinn and shauna, they want to try to destroy my relationship, too? No. No, there is no way. I'm not gonna let that happen. Quinn really thinks that she can move shauna in and she will become the next mrs. Ridge forrester. There's no way in hell, katie. Quinn and I are at war. This is war.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Here you go.", "Shauna: I still can't believe brooke slapped me.", "Quinn: Ha!", "Shauna: If she hadn't taken me completely by surprise--", "Quinn: I knocked her down so you didn't have to. Can you imagine how fast she would have gone to ridge with that, making you out to be the crazy one?", "Shauna: She's got some nerve, I'll give her that.", "Quinn: That woman coming into my living room saying that stuff about us. She's lucky all I did was knock her down. See how she fell to her knees like a wuss?", "Shauna: It was priceless.", "Quinn: The look on your face was priceless.", "Shauna: Well, come on. I wasn't expecting us to get into a brawl with brooke.", "Quinn: [ Laughs ]", "Shauna: Definitely felt like the old days.", "Quinn: Oh, she has no idea who she's messing with.", "Shauna: No. But she will find out soon enough.", "Quinn: Yeah. The thing is... eric was really, really upset with this altercation. He wasn't lying.", "Shauna: Yeah, but ultimately he did stand up for you.", "Quinn: Yeah, this time. But brooke is right. She and eric have a very special relationship, and she's gonna use it. I'm gonna need to stay on my toes.", "Shauna: Well, I mean, you're right. You have to protect and defend your territory.", "Quinn: I can't believe that woman was looking down her nose at us.", "Shauna: I know. Please. Like brooke didn't come from the wrong side of town?", "Quinn: Really? Like she didn't work her way into this family on her back? She's such a hypocrite.", "Shauna: She is.", "Quinn: [ Sighs ] I wonder if ridge finally sees her for who she really is, you know? Maybe--maybe that's why he's looking for somebody more authentic and why he's drawn to you.", "Shauna: Maybe. I mean, but brooke's also been tearing thomas down, knowing it's just pushing ridge away. I mean, I don't understand that, alienating the man you're supposed to love. Whatever. I just want to support ridge as much as I can.", "Quinn: And that's why he prefers your company. [ Sighs ] The gall of that woman coming in here, trying to dictate who can stay in this house. You are gonna stay here for as long as you damn well please, and no one's gonna keep you away from ridge. And I am not going to let that woman mess with my marriage.", "Shauna: I know that tone. What's going on in that head of yours?", "Quinn: Don't you worry about a thing. Brooke isn't going to mess with us anymore. I guarantee it because I'm gonna take care of brooke logan once and for all."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLX4-PEZOVs"}
