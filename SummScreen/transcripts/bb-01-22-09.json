        "Rick asks Steffy not to give up on them. Nothing is impossible. She wishes they could just have one normal day so they didn't have to sneak around their families. He declares he will not let that define his life. That is not who he is or the guy she fell in love with. Eric asks Thorne, Brooke and Felicia if anyone has heard anything about the Jackie M showing. Perhaps they should check with Katie as she must have a front row seat. Katie does know and she tears into Nick for stealing the designs. She can not believe someone at Forrester would deliberately try to sabotage the company by sending him the designs. He tells her that he even thought it was her. He didn't like doing it, but he was not going to lose his company and his family. She claims this is wrong and he needs to go out there and set it straight. Katie calls Eric and tells him all his designs have been hi-jacked. Jackie M stole every one of them.",
        "Rick promises Steffy that he has a plan and they will be together, just trust him. Eric arrives at Jackie M's just as the gorgeous showstopper is on the runway. Then he is shocked when each and every model steps forward showcasing his entire collection. As the electricity abodes backstage with Jarrett praising Clark and his inspiration, Nick gets a text message from Stormy Seas. He is in his office and it's time to pay the piper. Eric will not keep his voice down and he slams Jackie for stealing his designs. He would have helped her if she needed help. They are competitors, not enemies. But she will not profit from his work. Jackie claims she stole nothing from him. Eric says she did and just watch him prove it. Silently Nick makes his way in the dark to his office and the great mystery is solved. \"My God, it's you.\""

        "Jackie: Oh, my--you're on. You're on. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Go. (Sighs)",
        "Katie: I cannot believe this.",
        "Jarrett: Truly unbelievable, genius. It's a triumph for Jackie M.",
        "Katie: Where's Nick?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: What? Not deal with my dad? Now you're talking crazy. How could that ever be? What--do you want to run away or something?",
        "Rick: What? No, no, not--that's my point. I want to be here with you and--and build a future with you.",
        "Steffy: Well, that's impossible. Everything-- everyone is against us.",
        "Rick: Will you stop saying \"Impossible\"? I told you, I don't believe in that word. Steffy, you just have to trust me, okay? Please, don't give up on us, okay?",
        "Eric: Look, as far as I'm concerned, keeping this collection under wraps was a very good idea.",
        "Felicia: Give Donna a gold star.",
        "Brooke: We should make some calls, 'cause Jackie M. is making a huge desperation move today, and we don't want them eating up all the coverage.",
        "Eric: It's going on right now. Has anybody heard anything?",
        "Felicia: Call Katie. I'm sure she has a front-row seat.",
        "Brooke: She's supporting Nick.",
        "Thorne: Our P.R. Rep-- that looks great.",
        "Brooke: He's her fianc\u00e9, and she happens to be concerned. Clarke hasn't designed an original line in ages. I mean, it could be a disaster.",
        "Eric: Well, we've all heard the rumors, and Katie's about to marry into a family on the verge of financial collapse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: (Speaking inaudibly) (voices speaking indistinctly)",
        "Katie: Nick, Nick, I need to talk to you.",
        "Jackie: Excuse me, we're in the middle of our show.",
        "Katie: Your show? That's our show, Forrester Creations'. Those are Eric's designs...",
        "Nick: In here, please.",
        "Katie: Every one of them. You stole them.",
        "Jackie: We did no such thing.",
        "Nick: Mother, please go back to the show and let me handle this.",
        "Katie: I've seen Eric's collection, and now thanks to your mother and Clarke, the rest of the world has seen it, too. Those are Forrester designs, every one of them.",
        "Clarke: There's a problem?",
        "Katie: Bravo, Clarke, bravo. Sally would have been so proud.",
        "Jackie: We can't do this here.",
        "Katie: You knew about this? You did.",
        "Nick: Could I have a minute, please? Thank you.",
        "Katie: You stole those designs from Forrester Creations.",
        "Nick: I didn't steal them.",
        "Katie: Well, then where the hell did they come from?",
        "Nick: I don't know.",
        "Katie: Well, they didn't fall out of the sky, Nick. Please tell me how our collection ended up being your preview show, and I'd like the truth, because the man I know, the man I love, would never have done something like this.",
        "Nick: I got an e-mail, and I opened it. (Sighs) It was anonymous.",
        "Katie: Someone sent you our designs?",
        "Nick: Someone who had access.",
        "Katie: Inside Forrester.",
        "Nick: I didn't steal them. It was from somebody pretty high up the food chain.",
        "Katie: That's sabotage. Someone at Forrester's trying to destroy the company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I believe in you. I believe in what we have together. It's just that--",
        "Rick: It's just that what? What--what's your hang-up?",
        "Steffy: (Sighs) I just want to have one normal day, you know?",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: Just one perfect day, just you and me as a regular couple, not having to sneak around and--and hide from our families, but that can never happen, and that's the hang-up. (Sighs) sometimes love isn't enough. (Scoffs) we're not kids anymore, right? We're smart enough to know not every fantasy can come true no matter how much you want it to be.",
        "Rick: Do you really expect me to believe that? Steffy, I refuse to let the circumstances in my life control me. It's not who I am, and that's not the guy you fell in love with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Wonderful. You were wonderful, wonderful. Darling, you're on. Quick, quick, quick, go, go. Be great, please. Be great. (Sighs) (cheers and applause)",
        "Jackie: Oh, God. Oh, God, do you hear that? (Laughs) Oh, they adore it. They adore it.",
        "Clarke: W-we did it. We're back.",
        "Jackie: We're back. We're back, but for how long?",
        "Nick: We can discuss this as much as you'd like, but we cannot do it here.",
        "Kat: Oh, I'm not interested in discussing anything. I want it stopped. I want you to go out there and admit what you did.",
        "Nick: I accepted a gift is what I did.",
        "Katie: Huh.",
        "Nick: The e-mail said, \"To keep you afloat.\" Now it's very obvious what the sender expected me to do.",
        "Katie: You think someone is trying to help you, but really, you're just helping them, especially if the e-mail came from someone inside of Forrester.",
        "Nick: I thought it was you.",
        "Katie: Me?",
        "Nick: You knew we were in the red. You said you would do anything to help us, but then I talked to you, and obviously, you had nothing to do with it.",
        "Katie: But it wasn't so obvious, because you thought I was involved, and when the Forresters find out what you did, they're gonna think the same thing.",
        "Nick: You have nothing to worry about. You're innocent.",
        "Katie: The company is on the verge of civil war, Stephanie and her children against my family. Who do you think they're gonna blame for this?",
        "Nick: I did what I had to do. You were there when the banker came by our home. Now I'm not gonna risk my family losing everything. I'm not gonna be able to live with that.",
        "Katie: Well, why don't we rob a liquor store or a bank? I mean, if we're gonna be thieves, let's be thieves.",
        "Nick: I'm not a thief, and you know it.",
        "Katie: I don't know what I know. I'm not sure I know you. There's no justification for this. Whatever someone sent you, whatever you did with it-- it was wrong. It--it's not going to save Jackie M., And it could tear Forrester Creations apart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Trust me, nothing happening at Jackie's showing can have any impact on us at all.",
        "Brooke: That's right. We are in a completely different universe.",
        "Eric: Exactly right. Send her in, will you? What Clarke can do and what we can do-- there is absolutely no comparison.",
        "Stephanie: Oh!",
        "Eric: No comparison at all.",
        "Brooke: Oh, great.",
        "Stephanie: This is wonderful.",
        "Eric: Look at this.",
        "Stephanie: How about that? Wonderful.",
        "Eric: Oh, thank you. That's beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Let me see. Let me see.",
        "Clarke: Mm.",
        "Jackie: It's beautiful. It is beautiful, right. Um, uh, Courtney--no, Nadine-- no, gorgeous Cressin, quick, quick, come here. Get the showstopper on. It's almost time. Hurry, hurry, hurry. (Sighs) did you see where they went?",
        "Clarke: Nick and Katie? No.",
        "Jackie: (Sighs) I hope he managed to calm her down.",
        "Clarke: And if he didn't?",
        "Jackie: Well, then she's on her way back to Forrester.",
        "Clarke: And what should we do?",
        "Jackie: Get the press out the door and get the checks in the bank.",
        "Katie: Brooke, it's me. I-I'm at the Jackie M. Show. I've gotta tell Eric something.",
        "Brooke: Eric's right here. What's going on?",
        "Katie: Our collection has been hijacked.",
        "Stephanie: What?",
        "Eric: What do you mean?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Eric. All your designs just debuted on the Jackie M. Runway. They stole every one of them.",
        "Eric: Stay right there.",
        "Brooke: (Sighs)",
        "Eric: I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Upbeat music playing )",
        "Rick: You know what I believe? I believe that there is not a problem in this world that exists without a solution. You just have to look for it.",
        "Steffy: Mm. So then you're saying you have a solution for us?",
        "Rick: I have. Let's just say that I am a man who can make things happen. (Chuckles)",
        "Steffy: Oh, really?",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: Well, then aren't you my hero?",
        "Rick: I have a plan, and it's gonna change everything.",
        "Steffy: What are you talking about?",
        "Rick: When all is said and done, I promise you that you will know how much I love you and how I would do anything and everything for you and for us. We will be together. I promise you that.",
        "Rick: Do you believe me?",
        "Steffy: (Giggles)",
        "Rick: Do you?",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rick: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: (Sighs) We should have stopped him.",
        "Felicia: If Jackie stole my dad's designs, he has every right to confront her.",
        "Brooke: We don't know exactly what happened.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, leave it to you to suggest this whole thing could be some sort of accident.",
        "Brooke: Well, I can't believe that Nick would allow his mother to do something like that.",
        "Thorne: Oh, Nick's in on it, Brooke, you can bet on that.",
        "Felicia: Katie, too. Just because she's the one who sounded the alarm doesn't mean she didn't start the fire.",
        "Brooke: Wait, my family had nothing to do with this.",
        "Stephanie: I thought you just said you have no idea what happened.",
        "Brooke: I know that it wasn't my fault or my family's fault.",
        "Stephanie: Right. Thorne, is there some way someone could have hacked into the computer system?",
        "Thorne: Are you suggesting that this is my fault?",
        "Stephanie: No, honey, I'm not. I put the blame right where your father is. God, in this business we had for so many years, we used to know every single employee by their first name. Now we're surrounded with nothing but strangers, and so we've had to implement access codes and all this other stuff. My thought is if this collection has been stolen by Jackie, then I would think that... (sighs) she's probably had help from somebody inside.",
        "Brooke: Maybe somebody in this room.",
        "Felicia: Are you accusing yourself? I know you're not pointing the finger at us.",
        "Brooke: Your mother doesn't seem too shocked about the news.",
        "Stephanie: Actually, no, I'm not. I saw Jackie twice this week, and... (sighs) she was really desperate. Her business isn't gonna survive. She needs a line, and certainly nothing that Clarke could ever design. Without a really good line, there's no way that business is gonna survive.",

        "Man: (Whistles)",
        "Jarrett: Perfection, absolute perfection.",
        "Audience: (Cheering)",
        "Man: (Speaking inaudibly)",
        "Audience: (Cheering)",
        "Man: All right!",
        "Audience: (Cheering)",
        "Eric: What? It's--it's the whole collection.",
        "Audience: (Cheering)",
        "Man: Yeah! Wow. Fabulous.",
        "Audience: (Cheering)",
        "Man: Yeah!",
        "Audience: (Cheering) can happen in five years.",
        "Clarke: There we got it.",
        "Jackie: Oh, the bubbly.",
        "Clarke: Opa! Opa!",
        "Jackie: I am going first. I'm sorry. I need this. What a wonderful, wonderful show. Everybody, thank you.",
        "Jarrett: Electric-- that's the only way to describe the mood here at Jackie M. Designs. The collection is a triumph, each design more impressive than the last, and the showstopper-- oh, the embodiment of elegance, which, of course, is also a phrase that can describe this beautiful woman here... (chuckles) Jackie M.'s namesake and fearless leader Jackie Marone.",
        "Jackie: Oh, you cheeky boy, thank you.",
        "Jarrett: And, of course, the man of the hour, Clarke Garrison, the genius behind this astounding collection.",
        "Clarke: All right, genius, genius-- that's a little bit stiff. I-I consider myself a visionary.",
        "Jarrett: Ah. (Laughs) and--and what gave you the vision for this, uh, marvelous collection?",
        "Clarke: Well, inspiration is a-a mysterious thing, Jarrett.",
        "Jackie: Well--well, you can see the man's influences, of course. I mean, all those years working with Eric Forrester...",
        "Clarke: Yeah, as--as a matter of fact, I think you can see a little bit of Eric in every one of those designs.",
        "Jackie: Mm.",
        "Jarrett: Oh, yeah, but this is no mere homage. I mean, no. This--this--if this collection had previewed at Forrester, I would say it was the best work Eric had ever done.",
        "Jackie: (Chuckles)",
        "Clarke: (Chuckles) Uh, here, here you go, Jarrett.",
        "Jarrett: Oh, thank you.",
        "Clarke: (Chuckles) (cell phone buzzes) (indistinct conversations)",
        "Clarke: Let--let's--let's go talk about it, shall we?",
        "Woman: Wonderful.",
        "Jackie: Girls... (kissing sound) you were darling. I mean, everyone.",
        "Woman: Oh.",
        "Jackie: Your thanks is all mine. Really, you were brilliant. Oh, and your work-- oh, brilliant. Thank you.",
        "Woman: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: You stole my designs.",
        "Jackie: Uh, oh, Eric, Katie must have called you. I am so sorry. I can't imagine what she said. I-I tried to explain that these things can happen, you know, two different designers--",
        "Eric: Stop--stop it, Jackie. Stop it. Look, ridge and I have been working on this collection for months, honing every detail, every stitch, and you steal it?",
        "Jackie: Can you please keep your voice down?",
        "Eric: I will not. I want every--every reporter in this building to know what you've done.",
        "Jackie: Well, I would consult a lawyer before you do that, because slander is a serious offense.",
        "Eric: And what about industrial espionage? Doesn't that carry a pretty heavy-- heavy penalty, too?",
        "Jackie: (Groans)",
        "Eric: How did you do this? All of these designs were encrypted. All--all the patterns were under lock and key. What did you do, don some kind of a disguise and sneak around Forrester...",
        "Jackie: (Laughs)",
        "Eric: Like sally used to do? You think this is funny?",
        "Jackie: Me in a costume skulking around Forrester Creations-- yes, I think that is funny. Eric, no one-- no one from Jackie M. set foot in your offices, I swear it.",
        "Eric: How did you get this collection?",
        "Jackie: Those designs are Clarke Garrison Originals.",
        "Eric: They are not. Clarke Garrison has never designed anything this elegant in his entire career.",
        "Jackie: Until now. He's blossomed. Actually, I think he's come into his own.",
        "Eric: (Scoffs) You know, it actually made a lot of sense to me when you took over Sally's business when you bought her building.",
        "Jackie: (Scoffs)",
        "Eric: But I never thought that you would stoop to her level.",
        "Jackie: Yeah, well, sally never put out a collection like this.",
        "Eric: Yes, she did, every time she stole one from us, but it never made her a success. It turned her into a pariah. Is that what you want for yourself? God, Jackie, if you were in trouble, why didn't you come to me? I would have introduced you to bankers. I would have made it so easy. We're competitors, but we're not enemies.",
        "Jackie: Yet here you are treating me like one.",
        "Eric: Well, did you think I wouldn't hold you accountable, that I would come in here, and you would bat your eyelashes and I'd let you get away with it?",
        "Jackie: You know--",
        "Eric: That you can profit from my work?",
        "Jackie: There used to be a time when you were very susceptible to my charms, but that was before you became Mr. Honey bear.",
        "Eric: What? That cannot be what this is about, about my relationship with Donna.",
        "Jackie: No, it's not. This is business.",
        "Eric: Well, it was never just business with us, not before. You and I are friends.",
        "Jackie: Eric, I stole nothing from you.",
        "Eric: Yes, you did, and I'm gonna prove it. You watch me.",
        "(Door closes)",
