        "Deacon welcomes Brooke home. She says she knew he'd want to hear about Hope. She is doing as well as she can considering her marriage. This whole thing has had a profound effect on her. She is sure she will stay there for a while. She is surprised to hear about him and Quinn who suddenly comes in and tells Brooke that she must persuade Hope to come home with Wyatt. Ivy asks Liam just what does he have in mind for tonight. She appreciates that he stood up for her today. He has her back no matter what. Caroline explains to Ridge all Rick did. He wishes he had been there. She said she can handle it since she knows now he is not the husband she thought he was. Ridge says this sounds about right after all the things he has pulled over the years and always losing his temper. Now she does not have to be concerned with that anymore. Rick tells Maya that Caroline will get the divorce papers today and they can finally move on. Chris brings the papers and says there are no surprises. It is just as they planned. Maya tells him she will go home as Rick is coming home to a celebration tonight.",
        "Brooke says Hope can stay and come home any time she wants. Quinn says she does not like how Hope is handling this and Hope has more feelings other than her own to take into consideration. Ivy says she feels so safe and protected when she is with Liam, nothing can touch her. Rick signs the papers and Chris says he will file these. Before he leaves Rick takes a drink and opens his desk and takes out the gun and tells Chris to please get rid of it for him. He doesn't trust himself. Ridge helps Caroline with sketches but they can't keep their hands off each other. Brooke tells Quinn that all of this is her fault. She should not have come into her house and taunted Hope. She is going now. She says she knows it is difficult waiting but Hope is going to do what it takes to heal. Ivy and Liam cuddle on the couch and kiss. He says he will always stand up for her against being thrown in the river or being crushed by the CEO. She came into his life when he needed someone and he sees now life can be fun. He takes her hand and leads her upstairs. They kiss as they undress each other and he lays her on the bed. Dressed in a sexy red teddy, Maya opens the door thinking Rick forgot his key. It is a shaken Brooke who is dumbstruck. She finally says she recognizes her lingerie. Maya stammers that yes it came from her line. Maya tells her Rick is not home yet but will be soon. Brooke realizes Maya is actually living there. She comes on in and then spies Maya's portrait on the wall. She utters WTH. Maya tells her Stephanie's portrait is in the garage and will be back up when Eric comes home. Brooke says is needs to be put back up now. This is so disrespectful. Chris leaves and tells Rick that he will return when the papers are filed. He forgets the gun. Rick goes into the hallway trying to catch him but he is gone. Rick sees some movement behind a partially closed door and realizes it is Caroline and Ridge kissing on the couch. He fires three shots toward them."

        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Yeah, I know. It's kind of strange, isn't it?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Rick said what?",
        "Caroline: Every horrible thing he could possibly think of. I mean, about me, about the designs, about us. He yelled at Ivy when she started defending me.",
        "Ridge: I should have been there.",
        "Caroline: I can handle it. Especially now that I'm no longer hoping that he'll be the husband that he was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Well?",
        "Rick: \"Well,\" what?",
        "Maya: You cannot hint at a surprise and then not tell me what it is.",
        "Rick: Surprise? What surprise?",
        "Maya: Rick!",
        "Rick: Okay, there was one thing, but what was it? Oh, right! It was something you've been asking for.",

        "Rick: Kris is on his way over.",
        "Maya: Your attorney? Divorce papers?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: So, do you have any idea when Hope's gonna come back?",
        "Brooke: Doesn't seem like any time soon. This whole situation has had a profound effect on her. Hi.",
        "Deacon: Hey.",
        "Brooke: Uh...[Clears throat] Look, I can go if you two want to be alone.",
        "Quinn: No. No, no, no. No, please don't go. Uh, tell me about Hope. Did -- did she and Wyatt come home with you?",
        "Brooke: No. And, uh, I can't speak for Wyatt, but I'm pretty sure Hope's gonna stay there for a while.",
        "Quinn: She can't.",
        "Brooke: Excuse me?",
        "Quinn: Well, you -- you -- you have to get through to her, convince Hope to come home.",

        "Ivy: No, I want to toast to you.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Okay.",
        "Ivy: For, um, for everything you did for me today.",
        "Liam: Well, I put some flowers in a vase. It really wasn't too difficult.",
        "Ivy: No, no, not that. [Laughing] I'm talking about what you did for me at the Forrester office, standing up for me. I've seen this whole side to you before, the Liam hero.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: I mean, you jumped in after me into the seine. But it really -- it hit me today that you have my back no matter what. And I just -- I really want you to know that it goes both ways.",
        "Liam: Cheers to that.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Glasses clink]",

        "Rick: Kris. Hey, thanks for handling this.",
        "Kris: Of course. Hi, Maya.",
        "Maya: Hello.",
        "Rick: So, any surprises?",
        "Kris: Nope. Straightforward, just like we discussed. I do need you to sign on a few pages here.",
        "Maya: You okay?",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Maya: You don't have to pretend that ending your marriage is easy. You sign, and I'll get ready.",
        "Rick: Ready?",
        "Maya: Oh, you're coming home to a celebration tonight.",
        "Rick: All right. Let's get this over with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Rick asked if we kissed again.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: And my look totally gave it away.",
        "Ridge: Your look?",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: I shouldn't be surprised, really.",
        "Caroline: I mean, you would think that after the way he's been treating me and, you know, forcing himself to move on with Maya, but he lost it.",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Caroline: Oh, yeah. I mean, he yelled at everybody to get out of the meeting except for Ivy and me, and then he just laid into us.",
        "Ridge: I was hoping he'd grow up a little bit, but it's always been like that. He's always been angry. You don't need that. You don't deserve that. So, let him rant. Let him rage. Hmm.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: It doesn't concern you anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Hope can decide on her own when to come home.",
        "Quinn: Well, she has to think about somebody else besides herself. She has a husband.",
        "Deacon: He's over there with her. I mean, they're -- they're working through this together, babe.",
        "Quinn: Are they? Or -- or is she just shutting him out? She flew off to Europe, and she left Wyatt alone. If he hadn't gone after her, would -- would she have even been in touch with him? Does she think that her feelings are the only ones that matter here? I mean, come on. I don't like how Hope is handling this. I don't like how she's handling it at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Oh, this won't take too long to clean up.",
        "Liam: No, you're right. It won't take too long. In the morning.",
        "Ivy: Ooh.",
        "Liam: Hmm.",
        "Ivy: Leaving dirty dishes. How scandalous.",
        "Liam: I know.",
        "Ivy: Liam Spencer, my mum would never approve.",
        "Liam: Ah, your mom's in Australia. She doesn't have to know. Besides, maybe if we're lucky, Caroline will just take care of it when she gets home.",
        "Ivy: That's mean.",
        "Liam: Girl's got to earn her keep, okay?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, you're right. I guess she does kind of owe you. And not just for giving her a place to stay, but for defending her this afternoon in front of Rick. And -- and for defending me. I feel so safe and protected when I'm -- when I'm near you. I just feel like nothing can touch me when I'm by your side.",
        "Liam: Nothing?",
        "Ivy: Except you.",
        "Liam: Oh.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: All right. What's next?",
        "Kris: Well, I'll file these, and then I'll come back to serve her.",
        "Rick: Tonight?",
        "Kris: Yeah, there's still time. Listen, I'm sorry it ended up like this.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Me, too. Sure I can't pour you one?",
        "Kris: No, thanks.",
        "Rick: Luckily I don't mind drinking alone. [Chuckles] Hmm. There was one more thing. I'd like you to get rid of this for me.",
        "Kris: Nickel-plated snub nose? It's in great condition. That's yours?",
        "Rick: No, it, uh, it was Stephanie's.",
        "Kris: You want me to check her will and see who she left it to?",
        "Rick: No, no, I just want it gone.",
        "Kris: Why?",
        "Rick: Well, honestly, I don't trust myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: What'd he say about this one?",
        "Caroline: Oh, um, that one is \"not my best work.\"",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: That's the thing. He can't be objective anymore.",
        "Caroline: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Ridge: It's beautiful. Although, not to say that he's right, but what do you think about maybe dropping this down just a little bit in here?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. Yeah, uh --",
        "Ridge: Don't just say that because you think --",
        "Caroline: No, I-I do. Um, but if we do that, then we're gonna have to change the back.",
        "Ridge: It's too much work.",
        "Caroline: No, no. It's not. It's -- it's worth it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Stephanie kept it in her nightstand. Can you believe that? Risky. One martini too many, my dad could have been a goner.",
        "Kris: She didn't keep it loaded?",
        "Rick: No, no. No, but I found these. Do you know how to load that thing?",
        "Kris: Sure, I do. I hit the range once a month with my wife. In fact, she's almost as good as I am.",
        "Rick: Hmm. Nice.",
        "[Gun clicks]",
        "Kris: Pick a horse.",
        "Rick: You're not seriously thinking about --",
        "Kris: No. But I can hit any target.",
        "Rick: Does your wife have a birthday coming up?",
        "Kris: Our anniversary. You wouldn't really give this to me, would you?",
        "Rick: Oh, come on. Consider it a bonus for all the work you've been doing for me lately. Give it to your wife. Tell her happy anniversary. And tell her I'm glad there's an actual happily married couple still in existence.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You don't have any say in how Hope handles grieving the loss of her child.",
        "Quinn: I do if it affects my son.",
        "Brooke: If it weren't for you coming over to my house and confronting Hope the way you did, none of this would be happening! It's all your fault!",
        "Deacon: Look, could you just lay off, please?",
        "Brooke: I'm only telling the truth.",
        "Deacon: Okay, great. She's really messed up about this. She blames herself. She doesn't need to hear it from you.",
        "Brooke: I should go. I just wanted to come by, give you an update on Hope. [Sighs] I know it's difficult waiting. But Hope is going to do what she needs to do in order to recover. I'll let you know if there's any updates.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Can I tell you something?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: I'll always stand up for you. Against Rick or Maya or Quinn or anyone. I mean, I'll -- I'll -- I'll do whatever it takes. I'll jump into rivers. I'll shove C.E.O.s. because you... you're the one who came into my life and taught me that caring about a woman doesn't have to be a struggle and it doesn't have to be about overcoming obstacles all the time. I mean, you... reminded me... that love can be fun.",
        "Ivy: Well, it is when you find the right person. I think I found that person.",
        "Liam: I know I have. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Maya: Honey, did you forget your key? Coming. Hello-- ah.",

        "Brooke: Hi.",
        "Maya: You're back!",
        "Brooke: And you're... wearing my lingerie.",
        "Maya: Oh, um, yes. This is from your line.",
        "Brooke: Can I come in?",
        "Maya: Sure.",
        "Brooke: Uh, actually, I'm looking for Rick.",
        "Maya: He's not home yet.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I know. I was over there knocking on the guest house door, and nobody answered.",
        "Maya: Oh, no, no, we're living up here now.",
        "Brooke: \"We\"?",
        "Maya: Mm-hmm. Yeah, the guest house needed some renovations, so it's just until Eric gets back.",
        "Brooke: You and Rick? What the Hell? Where's Stephanie's picture?",
        "Maya: In the garage, I think. Um, Rick took it down.",
        "Brooke: Well, it needs to go back up. [Scoffs] What is this?",
        "Maya: It's just until Eric gets back.",
        "Brooke: What's going on? This is ridiculous. This is so disrespectful. What are you doing with my son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kris: Won't take long. I'll be right back after I file these in court.",
        "Rick: Thanks, Kris.",
        "Kris: See you soon.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",

        "Maya: They're having an affair.",
        "Caroline: I am so sorry.",
        "Maya: You need to know what is going on, what your wife is doing behind your back and on hers! The guilt is written all over her face!",
        "Rick: You can't keep secrets from me.",
        "Caroline: I am your wife. You are upset, and you have every right to be. I love you, and I broke your trust. Please forgive us.",
