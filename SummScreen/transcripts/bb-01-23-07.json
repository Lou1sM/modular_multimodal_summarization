        "Taylor: Nick, I understand your anger at the Forresters, the way they've treated you, and your mother. But, the way you're talking --",
        "Nick: Taylor. You know, I've made a lot of enemies recently and I'm probably going to make a lot more. It would be nice to know that I've got someone in my corner other than just my mother.",
        "Taylor: I'm engaged to Thorne.",
        "Nick: I'm well aware of that.",
        "Taylor: And we've talked about this before. Our friendship's a little complicated.",
        "Nick: Only if we complicate it, by what other people think.",
        "Taylor: It's going to be hard to ignore other people's concerns.",
        "Nick: Well, we just don't let those concerns get in our way of what we have. Which is fun. We have fun together.",
        "Taylor: Therapy was fun for you?",
        "Nick: But we could have fun. There's potential for fun.",
        "Taylor: I don't know. Up to this point, our conversations have been pretty serious.",
        "Nick: Look, just come to chuck's with me, will you? We'll go have lunch there. We'll relax. And get away from all of this and split a bucket of wings. What do you say?",
        "Taylor: That's fun?",
        "Nick: Other than the indigestion. Come on. I mean, nobody can say anything's wrong with two friends having lunch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Hey, Uncle Thorne?",
        "Thorne: Hey, Phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: Do you know where my mom when she left here?",
        "Thorne: I think she went to the office.",
        "Phoebe: I tried over there and she didn't answer.",
        "Thorne: Did you try her cell phone?",
        "Phoebe: Nobody answered.",
        "Thorne: Well, she's probably with a patient.",
        "Phoebe: I just -- I wanted to take Ally out for ice cream and I thought she would want to come with us, maybe.",
        "Thorne: Well, that's a good idea, but I think you two would probably have more fun on your own.",
        "Phoebe: I know. I just -- I thought that more time they spent together, the better it might get. I just, if she's working --",
        "Thorne: Well, that's very thoughtful of you. And I'm sure your mother would feel the same way.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, well, maybe if she calls, then she could meet us or something.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, if Captain Bligh doesn't kidnap her first.",
        "Thorne: Ridge, don't start that again, please.",
        "Ridge: Hey, he's done it once. Took Brooke, R.J., and Hope to some little deserted island somewhere.",
        "Brooke: Oh, he just took us camping. I forgot to call you.",
        "Phoebe: What are you talking about?",
        "Thorne: Your father's just trying to get my goat. And it's not working.",

        "Arthur: Hey guys!",
        "Brooke: Arthur! Come in.",
        "Arthur: I like the new place. Very impressive.",
        "Thorne: How are you?",
        "Brooke: Good to see you.",

        "Arthur: Yeah. I heard something like that.",
        "Ridge: Arthur, this is my daughter, Phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: Hi.",
        "Arthur: Oh, Eric wasn't kidding about this family business stuff. Well, you got R.J. down licking stamps in the mail room, too?",
        "Brooke: Well, not yet.",
        "Ridge: Phoebe is going to be doing some modeling for us.",
        "Arthur: Well, good for you. Way more exciting than licking stamps, trust me.",
        "Phoebe: I'm sure.",
        "Ridge: Arthur's father, whether you remember it or not -- when you were three years old, gave you this beautiful rocking horse.",
        "Brooke: How are you and your sisters doing since he passed?",
        "Arthur: The girls are fine, thanks. A little tougher for me, taking over the company.",
        "Thorne: Well, big shoes to fill.",
        "Arthur: Tell me about it. [Cell phone rings] It's me. I got to grab this. Could you excuse me --",
        "Phoebe: I should go get Ally, but tell Mr. Harrison I said good-bye.",
        "Ridge: All right.",
        "Thorne: Tell your mother I'll call her, okay?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah.",
        "Thorne: Ally may not be able to be around her, but I need to see her.",

        "Taylor: What?",
        "Nick: Everything.",
        "Taylor: Well, the last time we were here, it wasn't the best of times for either one of us.",
        "Nick: Well, look at us now.",
        "Taylor: Hmmm.",
        "Nick: Hmmm?",
        "Taylor: Yeah, we're moving on up in the world. You're on a rampage for revenge, and my wedding is indefinitely on hold because my fianc\u00e9e's daughter hates my guts for killing her mother. We're doing great. I don't know if a bar was a good idea.",
        "Nick: You're not supposed to say that until after you have the wings, right?",
        "Taylor: I am a little hungry.",
        "Nick: Good. This place should fix that. One way or another. Grab a chair. I'll get the food. Excuse me? Hey, a bucket of wings, and a couple of colas, huh?",
        "Taylor: And lime with mine. So, now you say that you've given up the sea, and you're a new man, but you're still really comfortable in a place like this?",
        "Nick: No, no, no. We're not going to do this. We are finished talking about me. We're here to talk about you.",
        "Taylor: You know me.",
        "Nick: Tell me something I don't know.",
        "Taylor: Like what?",
        "Nick: Like anything. Just relax. Kick back. Maybe you ought stop being a doctor for a while, huh, and just -- just be that person that maybe you never let anybody see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Arthur: Not 'till when? How's that -- that's unacceptable. I promised I'd be there.",
        "Brooke: So, Eric didn't want to be in on this meeting?",
        "Ridge: He set it up. It's up to us to close it.",
        "Thorne: He's been on the phone with our distributors all week.",
        "Brooke: Anything good?",
        "Ridge: Apparently, Lauren's not the only one feeling confident.",
        "Arthur: Fine, fine. If that's all they've got. I'll take it.",
        "Ridge: What's the problem?",
        "Arthur: Ah, my flight back to San Francisco's been canceled and they can't get another one out until tonight.",
        "Brooke: Well, if you need to video conference from here, we can set you up in one of the offices.",
        "Arthur: My daughter has a recital at her school.",
        "Thorne: Well, that's too bad.",
        "Ridge: We'd give you the jet, but it's in Chicago right now.",
        "Arthur: Thanks. I'll just give her a call when we're done here.",
        "Brooke: No, it's okay. We can reschedule our meeting. Maybe you can charter a flight from long beach or something.",
        "Arthur: No, no.",
        "Ridge: It's really okay. We understand. We know how important being with your family is right now.",
        "Arthur: You heard about the divorce?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, dad told me. I'm really sorry about you and Chrissy.",
        "Arthur: Thanks. But I don't feel right complaining after everything your family has been through. Thorne, I'm really sorry about Darla. I hope everything works out for you and Taylor.",
        "Thorne: I appreciate that.",
        "Ridge: We're all making a fresh start here at Forrester Originals. The family's on an upswing, and we would like you to be a part of it.",
        "Arthur: Well, are you going to propose to me, too?",
        "[Brooke laughs]",
        "Brooke: You know, that wasn't a publicity stunt. We're really getting married.",
        "Arthur: The Forrester dream team together again.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, renewed enthusiasm and zest for everything. Add to that the chemistry and the passion that made our first company so great and you, my friend will have most profitable thoroughbred in the stable.",
        "Arthur: You don't have to sell me, Ridge. You can count on Harrisons. We're very excited to carry your new line.",

        "Nick: I had no idea you were married before Ridge.",
        "Taylor: Oh yeah. Not one of my more brilliant choices.",
        "Nick: Marrying the stalker or the dressmaker?",
        "Taylor: I don't know, to tell you the truth.",
        "Nick: Oh yeah, so, talk to me about your childhood. That bad, huh?",
        "Taylor: Actually, it's worse than these wings.",
        "Nick: You know, I remember Brooke had mentioned your father. The guy just adored you.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, yeah, I adore him. And I have a little brother. My mom died when I was young. My dad had a gambling problem.",
        "Nick: So, you took care of things?",
        "Taylor: I tried. Things in our house were -- chaotic.",
        "Nick: I see. Thus enters the stalker, becomes husband, who promises to take you away from everything.",
        "Taylor: Yup.",
        "Nick: That sort of explains the whole psychiatric therapy thing, right? You just want to help people out, take care of their problems, addictions, and make their lives perfect. It starting to make sense now.",
        "Taylor: Oh, you think you got me all figured out.",
        "Nick: I think I'm slowly starting to piece your little puzzle together. I like it. It's interesting. I'm going to ask you something.",
        "Taylor: Go ahead.",
        "Nick: I would like to know if -- you'd like another bucket of wings. I ordered medium because I didn't want to scare you. But you see, I like 'em hot. Really hot. Do you think you can handle that?",
        "Taylor: Bring it on.",
        "Nick: You sure you want to cross that line?",
        "Taylor: I wouldn't say yes if it was something that I didn't want to do.",
        "Nick: But if it's too much for you to deal with, and you don't think that you can handle it, don't say I didn't warn you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Arthur, thank you for coming by. And we'll see you at the showing.",
        "Arthur: Of course, we will.",
        "Brooke: And bring that beautiful little girl of yours. I hope you make it to the recital on time.",
        "Arthur: Me, too.",
        "Thorne: Come on, I'll walk you out.",
        "[Elevator dings]",
        "Ridge: It's a shame about Arthur and Chrissy.",
        "Brooke: I know. Well, it is a shame. But maybe they'll get back together. You and I certainly did.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, not every couple's not as lucky as we are, Logan.",
        "Brooke: It does seem like we've had the stars on our side lately. It couldn't have gone better at the meeting with Arthur.",
        "Ridge: Do you have any doubt it wouldn't?",
        "Brooke: Well, I'm just relieved, you know. Now that we have two distributors in the bag.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, the Harrisons and Fenmore. The rest will jump on board pretty soon.",
        "Brooke: Yes. So, we're back in business.",
        "Ridge: Yes, we are. And it feels good, doesn't it?",
        "Brooke: Just like old times.",
        "Ridge: You know, when you and I were starting out at Forrester, developing belief, the men's line. Man, we were on fire.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, it's getting pretty hot in here right now.",
        "Ridge: Well, we do have the place to ourselves.",
        "Brooke: We do?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. It would be kind of a shame to let an opportunity and a location like this all go to waste, you know?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. It would be a terrible shame.",
        "Ridge: So, what do you say we christen the new office?",
        "Brooke: I say --",
        "Ridge: What you were going to say?",
        "Brooke: I say, it's a deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Oh, how can you take this?",
        "Taylor: These things aren't even hot.",
        "Nick: God, you are tough.",
        "Taylor: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you. I lived in morocco for a while. I got a taste for exotic spices.",
        "Nick: I thought you were in a coma?",
        "Taylor: I was. I say this was before -- oh, God. Never mind. It's not important. It doesn't matter.",
        "Nick: Yeah, really.",
        "Taylor: Do you know about Prince Omar? This was another guy who was obsessed with me. Actually, I should be grateful to him. Because without him, I would have died, and wouldn't been able to watch my children grow up. That was really the only reason I wanted to come home. Because I wanted to watch my babies grow up. I guess, they will always be my babies to me. I just can't believe Thomas is already in college. And Steffy is overseas. And I'm about to be alone, soon. Phoebe's going to grow up and leave the house. And -- what has chuck put on this sauce? Is it like truth serum -- what is it?",
        "Nick: What's the matter?",
        "Taylor: I'm just -- I'm going on and on. I'm embarrassed.",
        "Nick: Please. Do you really think I listen to this? I mean, when you get started, honey, you can go. I do like the prince part. Where he comes in, swoops in and saves the damsel in distress. I do like that. [Cell phone rings] Sorry, I got to take this. Marone.",
        "Arthur: This is Arthur Harrison. My assistant tells me you've been trying to fill up my voice mailbox, Mr. Marone.",
        "Nick: Yeah, I was wondering if we could arrange a meeting while you're in town.",
        "Arthur: No time, I'm afraid. My flight back to San Francisco was canceled. I'm heading down to LAX, see if I can get another one.",
        "Nick: Is there any chance you can hold off until tomorrow?",
        "Arthur: Can't. My daughter has a recital tonight. I promised her I'd be there.",
        "Nick: And you will be. I give you my word. If you could meet me at the Santa Monica airport as soon as you could. That would be great. When you get in the area, give me a call. I'll tell you exactly where to go.",
        "Taylor: You have to go?",
        "Nick: I really do. I'll have them call you a cab, if that's okay.",
        "Taylor: No, no, I've got an account with a car service. No big deal.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Taylor: Listen, thank you. This was really nice. I did have a lot of fun.",
        "Nick: Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Okay.",
        "Phoebe: Mom?",
        "Taylor: Phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: Hey, did you get my message?",
        "Taylor: No, I didn't check my cell phone. I was busy. What's going on?",
        "Phoebe: Nothing. I just -- I got ice cream with Ally and I wanted you to come with us.",
        "Taylor: Did she ask for me?",
        "Phoebe: No. It was my idea. Sorry.",
        "Taylor: Thank you for thinking of me.",
        "Phoebe: Where were you? I mean, Thorne thought you were at your office, but I called over there.",
        "Taylor: Well, I was out for the afternoon with Nick.",
        "Phoebe: Nick?",
        "Taylor: Yes.",
        "Phoebe: You were treating him? Or --",
        "Taylor: No.",
        "Phoebe: Then why were you with him?",
        "Taylor: Phoebe, it's nothing to be concerned about.",
        "Phoebe: Mom, Nick hates us. He hates our whole family.",
        "Taylor: No, he doesn't. Our companies are competing. But it's nothing personal.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, isn't it, though? Look, I heard you talking to nick on the phone yesterday at the debut. I just don't understand, Mom. If you're not still treating him, then why are you talking to him? I mean, is there something going on between you and Nick?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I have wanted this so long, Logan. You and I connecting. Personally and professionally.",
        "Brooke: It's almost perfect.",
        "Ridge: What do you mean, \"almost?\"",
        "Brooke: This feud with Nick. Well, I have to agree with Taylor. I don't want it to get ugly.",
        "Ridge: Look, it's his feud. It's not really going to affect us. It doesn't have to affect us.",
        "Brooke: Well, it could. If he decides to sue us for using the name Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Look, nick has got his hands full just keeping his boat afloat. If he was smart, he'd raise the white flag before he becomes embarrassed. He's outmatched, he's outgunned. There's really nothing he can do to hurt us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Arthur: Good to meet you, nick.",
        "Nick: Likewise.",
        "Arthur: Is this your plane?",
        "Nick: Actually, I just got this for the day.",
        "Arthur: To take me back to San Francisco for my daughter's recital?",
        "Nick: That's right.",
        "Arthur: You really do want to talk to me.",
        "Nick: Yes, I do.",
        "Assistant: Champagne, gentlemen?",
        "Arthur: No, thanks.",
        "Nick: You know, Mariah, would you check to see if the captain's ready to roll?",
        "Assistant: Certainly.",
        "Nick: Thank you. Please.",
        "Arthur: Thank you. I assume you want to talk about Forrester Creations. You want Harrisons to continue carrying your collections.",
        "Nick: Well, you are the biggest retailer of haute couture on the west coast.",
        "Arthur: That doesn't mean we have the shelf space to accommodate everybody. I just had a meeting with the Forresters. I've agreed to handle distribution for Forrester Originals.",
        "Nick: Well, that's one choice. Actually, I'm here to offer you another one.",
        "Arthur: I appreciate your position, Nick. And your help today. But I can't afford any brand confusion.",
        "Nick: I'm not asking you to buy. [Nick clears throat] I'm the one who actually wants to buy. I would like to buy Harrisons Boutiques.",
        "Arthur: Buy my company? It's not for sale.",
        "Nick: Everything's for sale, if the price is right. Here's my offer.",
        "Arthur: You just sank all your assets into the purchase of Forrester Creations. Do you even have this kind of capital?",
        "Nick: We're busy men, art. Let's not waste each other's time. I want to buy your boutiques. Something tells me you want to sell. It's time to make a deal."
