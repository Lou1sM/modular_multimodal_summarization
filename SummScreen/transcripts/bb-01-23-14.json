        "Quinn notices Charlie alone looking at some papers. She tries to compliment him by saying he's doing a good job. The Forrester's picked a good man. She tells him he needs to forget what happened at the boutique. He has nothing to be ashamed of. He spews except for the fact he is keeping the dirty little secret of her son. Now Wyatt has Hope and Liam has nothing. And he helped her son pull that off. Quinn tells him that he did Forrester a big favor that paid a huge dividend. Charlie argues that was no publicity stunt. That was a crime and two men are in jail because of it. He says he is an officer of the law and he can't live with this. She gets in his face and demands that he will. Pam walks up and Charlie is gruff with even her and leaves. Liam rushes home thinking he will find Hope there. He only finds Caroline who is making herself at home. She says she saw Wyatt and Hope in that ridiculous trailer along PCH. She tells Liam that she is not taking sides but in her vast field of knowledge about such things if he wants to win Hope over he has to let her go. Wyatt parks the truck and makes sure it is safe while Hope sits on a huge boulder by the water. Wyatt takes some selfies including some of them kissing. They drive a little further and find a spot to permanently park. Wyatt hops out and opens the door for her. She puts a block of wood under the tires to maintain it and Wyatt puts stakes in the ground to set up their site. One of them grabs the football and they start their frolic in the sand. She jumps in his arms and he carries her piggyback. Soon they are not worried about the football; they kiss. Quinn butters Pam up by saying just leave Charlie alone for a bit; he's probably just overworked. She tells Pam that she is too with all these executives she has to please around here. She deserves a break so she is inviting her out to lunch, girlfriend, and lunch is on her. Pam says that sounds better than her baloney sandwich so okay.",
        "Liam tells Caroline that he knows Quinn's footprint by now. There is nothing she won't do including bringing Steffy back from Paris and now locking him in the elevator. Caroline asks if he thinks Wyatt is aware of his mother's insanity and he says yes of course he is. He's covering for her. Caroline thinks he might be just a teeny bit jealous. He says this is so far past jealousy. He's worried about Hope's safety. With as any tricks as Quinn has pulled there is no telling what she might do. Maybe he's being melodramatic but he knows he and Hope are not finished and he thinks Quinn knows that too. He loves her too much so he has to protect her. Wyatt has Hope close her eyes while he guides her into the trailer \"Rock and Roll\". He shows her the fridge, the stove, the bed and she is wild with glee and says it is so him. She says she loves it. He's happy as this will be Home Sweet Home for a little while. While on that subject he says he has never opened up much about his mom but since Hope is the only one that matters, he'd like to say more. She's a woman who is pretty wrapped up in her son. But she loves Hope because he does. He just doesn't want Hope to get nervous if Quinn gets a little ..overprotective. He tells her he is so sorry that Quinn sent her the Liam video he sent Steffy or brought Steffy back from Paris. He even says the reason their company never really took off is because of her people skills. Hope wants to know what he means. He explains by saying his mother sold some gems one time that weren't exactly what she claimed they were. Hope asks if Wyatt was aware of it. He says he had no part in it but he didn't stop it either. They were just barely getting by. He's never done anything like that since meeting Hope and he wants her to know who he is. There is the Wyatt then and the Wyatt now, two different people. And the difference is her. She asks if there is anything else he wants to tell her. He says no and he hopes he has not ruined his chances by telling her that. She says no, honesty never messes up anything with her. They both have some very interesting parents so if he doesn't fault her for hers she won't fault him for his. He says deal! He gives her a big box and says not to open it up until he is ready. At lunch, Quinn confides in Pam that she doesn't have many friends and not even at FC as they are sort of stuck up. She really likes Pam and wants to call her a friend. She makes a toast to friendship. They eat their lunch, drink a little more wine and start confessing some of their really bad times; things they did that were kind of nasty. Quinn says she does not like to talk about it but since they are friends and she knows she can trust Pam, it's about her son. Hope comes out of the trailer looking for Wyatt. She has on this gorgeous billowy white see thru two piece gown. She sees him in the distance setting up a lean-to tent. She thanks him for this; it's so au natural. They kiss."

        "Hope: Yeah? All right! Can't believe we're doing this!",
        "Wyatt: I know. It's pretty gnarly, huh?",
        "Hope: Totally, dude.",
        "Wyatt: Was that surfer lingo?",

        "Charlie: I was tricked by your son.",
        "Quinn: You were part of a publicity stunt that paid a huge dividend.",
        "Charlie: Faking a jewel heist is not a publicity stunt. It's a crime. There are two men in jail for something they didn't do. Now, look, I'm an officer of the law, and I just can't live with this.",

        "Quinn: Little overworked? I think it's a lot of pressure protecting us from all the crime out there.",

        "Caroline: Well, not west, unless that thing can float.",
        "Liam: You know, you -- you -- you're being awfully cavalier about this whole thing.",
        "Caroline: I'm in the grand stand here, okay? So you two boys are on your own.",
        "Liam: Yeah? You're sure you're not cheerleading?",
        "Caroline: I am not taking sides, Liam. Not that I don't have my own point of view.",
        "Liam: What -- what is it?",
        "Caroline: Well, in my vast storehouse of experience, if you want to win a lover, you let her go.",

        "Hope: Whoo! I rise with the sun the light shining on me a feeling so escalating to the place that I run a place so carefree and surprisingly ordinary ooh, I know that you're with me it makes me feel crazy ooh, I know that you need me you need me as your baby take me to the place where we can be under the sun and worry-free all that I need is you with me take me to the place where the sun shines free I dance in the rain it's so cool and so clean it washes away my worries with you by my side I got all I need there's no need to rush or hurry ooh, do you see me? You're driving me crazy ooh, I know that you need me I want to be your baby take me to the place where we can be under the sun and worry-free all that I need is you with me take me to the place where the sun shines free",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: I know it was my mistake. Everyone makes a mistake once in awhile, don't they? Yes, I promise I will do my best never to do it again.",
        "[Receiver hangs up]",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Challenging day?",
        "Pam: I guess I'm just a little out of sorts. Some-- something's going on with Charlie. I can just feel it, and it's driving me a little crazy. I feel like I should just go talk to him about it.",
        "Quinn: Well, you know, a little advice? I would just leave it alone.",
        "Pam: I'm sure you're right. I just always like to get things out in the open, you know? But that's probably why I'm still low man on the totem pole.",
        "Quinn: Pam, is that what you think? You're the executive assistant to a number of executives on this floor.",
        "Pam: [Laughs] Executive assistant. Well, that's not the way I think of it.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] You know what? You have been working too hard. Come on. Let's -- let's go to lunch.",
        "Pam: [Chuckles] No. That's okay. I mean, I-I brought my bologna sandwich.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You know, Steffy shows up at my wedding, Hope gets an e-mail sent from my computer, and I get locked in an elevator. What's the common denominator, Caroline? What is it? It's Quinn.",
        "Caroline: You can prove this?",
        "Liam: Do I need to at this point? I mean, I know her footprint by now. There's nothing she won't do to keep me from interfering with her plans.",
        "Caroline: Do you think that Wyatt is aware of his mother's...idiosyncrasies?",
        "Liam: Idiosyncrasies. That's diplomatic. I would have gone for \"insanity,\" but yes, yes, of course he's aware. And, in fact, I think he's covering for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Your eyes closed?",
        "Hope: Yes. I can't see.",

        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Hope: How is this the first time you're letting me see inside?",
        "Wyatt: Well, I had to clean it up! Watch your head. Stay right there.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Got it?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Shut this. Okay. Are you ready?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Open them.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God!",
        "Wyatt: You got your fridge and the stove, got the bath, the bed.",
        "Hope: This is so you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: I love it.",
        "Wyatt: Good! Good. 'Cause this will be home sweet home for a little while.",
        "Hope: Oh, my. Just two vagabonds.",
        "Wyatt: Yep. You know, I want this to be -- here. [Sighs] I want this to be the good, old days, a time that we can always look back on.",
        "Hope: I'm really glad we did this.",
        "Wyatt: Maybe we'll make a life out of it.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Never go back.",
        "Hope: Your mom would have something to say about that.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Right.",
        "Hope: What? What's the matter?",
        "Wyatt: Can we talk about mom for a second?",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: Um, I've never exactly shared much about her.",
        "Hope: With me.",
        "Wyatt: With anyone. And since you're the only one who matters, I'll let you take a look in the treasure chest first.",
        "Hope: And what do I see?",
        "Wyatt: A woman who's pretty wrapped up in her son.",
        "Hope: Really?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hope: I had no idea. I never would have guessed that ever.",
        "Wyatt: Well, actually, you've only skimmed the surface. Mom's been O.C. about me since I was a kid.",
        "Hope: Was that difficult growing up?",
        "Wyatt: I learned to live with it. And you might, too. She loves you, Hope, because I do. I just don't want you to be surprised if she gets a little...",
        "Hope: Over-protective?",
        "Wyatt: Overly everything.",
        "Hope: Ah. Great.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Hope: Like, uh, sending me private videos or getting Steffy to fly back to L.A.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, God, I hated that. I'm -- I'm so sorry that happened.",
        "Hope: It's okay.",
        "Wyatt: You know, she's one of the reasons why our company never took off until the Forrester contract. Her people skills are a little skewed.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: I buy that. Uh, but, I mean, what does that mean, exactly?",
        "Wyatt: Okay, um, one time when it got really rough, mom sold some gems that weren't exactly what she claimed they were.",
        "Hope: That's awful.",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Hope: Did you know about it? I mean, did you have any part?",
        "Wyatt: It wasn't my idea, but I didn't exactly stop it, either. I mean, we were barely surviving, and I just -- I went along with it. Look, I have never done anything like that since I met you, okay? And I regret ever doing it. Just, I want you to know who I am. You know, who I was and who I am now are two different people. And the difference is...you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Well, this beats bologna on rye.",
        "Pam: White bread.",
        "Quinn: Of course.",
        "Pam: You know, Quinn, you didn't have to do this.",
        "Quinn: Oh, believe me, Pam, I wanted to.",
        "Pam: Why?",
        "Quinn: I don't get out very often.",
        "Pam: Oh, come on. You?",
        "Quinn: Well, I work all the time. And, um... I'll tell you a secret, but, um, I don't have a lot of friends.",
        "Pam: You're still pretty new at Forrester.",
        "Quinn: Oh, no, it's not just that. [Chuckles] I mean, the people there, they're not my type, you know?",
        "Pam: Your type?",
        "Quinn: Real, honest, interesting. They're all a bit stuck-up, if you know what I mean.",
        "Pam: I do know what you mean.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] See? I was impressed with you the very first time I ever met you. I mean, you're -- you're so down to earth, you're easy to be with. And, you know, this is gonna sound a little bit forward, but, um... I'd really like to be your friend.",
        "Pam: Gosh. [Chuckles] I had no idea.",
        "Quinn: Well, I don't want to be pushy.",
        "Pam: Oh, no. You're not. You're not. Thank you.",
        "Quinn: Good. To friendship.",

        "Hope: [Chuckles] I mean, is there anything else you need to tell me?",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Hope: You sure?",
        "Wyatt: Did I mess up my chances by telling you all that?",
        "Hope: Honesty never messes up anything, not with me, ever, okay?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: I mean, you and I, we -- we both have very... interesting parents, so if...",
        "Wyatt: Good word.",
        "Hope: ...You don't fault me for mine, I won't fault you for yours.",
        "Wyatt: That's -- deal.",
        "Hope: Yeah?",
        "Wyatt: That's a deal.",
        "Hope: Deal. [Laughs] Deal.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: I've got something for you. Mm-hmm.",
        "Hope: Another surprise?",
        "Wyatt: One of many.",
        "Hope: Ooh.",
        "Wyatt: Just don't open until I'm gone.",
        "Hope: Where are you going?",
        "Wyatt: To set something up.",
        "Hope: Oh. Okay.",

        "Quinn: Thank you for coming here with me.",
        "Pam: You're thanking me?",
        "Quinn: Well, I usually eat alone. I don't know what it is, but I think I've made a few mistakes with people.",
        "Pam: Yeah, well, who hasn't?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Certainly not you.",
        "Pam: Please, believe me, I've done a few nasties. But, you know, I-I like to think that that was in the past and that I'm different now.",
        "Quinn: Well, I think you're a good person, Pam.",
        "Pam: Well, thank you. I think you're a good person, too. [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: I think we all deserve a second chance, don't you?",
        "Pam: Yes. Yes, I do. Quinn... have you ever done anything bad? I mean, really bad?",
        "Quinn: Something has been weighing on me. I don't like to talk about it. But... since we're friends and I can trust you... it's about my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Are you sure that you're not just a teeny-weeny bit jealous?",
        "Liam: This is so much bigger than jealousy. I am worried about Hope's safety. I mean, someone who's pulled as many stunts as Quinn has, there's no telling what she can't do.",
        "Caroline: What could she possibly do?",
        "Liam: I don't know. She flew all the way to Paris just to ruin my wedding. If Quinn is cornered and desperate, I don't want Hope anywhere near her.",
        "Caroline: I don't know. It just sounds a little bit melodramatic.",
        "Liam: Okay, fine. Then I'm being melodramatic, but I'm not taking any chances, Caroline, 'cause I know that Hope and I aren't finished, and I think she knows that, too. And if Quinn ever finds out... I don't even want to think about what could happen. I have to protect her. I have to. I love her too much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Wyatt? Wyatt? Wyatt! [Laughs] Wow.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. Look at you.",
        "Hope: Look at this!",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] Yeah.",
        "Hope: Oh, my gosh. How did you do this? It's so -- it's so natural.",
        "Wyatt: Au natural. It's the only way to go.",
        "Hope: But you did it so quickly.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, this isn't my first time. You should see me in the woods.",
        "Hope: Oh, I've seen you in the woods.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] I walked into that.",
        "Hope: You really did. Thank you so much for this. I-I did not expect it.",
        "Wyatt: What'd you think? I'd do a flatscreen and a generator, maybe an antenna and some satellite, huh? It's not the five-star accommodations that you love.",
        "Hope: All right, I'm spoiled. I know it. [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: No. You're made for this environment. You're as beautiful as anything out here."
