        "Ridge: So let's have the \r\ntruth, I think I deserve that. Something's going on with you two? You led me to \r\nbelieve that it was over. ",
        "Nick: It is over. But \r\nlet's not confuse issues here, Forrester. And the real issue is that I'm not \r\nletting you slither your way back into her life. ",
        "Brooke: Nick, please.\r\n",
        "Ridge: You're getting way \r\ntoo involved with your mother- in-law, Nick. It's a dangerous road you're \r\nwalking on. ",
        "Nick: My life is none of \r\nyour business. ",
        "Ridge: I have a sister \r\nthat's dying that's depending on you and Bridget to raise her child -- your son. \r\nAnd you've got another child on the way. You've got no business sniffing around \r\nhere. ",
        "Brooke: Nick is committed \r\nto Bridget and to their children. ",
        "Ridge: Oh, you talk about \r\nhonor and integrity, Nick, and here you are marking your territory, while your \r\npregnant wife sits at home for you. You end this, Nick. Either you end this or \r\nI'll go to Bridget and tell her what's really going on. ",
        "\r\n*****************************************************",
        "Massimo: You are getting \r\nmarried? To Eric? ",
        "Stephanie: I know it \r\nsounds crazy. ",
        "Massimo: Crazy? The man \r\nstole your company. He humiliated you with Brooke. If we hadn't found that \r\ntrust, he would've shipped you off to Florida, lived off your assets, and now \r\nyou're marrying him? ",
        "Stephanie: Mass, it's not \r\nwhat you think. ",
        "Massimo: All right then, \r\nfine. You enlighten me, because as far as I can see, you are heading for another \r\nfall -- again. ",
        "Stephanie: We're doing \r\nthis for Felicia. This is her wish. She wants us -- she wants the family \r\nreunited. It's not a real marriage in any sense of the word. ",
        "Massimo: Stephanie, you're \r\ngoing to stand up in front of a minister, okay? With witnesses. And you're going \r\nto exchange vows with a man that you once loved. And this is not going to mean \r\nanything? Listen, if you let this bum back into your life, he'll find a way to \r\nworm himself back into your heart, and maybe even your bed. ",
        "\r\n**************************************************",
        "[Jackie sighs] \n",
        "Jackie: Do you know, my \r\nengagement ring is even prettier in the bedroom than it is in the living room.\r\n",
        "Eric: I think it is. I \r\njust want you to be reminded every minute of every day how much I love you.\r\n",
        "Jackie: I don't need \r\nanything to remind of that, Eric. I know. ",
        "Eric: Good. ",
        "Jackie: You know, this \r\nfeels kind of strange. ",
        "Eric: Hmm? ",
        "Jackie: Making love to a \r\nman who's about to go off and marry another woman. ",
        "Eric: Wedding's just for \r\nshow, I promise you that. ",
        "Jackie: Felicia believes \r\nit. You and Stephanie belong together. She does. She thinks that once you're \r\nmarried, you will rediscover that. ",
        "Eric: No. No, not going to \r\nhappen. Look, I've given my attorneys instructions to draw up a prenuptial with \r\nan iron-clad annulment in place. ",
        "Jackie: I know you're just \r\ndoing this to make Felicia happy. I do. And I love you for that. I do. Just as \r\nlong as you stay honest with Stephanie and me. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************",
        "Stephanie: What do you \r\nthink, that I have some secret fantasy of being married to Eric again? \n",
        "Massimo: I'm just saying, \r\nbe careful. ",
        "Stephanie: Mass, I'm \r\nfinished with Eric. I don't love him anymore. ",
        "Massimo: That's what \r\nyou've said to him, to yourself, but -- how long have I known you, Cara, hmm? \r\nYou've always been vulnerable to Eric. Especially now. Facing the loss of a \r\nchild, my god. Look, your heart is in the right place, Stephanie. But it is the \r\nwrong thing to do. I'm sorry, I'm just not going to let you go through with it.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: You're not \r\ngoing to let me? ",
        "[Chuckles] You're acting \r\nlike -- I don't know what. ",
        "Massimo: What do you \r\nthink? Isn't it obvious? ",
        "Stephanie: Mass? Are you \r\nsaying that you still have feelings for me? ",
        "Massimo: Come on. \n",
        "\r\n******************************************************",
        "Eric: I just want to tell \r\neverybody about you. ",
        "[Jackie chuckles] I do.\r\n",
        "Jackie: Well, so do I, but \r\nwe can't those eyes in, not yet. ",
        "Eric: No. No, we have to \r\nwait. ",
        "Jackie: Oh god, I am so \r\nsorry about Felicia, Eric. I can only imagine the kind of pain that you're in. \r\nYou spend every minute with her that you can. And if she wants you to marry \r\nStephanie, do it. And don't you worry about me, because I will be here. Any \r\ntime, day or night. Whatever you need, I'll be here for you. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************************",
        "Nick: Don't try to flip \r\nthis around. Because Brooke and I are not the problem here. You are. I've seen \r\nthis act before how many times. God knows how many times she's seen it. You \r\nbuild up her hopes and then you disappoint her. Well, it's not going to happen \r\nthis time because she is not going to forgive you, and she is not taking you \r\nback. ",
        "Ridge: Oh, you think \r\nyou've changed her, is that it? ",
        "Nick: No. I think she's \r\nlearned to trust and respect herself. ",
        "Ridge: Nick, let me tell \r\nyou how all of this is going to play out. Brooke is going to kick and scream a \r\nlot. She's going to put me through hoops and rightfully so. And when she gets \r\nall that out of her system, she's going to look at the life that we had. And \r\nshe's going to realize that her life with me is the way it's supposed to be. \r\nShe's going to come back to me. I get what I want, little brother. And I want \r\nBrooke. ",
        "\r\n**********************************************************",
        "\r\nStephanie: Now mass, I am not some romantic schoolgirl who lives in the realm of \r\nsuggestion and innuendos, so -- ",
        "Massimo: It is one of the \r\nthings I appreciate most about you, Stephanie. ",
        "Stephanie: So what is it, \r\nexactly, that you're trying to say? ",
        "Massimo: Look -- sit, sit, \r\nsit. You know I always had deep feelings for you, okay? And we've always had a \r\ndeep connection. We'll always have a deep connection. We have a son and \r\ngrandchildren. Now, for the first time since we've known each other, we're not \r\ninvolved with anyone else. So it occurred to me that maybe, maybe we could find \r\nsome happiness together. But now -- now, if you marry this bum, I'm afraid -- I \r\nmean, there's no chance at anything. ",
        "Stephanie: Mass, you know \r\nI love you as my dear friend. It didn't occur to me that there would be \r\nsomething more. ",
        "Massimo: Well, do you \r\nthink there's a chance? ",
        "Stephanie: At this point \r\nin my life, I mean, with every thing that's going on, I don't know. I mean, I \r\ncouldn't promise anything. ",
        "Massimo: Fine. Would you \r\ncall off the wedding? ",
        "Stephanie: No, I -- mass, \r\nyou're not listening to me. This -- Mass. I'm doing this for my daughter. I've \r\ngiven her my word. I have to go through with it. You don't have to worry about \r\nsome sort of romantic entanglement. This marriage to Eric is -- the marriage to \r\nEric is only going to last as long as -- my daughter lives. ",
        "[Massimo sighs] \n",
        "\r\n***********************************************************",
        "Ridge: You let Brooke get \r\nunder your skin, Nick. But I understand that. That's who she is. She needed you. \r\nAnd you served her like a string of other guys over the years. Look around you, \r\nNick. You see any of those guys here today? No. 'Cause they couldn't measure up \r\nto what Brooke and I have, and neither will you. You have a family and a life \r\nwaiting for you at home. You don't deserve someone as pure and good as Bridget, \r\nbut for some reason, she seems to think you make her happy and I want Bridget \r\nhappy. For her sake and for Brooke's. You understand that? 'Cause if you don't, \r\nyou're gonna be out in the middle of the ocean in a dinghy with no paddles, \r\nNick. Your call. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************",
        "Stephanie: Thank you so \r\nmuch. I really appreciate it on such short notice. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. \r\nYou know, I thought it over about having a minister here and I didn't think that \r\nwas appropriate. So I called -- I called Judge Brolin and he's going to come \r\nover. ",
        "Eric: That's a good idea. \r\nI would feel a little strange doing this with a man of god. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, yes, \r\nespecially since it's not a real ceremony. ",
        "Eric: Yeah. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, Felicia \r\nmade up some invitations for family members only. Here. And Kristen's flying in \r\ntomorrow morning. ",
        "Eric: \"By royal decree, \r\nyou are hereby commanded to attend the ultimate Forrester family reunion, a \r\nceremony reuniting grumpy groom Eric Forrester and his reluctant bride, \r\nStephanie Douglas-Forrester. Anyone not attending will be talked about after the \r\nceremony.\" ",
        "Stephanie: Your daughter. \r\nI'll do anything for her, though. Even marry you. I'm just not prepared to lose \r\nher, that's all. I'm just not prepared for this. ",
        "\r\n**************************************************",
        "Brooke: You're wrong about \r\nNick. He changed me. He's not like anybody else, Ridge. Not even like you. But \r\nRidge is right about one thing. We can't keep doing this. ",
        "Nick: Doing what? Hmm? \r\nWhat? Looking out for each other as a family? ",
        "Brooke: You have a life \r\nwith Bridget now. You can't protect me at her expense. So just go home, Nick. \r\nPlease. I can take care of this. ",
        "\r\n***********************************************************",
        "Stephanie: I don't want \r\nFelicia to see me like this. She's got more than enough to handle with all this \r\nstuff. ",
        "Eric: I'm just not certain \r\nwe're helping at all. This wedding, I mean, Felicia has completely unrealistic \r\nexpectations here. Maybe we shouldn't go through with it, knowing what we know.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Suddenly your \r\nconscience is kicking in? ",
        "Felicia: Ahh, the happy \r\nbride and groom. ",
        "Stephanie: Honey, \r\nshouldn't you be in bed? ",
        "Eric: Here, honey, here, \r\nsit down. Sit, sit. ",
        "Felicia: I just wanted to \r\ncheck on the wedding plans. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, well, \r\nflowers ordered, menus selected. ",
        "Felicia: Attorneys \r\ncontacted, prenuptials drawn up. Hmm. I know you think I'm silly for asking you \r\ntwo to get married again. You think you're going to be divorced before I'm even \r\ncold in the ground. ",
        "Stephanie: Felicia! \n",
        "Felicia: I'm a realist, \r\nMother. I look at things the way they are, just like you. ",
        "Eric: Maybe we should call \r\nthis whole thing off. ",
        "Felicia: I said realist, \r\nDaddy, not pessimist. I see the way you two treat each other. ",
        "Eric: Not exactly like two \r\npeople who are in love. ",
        "Felicia: Not on the \r\nsurface, but underneath all the bickering, blaming, fault-finding -- believe me, \r\nI know you have to dig pretty deep beneath all that. But then I think you find \r\ntwo people who still love each other, but are too stubborn to admit it. \n",
        "Eric: Honey, I think \r\nyou're just seeing what you want to see. ",
        "Felicia: Ahh, ahh, ahh, \r\nDaddy, no. One day at a time, okay? First you get married, and then you take it \r\none day at a time until -- while I'm still here, okay? Then after that, okay, \r\nwho knows? If you still think you can't stand each other, fine. But at least \r\nyou've done something that means a lot to me. Ow! It seems like you guys have \r\neverything under control, so maybe I will get in bed. ",
        "Eric: Come on, honey. Come \r\non. Oh, God. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************",
        "Brooke: Please leave, \r\nRidge. ",
        "Ridge: As soon as I tell \r\nyou how I feel. The way you looked at Nick scared me. For the first time, I \r\nthink I felt like I've lost you forever. ",
        "Brooke: Nick is married to \r\nBridget. Nothing's going to happen between us. ",
        "Ridge: I'm not really \r\nworried about that. It's more us. Please tell me that there's some hope here.\r\n",
        "Brooke: You really believe \r\nthat you can just waltz back into my life like nothing happened? You think you \r\nknow what I'm feeling, what I'm going to do, but you don't. I'm not your Logan \r\nanymore. You tore apart everything that Ii knew, everything that I counted on, \r\nand I had to find my own way. You know what I found? I found out what it was \r\nlike to be loved completely by a man. To be first in his heart. I was always \r\ncompeting for your love with Taylor, with Caroline, even your mother. But I \r\nnever got it. I never came first. And I deserve that, ridge. I deserve to come \r\nfirst. I would rather have nothing than what I had with you. ",
        "Ridge: You're right. I've \r\nbeen incredibly selfish. I've acted stupid, childish, and cruel. To walk away \r\nfrom you and our little son whom we've waited a lifetime for. I was trying to \r\nplease everyone and wanting to please no one. These last few months without you, \r\nI've felt dead inside. Completely empty except for the pain. But I know that no \r\nmatter what I was feeling would never compare to what I've done to you. And here \r\nI am, asking you to find a way to forgive me. I destroyed our lives and I have \r\nno right to ask you to give me another chance, but I'm praying to god you will. \r\nI need you, Brooke. I need us. I'm asking you to somehow find that forgiveness \r\none more time. "
