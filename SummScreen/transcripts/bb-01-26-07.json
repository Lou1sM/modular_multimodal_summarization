        "Nick spills coffee on his shirt and is changing when his secretary comes in, spies his St. Christopher medal, and remarks how pretty it is. It reminds him of Brooke who gave it to him and him saying that he will never take it off. Ridge and Brooke canoodle in his office and he confides that he overheard Rick and her talking last night. He knows that Rick still doesn't trust him and probably would rather that she be still with Nick. He ponders if he will have to prove himself all over again, the way he did with Brooke.",
        "Rick wastes no time in dropping in on Nick and accusing him of plotting his family's downfall. But admits that he would have done the very same thing Nick did. And he hands him a list of international employees that might be helpful to Nick. He vows he loves his mother just as much as Nick loves his and he's afraid it is only a matter of time before Ridge breaks her heart again and she and Stephanie will be going toe to toe.",
        "The gang at the new Forrester are excited about sketches and designs for the new line showing soon. Rick meets Phoebe who he barely recognizes since she has grown up. In speaking of Nick behind his back, Rick warns them not to underestimate him. That the more you challenge him, the more determined he is to beat you. Eric just wants to forget Nick and concentrate on his showing in two weeks. The Forrester's are coming back with a vengeance! Ridge states the only thing that could make it better is a big old wedding and an extended honeymoon. Nick gets the affirmative he wants from Harrison and buys his boutiques even though it was more money than he originally offered and Storm is worried that he has over-extended himself. Even Jackie is worried that he is building this on a house of cards, losing his perspective. Two weeks, Nick surmises, then the Forrester's will be crushed and destroyed."

        "Eric: Bridget, you need to write down everything I say. I'm not going to remember any of this.",
        "Bridget: Okay. You're just loving this, aren't you, Dad?",
        "Eric: Yeah, being here with my girls? You bet I am.",
        "Phoebe: I feel like a princess or something.",
        "Felicia: And you look like one, too.",
        "Eric: Good.",
        "Felicia: And who knows, maybe a real princess will buy this gown.",
        "Phoebe: Maybe.",
        "Eric: Yeah, maybe. But she won't be as pretty as you are. It's true. It's true.",
        "Phoebe: Thank you.",
        "Bridget: Dad, I really think this is some of the best work you've ever done.",
        "Felicia: Definitely some of the quickest.",
        "Eric: Yes, well, if Ridge and I don't get this finished, we won't have a full collection for the showing.",
        "Felicia: Where is he, anyway? I thought he wanted us all to ooh and ah over his last masterpiece.",
        "Bridget: Well, wherever he is, you can bet my mom's there, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Assistant: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Nick: No, no, no, come on in. I just spilled some coffee on this shirt.",
        "Assistant: Oh, I'll take care of that.",
        "Nick: Thanks.",
        "Assistant: Clarke wanted you to see these.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Assistant: Hey, what's that around your neck?",
        "Nick: It's a St. Christopher medal. It's supposed to keep a man safe at sea.",
        "Assistant: It's beautiful. Have you always worn that?",
        "Nick: It was a gift, actually.",
        "Assistant: It's nice. I'll take this to the dry cleaner right away.",
        "[Nick remembering]",
        "Nick: I'll never take it off.",
        "[Echoing] I'll never take it off. I'll never take it off.",
        "Brooke: I had it blessed. It's my way of telling you that I will always be there for you.",
        "Nick: I'll never take it off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm supposed to be working.",
        "Brooke: Yeah?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: Am I distracting you?",
        "Ridge: No. No. You're inspiring me.",
        "Brooke: Well, maybe you should put that inspiration on paper. And we'll save this for later.",
        "Ridge: It's more private in here, you know.",
        "Brooke: Well, maybe that's the problem. Would you get more work done if I had security come up and take that lock off the door?",
        "Ridge: Don't you even think about that.",
        "Brooke: Is that why you came here so early this morning? You needed some privacy?",
        "Ridge: There's a lot of work to do before the showing.",
        "Brooke: Or were you just trying to avoid Rick?",
        "Ridge: Rick's a good guy. I just wish he felt the same about me.",
        "Brooke: He's just concerned about what happened. He didn't like the way that you and your mother treated Jackie.",
        "Ridge: That's very protective of you. I overheard you two talking last night.",
        "Brooke: Oh, Ridge. I'm sorry.",
        "Ridge: It's okay. He just doesn't trust me. I think he'd rather you were still married to Nick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I've contacted the owners of every major distribution company the Forresters rely on. Except this Harvey Golden.",
        "Jackie: He's one of the most influential men in fashion.",
        "Nick: Have you ever met him?",
        "Jackie: No, not personally. He's very elusive.",
        "Nick: Supposedly on the mysterious side, too.",
        "Jackie: Nicky, it's going to take so much money to convince golden and the others to sell you their companies. I mean, this plan could get so expensive.",
        "Nick: Yes, it could.",
        "Jackie: Look, I know that you want to beat the Forresters at any cost, but the point --",
        "Nick: Mother, Arthur Harrison is flying in from San Francisco this morning. I've made generous offers to the other two distributors. I want to consolidate these boutiques under the name of Jackie M.",
        "Jackie: We'll be up to our necklines in debt.",
        "Nick: And the Forresters will be out of business.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Assistant: Rick Forrester is here to see you, Mr. Marone.",
        "Nick: Rick Forrester? Send him in.",
        "Rick: Plotting my family's downfall?",
        "Nick: Well, I assume your family is on the other side of town plotting mine.",
        "Rick: Jackie, you're looking lovely. How are you feeling?",
        "Jackie: Right now? A little bit curious.",
        "Nick: So am I. Mother, would you excuse us?",
        "Jackie: You want me to leave?",
        "Nick: Well, this might take a while. And I don't want to be interrupted.",
        "Jackie: Oh, yes. I understand.",
        "Nick: You're back in LA? I assume you blame me for that.",
        "Rick: Well, I'd still be in Paris with a job if you hadn't bought my father's company, yes.",
        "Nick: I need to know the people working international for me can be trusted.",
        "Rick: I get that. In fact, if I was in your position, I would have done the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Rick just wants me to be happy.",
        "Ridge: He doesn't think you can be with me, not for the long term.",
        "Brooke: He's being cautious.",
        "Ridge: He resents me.",
        "Brooke: Maybe he needs a little more time.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Well, I can't expect Rick to change his opinion just because I promised to do better. So, maybe I need to prove myself to him. The same way I had to do with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Storm: Donna, try not to get too friendly. Just keep it professional.",
        "Donna: This isn't my first public appearance, Storm.",
        "Storm: It's your appearance since the creation of Forrester Originals. The press is going to be asking all kinds of questions. How come you're not working with your sister? How do you feel about this competition?",
        "Donna: Competition is exciting.",
        "Storm: No, no, competition is not exciting. Stay to the point. Forrester Creations is moving forward with new leadership and vision. We have to be really careful right now. We can't do or say anything to give the Forresters a case for libel or defamation. We're financially overextended as it is right now with all the moves that Nick is making. A protracted court battle could be devastating to us.",
        "Donna: What moves?",
        "Storm: Well, with all the paperwork that's coming across my desk, I just get the feeling that nick is trying to expand the company. He's rounding up capital, taking out loans --",
        "Donna: For what?",
        "Storm: Well, I was kind of hoping you could tell me.",
        "Donna: No. But whatever he's doing, I trust his instincts.",
        "Storm: Well, he's putting the company and its assets up for his collateral. It's an enormous risk.",
        "Donna: Well, that's the kind of man Nick is. He doesn't wade into the shallows. He just dives in headfirst.",
        "Storm: Right. Well, let's just hope he doesn't break his neck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: It's not ticking.",
        "Rick: It's a list of valuable international employees. Employees who are afraid for their jobs.",
        "Nick: Why would they be afraid for their jobs?",
        "Rick: Well, I respect them and they respect me. Would you consider that an offense worthy of termination?",
        "Nick: On its own, no.",
        "Rick: Good. Because those people could be very helpful to you. I've instructed them to give you all the assistance that you need.",
        "Nick: Why would you do that?",
        "Rick: Who am I speaking to, the man or the money?",
        "Nick: Well, I guess that depends on who I'm speaking to.",
        "Rick: Fair enough. My mother has forgiven Stephanie. I pray that she doesn't regret it, but I think she will. I think that it's only a matter of time before Stephanie turns on her and Ridge lets her down. She keeps saying to herself that this time is going to be different, but the fact of matter is, the only time that it was different, was when she was with you.",
        "Jackie: Nicky? Your 10:00 from San Francisco called. He'll be here shortly.",
        "Nick: I've got to take this meeting.",
        "Rick: Look, I know that you love your mother and you would do anything for her. I feel the same way about my mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: God, we'll blow the competition out of the water with these designs.",
        "Brooke: And yours too, Eric.",
        "Ridge: It's an amazing collection. Thorne's been getting calls from the vendors from all over the country. All the distributors are very excited. The ticket requests for the show are just overwhelming to look at.",
        "Felicia: Lauren Fenmore has agreed to carry the collection sight unseen.",
        "Ridge: We locked in Harrison's with a handshake and the negotiations for the rest of the retailers are going very well.",
        "Eric: Good. Now, all we have to do is get a collection on the runway!",
        "[All laugh]",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Rick: Knock, knock. Whoa! Impressive new digs.",
        "Eric: Rick, I'm glad to see you.",
        "Rick: Dad.",
        "Felicia: Hey, Rick. Your mom told us you were home.",
        "Phoebe: Welcome back.",
        "Rick: Phoebe. You grew up.",
        "Phoebe: It's kind of hard not to.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'm sorry -- I just -- I haven't seen you in a long time.",
        "Eric: Well, you're going to be seeing a lot more of her, if you stay here and work with us. She's going to be modeling now.",
        "Rick: Nice.",
        "Ridge: Hey, we're just going over the last of the sketches for the new collection. You want to see them?",
        "Rick: You're putting out a full collection?",
        "Brooke: Yes. It's the most ambitious that we've ever created.",
        "Rick: Why? I mean, you can generate just as much buzz with a few great designs. You know, get your name out there. Set yourself apart from Forrester Creations.",
        "Ridge: Once Forrester Originals hit the runway, nobody's even going to think twice about Forrester Creations.",
        "Rick: I wouldn't be too sure about that. Nick Marone doesn't back down. In fact, the more you challenge him, the more determined he is to beat you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Nicky? This way, gentlemen.",
        "Nick: Arthur, hey. Good to see you again.",
        "Arthur: You, too.",
        "Nick: Of course, you know my mother. This is our attorney, Storm Logan.",
        "Storm: Pleasure, Mr. Harrison.",
        "Arthur: Storm.",
        "Nick: And this is?",
        "Arthur: Anthony Fering, my attorney.",
        "Nick: Pleasure. Gentlemen. So, Arthur, do we have a deal?",
        "Arthur: My sisters and I loved our father every much. Harrison's was his pride and joy. But it did keep him away from us. None of us want that for our kids. Selling out will give us the flexibility we need to spend more time with them.",
        "Jackie: You're making the right decision. I can tell you, after what I've been through this year, there is nothing more important than family.",
        "Arthur: That's assuming we can come to an agreement. My counteroffer.",
        "Nick: That's quite a jump.",
        "Arthur: How badly do you want my company?",
        "Nick: Put the contracts on the table, Storm.",
        "Jackie: Nicky, he's asking too much.",
        "Nick: Yes, he is.",
        "Jackie: We could be ruined.",
        "Nick: I don't think so.",
        "Storm: Everything's in order. All we need are your signatures.",
        "Nick: Arthur, I noticed there were no contracts with Forrester Originals. You met with them the other day, right?",
        "Arthur: Our families have been doing business together for years. Our word and handshake were all Eric Forrester ever needed.",
        "Nick: No contracts?",
        "Arthur: Nope. But we do have a deal with them. One that I hope you will honor.",
        "Nick: I see. Well, I understand the way your father did business and I respect that. But, I'm going to need your signature. May I say, sir, it's been a pleasure doing business with you.",
        "Arthur: It has, indeed.",
        "Nick: A pleasure.",
        "Arthur: Good luck.",
        "Nick: Thank you.",
        "Storm: Do you want to explain to me what you're doing, Nick?",
        "Nick: You just make sure that this contact is ironclad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm sure Nick will try to fight back. He neither has the talent nor the know-how to beat us.",
        "Rick: He knew enough to take Forrester Creations away from us.",
        "Eric: Listen, you two, I think we should worry less about Nick and more about making this new collection as success.",
        "Brooke: I agree.",
        "Eric: Listen, we've all been working very, very hard to make this new company a success. It's been hectic. But if you ask me, I think we have what it takes to put out a new collection in two weeks.",
        "Bridget: Two weeks?",
        "Phoebe: Do you really think we'll be ready?",
        "Eric: We can do it.",
        "Ridge: The Forresters are coming back with a vengeance. I think our competitors should watch out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: The Forresters have no idea what's about to happen to them.",
        "Jackie: Well, I'm not sure, either. I mean, you've already overpaid for one distributor.",
        "Nick: We can cover that.",
        "Jackie: What? With another loan? Nicky, you're building a house of cards.",
        "Nick: That's how business works, mother.",
        "Jackie: Well, this isn't just about business, is it? I'm the one that encouraged you to take over Forrester Creations. I know what revenge means. And Nicky, I'm worried that you're losing perspective.",
        "Donna: Hey, I just got a call from \"Eye on fashion,\" and they want your response to this press release.",
        "Nick: The Forrester family proudly announces the debut collection of Forrester Originals to be unveiled in two weeks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: You know, I'm going to go check on this stuff -- I'll see you a minute.",
        "Brooke: Okay, honey. Bye. Well, you seemed pumped up about all of this.",
        "Ridge: About this collection? You bet I am. Only one thing could make it better.",
        "Brooke: What's that?",
        "Ridge: If your divorce was final. We could celebrate the success with a big old wedding, and a very extended honeymoon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Two weeks.",
        "Jackie: To acquire all the major distributors? It can't be done. I mean, think of the expense. We could lose everything.",
        "Nick: The Forresters are the ones who are going to be bankrupt. Launching their new collection without an influential buyer in the entire building. It'll be a complete debacle.",
        "Jackie: Oh, Eric --",
        "Nick: I'm sorry, Mother. He and that family had this coming for years. Two weeks. And the Forresters will be wiped out of the fashion business. Completely."
