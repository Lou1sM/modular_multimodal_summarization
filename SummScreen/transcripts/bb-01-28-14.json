        "Hope tells Wyatt that she doesn't want to take anything back; she wants more of it all. He says he is the happiest he has ever been, all because of her. He admits he wasn't very nice to Liam when they met. He had no excuse but there is a reason. He was so jealous he could not see straight. Liam had her and he wanted her, that's all he's got. She says he has redeemed himself. She's proud to be with him. Pam tells Charlie that it just fries her cookie when someone assumes she is an airhead. She loved how Quinn was fawning all over her at lunch and wanting to be her BFF. She saw right through her little scheme. Quinn bet on the wrong pony this time. They are going to go see Liam. Brooke drops in on Katie and thanks her for supporting her when she asked Ridge to marry her. He's very disillusioned and needs more time to absolve what happened with Bill. Katie says they always wind up back together so it will happen. But this does not mean she will get back with Bill; too much damage done. She says she is not looking for a man to fill the spaces. She is enjoying her independent life. Brooke notices the poetry books and says that is good for the soul. She needs to hang on to that and embrace it.",
        "Ridge makes a few changes on the models and Rick takes offense that this is not Ridge's line. And Rick does not want HFTF to look couture. They even get into words over the way Ridge is rejecting Brooke. Ridge says he is having a hard time over what happened with Bill. Rick points out that Ridge has always forgiven her before. It's as if there is something else he is not saying. Liam is still trying to track Hope down when Charlie and Pam come to his office. Pam tells Liam to go easy on Charlie, but Liam was right, Wyatt stole the diamond. Charlie admits that he lied about the footage not showing anything as Quinn had threatened him that he would lose his job and Hope would be very unhappy. Charlie says he is sorry; all of this is his fault. Liam says no, he knew all along Wyatt was involved. Now he needs to get this information to Hope. He calls Caroline who did actually see Hope and Wyatt leave. All she knows and tells Liam is they went South on PCH, something about a Surfing Safari. Wyatt tells Hope that he doesn't want to go back. He likes her here all to himself with no ex boyfriend or mothers, just the road. It doesn't get better than this."

        "Hope: I did not know how much I needed a break.",
        "Wyatt: See? You should always listen to me.",
        "Hope: Ha! Yeah, you wish.",
        "Wyatt: You wish!",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: So... [Clears throat] There's nothing that you want to take back?",
        "Hope: No. In fact, I want more of everything.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I think I can make that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: You know, I really thought Quinn had you fooled.",
        "Pam: She's good. I'll give her that. You should have seen her at lunch, Charlie. She's fawning all over me and flattering me, pretending she was my B.F.F.",
        "Charlie: But you never bought it -- I mean, not even for a minute?",
        "Pam: The minute that she called me \"girlfriend,\" I knew something was up. I just didn't know what.",
        "Charlie: So, you just played along?",
        "Pam: I did. It really fries my cookie when someone assumes that I am some kind of airhead. Well, Quinn bet on the wrong pony this time. Let's go see Liam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I like what you did here. What if you drape this guy over the side like that? What do you think?",
        "Caroline: Oh, yeah. It's way more elegant.",
        "Ridge: It still has your edge but a little bit of the Forrester grace.",
        "Carter: The tiniest change can make such a difference.",
        "Employee: Ridge is a genius.",
        "Ridge: Oh, stop it. I'm not.",
        "Employee: And he's modest.",
        "Rick: Don't let him fool you.",
        "Employee: Feel free to fool me anytime.",
        "Employee: I wouldn't mind it, either.",
        "Caroline: All right, ladies. A little professionalism.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Brooke: Hi. You got a minute?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Sure. Come on in. What's up?",
        "Brooke: Well, I just wanted to tell you how much your support with Ridge meant to me. I mean, after everything I've put you through, you're still urging Ridge to marry me. I was surprised [Chuckles] And overwhelmed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Is this the right amount?",
        "Ridge: Just come over all the way like that here. There. There you go.",
        "Rick: I disagree. The dress looks gorgeous the way it is.",
        "Ridge: I didn't say it didn't.",
        "Rick: No, actually, you barged into a meeting that wasn't yours, started making changes. I don't think I have to tell you you don't design for Hope for the Future. We rebranded this line -- quite successfully, I might add. If we go back to the way things were, we might as well sail that ship right into a financial abyss. Second of all, as the executive in charge, I don't want Hope for the Future looking Couture. That was never the intention.",
        "Ridge: I gave a note. You can take it or leave it.",
        "Caroline: I'm taking it. Thank you. What about -- what about this one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: What you said to Ridge -- telling him to put my ring back on -- your support almost makes up for the fact that he didn't.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I know that's what you wanted -- to rebuild your life with Ridge. It'll happen. You and Ridge always find your way back to each other, right?",
        "Brooke: I don't know. He seems disillusioned.",
        "Katie: I know you just want him to get over it, but you have to understand. Hearing about you and Bill -- it's a shock. He needs time to absorb it.",
        "Brooke: I know. I just need to be a little more patient.",
        "Katie: Not exactly your strong suit.",
        "Brooke: But I've been trying with you, and I think it's paying off. I feel closer to being a real sister to you again.",
        "Katie: We are real sisters. And R.J. is my nephew, and if he can have both of his parents, then of course I'm supportive of that.",
        "Brooke: What about Will?",
        "Katie: Will will be fine. Lots of kids grow up in divided homes.",
        "Brooke: So, you don't think there's a chance for you and Bill?",
        "Katie: No, I don't.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] All because of what I did.",
        "Katie: Because of Bill. He doesn't get a free pass.",
        "Brooke: So much damage done -- your relationship broken, Ridge is disappointed in me. Being with Bill Spencer was probably the worst mistake of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Um, Liam?",
        "Liam: Pam?",
        "Pam: Oh.",
        "Liam: Hi.",
        "Pam: We, uh -- we really need to talk to you.",
        "Liam: Okay, yeah. Come on in. I was just, uh -- hey, Charlie. I was just trying to get ahold of Hope. She's off somewhere with Wyatt and not answering her... phone. What? What's -- what's going on?",
        "Pam: Look, go easy on him. He already feels terrible enough as it is.",
        "Charlie: I-I-I-it was that woman. She --",
        "Pam: She creeps him out.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Liam: What woman?",
        "Charlie: Quinn.",
        "Liam: Oh, great. What did she do now?",
        "Charlie: Not now -- before.",
        "Pam: Go on. Just say it.",
        "Charlie: Ooh. You were right, Liam. Wyatt stole the diamond.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Well, I hope you're happy, because I am. I have never been happier in my life.",
        "Hope: Because of little old me?",
        "Wyatt: That's all it takes.",
        "Hope: Yes, I'm very happy.",
        "Wyatt: Good. So, you still have no regrets about any...",
        "Hope: You keep asking me that. No, I don't -- I don't regret anything between us. I mean, I-I think at first, I had some questions. I thought maybe there could be some, like, character issues.",
        "Wyatt: Really?! What?!",
        "Hope: Okay, listen. Like, o-- well, okay. Honesty and -- and goodness and decency -- you know, that's what I look for in a man -- treating others with respect, kindness. And when you first showed up, I didn't -- I didn't see a whole lot of that from you.",
        "Wyatt: By the way I treated Liam?",
        "Hope: You were kissing me in his house. You were, you know, putting him down all the time.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I -- it wasn't nice. And I don't have an excuse, but I could give you a reason.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: I was...so jealous that I couldn't see straight.",
        "Hope: That's very honest.",
        "Wyatt: Liam had you, and I wanted you, and... that's really all I've got.",
        "Hope: That's it? That's all you got?",
        "Wyatt: That's all I got.",
        "Hope: Okay. Well, I think -- I think you've redeemed yourself. Not only am I happy to be with you, I'm proud.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Okay, ladies. Unpeel your eyes. Alterations await. Chop, chop.",
        "Employee: Thanks, Ridge.",
        "Carter: Must be tough, all the gorgeous women in town falling all over you.",
        "Ridge: [Groans]",
        "Rick: Ridge doesn't notice. He's all about my mother. Aren't you, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Why am I getting the feeling that you have something to say to me, Rick?",
        "Carter: I'll take that as my cue.",
        "Ridge: Don't go far. I got something to talk to you about.",
        "Carter: I'll be in my office.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ridge: Now... what's on your mind?",
        "Rick: My mother. She's been through a lot. I don't want to see her hurt. So, I need to know where you stand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Thank you. Ridge said that he needed time to get used to the fact that I betrayed you. I think if it was anybody else, he probably would have forgiven me by now, but with your husband? I felt really stupid getting him to put that ring back on my finger. [Sighs] You think it'd be too much to ask...",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brooke: Ridge respects your opinion. Maybe if you could keep supporting me and put in a good word for me...",
        "Katie: What are you thinking?",
        "Brooke: Do you think maybe he's involved with somebody else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: So, do you even know where we're going?",
        "Wyatt: I'm gonna follow the highway.",
        "Hope: Ah.",
        "Wyatt: Unless you want me to make a plan, 'cause I can do that.",
        "Hope: No. I'm offended. What, you think I can't be spontaneous?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, no, I know you can be spontaneous.",
        "Hope: All right. Well, now you're just making me blush.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I didn't even say anything.",
        "Hope: It's your eyes. Your eyes are saying so many things.",
        "Wyatt: My eyes -- my eyes are saying how much I love you?",
        "Hope: Yeah, I'm -- I'm getting that message.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? How insanely sexy you are?",
        "Hope: It's coming through a little bit, too.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? You know, we really don't have to go anywhere right now. We could just come in here.",
        "Hope: No, no, no. No!",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Hope: Tempting. This is a road trip, so let's hit the road.",
        "Wyatt: Oh-ho-ho-ho! Fine. Let's do it.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Ugh! [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Wait. But you -- you said that there was nothing on the security footage that showed Wyatt took the diamond.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I know. I-I lied.",
        "Liam: You...lied? Why -- to protect Wyatt?",
        "Charlie: No, to protect me.",
        "Pam: Look, Quinn threatened him, Liam, and not in any kind of specific way, but that's not how she operates.",
        "Liam: Uh-huh.",
        "Charlie: She made me think that telling you could cost me my job and that Hope would be upset with me now that she was dating Wyatt and it was just a harmless mistake and a prank and -- I don't know. I-I-I-I'm so sorry, Liam. I should have come to you in the first place.",
        "Liam: No, it's okay. Just...let me make sure I understand. Are you telling me that you have actual footage of Wyatt stealing the diamond?",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's on my phone. Here. Here. Look.",
        "Liam: You're kidding.",
        "Charlie: See? So, when I turned around to secure the premises, that's when Wyatt snatched the diamond.",
        "Liam: There it is. I knew it.",
        "Pam: I would have told you sooner, but I just found out myself.",
        "Charlie: Tell him about Quinn.",
        "Pam: [Scoffs] So, she takes me out to lunch and pretends that she's my best friend.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Pam: I knew something was off, but I just let her think that I was all flattered to be in her regal presence. Turns out she just wanted me to keep Charlie quiet.",
        "Charlie: I'm so sorry, Liam. This is all my fault.",
        "Liam: No, Charlie. No, it's not. Quinn is a master manipulator, and so is her son. Listen, I knew -- I knew -- that there was something going on with Wyatt. I just needed the proof, and now I have it. I just -- I have to get it to Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I saw my mom yesterday. I got the impression that she was coming to you with her engagement ring.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. She wanted me to put it back on her.",
        "Rick: Um...she's not here, so I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that didn't happen.",
        "Ridge: No, it didn't happen.",
        "Rick: You rejected her again.",
        "Ridge: What your mother and Bill did to Katie is...",
        "Rick: Unforgivable?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. I'm having a hard time getting my head around it.",
        "Rick: You keep telling everyone that you came back to reunite your family. If you don't want to do that, hey, that's fine. That's your call. But don't string my mother along. Don't get her hopes up if it's a dead end.",
        "Ridge: I need more time, Rick.",
        "Rick: See, that's weird to me. You've always forgiven her in the past. It makes me wonder, is there something that you're not saying?",
        "Ridge: Like what?",
        "Rick: Like, is there someone else?",
        "Ridge: I'm just not ready to commit to your mom.",
        "Rick: To my mother or to any woman?",
        "Ridge: Any woman, Rick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Has Ridge given you any reason to believe that he's involved with somebody else?",
        "Brooke: No, but his reluctance to make a commitment tells me otherwise.",
        "Katie: Why don't you just believe him when he says that he needs more time instead of manufacturing obstacles?",
        "Brooke: Okay, okay. I'll just -- I need to let it sit for a while.",
        "Katie: Yes. Good.",
        "Brooke: I have been in love so many times -- in and out of love, breaking up, getting back together. You -- you have been in love with one man and been very happy, till I came along.",
        "Katie: Well, we don't have to talk about this anymore.",
        "Brooke: My point is... I just don't want it to throw you into another depression.",
        "Katie: You don't have to worry about me. I'm fine. Actually, I'm feeling quite well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Gasps] Caroline.",
        "Pam: What about her?",
        "Liam: Hope and Wyatt -- they were passing her on the way out. Maybe she knows where they were headed.",
        "Caroline: Hey, Liam. What's up?",
        "Liam: Hey. Uh, you saw Hope and Wyatt leave. Do you have any idea where they went?",
        "Caroline: Not a clue. I mean, they were heading south on PCH. Um...oh, you know what? Wyatt said something about a surfing safari.",
        "Liam: S-- okay. Thanks.",
        "Charlie: Anything?",
        "Liam: They headed south on a surfing safari.",
        "Liam: Surfing safari, south on PCH.",
        "Pam: Lots of cities.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but we know that it's somewhere along the coast, right? So, we got Seal Beach, Huntington, Newport, Corona Del Mar. Emerald Bay?",
        "Wyatt: Hey, come out here! We're at Emerald Bay, our very own Costa Smeralda, huh?",
        "Hope: I know, and... oh, I love this!",
        "Wyatt: ...I made cocktails.",
        "Hope: You did! It's a -- it's a little early.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you. But we're on vacation, remember? Plus, time is anything we say it is. You know, it's 5:00 somewhere, right?",
        "Hope: [Laughing] Yes.",
        "Wyatt: To many more adventures.",
        "Hope: One a month.",
        "Wyatt: At least.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: God.",
        "Hope: Mm.",
        "Wyatt: I don't want to go back.",
        "Hope: We don't have to. I mean, well, not yet.",
        "Wyatt: I like having you all to myself, you know? No distractions, no ex- boyfriends or mothers -- just you and me, you know, the sand, the surf, the open road. It doesn't get any better than this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Are you sure you're all right? I think about you here alone in this great big house.",
        "Katie: I'm fine. I'm not looking for a man to fill up the spaces. I'm actually enjoying my independence.",
        "Brooke: Wow. I'm surprised. I haven't seen you read poetry in a long time.",
        "Katie: I picked it up again. I'd almost forgotten how much I love it -- the beauty and the purity, the wisdom in the words.",
        "Brooke: When you find something like that, something that makes you feel good inside, it's food for the soul. You need to hang on to it, to hold it close. Never let it go."
