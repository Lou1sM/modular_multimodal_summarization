        "Brooke is at home reflecting back on happier times with Bill when he shows up at the door. She wonders how he knew she was back. He muses that he has been keeping tabs on her. It has been too long but he has been waiting for her return. She says she is sorry that she intended to let everyone know. Katie goes to the office and Liam welcomes her back and says the whole building is abuzz with her return. She's happy that he is President and her VP, she would not have it any other way. He earned it. He says Bill practically begged her to come back and Bill begs no one. She agrees and says he is even reinstalling some of her initiatives like childcare and will move on from there. He thinks it is great that they will see more of Will around here, a nice happy family. And he does put his stamp of approval of them being a family again. She's back at work for Spencer, she's getting back with Bill. Things are looking up around here. Katie smiles but says she does not want to get her hopes up; she does not want anyone to get their hopes up. Deacon tries to convince a morose Quinn to go out for breakfast. She is not in the mood although he thought she was hungry, perhaps hungry for something else and that will suit him too. He says he is always down for another round. Then she says she has lost her appetite for sure. He says he knows her so well so what's up with her, what gives. She finally says Brooke. She is back in town and she is just wondering how all of this will play out with her and whoever. Deacon finds it amusing that Quinn seems to be jealous. He assures her that he is not with Brooke. He's with Quinn. She says she knows but he does have a child with Brooke and a very sordid past from what she knows. He admits they hooked up, things got hot and heavy, Brooke got pregnant, had Hope and that was the end. Quinn says she will not let him do that, wrap it up in a pretty little package and put a bow on it. She knows Brooke is legendary and some people may call her a sex symbol if you like blondes and she has been known to be in the center of many a scandal. Deacon says yes she has been known to follow her heart. Quinn continues that she had a child, his precious Hope, with her son-in-law and then got involved with her sister's husband. He says in Brooke's defense she did leave town trying to give Bill and Katie a chance and it looks like that is coming true. Deacon asks Quinn if she is not sure she is a little insecure now that Brooke is back in town. After all, he is her man now and he knows she would not like her to make any moves on him. He thinks it is adorable that she is jealous. She threatens to throw something at his head. She says Katie is with Bill or trying to get back with him so that leaves Brooke with no man. He tells her to stop that right now. He is not interested in Brooke nor her with him, that was in the past and he's all about the future. He assures her that he is all about the person he is sharing a life with right now.",
        "Liam jokes with Katie that she could do much better than Bill but she is so good for him. He doesn't fire as many people now, he doesn't scream and he doesn't call Liam at four in the morning asking why he's not at the office yet. He tells her since Brooke left, his dad has been single for the first times in years and he thinks it has humbled him. Katie admits that she likes the way they are connecting now. It feels good. She does not know what is gonna happen but she will try to stay open to whatever comes her way. She asks about him and Ivy and if they have taken it to the next level. He admits they have and she has her own toothbrush at his house. She cajoles next thing she will have drawer space and even a closet. He said he got lucky. She says she thinks Ivy is cool. She was a fan of Hope's but she is in Italy. Liam adds and still married to his brother. She admits it is time for him to move on. Brooke explains to Bill that she was immersed in her work and then Hope came. She's not sure she and Wyatt can work this out and be together. Bill says he is glad she is back. He has been looking forward to this moment. She left him; she walked out on him. She says she was only trying to do the right thing. Bill says he does not need her apology. He's glad she did not contact him and left him alone with his memories. Everybody tried to warn him how Brooke was. He did not want to believe it and look where it got him. They had it all but she turned her back on him. She says she had to. He argues no she didn't, but he's done fighting for her. He doesn't want that anymore. He wants his family and to spend the rest of his life with her sister. He knows before he made a lot of mistakes with Katie. He hurt her terribly and he regrets that but he is going to do everything in his power to win her back and reunite their family. Brooke says good, that is all she ever wanted. She says she knows his frustration with her and perhaps she could have handled this better. But it all worked out in the end. She's a better person for this. She had to take herself out of the equation. It wasn't right to come between him, Katie and his child. She is not unburdening herself, but it is a new beginning. And all the memories he asked about that they shared will be locked away forever."

        "Katie: Okay with you being president and me being vice president?",
        "Liam: I was gonna say your new parking spot, but since you bring that up...",

        "Quinn: Maybe in a little bit.",
        "Deacon: Come on. You said you were hungry. Unless, of course, you were talking about a different kind of hunger, which is fine with me 'cause I'm always down for another round.",
        "Quinn: Oh, please, I have just lost my appetite.",
        "Deacon: What's going on with you?",
        "Quinn: Nothing.",

        "Quinn: Huh?",
        "Deacon: I'm not with her. I'm with you.",

        "Liam: I'm glad you said yes.",
        "Katie: Well, your father is very hard to say no to when he asks for things nicely.",
        "Liam: I know. He practically begged you. Bill Spencer begs no one.",
        "Katie: Don't I know it.",
        "Liam: And did you know he's reinstating some of your old initiatives?",
        "Katie: I'm excited about that. We're gonna start with childcare and move on from there.",
        "Liam: I think that's gonna be cool. It'll be nice to see a little more of will around here. Three of you, little happy family.",
        "Katie: Something like that.",
        "Liam: I think it's great. I think it's great you're part of the Spencer team again, you and my dad are on your way back to working things out. I'm telling you, Katie. I'm telling you. Things are looking up around here.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: How'd you know I was back?",
        "Bill: Keeping tabs on you. Waiting for your return. You've been gone a long time, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Too long. I was planning on letting everybody know that I was home. So, how are you?",
        "Bill: Just need to look at you for a moment. Seeing you like this, I, uh... I can't tell you how it makes me feel.",
        "[Train horn blares]",
        "Deacon: Okay. Um, what do you want to know?",
        "Quinn: All of it.",
        "Deacon: All right, um... Brooke and I hooked up, and it was hot and heavy. She got pregnant. We had hope. The end.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no. You're not gonna wrap this up in a pretty, little package and put a bow on it.",
        "Deacon: You seem to know a lot about it. Why don't you tell me?",
        "Quinn: Come on! Stories about Brooke are legendary!",
        "Deacon: She's the mother of my daughter.",
        "Quinn: Oh, please, I'm not saying anything horrible. At least I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said before.",
        "Deacon: Quinn.",
        "Quinn: What? She is a glamorous, successful businesswoman. Some people might even call her a sex symbol, if you like blondes.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: And, you know, she's been at the center of many a scandal.",
        "Deacon: She has been known to follow her heart. [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Yeah. That's her thing.",
        "Deacon: Got her into trouble in the past.",
        "Quinn: Yes, like sleeping with her daughter's husband and having a child with him, your precious hope.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] Yes, that -- that would be, uh, one instance.",
        "Quinn: Okay, and then getting involved with her sister's husband.",
        "Deacon: Okay, now, in Brooke's defense, I got to say one thing, all right? She left town. She was trying to give, you know, Katie and Bill a chance, actually hoping that it would work out.",
        "Quinn: Well, lucky her. I think her wish has come true.",
        "Katie: Liam, at this point, I'm just trying to see where life takes me.",
        "Liam: You know, it'd be great for will if you and my dad got remarried.",
        "Katie: Well, of course. Having two parents in the home, that's ideal, sure.",
        "Liam: Do you want me to dial it back a bit?",
        "Katie: [Groans] I just don't want to get my hopes up. I don't want anyone to get their hopes up.",
        "Liam: Honestly, the -- the truth is, you could do a lot better than my dad. I mean, you're obviously way out of his league, but you're so good for him is the thing. I mean, he doesn't fire as many people, he doesn't scream as much, he doesn't call me at 4:00 in the morning asking why I'm not in the office yet. I mean, you -- you make him a better person.",
        "Katie: I didn't realize I was such a positive influence.",
        "Liam: Actually, the truth is, since Brooke left, my dad's been completely single, completely alone for the first time in years, and I think it's humbled him.",
        "Katie: I like the way we're connecting. It...it feels good.",
        "Liam: There you go.",
        "Katie: I don't know what's gonna happen, but I'm just gonna try to stay open to whatever comes my way.",
        "Bill: It does something to me, standing here in front of you.",
        "Brooke: What does it do to you?",
        "Bill: I look at that pretty blonde hair, your beautiful green eyes, that mouth. I called, Brooke. I texted. I e-mailed. No response.",
        "Brooke: I know. I-I'm sorry. I was really immersed in my work, and hope came.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I know. I wanted to give you your space.",
        "Brooke: She's having a really rough time, you know, dealing with the loss of her child. I'm not even sure if her and Wyatt are gonna be able to work things out.",
        "Bill: Well, if it's meant to be... I'm glad you're back. I've looked forward to this moment, the opportunity to tell you how I feel. You left, Brooke. You walked out on us.",
        "Brooke: Bill...",
        "Bill: You walked out on me.",
        "Katie: Okay, enough about me and my somewhat tragic love life. I want to hear about you. How are things going with you and Ivy?",
        "Liam: Good.",
        "Katie: Good?",
        "Liam: Really, really good. Yeah.",
        "Katie: Yeah?",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Katie: Well, have things moved on to the next level?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Yeah, maybe.",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm so happy for you!",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: I, uh, I will say this. She does have a toothbrush at my place now.",
        "Katie: A toothbrush? Before you know it, she's gonna have a drawer, you'll be making room in the closet.",
        "Liam: Okay, don't -- don't go too crazy.",
        "Katie: I'm excited. Ivy's a cool girl.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, she is. She's -- she's smart, she's easygoing, she's hilarious. I-I got really lucky.",
        "Katie: Good. You know, I was always a fan of you and hope, but she's in Italy.",
        "Liam: Yeah, she's in Italy. She's also still married to my brother.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and there's that. I'm glad you're moving on. It's time.",
        "Liam: Could say the same for you and my dad.",
        "Katie: Oh, man.",
        "Quinn: You haven't heard.",
        "Deacon: What? Heard what?",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Well, uh, it seems that Bill has made Liam president of Spencer and Katie vice president.",
        "Deacon: Well, I'll be damned. Hey, you know, maybe Bill and Katie are together.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, who knows for sure.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] Hey, look, stranger things have happened, right? Come on. Look at you and me. Who the hell saw that coming?",
        "Quinn: Is it really strange?",
        "Deacon: Little bit.",
        "Quinn: Really?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. Kinda.",
        "Quinn: You and me?",
        "Deacon: Just kidding.",
        "Quinn: Well, makes you wonder. Bill and Katie are together again. [Sighs] Where does that leave Brooke?",
        "Brooke: I don't know what to say. I was trying to do the right thing.",
        "Bill: I don't need your apology, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I'm grateful you did what you did. I'm grateful that you didn't try to call, didn't reach out. I'm thankful that you let me be.",
        "Brooke: Bill... [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I am curious, though. Did you ever think about us? All the memories, everything we shared? Do you want to know how I felt when I thought about those memories? How much I loved you? And how blind I was. You know, everybody warned me about you, and I... I didn't want to believe it. And look where it got me. We had it all. And you turned your back on us.",
        "Brooke: I had to.",
        "Bill: No, you didn't. I'm done fighting for you, Brooke. I don't want it anymore. What I want is my family. And to spend the rest of my life with your sister.",
        "Deacon: Okay, so why are you so concerned about Brooke, huh?",
        "Quinn: It's just fascinating.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: How she jumps from one guy to the next. Just makes you wonder who her next victim -- I mean, boyfriend -- is going to be.",
        "Deacon: Well, men have always been her vice.",
        "Quinn: Wow. That's healthy. So, you take away her vice, and what's gonna fill the void?",
        "Deacon: Are you sure you're not just, like, a little bit insecure now that Brooke's back in town?",
        "Quinn: Why would I be?",
        "Deacon: Well, 'cause I'm yours, and you don't want anybody making any moves on your man.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Deacon: Yeah. Busted.",
        "Quinn: Your ego is massive.",
        "Deacon: My ego? I got to tell you, this is so adorable! You're jealous of Brooke!",
        "Quinn: I am going to throw something at your head.",
        "Deacon: You know, that's fine, all right? You know what? You'd never admit it anyway, so...",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You know what? It wasn't too long ago that I had the misguided notion that Bill would come back to me.",
        "Deacon: Oh, really?",
        "Quinn: He is with Katie now, or at least he wants to be, which means that he's no longer an option for Brooke. So she's alone with no man!",
        "Deacon: Let me stop you right there. Baby, I'm not interested in Brooke, and she's not interested in me. And that's -- it's all in the past, and I'm all about the future. I'm about the person that I'm sharing my life with right now. And I'm looking right into her beautiful blue eyes.",
        "Katie: I-I really never thought that Bill and I would have a chance. I wasn't really sure that I wanted one.",
        "Liam: Good, ol' dad working his magic.",
        "Katie: He's just so charming when he wants something.",
        "Liam: I know. How dare he?",
        "Katie: You know, despite everything that's happened, I... I have to be grateful to Brooke for stepping away and giving us some space to maybe rediscover each other. And who knows? If things continue to go well... maybe we can be a family again.",
        "Bill: I made a lot of mistakes with Katie. I hurt her terribly, and I regret that. And I'm gonna do everything I can to win her back, to reunite my family.",
        "Brooke: Good. I mean, that's what I've been hoping for.",
        "Bill: Great. Then everybody's happy.",
        "Brooke: Look, I can understand your frustration with me. I-I probably could have handled this in a better way. But it all worked out in the end. I'm happy for you and Katie and for myself. I'm really a better person because of this. I had to take myself out of the equation. I couldn't come between you and Katie. You're will's father. It just -- it's not right.",
        "Bill: So, this is all about you unburdening yourself?",
        "Brooke: No. It's about you and Katie and your family. It's about a new beginning. And all of the memories that we've had together... they're going to be locked away forever.",
