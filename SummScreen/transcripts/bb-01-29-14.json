Brooke drops in at Liam's to see Bill. He feels a lecture coming on. She asks when did he see Katie last. He's not sure what she is getting at. She tells him she was just there this afternoon when she asked Ridge to marry her. Bill finds that funny. But he's not getting back with Katie and he's not giving up on Brooke either. He tells her just be glad that the hypocrite turned her down. He has one set of standards for himself and another whole less forgiving set for Brooke. She's too good for him and deserves better. Kick that loser to the curb and don't look back. He might be interested in something else anyway. He's certainly not a saint and he might have a whole other life in Paris that Brooke knows nothing about. She says she has complete faith in Ridge so she doesn't have to ask him anything. Afterwards Bill calls Justin and tells him to dig up what he can on Ridge Forrester ASAP. He has a lot riding on this. He wants to know everything he did in Paris. Liam is high-tailing it out of town on PCH and clearly he has mud in his eyes.",

        "Hope: Cocktails and camping. Who knew?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. Did you notice?",
        "Hope: Mm?",
        "Wyatt: The drinks -- emerald drinks, Emerald Bay.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Get it?",
        "Hope: I get it.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Emerald Bay. That's a surfing spot, isn't it?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. South of here on PCH.",
        "Charlie: Hey, hey, hey. Maybe that's it. Maybe that's where they stopped.",
        "Pam: [Chuckles] How do you figure that?",
        "Charlie: Well, from what Caroline said. She said Wyatt and Hope were going south on PCH.",
        "Liam: Yeah, on a surfing safari.",
        "Pam: Yeah, but why Emerald Bay? There's lots of other surfing sites along the co-- unless -- are you thinking --",
        "Charlie: Call me wacky, but, you know, I think Wyatt's got emeralds on the brain because that's the focus of Quinn's new collection.",
        "Liam: Yes. Yes, yes, yes. That -- that's what Wyatt meant. It all makes sense now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I thought that was your car pulling up. This is nice change of pace. Usually I'm the one who shows up at your door unexpected.",
        "Brooke: [Clears throat] Well, I tried your phone several times, and it went straight to voicemail.",
        "Bill: Yeah. I was working out. How did you know I'd be here? Oh, well. Where else would I be? I'm not at the office.",
        "Brooke: Would you mind putting your shirt back on?",
        "Bill: Afraid you can't control yourself?",
        "Brooke: Don't make me regret coming over here.",
        "Bill: Oh, boy. Why do I think I have a lecture coming?",
        "Brooke: So, when was the last time you saw Katie?",
        "Bill: Why? Is there something wrong?",
        "Brooke: I was over there earlier to thank her for supporting me.",
        "Bill: Supporting you? What do you mean?",
        "Brooke: Oh, I-I asked Ridge to marry me.",
        "Bill: That's funny, but I thought I heard you say that you asked Ridge to marry you, but I couldn't have heard that, could I?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, and she urged him to do that even after everything that we've been through together.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Right. Whatever. So, did Ridge accept your proposal?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: No. Of course, he didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: What makes sense?",
        "Liam: Something Wyatt said. He -- he said he was taking Hope somewhere special and I'd be green with envy.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Jealousy con guacamole.",
        "Liam: Right? I mean, it sounded weird at the time, but...",
        "Pam: What are you gonna do?",
        "Liam: I'm going to Emerald Bay. I got to tell Hope everything.",
        "Charlie: I will send you the security footage. You can show her the evidence.",
        "Liam: Great.",
        "Pam: Wyatt is not going to be able to talk his way out of this one.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Neither will his mother. Oh, Quinn. No. You know what? I'll deal with her when I get back.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Go get him.",
        "Liam: Hey. Thank you, guys. If you hadn't told me --",
        "Charlie: No, look. I-I'm so sorry. I never should have let that b--",
        "Pam: Now, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: Woman intimidate me.",
        "Pam: We're pulling for you and Hope! Whoa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: What's in these?",
        "Wyatt: You feeling a little lightheaded?",
        "Hope: Mm.",
        "Wyatt: I'm still high on last night.",
        "Hope: Me, too. It was a huge step -- going away with you. But...now, knowing each other the way we do, I feel like you've really proved yourself to me in all the ways that truly count.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I didn't come here to talk about Ridge and me.",
        "Bill: You want to talk about us instead? I'm all for that.",
        "Brooke: I'll ask you again. When did you last see Katie?",
        "Bill: [Chuckling] What difference does it make? It's not happening for your sister and me, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but if you change your ways, it could happen.",
        "Bill: Change my ways meaning give up on us? That's not gonna happen.",
        "Brooke: Everything is different now, Bill.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Because Ridge is back in the equation again? Only he's not. I mean, he wants you to think he is, but he's not.",
        "Brooke: Have you spoken to him?",
        "Bill: Just be glad that the hypocrite turned you down. Because he has one set of standards for himself and a whole 'nother less-forgiving set for you.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: You're too good for him. You deserve better. How many times do I have to say that until you finally believe it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Wyatt remembering]",
        "Liam: Wyatt, I know what you're doing.",
        "Wyatt: I just want to spend some time alone with Hope. Whatever happens, happens.",
        "[Back to present]",
        "Hope: You told Liam that?!",
        "Wyatt: I wanted to be totally up front.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] You wanted to rub it in.",
        "Wyatt: That I got the girl and he didn't? No. Why would I want to rub that in?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Oh! This trip -- this trip could have turned out way differently. You did not know that you had me.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Hope: Yeah. You could have...burned the marshmallows or forgotten them altogether.",
        "Wyatt: I don't leave anything to chance. Not when it comes to you.",
        "Hope: And this whole time I thought you were all about winging it.",
        "Wyatt: Mostly, yeah. But sometimes you got to plan ahead to create the perfect moment with the perfect woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: It's not what I deserve that counts. It's what Katie deserves.",
        "Bill: I can't give Katie what she deserves. Tried and failed.",
        "Brooke: Oh, the great Bill Spencer never fails at anything he truly wants.",
        "Bill: Okay, well, doesn't that tell you something? If I wanted my marriage back, I'd have it.",
        "Brooke: You're gonna have to get her to trust you first.",
        "Bill: I think I have a better chance of getting my company back.",
        "Brooke: You can have both -- your wife and Spencer Publications.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] Katie stopped being my wife a long time ago. And the world hasn't come to an end, has it? Unless you're here to tell me otherwise.",
        "Brooke: Actually, she's a lot stronger than I've seen her in a long time. She's showing interest in things that she loves, like poetry.",
        "Bill: Poetry. Hmm. Okay, well, there you have it. Katie is refocusing her life. Why can't you do the same? Why wait around for Ridge when he rebuffed your proposal? Kick that loser to the curb and don't look back. For all you know, he could be interested in someone else, anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Okay. Security footage is on its way.",
        "Pam: What if we're wrong, Charlie, and they're not in Emerald Bay?",
        "Charlie: That won't matter to Liam. He will track his honey down as long as it takes.",
        "Pam: Hey, Charlie, you are not responsible for this. Wyatt and Morticia are.",
        "Charlie: You think she'll lose her job and Wyatt, too?",
        "Pam: Well, Wyatt should have known better than staging a heist.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, overprotective mommy said he did it for love.",
        "Pam: I know. But I also know Hope. And this ain't gonna fly with her. She values honesty above anything else. And Wyatt may have been pretending to be Mr. Honorable, but --",
        "Charlie: Liam is going to so bust him. He's gonna show Hope the real Wyatt.",
        "Pam: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Emerald Bay, 20 miles. 20 miles.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You know, this trip is filled with perfect moments.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? What's your favorite so far?",
        "Hope: Do you really have to ask?",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Close your eyes.",
        "Hope: Why?",
        "Wyatt: Just close them tight.",
        "Hope: [Chuckling] Okay. How long?",
        "Wyatt: How long what?",
        "Hope: How long do I keep them closed? Wyatt? Wyatt? What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Liam: Dial Hope's cell.",
        "[Dialing]",
        "[Ringing]",
        "Hope: Hi. You've reached Hope. I'm not here, so please leave a message.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Liam: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: No peeking.",
        "Hope: I don't peek. I don't. Except, you know, for that one time that Santa came and gave presents to us, but all kids do that, right? [Chuckles] Wyatt, what is going on?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. Okay. Reach out in front of you on the table.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, what is this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Any, uh, any sign of Quinn?",
        "Pam: Nada. But I've been keeping an eagle eye out.",
        "Charlie: Right.",
        "Pam: What you got there?",
        "Charlie: Huh? Oh. It's emeralds from the new shipment.",
        "Pam: Ooh.",
        "Charlie: Mm. How 'bout those babies?",
        "Pam: Wowee-wow-wow-wow.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, Quinn's gonna use them in her next collection.",
        "Pam: Or she thinks she is. But the tables are about to turn.",
        "Charlie: You know, Liam should be pulling into Emerald Bay just about now.",
        "Pam: I hope your hunch is right.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Wyatt knew about the emeralds. He said Liam would be green with envy. I hope that Liam introduces Wyatt to two more colors. Black and blue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: 5 miles. [Exhales sharply]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Ridge isn't interested in another woman.",
        "Bill: So why his reluctance to take you back?",
        "Brooke: He just needs a little more time. Just like you and Katie need a little more time.",
        "Bill: [Scoffs] Katie and share a son, Brooke, and that's a bond we will have for life. But a month from now, 10 months from now, nothing will have changed. I want you, not your sister. And by that time, Ridge will, of course, have shown his true colors, disappointed you yet again, and probably headed back to Paris.",
        "Brooke: No, Ridge is not going back to Paris. R.J.'s in school here now.",
        "Bill: Come on. R.J. is not his only draw to Paris.",
        "Brooke: If you mean International --",
        "Bill: What I mean is that you really know nothing about his life over there, do you? Outside of the office, outside of being a father to R.J., you know nothing, right?",
        "Brooke: Because there's nothing to know.",
        "Bill: Brook, come on! We're talking about Paris, the city of l'amour, gorgeous women at every turn. Now, Ridge fancies himself as quite the playboy, right? Quite the ladies man? You don't think he had a fling or two, maybe something more serious, and that's why he won't recommit to you? The man is no saint. I mean, maybe he had a whole other life over there that he never told you a thing about. Maybe that's why he wants you to feel guilty for your relationship with me, because he feels guilty for being unfaithful to you. You ever think about that?",
        "Brooke: This is beneath you, Bill. I know you have issues with Ridge, but still --",
        "Bill: I have issues with how he treated you over the years, how he's still treating you, and how you let yourself be treated.",
        "Brooke: Ridge and I are fine.",
        "Bill: Okay. Well, are you so fine that you won't even consider the possibility that he hasn't told you everything that went on in Paris? Ask him. Ask Forrester how he spent over a year away. I think the answer might surprise you.",
        "Brooke: No, it won't. I know Ridge, and I have complete faith in him.",
        "Bill: He doesn't deserve it.",
        "Brooke: I still believe in you and Katie.",
        "Bill: Yeah? Well, I still believe in you and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Hey, I need you to do something for me.",
        "Justin: Sure, Boss. Anything.",
        "Bill: Ridge Forrester. He was in Paris for over a year, alone. Find out what he was up to.",
        "Justin: Up to?",
        "Bill: Do I have to draw you a picture? He's a playboy. And I know all about being a playboy from back in the day.",
        "Justin: Okay, so you think he was involved with someone.",
        "Bill: Or a string of someones.",
        "Justin: [Chuckles] Bill, you're still holding out hope for you and Brooke.",
        "Bill: Just do what I ask, Justin. Dig up whatever you can on Forrester, and do it A.S.A.P. I have a lot riding on this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Yes! Finally.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: I am a sucker for love as much as anyone. But what Wyatt did -- he's got to own up to it, Charlie, and make it right.",
        "Charlie: With Hope, you mean.",
        "Pam: Hope, Liam, you. No, I still can't believe what he did to you, Charlie, how he used you. Trust me, when Liam gets done with him, I've got a few choice words for Wyatt Fuller, too.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God. Wyatt, this is beautiful.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, we've just taken a big step in our relationship, so...",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] I love this. I love it. Emerald bracelet.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hope: Emerald Bay. Diamond Head. I'm beginning to see a trend here. I think it might be a really good thing having a jeweler as a boyfriend.",
        "Wyatt: Say that again.",
        "Hope: It's a good thing having a jeweler as a boyfriend.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Guess we're officially a couple now.",
        "Liam: Game over, Wyatt. Rock 'n' roll."
