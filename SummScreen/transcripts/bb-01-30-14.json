        "Hope wonders how Liam found them. Wyatt says enough chit chat. They are in the middle of something so goodbye. Liam says oh he will leave and so will Hope when he tells her what he came to say. Wyatt tells Liam to have a little pride and just leave. Liam says he's not going to embarrass himself and he's not going to ask to be alone with Hope. He wants Wyatt to be here for this. It's about Wyatt and a certain jewelry heist. Rick is with Pam talking about the shipment of emeralds and she blurts out that Wyatt is the problem. He is not the hero. Rick is taken aback and asks why the Wyatt bashing. She says he's bad for Hope, her line and the company. She has something to show him. Brooke meets Ridge for lunch and she immediately apologizes for putting him on the spot at Katie's when she drug out her ring and tried to get him to put it back on her finger. She says it's almost now as if they just met. He says a lot has happened in the last year. She wants to know what he did in Paris. He quips if she is writing a book. She says he just seems to have changed some. They look up and see Caroline come in with Katie. Ridge doesn't want them to join them and Brooke says good, she just wanted some one on one time with him. Katie spots them too and while she tries to make small talk with Caroline her eyes keep darting over to Ridge. Justin is with Bill at the cliff house. He wants to know how far should he dive. Bill says all the way to the bottom and when he finds something Brooke will be his again. The only one standing in the way of that is Ridge. He is going to a run and wants Justin to keep digging. He is sure he will find something about Ridge in Paris. Rick is astounded at what Pam is showing him about Wyatt. She says there is a fox in the henhouse for sure. Rick says and that fox is on the beach somewhere with his sister. Pam says hopefully they are not alone anymore.",
        "Wyatt asks Liam if this can wait and Liam answers he doesn't think so. This is about the attempted heist at the Boutique when Wyatt's attempt at bravery saved the day. Wyatt says enough. He and Hope are going for a walk and Liam better be gone when they get back. Liam tells Wyatt that he is looking like he's coming undone. Hope wants to know what is going on. Liam shows her the surveillance footage of Wyatt stealing the diamond. He says the robbers were real but they didn't steal the diamond. Wyatt is the one who faked the heist for publicity and it just so happened that real robbers were there and got caught because Wyatt slipped the diamond in their bag so now they are the culprits. Hope is livid. She begs Wyatt to tell her that is not what happened. All Wyatt can say is that they were thieves and they do belong in jail. Wyatt panics and wants a minute with Hope. Liam tells him his time is up, but Hope asks for a moment. Brooke continues on her campaign of saying yes she did something terrible and she will regret it the rest of her life, but they used to be able to get through these things. She says they haven't lost what they had .or have they. Ridge keeps glancing at Katie and at different times she looks at him. Caroline talks up a storm about Ridge and what an icon he is. And she can't imagine him with anyone but Brooke. Liam calls Rick and says he's at Emerald Bay with Hope. He thinks she is breaking it up with Wyatt right now; at least he hopes she is. Wyatt asks Hope if he can say something. He says he did not do this to hurt her. She says he did just the same. He made a mockery of everything she cared about in one stupid move. He admits it was a stupid prank. She says yes, just look at all the publicity they got from magazines and the internet and now all based on a lie \u0096 his lie. He asks her not to blow this out of proportion. She says after all of this time, he still doesn't understand who she is or what she stands for or maybe this is all a big joke to him. She says she believed in him, she was starting to believe in \"us\". She adds that she brought him into her life, into the company. She took a gamble on him and his mother. She ends by saying she gave herself to him, and he gave her a lie. He pleads with her to please wait, not to leave. Katie can't keep her eyes off Brooke who is trying to play footsie with Ridge. Finally her and Ridge's eyes meet. Bill comes back from his run and Justin has found something interesting. Bill cannot believe he is seeing what he thinks he sees."

        "Liam: Giving Hope a bracelet?",
        "Wyatt: It's nice, isn't it?",
        "Liam: Emerald. Emerald Bay. That's clever, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Enough chitchat. Goodbye.",
        "Liam: Oh, don't worry, Wyatt. I'm going, and so is Hope when she hears what I have to say.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: The containers from Beijing?",
        "Pam: Yeah. That's in. We're clearing it with customs.",
        "Rick: Well, what about the shipment of emeralds?",
        "Pam: Oh, the emeralds. Yes, the emeralds. Charlie's on top of the emeralds.",
        "Rick: You know, he's been vigilant ever since the attempted robbery.",
        "Pam: [Sighs] [Chuckles] Attempted robbery. Right.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Charlie did his job. Along with the help of Wyatt, of course.",
        "Pam: The help of Wyatt? Wyatt is the problem! He is not the hero!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Katie: Listen, I can understand why she's loved you all these years, Ridge. You're a good guy. You're decent. And, believe me, after everything I've been through with Bill, it's nice to be around a man who treats women with respect and kindness.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] First of all, I'm sorry.",
        "Ridge: For what?",
        "Brooke: For putting you on the spot the other day at Katie's.",
        "Ridge: I survived it.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Yeah. Bringing my engagement ring and trying to get you to put it back on my finger.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. That's typical Logan, isn't it?",
        "Brooke: Well, it was inappropriate and impulsive. That would be me.",
        "Ridge: I used to love that about you.",
        "Brooke: Until I crossed the line with my sister's husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: We got our P.I.'s on it. How deep do you want me to dive?",
        "Bill: Straight to the bottom. Anything you can dredge up.",
        "Justin: Ridge kept a pretty low profile while in Paris.",
        "Bill: Well, he wasn't living like a monk. Trust me.",
        "Justin: He just kept it under the radar.",
        "Bill: Not ours. You'll find something.",
        "Justin: And when I do?",
        "Bill: And when you do, he's done. And Brooke will be mine. Again.",
        "Justin: You really think this is gonna make a difference.",
        "Bill: I know it will. I want Brooke back. And the only thing standing in my way is Ridge.",
        "Justin: And he's hiding something.",
        "Bill: Gone for over a year, living in Paris? He wasn't staying in a hotel room every night. At least, not alone.",
        "Justin: Got to be careful on this, Bill.",
        "Bill: Why?",
        "Justin: 'Cause if you dig up dirt on Forrester, Brooke can hold it against you.",
        "Bill: No. She won't. Listen, the only reason she's making a play for Ridge is because she wants me back with Katie. It's purely out of guilt. But that's not gonna happen.",
        "Justin: You're over Katie?",
        "Bill: I'll never be completely over her. She's the mother of my son. She's a hell of a woman. But I love Brooke, and I want her as my wife.",
        "Justin: So, let her see Ridge for who he is.",
        "Bill: That's the plan.",
        "Justin: I hope this works.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Things have been pretty tough for you over there, haven't they?",
        "Justin: Totally marginalized. Lucky I'm still with the company.",
        "Bill: Well, hang in there, my friend. We expose Ridge for the playboy he is, and things are gonna get better... for both of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Brooke: I feel a little foolish trying to force your hand like that.",
        "Ridge: Oh, stop it. You were trying to help your sister.",
        "Brooke: Yes. I was trying to do that. But you and I have been through so much.",
        "Ridge: Hey. I'm not judging you. We've both made mistakes.",
        "Brooke: I'm assuming mine is worse than yours. So, when do you think you're going to...get over it?",
        "Ridge: Get over what? You giving yourself to Spencer?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: It's more than that.",
        "Brooke: Is it?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. It changed my perspective on a lot of things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: What's with all the Wyatt bashing?",
        "Pam: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: I thought you liked the guy.",
        "Pam: He hoodwinked us, Rick -- Hope, Liam, Charlie, the company, all of us.",
        "Rick: In what way, Pam?",
        "Pam: Are you ready for the scam of the century? 'Cause I got something to show you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, do yourself a favor, Liam. Just leave. Have some pride.",
        "Liam: Oh, don't worry, brother. I promise not to embarrass myself.",
        "Wyatt: Look, if you think that I'm gonna let you have another minute alone with Hope --",
        "Liam: No, no, no. I want you here for this.",
        "Hope: What is it, Liam?",
        "Liam: Something you need to know, Hope.",
        "Hope: About...?",
        "Liam: Wyatt and a certain jewelry heist.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Anything?",
        "Justin: No. We're, uh, just getting started.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, it shouldn't take long. A guy like Forrester -- different woman every other week.",
        "Justin: Sure didn't advertise it. I'm finding nothing in the French tabloids.",
        "Bill: You will. Keep at it. I'm going for a run.",
        "Justin: All right. If it's out there, I'll dig it up.",
        "Bill: Forrester's hiding something. I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I feel so strange. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Brooke: It's almost like we've just met.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Maybe it's that year we had apart.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, maybe. A lot's happened.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, for me. What about for you?",
        "Ridge: I needed the time.",
        "Brooke: So, what did you do with all that time?",
        "Ridge: I walked a lot and thought a lot.",
        "Brooke: Anything else?",
        "Ridge: Why, you writing a book?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] You just seem...different.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, but not because of the time away.",
        "Brooke: So, you've changed just since you've been back here in L.A.?",
        "Ridge: Well, I had a few bombshells thrown at me.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, if I knew you were coming back --",
        "Ridge: You wouldn't have gone back to Spencer? Honestly, I can't fathom how -- [Sighs] But it's not like we haven't dealt with this before, right?",
        "Brooke: If you want her to come over here...",
        "Ridge: No, no.",
        "Brooke: You sure? Well, good. Because I wanted some one-on-one time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Oh. Look, there's, uh, Ridge and Brooke.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Caroline: Do you want to go somewhere else?",
        "Katie: No, no. Of course not.",
        "Caroline: Things are...okay between you and Brooke?",
        "Katie: They're a lot better than they were.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Katie's incredible.",
        "Ridge: Yes, she is. Lot of integrity.",
        "Brooke: And a lot of loyalty. She wants her family together. And so do I.",
        "Katie: So, how are things with you and Rick?",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Marital bliss. I'm sorry. You probably don't want to hear that.",
        "Katie: No, of course I do. I'm happy for you.",
        "Caroline: You know, sometimes I just -- I think that it's like honeymoon syndrome and that it's all gonna end -- that one morning, he's gonna wake up and see me without makeup and swallow real hard.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] With the right guy, that doesn't happen.",
        "Caroline: No. I guess it doesn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Unbelievable. [Sighs] Wyatt -- he orchestrated this whole damn robbery.",
        "Pam: Yeah. With the unknown help of a couple of real jewel thieves. [Sighs] I don't know, Rick. There's a fox in the hen house. What would any self- respecting farmer do? Get rid of the fox.",
        "Rick: And that fox is on a beach somewhere with my sister in a camper.",
        "Pam: Hopefully they're not alone. Well, not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: This can wait.",
        "Liam: I don't think so.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. This is about the attempted robbery?",
        "Liam: That's right. At the boutique. Wyatt's incredible act of bravery that saved the day.",
        "Wyatt: All right. Enough. Hope, we're going for a walk, and you better be gone by the time we get back.",
        "Liam: What's the matter, Wyatt? You seem a little undone.",
        "Hope: What is going on here?",
        "Liam: I have something to show you.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Okay, what is it?",
        "Liam: A video.",
        "Wyatt: Knock it off.",
        "Hope: A video of what?",
        "Liam: Taken by the surveillance camera at the boutique on the day of the robbery.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] This is insane.",
        "Liam: Yeah, indeed, it was. Now watch the mirror.",
        "Hope: Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Let's do it again. Let's watch it again.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Wyatt, what's going on here?",
        "Liam: What does it look like? He stole your diamond.",
        "Hope: Are you saying that those men weren't real thieves?",
        "Wyatt: Yes, they were real, guns and all.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but they didn't steal the diamond, did they, Wyatt? You were gonna fake the robbery for publicity, and it just so happened that a couple of bad guys walked through the door at the same time, and that sure made your job easier, didn't it? Slip the diamond in their bag, and now they're the culprits.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. Wyatt, pl-- this isn't what happened. Tell me that that's not what happened.",
        "Wyatt: It's...",
        "Hope: Oh, my God. Wyatt! Oh, my God. Those men are now in prison for something that they didn't do!",
        "Wyatt: They're jewel thieves. Hope, they belong in jail.",
        "Hope: Not for what happened at the boutique.",
        "Liam: Yeah, she's right. You do.",
        "Wyatt: Can you just give us a minute?",
        "Hope: Oh, my God.",
        "Liam: I think your time is up, Wyatt.",
        "Hope: Liam, uh, please...",
        "Liam: Of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I think Katie's starting to forgive me.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's your sister.",
        "Brooke: And if she can forgive me --",
        "Ridge: Hey. It's not that simple.",
        "Brooke: It's not really that complicated. Yes, I did something terrible, and I will regret for the rest of my life. But you and I used to be able to get through these things.",
        "Ridge: So, what does that mean? That's gonna be our history and our legacy?",
        "Brooke: Can't really fight history. We haven't lost what we had. Have we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I got to work with him today.",
        "Katie: Ridge?",
        "Caroline: What a talent. You know, I felt like I was working with this creative icon, you know? He's not bad on the eyes, either. [Chuckles] Your sister's been lucky to have him all these years.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, everyone says they belong together.",
        "Caroline: And talk about the stories. Whoa. Those two are legendary. And I can't imagine anyone else with Ridge but Brooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I know you said you needed some space. I really don't want to pressure you, but... sitting here like this, just the two of us, brings back a lot of memories.",
        "Ridge: Make-up dinners.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. We had a lot of those.",
        "Ridge: Yes, we did. And then we'd start over.",
        "Brooke: Eventually, yes.",
        "Ridge: Eventually?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Most of the time, those make-up dinners ended up in the bedroom.",
        "Ridge: Yes. I could never resist you.",
        "Brooke: We had something special in that category.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: Now, I know you said you needed some time and space, but sometimes I think it's important to push things along a little bit.",
        "Ridge: You were always good at that.",
        "Brooke: Yes, I was. And you were...",
        "Ridge: Hey, hey, hey. Choose your words wisely.",
        "Brooke: We could try again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I haven't spent that much time with Ridge, but people say that he's different now. Do you think he is?",
        "Katie: I guess I'm seeing another side of him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What do we have here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Rick: It's Rick. Where are you?",
        "Liam: Emerald Bay.",
        "Rick: Oh, good. You're with Hope?",
        "Liam: Oh, you heard, huh?",
        "Rick: Pam told me. Uh, can you put Hope on?",
        "Liam: Um...no. She's...talking with Wyatt.",
        "Rick: What?!",
        "Liam: I mean, I-I think she's breaking up with him, Rick. [Sighs] At least I hope she is.",
        "Wyatt: Can I say something?",
        "Hope: No. [Sighs] How could you do this?",
        "Wyatt: I didn't do it to hurt you, Hope.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, don't you see? You did hurt me. You did. You've made a mockery out of everything that I care about in one stupid move.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. It was a dumb prank.",
        "Hope: Yeah, it was dumb. It was insane! Ugh, all the publicity that we've gotten -- the magazine covers, the pictures on the internet, that was all based on a lie. Your lie!",
        "Wyatt: Let's not blow this out of proportion.",
        "Hope: After all this time, do you still not understand who I am? Do you not get what I stand for, or is it all just a big joke to you? I trusted you, Wyatt. I believed in you. I-I started to believe in us.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I...",
        "Hope: I brought you into my life. I brought into this company. I took a gamble on you and your mother. I stuck my neck out for you, and this is what you do? After everything that's happened, after everything that we've shared, especially the past couple days... I gave myself to you, and you gave me a lie.",
        "Wyatt: Hope, Hope, no. Hope, don't.",
        "Hope: Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Please, please, okay? Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: You okay?",
        "Katie: Hmm? Oh. Uh, yeah. I-I'm fine.",
        "Caroline: It's always on your mind, isn't it?",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Caroline: What do you think, miss C.E.O.? I couldn't run a business. It would run me ragged.",
        "Katie: Mm. Yeah. I guess, but...lately, I've kind of had other things on my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: All the challenges we faced, but that was the one thing we knew we could count on.",
        "Ridge: Our bedroom was sacred.",
        "Brooke: And still is. Or it could be.",
        "Ridge: No, it can't. You -- you and Bill -- just the idea --",
        "Brooke: We're over.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Brooke: It's finished. This is a lot harder for you than I thought it would be.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. It is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: [Panting] How's it going?",
        "Justin: Oh, man. Uh...it's done. You will not believe what I found. This is what Ridge was doing in Paris the whole time.",
        "Bill: What do you got? What do you got? What the --? Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?",
