        "[Rick singing in Italian]",
        "Brooke: Listen to you!",
        "Rick: Mom, hey.",
        "Brooke: Wow, I knew you were taking singing lessons, but I had no idea you were this good.",
        "Rick: Oh, you know, I had a really good coach.",
        "Brooke: Rick, you have a gift.",
        "Rick: Thank you, and you know what, I'm not really ready to share it with anybody, so if you could just keep it to yourself I'd appreciate it.",
        "Brooke: Are you crazy? The rest of the family would love to hear you singing in Italian.",
        "Rick: I did pick up extra language while working at International, yeah.",
        "Brooke: You really liked being there, didn't you?",
        "Rick: I loved it.",
        "Brooke: Is that because you were away from us and all of our problems?",
        "Rick: No, no, I just loved the European way of life, you know? Their culture -- Europeans just know how to have a good time. You know, life is not all about work to them.",
        "Brooke: So that's why you're not at work? It's more European.",
        "Rick: No, I'm just taking the day off.",
        "Brooke: Is that because you need to decompress, or you're trying to stay away from Stephanie?",
        "[Rick sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Stephanie should be here any minute.",
        "Felicia: Dad, relax! Mom's coming to the office like she has a million times before.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well not this office. I mean, she and I created Forrester Creations a thousand years ago. Well, we did. And I know she would have wanted to help with Forrester Originals.",
        "Ridge: Oh, she's helping all right, by keeping a low profile in Chicago with Grandmother.",
        "Pam: You want a little more coffee, Eric?",
        "Eric: Yes please, Pam.",
        "Felicia: Mom, welcome back!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, hi honey.",
        "Ridge: Hey, Mother. How's Grandmother?",
        "Stephanie: Cranky as ever.",
        "Felicia: Speaking of which, we have missed you.",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's so sweet to hear. Hi. Wow! You know, I was going to apologize because my temper cost us our old company, but when I see what you have accomplished here -- I know now that nobody can beat us.",
        "Ridge: That's right.",
        "Stephanie: Ridge, Eric, this just gives me absolute confidence in what our coming success is going to be.",
        "Eric: Good, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I've locked up Harrison's west coast retailers. I've also got Chen's market share in Asia.",
        "Jackie: And you've paid a premium for both of those companies. I could understand if you controlled the major couture retailers, the Forresters are not going to be able to sell their collections, that makes sense. If you could get them all, Nicky. But Lauren Fenmore is not going to sell to you. And Harvey Golden, he won't even return our phone calls.",
        "Nick: One region at a time, Mother. The Midwest, the East Coast, that can wait. Right now I need Asia. And you're going to get it for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Taylor: Hi.",
        "Thorne: Hey.",
        "Taylor: Hey.",
        "Thorne: Thanks for coming.",
        "Taylor: Everything okay? Where's Aly?",
        "Thorne: She's at preschool.",
        "Taylor: Oh. How's she doing?",
        "Thorne: That's what I want to talk to you about.",
        "Taylor: She still hasn't gotten any closer to forgiving me for what happened to her mother?",
        "Thorne: Taylor, I've told her that it was an accident. And we talk about it everyday. I think she's beginning to understand, but it's just slow-going. She needs time. Maybe a lot of time. Okay, I know we agreed to work through this together, but --",
        "Taylor: No, Aly's your daughter. She needs to come first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You and Yvette St. Julienne. You go way back.",
        "Jackie: I mean, we're business acquaintances, but I haven't seen her, not since the spring collection.",
        "Nick: Well, get reacquainted. I want you to call her. Set up a meeting with her.",
        "Jackie: At her headquarters in Paris?",
        "Nick: No, I want the meeting here. I'll send a jet for her if I have to. We got a move on this, Mother. We got to move on it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Marone can't compete with us.",
        "Bridget: Well, Nick is certainly motivated to try, Stephanie.",
        "Ridge: Well, let him try. We have the best designers and the biggest buyers.",
        "Eric: That's right. And the best team.",
        "Stephanie: Absolutely. It's your talent and your talent that sets us apart. And Rick's back, right? He's onboard.",
        "Ridge: Well, he's back in town. I'm not so sure how onboard he is.",
        "Eric: Oh, he will be. Everybody will be. The buyers, the distributors, the press -- when they see what we have to offer, if we ever finish it, which reminds me --",
        "Felicia: Let's get back to work.",
        "Eric: Let's do it.",
        "Pam: Not before everybody eats a little something, please.",
        "Eric: There's an idea. Thanks, Pam. Everybody grab a sandwich, and I'll show you what we've been doing. Come on.",
        "Bridget: Okay.",
        "Eric: Wait, let me get this.",
        "Bridget: Let me move it for her.",
        "Stephanie: What's with Rick?",
        "Ridge: He's just being Rick. He's always been hotheaded and stubborn. He resents my engagement to Brooke and he's angry about losing his job at Forrester Creations.",
        "Stephanie: But he'll work with us here. He'll do the European market for us.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I think we'll both be better off when he gets back overseas. I mean it, too. We'll get this European operation up and running, Rick's out of here. I, for one can't wait.",
        "Brooke: I'm so glad you're here, Rick. Please don't let your shortcomings with Stephanie and Ridge spoil your homecoming.",
        "Rick: Or your big party tonight?",
        "Brooke: I know you're just trying to be protective. But you know what? I am fine. I am fine. I am, I'm happy, everything's great. Now, that's what this party is all about. Ridge and I want to share our joy with the rest of the family. And I have this picture in my head. That Ridge and I are dancing to our favorite song, and everybody we love is surrounding us. What do you think?",
        "Rick: I'm sure the quartet knows \"Unforgettable.\"",
        "Brooke: Maybe your father can show you the piano.",
        "Rick: You know, he'd love that. See, I thought you were just going to ask me to sing right there.",
        "Brooke: Please.",
        "Rick: What? Absolutely not. No, no -- see, I'm going to show up tonight, I'm going to put a big smile on my face, and that's the only performance you're going to be getting out of me, all right?",
        "Brooke: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Hey, please know that this is the last thing that I wanted.",
        "Taylor: Thorne, she's your little girl. You have to do what's best for her.",
        "Thorne: Yeah. Aly's been through so much, and she's still so fragile --",
        "Taylor: And you're giving everything she needs. You're her wonderful father.",
        "Thorne: I wanted to give her a family.",
        "Taylor: You are her family.",
        "Thorne: I wanted you to be part of it.",
        "Taylor: Well, it just doesn't seem to be the right time. Maybe if I'd handled things differently, and if I had the courage to be honest with her from the beginning.",
        "Thorne: Okay, neither one of us knew that she was going to find out that way.",
        "Taylor: I just can't believe she had to find out from her friend that I was the one that killed her mother.",
        "Thorne: Taylor, I'm her father. It was my responsibility to talk to her.",
        "Taylor: Well, we can't change what happened. As much as we'd like to.",
        "Thorne: I'm sorry.",
        "Taylor: No, don't even go there. If you weren't willing to put your daughter first, you wouldn't be the man I fell in love with.",
        "Thorne: I really thought we could make this work. I just --",
        "Taylor: Just wasn't meant to be. Sheriff, the McSweeney's are tearing up the town!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: It looks pretty good. How does it feel?",
        "Phoebe: Better. Sorry.",
        "Ridge: What did I tell you about text-messaging at all hours of the night?",
        "Phoebe: I was up until 2:00 a.m. talking to Rick. Look, I heard what you said to Grandma about him. You want him to leave?",
        "Ridge: He's obviously not happy here, sweetie.",
        "Phoebe: He misses his life in Paris. I mean, he had friends and a job he liked.",
        "Ridge: Okay, I sympathize. He's taking his frustrations out on me and your grandmother. He blames us for losing the company, he resents my relationship with Brooke. I just don't like his attitude. I don't want you hanging around him.",
        "Phoebe: Because he's frustrated?",
        "Ridge: You don't need that kind of negativity in your life. None of us do.",
        "Phoebe: Look, Rick is a really nice guy. I mean, he's confused about you and Brooke, but I'll straighten him out.",
        "Ridge: It's not your responsibility to defend my relationship to anybody, okay? You started a very exciting new job here. You should just be focused on having fun with it.",
        "Phoebe: I enjoyed talking to Rick, okay? Nothing bad is going to happen just because we're friends. It might even make things better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: I think it would be good for Aly and I to get out of here for awhile. When Kristen called, she wants us to come visit her family, so --",
        "Taylor: It might be good for Aly to visit her cousins.",
        "Thorne: Yeah. And I could check on some vendors and look at some textile operations.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, and Steffy's been bothering me. She wants me to come see her in England, so --",
        "Thorne: You know, we don't have to leave tonight. I can still take you to Ridge and Brooke's engagement party.",
        "Taylor: No. No, that would be too painful on so many levels. Being around your family. I don't really feel like a part of the family, anyway.",
        "Thorne: Oh, Taylor. You are. And you will always will be a part of this family. What you've done for me, to help me get over Darla's death, and what you've done for Mother, it's -- you will always have a very special place in our lives. Especially in mine.",
        "Taylor: You know, I feel the same way about you and Aly. Whatever I've done for you is nothing, nothing in comparison to what you've done for me. I've never known the level of love and forgiveness and compassion you've shown me. And even when you didn't have to. Somehow it all -- it all changed me. You changed me. You helped me get my life together. You helped me learn how to face reality, even when it was really painful. And you taught me that love is more powerful than hate. And that forgiveness overcomes anger. Thank you.",
        "Thorne: I think we taught each other that, you know. I'm going to go pick Aly up. You can stay here for awhile if you want, okay?",
        "Taylor: Okay. I'm okay. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Very impressive. Hi. Put that spotlight out. You're in my eyes. Who's there? Who's doing that?",
        "Nick: How is it in the spotlight? Do you feel a bit exposed?",
        "Stephanie: Nick.",
        "Nick: Do you think this is how you made my mother feel at our fashion show?",
        "Stephanie: Put the light out, Nick. You're not amusing.",
        "Nick: I'm not here to amuse you.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I don't even know why you're here. You're not welcome.",
        "Nick: I'm your spotlight now. And I'll be watching every move you make. And when you least expect it, I'm going to get you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: There you are. Just in time.",
        "Ridge: In time for what?",
        "Brooke: I was going to go upstairs and take a long bath before the party tonight. Do you want to join me?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, maybe later.",
        "Brooke: Is everything okay?",
        "Ridge: Did you know that Phoebe and Rick were up half the night talking?",
        "Brooke: Yes. They were outside.",
        "Ridge: You saw them?",
        "Brooke: When I got up to take care of R.J. in the middle of the night.",
        "Ridge: Did you hear what they were talking about?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Ridge: Yes, he was bashing our relationship.",
        "Brooke: I've asked Rick to be very accepting.",
        "Ridge: Logan, we're starting a life together. Rebuilding our family. I want Rick to be a part of that. If he can't, I just want him to stay away. I want him to stay away from my daughter, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: All you're going to get is egg on your face, because you don't know bookiss about the fashion business.",
        "Nick: Well, I took yours from you.",
        "Stephanie: An empty shell. We kept the talent. You can't compete with us on the runway.",
        "Nick: The playing field's a lot bigger than just a runway, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: No, it isn't, actually, Nick. It all happens right here on the stage and in that spotlight.",
        "Nick: And I'm your spotlight.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Nick: Excuse me. Marone.",
        "Jackie: I talked to Yvette St. Julienne. She agreed to a meeting next week.",
        "Nick: Send her a jet for her, book her suite and make her as comfortable as possible.",
        "Jackie: Nicky, you don't want to seem too eager.",
        "Nick: I'm not. I'm just determined to get what I want. Where are you going? I was just starting to enjoy our talk.",
        "Stephanie: Make sure Mommy's there to wipe the egg off your face.",
        "Nick: I think you're the one who's going to have the egg on your face, honey."
