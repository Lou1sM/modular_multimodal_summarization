        "Phoebe gushes to Taylor about Rick, and Ridge overhears and becomes defensive. Taylor sadly tells Ridge that she and his brother have called it quits. He offers for Phoebe to stay on with her, in fact he would prefer it since Rick is staying at Brooke's too. Brooke asks Rick to sing at her party but he flatly declines. Eric is complimentary on Stephanie's handling of the party, and of Pam's new dress that he designed and she wears so beautifully. Nick is pleased that Evette San Julian will be flying in tomorrow and announces to his mother that she is ripe for the taking and the Forrester's will never know what hit them. Mainly though he can't take his eyes or mind off the paper announcing Brooke's engagement. Before they leave, Rick has to help Phoebe with a stuck zipper. At the party, Ridge warns Rick to stay away from his daughter. They have words about their father with Rick reminding him that Massimo is his father, Eric is his.",
        "Nick is sympathetic when Taylor tells him it is over with Thorne and she asks if he is in the mood for wings? He retorts that heartburn is a better choice than heartache. Stephanie urges Eric to ask Pam to dance since she is all alone. Rick is coerced into singing 'Unforgettable', but he will only do it if Phoebe joins in. They amaze everyone, except Ridge who is seething. Everyone toasts the guests of honor. Phoebe and Rick go off to themselves until Bridget calls for Phoebe to come back inside. Ridge slips up and gruffly warns him again to leave Phoebe alone. And if he ever crosses the line, he will kill him."

        "Phoebe: Anyway, I was just trying to remember the last time I spent any time with Rick, you know? We were young. It must have been Christmas or something.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, probably.",
        "Phoebe: Just -- he seemed so much older then, you know? I mean, I guess when you're a kid, a few years make a big difference, but it's not like that anymore. I mean, we've both grown up. I think, he thinks that by living in Europe, it's made him all mature, but I've been through a lot this year, too. Do you think Steffy will be stuck-up when she gets back from England? I mean, I'm not saying that Rick is stuck-up at all, it's just -- he's just funny.",
        "Ridge: Hey, kiddo. Shouldn't you be getting dressed for the party?",
        "Phoebe: Hey, I left my dress at Mom's and she brought it over for me.",
        "Ridge: Oh, good. Better go put it on.",
        "Phoebe: Okay. Bye. Thank you.",
        "Taylor: No problem, sweetie.",
        "Phoebe: Love you.",
        "Taylor: I love you, too.",
        "Ridge: If you brought your dress, too, you could have gotten a ride over with us to Mom and Dad's.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah.",
        "Taylor: I don't think I'll be going to the party. Thorne and I aren't seeing each other anymore.",
        "Phoebe: No, Mom.",
        "Ridge: I'm so sorry.",
        "Taylor: I guess we were fools to think that Aly would ever accept me.",
        "Phoebe: That's not true, Mom. Thorne loves you.",
        "Taylor: I love him, too, but this is what he wanted. I'm just -- I'm going to miss Aly so much.",
        "Phoebe: Look, I'll stay with you tonight, okay?",
        "Taylor: No, no, please. Go be with your father. It's his celebration, go.",
        "Phoebe: Okay. I love you.",
        "Taylor: I love you, too.",
        "Ridge: If you want, Phoebe could stay with you for a while.",
        "Taylor: No, I'm fine, really.",
        "Ridge: Actually, I'd prefer if she spent more time at your place the next while.",
        "Taylor: Why? Is there a reason you don't want her here?",
        "Ridge: Rick's staying with us.",
        "Taylor: Right. I know you two have issues, but is it really that bad?",
        "Ridge: Well, if it was up to him, Brooke and I wouldn't be getting married, and we wouldn't be together at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Rick, what are you doing? You better get dressed. We're going to be late.",
        "Rick: Well, maybe you can just go without me. I'm kidding. Just give me five minutes, okay?",
        "Brooke: It means a lot to me that you're going to be at the party.",
        "Rick: I know it does.",
        "Brooke: And it would mean even more if you'd reconsider singing our song.",
        "Rick: What? Are you kidding? Absolutely not. You know what? You better get dressed or we're all going to be late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: This looks nice.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, thank you. It looks lovely. What I was trying to say is, I'm just so -- I guess disappointed with the way things worked out for Thorne and Taylor.",
        "Eric: Yeah, so am I. Have you spoken to Taylor?",
        "Stephanie: No, I called, I left a message. Oh, maybe I should try her now.",
        "Eric: Good idea. Wait, wait, look. Look at Pam. Wow! You look sensational.",
        "Pam: Thank you. It's a beautiful dress, Eric, but it's a little much on me, don't you think?",
        "Eric: No, it's not. It's exactly the way I imagined it, here.",
        "Stephanie: Pam, you look -- you just -- you look lovely, sweetheart.",
        "Pam: Thank you.",
        "Stephanie: Why do I get the feeling that I -- oh, it was the sketch in the office.",
        "Eric: Yeah, it's from the original -- the first group of Forrester Originals. It's beautiful.",
        "Pam: Then I really shouldn't be wearing this, Eric. What if I spill something on it?",
        "Stephanie: So --",
        "Eric: You won't. You won't. Besides, you have to wear the dress that you helped me create.",
        "Pam: I didn't.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yes, you did. He told me everything. He was able to focus and work as hard as he did because you took such good care of him while I was gone. Thank you, Pam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: So, Yvette St. Julienne is flying in tomorrow.",
        "Nick: And that, mother, is very good news.",
        "Jackie: She may not accept our offer.",
        "Nick: I've done some research on her company. She'll accept.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You look beautiful.",
        "Brooke: Thank you. You look serious.",
        "Ridge: Oh, it's Taylor and my brother. They called it quits.",
        "Brooke: Why?",
        "Ridge: Apparently, because Aly can't accept Taylor as her stepmom.",
        "Brooke: That's sad.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Of course, they had to do what's best for Aly.",
        "Ridge: Doesn't it sound all too familiar?",
        "Brooke: What does that mean?",
        "Ridge: Rick and this attitude he's got going these days. He doesn't want me anywhere near you. If he tries to pull anything tonight --",
        "Brooke: He won't.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, if he does, I'm going after him. Somebody's got to set that kid straight. I have a feeling it's going to have to be me.",
        "Ridge: I don't want anything to put a damper on things.",
        "Brooke: Rick knows how important this evening is to me.",
        "Ridge: You think he's going to come around?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I think with Phoebe's help, maybe sooner than we think.",
        "Ridge: Phoebe shouldn't have to defend our relationship.",
        "Brooke: Well, she's been around to see how happy we are, and Rick hasn't.",
        "Ridge: Phoebe's just not objective, though. She's only 18. She's too susceptible.",
        "Brooke: Susceptible to what?",
        "Ridge: To Rick's attitude. You should've seen what she was saying about him to Taylor. She's going, \"Oh, he's so sweet. He's so smart. And funny.\"",
        "Brooke: Really? I think she has a little crush on him. That's cute.",
        "Ridge: No, it is not cute. I don't like it. And I want it to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Okay. Let's get back to work, shall we? You said that you had done some research.",
        "Nick: Her company's undervalued. We can buy it before the quarterly earnings come out, we'll save millions. By the time the Forresters figure it out, it'll be too late. Their fashion show will be a disaster.",
        "Taylor: Nick?",
        "Nick: Hi.",
        "Taylor: You don't have an assistant at your desk.",
        "Nick: She took a break.",
        "Taylor: Oh -- hi, Jackie.",
        "Jackie: Hello, Taylor. Nick, could I just speak with you for a moment alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Dad? Brooke?",
        "Rick: Phoebe? Phoebe, what's up? What's wrong?",
        "Phoebe: My zipper's stuck.",
        "Rick: Oh, come on in. I have a way with zippers. I'll fix it for you. Oh, you know what? You just got a little fabric stuck in there.",
        "Phoebe: They should put it on the side, so you can see it better.",
        "Rick: I don't know, why don't you ask your dad?",
        "Phoebe: I will.",
        "Rick: And while you're at it, why don't you ask him when he plans on breaking my mom's heart again? You know, I just want to know how long I need to keep this fake, supportive smile on my face.",
        "Phoebe: Well, you're going to be the life of the party, aren't you?",
        "Rick: It could be worse. My mom asked me to sing their song.",
        "Phoebe: Well, that would be interesting.",
        "Rick: I'm not going to do it.",
        "Phoebe: Why not? Chicken?",
        "Rick: No, I just -- I might flub the lines. You know, I might start singing -- unforgivable that's what you've done [Phoebe laughs] Come on, we're going to be late. We've got to go.",
        "Phoebe: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: So after the champagne comes out, I think we should bring the caviar out later. Later, after everyone's arrived.",
        "Pam: Guess what? Mom's famous five-layer dip.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my God!",
        "Pam: It was a big hit at Thorne and Taylor's wedding.",
        "Stephanie: And we all know what happened there. I still have to talk to the caterers, so I'm going to ask you to do me a big favor.",
        "Pam: Yes?",
        "Stephanie: Will you go and help Eric greet everyone when they arrive? Please?",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Stephanie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Oh, it's so funny! I can't believe that Stephanie is throwing an engagement party for my mother and Ridge.",
        "Pam: Hello, Bridget.",
        "Bridget: Oh, wow! Hi, Aunt Pam. Thank you so much for bringing the soup by the hospital.",
        "Pam: Oh, my pleasure.",
        "Bridget: You made me everybody's favorite doctor. Hello!",
        "Eric: Oh, the guests of honor have arrived.",
        "Phoebe: Aunt Pam, you look amazing.",
        "Pam: Oh, well, thank you, Phoebe. So do you.",
        "Ridge: Is that one of Dad's designs?",
        "Pam: It is, and I'm honored to be wearing it.",
        "Eric: Well, I'm honored that you are.",
        "Felicia: Hey, everybody.",
        "Eric: Hello.",
        "Felicia: Oh, so you're going to be my sister-in-law again. Congratulations.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Felicia: Nice to see one couple in this family could make it.",
        "Eric: So, you heard about Thorne?",
        "Felicia: Yeah, poor guy. I feel really bad for him.",
        "Stephanie: Hello, everybody! And Rick, did your mother talk you into coming?",
        "Rick: You know me, Stephanie. There is nothing I wouldn't do for my mother.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, well, that makes her a very lucky mother, and a lucky woman this evening.",
        "Brooke: Well, I certainly feel like one tonight.",
        "Stephanie: Come on, let's get started.",
        "Eric: Come inside, come on.",
        "Ridge: Stay away from my daughter.",
        "Rick: Excuse me, what are you talking about?",
        "Ridge: I don't want you putting ideas in her head.",
        "Rick: What, ideas like, you and Stephanie are the reason my father lost his company?",
        "Ridge: Our father is very happy that Forrester Originals is doing some of the best work he's done in years.",
        "Rick: Wait, hang on, your father? Number one, he's not your father. He's my father. Massimo is your father. And secondly, I really have a problem --",
        "Brooke: There you are! Come on, your mother's about to say something.",
        "Stephanie: Well, here we are. Ready to celebrate Ridge and Brooke -- again! [Everyone laughs] But let's keep in mind Thorne and Taylor, and realize something -- not every couple is as fortunate as you two are.",
        "Bridget: That's very true.",
        "Eric: That's the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: So, what seems to be the problem?",
        "Taylor: Well, I'll tell you if you promise not to say I told you so.",
        "Nick: It's something with Thorne, then.",
        "Taylor: We're not getting married anymore. I mean, I don't even know why I'm here. I'm not looking for sympathy, I'm just -- I don't know, I thought I could either stay at home, staring at the walls, fighting the urge to drink, or I could come over here and see if you might be in the mood for wings.",
        "Nick: Always.",
        "Taylor: Extra hot?",
        "Nick: I guess heartburn's a better choice than heartbreak. I'll give a call over there, they'll have them waiting.",
        "Taylor: Sounds good.",
        "Nick: Shall we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Is that for me?",
        "Eric: No, actually, it's for Pam. Look at her, she's over there by herself.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, why don't you ask her to dance and I'll take the champagne?",
        "Eric: That's a good idea. Of course you will.",
        "[Brooke whispering]",
        "Brooke: Excuse me, everybody. I have a request. As you know, our song is \"Unforgettable.\"",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Brooke: And I've asked the band to play it. But there's something that would make it even more special. Rick, would you sing it? Please, please?",
        "Bridget: I'm pretty sure that you just told Stephanie that you would do anything for Mom. Did I hear that?",
        "Brooke: He did say that.",
        "Bridget: I'm pretty sure that -- yeah.",
        "Rick: Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, sure.",
        "Bridget: Yay!",
        "Rick: But I am going to ask Phoebe if she would join me for the song.",
        "Phoebe: What? No, no.",
        "Bridget: Oh, Phoebe!",
        "Rick: What? Are you afraid you're going to forget the words or -- I mean, we've all heard this song enough times, right? And we could all sing along if we wanted to, right? All right. Unforgettable that's what you are Unforgettable though near or far Like a song of love that clings to me How the thought of you does things to me Never before has someone been more Unforgettable in every way And forever more And forever more That's how we'll stay That's how we'll stay That's why darling It's incredible that someone so unforgettable Thinks that I am unforgettable too",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Bridget: How impressive was that? That was incredible.",
        "Felicia: Where did little Ricky get those pipes, anyway?",
        "Brooke: He said he was taking singing lessons in Paris.",
        "Stephanie: Oh!",
        "Bridget: What I liked it best, the looks between them? Did you see Phoebe's face? She was practically melting at the sight of him.",
        "Felicia: Well, what little girl wouldn't?",
        "Brooke: She could have a little crush on him.",
        "Ridge: No, she doesn't.",
        "Stephanie: Oh?",
        "Brooke: Oh, Daddy's just a little overprotective. It's okay.",
        "Felicia: Wonder where he got that?",
        "[Eric laughs]",
        "Eric: A toast, to Ridge and Brooke. May your lives together be as wonderful and as romantic as a love song.",
        "Felicia: Hear, hear.",
        "Brooke: Oh, that's sweet. Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Phoebe: You were amazing.",
        "Rick: You were, too.",
        "Phoebe: No, no -- I mean, but I had no idea -- like, you're -- wow.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, I couldn't have done it without you.",
        "Phoebe: You really didn't have much of a choice.",
        "Rick: That's true. But it was fun, though.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, it was.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, we sounded so good together.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, I mean, it felt like we were in sync.",
        "Rick: That's what I love about music. You know? It comes from a place inside, a primal and sensual place. And music is one of the oldest forms of expression, and I think that that's why it affects people so much. It really -- it cuts through the garbage that society throws at us, day after day -- and it really gets to the core of who we are.",
        "Bridget: Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe. Good, there you are. Your dad's looking for you.",
        "Rick: You better go.",
        "Ridge: I told you to leave her alone. Look, if you want defy me, you get in my face. Don't use Phoebe to do it. I'm going to tell you something right now. If you ever, and I mean ever, cross the line with my daughter, I'll kill you."
