    "Recap": [
        "Liam tells Steffy that she won't even recognize FC anymore. He wants to take it back to it's roots, to a place she can be proud of. Liam says they can wait the year but there will be no company to come back to. They can pool their resources now and erase what Rick has done and get it back to its original place with her family. Brooke asks Rick to tell Caroline that he wants her back. Maya speaks out and tells her that Eric tried this and it did not work with him and it will not work with her either. Rick tells his mother that he appreciates her concern but he has moved on. It is not with Caroline. Bill walks in on Katie and Will and says he is home .maybe if he says that enough it will come true. He tells her Brooke is home so she should go see her like he did. She asks how that went. He says good, they said what needed to be said. He told her there was only one woman he wanted to spend his life with and he hopes that she does too. He says moving forward could make their bond even stronger. He needed time away from Brooke and now he knows what he wants \u0096 Katie and his family. Ivy helps Aly with some of her details for her shoe line but warns her that the way Rick feels about her now that might not be a good thing. She might want to stay away from Ivy. Maya says she is only a model and not a Spencer or from a family of privilege but there is nothing wrong with her. Brooke says no, nothing wrong but Rick moved on way too soon and now is brandishing guns. Rick says that Caroline is just another liar like Amber. He says the divorce papers have been signed and he has moved on and Caroline is with Ridge so she has moved on too. As sickening as it is, perhaps it is for the best. Steffy doesn't like the idea with Spencer. Liam tells her she can keep her job at International or come back and help him run the company. He needs her to make this work. She needs to join forces with him. She says she will never sell her shares, neither will Thomas but she will try to figure something out. Liam tells her to go talk to her dad, because if they work together there is nothing they can't do. Katie tells Bill that she believes he means it, today and this moment. He says always and he hopes she wants it too. Steffy looks at pix of Liam at his place and jokes that he gets around with the brunette Forrester's .Amsterdam and Paris. She just hopes it won't be Aspen too as that was their place. He says so many places reminds him of her. Things did not turn out for them as planned. She says her feelings for him will never change. They hug as Ivy walks through the door. She asks if she is interrupting anything. Maya thanks Rick for what he said and says it reaffirms that he really wants her in his life. He assures her that is so.",
        "Brooke tells Caroline that she tried but looks like Rick is not gonna come around. Maybe Rick is right, everybody is better off. She realizes the attraction for Caroline to Ridge, but just remember many other women have had the same feelings and it never pans out. Brooke tells her to be realistic. She is not going to have a relationship with Ridge. She can see how she could get swept up with this and Ridge. She is not the first or the last. Brooke says she has seen it countless times that other women have this cosmic connection and think they can replace Brooke. She snaps her fingers and says if she wanted Ridge she could have him back just like that. Bill tells Katie to tell him that she wants this as much as he does. Katie says yes she misses their life together, who they were together but she does not know how they go back to that. He says they don't. They will be more prepared this time and fully understand each other. He says she is his perfect partner as she encourages him when he needs it but pushes him when he needs that too. And yes he has Liam and Wyatt but he did not raise them. Now she has gifted him with Will and he does not want to be a part time dad. She says she hates that too. He grabs her and kisses her. Then says he wants her because she is Will's mother but that is only a small part of it. He loves her because she is the smartest person in the room, is sexy and she excites him and is the most stubborn person that he knows besides himself. And most importantly she inspires him to be the man she wants him to be. He tells her they should not waste another moment. He pulls out a box and shows her a huge ring and asks her to marry him."

        "Steffy: You want to take control of Forrester Creations?",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Steffy: Liam, that's my family's business.",
        "Liam: I know. I know it is, and I want to bring it back to what it once was. I want to return Forrester to its roots -- that sense of pride and community that your grandparents instilled in everyone who worked there, because, Steffy, I'm telling you, Rick has erased all that. You wouldn't even recognize the company anymore. So -- so help me. If we pool our resources, we'll be on our way to taking control of Forrester Creations back from Rick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Tell Caroline you forgive her. Tell her you want her back.",
        "Maya: You can't be serious. Brooke, Eric tried this already. It didn't work with him, and it's not gonna work with you.",
        "Brooke: His father and I understand what's going on here, Maya, whether you choose to or not.",
        "Rick: Mom, stop. I appreciate your concern. I do. I've moved on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Dunk it, just like Daddy showed you. Yep. There you go. All right. One more time? Oh!",
        "Bill: Honey, I'm home!",
        "Katie: Hi! That's, uh -- that's cute. That's very good.",
        "Bill: Well, I just kind of figure if I say it enough times, it just might come true.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] I thought I had tomorrow to get you the marketing report.",
        "Bill: You do. I'm here -- oh, I blocked it!",
        "Katie: Oh, a block!",
        "Bill: I'm here for this guy. I'm here for this guy. [Smooches] Brooke's back.",
        "Katie: Uh, yeah. I know. I-I should go see her.",
        "Bill: You should. Go get it. I did.",
        "Will: Oh, no. I got it!",
        "Katie: All right. So, you saw Brooke?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Katie: How'd that go?",
        "Bill: Fine. I, um, said what needed to be said.",
        "Katie: Which was what?",
        "Bill: How I feel -- that there's only one woman I want to spend my life with, and that I'm hoping you'll want to spend it with me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: There we go.",
        "Zach: All right. Thank you. I'll get this to Julie right away.",
        "Ivy: Cool. Thanks, Zach.",
        "Aly: So, he's really cute.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Well, these are amazing, but I think you should just think about changing a couple of the buckles.",
        "Aly: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I'll make that change. Thank you.",
        "Ivy: Well, you I mean, you don't have to. I'm just throwing ideas out there.",
        "Aly: No, no, no. I appreciate it. I need all the help I can get if I have any chance of getting my shoe line off the ground. And, plus, I trust your instincts.",
        "Ivy: Well, maybe you shouldn't. Judging by how Rick obviously feels about me nowadays, you might be better off staying away from me entirely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You're in pain, honey. Your instinct is to hurt Caroline.",
        "Rick: It's not about sticking it to Caroline. It's not about some sort of revenge. It's so much more than that. What I have with Maya -- I've never felt that kind of support, that appreciation, that loyalty.",
        "Brooke: Rick, deep down, you know that your relationship with Maya is just temporary.",
        "Maya: Why? Because I'm not a Spencer? Because I didn't come from privilege, and I'm just a model? Is there something wrong with me, Brooke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Look, I'm frustrated by the rumors I'm hearing about Rick, but I don't understand what we can do about it.",
        "Liam: Well, my father is willing to give me control of his shares, right? You combine that with yours and Thomas', and we can start working on ousting Rick and getting control of the entire company.",
        "Steffy: My granddad gave him irrevocable control. We can't make a move for at least a full year.",
        "Liam: Come on. If you and I work together, we can do anything. The fact is, Steffy, Rick is out of control. I mean, he's treating everyone like garbage. If we do nothing, if we just sit back and let him carry on down this path, there won't be a company left a year from now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Hey. Will asleep?",
        "Katie: Yeah. He insisted that I give this to you. He was very clear.",
        "Bill: That's because that's my boy looking out for his daddy.",
        "Katie: I think he likes having you around.",
        "Bill: I am a good time.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: How 'bout his mama? Does she like having me around?",
        "Katie: Yes... but a lot has happened.",
        "Bill: A lot has happened. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Moving forward, that could make our bond even stronger.",
        "Katie: Maybe it could.",
        "Bill: My future is with you, Katie. I was angry at Brooke when she left. I didn't understand why she did it. She knew what I didn't -- that I needed time away from her, so I could get some clarity about what I really wanted. And now I know what I want -- you... you and Will... our family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: There's nothing wrong with you, Maya. I just feel that Rick has moved on way too quickly, living with you too soon, hanging your picture above the fireplace. I'm concerned.",
        "Rick: There's nothing to be concerned about.",
        "Brooke: You brought a gun into the office.",
        "Rick: To give to my attorney.",
        "Brooke: You shot it. You could have killed somebody.",
        "Rick: I fired a couple shots -- nowhere near them, by the way. You might have done the same thing if you saw them making out on the couch. It repulses me. And don't say it's because I still care, because I don't. I've moved on. Caroline's no better than Amber. I thought she had grace. I thought she had class. But it doesn't matter when you're just another liar.",
        "Brooke: Rick, you're looking for perfection. You're not going to find it in anybody.",
        "Rick: No, but I can get a hell of a lot closer. The divorce papers are signed. I'm with Maya now. And Caroline -- well, it appears she's moved on with Ridge. As sickening as it is... maybe it's for the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: So, what are you proposing?",
        "Liam: Sell me your shares. Then convince Thomas to do the same.",
        "Steffy: Why is it so important to you?",
        "Liam: Because my cousin is suffering. So is Ivy.",
        "Steffy: So, you'd do it for them -- your cousin and your girlfriend?",
        "Liam: Not just them. It's for you, too. It's about protecting the Forrester brand, your family's legacy, before Rick destroys it.",
        "Steffy: You know, I just -- I don't like the idea of selling, especially to Spencer.",
        "Liam: Okay, listen -- Eric is retiring soon. You know that. And whether you like it or not, Spencer still has a stake in Forrester Creations. You'd bank a ton of money. You'd get to stay involved. You could keep your job at International. Best of all, maybe I could convince you to come back to L.A. and run the company with me. But I need you. I need you in order to make this work, Steffy -- you and Thomas.",
        "Steffy: No, Thomas won't sell.",
        "Liam: He looks up to you. Maybe you could sway him. Steffy, take a risk. Save your company. Join forces with me.",
        "Steffy: Look, I agree with you. Things need to change. But, Liam, I'm never gonna sell my shares. I'll -- I'll figure something out, starting with my dad. This whole Caroline thing -- I mean, it's ridiculous. She's, like, my age. And it's what started this whole chain of events.",
        "Liam: That's good. That's good. Go talk to Ridge. In fact, go to Forrester. See what Rick's been doing to the company. Just promise me something.",
        "Steffy: Hmm?",
        "Liam: You won't say no. You'll think about it. 'Cause if you and I work together, there's nothing we can't do, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I believe you mean it, Bill, today, in this moment, but what if --",
        "Bill: Today, tomorrow, forever. I want us to be a family again, Katie. Tell me you want that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Here you go -- refill.",
        "Steffy: Ah, thank you.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: So, you've been traveling around the world with my cousin, I see.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, I have. Paris, Amsterdam -- we get around.",
        "Steffy: What is it about you with brunette Forresters?",
        "Liam: Clearly, I have a type.",
        "Steffy: Just don't you dare take her to Aspen, because that's our place, okay?",
        "Liam: Are you kidding me? There are so many places I associate with you -- Aspen, this house, down by the beach. And even though we've moved on, and we life halfway across the planet from one another, it still... it makes me happy to know there's places I can go to think about you, moments I can look back on, happy memories of what we once were.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Thank you. I knew how you felt about me, but hearing you say it in front of your mom and Caroline - it just really let me know that you want me and how much being with me means to you.",
        "Rick: And I'll keep saying it to anyone who needs to hear it. I'll say it again and again. You're the woman I want to spend my life with. Always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Well, I tried. [Sighs] Maybe Rick will come around, maybe he won't.",
        "Caroline: I appreciate that, Brooke, but at this point, I mean, maybe Rick's right. Maybe everybody's better off.",
        "Brooke: You don't expect to have a relationship with Ridge, do you? I mean, I understand the attraction more than anybody. Ridge is an incredibly sexy, talented man, and I'm sure the chemistry between the two of you is very intense.",
        "Caroline: It is.",
        "Brooke: Well, don't forget, there have been many women who have had that same connection with him before you.",
        "Caroline: Well, yeah. Sure. But it is more than just chemistry.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] My dear Caroline, Ridge flirts. He's very precarious. Many women want to be with him. But if you think this is going to be something more --",
        "Caroline: It is.",
        "Brooke: Be realistic. You are not going to have a relationship with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Things could have been so different.",
        "Liam: Yeah. It didn't really turn out the way we planned, did it? But it doesn't do either of us any good to live with regret, either.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, agreed. But, Liam, I will always... my feelings for you will never change.",
        "Ivy: Uh [Chuckles] Am I interrupting something? Steffy. What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I don't want you to get hurt.",
        "Caroline: You haven't been here, Brooke. I have been hurt, terribly, by your son.",
        "Brooke: By your own actions. You betrayed Rick.",
        "Caroline: I kissed another man, and that was not the best choice, but Rick is the one who did the betraying.",
        "Brooke: Look, I didn't mean to touch a nerve. But Rick does hold you accountable for your actions, and I get it. A lot has happened. You both hurt each other.",
        "Caroline: I'll give you that.",
        "Brooke: I can see how you'd get swept up in the idea of Ridge. But you're not the first woman, and you're not gonna be the last.",
        "Caroline: And, again, Brooke, you haven't been here, so you haven't seen what Ridge and I have been through together.",
        "Brooke: I don't need to see that. I've seen it countless times -- how women think they have this cosmic connection with Ridge, and then they think they can just...",
        "Caroline: That they can just what?",
        "Brooke: They can replace me.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God. Are -- are you serious?",
        "Brooke: If you think you have a future with Ridge...",
        "Caroline: Who says I don't?",
        "Brooke: Oh, boy.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Brooke: Caroline, if I wanted to have Ridge back, I could have him...just...like...that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Tell me you want this as much as I do.",
        "Katie: I miss our life together. I do. I miss our marriage. I miss who we were together. But I don't know how to go back to that.",
        "Bill: We don't. We move forward, smarter, more prepared. Listen, I think we needed that time apart, so we could fully appreciate and understand each other.",
        "Katie: Maybe you're right. I-I have new perspective on how unique we were and how we understood each other and how we encouraged the best parts of each other.",
        "Bill: And leaned on each other and pushed when necessary. You were my perfect partner. You encouraged me when I needed it. You got on me when I needed that. You challenged me. That's always who you've been, Katie. You've given me so much -- first and foremost, a son.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Yes, I have Liam and Wyatt, but I wasn't there to raise them. You gave me the gift of Will. And we've been -- you know, we've been doing okay splitting time. But I don't want that anymore. I don't want to be a part-time parent.",
        "Katie: I don't want that, either. I hate it, but if you just want me because I'm the mother of your --",
        "Bill: I want you... because you're Will's mother. Yes, that's true. But that's just a small part of a much bigger picture. I want you... because you're always the smartest woman in the room, because you're sexy as hell. I want you because I've never met anybody more stubborn than I am. And I want you because you excite me. And, most importantly, I want you because when you look at me that certain way you do, you inspire me to be the man that you believe I am. So, let's not lose another moment. Let's put our family back together. You know, Will is young enough that he won't even remember a time when we were apart.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: I love you, my Katie. Say you'll marry me."
