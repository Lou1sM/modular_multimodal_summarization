        "Taylor: You saved me from a marriage that wasn't working. Thank you, Hector.",
        "[Taylor sobbing]",
        "Thomas: Dad, you've got to do something.",
        "Ridge: Thomas?",
        "Thomas: I didn't want to leave her alone, but she said my worrying about her just made her feel worse. But I don't see how that's possible, because she's, like, totally miserable and -- mom is falling apart. You have to get over there. Don't you care what happens to her?",
        "Ridge: Of course I care what happens to her. Now just calm down and tell me what happened.",
        "Thomas: Oh, you already know. You're the reason she's sitting alone in that house with all those memories. You have to fix this.",
        "Ridge: I wish I could, son. But",
        "Thomas: But what? What, you're so damn in love with Brooke, no one else matters? Not even Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Bridget screams]",
        "Bridget: Oh, my god! Oh, my --",
        "[Bridget gasping]",
        "Nick: Are you okay?",
        "Bridget: Yeah, yeah. Nicole's not going to be. You need to up the dosage, now.",
        "Barbara: I can't do that --",
        "Bridget: Now! Please, it's our baby. It's our baby. We can't lose her.",
        "Nick: Shh! Don't talk like that, Bridget. Don't talk like that. I know you're scared.",
        "Bridget: Nick --",
        "Nick: But you hang in there. We've got to give this medicine time to work.",
        "Barbara: Your husband's right. You haven't been on the I.V. That long.",
        "Bridget: If I have another contraction within the hour, the medication will not be able to stop the labor. Nick, even if we have her, she could still have serious complications. Why is this happening to our daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Thomas, you have to understand something -- I understand everything. You have this \"connection\" to Brooke and your little son.",
        "Ridge: Which in no way lessens my love for you, Steffy and Phoebe.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I said I get it, Dad. But I don't have to be happy about it.",
        "Ridge: But you wish things would go back the way they were?",
        "Thomas: Well, hell yes! Look, I didn't come here to guilt trip you, but seeing mom like this -- she's always so together, and -- look, I realize I'm putting you in a weird position, but I didn't know what else to do. Mom needs our help. She needs you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Taylor: Hello?",
        "Hector: Taylor?",
        "Taylor: Hector, why are you calling me again?",
        "Hector: I still don't feel good about leaving you in that house alone.",
        "Taylor: Well, I'm not alone. I'm sharing the evening with Mr. Chardonnay.",
        "Hector: Oh, chardonnay now? On top of champagne?",
        "Taylor: Hector, I don't think having a glass of wine when someone's going through what I'm going through is a sin, do you?",
        "Hector: No. No, I don't. But I still worry about you. I want to come over.",
        "[Taylor sighs]",
        "Taylor: Well, actually, I was thinking of going up to Cafe Russe to get a little bite to eat.",
        "Hector: Well, you shouldn't drive if you've been drinking. I'm gonna come pick you up, okay?",
        "Taylor: And you've been trying to for months!",
        "[Hector chuckles]",
        "Taylor: No. Seriously, I'm not good company. I'm really lousy company right now, okay? So let me call you a little bit later when I'm feeling a little bit better, all right? Okay. Good night, Hector.",
        "Hector: Taylor?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Give me this stuff.",
        "Bridget: What?",
        "Nick: Give me the book, the glasses. You need to take a break.",
        "Bridget: I will in just a minute.",
        "Nick: No arguments! The glasses. I know how you like to call the shots, but that's not what's happening tonight. Tonight -- tonight, the shots are being called by a higher power.",
        "Bridget: I've been praying, Nick.",
        "Nick: Well, we need that higher power. But I'm talking about this higher power right here. I think she's getting impatient, you know? I think she just wants to join us. Either that, or she has a big problem with escargot, and I can't blame her. If you had just ordered a bucket of wings from Chuck's, that would have been fine.",
        "Bridget: If anything's gonna start labor, it's gonna be that kind of spicy --",
        "Nick: The point is, she just wants to show us who's boss. She's determined to be born happy and healthy, and that's exactly what's gonna happen. But you've got to take it easy, and you've got to let the medicine do it's thing.",
        "Bridget: What if it doesn't, nick?",
        "Nick: No ifs.",
        "Bridget: You don't understand --",
        "Nick: No buts, no arguments. Now, this little princess is counting on us. We can't let her down. I won't let her down -- or her beautiful, smart, sexy mom.",
        "Bridget: Sexy, right.",
        "Nick: Do you know how sexy pregnant women are? Even after they give birth and they're cradling their little daughters right in their arms. And that's gonna happen -- in a few months, that's gonna happen. Nicole's gonna come, kicking and screaming, and we're gonna count our blessings, and we're gonna love her and watch her grow. And when she's old enough, we're gonna tell her about this. We're gonna tell her how she scared the hell out of us. And she's gonna look us in the eye and say, \"you know, dad, you guys worry too much.\" And she'd be right. That's a heck of a kid we've got there, huh, Mom?",

        "Nick: So how's your placenta?",
        "Bridget: Huh?",
        "Nick: I was just wondering how your placenta felt.",
        "Bridget: Oh, honey, I can't feel my placenta.",
        "Nick: Nurse, she can't feel her placenta.",
        "Bridget: Sweetheart -- sweetheart, I'm not supposed to be able to feel it.",
        "Nick: You sure?",
        "Bridget: Mm-hmm. You can look it up if you don't believe me.",
        "Nick: I'm just trying to get used to all of this medical jargon, you know? First, your cervix is incompetent, and then it's evasive, and then it's -- I don't know.",
        "Bridget: It's effaced. It's effaced, not evasive.",
        "Nick: Well, if you were on a tanker, you would know what I was talking about. But you know, now that I think about it --",
        "Bridget: What?",
        "Nick: Well, a lot of what's going on here is sort of like when a tanker springs a leak.",
        "Bridget: Right, I'm sure it is.",
        "Nick: Listen -- a sailor, unlike a lot of these doctors, we know exactly what to do in crisis.",
        "Bridget: I'm going to hate myself for saying this. What?",
        "Nick: Duct tape. Takes care of everything. Nurse, you got any duct tape in here?",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Bridget: Oh, he's just kidding, Barbara. Don't listen to him. My husband doesn't know what he's talking about. He's a little crazy.",
        "Nick: Well, you married me, so what does that say about you?",
        "Bridget: Well, I can trade you in.",
        "Nick: Okay. Before you do that, though -- I have a little confession I need to make to you. I hope it doesn't affect how you feel about me. I've been wanting to tell you something for a long time. And I hope it doesn't affect what kind of father that I'll be to our little girl. If you have migraines, you know pain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Taylor remembering]",
        "Ridge: Because I will always love you. But I can't do this. I can't be your husband anymore. I'm so sorry.",
        "[Taylor sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: A confession?",
        "Nick: It's actually more of a -- secret desire.",
        "Bridget: Okay.",
        "Nick: You know this million dollar tanker business I have? I'm actually just a silly sailor who's dying to do standup. Tada! What do you think?",
        "Bridget: I think I know what you're doing, and I love you for it.",
        "Nick: And what am I doing?",
        "Bridget: You're being all silly and goofy, trying to take my mind off of worrying. Honey, how long has it been since my last contraction?",
        "Nick: 22 minutes.",
        "Bridget: And I never had a fifth one.",
        "Nick: Nurse, did you hear that? She didn't have the fifth contraction in the hour. Did you hear that?",
        "Barbara: It's a good sign.",
        "Nick: That means the medicine's working, the drugs are kicking in, huh?",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm. Bridget's blood pressure is down, too. Looks like you're stabilizing. I'll go tell the doctor.",
        "Bridget: Oh, thank God.",
        "Nick: That was a close call. But you know, we're not out of the woods yet. You know that.",
        "Bridget: I know, I know. But thank God.",
        "Nick: She's going to come out when she's darn good and ready to come out. That's what I think. If you could just please hold off until it's time. Otherwise, your parents will have premature gray hair. Can you hear me? [Bridget sighs] Now listen to me -- you know we're in a battle now. But it's not just the two of us. She's in this with us. Me, you and Nicole. But we've got to hold on to each other, because that's what families do. They hold on together. 'Cause if we do that, there is nothing that we can't do. There is nothing that we can't get through, the three of us together.",
        "Bridget: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Taylor: What do you want, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Thomas was just here. He's worried about you, and so am I.",
        "Taylor: Don't be, I'm fine.",
        "Ridge: You don't sound fine.",
        "Taylor: Whatever Thomas said, I will talk to him, and I'll reassure him that I'm all right.",
        "Ridge: Except you're not all right. I'm concerned.",
        "Taylor: Well, don't be, okay? I mean, yeah, this is not the easiest of times for me, okay? We had a beautiful life together, and it's over. Our children aren't children anymore, so you're free. You're free to go have your life with Brooke. I'm not standing in your way.",
        "Ridge: Taylor --",
        "Taylor: No, Ridge, please. You know, I know you love me. I know you always will. But I'm just starting to think that maybe -- it would have been better if I had never come back into your life.",
        "Ridge: Oh, please don't say that. That's not true at all.",
        "Taylor: I have to go. Good-bye, ridge. Good-bye. Good-bye, my love.",
