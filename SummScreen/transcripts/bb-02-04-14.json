        "Katie and Ridge play with their kids in the park. RJ says if he went to school in L.A., they could skateboard all day and eat pizza, that would be fun. Katie and Ridge play a little one on one soccer. He teases her about playing the bench back in high school. While RJ is watching Will, Ridge and Katie sit on the blanket and read sonnets. Liam catches Quinn working in the CEO's office and makes mention that she sure is getting cozy there. Likewise she asks doesn't he have a job somewhere. He's only too happy to inform her that Wyatt and Hope are back from their aborted trip. Hope knows the truth now. He shows her the video footage. She reminds him this was a silly prank and Wyatt was wrong but she thinks Hope is a strong sensible young lady and they will work past this. Liam says he knows Wyatt is charming but he doesn't see how he can wiggle out of this.",
        "Rick asks Hope what will be her decision, to keep Quinn and Wyatt or let them go. Wyatt says he realizes he doesn't deserve a second chance but he is begging them not to hold it against all his employees for his stupid mistake. Hope thinks it over and says she is going to allow him and Quinn to stay. But nothing even close to this can happen again. They will be terminated immediately. Rick tells Wyatt that he is one lucky man. She tells Wyatt that as far as a personal relationship goes, that is now over between them. He asks her not to do this. She is allowing him to stay but they are no longer a couple. He says he knows that he can't take it back but he will never lie to her again. He's asking her to give him just one more chance. He kisses her and says he does not want to lose her. He will never do anything like this again. She finally says one more chance. He says he will not let her down. He brings her diamond necklace out of his pocket and puts it around her neck. They hold each other."

        "Rick: You know, in my opinion, you and your mother should be out the door and locked up. But this is up to you, Hope, because, uh... well, he's whatever he is to you. So, it's your call.",
        "Wyatt: You should be furious with me.",
        "Hope: I am.",
        "Wyatt: And I probably don't deserve a second chance. No, I know I don't. But I'm asking anyway, for our company's sake, for all our employees. If Quinn Artisan Jewelers loses their contract with Forrester --",
        "Rick: Really? Were you thinking about your employees when you tried to do this diamond heist? Apparently not.",
        "Wyatt: I wasn't thinking at all. Please. Our workers need their jobs. Don't punish them for something stupid that I did.",

        "Liam: Oh, Quinn getting comfy in the C.E.O. Office. You must feel quite at home here at Forrester.",
        "Quinn: Don't you have a job?",
        "Liam: Is that emeralds? Oh, that's interesting. Hey, I need you to make me a necklace for the woman in my life engraved \"H.L.\" -- No, \"H.S.\" Yeah. You can have that done by the end of the day, yeah?",
        "Quinn: Are you high?",
        "Liam: Oh, while you're at it, fire up that cauldron of yours. Make some wedding bands for Hope and me.",
        "Quinn: It's time for you to give up on that little dream, Liam. Hope and Wyatt went away together.",
        "Liam: Oh, have you not spoken to your son today? Something came up. Hope and Wyatt are back in town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Those are shoes.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. He likes you.",
        "R.J.: He's fun to play with.",
        "Ridge: Hey, do you want to teach him our secret handshake?",
        "Katie: Oh, you have a secret handshake?",
        "R.J.: Dad and me.",
        "Katie: Well, go -- go ahead. I won't look.",
        "R.J.: It's okay. You can learn it, too.",
        "Katie: I can?",
        "Ridge: She can? Come on, man.",
        "R.J.: But she's the only girl. Even mom doesn't know.",
        "Katie: Well, I won't tell a soul, I promise.",
        "Ridge: Okay, ready?",
        "Both: Boom!",
        "Katie: Wow! Wow. Very manly.",
        "R.J.: Here. Try it with me.",
        "Katie: Okay. Yes! Nice!",
        "Ridge: Now, what about this guy? Come on. Try it.",
        "Katie: Ohh. You want to try the secret handshake?",
        "Ridge: I got to tell you, it was a good idea getting out of the office and bringing these kids to the park.",
        "Katie: Well, Will and I come here an awful lot, so I'm glad you could join us.",
        "Ridge: What do you think?",
        "R.J.: Hey, if I can go to school in L.A., Dad and I can come, too.",
        "Katie: We would like that. It would be really good for Will.",
        "Ridge: Well, let's see what happens. Who knows? Maybe we'll take L.A. by storm. We'll go to the beach, surfing, skateboards. We'll eat pizza all day. Sounds good, huh?",
        "R.J.: Cool. Can Will come, too?",
        "Katie: What do you think? Pizza?",
        "Ridge: You could get him a tiny little skateboard, maybe a surfboard.",
        "Katie: We just started walking. I think that we can ease into the skateboarding.",
        "Ridge: We can make him fly. Oh, look at you!",
        "Katie: Whoa! Who's flying?!",
        "Ridge: You're a good flyer.",
        "Will: [Crying]",
        "Ridge: Oh, no. That's enough flying. First-class only.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Wyatt took Hope on a road trip.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I know -- the trailer, Emerald Bay. Really gorgeous this time of year. A lot closer than I thought. It actually only took me a couple hours to get there.",
        "Quinn: You crashed their trip?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, you see, I-I really had no choice because Hope was off and alone with a guy who was pretending to be something he wasn't.",
        "Quinn: I warned you to stop interfering.",
        "Liam: So, I kind of thought it was imperative that she know the truth.",
        "Quinn: Oh, give it a rest, Liam!",
        "Liam: You know, I did have my suspicions. I thought that there was something off about Wyatt. The only problem was I just didn't have the proof. Hope knows, Quinn. She's seen the footage now. I'm very, very sorry, but it's over for you -- and your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You've put us in a very difficult position, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: I know, and I can't even begin to describe how sorry I am.",
        "Hope: How are we supposed to trust you again?",
        "Wyatt: I will try my best to get that back -- from both of you.",
        "Rick: So, what do you want to do, Hope? Is he gonna stay, or you gonna cut him loose? You make the call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Chuckles softly]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] What do you want?",
        "Liam: Hmm? Oh, nothing. No, I just thought Hope deserved to know who Wyatt really is.",
        "Quinn: That footage does not define my son.",
        "Liam: Sure says a lot... about his character. You know, there's this word -- this word that Hope keeps using a lot lately, \"integrity.\" And Wyatt doesn't have any of that. And Hope was devastated, Quinn. Everything that she thought she knew about Wyatt -- the big, beloved hero, thwarting jewel thieves, saving the precious diamond, revered across the globe for his courage and bravery -- it's a lie. It's all a big, fat, stinking, self-serving lie perpetuated entirely...by your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You had plenty of opportunities to tell me the truth.",
        "Wyatt: You wouldn't have gone along with it.",
        "Rick: Yeah, because Hope would never do anything this disrespectful or reprehensible.",
        "Wyatt: You're right. What I did goes against everything that you stand for.",
        "Hope: It does, and I will never, ever condone what you did. But I know how many people are counting on this line succeeding -- not just your employees but our company, too. Your mom makes beautiful jewelry, and you are a gifted, albeit misguided, businessman. A lot of people need this collaboration to work, so -- God, I hope I don't regret this, but I am allowing you and Quinn to stay on at Forrester.",
        "Wyatt: You are?",
        "Hope: But... if anything like this happens again -- any legal fallout, anything remotely questionable or unethical -- you will be terminated immediately, and you and your mom will take the hit.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Yeah. Of -- of course.",
        "Rick: You sure about this?",
        "Hope: We're in the middle of a line. We don't want to disrupt things.",
        "Rick: All right. Then the decision's been made, hasn't it? This doesn't get out, or this would be a huge scandal for our company. Lucky man. And you are a lucky man. Don't screw it up.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Hope: As far as our relationship is concerned... we are no longer together.",

        "Liam: Wyatt played everyone -- most of all, Hope.",
        "Quinn: It wasn't his intention to hurt anyone. He thought it would be good for their line, and it was.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah -- good for business, bad for Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: I happen to think that Hope is a smart, reasonable young woman and she will see past this.",
        "Liam: I don't know, Quinn. You weren't there when she found out. You -- you didn't see the look of disillusionment on her face or hear the pain in her voice as she wondered aloud whether she ever even really knew Wyatt or whether he has any concept of who she is, because Hope is a decent, honest woman.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt made a mistake, Liam. Nobody got hurt.",
        "Liam: Charlie could have been killed. There's two guys rotting in a jail cell right now.",
        "Quinn: Which is exactly where they should be because they were gonna steal the diamond anyway.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Oh, well. Wyatt got to it first. Do you have any idea what this could have done to Hope or her line or Forrester creations?",
        "Quinn: I have to believe that Hope and Wyatt will work this out.",
        "Liam: All right. I mean, Wyatt's pretty smooth, but I got to tell you, I can't see him charming his way out of this one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Don't do this.",
        "Hope: We're over, Wyatt. You can continue to work here at Forrester, but you and I are no longer a couple.",
        "Wyatt: Hope, I messed up. I lied to you and I disappointed you and I let you believe that I was better than I am -- all the things I was trying to protect you from Liam.",
        "Hope: This is different.",
        "Wyatt: I just wanted to do something special for us. And I made a terrible judgment call -- the worst decision of my life. I am so sorry, Hope. If I could take it back --",
        "Hope: You can't take this back.",
        "Wyatt: I know I can't take it back. All I can do is give you my word. I will never lie to you ever again.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Hope, look at me. I am asking you to give me another chance. Please... just one more chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Ready, Will?",
        "Katie: Fun stuff.",
        "R.J.: Whoo!",
        "Katie: R.J.'s a good kid. He's really sweet with will. He must get that from you. [Chuckles] You seem like you have a really great relationship.",
        "Ridge: That's my son. I got to tell you, Paris was great. Spending time with him -- you know, bringing him to school, picking him up from school, taking him for ice cream. Whose idea was this whole Ojai thing? He should be down here. I got to talk to Brooke. I'll bring him down here for school.",
        "Katie: He's lucky to have someone like you in his life. Bill's a great dad, but he's not always the most positive influence.",
        "Ridge: Uh-huh. Well, Will's got you.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Can I ask you a favor?",
        "Katie: Sure.",
        "Ridge: You got to stop telling me to go back with Brooke. I got to figure that out. You know, it'd be like me telling you to go back with Bill. I'll do my part, and you do yours.",
        "Katie: You're right. You're -- I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. You have to make your own decision. I just want you to be happy.",
        "Ridge: I want you to be happy. You deserve that. You're a good person.",
        "Katie: Yeah!",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Katie: Awesome!",
        "Ridge: Big boy.",
        "Katie: Great job! [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: You think he's gonna be a soccer player?",
        "Katie: He might. We might have a future soccer player on our hands. You know, I used to play a little bit in high school.",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I wasn't very good.",
        "Ridge: Well, it's a long time ago.",
        "Katie: But I may still have some skills.",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: So, what is that -- a challenge?",
        "Katie: It may be. Yeah. You up for it, Forrester?",
        "Ridge: You want a piece of this?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Ridge: All right. Okay. Here we go.",
        "R.J.: I'll watch Will while you beat my dad.",
        "Katie: Awesome! Thanks!",
        "Ridge: How 'bout a little support? Okay, watch. Watch us kick the ball.",
        "Katie: Aah! [Laughs] Oh, my God. Aah! Hey, no fair. You have longer legs! [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: You played in high school, apparently. Nice! What did you play -- bench?",
        "Katie: It's been a long time since high school.",
        "Ridge: Were you the only person on the team?",
        "Katie: God. You didn't tell me you were good! [Laughs] Katie steals, and she scores! Goal! I'm done. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Where are Hope and Wyatt now?",
        "Liam: She took off on her own -- headed back to L.A. As far as your son is concerned, I'm sure he's around here somewhere on his knees, begging Hope for forgiveness.",
        "Quinn: Good. That's all he can do. He can just tell the truth and say he's sorry.",
        "Liam: I mean, yeah, he can do all the groveling he wants, but I don't think it's gonna work. I mean, she can't forgive him, Miss Quinn. You have to understand that. She has to fire him now -- you, too.",
        "Quinn: Oh, Liam, would you just be quiet, please? Why don't you just fly off to Paris and go make babies with Steffy?",
        "Liam: 'Cause I love Hope.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: And I want to marry her, and you've messed with us one too many times. The video, ruining the wedding, trapping me in the elevator -- that was a good one. But none of it worked, did it? None of it. You got caught. Wyatt got caught. It's over now because Hope knows who the two of you are, and she's done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Be mad at me. Yell at me. I don't care. Just get it out so that we can move past this. I know you want that, too. I-I don't want to lose you, Hope. I-I can't. I can't lose you.",
        "Hope: Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: We can do this. Okay? We can get through it. Please. You have to believe me. I will never do anything like that again. I promise you.",
        "Hope: One more chance. That's it.",
        "Wyatt: O-okay. Thank you. I won't let you down.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Ohh.",
        "Ridge: Oh, man!",
        "Katie: Ohh!",
        "Ridge: Ohh. Hey, R.J.! Keep an eye on him! What's this?",
        "Katie: Oh, that's a little bit more my speed. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Shelley?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. Do you know him?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. \"Love's philosophy.\"",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: \"The fountains mingle with the river and the rivers with the ocean, the winds of heaven mix for ever with a sweet emotion; nothing in the world is single; all things by a law divine in one spirit meet and mingle. Why not I with thine?\"",
        "Katie: \"See the mountains kiss high heaven and the waves clasp one another; no sister-flower would be forgiven if it disdained its brother.\"",
        "Ridge: \"And the sunlight clasps the earth and the moonbeams kiss the sea: What is all this sweet work worth if thou kiss not me?\" This is for you."
