        "Katie is smiling and thinking back on her and Ridge's reciting sonnets at the park. Donna walks in and says if housework makes her this happy she can come over to her place anytime. Quinn tells Pam that she thought she was her friend. Pam chuckles that Quinn tried to buy her loyalty with a manicure and crumb cake. And what Wyatt did was not just a little prank, but dangerous and destructive. Wyatt comes in and this is the first he's seen his mother since returning from the road trip. She asks if he has seen Hope and he says he just did. Pam chastises him a bit and then tells him what he did was wrong and both Liam and Hope deserved the truth. Quinn is relieved to hear that Rick would have fired them but he left it up to Hope and she is giving them another chance. He tells his mom only one more chance. This could have been the end for them as Hope is furious. To hear Liam tell it they were out to con the whole world and drag Hope down with them. It was dishonest. Quinn says Liam intends to get Hope back. They must go find her. Wyatt says no more. He was trying to impress Hope and Quinn was running interference on Liam but it almost backfired. They screwed up and he almost lost her and he is not going to be put in that position again. He tells her from now on they are going to be model citizens. And if she can't control herself to do that, then he says he means it, no more trying to fix things. Hope gave him one more chance and he's not going to blow this. He's grateful for that chance. She says okay, so it's like he's on probation. But she does not want him to let up on Liam or move his and Hope's relationship backward. Wyatt says he's not, the trip actually moved it forward. But he has no time to think about Liam. He has to focus on Hope, nothing else. Hope is his future and she has not given up on them. So he does not need Quinn playing Mother Lion anymore. She needs to hear that.",
        "Hope lets herself into Liam's and surprises him. He asks if she is all right. She says yeah she just came back from the beach and went to see her brother. He says Wyatt had them all fooled but at least it's over now. Then he notices her necklace and wonders why she has it back on. Slowly she says Wyatt made a mistake and he was just trying to help. Liam is astonished that she forgave him as Wyatt jeopardized everything she cared about - her line and her reputation.. She says they are going to try and work through this. Liam says Wyatt doesn't deserve another chance. What Wyatt did was criminal, it was fraud. If this gets out FC would be implicated and so would Hope. She wants to be sure that Liam is not going to say anything. He says of course not; he knows how much her reputation means to her. She says she did not come here to talk about Wyatt or his mom. Liam continues \u0096 she can't stay with him. Hope says they are not living together; she is staying with her mom. But they are not breaking up. He shakes his head and says okay but give him a reason that she can not walk away right now. She tries to make Liam see that Wyatt is a changed man since he is with her. He's not ever going to do anything like this again. She apologies and says she did not come here to hurt him. She just thought it was the right thing to do to tell him in person after all they have been through. He says again that Hope can not trust Wyatt. He gave her a necklace and took her in a road trip, but she does not know him. She brushes a few tears from her eyes and says they have talked it over and she believes she can trust him. They are dating. They are in a relationship and you have to try and work it out. She really thinks they can. Liam says but if it's integrity, you either have it or you don't. He wonders what will happen if Wyatt and his mom drag her into another scandal. She says she won't let that happen. He doesn't know how long she can keep her guard up. She says she feels committed to Wyatt. She thanks Liam for always sticking up for her. She gives him a hug. Quinn picks up the phone and calls someone and says she has a job for him .the name is Liam Spencer."

        "Pam: [Chuckles] You tried to buy my loyalty with a manicure and crumb cake.",
        "Quinn: You could have convinced Charlie to let it go. He would have listened to you.",
        "Pam: Yeah. He would have. But what Wyatt did was not just some little prank, Quinn. It was dangerous and destructive.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] [Gasps] Wyatt. Liam just left here. He -- he told me everything. Did you find Hope?",
        "Wyatt: I just saw her.",
        "Quinn: What happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Hope: Hi.",
        "Liam: Hey, you're here.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Oh, I hope you're not doing all that for me.",
        "Liam: Um, [Chuckles] No. Um, living with my dad -- the place kind of turned into a frat house.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Yeah.",
        "Liam: Are you okay?",
        "Hope: Yeah. I went to the office after the beach. I talked to my brother for a little bit.",
        "Liam: About what Wyatt did. Listen, Hope. It's not just you. I mean, Wyatt and his mom fooled everybody, even Eric. But at least it's over now. Um... Hope, wh-- why are you still wearing that necklace?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You surprised me when you came in.",
        "Donna: Yeah. You were, uh, too busy daydreaming.",
        "Katie: I've had a good day.",
        "Donna: Uh-huh. I can see that. You want to tell me what was so good about it?",
        "Katie: It's just like a break in the weather, you know? All these months of stress and anger, and then...today. [Chuckles] It's been a long time since I've been pleasantly surprised.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: What were you thinking, Wyatt?! You could have destroyed Charlie's reputation. And Hope -- did you think it was good to start a new relationship with a lie?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Pam, will you just let me talk to my son alone, please?",
        "Pam: [Scoffs] What you did was wrong, Wyatt. Hope and Liam deserved to know the truth. Oh, and, um, see you later, Girlfriend.",
        "Quinn: As if. Look, don't listen to her. It doesn't matter what she says. What did Hope say? Did you get through to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Tell me you didn't take him back.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Wyatt made a mistake. He was just trying to help.",
        "Liam: You forgave him?",
        "Hope: We're gonna try and work through it.",
        "Liam: Come on. I mean, Wyatt jeopardized everything that you -- you care about -- your line, your reputation. Anybody who could do that either doesn't respect you or doesn't understand you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: I sneak out of work sometimes, too, and it's fun, but...it's never made me as happy as you are.",
        "Katie: Well, you sneak off by yourself, alone. I wasn't alone.",
        "Donna: Uh-huh. You...said you were with Will.",
        "Katie: Yeah. He had a great time.",
        "Donna: Obviously you did, too.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I allowed myself to relax for the first time in a long time. [Chuckles]",
        "Donna: Well, it agrees with you.",
        "Katie: It feels kind of strange, actually.",
        "Donna: Why? Because you enjoyed yourself? Katie... [Sighs] It's okay to be selfish every once in a while. Yeah, it's been a long time, and it's probably why it feels strange, but there's nothing wrong with feeling good.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Donna: Unless, of course, you're back with Bill.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Donna: Is that --",
        "Katie: No. [Chuckles]",
        "Donna: I mean, it -- [Chuckles] If you did, I-I would support you, obviously.",
        "Katie: No. It -- it's not Bill.",
        "Donna: But there is a guy? Well, you might as well admit it. You can't hide anything from your family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: We're not fired?",
        "Wyatt: Well... [Chuckles] If it had been up to Rick, yes, we would be.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: But he left it up to Hope.",
        "Quinn: So, she's giving us another shot?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. And me, too.",
        "Quinn: Oh, Baby, I am so relieved.",
        "Wyatt: One more chance. That's it. I mean, this could have been the end for us. I mean, she -- Hope was furious.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but you explained everything to her, right? That -- that you never actually intended to steal the diamond. It was -- it was for a publicity stunt. You weren't being malicious.",
        "Wyatt: But it was dishonest. Okay? To hear Liam tell it, you and I were out to con the whole world and drag Hope down with us.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but he's expecting her to come back to him.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Wait. Is Hope still in the building? They could be together right now. We have to go and stop them.",
        "Wyatt: No, no. Mom, no more.",
        "Quinn: He is intending to get her back.",
        "Wyatt: He almost did because we screwed up. I was trying to impress Hope, and you were running interference on Liam. But it backfired. And I almost lost her, and I am not gonna be in that position again. From now on, you and I are model citizens. And if you can't do that, if you can't control yourself, Mom --",
        "Quinn: Okay, okay, okay.",
        "Wyatt: Please.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: I mean it. No more trying to \"Fix\" things. Hope gave me another chance, and I am not gonna blow it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Wyatt doesn't deserve another chance. Wh-what he did was criminal, literally. It was -- it was fraud. Hope, if this gets out, Forrester would be implicated. So would you.",
        "Hope: You -- you're not gonna tell anyone, are you?",
        "Liam: No. Of course not. I know how much your family's reputation means to you. But Wyatt doesn't. He doesn't. And -- and neither does Quinn, and this is not an isolated incident.",
        "Hope: Liam, I did not come here to talk about Wyatt or his mom.",
        "Liam: You can't stay with him.",
        "Hope: We're -- we're not... living together. I-I'm staying with my mom. I just -- we're not breaking up.",
        "Liam: Okay. Give me -- give me a reason. Give me a reason you can't walk away right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: The most important man in my life right now is my son.",
        "Donna: Mm-hmm. But there is someone else.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Donna: Okay. Fine. Fine. But he must really be something the way you were...daydreaming earlier and... okay. Fine. Be all mysterious if you want. But just...tell me he's a good guy. Because the last guy you picked...",
        "Katie: Bill is a good father, and he's a good businessman.",
        "Donna: Katie, even when he's being a good husband, he is... still so dangerous.",
        "Katie: Well, I don't find that attractive anymore.",
        "Donna: Well, that's what happens when you meet a guy with real morals. Well, for your sake, I hope you have. [Chuckles] I used to go for the bad-boy type, and...well, then I met Eric. Take my advice here. If you ever meet a guy like that, you hold on to him. Anyway, I'm -- I'm available for babysitting if you want. Nights, weekends, whenever. [Chuckles] You can even have Will spend the night. You know, if you ever have a special plan...for the evening.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Oh, God.",
        "Donna: Bye.",
        "Katie: Bye.",
        "Donna: I love you.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Enough secrets. No more surprises.",
        "Quinn: Hey, I'm all about honesty.",
        "Wyatt: Uh --",
        "Quinn: Who made sure that Hope knew what Liam was doing? He could have sent Steffy away. He didn't have to send that video. All I did, so simply, was --",
        "Wyatt: Okay, okay. Stop. Stop. Just stop. If she heard -- if she heard you talking like this, any hint of manipulation or deception, she's gone, Mom.",
        "Quinn: So, what, you're on probation?",
        "Wyatt: She's giving me another chance, and I'm grateful for that.",
        "Quinn: But Liam is still in the picture?",
        "Wyatt: Hope wants to make this work.",
        "Quinn: Baby, you're at the beginning of this relationship.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: It's supposed to be exciting. You just went on this great adventure, and you're -- you're trying to make it work?",
        "Wyatt: She almost left me, Mom. She took off the necklace I gave her. She said what I did was insane.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, I'm sure that's the way Liam made it sound.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: Look, I'm not justifying what you did that day at the boutique, because I told you that I thought it was wrong. But it's nothing compared to what Liam's done to her. I mean, there was no other woman involved. You've always been 100% loyal to Hope.",
        "Wyatt: And I always will be. And I'm gonna prove that to her from now on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You're really not upset with him anymore?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] We have some things, you know, that we need to deal with.",
        "Liam: I mean, when we were at the beach, he was making all kinds of excuses, and you didn't want to hear them.",
        "Hope: I just needed some time to think.",
        "Liam: And he didn't give it to you, did he? He tracked you down. Where -- where was it? Was it Eric's, at the office? He didn't even get fired, did he?",
        "Hope: Liam... Liam, he will never do anything like this ever again.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs]",
        "Hope: He's not the same man. He's not. He's changed. Since being with me, he's -- that's not...what I meant. That's -- that's not coming out right. I -- okay. I shouldn't have even come.",
        "Liam: No, no, no. Please, don't go. Don't. Don't leave.",
        "Hope: I'm so sorry. Liam, I didn't some here to hurt you. I really didn't. I just -- I felt like it was the right thing to do was to tell you in person after everything that we've been through.",
        "Liam: O-okay. So, tell me. Why are you doing this? I mean, it's not like you owe him anything. He gave you a necklace and took you on a road trip.",
        "Hope: I've made my decision.",
        "Liam: You can't -- Hope, you can't trust him.",
        "Hope: I think that I can. I do. We've talked about it, and I-I believe that I can. Wyatt and I... we're dating. We're in a relationship, and... when you're in a relationship, you have to try to work things out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: This is...all new to me, you know?",
        "Quinn: You should be excited.",
        "Wyatt: I am. But I can't get carried away. And neither can you.",
        "Quinn: So, you and Hope aren't taking a step back.",
        "Wyatt: No. This trip was actually a big step forward.",
        "Quinn: Everything you thought it would be?",
        "Wyatt: And more. Until Liam showed up and made her question her choice. Look, I am not taking anything for granted right now. And I'm not going to push Hope into setting her feelings in stone, either.",
        "Quinn: You can't let Liam interfere.",
        "Wyatt: My focus is Hope, our relationship. I can't worry about anything else right now, and I know you want to get all mother lion about this, but I've got it. Okay? Do you hear me? Do you understand what I'm saying -- how important this is for me? Hope is my future. She hasn't given up on us. And I never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I really think that Wyatt and I can get past this.",
        "Liam: You really believe that?",
        "Hope: I do. He understands what I need from him.",
        "Liam: But -- I mean, integrity isn't something you learn. You either have it or you don't. What if -- what if Wyatt and his mom go off on the rails, again? What -- what if they drag you and your line into another scandal?",
        "Hope: Don't worry. I won't let that happen.",
        "Liam: So, what? You're just gonna keep your guard up? For how long? Why would you do that to yourself?",
        "Hope: Oh, God. Pam should never have come to you about this. She should have come straight to me. [Sniffles]",
        "Liam: [Voice breaking] Hope, you've seen -- you've seen it. You've seen what Wyatt and his mother are capable of. I mean, this is -- this is who they are. That's not changing. That's what I've been trying to tell you. And I'm not getting through, and I don't understand why. Is it Steffy? Is it -- is it Steffy? Are you -- are you worried that she's gonna come back again and make trouble for us? You'd rather take your chances with Wyatt?",
        "Hope: I feel committed to him.",
        "Liam: Okay. You can't help how you feel.",
        "Hope: Thank you for always looking out for me.",
        "Liam: Always.",
        "Hope: [Sniffles]",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Just listen to me. I have a job for you. His name is Liam Spencer."
