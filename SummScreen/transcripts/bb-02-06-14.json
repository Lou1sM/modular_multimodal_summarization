        "Wyatt prepares his beach house for Hope's arrival. He makes sure the fire is going, the candles lit, flowers arranged and their table set. She comes in and he greets her. He is glad she likes and says he is showing her that he can be adaptable. They were unplugged living in the trailer so he thought tonight would just be a romantic evening in his home. He gives her a pink rose and they kiss. He says it is just a small token of affection and an apology for taking the diamond. It was a stupid prank from the start and then he should have told her and he will never keep anything from her again. Oliver chats with Donovan, a surfing instructor, at Bikini Bar and they tease each other about being around beautiful models all day. Liam walks in and Ollie invites him to come and have a brew, from the looks he has Hope on his mind. Liam says they have no idea how bad he needs a drink. Just when he thinks he knows Hope she goes and does the opposite. He tells them that he found out something that he thought would send her running in the opposite direction but somehow Wyatt talked her out of it. And she bought it and they are probably together right now. Rachel brings in a few papers for Quinn and tells her there is someone to see her. It's Aly. Quinn immediately compliments her shoes. And she will even be happy to put in a good word with Eric if Aly would like to work on her own brand of shoes. A little shy, Aly asks Quinn what does she want. Quinn says Liam needs her. Quinn says Hope is with Wyatt now and she happens to know Liam is going through a very hard time and he could use a friend to support him. Aly says she already is his friend. Quinn wants to be blunt. She knows Aly is nuts about Liam and she doesn't have to be embarrassed about that. They make a cute match. She says she is never wrong about these things. And one day Hope ad Liam will be over and it will sink in and Liam will move on. Aly could be there when that happens. Aly tells her no offense but she knows Quinn is all about Wyatt getting what he wants. Quinn says yes but she did not mean romantically for Liam, but just be there. And if anything happened in the future that would be her call ..and she wishes her luck and says she would not be surprised. Quinn asks her if she's looked in the mirror lately \u0096 that flaming red hair and gorgeous big blue eyes. She just needs to enhance it a bit. She arranges to find where Liam is and then tells Aly they will go to makeup and wardrobe and do some magic. Aly wonders if she is a good witch or a bad witch. Quinn remarks that she is versatile so come on, this is gonna be fun. Liam and Ollie continue to commiserate. Ollie asks if Liam is looking for company. Is that why he came in here tonight. Liam says no; hope is still the only woman alive for him. It's excruciating that she is with Wyatt, not just because of the jealousy thing with brothers and all. He really thinks the Fullers are bad people and nothing good can come of it. Hope tells Wyatt that she saw Liam earlier tonight. He asks how did that go. Hope says it was a little painful and she's really not even comfortable talking about him now. But she did tell him they they are in a relationship and that means forgiveness and working things out and that is exactly what they are going to do. She confesses the reason she is here is because it feels so good. This time with him, he makes her feel very happy. He says that was his goal all along. She says even when he explained about taking the diamond, it made sense in a bizarre way but he has to know that he can never do anything like that again because she can not be with a man who would lie and scam his way into things no matter how sexy he is. He almost blushes when he realizes she thinks he is sexy. She says yes she does and pulls him into a kiss.",
        "Ollie tells Liam to be careful. He can't go barreling in making accusations. It will only make it look like he is picking on Wyatt. Wyatt must be saying all the right things. Liam says if he only knew. Wyatt has been a student of Hope ever since he met her and Hope is too trusting. Wyatt is gonna hurt her. Ollie reminds him that Hope is a grown woman and can make her own choices so he'd let it just take it's natural course of events. Liam says he is afraid he can't let it get to that point. He has to get Hope away from both of the Fullers. Wyatt tells Hope it was a scary moment when he almost lost her. But it will never happen again as he is going to be on his best behavior. Hope says it is his mother too; she takes things a little far. Wyatt says he is aware and has told her so ..model citizens from here on out, no more interfering. Hope says she realizes Quinn can be a little OCD when it comes to Wyatt and he's accepted that. Wyatt says she won't be a problem anymore, no more manipulations or tricks. Oliver leaves and Liam is about to leave too when he spots a totally hot Aly walking in. He goes over and tells her that she looks beautiful. He finds out she came here to eat so he invites himself too as he has not eaten. He selects them a table. She tells him that she knows he is going through a hard time so he does not have to do this. He assures her he is feeling better already. Wyatt and Hope cuddle on the couch and kiss. He says he kind of likes this cleaning the slate. It gives him a chance to prove he can curb these natural tendencies to be reckless. She says she likes his spontaneity and his impulsiveness most of the time. He says he just wants to be the kind of guy that deserves a woman liked her. She says he is but he does come from a questionable gene pool calling him to the dark side. She says Bill and Quinn, but he says that is just DNA and he can rise above that. That gives him a reason that he has never had before, but now there is something ..someone at stake to live up to. Before he had nothing to lose and he never realized until now how empty that was. He doesn't want to be that guy anymore. She says she is rooting for him and that is all behind them now. She leans in for another kiss and they hold each other tightly."

        "Hope: Yeah!",
        "Wyatt: Well, um... I'm just showing you how I can be adaptable. We did things my way -- unplugged, living in a trailer. And tonight it's just a romantic evening at home.",

        "Oliver: Always.",
        "Donovan: Taking photos of insanely gorgeous models all day? Must be tough.",

        "Donovan: Excuse me.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, well, that's why they call it a job. Besides, uh, you're one to talk, Mr. Surf instructor.",
        "Donovan: [Chuckles]",
        "Oliver: Your job's basically an excuse to hang out with girls in bikinis all day.",
        "Donovan: Somebody's got to. [Chuckles]",
        "Oliver: Hey. Can you hit my friend? Dude looks like he needs a drink.",
        "Liam: Dude, you have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rachel: Caroline wanted you to see these.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, thanks. I've been waiting for these.",
        "Rachel: Oh, and there's someone here to see you.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I'm so glad you came.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Thank you, Rachel. You can go now. Please close the door behind you. So, Aly, um, can I get you something to drink -- soda, water?",
        "Aly: No, no, no. I'm good.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I love your shoes.",
        "Aly: Thank you.",
        "Quinn: It's like mini architecture -- shoes these days -- like little works of art.",
        "Aly: So, why did you want to see me?",
        "Quinn: Liam needs you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I know that look. It means Hope.",
        "Liam: Just when I think I know exactly what she's gonna do, Hope does the opposite.",
        "Donovan: I thought you and Hope called it quits. I've been seeing her around with Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Yeah, don't remind me. I found out something that should have sent her running in the opposite direction, but, well, somehow, Wyatt seems to talk his way out of it. \"I did it for you. I did it for love.\" And she buys it. They're probably together right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: This is so nice!",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. It's just a small gesture of apology and thanks. Um...you know, harmless intentions aside, I was an idiot for taking that diamond. It was a bad idea from the start.",
        "Hope: Well, I'm glad you see that now.",
        "Wyatt: You're right. Having done it, I should have told you, so I apologize for all of the above. I will never keep anything from you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: So, this is about Liam?",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but you know what? Let's -- let's catch up first. How is it for you, working here at Forrester?",
        "Aly: It's great.",
        "Quinn: You like it?",
        "Aly: I love it.",
        "Quinn: You're getting to work with one of fashion's brightest stars.",
        "Aly: Hope is incredible. She's warm and funny and generous. I am learning so much from her.",
        "Quinn: You're lucky to have her as a mentor. And I understand that you want to, uh, have your own footwear line someday, right?",
        "Aly: That's my dream.",
        "Quinn: Well, that would explain your excellent taste in shoes -- not that my opinion carries a lot of weight, but I think it's an excellent idea.",
        "Aly: Really?",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Sure. What woman has enough shoes? [Chuckles] Have you pitched it to Eric?",
        "Aly: Not in any great detail, but he knows it's what I want to do. He seems to be on board when the time is right, but I am nowhere near ready.",
        "Quinn: Oh. See, you're smart to know that. Your day will come. And, listen -- Eric and I are friends, so I can put in a good word, for whatever it's worth.",
        "Aly: That'd be awesome. Thank you.",
        "Quinn: You're welcome. I-I like to help out a young woman with aspirations. And I'm here to help. If you have any questions, you can come to me anytime.",
        "Aly: That's very generous. But you didn't ask me here to give motivational advice. What's this about Liam needing me?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I happen to know that Liam is going through a very difficult time. Hope is with Wyatt now.",
        "Aly: Yes, I know.",
        "Quinn: And Liam is distraught. He needs a friend, and, naturally, I thought of you.",
        "Aly: You want me to be Liam's friend?",
        "Quinn: Well, you already are his friend. I mean let him know you'd be there to support him during this difficult time.",
        "Aly: Well, I think he already knows that.",
        "Quinn: Not all of it.",
        "Aly: What do you mean?",
        "Quinn: Can I be blunt?",
        "Aly: I wish you would.",
        "Quinn: You're nuts about the guy.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donovan: I'm headed out. Unlike you guys, I got a date.",
        "Oliver: Ouch.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Rub it in.",
        "Donovan: I'm really sorry to hear about the situation with Hope and Wyatt. Let me know if there's anything I can do.",
        "Liam: Yeah -- maybe run the Fullers out of town? See ya.",
        "Donovan: Later.",
        "Liam: So, here I sit with you.",
        "Oliver: You know, I was told recently I'm pretty good company...",
        "Liam: Oh, really?",
        "Oliver: ...From a reliable source.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah? Anybody I know?",
        "Oliver: Actually...",
        "Liam: Act-- actually? Really? That's all you're giving me?",
        "Oliver: For now.",
        "Liam: Geez. Mysterious.",
        "Oliver: I don't want to jinx it. I'm kind of a long shot as it is. So, what about you? You ready to move on? Maybe why you stopped in here tonight?",
        "Liam: Uh, n-no, man. Hope's the only woman alive.",
        "Oliver: Must be tough for you, knowing she's with Wyatt right now.",
        "Liam: It's excruciating -- and not just because of the jealousy thing. I mean, I know there is that. It's just 'cause I know -- I know -- that nothing good can come from Hope being involved with those...Fullers.",
        "Oliver: Do you really think they're bad people?",
        "Liam: Oliver, they've already proven it, dude. Just think about it. Wyatt moves in -- immediately starts putting me down to my dad and to Hope. He kisses Hope in my living room, knowing that she's engaged to me. Meanwhile, you got Quinn, who accesses my e-mail, sends a video I made for Steffy to Hope, arranges for Steffy's return on my wedding day, writes a note to Hope directing her to the cabin, where she's gonna see me with Steffy -- wedding's off. Hope takes off with Wyatt. That's the first time. But Quinn's just getting started. Then she traps me in an elevator so her shady son can whisk Hope out of town again, this time on a trip guaranteed to \"progress\" their relationship, which it obviously did. Shall I go on? Quinn and Wyatt are not good people.",
        "Oliver: I think I got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: So, I want you to know that I saw Liam earlier.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, yeah? How -- how was that?",
        "Hope: Uh, it was a little painful, and, actually, I don't really feel comfortable talking to you about him and vice versa, but I did want to tell you that I told him you and I are in a relationship and that means forgiveness and that means working things out when possible and that's exactly what we were going to do.",
        "Wyatt: And here you are.",
        "Hope: Here I am.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hope: And you know why?",
        "Wyatt: Why?",
        "Hope: Because it feels good. This moment, this time with you -- it's... you make me really happy.",
        "Wyatt: That was my goal all along.",
        "Hope: You know, you explained to me why you stole the diamond, and, knowing you, it makes some bizarre sense.",
        "Wyatt: What?!",
        "Hope: It does. Um...I mean, it's at least not enough to be a deal-breaker.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Hope: But...you've got to know that you can't ever do anything like that ever again, because I can't be with a man who's gonna lie and scam his way into things, no matter how sexy he is.",
        "Wyatt: I -- [Chuckles] You think I'm sexy?",
        "Hope: Yes. I do.",
        "Wyatt: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You understand why I'm concerned, right?",
        "Oliver: I do. They manipulated themselves into jobs and families and relationships pretty successfully.",
        "Liam: These people lie like they breathe. Who knows what skeletons they've got in their closet?",
        "Oliver: They're not gonna make it easy for you to mess up this good thing they've got going. You know, you can't just barrel in, shouting accusations. It'll make it look like you're picking on Wyatt.",
        "Liam: It kills me that he can talk his way out of everything.",
        "Oliver: He must be saying what Hope needs to hear.",
        "Liam: You don't even know, man. Wyatt has been a student of all things Hope since the moment he showed up. He knows exactly how to work her. And why does she let him? That's what I don't understand. Hope is so sensible. I mean, why doesn't she see Wyatt for who he really is?",
        "Oliver: How do you explain attraction? You throw sensibility out the window. And you got to figure Wyatt's presenting a much different version of himself to Hope than the one you're seeing.",
        "Liam: I know. Hope's too trusting, and Wyatt's not worthy, and he's gonna hurt her. He will -- or his mom -- unless I can stop them.",
        "Oliver: Frankly, I don't see how you can. Hope's a woman. Makes her own choices. If it were me... I'd let things take their natural course.",
        "Liam: I just can't in good conscience let it get to that point. I mean, Wyatt's got Hope -- I don't know -- hypnotized or something, so she's not hearing me, but I'm not gonna shut up until she does. Wyatt and Quinn are dangerous. I got to get Hope away from them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Scary moment for me, thinking I'd lost you.",
        "Hope: Came close.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. But it won't happen again, because I'm gonna be on my best behavior from now on.",
        "Hope: Well, Wyatt, I mean, it's not just that. It's... you know, it's your mom, too. She takes things a little far.",
        "Wyatt: I'm aware, and I've told her so.",
        "Hope: I don't get the feeling that she's a very good listener.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but she listens to me. And I was very clear, all right? Model citizens from here on out -- no more interfering.",
        "Hope: I realize that she can be a little O.C.D. when it comes to you, you know, but you've accepted it. You live with her.",
        "Wyatt: She won't be a problem for us, okay? She's out of it -- done. No more manipulating and no more tricks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Why do you think I've got a thing for Liam?",
        "Quinn: Trained eye. And, hey, don't be embarrassed. I totally get it. I mean, Liam is an appealing guy. You -- you two make a good match.",
        "Aly: You think?",
        "Quinn: Oh, I'm never wrong about these things. And Hope and Liam are over. One day it'll sink in and he'll move on. Why not be there when he does?",
        "Aly: No offense, but it's obvious you're all about getting whatever Wyatt wants.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Well, you think I meant romantically. No. No, no, no, no, no. See, that -- that would be really inappropriate. I meant to be there for him as a friend. If something happens in the future, well, that's your call, and I wish you luck, but, uh, it wouldn't surprise me.",
        "Aly: I'd be surprised.",
        "Quinn: Aly... have you looked in the mirror recently? I mean, you are drop- dead gorgeous -- flaming red hair, your beautiful blue eyes? You just need to -- you just need to enhance everything.",
        "Aly: You really think Liam could ever be interested in me?",
        "Quinn: Let's find out.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Adele: Spencer Publications.",
        "Quinn: Hi. I have Ms. Carlton on the line for Mr. Liam Spencer.",
        "Adele: Sorry. He's gone for the day.",
        "Quinn: Oh. They were supposed to meet for dinner.",
        "Adele: At Bikini?",
        "Quinn: That's it. Thanks so much. You're going to Bikini. Do you know it?",
        "Aly: Sure. I-I do.",
        "Quinn: Come with me.",
        "Aly: Where?",
        "Quinn: We're gonna go spin some magic.",
        "Aly: Are you a good witch or a bad witch?",
        "Quinn: Let's just say I'm versatile, as is our hair and makeup department. Come on. This is gonna be fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Remember what I told you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, think before I act. I-I know. I got it.",
        "Oliver: Can't let Wyatt see you coming.",
        "Liam: I hear ya. The less prepared he his, the more likely he'll be stuck with the truth of who he is where Hope can't miss it. It's good advice.",
        "Oliver: I got you. And you got me.",
        "Liam: Wh--",
        "Oliver: Thanks, man.",
        "Liam: See ya, dude. Thanks a lot. [Chuckling] Whoa. You look beautiful!",
        "Aly: Thank you.",
        "Liam: What are you doing? Are you here for dinner?",
        "Aly: Thought I'd grab a quick bite.",
        "Liam: Man, I could definitely eat if you want to grab a table, unless -- are you -- are you meeting somebody here?",
        "Aly: No. I would love to have dinner with you.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Aly: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Uh...this one.",
        "Aly: Thank you.",
        "Liam: It's a pretty big coincidence, right -- us both ending up here?",
        "Aly: Yeah... except you don't have to do this.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Aly: Hang out with me. I know you're having a hard time, so if you would rather be alone, I totally understand.",
        "Liam: Are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "Aly: Never.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Good, 'cause you're already making me feel better. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. I kind of like this clean-slate stuff.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] You say that now.",
        "Wyatt: I'm serious. It just -- you know, it gives me a chance to prove how to curb these natural tendencies to be reckless and these crazy first impulses that I have.",
        "Hope: No, no, no, no. No. I like that you can be impulsive. I like your spontaneity.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: Most of the time.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] Right.",
        "Hope: [Laughing] Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: But I just -- I want to be the kind of guy who deserves a woman like you.",
        "Hope: You do. But you do come from a very questionable gene pool calling you to the dark side...",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Hope: ...Bill and Quinn.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but it's mere DNA. I'll rise above it.",
        "Hope: Oh, good. I'm rooting for you.",
        "Wyatt: See? That -- that. That gives me a reason. You know, I-I've never really had that before, but now there's something at stake, something -- someone -- to live up to. It's just, you know, I've always went through life just... no ties and no commitments and nothing to lose. And I never really realized how empty that was until now. Anyway, I-I just -- I don't -- I don't want to be that guy anymore. And I never want to hurt you the way that I did on a stupid whim.",
        "Hope: Well, it's all behind us.",
        "Wyatt: Your capacity to forgive and...",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: ...That face -- I mean, that face...",
        "Hope: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] You know, when you say you're rooting for me, believing in me, that gives me reason... to everything... to life.",
