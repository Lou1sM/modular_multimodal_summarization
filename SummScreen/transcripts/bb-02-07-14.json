        "On the couch, Wyatt and Hope cuddle and kiss. She jokes that someone is making the most of his second chance. He says he'd better. He's going to spend the rest of his life making sure she doesn't regret giving it. He holds her hand and looks at the emerald bracelet and thanks her for putting it back on. He reminds her just how much fun they had at Emerald Bay. She asks if he is ready for another trip. She likes adventures with him. She'd had fun until that last part. She doesn't expect a trip like that every time. That would be a lot to live up to. They remember their lovemaking in the tent on the beach. Wyatt says it will only get better and better. Aly tells Liam that he didn't have to switch to water on her account. He ways yes he did. If he had kept on he would be droning on and on and boring her to death about Hope. She says she is a good listener. She also says if he wants to pass a message along, her dad sees Steffy every day. He thanks her but says no. That marriage was a precious time in his life and he's always going to love her but that chapter is closed in his life. He admits he still wants to be with Hope and he thinks that is still possible. Hope catches Wyatt looking off into the distance with a satisfied look on his face. He says he is just happy. Talk about facing the worst and they did and are still here. She says that is because she trusts him and knows he won't do something like that again. He says he won't. She changed him. The man he is today would never make that mistake again. They are moving on ..more fun ..more adventures. Liam tells Aly that he had no idea he was this hungry. She's glad she ran into him then, making him eat. He admits she probably saved him from a typically embarrassing moment at the bar. Hope chose Wyatt and here Aly finds Liam drowning his sorrows at a bar. She tells him that drowning is not allowed on her watch. He can consider her his own personal flotation device. Liam tells her that she looks amazing. He's never seen her in her \"I'm going out tonight look.\" She wonders if he is worried about her self esteem getting all dressed up for one. He quips that he figures it is one of the waiters here and she can give him a good swift kick under the table and he'll butt out. She thanks him but says doubt he will even notice. Liam says looking like that yes he will.",
        "Ridge and RJ show up at Katie's at her request. She says she indeed is not tired of them. She enjoys their time together. RJ says she wore his dad out and he had to take a nap. Ridge says it was all that soccer and poetry reading. They both enjoy crawling around on the floor after Will. Katie says he is good at making forts. Ridge tells her there is more to him than making pretty dresses. And he even suggests to RJ that once the season starts they can take Aunt Katie to a soccer or hockey game. She says they are talking her language now. She has to excuse herself to make a memo for the office. Later she thanks him for being there and taking her to the park. She says mostly it's her family. They don't expect her to grow up, always the youngest. They must think she is weak and needs protection. Ridge says he always thought she was a bit shy but not weak. She is smart and watched her own sisters, saw them make mistakes and learned from them and now making her own decisions. He's not surprised that now she is running a company and he feels like he has known her all her life but just now getting to really know her. Aly tells Liam that she never really liked the fact that Hope was seeing both Liam and Wyatt. It seemed dishonest. But this is even worse now that she has picked Wyatt. Liam says he knows but he thinks there is a tiny part of Hope that feels like she has to because of how far she allowed the relationship to go. She probably feels like she has to make it work with him. He says it's okay. It's clearly not stopping him. A lot of guys would have given up by now and gone and found someone else. But he says he just can't. He loves her. They have been through so many obstacles. This is just one more. Hope won't admit it just yet but Wyatt is a jerk. She's not doing anything about it yet but she has seen a glimpse so Liam says he will just wait. Wyatt and Hope are kissing and wrapped up in each other's arms, backing their way into another part of the house, ripping off clothes as they go. He picks her up and she jumps straddle into his arms as they head to the bed. Aly says it's one thing not to like someone but another to think they are genuinely bad. Liam says maybe but Wyatt is bad. He's proven it and Quinn is even worse. Aly looks guilty when Liam says she will do anything for her baby boy. He says he would be married right now if it weren't for Quinn. But it doesn't matter, she really is only delaying the inevitable. He and Hope haven't failed yet. Liam gets a text and tells Aly that he is sorry to cut this short. But there is a meeting called by Katie about him so he'd better go see what this is about. Wyatt and Hope make beautiful love. He kisses her face, her lips, her neck, her shoulders, her arms and her legs. She can't get enough. He tells her that he doesn't know what he did right up in Big Bear that day. He just remembers looking into those eyes after kissing her awake that day and knowing what was ahead .and now they are here. Katie comes back from putting Will down and finds RJ and Ridge cleaning up. RJ says they mess up, they clean up. Ridge sends him on out to the car so he can talk schedules with Katie. But then he grabs hold of her arm and says they need to talk about it. He knows she is feeling something and he is too. And she deserves to be admired and appreciated and desired. He moves closer and she leans in almost Liam almost walks in on them but ducks back out. Katie backs away and puts her hand across her mouth and says OMG, they can't do this. She cannot do this to her sister."

        "Ridge: I always thought you were driven.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Ridge: You -- you don't think that?",
        "Katie: No, I-I-I do, actually. I'm just used to other people thinking otherwise -- mostly family, I guess. I guess that's what you get when you're the youngest. Everyone expects you to never grow up. I know that Brooke and Donna don't mean to, but sometimes the way they talk to me, it's -- it's like they think I'm weak and I need protection. They still think I'm that little girl looking out her window at the lives they're leading.",
        "Ridge: I always thought you were shy, but I didn't think you were weak. But you're smart. You're watching your sisters, learn from their mistakes, and make your own decisions.",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: Look at you now -- a woman, a mother, running a company. I'm not surprised. It just seems strange to be part of your life for so long and it just...feels like I just now met you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: You know, I didn't like the fact that Hope was seeing both of you. It felt dishonest. But this almost feels worse. It never occurred to me that she would choose Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Well... I think -- I think despite everything else at this point, there's a tiny part of her that feels like she has to.",
        "Aly: Why?",
        "Liam: Because... [Chuckles] Because of how far she's allowed their relationship to go. I think she feels like she's supposed to make it work with him.",
        "Aly: Oh. I'm sorry.",
        "Liam: No, hey. I'm, you know, clearly not letting it stop me. A lot of guys would probably give up by now -- go find somebody else -- but I don't know. I just -- I can't. I can't. I love her. We've been through so many obstacles already. This is just one more.",
        "Aly: Kind of a big one.",
        "Liam: Not really. I mean, hope won't admit it yet, but Wyatt's a jerk, you know? He's self-centered and he's a liar, and I was right about him all along, and Hope knows that. She's not doing anything about it yet, but at least she's seen a glimpse of who he really is. So, you know, I'll wait.",
        "[Emily Jaye's \"Please Keep Melting Me\" plays] 4:00 in the morning everyone's sleeping but we've been awake all night the sun starts to break through like me, it falls on you and nothing has ever felt so right and I don't close my eyes 'cause there's no dream as good as you by my side I'm me-e-e-lting",
        "Aly: Careful, Liam. It's one thing not to like somebody, but to think they're genuinely bad --",
        "Liam: He is! He's bad. Wyatt is bad, and I've proven it. He's bad -- bad Wyatt! -- And his mom is even worse.",
        "Aly: She is a little intense, huh?",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. Listen, I'm not a parent, so I guess I don't know, but there's got to be a limit to how involved you let yourself get in your kid's life. I mean, Quinn is such a manipulator. She's always working it to make sure her baby boy gets whatever he wants. I mean, I'd be married right now if it weren't for Quinn, honestly. But, you know, it doesn't even -- it doesn't even matter. I -- she's just delaying the inevitable, and Hope and I haven't failed yet.",

        "Liam: It's a memo from Katie. She's calling an executive meeting to make an announcement about me. Uh, you know, I'm really sorry. I think I might have to cut this short. I got to -- I got to find out what's going on.",
