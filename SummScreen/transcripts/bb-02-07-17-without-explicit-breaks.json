        "Bill tells Brooke that Ridge will disillusion her again as always and once again she will be his. Eventually she tells him why she really went to Italy. It was to see Hope, but she also wanted to get away and clear her head and decide what she really wanted in life. In the past she has always followed her heart and she wants to make sure this commitment is something she wants for the rest of her life. Holding her hand he tells her that he would like to spare her all that disappointment. Thomas doesn't seem too enthused when Steffy tells him she wants him to be in the wedding party \u0096 yeah whatever. She realizes it is still the co-CEO thing that he does not like being passed over and now he is holding it against her. She feels that he thinks she is not qualified all by herself, she needs her dad looking out and working with her. Thomas says he is not trying to over blow his importance, but the company was founded on designers and he thinks they need to stick with that and not all the social media. Liam tells Ivy this will be the wedding of the century, no the millennium. Ivy says she knows she is biased but she would like to offer Australia as his wedding site. He's intrigued. But he nixes the idea of Brooke and Ridge marrying there too as Bill will be there and that would be a gut punch to him.",
        "Steffy tells Thomas he needs to take a breath and not say something he will regret later. He is an important part of this company, a great designer and she is counting on him. He offers he just might need to find another job, start a house of his own. He even throws in that he met Sally Spectra earlier today and she is back in town and ready to start up Spectra again. Pam rushes in and interrupts and shows them a quick glance of a press conference Sally is holding right now \u0096 big news as she only had one reporter show up. But she is brash and sassy and tells them that singlehandedly she stopped the wrecking ball and will be bringing another panache fashion house to town to compete with that other one. She attempts to display the large logo outside the building only to be foiled while Steffy laughs and Thomas seems amused ..maybe a little sympathetic. Steffy says looks like the apple did not fall far from that tree. She and Thomas continue their argument. He thinks it is unfair that she was offered the job that he worked his whole life for and it just lands in her lap. He leaves abruptly before she can say more. Brooke tells Bill that she understands why he feels the way he does. He says he still blames Ridge but he holds himself responsible too and he never should have left her at the altar. That was a mistake, the worst one of his life. His ego and pride ended up in overdrive and he lost her, but he is not going to lose her for the rest of his life. That is not his ego talking, but his heart. So just say yes. Come back to him."

        "Bill: Did I tell you how glad I am you're finally home? You know, better, yet, how about I show you?",
        "Brooke: Oh, bill! [Scoffs]",
        "Bill: Oh, you're worried about the poseur getting jealous?",
        "Brooke: The poseur, as you call him, happens to be my fianc\u00e9.",
        "Bill: Mm, not for long. He's gonna do something to disillusion you, as always. And once that happens... that'll be that.",
        "Steffy: Looks great. Release it to the press ASAP.",
        "Pam: You betcha.",
        "Thomas: Release what?",
        "Pam: Uh...just an official announcement about your sis and your dad being new co-C.E.O.s.",
        "Steffy: Big brother, there is something I want to run by you.",
        "Thomas: Isn't that what your co-C.E.O.s for?",
        "Steffy: No, this isn't business. This is personal -- wedding-plans personal.",
        "Thomas: You set a date?",
        "Steffy: Uh, when and where -- that's up in the air, but we want you to be in the wedding party.",
        "Thomas: Sure. Yeah. Whatever.",
        "Steffy: What do you mean \"whatever?\" Thomas, you should be happy for Liam and me. This is a great time for our family.",
        "Thomas: It's a great time for you and dad.",
        "Ivy: Steffy's always in a meeting, that very busy co-C.E.O. Of ours.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Your fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Congratulations, by the way.",
        "Liam: Uh, thank you.",
        "Ivy: I -- [Chuckles] I mean it. I do. I-I actually want to know everything. I want to know the guest list. I want to know potential location for the nuptials.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Um... well, we're still hashing all that out.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Liam: But, uh... one thing's for sure. My -- my bride and I -- we want it to be...really special.",
        "Ivy: Wedding of the year, huh?",
        "Liam: No. No, no. God, no. Decade. Century?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Millennium. Millennium.",
        "Liam: Uh, we've got some cool ideas. We're just -- we're just trying to narrow it down right now, you know?",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, why don't you start with the obvious? Location. I mean, what if you two had a wedding outside of los Angeles?",
        "Liam: Well, we already kind of did the mountaintop in aspen thing.",
        "Ivy: Well, I was actually thinking Australia. I mean, I know I'm biased, but...come on. There really is nowhere more beautiful.",
        "Liam: Australia.",
        "Ivy: And the best thing about Australia right now is that it's summer, so the weather is pretty much perfect. [Chuckles] What do you think?",
        "Liam: Actually, I'm pretty intrigued.",
        "Ivy: Well, if you want it to happen, don't tell Steffy that her cousin ivy came up with this idea.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Steffy: It's the co-C.E.O. thing, isn't it?",
        "Thomas: Come on.",
        "Steffy: You're still upset about granddad's decision, and it's affecting everything else, including being in my wedding.",
        "Thomas: I didn't say that. I still want this happily ever after for you and Liam.",
        "Steffy: Oh, it is about me being co-C.E.O. of Forrester.",
        "Thomas: I'm not undercutting you, Steff. But you were appointed to the top slot by Quinn.",
        "Steffy: I was appointed by our grandfather, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: By his wife, who is trying to get you back together with her son. She needed an ally, somebody that she could sway over to her side, and apparently it worked. And especially looking at dad, saying how much he was thankful for her to stand up for -- for him with granddad. And this whole C.E.O. thing? Uh -- [Sighs] Dad's been C.E.O. before. He's had a proven track record.",
        "Steffy: Okay, so you're saying I'm not qualified.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] Your words, not mine.",
        "Steffy: But you think it.",
        "Brooke: Take your coffee black, right?",
        "Bill: She remembers.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] I haven't been gone that long.",
        "Bill: Well, it felt like an eternity. But I'll give you a pass since you went to visit hope.",
        "Brooke: Oh, it was so good to see her -- hearing about her friends and learning about her life.",
        "Bill: Anybody special? She involved with someone?",
        "Brooke: Not that she mentioned, anyway.",
        "Bill: Well, did she ask about us -- why we haven't tied the knot yet?",
        "Brooke: Uh, I'm pretty sure she realizes it's because I'm engaged to somebody else.",
        "Bill: [Groans]",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] I do have a tiny confession to make, though.",
        "Bill: Do you?",
        "Brooke: I know I said I went out of town to visit hope, and I did. But I also wanted to get away and clear my head, just really figure out what it is that I want out of life, what I want out of my future.",
        "Thomas: Your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 speaks for itself.",
        "Steffy: Meaning what?",
        "Thomas: Meaning your experience is strictly with the business side of fashion. When it comes to design, you've never put enough time into --",
        "Steffy: Thomas, we wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't get the company back from bill Spencer years ago.",
        "Thomas: And we're all incredibly grateful to you for that. But that was then and this is now. I don't see what qualifies you to run the company over me.",
        "Steffy: Have you even bothered looking at the expanding demographic? We have such a strong social-media presence, and we're -- we're taking on so many different markets that we never have before.",
        "Thomas: That was Wyatt's idea -- to put you out there in the first place.",
        "Steffy: Okay. What is your point?",
        "Thomas: That. That this is all completely intangible. A few months from now, this could all completely blow over. We need to stick to what made Forrester so successful in the first place -- great designs by great designers.",
        "Steffy: Like yourself.",
        "Thomas: I'm not overblowing my importance, Steff. Design is the backbone of fashion. And this designer's getting screwed by granddad, by Quinn, and now my own father.",
        "Liam: You know, Steffy and I aren't the only ones taking the plunge again. Brooke and Ridge are getting re-married, too.",
        "Ivy: Mm. Well, do they have any plans?",
        "Liam: I'M...not sure, but I can't imagine them dragging it out.",
        "Ivy: Oh, my God.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Ivy: Well, what if they got married in Australia, too?",
        "Liam: Well -- [Laughs] What? Like a double wedding?",
        "Ivy: I even have the perfect location for them -- the Sydney harbor bridge.",
        "Liam: Why is that the perfect location?",
        "Ivy: Brooke and Ridge -- I just -- I merged their names together.",
        "Liam: Oh, \"bridge?\" Bridge! Right.",
        "Ivy: I mean, come on! What could be more romantic than saying -- to vowing to have and to hold on the most iconic bridge in --",
        "Liam: Okay, ivy, ivy, ivy. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Can we, like, slow down just a little bit? 'Cause, um, you practically got the four of us married already.",
        "Ivy: Why? Do you not like the idea of being on the bridge and the whole Australian vibe?",
        "Liam: I do. I do. I just -- okay, my dad's gonna be there. Um, and if it's a double wedding, that means that he has to watch Brooke marry Ridge, and that would be a gut punch to him.",
        "Bill: So, this trip to Europe wasn't just to see your daughter.",
        "Brooke: No. I needed some time to reflect on my life and on my future.",
        "Bill: I'm supposed to be your future.",
        "Brooke: Didn't work out that way.",
        "Bill: You're not married to Forrester yet. And maybe you don't want to be. That's what the doubt's about.",
        "Brooke: I never said I was having doubts. [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Well, isn't that what the soul searching amounts to?",
        "Brooke: I'll never forget what we shared, bill -- the closeness.",
        "Bill: The love.",
        "Brooke: Some of my best moments in my life were shared with you. It's not easy for me to just move on from that.",
        "Bill: Well, that should tell you something, don't you think?",
        "Brooke: In the past, I've followed my heart at the expense of hurting the people that I loved. So I just need to know that I'm getting it right. I need to know that in my heart... and in my head that it's right. So, that's why I needed to go away, do some self-analysis. I just want to make sure that this commitment I make is something I want for the rest of my life.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Okay, can we just, like, take a breath for a moment so we don't say something we regret later?",
        "Thomas: Why? So you can pat me on the head and tell me I'm an invaluable part of this company, so I don't rock the boat?",
        "Steffy: You are invaluable.",
        "Thomas: Then why do I feel so invisible to the rest of you?",
        "Steffy: No, you're not. You're important to the future of Forrester creations.",
        "Thomas: So, I keep designing for Forrester. I keep designing for you. It's a dead-end road for me. Why don't I just start up my own company?",
        "Steffy: Where is this coming from?",
        "Thomas: If sally spectra's doing it, why can't I?",
        "Steffy: What are you talking about?",
        "Thomas: I'm talking about sally spectra's great niece, also named sally. Weird. Ran into her. She's trying to resuscitate the old spectra brand, not there was ever much of one, considering old sally was a kook. But she's doing it. I've got to respect her for trying.",
        "Steffy: I --",
        "Pam: Okay, kiddos. Put a lid on it. You have got to see this.",
        "Steffy: No, no, pam. We're in the middle of something right now.",
        "Pam: Hold on.",
        "Steffy: Can you not -- wha--",
        "Reporter: Sally spectra, we're curious. What's behind the veil?",
        "Thomas: That's her. That's sally spectra.",
        "Pam: In front of the old spectra building, no less. [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: What is she doing?",
        "Pam: Apparently she called a press conference, but only one reporter showed up. [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Okay, okay. Turn it up. Turn it up. I want to hear it.",
        "Pam: All right. All right.",
        "Sally: Sure, yes, we've been out of the game for a while, but, no, no, I don't think the press turnout is any indicator of our relevance. Hey, hey! Hey! Right here. You, my friend, are getting a once-in-a-lifetime spectra exclusive. That is right, folks. I, sally spectra, am here to announce that I have single-handedly stopped the wrecking ball. Spectra fashions is back and better than ever, baby.",
        "Steffy: Are you serious?",
        "Sally: So, forget about those other, overpriced, froufrou fashion houses. Spectra fashions is here to bring true style and panache back to downtown L.A.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God.",
        "Sally: We are going back to our roots. Today, flying high once again -- the iconic spectra logo.",
        "Pam: [Gasps]",
        "Steffy: Oh!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Sally: We're good. We're good. No, it's --",
        "Reporter: You're okay?",
        "Sally: Yeah, it's -- just let it go. Fine. Fine.",
        "Steffy: [Laughing] Are you kidding me?",
        "[Laughter continues]",
        "Ivy: Well, bill's gonna have to come to terms with this wedding eventually.",
        "Liam: Says who?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] Is bill still really holding out hope for Brooke?",
        "Liam: Okay. You know the part in the wedding ceremony when the minister says, \"is there anybody who has a reason why these two should not be married?\"",
        "Ivy: Oh, boy.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I can picture my old man standing up with a list of a hundred reasons why Brooke shouldn't marry Ridge and should marry him instead.",
        "Ivy: Well, that's not gonna go down very well with Ridge. Look, maybe you're underestimating your dad. Maybe he'll take the higher road and he'll admit that he and Brooke just aren't met to be.",
        "Liam: Ha! You will never hear those words coming out of my father's mouth. Trust me. My dad is not giving up on Brooke.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: You know, I get it, Brooke. I do. The time away to gain perspective makes all kinds of sense, especially with everything happening so fast. You know, one day, you're about to marry me, and the next thing you know, uh, Forrester puts an engagement ring on your finger.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: It's like being on an emotional roller coaster.",
        "Brooke: Exactly. That's exactly how it felt.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, now that you've been away, how do you feel? [Sighs] Still committing to Forrester.",
        "Brooke: I know that's not what you're hoping to hear.",
        "Bill: No. No, it's not. But it doesn't mean I'm giving up on us. I'm not. There's no wedding band on your finger. I realize that you have, again, bought in to Forrester's promises of commitment, the same promises he made a thousand times before and has broken a thousand times before. I would do anything to spare you from living that again. Just say the word and I will.",
        "Steffy: Well, the apple doesn't fall far from that tree. Sally spectra 2.0 -- a disaster like her aunt.",
        "Thomas: Come on, Steff. Give her a break. She's fighting for her place in the fashion world. That's not an easy thing to do.",
        "Steffy: Just like you're fighting for your place at our family's company?",
        "Thomas: Wow. Nice. Yeah, Steff. I should be C.E.O. I have paid my dues over and over again.",
        "Steffy: I have worked my way from the bottom up. I know every aspect of this company's operation. Yeah, I don't design pretty dresses, but that doesn't --",
        "Thomas: See, right there. That's it. You don't get it.",
        "Steffy: No, I get -- I get that you feel like you're being unfairly passed over.",
        "Thomas: No, no. What's unfair is that you were given a-a job -- the C.E.O. Position -- as bait to win you over. It had nothing to do with your experience or what you could offer the company. You got a job that I've been working my entire life towards. And I'm just supposed to sit back and be okay with it. [Chuckles] The family's falling apart.",
        "Steffy: Thomas, can you --",
        "Thomas: Done.",
        "Steffy: Thomas. [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Look, I know how relentless your dad can be, but there are some things that even \"dollar\" bill Spencer can't control.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah? Well, don't tell him that. 'Cause not when it comes to Brooke. She's everything to him, ivy. And that's why I wouldn't bet against my dad. Brooke may just end up with him after all.",
        "Brooke: I understand why you feel the way you do about Ridge, but --",
        "Bill: You know, honestly, uh... I need to take some responsibility, too, for what happened. I blamed Ridge, and I-I still blame Ridge, but I never should have let him get to me, not on our wedding day. I mean, there you were, standing before me, looking so beautiful, ready to be my wife, and that's all that should have mattered, not some desperate, pathetic attempt by Forrester to take you away from me. But I stopped the wedding, and that was a mistake -- the worst mistake of my life. I never should have left you at the altar. It wasn't your fault. You didn't invite Ridge there. My damn ego and my pride went into overdrive. And I lost you. Well, I'm not gonna lose you for the rest of my life. Because you are my life. I love you, Brooke. I will never stop loving you, and I don't think you'll ever stop loving me. And that's not my ego talking. That's my heart. It's what I know. It's what I believe. And I think you believe it, too. So, say yes. Say yes, Brooke. Say you'll come back to me."
