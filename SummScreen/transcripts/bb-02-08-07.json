        "Phoebe: You should laugh in my face and walk away.",
        "Rick: And what would that do for me?",
        "Phoebe: Keep you from wasting your time on a crazy person. You should go back to Paris.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, you made a couple of wrong guesses, but you do have me pegged. I am a lowlife.",
        "Phoebe: No, you're not. You're one of the most --",
        "Rick: What are we arguing about here?",
        "Phoebe: I don't know. At least it's not about paper shredders that could eat a whole house.",
        "Rick: Do you need rescuing?",
        "Phoebe: Shane's all right, I just --",
        "Rick: Should we tell him you're not feeling well?",
        "Phoebe: I'm not. I'm very nauseous.",
        "Rick: Very good. Let's go. Look's like he left. Did he stick you with the tab?",
        "Phoebe: No, we never finished ordering.",
        "Rick: Do you need a ride home? It's his loss. It's his loss. We can stay and eat if you'd like?",
        "Phoebe: No thanks, I'm not that hungry.",
        "Rick: Good. I vote for the ride home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Since when are you the knight in shining armor for the Douglas family? My mother is my cross to bear, not yours.",
        "Eric: No, she's been Pam's cross to bear all these years, and it's not been fair.",
        "Stephanie: You know what, I don't understand. Why don't you want Pam to go back to her life in Chicago?",
        "Eric: What, alone? You didn't see how she blossomed while she was here. She was tagging along with Bridget to volunteer at the hospital. She was cooking, she was the life of the party --",
        "Stephanie: All right, Eric. Pam knows that she can visit here any time she wants. We don't need to move both of them out here lock, stock and barrel.",
        "Eric: Time is not on Ann's side.",
        "Stephanie: I had a right to know what you were planning.",
        "Eric: Well, now you do. The decision's been made, and I made it. Now you're going to go inside right now and you're going to welcome your mother to LA.",
        "Stephanie: You've placed me in an untenable position, and I want you to know I resent it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: What do you come up with on golden?",
        "Storm: I'm telling you, Nick, I don't know if this guys a recluse, a gangster or if he even exists.",
        "Nick: Well, somebody's got to run the east coast retail chain.",
        "Storm: Have a look for yourself. Harvey golden could be an aka, a dummy DBA. Guys this rich, they appear and disappear whenever they want. All right, listen, it's time. You sure you don't want to be there?",
        "Nick: I want to meet with this guy. I want you handle it.",
        "Storm: All right. Well, I may hint that we'll ask the sec to investigate. The guys doing business, they don't like that kind of stuff.",
        "Nick: Just do what you've got to do.",
        "Storm: All right. I'll see you later. Hey, sis.",
        "Brooke: Hey. What?",
        "Storm: Good to see you. You look fantastic. I've got to run. I'll talk to you later, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Wait -- 'evening, bill.",
        "Bartender: The usual? A steak au poivre, no salt, and crab louie, for Ms. Logan. To go. She's waiting.",
        "Brooke: My brother used to have more to say to me than \"Gotta run.\" Oh, I'm not interested in your top secret documents, either.",
        "Nick: I'll tell you what. I'll show you mine, you show me yours.",
        "Brooke: Careful what you wish for, Captain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You know you're going to get your feet wet.",
        "Phoebe: I like the smell after it rains.",
        "Rick: Will you be okay?",
        "Phoebe: Will I hang myself from the rhododendron? No.",
        "Rick: Nobody likes being dumped.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, well, sometimes you give the other person no choice. I mean, sometimes they don't even realize they dumped you because in reality, it was just all in your head, and you sort of just dumped yourself. I wish it were five years from now.",
        "Rick: Why?",
        "Phoebe: I wouldn't be so immature, hopefully.",
        "Rick: What difference would that make?",
        "Phoebe: You know what? Probably none. I mean, that's how it always is. I go around a few weeks and even months sometimes thinking my whole life's going to change, and it never does. I don't live in London. I don't have a boyfriend. All I have is a job I don't even know how to do.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, if I may, I think you might be taking this a little too hard. In my honest opinion, I don't think Shane McGrath is worth it.",
        "Phoebe: No, I only went out with Shane to see if you would care. Which, you know, why would you? And then on top of that, I had to make a complete fool out of myself, which I'm just doing again now. I didn't want you to leave before, but I do now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: So, Ann, what do you think?",
        "Ann: Well, if the condo's as nice as these pictures --",
        "Eric: I'll take you to see it first thing in the morning. As for tonight, you can stay in the guesthouse. I think you'll find it very comfortable.",
        "Ann: Well, then, get my bags, dear.",
        "Eric: No, no, I'll get the bags. Right now, I think there's something Stephanie wants to say to you.",
        "Stephanie: Well, keeping in mind, mother, what you said earlier -- that it would've been impolite for you not to at least come out and take a look around -- welcome to Los Angeles.",
        "Ann: Oh, sweetheart, you don't how much it means to me to hear those words. The thought of living close to my two girls, and my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildern, and my handsome son-in-law -- if it were only that simple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Is this how you have your meals, or just your tequila?",
        "Nick: You know, you've got to be committed when you're new in the fashion industry.",
        "Brooke: Seriously, is it all working out the way that you had hoped?",
        "Nick: Seriously, is it all working out the way you hoped? In answer to your question, I'd say the personalities are different, I'm not quite used to the fashion business. But I've got a well-oiled machine internationally. I got to thank you son for that. I like him.",
        "Brooke: He's very competent.",
        "Nick: He came to see me. Twice. Don't worry, I'm not going to try to steal him from you, although I'd like to. He's aboveboard, an honorable guy.",
        "Brooke: Yes, he is. And anybody who can't see that --",
        "Nick: Who can't see that?",
        "Brooke: We've all been on edge.",
        "Nick: I'm not on edge. I got a little question for you to chew on. How many men is ridge friendly with?",
        "Brooke: He and Rick are too much alike, is all.",
        "Nick: No, they're not. They're nothing alike. You watch that soon-to-be husband in a crowd, see who gravitates toward him, see who gravitates away from him. He's not a man's man. He's a woman's man.",
        "Brooke: And what terrible fate does that lead to?",
        "Nick: I think you know that answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ann: Santa Monica is far away, isn't it? How will I get around?",
        "Stephanie: Around where?",
        "Ann: I suppose I could buy a car --",
        "Pam: Mother, you haven't driven in years.",
        "Ann: I still have my driver's license.",
        "Stephanie: To the lasting shame of the state of Illinois.",
        "Eric: What Stephanie's referring to is that about 80% of the driving here in L.A. Is on the freeway. And you may not be used to that.",
        "Ann: In Chicago, if I wanted to go somewhere, it wasn't far. I could call a cab. Do that out here and I'd be in the poorhouse.",
        "Eric: What would make it easier for you, Ann?",
        "Ann: Well, you people think nothing of flitting around in limousines, like you're all movie stars or secret agents. I'd feel like a lost soul living that way. Still, if it means that much to you, I could try it.",
        "Eric: All right. You'll have a car and a driver at your disposal.",
        "Stephanie: Eric!",
        "Eric: Is there anything else?",
        "Ann: People dress so differently here. They'll be laughing at my dowdy old clothes. I wouldn't want you to be ashamed of me.",
        "Eric: Clothes, we know. Clothes, you will have.",
        "Stephanie: Mother, you are absolutely outrageous.",
        "Eric: An entire new wardrobe, if you like. Anything else?",
        "Ann: Since you ask -- I would die -- absolutely die -- if you put me in one of your fashion shows.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my God!",
        "Ann: Not that I'd refuse, you've been so good to me -- and I have been told I have a certain flair -- for what, I don't know.",
        "Eric: Ann, I think I understand you perfectly.",
        "Ann: Well, Pammy, it looks like I'm going to have a new home. And you'll be free of me at last. Almost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You want me to leave this minute?",
        "Phoebe: No.",
        "Rick: Tomorrow? Next week? Next month?",
        "Phoebe: No. Can't you want and not want the same thing?",
        "Rick: Only if it's important.",
        "Phoebe: How do you think of me?",
        "Rick: Is this a trick question?",
        "Phoebe: I mean, do you see me like I'm a kid?",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Phoebe: Like a basket case?",
        "Rick: No. I see you -- I think of you many different ways. I mean, Phoebe, you've never not been in my life, you know? When I was away, I heard your name 20 times a year. 50 times when your sister went overboard in the Bahamas.",
        "Phoebe: No, see, nothing dramatic like that ever happens to me.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Phoebe: I mean, not that I wish it would.",
        "Rick: I think the Shane situation was dramatic, right?",
        "Phoebe: Well, people thought so. But, I mean, I did almost cut his fingers off.",
        "Rick: Well, there you go.",
        "Phoebe: It just seems weird to me how these big and sometimes terrible things keep happening all around me, and just not to me.",
        "Rick: I take it you put me in that category?",
        "Phoebe: You won't happen to me either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: They're still cracking crab in the kitchen.",
        "Brooke: Oh, that's fine, thanks. So I'm sure you heard about Thorne and Taylor.",
        "Nick: I did. How's Phoebe?",
        "Brooke: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Nick: She's staying with you, isn't she?",
        "Brooke: You knew Taylor was out of town? Oh, yes, of course you did.",
        "Nick: How are she and Rick getting along?",
        "Brooke: Too well to suit her father.",
        "Nick: Well, boys will be boys.",
        "Brooke: Rick didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Nick: I wasn't referring to Rick.",
        "Brooke: You know, the things that Ridge says -- the way that he thinks -- I mean, it may look like the situation with Rick and Phoebe is romantic, if you didn't know any better. Just the other night, they were out in the garden. And Rick was pointing at the stars. It reminded me of the night that you and I were on the island.",
        "Nick: Island -- I don't quite remember.",
        "Brooke: Yes, you were teaching me the constellations. Remember? And you were pretending you knew what they were, but you didn't, really. And I forgot all of them, anyways. But I will never forget that night. If I said something wrong, I'm sorry.",
        "Nick: You've got nothing to be sorry about.",
        "Brooke: Nick, it's okay to remember the good times.",
        "Nick: It's probably a lot easier while you're having good times with somebody else, now, isn't it? [Cell phone rings] I got to take this.",
        "Brooke: Nick Marone. So much you have to take.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Nick: How'd it go?",
        "Storm: Oh, man, I was bad. I hated me. But, I got a meeting set up for you tomorrow. With Harvey Golden himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: I made you your martini.",
        "Eric: Thank you.",
        "Pam: Eric -- Eric, I just --",
        "Eric: Oh, no. Oh, no. I was afraid this might happen.",
        "Pam: Afraid?",
        "Eric: Look, Pam, if I've overstepped, I'm sorry, really. You don't have to live here. You can live with Ann, you can live any place you want.",
        "Pam: Eric, no, don't say you're sorry. Don't say you're -- no one has ever done anything for me like this in my life.",
        "Eric: I did this for my whole family. I really did. And for you.",
        "Pam: Nights when I couldn't sleep, I'd stare at the ceiling and think of all the lives I could have had, how did I end up with this one? But you can't think that way for too long, so you trick yourself. You make up these little things to try to convince yourself that you're really happy. Or, at least, okay. I thought, \"I'll just cook and I'll clean and quietly follow mother to the grave.\" Or maybe beat her there. But now, everything seems possible. All those things that I thought I could never have -- they may still be right out there waiting for me.",
        "Eric: I'm just sorry it took so long, that's all.",
        "Pam: No, I'm not. It's perfect the way it happened. It couldn't have happened any better way. Especially coming from you.",
        "Eric: Well, part of this is selfish on my part.",
        "Pam: That may be the nicest thing anyone ever said to me. Eric, you and Stephanie are not going to regret having done this for me, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You need to stop thinking that you know what I'm thinking.",
        "Phoebe: What else am I supposed to do? You never tell me what you're thinking.",
        "Rick: Come here.",
        "Phoebe: Why?",
        "Rick: Come here. All right, how do I think of you? I think of you to a certain point and no further.",
        "Phoebe: Okay.",
        "Rick: I think you're funny, both when you want to be and when you don't. I think you're beautiful. But that gets us to a point a little too fast. I think you have an adorable inferiority complex. And you think that people are smarter than you, more sophisticated, more accomplished. But the fact of the matter is, we're all faking it, and you don't have to.",
        "Phoebe: You're not faking it.",
        "Rick: Sure I am.",
        "Phoebe: Now?",
        "Rick: Maybe a little.",
        "Phoebe: Saying things you don't mean?",
        "Rick: Meaning things I'm not saying.",
        "Phoebe: Do you remember that Christmas that you stole my Barbie and made me cry?",
        "Rick: Vaguely, yes, I do.",
        "Phoebe: Yes, you decapitated her.",
        "Rick: Oh, I did. I'm sorry.",
        "Phoebe: You wrapped grandmother's pearls around her and had her stirring in a bowl of soup. I thought you rocked.",
        "Rick: You did?",
        "Phoebe: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rick: I had Stephanie's pearls in a bowl of soup.",
        "Phoebe: I told her Steffy did it.",
        "Rick: Nice."
