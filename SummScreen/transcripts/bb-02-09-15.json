    "Recap": [
        "Liam says good God what they have been through so they will always love each other. Steffy says she is IN love with him. She can not be in this unless they are in this together. He says they will but not like that. She says she will not be part of it. She will not sell our her family just so he can play hero for his new girlfriend. Aly shows Oliver her shoe designs. He quips to let her make him a pair in size 12 and that will get Rick's attention. Ivy starts to go upstairs and Aly stops her by saying Maya and Rick are upstairs so probably needs some privacy. Eric calls and Rick lies to him and says everything is fine and he has everything under control. Rick and Maya both laugh when Rick calls down and cons Aly into bringing them some ice cream. They laugh at her again when Rick makes Aly come into the room with them in bed to hand them the ice cream. Then Rick dismisses her when she wants to show him the shoe sketch saying he will do it later. She wants to hurl. Caroline tells Ridge to show her more when he says how beautiful she is. They clasp hands and she looks down at her wedding ring and takes if off and says it is time.",
        "Liam tells Steffy that he came to her because he can not imagine him running FC without her. They argue. He says she will run the company but he will be there to support her. He reminds her that FC is falling apart at the seams and someone needs to get in there and stitch it back together. She can inspire them with her attitude, her energy and talent. And she's a fighter so just please say yes. They can make it happen. She will be the most bad-ass this industry has ever seen. She says she wants that more than anything but she can not do that after the future they had planned and now he has moved on not only from Hope but is with Ivy now. Yet her love has not stopped. Caroline tells Ridge that she likes the sketch of her but she thought he wanted to paint her. She drops her towel. He takes his brush and some of his fingers and dips them in the paint and does make bold lines over her neck and upper torso. He kisses her. Then he lays her on the couch and she finger-paints his neck and chest. He says all his life he wanted to paint beauty and now he just wants to appreciate it. He says she is fantastical. Liam muses to Steffy that all those memories are just as important to him and he will not forget them. It's good to remember. She says yes but that is not why he called her. And for her it seemed like all of this happened yesterday. He is glad she was honest with him. They hug and she wishes him good luck. She walks out and silently cries."

        "Steffy: No, Liam, no. I won't sell out my family just so you can play hero for your new girlfriend. I can't be in this unless we're in it together.",
        "Liam: We will be. Just...not like that.",
        "Steffy: I told myself I wouldn't do this. I told myself. I told myself.",

        "Liam: Steffy, I came to you with this, because I can't imagine running Forrester without you. I mean, how many times did we talk about this, what you could do as CEO, all the things you could change?",
        "Steffy: Not the things that matter most to me!",
        "Liam: You deserve this. You could finally have control.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] Something to call my own? No. No, this is a mistake. I had one rotten conversation with my father, and I thought this was a good idea. No, this is not for me, Liam. I can't.",
        "Liam: Oh, come on! No, Steffy! You could end the chaos! You could get Forrester back on track, and I can help you do that!",
        "Steffy: If I sell my stock to Spencer?! No!",

        "Rick: Uh, rocky road?",
        "Aly: Maybe. But, Rick, listen, um, since I have you, I-I've been working on some new shoe designs, and --",
        "Rick: You know, it's funny that you mention that. I've actually been considering some of your ideas for the line.",
        "Aly: You have?",

        "Steffy: I wish I could. I wish I could forget everything and say yes.",
        "Liam: Forrester is falling apart at the seams, and somebody needs to get in there and stitch it back together, Steffy. You have a passion and an instinct for this business. And make no mistake -- you are the leader Forrester needs. You're tough, you're smart, and you have never been intimidated by anyone or anything, including my father. You inspire people. You do. You inspire them with your attitude and your energy and everything that you've been through. And you're a fighter. That's the thing -- you're a fighter. And there's nothing you can't do. Say yes. Steffy, please say yes. Do this with me. I promise you we can make it happen, and you will be the most bad-ass CEO this industry has ever seen.",

        "Liam: You're ready for this.",
        "Steffy: CEO, maybe. But the rest of it? Getting off the elevator, walking down the hall, picking up the phone and hearing your voice. I have to be realistic. We were a great team, Liam, but it is different now. You have Ivy.",
        "Liam: Shouldn't stop you from taking the job.",
        "Steffy: All these memories.",
        "Liam: But if -- if we focus on the future...",
        "Steffy: We were gonna have a family. That was our future. Till it all fell apart. And now you're asking me to come back here and run Forrester Creations with you.",
        "Liam: If that's not what you want...",
        "Steffy: No, I do want it. I want it more than anything. But I can't. I can't do it, Liam.",

        "Ridge: Hey, next time I'm gonna paint you a little bit more abstract.",
        "Caroline: You want to paint me again?",
        "Ridge: I do. Want to paint you and draw you, want to sculpt you. You know, all my life, I just wanted to create beauty. Now all I want to do is appreciate it, savor it. Every moment. My muse. But you're more than that. You are...fantastical.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I'll never forget what we shared, you know. All those memories -- just as important to me. It's good to remember.",
        "Steffy: It is. But it's not why you called me, is it? I can't run Forrester Creations with you. My dad still wants to be CEO, and it can still happen when Rick's contract expires.",
        "Liam: A year from now.",
        "Steffy: Maybe quicker than you think. Being here with you, it just feels like it was... it was yesterday. Look, I'm sorry I, uh, I unloaded all this emotion on you.",
        "Liam: No, don't, don't, don't. I'm grateful you could be honest with me.",
        "Steffy: I should -- I should go, yeah.",
