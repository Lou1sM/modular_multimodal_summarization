        "Liam is shocked when Katie tells him in Bill's diminished role she is making him VP of Spencer Publications. He's beyond honored and grateful but it came unexpectedly. He thinks Katie has done a good job and the company is back on track. But he says he did come over last night when he got her memo and it looked like something was going on with her and Ridge so he didn't interrupt. She explains it was all innocent. They'd been to the park earlier and Ridge and RJ are both good with Will, so they have gotten close. Liam says it looked a little more than that and he was just surprised to see her alone with Ridge. He wonders if Brooke knows. Katie says there is nothing for her to know. She is not going to lie; she likes Ridge a lot. It's been a long time since she's had this much fun but it's not real. She is friends, just friends with Ridge. And she knows Ridge will be back with Brooke soon. So she's be a super hypocrite to think of anything more. Liam says he doesn't see it that way, two different circumstances.",
        "At Forrester, Brooke informs the group that Hope probably won't be in today. She was out late with Wyatt last night. Ridge thought she was still with Liam. Rick says that is the way relationships go, on today, gone tomorrow as he glances at Maya. All question Carter and Maya when they are gonna set their date. Carter turns to Maya and says he is asking that same question so it's up to Maya. She stammers that she needs to go see Oliver and will be back to him later. Ridge even offers the Forrester Mansion for the event. Oliver shows her the latest photo shoot and tells her that she looks amazing. She tells him that she has to say something. It's about the kiss. It shouldn't have happened and it won't again. Oliver says okay but it was just one kiss, it felt right at the moment and if she wants to blame anyone she can blame him. She says she should have stopped it so she blames herself as well. She says she loves her fiance and she doesn't intend to let him down. She hopes this won't keep her and Oliver from working together. He agrees. She gets a text from Carter to join her in the steam room. She says they should do this more often. Rick asks Brooke about Ridge. She says she has no doubt that he will come back and they will be a family again. He just needs to get over her and Bill and she will gain his trust and respect again. Ridge goes to see Katie at her request. She tells him about Liam seeing them last night. She admits that she really has enjoyed his company. He understands her more than anyone else but they can't continue like this. He asks her to spell it out; what does she want of him. She says she won't do to her sister what Brooke did to her. She and Ridge must stop seeing each other. This is the end."

        "Ridge: I'm not attacking you. I think it's a good idea. It's just it's not gonna be easy to execute.",
        "Rick: Honestly, we're just playing around with ideas right now.",
        "Brooke: Eric said we don't have to make a decision till next week.",
        "Rick: Are we gonna wait for Hope, or should we keep going?",
        "Brooke: I don't think she's coming. She was out late last night with Wyatt.",
        "Maya: They're officially dating now, right?",
        "Ridge: Wait, wait, wait. I thought she was with Liam. I-I'm confused now.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I think it's safe to say that she's officially moved on from Liam.",
        "Carter: I imagine Liam must be bummed.",
        "Rick: That's how relationships go. Sometimes they just run their course. You know, speaking of relationships... when are we gonna get a wedding invitation?",
        "Brooke: Yes! You two have been engaged for months.",
        "Carter: Well, uh, you'll have to ask her. She's the one who can't agree on when and where.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Rick: Really? Okay, let's pick a date right now. March, April, May? I mean, springtime is beautiful.",
        "Carter: You heard them, Babe. You're gonna have to marry me sometime. Might as well lock it down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thank you for coming.",
        "Liam: Yeah. No problem.",
        "Katie: I decided to work from home today. Will was kind of fussy this morning.",
        "Liam: Is he okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, he's fine. He's taking a nap.",
        "Liam: So, I got your memo about the announcement.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm sure you must be wondering what that's about. I'm actually a little surprised I didn't hear from you last night. Can I get you some coffee?",
        "Liam: Uh, no, I'm okay. I'm -- I'm good.",
        "Katie: Okay, well... as you know, things aren't so great with Bill and me. And since I have been running the company, his role at the company has been diminished. I really want to build a new team, people that I can totally trust, people who are creative, who have a lot of experience so we can learn from each other. And that's why I feel that you would be better suited as vice president of Spencer Publications.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Look, I couldn't be more excited to plan a wedding, book a place, send out the invitations.",
        "Ridge: If you need a wedding planner, talk to this one. She's put together more weddings --",
        "Rick: Than you could even count.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Has it really been that many? [Laughs] I had no idea.",
        "Carter: See that, Babe? We have a whole wedding committee here willing to help.",
        "Maya: Thank you, all of you. You will be the first ones to know. But in the meantime, I actually have to go meet with Oliver. He, uh, he wants me to go look at some proofs.",
        "Ridge: Why don't you forget about Oliver? I'll make this easy for you. Why don't you have the wedding at the Forrester estate?",
        "Carter: Are you serious?",
        "Ridge: Sure. It's yours if you want it.",
        "Carter: Babe, you know how I feel. What are we waiting for?",
        "Maya: It's a wonderful idea. Let's talk about it after my meeting, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I was not expecting that. [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: Well, you've paid your dues. And you've learned the ropes from Bill, and I think you deserve this, and I'm sure Bill would agree.",
        "Liam: I mean, Katie, I'm beyond honored and grateful, and I know it's been a rough couple of months and you've been killing it as C.E.O.",
        "Katie: Thank you. It was definitely a rough start.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, we knew that there was gonna be that initial panic when my dad left his position. But I think you've more than proven your leadership, and look, the company's back on track.",
        "Katie: Well, I appreciate that. Your commitment to the company and to me. I really do.",
        "Liam: You kidding me? I'm grateful for the opportunity. Thank you. I'm excited.",
        "Katie: Thank you for accepting the job.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Uh, okay. One thing. When I got your memo, kind of thought you were gonna fire me.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: So I came over here last night.",
        "Katie: You did?",
        "Liam: Yeah, and I didn't want to interrupt, but... you know, you were with Ridge, and it kind of looked like something was going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brandon: Thanks again for letting me hang until Pam's available.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, no problem. So you guys know each other from the shelter?",
        "Brandon: Yep. In honor of Tiny, she's been volunteering and helping find homes for rescue pets.",
        "Oliver: And she found homes for Rudy and Awdi?",
        "Brandon: Yep. These guys are going home today with Thad in receiving.",
        "Oliver: Aw, did you hear that? [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: Hey, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: Oh.",
        "Brandon: All right, I'll let you get back to work.",
        "Oliver: Here you go.",
        "Brandon: Thanks again, Oliver. See you around.",
        "Oliver: See you, man.",
        "Maya: Hello! Hi! Oh, my gosh. Cuteness overload. What are they doing here?",
        "Oliver: It's gotcha day for the rescues.",
        "Maya: Oh, I've heard of them. They do amazing work.",
        "Oliver: I want to show you these. They're gorgeous. I'm thinking these two for the homepage and these we use for print. You look amazing.",
        "Maya: Look... Oliver, I'm sorry. I have to say something. The kiss was a mistake. I shouldn't have let it happen, and we can't do it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Maya's a lovely young woman. I hope you'll consider getting married at the house.",
        "Carter: Well, I doubt it'll be hard talking her into it. I think she was just overwhelmed by the offer. She's not used to people being so kind to her.",
        "Ridge: We'll have to change that.",
        "Carter: You already have.",
        "Rick: I've got to run. I have got things to do downstairs.",
        "Carter: Yeah, I'm heading down, too.",
        "Ridge: You guys keep up the good work.",
        "Brooke: All that wedding talk...",
        "Ridge: How did I know you were gonna say that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I-I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.",
        "Maya: I know. We work together. We have a good business relationship. I'm engaged to Carter. This, that kiss -- it was just a bad idea.",
        "Oliver: I know. I know. I-I get it.",
        "Maya: Good. Because I'm really in love with my fianc\u00e9, and I'm not gonna let him down.",
        "Oliver: Look, Maya, it was just one kiss. Should it have happened? Probably not. We felt something in the moment. And, you know, if you need someone to blame, blame me. I initiated it, right? You shouldn't feel guilty.",
        "Maya: But I do.",
        "Oliver: That's 'cause you're an amazing woman.",
        "Maya: Thanks for understanding.",
        "Oliver: No matter what, this has to continue. W-we've done some amazing work together.",
        "Maya: Yeah, we have. I really...I really like working with you, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: I hope this doesn't affect our relationship.",
        "Maya: Me too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I mean, not that it's any of my business. I'm not judging you at all. I just, uh, didn't expect to see you and Ridge alone together.",
        "Katie: Okay, I can imagine what it must have looked like. But it was nothing. We're just friends. That's it. Just friends.",
        "Liam: Okay, well, does Brooke know?",
        "Katie: There's nothing to know. But I guess I would appreciate it if you didn't say anything to anyone.",
        "Liam: No worries. I won't. I promise.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Liam: I just, uh... I didn't realize you and Ridge were so close -- such close friends.",
        "Katie: Liam...",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Ridge has been very supportive. We get together every now and then with the kids.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that's cool.",
        "Katie: For instance, we went to the park the other day. R.J. is really great with Will and so is Ridge. But his life is with Brooke. I know that. I mean, they share a child together. I have a child with your father.",
        "Liam: Ah, yeah, but you're not getting back together with my dad.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Liam: What is your plan, exactly, that you're gonna live your life alone?",
        "Katie: [Sighs] There are a lot of men out there, Liam.",
        "Liam: You know what I think? I think you have real feelings for Ridge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: That better be my fianc\u00e9e coming through that door.",
        "Maya: You got my text.",
        "Carter: I did. You don't remember the last time we were in here.",
        "Maya: I thought I'd surprise you.",
        "Carter: Glad you did.",
        "Maya: We should do this more often.",
        "Carter: I'd like that very much.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] Me too.",
        "Carter: You know what else I'd like?",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Carter: To marry you.",
        "Maya: That's funny. I was -- I was just thinking the same thing.",
        "Carter: So... can you believe that Ridge offered to let us get married at the Forrester estate?",
        "Maya: I know.",
        "Carter: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: Crazy generous, right?",
        "Carter: I know. I think we should go for it. What do you say?",
        "Maya: I say... we have our whole lives to talk. But I can't talk and kiss at the same time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Maybe I'm wrong. But I was kind of picking up on a vibe. I mean, it looked like stuff was about to go down.",
        "Katie: Okay. All right. Listen. I care about him. I do. I'm not gonna lie about that. And he has been so... nice to me. I mean, he understands this whole mess from my point of view. He gets it, probably better than anyone, but that's it, Liam. That's it. I would be beyond a hypocrite if I let anything develop between the two of us.",
        "Liam: What, because of what Brooke did to you?",
        "Katie: Yes!",
        "Liam: I don't think that makes you a hypocrite, Katie. Totally different situation.",
        "Katie: There is no situation.",
        "Liam: You know what I mean.",
        "Katie: I'm texting Ridge. I need to talk to him. I need to make sure that we're on the same page about this.",
        "Liam: Listen, Katie, I'm not telling you what to do, but I do think you deserve to be happy. I mean, I love my dad, but I hate the way that he turned on you, and you and Ridge -- honestly, I can't think of anything wrong with that.",
        "Katie: That's not who I am. I'm not Brooke.",
        "Liam: Katie, you can't help the way you feel.",
        "Katie: Liam, it has been so long since I have just been able to relax and have fun. I got caught up in a fantasy. But it's not real. Nothing can ever happen between Ridge and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I just can't help thinking about our wedding.",
        "Ridge: Which one?",
        "Brooke: All of them. But most especially the one that hasn't happened yet.",
        "Ridge: Ah. But there's no pressure.",
        "Brooke: What? Me pressure you? I could never.",
        "Ridge: Have you talked to our son?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. He wants you to move home, too.",
        "Ridge: What he wants is to leave Ojai and go to school in L.A.",
        "Brooke: Uh-huh. And that will happen eventually. But I think we need a little more time.",
        "Ridge: And why is that? What are we waiting for?",
        "Brooke: There's some things we need to work out first.",
        "Ridge: But this is something completely different. I want my son home. I miss him.",
        "Brooke: Yes, I want him home, too. But I think it'd be healthier for R.J. if he comes home and both of his parents are living under the same roof.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I got to deal with something.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Ridge: So we'll talk later.",
        "Brooke: Yep. I'll be here.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ahh ahh-ahh-ahh ahh I took a minute, had to sit right back 'cause I'm givin' lovin' with my heart attached and I never knew that it could be like that loving you the way I do so whether morning, noon, or night whenever, baby, I'm feeling all right and I'm staying with you long after lovin' is through morning, noon, and night hey more than a lover, baby, you're my friend got to keep on giving, baby, till the end and it hurts so much when I'm without your lips morning, noon, and night",
        "Rick: What's going on with you two? I thought you were getting back together.",
        "Brooke: Of course, we are. It's only a matter of time before Ridge realizes how important it is for us to be a family again.",
        "Rick: When he came back, I thought for sure you guys would be picking up where you left off.",
        "Brooke: Well, a lot has happened this last year.",
        "Rick: Ridge never expected you and Bill.",
        "Brooke: Nobody did. Not even me.",
        "Rick: Is that completely over?",
        "Brooke: Absolutely.",
        "Rick: Then what is he waiting for?",
        "Brooke: I just have to earn his trust and his respect again. And I'm doing that. It's gonna happen. He is going to come home to me and to our family. There's one thing I'm sure of. I will always be the love of Ridge's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thank you for coming.",
        "Ridge: I got your text. Is everything okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I-I didn't mean to worry you. I just needed to talk to you.",
        "Ridge: Did something happen?",
        "Katie: Liam came by earlier. Apparently he stopped by last night, and he saw us together.",
        "Ridge: Why didn't he say anything?",
        "Katie: He didn't want to intrude, so he left. But he asked me about it. He asked if there was anything going on between us.",
        "Ridge: What did you say?",
        "Katie: I told the truth. I said no. I meant what I said last night. We've both been hurt, and it's only natural that we would find a connection in each other. You understand what I've been through better than anyone. But that's all it is.",
        "Ridge: So you don't want me to care about you.",
        "Katie: Liam said that he wouldn't say anything. He said that no one has to know anything.",
        "Ridge: Has to know what? We didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Katie: I know. But -- but we could have.",
        "Ridge: We didn't.",
        "Katie: My sister's in love with you, Ridge. I'm not gonna do to her what she did to me.",
        "Ridge: What are you asking me to do?",
        "Katie: I know that you're a compassionate person. And I have loved spending time with you and R.J., but I don't want to feel like I'm keeping a secret. And thank you for being so nice to me. These feelings scare me, Ridge. I don't know what to do with them. So I can't see you anymore. This has to be the end."
