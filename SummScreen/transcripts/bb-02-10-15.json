    "Recap": [
        "Ridge wakes up alone the next morning and finds Caroline bringing him coffee and a kiss in bed. Donna asks Brooke if she is missing something. The last she heard Ridge was with Caroline and yet Brooke is saying this big old house won't be that big before long. She is getting Ridge back today. Bill says he just hopes Wyatt can talk Rick into giving his job back, they need him on the inside. Wyatt goes to see Rick who is very dismissive. He tells Wyatt that he does not work there any more and he has no time for quitters. Wyatt says he was not thinking the other day and he really needs to stay here. He is coming to him man to man to ask for another chance. Rick says no, he should not have respected him. Then Rick asks how badly does he want this job he can prove it by getting down on his knees and begging. Brooke says she would hardly call this relationship with Caroline and Ridge a relationship, more like a fling. And yes she would like to show her a thing or two. Brooke comes down in a sexy pool outfit and Donna says WOW, it's obvious she is not going to work. Brooke says it is for tall, dark and handsome. She calls Ridge and says it is not urgent but it is important and she'd like to see him at the house right away. He tells Caroline he doesn't think this will take long. Bill says even if Wyatt comes through there is still Ridge. He does not think there is any way Steffy will go behind her father's back. They discuss Steffy being CEO and running the show but she does not want to do this with Liam involved. And what is Caroline thinking getting all fluttery by Forrester. Bill says it is weird that both Katie and Caroline were sucked in by Ridge. Bill says no one is going to fire at a Spencer woman and get away with it so their target is still Rick.",
        "Wyatt repeats it \u0096 Rick wants him on his knees and beg for his job. Rick chuckles and says he is not that sadistic and he was only kidding. Wyatt says every word he said the other day was true and Rick is CEO so he had every right to call him out on it. He even over-reacted and lost his cool and he is sorry. He will now prove to him his loyalty and he gives him his word please give him another shot. Ridge takes notice of what Brooke is wearing as she invites him in and says they don't have to be in any hurry as she knows he has nothing planned today and he will have so much fun he won't want to leave. Rick asks if he lets Wyatt back in, what will he get out of it. Wyatt says he has a lot of contacts all over the world with his PR, but if he wants him to be in janitorial or shipping that will be fine. He will never disrespect Rick again. Rick says he can not have his employees against him, but he is re- hired. But if he is ever subordinate with him again he will be cleaning every bathroom in this place. Caroline stops in and sees Liam. He asks about Ridge and she says it is very good, they are officially a couple. Brooke tells Ridge just to hear her out about this whole Rick and Maya mess and him and Caroline. Ridge says he does not need another lecture. She states that they all just need to function as a team and it could start with her and Ridge. This thing with Caroline is just an infatuation and it won't last. Brooke says she and Ridge will find themselves back together. She proposes they go down by the pool and relax. Liam questions Caroline if she thinks being with Ridge is a good thing. He lists a long list of things why not like being married previously to her aunt, a long history with Brooke and then hooked up with Katie. She gets it that he is not a fan. Liam says he comes with baggage. She says she is a big girl and she won't be hurt. She's curious but she is not concerned except that Ridge is over at Brooke's now. Brooke says this is not about Caroline; somehow they got off track and that should not have happened. He had feelings for her and she is ready to move on with her life so he can stay today as long as he likes. Wyatt drops back in on Liam and Caroline seems suspicious but she leaves. Wyatt says Rick did not make it easy but he is in. He wanted to knock him out of his CEO office but as long as he behaves they are back in business. He says Rick looked so smug that he can't wait to see his face when they bring him down."

        "Donna: I know, but with Hope gone and...you're single... all alone in this big, big place?",
        "Brooke: I won't be for long.",
        "Donna: What are you talking about?",
        "Brooke: It's only a matter of time before Ridge moves back in.",
        "Donna: [Laughing] Wait a minute. Am -- am I missing something? I-I thought Ridge was with Caroline.",
        "Brooke: I'm getting him back...today.",
        "Donna: Wha\u0097",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: This is just phase one, Liam. We got a lot of hoops to jump through.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but Wyatt has to get his job back, 'cause if we're gonna get control of Forrester, then it's crucial that we have somebody on the inside.",
        "Bill: Agreed. Your brother's our best chance to do that.",
        "Liam: Ohh, God. This has to work.",
        "Bill: Hey, son.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Bill: How many cups of coffee you had today?",
        "Liam: Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna -- we're gonna get rid of Rick, right? Then we're gonna get control of the company...somehow, some way, and -- I don't know.",
        "Bill: Well, uh, let's just hope that Wyatt can convince Rick to give him his job back.",
        "Liam: Well, if this is gonna work, Wyatt's gonna have to pull off the performance of a lifetime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Got a minute?",
        "Rick: You lost, little boy? Want me to call your mommy?",
        "Wyatt: Um, I really need to speak with you.",
        "Rick: No. You don't work here anymore.",
        "Wyatt: Which is exactly what I want to talk to you about.",
        "Rick: I am busy! So run along before I call security.",
        "Wyatt: I just need a minute. I promise I won't take up too much of your time.",
        "Rick: You see, here's the thing, Spencer. I don't have time for quitters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Even if your brother comes through, Eric and Ridge are still --",
        "Liam: The majority shareholders. No, I-I-I got that. I got that, but with -- we got your shares, right? With Steffy on our side, we get hers plus Thomas', and then we just work out the rest later.",
        "Bill: Well, is Steffy on board?",
        "Liam: Not quite yet.",
        "Bill: Right. She's a Forrester, Liam. You really think she's gonna betray her family?",
        "Liam: I don't know. She can't stand Rick.",
        "Bill: And what about Captain Couture? There's no way Steffy's gonna go behind her father's back.",
        "Liam: She's not exactly thrilled with Ridge, either.",
        "Bill: That may be so. But I'm willing to bet she's staying loyal to daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Look, I said some things that I regret.",
        "Rick: Did you, now?",
        "Wyatt: I really need to be here right now, Rick. I-I-I really need my job.",
        "Rick: You should've thought about that before you disrespected me and stormed out of here.",
        "Wyatt: I know, and you're right. I wasn't thinking. I didn't consider how important it is to stay here. But I know now. And that's why I'm here. I'm coming to you, man to man, to ask for another chance. Come on, man. What do you say?",
        "Rick: How bad do you want this job?",
        "Wyatt: More than anything?",
        "Rick: Then prove it.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Rick: Get on your knees and beg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: You want Ridge back? Since when?",
        "Brooke: I've loved Ridge forever.",
        "Donna: Sure, you -- you spent decades together, but I-I thought you were over him.",
        "Brooke: Does anyone ever get over Ridge Forrester?",
        "Donna: Does this have anything to do with his relationship with Caroline?",
        "Brooke: [Scoffs] I would hardly call it a relationship. It's more like a fling.",
        "Donna: Which you're about to put an end to. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: I want Ridge again. And, yes, I do want to teach Caroline a lesson.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So, what do you think?",
        "Caroline: Mm, it's not bad.",
        "Ridge: I could've done better, but my subject kept moving around. Wouldn't sit still.",
        "Caroline: Oh! Really? Is that -- is that how you remember it?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: I remember everything about last night -- every breath, every kiss... every stroke of the brush. Hey, look at this. You still got paint on you.",
        "Caroline: [Squeals, laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Wow. I guess you're not gonna be going to work like that. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: There's something I need to take care of.",

        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Oh, great. Hello.",
        "Brooke: Hi! It's me. I really need to see you.",
        "Ridge: Uh, it's kind of a busy day today.",
        "Brooke: I know, but it's important. I mean, it's nothing urgent, but I do need to talk to you.",
        "Ridge: Right now?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, right now. Please, just come over to the house.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Okay. I'll be there.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Ridge: That was Brooke. She needs to see me.",
        "Caroline: Is everything okay?",
        "Ridge: I'm sure everything's fine, but she wants to talk to me about something. Hopefully, it won't take long. I'll, uh, call you after. Mm.",
        "Caroline: [Giggles]",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You haven't done a lot of sales, Liam. Did you sell it well enough?",
        "Liam: I'm not selling her a car, Dad. This is her legacy. It's her family business. The -- the one thing I can't be doing is pressuring her. I mean, Hell, I-I understand why she's so uneasy about the whole thing.",
        "Bill: Did you tell her that if she sells us her shares, she would be C.E.O. of Forrester, running the show?",
        "Liam: Yes. She just... isn't ready to go into business with me.",
        "Bill: There's not going to be a business if Rick drives it off a cliff. And I'm telling you right now, that's exactly what's gonna happen.",
        "Liam: What? You don't need to tell me that.",
        "Bill: Ah, this whole situation is just pissing me off. And it's only getting worse. I mean, what is Caroline thinking, getting all fluttery over Forrester?!",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, you'll be thrilled to know that's not slowing down anytime soon. It appears that Caroline is getting even more swept up in Ridge.",
        "Bill: It's bad enough that Katie got suckered in by that predator, but my niece?",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know it's weird, but -- but I'm more concerned about Rick right now.",
        "Bill: Little dictator. Napoleon wannabe. Shooting a gun at Caroline?!",
        "Liam: Yeah, the guy should be in jail.",
        "Bill: I don't give a damn if it was a warning shot, if he missed on purpose. Nobody -- nobody does that to a Spencer and gets away with it, especially a Spencer woman.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, or, you know, Ivy.",
        "Bill: We're gonna get him.",
        "Liam: I sure hope Wyatt's doing okay. Can't imagine what Rick is putting him through right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Uh... [Chuckles] You want me to get on my knees and beg for my job back?",
        "Rick: It's the only way I'll know...how much it means to you.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] I, uh, um...",
        "Rick: [Laughs] I'm messing with you! [Chuckling] Come on. Where's your sense of humor?",
        "Wyatt: Oh. That was a -- that was a joke?",
        "Rick: You really think I'd make you beg? I'm not that sadistic.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles nervously] Right. Uh...okay, so, um... so, a-are -- are we good, then? I mean, can I -- can I get back to work?",
        "Rick: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You really don't think I'd let you off the hook that easy.",
        "Wyatt: Look. You were right. Every word you said to me the other day, I-I-I deserved it. I have been gone for way too long. I neglected my work, and I totally screwed up. There is no excuse for that. And you're the C.E.O., you know? You're -- you're the man in charge. You had every right to call me out on it.",
        "Rick: I had to hold you accountable.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I know! A-and -- and... I overreacted. Um, I lost my cool, and I am -- I am sorry. And if you give me the opportunity, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of this company. I will prove to you my loyalty to Forrester Creations and everything that it stands for. I give you my word. Please, Rick. Just give me another shot, man.",

        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Brooke: Hi!",
        "Ridge: Hi. It's...it's nice to see you.",
        "Brooke: Good to see you. Come in! Come on.",
        "Ridge: [Clears throat]",
        "Brooke: Glad you're here. I hope you don't have any pressing plans today, because you're gonna have so much fun here, you're never gonna want to leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You keep telling me how sorry you are, how much you need this job. What's in it for me? If I let you back in, what do I get out of it?",
        "Wyatt: I have proven myself. With the exception of the last little while, I-I am damn good at P.R. I have a lot of contacts all over the world, and I think it's the best for this company.",
        "Rick: Is that right?",
        "Wyatt: Yes. [Sighs] All right. Look. I'll do whatever you want at this point. You want me in shipping? Fine. Do you want me in janitorial? Whatever. I just -- I really need to be here right now.",
        "Rick: If I let you back in, doesn't that make me look like a pushover?",
        "Wyatt: No! No, not at all! No!",
        "Rick: Even after the way you disrespected me?",
        "Wyatt: It -- it was totally unacceptable, and it will never happen again.",
        "Rick: You're damn right it won't happen again. Do I have your word?",
        "Wyatt: Absolutely.",
        "Rick: You know, I'm your boss, Wyatt. I can't have my employees working against me.",
        "Wyatt: I know. Of course not.",
        "Rick: Well, as long as we're clear. You're rehired.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: If you're ever insubordinate to me again, you will be cleaning every bathroom in this place.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Liam?",
        "Liam: Caroline. What are you -- what are you doing here?",
        "Caroline: I'm sorry. I-I probably should have called first.",
        "Liam: Are you kidding me? Your last name is on the door. You're always welcome here.",
        "Caroline: I'm just avoiding going in to work.",
        "Liam: How...are things over there?",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Rick is on a power trip still. I mean, he's just making everything difficult. In fact, I think he actually shrank my parking spot, 'cause my car barely fit in there this morning. So, basically, I'm avoiding him at all costs.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, I don't blame you after the gun incident. But, hey, look on the bright side! You'll be divorced in no time.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. That can't happen soon enough.",
        "Liam: So... I mean, w-what's up with you and Ridge? I mean, are you guys -- you guys good?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. We are...very good.",
        "Liam: So...I mean, like, would you say it's serious?",
        "Caroline: At this point, I can confidently say that Ridge and I are...officially a couple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'm still trying to process everything that happened while I was away. You and Katie breaking up, Rick's marriage falling apart, Rick and Maya living together --",
        "Ridge: Why did you want to see me?",
        "Brooke: This whole thing with Caroline, this attraction she has towards you --",
        "Ridge: Come on. I don't need another lecture. I'm tired.",
        "Brooke: I know, just -- just hear me out.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Brooke: I really want there to be peace between you and my son.",
        "Ridge: I don't know if that's gonna happen, the way he's reacting to things and the way he's acting.",
        "Brooke: But it's important that we all work together as a family, for the company.",
        "Ridge: Well, then, you should talk to your son.",
        "Brooke: I will, I will talk to him. I'm gonna get him to back off.",
        "Ridge: Good luck with that.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] We just need to function as a team, and it all starts with you and me.",
        "Ridge: You and me, we -- we never had a problem. We -- we're fine. No issues. We coexist.",
        "Brooke: I really want something more. And this thing that you have with Caroline -- it's just an infatuation.",
        "Ridge: Is it?",
        "Brooke: Yes, it is, and it's not gonna last. You know that. And you and I always find our way back to each other.",
        "Ridge: Come on, Brooke. I'm -- I just came here 'cause you wanted to talk to me.",
        "Brooke: Okay. You know what? Forget about that. [Chuckles] Let's just... let's just enjoy ourselves. Let's go down to the pool, relax, have a good day. It's beautiful outside. What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Are you sure that's a good thing?",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Liam: You and Ridge.",
        "Caroline: Because he's older?",
        "Liam: Well, that, and because he's...Ridge. I mean, he was -- he was married to your mother-in-law.",
        "Caroline: Future ex-mother-in-law.",
        "Liam: And he was married to your aunt, and he just got out of a committed relationship with Katie, and he's Rick's mortal enemy, and -- do I have to keep doing this?",
        "Caroline: Okay. I get it. Fine. All right. You just won't be invited to the wedding. That's fine.",
        "Liam: What? No. W-wait a minute. You guys are not -- you're not getting --",
        "Caroline: I'm kidding! You -- really?! I am not engaged. We're not even, like -- that's so far away.",
        "Liam: Caroline, you almost gave me a heart attack.",
        "Caroline: Okay, really? Is it that bad?",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: What's so wrong with Ridge? Okay -- okay, don't. Don't do the whole list again. I-I get it. You're not a fan of my relationship.",
        "Liam: I'm just -- Ridge comes with a little bit of baggage. He's not the most reliable or committed guy. And I don't want you to get hurt.",
        "Caroline: Okay, well, I-I appreciate the cousin-ly concern, but you don't have to worry about me. I'm a big girl, okay? So I'm not gonna let anything or anyone rattle me, not one bit.",
        "Liam: You sure about that?",
        "Caroline: Okay. I-I'm -- I'm not worried about it. I mean, I'm not -- I'm not even concerned. It's just... I'm... curious?",
        "Liam: About what?",
        "Caroline: Brooke called Ridge and asked him to come over, and he's over there now at her house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: What are we doing here? Where's all this coming from?",
        "Brooke: Can't be too much of a surprise.",
        "Ridge: I guess not. All this because you don't want me to be with Caroline?",
        "Brooke: No. [Sighs] No, that is not what motivates me.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: It's because of our feelings, because of our history, Ridge -- everything that we've been together. Our memories? And our beautiful son.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Somehow, we got off-track, and we never should have let that happen.",
        "Ridge: We both moved on.",
        "Brooke: Not really.",
        "Ridge: Mm, no, really. Being with Spencer -- that's moving on.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Bill was a mistake. But he's back with Katie now, and they're very happy. I'm happy for them.",
        "Ridge: I really thought she was smarter than that. I really did.",
        "Brooke: You know what? If they can reunite, anybody can. Do I really have to spell this out for you? I mean, do you not have any feelings for me at all?",
        "Ridge: Don't say that. You know how I feel about -- what do you want me to say?",
        "Brooke: Okay, don't say anything, okay? Just spend the day with me. Stay as long as you want. I am ready to move on with my life... with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Should I be worried?",
        "Liam: Um, well, I --",
        "Wyatt: Hey, I -- hi.",
        "Caroline: Hi to you. You jog here?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm? No. Why? Why? [Chuckles nervously]",
        "Caroline: 'Cause you seem kind of intense, and sweating.",
        "Liam: Oh. No. You know, I almost forgot. You know what it is? We had a...",
        "Both: Meeting.",
        "Liam: So...",
        "Wyatt: Meeting.",
        "Caroline: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: All right. Fine. It's boy stuff.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Boy stuff.",
        "Caroline: Far be it from me to interrupt all your boy stuff. Talk about cars or -- I don't know what you guys talk about. I don't care. All right!",
        "Liam: Hey, Caroline, uh, are you cool?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. Fine.",
        "Liam: So, what happened? What did Rick say?",
        "Wyatt: I'm in.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Wyatt: I got my job back.",
        "Liam: If you are messing with me right now, I'm gonna punch you, I swear.",
        "Wyatt: No, Rick didn't make it easy, though, trust me.",
        "Liam: Yes! Yes! Way to go.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you don't even know the half of it. I can't even tell you how much I wanted to knock him out in his stupid C.E.O. office.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah, trust me, I know, but -- but w-what did he say?",
        "Wyatt: Well, after a lot of groveling and practically licking his loafers...",
        "Liam: Ugh.",
        "Wyatt: ...He agreed to let me come back.",
        "Liam: Like, no strings? No probationary period? You're just -- you're in?",
        "Wyatt: As long as I behave, I'm back in business. Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yes.",
