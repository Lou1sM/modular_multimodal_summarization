        "Brooke coos to Ridge that it's just the two of them. Surely he hasn't forgotten. He puts his hands on her waist and says no, he hasn't forgotten anything. She gives him a choice \u0096out to the pool or up to their bedroom. She gives him a hug when he says he remembers it all and he is in love and she has been amazing since she got back from Italy, so full of energy. But he has changed too. She asks how. He says when he said he was in love, he did not mean her. He is in love with Caroline. She says no, she will not believe that. That is Rick's wife and she is half Ridge's age. She reminds him that he was under a lot of stress so she understands Caroline helping him. He says no, it wasn't just that. It sounds weird but it is almost like they are of one mind; it's nice. He assures her that he never meant to hurt her but he is now committed to Caroline. She accuses him of payback by being with Bill's niece. Ridge admits that Brooke being with Bill made his stomach turn but that is not what led him to Caroline. Brooke goes on and on about their long history and Caroline is young and inexperienced and can not understand Ridge like she does. This seems more like a mid life crisis. And Caroline helped him get his drawing back so he feels like he owes her. But that is not love; that is dependency. Ridge tells her that he is sorry. Whatever magic they had all those years is gone and he is moving on and thinks she should do the same. He says he will always love her and be there for her and their son but he just wants to start a new chapter in his life. And he wants to do that with Caroline. Pam chides Donna for being late back from lunch. Just as Caroline walks by the door and hears them and stops she hears Donna say she was at Brooke's and get this Brooke wants Ridge back. She walks on in and says she does not believe for a moment that Ridge is going to leave her for Brooke. They share something no matter how many other young girls have been in love with the great Ridge Forrester. Both try to tell Caroline that Ridge and Brooke may have their silly little escapades but eventually they do get back together. It's inevitable and is going to happen again so she better prepare herself.",
        "Quinn bemoans to Deacon that there is no work at FC since Ivy stole her job. She asks how he spent his day and he replies the same old. She inquires even with Brooke back in town. He reminds her that he is not interested in Brooke. She is nothing like strong and independent like Quinn. She says Brooke is about two steps away from the nuthouse and she has been there too but Brooke rises above it and conquers it whereas Quinn can't. He hugs her when she complains the fact that Wyatt wants nothing to do with her and Hope outright hates her and the baby they lost because of her. Deacon changes his mind and tells Quinn that he won't play poker with the guys tonight and he will stay in with her. She says she is not in a funk but she wants him to know that he does bring a lot to the table, more than he knows. Pam and Donna tell Caroline to go home and she will feel better in the morning. Ridge calls as she is leaving and asks her to meet him at the loft. She arrives and says the real thing is here. He tells her about Brooke wanting him back but he's made a commitment to another. She muses only if that is what he truly wants. He kisses her. Brooke wanders around and heads to the bar and pours herself a glass of vodka and lets it soothe her throat. She pours another and flops down in the comfy chair by the fireplace thinking about the men in her life and silently cries."

        "Brooke: Could be the way it was for so long -- just the two of us.",
        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "Brooke: Have you forgotten?",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles] No. No. I remember everything, so that's a ridiculous question.",
        "Brooke: So, what do you say? Out to the pool? Or...up to the bedroom? Our bedroom.",
        "Pam: Mm-hmm, well --",
        "Donna: Sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.",
        "Pam: I-I'll tell Rick you were looking for him. [Scoffs] Come here. Come here. Come on. That was one heck of a long lunch you took. [Sighs]",
        "Donna: What did I miss? Another gunshot, perhaps?",
        "Pam: No, what you missed was a whole pile of work which I ended up doing. Here. Where were you?",
        "Donna: At Brooke's.",
        "Pam: So...what's going on over there?",
        "Donna: Get this -- Brooke wants Ridge back.",
        "Deacon: Break time?",
        "Quinn: Yes. From my 19th game of solitaire.",
        "Deacon: You want a beer?",
        "Quinn: No. And there is no work, not since Ivy Forrester stole my job.",
        "Deacon: Well, you know, maybe she needs an assistant, you know? I mean, I hear they're really bus--",
        "Quinn: Really? You're gonna say that? Really?",
        "Deacon: I-I'm sorry. Just take this and hit me over the head.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. No.",
        "Deacon: Idiot.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] So... how have you spent your day?",
        "Deacon: Same old.",
        "Quinn: Really? Even with Brooke back in town?",
        "Deacon: She looks good, doesn't she?",
        "Quinn: You're taunting me?",
        "Deacon: Hey, I'm just trying to make a point.",
        "Quinn: Which is...?",
        "Deacon: She looks great. Italy can do that.",
        "Quinn: Okay, I'm not sure I'm interested in the rest of this point you're trying to make.",
        "Deacon: And yet I only have eyes for one woman.",
        "Quinn: You sure about that?",
        "Deacon: Baby, you and me are good together, all right? I couldn't give that up if I wanted to. Come here. Besides, Brooke's got her sights set on Ridge.",
        "Pam: You're saying that Brooke is making a play for Ridge?",
        "Donna: She's teaching Caroline a lesson.",
        "Pam: Oh. So she doesn't really love him, she's just doesn't want Caroline to get him?",
        "Donna: Yeah, you know it's never really that simple with the two of them.",
        "Pam: I know. Ridge and Brooke.",
        "Donna: Yeah, the itch that never goes away. They're gonna end up back together again.",
        "Pam: You're probably right. I mean, everybody in the family believes that. [Chuckles]",
        "Donna: Yeah, except -- Caroline.",
        "Caroline: Except for me. Is that what you were gonna say?",
        "Donna: Uh, well...you know, you're not really part of the family.",
        "Pam: I mean, Rick is starting the divorce proceedings.",
        "Caroline: No, you're right, donna. You're right. But I don't believe for a moment that Ridge is gonna leave me for Brooke.",
        "Brooke: And it is and always will be our bedroom, our place, our home.",
        "Ridge: There's a lifetime of memories here.",
        "Brooke: Yes. And there can be so many more.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, our children are gonna see to that.",
        "Brooke: So...tell me that you're in love this very moment.",
        "Ridge: I am, Brooke. I am in love.",
        "Quinn: You think he'll fall for it?",
        "Quinn: You think he'll fall for it?",
        "Deacon: You're talking about the guy who took off to Abu Dhabi to try and stop her wedding.",
        "Quinn: It's amazing everything always falls into place for that woman.",
        "Deacon: Hey, make no mistake about it -- Brooke's a hot mess a lot of the time.",
        "Quinn: Is that the attraction, then? Wh-what, men want to rescue her?",
        "Deacon: Babe, she's nothing like you. I mean, she's not strong, she's not independent.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Oh, come on.",
        "Deacon: What? I say something wrong?",
        "Quinn: No, it's nothing.",
        "Deacon: It's something.",
        "Quinn: It's just... I look at Brooke, and, yeah, she's two steps away from the nuthouse, and...I have been there. It's a horrible feeling. But she -- she just -- she always rises above it. She conquers it, whereas I --",
        "Deacon: Hey. Listen to me. You're doing fine.",
        "Quinn: Am I, Deacon? My son wants nothing to do with me. My daughter-in-law? She -- she out and out hates me. And a baby that -- that was supposed to be my grandchild isn't because of me.",
        "Deacon: Come here.",
        "Donna: You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into.",
        "Caroline: I know how Ridge and I feel about each other. Beyond that --",
        "Pam: Wait, sweetheart. You can't believe that you're the first young woman who's taken a shine to Ridge Forrester.",
        "Caroline: It's more than that, Pam.",
        "Pam: You don't think that he's in love with you, do you? [Sighing] Oh, boy.",
        "Caroline: We share something that none of you could ever understand.",
        "Donna: And what exactly is that?",
        "Caroline: We create together. I mean, you've seen our work. You don't think it just shows up on the easel by magic, do you?",
        "Donna: It's good. It is, but Ridge has that affect on young designers.",
        "Caroline: It's more than good, and you know that.",
        "Donna: Okay. You're totally infatuated. I-I get it. But you also know my sister's history with Ridge.",
        "Caroline: With all due respect, Brooke has history with a lot of men.",
        "Donna: But it always comes back to Ridge, doesn't it? I mean, they have their silly little escapades, and they eventually find their way back to each other.",
        "Pam: It happens every time.",
        "Donna: And it's gonna happen this time, too. You've got to be prepared for that, Caroline. It's inevitable.",
        "Ridge: I will always be here for you.",
        "Brooke: Yes, the last few years have been so crazy, but we got through it.",
        "Ridge: Yes, we did.",
        "Brooke: And now we can start a new life.",
        "Ridge: We can. There's a whole new chapter, right? Look at us. Huh? Look at you. You went to Italy, and you came back -- you're just -- you're this empowered woman. What happened?",
        "Brooke: Really? [Chuckles] I guess I ate too much pasta.",
        "Ridge: Uh, no. I don't -- you -- you look -- you look great. [Sighs] But I changed, too.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure in some ways, you haven't changed.",
        "Ridge: No. Uh, when I said I was in love with someone, I... I didn't mean you.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. I-I'm in love with Caroline?",
        "Brooke: Caroline? No. No.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, I-I--",
        "Brooke: That is Rick's wife.",
        "Ridge: Ex-wife.",
        "Brooke: She's half your age.",
        "Ridge: I know how old she is. It's -- it -- I didn't mean for that to happen. It just happened.",
        "Brooke: Look, I-I know that you've been under a lot of stress at work. And you turned to somebody else for support. That's understandable.",
        "Ridge: Please. That's what it is at all. With Caroline, it just -- it -- I know it sounds weird, but it almost seems like we're of one mind. It's -- it's nice.",
        "Brooke: At the drawing board, Ridge. Life doesn't take place at an easel.",
        "Ridge: But that part of my life did take place at an easel, and I don't want to deny it anymore. I never meant to hurt you. You -- you got to know that, but I'm committed to Caroline.",
        "Brooke: You're making a huge mistake.",
        "Ridge: We've both made a few of those, haven't we?",
        "Brooke: Bill. Is that what this is about?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Brooke: You still seem upset.",
        "Ridge: Well, for once, this has nothing to do with Mr. Spencer.",
        "Brooke: You're with his niece, so of course this is payback.",
        "Ridge: You know, you and him together -- that made my stomach turn. But that's not what led me to Caroline.",
        "Brooke: Caroline doesn't understand you the way I do.",
        "Ridge: Oh, Brooke, you don't understand me.",
        "Brooke: It's true, Ridge. We've shared so much together. Caroline is young. She is inexperienced. I mean, to me, this looks like a mid-life crisis.",
        "Ridge: The biggest crisis in the middle of my life was being dumped out of a helicopter because I was trying to save you from Spencer. [Sighs] I tried so hard to get my life back, and you know who helped me? Caroline. Otherwise, I'd still be there.",
        "Brooke: So, you owe her.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I do. Indeed.",
        "Brooke: I see. So you're indebted to her. That's not love, Ridge. That's dependency.",
        "Ridge: What happened to us, huh? Whatever we had, whatever magic we had all those years, it's gone now. I'm moving on, and you should do the same.",
        "Brooke: I've tried to move on, Ridge, and I haven't really been able to do that. I've always counted on you.",
        "Ridge: And you can. You can always count on me. I'm here...as your friend.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Friend. That just sounds so distant. And I don't want to be distant from you.",
        "Ridge: You won't be. I mean, we're living in the same town, we have a son together.",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Hey. I will always love you, but I just want to start a new chapter in my life. And I want to do that with Caroline.",
        "Brooke: [Scoffs] [Sighs]",
        "Donna: I know it's disappointing.",
        "Caroline: It's not inevitable, donna.",
        "Pam: Nothing is for certain in life, Caroline, but Ridge and Brooke come darn close.",
        "Caroline: They haven't even been together for a year. She's been busy chasing after my uncle.",
        "Donna: And Ridge was engaged to Katie, but that's all done now. They're -- they're gonna end up back together again. It happens every time.",
        "Caroline: I-I-I'm not gonna listen to this. Ridge and I know what we have.",
        "Donna: What you have is a solid working relationship. I suggest you keep it that way.",
        "Pam: If Brooke will even allow that.",
        "Donna: You know, maybe things will work out with Rick.",
        "Caroline: I don't want Rick. And he sure as hell doesn't want me. [Sighs]",
        "Donna: Why don't you just go home and get some rest? You'll feel better in the morning.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Caroline: Hi.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Can you meet me at the loft?",
        "Caroline: Uh, when?",
        "Ridge: Now.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, is -- is everything okay?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Yeah, just get there as soon as you can.",
        "Caroline: Okay.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Deacon: Here. I think you need this.",
        "Quinn: I never used to drink beer.",
        "Deacon: See? Now, there's another good reason why I'm good for you.",
        "Quinn: Mm.",
        "Deacon: Mm.",
        "Quinn: You going out tonight?",
        "Deacon: I was thinking of maybe checking in with the boys. Uh, I heard a little something about a card game.",
        "Quinn: Well...",
        "Deacon: What? Uh, di-did you have something planned for us?",
        "Quinn: With you?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. Well, no. You -- you, me, you know, us together.",
        "Quinn: No. No. Go ahead.",
        "Deacon: I don't know. I think maybe you need a little company.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] No, Deacon. Come on. I've had years without company.",
        "Deacon: Those days are gone forever.",
        "Quinn: Are they?",
        "Deacon: You're still worried about Brooke.",
        "Quinn: No. [Sighs] No, I'm worried about me.",
        "Deacon: What about you?",
        "Quinn: I'm on a bit of a losing streak.",
        "Deacon: You got me.",
        "Quinn: I suppose I do.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] You kind of say it like it's a consolation prize.",
        "Quinn: No. I'm sorry. It's not. You go out tonight and you -- you go have fun. Win a lot of money. It's not like I'm filling the coffers.",
        "Deacon: What are you gonna do?",
        "Quinn: I don't know. I don't need a babysitter, Deacon.",
        "Deacon: No, but I think you do need your man. I think I'm staying in tonight.",
        "Deacon: So, what do you want to do?",
        "Quinn: Whatever.",
        "Deacon: Okay, well, I'll tell you what we're not gonna do. That. Come on, babe. You're in a funk. Talk to me.",
        "Quinn: I am not in a funk. I just want to make things right with -- with Wyatt and hope, and I want to get my business back on track.",
        "Deacon: That's a tall order.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You know, Deacon, someone like me -- this point in my life, I should have more to show for it.",
        "Deacon: No nest egg?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Not even a broken shell.",
        "Deacon: Family?",
        "Quinn: None that want to own up to it.",
        "Deacon: You got nothing.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. I got nothing.",
        "Deacon: Except for one thing. You got a guy that's gonna stick around.",
        "Quinn: And what's in it for you?",
        "Deacon: I mean, I can't expect much. I'm not bringing much to the table.",
        "Quinn: No. No, you bring a lot to the table. More than you know.",
        "Deacon: Really?",
        "Quinn: Truly."
