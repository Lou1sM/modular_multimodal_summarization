But, he sees sorrow in Jackie's eyes when he speaks of distribution. He's wanted in the showroom so he has to leave Jackie with Stephanie as she walks in. Actually the only thing she wants to hear from Jackie is goodbye. Phoebe tells Ridge to let it go, he doesn't have to worry about her and Rick. Brooke doesn't appreciate Stephanie's worries either.

        "Stephanie: Rick needs to be reined in. If you don't do it, someone else will.",
        "Brooke: My son hasn't done anything wrong.",
        "Stephanie: Ridge is right. You just don't get it. Those two are becoming interested in one another. Does it surprise you really that Ridge would be concerned about something like that? Or do you think it's charming -- a grown man interested in his teenage stepsister?",
        "Brooke: Oh, God, don't make it sound that way!",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's the reality of the situation, isn't it? And if you can't see it or understand it, then I have to be concerned about the level of intelligence that I'm dealing with here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I came here to make a deal. Is it gonna happen or not?",
        "Golden: That depends on how motivated you are.",
        "Nick: I wouldn't be here if I wasn't motivated, Mr. Golden. I want your company.",
        "Golden: You need my company, Nick. Without my stores, you can't squeeze Forrester Originals out of the haute couture market.",
        "Nick: What's your price?",
        "Golden: Oh, I'm not sure you'll be willing to pay the price I'm asking. I've already signed the papers.",
        "Nick: Steep.",
        "Golden: Too steep?",
        "Nick: I want my lawyer to look at this.",
        "Golden: That won't be necessary. There is, however, one stipulation to this contract, Mr. Marone. If you sign, you will owe me.",
        "Nick: Owe you what?",
        "Golden: Whatever I want. Whenever I want it.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Nick: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Sidekick: Your finger, please.",
        "Nick: What?",
        "Sidekick: Put your finger on the device.",
        "Nick: Why would you want my fingerprint?",
        "Sidekick: Security.",
        "Nick: Are we finished?",
        "Golden: Yes, Nick. For now.",
        "Nick: I look forward to our next conversation.",
        "Golden: Nick -- I'll be in touch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I want the gowns to be perfect. I want them to be the stars of the show. Jackie, hi.",
        "Jackie: Hi.",
        "Eric: Come in, come in. Thank you. Thanks so much.",
        "Jackie: Should I close my eyes?",
        "Eric: No. I want you to see. Take a look. What do you think?",
        "Jackie: Wow. It's beautiful.",
        "Eric: I think it's some of my best work ever.",
        "Jackie: Even though you do say so yourself.",
        "Eric: I don't normally do that. I'm usually a little superstitious about these things. I don't want to jinx it, but I'm more excited about this showing than I have been about a showing in years. I can't wait for tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You look great, sweetheart.",
        "Phoebe: Thanks, Dad. I just hope the audience thinks so.",
        "Ridge: You're going to be great.",
        "Phoebe: That's what Rick keeps telling me. Look, Dad, let it go. You don't have to worry about me and Rick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Now you're questioning my intelligence?",
        "Stephanie: I'm questioning your judgment. We have a teenage girl and a sexually experienced grown man.",
        "Brooke: Who said anything about sex? Phoebe has a crush. And Rick likes the attention.",
        "Stephanie: For all intents and purposes, Brooke, they're related.",
        "Brooke: But they're not related.",
        "Stephanie: They will be when you and Ridge get married. They'll be stepbrother and stepsister and any romantic contact would be completely inappropriate.",
        "Brooke: \"Romantic contact?\"",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it could happen.",
        "Brooke: You're acting like it already has.",
        "Stephanie: I'm not blaming them --",
        "Brooke: Because there's nothing to blame.",
        "Stephanie: Look, this is -- this is a volatile, emotional situation. He's very vulnerable, isn't he? He's just come home to live here for the first time in years. He's lost his job in Paris, his friends, his associates, and on top of it, he's angry with Ridge and me.",
        "Brooke: He enjoys spending time with Phoebe. That is all.",
        "Stephanie: Well, who wouldn't? She's a beautiful, young girl. But she's vulnerable, too. She's had a difficult year. What, dealing with her mom's problems, this fellow, Shane -- on top of it, she's starting a new job, isn't she? And Rick, of course, has been very encouraging and very supportive. They work very closely together. I don't think I have to tell you where that would lead.",
        "Brooke: Oh, great. Now it all comes back to me.",
        "Stephanie: Just because you don't see the problem, doesn't mean there isn't one.",
        "Brooke: You are going to have a problem if you keep making it seem like my son is a predator.",
        "Stephanie: I didn't say that. This isn't just about them.",
        "Brooke: Well then, what the hell is it about?",
        "Stephanie: It's about you. You and Ridge. And your marriage. What I'm trying to tell you is if you continue to turn a blind eye to this situation, I think it will affect your relationship with him. That isn't what you want. This little crush and not dealing with it, is it going to be worth that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Storm: Thank you. What's this?",
        "Nick: It's a deal with the devil, I think. I want to get the hell out of here. Mariah? Thank you, dear. Tell the pilot I'm ready to go. Good news, Mother.",
        "Jackie: You made the deal?",
        "Nick: I'm on my way back with the contracts now. I need you to organize everyone. The Jackie M signs are ready. I want them up in front of the boutiques first thing tomorrow morning. And you'll need to prepare a statement.",
        "Jackie: Nicky, you are happy about this? This is what you want?",
        "Nick: I want those people to pay for what they did to you. And tomorrow, they're going to. Forrester Originals will debut a collection and they won't be able to sell it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You can't just stick the international press in the back. They'll be insulted by that. Hey.",
        "Brooke: Phoebe, you look beautiful.",
        "Phoebe: Thank you.",
        "Rick: I have some time right now. Do you want to head out to the showroom and do some practice runs?",
        "Ridge: No. We're not done yet. Sweetie, I need you to get back into the second gown, please.",
        "Phoebe: Oh.",
        "Rick: What part of stay away from my daughter didn't you understand?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Jackie, I'm so sorry. There's a million things to do around here.",
        "Jackie: Yes, everyone seems very excited.",
        "Eric: We are.",
        "Jackie: Still, launching a new company, it's not easy. So much stress, anxiety involved.",
        "Eric: Well, if there is, I'm not feeling it.",
        "Jackie: You've accomplished a lot in a very short space of time.",
        "Eric: And we're not done yet. Believe me, this is going to be a terrific year for Forrester Originals.",
        "Jackie: Forrester Creations still has a place in your heart, doesn't it? I mean, your first triumph. Your first company. Eric, I want you to know something. There's always going to be a place for your talent there.",
        "Eric: Clarke's not working out, eh?",
        "Jackie: Well, he's a competent designer.",
        "Eric: He's going to have to be a lot more than that to compete with us.",
        "Jackie: Well, on the runway, yes. But you've been in this business long enough to know that that's just part of the battle. There's so much more that goes on behind the scenes. There's the marketing and production, distribution.",
        "Eric: Nick's not going to let Jackie M handle our collection, is he?",
        "Jackie: No. And I hear you've increased production.",
        "Eric: Yes, we have. We've doubled it. Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Jackie: Like what?",
        "Eric: Like you feel sorry for me.",
        "Jackie: Because I do. I mean, this is just not fair. You shouldn't have to be risking everything on just this one collection. If it wasn't for Stephanie --",
        "Eric: No, no, no, stop right there. I think your son had something to do with that.",
        "Jackie: Nicky was just defending my honor. And I can't fault him for that. And I don't you to, either. He is not your enemy, Eric. I just know you two could find a way to work together.",
        "Stephanie: You offering my husband a job? Darling, if you're not too busy, they would like you down in the showroom.",
        "Eric: Now?",
        "Stephanie: Yeah. We'll be fine.",
        "Eric: Maybe I should remove all sharp objects.",
        "Jackie: No, Eric. It's okay, really. I want to talk to Stephanie, anyway.",
        "Eric: All right. Good-bye.",
        "Stephanie: Actually, the only thing I'd like to hear from you is \"Good-bye.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Dad? Dad, you can go back upstairs. I can handle this.",
        "Ridge: I have to double-check a few things.",
        "Rick: Oh, hey.",
        "Phoebe: Hey.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, you gotta stay out of this. You can't keep them from seeing each other.",
        "Ridge: The hell I can't.",
        "Brooke: How? By monitoring every move Phoebe makes? Come on. If you make this a big deal, it's going to be a big deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Thorne, I can't hear -- Thorne? Thorne? Say that again. I didn't hear you. Where are you? What's going on?",
        "Thorne: I don't know what's going on, Dad. I'm standing across the street from Golden's, and it's closed.",
        "Eric: Well, maybe you're supposed to meet him at their offices.",
        "Thorne: No, Dad. They wanted to show me the in-store display for our gowns. Only there's no one here. The place is empty.",
        "Eric: Well, they're getting ready to show our collection.",
        "Thorne: Dad, it's empty. I'm telling you, something's wrong. And every time I try to call Golden's headquarters, I get an answering machine. And I haven't heard a word from Arthur or Yvette, either.",
        "Eric: Look, Thorne, they're as busy as we are, all right? Don't worry about anything. We'll straighten all this out tomorrow at the show.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Thank you.",
        "Storm: There won't be a single major buyer left at the Forresters' coming out party. I mean, according to this, you and Lauren Fenmore are the last major buyers left in the business.",
        "Nick: So the contract's good? I own Golden's operation?",
        "Storm: We can start transferring ownership to Jackie M immediately.",
        "Nick: Not a word. Not a word of this to anybody. I don't want the Forresters knowing anything about this until their gowns are out on the runway. And I want them to look out into that audience and get the shock of their lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I don't know whether you're delusional or desperate. But you would actually come all the way over here and offer my husband a job?",
        "Jackie: I offered Eric my support.",
        "Stephanie: Support? Is that a euphemism?",
        "Jackie: Why, it doesn't surprise me that you don't know the meaning of the word, seeing that you've never given him any. Not as a wife should, anyway. Unselfishly. Without judgment.",
        "Stephanie: Is that what you think Eric wants in a woman?",
        "Jackie: I think Eric wants to be appreciated.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, believe me, I appreciate my husband. And after tomorrow, the entire industry is going to appreciate him, all over again. Because he's going to take this new, young company and make an enormous success of it. And the old company is just going to be a thing of the past.",
        "Jackie: I was talking about Eric, the man. And you're talking about business, his job.",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's what you don't understand about Eric. He is his job. Or is that why you had Nicky steal Forrester Creations?",
        "Jackie: It was never my intention to hurt Eric.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, well don't worry your pretty little head about it. We'll all survive this revenge of yours. This company, the family -- they're stronger than ever. And my marriage is, too.",
        "Jackie: I don't wish your family ill, Stephanie. You know, I am not the villain here.",
        "Stephanie: You're wasting your breath.",
        "Jackie: Yeah, maybe I am.",
        "Stephanie: You know what, Jackie? My husband, after this show, is going to have the biggest success of his life -- of his career. And this company is going to be a huge hit. If you doubt that, and you doubt him for one minute, you're a bigger fool than I thought you were.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Thank you. Oh, I see. All right. All right, good. Thanks every much. All right, that's it. All right. We've been at this long enough. The lineup is perfect.",
        "Rick: It is absolutely. But you know what? Every piece is so good, it's going to be hard to create like a dramatic build up.",
        "Phoebe: One isn't more stunning than the other. They're all just stunning, period.",
        "Ridge: Then we can't go wrong, can we?",
        "Brooke: Eric, I wanted to ask you about your phone call with Thorne.",
        "Eric: Oh, he was supposed to be meeting with Harvey Golden's people today.",
        "Ridge: Is there a problem?",
        "Eric: No, just some kind of a mix-up. We'll straight it all out at the showing tomorrow. Look, listen, everybody. I know we're taking a big risk here. Everybody has the right be a little nervous, if we are. But I want everyone to remember where we were just a few short weeks ago, and everything that we've accomplished since then. And the important thing is that we've done it all as a family. Everyone has played their part. Thorne with our vendors. And Felicia with marketing. Bridget with her fresh, new ideas. Phoebe with your beauty and your enthusiasm. Thank you. And Rick, in spite of your reticence to leave your Paris digs and your international office, I'm so proud you're here. Thank you.",
        "Rick: Thanks, Dad. I love you.",
        "[Ridge clears throat]",
        "Eric: Oh, oh, that's right. Ridge, thank you for your creativity and your passion. This just proves to me what I've known for a long time. The Forresters are unbeatable.",
        "Ridge: This collection is unbeatable, Dad.",
        "Eric: And I couldn't have done it without my inspiration -- where is Stephanie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mariah: Mrs. Forrester -- Mrs. Forrester, no, you cannot go in. Mr. Marone cannot be disturbed. I'm so sorry, Mr. Marone --",
        "Nick: That's fine. Don't worry about it, Mariah.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you.",
        "Nick: Hello, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Hello, Nick. What are you up to?",
        "Nick: I was just about to fix a drink. Would you like one?",
        "Stephanie: Thank you, but no thank you. Now why would you send your mother over to our offices today? Was that in hopes of perhaps distracting Eric?",
        "Nick: Your offices? That's the last place I want my mother.",
        "Stephanie: So you didn't authorize her to offer him a job?",
        "Nick: A job here?",
        "Stephanie: Nick, please. I know you're planning something.",
        "Nick: Honest to God, Stephanie. This is the first time I have heard about a job offer.",
        "Stephanie: Would you be kind enough and do me the favor of keeping your mother away from my family and our company?",
        "Nick: Are you going to throw her off the landing again? I don't think so.",
        "Stephanie: You're still beating that dead horse? Look Nick, you're swinging in the dark here. You don't know anything about the fashion industry, about the fashion business. You are, after all, just a simple business man.",
        "Nick: But fashion is business, Stephanie. You should remember that. And there is something else you should remember. What you did to my mother, Brooke, her family -- you see, you've lived all your life getting your way and manipulating every situation that you're inn that is about to change. Judgment Day is almost upon us. And when it comes, there won't be a thing in the world you can do about it."
