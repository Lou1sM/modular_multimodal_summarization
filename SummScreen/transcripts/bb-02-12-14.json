        "Ridge tells Brooke that he wants this, he wants it for RJ and he knows she wants it too. He tells her to put her ring back on her finger and marry him; be his wife. A tear rolls down her cheek and she hardly knows what to say. Liam thanks Katie for making it official and giving him the plaque; he's the new VP. And imagine he had come over to her house thinking he was being fired. She wishes he had never seen that moment between her and Ridge. But assures him that because he is Bill's son does not mean he has a target on his back. She does not believe Bill set out to intentionally hurt her. Liam seems to be okaying her relationship with Ridge. Katie says it can't be. She'd be the biggest hypocrite alive if she allowed the same thing to happen to her and Ridge. She says she put a stop to it. In fact she practically insisted that he propose to Brooke. Liam doesn't understand if she clearly has feelings for Ridge too. Katie says Ridge will end up going back to Brooke. He always does. He guesses that she is doing this so RJ will have both of his parents at home. But maybe Ridge wants something different now than he had with Brooke. Bill asks Quinn what was the kiss about. She doesn't like him yet she kissed him. She said earlier it was to see if it was the way she remembered. She says she is glad she ran into him here and glad about the kiss too. He says if she is coming on to him, then she'll be disappointed. He's not pining for Brooke; he conquers. She says even if he is not the only game in town. Bill says he doesn't worry about Forrester at all. Quinn says too bad there isn't another Ridge Forrester around; he'd be ideal for Katie.",
        "Bill changes the subject and asks how are things going between Quinn and Eric. She says it is not that way with him. He's handsome and charming ..and Bill adds loaded. She says but she doesn't think anyone could compete with his dead wife. She likes to think of herself as driven not calculating which Bill seems to imply. And here Bill is, a sexy virile man going weeks without ..no wonder he is working so hard with all that pent up testosterone needing to be released. He says smugly that he likes to keep in shape. She wonders what these Logan women have, that they are all obsessed with them. His sons have it too. Then there is Eric if you like the slutty honey type like Donna. But Katie she is different. She seems so kind and moral. She seems more like Ridge's type than Bill's. Bill wonders why Quinn is suddenly so interested in his personal life. She says she is just more amused why the all powerful Bill Spencer isn't so powerful anymore. He's lost his company and Brooke has kicked him to the curb and Katie has custody of his son. He's batting 0 for 3. He says he is going to change all of that. He is not defined by that but his response to it. He mentions just wait with Valentine's Day coming up. She says okay but he has competition. He declares that Forrester is no competition. He's just a little fly buzzing around. He is the past, Bill is the future. She asks about Katie. Bill says she will eventually find someone who is worthy of her. Quinn says like Ridge. Bill says anyone but Ridge. Alone Katie thinks back on her times with Ridge, playing in the park and him reciting poetry to her. Brooke tells Ridge that she doesn't want to be left again so she needs to know if they marry that it will be forever. She can only accept the proposal if it is forever. Bill asks Quinn isn't there someplace she needs to be. She retorts not if he needs to confide. He says he does not confide ..and if he did, hers would be the last ear he would bend. Ridge tells Brooke that he came home to make a home with her again. He still remembers the first time he saw her in his mother's house when she was catering a party. He wants to make this work and yes it can be forever. Brooke finally says yes and they kiss although Ridge cuts it short. Brooke is excited and Ridge says he knows a little boy who is going to be too. They should go up to school and tell him first. Brooke suggests they wait until after they are married and surprise him when he comes home."

        "Ridge: I want this for us.",
        "Brooke: [Gasps]",
        "Ridge: For R.J. and I know you want it, too. So, please... put that ring back on your finger. The ring I gave you in the olive grove in Puglia. Marry me. Be my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Well, everyone knows about your promotion, but the plaque makes it official.",
        "Liam: This is great. Thank you for this. Thank you for your faith in me. And to think, I came over to your house so sure I was gonna get canned.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Well, just because you're Bill's son doesn't mean you have a target on your back.",
        "Liam: Even after all he's put you through?",
        "Katie: Believe it or not, I don't think Bill intentionally set out to hurt me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, just like you never intentionally set out to have feelings for your sister's husband. I'm just saying.",
        "Katie: I'm gonna take that plaque back!",
        "Liam: Come on!",
        "Katie: Liam, why would you bring that up? I wish you had never seen that moment between Ridge and me. It was -- it was nothing, and it's never gonna happen again. I spoke to Ridge, and it's over between us. Not that anything had ever started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So what was that about?",
        "Quinn: Don't tell me you didn't like it.",
        "Bill: The point is you don't like me. And yet you're kissing me.",
        "Quinn: I told you why.",
        "Bill: To see if it still feels as you remember?",
        "Quinn: So many years ago, I was so young and innocent.",
        "Bill: Oh, not this again, please.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no rehashing the past. Unh-unh. But I am glad I ran into you. Glad about the kiss, too.",
        "Bill: So why are you coming on to me?",
        "Quinn: Is that what you think I'm doing?",
        "Bill: If it is, you're gonna be disappointed.",
        "Quinn: Why? 'Cause you're still pining away for Brooke?",
        "Bill: Dollar Bill doesn't pine. He conquers.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Well, maybe you're losing your touch.",
        "Bill: Oh, you think so, huh?",
        "Quinn: Uh-huh.",
        "Bill: Hold that for me.",
        "Quinn: I think I know that you're not the only game in town anymore.",
        "Bill: Forrester? He's the least of my worries.",
        "Quinn: Even though Brooke wants him back.",
        "Bill: It's just out of habit. Not because she can't live without him.",
        "Quinn: Don't forget they do share a son.",
        "Bill: Well, so do Katie and I. And we're not getting back together, either.",
        "Quinn: She won't even consider it?",
        "Bill: She's moved on.",
        "Quinn: With another man?",
        "Bill: Eventually. For now, it seems that Will and work are enough.",
        "Quinn: Mm. Too bad there isn't another Ridge Forrester around. He would be ideal for Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Katie, don't you ever think you're being a little hard on yourself?",
        "Katie: I am not gonna do to my sister what she did to me.",
        "Liam: It's not the same thing.",
        "Katie: To me it is. Ridge and Brooke belong together, right?",
        "Liam: Well, so everyone says, but look how it's always worked out in the past.",
        "Katie: They always find their way back to each other, and this time it's different.",
        "Liam: W-why?",
        "Katie: They're different.",
        "Liam: Really? I mean, you've been hanging out with Ridge since he's been back. How is he different?",
        "Katie: He's been very kind and supportive.",
        "Liam: Right, and how is that different from the Ridge you knew before?",
        "Katie: That's not what I meant.",
        "Liam: Okay, fine -- how is Brooke different?",
        "Katie: She says she's changed.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, she says that a lot.",
        "Katie: This isn't about Brooke. It's about me. It's about my life and how I want to live it. I would be the biggest hypocrite alive if I let something develop between Ridge and me. And I put a stop to it. I did more than that. I practically insisted that he propose to Brooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Obviously you weren't expecting this.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] When I asked you to marry me, you said you needed a little more time.",
        "Ridge: And now I'm here. It's where I want to be. I want to put our family back together. We've lost so much time already. I don't want to lose any more. Say you'll marry me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, speaking of perfect men, how are things going with you and Ridge's old man?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] No, it's not that way with me and Eric.",
        "Bill: Right.",
        "Quinn: Really. He's handsome and he is charming.",
        "Bill: And he is loaded.",
        "Quinn: Yes, but I don't think anyone could ever compete with the memory of his dead wife.",
        "Bill: That doesn't seem to stop you from trying.",
        "Quinn: You make me sound so calculating...",
        "Bill: If the dagger fits.",
        "Quinn: ...When I prefer to think of myself as driven.",
        "Bill: Well, you might want to thinking of yourself as, hmm, I don't know, obsessive-compulsive.",
        "Quinn: Please. Just like you. That's why our personal lives are the way they are.",
        "Bill: My personal life is fine.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Oh, really? A sexy, virile man like yourself going weeks without? No wonder you're working out so furiously. You have all that pent-up testosterone needing to be released.",
        "Bill: I like to keep in shape.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Sure, in the off chance that Brooke decides that she can't live without you and needs to dive right back into your bed. Tell me something. What is it with these Logan women? I mean, it's an obsession. Your sons have it, too.",
        "Bill: So?",
        "Quinn: So? You, Ridge, Eric -- I mean, you're crazy about them. I just -- I don't know. I just don't get it. I mean, I get -- I get Brooke's attraction and maybe Donna's, if you like slutty honey, but... Katie. Katie is so kind and moral. She seems more like Ridge's type than yours.",
        "Bill: You think so?",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. In a lot of ways, she seems more his type than Brooke's. Wouldn't you agree?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Why, Katie?",
        "Katie: Why what, Liam?",
        "Liam: You know why. Why would you insist that Ridge go back to Brooke when you two clearly have feelings for each other?",
        "Katie: Will you please let this go? I have.",
        "Liam: Maybe, if I believed that.",
        "Katie: Believe it. Ridge and Brooke are gonna get back together, just like they always do, and R.J. is gonna be raised in a home with both of his parents.",
        "Liam: Which is the real reason you're doing this, isn't it? I mean, you want your nephew to have what your son couldn't.",
        "Katie: Believe me, if I thought that Bill and I could make a go of it because of Will, but...when the trust is gone. Listen, I know you love your father.",
        "Liam: I know that you'll never trust him again. I mean, not completely. Well, what if Ridge feels the same way about Brooke?",
        "Katie: He doesn't!",
        "Liam: How do you know? Have you asked him?",
        "Katie: I don't have to ask him! He forgives her for everything! Believe me. Their love has been tested enough times.",
        "Liam: You think I'm talking about love? It's not about love. I mean, for them, it's the scandal, it's the embarrassment, something he would never have to worry about if he were in a relationship with you. Look, I know what you're doing. You're trying to do the right thing because this is how you live your life, but maybe if you follow your heart once in awhile.",
        "Katie: Oh, like Brooke? No thanks. Besides, Liam, who knows if Ridge and I -- maybe we've just been two lonely people who have found a connection to each other and that's all.",
        "Liam: Or maybe Ridge sees something in you that he never had with Brooke -- an openness and an honesty. Maybe that's what Ridge really wants now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I should have planned something a little more grand. [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Ridge: No, I should have. Spirited you away to Rome and proposed to you on the banks of the Tiber or something.",
        "Brooke: I don't need to be spirited away. The only thing I need is you. And the life that we are going to have -- the life I thought we would have, until you walked away and left me alone. I just never want that to happen again. So... [Sighs] ...I need to know if we get married, that it's going to be forever. I can only accept the proposal if we are forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, this is how you get your jollies these days?",
        "Quinn: Just an observation.",
        "Bill: A ridiculous one. Ridge and Katie?",
        "Quinn: You'd rather Ridge and Brooke?",
        "Bill: Don't you have some place to be?",
        "Quinn: Not if you need somebody to confide in.",
        "Bill: I don't confide. And if I did, yours would be the last ear I'd bend.",
        "Quinn: Oh, ooh, you really know how to sweet talk a girl. No wonder Katie kicked you to the curb. Oh, no, wait. That was for sleeping with her sister, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Ridge came back to reunite his family.",
        "Liam: Yeah, until he found out what Brooke had done, which changed everything.",
        "Katie: No, no, not everything. Brooke will always be the love of his life.",
        "Liam: Then how come they keep on trying and trying to make it work, only to have it end?",
        "Katie: Because things happen, Liam. You of all people should understand that. People came between them.",
        "Liam: People -- you're talking about Stephanie.",
        "Katie: Yeah, at first. She was adamant that the caterer's daughter from the valley would never marry her son.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, from what I understand, Brooke was just as adamant that she could.",
        "Katie: She loved Ridge desperately. She believed that they could have a life together, and they still can.",
        "Liam: Yeah, sure, sure. If her sister steps aside.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on! I am hardly Brooke's competition.",
        "Liam: I don't know, Katie. Maybe we should ask Ridge about that -- I mean, all the time you've been spending together lately.",
        "Katie: Please stop! Please.",
        "Liam: I'm sorry. I respect you, and that's not gonna change if you and Ridge --",
        "Katie: There is no Ridge and me.",
        "Liam: Because you are this amazing, selfless person, who has more in common with Ridge than Brooke ever will.",
        "Katie: You are so wrong.",
        "Liam: I will prove it to you.",
        "Katie: This is ridiculous.",
        "Liam: Quick -- name something you and Ridge have in common that he and Brooke do not.",
        "Katie: [ Sighs ] Poetry. We both love poetry.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Katie: One poem in particular. You know, it is funny. I've known him for most of my life, and, in a lot of ways, I feel like I'm just finding out about him and we're finding out about each other. Brooke is the woman that he's always loved, and I want them to put their family back together. I want them to be happy finally. I do. And they will be. Just as soon as they get married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I have to be sure, Ridge. How are we gonna handle difficult situations when they arise? Walking away is not an option for either one of us.",
        "Ridge: And it won't be. When I say those vows, I will be committed to you and our boy for the rest of our lives. Oh, man, I remember the first time I laid eyes on you at my mother's house. You were catering a party. You remember that, right?",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: We've been through so much over the years. And the last few months. But I came home because I'm determined to put our family back together, and I know we can do that... if you agree to be my bride.",
        "Brooke: In my heart, I've always been your bride. And if that seems like a yes, [Chuckles] It is! Yes. Yes. For the very last time. [Laughs] Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Since when did my personal life become your concern?",
        "Quinn: Actually, I'm just more amused. I mean, the all-powerful Bill Spencer isn't so powerful anymore. You've lost control of your company, Brooke has kicked you to the curb, and Katie has custody of your son. Right now, you're batting 0 for 3.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm gonna change all that, because I have been guided by the principle that you're not defined by the challenge, but your response to it.",
        "Quinn: How? Your hands are tied where Spencer publications and your son are concerned, and as for Brooke --",
        "Bill: I haven't given up on Brooke. Far from it. Especially with Valentine's Day coming up.",
        "Quinn: Oh. You have something planned? Do tell. It better be special. What, with the competition.",
        "Bill: Ridge isn't competition. He's a nuisance. Like a little fly buzzing around.",
        "Quinn: Uh-huh. One you're gonna swat.",
        "Bill: Forrester is Brooke's past. I'm her future.",
        "Quinn: And Katie?",
        "Bill: Katie will find another man. One that's worthy of her.",
        "Quinn: Someone like Ridge.",
        "Bill: Anyone but Ridge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Katie remembering]",
        "Ridge: \"...Is all this sweet work worth, if thou kiss not me.\" I want you to be happy. You deserve that.",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "Katie: Katie steals! And she scores! Goal! I'm done. [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: \"All things by law divine, in one spirit meet and mingle. Why not I with thine?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Okay. Okay. [Sighs] So, who shall we tell first?",
        "Ridge: I know a little boy in Ojai who's gonna be very excited. So let's drive up there today.",
        "Brooke: Or we could not say anything right now and we could surprise him afterwards. Right? [Laughs] I mean, how great would that be? He'd come home and he'd find out that his parents are married.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: I love you so much."
