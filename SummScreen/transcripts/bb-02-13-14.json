        "Ridge and Brooke call everyone together at the office and Ridge announces that he proposed. Brooke said yes and they are going to get married. They want RJ to concentrate on his studies and will tell him later. Eric insists that they can keep it small and informal but have it at the house. All but Rick seem okay with this. But he is sure that Stephanie will be looking down from her portrait at them. Rick tells Hope that he wants to be happy for his mom but he has doubts in Ridge, a man that has let her down so many times. Liam drops in on Katie and wastes no time by saying he knows she and Ridge share the same feelings for each other and she has as much right to be happy as Brooke does. Katie tells him not to pursue this and she is not going to say one more thing on this subject. She ends by saying Ridge came back for Brooke. He loves Brooke and always has and will. She says she appreciates his support ad advice but this is not helping. He tells her sitting around all day reading love poetry is no swap for the real thing. If she has a chance, then she owes it to herself to take it. He says he has learned from experience, if someone makes you happy then be with them .don't wait for it to be perfect or look good to other people, just be happy. He says nothing is worse than knowing you had your chance and let it slip away. Then he visits Ridge at his office. Nervously he brings up Katie and says he witnessed something between them and despite what Katie might be saying about Ridge needs to go back to Brooke, he doesn't believe she means that. Ridge says Katie is a good person and doesn't play games. Ridge says his future is with Brooke and he has a pretty good start already. He tells Liam that he proposed to Brooke and they are getting married. Liam is taken aback. He starts in again and Ridge interrupts him. He says he is marrying Brooke and he is just focusing on that right now. Liam still rattles on. Finally Ridge gets up and takes the book of poetry out of Liam's hands and says he is committed to his family, Brooke and RJ. He thanks him for his concern and his congratulations but he should take Katie's advice and just let this go. Katie is surprised to see Brooke in her office. Brooke says she has regretted a lot of things but she'd like to fix that and she thinks today is the day to do that. She says she is moving on and she'd like to do the same with Katie. Katie is pretty well floored when Brooke says Ridge has asked her to marry him. She vows never to come between her and her man again. Maybe she does not want Bill back, but this proves that neither does Brooke. Whatever they are, they will always be sisters. Katie hugs her and says yes, and she is happy for Brooke. Katie's tears flow.",
        "Bill is working out at Wyatt's and tells him that Quinn is after him. She is coming on to him, even kissed him to see if it was what she remembered from years ago. Wyatt thinks that is kinda crazy but not the craziest thing she has ever done. Bill says she is definitely not mellowing with age. Wyatt asks if he really wants to get into a debate on which one of his parents is crazier. Bill tells Wyatt it ain't gonna happen and Quinn needs to know that. Wyatt says then he should have made that clear to her. He also says he thinks his mom is more interesting in his relationship with Hope than starting a new one with Bill. Bill is glad his relationship is back on track with Hope, wants to know if it is serious. Looks like he picked the right son to move in with as it might get crowded in here pretty soon. Wyatt says no, Hope is not moving in just yet. Bill thinks it could be at any time. He's glad Hope forgave him for the little problem. Wyatt is expecting a lecture but Bill says no. He used to give Liam a hard time for always thinking he had to prove himself to Hope over and over. He couldn't imagine why any guy would want to put himself through that. But now he does. But he's not worried about that little old dressmaker. He came back for Brooke but it was all talk, no action. He does what he always does. He sees what he wants right in front of him but he can't pull the trigger. He basically dumped her for an entire year so he has no right to judge or say who she could see. But the good news is it is almost Valentine's Day and there is no way Forrester can compete with what Wyatt's daddy has planned. He intends to win Brooke back and Ridge ..he will have to make other plans."

        "Donna: [Laughs]",
        "Hope: Come on. They want it to be a surprise.",
        "Ridge: I proposed. [Laughter] Brooke and I are getting married, and we wanted the family to be the first to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Fill up my schedule, Adele. If I'm here, I want to be in a meeting. [Sighs] If I'm not in a meeting, I want to be home with my son.",
        "Adele: Got it.",
        "Liam: Hey. Hey. Don't want to interrupt.",
        "Katie: Oh, no. We're done.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Katie: Thank you, Adele.",
        "Adele: No problem.",
        "Liam: So, marketing told me about the advertisers' survey. That's a good idea.",
        "Katie: Well, we can't fulfill their needs if we don't know what they are.",
        "Liam: Big thing with you, apparently -- thinking about other people's needs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: [Grunting] She wants me, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Who? Mom?",
        "Bill: She's coming on to me.",
        "Wyatt: What?!",
        "Bill: She kissed me. Said she wanted to see if it still felt like she remembered.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. I mean, it's not the craziest thing she's ever done.",
        "Bill: She hasn't exactly mellowed with age.",
        "Wyatt: Not like you, right, Dad? [Chuckles] I mean, do you really want to get into a debate about which one of my parents is crazier?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: It's not gonna happen, Wyatt. Quinn needs to know that.",
        "Wyatt: You didn't make that clear with her?",
        "Bill: Well, I think I made it clear, but you never know with her, do you?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Join the club. But you shouldn't worry about her. I think mom's more interested in my relationship with Hope than she is with starting a new one with you.",
        "Bill: So, I hear that's going well.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Back on track.",
        "Bill: It's serious.",
        "Wyatt: Depends on what you mean by that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Ridge and I had a friendship. That's it.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah? Is that what it was -- just a friendship? No big deal -- just a friendship? How come you're talking about it in the past tense, then?",
        "Katie: Because Ridge is going back to Brooke, and I don't think we should discuss this anymore.",
        "Liam: You know I'm not doing this to upset you, right?",
        "Katie: Can't you just leave it alone?",
        "Liam: No, I can't. I really can't. I went back to my office. I was sitting there, looking at the little placard thing you gave me. I was thinking about what a thoughtful person you, how you're always putting other people's needs first, you're always thinking about what they need -- our advertisers, our employees, your sister. Brooke has no idea what you've given her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Oh, congratulations, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Eric: You, too, Ridge. This is great.",
        "Ridge: Oh, come here.",
        "Eric: Good for you.",
        "Hope: Have you told R.J., yet?",
        "Ridge: Uh, no. We're gonna wait until after the ceremony. He's got to focus on his studies.",
        "Brooke: Besides, we're not gonna do anything formal.",
        "Ridge: Nope. We're gonna get a license, a witness, and make it official.",
        "Eric: Now, no courthouse wedding, now. Come on. We can keep it small, but we'll have it at the house.",
        "Donna: Oh, that would be so romantic -- getting married right where you first laid eyes on each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Looks like I picked the right son to live with.",
        "Wyatt: What, you're suddenly into wheat grass and tofu?",
        "Bill: I just think it's gonna get a little crowded here pretty quickly.",
        "Wyatt: I don't know what mom has told you, but Hope is not moving in.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yet.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: The pace you're moving -- could happen any time. So, I understand you worked through your problem. Quinn said it was work related.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. Mom really was chatty, wasn't she? Look, I made a bad call. Hope's given me a chance to make up for it. She forgave me.",
        "Bill: Good.",
        "Wyatt: What, that's it?",
        "Bill: Listen, I used to give Liam a hard time about Hope. I...couldn't figure out why he would feel like he had to constantly prove himself to her. I couldn't imagine why any guy would want to put himself through that. But now I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: A proposal was the last thing I expected.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: I was on my way to a press briefing.",
        "Ridge: So, what are you saying? I should have waited -- something less spur- of-the-moment?",
        "Brooke: No. Your timing was perfect.",
        "Ridge: Your answer was perfect. \"Yes\" from the right person is as beautiful as poetry. And our wedding is gonna be simple. We don't want pomp and circumstance. We've done that already.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. We can't top ourselves, so why even try?",
        "Donna: Oh, come on. What kind of attitude is that?",
        "Hope: I think you should try and make this the biggest and best wedding you've ever had.",
        "Donna: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: I'd like to focus on making this the best marriage we've ever had.",
        "Eric: All right. Well, there's no better place to start that marriage then in my -- my living room, under the watchful eye of your mother.",
        "Rick: Stephanie will keep you in line.",
        "Eric: She would be so happy for both of you.",
        "Donna: Still, you just might want to keep out the \"speak now or forever hold your peace\" part. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: Yeah, that picture might come crashing down and hurt someone.",
        "Brooke: That picture is not gonna come crashing down. This is one decision that nobody is going to be able to debate.",
        "Hope: Hey, if we're doing it at the house, why not have Carter officiate? You think we could?",
        "Rick: Well, Carter did a great job for Caroline and me.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Rick: And we know that he can work on last-minute notice.",
        "Brooke: Oh, well, let's not move too fast. I haven't even told Katie yet.",
        "Donna: Oh, yeah. Why isn't she here anyway? Is she stuck at the office?",
        "Brooke: I just want to be able to tell her on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Don't you have just as much right to be happy as Brooke does?",
        "Katie: I am not going to say one more word on this subject.",
        "Liam: Katie, you're a good person, okay? You don't want to do to Brooke what she did to you.",
        "Katie: I won't.",
        "Liam: But telling Ridge to marry her -- why? If it's not even coming from him, why?",
        "Katie: He came back for Brooke. He loves her. He always has.",
        "Liam: Okay. But he has feelings for you, too, which I saw with my own eyes.",
        "Katie: Not every feeling should be pursued.",
        "Liam: Katie, you and Ridge haven't even had a chance.",
        "Katie: Liam, I appreciate the support and the advice, but this really isn't helping.",
        "Liam: You know, sitting around, reading love poetry all day is never gonna be as sweet as the real thing, and if you have a chance -- if you have one, you owe it to yourself to take it.",
        "Katie: You're assuming an awful lot.",
        "Liam: I'm not assuming. I'm just saying what I've learned from experience. And if someone makes you happy, be with them. Don't wait for the circumstances to be perfect. Don't wait for it to look good to other people. Just be happy. Because I'm telling you -- nothing feels worse than knowing you had a chance and letting it slip away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: So, mom and Ridge are getting married again.",
        "Rick: Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Ridge said he wanted to be with mom as soon as he got back to town. How long has it taken him to propose?",
        "Hope: Well, now he has.",
        "Rick: She's not wearing a ring.",
        "Hope: What? [Chuckling] It's not real until Ridge puts a ring on her finger the size of the rock that you gave Caroline? They had some issues to deal with.",
        "Rick: Yeah, he had issues with mom. I want to be supportive. I am glad that she's happy. But that's a big red flag for me.",
        "Hope: You don't want to see her get hurt again. Neither do I. Trust me. But this time, it's different. I talked to her about it.",
        "Rick: I'd like to believe that.",
        "Hope: Well, it seems that way, doesn't it? I mean, you saw mom. When was the last time that she smiled like that?",
        "Rick: She's excited about the wedding, about being back together with Ridge. But has she given any thought to what that means -- putting her faith in a man that -- that has let her down so many times?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Yeah, but it's not the same. She's not competing with anyone anymore. There's -- there's nobody else in Ridge's life, and there's no one else in hers. They finally have a chance to be really happy together. All of the ugliness with Bill and all the guilt that mom felt about Katie is -- is gone. This is a brand-new chapter for them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I'm not worried about that little dressmaker.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Ridge did come back to L.A. for brooke.",
        "Bill: Big talk, no action. He balked, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: He found out she'd be seeing you.",
        "Bill: He did what he always does. He hesitated. Sees what he wants right in front of him, but he can't pull the trigger. He's got to think about it.",
        "Wyatt: What's wrong with that?",
        "Bill: He dumped her. Cut off all contact for basically a year. He's got no right to say anything about how she spent her time or who she spent it with.",
        "Wyatt: Is that how Brooke feels?",
        "Bill: She should. [Chuckling] I mean, the guy has been jerking her around like this for the duration of their relationship. He can't make a decision. He certainly can't make a real commitment.",
        "Wyatt: So, the door's still open for you.",
        "Bill: Yeah. If I can get Brooke to stop worrying about Katie.",
        "Wyatt: That's a big \"if.\"",
        "Bill: Well, the good news for me is Valentine's Day is coming up. And there's no way that Forrester can compete with what your daddy's got planned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hey, uh. Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Hey. If you're looking for Hope, she just left with Rick.",
        "Liam: Uh, no. I-I needed a minute with you, actually.",
        "Ridge: Come on in. Close the door.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Um, I was -- [Chuckles] You probably know why I'm here. I was just with Katie. Um... incredible woman.",
        "Ridge: She is.",
        "Liam: Yeah. A lot stronger than most people realize.",
        "Ridge: She knows what she wants.",
        "Liam: Yes. That's true. That's true. And I respect that. I also respect her choices -- you know, raising Will on her own and -- and running Spencer Publications and challenging my dad. You know, and that happened before the divorce. I mean, even when he was trying to meddle with Hope and me, she always...had our back. Anyway, the point is I'm just saying that you don't have to worry about...what I saw at the house. And Katie -- you know, she says I should forget it, that it doesn't matter, that you... belong to Brooke, but, um... I don't think she means it, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Katie doesn't play games. And my future's with Brooke. And we got a pretty good start already.",
        "Liam: What? Wait, why? What happened?",
        "Ridge: I proposed to her. We're getting married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Katie: Oh. Hi.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Uh... [Clears throat] This is a surprise.",
        "Brooke: I have an even bigger surprise for you -- one that could make a big difference in both of our lives.",
        "Katie: Well, by the way you're smiling, that could only mean one thing. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: You know I regret the choices that I've made -- hurting you, causing this rift between us, and I want to fix it more than anything -- put this pain behind us. And I think today is the day to do that. I'm moving on, and I want to do the same with you.",
        "Katie: You're moving on?",
        "Brooke: With Ridge.",
        "Katie: So, he, um, wants to work things out, huh?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Better than that. Ridge asked me to marry him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: So, you gonna win Brooke back?",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah. Just a few more details to sort out.",
        "Wyatt: Valentine's Day?",
        "Bill: It's gonna be the best one she ever had.",
        "Wyatt: And Ridge?",
        "Bill: Well, he's gonna have to make some other plans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You and Brooke are engaged? Wow. That's -- wow.",
        "Ridge: Everyone's very supportive.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Congratulations.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Liam: I-I guess I should -- you know what? You know what? I witnessed a moment between you and Katie, and it was so obvious to me that there is something magical --",
        "Ridge: Hey, Liam. Liam! I'm marrying Brooke. I'm focused on my wedding.",
        "Liam: When is that happening?",
        "Ridge: When? As soon as possible.",
        "Liam: Well, why the rush, right? I mean -- I mean -- you're sure about this.",
        "Ridge: I wouldn't have proposed if I wasn't sure about it.",
        "Liam: Okay, but you didn't propose until today. Right? And you've been spending a lot of time with Katie and Will, and -- and why wouldn't you? I mean, they're great to be around. Everything she's been through, you'd like Katie would be bitter, but she's not. She's stayed so positive for her family, and... I really admire her, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: So do I.",
        "Liam: For the record, she feels the same way about you, you know? It's not often you meet somebody who...opens you up and makes you -- makes you see new things like...poetry. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: I'm committed to my family -- Brooke and R.J. so I thank you for your concern and for your congratulations, but I think it's best that you take Katie's advice and let this go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I told you I would never be a problem for you again, and I won't.",
        "Katie: Ridge proposed. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: I knew he would. It was only a matter of time.",
        "Katie: And you...couldn't wait to tell me.",
        "Brooke: Ridge and I are starting over, and I want to be able to do the same with you. So maybe now you know that everything I've said is true. I know you probably don't want to go back to Bill, but this should prove to you neither do I.",
        "Katie: But that's not why you said, \"yes.\" I mean, you did say, \"yes\"?",
        "Brooke: Not as fast as Ridge would have liked. I understand now why you couldn't let your guard down with me. It wasn't out of being cautious or being stubborn. It was deeper than that. When Ridge asked me to marry him, I wanted to say yes right away. He's the man I've always wanted to marry. He's the man that I love. But I just couldn't. This man that I love so much also hurt me more than anybody else ever has. I needed more than reassurance. I needed him to tell me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he was never going to do that to me again. And I understand now that that's what you need from me. I'm here to give that to you. Ridge and I are gonna be married very soon, so any concerns that you've had about me and Bill -- you can put that to rest. And maybe you might want to patch things up with Bill.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs]",
        "Brooke: Maybe you won't, but either way, you will know that I will never come between you and a man ever again. Whatever else we are at home with our families or at work, we are sisters first.",
        "Katie: Yes, we are. And I'm happy for you."
