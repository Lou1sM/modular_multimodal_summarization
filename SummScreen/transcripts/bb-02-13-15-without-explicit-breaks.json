    "Recap": [
        "Brooke tells Deacon that it is Valentine's Day and she is sure Quinn is waiting so he should go. He says he has a little time. She says she tried to convince herself that it is any other day but couples are together and out kissing and hugging and yet here she is alone. Quinn knocks on Wyatt's door and asks if she can come in. He says that depends on what she has behind her back. She brings out a huge red Valentine heart shaped box of candy. Bill tells Liam despite what women say, it is jewelry they crave and he has already had his jeweler by this morning and picked something out for Katie. He wonders Liam's plans with Ivy considering Steffy is back in town. Liam confesses he told Ivy about their plans. Bill says he is out of his mind. Steffy is surprised to hear Ivy say she is along with their plan to take over FC. Steffy says she still has her dad to consider. He might want to still run FC. Ivy says he seems happy with just designing with Caroline. Maybe there is another reason that Steffy is hesitating .and they end up discussing Liam. Wyatt enjoys the chocolates but says he has no choice in his life but to move on. And he is sure she did not stop by just to bring him some candy. Brooke tells Deacon that after all these years she did not think she would be alone. He turns down a drink since he is driving .she says he can stay here if he'd like, plenty of room. He tries to get her to make this her last drink but she grabs another. Deacon tells her that Ridge is a fool so forget him and if she wants to talk about family, they have one. Quinn tells Wyatt that she does not trust Brooke and that is where Deacon is. Wyatt reminds her that she can trust Deacon though. She admits yes that she does trust him, more than she does any other man.",
        "Deacon gets Brooke to sit down and offers her coffee or some water which he trades off for her drink. He tells her that she can always count on him. She calls him her drinking buddy, then says she has always had a man to come home to and share a bed with. She does not want to need that, but she is so lonely. She leans on his shoulder. Liam tells Bill that there is an emotional price for Steffy to pay and he is not sure she is ready for that yet. Bill guesses that she is still in love with Liam and if he were with her that she would sell them their shares. Maybe it is time to forget that \"plant\" (Ivy). He's got to do it if there is any chance. Ivy says she thinks Steffy can make a difference and she and Liam can run the company together. Steffy says she has no idea what this might do to her father. And she would think Ivy would feel threatened for them to work such long hours. Ivy says no, she would not feel threatened at all as she trusts Liam, so please come back and run FC. Steffy is impressed with Ivy's confidence but she doesn't think Ivy understands the depth of her and Liam's feelings. She says she will not work all day with Liam and then watch him go home with Ivy. If she comes back she will come back to all of it. Bill tries to convince Liam that he needs to be back with Steffy, the woman he was supposed to be with. She will thank him so do not give up on this. Get control of FC and all the Spencer's will benefit. Deacon gives Brooke some aspirin and says she will sleep better now. He tells her to get a good night's sleep and she can always call him or her sisters. The drink will only help for the moment. She gives him a hug and convinces him to go back to Quinn and have a good evening. When he leaves, she puts down the aspirin and water and goes for the booze again."

        "Brooke: You don't have to stay.",
        "Deacon: I got nowhere I got to be.",
        "Brooke: It's valentine's day. I'm sure Quinn is waiting.",
        "Deacon: I have a little time.",
        "Brooke: I kept [Sighs] Saying this to myself, saying that it was just another day, but you know what? It's not. It's not just another day. People are out. They're celebrating their relationships. They're enjoying each other. They're toasting and hugging and kissing and loving each other, and here I am. I'm here -- alone. I don't want to be alone.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Mom.",
        "Quinn: Can I come in?",
        "Wyatt: That depends... on what you have hidden behind your back.",
        "Quinn: It's a mix of your favorite.",
        "Wyatt: Somebody shoot me.",
        "Bill: Okay! That's my boy!",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Bill: Not letting some sappy fake holiday pull you away from work. I thought for sure I was gonna walk in here and you were gonna be gone, out buying overpriced flowers.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's the next step. First I got to finish this poem.",
        "Bill: Excuse me?",
        "Liam: Help me out. What's a word that rhymes with \"love\"?",
        "Bill: You got to be kidding me.",
        "Liam: Yes, dad. I'm kidding with you -- although Ivy probably would appreciate a poem.",
        "Bill: No. No. Even if women say they want the poem, it's not true. It's all about jewelry -- specifically, diamonds -- which is why I had my boy Phil the jeweler in my office today. I've already picked something beautiful out for Katie.",
        "Liam: Nice.",
        "Bill: So, um... you hanging out with Ivy later?",
        "Liam: I am. Why?",
        "Bill: Oh, I don't know. I just, uh -- well, Steffy's in town, so I just wasn't sure brunette Forrester you may be spending your time with.",
        "Steffy: You want me to join Liam?",
        "Ivy: Yes.",
        "Steffy: He really told you that?",
        "Ivy: Steffy, I support this plan. Look, at first, I was a little thrown because it seems drastic, but I've seen the way that Rick is running this company. If I had the power to change things, I would.",
        "Liam: Very subtle. I'm -- I'm proud of you. I thought you liked Ivy.",
        "Bill: I do if you do.",
        "Liam: I do. I do -- very much. By the way, I told her about our plan.",
        "Bill: Taking over Forrester?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Liam, are you out of your mind?!",
        "Steffy: I'm just a little surprised you're backing a takeover.",
        "Ivy: Trust me -- you would not be surprised if you've seen how Rick's been treating me, and not just here at the office but at home, as well.",
        "Steffy: But if that weren't the case, you'd still support Liam, right?",
        "Ivy: Uh, meaning?",
        "Stephanie: Meaning, obviously, you two are close. So, is that why you're here? You're here to give me a message?",
        "Ivy: I didn't even know that you were here at Forrester. It's just...I'm here with you now, and I thought I would take this opportunity to try and tell you how I feel. Steffy, find a way to make it work. You and Liam in charge -- that's exactly what this company needs.",
        "Wyatt: Well done, mom. Not a nut in the bunch.",
        "Quinn: I told you they're your favorite.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Quinn: I know my son.",
        "Wyatt: And I know you, mom.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: You didn't come here just to give me a valentine, so what do you want?",
        "Quinn: I just didn't want you to be alone, that's all.",
        "Wyatt: Sorry your wife left you -- here's a box of chocolates?",
        "Quinn: Something like that.",
        "Wyatt: Mm. Don't worry about me. I'm moving on. I have no choice. You should probably go home, though. Deacon's waiting for you.",
        "Quinn: No. He went to Brooke's.",
        "Brooke: All of the years... the men... the relationships... I never thought I would be alone.",
        "Deacon: Hey. You'll never be alone... 'cause you can always turn to me.",
        "Bill: I just told you yesterday you cannot talk to Ivy or anybody else about the takeover!",
        "Liam: Dad, Ivy's not gonna go running her mouth to Rick, okay? And, besides, she's one of the reasons I'm pursuing this in the first place, although at this point, I don't even know if I'm gonna pull it off anymore.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? Why not?",
        "Liam: Steffy.",
        "Bill: So she didn't say yes yet! You're a Spencer! Get her on board! Oh, Liam, come on. You're not naive enough to think that she was just gonna hand her shares over to us right away, are you?",
        "Liam: No. No. Of course not, but --",
        "Bill: Then what's the problem? Why aren't you going ahead with your plan?",
        "Ivy: Take your shares and Thomas'. Add them to what bill is allowing Liam to use, and you guys are well and truly on your way to taking over Forrester. I mean, you could get us out from underneath Rick's thumb.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, maybe, but I have my father to consider. He's still might want to run Forrester.",
        "Ivy: I mean, does he really, though? I mean, shouldn't he just be focusing on designing? He seems pretty happy working with Caroline right now. Which is something I'm sure you're thrilled about.",
        "Steffy: You know what? I don't mind the teamwork. It's their relationship that's ridiculous. If anything, that encourages me to go for the takeover.",
        "Ivy: Are you sure there's nothing else holding you back?",
        "Steffy: As in what, Ivy?",
        "Ivy: I just mean is there anything else that could be holding you back from wanting to run a company with Liam?",
        "Steffy: Because I am still in love with him -- is that what you mean?",
        "Brooke: Ready for another?",
        "Deacon: Uh, no. Uh, thanks, though.",
        "Brooke: Oh, go ahead. I'm sure Quinn doesn't mind the smell of alcohol.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, but I got to drive home, and I'm kind of afraid the cops might.",
        "Brooke: Well, you can just stay here. I mean, we got plenty of rooms.",
        "Deacon: I appreciate that, but, uh...",
        "Brooke: Oh, I know. No, this is perfect. You call Quinn and she can come over, and you and Quinn and I -- really, I'm serious -- we can stay here, and we can tell stories about Hal-- not Halloween. Valentine stories.",
        "Deacon: Maybe you need to take it easy and make this your last one, okay?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Deacon: I -- [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: Oh, wait. Did I tell you about the, uh -- the engagement?",
        "Deacon: Uh, no.",
        "Brooke: Bill and Katie. They're -- they're engaged.",
        "Deacon: Well, that's good, right? I mean, that's what you wanted.",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Deacon: Well, I mean, last time we talked, you had a plan in mind with a certain designer, and I think maybe you're feeling a little lonely tonight, so maybe it's a good time to put operation get Ridge back in effect.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Yeah. No, I don't -- Ridge turned me down. He just wants to be with Caroline, so...",
        "Brooke: I don't -- I don't know. I mean, that is Rick's wife. Really, I don't -- I just don't understand what is wrong with this family.",
        "Deacon: Look, forget about Ridge. The guy's - he's a fool. You're talking about family? Brooke, we have a family.",
        "Quinn: Truth is... I don't trust Brooke. I mean, she can use Deacon's concern for hope to...",
        "Wyatt: What, seduce him?",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. You don't trust Brooke. I get that. But my question to you is, do you trust Deacon?",
        "Quinn: He stood by me... through more than most men would, so, yes, I trust Deacon.",
        "Deacon: Why don't you sit down? I'll put you down right over here, okay? Right -- right -- there you go.",
        "Brooke: Ohh.",
        "Deacon: Is that better?",
        "Brooke: Better? Hmm. No, I don't know. I think I felt better standing.",
        "Deacon: You want some coffee?",
        "Brooke: You want me to stay up all night?",
        "Deacon: Okay. Uh... maybe what we'll do is go with some water. Give me that.",
        "Brooke: Ooh. Ahh. [Chuckles]",
        "Deacon: Listen... we have a daughter together. That makes us family. So, if you're ever having another night like this, you can always turn to me.",
        "Brooke: My drinking buddy.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, well... it's the best kind of drinking buddy -- the kind who knows to tell you when you've had enough.",
        "Brooke: Ohh. Wow. I've always had a man to come home to... to share a bed with. And now I... I don't know. I-I didn't think I needed that. I don't want to need that, you know. I don't want to need that. It's just... I'm so...lonely.",
        "Deacon: It's okay.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Lonely.",
        "Bill: I'm telling you right now, once Steffy sees what's going on at that company, it's not gonna take much to convince her to fix it. She's no fan of Rick's.",
        "Liam: I know. I know she's not. I know that. But there's an emotional price to pay for her coming back and working with me, and I'm not sure she's ready to do that.",
        "Bill: Did she say something to you?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yes. Yes. She said something. She says she can't go through with this. She can't run Forrester side by side with me as long as all we are to each other is co-workers. I mean, there's a reason she stayed in paris as long as she did, dad.",
        "Bill: She still loves you.",
        "Liam: Yes. Yes. She does.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that if the two of you were together, that Steffy would sell us her shares?",
        "Liam: [Scoffs]",
        "Bill: Liam!",
        "Liam: Dad, I'm not -- I'm not going there, all right? I'm not opening up that can of worms again, and, in fact -- I don't know -- maybe I should just forget about the whole thing.",
        "Bill: Maybe you should forget about that plant.",
        "Liam: Plant? What -- oh, Ivy? Oh, that's cute. That's real cute.",
        "Bill: Okay, look -- she's perfectly nice, okay? I have nothing against her. But, Liam, it's a new relationship. It doesn't compare to what you had with Steffy.",
        "Liam: Ohh.",
        "Bill: And -- and -- if there was any chance that the two of you can get back to where you were, this time both as a couple and running that company, you've got to do it.",
        "Ivy: I understand how hard it must be for you to come back to L.A. And to work so closely with Liam and to see him and I together. I mean, Steffy, I promise I won't flaunt our relationship in front of you. Liam wants this. He wants to make a big difference here at Forrester, and I believe he can.",
        "Steffy: I believe in him, too. I married him. I was expecting a child with him.",
        "Ivy: Okay. So why not run a company together?",
        "Ivy: Because I just came here for a quick visit. I wanted to see some friends. I wasn't expecting Liam to offer this. This is hard to process, okay, Ivy? I need time to think about this move -- what it would do for me and my dad. If I come back and lead this company with Liam -- we are working together long hours -- you wouldn't feel weird about that? You wouldn't feel threatened?",
        "Ivy: No, not -- not at all. I trust Liam. And I trust his feelings for me. Come back, Steffy. Run Forrester Creations.",
        "Steffy: Ivy, I got to say, I am impressed with your confidence. But I don't think you understand the extent of my relationship with Liam, the depth of our feelings.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] Yeah. You're probably right. I'll never really know what kind of relationship you and Liam had, but I do know what we have. So, I think it might be you who, unfortunately, doesn't know the depth of feelings.",
        "Steffy: If I return to los Angeles, I will not sit front row to you and Liam. I will not run this company and work all day with Liam -- he's the man that I love -- and watch him go home with you. If I come back, I come back to all of it.",
        "Liam: You want me to go back to Steffy?",
        "Bill: You would be with the woman you were always meant to be with.",
        "Liam: Dad, Ivy --",
        "Bill: Ivy loses a boyfriend, and a new one at that. Big deal. Look, you'd be doing her a favor. Her family's company will no longer be hell on earth. I'm telling you that, in time, not only will she understand, she will thank you. You cannot give up on your idea of taking over Forrester. Don't give up on this takeover. You had good reasons for pursuing it in the first place. We get control of Forrester... and all the Spencers benefit.",
        "Deacon: Okay, I found 'em.",
        "[Pills rattle]",
        "Deacon: You should, uh, take two of these. It's gonna help with the hangover tomorrow. There you go.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Deacon: Okay. Get a good night's sleep. You're gonna feel better. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're gonna take it with water.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Okay. Just -- this is what I need. I just need aspirin, water, sleep. I'll be fine tomorrow. Really, I will. It's -- it's okay at work. It's just -- it's here at night is...",
        "Deacon: Okay. Well, let's -- let's change things up with the night, then. I mean, if you start feeling like this again, call me or call your sisters. You can call Bridget or hope, Rick or R.J. I mean, Brooke, we all care about you. You can't drink away the loneliness. Believe me, I've tried. It only helps in the moment. You want me to check on you later?",
        "Brooke: No. No. Really, just go. Go. I've taken up enough of your time already. Go back to Quinn. Have a good evening. Come on.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",
        "Brooke: Thank you. [Sighs] Mnh. Mnh. [Sighs] [Sighs] [Groans softly] [Sighs]"
