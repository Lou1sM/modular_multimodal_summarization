        "Wyatt spruces up his place, and has chocolates in hand along with roses when Hope knocks on the door. He greets her and says \"chocolates, flowers and me\" \u0096 and he kisses her. He invites her in and she pretends she doesn't know what is going on. He says it's only the most special day of the year, the one where a guy has to step up his game so no way they can pretend it's not happening. She says she did not get him anything but he says oh yes she did. He pitches the chocolates and flowers on the couch and gives her a big kiss. She says with all this romance in the air has he heard her mom's big news. She is engaged .to Ridge, not Bill if that is what he was expecting. Wyatt is surprised. He says he just saw his dad yesterday and he seemed pretty confident he was gonna win Brooke back. Wyatt says it's Valentine's Day and he has many more important things to think about. But it is going to be hard on his dad. They snuggle on the couch and Wyatt tells her he made reservations but this feels so good. He hopes he won't be the worst Valentine by suggesting they just order in. She thinks that will be a terrific idea. All she really wants to do is spend time with him. And he doesn't have to keep making things up to her. He has proved he is a better man. She believes it and he should believe it too.",
        "Katie is looking kind of gloomy when Liam pops in. He says he just saw Ridge and he wonders if Katie knows. She says about Brooke marrying Ridge, yes of course she does, just like she asked her to. Liam tells her that she knows she does not have to pretend with him. She says she isn't. Ridge has made the right choice. She tells him again that he has to forget what he saw. This is her sister's husband or soon to be. Liam says that he knows that she does not want this marriage to happen or whatever it is worth he doesn't think Ridge does either. And denying her feelings for the rest of her life, that's what is best for everyone. That's only going to cause more harm. Katie says she knows Liam means well, but he has to leave this alone. She is not her sister. He says he is sorry. He likes her, he respects her and he doesn't want to see her settling. She says she is not. And she also can not stay and listen to any more of this. She grabs her things and leaves.",
        "Ridge is finishing up a meeting with Rick and asks him to stay a spell as he has one other thing to ask him. He thanks him for not giving him grief over being engaged to his mother. Now he wonders if he will go one step further and give them his full support. Rick says he will always be there to support his mother whether Ridge is there or not. And he will always believe in their destiny as long as she lives with Ridge. But he will not be throwing him a bachelor party. Ridge says that is ok if he will agree to be his best man. Rick has doubts but Ridge says he means every vow and he thinks this time it will work. Rick says he wants his mother to be happy and he thinks this will be a positive way to show her so yes he will be Ridge's best man. They shake hands and Ridge says he is right; they can skip the bachelor party. Brooke rushes to the door to find Bill with a huge arm full of roses and wishing her Happy Valentine's Day. He comes in and tries to whisk her upstairs to change and get ready as he has reservations in Santa Barbara. It's Valentine's Day and surely she doesn't want to spend it alone. She says she has something to tell him. First she thanks him for the flowers, then says she knows no is not in his vocabulary but he has to try. What he is doing is not happening ever. She blurts out that she is engaged; she and Ridge are getting married. He's livid, he doesn't think Ridge deserves another chance. Brooke tells him she cares for him but there is no going back. Ridge makes her happy. And she thinks Katie can be happy too with Bill. He can have everything back \u0096 Katie, his marriage, his company, his son. She orders him to just go be with Katie. He puts his hand on her face and says she can not go back to Ridge. He will only let her down again as he always does. He's soft and indecisive and he gets his little feelings hurt and he runs. Bill will not let her go; there is no indecision on his part. He has a goal, they had a goal \u0096 her, his son and the company. He asks about the papers he had drawn up for Katie to sign. Brooke says she does not have them. He asks her to think about one thing while she is marrying Ridge. Those papers gave him control of his company and custody of his son. They can have it all. He tells her he loves her but she tells him to stop it. Finally he leaves. Katie settles in the park, reading her poetry and thinking about Ridge. Meanwhile Ridge is also walking in another part of the park reciting the poetry to himself. Liam finds some modeling photos of Hope on Katie's desk and thinks back on happier times. He texts her Happy Valentine's Day. Wyatt tells Hope that he ordered the food and this will be the first of many traditions. It feels so good to be able to say that. This is their first Valentine's Day and she says the first of many. He says he loves her more and more every day and is so grateful she is in his life."
