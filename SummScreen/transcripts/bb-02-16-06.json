        "Felicia: Nick is my son's father. I know that. And now we have the test results to prove it. So will you please tell him, so I can live the rest of my days in peace?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I don't understand. I don't understand why Felecia is just giving up.",
        "Eric: You think Felicia doesn't want to live? That she doesn't want to raise that little baby? Stephanie, her doctors have told her there's no hope.",
        "Stephanie: That's why we have to get different doctors. I went to San Diego. I went down there to see some specialists.",
        "Eric: You told everyone you were going down there on business --",
        "Stephanie: I did not want Felicia to think there might be some hope if there wasn't any. But there is, there's a chance. It's a long shot. She could have a liver transplant, Eric. I'll take that chance!",
        "Eric: Stephanie, no --",
        "Stephanie: What do you mean \"no?\" I don't want to lose my daughter -- I don't understand what's going on with her, she used to be such a fighter!",
        "Eric: She still is! She's fighting for that little boy of hers. She's trying to put everything in place before she -- I don't want to lose her any more than you do. But we have to respect her choices.",
        "Stephanie: Not if they're the wrong ones.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick singing: There's a whole world waiting right here for you there's nothing you're gonna have to do but let me smile at you and it won't be long 'til you smile at me too mama and papa been waiting for you to come hurry on now 'cause we're gonna have some fun and let us smile at you 'cause it won't be long 'til you smile at me too I'll always smile at you and I'll think about how you'd smile at me too I can see you now smile at me too",
        "Bridget: I think she heard you.",
        "Nick: It's just me and you now.",
        "Bridget: You, me and Dominick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: Nick is Dominick's father. Tell him.",
        "Taylor: The genetic markers have been examined very carefully. There's a 100% certainty that the baby's father is -- Dominick's father is Dante.",
        "Dante: I'm a father?",
        "Felicia: Mistake. False positive.",
        "Taylor: The markers are a perfect match. The results are indisputable. Felecia, sweetie, listen -- the important thing is, he's your son. He's a Forrester. He's healthy and he's happy.",
        "Felicia: He's Nick's! I knew it before the baby was born! Why do you think I would call him Dominick? And every day as I see him grow, there's more and more of nick in him. I tell him stories about his family and where he came from. How can one stupid test -- destroy everything that I've built my son's life around?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: I want to have a service or a memorial for Nicole.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Bridget: With our family. I thought I heard our son.",
        "Nick: He's sleeping. Bridget -- no one will ever replace Nicole.",
        "Bridget: I know that. Dominick has his own place in our hearts now. We're a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: This is a nightmare!",
        "Dante: It's better that we know.",
        "Felicia: Better? How is it better? I'm dying, and the only little bit of solace that I have left is knowing that my son is okay. That he has a loving home with a mom and a dad. Nothing has to change. Nick and Bridget can still adopt Dominick just as they planned. It's best for him. He's already their child in every way that matters.",
        "Dante: Every way but blood.",
        "Felicia: If you hadn't made me take this stupid test --",
        "Taylor: Felicia, you can't keep a secret like this, anyway. It will come out sooner or later. Your son would think you betrayed him, that you lied to him and you don't want that.",
        "Felicia: I just hate this.",
        "Taylor: Listen, I think you two need some time alone and you should talk about it and figure out what you want to do.",
        "Dante: There's nothing to talk about. Nick has to be told the truth.",
        "Felicia: I have no idea how I'm gonna tell Nick -- or Bridget.",

        "Bridget: I'm okay. I was calling to ask you a favor.",
        "Stephanie: Of course, sweetheart. Anything that you need.",
        "Bridget: I wanted to see what you thought about having a family gathering at your place. You know, just a service or something where we can all come together and honor Nicole.",
        "Stephanie: Well, you mean a sort of memorial for her? Well, of course we can do that, when would you like to?",
        "Bridget: I was thinking just as soon as we could. Tomorrow maybe?",
        "Stephanie: That wouldn't be a problem. I'll take care of everything, don't you worry.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: Please put Dominick's needs before your own. If you care about him at all, that's what you'll do.",
        "Dante: That's what I'm gonna do. He should be with his biological father.",
        "Felicia: Don't even try to tell me you're falling in love with him just because he shares your blood.",
        "Dante: I already love him. He's my son.",
        "Felicia: Love takes time to grow, Dante. Just like you're hoping Bridget's love will grow for you when she finds out you're the father.",
        "Dante: Bridget has nothing to do with this, okay?",
        "Felicia: I'm not gonna let you use my son to worm your way back into her heart.",
        "Dante: No one will love Dominick as much as his real father. You of all people, should know that. You're his mother. Felicia, we have a son together. You didn't plan it this way -- neither did I. But we have a son. And I want to see him. I want to hold him. I want to tell him that I love him. And I want him to know that his father's not gonna walk away from him. That's why I'm going there right now!",
        "Felicia: No, Dante!",
        "Dante: Well, I need to see him.",
        "Felicia: And say what? \"Hi, I'm his real father. I need to see my son.\" You can't do that! Let me call nick, okay? I'll tell him to bring Dominick over here.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Nick: Hello?",
        "Felicia: It's me. Could you bring Dominick home? I really miss him and I need to see him.",

        "[Bridget yawning]",
        "Bridget: What's wrong?",
        "Nick: Felicia called. She's scared, or feeling lonely. She wants me to bring Dominick back.",
        "Bridget: Right now? It's so late. It's cold outside. I don't think this is very good for the baby. Why don't -- you know, I'll call her and talk to her.",
        "Nick: No, no, no. She's pretty upset. She needs her son.",
        "Bridget: Okay.",
        "Nick: Besides we're going to have Dominick the rest of our lives. I won't be long.",

        "Taylor: No, come in.",
        "Stephanie: I just wanted to see how you were doing.",
        "Taylor: Oh, considering I just watched my marriage fall apart -- it's not been fun. But I'm not the only one. I guess everybody's going through something right now.",
        "Stephanie: Bridget called about, I don't know, early this evening and asked if we would have a memorial at the house tomorrow for the baby. I'd like you to be there. I realize -- I realize it will be difficult for you to see Ridge with Brooke. But honey, it could be the beginning of the healing process for you. And this little memorial could be the beginning of a healing process for the whole family. What's this? Felicia had some blood work done?",
        "Taylor: That's a confidential report.",
        "Stephanie: That's the other thing I want to talk to you about. I went to San Diego and I saw some specialists. There's a chance -- it's a long shot for Felicia -- but I was hoping that you would talk to her -- talk to her and make her understand she can't give up.",
        "Taylor: Stephanie --",
        "Stephanie: Is this something that she's -- I mean, is she considering a new treatment? Is that it? Is that why the blood work? Has she started a new treatment?",
        "Taylor: It's privileged.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, but she's my daughter. I have to know what's going on.",
        "Taylor: Well, I can't tell you, it's confidential.",
        "Stephanie: Okay, I understand. I'll talk to Felicia.",
        "Taylor: No, Stephanie! Please wait! No, don't, please, no, don't do that. It'll just make things worse.",
        "Stephanie: Worse? How could -- my daughter's dying, what could be worse than that?",
        "Taylor: Just please promise me you're not gonna say anything to her about this until she's ready.",
        "Stephanie: What do you mean -- what are you talking -- you know, you're acting like Eric! Everybody's acting as though we have all the time in the world to deal with Felicia. I'm not gonna sit around and wait until she might be ready to talk.",
        "Taylor: No, no, no, it's just that -- there's other people involved.",
        "Stephanie: What people? What are you talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: My family. It's my family. We're gonna be okay.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Nick: Hey, hey. We heard there was a special lady in need of cheering up. We have Marone and son at your service.",
        "Felicia: Nick --",
        "Nick: Listen, don't say anything until you see our act, okay? It's pretty special. [Nick whispering] Why don't you tell her about our act together.",
        "Felicia: I'm so sorry to make you come out in the middle of the night.",
        "Nick: What, are you kidding? We love car rides, it's our favorite thing together. We have some very, very deep discussions in the car. Who's gonna be in the world series, market updates.",
        "Felicia: I hate taking him away from you.",
        "Nick: While we have a lot of time, you want to talk?",
        "Felicia: Bridget needs you.",
        "Nick: She did want me to mention to you -- [Dominick cries] We're gonna have a memorial for Nicole tomorrow. It's gonna be at your mom's house. If you're up to being there.",
        "Felicia: I hate that you're going through this, it must be so hard for you.",
        "Nick: It would be a lot worse if it wasn't for this little guy. I love him more than I ever thought I would. You know, he is gonna grow up to be a fine young man. The kind of man you'd be proud of.",
        "Felicia: I am so sorry.",
        "Nick: Look at this. There's nothing to be sorry about. Right tiger? Here you go. Hey buddy, you be good, all right?. I'll see you tomorrow.",
