        "Grumpy and Grumpier are at Big Bear Cabin. And Old Mother Hubbard can't find anything in the cupboard to eat. Eric's back is hurting from chopping firewood. He thinks they should sell the cabin. She won't, she loves it. He quips only her and the woodchucks. Ridge and Brooke join them and Eric vows they will stay until they make the decision - there is plenty of booze. Stephanie jokes about Eric not making it up the stairs so they get the bedroom, Ridge the loft. Eric shoots back that look who has a headache every Friday night. Blame it on the brandy but before long Stephanie is good- naturedly ragging on Brooke being a caterer's daughter. Ridge and Brooke go outside leaving Stephanie and Eric to discuss their golden years of sitting on deck with martinis. One thing leads to another and soon they are on the bed having a gigantic pillow fight. Outside Brooke is trying to convince Ridge that it is Eric's risk to take. And leaving their children with some self respect and dignity is more important than a big, fat trust fund.",
        "Frivolity prevails in the bedroom and creaking mattresses and laughter is heard below. Brooke climbs the ladder first and peeks in and tells Ridge he doesn't want to see this. But, oh yes he does, and now his eyes burn. Eric has wonderful memories of his younger titan days with handsome son and drop dead gorgeous wife. When Ridge and Brooke return Eric quips it's so dark outside, they can't see a thing. Ridge remarks trust him, they got an eyeful. Stephanie joins them and offers her apology that is must have been the brandy. Brooke won't let her get away with that and confesses they know what she just did - using her body to get what she wanted. Eric asks if they know how many pieces they have all done together as a team, from beginning to end? 5,000! What an accomplishment. And Ridge is the glue, they couldn't do it without him. Ridge follows everyone else's lead and says he is in. Brooke plants a big noisy kiss on Stephanie's cheek.",

        "Stephanie: What? Where are all the steaks? Where's all the food? Oh, I didn't know you were still outside.",
        "Eric: Do you know how cold it is outside? Do you know how cold it is? You know, we've got to sell this place.",
        "Stephanie: What are you talking about? There's no food in the freezer. We have nothing to eat.",
        "Eric: We probably had a break-in or something.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you're so dramatic. Somebody came up, obviously --",
        "Eric: No, you know, I mean it. People don't have cabins up in the mountains anymore.",
        "Stephanie: Since when?",
        "Eric: I mean, people our age, you know? I might be holding up pretty good, but this chopping wood, it's killing me. My back is killing me!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, shut up, Mr. Grumpy. It was your idea to come up here in the first place for this meeting. And I'm not selling this cabin. I love it.",
        "Eric: Yeah, you and the woodchucks.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, come on. [Stephanie laughs] You love it, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Brooke: Why didn't you put the chains on?",
        "Ridge: Well, it wasn't snowing when I passed the state troopers. What are you standing out in the cold for?",
        "Brooke: Oh -- well, actually --",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Brooke: I was too nervous to go in there, you know, Stephanie and my track record, being up here in the cabin --",
        "Ridge: Oh, come on, Logan. She likes you now. She does. Come on, let's go in. Let's get out of here.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Let's go. Go, go, go.",
        "Stephanie: You can't sell this cabin. If you're going to sell something, sell my jewelry.",
        "Eric: Well, now, that's an idea. You never wear anything I get you, anyway.",
        "Stephanie: What are you talking about?",
        "Ridge: Haven't you got the damn fire going yet?",
        "Eric: What does it look like I'm doing?",
        "Stephanie: Did you two eat all the steaks that were in the freezer?",
        "Ridge: No. Thomas probably had his friends up here --",
        "Stephanie: Oh, well, that explains everything, Thomas was up here --",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, old Mother Hubbard here says that the cupboards are bare.",
        "Stephanie: Well, it is! There's nothing out there but some kind of cracked hot wheat cereal. I don't even know where it came from --",
        "Ridge: Oh, for God's sakes. That's been here since I was a kid. Look, did we really have to come all this way for a meeting? In the snow, in the sleet --",
        "Eric: All right, all right, get over it. Relax. Just have yourself a drink. There's plenty of booze. Now, listen, we have to make some decisions here. All of us here. I know you think I'm crazy for wanting to open our own line of retail shops. Maybe I am. But that's why we're here, to talk this thing out. To fight, if we have to. And we're not going to leave here until we come up with some kind of a unanimous decision about the future of this company.",
        "Stephanie: That brandy's good, isn't it?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Eric: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: It's really good. I think we should put a moratorium on any big decision until next week.",
        "Eric: Oh, a moratorium, why?",
        "Ridge: Brooke thinks that Popeye may sell Forrester Originals through the Jackie M Boutiques.",
        "Stephanie: What?",
        "Eric: Why in the world would you think that?",
        "Ridge: She talked to him.",
        "Stephanie: On whose authority?",
        "Brooke: It wasn't anything official, Stephanie. I just asked him if he would consider it.",
        "Stephanie: Well, how do you think that makes us look?",
        "Eric: I'm afraid I'm with Stephanie here on this.",
        "Stephanie: What, afraid? What are you afraid of?",
        "Eric: That's enough brandy for you.",
        "Ridge: Okay, who's sleeping in the loft tonight?",
        "Stephanie: You can't be serious. He can't make it up the stairs.",
        "Eric: What am I, some kind of an invalid? I'm not the one who has a headache every Friday night.",
        "Ridge: Ouch!",
        "Stephanie: I'd like to talk to you alone, sweetheart. In the bedroom.",
        "Ridge: You know, this is all really unnecessary, because the answer is staring us right in the face. Hey, it was good enough for Martha Stewart --",
        "[Brooke laughs]",
        "Brooke: Ooh, I was wondering when somebody would bring that up.",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Brooke: Letting your wife go to prison for what she did to Jackie?",
        "Stephanie: Wait -- why doesn't anybody believe my version of that story? Why?",
        "Brooke: Are you kidding? Your son brought it up, anyway.",
        "Ridge: I was talking about selling our line in the department stores. Hello!",
        "Brooke: Oh, that.",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, but you're disappointed I didn't go to jail.",
        "Brooke: No, I am not disappointed that you didn't get arrested. In fact, I could've pressed charges against you half a dozen times for what you did to me right here in this very room!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, really?",
        "Eric: All right, I think bed is a very, very good idea.",
        "Ridge: I second that.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, well, nothing changes. Once a caterer's daughter, always a caterer's daughter.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God!",
        "Eric: Bed! Bedroom, now.",
        "Brooke: I can't believe she's starting on that. What did she call me? She just called me \"Common.\" Common. I cannot believe that she goes back to that --",
        "Stephanie: And to your face --",
        "Brooke: I was born in the valley, and she calls me common. Like I'm some kind of \"Miss little common\" -- and now she's sounds like a little chicken with her head cut off --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: What's the matter with you?",
        "Stephanie: I'm sure you'll tell me.",
        "Eric: You're tormenting Brooke like this, again?",
        "Stephanie: Why don't you ever look at me the way you look at her?",
        "Eric: I do. You never notice.",
        "Stephanie: I think I'm scared. You know, just starting this whole new adventure. I mean, think about it, honey. Think what it was like when we launched Forrester Creations. It was really hard work, and we did it all from scratch.",
        "Eric: Well, we've got a lot more in our scratch than we ever did then. Now, the bank says we can do it.",
        "Stephanie: But what do we have to prove?",
        "Eric: Oh, God -- I'm the quitter, remember?",
        "Stephanie: Let the kids do it. Come on, it's their turn.",
        "Eric: Oh, and what am I now? All washed up?",
        "Stephanie: You are Mr. Eric Forrester. The one and only Eric Forrester. And nobody can ever take that away from you.",
        "Eric: Yeah, but they can take it away. They start stamping our name on the bottoms of cheap slippers and selling them in mega-stores all over the country",
        "Stephanie: And what about us? You've been complaining, badgering me, that I have never been the wife that you've always wanted me to be. So, when do I get a chance to do that? If we start up this whole venture, you're going to work yourself into a frazzle. How do I know you won't have a heart attack or a stroke?",
        "Eric: Oh, for goodness sake --",
        "Stephanie: Come on, now. Then, what is -- where am I left? What's my reward? What's our reward? Why can't we just -- why can't we just sit back and enjoy all this money that we have made?",
        "Eric: All right. All right we'll charter a yacht.",
        "Stephanie: That's it. Great! Now, pick a destination.",
        "Eric: Well, I've always wanted to see the fjords in Chile.",
        "Stephanie: Chile?",
        "Eric: Mm-hmm. Although, I've always wanted to see them from a kayak.",
        "Stephanie: Me in a kayak?",
        "Eric: Right. We'll stay on the boat.",
        "Stephanie: We can't stay away long, though. You know that. Because whatever the business they start up, they're going to need our help.",
        "Eric: Yeah, or they'll screw it, won't they?",
        "Stephanie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric: We're just -- we're just kidding ourselves, aren't we?",
        "Stephanie: About the kayaks?",
        "Eric: No, about spending the rest of our lives sitting in deck chairs sipping martinis somewhere.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, honey, you know what I've always wanted to do? I've always wanted to learn how to fly a helicopter.",
        "[Eric laughs]",
        "Eric: Oh, my God! Why is risking life and limb the only way you and I can enjoy ourselves or relax? Well, I think it'd be a lot safer to just mortgage everything to the hilt and carry on. You know, we wouldn't have had this wonderful life that we have together if we had been the retiree types.",
        "Stephanie: I don't know, its awfully nice to think about it, though, sometimes, isn't it?",
        "Eric: Yeah, I know. But that's not what I want. And I don't want to have you on my arm, some golden girl hobbling along. I want you to be you.",
        "Stephanie: Wish I was 30 years younger?",
        "Eric: I would just be insecure.",
        "Stephanie: 30 pounds skinnier?",
        "Eric: A waist is a terrible thing to mind.",
        "[Stephanie laughs]",
        "Stephanie: You goofus! That's it.",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Stephanie: Okay, have your stores. I'll go for it.",
        "Eric: Yes! Yes, that's my girl!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, we'll have to mortgage everything. You're such a pushover!",
        "Eric: Pushover? You're the pushover, here you go. Right there.",
        "Stephanie: Hey, hey! Did you push me?",
        "Eric: Yes, and I say it's just about time. Here. There you go!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my God!",
        "Eric: Give me something to hit! Come on, give me something to hit! I got you, here.",
        "Stephanie: Ow!",
        "Eric: Really?",
        "Stephanie: You're hitting me! You're hitting me!",
        "Eric: Give me that. Give me that!",
        "Stephanie: Stop!",
        "[Stephanie laughs]",
        "Eric: Come here. Come here! Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss! Come here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Logan?",
        "Brooke: Oh, my feet were cold.",
        "Ridge: How long are you planning on staying out here?",
        "Brooke: Until your mother goes to sleep.",
        "Ridge: Will you stop paying so much attention to her?",
        "Brooke: A severe case of frostbite is better than sharing the same room with her.",
        "Ridge: Oh, it's just the Brandy on an empty stomach talking. That's all.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, why did you have to bait her and tell her I went to see nick?",
        "Ridge: Well, she had a point, you know. You should have asked one of us first.",
        "Brooke: And you and Stephanie should've asked me before you went on national television and said that Jackie was a whore.",
        "Ridge: Well -- okay, okay, okay, okay.",
        "Brooke: I can't stay married to you if you're going to keep siding with your mother.",
        "Ridge: What do you want me to do? I'll do it.",
        "Brooke: I don't know, just -- let your father have what he wants.",
        "Ridge: If we do this retail plan, it will bankrupt us! You know that.",
        "Brooke: Everything that you have and everything that you grew up with, and took for granted, is because of your father, his hard work and his talent. It's his to risk. If he wants to risk it, he should.",
        "Ridge: Look, you said it yourself, Logan. Don't we owe it to our kids to at least leave them as well off as we were?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Ridge: No?",
        "Brooke: No, I mean -- I just think it's more important that we leave them with some pride and some self-respect, dignity. It's much more important than some big, fat trust fund.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I'll try to get rid of some of this evidence here.",
        "Stephanie: Close that window and get your naughty ass back here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Logan, what are you doing?",
        "Brooke: Shh!",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Brooke: You don't want to see this.",
        "Ridge: What? What is it?",
        "[Mattress creaking]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Brooke whimpers] No, no. No!",
        "Brooke: Let's never, ever leave a ladder outside of our bedroom window.",
        "Ridge: My eyes are burning now! Oh, God -- thanks, Logan. Thanks a lot.",
        "[Brooke laughs]",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Eric remembering]",
        "Stephanie: Once a caterer's daughter, always a caterer's daughter.",
        "Brooke: Do you think that that's enough napkins?",
        "Beth: Yes, that's fine. Mrs. Forrester, this is my daughter, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Hello, Mrs. Forrester.",
        "Stephanie: Hello, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: You have a very beautiful home.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you. The guests will be arriving shortly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Excuse me. I've been waiting for you, darling.",
        "Brooke: Were you talking to me?",
        "Ridge: I thought -- I thought you were someone else.",
        "Brooke: Sorry.",
        "Ridge: Me, too.",
        "Eric: Where have you two been? It's pitch dark out there. You can't see a thing.",
        "Ridge: Oh, trust me. We got an eyeful.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yeah. I think we should really head home.",
        "Eric: No, I want you to sit down. We have something to discuss. Come on, sit down. And Stephanie's in a much better mood now.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yeah. I'm sure she is.",
        "Stephanie: Ooh, why, it's like a s\u00e9ance in here.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, in a way, it is. Our entire future is going to be determined this evening. Make yourself comfortable, come on.",
        "Stephanie: I'm so sorry. That Brandy just went right to my head. What's that, sweetheart?",
        "Brooke: Don't \"sweetheart\" me. We know all what you did. How you used your body to get what you want.",
        "Stephanie: Moving on -- I have decided to give Eric my vote for his retail stores.",
        "Brooke: Oh -- well, I think it's kind of risky. It's like betting on ourselves. But I believe that we can do it. So, come what may -- I'm in.",
        "Eric: Thank you, Brooke. Thank you. And before you say anything, do you know how many pieces we've done together? All of us, as a team?",
        "Ridge: No, how many? 5,000?",
        "Stephanie: 5,000.",
        "Eric: Yes!",
        "Ridge: Whoa!",
        "Eric: It's a terrific accomplishment, especially in this field. 5,000! It's a huge milestone. It really is. And all of us together, doing it together from the very beginning. We've been creating our art, and the world has accepted it. And you, Ridge, you're the glue. We cannot do it without you.",
        "Ridge: All right! I'm in.",
        "Eric: That a boy! That a boy!",
        "Brooke: Did you hear that, Stephanie? The four of us -- from the very beginning to the bitter end.",
        "Ridge: Happy 5,000!",
        "Eric: Yes, and it is! It really is.",
        "Brooke: What do you say, Stephanie? To 5,000?",
        "Stephanie: I'll wait 'til 10,000.",
        "Brooke: I'll see you in the bedroom.",
        "Ridge: Yes, you will.",
        "Brooke: Big boy --",
        "Stephanie: Some things never change.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, I know you love me.",
        "Eric: Look at this year, we did only 182. It was the smallest year we ever had to do.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, cool.",
        "Eric: And then next year, 687!"
