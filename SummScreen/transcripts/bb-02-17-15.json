Carter says between the Spencer's and the Forrester's he could have a second career. He and Wyatt start talking office and Bill says no such talk today. He spies Brooke as she comes in and he goes to her. She says today has turned out just as it is supposed to be. She spies a waiter with champagne and says she needs one. Aly asks Ivy how she feels about double weddings. Ivy quips they would have to wait for Liam to propose first. And she also thinks Steffy might have something to say about that. Bill tells Brooke that Caroline will be coming but he doesn't want Ridge there to make a scene. At that moment Ridge and Caroline come in. He goes to Brooke and tells her she looks lovely. She asks if he came alone. Caroline walks up and she says she has to get to Katie with her needs if she can leave the kiddies along. She walks off chuckling. She bursts in on Katie and Donna and shows them the bottle of bubbly she brought along and wants to celebrate now. Katie says she will give cheer to their boyfriends they will have someday .she refuses to be the only happy Logan sister. Donna is a bit nervous so Brooke offers to help Katie with her dress. She gives her a locket with their pix as kids inside. As Brooke puts it around her neck, Katie says she is so grateful that Brooke is in her life again and they can be close.",
        "Wyatt tells Bill to chill out about Caroline and Ridge. He will not want anything to spoil this day. Caroline gives her Uncle Bill a kiss and Bill finally sticks out his hand to shake with Ridge and says his niece is very special so take care of her. Katie reads a text to Brooke that her dad forgot his flu shot this year so now he is paying the price. He will make it up to her later. Brooke tells Katie they need to go get her married. The music starts as Donna walks down the aisle and takes her seat. Finally Brooke makes a late appearance with a glass in her hand.

        "Liam: What? What did you -- I thought you were the --",
        "Wyatt: It was a joke! Are you really upset?",
        "Bill: I am set to marry the woman that I was always meant to be with. I have got three terrific sons, all of whom make me very proud, even if, uh, one of them thinks he's a wise guy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Sorry.",
        "Bill: I got my health, I got my dashing good looks, and more money than God.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: And a little deal in the works that is going to rock more than a few worlds.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: I am fit to be tied.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Come here, boys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: There you go.",
        "Katie: You look awesome. You look great. But I'm not sure that attire is nap- time ready.",
        "Donna: Oh, well, look how cute he looks.",
        "Katie: He does look cute.",
        "Donna: What's that? Oh, really? [Gasps] You think your mommy looks like a princess?",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah? Did your daddy tell you to say that?",
        "Donna: That's our Bill. Covering all his bases, making sure his luck holds.",
        "Katie: Oh, our Bill? Are you finally admitting how much you like him?",
        "Donna: I like that he finally came to his senses and realized that this is where he belongs -- with you and Will.",
        "Katie: Actually, I was the hold-out, you know. I, um, wanted to be sure.",
        "Donna: And you are sure now that this is what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: It's a wedding, not a trip to the dentist.",
        "Ridge: You know how I feel about him.",
        "Caroline: Yes, and I know how he feels about you, but now that you're involved with a Spencer...",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I'm sure he's happy about that.",
        "Caroline: And neither is Brooke, but they don't run our lives. What?",
        "Ridge: Logan is Katie's matron of honor. It's gonna be a difficult day for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Anything I can take to the car, Miss Logan?",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Man: It's getting late.",
        "Brooke: Uh, I'll be right there. [Sighs] Oh! [Sighs] [Coughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Hey. I went downstairs, and more guests are arriving. Rachel's ready to take Will for his nap.",
        "Katie: Oh, cool. Great.",
        "Donna: When you wake up, buddy, your mommy and daddy are gonna be married again.",
        "Katie: What about Brooke? Is -- is she here yet?",
        "Donna: Oh, um, I'm sure she's on her way. You know our big sis, how excited she is for you and your family.",
        "Katie: Still, I asked her to be my matron of honor after everything. She would tell me if it was too much, right?",
        "Donna: [Sighs] Of course she wants to be part of this. I mean, not that I'm jealous or anything.",
        "Katie: Oh, you wanted to stand up for me?",
        "Donna: Hmm. Oh, I'm just so excited for you. Our sister's getting married today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Well, I'm glad you could make it, Alison. Excuse me. So, dad tells me that you are officiating.",
        "Carter: Yeah, between the Spencers and the Forresters, I can launch a second career.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Probably not a bad idea considering all that's going on at Forrester these days.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Hey, I, uh, I heard Rick fired you.",
        "Wyatt: Actually, I quit.",
        "Aly: But now you're back.",
        "Wyatt: After a lot of groveling, yes. And if it all pays off in the long run...",
        "Bill: Boys, boys. There will be no shop talk. Business is off limits today.",
        "Liam: I'm sorry. Did that come out of your mouth?",
        "Bill: I said it.",
        "Aly: They say love will do that.",
        "Bill: Who invited you, again?",
        "Aly: I read it somewhere.",
        "Bill: Well, don't believe everything you read. But in this case -- excuse me. You made it.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Barely. My driver was like a New York cabbie. Oh, is that champagne? I could use a glass.",
        "Bill: Here you go.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Bill: Well, your sister's upstairs. Donna keeps shooing me away, won't let me have a sneak peek.",
        "Brooke: Good for Donna. The groom shouldn't see the bride until she's walking down the aisle.",
        "Bill: Even if the wait is torture for him?",
        "Brooke: Well, it's almost here. You and Katie are going to be married. Your son's going to have his parents. Everything's turned out the way it should be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: So, how do you feel about a double wedding? Bill and Katie, you and Liam?",
        "Ivy: Oh! Well, I think Liam might have to propose first.",
        "Aly: If he did right now, this minute, what would you say?",
        "Ivy: Right this minute, I would say there has been a new wrinkle you don't know about.",
        "Aly: What?",
        "Ivy: Who. Steffy. Yeah, her and I had quite the heart-to-heart, and apparently she has plans for herself and Liam.",
        "Carter: Man, Brooke's a very beautiful woman.",
        "Justin: Yeah, all the Logan sisters are. They're also very supportive of one another.",
        "Carter: They have to be.",
        "Justin: Yeah.",
        "Carter: Especially Brooke and Katie after what went down this past year.",
        "Justin: That's true.",
        "Bill: All right, look, I told the kids no shop talk today, but I've got to go over this with you. Is there any way that you can rein in your son at Forrester?",
        "Brooke: Why would I do that?",
        "Bill: For starters, he's become such a loose cannon that I didn't want Katie to invite him here today because I didn't know if he'd go off half-cocked. Now, fortunately for Caroline, he's not coming, but --",
        "Carter: Excuse me. I need to talk to you about some of the details about the ceremony.",
        "Bill: Excuse me.",
        "Liam: Hey, Cous.",
        "Ivy: Hey. Didn't think you guys were gonna make it.",
        "Caroline: Yes, I'm afraid I had a very reluctant escort.",
        "Liam: Can't imagine why, seeing how close he is with my dad.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: Hey. You look lovely.",
        "Brooke: I do, don't I? Did you come alone?",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles] You know I didn't.",
        "Caroline: Hi. What'd I miss?",
        "[Cell phone beeping]",
        "Brooke: Oh. S.O.S. from Katie. She needs me upstairs. You sure I can leave you two kiddies unsupervised? [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Didn't Brooke text you back?",
        "Katie: No, she didn't. I'm -- I'm gonna call her and just see what's keeping her. It's me. Um, did you forget what day it is? I'm just wondering where --",
        "Brooke: Not only did I not forget, I brought bubbly to kickstart this celebration.",
        "Katie: Oh, my gosh. I am so happy to see you. Where -- where have you been?",
        "Brooke: Oh, I was downstairs. I got detained. Ridge and Caroline.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Donna: Are you okay?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. It's Ridge who is going through this midlife crisis. But you know what? This isn't about me. This isn't about Ridge. This isn't about his arm candy. This is about our sis. And she's never looked more radiant.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "[Cork pops]",
        "Brooke: Oh, my gosh!",
        "Donna: You guys ready?",
        "Katie: Please pour. Please pour. What should we toast to?",
        "Brooke: Oh!",
        "Katie: Should we toast to Brooke coming back from Milan? Or should we toast to Donna's new boyfriend?",
        "Brooke: What? You have a boyfriend?",
        "Donna: Oh. I do? What?",
        "Katie: Well, you will. You both will have men in your life because I refuse to be the only deliriously happy married Logan girl. It's just not gonna -- it's not for me.",
        "Brooke: That is so sweet.",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Brooke: To our sweet sis on her wedding day. No one deserves to be deliriously happy more than you.",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Donna: Bill is not gonna be able to keep his eyes off you.",
        "Katie: Especially if I walk down the aisle with my robe on.",
        "Donna: Your gown.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Donna: Oh! [Laughs] We forget to get you in your gown. Whoopsie!",
        "Katie: Okay, I love my sister to death, but she's making me kind of crazy. Can you please?",
        "Donna: Well, I checked the dress earlier to make sure that there were no -- uh-oh -- wrinkles. Oh, no. [Chuckles] The zipper's stuck.",
        "Brooke: Honey, it's okay.",
        "Donna: I got it.",
        "Brooke: No, no, no. I will get Katie dressed, and you go downstairs and check on how things are going.",
        "Donna: Okay! Love you.",
        "Katie: I love you, too.",
        "Donna: Bye. Take the bubbly with me. All right. See you.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Thank you so much.",
        "Brooke: Don't thank me yet. The zipper really is stuck.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Not that Bill wouldn't mind seeing you naked walking down the aisle.",
        "Katie: Uh, yeah, he probably would prefer that, but I don't need to give the others a show.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] It's really stuck. Oh! Ta-da!",
        "Katie: Ta-da. Is there anything my big sis can't do?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Are you okay? What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Bill: Was that Donna?",
        "Liam: Yeah, doing reconnaissance for the bride, no doubt.",
        "Wyatt: Probably scoping out any sign of tension between the groom and a certain guest.",
        "Bill: Look at that loser. Using your cousin the same way he used all the other women in his life.",
        "Wyatt: Easy, Dad. You don't want anything spoiling your bride's big day, right?",
        "Aly: Is it me, or did I notice a little chill before? Bill -- he's not causing problems for you and Liam?",
        "Ivy: No. No. Why?",
        "Aly: I just thought I... no. Forget it. Why would he cause problems? His son's never been happier, and you're the reason.",
        "Caroline: So, which one of you handsome hunks is the groom?",
        "Bill: That would be me.",
        "Caroline: Hmm.",
        "Bill: Ridge. Katie will be happy that you're here.",
        "Ridge: [Clears throat] Congratulations. She's very special. Take care of her.",
        "Bill: Caroline's very special, as well. My advice to you -- take care of her.",
        "Brooke: Sure you don't want more?",
        "Katie: No, there's no way. I couldn't. I'm too wound up. Too excited. Am I forgetting anything? [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Oh.",
        "Katie: Mom's locket.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: It has her favorite picture of us kids. Thank you. Would you, um... [Sniffles] [Sighs] Oh, gosh. [Laughs] I have always looked up to you. And I never thought anything could come between us [Sniffles] Until it did, but... but you wouldn't accept that. You went halfway around the world so that Bill and me could find each other again, and... I just want you to know... I am so grateful that you're in my life again and that we're close and you can be happy for me.",
        "Brooke: [Sobs]",
        "Katie: It's a text from dad. He says that he wishes he could be here but he still feels bad. He doesn't have a fever anymore and next year he's definitely getting the flu shot.",
        "Brooke: Champagne could really use a shot of vodka.",
        "Katie: I tell him to get a flu shot every year.",
        "Brooke: Tell dad we miss him and love him and hope he gets better soon.",
        "Katie: All right. What are you thinking about?",
        "Brooke: Mostly how happy I am for you. And how important it is to make the right choices.",
        "Donna: Katie, Brooke, it's time! You look beautiful.",
        "Katie: What were you gonna say?",
        "Brooke: Just that... if you wait one minute longer, your groom is going to come rushing up the stairs looking for you, so come on! [Laughs] Let's get you married.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: If you're ready, we'll begin.",
        "[String music playing]",
        "Ivy: So, where's the maid of honor?",
        "Wyatt: Do you want me to go see what's keeping Brooke?",
        "Ridge: I told you Brooke shouldn't have agreed to this.",
