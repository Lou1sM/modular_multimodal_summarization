        "Katie is shocked that Brooke is asking her to be matron of honor. She even asks if Ridge knows about this. Brooke assures her that Ridge loves her and he will want her to be part of their special day. After an agonizing period of time and no good excuse not to, Katie reluctantly agrees. Bill turns around and finds Quinn back in Wyatt's house again just staring at him. He wonders why she is always creeping around. She says she likes to think what is going on in that dark, twisted mind of his when he's lost in thought ..or maybe just lost ..like he's been caught with his pants down. That hang-dog look on his face says it all; it's about Brooke. He says no; it's Ridge. They are getting married tomorrow. Quinn wants to know what is his plan. He says there is no damn plan. She guesses if it is not about control, then possibly could it be love. The great Bill Spencer is in love. But he can't have Brooke. She says she doesn't mean to sound trite, but there is someone else out there for him. Bill says he doesn't need anybody else; he just wants to share it with Brooke.",
        "Meanwhile all at the meeting assure Ridge they are ahead of schedule so they can clear the day for him tomorrow. Pam quips there have been several of those but Ridge says this one is especially significant. Wyatt says for Katie too as it might free up Bill to go back to her. Ridge says Katie does not want Bill; that he is sure of. He fills Maya and Carter in that the first time he met Brooke she was catering a party at his parent's house and he took one look and his life was changed forever. Brooke seems to live from her heart so it's that aura and that energy not just her beauty and sexuality. Wyatt and Hope laugh over the fact that many think his mother is crazy. Hope says she still intends to talk to her. He wishes she wouldn't, as they are all a little nutty. He states that she raised him all by herself so he thinks she deserves a free get out of jail card. And there is no one else she hates more than Bill, yet it's weird as there is no one else she loves more. At Katie's request, Ridge shows up at her office. She tells him that she will be at the wedding tomorrow. She says she did not want to at first but Brooke started in on family and loyalty and she tells Katie that Katie is the standard bearer of decency. He's glad she is going to be there to see it. She says tomorrow will be the start of a brand new beginning and she will be part of it. She gives him a big hug and says that is what she wants for him."

        "Katie: You want me to be your matron of honor.",
        "Brooke: Ridge and I. You've -- you've been our biggest supporter.",
        "Katie: Have you talked to Ridge about this?",
        "Brooke: No, not yet. But he's gonna be thrilled. He loves you. He's gonna want you to be a part of our special day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Which puts us ahead of schedule for the rollout.",
        "Pam: Which means tomorrow's a free day. No school!",
        "Hope: I know one of us is definitely going to take the day off.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Uh, you guys are doing a heck of a job.",
        "Wyatt: Well, anything we can do to get you off campus for your big day.",
        "Ridge: And your accessories are amazing, by the way.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you. But my mom deserves the credit for that.",
        "Pam: Yeah, she deserves credit for a lot.",
        "Ridge: Meaning what?",
        "Pam: Oh, Quinn and Wyatt are legendary. Way ahead of the curve on lots of things.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: What the Hell are you doing creeping around? How long you been standing there?",
        "Quinn: Long enough to hear you talking to yourself.",
        "Bill: Well, I wasn't doing that, but whatever.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but wouldn't it be interesting if you were? I mean, how often does the world get to see Bill Spencer lost in thought? Or maybe just lost.",
        "Bill: I got to talk to that son about who he gives his keys to.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Don't think I've ever seen you so exposed.",
        "Bill: Be happy to put my shirt on.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no. That kind of exposure I enjoy. It's...it's what's going on in that dark, twisted mind of yours. It's like you've been caught with your pants down. What's going on, Bill, that has you so introspective? Her name wouldn't be Brooke Logan, would it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Well, Wyatt's at work, so feel free to go track him down.",
        "Quinn: Touchy.",
        "Bill: I've got things to do, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Like what?",
        "Bill: Oh, like -- let me see -- anything that involves not talking to you.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Mm. Moods. One thing I don't miss about you.",
        "Bill: That is a door.",
        "Quinn: There are things that I do miss, I suppose.",
        "Bill: My charming personality?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] No, that's not on the list. Is there anything you miss about me?",
        "Bill: Mm, let me think. No.",
        "Quinn: Wow. You really are in a state. All because of Brooke.",
        "Bill: I didn't say that.",
        "Quinn: Mm. You didn't have to. That hang-dog look on your face says it all.",
        "Bill: It isn't Brooke. It's Ridge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Okay, Ridge. So Thorne now knows that I'm going to be late for that event.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Pam: Oh! Carter, Maya. Hey, another wedding.",
        "Carter: Every officiant's dream -- to preside over a Ridge-and-Brooke wedding.",
        "Pam: Yeah, there've been a few of those.",
        "Ridge: Well, this one has special significance.",
        "Hope: It sure does for mom.",
        "Wyatt: For Katie, too, I imagine.",
        "Ridge: What does that mean?",
        "Wyatt: With...Brooke off the grid, I mean, maybe dad and Katie can put something back together again.",
        "Ridge: Katie doesn't want him. That I'm sure of.",
        "Pam: And I'm sure that there is a man out there for Katie. Somebody really great. Like you, Ridge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I know I'm being presumptuous, but, Katie, this could be a turning point for us.",
        "Katie: Brooke, wouldn't you rather have Hope or -- or Donna?",
        "Brooke: No one's been more instrumental in Ridge and me reuniting than you.",
        "Katie: I really think you're giving me far too much credit.",
        "Brooke: Uh, I was there when you practically demanded that Ridge go back to me.",
        "Katie: That's because he was gonna go back to you anyway.",
        "Brooke: No, I don't think so. He's been acting kind of strange the last few weeks.",
        "Katie: You two always find your way back to each other eventually.",
        "Brooke: Still, you were the catalyst. Look, I know we have some issues, but it would be huge for us if you were there, standing right by me, while I'm recommitting my life to Ridge. And I know Ridge would appreciate that, too.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Brooke, but I can't.",
        "Brooke: Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Good. We have a minute. I-I just have to ask you, Hope, what are you doing? After everything that Wyatt and his mother have done to you, how can you trust them?",
        "Hope: Well, I don't trust Quinn.",
        "Pam: Well, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, honey.",
        "Hope: No, no, no, no, no. It's not like that. He's not. I promise. It's okay.",
        "Pam: He faked a robbery, and then he lied about it. He didn't tell you squat. And on t--",
        "Wyatt: And then he took half the credit. Magazine covers, reporters, cameras, the prince of the internet. You know, I hate myself every day for it. Luckily...she doesn't.",
        "Pam: Well, I just don't think that Liam would ever have done something like this.",
        "Wyatt: No, he wouldn't, Pam. 'Cause he's a good man. And he deserves a good woman. And I hope he finds that.",
        "Pam: [Chuckles] You're exactly like your father. Excuse me.",
        "Wyatt: What'd I say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Brooke and Ridge are getting married?",
        "Bill: So they say.",
        "Quinn: When?",
        "Bill: Tomorrow.",
        "Quinn: So what's the plan?",
        "Bill: There isn't any damn plan.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Wow, you are taking this rather hard.",
        "Bill: This isn't what she wants.",
        "Quinn: Of course not. How could she possibly?",
        "Bill: Are you through? Because I'm through with you.",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. You're acting like a love-sick teenager. Despite what you think, Bill, you don't have control over everything.",
        "Bill: This isn't about control.",
        "Quinn: So what is it about? Love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So what do you want? Do you want the history, the entire history? How much time do you got?",
        "Maya: Take a few months, I hear.",
        "Carter: Just give me the abridged version. What is it about that woman, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Uh-huh. Well, the first time I met Brooke, she was catering a party at my parents' house. I laid eyes on her, and... everything changed forever. And it's not because of her beauty or her sensuality. She's got all that. But there's something else. She's got... an aura about her. She's got an energy. Brooke lives from her heart. And that's why she is irresistible to all men. She looks at you, and all your defenses fall away. To this day, the only time I can't put words together is when I look into her eyes, and I just -- I get -- I get lost. And she looks at you and... she owns your soul. And you want that because... you want to be the one. You want to be the one. Anyway, it's been like that from the first day. Never changed... until recently.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm sorry.",
        "Brooke: You're still hurting.",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Brooke: I wish there was something I could say or do. You know Bill is not a part of my life anymore.",
        "Katie: I know. I-it's more than that.",
        "Brooke: I know it is. I failed you as a sister, something you would never do to me.",
        "Katie: Brooke, no one's perfect.",
        "Brooke: That's true. And I made a mistake. A mistake that you would never make. I will never forgive myself for that, having feelings for your husband. But I'm trying to get past it. And I'm trying to be loyal, and I have been ever since Bill conned you. I'm gonna try to be as true to you as you have been to me. [Sighs] Look, I-I know I don't have any right to ask you this, but I'm asking anyway. You wanted to reunite my family, Ridge and me. And I want you there with us, and Ridge would want that, too.",
        "Katie: Ridge -- Ridge doesn't need to have me there.",
        "Brooke: He needs you there, and I need you there. We all do. Please, you are the symbol of everything that is great, that is honest and pure. And I want you there, standing right by my side while I recommit my life to Ridge. It's very important to me.",
        "Katie: Why? Why? Brooke, you - you have your life back with Ridge. R.J. has his family back. I can't add anything to that.",
        "Brooke: Yes. Yes, you can. You can, and you will. Please, Katie, do this for me. Do this for all of us.",
        "Katie: Trust me, Brooke, I am the last person you want standing up for you at your wedding.",
        "Brooke: Because you haven't forgiven me yet. But you will, Katie. You will forgive me when you're ready. It's just that weddings are special, and it's like the start of a new beginning. And thanks to you, Ridge and I have reunited, and it would just be really nice if you could share it with us.",
        "Katie: Brooke, I really think that you're asking a lot of me.",
        "Brooke: It's not just for me. It's for you, too. It would be really important if you could see that Ridge is really the only man that I've ever wanted to be with.",
        "Katie: I don't need to see that.",
        "Brooke: No, I-I think you do need to see that. Ridge is the love of my life, and it's not Bill Spencer.",
        "Katie: I know. I know.",
        "Brooke: Well, then why are you resisting? It certainly seems like you are. Do I need to get Ridge over here to plead my case?",
        "Katie: No. Please, no.",
        "Brooke: Just say yes. Just say you'll do this for me. If you ever want to be sisters again and have that bond, then this could take us there. Don't you want that? I do. I really want that. [Sighs] So just...say you'll do it. Just say you'll be my matron of honor. [Chuckles] Say it'll be my wedding present.",
        "Katie: Okay. Of course.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Okay?! Yes?! So you'll do it?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: That one's for Pam.",
        "Hope: Oh, come on! I'm sorry about her.",
        "Wyatt: It's okay. She cares about you. I get it.",
        "Hope: I can't fault her for that.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. It's good you have all these people protecting you.",
        "Hope: It is. I need it. I mean, who palms a diamond? Who palms a zillion- dollar diamond? What are you, Danny Ocean?",
        "Wyatt: Gah!",
        "Hope: You think you're James Bond?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. It seemed like the right thing to do. But, hey, at least we can laugh about it.",
        "Hope: Oh, who's laughing?",
        "Wyatt: No? Too soon?",
        "Hope: Oh, I still intend to talk to your mother.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you better not talk to my mother. What are you gonna talk to her about?",
        "Hope: You know, there are a lot of stories, a lot of talk going around about your mom being, you know, crazy.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, who isn't, though? I mean, we're all a little nutty.",
        "Hope: Yeah, but...",
        "Wyatt: Okay, yeah, her a little more than most. I mean, she's a single mother working to survive. She raised me all by herself. I think she deserves a get- out-of-jail-free card.",
        "Hope: You think she was ever waiting for your dad to come back?",
        "Wyatt: There is no one that she hates more than my father. But it's weird, though. 'Cause there's no one she loves more, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Oh, my God. You're in love with her.",
        "Bill: I really don't need any melodrama at the moment.",
        "Quinn: No, what you need is Brooke, but Brooke is about to marry Ridge. And that makes you feel...how?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Ridge and Brooke -- something out of a fairy tale, huh?",
        "Carter: More like an epic. [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: And you get to hitch those two tomorrow.",
        "Carter: Yeah, I just want to do it right.",
        "Maya: You'll be great.",
        "Carter: It's just not an ordinary wedding. You heard the man. It's like... it's like he's one with her.",
        "Maya: Because he is.",
        "Carter: It's kind of like how I am with you.",
        "Maya: Do I own your soul when you look at me?",
        "Carter: Baby girl, you own my soul, my heart, and everything south of it.",
        "Maya: Oh, I love when you talk geography. You are gonna do such a great job tomorrow. And I will be so proud of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Katie: Thank you for coming.",
        "Ridge: It sounded important.",
        "Katie: There's something you should know. I'm going to be there tomorrow when you marry my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I guess I should have seen it coming. Just never occurred to me. I knew. I just knew that we were meant to be together.",
        "Quinn: Well, obviously you weren't, because you aren't. I don't mean to sound trite, Bill, but there is someone else out there for you.",
        "Bill: I don't want someone else. And I don't need someone else. I'm good just the way I am. I want to share that with Brooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Were you with Katie?",
        "Brooke: Yes. I asked her to be my matron of honor.",
        "Hope: Oh! What did she say?",
        "Brooke: I really had to sell her on it.",
        "Hope: Has she still not forgiven you?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I don't know. I-I think it's -- it seems to be something else.",
        "Hope: Okay. Uh... maybe she's jealous.",
        "Brooke: Jealous?",
        "Hope: Yeah. I mean, you're gonna end up with this storybook ending, and she's not.",
        "Brooke: No, she seemed really happy that Ridge and I were gonna be together.",
        "Hope: Okay. So you convinced her.",
        "Brooke: I wasn't gonna leave there until she agreed. It's really important that we move forward with our lives.",
        "Hope: I think your wedding is the perfect opportunity.",
        "Brooke: Yes, me too. That's what I told her. We'd be there with the whole family, Katie and Ridge right next to me. She would know that I was over Bill, and she would see me profess my love for Ridge. This will have an impact on her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Brooke asked me to be matron of honor.",
        "Ridge: Oh, well, it sounds like you agreed.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I didn't at first. I didn't want to. She started talking about family and loyalty and... she thinks I'm this standard bearer of decency.",
        "Ridge: Well, you kind of are.",
        "Katie: No, I'm not. I'm not. Which is why I didn't think I should be there.",
        "Ridge: Hey, you're family. We need you there. I need you there.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Ridge: 'Cause I don't want you to pull away.",
        "Katie: I have to.",
        "Ridge: I can't let that happen. So I need you to be there.",
        "Katie: Probably right. I should see it.",
        "Ridge: Well, you've seen it. There's been a lot of them.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I've come to most of your weddings.",
        "Ridge: There's too many to count, really.",
        "Katie: You and Brooke are meant for each other. No one could argue with that. You've overcome so much. And tomorrow will be the start of something new and exciting, and -- and I'll be there. I'll be a part of it. A brand-new beginning. That's what I want for you."
