{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7018 ~ Bill & Katie celebrate their reunion; Quinn struggles to understand why Deacon remains in Brooke's life."], "Recap": ["Carter welcomes the guests to Katie and Bill's wedding. Brooke is obvious when she cutely waves to the crowd and then tells herself that here they go again. Quinn comes in from the workshop and Deacon hands her a cup of coffee. He says he could get jealous that she is spending so much time down there. She quips someone has to pay the bills as his pretty face sure isn't. They end up talking about Bill and Katie's wedding and Brooke being alone now. Quinn wonders if she came on to Deacon. Deacon is not sure she can handle being alone right now. Quinn points out that Brooke went to Milan to give Bill and Katie a chance so it's too late for her to boo-hoo now. He also tells Quinn that it seems Brooke is drinking more now and is teetering right there on the edge. Quinn says she knows about being on the outside looking in. Deacon says but it is different with Brooke. She has always had two things going for her \u0096 her men and her family and right now she has neither.", "At the wedding Liam and Wyatt give two readings. Wyatt's is about forgiveness by Ghandi and he thanks Bill and Katie for teaching all of them how to forgive and says their strength inspires all. A couple of times during the ceremony Brooke speaks to herself out loud. Katie and Bill say their I do's and exchanges rings. Carter pronounces them husband and wife and Bill kisses his bride. Quinn walks back into the living room in her sexy sleek black leather outfit with whip. Deacon chuckles so this is his punishment. She says he reminded her not to worry what other people think and this is his reward. Brooke is happy for Bill and Katie and she grabs another two flutes of champagne but Katie thinks one is for her and takes it. Actually she realizes Brooke is celebrating a little too much and hopes she is not just numbing herself. Brooke declares that no, she is just happy for Katie. RJ is away at school so she is allowed to have a drink every now and then. Katie and Bill feed each other cake and then dance. Wyatt and Liam have something to say on Will's behalf. Today was a special day that his family got back together. Brooke wants to make a toast as well but needs another drink. She drinks to her beautiful sister and knows this is going to be a great year. She giggles that she will have one too. Katie can't help but look a little worried."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Brooke: Hello!", "Carter: Are you ready?", "Brooke: Here we go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Truck beeping ]", "Deacon: You know, I got to tell you something. If I was the jealous type, i might be a little miffed about now.", "Quinn: Miffed?", "Deacon: Yeah, you've been down at that workshop for hours banging away at something.", "Quinn: Somebody's got to make a living. Can't both live off of your pretty face.", "Deacon: Hey, listen, if you want to take your frustration out on something, honey, I am right here.", "Quinn: [ Chuckles ] I'm not frustrated.", "Deacon: Wait a sec. Come on. Are you honestly telling me that you're not thinking just a little bit about bill and katie's wedding?", "Quinn: No.", "Deacon: You're gonna tell me it doesn't sting just a little?", "Quinn: [ Laughs ]", "Deacon: I mean, this is a guy that you were so into. You were gonna, you know, you were gonna build a whole life with him. Now he's chosen to settle down with another woman.", "Quinn: [ Laughs ] You know, maybe I'm the one who should be jealous, because obviously you have me confused with brooke.", "Deacon: That's funny, because brooke says it doesn't bother her, either.", "Quinn: Well, brooke may not be telling the truth, but I am.", "Deacon: What makes you so sure brooke's lying?", "Quinn: Why do you care?", "Deacon: She's -- she's lonely.", "Quinn: She came onto you?", "Deacon: No! You know that if she did, i wouldn't, you know, d--", "Quinn: Right. Right. But she did something that's worrying you.", "Deacon: She's just -- you know, she's just not herself right now.", "Quinn: She went to milan. She left bill. It's a little too late for her to boo-hoo about it now.", "Deacon: No, listen, she -- she wants this to work out with katie. She did the right thing giving this family another shot. I just -- you know, I just think she's not used to feeling this way.", "Quinn: [ Scoffs ] About what? Doing the right thing?", "Deacon: No. Being on her own. Being without a man. I-I just -- I don't know that she knows how to handle it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: Welcome. Thank you all for being here to witness and celebrate the official reunion of bill and katie as husband and wife.", "Caroline: You okay?", "Carter: Weddings bring families together, but for bill and katie, coming together as a family is what made this wedding possible. With the support of their friends and family in the presence of God, they'll make their vows and once again bind themselves to each other in holy matrimony.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: [ Chuckles ]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: For good this time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Look, I empathize with brooke.", "Deacon: It's funny. Why don't I feel that?", "Quinn: Because you want me to feel sorry for her, and I don'T.", "Deacon: Okay, look, I didn't want to say this, but I'm a little worried about her. She's -- she's drinking more than I remember.", "Quinn: A lot?", "Deacon: She's not on a bender, but, you know, when she gets down, her decision-making process gets a little, you know, you pour alcohol on that...", "Quinn: She can find herself standing two stories up on a ledge...like I did? Till you pulled me back.", "Deacon: Look, she's teetering right now, and I just don't think it would take a lot to push her over.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: Preparing for this ceremony, I was thinking about new beginnings and fresh starts. But talking to bill and katie showed me something else. Even though they were separated for a while and their relationship changed, it didn't end. Like a river temporarily diverting into two streams, they remain connected at their source. And now they come together again.", "Brooke: Going with the flow.", "Carter: Exactly. Moving forward as a couple and a family with the blessings and support of everyone who cares about them. In that spirit, bill's sons, liam and wyatt, will give us two readings.", "Liam: Guess I'm up. Right. [ Sighs ] Guys... \"clothe yourselves with compassion and kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Bear with one another, and if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive as the lord forgave you. And above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.\"", "Brooke: Cool.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Um [Clears throat] So, I found a quote that, uh, kind of stuck with me, and I thought it would be appropriate for today. It's from gandhi.", "Katie: [ Chuckles ]", "Wyatt: Um, \"forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.\" And I got to say, there's a lot of strength in this room today, especially up here at this altar. My dad and katie getting back together wasn't inevitable, wasn't fate. It was a decision. And it took a lot of courage to even consider it. Thank you, guys, for showing us the beauty and the power of forgiveness. Um... your strength inspires us all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I know that feeling, outside looking in.", "Deacon: No, brooke's been there before. This is -- this is different.", "Quinn: How?", "Deacon: I think in brooke's life, there's two things that are important to her. It's her men and her family. And when she doesn't have one, she can always rely on the other. Right now, she doesn't have anyone to turn to.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: Bill, katie, join hands, please. And declare your intentions to be joined in marriage. Katie, do you take bill to be your husband, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, forsaking all others, as long as you live?", "Katie: I do.", "Carter: Bill, do you take katie to be your wife, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, forsaking all others --", "Brooke: Me.", "Carter: Forsaking all others as long as you live?", "Bill: I do.", "Carter: You may now exchange rings and make your personal vows to one another.", "Brooke: Oh, my God. I forgot the rings.", "Katie: Brooke.", "Carter: No, no, it's okay. I have them. I have them right here.", "Brooke: [ Chuckles ]", "[ Both laugh ]", "Katie: I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and as my promise to you. My promise.... no, that's not what I want to say. I had something planned, but it's not right. I don't want to make you a promise. Because promises are too easy to break. I am capable of great things. But I'm also capable of making big mistakes. But I think that one thing that I have been consistently capable of is loving you. [ Chuckles ] I have always loved you. You are my friend. And you are my frustration. You are my happiness. And you are my hurt. You are my home. You are my heart. I won't make you a promise. I won'T. But I can honestly tell you that I will cherish who we are together and I will fight for it and I will protect it. And I will love and accept everything we've been through because it has brought us to this place. And we are smarter and stronger than we've ever been. And I can't wait to see what comes next.", "[ Chuckles ]", "Bill: My katie. I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and my devotion to you. But I'm not gonna make any big promises, either. A great marriage isn't based on promises. It's based on follow-through, and that is what you're going to get from me because that's what you deserve. You're too generous and you're too beautiful and you're too damn smart to settle for anything less. I said something when i proposed. And I'm going to say it again in front of all these people. I want you, katie. I want our family. I want our life together. Nothing means more to me. And I give you this ring so that you will never, ever forget that.", "Carter: Whoa, hey. H-hold on. We're not at that part yet.", "[ Laughter ]", "Bill: Way to break up a moment, Carter. Just get with the program, man. Get it out.", "Carter: With the power vested in me, it's my sincerest pleasure to pronounce you husband and wife.", "Bill: Yeah.", "Katie: [ Laughs ]", "Bill: That's what I'm talking about. [ Applause ] I love you.", "Katie: I love you, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Leather cracks ]", "Deacon: Now that's what I'm talking about. [ Laughing ] Oh, man. All right, let me see if I got this straight. So, I tell you that I'm concerned about brooke, and this is my punishment?", "Quinn: Oh, no, no, no, no. This -- this is your reward.", "Deacon: For what?", "Quinn: For reminding me that I need to stop worrying about O.P.P. Other people's problems. Now you need to be reminded... that brooke can take care of herself.", "Deacon: Hmm.", "Quinn: I am going to take care of you.", "Deacon: [ Laughs ] No, baby girl, I'm gonna take good care of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Glasses clink ]", "Caroline: I'm gonna go congratulate my uncle.", "Ridge: Okay.", "Caroline: You're coming with me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Are those for us?", "Brooke: Yes. Our own private toast.", "[ Chuckles ]", "Katie: How about...", "Brooke: [ Squeals ]", "Katie: ...We talk instead? Are you okay?", "Brooke: Yeah, I'm happy for you and bill.", "Katie: You sure about that?", "Brooke: I love you, katie. I love bill. I love will. And all of you are together again, and that's incredible.", "Katie: Okay. I couldn't help but notice that you're a little...", "Brooke: [ Laughs ] I'm fine. I'm just...celebrating.", "[ Chuckles ]", "Katie: No second thoughts?", "Brooke: No! No. I'm -- I'm free. R.J.'S off at school. And -- and a girl's allowed to have a drink now and then, don't you think?", "Katie: Yes. Yes. Absolutely. It's a party. Just want to make sure you're having a good time and you're not trying to numb yourself.", "Brooke: No. No, I... [ Sighs ] I'm really happy. I am. I-I don't regret backing off, allowing you and bill to have this second chance. [ Voice breaking ] I don't -- i don't regret that one bit. And I'm so... I'm so, so proud.", "Katie: I can't tell you how grateful I am. Okay?", "Brooke: Okay. [ Sniffles ]", "Katie: All right. No more of this, all right? Come on back to the party.", "Brooke: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Okay, uh, I have a cake, I have a knife. I just need a wife. Is there a wife available? Oh! There she is. [ Laughter ] Do this together?", "Katie: Yeah, we're gonna do it together.", "Bill: Ready? One, two...", "Katie: Three!", "Bill: Look at that. Teamwork!", "Katie: Wow.", "Brooke: Whoo! Whoo!", "Katie: There you go. Yum. Is it good?", "Bill: It is good. There you go.", "Katie: Ah.", "Bill: Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Applause ]", "[ Soft piano music playing ]", "[ Glass clinking ]", "Wyatt: [ Clears throat ]", "Liam: So, uh, wyatt and i have something to say.", "Wyatt: On will's behalf.", "Katie: Oh.", "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. We do. Um, today -- today was a very special day for will, albeit one that he slept through.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "[ Laughter ]", "Liam: Today was the day his mom and dad got back together.", "Wyatt: Thank you for giving him the family that his big brothers always wished for him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Glasses clinks ]", "[ Glass clinking ]", "[ Laughter ]", "Brooke: I'd like to make a toast, too. Uh, I think I need another drink before I do.", "Donna: Do you?", "Brooke: Shh! Shh. Beautiful... Sis. And to her husband, who she loves more than anything in this world, bill spencer. [ Laughs ] This is gonna be such a great year for you guys. It's gonna be a great year for me, too. And I just -- I can't be more proud.
