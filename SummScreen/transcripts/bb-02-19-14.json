        "As Brooke is laying out her gown and her flowers on the bed, Rick walks in and says someone looks happy. He gives her a hug and says he could not be more thrilled for her when she says she is marrying the man of her dreams. She tells him he has made sure everything was perfect right down to the last detail, private and simple. She says she always had faith this day would come. Eric is adjusting Ridge's tie. Ridge looks at his mom's portrait and quips that his dad is still trying to dress him. Eric tells him that he is proud of him and he always knew that he and Brooke would end up together. How could anybody not be happy on this day? Both Ridge and Katie separately think of their times reciting poetry. Liam interrupts Katie and the first words out of his mouth is that it is not too late; she can still stop this wedding from happening. She doesn't want him to say that, although he says it is the truth. She and Ridge have feelings for each other and this wedding should not be happening. Ridge wants her, not Brooke so it is up to Katie. She tells him that he is being ridiculous as they are meant for each other. Being with Ridge would just cause Katie more pain and she would destroy a family. That is what Brooke did to her and she will not do that to her. He says she has to look out for herself and quit living in her sister's shadow. And he's only telling her this because he lost Hope temporarily and he doesn't want that to happen also to Katie. They are ideal for each other. She won't listen to any more. She says she has to think about RJ. She won't take away his family. She is going to be the good sister and go to that wedding and stand up for Brooke and support her and Ridge.",
        "Eric tells Carter that he will do fine officiating; he always does. Hope tries to reassure Wyatt's fears about his dad being all alone today. But he says any day with her is a good day. She says good answer and kisses him. Donna and Caroline give an orange juice cheer to Brooke and they all giggle when Hope joins them. Rick shakes Ridge's hand and welcomes him back into the family. They've been together a long time and he trusts that he knows what he is doing. Liam comes home and is scared silly by Bill who is walking around snacking on some snickerdoodles. Bill's in a foul mood because of Brooke's wedding. Liam wants to make sure he's not going to go do something stupid. Bill storms this is not easy for him, but no he will settle down, but that son of a bitch is marrying his woman. Liam says he knows; Bill is not the only one feeling that way. Eric finds Wyatt and invites him upstairs to see something that he thinks he will be very interested in. Wyatt is intrigued. Katie comes into the Forrester mansion and sees Ridge on the terrace and heads straight there. Ridge smiles and says hello to her. He says he is glad she is here. She says congratulations; she is glad he is marrying Brooke. She's trying to be a good sister. He says he is and Brooke has no idea how loyal she has been. Upstairs Eric opens the safe and tells the group that he has a surprise. He brings out three large trays of elegant pieces of jewelry from Stephanie's collection. Wyatt is blown away and says they are some rare, remarkable jewels from some of the most renowned designers in history. Eric picks out a gorgeous diamond broach and gives it to Brooke. He says he thinks Stephanie would have wanted her to have it and so does he. She is touched and thanks him. Katie joins the group and there are more group giggles. Katie tells Brooke that she makes a beautiful bride. They've been through a lot but they managed to come through it. She tears up when she says she knows Brooke and Ridge are gonna be so happy ad she wants that for them. Brooke says she knows how lucky she is to have another chance with Ridge and she is going to love him for the rest of her life. She thanks Katie for all she did. Bill changes his mind and tells Liam that he is homeless, no job so what else does he have to lose. He's going over there right now. Liam stops him and says if that wedding does not take place as it should it can't be because of them. Everyone takes their place. Katie walks into the foyer and both she and Ridge lock eyes and don't stop until she reaches the altar. Then Brooke follows with all eyes on her."

        "Brooke: Oh, I'm sure the matron of honor will be here very shortly.",
        "Hope: Ohh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I have no idea what you're suggesting, Liam.",
        "Liam: Katie, I'm looking right at it -- the pain, the longing, the incredibly strong feelings you have for Ridge.",
        "Katie: Don't even say that, please!",
        "Liam: Say what -- the truth? That this wedding is bad for everyone and you shouldn't let it happen?",
        "Katie: It's not up to me.",
        "Liam: Uh, you know, it is up to you, because Ridge wants you, not Brooke.",
        "Katie: You're being ridiculous. Ridge is marrying my sister.",
        "Liam: Yeah, Katie, because you told him to.",
        "Katie: I don't have that kind of power over him, and haven't you heard? All men want Brooke.",
        "Liam: Okay, that is such a crock.",
        "Katie: Being with Ridge would just set me up for more pain, and I would destroy a family. That's what Brooke did to me. I'm not gonna do it to her.",
        "Liam: I can't believe you're gonna let the man you love marry your sister.",
        "Katie: Liam, please. Stop!",
        "Liam: You know, when I talked to Ridge, he did the same thing you're doing, right? He tried to convince me that he wants this wedding to happen, but he doesn't -- not really. I mean, he's trying to do the right thing, just like you.",
        "Katie: Ridge and Brooke belong together.",
        "Liam: No. You're just -- see? You're conditioned to believe that because it's been drilled into your head since you were a kid, but what about now, Katie? What about your future? You got to go after what you want. You got to stop sacrificing everything and living in your sister's shadow.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Listen. Listen. I'm only telling you this because I lost Hope -- temporarily lost Hope -- and I don't want to see it happen to you. When I look at you and Ridge, I see two people who are so ideal for each other --",
        "Katie: Okay. Okay. All right. I don't want to listen to any more of this.",
        "Liam: 'Cause you know it's true?",
        "Katie: It doesn't matter if it's true. I have to think about the big picture. I have to think about R.J. I'm not gonna take his family away from him.",
        "Liam: Katie [Chuckles] Katie, you have to know there's no guarantee it'll even last.",
        "Katie: I'm not gonna be the reason it doesn't.",
        "Liam: Okay. Let's assume that Ridge is settling, and I think that's a pretty fair assumption. This is not gonna work out for anyone, including R.J. Ridge wants you! Stop over thinking it! Go with your gut!",
        "Katie: Oh, I should follow my heart to disaster, like my sister?",
        "Liam: Why don't you try it? See what happens.",
        "Katie: No, Liam. I don't want to hurt anyone. I am going to be a good sister. I am going to go to that wedding. I'm gonna stand up for Brooke, and I am gonna support her marriage to Ridge.",

        "Carter: Yeah. I wasn't nervous before, but now I am.",
        "Maya: Sorry.",
        "Carter: No, no. I think I'm good. I came up with something kind of out of the ordinary, but I'm feeling it. It's romantic.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Now, you know I've loved your mom for a long time, Rick.",
        "Rick: I know. I just want to make sure that you're in it for the long haul this time.",
        "Ridge: I wouldn't be marrying her if I didn't think it was a possibility.",
        "Rick: But you guys -- you've been through a lot together, but I trust you know what you're doing. Welcome back to the family, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Thanks for being my best man.",

        "Hope: [Giggles]",
        "Donna: It's true. You're one of those annoying people who couldn't possibly look bad.",
        "Hope: Which is why we all hate you so much. Which lipstick do you want to go with?",
        "Brooke: Actually, that one.",
        "Hope: Perfect. I love it. Good choice.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",

        "Bill: Why did I scare you? Forget I live here?",
        "Liam: No. That's impossible. I'm just distracted.",

        "Carter: I'm not telling you. It's got to be a surprise.",
