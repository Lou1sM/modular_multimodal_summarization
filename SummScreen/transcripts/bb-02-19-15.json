    "Recap": [
        "Rick tells Maya that he is going to need courage today as he got a text that his dad is coming back today. Neither expected him back so soon and he has not told him they are in the house and her portrait is on the wall. Caroline senses that Ridge is in a good mood and he tells her about his dad coming back early. Perhaps he has gotten wind of things and wants to come oversee. Liam is with Ivy when Steffy calls and says she is thinking about his plan and would like to talk. He invites her over. He tells Ivy but he still can not get a read on Steffy over the phone so they will have to wait and see if she is in or out if she won't go behind Ridge's back. Eric says his trip was a real adventure. His brother is a wild man and he'd had enough and he thought it important that he be here at FC. Eric says they can talk about the trip later as now he wants to hear what has been going on around here. He knows it was a lot to juggle but always stay true to company and family. Rick says he has done some things that Eric probably would not approve of and the last thing he wants to do is disappoint him. Ivy tells Liam that she is not worried about them. She pretty well knows as Steffy spelled it out that she wants to come back and run the company and get back with Liam. So she will leave them alone to work this out.",
        "Caroline tells Ridge that his dad lives for FC so he will want to come back and run things. Maya pops in to let him know that Rick is with Eric now. Ridge thinks that is good and he tells her that her and Rick's little ride is now over. Nervously Rick tries to explain a few things that he is ashamed of and hopes his dad will forgive him. Things like moving into his bedroom and taking Stephanie's portrait down and putting up Maya's. And he told Aly and Ivy he was having the guest house remodeled and that was not true. Eric listens without a word but then adds what made Rick think that Eric wasn't keeping tabs on all of this while he was gone. Steffy shows up at Liam's and is in a rocking bikini. She dares him into a ocean swim even though it is 55 degrees. Ridge tells Maya that Rick moved into the house without his dad's permission and he slept in his bed without his permission and he has upset a lot of the employees and Eric is not going to put up with that. Rick says looking back he realizes he went too far and he hopes his dad can overlook it this time as it won't happen again. He and Caroline are over and he is in love with Maya. Eric shows him the bottom line of the sales figures. These first figures with Rick as CEO, a job well done. Steffy and Liam rush back in and towel off. She says she feels great, better than she remembered. But she says she enjoys other things more. She kisses him quickly. Ridge tells Maya that he thinks Rick and his lead model will be out of a job by the end of the day. Rick is happy that his dad is not mad at him. Eric says he can stay put as he has earned all of this. He can even stay in the main house. He is CEO now and he is doing it well. Eric will move into the guest house. He is happy for Rick with a woman that supports him. He wants him to know he may not have felt his unconditional love before but he is proud of him, loves him and he has his support now. Rick gives him a hug and says he will make him proud."

        "Maya: You seem worried.",
        "Rick: Well, there's a lot that he doesn't know, like us living in the main house and your portrait above the fireplace.",

        "Ridge: That's what you do to me.",

        "Ridge: You should take most of the credit. Oh, and I got some good news this morning.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Ridge: Dad's coming home early.",
        "Caroline: He is? I thought that he wasn't due back for a couple weeks.",

        "Caroline: Well, I don't blame him for rushing home, then.",
        "Ridge: Like I said, good news. Maybe Rick's days as C.E.O. are numbered.",

        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Liam: Five -- five more minutes.",
        "Ivy: Mnh-mnh. I have to go.",
        "Liam: 10 more minutes? 15? I can negotiate.",
        "Ivy: I have to go to work.",
        "Liam: Oh! You're killing me! I really think you should stay.",
        "Ivy: Well, there is nothing I would rather do than just stay here with you all day.",

        "Ivy: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Liam: We should do that more often.",

        "Ivy: Well, I mean, the wedding was beautiful yesterday, and Katie looked absolutely gorgeous.",

        "Ivy: Well, you'll find out soon enough.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. I-I mean, I hope she's on board. I just -- I don't know if she's willing to go behind Ridge's back.",

        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "Caroline: So, does Rick know?",

        "Caroline: Oh. That's why you're so happy.",
        "Ridge: No, I'm happy because I get to wake up with...all of that.",
        "Caroline: Oh. I don't blame you for being excited about that. [Chuckles] And I think if anyone can get through to Rick, it's Eric.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. Yeah, maybe he'll see what he's been up to since he's been away from the company.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, he's not gonna be happy. There's no way that he's gonna tolerate Rick's behavior.",
        "Ridge: So, maybe there will be some changes around here. Maybe I'll be C.E.O. for more than five minutes.",

        "Maya: How was your trip?",
        "Eric: It was a real adventure.",
        "Rick: What, uh, made you cut it so short? Let me guess. You couldn't keep up with uncle John.",
        "Eric: My brother's a wild man, boundless energy. But, uh, I'd had enough. I thought it was very important for me to be here.",
        "Maya: Well, it's lovely to see you, Eric, but I'm sure you two have some catching up to do. I'll leave you alone.",

        "Eric: Running a company is complicated.",
        "Rick: It's been rewarding. It's been a lot more challenging than I ever expected it to be.",
        "Eric: Just need to stay true to yourself, to the family, to the company. It's a lot to juggle.",
        "Rick: Dad, I've, uh... I've done some things. Uh... I've made some choices that you might not agree with. I just... I just didn't know you were coming back home today.",
        "Eric: Spur-of-the-moment decision. Caught you off guard?",

        "Liam: Yeah, me, too. I mean, I hope she sees how crucial it is we take control of Forrester.",
        "Ivy: Well, I mean, I-I trust you're doing the best thing for everyone.",
        "Liam: Hey, you're okay, right? With me collaborating with Steffy?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I mean, considering the fact that she's still in love with you and she wants to come back here and make things work out between you two. I mean, that's what she pretty much spelled out to me.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Sorry about that.",
        "Ivy: It's okay. I'm actually -- I'm not worried. I feel really comfortable about us.",

        "Liam: Bye.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Just because dad's coming home doesn't mean he's coming back to work.",
        "Caroline: You don't think?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. I've been thinking about it. Maybe this is not what he wants anymore. Maybe he doesn't want to be here.",
        "Caroline: Ridge, Eric lives for Forrester. If he's in L.A., he's gonna want to be involved with the company.",
        "Ridge: Yeah? I hope so. We could use his help.",
        "Caroline: When he sees what an awful C.E.O. Rick has been, he's gonna have your back.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Maya: Sorry. Hope I'm not interrupting anything.",
        "Ridge: Of course you are. What do you need?",
        "Maya: I just thought you should know that Eric's back from his trip and he and Rick are catching up in his office.",
        "Ridge: Okay, well, that's, uh, that's good. About time.",
        "Caroline: You do realize what this means, right? Your little \"king and queen\" bit, it's over. You can kiss that goodbye.",
        "Maya: If you are insinuating that Rick and I are gonna lose control of this company --",
        "Ridge: No, I don't think she's insinuating anything. I think she's telling you that my dad is back and your little ride at Forrester is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: You're concerned?",
        "Rick: I just, uh... I don't know how you'll feel.",
        "Eric: Try me.",
        "Rick: Uh... after you left... I decided to move Maya and myself into the main house. In your bedroom. And since you weren't living there, I-I decided to take Stephanie's portrait off the wall. And I replaced it with a portrait of Maya. [Sighs] I just... I didn't get rid of Stephanie's portrait, obviously. I wrapped it up. It's in a safe place. It's in climate control.",
        "Eric: Anything else?",
        "Rick: I told Aly and Ivy that the guest house needed remodeling, which is why we had to move into the main house. That's not happening. I made that up. [Sighs] Dad, I've done some things I'm just... I'm ashamed of. I just hope that you can understand or...eventually forgive me.",
        "Eric: You think I didn't know this? You thought I wouldn't be keeping tabs on everything that was happening here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Hey! You decent?",
        "Liam: Hey. Yeah. Come on in.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Busy working, I see.",
        "Liam: Yes, I -- whoa! [Chuckles] Somebody's dressed for the beach.",
        "Steffy: Well, you know what I miss most about L.A.? The ocean. There's nothing quite like it. So, how was the wedding?",
        "Liam: It was nice. Yeah, it was really nice. Um... Brooke got a little tipsy.",
        "Steffy: Really?",
        "Liam: Yeah, she did. It was -- it was fine. I mean, it was okay. She was more fun, actually.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] You, uh, bring Ivy as your date?",
        "Liam: You think I wouldn't?",
        "Steffy: Oh, I was just wondering.",
        "Liam: She's not here right now. She's at work.",
        "Steffy: Mm. Figured.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: So, your dad and Katie.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Giving it a go one more time, huh?",
        "Liam: Mm-hmm. Last trip to the altar. This is it for them.",
        "Steffy: Liam.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Steffy: This is your dad we're talking about, okay? [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: I know, I know, I know. But I really think he's done playing around.",
        "Steffy: I'm surprised he hasn't confiscated this house yet.",
        "Liam: Okay, why does everybody say that? It's my house. I live here. What's he gonna do? Kick me out?",
        "Steffy: I would if I were him.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Oh, nice. Thank you. Thanks.",
        "Steffy: Well, the view. The break right there.",
        "Liam: Yeah. It's pretty incredible.",
        "Steffy: I miss swimming in the ocean. Paris -- we only have one river, and no one goes swimming in it. Well, except Ivy.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: What? We should go for a swim.",
        "Liam: You mean now?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Why not?",
        "Liam: Uh, 'cause it's 55 degrees.",
        "Steffy: So what? It'll be good for you. It gets the heart racing. Why don't we just go for a swim?",
        "Liam: Really?",
        "Steffy: What? Are you scared?",
        "Liam: Am I --",
        "Steffy: Uh-huh.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] All right. Okay. Fine. I'm on board, but --",
        "Steffy: Yes!",
        "Liam: I'm not kidding. This better score me points --",
        "Steffy: Glorious, freezing-cold ocean, here we come. I don't want to hear it. [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Loco.",
        "Steffy: Uh-huh. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I got to ask you something. Do you really think my dad will support Rick when he finds out what he's done? Everybody wants him out of here. He's been demeaning the whole staff.",
        "Maya: Rick has had to take a tough stance with certain people.",
        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "Caroline: Not to mention the way that both of you have been treating Aly and Ivy.",
        "Maya: I really don't think that's gonna make a difference.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God. Are you that dense?!",
        "Maya: I believe in Rick. And his father does, too.",
        "Ridge: You moved into my dad's house without his permission. You're sleeping in his bed without his permission. You think he's gonna be okay with that? Probably not. You didn't think this through, did you? You didn't think this day would come. Well, the day is here. Your picture's coming down, the locks are being changed, and Rick will no longer be C.E.O.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You already know?",
        "Eric: More than you realize.",
        "Eric: Rick, this business with the handgun.",
        "Rick: Was completely inexcusable.",
        "Eric: You shot a pistol in an office towards your brother and your wife.",
        "Rick: Dad, I am sorry that I did. I promise you, I will never let that happen again.",
        "Eric: It absolutely will not.",
        "Rick: [Sighs] What Caroline and Ridge did to me... it destroyed me. I know what I did was wrong. And, Dad, I deeply -- I deeply regret it.",
        "Eric: You still have feelings for Caroline?",
        "Rick: Not any good ones.",
        "Eric: Then this relationship with Maya...",
        "Rick: It's real. I love her. Which is why I put the portrait over the fireplace. And I know I should have asked if it was okay. Looking back, I realize maybe I was a bit too eager. Probably went too far.",
        "Eric: This has been a terrible time for this company. I have something I want to show you. The quarterly report.",
        "Rick: I didn't realize that they had already come out.",
        "Eric: These sales figures, this bottom line here... this all goes back to your history at Forrester, your time running International, leading the company here. But this is your first report as C.E.O. Son, these numbers... [Chuckling] If you do these numbers, I can't imagine where you're gonna take this company in the future. Congratulations. Job well done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: That was so good! I mean, don't you feel amazing?",
        "Liam: I don't feel anything! My entire body is numb!",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] Okay, I admit it was a little cold, but it was definitely worth it.",
        "Liam: Ah! Do you want -- do you want, like, a sweatshirt or -- or a blanket or something?",
        "Steffy: No, I actually feel good. Thank you.",
        "Liam: You know you're a little crazy, right?",
        "Steffy: What can I say? It felt incredible. Better than I ever remember. Come on.",
        "Liam: I thought I might die for a second, but yes, I'm glad we did it.",
        "Steffy: Me, too. Like old times.",
        "Liam: You like that. You like swimming in the ocean.",
        "Steffy: I do. But there are some other things that I like more.",
        "Liam: It's good to have you back.",
        "Steffy: It's good to be back.",
        "Liam: I forgot how fun you are.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] How could you ever forget?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: It's not just one thing. It's a laundry list of misconduct. A laundry list.",
        "Maya: That's your opinion. And something tells me that Eric won't agree.",
        "Caroline: Shooting at us with a gun! We could have been killed!",
        "Maya: Eric already knows about that.",
        "Ridge: But he doesn't know everything else. But he's about to find out. And you know what I think? I think Rick and his lead model are gonna be out of a job at the end of the day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You mean that?",
        "Eric: I'm very impressed with everything you've accomplished here.",
        "Rick: You're not mad?",
        "Eric: No, son, I'm not angry with you. Just the opposite. I'm not gonna ask you to leave this office. It's yours. You've earned it. These sales figures prove it.",
        "Rick: I had a feeling that the profits might be up. I never expected this.",
        "Eric: Maybe you can stop worrying so much now. You can loosen your tie a little bit. Smile once in awhile.",
        "Rick: What about all the other stuff?",
        "Eric: Stay in the main house.",
        "Rick: And -- and this thing with Stephanie's portrait?",
        "Eric: I'll put it up in the guest house.",
        "Rick: Why the guest house?",
        "Eric: That's where I'll be staying. You and Maya stay in the master.",
        "Rick: No. No, Dad. That's -- that's your room. You should have your room back.",
        "Eric: The house is too big for me. You and Maya enjoy it.",
        "Rick: I honestly don't know what to say.",
        "Eric: You're C.E.O. now. You're running the ship. You're running it impeccably well. I know it hasn't been easy. Ridge and Caroline betrayed you, but you bounced back. I admire your resilience.",
        "Rick: I owe it all to Maya. She's really been there for me.",
        "Eric: I'm happy for you, son. You have a woman who supports you and a father who does, too. I'm in awe of your strength, Rick. You know that? All the years that I wasn't there, you did not feel my unconditional love. I want you to know you have it now.",
        "Rick: Your loyalty?",
        "Eric: Yes. You have Maya's loyalty, and you have mine. I'm proud of you, son. I love you.",
        "Rick: You... you have no idea what that means to me. I'll do right by you, Dad. I'll make you proud."
