        "In pouring down rain, Phoebe persists in asking Rick for a ride home in his truck. He argues, but she ends up getting in. He then explains that it is her dad; he doesn't want to get her in trouble. She professes it will be okay, that she won't tell him. Rick gives in and starts driving even though he's due at the office. The truck becomes temperamental and needs to cool off; so does Phoebe! Stephanie asks Pam about her mom and she says they looked at condos all afternoon. Stephanie confides that she saw her with Eric the other day and no she does not think they crossed that line, but she does think she is playing on his good nature and sympathy. Pam resents Stephanie's suggestions and reminds her that she spent three decades taking care of her mother's every whim, with no help from Stephanie. Is it too much to ask for her to want something for herself and to get out of Chicago? And poor little good girl, Pam, she has to trick her husband into being the knight in shining armor. She rails she never had any life at all in Chicago and Ann always ran away any man that would have been vaguely interested in her. They will stay in Los Angeles and Stephanie will deal with that. They are family.",
        "At Forrester's, Brooke says she is sorry. Guess she didn't have as much pull with Nick that she thought she had. And the press is saying that Donna is the weak link in his operation. Ridge doesn't want to wait on Nick's input, they need to get going on this. And he'd like to send him back to Europe and get him as far away from Phoebe as he can. Eric presents Thorne, Felicia, Brooke and Ridge his plans. Rick calls and makes his apologies to Brooke about his truck, but not to tell Ridge that Phoebe is with him. He'll only go ballistic. Ridge too gets a phone call from Taylor looking for Phoebe. Brooke has to confess so they won't all be worrying. Ridge makes a big thing about Rick defying him about staying away from his daughter. And he accuses Brooke of protecting her son rather than being honest with him. Alone in the truck with nothing but time on their hands, Phoebe confesses her fears to Rick and they are drawn to each other and kiss."

        "Phoebe: Rick, it's pouring. Let me in the truck.",
        "Rick: I'll call you a cab.",
        "Phoebe: Why can't you just take me home?",
        "Rick: Because it's not a good idea.",
        "Phoebe: Why not? What's the problem?",
        "Rick: There's not a -- it's not a --",
        "Phoebe: Look, eyes on the road. Hands on the wheel. You'll be fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Pammy, is that you?",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Stephanie: Wet out there, right? Come on in. I want to talk to you.",
        "Pam: What? Is everything okay?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, sure. Sit down. How's mom?",
        "Pam: A little worn out. We looked at condos all afternoon.",
        "Stephanie: You didn't sign a lease?",
        "Pam: No. Not yet. But she find something that she liked a lot.",
        "Stephanie: Oh. This is a little delicate. Pam, I saw you and Eric down here in the living room the other day in front of the fire. And you don't have to explain anything. I know what's going on.",
        "Pam: What do you mean? You don't think Eric and I --",
        "Stephanie: Oh, of course not. You're my sister. You'd never cross the line like that. And Eric would never cross the line like that. I realize the two of you have become very close these past two months.",
        "Pam: Well, you went out of town. You asked me to look after him.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, of course I did. And I thank you. You did a beautiful job. And Eric is -- Eric is genuinely fond of you. But I, I don't think that gives you the right to sort of play on his sympathies. And that's what I kind of think you're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: We all know the score.",
        "Thorne: For this to work, we have to go all in.",
        "Ridge: Mortgage our homes, put our personal savings at risk.",
        "Eric: Are you sure this is what you want to do?",
        "Brooke: Yes, it is.",
        "Thorne: It's the only way this business is going to succeed.",
        "Brooke: We have to get into the retail market and sell our own designs.",
        "Felicia: We have been way too dependent on our distributors and it's come back to bite us in the butt.",
        "Ridge: Well, this might do the same thing. But I think it's worth the risk.",
        "Felicia: We don't really have a choice, do we?",
        "Brooke: I really hoped that I could have convinced nick to carry our line in Jackie M.",
        "Eric: He led you to believe that it would.",
        "Brooke: Now, I think it was a ploy. A way to distract us so he could solidify himself in the market. I'm really sorry. I guess I didn't have as much pull with him as I thought I did.",
        "Felicia: Well, nick's on the top of the world now. His plan worked while the fashion press is writing our obituary, he's front page news.",
        "Ridge: Did you see that article, though?",
        "Brooke: Apparently, the media has decided that Donna is the weak link in his operation.",
        "Thorne: They singled her out?",
        "Brooke: Personally.",
        "Felicia: Well, you gotta have a thick skin in this business.",
        "Thorne: And if you don't, you have wear a lot of black leather, right, sis?",
        "Ridge: Where's Rick?",
        "Eric: It's not like him to be late.",
        "Ridge: Well, we can't wait around. If we're going to do this, we got to do it now. We got to move on this.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, we need his input. His international experience could be very valuable to us.",
        "Ridge: Well, let's up that international experience to work then. Send him back to Europe. He can go over there and scout locations. Asia and Australia, too. Keep him as far away from Phoebe as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Okay, let's go.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, please. I can't give you a ride home. I have somewhere to be and I'm late.",
        "Phoebe: You're late for what? Do you have a date?",
        "Rick: No. No, no, I don't have a date at all. I just, I have a meeting. I have a meeting at my office.",
        "Phoebe: Well, good. I mean, you practically drive right by my house on the way there.",
        "Rick: I can't -- I can't do that because I need to be at the office -- I need to be at the office now.",
        "Phoebe: Look, it would take maybe five extra minutes.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, I don't want to get you in trouble. It's your dad, okay? It's your dad. He told me that if I lay a hand on you, that he'd kill me. And I know he's not serious. I know he's not going to kill me, but I don't want him to be mad at you. And if I gave you a ride home, he will be.",
        "Phoebe: Then, I won't tell him. It'll be our secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: It's no secret what's going on. I mean, it's obvious.",
        "Pam: Not to me.",
        "Stephanie: Okay, you expect me to believe that it was Eric's idea and only his idea that you and mother move here to Los Angeles?",
        "Pam: Of course, it was.",
        "Stephanie: And there was no sort of nudge or two from you?",
        "Pam: No!",
        "Stephanie: Okay. All right. I understand. You know, Chicago is -- if I were locked up in that condo with mother, I would have gotten the hell out of there as fast as I could.",
        "Pam: I never suggested any such thing to Eric or to anyone else.",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's because Eric is the kind of person he is. He's very generous. And I mean, a little hint, a little complaint, that's all he would need. You know, he's never seen the grand gesture that he could refuse. And you've given him the perfect opportunity.",
        "Pam: This is so unfair.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it is. You're right. It is unfair. To mother. Her whole life is in Chicago, as is yours.",
        "Pam: Oh. Well, I wouldn't want to stay somewhere where I'm not welcomed.",
        "Stephanie: Oh.",
        "Pam: But Stephanie, I just have to ask you. What kind of life did you think I had back in Chicago? I spend the past three decades taking care of our mother. With no help from you. I gave her everything she needed. I ran every errand. I took her to every appointment. I satisfied her every whim. And now, yeah, you know, maybe you're right. Maybe I do want a little something for myself. Is that so terrible? Don't I deserve it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I know exactly what I want. I want to open a shop in every one of our ten major markets around the world. We'll branch out from there.",
        "Ridge: Major metropolitan areas? The overhead is going to be brutal.",
        "Eric: Well, we'll keep it simple. Minimal. Like a gallery. We'll display each gown as a work of art. And I want every one of our stores to be exactly the same. No matter where you are in the world, you know what to expect for Forrester originals.",
        "Felicia: That's right. We can get retail space on rodeo drive, and worth avenue in palm beach.",
        "Thorne: However, our money would go a lot farther if we would stay off the main drag.",
        "Eric: No. All the other major labels are on Rodeo Drive and that's where we are going to be too. And on worth, and 5th avenue. And --",
        "Brooke: Rick has a friend in commercial real estate in Paris. I bet he could help out.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, if he would ever show up.",
        "Eric: He's probably just stuck in traffic, right?",
        "Brooke: I'm sure he'll be here in minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Oh, come -- I'm sorry. I have no antenna. Hey, Phoebe. What I was talking about before, about your dad -- if you're angry with him --",
        "Phoebe: Oh, I know. He's just trying to protect me.",
        "Rick: He is.",
        "Phoebe: I wasn't thinking about my dad, though.",
        "Rick: What was on your mind?",
        "Phoebe: That guy at karaoke.",
        "Rick: He was pretty bad.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, he was really awful.",
        "Rick: I mean, compared to him, we were like, I don't know, J. Lo and Marc Anthony.",
        "Phoebe: J. Lo, huh?",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Phoebe: Well, you're much cuter than marc Anthony.",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Phoebe: I mean, I think -- I think we did sound pretty good together.",
        "Rick: We did. Absolutely, we did. I thought we sounded better than the first time we sang together.",
        "Phoebe: And then when you came in at the end with the harmony that was really great.",
        "Rick: Exactly. You know, people think duets are just two people singing together. It's more than that. It's -- you're creating something bigger than just the some of its parts. You know, two people really connecting in the middle of a song, and in the music, it's, I don't know, it's magical. At least, that's what I think it is.",
        "Phoebe: Magical.",
        "Rick: Come on.",
        "Phoebe: What happened?",
        "Rick: Nothing. Nothing at all.",
        "Phoebe: Well, it's not starting.",
        "Rick: Just give it a second. It's being just a little fickle right now.",
        "Phoebe: It's just a little old.",
        "Rick: She is overheated, okay? She just needs to cool down for a second.",
        "Phoebe: She?",
        "Rick: Don't diss the truck. She's taken very good care of me. She's taken me all the way down to Baja for my surfing trips and all the way up to maverick's. She's just being a little temperamental.",
        "Phoebe: Well, maybe she's jealous. Maybe she's worried you'll leave her alone and go back to Paris.",
        "Rick: I'm not going anywhere. And right now, neither are you.",
        "Phoebe: True.",
        "Rick: Come on.",
        "[Sound of engine revving]",
        "Rick: Come on. Come on. So start so we're not stuck here at night.",
        "Phoebe: You're the one who was in such a big hurry.",
        "Rick: That's right. I got to call the office. Where's my phone?",
        "Phoebe: Sorry, I left mine at home charging.",
        "Rick: Oh, I'll find it. Don't worry.",
        "Phoebe: I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: All right, can we all at least acknowledge we're getting into some very dicey territory here?",
        "Felicia: We all know it's a risk, big brother.",
        "Thorne: One that we're all willing to take.",
        "Brooke: And to share equally.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, our children are going to be sharing that risk, too. R.J., Hope, Alexandria, Dino. It's their security we're gambling with here.",
        "Eric: Look, a retail chain makes Forrester Originals a much stable business. You will be guaranteeing everyone's financial security for years.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Brooke: Oh, it's Rick. Excuse me. Hi, honey.",
        "Rick: Hey, Mom. Are you in the meeting?",
        "Brooke: Yes, I am. Where are you?",
        "Rick: Well, I'm on my way. Or at least I was. My truck is acting up again.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Have you called for a tow?",
        "Rick: Well, I hope I won't have to.",
        "Brooke: Didn't I tell you to go buy yourself a new car? Just get here as soon as you can, okay?",
        "Rick: I will. It's just I have to stop by the house first. Phoebe is with me. Well, I ran into her at insomnia. And I had to give her a ride home. Just please don't tell ridge. I don't want him to get all worked up about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: What's got into you?",
        "Pam: That's right. Pamela's the good girl. The little mouse. She doesn't talk back. She doesn't complain. She just keeps her mouth shut and does what she's told --",
        "Stephanie: Oh, for Pete's sake, Pam --",
        "Pam: Poor desperate little Pamela. She has to trick his sister's husband into being her knight in shining armor --",
        "Stephanie: Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you.",
        "Pam: Well, you know, I'm not even angry, Stephanie. I'm just tired. I've had enough.",
        "Stephanie: I understand. It's difficult. It's been difficult for you being with mother and taking care of her.",
        "Pam: I don't think that you do understand, Stephanie. How could you? I've taken care of her all these years. Because you deserted us.",
        "Stephanie: And you know why.",
        "Pam: I'm not saying that you didn't have a reason. But damn it, Stephanie! I had no choice.",
        "Stephanie: So, now I owe you?",
        "Pam: You know, it's not always about you! Have you ever once thought it was like for me? What my life was like? Well, it wasn't much of a life at all. Mother scared away any man who was vaguely interested in me, she controlled all my friendships. Monopolized my time. My energy.",
        "Stephanie: Pammy, if you had asked, I would have helped.",
        "Pam: What would have you done? Sent us a check? Offered to put her in a home? Well, I couldn't abandon her, Stephanie. I was all she had in the world. So, I stayed with her. And I'll stay with her now. But I will not do it by myself anymore. And I will not go back to Chicago. Do you hear me? We will find a place in Los Angeles and you will deal with us in your life. Because you are part of our family, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Rick's not coming in?",
        "Brooke: He's having car trouble.",
        "Thorne: He isn't still driving that same old truck, is he?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, it's not very reliable.",
        "Felicia: Does he need someone to pick him up?",
        "Brooke: No, he'll be fine.",
        "Felicia: Are you sure, Brooke? Because you seem worried.",
        "Brooke: I'm just a little concerned with the weather and the roads being slick. Crazy drivers.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Ridge: Forrester originals. Hey, Taylor. No, I haven't. Did you try her cell? Okay, well call Madison. Then call me back.",
        "Brooke: What's going on?",
        "Ridge: Phoebe was supposed to check in with her mom, and she hasn't.",
        "Eric: Well, where'd she go?",
        "Ridge: Out with a friend.",
        "Eric: And she hasn't checked in.",
        "Ridge: No. Taylor's getting worried. Now, so am I.",
        "Brooke: She's okay.",
        "Ridge: Probably, but until we find out where she is.",
        "Brooke: No, I know where she is. She's with Rick.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Brooke: They ran into each other at the insomnia and she asked for a ride.",
        "Ridge: So, she's stuck out there with him now?",
        "Brooke: Yes, but they'll be fine. They're fine. Don't worry.",
        "Ridge: Rick told you that she was with him when he called.",
        "Brooke: Yes. But --",
        "Ridge: Did he ask you not to tell me? Logan, did Rick ask you not to tell me that Phoebe was with him?",
        "Brooke: Phoebe is safe, ridge. Just call Taylor and tell her that her daughter will be home soon.",
        "Ridge: I told him to stay away from my daughter. And he just continues to defy me here.",
        "Brooke: He didn't want to upset you.",
        "Ridge: So, he asked you to lie about it? Logan, it's now more it's important for you to protect your son than to be honest with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Are you okay?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, just driving at night makes me think about what happened.",
        "Rick: Darla. I'm sorry.",
        "Phoebe: No. I have to get over this.",
        "Rick: You're not over it. Not yet.",
        "Phoebe: Sometimes I think I have, but then -- then something happens.",
        "Rick: Like this? Some bonehead gets you stranded on the side of the road in the middle of the night?",
        "Phoebe: No, it's not your fault. Just don't get out.",
        "Rick: I won't. I won't.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, it's so stupid, getting worked up about this. Nothing's going to happen.",
        "Rick: I'll make sure of that, Phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: I just -- I just still think about it. You know, Darla falling back into the road and my mom coming around the corner -- I'm haunted by that moment. I don't know. Sometimes I think I always will be.",
        "Rick: No. No, Phoebe. You're going to move on from this. Your mom has. Thorne and Aly, they have. What happened to Darla was a tragedy, Phoebe. But it wasn't your fault. You're going to find peace again. And I want to help you do that. If I can.",
        "Phoebe: You already have."
