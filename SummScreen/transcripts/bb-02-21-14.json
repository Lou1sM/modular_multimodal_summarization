        "With all the guests gathered around Katie on the floor, Ridge asks Rick to call 411. He wants to know how in the hell did this happen. They determine she does have a pulse so that's good. Still drinking, Bill says this is a fine day for both of them. Liam says yeah he knows what Bill is going through so he's there for him. Bill appreciates his son's support. Liam even says that he also knows that Ridge does not belong with Brooke. Bill is surprised that Liam isn't gonna hound him about going back to Katie. Liam doesn't think that would do any good. He tells Bill that he is going to go for a run and maybe Bill should go a little easier on that bottle which is almost empty. Bill mocks him as Liam leaves. He's not out of sight good before Quinn slips in. she tells Bill she sees that he's alone with his best friend. He looks at her with one eyeball and says he is not so drunk that he thinks she is Liam. And he definitely knows she is not his best friend. She says no, but today that bottle sure is. So he tells her to shake her tail, girl, and see what kind of victory dance she has in her. She quips as much as she despises him, she is not there to gloat. He doesn't know why she is there anyway. She would never understand. She's never had the kind of love he had with Brooke. She says as much as he does deserve to wallow in this self-made agony she thought she would come over and keep him company. She wonders if he will reach out to Katie now that Brooke is a lost cause. Of course not as he has a son with her and those women are disposable. Although in her mind so is Brooke. She has three children by three different men. It's sad but they are a perfect match. He asked if she is finished and she says yes she has been finished with him for a long time ..and now it looks like so is Katie and Brooke. She states Bill is all alone just like she is. He pours another drink and she asks if she can join. He chimes that the bar is open. She knows the feeling of being dumped by your one and only and now Bill does too. This is a disaster but he doesn't see it that way. She says yes, he broke up his marriage, he lost his company and now his mistress has dumped him. He slurs that the mistake he made was trusting Katie not to take him to the cleaners, steal his company and restrict his time with his son. Quinn points out the mistake Katie made was trusting him not to sleep with her sister. She'll play Devil's advocate and say he does not like to take responsibility for his own actions. Like when she got pregnant, that was her fault, not his and she does not want to hear another apology as they suck. He tries to get up but stumbles a bit. Katie tries to get up and Ridge and Brooke all tell her just to rest; the paramedics are on the way. Katie wants no fuss, does not want to go to hospital but they all insist. Brooke says the wedding can wait. Katie is admitted at the hospital and Dr. Patrick takes over. Katie keeps saying she is fine, just didn't eat and has low blood sugar. Dr. Patrick reminds her of her heart history and they will have to take some tests to be sure her heart is not involved. Bill determines that he can't walk on his own so allows Quinn to help him up the stairs to his room to lie down. She tells him it will get better. He has not lost everything. Money is not the only measure of success. She says for her it is her son and the few friends that she does have. He agrees, says he can count his friends on one hand. She tells him believe it or not, but there are some of them that do still care, God only knows why. She tells him to be careful, cowboy. He makes a whinny sound and says yes it has been a rough night on the range.",
        "Dr. Patrick says they are almost through but he'd like one more test. Brooke goes with him to ask a question. Ridge tells Katie that she had them plenty scared. She apologizes and said she thought she could pull it off. She knew it was a mistake standing up for Brooke but she thought she could get through it. He hugs her and says she is as beautiful as ever and gritty as hell. She says there is nothing wrong with her. She did not pass out but she had to do something. Quinn manages to get Bill up the stairs but not without knocking over a lamp that shatters to pieces. He makes a crack about getting her in bed and she calls him a sexist pig. But then she kisses him. He's surprised since he thought she hated him. She says yes almost as much as he does her. They kiss again and he slams her against the wall where a picture falls. She rips off his shirt and his pant's belt and wraps it around her hand. She calls him a naughty boy and he calls her a crazy bitch. Liam comes back from his run. He sees the picture of him and Hope that Quinn turned down, so he rights it. Then he hears noises upstairs and starts to investigate. He hears another loud crash so runs up and pushes in Bill's door. He backs out with a ghostly face and almost gags as he backs into a corner out of the way. Ridge questions Katie on her not passing out. She admits that she has been messed up for so long. Bill hurt her really bad and she was angry. But Ridge listened to her and that may seem like a small thing, but it was more than that. He's shown her kindness and understanding. And she knows she has sent him mixed signals. When Carter started reading their poem ..and mentioned fate, she just lost it. She saw the way Ridge was looking at her and she just couldn't do it anymore. She says she knew she had two choices and both terrible choices that made her a liar. She could stand there and let her sister marry a man she knew she shouldn't or stop the wedding so she chose the latter. And she doesn't regret it. She says she has not felt like herself in a long time, but Ridge has made her feel like herself. Without him he adds she would be lost. She admits yes she would. She leans so close that she almost kisses him, but he offers his cheek instead. He says she is not lost."

        "Quinn: Sleeping with your wife's sister -- what did you expect?",
        "Bill: Well, I expected that Brooke wanted this as much as I did.",
        "Quinn: Of course, because it's always all about you.",
        "Bill: Why am I even talking to you? You would never understand.",

        "Quinn: Oh. No, of course not. Because you have a son with her, and those are the women that you see as disposable. Although, if you think about it, really think about it, Brooke is a lot like that, too, huh? I mean, Hope, Rick, R.J., all with different fathers. You know, this is -- this is really sad, because you two are the perfect match.",
        "Bill: Are you finished?",

        "Ridge: Don't get up.",
        "Brooke: Honey, you scared us. Do you even remember what was happening?",
        "Katie: Yes. You were getting married. Listen, I really didn't get to eat this morning. It's probably just low blood sugar. You don't have to be here. I'm fine.",
        "EMT: Are you diabetic?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "EMT: Has this happened before?",

        "Quinn: Mm. To that old familiar feeling.",
        "Bill: Which is?",
        "Quinn: The sting of being dumped by your one and only. I know the feeling, and now so do you. [Chuckles] Mmm. So... tell me. What have you learned from this disaster?",
        "Bill: It was not a disaster.",
        "Quinn: No. I beg to differ. You, uh, broke up your marriage, you lost control of your company, and your mistress dumped you.",
        "Bill: The mistake I made was trusting Katie that she would not take me to the cleaners, steal my company, restrict the time I have with my son.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. The mistake she made was trusting you not to sleep with her sister.",
        "Bill: She wanted me to sleep with her sister. She plans this trip to Aspen, the hot-air balloon ride. Are you kidding me?",
        "Quinn: Shall I play devil's advocate?",
        "Bill: No, you shall not.",

        "Bill: Oh, I take...plenty of responsibility.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Really? No. You didn't with me. Oh, but wait. No. It was my fault that I got pregnant. My bad.",
        "Bill: Could have been avoided.",
        "Quinn: You really don't want to go there with me now, do you?",
        "Bill: [Muttering] You really don't want to go there with -- [Normal voice] What -- what do you want? What, another apology?",
        "Quinn: Oh, no! No! I don't want another one of your apologies, because, to be honest with you, your apologies -- they suck.",
        "Bill: Well, you really just have quite a way with words, don't you?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. But I did use to make you laugh, didn't I?",
        "Bill: I don't know. Maybe you did. A little bit.",

        "Dr. Patrick: Any chest pain?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Dr. Patrick: Trouble breathing?",
        "Katie: No. I-I really don't think there's anything to worry about.",
        "Dr. Patrick: Katie, you have a medical history. I need to run some tests.",
        "Katie: Some tests?",
        "Dr. Patrick: Well, blood work, an EKG, for starters.",
        "Katie: Well, that could take hours.",
        "Ridge: It doesn't matter if it takes days. We're gonna make sure you're okay and nothing happens to you.",
        "Dr. Patrick: Let's get started.",
        "Katie: Okay.",

        "Ridge: Katie, relax.",
        "Brooke: Just take it easy.",
        "Dr. Patrick: The blood work is important. I need to check your cardiac- troponin level to make sure you haven't had a mild heart attack.",
        "Katie: I-I didn't have any chest pains.",
        "Dr. Patrick: Heart attacks aren't always proceeded by chest pains. I also need to run some scans to check for transplant rejection.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] But that could take all night.",
        "Brooke: Honey, we have to do this to find out why you fainted.",
        "Katie: I know why I fainted.",
        "Brooke: No, you don't. But we are going to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Mm. It will get better, Bill.",
        "Bill: That is what they say, isn't it? Who -- and who is \"They\"?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Because it's true. You've lost Brooke, but you haven't lost everything.",
        "Bill: Oh, my money means nothing to me.",
        "Quinn: Ha! Liar.",
        "Bill: You're right.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Money is not the only measure of success.",
        "Bill: When you don't have any.",
        "Quinn: For me, it's my son and my friends, the few that I have.",
        "Bill: Oh, I'm with you on that one. I could count my friends on one hand.",
        "Quinn: Some of us do care about you, Bill. God only knows why. Whoa, whoa. Easy, Cowboy.",
        "Bill: Yes. This has been a rough [Whinnies] Night on the range.",

        "Brooke: I'll be back.",
        "Ridge: You had us pretty scared.",
        "Katie: Sorry, I... I thought I'd be able to pull it off. I knew it was a big mistake, standing up for Brooke, but I thought I'd be able to get through it somehow.",
        "Ridge: Well, at least you tried. You're as beautiful as ever. Gritty as hell.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Perfect package. Right now, what you've got to do is rest. Listen to your doctor.",

        "Quinn: Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm sure you'd like to do the same thing to me.",
        "Bill: Sounds like an even better plan.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] I'm sure you would enjoy that.",
        "Bill: Not as much as you would.",

I wake up in the morning, I get Will ready for the rest of the day, I go to work, I just try not to feel anything, because it hurts too much. You've listened to me, and I know that seems like a small thing, but it's not. You've shown me kindness and understanding, and I-I have sent you mixed signals.
