        "bring us together.Peon i gw get and ck's e be hafter . (Female announcer)thin \r\nlips--what a bore. ",
        "Felicia: This isn't going to be easy, bridget. ",
        "Bridget: I know. ",
        "Felicia: I need you to stay the same strong woman you've become. ",
        "Bridget: That's sweet, I'll try. ",
        "Felicia: No, promise me! ",
        "Bridget: I promise. ",
        "Felicia: I have to know you'll never abandon my boy. ",
        "Bridget: Never. ",
        "Felicia: You looking out for him is the only thing that's giving me peace of \r\nmind. Okay? Otherwise -- I don't know how I could say goodbye. No matter what \r\nhappens, your connection to him is strong. It'll override anything that life \r\nthrows at you, right? ",
        "Bridget: Honey, yes. Of course it will. Felicia, I see dominick as my son. \r\nHe's my son with nick. A perfect reflection of us. Oh, sweetheart, come here. I \r\npromise you nothing will ever, ever come between me and that little boy. ",
        "Dante: Nick loves brooke. You told bridget to divorce him for exactly the \r\nsame reason. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, yes. That was then, now -- the two of them have become \r\nreally close, bridget and nick are -- ",
        "Dante: Because they were having a baby. Nick is with bridget only out of \r\nobligation. Remember when nick thought that bridget wasn't pregnant anymore? \r\nWhat did he do? He went straight back to brooke. And why do you think brooke is \r\nnot back with ridge? ",
        "Stephanie: Because she's in love with nick. ",
        "Dante: Exactly. And they're gonna get back together, it's just a matter of \r\ntime. I don't want bridget to go through that kind of pain again. Bridget \r\ndeserves to be happy. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, I want her to be happy too. Especially after everything that \r\nshe's been through. ",
        "Dante: Stephanie, I need your help. I can make bridget happy, with your \r\nsupport. ",
        "Nick: I never should've stayed in this stupid city, ever. ",
        "Brooke: Don't say that. Dominick is always going to be a part of your life. \r\nThat isn't going to change. Besides, this is what felicia wants. ",
        "Nick: It doesn't matter what she wants. It's about the father, now. What he \r\nwants. And I can deal with that. Believe me, I've had plenty of practice. I \r\ndon't know how bridget's going to react though, that's what scares me. The pain \r\nand the loss that she's endured, she's turned that into love for dominick. The \r\nchild that she believes that we're gonna raise as a family. ",
        "Bridget: You can go right to sleep. Have your sweet, sweet dreams. Oh, hi. My \r\nlittle angel is so tired. He's had a really big day. Yeah. Yeah. I think I \r\nshould just go put him down. Come on. Little buddy. I'll be right back. ",
        "Brooke: You gotta tell her, nick. It can't wait any longer. ",
        "Stephanie: I don't know dante. I think that bridget needs nick now more than \r\never. They've just lost a little baby girl and now she might lose a son. ",
        "Dante: That's my point. She won't lose a son. She's gonna gain a husband \r\nwho's gonna love her and respect more than any other man. A man whose only \r\ndevoted to her. ",
        "Stephanie: You? ",
        "Dante: Yes. But she needs someone to show her the way. You have a powerful \r\npresence in her life. With your guidance, everything will fall into place. \r\nStephanie, please, let me take care of bridget and my son. Felicia will have her \r\npeace. Because she'll know th her son will be raised by two parents who are \r\ncommitted to one another. And your family will be safe. And I would be honored \r\nto be a part of the forrester family, along with my son. But I need your support \r\nand if you give me that support, I swear to god, I'll never let you down. ",
        "Bridget: He is such a perfect, little angel. ",
        "Nick: He just go right out? ",
        "Bridget: Yeah, very peaceful, happy. He's going to have the best parents. \r\nWe're going to give that child so much love. Is my mom gone? ",
        "Nick: Yeah, she just brought the flowers -- some of the gifts from the \r\nmemorial by. ",
        "Bridget: Are you okay? ",
        "Nick: I'm good. ",
        "Bridget: Are you sure? ",
        "Nick: Yeah. Are you? ",
        "Bridget: I'm going to be fine. I know we're gonna get through this together. \r\nI was worried that I would seem weird having a service for nicole but -- it \r\nwasn't, you know? She was a part of us. A forrester and a marone. Everyone there \r\nacknowledged her. ",
        "Nick: It was great. ",
        "Bridget: Yeah, it felt good to have the whole family there. But nobody's \r\npresence meant more to me than dominick'S. You know, I never thought that i \r\nwould need someone as much as I need that child. He would have made a really \r\ngood older brother to nicole. He has his father's sense of humor and sense of \r\nadventure. I think he would've really looked after her. You know, I had these \r\nimages of them running on the beach and dominick pushing nicole on a swing. I \r\nhad even figured out in my mind how the four of us could all go to dinner \r\ntogether easily. ",
        "[Bridget sobbing] I have all these wonderful moments that obviously will \r\nnever happen. ",
        "Nick: You know, bridget, we can have other children. We can have the family \r\nwe want. ",
        "Bridget: We already have a family, nick. It's so weird -- I don't want to go \r\nanywhere. I just want to stay here and nest with you and me and dominick. He's \r\nour son. The two of you mean more to me than you will ever know. ",
        "Nick: I love you. ",
        "Bridget: I love you, too. Hey -- I'm sorry that I was going on and on. At \r\ndad's house you said you wanted to tell me something. Is everything okay? Nick? \r\nOh god, is it bad news? Honey, what's wrong? Why are you looking at me like \r\nthis? ",
        "Nick: It's about dominick. ",
        "Bridget: Did you not want me to bring him home tonight? Felicia said it would \r\nbe all right -- she wanted me to. I felt really close to him -- ",
        "Nick: That's fine. It's -- ",
        "Bridget: Is something wrong? ",
        "Nick: No, no he's fine. There's been a big mistake made. ",
        "Bridget: What are you talking about? I -- what's wrong with dominick? ",
        "Nick: Dominick's fine. ",
        "Bridget: Then what is it? Tell me what it is, nick. I need to know what it \r\nis. "
