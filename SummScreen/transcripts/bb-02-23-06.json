        "Bridget: Nick, you're starting to scare me.",
        "Nick: I'm sorry. Bridget, I'm so sorry.",
        "Bridget: I don't want an apology. I just want an answer. What's going on with Dominick? Damn it, Nick, just tell me!",
        "Nick: Dominick's dad -- Dominick's father --",
        "Bridget: Why are you saying it like that? You're Dominick's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Hello, Brooke.",
        "[Brooke sighs in disgust ]",
        "Brooke: What do you want?",
        "Stephanie: I thought it was a lovely service today.",
        "Brooke: Yes, it was.",
        "Stephanie: I didn't know how Bridget was going to hold up.",
        "Brooke: Well, she's experienced a terrible loss. And there's more to come, I'm afraid.",
        "Stephanie: I know.",
        "Brooke: You know what?",
        "Stephanie: That it's Dante's baby, not Nick's. How did you find out?",
        "Brooke: I just came from the beach house.",
        "Stephanie: Nick told you.",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: Before he told his wife?",
        "Brooke: What are you suggesting, Stephanie?",
        "Stephanie: I'm not suggesting anything. It's not surprising that he would confide in you, considering the situation. It's a tragedy. But you know, I've had some time to think about this and the more I think about it, the more I realize it might be the answer to everyone's prayers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Thanks for helping me bring in all this stuff so quickly.",
        "Mover: Hey, no problem, man. Babies come early sometimes. I ought to know, my wife delivered a month before her due date.",
        "Dante: Congratulations. I just found out my son was born last year. I didn't know until -- well, I'm looking forward to having him come in and live with me. It's gonna be amazing. Here you go.",
        "Mover: I'll help you set up.",
        "Dante: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Nick, look at me.",
        "Nick: Bridget -- Felicia had a test done last night at the hospital.",
        "Bridget: What kind of test? Nick -- Nick, just tell me!",
        "Nick: She had a paternity test done.",
        "Bridget: What?",
        "Nick: Taylor was with her. They wanted to make sure before Felicia said anything to anyone. And the test results were conclusive. Bridget -- I'm not Dominick's father. Felicia was with someone else. It's his child. Dominick's not my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: There's no silver lining to this situation, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: I think you might be wrong about that.",
        "Brooke: And I think you're being totally insensitive to my daughter.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I hope not. Losing a baby is devastating enough as it is.",
        "Brooke: Exactly. And to top it off, she going to find that the boy she's becoming close to isn't Nick's after all? To lose another child?",
        "Stephanie: Well, that would be heartbreaking -- that would really be heartbreaking. But I'm not convinced that this is how it has to turn out.",
        "Brooke: What are you talking about?",
        "Stephanie: I just saw Dante.",
        "Brooke: And what did he say?",
        "Stephanie: Well actually, he put things in perspective for me about this whole situation.",
        "Brooke: What things?",
        "Stephanie: Naturally, he wants what's best for what he now finds out is his child. We all know that the very best thing for any child would be to be raised by a loving mother and father.",
        "Brooke: That's great. So he's willing to let Nick and Bridget raise Dominick?",
        "Stephanie: I didn't say that. What about Bridget and Dante raising the baby?",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Stephanie: Well, they aren't exactly strangers. He's madly in love with her.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god. You're not suggesting -- what about Nick?",
        "Stephanie: Well, you could have Nick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: How is this -- how is this even possible?",
        "Nick: There was another man.",
        "Bridget: So Felicia came back to L.A. And turned our lives upside down -- passing off another man's child as your son? She had to have known.",
        "Nick: That's just it, she didn't know. She didn't know, they were together just one night.",
        "Bridget: One night? Oh, please, tell me this is some kind of sick joke.",
        "Nick: It's not.",
        "Bridget: Felicia begged me to accept that child as my own. And I did. I accepted him, though -- even when I was pregnant. I accepted him because he was your son. I fell in love with him because he was your son. He's our son. Nick, they're not gonna take him away from us. We love Dominick. He loves us. Felicia wouldn't do that to us, no, she's --",
        "Nick: She still wants you --",
        "Bridget: She wouldn't do that to Dominick.",
        "Nick: She wants you to be the mother. The father -- it's the father that --",
        "Bridget: What about him?",
        "Nick: He's the one that pressured her into having the paternity test.",
        "Bridget: Who the hell is he, anyway?",
        "Nick: The father's Dante.",
        "Bridget: What? Dante? He -- they barely even know each other!",
        "Nick: They met in France after Felecia left L.A. They were together just one night.",
        "Bridget: So this -- this is what you and Dante were arguing about when I walked in to get Dominick today. Oh, my god. Oh, my god -- you had just found out. That's why you were acting that way today at the service. It wasn't just about Nicole. You lost your son, too. Wait, Nick. Honey. Oh, honey, I am so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I've told you 100,000 times, Stephanie. I am not going to come between Bridget and the man that she loves. I am not going to hurt her like that again. And I mean it. Not that you'd ever believe me, given what you think of me. But for god's sakes, just open your eyes! Nick is devoted to Bridget. He cares deeply for her.",
        "Stephanie: I do see that. I saw it today at the service. I see that they have developed a genuine love for one another. I didn't anticipate that. But I see something else. I see a very harsh, sad reality that they're going to have to face. You know, not many marriages survive the loss of a baby or a child. And here they are on the verge of losing another child. It's the children that kept that marriage together.",
        "Brooke: Yes, but they can still have other children. They can still be a family.",
        "Stephanie: You're not hearing me.",
        "Brooke: No, you're not hearing me. Nick and Bridget will get through this.",
        "Stephanie: This -- this sacrifice that you and Nick have made for Bridget, for her future, for her happiness has only delayed the inevitable.",
        "Brooke: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Stephanie: This couple has gone from crisis to crisis since they've been together. Any kind of happiness that they find doesn't last. You and Nick --",
        "Brooke: Do not go there, Stephanie!",
        "Stephanie: Brooke, Bridget's never gonna find lasting happiness with Nick, and you're not going to find any kind of happiness without nick. This is what I've come to talk to you about tonight. Together, we can make Bridget understand this. Work out what's best for everyone. Can't you see this? Can't you see that this is a win-win situation for everyone involved?",
        "Brooke: You know what I see? I see the person who stands to win the most here. And I'm looking right at her. If I'm with Nick, I can't be with Ridge. That's what this is really all about, isn't it, Stephanie?",
        "Bridget: This is what Dante was trying to tell me earlier. Nick, this may not be as bad as it seems.",
        "Nick: What do you mean?",
        "Bridget: Wait, just listen. Dante was talking to me earlier, and he was trying to explain that something really bad might happen, but it wouldn't be as bad as it seemed. He made sure that I knew that he cared about me and that he would never hurt me. Don't you get it? Don't you see? He was trying to tell me that he may be the father, but he was never going to take Dominick away from us.",
        "Nick: Bridget, honey, do you really think that that guy's gonna let me raise his kid? Because I sure the hell wouldn't let him raise mine if the situation were reversed.",
        "Bridget: Well, Nick --",
        "[Dominick crying]",
        "Nick: I'll get him. Bridget, where are you going?",
        "Bridget: I'm gonna go talk to Dante straighten this whole thing out.",
        "Nick: Bridget --",
        "Bridget: No, please, just don't.",
        "Nick: You're only setting yourself up for a bigger letdown.",
        "Bridget: No, I don't -- I don't believe that. I don't think Dante would ever do that to me. Nick, nothing needs to change. We're not going to lose our son. I mean, Dante might be the biological father, but Dominick is our son. He's yours and he's mine and were gonna raise this child just like Felecia wanted us to. Just like you deserve, huh? He's gonna be raised with two parents. Bye, baby. I love you. We both love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Think what you will, but at least hear me out. You know, I'm a mother, too. I can't stand to see my children in pain, either. The simple truth is, if you and Ridge were going to be together, it would've already happened, Brooke. You're in love with Nick. That's why you cannot make the commitment to my son. You said it yourself -- you love nick like you've never loved any other man. So why would you deny yourself and deny him this? Why deny Bridget happiness? She has a chance here to have a young man that would love her and cherish her and be committed to her. Maybe they have a chance if they could raise this baby together. And then you and Nick could raise your little children together. You've been through every man in my family and a couple of them more than twice. Why didn't it work out? Because you never felt completed. You said that Nick is your heart, your soul, and that he makes you feel complete. Why would you -- why would you deny yourself this? Why? Everybody wants that sort of thing in their life. Bridget, too. And Bridget will be fine. She's strong. She deserves so much more than this. She deserves a man of her own. She has a chance here. You have a chance. It's this moment. It's now or never. What's it going to be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Good, good. Come on, you can do it. [Dominick fussing] I never felt anything like the first time I saw you, you know that? Where do we go from here, young Dominick? Where do we go from here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Hi.",
        "Bridget: I know what you were trying to tell me earlier. Nick told me. You're Dominick's father.",
        "Dante: It was completely unexpected. Not that I don't welcome being a father. Dominick is the best.",
        "Bridget: He means the world to me. You know that. You know how much I love him and how much I need him. You even knew I would be scared to death when I found out that Nick wasn't his father.",
        "Dante: I didn't want to cause you any more pain, you know. Especially after the loss of your daughter.",
        "Bridget: I told nick that. I told him that you would be looking after me and my feelings. It's been that way since the day we met practically. You're always looking after me.",
        "Dante: But I don't think your husband would agree with that.",
        "Bridget: Well, my husband doesn't know you like I know you. He doesn't know that you're the type of man that wants the best for his child, just like Nick and I do.",
        "Dante: You made a promise to Felecia --",
        "Bridget: To be a mother to Dominick. I'm going to keep that promise.",
        "Dante: I wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Bridget: I knew I could count on you.",
        "Dante: I want what's best for my son, yes.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, and you're doing that by letting Nick and me adopt Dominick --",
        "Dante: Whoa. Adopt?",
        "Bridget: Yeah. We'll let the lawyers handle everything --",
        "Dante: Wait a second, Bridget. That's not what I meant. I want Dominick to come live with me. With me. And look, I bought all this stuff. I bought a crib and everything.",
        "Bridget: You're gonna raise him here by yourself?",
        "Dante: What? You don't think I can do it?",
        "Bridget: No, it's not that. You just told me, though, that you wanted -- you wanted me to be his mother.",
        "Dante: That's what I meant. That's what I meant. You and I. Look, I'm gonna need help and I'm gonna need support. I mean, what better person to help me raise my son than someone who loves him as much as their own?",
        "Bridget: What are you saying to me?",
        "Dante: I always believed that Nick came back to you because of the baby. But now, your daughter is gone and Dominick is my son. I believe things happen for a reason, even painful things.",
        "Bridget: Dante --",
        "Dante: I was ready to step in and be a father to your child. Now I need you to be a mother to mine. I need to know that you're gonna be there for him.",
        "Bridget: I will be. Nick and I will --",
        "Dante: I'm not talking about Nick! I'm talking about you and me. I want my son to have the best parents he could possibly have. You and me. Please agree to raise -- to raise our son with me."
