        "Nick: Yes. ",
        "Jackie: What a nightmare for you, Nicky.\r\nI mean, first Nicole, and now -- no. No, the first tragedy was losing R.J. and Hope.\r\n",
        "Nick: Mother, there's really no\r\npoint in discussing this, is there? ",
        "Jackie: You and Bridget -- you told\r\nFelicia that you were going to bring up the boy. Has that changed? ",
        "Nick: Everything's changed. Why\r\nwould he want me to raise that boy? The truth is, Mother, I really don't know\r\nif it makes sense to really want to. ",
        "*****************************************",
        "Bridget: Whatever you think of Nick,\r\nhe loves me. ",
        "Dante: The way a husband loves a\r\nwife? If a loving friendship is enough to start a family, why not you, me and Dominick?\r\n",
        "Bridget: Dante, you're a father\r\nnow. I'm going to be so disappointed if all this child means to you is leverage\r\nwith me. Just forget about you and me. Forget about me and Nick. This is about Dominick.\r\n",
        "Dante: How? You say that Nick wants\r\nto adopt. How do I know that the two of you are still going to be together in a\r\nyear from now? ",
        "Bridget: Well, think about\r\neverything we've already been through. ",
        "Dante: I do. More than you know. ",
        "Bridget: Well, then you realize\r\nthat it's only made us stronger. ",
        "Dante: I can see that you're not\r\nthe scared person I met in Rome. I think loving Nick has made you stronger.\r\nMaybe strong enough to walk away. ",
        "Bridget: I came here tonight to\r\ndiscuss Dominick's future with you, and all you can tell me is that you think I\r\nshould break up my marriage? ",
        "Dante: You know, I could never\r\nimagine myself telling you this, but I think you should leave. I don't want to\r\nsay things that are going to hurt you. And I don't know how to avoid it. ",
        "Bridget: I'm just trying to think\r\nof the alternatives here. Fine, you bought some furniture. But do you think\r\nthat that's going to be it? ",
        "Dante: I don't have all the\r\nanswers. ",
        "Bridget: Well, how could you? I am\r\nnot trying to be cruel, but fatherhood wasn't even something that you thought\r\nabout until a couple of days ago. ",
        "Dante: Fatherhood on my own, no.\r\nAnd I don't know what's going to happen, but I'm making room for my son in my\r\nheart, in my life and in my home. ",
        "Bridget: What kind of home is that\r\ngoing to be? You're trying to juggle two careers here. One as an artist and a\r\nnew designer. Is a nanny's face going to be the most familiar one to him? ",
        "Dante: Why don't you go door to\r\ndoor? You and Nick have money, connections. I'm sure you can convince another\r\nfamily you can raise their child better than they can. ",
        "Bridget: Now I've offended you.\r\nThis just -- it's not just anyone's child, this is my sister's. Felicia's. She\r\nasked Nick and me to step in, and I don't want to exclude you, but Dante,\r\nhonestly, come on. The only connection you have to Dominick is the night he was\r\nconceived. ",
        "Dante: That's pretty much the\r\nessential one, isn't it ? It meant a family wasn't part of the deal. That's all\r\nI'm saying. ",
        "Dante: Even if I started adoption\r\nproceedings tomorrow, how do I know that nick wants to adopt my son? Have you\r\nasked him that? ",
        "Bridget: He loves that boy. ",
        "Dante: He just wants a son named\r\nafter him. ",
        "Bridget: This is getting us\r\nnowhere. ",
        "Dante: Yeah, you're right about\r\nthat. ",
        "Bridget: I didn't expect you to\r\nhave an answer for me tonight. ",
        "Dante: Do I seem undecided to you? ",
        "Bridget: Look, we both want what's\r\nbest for Dominick. And so does Nick. Could we please just agree to concentrate\r\non figuring that out? ",
        "Dante: Sure. ",
        "Bridget: Thanks. I'm going to call\r\nyou later, all right? ",
        "*****************************************************",
        "Ridge: Felicia and Dante? ",
        "Stephanie: Safe to say, that one\r\nwasn't expected. ",
        "Brooke: The point is, whatever\r\nhappened between Felicia and Dante, it obviously wasn't a committed\r\nrelationship. So Felicia has say so about how she wants her son raised, and she\r\nwants him with Nick and Bridget. ",
        "Stephanie: The point is, Dante is\r\nnot going away. ",
        "Ridge: What does any of this have\r\nto do with Brooke and me? I warned you, Mother. I'm not going to suffer through\r\nanymore of your interference anymore. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you'd rather suffer\r\nthrough a marriage with her, like your father just had? ",
        "Brooke: If you're not going to\r\nsupport Brooke and I wanting to raise our son together, I don't want to hear\r\nanymore about it, okay? ",
        "Stephanie: If that's your\r\nobjective, then why hasn't it happened? You've been running a full-court press\r\nsince you walked out on Taylor, and where has it gotten you? ",
        "Brooke: That's none of your business,\r\neither. ",
        "Stephanie: You have to be asking\r\nyourself the same question, and I think, deep down, you know the answer. Hard\r\nas it is to believe -- she doesn't want you. She's moved on to \"destiny,\r\npart two.\" Nick. ",
        "***********************************************",
        "Jackie: Let's go out to dinner.\r\nLet's go someplace where's there's lots of people and music -- Chuck's bar.\r\nNick, you've got to get out of this house. You've got to away from this house,\r\naway from these thoughts. ",
        "Nick: Dominick's sleeping in the\r\nback, mother. Bridget wanted him to stay with us tonight. I should take him to Felicia's\r\nright now, that's what I should do. ",
        "Jackie: No. Why would you do that,\r\nif she gets some comfort from having him here? ",
        "Nick: Because I don't want her\r\ngetting more attached to a child that we're going to lose. ",
        "Jackie: Dante has actually said\r\nthat? ",
        "Nick: He doesn't have to say it, Mother.\r\nHe's the father. He calls the shots. I don't want to sit around hoping for\r\nsomething that won't happen. I don't want to go through that disappointment\r\nagain, and I certainly don't want it for my wife. ",
        "Bridget: Hi, Jackie. ",
        "Jackie: Hello, Bridget. I'm going\r\nto go. ",
        "Bridget: When was Dominick's last\r\nbottle? ",
        "Nick: About an hour ago. ",
        "Bridget: I'm just going to go check\r\non him. ",
        "Jackie: Dominick's going to be\r\nfine, you know? Whatever happens, he's going to be fine. The question is, will Bridget?\r\nWill you? ",
        "Bridget: I've never seen Dante like\r\nthis before. ",
        "Nick: He's never had anything like\r\nthis at stake before. I know that life, Bridget. I've lived it. ",
        "Bridget: I really think that we can\r\nwork something out. ",
        "Nick: He asked you to help raise\r\nthe child with him, didn't he? Does that surprise you? ",
        "Bridget: He doesn't know how to be\r\na father, Nick. ",
        "Nick: That's really not one of the\r\nqualifications here, is it? ",
        "Bridget: I just think the word\r\n\"adoption\" scared him. ",
        "Nick: Well, it scares me, too. ",
        "Bridget: Honey, look, if we just\r\ngive him a while to remember why Felicia chose us, and why we took on that\r\ncommitment -- ",
        "Nick: No. ",
        "Bridget: No? No what? ",
        "Nick: You made a commitment to be\r\nthe mother to my child -- to my son. I don't have a son. Therefore, you are\r\nreleased from that commitment. ",
        "Bridget: Nick, Dominick didn't\r\nvanish after that paternity test. He still needs us. ",
        "Nick: He needs a home. And he'll\r\nhave one. But it's not going to be with us. I did not sign on to raise another\r\nman's child. ",
        "**********************************************",
        "Brooke: How would you know what I\r\nwant? ",
        "Stephanie: There isn't anyone in\r\nthis world who knows better than I do. ",
        "Brooke: Yeah, that is your fantasy.\r\nYou think that I'm so low that there's nothing that your superior intelligence\r\ncan't penetrate. Well, if you think that there's nothing wrong with calmly\r\narranging for my daughter to lose her husband on the heels of losing her child,\r\nthen you're the monster, Stephanie, not me. ",
        "Stephanie: She's already lost him,\r\nand no one is trying to assign blame here. He wants to be a good husband. You\r\nwant him to be a good husband. But he's staying with her out of love for you. ",
        "Brooke: You don't -- ",
        "Stephanie: Not because he loves\r\nher. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, god, you don't give a\r\ndamn about Nick's happiness or mine. It is so obvious to see what is on your\r\nagenda. First order of business is to cement that little boy into the Forrester\r\nfamily any way possible. And how do you do that? You put Bridget and Dante\r\ntogether. Oh, but Bridget already has a husband. So what do you do there? Second\r\non the agenda, you push Brooke over to Nick in order to destroy all hope of Ridge\r\nand me getting together in the future. ",
        "Stephanie: You're not buying any of\r\nthis version of reality, are you? ",
        "Ridge: Mother, what the hell are\r\nyou doing here, anyway? Brooke's not going to take any advice from you. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, she'd better take\r\nit from somebody. Look, there's nothing more destructive than you being bad, except\r\nwhen you try to be good. Your daughter is stuck in a marriage with a man who at\r\nbest gives her a parental interest. And that poor, dumb S.O.B., Nick, is\r\nmiserable doing his duty by you. You want -- you want to join this casualty\r\nlist? ",
        "Brooke: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's\r\nthe thought that you can't abide. This really has nothing to do with my\r\nunconsummated romance with Nick. This is about your unconsummated romance with\r\nyour oldest son. You still wish he was a little baby, sitting on your lap with\r\nhis diaper. Goochie, goochie, goo. You know what, Stephanie, he's an\r\nindependent man for god sakes! So you have your alter ego, Taylor -- the\r\nbeautiful, perfect Taylor, who isn't so perfect after all. But she listens to\r\neverything that you say. And she tells you everything. So to you, she is\r\nperfect. And the next best thing to being in bed with Ridge yourself. ",
        "Stephanie: You're just going to\r\nstand there and let her talk to me this way, aren't you? The woman that the\r\nwhole world watched sleep her way through my family? ",
        "Brooke: Stop it. I am so tired of\r\nthat old crap. I'm sick of it. The Forrester men came at me like a stampede.\r\nYears of living with you, Stephanie, was like aversion therapy! They had to\r\nfind a woman that was nothing -- nothing -- like you. And you, don't you dare\r\nthink you're going to sit this one out on the fence like you normally do. You\r\neither stand up with me and with our children, or you let your mother take you\r\nhome and tuck you in. ",
        "Ridge: Honor thy father, honor thy\r\nmother. Isn't that one of the ten commandments? ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it is, and you know\r\nit is. ",
        "Ridge: Well, then they can just\r\nhaul me off to hell, I don't give a damn. I've tried and I've tried, Mother,\r\nand I'm done. All you want is unquestioned control here. And you're gonna lie,\r\nyou're gonna nag, you're gonna use your guilt card until you get it. Well, your\r\nopinion of Brooke, or anything else for that matter, doesn't matter to me one\r\nbit. ",
        "Stephanie: Okay, pay no attention\r\nto me. Forget everything, except the one truth that you know. She is opening\r\nthe door to you because she doesn't want anybody to think she's responsible for\r\nher daughter's marriage breaking up. ",
        "Brooke: Unbelievable! ",
        "Ridge: Bridget is of no relation to\r\nyou, Mother. And your usual excuse for interfering -- \"for the good of the\r\nfamily\" -- doesn't exist. You don't even have that. ",
        "Stephanie: What, I can't be\r\nconcerned about your happiness? ",
        "Ridge: Well, why don't we just put\r\nthat to the test, shall we? Okay, I didn't really expect to have an audience,\r\nbut here we go. My mother wants to care about me, feel good about my happiness,\r\nI'm going to let her. And if it proves something to you, so much the better. I\r\nwant our life back, Brooke. I want us to be a family again. So I'll ask you one\r\nmore time -- will you be my wife? ",
        "***********************************************",
        "Bridget: It's late. This has been\r\none of the hardest days of my life, and yours. I don't think we should be\r\ntalking about this right now. ",
        "Nick: We should, Bridget. We can't\r\ngo to sleep tonight and wake up tomorrow thinking we understand each other when\r\nwe don't. ",
        "Bridget: Well, you can't possibly\r\nbe saying that Dominick doesn't mean anything to you now. ",
        "Nick: I am saying that I don't feel\r\nright about keeping him from his natural father. ",
        "Bridget: But Dante knows he needs\r\nhelp. We didn't get into specifics, but I think he would be open to an\r\narrangement where Dominick lives with us. ",
        "Nick: For how long, though? How\r\nlong do we allow ourselves to get attached to this little boy before he changes\r\nhis mind? Which could happen at any time in the next 18 years. ",
        "Bridget: Well, I think that's\r\nbetter than just giving up. ",
        "Nick: It's not giving up. It's\r\nreality. ",
        "Bridget: I don't understand you\r\nright now. ",
        "Nick: Well, I think I understand\r\nyou, and it scares me. Because I think part of you is clinging onto this boy so\r\nyou don't feel the pain of the loss of Nicole and all of the hopes that we\r\npinned on her. ",
        "Bridget: I am feeling the loss of\r\nthat child that I carried in my body. Dominick is allowing me to try to get\r\npast that so I can see what a life would look like without my daughter. And now\r\nyou're telling me that I can't love my son? ",
        "Nick: No. I am telling you that he\r\nis not our son. But we can have a son of our own. ",
        "Bridget: You don't even know that.\r\nBut even if we could, why does that child have to replace Dominick? Why can't I\r\nlove Dominick, no matter where his DNA came from? Why can't you? ",
        "Nick: I can. I can love that boy\r\nmore every day. I can build dreams that every father dreams to have with their\r\nson. Right up until Dante and a judge show up and they decide that he is no\r\nlonger ours, and all of these wounds that we feel right now will be opened up\r\nagain. I can do that. But I'm not going to. ",
        "Bridget: Oh, I think you would if\r\n-- ",
        "Nick: If what? Bridget? ",
        "Bridget: I think you would if this\r\nmarriage was important enough to you. ",
        "Nick: You're saying that I'm not\r\ncommitted to this marriage? ",
        "Bridget: No I -- I think we're both\r\ndesperately committed. Not to the marriage that we actually have, but to the\r\nmarriage that we keep wanting to have. The one that Nicole stood for, and Dominick\r\nstood for. They were the glue that was holding us together, Nick. And now,\r\nthere's no more glue. "
