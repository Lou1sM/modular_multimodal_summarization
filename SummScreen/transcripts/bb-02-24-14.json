        "Brooke keeps following Dr. Patrick around to find out what happened to Katie. He says he will know when he sees the blood test results. Katie tells Ridge that she is sorry it came to this. He says he is not. Bill and Quinn continue to have their freaky romp in his bedroom. She punctures him with his sword necklace and he takes it and runs it over her neck. Liam closes his eyes and comes downstairs looking like a rag doll. He opens the door to find Hope there. Distracted, but he lets her in where she slowly fills him in that she's not at the wedding as it was cancelled when Katie fainted. She keeps hearing noises upstairs along with moans and groans and is worried about Bill. Liam covers by saying his dad is not feeling well and he will check on him later. He doesn't want to disturb him now. Then he confesses that Katie and Ridge have deep feelings for each other and that is why she collapsed. He can't keep this to himself when it's her health on the line. Hope is devastated but says she can not fault Ridge or Katie. People can not help how they feel when they are together; she gets that. But she says she does not want to see her mom get hurt again. If Ridge has feelings for Katie she can not let him marry her mom. She gives Liam a hug and thanks him for telling her. She has to go find out if this is true by talking to Ridge and Katie.",
        "Quinn give Bill one last kiss and tells him to enjoy his hangover. Liam finds Bill and asks if they are alone and is he okay. Bill says more or less. Liam fills him in that there was no wedding. Brooke and Ridge are not married. Hope finds Katie and Ridge together at the hospital and questions her about fainting at the wedding. When Katie says she is fine, Hope tells her this is not about her health. She knows about the two of them and what is going on. She knows Katie is fine. She made that decision to stop the wedding so Ridge would not marry her mom. Katie finally admits yes, she stopped the wedding because she loves Ridge."

        "Brooke: Katie said that her last checkup went well.",
        "Dr. Patrick: It did.",
        "Brooke: So, I don't understand. It wasn't too long ago. And if her body's rejecting her heart, then --",
        "Dr. Patrick: Oh, no one's suggesting that. I see no signs of transplant rejection.",
        "Brooke: So what happened?",
        "Dr. Patrick: We'll know more after I see the blood-test results.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Get off me.",
        "Quinn: Make me.",
        "Bill: You're a freak.",
        "Quinn: Oh, you have no idea. Get off me.",
        "Bill: Make me.",

        "[Crashing]",
        "Liam: Oh, God.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Liam: Hey. Hi.",
        "Hope: Hi. Can I -- can I come in?",
        "Liam: Yes! I'm sorry. Come on in, please. Uh...yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Why aren't you at the reception?",
        "Hope: Oh. Well, the wedding didn't happen.",
        "Bill: You like that, don't you?",
        "Quinn: Drawing your blood? You bet. I enjoy every painful second.",
        "Bill: You're even more disturbed than I remember.",
        "Liam: Katie passed out?",
        "Hope: Yeah, they took her to the hospital just to be safe, but my mom's with her now. It's scary. I know. I just -- I thought I should tell you right away, in case there's anything you needed to handle for her at work.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah. No, thank you. Thanks.",
        "Bill: [Muffled grunting]",
        "Hope: Was that -- was that your dad?",
        "Liam: Uh...yeah.",
        "[Crashing]",
        "Bill: [Moaning]",
        "Hope: Is he okay?",
        "Liam: Not feeling well. [Clears throat]",
        "Hope: Should we -- should we tell him about Katie or that the wedding didn't happen?",
        "Liam: No! N... [Chuckles] No. I don't...want to disturb him.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Bill: [Moaning]",
        "Hope: Oh, God, he sounds terrible.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I'm -- he'll be fine. I think -- I think he'll... be fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I just couldn't stand there knowing I was losing you. I -- this isn't me, stopping your wedding. I don't do these kinds of things.",
        "Brooke: Katie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: [Breathing heavily] Oh, my God. [Breathes deeply] It's everything I remembered. No wonder Brooke dumped you.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] No wonder you've been alone all these years. What man will put up with you? Glad I was drinking. That's what made it tolerable.",
        "Quinn: Go wipe that blood off.",
        "Bill: It's just a scratch. But if you need a bandage...",
        "Quinn: Mm. From that little dagger? Please. I hardly felt a thing.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: You sure you don't want to go check on your dad?",
        "Liam: No, I think he'd rather be alone. Um, why don't you tell me about Katie?",
        "Hope: Oh. Okay. Well, um...the wedding was going smoothly.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Uh, Mom and Ridge had just exchanged vows. Then I -- I don't know. Um... oh, Carter was talking. He had just finished this really beautiful passage. He was about to pronounce them husband and wife... and Katie just went down. I mean, we thought it was a heart attack at first. Of course, we called 911.",
        "Liam: Do you know now that it wasn't?",
        "Hope: No. No, we don't. But she was pretty alert rather quickly, you know, telling us that she was fine. She didn't need any help. Obviously, we weren't gonna take that chance, not with her history. I mean, mom went to the hospital with her, and she texted me, saying things were okay, just that they're running some tests.",
        "Liam: Oh, poor Katie. Must have been too stressful.",
        "Hope: Why would it have been stressful for Katie?",
        "Liam: [Breathes deeply] I, um... I -- I have something to tell you.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Liam: Katie... and Ridge...",
        "Hope: What? What?",
        "Liam: They have feelings for each other.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Uh, I'm so-- sorry. They -- they've been friends for years, but...",
        "Liam: No, no, that's not -- they have feelings -- like, deep feelings -- for each other.",
        "Hope: That's ridiculous.",
        "Liam: It's not ridiculous. I'm not kidding. They've been connecting ever since she --",
        "Hope: Liam, that's -- there's no way.",
        "Liam: This is the reason Katie collapsed. She's in love with Ridge, Hope.",
        "Hope: Are you serious?",
        "Liam: Yeah, they've -- they've, uh...been getting really close the last couple of weeks. They were both so hurt by what Brooke and my dad did. They've been hanging out. They've been bonding over that, over poetry...",
        "Hope: Poetry?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Uh, okay. Sorry. They -- they've known each other for a very long time, but there's -- there's... there's never been an attraction there.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but Ridge is different. I mean, don't tell me you haven't noticed that. He's, like -- it's like he came back from Paris a new man with a new attitude, new values. I mean, he was really blindsided by what your mom did to her sister.",
        "Hope: So -- so he just started spending time with Katie?",
        "Liam: I -- I don't know. I mean, I think that she's been... bottling this and trying to swallow her feelings and act like it's no problem -- \"Its okay. Brooke should go be with Ridge.\" But come on. Look what happened. She's in the hospital right now. She's gonna be furious with me for telling you, but... I can't do this. I can't keep this a secret when her health is on the line.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God. Ridge went to the hospital with them, too. They're all there -- Ridge, Mom, and Katie. If this is true, maybe it's all coming out now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Are you okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Um, I'm fine.",
        "Brooke: All right.",
        "Katie: I just need to tell you that I'm... I -- I'm sorry that I ruined your wedding.",
        "Brooke: Oh, stop. You did not ruin the wedding. I'm just happy that we were there and we could get you to the hospital.",
        "Katie: I really am fine.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Well, we'll wait and see what the doctor says about that.",
        "Ridge: He seemed encouraged by the tests so far.",
        "Brooke: Yes, he did. I just want to make sure, find out the real reason why Katie fainted.",
        "Katie: Well, it -- it may not be medical. I was just overwhelmed. I... it was just a feeling that --",
        "Brooke: Okay, well, those feelings, you really need to describe it to the doctor. It'll help him get to the bottom of this.",
        "Katie: There aren't words.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: It just must have been too much for Katie to take -- you know, trying to support the marriage, stand up for her sister -- and all the while knowing what it was she was giving up.",
        "Hope: What -- what was that you were saying earlier about poetry, that they were bonding?",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah. There's this -- there's this poem Katie was talking about. It's a poem that she and Ridge both really like. Why?",
        "Hope: 'Cause Carter was reading a poem when Katie went down. It could be total coincidence. I don't know. But you're telling me all of this now, and I...",
        "Liam: I really hope that I'm not -- that you're not upset.",
        "Hope: Well... honestly, if... if this is all true, then I -- I can't fault Ridge or Katie. You can't help what you feel. Circumstances bring people together. I get that. Oh! But I don't want to see my mom get hurt again. If -- if Ridge is having feelings for Katie, then he cannot marry her. I won't let her go through that. If he's not fully committed --",
        "Liam: Uh, whoa. What -- what are you doing?",
        "Hope: I... Liam, I have to go talk to them. I have to find out if this is true. Thank you. Oh, thank you so much for telling me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Great. How the hell did you break this?",
        "Quinn: That was you.",
        "Bill: Now, look -- I might be a little wasted, but I would remem--",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Oh, that's right.",
        "Quinn: If you, um... find my underwear...",
        "Bill: Yeah, I'll burn it.",
        "Quinn: That's fine. Well, um -- [Clears throat] -- I should go.",
        "Bill: Yes. Please.",
        "Quinn: Enjoy your hangover.",
        "Bill: I'll be fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I just want to make sure that you're happy and you're healthy and you're strong, so it would be helpful if you could tell the doctor what you were feeling.",
        "Katie: Uh, it was nothing.",
        "Brooke: Are you sure you didn't have any pain? Your heart wasn't hurting?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Hope: Hi.",
        "Brooke: Honey, hi.",
        "Hope: I'm so relieved to get your text. You're -- you're feeling better?",
        "Katie: Yeah, much.",
        "Brooke: We're gonna see what the doctor says.",
        "Hope: Okay. Have you been taking your anti-rejection drugs?",
        "Katie: Yes, of course.",
        "Brooke: That doesn't seem to be the problem. I'm gonna go find out some news. Is there anything you need?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Brooke: Okay, I'll be right back, okay? Coffee?",
        "Hope: No, I'm okay. Thanks. So, uh... do you think that they're gonna let you go home today?",
        "Katie: Um, yeah, probably. There's -- there's nothing wrong with me.",
        "Hope: I would say the opposite. I mean, you -- you fainted at my mom's wedding. You can't stand there and say that there isn't something seriously wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Ship horn blares]",
        "Liam: Dad, are we alone? Hey. We alone?",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Liam: Nothing. Are you okay?",
        "Bill: More or less.",
        "Liam: Okay. You know, Hope is here. Just now.",
        "Bill: Oka what? Wait. Why -- why isn't she at the reception?",
        "Liam: No reception. No wedding.",
        "Bill: What -- what?",
        "Liam: It didn't happen.",
        "Bill: Wait, wait, wait. What -- what are you saying?",
        "Liam: Katie, uh -- Katie passed out.",
        "Bill: Katie --",
        "Liam: She's okay, she's okay. She's at the hospital no they're checking her out. But, uh... Ridge and Brooke aren't married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Is that about Katie?",
        "Dr. Patrick: No. Sorry. I still haven't heard from the lab. I know this is difficult, but try not to worry. Her vital signs are good. All her scans, her EKG -- nothing's causing concern.",
        "Brooke: That's great. I'm very grateful for that. I am. It's just, she did collapse at my wedding, so something is not right. I just hope that you can figure out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I don't know what you're talking about, Hope. I'm fine, really.",
        "Hope: You are, aren't you? You're just fine. [Chuckles] You were standing at my mom's wedding, you're matron of honor, you're looking at Ridge... and it's stressful for you. It is so stressful that you fall to the floor.",
        "Katie: I had a moment. I felt faint.",
        "Hope: Is that all?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Hope: Are you sure it wasn't something else?",
        "Katie: Well, we're waiting for the doctor --",
        "Hope: Katie, I'm not talking about your health.",
        "Ridge: What are you talking about? Just say it.",
        "Hope: I know, Guys! I know! I know what is going on between the two of you. There's nothing wrong with you, is there? Nothing. Physically, you're fine. You made a decision -- you decided to stop the wedding because you didn't want Ridge to marry my mom. Admit it. Katie, come on. Talk to me.",
        "Katie: Yes, I stopped the wedding.",
        "Hope: Because you love Ridge?",
        "Katie: Yes, I do."
