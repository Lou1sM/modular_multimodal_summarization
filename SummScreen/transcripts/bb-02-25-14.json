        "Hope tells Ridge and Katie that she is disillusioned right now. Ever since Ridge came back, her mom has been beating herself up trying to prove that she is good enough for him. And now she finds they are involved with each other. So at least she agrees they are right to stop the wedding. She tells Ridge hat he can not marry her mom if he has feelings for Brooke's sister. Ridge says it looks like she is saying they are guilty of something so what is it. Hope says they are having an emotional entanglement. Ridge says they have done nothing wrong. Hope says that does not make it right though. Dr. Patrick and Brooke join them and he says conclusively they have re-run some tests and Katie did not have a heart attack. Everything looks healthy. He will discharge her but to be safe only if she has an adult who can be with her and look after her for the next 24 hours. Katie suggests Hope can stay with her. She agrees until she remembers she has to go to Paris tonight for a showing and she really wanted Brooke also to go along. She suggests perhaps Ridge can look after Katie. Brooke gives Ridge a kiss and glad he is understanding about this. Alone, Katie asks Hope what is she thinking. Hope says they need to think over what they are doing and now this will give them the opportunity to do that. Katie keeps saying there is no affair. Hope says okay, love without the affair but do you think Brooke will hear if differently. Ridge says it was figured out. He was supposed to be married right now. He can not control how someone makes him feel, but he was gonna marry her mother and make her happy and Katie was going to support that. Katie agrees yes although a little piece of her would have died inside. Bill wants to go see Brooke. Liam smells his breath and says he might want to re-think that. Bill says he thinks Katie might have done this for him so that he will have a second chance with Brooke. Forrester is through with Brooke. He has cast her as the woman who is not good enough for him. So Bill thinks he needs a shower and lots and lots of coffee. Carpe diem \u0096 seize the day. That's what he is going to do right now. And he wants Liam to remember ..right now is all he has. He reminds him that Hope is still around even though she is with Wyatt. She could have phoned Liam with her news but she came in person. But you can get rid of old history by making new history. Liam says he is not like his dad. He can not keep putting himself through the meat grinder and coming out in pieces. Bill says he can not predict what Brooke will do but he only knows what he can do.",
        "At home packing, Brooke is surprised to see Bill at her door. He tells her he is not sorry the wedding is off and perhaps this is a sign. She should not be marrying Ridge. She tells him that the two of them have been many things but meant to be isn't one of them. There's been too much damage. He wants to take her to dinner. She says she can't. He wants to love her for the rest of her life. She says that would have been nice. She would have wanted that more than anything but it has been poisoned. Hope says she does not know what else to do with this information. Katie assures her that nothing has happened. And their behaviors wouldn't have been any different if her feelings didn't exist. Hope says the timing was horrendous but she doesn't think she was wrong for stopping the wedding. They can't continue down this path and pretend it's not going to hurt somebody. Ridge says she is right. They do need to take a look at this as it has all changed since this morning. Katie laments that she feels like such a hypocrite. It's dangerous and the thing she fears most is herself."

        "Hope: Oh, my God. Your doctor's out there talking to mom right now.",
        "Katie: Hope, maybe you should take her home.",
        "Hope: He's going to come in here and tell you that there's nothing wrong with you. Then what?",
        "Ridge: He's gonna assume that it was some kind of a transient episode that didn't show up --",
        "Hope: I really don't feel like listening to you right now. I'm just -- I'm still a little disillusioned at the moment.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Hope: You broke my mom's heart and ever since you came back, she's been beating herself up trying to be good enough for you. And all this time, you're secretly involved with her sister.",
        "Katie: No, Hope. There's no involvement.",
        "Hope: Wait. Wait. I'm sorry. You -- you just told me that you were in love with him. And it did not come as a shock to you, so -- [Scoffs] I mean, I think you guys were right to stop the wedding. You cannot marry my mom if you're having feelings for her sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Patrick: This would be a distressing day for any bride.",
        "Brooke: I can get married any time. But what about Katie? People don't just collapse for no reason.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Dr. Patrick: Well, they have those last lab results for me. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Uh...my driver's outside. I'll -- I'll -- I'm out of here.",
        "Liam: Why? No. No, no. No.",
        "Bill: What? Why no? I'm gonna check on Brooke.",
        "Liam: You can't -- Brooke is at the hospital with Katie.",
        "Bill: Do you smell alcohol on my breath? [Exhales sharply]",
        "Liam: Oh, you need to think this through, Dad, really.",
        "Bill: No, no, no. I have been thinking it through, and... why is Katie in the hospital?",
        "Liam: What are you -- I just told you. She collapsed at the wedding.",
        "Bill: Right, right, right. You also said that she seems to be okay, so...",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Bill: You're gonna think I'm crazy, but... I feel like Katie might have done this for me.",
        "Liam: You think who did what for who?",
        "Bill: Katie. Brooke and I never would have had happened if not for Katie. [Sighs] I don't know -- call it my Spencer senses, but I -- I think Katie might have done this to give Brooke and me a second chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You believe in fate?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Not really, and neither do you.",
        "Bill: True.",
        "Liam: I mean, I will concede that sometimes things happen that seem like they were supposed to happen.",
        "Bill: He doesn't love her. Forrester. If it had been my wedding to Brooke, I would have walked over any number of unconscious bodies, gotten down to padre, and said, \"chop, chop with the 'I do's.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You seem to have decided that we're guilty of something. What is it?",
        "Hope: You're having an emotional entanglement with one person and proposing to another.",
        "Ridge: We've done nothing wrong.",
        "Hope: That doesn't make the situation right.",
        "Brooke: Dr. Patrick has some news for you.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Dr. Patrick: I can tell you conclusively that you've not had an M.I. -- a heart attack. We've repeated the test and the proteins we were looking for are undetectable. Your cardiac function, blood chemistry -- it all looks very healthy.",
        "Hope: That's a relief, then.",
        "Katie: Thank you, Dr. Patrick.",
        "Brooke: But something did happen, whether the tests show it or not.",
        "Dr. Patrick: Yes. And we never shrug off an unexplained loss consciousness. I'm gonna discharge you, but only if there is an adult who can keep an eye on you for the next 24 hours.",
        "Katie: Well, Hope will stay with me.",
        "Brooke: Good. It's settled.",
        "Dr. Patrick: I'll get the wheels in motion.",
        "Ridge: Thank you, Doctor.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry about this mess I've made.",
        "Brooke: Honey, don't worry about it. Ridge and I will be married after the 24 hours are up.",
        "Hope: What am I thinking? I have to go to Paris tonight. I -- yeah, we have the big European promotion for Hope for the Future.",
        "Brooke: Okay, well, I could stay with Katie.",
        "Hope: No. No, you can't. Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. I -- I really need you to come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. [Sighs] They said she's been discharged.",
        "Bill: So, Katie's totally okay?",
        "Liam: Well, no, they can't say that. Totally okay people don't faint for no reason.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? Women have been fainting over nothing for centuries. They fainted over Chopin, Valentino, my boy Elvis -- [As Elvis] Thank you very much.",
        "Liam: Why do you ask me for information and then ignore it?",
        "Bill: You know what I need? I need coffee. I need a lot of coffee and... [Sniffs, groans] I need a shower. So, you think Forrester is staying at Brooke's tonight even though the wedding didn't happen?",
        "Liam: I really couldn't tell you.",
        "Bill: What did Hope say?",
        "Liam: Honestly, I did most of the talking. Listen, maybe it's gonna work out the way you want. Maybe it should be this way. I just -- I can't say either way.",
        "Bill: Forrester is done with her. Brooke can't see it, but I can. Ridge cast her in the role of the woman that is never worthy of him, and Brooke played that role to the hilt for decades. But now it's time she stopped and let herself be loved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You're the star. You're the face that everybody knows.",
        "Brooke: That was a long time ago.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Yeah, but who's gonna vet my personal appearances and make introductions and, you know, take care of me if I happen to run into Steffy? [Sighs] I'm sorry. I know this sounds really selfish, but I need you on this one.",
        "Brooke: Honey, I can't really just drop everything right now. Besides, somebody needs to stay with Katie and take care of her.",
        "Hope: Well, Ridge can find someone. Ridge will do it. Ridge can manage things for her.",
        "Brooke: What? We were supposed to have a wedding tonight.",
        "Hope: I know, but, you know what, the food's already spoiled, and the champagne will keep. So will the vows. Come on, Mom. You know the Paris fashion calendar. They're not gonna put pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter week on hold just for me.",
        "Brooke: You're right.",
        "Ridge: You know, I could go.",
        "Hope: Nope. That won't work.",
        "Ridge: Why not?",
        "Brooke: She's right. That won't work. Because the office needs you. But this was supposed to be our wedding night.",
        "Hope: I'm really sorry. I know that I'm asking a lot, but, Mom, it would really mean a lot to me if you were there.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] It's really that important to you?",
        "Hope: More than you know.",
        "Brooke: Okay. I'm sorry. Got to go. Thank you for understanding. And you -- you do everything that Ridge tells you to do.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles nervously]",
        "Brooke: Okay?",
        "Hope: All right, I will call the pilot and make sure that the flight plan has been filed and that the jet's ready, and then I'll come pick you up.",
        "Brooke: Sounds good.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Brooke: I'm gonna go get ready. Bye. Mm! [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Bye.",
        "Katie: What was that? What are you doing?",
        "Hope: You guys need to work this out. You need to figure out what it is you're doing and now you have time to do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Look familiar?",
        "Liam: I do think I've seen you somewhere before, yeah.",
        "Bill: I'm talking about the threads, player. Come on. You see that guy? See him? That's who I am. The guy from this cover article. Leader of men, maker of worlds. That's what I was born to be. And you, too, for that matter.",
        "Liam: Look, man, I was born to be happy.",
        "Bill: Are you?",
        "Liam: I'm only missing one thing.",
        "Bill: That's right. And that's not bad. Me, on the other hand, I'm missing pretty much everything. Except my clothes. My company, my home, my wife, my kid, the other life I thought I was gonna have with Brooke -- but that's not gone. That is waiting to be recovered, and that's what I'm going to do. Carpe diem. Seize the day. That's what I've been doing my whole life, and that's what I'm going to do right now, because, Liam, remember this. Right now is all you have. I'm out of here, and I think you know where I'm going.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Um... Hope.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Bill: She didn't come here to tell you about Katie. She could have done that on the phone.",
        "Liam: She's with Wyatt, Dad.",
        "Bill: Why do you suppose she keeps throwing herself in front of you?",
        "Liam: Sometimes I suppose she's getting tired of our history.",
        "Bill: So how do you get rid of old history? By making new history.",
        "Liam: I don't know, Dad, but I am, in my own way. I am.",
        "Bill: By letting Hope make history with Wyatt? No. No.",
        "Liam: I'm not like you, okay? I can't do this. I can't just keep putting myself through the meat grinder and coming out in pieces. I mean, do you think that Brooke is any less committed to Ridge now than she was this morning?",
        "Bill: I can't predict what Brooke is going to do. I can only control what I am going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Look. [Sighs] I love you both. I admire you both. But I do not want to see my mom get hurt. Ridge, you are in no position to marry her, and you cannot pretend that you have feelings that you don't.",
        "Ridge: No one is pretending anything.",
        "Hope: How can you say that?",
        "Ridge: We've been nothing but honest with you.",
        "Hope: You haven't been honest with my mom. The last thing that she needs to hear on what she thought was going to be her wedding day was that her groom is having an affair with her sister.",
        "Katie: There's no affair! There's no affair.",
        "Hope: Okay. Love without the affair. Do you really think that she's gonna hear it any differently? You have got to figure this out.",
        "Ridge: It was figured out. I was supposed to be married right now.",
        "Hope: And would that have solved everything?",
        "Ridge: I don't know, Hope, why don't you tell me?",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: I can't control my feelings. I can't control how someone makes me feel. The only thing I can control are my actions. So I was gonna marry your mother today, and I was going to make her happy -- try my best to make her happy for the rest of her life. And Katie was gonna support that.",
        "Hope: Is he right?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Hope: Would a little piece of you have died inside?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Bill: Hi.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I'd be lying if I said I was sorry. How's Katie doing?",
        "Brooke: She's doing good.",
        "Bill: Good. Can I come in?",
        "Brooke: Have you been drinking?",
        "Bill: That was before.",
        "Brooke: You didn't drive here, did you?",
        "Bill: No, no. I told my driver I would call him if I needed him.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Well, you should come in and give him a call.",
        "Bill: Packing or unpacking?",
        "Brooke: Packing.",
        "Bill: Obviously not for a honeymoon.",
        "Brooke: Obviously.",
        "Bill: Ridge isn't here, is he?",
        "Brooke: No, he's taking care of your wife.",
        "Bill: She's not my wife. And you're not his.",
        "Brooke: I will be very soon.",
        "Bill: You think this might have been a sign? That the wedding wasn't supposed to happen.",
        "Brooke: Bill, you and I have been many things, but meant to be isn't one of them.",
        "Bill: How do you know? How do you know?",
        "Brooke: Because there's been a lot of damage. That's how I know.",
        "Bill: Let me take you to dinner.",
        "Brooke: I can't.",
        "Bill: Let me love you for the rest of your life.",
        "Brooke: Now, that would have been nice. I would have wanted that more than anything. But everything was poisoned. You know that.",
        "Bill: So what do you want to do instead? Keep wishing for things that can't be? Katie will never take me back, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I know, and I tried to fix that for you. I did, but...",
        "Bill: It was the wrong life for me.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, I guess it was. You are really very special. There's no one like you.",
        "Bill: Let me stay.",
        "Brooke: Bill.",
        "Bill: Come upstairs with me.",
        "Brooke: No. [Scoffs]",
        "Bill: He doesn't love you the way I do.",
        "Brooke: I don't want him to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I don't know what else to do with this information.",
        "Katie: Hope, I want you to know that nothing has happened. We haven't crossed the line. Our time together has been totally innocent. I have these feelings, and I'm not ashamed of them, but our behavior toward each other wouldn't have been any different if they didn't exist.",
        "Hope: Until now. Or else he would be married to somebody else. That's essentially staking your claim on him.",
        "Katie: I realize that you think that stopping the wedding was a mistake.",
        "Hope: No, I -- I don't think stopping the wedding was a mistake, because you have feelings for each other. I do think that your timing was horrendous.",
        "Ridge: Hope. Nothing's happened.",
        "Hope: What I'm trying to say to you is that these private harmless feelings you have for each other, that you think no one has to know about have escaped into the real world, and it has affected all three of you. So, do you really want to continue down this path pretending like it's not going to hurt anybody?",
        "Ridge: You're right. We have to look at this.",
        "Katie: Do we?",
        "Hope: Ridge, I know that you're a good person. I do. But, I mean, you shouldn't force yourself into a life that you might not want anymore.",
        "Ridge: It's what I wanted this morning. And those vows weren't just words.",
        "Hope: But you didn't know then what you know now. Look, we're only going to be gone for a couple of days. So use that time to figure this out, okay? The worst thing that you could do to my mom is make a promise to her that you can't keep. I don't think that she could stand having you and then lose you all over again.",
        "Katie: God, I feel like a hypocrite.",
        "Ridge: Just got to be careful. Think about what we're doing here.",
        "Katie: It may be a little late for that.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Nothing is ruined.",
        "Katie: I said the words. You know how I feel.",
        "Ridge: I knew before. So, a couple of days, huh?",
        "Katie: It seems impossible.",
        "Ridge: Maybe it isn't.",
        "Katie: It seems dangerous.",
        "Ridge: Why? What's the thing you're most afraid of?",
        "Katie: Myself."
