{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7013 ~ Rick & Maya celebrate; Ridge & Steffy debate a takeover; Ivy talks to Liam about Steffy."], "Recap": ["Liam asks Ivy if she is okay as she seems a little tense. She brings up Steffy being there today. She saw them together. Maya loves having champagne in the middle of the day. Rick says he has another present for her, special and unique just like she is. He urges her to open it. FC would not be where it is today without her. It is a necklace that he asked Ivy to design. He puts it on Maya. Ivy told him it was the most expensive piece she has ever designed so that shows Maya just how important she is to him. She is grateful but tries to make it seem that she doesn't need all of this from him. Steffy drops in on her dad, Ridge. He tells her that Liam came by and told him about the takeover of FC. He wants to know if she is in. Eric tells Brooke that he did talk to Rick and he has his full support. He has total confidence in their son. Brooke is happy to hear that. Eric says this is still his company and putting Rick in charge is about the smartest thing he has ever done. Rick has made some choices that Eric would not have done but whatever he is doing he wants him to keep doing it. She said she had her concerns about Rick getting rid of Caroline, taking up with Maya and then moving her in his house so fast. She is shocked that Eric is going to live in the guest house now. Eric thinks Maya can keep Rick's feet on the ground and bring him down to earth.", "Liam tells Ivy just so she knows there is nothing going on with him and Steffy. Ivy says she knows. She stayed and talked to Steffy and she made herself quite clear that she wanted Liam as a lover and not just a business partner. And she told Steffy she is not buying that. She is not going to get Liam. Steffy tells Ridge that Liam needs their help. This is not about Ivy or Caroline, it is about FC. That is all the motivation Liam needs. She lost everything with Liam, the marriage and the baby and she doesn't want to hear about anything else. She still loves him and wants him back. That is the kind of energy they need at FC and it won't happen without them. Something has to be done. Ivy tells Liam that she doesn't want him to think she is crazy jealous but she will not tolerate this from Steffy, it is not right. She would love for Steffy to get right back on that plane and go back to Paris but she will not let this bother her. It does not have to interfere in their relationship. Steffy says it is that simple if it means she can be back with Liam. She has lost him before and she will not again. Ridge tells her his dad raised him when he didn't have to as another man's son so he can not backstab him now. Buoyed by their bubbly, Rick and Maya take a bubble bath and he tells her that he feel rejuvenated and feels like they can do anything. Liam tells Ivy that he really did not know that Steffy still had feelings like this. She is sexy but Ivy is more his type. He says he is still going after FC if it is okay with Ivy, but without Steffy or as long as she knows that getting him is not part of the deal. At the office Brooke looks at the quarterly numbers and says it looks like Rick is on the right track. This calls for a celebration and she remembers where the hidden bottle is and drags it out and has a stiff drink. Steffy tells Ridge that Bill will not be involved in this. She has Liam's word. They have done this before and now they have to do it again. They deserve this. She wants another shot at Liam, it should be theirs, not Rick and Maya; they will be gone."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Liam: Are you okay?", "Ivy: Yeah, I am. I'm just a little tense.", "Liam: You have a, uh -- a bad day at work?", "Ivy: Uh, no. I've been out of the office.", "Liam: Oh, has Rick got you running errands again? What -- what is it this time?", "Ivy: Well, he did ask me to do something. You're not gonna believe this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Champagne in the middle of the day -- I love it.", "Rick: I have a present for you, too.", "Maya: Another present?", "Rick: This one's special. It's as unique and precious as you are to me.", "Maya: Rick, you've already given me so many gifts.", "Rick: Yeah, but none like this one.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Oh, this day is just full of surprises.", "Ridge: Hi. You got my text?", "Steffy: Yeah.", "Ridge: Come here. Hi. Listen, I know last time we talked, it got --", "Steffy: Now, why does everyone want to just butt heads with me right now?", "Ridge: Hey, hey. Shh. No one wants that. Liam came by, and he told me about his plans to take over the company.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Forrester is in good hands.", "Brooke: I'm glad to hear you say that, Eric.", "Eric: That's why I wanted to see you -- in case you wondered about my sudden return to L.A.", "Brooke: You spoke to Rick?", "Eric: Yes, I did, and he has my full support.", "Brooke: He does?", "Eric: Yes. I have total confidence in our son.", "Brooke: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Yeah, I've worked with diamonds before, but nothing like this. It's so hard, sitting back and watching Rick lavish Maya in gifts.", "Liam: That's...why you're so tense?", "Ivy: Steffy.", "Liam: Steffy?", "Ivy: Yeah, that's why -- Liam, I know she was here today. I saw you two together.", "Liam: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Liam came to you and told you the plan?", "Ridge: He didn't want to have you keep a secret from me, I guess.", "Steffy: Huh. He tried to get you on board?", "Ridge: Are you on board?", "Steffy: It's tempting -- taking control of Forrester, running Rick out of the building.", "Ridge: Stabbing your grandfather in the back. You've got to realize something. If we do something like this, we wouldn't just undermine his authority. We'd be ending his career.", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Forrester is still my company.", "Brooke: But Rick has your backing as C.E.O.", "Eric: Putting Rick in charge, I think, was about the smartest business decision I ever made.", "Brooke: When I heard you were home, I thought maybe --", "Eric: Yes, so did he.", "Brooke: You heard everything?", "Eric: But then I saw this.", "Brooke: The latest profit reports.", "Eric: He got off to kind of a rocky start -- made some choices I didn't quite agree with. Whatever he's doing, I want him to keep doing it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Maya... you've played a huge role in my success. Without you, I wouldn't be where I am today. I want to share that with you. So, go on. Come on. Open it.", "Maya: [Chuckles softly] [Chuckles] It's a necklace.", "Rick: One of a kind.", "Maya: It's beautiful.", "Rick: I asked Ivy to design something that was as original and elegant as you.", "Maya: I love it.", "Rick: Well, let's see. Ivy says it was the most expensive piece she's ever designed. But it doesn't compare to how valuable you are to me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: I am thrilled you're supporting Rick. But I have to be honest -- I had my concerns when I first got back to town.", "Eric: You and me both.", "Brooke: The way Rick's marriage ended, his relationship with Maya, how he moved in to your place and took down Stephanie's portrait above the fireplace.", "Eric: Surprised me, too.", "Brooke: So, it's back up, right?", "Eric: No, it's in the guest house, where I'll be staying.", "Brooke: What?", "Eric: Rick and Maya are comfortable in the big house. I'm gonna let them stay here.", "Brooke: So, you're not worried about this relationship and how fast they're moving -- Rick's anger?", "Eric: He blew it, he exploded, and he understands that. And he knows that he can't let that happen again. But I see that Maya is kind of a stabilizing force in his life. You know, our son has a tendency to rev things up, but I think she can keep his feet on the ground, bring him down to earth.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: [Gasps softly]", "Rick: Don't say it's too much.", "Maya: I won't... but it is.", "Rick: This is your life now.", "Maya: I know, and I appreciate it more and more every day -- every opportunity, every new experience and sharing it all with you. But I'm still getting used to it. You're -- this is normal for you. [Chuckles]", "Rick: It's not?", "Maya: Well, for people like you and your family and the blueblood clientele of Forrester. You know, I've been thinking -- what about all of those other people, the people who could be clients but aren't yet?", "Rick: What about them?", "Maya: There's a lot of demographics, Rick, that we haven't thought about. It's not just people with trust funds who enjoy beautiful clothes. Forrester should speak to everyone.", "Rick: I never thought about it like that. You see, you are good for me. In so many ways.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: I saw what Steffy did.", "Liam: Got a little worked up, didn't she?", "Ivy: Liam, she was on top of you, kissing your face off.", "Liam: I know. I promise you, I did not know she was gonna do that.", "Ivy: Hey, I'm not blaming you.", "Liam: Just so you know, there's nothing going on.", "Ivy: I know. I had a conversation with her after you left.", "Liam: You did?", "Ivy: Yeah, and she told me her entire plan. She wants to come back here and run Forrester with you but not as your business partner -- as a couple.", "Liam: God. You know how important this is to me -- to get Rick off your back, to give Caroline the freedom to work. That company needs new leadership, and I thought Steffy was the right choice, but --", "Ivy: But it's not gonna happen.", "Liam: Well, not like this, it's not.", "Ivy: Okay, good. That's exactly what I told her. I'm not comfortable with her coming on to you, Liam. I mean, she can sell her stocks and you can convince her family to take all of this on board. She can even sit in Rick's chair, but... she's not gonna get you back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: He can't do this without us. Combining our stocks will make it plausible. Liam needs our help, dad.", "Ridge: What about Caroline? The last time you were in here, you didn't seem that happy about it.", "Steffy: Dad, this isn't about Caroline -- or Ivy. They can take care of themselves. This is about Forrester.", "Ridge: For us, not for Liam.", "Steffy: For Liam, too. He knows what this company means to our family. That -- that should be all the motivation he needs. And Ivy shouldn't have anything to do with this. I mean, look, they were dating, but we were married. We were gonna have a family together.", "Ridge: Steffy, come on.", "Steffy: No, I don't want to hear how hard this has been on Ivy -- working with Rick, being criticized. I lost everything -- my marriage, my baby... the man I loved.", "Ridge: You still love him, don't you?", "Steffy: Yes. And I want him back. This is my chance, dad. Liam knows how good we are together, and he hasn't forgotten. You know, it's just the way we encourage each other, and that's the kind of energy we need back at Forrester, and I know that's what you want, too -- you know, that rush, that feeling of being revved up going to work. But it won't happen without us. Something has to be done, dad.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: I wasn't very supportive at first, but I'm starting to see some real positives with Rick and Maya.", "Brooke: You're not concerned about anything? The gun?", "Eric: Oh, well, that's unacceptable, of course -- dangerous, irresponsible. But the fact is I do understand what drove him to it. I mean, it's not something I would do myself, but I remember the feeling. A long time ago, Ridge took the woman I loved from me, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: I still can't believe he didn't make you take that down.", "Rick: He understands what it means, what it represents.", "Maya: And what is that?", "Rick: All the importance that you've brought to my life. It's just like the necklace and all the other gifts I've given you. It's just -- just my way of saying, \"thank you.\"", "Maya: You know, that's not fair.", "Rick: Why not?", "Maya: You can't say, \"thank you\" to a thank-you gift.", "Rick: Why can't you?", "Maya: It's the rule.", "Rick: Well, since when do we follow the rules? We make our own rules. Would you like some more champagne?", "Maya: Yes, but I'm gonna take mine to go.", "Rick: Go where?", "Maya: You want a thank-you? What goes better with diamonds than bubbles... and more bubbles? I'm gonna get the water running. You meet me upstairs.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: I don't want you to think I'm being crazy jealous or anything. It's just I'm just trying to protect what is important to me.", "Liam: I promise you, I'm not gonna let this be a problem.", "Ivy: But that's the thing, Liam. Women like Steffy -- they always are. They honestly believe that your past with them is more important than a future with anyone else. And I get it. You guys have a history. You do. I get that. But that doesn't eclipse everything else. It doesn't make what she did right.", "Liam: I really don't want you to worry about this.", "Ivy: Thank you. And I-I know. I-I'm not. I'm not. It's just -- ugh! I mean, do I want her to get on a plane back to paris? Yes, I absolutely do, but, I mean, having her in town -- it's not a threat to us. I know how much you love me. And after what I saw today, I have absolutely no doubt about that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: I agree with everything you're saying.", "Steffy: Then there's only one choice to make.", "Ridge: Until we have to deal with the consequences.", "Steffy: Rick's out. We're in.", "Ridge: It's not that simple, Steffy.", "Steffy: It is simple if it means that I can be with Liam!", "Ridge: He's offering that to you?", "Steffy: It's gonna happen, dad.", "Ridge: Come on.", "Steffy: Ivy thinks that she can replace me in Liam's life. She's wrong. I lost him before. I won't do it again.", "Ridge: Okay. So, that's it, then, huh -- you and Liam? All right. What about your granddad? He built this company from the ground up.", "Steffy: Yeah, and he's letting Rick destroy it.", "Ridge: He's making mistakes. I agree with you. But he's my dad. He raised me when he didn't have to. I'm not the man's kid, and he was there for me. He was loyal to me.", "Steffy: Up until now. His loyalty is now with Rick.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: I remember the first time we did this.", "Rick: Your apartment.", "Maya: On the sly, plotting behind everyone's back.", "[Both chuckle]", "Rick: It worked.", "Maya: Yeah. Look at us now -- out in the open, just like you promised. I'll never take this for granted. I want to savor every single moment together. Let's always remember to have little celebrations like this, okay?", "Rick: Oh, just you wait. This house is gonna be celebration central.", "Maya: [Chuckles]", "Rick: All my life, Ridge dominated this place, just like he dominates everything else.", "Maya: He's not here anymore.", "Rick: No, he's not. I'm the number-one son. My dad gave me this house and his support.", "Maya: I knew you'd win him over.", "Rick: You know, Maya, when I look into those big, beautiful eyes of yours, I feel like I'm invincible, like I could do almost anything.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: I really didn't know Steffy still had feelings like this.", "Ivy: Well, apparently, you are very hard to get over.", "Liam: Oh, yeah, yeah. Like the flu.", "Ivy: And her, too, I imagine. I mean, look at her, Liam. She's stunning. She's sexy. She's beautiful.", "Liam: If you haven't noticed, that's kind of my type.", "Ivy: [Chuckles] You know, you could have it all with her. You could have power and success. You could take over Forrester. But you chose us.", "Liam: I'm still going after Forrester.", "Ivy: Okay. Well, who knows? I mean, Steffy might still help.", "Liam: Yeah, if -- if -- that's okay with you.", "Ivy: Yeah. Yep, it's okay... as long as she knows that getting you back is not a part of the bargain.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: [Laughs] See that? That is commitment. That is dedication.", "Eric: That's what I saw, too.", "Brooke: I think our son has this company moving in the right direction.", "Eric: He does. He got bogged down in the beginning, but he's pulled himself right out of it.", "Brooke: Well, that gives us reason to celebrate. Do you think Rick found that secret bottle of scotch?", "Eric: Oh, certainly not. He doesn't know where it is. You don't even remember where it is.", "Brooke: I know where it is. I'm gonna get it.", "Eric: All right. I'll get the glasses. But this is only for a special occasion, you know? Oh, yeah?", "Brooke: Oh, yeah. I think this qualifies.", "Eric: I think so, too -- celebrating my son's success with his beautiful mother.", "Brooke: Aww.", "Eric: Mm, yeah. This is nice. Thank you, my dear.", "Brooke: Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]", "Eric: Cheers.", "Brooke: Oh [Chuckles] Of course. Cheers. [Exhales sharply]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I've worked really hard to prove myself to my father.", "Maya: It took a long time.", "Rick: Then you came in to my life, and everything else just fell into place.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Rick and Maya are gonna run granddad's business into the ground!", "Ridge: He trusts them.", "Steffy: I don't want to betray him or act against our family, but he put us in this position.", "Ridge: Let me ask you something. You would really partner with Spencer? Do you remember how long it took to get the company back from him?", "Steffy: Bill won't have anything to do with it.", "Ridge: Why not? It's his son. They're working together.", "Steffy: Not on this. Liam assured me he'd be the only one involved -- not bill. So, we'll talk to the lawyers, write up an agreement. Spencers will be profit participants only. But the ultimate authority will remain with us.", "Ridge: Bill's never gonna agree to that.", "Steffy: Liam will. They're already part of the company, dad. They own stake in this, too. And they hate what Rick is doing just as much as we do.", "Ridge: They're protecting their own interests!", "Steffy: And we have to protect ours! We have done this before. We have saved Forrester when nobody else could. Now we have to do it again. We deserve this.", "Ridge: Yeah. What else, Steffy? What do you deserve? Another shot with Liam?", "Steffy: Yes. But more than anything, we should be running Forrester Creations, not Rick and Maya. Maya and Rick have to go, dad. We do this, join forces with Liam -- Forrester Creations is ours and Rick and Maya are gone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: [Chuckles]"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAE7CZ-eL2Q"}
