        "Taylor: Rick was kissing Phoebe?",
        "Ridge: That won't happen anymore.",
        "Taylor: I thought you told me this whole situation was under control.",
        "Ridge: It is under control. He stopped his relationship with her last night.",
        "Taylor: And how did Phoebe deal with that?",
        "Ridge: She's angry at me. Disappointed in Rick.",
        "Taylor: So it was more than just a little crush?",
        "Ridge: She told she thought she was in love with him.",
        "Taylor: Oh, my goodness. Well, I think I better talk to her.",
        "Ridge: Well, she's at work.",
        "Taylor: She's still able to work with Rick?",
        "Ridge: He's not going to be a problem anymore. Look, I just wanted you to know what's been going on. We should probably give Phoebe a little extra TLC the next while. And just keep a watchful eye on things.",
        "Taylor: Well, why should we be watchful, if everything's under control?",
        "Ridge: Because it doesn't hurt to be cautious, does it?",
        "Taylor: Wait a second, let me just figure this out. Now, if Rick was kissing Phoebe last night, and then he turned around and ended the relationship, why did he even do that?",
        "Ridge: Because he talked with Brooke.",
        "Taylor: Brooke?",
        "Ridge: I asked her to go over there and handle it with him and she did. So, now, it's over.",
        "Taylor: You think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brio: Phoebe? Kiddo. I love the dreamy, space-case look as much as the next photographer, but I don't think that's what we're going for today.",
        "Phoebe: What?",
        "Brio: Do you want to take five?",
        "Phoebe: No, no, I'm good.",
        "Brio: I know this is boring, but I need you to focus.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, I will.",
        "Brio: You're at a party, you're having the time of your life. You're on the red carpet, going to your first awards show. You're a shoo-in to win. You know, I need more than a smile, Phoebe. I want to see a young woman on top of the world. That's it! Right there. That's what I want! Yes! Beautiful. Beautiful. That's it! Beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: This could really be something wonderful.",
        "Stephanie: Well, it certainly a prime location.",
        "Eric: Yeah, it's the highest rate of foot traffic on Rodeo Drive.",
        "Stephanie: And practically across the street from Jackie M.",
        "Eric: Well, yes. We're lucky it was available to lease. I just wish we would have bought it. You know, and we would have an asset to sell in case this doesn't succeed.",
        "Stephanie: What do you mean, doesn't succeed? Of course it's going to succeed.",
        "Eric: It will. I'm just saying --",
        "Stephanie: Are you having doubts?",
        "Eric: It would be nice to have a safety net.",
        "Stephanie: This whole concept of selling and owning our own retail stores, was your idea. It was a good idea. If you don't think this is going to work, then what the hell we are doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Nick clears his throat]",
        "Nick: Are you lost? I understand that you may be moving in down the street, and we might be neighbors?",
        "Brooke: Actually, yes. I was just on my way down there.",
        "Nick: It's a very expensive street. I guess you caught the loan officer in an optimistic mood.",
        "Brooke: Forrester Originals is a sure bet.",
        "Nick: Come on, Brooke, no such thing as a sure bet. If anybody would know that --",
        "Brooke: We should have opened up our own retail stores a long time ago. That way, you won't have been able to torpedo our collection the way that you did.",
        "Nick: Torpedo? I've never heard that word in the fashion business. Torpedo. I think I like that. Torpedo.",
        "Brooke: Look, I didn't stop by to trade barbs with you.",
        "Nick: Then, why did you stop by?",
        "Brooke: This isn't about the business.",
        "Nick: I'm listening.",
        "Brooke: Actually, I'm the one whose been waiting to hear something from you about our divorce.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Look, I don't need to be reminded of what's at stake there.",
        "Stephanie: This was your idea, wasn't it?",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: And you knew that there was an enormous risk involved.",
        "Eric: Which is exactly why we never branched out into retail before.",
        "Stephanie: Stop second guessing yourself, Eric. It's a mistake. Okay? Now, the media is going to be all over you, all of us, these next few months. You have to appear confident, strong, determined. There can't be any mistakes, any miscues, because if that happens, if they sense that, this whole thing will coming tumbling down on top of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Okay, even if Rick did agree to stop seeing Phoebe, who's to say that Phoebe won't keep going after him?",
        "Ridge: Rick broke up with her.",
        "Taylor: Yes, because his mother told him to. I mean, he's a smart guy, okay? I'm sure he told Phoebe that he just said that to shut his mother up.",
        "Ridge: No, that door is now closed.",
        "Taylor: You don't understand, Ridge. She's an 18-year-old girl and she thinks that she's in love.",
        "Ridge: She's not in love. He's a grown man. Practically related.",
        "Taylor: Okay, listen, I know this is a very complicated situation, and after the year that Phoebe's already had, she doesn't need any more complications. But you have to look at this from her perspective.",
        "Ridge: She'll get over it, okay? We'll help her.",
        "Taylor: Yes, of course, we're going to help her, but it isn't like that. I mean, she's not a little girl anymore. She's not just going to get over it. She's a young lady and she's experiencing her first time of real heartbreak. I'm sure she has to be devastated.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Camera flashing]",
        "Brio: Beautiful, Phoebe. Radiant. Really nice.",
        "Rick: You're doing really well",
        "Brio: It is now.",
        "Brio: Okay, that's it. I've got what I need. Let's pack this up and we'll get the rest later. Better get these upstairs. Great work, Phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: Thank you. You too. Finally, we're alone.",
        "Rick: Can't do this here. Somebody might see us. So, I have a better idea. Follow me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: It's been weeks since we signed our disillusion papers. Don't you think we should have heard something by now?",
        "Nick: Isn't that question for your lawyer? But you come over here to ask me? Why would you do that?",
        "Brooke: I just told you.",
        "Nick: I think that's an excuse.",
        "Brooke: Fine. Why do you think I'm here? Do you think I came here to spy on you?",
        "Nick: No, I think you're curious and I'm not talking about clothes.",
        "Brooke: Oh, you think I'm curious about your personal life. Is that it?",
        "Nick: That's it.",
        "Brooke: Honestly, I've been too busy trying to keep my life on track with Ridge. I haven't even thought about you and Taylor.",
        "Nick: I understand there have been a few problems connected to Rick and Phoebe.",
        "Brooke: That's over. I asked Rick to stop seeing Phoebe.",
        "Nick: I thought you supported them?",
        "Brooke: I did. But they kissed. And that I can not condone.",
        "Nick: Brooke, do you really think that those feelings are going to go away because you forbid them from spending time with each other? You know better than that. Together or not. The attraction will be there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Phoebe is heartbroken and she blames me and Brooke for that.",
        "Taylor: Well, I told you I'll talk her about it.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Taylor: So, what are you going to do if she doesn't want to stay here with you because she's angry at you?",
        "Ridge: Well, I still think we need to keep an eye on her. I don't know how much time you've been spending at home lately.",
        "Taylor: I can take care of Phoebe. I can take care of myself.",
        "Ridge: Taylor, when I was out looking for Phoebe last night, were you with Nick?",
        "Taylor: I will look out for Phoebe. You have my word on that.",
        "Ridge: Doc, I know you still got to be hurting. You were planning a whole life with Thorne and Ally. It's got to be effecting you now.",
        "Taylor: Yes, I miss them, but if you're implying that I'm on the rebound, I'm not. That's not what's happening.",
        "Ridge: What is happening? You're not going to tell me this is serious?",
        "Taylor: Let's just say I'm finally starting to understand what Brooke saw in Nick. Because now I see it, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I thought you'd left? Is there something else you want to say?",
        "Brooke: Actually, yes.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Brooke: Not that it's really any of your business, but you're right. Forbidding Rick and Phoebe to see each other would have been a terrible mistake.",
        "Nick: But that's what you did, didn't you?",
        "Brooke: I asked Rick to stop seeing her.",
        "Nick: And you told him to do for you, didn't you?",
        "Brooke: Nick, there was so much tension in the house, it had to be done for Hope and R.J.",
        "Nick: Oh, that's a bunch of crap, Brooke. You're placating Forrester and you know it. I know you. You would never tell your son to do something that wouldn't follow his heart.",
        "Brooke: I didn't have a problem with their friendship. But then, they took it one step too far.",
        "Nick: Too far for who? You or Ridge?",
        "Brooke: This is Ridge's daughter we're talking about. How would you react if it were your own child? How would you feel if it were Hope? I'm sorry. I have to go down the street. They're waiting for me.",
        "Nick: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Come on, through here. Did you hear that?",
        "Phoebe: No.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, we can't be doing this.",
        "Phoebe: Well, it was your idea.",
        "Rick: I know, but, see, I told my mom that I wouldn't see you anymore and your dad thinks that this is over.",
        "Phoebe: And it isn't.",
        "Rick: Do you realize the problems we're going to cause if people find out about this?",
        "Phoebe: Well, then, we won't tell them.",
        "Rick: I just don't like lying about it. I really don't.",
        "Phoebe: Well, what choice do we have?",
        "Rick: There's always a choice.",
        "Phoebe: What does that mean?",
        "Rick: It just means that I want you to understand the magnitude of the situation, that's all.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, but -- I mean, is this what you want? Do you want to be with me?",
        "Rick: Yes. Yes. Yes, I do. Yes.",
        "Phoebe: Then, it's worth it, right?",
        "Rick: It is. But not everything is that easy.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, well, it doesn't have to be that complicated either. I mean, you said you would stop seeing me to protect your mom's relationship with my dad, right? But after they're married, then it's not a problem anymore, right? I mean, we don't have to keep it a secret forever. Just until after the wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: This is an enormous risk. But it's -- you know, to suddenly start worrying about it --",
        "Ridge: What's not worth worrying about?",
        "Stephanie: Everything. Your father, all of a sudden, is apprehensive.",
        "Eric: I mean, starting a new retail venture is completely different from unveiling a new collection. We have to generate a whole different kind of buzz. And not just in the fashion press, but in the mainstream media as well. We need to reintroduce ourselves to the world.",
        "Ridge: And I know exactly how to do that. I've been thinking about this, too. I've got the perfect solution. We have our wedding right here. We shut down Rodeo Drive. We jam Beverly Hills with press. And we get married right in front of the store, on the day of our big grand opening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Phoebe, I'm sorry. I just hate sneaking around like this.",
        "Phoebe: No, we wouldn't have to if our parents aren't so closed-minded.",
        "Rick: Rick's dad is the one with the problem. My mom's just trying to please him.",
        "Phoebe: It's just because she doesn't want to lose him. I get that.",
        "Rick: So do I. I mean, I grew up with it. My mom always tying herself in knots, trying to be what ridge wanted her to be. Living her life by ridge's rules. And now, she wants me to do that. And I just can't --",
        "Phoebe: Me neither. And we shouldn't have to.",
        "Rick: Nobody can know about this. Not even suspect it.",
        "Phoebe: Just for a few weeks.",
        "Rick: Well, my mom and Nick's divorce will be finalized in a few days.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, and after our parents are married, we won't have to hide our feelings as much.",
        "Rick: And they'll be happy. So will we.",
        "Phoebe: Very happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You want to turn our wedding into a publicity stunt?",
        "Ridge: I want to use all of our assets to make this store a success.",
        "Stephanie: But can you actually shut down rodeo drive?",
        "Ridge: I already talked to the mayor. He's willing to discuss it.",
        "Brooke: This is our wedding.",
        "Ridge: Look, we can have private ceremony later, just for us. This is an amazing opportunity to focus an international spotlight on our grand opening. You're the one who said we had to get the mainstream media involved, right? Brooke, what garners publicity better than a celebrity wedding? Our flagship would be on every magazine on the supermarket stands. We would be talked about on every morning show there is.",
        "Stephanie: I think he's right. It would guarantee enormous publicity.",
        "Ridge: Especially if we did it with sophistication and class.",
        "Brooke: Class? Bleachers for the fans and velvet ropes for the paparazzi?",
        "Ridge: I'm talking the must see event of the year. Elegant, Hollywood wedding on the most glamorous street in the world.",
        "Eric: It would be expensive.",
        "Brooke: You can't be really considering this, Eric.",
        "Eric: Actually, I am. I think maybe you should, too.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it could work. I think it could.",
        "Ridge: We're not just talking a store opening here, we're talking about securing the future of this company. You know, we have to do something bold here. This is the legacy of our children.",
        "Stephanie: And when have you ever had a problem making a spectacle of yourself?",
        "Brooke: Okay, okay. I never said I wasn't going to do it. It's just not the wedding that I had imagined.",
        "Ridge: Come on. It's not really what I had planned, either originally. But we're going to get married, right? Whether it's privately or in front of the world, as long as we end up husband and wife, that's what I want most in the world.",
        "Brooke: Me too.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Now, I promise you nothing is going to stand in our way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Phoebe, we've got to stop this.",
        "Phoebe: Rick, we're just kissing, we're not doing anything dangerous."
