        "Ridge tells Katie that he doesn't know how Hope figured this out, but she and Brooke are in Paris so this gives him and Katie time to figure all of this out. Katie tells him it is not too late; he can still marry Brooke. He says and pretend none of this they are feeling isn't happening. It's time they are honest with each other. Bill asks Brooke if maybe this is an omen. She says she does not believe in omens. Hope walks in and Bill tells her that he feels like he has been given a second chance. Hope says she thinks that might be his fever talking. She was at Liam's earlier and knows he was not feeling well. He tells her he tied one on and that won't be happening again. He sees Hope's bags and asks if she is going somewhere. Brooke tells him they are going to Paris. Bill quips so important that she would leave her fiance on their almost wedding day. She reminds him they will be married when she gets back. He says okay but he will be there waiting for her. He is convinced this is not over. Wyatt handles some of the Stephanie Forrester jewelry collection and tells his mom each piece is more exquisite than the next. Eric asked him to have it appraised. Quinn is abnormally quiet and he asks her what's up. She says she just had the most fascinating encounter with his father. She knew the wedding was today and he'd be bummed so she went to see him at Liam's. Wyatt laughs and accuses his mother of sticking it to Bill. She says no, he really was hurt and vulnerable and she found herself feeling for him ..and seeing him hurt at the same time. She wonders if that sounds sadistic ..loving and hating at the same time. She confesses they have an unpredictable relationship and even more so after today. Wyatt laughs and says she still has not told him what happened. All she will say is that they took it to a whole new level of understanding. Wyatt tells her Ridge did not marry Brooke after all. Before he can say more, Hope calls and needs to see him.",
        "At Brooke's house Wyatt sees the bags and hopes that Hope is moving in with him. She tells him of the Paris trip. He also says he needs to go, it will be romance 24/7. She says unfortunately it will be HFTF 24/7. Bill walks in on Liam and he wants to be sure Bill is alone. Bill asks if he knows about Quinn. Liam says yeah, the whole city of Malibu probably does. What was that ~ temporary insanity. Bill says he was completely ripped and hell no to any suggestion that he and Quinn are together. Liam grins when his dad says don't even think it, don't say it, it never happened. Brooke convinces Hope to go lie down and refresh. She is not tired as she is thinking of Ridge and his vows earlier today. Hope gets a big surprise and gives out a yelp when she discovers Wyatt hidden under the covers and peeking out at her. She jumps on top of him and gives him several kisses. He says he was hiding in the bathroom for so long that he probably smells like vanilla or pine. But he could not let her go to the most romantic city in the world alone. Katie tells Ridge that she is not sure what Hope is expecting. Ridge says Hope is expecting the man who marries her mom to be fully committed to her. They both agree that this is not what they were expecting when he came back from Paris. He says sometimes life has an amazing, wonderful way of surprising you. She repeats again that she has turned into Brooke and everything she accused her of .that is Katie now. He says no, she fought it, so did he. But now they do have to be honest with each other. That will be hard since it will affect a lot of people, but right now maybe they can make it just the two of them. She nods. He draws her closer and kisses her on the forehead."

        "Katie: Okay. Well, tell him to have fun. Thank you.",
        "Ridge: Was that Will's nanny?",
        "Katie: Yes. He is on a playdate. He's having a very good time.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: I saw you talking to Dr. Patrick when I was signing my release papers.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, he's still mystified why you would collapse like that.",
        "Katie: Well, I suppose we can't tell him that I collapsed because I was trying to stop your wedding. Another few moments and you and you and Brooke... [Sighs] How on earth did Hope figure this out? And now she and Brooke are in Paris so we can work things out.",
        "Ridge: Hope's protecting her mother. She wants to make sure that if I marry her, I'm...",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Ridge: When I first proposed to Brooke, she didn't say yes right away. Guess she wanted to make sure that this was forever.",
        "Katie: It still can be, if you decide...",
        "Ridge: If I decide what? That what's happening between us isn't happening?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, you don't think it was an omen?",
        "Brooke: I don't believe in omens. Neither do you. [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I believe in us.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Hope: Hi, Guys. What's going on?",
        "Bill: Well, if you really want to know, I was trying to convince your mother that the aborted wedding to Forrester today is a second chance for us. Don't suppose you'd like to help me out with that?",
        "Hope: [Laughing] Oh, absolutely not. Just gonna go ahead and say that's the fever talking.",
        "Bill: Fever?",
        "Hope: Uh-huh. Yeah, I was at Liam's earlier today and I heard some noises coming from upstairs. He said you weren't feeling well.",
        "Bill: Yeah, uh... well, he's right. Embarrassingly, I tied one on and I was not feeling so hot. Definitely not gonna let that happen again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look at these, Mom. The Stephanie Forrester collection, each piece more exquisite than the next. It's just... [Laughs] I mean, I-I saw a glimpse of part of it before the wedding, but when Eric asked me to get the collection appraised, I-I was blown away by the opportunity. Okay, you -- you are way too quiet about this. What is up? Something is up.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I had the most...fascinating encounter earlier... with your father.",
        "Wyatt: You were with Dad?",
        "Quinn: Well, I knew the wedding was today, and I figure he would be bummed, so... I went to see him at Liam's place.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] Let me guess -- to rub it in?",
        "Quinn: Can you blame me? I rarely, if ever, get a chance to stick it to Bill Spencer.",
        "Wyatt: Which is what made the experience so fascinating.",
        "Quinn: Well, I expected he would be sulking, but... he was in so much pain knowing Brooke was marrying Ridge and he could do nothing about it.",
        "Wyatt: Actually, about that. Um...",
        "Quinn: I've never seen him so vulnerable before, and I found myself...",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Quinn: Feeling for him. And...enjoying watching him hurting all at the same time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: All right, well, I have to go pack a few things.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Bill: Going somewhere?",
        "Hope: Oh, you didn't tell him?",
        "Bill: Tell me what?",
        "Brooke: I am going to Paris with Hope. There's a big event for Hope for the Future and it's very important to Hope that I'm with her, so...",
        "Bill: So important that you would leave your fianc\u00e9 on your almost-wedding day?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] We're going to get married the moment I get back.",
        "Bill: Is that what you believe as well?",
        "Hope: I'll be in my room.",
        "Bill: I'll come with you. Okay. Fine. But I'll be waiting for you when you get back. Because after today, I'm convinced now, more than ever, that this isn't over, Brooke. And we can't let it be.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Maybe that's what we should do.",
        "Ridge: What? Deny what we're feeling for each other? That's -- that's kind of what we have been doing. Maybe it's time that we're honest with each other... with ourselves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Does that sound sadistic?",
        "Wyatt: Loving and hating Dad at the same time? I mean...",
        "Quinn: We have an unpredictable relationship. Even more unpredictable after today.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] You know, you still haven't told me exactly what happened.",
        "Quinn: Let's just say we came to a new level of understanding.",
        "Wyatt: Mm. About what?",
        "Quinn: About why our lives are the way they are.",
        "Wyatt: Your personal lives, you mean.",
        "Quinn: Well, Bill is still mooning over Brooke, but now that she and Ridge have gotten married...",
        "Wyatt: Actually, they're not.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Wyatt: Katie collapsed during the ceremony. She's fine now, but the wedding didn't happen.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, that's me. Um... oh, Hope wants to see me. Are you gonna be okay?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Honey, I'm fine. You can go.",

        "Bill: Yes. I was completely ripped.",
        "Liam: So... like, you and Quinn are not...",
        "Bill: No! Hell no! Don't -- don't think it. Don't even say it. It's like it never happened. You got me?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. Uh...you were with Brooke?",
        "Bill: Wanted to see what happened in the aftermath of the whole wedding fiasco. So, uh... Brooke says that she is going to Paris with Hope. And without Ridge. She said it has something to do with Hope for the Future, but I think there's more to it. And so do you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: What you told Hope at the hospital -- is that how you really feel? 'Cause for you to stop the wedding, I --",
        "Katie: Maybe I shouldn't have done that. Maybe you and Brooke should be on your honeymoon right now. You're right. I don't want to be duplicitous. Maybe we should be honest with everyone.",
        "Ridge: Who you calling?",
        "Katie: I'm calling the Forrester jet. Maybe they haven't taken off yet.",
        "Ridge: We have a chance to work through our feelings. We can't do that with Brooke here. Hope knows that and you know that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Honey, do you really need me to go with you?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] I think it's what everybody needs, yeah. Everyone at Hope for the Future.",
        "Brooke: I haven't really been a part of this line.",
        "Hope: Well, not day to day, but... this really is the best thing.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Uh...",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Brooke: You get that. I'm gonna look upstairs for my passport.",
        "Hope: Okay. Hi!",
        "Wyatt: Hi. This was you, wasn't it? [As Hope] Come right over. I can't stand being away from you for one more second.",
        "Hope: This says \"Can you come to my mom's? I need to see you.\"",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I --",
        "Hope: I feel like it's reading between the lines a little bit.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I'm kind of good at that.",
        "Hope: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Mm. Mm? Please tell me that those suitcases are why I'm here. [Gasps] You're moving in!",
        "Hope: [Gasps] No, I'm not. Not yet, anyway. But, uh... that is why I want to see you. I'm going to Paris.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Wow.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: What a coincidence. So am I.",
        "Hope: You are?",
        "Wyatt: Oui, Mademoiselle. Bien s\u00fbr. [French accent] As soon as you invite me, I will go with you.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: [Normal voice] That's the best French accent you're gonna get.",

        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: Yes? Yes!",
        "Hope: [Giggles]",
        "Wyatt: You and me in Paris. It doesn't get any better than this.",
        "Hope: No, it doesn't.",
        "Wyatt: Walking along the Seine, arm in arm with my [French accent] Beautiful girlfriend. We will kiss at the top of the Eiffel Tower. [Normal voice] It's gonna be nonstop romance 24/7.",
        "Hope: Mm. Actually, it's gonna be nonstop Hope for the Future 24/7.",
        "Wyatt: No! No, no, no, no no!",
        "Hope: Yes, there's this big event over there that I'm spearheading, and as much as I would love for you to be there, any free time I have I'm gonna spend with my mom.",
        "Wyatt: Oh! So, Brooke's going, too?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah, I suggested it.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? What about Ridge?",
        "Hope: Nope, he's gonna stay here. I-I would explain that right now if I could.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Well...",
        "Brooke: Hope, I'm so happy! Oh. I found my passport.",
        "Hope: Good!",
        "Brooke: Oh, Wyatt, hi.",
        "Wyatt: Hi, Brooke. I was just coming by to wish you bon voyage, both of you. And I am going to miss you like crazy.",

        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. Actually, you didn't say no, really.",
        "Hope: I -- I mean...",
        "Wyatt: I'm just saying. You didn't say no, that I couldn't come.",
        "Hope: [Giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Welcome aboard, Ladies. Is there anything I can get you before takeoff?",
        "Hope: No, we're fine, Kyle. Thank you.",
        "Kyle: All right.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Mom, you okay?",
        "Brooke: This was supposed to be my wedding night with Ridge. I know Katie couldn't really help it. It's just... it seems as if...",
        "Hope: As if what?",
        "Brooke: I'm just happy that Ridge can be with her. She's as special to him as she is to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I guess I'm just not sure what Hope is expecting.",
        "Ridge: Well, she's expecting the man who marries her mother to be completely committed to her.",
        "Katie: You've always loved Brooke.",
        "Ridge: I can't deny this.",
        "Katie: I'm sure this is not what you were expecting when you came back from Paris.",
        "Ridge: I'm sure it's not what you were expecting, either. But sometimes life has a way of surprising us. Amazing, wonderful way of surprising us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Honey, you should get some sleep.",
        "Hope: I just -- I need to make sure that this report is done. [Sighs] And it is. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Why don't you go back there and lay down?",
        "Hope: Are you sure you don't want to? You must be exhausted.",
        "Brooke: No, I'm fine.",
        "Hope: Yeah?",
        "Brooke: I just miss Ridge. I keep thinking about him. And those vows were beautiful. I know we're not officially married, but... in my heart, we are. Not that I'm not thrilled to be going to Paris with you.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] I'm sorry. I know the timing is not the greatest, but... Ridge understands.",
        "Brooke: It's not Ridge I'm worried about. It's Katie.",
        "Hope: Uh, why? What do you mean?",
        "Brooke: She's probably at home right now, fretting about what happened, which is crazy after everything I've done to her.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Mom, you have to stop beating yourself up about that. Just... you know, keep reminding yourself that Aunt Katie isn't perfect, either.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: All right, uh... I'm gonna go lay down. Will you wake me up when we get close to Paris?",
        "Brooke: Of course. Sleep tight.",
        "Hope: Good night. [Screams]",
        "Wyatt: Bonjour, Mademoiselle. C'est moi.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God! Wyatt, what are you doing here?",
        "Wyatt: Well, technically, you didn't say, \"No, don't come.\" You said this trip was gonna be all about business. Believe me, I intend to contribute.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God.",
        "Wyatt: I have been waiting in that bathroom for so long, I smell like vanilla or pine or whatever it is.",
        "Hope: I'm so glad you're here!",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Mm. I just -- I couldn't let you go to the most romantic city in the world alone.",
        "Hope: Aww.",
        "Wyatt: Aww.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I know you said you weren't hungry, but I thought, you know... what is that?",
        "Katie: It's a picture of my sisters and me when we were kids. Sometimes, I can't believe that my life has turned out the way it has. I think of who I was then and who I am now and...",
        "Ridge: Well, who you are now is a dedicated mother and a respected C.E.O.",
        "Katie: I'm also someone who faked being ill so I could stop my sister's wedding.",
        "Ridge: Don't do that.",
        "Katie: What? What? Everything that I've accused her of, that's me now.",
        "Ridge: No, it's not.",
        "Katie: How can you say that?",
        "Ridge: Because you fought how you felt. I fought it. We've got to start being honest with each other. And I know it's hard because it's gonna affect a lot of people, but right now, right this moment, maybe we can just make it about us -- just you and me, okay?"
