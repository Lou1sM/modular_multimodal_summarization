        "Bill and Katie enjoy their Aspen honeymoon. She likes it where it is cold and wants to stay in bed all day. But she has a wedding surprise for him, something she took a risk on. He opens a new sword necklace. She says she knows the old necklace is who he is, but that is the past and this is the future. He is still powerful and better than before. So she is not asking him to forget his past but embrace his future. They kiss. In the office, Brooke and Eric drink to the success of their son and laugh over how he got his brilliance. Brooke in fact has several refills and Eric quips that he never tires of her giggle. Deacon is down on the floor with no clothes on and comes up for air as he is out of breath. He has a whisk in his hand. He is not sure he wants to leave but tells Quinn they need something to eat so they both settle on chicken and salad from takeout and she playfully smacks his behind before he leaves. Brooke tries to pour Eric another drink but he says he is busy and can not even go out for lunch. She should go alone but do not drive. She assures him she will take a car and thanks him for caring. She says now that Rick is stabilizing everything will be all right. There is a knock at Quinn's door and she gleefully opens it to find Wyatt and invites him in. He says only when she puts that wielding knife away. She is shocked that he is caring about her. He says it might be for Deacon instead. She says he doesn't have to worry as Deacon treats her well. She was depressed when Wyatt lost his baby but Deacon was there for her all the way. Wyatt wants her to be happy but he is not as sure as she is that Deacon can deliver on that. She asks about Bill's wedding and Wyatt tells her it went well although Brooke got a little tipsy. She wants to hear all about that.",
        "At the outdoor restaurant Deacon asks about his takeout. Then he spots Brooke and walks over. She tells him she is celebrating and insists that she is not alone now so sit down. She tries to get him a drink but he says he is only here long enough to get his takeout and needs to get back with Quinn. Brooke keeps insisting and he realizes she has had many drinks already so pays for both of their tabs and tells her she can not drive and he is taking her home. She makes a scene in leaving and he ends up apologizing to everyone in her path. Deacon is at odds getting Brooke into her house. She doesn't want to sit; she wants to dance. She calls Deacon young and sexy. When she has another drink but Deacon doesn't, she bounds toward the stairs and says she will sober up like he says upstairs and he can help. Deacon looks at Brooke's photos on the mantle and thinks back to when they slept together and Hope was born. Brooke comes down in a bathing suit and has one in hand for Deacon. She says they can swim then have that drink. Remember when they used to have fun? He says yes but he is committed to Quinn now. Brooke says that has nothing to do with anything and pours herself a drink. Deacon grabs her and kisses her, shocking them both."

        "Katie: It's not silly. It's a symbol of your power, of your strength.",
        "Bill: It's a symbol of who I am. I've never taken it off. It has been with me throughout my entire adult life, everything that I've been through, good or bad. And for the record, its origin is not in any way significant to me. Everything I've done in my life since putting it on is.",
        "Katie: I know you've faced many obstacles in your life. I'm not naive to that. And I know that you've had to fight for everything you have. And the fight isn't over, because that's just life. But this... this is where you've been. This is your past. This...",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: This is where you're going. It's your future. For the first time ever, the Spencer family is united. We are a single unit. You, your sons... and your wife. Doesn't that deserve something new? This may not have the same significance. Not yet. But it will. It will because it represents who you are now -- still powerful, still resolute and unyielding. But better and stronger than ever before. I'm not asking you to forget your past. But I do want you to embrace your future. Give it a chance.",

        "Wyatt: Craziness, yes.",
        "Quinn: No worries. Deacon treats me the way I want to be treated. So, how was your dad's wedding?",

        "Quinn: Yeah? No drama?",
        "Wyatt: Not really.",

        "Wyatt: No. No, but she just got a little tipsy.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. Deacon said she's been hitting the bottle. Wonder what that's all about.",

        "Brooke: Rumors, schmumors.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Okay? Rumors come and rumors go. And then rumors come again, and then they just...go away forever. I should know. Hmm. You know, I really hate drinking alone. You need a drink.",
        "Deacon: No, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Sweetie! Hi! Could you please bring a drink over for my friend?",
        "Deacon: I'm good, thank you.",

        "Deacon: No, I just came in for some takeout. Quinn's at home. She's -- she's hungry.",

        "Deacon: Listen, did you drive over here?",
        "Brooke: No! I was driven.",
        "Deacon: Look, I'm not trying to be your parent here. I just maybe --",
        "Woman: Your order, Mr. Sharpe.",
        "Deacon: Thank you. Um, listen, uh, I think this will probably take care of her tab, too, okay?",
        "Woman: Great. Thank you.",
        "Deacon: Just keep that. Okay, we're leaving. Come on.",

        "Katie: Perfect conditions out there.",
        "Bill: Yeah, incredible. We got fresh powder today.",
        "Katie: When we were kids, my mom used to work extra hours during the holidays so that we could have a day at Big Bear. I can remember how much fun it was to race my sisters and Storm down the hill. Of course, Brooke always won, generally. I'll never forget how exhilarating it felt to go faster and faster and faster and faster just trying to catch up.",
        "Bill: Did you ever win?",
        "Katie: Once. But I think she might have let me. I'm worried about her.",
        "Bill: Why? You think there's a problem?",
        "Katie: She just seems sad. I hope she's not making any bad choices because she's lonely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I'm touched you have such concern for my love life.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, let's not get all melodramatic, okay? Maybe I'm just trying to protect my vast inheritance.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Wyatt, I've turned you into such a cynic.",
        "Wyatt: With all due respect, I kind of credit dad for a lot of that.",
        "Quinn: You don't have to worry about me.",
        "Wyatt: Because you're in such good hands with Deacon?",
        "Quinn: Deacon is a gentleman.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, please. If he was a gentleman, you'd have zero interest in him.",
        "Quinn: He saved my life.",
        "Wyatt: From what? Respectability?",
        "Quinn: When you lost your child... I was depressed. I was severely depressed, and, um, he was there for me. And he has been ever since. I trust Deacon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: All right, come on.",
        "Brooke: Ooh!",
        "Deacon: Easy.",
        "Brooke: Most drivers stay in the car.",
        "Deacon: You're fine. We're gonna get you right over to the couch.",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Deacon: Come on, come on, come on.",
        "Brooke: I don't need to sit, okay? I just need to dance! [Laughs] You gonna join me?",
        "Deacon: I think you've had a little head start.",
        "Brooke: That can be rectified.",
        "Deacon: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You are done!",
        "Brooke: Oh, come on!",
        "Deacon: Come on. No.",
        "Brooke: The party just began.",
        "Deacon: No, you need to lay down and take a nap. Come on.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Okay. But first, a nightcap.",
        "Deacon: You need to sober up. I need to go back to Quinn.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Okay.",
        "Deacon: All right?",
        "Brooke: Okay. I'm gonna go up here to... sober up!",
        "Deacon: Where -- where you going?",
        "Brooke: I am going upstairs to sober up. And you're gonna help me.",
        "Deacon: I --",
        "Brooke: Oh! [Laughs]",
        "Deacon: Careful.",
        "Brooke: I'm good.",
        "Deacon: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: I'm good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: All right, everything's ready... thought just left my head. I-I forgot what I was gonna say.",
        "Katie: Am I gonna need a coat?",
        "Bill: Only if you're worried about getting frostbite in some uncomfortable places.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Bill: Yeah, who needs the snow?",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] It's warm in here.",
        "Bill: I love you. I love your fight, your determination. I am so grateful that we found our way back to each other, Katie. My Katie.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: I love you. And we will be together forever.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I'm thinking about starting a company with Deacon.",
        "Wyatt: How about starting a life with yourself?",
        "Quinn: I am. And Deacon is a part of it.",
        "Wyatt: Look, don't get me wrong. I want you to be happy, Mom. But I don't think Deacon's gonna deliver that.",
        "Quinn: He has so far.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, if you're gonna depend on a man to bring you happiness, you're gonna be sorely disappointed.",
        "Quinn: Who are you talking to?! Look, just because things didn't work out with you and Hope --",
        "Wyatt: Hey, this has nothing to do with me and Hope. Just please, I-I just want you to keep an eye open, that's all.",
        "Quinn: He won't betray me. If he does --",
        "Wyatt: See? That's what I'm talking about. \"If he does.\" If he does, he's probably gonna end up waking up some morning with a key part of his body missing, and I don't want you going down that path!",
        "Quinn: I won't have to. Deacon won't disappoint me.",

        "Deacon: What?",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Yes! Then we can have drinks! Happy hour, you know?",
        "Deacon: Happy hour?",
        "Brooke: We used to have fun swimming, Deacon. Don't you remember?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I remember.",
        "Brooke: What is the matter with you?",
        "Deacon: Brooke, I-I can't be your drinking buddy, and I sure as Hell can't go swimming with you.",
        "Brooke: Why not?",
        "Deacon: Because I'm committed to Quinn.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God. What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Deacon: You just don't get it, do you?",
        "Brooke: No. No. I don't get it. You know, but what -- what I do get is another little drinkie.",
