        "Bridget: There's nowhere to go from here.",
        "Nick: There is, we'll move forward together.",
        "Bridget: Oh Nick, we've already tried that. We keep putting these phantoms in front of us -- a child that couldn't be born -- a child that we couldn't have -- we keep reaching for them, when we're really reaching for a life with each other --",
        "Nick: We can have children of our own.",
        "Bridget: Marriage is supposed to make us a family.",
        "Nick: And it has -- it will.",
        "Bridget: No, nick. We keep wanting a family to make us a marriage. When we both know the truth is, we have never had the right marriage to make us a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Ridge -- put that away. She doesn't want you.",
        "Ridge: If you would let her answer maybe I'd find out!",
        "Stephanie: Not with Bridget and Nick marriage unraveling -- not if she can get him fair and square.",
        "Brooke: Nothing is unraveling except your sick mind!",
        "Stephanie: Their marriage is not going to hold together without that baby. Without some child.",
        "Ridge: You can prove her wrong, by saying yes to me right now. And to hell with Nick. Logan, I was a fool to walk away from the best life has to offer. And all I can think of night and day is getting it back. Is that what you want as well? Tell me. Tell me that you will marry me.",
        "Brooke: I have a few conditions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Let's -- let's step back here. Because we're disagreeing about a very specific question. Let's not make this about what we are to each other.",
        "Bridget: But it is.",
        "Nick: Bridget, I can not raise a child that is going to be taken from me. And you know that that is inevitable.",
        "Bridget: We made a promise.",
        "Nick: But we didn't promise this.",
        "Bridget: I knew what I was promising. I never thought that Dominick was mine. But for you, I can see obviously that doesn't really matter. I know that you love me. But I also know it's not the real reason you married me or the reason you came back.",
        "Nick: Are you unhappy? Do I make you unhappy?",
        "Bridget: No. Like you said, it's just reality.",
        "Nick: Which part?",
        "Bridget: This whole not looking at what's right in front of us. We keep our eyes on the future and it's a future we're never getting closer to. Other people see it, Nick. Dante told me the real reason that I came over tonight was not to discuss Dominick but to --",
        "Nick: What? To try to save my marriage. He was right. I don't think I can.",
        "Nick: So what is this been about for the last six months? All the talking and listening and the apologies and the promises.",
        "Bridget: This is different nick. This isn't about you being in love with my mother. There it is. That's what this really does come down to, doesn't it? Look at me now -- I'm not losing control -- I think I'm actually taking it back.",
        "Nick: You have taken it back -- you've done this. And we have a good marriage, Bridget. And you certainly can't say that for anyone else in your family.",
        "Bridget: Well I think it's a little easier for us.",
        "Nick: How is it easier?",
        "Bridget: Because I think we're both professionals at having our heart broken. And from one professional to another, Nick -- your heart isn't in this.",
        "Nick: How can you say that?",
        "Bridget: Because your heart is somewhere else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Number one, I am not leaving this house.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Number two?",
        "Brooke: Number two, I want the extended family to feel comfortable here. And welcome at all times",
        "Ridge: Present company excluded?",
        "Brooke: I'm getting to that. Brothers, sisters, parents, ex-spouses and their children, my children --",
        "Ridge: Check.",
        "Brooke: And their spouses. And that includes Nick.",
        "Ridge: With you married to me, I have no issue with Nick.",
        "Brooke: That is not true. You two never got along.",
        "Ridge: Okay -- I think he'd be more comfortable if we kept it that way.",
        "Brooke: No, Ridge. Nick is your brother. You treat him like one.",
        "Ridge: Okay. What else --",
        "Brooke: Number three. Stephanie is your mother. So you'll have to give her all the love and the attention and the respect that she is due. Which will really be very little, because you have to give me all the love and the respect and attention that you owe me first. And if she disagrees with me, you stand by my side. And she has no say so in our marriage, in how we raise our children, and no influence over you what so ever.",
        "Ridge: How am I doing so far today?",
        "Brooke: Really good otherwise we wouldn't have gotten this far.",
        "Ridge: All conditions accepted.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Well then, I am proud to be Mrs. Ridge Forrester. That is so beautiful. That is so beautiful.",
        "Ridge: Just like you my dear. Just like you.",
        "Ridge: Let's set a date. How about the day after today?",
        "Brooke: What -- you can't be serious?",
        "Ridge: I'm very serious. We've done the big grandiose horses-and-acrobats wedding, and we should never left that be undone. Logan, I want to correct that mistake and I want to be married to you, and I want to do it before we have a chance for anything to go wrong.",
        "Brooke: Okay, well then yes -- tomorrow, the day after today.",
        "Ridge: Well I suppose congratulations is too much to expect, huh?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, am I permitted to speak? You're a bigger idiot than Eric was. At least he never expected a happily-ever-after. He was going to be happy and satisfied with just a few quickies --",
        "Ridge: All right -- that's it. You're out of here!",
        "Stephanie: You bet I am! This is me leaving the asylum because there's nothing here but insane people.",
        "Ridge: Out!",
        "Brooke: She's going to cause trouble.",
        "Ridge: You think between today and tomorrow she is?",
        "Brooke: She's going straight to Nick and Bridget.",
        "Ridge: Are they going to be happy for us?",
        "Brooke: Bridget will.",
        "Ridge: And Nick?",
        "Brooke: Nick -- Nick? No, I'm going to have to have the same talk with him that I had with you. There's no reason for you two to be antagonistic to each other.",
        "Ridge: Well, maybe one? Logan, the site on that woman's face when she realized her worst nightmare -- she got everything she deserved. But if there's anything that you just said, that you want to take back, tell me now. You and I have always avoided a lot of questions by just jumping into bed with each other. Not that I'm complaining -- I just want to know.",
        "Brooke: Just let me show you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Bridget, I have never been unfaithful to you. Brooke and I will never be together.",
        "Bridget: Maybe you should be.",
        "Nick: I love you. I love us. You are home to me. Don't throw that away.",
        "Bridget: No man will ever, ever be what you are to me. I know how hard it is for you to have me know that you love my mother. I know it's like some secret shame, you feel you need to hide. And I don't want that. You don't want that. So just let it go. Let me go. We both know that this has got to happen.",
        "Nick: Why do I feel that the best thing that ever happened to me is turning its back and walking away?",
        "Bridget: Because it's the hardest thing I've ever asked you to do. I don't know that we need to talk about this anymore. I think maybe you should go spend the night on the Marlin.",
        "Nick: I don't want to leave you.",
        "Bridget: It's okay, I'll be fine. I'm not alone, I've got Dominick. Maybe you need some time to decide if what I'm saying is really so wrong.",
        "Nick: Maybe things will look different to you in the morning too. Bridget, it's not true that we were only together because of the child.",
        "Bridget: Please remember, I'm always going to love you. Are you hungry? MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM",
        "Brooke: I think of him as my heart. You can't see it, you can't hear it, but it's there. It's the center of your universe. It's everything. There isn't anything that I said tonight or any other time that I would take back. I don't regret loving you for one minute, no matter how young and crazy we were or how awful and angry we got. Looking at you, is like, looking back on my life all the good, all the bad, and loving it all.",
        "Bridget: Hey Stephanie, I'd ask you in but Dominick just fell back asleep and I swill be soon too.",
        "Stephanie: I didn't see Nick's car outside. Oh, it's already happened?",
        "Bridget: No, nothing's happened, he's just not here.",
        "Stephanie: I'm sorry.",
        "Bridget: Condolences aren't necessary.",
        "Stephanie: I was thinking of Dominick.",
        "Bridget: Oh well, who his father is, doesn't change the way I feel about him at all.",
        "Stephanie: I knew you would feel that way. And I knew that Nick would not.",
        "Bridget: Then I don't know why you needed to come all the way down here, you can stay home and still know everything about our lives.",
        "Stephanie: Your mother and Ridge are getting married tomorrow.",
        "Bridget: Well, I'm happy for them, if that's what they want.",
        "Stephanie: You know damn well it's not what your mother wants.",
        "Bridget: I know damn well that makes you want to blow something up, and the first thing you usually think of is me.",
        "Stephanie: You think this whole thing this evening is some sort of coincidence? Look -- your mother knows that without a child, this marriage of yours is going to fall apart.",
        "Bridget: Thank you, I'll keep that in mind.",
        "Stephanie: I didn't say that to hurt you. I can see by your face, that's already been accomplished. Listen honey -- you're two nice people that are wrong for each other, no one has to apologize for that. The question is, do you love him enough to let him go and be happy? You don't have a lot of time to decide. Your mother knows that this marriage of yours with Nick is falling apart and she's using Ridge, to close the door to him, just the way she did with your father. So you have to ask yourself, is this what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: We should be celebrating, you know.",
        "Brooke: Where would you like to go?",
        "Ridge: Nowhere.",
        "Brooke: What would you like to do?",
        "Ridge: Get down on my knees and thank you for taking me back. I got scared, Logan.",
        "Brooke: Of what?",
        "Ridge: The possibility that I had screwed it all up. That I'd realized what a fool I was, that I'd given up everything to have a second chance with you. But you couldn't love me anymore because that part of your life that I occupied was already filled.",
        "Brooke: Nobody else is a father to my son. Nobody else could rip my clothes off and sew them back together. Nobody else knows the worst about me and can only remembered the best. Of course, I love you. I loved you for so long, I can't even remember how not to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: You going to have to have somebody else do your dirty work for you, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: There's no one else who can.",
        "Bridget: Do you have any idea how outrageous you are?",
        "Stephanie: I'm willing to bet that not even you want to see your mother and Nick go through this silly routine of sacrificing and denial and not being available to one another. It makes everyone who loves them miserable.",
        "Bridget: My mother is her own woman. What can I do about it?",
        "Stephanie: What are you willing to do? Your mother looks upon Nick as her gift to you. Why aren't you giving back?"
