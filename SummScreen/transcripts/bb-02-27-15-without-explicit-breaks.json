    "Recap": [
        "Quinn tells Wyatt that he doesn't know Deacon like she does but she likes this. Maybe this is the first sign that Wyatt is leaning toward her again and being protective. Wyatt says Deacon and Brooke share a daughter together and a whole lot more than that. He does not want her going to that dark place again. She says she won't but admits Deacon has been gone way past time that he should have gotten food and been back home. Quinn fires back that she shares a son with Bill and they are not close now. Wyatt says the point is Brooke can not be without a man. Quinn says okay but it won't be her man. Deacon can not get from Brooke what he gets with Quinn and do not ask what that is. Katie and Bill enjoy their honeymoon and he says he could care less what Quinn thinks or does and he will wear Katie's new necklace. Katie doesn't care either as long as Deacon stays away from her sister. While Bill is out she attempts to call Brooke but he catches her and just says she is still worried abut her drinking pretty hard at the wedding. Deacon tells Brooke he doesn't know what he is doing. He is going to get the hell out of here. Brooke says he is living with a nutcase and is a little frustrated. It is not the time to go but time to party out by the pool and the drinks are on her. He asks if she really doesn't care at all what might happen. She pours the drinks and he says he is going to spell it out for her since she does not seem to get it. He can not be her drinking buddy now. He is with Quinn. She is sick of hearing all about Quinn, but whatever. She tells him to quit wearing his heart on his sleeve. He is no fun that way. He realizes she does not get how he really feels about her so he leaves. Brooke continues drinking.",
        "Wyatt tells Quinn that he is out of here. If she wants to be with Deacon, then have at him, it's not his problem. As he is leaving Deacon comes in and apologizes for being sidetracked. He says he ran into Brooke at the restaurant. Deacon tells her about Brooke and said she was pretty messed up and he could not leave her there so he took her home. Wyatt says he is sure he did not leave her on the doorstep. Did he take her to bed? Deacon is appalled and says again he is sorry he was late. Nothing happened. They did not even go swimming like Brooke wanted but he had to stay to make sure she was okay. Deacon puts the food in microwave to revive it and Quinn slips out. Wyatt tells him one guess where she went. He comments he is not his mother's keeper so he could not stop her. Deacon says he cares about her. Wyatt wonders if that means as much as he does Brooke. He says he knows Deacon's history with Brooke and he felt they would always get back together and wonders just what happened over there tonight. Brooke calls Donna but had forgotten she was taking care of Will. She wanted to go dancing and have some fun like they used to. Instead she goes back to the bottle. Brooke's doorbell rings and it is Quinn. Brooke opens the door with a drink in her hand. Brooke tells Quinn she looks like she could use a drink. Quinn quips that it looks like Brooke has had more than enough for the two of them. She is drunk and Deacon has had it with her. Brooke tells her to leave but Quinn slaps her and commands her to stay away from Deacon. Brooke falls to the door with Quinn leaving her there."

        "Brooke: Maybe you do need a dip in the pool.",
        "Deacon: I-I didn't mean to do that. I --",
        "Brooke: Oh, shut up. Of course you --",
        "Wyatt: You, the one who never trusted hope or Liam or dad, somehow trusts Deacon now?",
        "Quinn: Deacon stood by me in my darkest hour.",
        "Wyatt: Deacon's a master manipulator.",
        "Quinn: You don't know him the way I do.",
        "Wyatt: Thank God for that.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, I appreciate your concern.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: I really do. I mean, it's -- it's the first sign that maybe, just maybe, that you're starting to forgive me, and I have been living for that.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, well, then trust me this once! Believe me when I tell you -- Deacon Sharpe will lead you into darkness. And you've been there before, mom. You know that place, and I don't want you going back there again.",
        "Quinn: I won't!",
        "Wyatt: What about Brooke?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] What about Brooke?",
        "Wyatt: She and Deacon share a daughter together. And a whole lot more than that.",
        "[Owl hooting]",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] So...",
        "Bill: Hmm?",
        "Katie: Do you wish that you were sailing around the Mediterranean right now?",
        "Bill: It could happen, you know.",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: Yeah, best of both worlds -- start the honeymoon in aspen, end it in the south of France.",
        "Katie: Hmm. That sounds very tempting.",
        "Bill: Say the word.",
        "Katie: I don't think so.",
        "Bill: No?",
        "Katie: Looks good on you.",
        "Bill: Take a little getting used to. But thank you.",
        "Katie: Not only does it represent our future. It's one more connection to Quinn that we can get rid of.",
        "Bill: Another one of your improvements?",
        "Katie: It's not hard to improve upon Quinn.",
        "Bill: Feeling a little feisty, aren't you?",
        "Katie: Hmm, I am. After all, I'm married to the number-one badass in the world. Come on. Well... I'm glad you're giving this a chance. I know you weren't a fan of Liam switching out his necklace. I'm sure Quinn hated it.",
        "Bill: Oh, I don't give a damn how Quinn feels. And regardless, she has a new project.",
        "Katie: Has she?",
        "Bill: Deacon.",
        "Katie: Well, just as long as he stays away from my sister.",
        "Quinn: I've spoken to Deacon about Brooke. He's reassured me.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, and he's as credible as the weatherman, right?",
        "Quinn: I believe in him.",
        "Wyatt: You don't need him, mom!",
        "Quinn: I don't need anyone! But I do need you to respect my choices.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Don't even get me started on your choices, okay?",
        "Quinn: I think Deacon is one of my good ones!",
        "Wyatt: Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now, but Brooke, at one time, was the love of his life.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I know. They made a pretty, little messed up daughter together.",
        "Wyatt: Careful, Mom.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Where is he, anyway?",
        "Wyatt: I thought you said that he was going out for food.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, he went to Il Giardino, but he should be back by now.",
        "Deacon: W-what the hell am I doing?",
        "Brooke: [Giggles] Relax! It's not the first time you ever kissed me.",
        "Deacon: Quinn's food's getting cold.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. You, on the other hand...",
        "Deacon: Brooke, I'm getting the hell out of here.",
        "Brooke: [Giggles] Wait! Wait! You got to cool down! It's time for a swim!",
        "Deacon: Do you see what's going on here?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I see what's going on! You are a little frustrated. That's because you're living with a nutcase!",
        "Deacon: Okay, this is not funny.",
        "Brooke: I know this isn't funny. This is hysterical...",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Brooke: ...Because you are acting like a little schoolboy who's late for supper!",
        "Deacon: She's texting me. She wants to know where I am.",
        "Brooke: Okay, okay. Just tell her to crank up the microwave and you'll be home soon. But right now, it's time to party! Co",
        "Bill: All right, look what I've got h-- hey, hey, hey! Didn't we make a deal? No phones on, all right?",
        "Katie: I know, I know! I'm just -- I'm just checking in with a few people. That's it.",
        "Bill: Yeah?",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "Bill: Well, how is she?",
        "Katie: Who?",
        "Bill: Brooke. I know you're worried about her.",
        "Katie: She just wasn't herself at the wedding. I mean, I could tell she was trying to put on a happy face, but...",
        "Bill: You think it was all a show.",
        "Katie: I know my sister very well. And I know she's going through a lot right now. And she doesn't do well when she's all alone. She talked to me, you know. I mean, she said really sweet, supportive things, so it wasn't that. It was just I could feel this sadness coming from her.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] She's gonna be fine. It was a wedding. She had a few drinks.",
        "Katie: I know, and I'm -- I'm not saying that she doesn't have a right to cut loose and have a good time.",
        "Bill: Look, Brooke Logan is never going to be a hermit.",
        "Katie: I just hope that she's hanging out with the right people.",
        "Wyatt: Nothing from Deacon?",
        "Quinn: He's probably driving home.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Quinn: So, she was at the wedding?",
        "Wyatt: Who?",
        "Quinn: Brooke.",
        "Wyatt: So, she's still on your mind, huh? That's good. She should be.",
        "Quinn: And she was drinking?",
        "Wyatt: Yep. Hitting it pretty hard.",
        "Quinn: Was she with Ridge?",
        "Wyatt: Nope. He's with Caroline now.",
        "Quinn: She's no Brooke.",
        "Wyatt: Ridge isn't interested in Brooke.",
        "Quinn: Baloney. Ridge is always interested in Brooke.",
        "Wyatt: Not romantically. Which makes her very available.",
        "Quinn: Are you trying to make me insecure?",
        "Wyatt: I'm just saying. Brooke and Deacon share a history. They share a daughter together.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, your father and I share a son together, and it doesn't mean that he's giving me a passing thought.",
        "Wyatt: It's different for a woman. Before you had Deacon in your life, you gave dad more than a passing thought, remember?",
        "Quinn: And you think Brooke is doing the same thing with Deacon?",
        "Wyatt: Maybe. Especially now that she's alone. And look, I'm not trying to upset you here. I just -- I know the woman. I was married to her daughter, remember?",
        "Quinn: You still are.",
        "Wyatt: Whatever! The point is, Brooke is always with a man.",
        "Quinn: Well, she can't have my man.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. But that's not completely your decision.",
        "Quinn: Deacon is not going to choose Brooke over me. I'm not concerned about that.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Quinn: Deacon can't get from Brooke what he gets from me. And it behooves you not to ask what that is.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, please. Nothing for me, all right?",
        "Brooke: \"Nothing\" is so negative.",
        "Deacon: I can't be partying with you.",
        "Brooke: Scotch on the rocks. Why not? What's wrong? Look, let's take these drinks and go get in the pool.",
        "Deacon: Come on. You're not that drunk.",
        "Brooke: Drunk? I don't get drunk, Deacon. I get happy and then I get a little happier, you know?",
        "Deacon: Do you remember what happened before you took off for Italy?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I think you asked me to marry you.",
        "Deacon: I wanted a future. I wanted... I wanted to build a life with you. And you, I mean, who the hell knows what you wanted? It certainly wasn't me. And then you took off for Milan.",
        "Brooke: Do you want a little water in your scotch?",
        "Deacon: Do you really not care at all?",
        "Brooke: Oh, God, Deacon! Please lighten up! It's a party!",
        "Deacon: Why the hell would I think you did? I mean, you made it pretty clear that you were moving on when you went to Europe.",
        "Brooke: Oh, well, good. That's resolved. So, here. Cheers.",
        "Deacon: Listen, I'm -- I'm gonna spell this out for you, 'cause you're not getting it, all right? I can't -- I can't be your drinking buddy, all right? I can't -- I can't be your pal. I'm with Quinn now.",
        "Brooke: Quinn, Quinn, Quinn, Quinn, Quinn! Will you stop saying her name?",
        "Deacon: I'm putting --",
        "Brooke: Here, this is really good scotch. Ridge loves this scotch. Oops. My bad. [Chuckles]",
        "Deacon: Look, I'm putting something together with her. At least I'm doing my version of trying.",
        "Brooke: Well, she is crazy. But whatever.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, well, I think we're all a little crazy, don't you?",
        "Brooke: Deacon, stop wearing your heart on your sleeve. Really, you're no fun that way.",
        "Deacon: I-I can't do this. Not again.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Do what? Have a drink with an old friend?",
        "Deacon: Is that how you think I see you?",
        "Brooke: What you see is what you get. [Giggles] Pfft.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Brooke: [Coughing] [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Hope he didn't get into an accident.",
        "Wyatt: Wouldn't be worse than what I'm thinking.",
        "Quinn: Will you stop being such a cynic?",
        "Wyatt: You know what? You're right. You want to be with the guy? Fine. Have at it. It's not my problem. I'm out of here.",
        "Deacon: Hey, baby.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Deacon: I'm sorry I'm late. What's up, Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: Hey, Deacon.",
        "Quinn: Where have you been? I was worried.",
        "Deacon: I...got sidetracked. Uh... hey, listen, there's plenty if you want. I'm gonna throw it in the oven here.",
        "Wyatt: No, thanks.",
        "Quinn: Sidetracked?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I ran into somebody at the restaurant.",
        "Quinn: Who?",
        "Deacon: Brooke.",
        "Bill: Mnh, mnh, mnh, mnh, mnh! You've got to stop doing that, all right? I'm the one that's supposed to be attached to my cell phone.",
        "Katie: All right, all right. Sorry. Sorry. I -- [Sighs] She wouldn't want me worrying about her, anyway, so...",
        "Bill: Brooke is having a great time partying with donna and will. I'm telling you. I just hope she's having as much fun as we are.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "Brooke: Oh! [Chuckles] Yeah. Shoot, I forgot. I forgot you're taking care of will. No, I just -- I thought it might be fun, you know, to go out and go dancing like we used to. Remember? Yeah. Yeah, no, I-I know. I just... I forgot. Anyway, it's okay. Just give will a kiss for me, and I'll see you soon. I love you, donna. I love you so much. Um...yeah. Yeah. I'll talk to you. Okay. Bye.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: All this time, you were with Brooke at the restaurant?",
        "Deacon: Um, no, she was pretty buzzed.",
        "Quinn: Drinking again?",
        "Wyatt: By herself?",
        "Deacon: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: So then you sat down?",
        "Deacon: No, I mean, it wasn't like that. She was pretty messed up. I had to get her out of there.",
        "Quinn: She cause a scene?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, something like that.",
        "Quinn: I hope she didn't embarrass you.",
        "Deacon: I kept my cool.",
        "Quinn: Good for you.",
        "Wyatt: So, then what happened?",
        "Deacon: I had to get her out of there.",
        "Quinn: Hope she didn't puke in the cab.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] She didn't take a cab, I mean, not in her condition.",
        "Wyatt: So, then what did you do?",
        "Deacon: I took her home.",
        "Quinn: You drove Brooke all the way back to her place?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. Right. That's what I did. Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: And I presume you didn't just leave her on the doorstep.",
        "Deacon: Of course not.",
        "Wyatt: You took her inside?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, she needed to sober up.",
        "Wyatt: You tuck her into bed?",
        "Deacon: What the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "Wyatt: I'm just saying. You had to do something with her.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, she -- she had to sober up.",
        "Wyatt: So then you made her a nice, big pot of strong coffee, then, right?",
        "Deacon: You know what? I think maybe it's time that you leave.",
        "Wyatt: What?! I'm just asking!",
        "Quinn: So, what did you do?",
        "Deacon: She -- she wanted to go swimming, which obviously we didn't.",
        "Quinn: What did you do?",
        "Deacon: What did I do? I tried to talk her down.",
        "Wyatt: From what?",
        "Deacon: From the state that she was in. I mean, you know, she wanted to party, she's traipsing around in that swimsuit. Look",
        "Deacon: [Sniffs] Smells like dinner's almost ready. Uh, where's your mom?",
        "Wyatt: Out.",
        "Deacon: Where?",
        "Wyatt: Where do you think, Deacon?",
        "Katie: She's always taken care of me. I just want her to be as happy as I am.",
        "Bill: Like I said, she's hanging out with donna and will.",
        "Katie: I miss our boy. Well, if anyone can cheer someone up, it's him. I just hope she's not alone. Bad things happen when Brooke's by herself.",
        "Wyatt: You called, you texted. She's not gonna answer, Deacon.",
        "Deacon: Why the hell did you let her go?",
        "Wyatt: I'm not my mother's keeper!",
        "Deacon: Not, but I think there's a little part of you that wants -- you want her to go over there and get into it with Brooke, don't you?",
        "Wyatt: No, I want her to get out of it with you.",
        "Deacon: Look, Wyatt, I'm the best thing that's ever happened to your mother.",
        "Wyatt: And that about sums up her life.",
        "Deacon: I care about her.",
        "Wyatt: As much as you care about Brooke?",
        "Deacon: Used to.",
        "Wyatt: What happened over there, really?",
        "Deacon: I told you! She was buzzed. I-I tried to sober her up.",
        "Wyatt: And how'd you do that? You didn't make her any coffee. You didn't go swimming. But something else happened, didn't it? Look... I know your history with Brooke. Hope always felt that you two would eventually get back together. She said you'd always be vulnerable to Brooke. What happened over there tonight?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Coming! [Slurring] You look like you could use a drink.",
        "Quinn: You look like you've had enough for both of us.",
        "Brooke: What do you want? Hey, lady, come on. It's not open house night.",
        "Quinn: Drinking alone, Brooke?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, I am. And I intend to keep it that way. Go!",
        "Quinn: But you haven't been alone all night. Two glasses. And in your bathing suit?",
        "Brooke: I can't wait for summer.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Don't play dumb with me. You are drunk and you're pathetic, and he wants nothing to do with you.",
        "Brooke: \"He\" who? Ridge? Bill? Eric?",
        "Quinn: I'm sure all of them. But you know damn well who I'm talking about.",
        "Brooke: I think you better leave. Oh!",
        "Quinn: You stay away from him! You stay away from Deacon. Do you hear me?",
        "Brooke: [Exhales sharply]"
