        "Liam scoffs. He knows Quinn is a package deal with Eric. And Eric is going to be at their wedding but he cannot see Quinn there .in the same room breathing the same air as Ridge. He calls Bill to warn him the families are getting together and Ridge will be there. Sally is aghast that Shirley wants to plant Coco at FC to steal their designs. Shirley says they need her. They need a spy, a mole otherwise they will end up in the rat hole themselves. Shirley springs it on Coco .the most prestigious place in town as an intern. She says she would give her right arm to be working over there. But she wanted to help them in the family business. Shirley quips that she will be helping them more than she knows. And Sally has a connection over at FC so she is sure she can get in. Pam calls the meeting and Thomas says yes the wedding is more important than business right now. Brooke, Ridge and Eric are all for it being held in Australia .including Quinn. RJ, with the help and assistance of Thomas conducts interviews for interns. Thomas says they are still looking for that one that really stands out. Shirley manages to convince Coco that she would be much more suited over at FC .finally Sally relents. She calls Thomas and says she knows Spectra might be a dirty word but her sister is here and she could use a job. Thomas tells her to send her sister over right away.",
        "Bill breaks into the family meeting and says he is the father of the groom so that makes him and Ridge .Coco shows up and Thomas tells Pam that he and RJ will handle this one by themselves. They are impressed. She tells them she did want to work with her sister but her business may not be around that much longer. She wants the opportunity to help them so just give her the chance and she will work hard. Shirley tries to convince Sally that this is business, borrow from Peter to pay Paul. She tells Sally they are in serious debt and now they have a way out and it all depends on her little sister. Shirley rants that this is like a recipe for Mulligan stew and Sally needs to get with the program. Bill tells Liam this is his day; there is no sharing with Brooke and Ridge. He also tells the group that he has forgotten how many times that Ridge has let Brooke down and he knows it will happen again. Eric leaves and then Bill says he would like to talk to Brooke. He wishes she did not have to put herself thru this again with Ridge. She says those days are over. Ridge is her destiny and Bill needs to accept that. She trusts Ridge and he has not let her down since they have gotten back together. They will spend the rest of their lives together. Ridge and Quinn throw knowing looks at each other."

        "Steffy: Destination wedding. Australia.",
        "Liam: Australia. Can't wait.",
        "Steffy: I know! It's gonna be so fun planning and inviting our families.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Question.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Liam: Um, is everyone that we talked about gonna be here for the announcement?",
        "Steffy: Uh, well, Thomas is busy interviewing interns, but other than that, um, no, I think everyone's gonna be here.",
        "Liam: What about Eric?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, he's gonna come and so is...Quinn.",
        "Liam: Quinn. Right. I know. I know that they're a package deal. It's just, uh... picturing Quinn at our wedding is like so...",
        "Steffy: I know, I get it. I get it, I completely understand where you're coming from and how you feel. It's just... it's my grandfather. And I love him so much.",
        "Liam: And I love you so much. So, yeah, okay. I get it. Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Good! Think you should call your dad?",
        "Liam: Ugh!",
        "Steffy: Yep.",
        "Liam: It's gonna be awkward.",
        "Steffy: Uh-huh.",
        "Liam: Him and ridge in the same room, breathing the same air.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Bill: Hey, Liam, what's up?",
        "Liam: Uh, so, Steffy and I are gathering the families together to discuss the wedding.",
        "Bill: Is Brooke gonna be there?",
        "Liam: Yes. So is ridge. Yeah, okay, so, we'll -- we'll stop by later and we'll talk about it then.",
        "Bill: Uh, yeah. Thank you, son.",
        "Darlita: Oh. Em. Gee. I love the way you accessorize.",
        "Coco: Thanks!",
        "Sally: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Shirley: Do you see me laughing?",
        "Sally: You want to plant my sister inside of Forrester to steal their designs?",
        "Shirley: She is a natural. She's sweet, she's innocent. They won't know what hit them.",
        "Sally: She's not a thief! She gave a gumball back one time because the machine gave her two instead of one.",
        "Shirley: Where does she get that?",
        "Saul: Oh, not from your side of the family...",
        "Sally: Okay, the point is...",
        "Shirley: The point is she'll learn. Your boyfriend needs an intern, right?",
        "Sally: Thomas is not my boyfriend.",
        "Shirley: I have seen the way he looks at you. If not now, he soon will be.",
        "Saul: All right.",
        "Shirley: In the meantime, we need a spy, a snoop, a mole. Otherwise, we're gonna end up in the rat hole.",
        "Saul: And after that review by Jarrett...",
        "Shirley: We're in the sludge heap, and your sister is our golden ticket back to respectability. Oh, and speaking of the devil...",
        "Coco: Hi. [Giggles]",
        "Shirley: Or the angel as it may be. [Giggles] Oh, sweetheart. You know what, things are just not looking so good here at spectra right this moment, but we know how much you want to be in the fashion business, so how would you feel about being an intern at L.A.'s biggest rag shop? That's right -- Forrester creations!",
        "Coco: [Giggles]",
        "Coco: Me? An intern at Forrester?",
        "Shirley: Is that something that would interest you?",
        "Coco: Grams, I would give my right arm to be working over there.",
        "Shirley: Mm.",
        "Darlita: But how you would get any work done without A...",
        "Saul: Figure of speech, Dar.",
        "Sally: Okay. Why don't we all just take a big, deep breath, yeah? Grams is just thinking out loud.",
        "Coco: I mean, they'd never hire me.",
        "Sally: Precisely! Yes, because you're a spectra. That is a four-letter word on that side of town.",
        "Darlita: 7 letters, actually.",
        "Coco: I mean, Forrester would be amazing, but I want to help the family business, especially if we're not doing well.",
        "Shirley: Oh, honey, you -- you'd be helping more than you know. And you know what? As far as getting hired there, in those hallowed halls, you have a connection!",
        "Coco: Wait, I do?",
        "Shirley: Your sister does.",
        "Thomas: All right, R.J. Since you're helping me head up the internship program, I want you to remember something. We are looking for more than just a gopher. We want somebody who's hungry, who sees a future in the industry.",
        "R.J.: Oh, like Charlotte.",
        "Thomas: Charlotte is a terrific intern.",
        "R.J.: If we can get someone of that caliber...",
        "Pam: Uh, let's try to keep this professional, guys.",
        "Thomas: Uh, Pam, would you go get the next candidate?",
        "Pam: Sure.",
        "R.J.: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought you had a meeting.",
        "Thomas: What meeting?",
        "R.J.: Steffy's.",
        "Thomas: Oh, yeah. That.",
        "R.J.: What, you're not going?",
        "Thomas: No, I don't have to go to that meeting, R.J.",
        "Pam: It's not really a business meeting. It's much more important, really. It's about Steffy's wedding.",
        "R.J.: Oh.",
        "Thomas: Right. And that's more important than business.",
        "Steffy: I just want to thank all of you for fitting us in.",
        "Eric: The C.E.O. Calls...",
        "Ridge: Co-CEO.",
        "Liam: Uh, yes, well, Steffy, the floor is yours. Let them have it.",
        "Steffy: Okay, well, we brought you here to announce our wedding destination. Per my cousin's excellent advice, we are having our wedding definitely in... Australia!",
        "Brooke: Yes! I knew it! Yay!",
        "Liam: And, uh -- and we'd love you all to be there. A little destination wedding, little witnessing of the vows.",
        "Ridge: Australia, huh?",
        "Ivy: This is so exciting! So what are the details? When are we going?",
        "Steffy: Uh, it's gonna be soon, very soon.",
        "Eric: Wow. I think it's a great idea.",
        "Liam: And, Eric, of course, you get a plus-one because you're married.",
        "Quinn: Well, we would love to be there.",
        "Eric: What about you two? Ridge? Brooke?",
        "Brooke: Yes! Of course we're gonna be there. Right, sweetie?",
        "Ridge: Absolutely.",
        "Steffy: Great! 'Cause what's better than one wedding? Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: Oh!",
        "Steffy: I'm just saying! You guys could get married in Australia.",
        "Brooke: [Giggles]",
        "Thomas: Thank you for coming in. Uh, your name is... Tory. Piper. Zoe.",
        "R.J.: Um, I see you study fashion philosophy?",
        "Pam: Um, what exactly is that? Well, Aristotle wrote that fashion is a form of flattery.",
        "Thomas: Smart guy. I like you. Well, I'm a go-getter, I'm good under pressure. I like to present solutions to problems rather than just bring up concerns.",
        "R.J.: Okay, so, where do you see yourself in 5 to 10 years? Well, I want to do a gap year before design school so that I can go abroad and learn the manufacturing side.",
        "Thomas: You know, your portfolio's not bad for just starting out. Thanks, I actually draws some inspirations from your designs.",
        "Thomas: Oh. But mainly your father. Ridge Forrester is amazing.",
        "Thomas: Interesting. My schedule's pretty open. I have internship blocks in my schedule on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and of course any time after classes. This is a paid internship, right?",
        "R.J.: Okay, and uh, what's your greatest weakness? That I care too much. But then I guess you could say that's also a strength in some way.",
        "R.J.: [Chuckles]",
        "Charlotte: I see what you did there.",
        "Thomas: What's your favorite fashion house? Forrester. Forrester. Forrester.",
        "Thomas: Thank you so much for coming in. It's been great talking to you.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, I -- I don't have any more questions, and, uh... I think we're good here.",
        "Pam: Okay. Great.",
        "Thomas: Great. Awesome. Thank you so much for coming in.",
        "Pam: Very good. I'll show you out. We'll be in touch. Okay.",
        "R.J.: Those were some good options.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. We're still looking for that one that really stands out.",
        "Coco: So you have a connection at Forrester creations? Who?",
        "Shirley: Thomas Forrester.",
        "Coco: The Thomas Forrester? Oh, that guy's so hot!",
        "Saul: Spoiled as a week-old glass of milk, and she's not that close to him.",
        "Shirley: Down, boy.",
        "Coco: I-I mean, if -- if you don't need me over here...",
        "Shirley: Honey, I think you'd be much better suited over there.",
        "Coco: [Giggles]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Thomas: Must be hard.",
        "Sally: The review?",
        "Thomas: No, uh, trying to get any work done when you can't stop thinking about me.",
        "Sally: Well, it sounds like you're speaking from experience.",
        "Thomas: Maybe a little bit. What's up?",
        "Sally: Are you still looking for interns?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, as we speak. So far, they're pretty, uh, meh.",
        "Sally: Looks like it is your lucky day 'cause I have got the cream of the crop.",
        "Thomas: Who is it?",
        "Sally: My sister. Now, look, I know she is a spectra and that is a dirty word, but she is a very hard worker, she's the best of the bunch.",
        "Thomas: Send her over.",
        "Sally: Really? You would do that for me?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, can she be here in 15 minutes?",
        "Sally: Yeah. She's on her way. Thank you, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: It's not a problem. Talk to you soon?",
        "Sally: Bye. [Sighs] Well, you better get going!",
        "Coco: Yes! [Squeals]",
        "Shirley: Come on! Come on! Get your purse! Hurry! Come on!",
        "Brooke: Steffy, it's a wonderful idea and I know you've mentioned it to us before, but isn't this your moment?",
        "Ridge: Brooke is right. We don't want to impose.",
        "Steffy: You wouldn't be imposing. That's crazy that you'd even think that.",
        "Bill: Hey, hope I didn't miss the good stuff.",
        "Liam: Dad! What are you doing here?",
        "Bill: What am I doing here? What are you doing here? Oh, I know what you're doing. You're planning a wedding! Who's the father of the groom? You want me there, don't you?",
        "Liam: Yes, dad. I want you there. I just didn't think you'd show up to --",
        "Bill: Forrester. Your daughter and my son are getting married. How about that, huh? So that makes you and me...",
        "Ridge: Mm, still nothing, bill.",
        "Bill: Exactly. Just the way we like it.",
        "Eric: They're not the only ones getting married. Ridge and Brooke are getting married in Australia, too.",
        "Bill: Is that true, Brooke?",
        "Charlotte: I guess we've interviewed all the candidates.",
        "Pam: Okay, I'll, uh, have more for you tomorrow.",
        "Thomas: Uh, Pam, hold on. There's one more coming in.",
        "Pam: There is?",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Thomas: Come on in!",
        "Pam: Oh, well, what -- I don't have another name here.",
        "Thomas: It's okay. She's not on the list, pam. Uh, R.J. And I are gonna handle this one. Thanks you guys for stepping in. I appreciate it.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Charlotte: Okay.",
        "Pam: Hello.",
        "Coco: [Laughing] Hi.",
        "Thomas: So, you must be sally's little sister.",
        "Coco: Yes. Coco.",
        "Thomas: Great to meet you. That's a great name for the industry. This is my little brother, R.J.",
        "R.J.: Hi.",
        "Coco: Hi, um...is it Reggie?",
        "R.J.: No. R.J. Just the letters.",
        "Coco: Okay. I'm sorry.",
        "R.J.: No, not a problem. It's definitely not a problem.",
        "Thomas: It says here you have an independent study in fashion.",
        "Coco: Yes. I worked it out with my advisor. Design, marketing, finance.",
        "R.J.: Impressive.",
        "Thomas: [Clears throat] Why Forrester?",
        "Coco: Aim high. My great-aunt sally taught me that.",
        "Thomas: Well, your sister has a fashion house. Why not work there?",
        "Coco: Uh, I was hoping to work with my sister, but, uh... spectra might not be around for much longer.",
        "Shirley: You did the right thing, sally.",
        "Sally: I am not so sure.",
        "Saul: Do we really think they'll hire her knowing she's a spectra?",
        "Sally: The thought of training my sister to be a thief...",
        "Shirley: You know what? It's part of your DNA. Your aunt sally built a thriving business and empire by robbing from peter and giving to Paul. It's business!",
        "Sally: Wow. Grams, you are something else.",
        "Shirley: Saul, honey, would you give me a minute alone with my granddaughter? Thank you. If you're about to give me a lesson on how to judge myself, you just go right ahead 'cause it's gonna go in this ear and right out the other. Sally, we are in serious debt. We can't pay our nut, and now we have a viable business plan, and it all hinges on your little sister!",
        "Bill: So, you and sluggo are going to get married in Australia?",
        "Brooke: Ridge and I have been engaged for a while now. This can't be coming as a surprise to you.",
        "Ridge: All right, let's slow down for a minute. Yes, we're coming to Australia and we're gonna support you and celebrate this great day with you, but that's it. And anyone who can't come, hopefully, will just stream it right to his gym.",
        "Steffy: Dad, you're not -- you're not gonna get married with us?",
        "Ridge: That's not what I just said.",
        "Ivy: Uh, sure sounds like it.",
        "Bill: Son, you two deserve this day. All yours. No sharing. You've waited long enough.",
        "Steffy: Liam and I want this. Don't we, babe?",
        "Ivy: Well, it'd be very romantic.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Listen, Australia, Cleveland, downtown Detroit -- it makes no difference to me. I want to marry you, but not with an audience. I want our vows to be just us. Okay?",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Will you just please get on board? Please.",
        "Ridge: I don't want to be rude, but I just -- I don't enjoy everyone here.",
        "Bill: Well, banner day. We agree twice. I got to tell you, Forrester, you've let Brooke down how many times? Anybody want to help me out? Well, you know, so many times we've all forgotten. And I wouldn't be surprised if you did it again.",
        "R.J.: Wait, your sister's going out of business?",
        "Thomas: Uh, R.J., It's complicated.",
        "Coco: I'm -- I'm not here to talk about my family's problems. They'll muddle their way through it. They always seem to.",
        "Thomas: So, what are you hoping to get out of this internship, coco?",
        "Coco: Just real-time experience. I've studied a lot of the great fashion houses -- their internal structures, their branding philosophies, even their brick-and-mortar stores. But it's one thing to study it in books and online, and it's another to be in the mix, you know? Watching it operate and being a part of the process. I'm here to contribute, Mr. Forrester. Given the opportunity, I will. I'll exceed your expectations.",
        "Shirley: Coco will rise to the occasion just like the rest of us. She's got spectra blood that flows through her.",
        "Sally: Yes, but she also has goodness that flows through her, too, okay? Stealing and copying designs is not rising to the occasion. It is criminal!",
        "Shirley: It is business! And just when did you get so soft?",
        "Sally: Okay! I am not soft! I am just as tough as you and aunt sally, maybe even tougher! But coco isn't, okay? She is a sweet person!",
        "Shirley: We are knock-off artists. We are now, we have been, and we will be. It is like a family recipe of mulligan stew, and you, dear heart, need to get with the program.",
        "Sally: [Sighs] I just thought the program was gonna be different.",
        "Brooke: You two are not going to argue. Not here, not today. Bill, ridge hasn't let me down. It's silly that you would even suggest it.",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry, honey, but bill and I, we're just never gonna... but your wedding is gonna be wonderful.",
        "Steffy: Our weddings. I'm not letting it go.",
        "Ridge: We'll see.",
        "Eric: All right, you two. Look, there's a lot of planning to do. Come in the design office with me, we'll get some drawings started.",
        "Steffy: Ooh! Yes! Thank you.",
        "Eric: Come on! This'll be good. Ivy, you come, too, right? You'll give us some accessory ideas and some locations and all things \"Aussie,\" if you will.",
        "Liam: Dad. Behave yourself.",
        "Eric: Why don't you stay and referee if necessary. Will you do that for me?",
        "Quinn: Uh...",
        "Bill: I want to talk to Brooke alone.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's not gonna happen.",
        "Bill: Whatever. It's nothing I haven't said to Brooke 1,000 times before. You want to stick around, no problem. You're asking for heartbreak.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Bill --",
        "Bill: Let me finish. When it happens, I will be there to pick you up. I just wish you didn't have to put yourself through this. Again. But Forrester -- he hurts you. It's what he does. Every time. And I don't want to see you suffer. But you will. Believe me, you will.",
        "Brooke: You're wrong. Those days are over.",
        "Bill: No, they aren't.",
        "Brooke: That's all the in the past.",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: Ridge and I have come full circle. He is my destiny, and I am his. And if you can't accept that...",
        "Bill: Oh, what? What, you think I'm not going to go to my son's wedding? I'm going. I'm just trying to get through to you because I care about you.",
        "Brooke: Since ridge and I have been back together, he hasn't do anything to let me down.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: You have to believe that. I do. I trust ridge implicitly. Ridge and I are going to be married. We are going to spend the rest of our lives together."
