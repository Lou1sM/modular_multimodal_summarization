        "Wyatt kisses Hope. Aly is peeking behind the door and bursts in and shouts at Wyatt to take his hands off of Hope right now. It catches them so by surprise that they don't know if she is serious or what. Thorne confides in Brooke that Aly thinks Wyatt is bad for Hope and the company. Aly wanted to be at Brooke's wedding but he sensed something was wrong then. That's why he flew her to Paris and put her to work with the HFTF collection which she loves. She has her whole room with promo material all over the wall and Hope's quotes on her bulletin board. She admires Hope and her message. She lives by it and it has helped her through some tough situations. But with Wyatt she sees Hope as losing her way. Thorne says it is not Wyatt's fault. He doesn't even know Aly has a problem. Neither does Hope or the younger kids and he'd like to keep it that way. Brooke says she has to hope that Hope and Wyatt will win Aly over. Thorne wants to agree but he says when Aly is in that spiral, there is not much anyone can do. She idolizes Hope but that is part of the problem. Hope was perfect in her eyes. But when she started seeing Wyatt she felt betrayed. He tells Brooke that he is glad she is here. He needs all the support he can get. He hates to see her like this. It is ripping him apart. Eric is surprised to see Taylor walk into his office, They hug. She says all is fine and with Thorne in Paris the entire company has been energized. Eric tells her about Hope and Wyatt being in Paris now with Stephanie's jewelry. She brings up the obvious that Ridge is back now with Brooke. She is okay with that if it is what both want. He asks if she saw Aly before she left. She says no and asks how she is. Eric says okay until she heard Wyatt's name and that set her off. She obviously doesn't like him but the way she said it with that tone in her voice scared him. She was very aggressive and very, very negative. And he's worried about her. Taylor says Eric knows her history with Aly and she's always had concerns for her. Hope asks Aly what's the problem. Aly sneers that Wyatt is the problem. He's wrong for her, all wrong. Wyatt thinks she is joking. Aly says no and she can't believe Hope would let him touch or kiss her. It's disgusting. Hope tries to calm her down and find out what's bothering her. Aly goes on a tirade \u0096 HFTF, her message. She is ruining it. Wyatt is ruining it. Wyatt gets it \u0096 she is not joking. Aly continues that she admired Hope so much, her commitment, her self-respect but she doesn't recognize her anymore. And it all started when he came into her life. She hates it. Thorne and Thomas walk in and Thorne asks what is going on. Hope tells Aly that she is sorry if she upset her. Thorne says Wyatt has a presentation to make so Brooke joins in. Wyatt says they are trending all over the world. HFTF is the industry darling and now they are going to make it the industry addiction with this \u0096 the Stephanie Forrester collection. Wyatt points out many pieces when people will remember that Stephanie wore at openings and galas. She was the matriarch of the family. The blue HFTF diamond was a smashing success and this will keep the momentum going. Everyone agrees it will be a great promotion ..well everyone but Aly. She lashes out at Wyatt that how dare he make a spectacle of her grandmother. These are family heirlooms, not a circus sideshow. This is so wrong. Thorne tries to tell her this is an incredible collection that will honor her grandmother. Aly says HFTF has a message and it's not this publicity stunt like the stupid diamond one. They have to get HFTF back on track. She says with Wyatt it's all about money. They don't need money. They need to stay true to the principles and values. Brooke adds that the message was wonderful but it was problematic. Aly says not for her. She's on line every day with Hope's fans. She can not let Wyatt and his mother pollute that message. Hope reminds her the line is not so much the message anymore. Aly says it should be. Taylor tells Eric that she wishes she could reach out and help Aly out but she's not the one to do that. It was an inexcusable accident but she did cause her mother's death. And she will never forget how she cut up her dress on her wedding day. And the loss of her mother is not the worst of the problem. If she is spiraling downward, then Hope and Wyatt will have their hands full. Hope tells Wyatt that he did good and she is sorry for the way Aly went off on him. Hopefully Aly will come around. Aly peeks in the door just as Wyatt and Hope kiss. She excuses herself to go see her mother. Aly makes her presence known by slamming the door. Wyatt is packing some of the jewelry away. She says kids at school used to tease her that she was nerdy and self-absorbed. But it is Wyatt that is self-absorbed. She says he is destroying Hope and this family and she can't let that happen. He tries to reason with her but she cuts him off. She puts her finger in his face and says he can do what he wants with the Fullers but when it comes to her family he will respect them.",
        "Wyatt wants to know what did he ever do to Aly or where this is coming from. She continues that Hope is caught up in something. She can't see it but Aly can. She tells Wyatt that he is bad for Hope. She should have just married Liam but she didn't. She became a hypocrite and compromised everything. Aly says she has to save Hope from him. And she is going to and put a stop to all of this. Hope asks Brooke to tell her more about Aly. Thorne says he will take care of it. Brooke says Aly will come around as far as Wyatt; how could she not. Hope says yeah that guy could charm the skin off a snake. Wyatt tells Aly that he doesn't know where the anger is coming from but she needs to calm down. She mentions that he enticed her away from Liam .the nicest, sweetest, funniest man anyone could ever want. He tells her again that she needs to slow down. Instead she gets more in his face and calls him greedy and Mr. Popular, Mr. Big Shot. He may have Hope dazzled but not for much longer. She's gonna see to that. She says she may not have been the most popular girl in school but she knows his type .hanging around the lockers with all the jocks and the dumb cheer girls. He says it was not like that for him and he'd really like to get along her with her. He says the promotion is going to be good for the line and the company and he thinks Stephanie would not have minded either. He says again they are both in this together, like a family. She rants no they are not, not even close. They are not part of anything ad he will never touch Hope again. He better hear that. He hesitates for a moment and then says it is a little late since they are both a member of the mile-high club. She clobbers him across the mouth and tells him how dare he. With his jaw turned, she grabs a fistful of jewels. On her way out she tells him to pack up his jewels. Then take his mother and go back to his slimy home because he is done here. He is officially fired from FC and will not go near Hope again. She hopes she has made herself perfectly clear."

        "Aly: He's wrong for you. All wrong!",
        "Wyatt: You're joking, right?",

        "Wyatt: Wow, you're obviously not joking.",
        "Aly: I admired you so much. Commitment, self-respect -- what happened to all that? I don't even know who you are anymore.",
        "Hope: Wow. Aly, I'm -- I'm sorry. How long have you felt this way?",

        "Thomas: Nice. Well, it's good to have you here with us.",
        "Thorne: Um, so... Wyatt has a presentation to make?",
        "Thomas: All right. Well, I'm ready whenever you are.",
        "Wyatt: Well, all right. [Clears throat] So, we are trending all over the world. HFTF is the industry darling. Now we're gonna make it the industry addiction... with this. The Stephanie Forrester collection.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Thorne: It's amazing. Wow.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: We had a conference call earlier that Aly was in on, and, uh... when Wyatt's name was mentioned, it set her off.",
        "Taylor: It set her off?",
        "Eric: Yeah. She obviously doesn't like him. But the way she made that known, that -- that's -- that's what scared me.",
        "Taylor: Eric, you know my history with Aly, and I've always had my concerns for her.",
        "Eric: Look, she was aggressive. She was very, very negative.",
        "Taylor: Has something happened recently? Did Wyatt do something to offend her?",
        "Eric: Well, he's... become personally involved with Hope.",
        "Taylor: And she doesn't like that.",
        "Eric: She thinks he's bad news, or at least that's -- that's the way she puts it. And she can't understand why Hope doesn't see that. I'm worried about her, Taylor.",
        "Taylor: I can understand why.",
        "Eric: I thought that shadowing Hope at Forrester was gonna be a positive thing in her life. In fact, I was sure it would be. Been having...trouble at school, violent reactions.",
        "Taylor: So, does Hope know about Aly's issues?",
        "Eric: No. No, she doesn't. Thorne didn't want that, and Aly didn't want that, either. And it's not so much her issues that I'm worried about, it's -- it was the tone in her voice when Wyatt's name was mentioned. It wasn't good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Stephanie Forrester, the family matriarch. Her name is synonymous with elegance and class, and everybody in the world knows it. I mean, they've seen her at showings and galas and -- and receptions here in Paris and in L.A. I mean, who doesn't remember her wearing this piece on the covers of fashion magazines all over the world? Look, Stephanie's jewelry collection is a fashion-history artifact and no doubt will someday be in a museum. But for now, we have the opportunity -- maybe even the responsibility -- to bring it to the world. And the world will flock to come and see it. As you all know, Hope for the Future has an upcoming show here in Paris, and I suggest that we display this collection at that showing. The blue HFTF diamond was a smashing success. This will keep the momentum going. This will keep us front and center in fashion consciousness. So, what do you say? Let's do this?",
        "Brooke: Sounds great.",
        "Thomas: Very good job, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Thorne: Well done, Wyatt. Very well done. I remember mother wearing this at the Olympic ball in Innsbruck.",
        "Brooke: I remember when Stephanie wore this to the Queen's jubilee.",
        "Hope: Mm.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles]",
        "Thorne: Well, that's a great idea, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks.",
        "Thorne: Everyone agree?",
        "Hope: [Laughing] Yes.",
        "Aly: No. I don't. How dare you make a spectacle of my grandmother? These jewels are family heirlooms. They are precious, and you want to put them on display like a sideshow? That is so wrong.",
        "Thorne: Honey, this isn't a sideshow. This jewelry collection is going to honor your grandmother.",
        "Thomas: It's the perfect fit -- Stephanie's elegant jewelry, Hope's incredible collection.",
        "Aly: Hope for the Future has a message. This? This is a publicity stunt just like that stupid blue diamond. We have to get Hope for the Future back on track.",
        "Wyatt: Back on track? The sales are off the charts.",
        "Aly: You see what I mean about him? It's all about money. We don't need money. What we need is to stay true to what Hope represents -- principles, values.",
        "Wyatt: You're serious.",
        "Brooke: Aly, the message was wonderful, but it did cause a problem.",
        "Aly: Not for me it didn't. And not for the people who admire Hope. I am online with your fans every day reminding them what you stand for. We cannot let Wyatt and his mother pollute that message.",
        "Thomas: Pollute the message?",
        "Hope: Aly... like my mom said, tying the message to the line was great in theory, but it did become very problematic.",
        "Aly: What are you saying, Hope?",
        "Hope: Well, I'm saying that the line isn't so much about the message anymore.",
        "Aly: Well, it should be. That was the best part!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Aly may need to see someone.",
        "Taylor: [Sighs] I can't tell you how much I wish I could reach out and help her. It's just I don't think I'm the right person. I don't think she's ever going to get over what happened.",
        "Eric: I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Taylor: Why? Why should she have to get over me causing her mother's death?",
        "Eric: It was a car accident, Taylor.",
        "Taylor: It was an inexcusable accident... unforgivable from a child's perspective. I'll never forget having to sit her down when Thorne and I told her that she would never see her mother again. [Sighs] It was heartbreaking.",
        "[Taylor remembering]",
        "Taylor: Your mommy isn't coming back, okay? But you know where she is? She's right here. She's right there in your heart.",
        "[Back to present]",
        "Eric: You handled that as best you could.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, but I could never make up for all the pain. She had so much pent-up anger. I'll never forget what she did on my wedding day.",
        "[Taylor remembering]",
        "Aly: Don't!",
        "Taylor: What? [Gasps]",
        "[Back to present]",
        "Taylor: I feel for her, Eric, I do. I'm -- I'm never going to forgive myself. I mean, I talk to patients who've gone through this every day -- patients who've gone through so much loss as a child. I know what it does.",
        "Eric: Do you think this is the root of her problem? The loss of her mother?",
        "Taylor: [Sighs] Actually, it's much deeper than that. If Aly is spiraling downward, Hope and Wyatt are going to have their hands full.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Wow.",
        "Hope: You were incredible.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Well, somebody in the room didn't think so.",
        "Hope: That was really unexpected.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: I mean, I-I knew that she had, you know, some issues with you, but --",
        "Wyatt: Like she hates me?",
        "Hope: Ugh! I'm so sorry.",
        "Wyatt: Look, its okay. It's fine. We knocked it out of the park. Aly will come around. Or not.",
        "Hope: Oh, God.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: You're so good at this stuff.",
        "Wyatt: Stuff?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: This stuff?",
        "Hope: This stuff. All -- all kinds of stuff.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: Yeah. It's really a turn-on watching you do your thing.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: I am not a piece of meat, okay? I believe in this line. And it's gonna put you back on the covers where you belong. You know?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] I have to go talk to my mom.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. See you later.",
        "Aly: You know, kids at school used to tease me. They used to say that I was nerdy and self-absorbed.",
        "Wyatt: Well, they were wrong. You're not self-absorbed.",
        "Aly: I know. You are.",
        "Wyatt: Aly --",
        "Aly: You're destroying her. Hope, Hope for the Future, even this family. I can't let that happen.",
        "Wyatt: How am I destroying them?",
        "Aly: This, for starters. My grandmother's legacy, and you're turning it into a circus act.",
        "Wyatt: That is not what I'm --",
        "Aly: Listen to me. You do whatever you want when it comes to the Fullers. But when it comes to me and my family and our business, you respect us.",
        "Wyatt: What have I ever done to you, huh? What is this all --",
        "Aly: Hope is caught up in something. She can't see it, but I can. You're bad for her, Wyatt. Bad for this line. If she would have just married Liam... but she didn't. She became a hypocrite... compromised everything she believed in. I have to save her... from you. And I'm going to, Wyatt. I am going to put a stop to all of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Tell me about Aly.",
        "Brooke: She's just sensitive, Sweetie.",
        "Hope: I'll say. She, uh -- she really didn't like Wyatt's idea.",
        "Thorne: Well, I'll deal with Aly.",
        "Hope: She just, um... she seems different, you know? Is -- is she okay?",
        "Brooke: She's always looked up to you.",
        "Hope: Yeah, but to go off on Wyatt like that was...",
        "Thorne: It's your message -- the original message. Hope, that meant a lot to Aly in high school.",
        "Brooke: She'll get used to Wyatt. How could she not?",
        "Hope: Okay. True. You know, that guy could charm the skin off a snake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I don't know where all this anger is coming from, but you need to calm down.",
        "Aly: You and your flashy jewels. And you know what's just so funny? Is that they're not even yours, and you act like they are.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Aly: My grandmother's precious heirlooms, and you take them and use them to entice Hope. It's disgusting.",
        "Wyatt: Entice her?",
        "Aly: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Entice her.",
        "Aly: Yeah. Away from Liam. The nicest, sweetest, funniest man you could ever want.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God. You need to slow down, girl.",
        "Aly: You know, there is nothing to you, Wyatt. Greed, maybe. Self-promotion. Big-shot Mr. Popular.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, that's enough.",
        "Aly: Turning heads, trending. You don't give a darn about Hope for the Future. You're just using it -- her beautiful line, her inspiring message -- and you turn it into something ugly.",
        "Wyatt: You finished?",
        "Aly: You may have her dazzled, but not for much longer.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Aly: I'm gonna see to that.",
        "Wyatt: You will, huh?",
        "Aly: Yeah. I will. Maybe I wasn't the most popular girl in school, but I know your type -- hanging out at the lockers with all the jocks, getting all the attention from the dumb cheer girls. I know exactly who you are.",
        "Wyatt: Aly, it wasn't like that for me. Look, I want to get along with you, okay? You don't like this promotion, I get that. But you need to look and see how much this is gonna benefit Hope and the line and the company. And Stephanie wouldn't mind, either.",
        "Aly: You didn't even know my grandmother.",
        "Wyatt: I've heard enough about her.",
        "Aly: That is not the same thing.",
        "Wyatt: Aly, we are both in this together, okay? It's like we're part of the same family here. Now, would you please just cut me some slack?",
        "Aly: No, no. You and I, we are not part of the same family. You and I are not part of the same anything. You will not touch Hope again. Do you hear me?",
        "Wyatt: Well, it's a bit late for that now... now that we're both members of the mile-high club.",
        "Aly: How dare you!",
        "Wyatt: Ow!",
        "Aly: [Sighs] You pack up your jewels, you take your mother, and you go back to your slimy home, wherever that may be. You are done here, Wyatt. Done. You are officially fired from Forrester Creations, and you will not go near Hope again. Is that understood? Have I made myself perfectly clear?"
