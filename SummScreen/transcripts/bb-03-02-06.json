        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: I don't care what Nick says, your mother's not going to believe that you want her to have a life with him.",
        "Bridget: I think you're right. She's going to need to hear this from me.",
        "Dante: You gonna call her?",
        "Bridget: No, I'm gonna go down there. Where'd I leave my keys?",
        "Dante: Forget 'em, I'll drive you over there. Let's go.",
        "Bridget: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darla: I settled the musicians and the minister in the kitchen with some food and coffee. Told them just to hang tight, that Forrester weddings rarely go smoothly.",
        "Thorne: Thank you, honey.",
        "Eric: Who the hell does Nick think he is, barging in here like this? I'm going to go up there.",
        "Stephanie: No, you're not. You leave them alone, let them sort it out on their own.",
        "Eric: To sort what out? Brooke is marrying Ridge.",
        "Sally: Or not.",
        "Eric: Nick should be home with his wife. What kind of a man would -- what kind of a son --",
        "Massimo: You think I approve of this? Watching Dominick act like a lovesick fool while he's married to a lovely girl like Bridget? Come on. God sake, Eric. You know I care for her as much --",
        "Jackie: We all do. So does Nicky.",
        "Thorne: Well, then how do you explain this, Jackie?",
        "Jackie: I can't explain it, Thorne. But I know my son. And I know that he would never ever hurt Bridget or her mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Don't touch me!",
        "Ridge: What the hell's going on in there?",
        "Nick: You've got to listen to me.",
        "Brooke: Get out of my way!",
        "Nick: No, not until you hear me out.",
        "Brooke: Nick, what the hell are you doing here? This is my wedding day. And you're married to my daughter!",
        "Nick: She doesn't want to be married to me anymore.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Nick: She told me that you and I belong together. And she's right.",
        "Brooke: Stop it.",
        "Nick: We made a sacrifice for her. A sacrifice that she's seen through. My heart's with you. It always be. She knows it, I know it and I know that you know --",
        "Brooke: I said stop it!",
        "Nick: Listen to me! It's over with Bridget. And she's okay with that. She is the reason I am here. She told me to stop this wedding.",
        "Brooke: What are you talking about?",
        "Nick: We went over it. We talked about it, and it was painful -- it was painful for both of us. But it's not as painful as if we would try to hold onto something that we both know was never meant to be.",
        "Brooke: Nick, don't say that. Bridget loves you.",
        "Nick: And I will always love her. But that is not what this is about. This is about honesty. E feelings we have for each other are never going away. That's why you can't marry forrester. Because deep down, you don't love him the same way that you love me.",
        "Ridge: All right logan, stand back. I'm kicking down the door.",
        "Brooke: Ridge -- ridge, wait, okay? I'm fine. Just give me a minute. I don't want this to turn into more of a fiasco than it already is.",
        "Ridge: All right. All right, I'll tell everybody there's going to be a short delay. But there is going to be a wedding, nick. You hear that?",
        "Nick: Well, there may be a wedding somewhere today, but it's not going to be his.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darla: Poor bridget, you know? When she finds out what nick's done --",
        "Thorne: This guy's totally off his rocker.",
        "Darla: Or so completely in love with brooke that he's not thinking about anything else other than stopping her from marrying ridge.",
        "Thorne: Which is not going to happen. Not if my big brother has anything to say about it.",
        "Sally: Here he comes now.",
        "Eric: Ridge? Ridge, what's going on up there? I was just about to go up there.",
        "Ridge: Brooke asked for a couple of minus to resolve all this. But that's all I'm giving him, a couple of minutes.",
        "Sally: And what did the good captain do? Lock the two of them in her bedroom?",
        "Massimo: Oh, I'll handle this.",
        "Stephanie: No, you won'T. Stop. You've got to acknowledge what's going on here, honey. If brooke really wanted to marry you, do you think she would have let him pick her up and cart her off upstairs that way? Plus ask for time alone? You're not listening to her. She's telling you loud and clear, ridge. She's in love with him.",
        "Brooke: I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe that you could do this to my daughter. How could you be so cruel?",
        "Nick: I told you what she said.",
        "Brooke: I don't care what she said to you. She lost two children in a matter of days. She is grieving. This is not the time for her to be making decisions about her marriage. She's confused. She's vulnerable. She can't think straight. And neither can you.",
        "Nick: You're wrong. Our marriage is about being parents and becoming a family. But we lost nicole, and as much as we love dominick, dante's his father and he's going to raise him. Don't you see, brooke? We're finally able to admit to ourselves, and to each other, that we were together because of the kids, and she doesn't want that. She wants to do what's right. And what's right for bridget is the two of us being together.",
        "Brooke: I'll never believe that. Now just get the hell out of here. I can't take any more of this.",
        "Thorne: I'm sorry, ridge. This shouldn't be happening.",
        "Ridge: You're damn right it shouldn'T. Brooke loves me. You heard the vows.",
        "Thorne: I know, and that's what she's trying to get through his thick skull right now -- that her life is with you, not him. Now listen, don't let what mother said get you down, okay?",
        "Eric: You stay out of this.",
        "Stephanie: He's just in denial. He cannot accept the fact that the woman he was going to marry is in love --",
        "Eric: Is marrying, all right? Brooke is not going to dump ridge for nick.",
        "Stephanie: You're worse than he is. Why can't you see what's going on here?",
        "Bridget: Dad, where's nick? Answer me, dad! Where is nick?",
        "Eric: He's upstairs.",
        "Bridget: With mom? Is he with my mother?",
        "Stephanie: Yes.",
        "Bridget: And what about the wedding?",
        "Stephanie: It's on hold.",
        "Eric: Bridget, bridget, bridget --",
        "Ridge: Not for long, it's not. I'm going after her.",
        "Stephanie: No, you're not. And say what? You have no idea what's going on upstairs.",
        "Ridge: All the more reason to stop her, mother.",
        "Stephanie: From what, honey? From finding out that her husband is still in love with her mother? She's known that all along. Honey, I don't want to see bridget hurt any more than you do, and I don't want you hurt. But you are in as much denial as she is. The four of you in denial, and it's got to stop at some point.",
        "Nick: I'm not going anywhere until we get one thing straight. Bridget is the one who ended this marriage, not me. She's the one who took this ring off of my finger.",
        "Brooke: She is confused.",
        "Nick: No. She sees things the way they really are. You know your daughter, brooke. She's smart, intelligent and strong. She sees the truth. A marriage based on a sacrifice -- no one's going to wind up happy, especially bridget. Now, we made a commitment not to hurt her. And we lived up to that commitment. But now, things have changed.",
        "Brooke: If you're talking about the children, losing nicole --",
        "Nick: Everything. I'm talking about everything. But most importantly, bridget doesn't want a life with me anymore.",
        "Brooke: No. No, I am not going to believe that bridget wants to give you up! She loves you too much, nick, and you love her.",
        "Nick: And I always will. But she deserves something better than me, brooke. She deserves a man that is going to love her unconditionally. The way that I love you.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Bridget: Mom, nick, will you let me in, please? Nick, please let me in. Mom --",
        "Brooke: Sweetheart, I'm so sorry.",
        "Bridget: No, you don't need to apologize. I'm just so glad that I got here before you married ridge and you made the biggest mistake of your life.",
        "[Coughing]",
        "Dante: After today -- maybe.",
        "[Dante fantasizing] Hey, this is a pleasant surprise. Bridget: I hope you don't mind. I don't mean to be nosey.",
        "Dante: With that cute little nose? I told you, you can come here any time you like. Hi. You okay?",
        "Bridget: They're off.",
        "Dante: Who? Oh, your mother and nick?",
        "Bridget: St. Bart's, I think.",
        "Dante: Oh, I see.",
        "Bridget: I'm fine. I was expecting it.",
        "Dante: Still, you know --",
        "Bridget: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Dante: You think it's going to last?",
        "Bridget: Right now, I don't care if it's going to last. I'm just so glad things are out in the open.",
        "Dante: Now there's my girl.",
        "Bridget: You know what else I'm really glad about?",
        "Dante: What?",
        "Bridget: You. Your role in my life has changed so many times. Friend, confidant -- and now, you're the father of our child.",
        "Dante: Maybe someday it'll change again.",
        "Bridget: Like?",
        "Dante: Like we take it up a notch or two.",
        "Bridget: A notch?",
        "Dante: Yeah, you see -- the birds do it. The bees do it. I mean, even the monkeys in the trees do it.",
        "Bridget: I don't remember -- is that not how it goes?",
        "Dante: You could show me how it goes.",
        "Bridget: You are so bad.",
        "Dante: Are you talking about me, this guy who's been playing nursemaid? Look, you don't have to -- you don't have to decide this week, next month. Whenever you're ready. Because you know how I feel about you. I mean, if you have a problem with a man appreciating what you have to offer, every little thing, then by all means, you could take a pass. You could always go back to someone like deacon or nick. More of the same. If that's what you're looking for.",
        "Bridget: What I'm looking for is you. Where have you been all my life?",
        "Dante: Under that nosey, cute little nose.",
        "Jackie: I don't know how much longer we're going to be able to stop those three from tearing up the stairs.",
        "Stephanie: Well, we better, unless we want the ceremony to continue. And I know you don't want that any more than I do. God, I wish I could pass this headache on to you.",
        "Jackie: \"This headache\" being brooke, of course?",
        "Stephanie: Well, she's in love with your son.",
        "Jackie: Yeah, well, it's no secret that I've believed for a long time that nicky belongs with brooke. But my son is an honorable man, and he made a commitment to bridget and --",
        "Stephanie: He only went back to her because she was pregnant. Bridget -- I believe she knew that from the very beginning, she just couldn't face it until I --",
        "Jackie: Until you what, stephanie? You didn't go over to bridget's and pressure her into -- oh god, stephanie, what have you done?",
        "Brooke: A mistake?",
        "Bridget: Mom, you should not be marrying ridge if you're still in love with nick.",
        "Brooke: Sweetheart --",
        "Bridget: No, don'T. Please, don'T. If you ever want to be happy again, you've got to stop doing this.",
        "Brooke: Doing what?",
        "Bridget: Just living this way and marrying people that you're not in love with. That is over. It's over. And so is my marriage.",
        "Brooke: Bridget, no.",
        "Bridget: Mom, please. I know that you love him. And I know that he loves you. You can keep trying to fight it or resist it.",
        "Brooke: I am not going to let you to talk this way. You are overwhelmed. And you just suffered a tragic loss.",
        "Bridget: I'm probably going to be suffering that loss for the rest of my life. But you know what would be just as tragic, is if I just bury my head and pretend things aren't the way they really are. Please, please, listen to me. I know that you love nick. See, I can say that without any resentment or any bitterness. Do I wish things were different for me? Of course I do, mother. I -- I love him. But losing nicole and finding out dominick's real paternity, it made me to look at things a lot more honestly. I'll never have the life that I really need -- that I know, deep down, you really want for me -- that we all want for each other -- if I keep holding on to things that aren't really mine to begin with. The truth is, you would not be marrying ridge today if nick was available. But he's available now. You are free to be together.",
        "Jackie: I want an answer, stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: This is not the time or the place.",
        "Jackie: If you went over there and you --",
        "Eric: Over where? What's going on? What're you talking about?",
        "Jackie: Apparently, stephanie had a heart-to-heart with bridget that none of us knew about. Lord knows what she said.",
        "Stephanie: I said what needed to be said, something that none of you were willing to do.",
        "Massimo: Which is what?",
        "Stephanie: Mas, that marriage has no children to hold it together anymore. I told bridget let him go. She needs to find someone who's in love with her. She deserves a life with a man who's not in love with her mother. I hope that's what she did. I hope that's why he barged in here and carted brooke off. Let brooke have him. Let them sail off into the sunset, for god's sakes. And don't pretend like I'm meddling.",
        "Ridge: You just can't stay out of our lives, can you, mother? I'll deal with you later. After the minister pronounces brooke and me husband and wife.",
        "Brooke: Ridge is waiting for me downstairs.",
        "Bridget: I'll go talk to him.",
        "Brooke: No! You are giving up on your marriage at a time when you need it the most. I am not going to let you do this.",
        "Bridget: Mom, what I need from you right now is honesty. I know that you love ridge, but deep down, I know who you really, really want is nick.",
        "Brooke: Honey, please --",
        "Bridget: No, mom. It's okay. You do. I know that you do. It's okay. My marriage is over. He's yours. Listen to me -- you are both free to be together, okay?",
        "Ridge: What is wrong with you? Get the hell out of this house, nick. We're seconds away from being married. Come on, brooke, the minister's waiting. Logan? Brooke?"
