        "Ridge talks on the phone to Brooke and then Hope separately. Brooke tells him she is anxious to come back from Paris and marry him. Hope wants to make sure that he and Katie are using this time to decide how they feel. She will not let him marry her mother if he has divided feelings. Katie tells Ridge that they should not be doing this. He should be married to Brooke by now. He says it is happening though, and he doesn't want to be with Brooke. She says she needs some air and he asks if he might join her. She'd like that. They take a walk in their favorite spot, the park. Hope apologizes to Wyatt for having to go through that presentation that everyone loved except Aly and how she was so against it. He's not sure he should tell her but finally does. Aly came back later and really let him have it complete with a slap. It's clear she has some major anger management issues and is borderline obsessed over Hope. She's taking this Shadowgirl thing to a whole new level. Brooke politely tells Aly that she likes and respects her, but she thinks she went a little overboard in the meeting. Aly claims she does not like Wyatt. She begs Brooke to please make sure Hope doesn't get too involved with him. He and his mom are definitely wrong for FC. She starts to bring up what Wyatt told her about the mile high club, Brooke interrupts and says Hope is an adult now. This is none of their business. She can take care of herself.",
        "Aly needs to drop something off to Hope that she will need. Brooke gives her Hope's room keycard if Hope is out of the room. Wyatt convinces Hope to skip dinner out and just stay in their room instead. They are in the bedroom with clothes askew about to make love. Aly knocks on the door but when she gets no answer, she lets herself in. She leaves the envelope but then hears Hope giggle several times. Aly opens the bedroom door and screams for Wyatt to stop doing that. Katie tells Ridge they have to stop this. She wants one good reason why they should continue. He tells her he has one good reason. He loves her."

        "Ridge: But Hope needed you in Paris.",
        "Brooke: I still don't know why that was so important. But you know what? Wyatt surprised her. He was on the plane. And I'm sure they can handle everything all by themselves. I can't wait to see you. And I'm gonna come home as soon as possible, and then we can start our life together. Bye.",

        "Ridge: You've been gone half a day.",
        "Hope: You know I don't like keeping things from my mom. I'm giving you this time so she doesn't get her heart broken again. You've got to figure out what you and Katie want. And if that's nothing, fantastic. But...if there are real feelings there, don't lie to yourselves about it, because I'm not going to let you marry my mom again until you're sure that she's the one.",
        "Ridge: I don't want to hurt your mother. This is complicated, Hope.",

        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",

        "Wyatt: I'm not...intruding on your girl's trip?",

        "Wyatt: Yeah? Well, I mean the meeting with throne and everyone at International went well.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. It did. Everyone's very excited about you showcasing the Stephanie Forrester jewelry collection.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I'm psyched. And everyone seemed to be on board, so...",
        "Hope: Yeah. Everyone except Aly. Wow, was she tough on you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I'm so sorry that happened.",
        "Brooke: Just one of those things. A minor setback.",
        "Aly: But you and Ridge were supposed to be married, and now you're not.",
        "Brooke: We will be soon. I'm not worried.",
        "Aly: You miss him.",
        "Brooke: Yes. But this is a short trip. We were apart for so long -- he was here and I was there -- and now...I don't want to be away from him now that I have him back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You should be married to Brooke by now. And you would be if I hadn't faked that collapse.",
        "Ridge: Well, you reacted in the moment.",
        "Katie: We shouldn't be doing this.",
        "Ridge: Shouldn't be doing what?",
        "Katie: This -- being here, together. I really think its best if you just left.",
        "Ridge: No, I don't want to leave. And I don't want to hurt Brooke. I -- I don't... I didn't want any of this, but it's here now, and we... we got to find a way to deal with it.",
        "Katie: Listen, I -- I need to get out of here. I -- I need some air.",
        "Ridge: Mind if I join you?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'd like that. Look, I know we have a lot to talk about, but... I don't know what to say.",
        "Ridge: Neither do I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Uh... I didn't know if I should bring this up or not, but, um...",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Wyatt: Aly.",
        "Hope: Oh, God. I am so, so sorry that she snapped at you like that.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no, it wasn't just in the meeting. It was after you left when she really let me have it.",
        "Hope: She came back?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, did she ever.",
        "Hope: Okay. What happened?",
        "Wyatt: Well, I was packing up Stephanie's jewelry. She comes in and she tells me how bad I am for you and that she's gonna put a stop to us.",
        "Hope: Are you serious?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Yeah, it was pretty crazy. And then she tried to fire me.",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Wyatt: Yep.",
        "Hope: I'm -- she tried to fire you?",
        "Wyatt: Yep. Right after she slapped me.",
        "Hope: [Gasps] Wyatt, she hit you?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I swear. Right here.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God, Babe.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I'm fine. It doesn't hurt anymore. It's okay. But, I mean... who does that? Who slaps somebody for no reason? I mean, she was --",
        "Hope: I don't know. She has crossed so many lines.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, she's lost it, Hope. Eyes bulging. She was aggressive and territorial, forbidding me never to touch you again.",
        "Hope: I'm so sorry. I mean, that's -- that's not like her at all. I mean, I saw how upset she got when we were kissing, but... to attack you -- that's -- that's not her. She's usually so sweet and so quiet.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Shadow girl. I mean, little miss innocent definitely has some anger-management issues. Lucky for you, she's quite fond of you -- borderline obsessed, really -- but obviously, she has some serious problems with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I wanted to be at your wedding so badly. But Dad thought it'd be best for me to come to Paris.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure he just wanted to spend some time with you.",
        "Aly: Well, I can't complain much. Paris is pretty awesome.",
        "Brooke: Oh, it's one of my favorite cities. So, did you meet anybody? Any friends your age?",
        "Aly: Oh. No. Mostly, I just hang out with Dad. I, um -- [Clears throat] I don't really get along with people my age.",
        "Brooke: Oh.",
        "Aly: Anyway... do you mind if I ask, what exactly happened at your wedding?",
        "Brooke: Carter was reading our vows. It was a poem, actually, and it was very beautiful, but I don't remember the name of it. And Katie, she just got lightheaded and she fainted in the middle of that.",
        "Aly: She passed out? Right there in front of everyone?",
        "Brooke: Yes, unfortunately. We were very concerned because of the problems she's had with her heart. But the ambulance came, they took her to the hospital, and, thank God, she got a clean bill of health.",
        "Aly: Wow. Glad she's okay. Bet she feels awful for ruining your wedding.",
        "Brooke: I hope not. Wasn't her fault that we had to postpone the ceremony.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Katie: I can't stop thinking about the wedding.",
        "Ridge: Well, you got to stop thinking about it. It's why we're out here -- clear our heads.",
        "Katie: I passed out on purpose. With my health issues, I knew everyone would be concerned. Just can't believe I did that.",
        "Ridge: Well, you did it.",
        "Katie: It was wrong.",
        "Ridge: Maybe in the grand scheme of things, it wasn't.",
        "Katie: Let's not kid ourselves. It was underhanded and dishonest.",
        "Ridge: And it's done. Why are you beating yourself up like that?",
        "Katie: Because I don't like feeling like this.",
        "Ridge: Like what?",
        "Katie: Guilty and ashamed.",
        "Ridge: I feel that, too. But this is about a lot more than that. You know it.",
        "Katie: You've been so great with Will. He loves spending time with you. Last time we were here at the park, he loved playing soccer.",
        "Ridge: And what about Bill? He doesn't like the park?",
        "Katie: Bill's a good father -- he is -- but he has his own unique parenting style. He's not the most patient.",
        "Ridge: I know, I know.",
        "Katie: I don't want to talk about Bill. He's in love with Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Well, would you want him to be here out of obligation to you and your family?",
        "Katie: No. But I also remember how devastated I was, and I don't want to inflict on anyone, especially not my sister.",
        "Ridge: What do you want?",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I like you, Aly. I respect you. You're a tenacious, opinionated young lady. But I have to say, I think you reacted too strongly in that meeting.",
        "Aly: Sorry, but I'm not a fan of Wyatt's, at all.",
        "Brooke: You made that very clear.",
        "Aly: You're Hope's mother. Don't let her get all caught up in him. He's not to be trusted. He and his mother are only out for themselves.",
        "Brooke: Wyatt and Quinn have been very good partners with Forrester Creations. Hope and watt are dating. Hope likes him. Wyatt likes her.",
        "Aly: But does he, though? Do you want to know what he said to me?",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Aly: I can't even... you were on the plane. Did she really let him --?",
        "Brooke: They're adults, Aly. They're in a committed relationship.",
        "Aly: It's so wrong. It destroys everything Hope and her line stand for.",
        "Brooke: It's none of our business. There's not much we can do about that. We can't judge.",
        "Aly: I don't want to know anything else, okay? Hope needs that press packet tonight. Should I leave it at the hotel front desk?",
        "Brooke: I think you should give it directly to her. I have a key card for her room, so in case she's out with Wyatt, just leave it right there.",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Brooke: Oh, Aly, I do appreciate you caring about my daughter. I know you mean well. It's just, she is a grown woman, and she can take care of herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I'm not going to make any excuses for her, but I guess...chalk it up to immaturity?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, I'd like to think that's all it is, but, frankly, the girl's got some serious issues.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that she got angry with you.",
        "Wyatt: Eh.",
        "Hope: I guess she just feels very strongly about her beliefs and ideals, which I can somewhat relate to.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but she takes it to a whole nother level.",
        "Hope: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Wyatt: The shadow girl thing? Fits perfectly. She's always there. She's always lurking.",
        "Hope: Yeah. She just needs to take a step back. Relax a little.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Do you know she called me \"Mr. Popular\"?",
        "Hope: [Laughs] Mr. Popular, huh?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and I'm not even that popular.",
        "Hope: I don't know. \"Mr. Popular\" -- I think it's got a really nice ring to it.",
        "Wyatt: That's funny.",
        "Hope: A little. It's a little funny.",
        "Wyatt: No, it's not. Let's stop talking about Aly, please? Because I don't want her to ruin our night.",
        "Hope: Okay. Do you want to, maybe, go out to eat, go get some steak and some pommes frites?",
        "Wyatt: Ooh.",
        "Hope: I just have to change out of...",
        "Wyatt: Or... we could just stay here.",
        "Hope: Oh?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Stay right here.",
        "Aly: Hope? You there? [Lock beeps] Hope? Hello?",
        "Hope: [Giggling]",
        "Aly: Hope?",
        "Hope: [Laughing]",
        "[Laughing continues]",
        "Aly: Hope? Aah! Oh, my God! Stop! Stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Katie: Ridge, I -- I can't think what I want. I don't know. I -- I look at these people in the park and they're enjoying a beautiful, carefree day, and couples are holding hands, and they're probably looking at us and they're thinking that we're a couple, but we're not. We can't be.",
        "Ridge: Why not?",
        "Katie: Because it's not right, and we can't pretend that it is. It's not real.",
        "Ridge: What isn't real about this?",
        "Katie: Everything.",
        "Ridge: Forget about the circumstances. Just look at us, here. How do you feel?",
        "Katie: I can't do that. I can't think about us here, together. I can't think about us as a couple. I can't think about us as a family. You have been everything to Brooke, so why are we here? Why isn't she here with you? Give me one good reason why I'm here and she's not?",
        "Ridge: You want one good reason?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Ridge: Because I love you, Katie."
