    ],
    "Recap": [
        "Steffy tells Ivy that her dad is talking to Liam right now. And she is not turning over her stocks in FC unless Liam is part of the deal. He calls and says he saw Ridge and now needs to talk to her at his place. She agrees. Aly comes into the house and wants to talk her shoe line but Rick blows it off that he needs his martini first and for her to fix it and champagne for Maya. When she does that he even criticizes that she shook it too much and made it watery. Ivy is concerned and tells Wyatt that Liam is with Steffy right now. Steffy asks Liam if he is ready to take over FC with her. She hopes that is why he called her. She waxes poetic about her hitting her head on the bathtub and fell in love with him and then they were married. She only left him when she lost their child; he would be better off with her away but it wasn't. Hope Logan did not appreciate what she had with him. But she felt like Hope would come to her senses and she had no right to fight for him. She practically handed him to her and then Hope left him. She confesses if he were with Hope right now and happy she would back off. But with Ivy she sees no problem staking her claim against someone he has known about 5 minutes. It can not be compared to what they shared and they can have that back. Every time he tries to object she shushes him and says this can all be theirs. Wyatt tells Ivy do not count herself out even tho Liam has history with Steffy. He started this to help Ivy work better at FC without Rick's tactics. Liam tells Steffy that it would feel so good to be with her again and he thinks they could make it work and for the company too, but there is Ivy and he is committed to her.",
        "Steffy says Ivy better appreciate what she has. Liam says he loves Steffy but Steffy adds that he loves Ivy more at the moment and she would expect no less. She says she will go back to Paris and watch from afar what Rick is doing at FC and him and Ivy. They hug. She tells him to be happy. She takes a deep breath and cries as she leaves. Aly shows Rick and Maya her line but he is not impressed and calls them discount. But he's willing to give it a try if she massages Maya's feet and lets the lead model walk in them. Ivy goes back to Liam's and asks if all is okay. He says he really wants to take over FC but he will have to find another way. He can not give up on them and accept Steffy's offer. Rick takes great joy in watching and giving orders to Aly to massage Maya's feet. Steffy stops in and tells Wyatt that she is leaving. Wyatt says he works close with Ivy and she has confided in him, so he is glad Liam is staying with her. Ivy tells Liam that she could not have blamed him as he and Steffy do have history and were married and were going to have a family together. He says there is no having it all if he does not have her. He quips that he prefers his women with an accent. He makes her feel comfortable with his kiss."

        "Steffy: My dad's talking to Liam right now.",
        "Ivy: Good.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. It's good for the company, for kicking Rick out. But you for... if my dad agrees with Liam's plan, you know what that means. Liam understands my terms. I am not handing over my stock, I am not working with him unless we are working together as a couple just like my grandparents did for so many years. Forrester has always been its best with a husband/wife team in the helm.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Steffy: Oh, hey, Liam.",
        "Liam: So...I just talked to your dad.",
        "Steffy: Yeah?",
        "Liam: Interesting -- interesting talk. Do you think you could meet up?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. When? Tonight?",
        "Liam: If you're available. My place?",
        "Steffy: I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I knew that would look great on you.",
        "Maya: Oh, [Chuckles] Rick. [Chuckles] What a day. This amazing gift from you, and even better, the gift of your father's support for us.",
        "Rick: Even better? Mine cost a lot more.",
        "Maya: You know what I mean.",
        "Rick: Having my dad back me, knowing that he's proud of my work -- probably one of the best days of my life.",
        "Maya: You really impressed me today.",
        "Rick: I hope so. Like I said, that necklace cost a lot.",
        "Maya: Uh-huh. I'm talking about the meeting -- the way you showed up in there and made amends. You really came off like a team player.",
        "Rick: Good. I hope I was convincing.",
        "Maya: You meant what you said in there, right?",
        "Rick: I meant every word. Really. Saying it in front of my father might have been slightly calculated, but, uh... in a good way. It's wise for me to show I'm capable of smoothing things out with my employees, showcasing my interpersonal-communication skills.",
        "Maya: Well, that's why you're C.E.O.",
        "Rick: And that's why I'm gonna stay C.E.O.",
        "Aly: Oh, hey. Hey, guys. I've, um -- I've got the -- the prototypes.",
        "Rick: What's that?",
        "Aly: My shoe line.",
        "Rick: Great.",
        "Aly: You -- you promised you'd take my line seriously.",
        "Rick: Definitely. I just -- [Chuckles] You know, it would be a lot easier if I had a martini in my hand.",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Rick: One olive, one onion.",
        "Aly: You want me to make it.",
        "Rick: That'd be a great idea. And Maya will have a-a glass of champagne.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: So, Rick approved the opal bracelet?",
        "Ivy: Hmm?",
        "Wyatt: The opal bracelet.",
        "Ivy: Oh, uh...",
        "Wyatt: Rick approved it?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Uh, I mean, he was -- he was critical of it, obviously, but he gave us the go-ahead.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, are you okay? We can finish this tomorrow.",
        "Ivy: Oh, no. I'm -- I'm totally fine. You know what? It's probably a good idea. I should just do this in the morning.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: You, uh -- you heading over to Liam's?",
        "Ivy: I-I -- yeah, maybe. I might. Maybe, um -- maybe a little bit later.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, Ivy, what's going on?",
        "Ivy: Liam is with Steffy right now. I'm just a little bit worried about what I might walk in on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Thanks for coming.",
        "Steffy: Of course. Is my dad gone?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: I spoke to him earlier. It seems like he's considering your plan.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that's -- [Chuckles] Uh, that's why he was here.",
        "Steffy: He understands my conditions, how I can't back this idea unless we make a go of it. So...is that why you called me? Are you ready to take over Forrester Creations?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Champagne.",
        "Maya: Yes, thank you, honey.",
        "Aly: And your martini.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Aly: Okay, so the first ones I'm showing you are one of my favorites. Look, I know what you're thinking, and the pattern is a little --",
        "Rick: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Hold on. How many times did you shake this?",
        "Aly: I-I don't know. 15, 20.",
        "Rick: Thorne never taught you? You're supposed to shake it exactly 10 times. More than 10, it's too watery. Less than that, it's just not cold enough.",
        "Aly: Okay, I-I apologize. So, can we look at the shoes now, or...?",
        "Maya: Yes. Let's see the shoes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: So, Steffy's been pining away for Liam all this time?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Apparently she's just been patiently waiting for him to get over Hope.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but you're the one who helped him do that. She can't just swoop in last second like this.",
        "Ivy: Well, she seems to think that she can because she has exactly what Liam wants -- shares in Forrester.",
        "Wyatt: So, you're saying the only way we're gonna pull off this takeover --",
        "Ivy: Is if Liam leaves me and gets back together with Steffy. Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, she's crafty.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Well, Liam has a big decision to make. He could have this entire company and his ex-wife back. Seems like a lot to walk away from.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You know we can do it -- be in charge of the company, husband and wife. Just think about the legacy we'd be creating. Spencer Publications, Forrester Creations -- both under our leadership.",
        "Liam: Yeah, sure, but only if we're together. Only if we're...a couple.",
        "Steffy: It's the way -- it's the way it's supposed to be. Liam, think about everything that we've been through. You know, the moment you pulled me out of that bathtub, I knew. A marriage, a baby -- that was all ahead. There was no question that you were my future.",
        "Liam: But you left. You left.",
        "Steffy: I left for you. I was scared. I-I didn't know what to do. That -- this is all my fault. You know, that stupid motorcycle, thinking that I'd never be able to give you a child... I couldn't handle it. I told myself that -- that you'd be better off, that if I stayed away, everything would be okay, but it wasn't. You know, Hope -- typical Logan. She couldn't even appreciate what she had with you. I was in Paris. I heard all the things that she put you through. With your own brother? You know, as much as I wanted to come back, I felt like I couldn't. I felt like I-I didn't deserve to fight for you. I thought Hope would just come to her senses.",
        "Liam: I-it's -- it's complicated, Steffy. I mean, Wyatt's mother really messed things up for us.",
        "Steffy: I know, I know. And I know this isn't entirely Hope's fault, but it doesn't matter. She's not here. But I handed you to her. I practically put your hand in hers, and she left you. I'm just gonna be honest here, okay? I'm just gonna be completely honest. If you were with Hope right now and you were married and happy, I wouldn't be fighting for our life back. But knowing that you're -- you're with Ivy. You've known her a few seconds. I'm sorry, but I do not feel guilty coming home and staking my claim, because you know what? I still consider this my home.",
        "Liam: Well, you should. You should, 'cause there's a lot of memories here.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: And you're right. I haven't known Ivy long. But that doesn't mean my commitment to her is meaningless.",
        "Steffy: And I get that. I know you have feelings for her. But you can't compare it to what we shared. You know we can have it back -- work and the family. We can pick up where we left off.",
        "Liam: Ivy is very important to --",
        "Steffy: Could you just stop? Shh. Stop.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Steffy: Forrester is ours if we do this together. It's totally and completely ours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I don't see Liam choosing Steffy.",
        "Ivy: Neither do I. But I have to be realistic, Wyatt. They have a history together -- eons if you listen to her.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. History. In the past. But Liam is the kind of guy who looks toward the future. And let's not forget why he started this little passion project in the first place. It was to protect you and Caroline, the Spencer women. And, yes, that is exactly how he referred to you, so... don't count yourself out.",
        "Ivy: I won't.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. You going to see Liam?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Yep. Wish me luck.",
        "Wyatt: You don't need it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Just the idea of running Forrester Creations with you --",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm. Kicking Rick to the curb?",
        "Liam: Oh, God. How good would that feel? Really.",
        "Steffy: All you have to do is say yes.",
        "Liam: Yeah, it sure would be something, wouldn't it -- working side by side with you every day? The woman I loved so deeply. You know how much you mean to me, right? You know how grateful I would be to run this company with you. You're one of the smartest people I've ever met, Steffy. Put you in charge and, damn, what you could do with that company.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: And then to live with you on top of it, to be your husband, to touch you again... it would be really, really good. And I think we would make it work this time.",
        "Steffy: We would. No question. We would.",
        "Liam: But.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Ivy. You are really that committed to her.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, I am.",
        "Steffy: Wow, you are always a man of your word.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: She better appreciate what she has in you.",
        "Liam: I love you, you know?",
        "Steffy: I know you love me. You just love someone a little bit more.",
        "Liam: That's not why I'm saying that.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] It's okay. Ugh. I don't blame you for giving this kangaroo a shot after all I've done. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Hey, you better watch out. Kangaroos are tough if you've ever seen them fight.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] Oh, believe me, I know.",
        "Liam: So, what happens now?",
        "Steffy: Well... I go back to Paris, and I watch from afar -- what Rick's doing at the company, what you're doing with Ivy. I watch and I wait. Be happy.",
        "Liam: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Steffy: [Breathing shakily]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Take a look at this one. Now, I made a few modifications from my original design, but I kept the element of the heel, which I thought --",
        "Rick: You know, I-I don't know, Aly. These designs -- they're just so...uh, discount. I don't know.",
        "Maya: Uh, well, maybe if you saw them in action. You should put them on.",
        "Aly: Not me. You. I mean, after all, you're Forrester's lead model.",
        "Maya: Oh, no, no, no. You know, I've been in heels all day. My feet are tired. You should model them.",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I don't know. I think I'm gonna need to see them on the lead model. Aly, why don't you give her feet a rub?",
        "Aly: [Chuckles] Excuse me?",
        "Rick: Don't be shy. After a little massage, Maya might actually be able to give those shoes a go.",
        "Maya: I don't think that is necessary.",
        "Rick: Sweetheart, you've been on your feet all day. It's the least Aly could do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You're back.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Is, uh -- is that all right?",
        "Liam: Are you kidding me? You're always welcome here. Come in.",
        "Ivy: I just wasn't sure if you were -- if you had company or not.",
        "Liam: Ah, yeah. Uh, don't worry. Steffy's not in a bikini ready to pounce like last time you walked in. Though she was here.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I know. I was with her when you called, actually.",
        "Liam: Mm.",
        "Ivy: She seemed pretty pleased to hear from you. She said that her dad was here, probably stating a good case as to why you should give her what she wants.",
        "Liam: He was. Yeah.",
        "Ivy: So then you call her straight away and you ask her over?",
        "Liam: Uh, listen, Ivy, um... I really want to take over Forrester Creations.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: But it's not gonna happen right now. I'll find another way, I'm sure, but, um...using Steffy's shares is not an option, especially if it means giving up on us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Okay! I think that's great. I'm ready to try on those shoes.",
        "Rick: That was just the left one. Rub her right foot, will you?",
        "Aly: It's okay. [Chuckles] It's fine. How's that? Too -- too hard?",
        "Maya: Oh, no. That's -- that's great.",
        "Aly: You'll like how these shoes feel, and -- and Rick, you'll -- you'll really love how they look.",
        "Rick: On Maya? No doubt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't realize anyone was in here.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, no. No, no, no. I was just...packing up. Hopefully the head honcho will be pleased with the sales report for Ivy's line.",
        "Steffy: I'm sure he will be. Everyone seems pleased with Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Including Liam?",
        "Steffy: Most of all.",
        "Wyatt: So, he's staying with her, I take it? Look, I work closely with Ivy, and she kind of confided in me, so...",
        "Steffy: He's staying with her. For now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Oh, Liam. I'm not gonna lie. I am so relieved.",
        "Liam: Really?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: I-I mean, you didn't think... 'cause we talked about this.",
        "Ivy: Well... yeah, and I wasn't worried, it's just that Steffy's so confident in herself. I-I tried to reason with her at the office. I mean, how immature to only give up her shares if you take her back. I mean, is that what she -- is that what she wanted? Is that what she thought was gonna happen?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Well, like you said, she's confident.",
        "Ivy: And then I tried to persuade her, and she just kept defending herself. But you know what? The more she kept talking, the more it started to make sense. You two do have such a big history. And -- and this -- we're so new. I don't really know how that compares. And then she told me that Ridge was here, so he was clearly on board with the plan. And then I started thinking, \"well, okay. Then this is it.\" You'll get Ridge and Steffy's shares. I mean, it's not like going back with Steffy is a sacrifice. You've been married to her before. You were expecting a child together. And she's ridiculously beautiful. I mean, what man on the planet wouldn't want a chance with her?",
        "Liam: A man in love with someone else.",
        "Ivy: Liam, you could have it all.",
        "Liam: You know what I've discovered about myself recently, Ivy? I prefer my beauty with an accent.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Listen, I want control of Forrester Creations. I want it bad. I want it for Caroline. I want it for you. But...I don't know. Having it all -- there is no \"having it all\" if I don't have you."
