        "Ridge sits with Katie in the park and says she asked him for one good reason. He meant it \u0096 he loves her. No one wants anybody to be hurt but Hope got Brooke out of town so they have time to work on it. Brooke tells Thorne that Aly was a little agitated over her concern for Hope. Thorne says as long as she is under control and she's not as negative as she was at the meeting. Is she still against Wyatt? Brooke says she explained that Hope is an adult and her choices are her own, not their business. She tells Thorne that she gave Aly the hotel key card and she is going to drop off a press package to Hope and leave. But Aly bursts into Hope's room and yells at her and Wyatt. She keeps telling him to get off of Hope and get out of here right now. Liam would never treat her like this. Hope tells her to calm down; everyone is all right. She puts her robe on and tries to quiet Aly by steering her into the living room and let Wyatt stay in the bedroom. Aly is agitated and keeps saying she can not believe this; Wyatt was in her bed. Hope says he is in her room because he was invited. He is her boyfriend now. Aly says Wyatt wants everyone to know. He does not respect Hope. Hope tells Aly that she has no idea where this is coming from, but she can not barge in here and start screaming. It's inappropriate. Aly says she is trying to help Hope. Hope tells her that she doesn't need to; everything is fine. And if she has problems with Wyatt then she needs to get over it. Aly is shocked and asks if this is how she wants people to see her now like all the other internet celebrities half naked, raunchy and vulgar. She has to think about how this looks. She's supposed to be an example. She believes in her message. She started a HFTF club in her school. People called her a nerd, but she thought it was important. Now it seems it doesn't matter to Hope anymore. Hope says yes it does matter but the focus on the line has changed some. Aly says it is Hope that had changed and all because of Wyatt. He and his mother are not trustworthy; they will do whatever they can to get what they want. They ruined Liam's life and they will ruin Hope's too. They don't care what they have to do or how low they have to stoop.",
        "Wyatt has put his clothes on and is listening on the other side of the door slightly ajar. Hope tells Aly that she knows she wants to protect her image. And she knows Aly has gotten closer to Liam so she may want Hope with him. Aly says or just alone, but anybody but Wyatt. He is no good for her. He's a liar. Hope wants her to take that back. Aly says he is a liar and if Hope denies it then she is a liar too. She says Hope does not deceive people. She lifts them up and inspires them. She told them to wait for a ring and be sure you are in a committed relationship. Hope explains that she still believes that. Her values have not changed and she is not promoting promiscuity. She tells Aly that Aly told her she was bullied in high school and that must have hurt and she is sorry. But that is sort of how Hope is feeling with Aly standing there and saying all those things against her and Wyatt. Aly shouts that Wyatt is the bully, not her. Hope says Wyatt is the man she has chosen to be with. Aly says only because his mother tricked her. Hope says no; she is with Wyatt because she loves him. They are not engaged but it is serious. Aly refuses to see. She says Hope loves Liam; she always has and they would be married right now if not for Quinn. She doesn't see why Hope can not see that. Hope says they did not manipulate her. She was the one who decided she was not ready for marriage. She and Wyatt are dating. They are enjoying their time together; that's it. Aly continues that Wyatt is mean. He's disrespectful to Liam and a smart aleck to Aly. She doesn't like him. Hope tells her that she is sorry she feels that way. She hopes in time once Aly knows Wyatt that she will change her opinion of him. In the meantime she thinks Aly should leave. Thorne asks about Katie and Brooke says she is fine. No more fainting spells. And one more minute that day and Brooke would have been married. So that was disappointing. She has spoken to Ridge and he wants her to come home. And while Hope keeps saying she wants her here in Paris she can not find out one good reason why. Thorne tells her that Wyatt seems to have everything under control over promotions so Brooke can just go home and plan another wedding. He'll explain to Hope. Outside Hope's room, Aly gets her phone with app and pulls up Wyatt's pictures, hits a button and his head is in flames ..her with a smirking look on her face. Wyatt asks Hope is she is alone. She says yes, Aly left. He reminds her where they were before interrupted. They kiss and he backs her to the bed. Ridge and Katie listen to some musicians in the park and even dance a little. They sit on a bench and Ridge kisses her."

        "Katie: Please don't say that.",
        "Ridge: Well, you asked me to give you one good reason. I can't think of a better one. I do. I love you, Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: This could be serious.",
        "Thorne: If it gets out of control. But you think Aly seemed better today?",
        "Brooke: She was a little agitated. She was concerned for Hope.",
        "Thorne: She wasn't as negative as she was in the meeting?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Thorne: What about when Wyatt's name came up?",
        "Brooke: I told her that Hope is an adult and Aly doesn't have to like her choices 'cause they are Hope's to make.",
        "Thorne: How did that go over?",
        "Brooke: Uh...I'm not sure. I mean, she didn't fight me on it.",
        "Thorne: Thank you, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Well, I'm not sure if I got through to her or not.",
        "Thorne: Well, I'll check on her -- see how she's doing.",
        "Brooke: She's not here. She's gonna take a press packet over to Hope's hotel.",
        "Thorne: Hope's not coming in today?",
        "Brooke: No. Hope and Wyatt planned some sightseeing. So, I gave the suite key to Aly, and she's gonna just drop off the packet and then leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: What are you doing?! Get off of her!",
        "Hope: Aly!",
        "Aly: I told you to leave her alone!",
        "Wyatt: You need to leave right now, Aly!",
        "Aly: No, you need to leave right now! Get out of here!",
        "Hope: Aly, Aly, calm down. What is going on?",
        "Aly: Why are you telling me to calm down?! What is he doing?!",
        "Hope: It's okay! It's fine!",
        "Aly: You need to get out of here right now!",
        "Wyatt: Aly. Aly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: What is your feeling about Wyatt?",
        "Brooke: I like him.",
        "Thorne: More than Liam?",
        "Brooke: I like him, too, but his relationship with Hope just got too complicated. Wyatt isn't pushing for marriage. They're not living together. They're just dating.",
        "Thorne: And traveling around the world together.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, and that's good for her. She's just enjoying herself -- no stress, no pressure, no big questions to answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Hope, why?! Why?! I told you not to trust him! I tried to warn you! You need to get out of here right now!",
        "Wyatt: I need to get out of here?! You need to get out of here, Aly!",
        "Hope: Everything's fine. Aly, it's okay. I'm -- I'm here. It's all right.",
        "Wyatt: What do you think I did to her? Geez!",
        "Hope: Okay, let's go into the other room.",
        "Wyatt: Hope, I don't think it's a good idea.",
        "Aly: Don't you tell her what to do!",
        "Hope: It's fine!",
        "Aly: You see how he treats you -- like you can't think for yourself? Liam would never do that.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!",
        "Hope: Wyatt, you need to stay right here, and we are gonna go into the other room and talk. Okay?",
        "Wyatt: [Stammers]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You're not making this easy.",
        "Ridge: I'm not gonna lie to you. Hope took Brooke out of town so we can look at this.",
        "Katie: Hope doesn't want her mother to be hurt, and neither do I.",
        "Ridge: No one wants that. We got to figure this out. You know how I feel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I can't believe it, Hope. I just -- I can't -- I can't believe it.",
        "Hope: Aly, Wyatt is in my room because he was invited.",
        "Aly: He was in your bed.",
        "Hope: Because he's my boyfriend, and -- and the things that we do in private are between us.",
        "Aly: People will know, Hope. He wants them to know. If you heard the way he talks about you -- he doesn't respect you.",
        "Hope: Aly, I have no idea where this is coming from! But, honestly, it's inappropriate. You cannot just barge in here and start screaming at us.",
        "Aly: I am trying to help you.",
        "Hope: Okay, but you don't need to. I'm fine. Everything is fine. And whatever problems that you have with Wyatt, you need to get over it.",
        "Aly: Is this how you want people to see you now -- like all those other celebrities on the internet, being half-naked, raunchy, and vulgar?",
        "Hope: Excuse me?",
        "Aly: I'm sorry. It's not you. I-I know that. But you have to think about how this looks.",
        "Hope: Aly, Wyatt and I are adults.",
        "Aly: You're supposed to be an example. Look, I started the Hope for the Future club at school. Do you know that? And people called me a nerd for it. But I didn't mind because I believe in your message. I thought it was important.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Aly: Doesn't any of that matter anymore?",
        "Hope: Of course it matters. But I tried to explain to you in the meeting that the line's focus has changed.",
        "Aly: You've changed -- because of him. He's not honest, Hope. Wyatt and his mother are not trustworthy people. They will do whatever it takes to get what they want. They don't care who they have to use or how low they have to stoop. Just look at what they did to Liam. They ruined his life. And if you don't get away from them, they'll ruin yours, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: How's Katie doing?",
        "Brooke: She's all right, thank God.",
        "Thorne: No more fainting spells?",
        "Brooke: No. The doctor said she's fine.",
        "Thorne: Well, it still must have been scary.",
        "Brooke: It was.",
        "Thorne: And disappointing not being able to finish the ceremony.",
        "Brooke: Another minute and we would have.",
        "Thorne: Yeah? You were that close, huh?",
        "Brooke: I already said, \"I do,\" and Ridge was about to, and then, suddenly, getting married was the last thing on my mind. Katie was laying there on the floor. The ambulance took her to the hospital. It was terrifying, really. I didn't want to lose her -- especially now, since we're really starting to repair our relationship.",
        "Thorne: And she agreed to stand up for you.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I wouldn't take no for an answer.",
        "Thorne: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: And we really are getting closer, especially now that I'm back with Ridge.",
        "Thorne: He should have come with you, Brooke. I mean, there's no more romantic place than Paris for a wedding.",
        "Brooke: I know, but he's taking care of Katie.",
        "Thorne: I thought you said she was fine.",
        "Brooke: I didn't want her and Will to be alone. I'm happy that Ridge is with them.",

        "[Children shouting playfully]",
        "Katie: Do you hear that? It's over there.",
        "[Music continues]",
        "Ridge: Let's go.",
        "Katie: It's great. It's like a treat -- all music.",
        "Ridge: It's nice.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: How cool are these guys playing here?",
        "[Music continues]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Aly, I understand that you want to protect my image and me.",
        "Aly: It's not an image. It's who you are, isn't it?",
        "Hope: You and Liam -- you two have gotten really close. Is it because you want me to be with him?",
        "Aly: Or be on your own. Be single if you don't want to get married. Just please, please don't be with Wyatt. He's no good for you.",
        "Hope: I think he is good for me.",
        "Aly: He's a liar!",
        "Hope: Wow. I think that's really unfair, and I want you to take it back.",
        "Aly: Why should I? It's true. And if you deny it, then you're a liar, too. But I know you're not.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Aly: You don't deceive people.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Aly: You lift them up. You inspire them. You inspired me. Wait for a ring. Be sure you're in a committed relationship first. That's what you said.",
        "Hope: And I still believe that. I do. I am not promoting promiscuity, Aly. My values have not changed. I do think that young women should respect themselves, and I also think that they should respect each other. Aly... you told me that in high school, you were bullied and you were called names. That must have hurt, and I'm really, really sorry. But how do you think I feel, standing here listening to you say these things about Wyatt and me?",
        "Aly: Wyatt's the bully, not me!",
        "Hope: Wyatt is the man that I've chosen to be with.",
        "Aly: Because he and his mother tricked you!",
        "Hope: No! I'm with him because I love him, Aly. We're not engaged, but, yes, it is serious.",
        "Aly: No. No. You love Liam. You always have. And if it weren't for Quinn and Wyatt, you would be married right now. They've set him up. They've been manipulating everything. Why can't you see it?",
        "Hope: Not me. They didn't manipulate me. I decided that it was time for a change. I'm the one who decided that I wasn't ready for marriage. Wyatt and I are dating. We're enjoying our time together. That's it.",
        "Aly: He is mean, Hope. He's disrespectful to Liam. He was a smart aleck to me.",
        "Hope: I'll give you that one. Wyatt can be very sarcastic, but he's working on it.",
        "Aly: I don't like him.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry that you feel that way. I am. And I'm hoping that, in time, once you get to know him, you'll change your opinion about him. But for now... I think it's best if you leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I spoke to Ridge earlier, and I told him I was ready to come home.",
        "Thorne: Hmm. Yeah, but Hope wants you here.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Nobody can do more for Hope than Wyatt can.",
        "Thorne: [Chuckles] Yeah, he's quite the salesman.",
        "Brooke: He feels very passionately about her line. And now that he's here with her, I don't think she needs my help with promotion.",
        "Thorne: So go home and get married already.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] I'll discuss it with Hope.",
        "Thorne: She'll understand. If you want to leave right now, I can fill her in.",
        "Brooke: No!",
        "Thorne: You know you want to.",
        "Brooke: [Laughing] Yes, I do! Ridge and I should be on our honeymoon right now. I want to be with my husband.",
        "Thorne: So, call the pilot and file a flight plan.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I just don't know what Hope has planned -- interviews, meetings.",
        "Thorne: She and Wyatt can handle them, okay? You and Ridge have a wedding to finish.",
        "Brooke: Ridge could pick me up from the airport.",
        "Thorne: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: And we could go down to the courthouse...",
        "Thorne: Mm-hmm. An \"I do,\" a few signatures, and -- voil\u00e0 -- you're my sister- in-law...again.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Brooke: I'm not making it sound very romantic, am I?",
        "Thorne: Save the romance for the honeymoon, okay? You and Ridge just need to do this.",
