        "Brooke opens the door to Deacon. He says they need to talk about what happened. He asks if she remembers the kiss. She says yes, she does not black out when she drinks. She knows he kissed her and she did not pull away because it happened so quickly and with no notice. Deacon tells Brooke that she will always have a little piece of his heart but he's with Quinn now. He is committed to her. Brooke says he really needs to be telling this to Quinn as she seems a little insecure right now. She tells him about the slap. She warns Deacon that he better think long and hard before he gets in too deep with Quinn and her craziness. Wyatt goes to Quinn's at her request. She says she needed him as she needed to talk to someone who knows how she is wired. Pointblank he asks what did she do now. He's appalled when she admits she slapped Brooke. She rants that she was upset. Deacon had driven Brooke home and before you know it she was parading around in her bathing suit, yet she did not want a swim party. Everybody knows she is a man predator and she wanted him in her bed. He quips then she must have been defending poor helpless Deacon's honor. She fires back that Brooke already stole Bill away from her and she was not going to let her do the same with Deacon. She admits the slap went a little too far and she is only afraid what will happen when Deacon finds out. Wyatt says she won't have to tell him as Brooke will be only too happy to do that. Quinn bellows at Wyatt to stop yelling at her. She knows she has some anger control problems but she is working on that. And this was only one incident. Wyatt says good; he only hopes her boyfriend sees it that way.",
        "Liam and Ivy lay in bed. He wakes her with a kiss and she says she likes waking up with him. Steffy stops by Ridge's loft and he says she can not go back to Paris as she just got there. She muses that if there was anything about their recent history with Liam she never would have left, but it's ancient history now. The world doesn't stop when you need time out and she lost something important. She tells Ridge there is not going to be a takeover now so there is no reason for her to stay in L.A. She is not going to sit around and watch Liam fall deeper in love with Ivy. She did that once before and that won't happen again. She changes the subject and asks what is he doing. Is Caroline a mid-life crisis or infatuation. He tries to explain that it is much more than that. Steffy tells him it is inappropriate as Caroline is her age. He counters that Caroline is a grown woman and just like Steffy she makes grown up decisions. He says he is sorry that his relationship upsets her but there is nothing he can do about that. At that moment Caroline lets herself in. she is civil; Steffy is frosty. Ridge tells her that he is not going to defend his relationship and neither is Caroline. He would hope that Steffy wanted her dad to be happy and she finally admits that she does. She gives him a quick semi hug and leaves. Deacon goes home and asks Quinn what the hell did she do. Quinn says sounds like Brooke wasted no time in ratting her out. Deacon barks that for heaven's sake, she barged in Brooke's house and knocked her to the ground. She is lucky that Brooke didn't call the police and have her arrested for assault. He wants to know when the craziness between her ears and being normal kicks in. Quinn defends by saying Brooke thinks she can have anything she wants and she wanted her to know that he was off limits. He states again that she is beautiful and talented and sexy as hell. And he is living with her so all of this is unnecessary. She doesn't have to be this insecure to go around decking people. Hope and her mother are very important to him and they do not deserve Quinn wrecking havoc in their lives. She hollers back that he is right. She is a terrible person, a nutcase and he should just get out right now. He can save himself future embarrassment by leaving now and never coming back. But when she looks around he has a ring box in his hand. He says she is nuts and she drives him nuts but he wants to marry her."

        "Quinn: You stay away from him! You stay away from Deacon. Do you hear me?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Brooke: You're back.",
        "Deacon: We need to talk about what happened.",
        "Quinn: Thank you for coming.",
        "Wyatt: You said you needed me.",
        "Quinn: I had to talk to somebody who knows how I'm wired.",
        "Wyatt: What'd you do now, mom?",
        "[Seagulls crying]",
        "Liam: Hi.",
        "Ivy: Never gets old waking up with you.",
        "Liam: I really like watching you sleep.",
        "Ivy: That's kind of creepy.",
        "Liam: Shut up.",
        "Ivy: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Your drool is creepy.",
        "Ivy: I don't drool! Do I drool?",
        "Liam: [Laughs] No. You're beautiful awake or asleep.",
        "Ivy: Hmm. You know, I've never been the sort of person who could just lie in bed all day.",
        "Liam: Hmm.",
        "Ivy: But I could see myself burrowing myself here with you for the foreseeable future.",
        "Liam: We could try, see if anyone misses us.",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah. I wish.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] We're probably good for a little while anyway.",
        "Ivy: Good. I'll take it. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: It's funny how things have a way of working out.",
        "Ivy: Liam, I'll never take you for granted. I know that... I know that a lot of other women want you. I mean, you could have just picked up right where you left off with Steffy. You could have taken over Forrester. You could have had everything with her.",
        "Liam: Yeah. The thing about everything... kind of feels like nothing if it means losing you.",
        "Ridge: What do you mean, you're going back to paris? You just got here.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Feels like a lifetime went by. In a way, it actually did.",
        "Ridge: So all this about Liam?",
        "Steffy: You know I love him. And if I could change one thing about our recent history... I never would have left him.",
        "Ridge: Well, we know why you did. You needed time. You needed space to heal.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but when you take it, you risk losing what's important. The world doesn't stop just because you need time out. Look, I know I was gonna ask you to throw in with Liam and me, but, um... we're not gonna do the takeover. So there's really no other reason for me to be here. So I'm gonna go.",
        "Ridge: Come here.",
        "Steffy: Dad.",
        "Ridge: It's okay.",
        "Steffy: I know.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] All right. Let's hear it.",
        "Quinn: Well, you -- you know how I-I sort of went over to Brooke's?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Quinn: Well, I had to set her straight.",
        "Wyatt: What did you do this time, mom?",
        "Quinn: I slapped her.",
        "Wyatt: You...what?",
        "Brooke: Would you like some coffee?",
        "Deacon: Uh, no. No thanks.",
        "Brooke: I don't know why I made such a big pot. One-cup brewers are so convenient. 30 seconds, and presto, you have a perfect --",
        "Deacon: Brooke, you want to talk about coffee?",
        "Brooke: Well, we could talk about the finer points of wine.",
        "Deacon: Oh, I'm sure we can, because you're becoming quite the expert, aren't you? I mean, you had more than a few at Il Giardino. Do you remember what happened?",
        "Brooke: I don't black out when I drink, Deacon.",
        "Deacon: So you remember we kissed?",
        "Brooke: I remember you kissed me.",
        "Ivy: So, the Forrester takeover is kind of a dead issue, then.",
        "Liam: No. I wouldn't call it that.",
        "Ivy: Well, Steffy seems pretty adamant. I mean, she won't throw in unless you two are lovers. Which, by the way, it's just blackmail, Liam. I mean, who does that?",
        "Liam: That's -- well, that's classic Steffy. Get what you want by whatever means necessary. Eventually, the other party will begin to think it was their idea.",
        "Ivy: How does that manipulation not bother you?",
        "Liam: It's -- it's more that I understand why she thinks it's necessary. I mean, under the whole sophisticated, worldly exterior, Steffy's -- she's got some regrets and some insecurities.",
        "Ivy: Okay, interesting.",
        "Liam: And she's self-aware, which -- which makes her a lot easier to reason with, given enough time. That's the secret with Steffy. You just have to give her time to adjust to whatever the new reality is, and then once she does, she's more open.",
        "Ivy: Okay, so you're not giving up?",
        "Liam: No. No. No way. Um, takeover's happening. I'm just not putting you into play over it.",
        "Ivy: Hmm. You know, speaking of play...",
        "Liam: Yes. [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: I won't torture myself watching Liam fall deeper in love with Ivy. I sat front row before. I'm not gonna do it again.",
        "Ridge: I get it.",
        "Steffy: It's a nice vibe in here.",
        "Ridge: I think so.",
        "Steffy: I see you've been painting. Caroline, I'm assuming? Nude?",
        "Ridge: To be fair, she is artfully draped.",
        "Steffy: What are you dealing with here, dad? Midlife crisis? Infatuation?",
        "Ridge: It's more than that. Much more.",
        "Wyatt: So what you're trying to say to me is, is you barged into Brooke's home, you chewed her out, and then you slapped her?!",
        "Quinn: I was upset!",
        "Wyatt: Yeah!",
        "Quinn: You heard what Deacon said! He went to Il Giardino. She was drunk. He drove her home. And before he knew what hit him, she was parading around in her bathing suit, busting out her moves!",
        "Wyatt: That is not what he said.",
        "Quinn: Everybody knows that Brooke is a man predator. She did not want to have a swim party with him. She wanted him in her bed!",
        "Wyatt: Oh, so you were protecting poor, defenseless Deacon's honor, then?",
        "Quinn: I was protecting my relationship! She already stole bill away from me! I wasn't gonna let her do the same thing with Deacon.",
        "Wyatt: Mom --",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on! You don't even have to say it, okay? The slap...went a bit too far.",
        "Wyatt: Yes! It did!",
        "Quinn: I'm just worried what's gonna happen when -- when Deacon finds out.",
        "Wyatt: You haven't told Deacon?",
        "Quinn: Not yet.",
        "Wyatt: Great. You probably won't have to. Because guaranteed, Brooke will be happy to do it for you.",
        "Deacon: All right, can we agree that I initiated the kiss but you participated?",
        "Brooke: I didn't pull away because you caught me by surprise.",
        "Deacon: I think we remember it a little differently.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] So, what's new, right? Okay, you came here to talk about something. What about the kiss?",
        "Deacon: You dazzle me. You always have. You know that. I mean, you -- you represent the ideal woman to me. Always out of my reach except for that one shiny moment, and I have tried so hard to recapture that. And I can't because it's not what you want. You don't feel the same way. And you shut the door. And I found Quinn. I'm committed to her. She took me in. She understands me. So as far as the kiss goes, I... I think you're always gonna have a little piece of my heart. I don't think that's ever gonna change, but I... [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: But you're with Quinn now. And you want me to understand that.",
        "Deacon: Yes.",
        "Brooke: I think you should be having this conversation with her. I think she's feeling a little insecure right now.",
        "Deacon: What -- what does that mean?",
        "Brooke: You've hooked up with a whackjob, Deacon. Quinn came over here and she slapped me.",
        "Wyatt: So, where's Deacon",
        "Wyatt: So, where's Deacon right now?",
        "Quinn: I don't know. You don't think he went to Brooke's, do you?",
        "Wyatt: Not necessarily. But he could run into her. That's how this whole thing started in the first place, right?",
        "Quinn: Well, she would have nothing to tell him because I already apologized.",
        "Wyatt: Mom! You slapped Brooke in her own home! She already doesn't like you! She thinks you ruined her daughter's life! So she has no reason to protect you but every reason to blow up what eensy-beensy, tiny, little piece of happiness that you may have already. I'm sorry. It's just not gonna cut it. You shouldn't have been there in the first place!",
        "Quinn: Okay! All right! Stop yelling at me! You know I have poor impulse control, but I am working on it!",
        "Wyatt: Good for you!",
        "Quinn: It was one incident!",
        "Wyatt: You know what? You better hope your boyfriend sees it that way.",
        "Quinn: [Groans]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Deacon: Quinn slapped you?",
        "Brooke: Right here.",
        "Deacon: What happened?",
        "Brooke: A little while after you left, the doorbell rang, and imagine my surprise when I answered it and Quinn was standing there. She came in, and I asked her what she was doing here, and she said, \"don't play dumb with me.\" And then she hauled off and slapped me.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: Your girl packs quite a wallop. I fell right to the floor.",
        "Deacon: I-I-I can't believe this.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, it's true. And then she told me to stay away from you.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: What's strange, though, is I thought she was gonna hit me again, but she ended up apologizing. And it made the whole thing even more creepy. You know what, Deacon? You're a romantic at heart. I know because I've been on the receiving end. Most people don't know that about you. But you idealize women, the women you're involved with, and you're doing that now with Quinn. I'd be careful, if I were you. You don't know the amount of her craziness. You really need to understand the woman that you're getting involved with before you're in too deep and you can't get out.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ridge: I know you don't approve of my relationship with Caroline.",
        "Steffy: It's inappropriate! My God!",
        "Ridge: I'm not even sure what that means.",
        "Steffy: She's my age, dad!",
        "Ridge: I know how old she is! She's a grown woman, and just like you, she makes grown-up decisions!",
        "Steffy: Look, I'm sorry. It just bothers me that you're involved with someone my age. W-what? Is -- is she married to Rick? Is she not married to Rick?",
        "Ridge: I heard you! And I accept it. And I'm sorry that my relationship makes you feel uncomfortable, but I don't know what to do about it.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Caroline: Hey, babe, are you here?",
        "Steffy: Hello, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: I can come back. I'll just --",
        "Steffy: Not on my account.",
        "Ridge: Come on in. Hi.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Deacon: What the hell's wrong with you?",
        "Liam: I come bearing breakfast.",
        "Ivy: [Gasps] You didn't have to do that.",
        "Liam: No, it's my pleasure.",
        "Ivy: Yum. I could get used to this. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Well, that's the idea. I want this one.",
        "Ivy: It's all yours.",
        "Liam: Actually, no, I want you to have this one.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Open up. It's a big one.",
        "Ivy: I know.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] A united front?",
        "Ridge: Something like that, yeah.",
        "Caroline: I realize you have reservations about us.",
        "Steffy: Yep.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] This isn't just some casual thing.",
        "Steffy: Not too long ago, you were with Rick.",
        "Caroline: He ended our marriage.",
        "Steffy: Because you were messing around with my dad.",
        "Ridge: Come on. I'm not gonna defend this relationship, not even to you, and I don't want her to defend it, either. What happened, happened. We're here. We're together. Accept it or don't.",
        "Steffy: So your daughter's opinion doesn't matter?",
        "Ridge: What about your dad's happiness? Does that matter to you?",
        "Steffy: I see. Caroline makes you happy.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Very happy.",
        "Steffy: Okay, then.",
        "Ridge: That's it?",
        "Steffy: That's it. I want you to be happy. Anyways, I'm out. I got a plane to catch.",
        "Ridge: Let me know if something changes one way or the other.",
        "Steffy: Caroline.",
        "Caroline: Safe travels.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Caroline: That went well.",
        "Ridge: We'll see.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, come here.",
        "Quinn: Boy, Brooke couldn't wait to rat me out.",
        "Deacon: Rat you out?! You -- you barged into her house, you hit her, and you knocked her to the ground!",
        "Quinn: That's...an exaggeration!",
        "Deacon: Quinn, you're lucky that she didn't call the cops and have you arrested for assault! Help me out with something, please! Where is the disconnect that happens up here between normal behavior and -- and the craziness going on between your ears?!",
        "Quinn: Is that a rhetorical question?",
        "Deacon: No! It's not a rhetorical question! It's something that you need to give very serious thought to! I mean, you -- you can't just go around punching people! I mean, why -- why did you even do that in the first place?",
        "Quinn: Because Brooke thinks she can have whatever she wants, any man she wants! And she needed to know that you were off limits!",
        "Deacon: Argh!",
        "Quinn: I know you're angry.",
        "Deacon: Yes! Yes! I am angry, because all this crazy that you throw out, it doesn't have to be this way! Quinn, you are beautiful and intelligent and talented! You're sexy as hell! You got me here with you every single night! Baby, you don't have to be insecure like this, going around decking people! Look, hope and Brooke, these women, they are important to me, okay? That is my daughter and her mother! They do not -- they don't deserve to have you wreaking havoc in their lives!",
        "Quinn: You know what? Okay, fine. You're right! You're right! I am a terrible person! I'm a nutcase! I-I-I'm nothing but trouble. And yeah, I screwed up yet again! So why don't you walk out that door and just don't come back? You know, I can't do this! I don't know how to -- how to manage my emotions! I don't know how to have this -- this -- this kind of semi-normal relationship! So why don't you just save yourself the future embarrassment that you know is coming down the road and go, okay?! Just -- just go! [Sighs] What are you still doing here? I told you to go! What?",
        "Deacon: Look. You're nuts. You drive me nuts. But God help me. I want to marry you."
