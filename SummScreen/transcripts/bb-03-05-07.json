        "Nick is delighted to fawn over Taylor as he's brought her back to his home. He can replace his boat, but not her. Bad timing, Stephanie shows up. She gets right to it, she realizes his relationship with Taylor has changed and they are much closer. She shocks him when she mentions that she thinks Brooke and Ridge won't be getting married and wouldn't Nick like to be there when she falls? He will hurt Taylor if this continues any further and she doesn't want to see that. Brooke tells Rick that she has to be honest with Ridge. She doesn't want him to hear about Rick and Phoebe from Stephanie. He pitches the idea of the company branching out with fragrances, lotions, candles, and Felicia says she will get in touch with a few people about it. Ridge confides in Felicia about the relationship that he opposes and now Stephanie wants to assert that Brooke knows about it. Felicia quips that she knew it \u0096 the honeymoon is over between Brooke and Stephanie and there's not even been a wedding yet. Nick tells Taylor about Stephanie's visit and her predictions, but Taylor vows this should not interfere with their relationship.",
        "Stephanie makes it happen whisking Brooke away, leaving Rick and Phoebe alone. Brooke tells Stephanie to leave her son the hell alone. Phoebe encourages Rick for some lovely-dovey time in the office although he expresses interest in not wanting to risk getting caught. Stephanie listens in on the entire conversation via the open intercom as Phoebe talks Rick into meeting her at Big Bear. Somehow Stephanie has to get Ridge to listen to her, even if it means showing him this by going to Big Bear."

        "Nick: How you doing? Can I get you anything?",
        "Taylor: No, you've already done enough. Bringing me here, you made me dinner, tucked me in.",
        "Nick: Almost got you killed.",
        "Taylor: Look, I know you feel responsible, but I was the one who turned off the radio. And if I hadn't done that, you would have heard the tanker's call and you would have moved The Marlin in time.",
        "Nick: Well, guess what? I can get another boat. You -- I can't replace.",
        "Taylor: Oh, my hero.",
        "Nick: I didn't feel very heroic. When I couldn't find you in the water, it scared the hell out of me.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Taylor: Expecting someone?",
        "Nick: Whoever it is, they have bad timing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Stephanie is on the warpath again.",
        "Brooke: She's trying to convince Ridge that I'm promoting your involvement with Phoebe.",
        "Rick: You told me to end it.",
        "Brooke: But you didn't end it! And if Stephanie can prove that I knew about it --",
        "Rick: But you didn't know.",
        "Brooke: But I do now. And I have to be honest about it.",
        "Rick: What, and tell Ridge that Phoebe and I are seeing each other?",
        "Brooke: It's better than hearing it from Stephanie.",
        "Rick: I don't want him to hear it at all. At least not until after your wedding. Mom -- Mom, look, I know I'm putting you in a horrible position here. But Ridge said that he would kill me if I ever laid a hand on his daughter. And I know he's not really going to kill me, but he can make our lives a living hell.",
        "Brooke: And so could Stephanie. And she will, Rick.",
        "Rick: I know, I'm sorry that Stephanie is after you again. But look, that's what you get when you're involved with Ridge, okay? The same old conflicts, the same old worries. And regardless of what happens with me and Phoebe, that will never change.",
        "Phoebe: Hey.",
        "Brooke: Oh, Phoebe. Wow, that dress is --",
        "Phoebe: Is it too sexy?",
        "Felicia: Oh, there's no such thing.",
        "Ridge: I would rather see it on another model. What do you think, Logan?",
        "Brooke: No, it's beautiful. But if Phoebe's not comfortable wearing it --",
        "Ridge: What about you, Rick? I noticed you couldn't keep your eyes off her when we came in.",
        "Rick: I think Phoebe looks hot in the dress. Maybe a little too hot. I mean, the public is being bombarded with images of young, sexy, spoiled rotten rich girls flaunting their sexuality to the world, and Phoebe's not like that. Plus, I don't think that's an image that we want to project as a company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I need to talk to you.",
        "Nick: I only talk in the morning.",
        "Stephanie: Watching you and Taylor at the hospital the other night, it was very apparent to me that your relationship with her has changed.",
        "Nick: Well, almost getting killed can have that effect.",
        "Stephanie: Nick, she's not your kind of woman.",
        "Nick: Oh, God. See yourself out.",
        "Stephanie: Brooke's your kind of girl, isn't she?",
        "Nick: Brooke?",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, I think her relationship with Ridge is about to blow up.",
        "Nick: Is it? And you wouldn't have anything to do with lighting that fuse, would you?",
        "Stephanie: I know how you feel about her. You're still in love with her.",
        "Nick: You don't care about me or how I feel. This is somehow about you. You turned on her, didn't you? You turned on her just like I said you would. God, I need a drink.",
        "Stephanie: I don't think they're going to get married.",
        "Nick: I knew the whole, \"Welcome to the family, Brooke\" routine wouldn't last.",
        "Stephanie: Well, she's brought this all on herself, as usual.",
        "Nick: God, you really do borderline on insanity, you know that?",
        "Stephanie: When it falls apart, she's going to need someone to comfort her. Don't you want to be the one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: See?",
        "Brooke: See? This isn't so bad. All of us working together.",
        "Felicia: Yeah. 'Cause you know us Forrester's -- so great at putting our grudges behind us and getting on with our lives. Right, big brother?",
        "Ridge: We need to focus on work. We've got a lot to do, not time much time to do it.",
        "Rick: I agree. There's a lot at stake here, people. We need to focus. No fooling around.",
        "Ridge: So Rick, you sent out a memo. You got something you want to discuss?",
        "Rick: It was something I was looking into at International. So, what would you say to a signature fragrance?",
        "Felicia: Perfume?",
        "Rick: Yes, definitely. But I was also thinking about oils, soaps -- candles, even.",
        "Brooke: Don't we have enough on our plate right now? We could launch the new fragrance with the opening of the boutiques. We market the perfume as an accessory. It would be the perfect compliment to our clothing.",
        "Phoebe: What would it smell like?",
        "Rick: Well, we'd have to work with a specialist on that. And since we don't have a men's line yet, we would only have to focus on the fragrance for women.",
        "Felicia: Give it a pretty name, like -- Phoebe?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Rick: I actually like that.",
        "Ridge: You know, if this gave us an edge on Forrester Creations, I'm all for it. They're not working on something like this, are they?",
        "Rick: No, I was doing the research all on my own. And I was planning on pitching it to Dad when I arrived back in L.A.",
        "Ridge: This is worth taking a look at.",
        "Felicia: Do you think it's possible to come up with a fragrance in time for the opening?",
        "Brooke: I'll call some people.",
        "Felicia: Rick, I know it's short notice, but it'd be great if we could mention something about it in your interview.",
        "Phoebe: Oh, my -- I completely forgot about that.",
        "Ridge: Forgot about what?",
        "Felicia: Rick and Phoebe have a press thing next week.",
        "Rick: Yeah, do you think maybe you could handle the P.R. for that?",
        "Felicia: I think that's a really good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I think Brooke can handle you. She's done pretty well all these years.",
        "Stephanie: You know, I don't think I've caused Brooke as many problems as she's caused for herself. That seems to be her modus operandi.",
        "Nick: And yours would be? Let see. Ah, yes. Playing games with other people's lives. It's late, leave me alone.",
        "Stephanie: So, you believe that Brooke and Ridge are meant to be together. You know what they say, don't let your pride stand in the way of your happiness.",
        "Nick: It's so nice to see that you're concerned about my happiness.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I'm not. I'm worried about Taylor. She's just a distraction for you. If Brooke were available, you'd drop her like a hot potato.",
        "Nick: That's not true.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it is. Yes, it is. She's had a terrible year. She needs stability. She needs someone that she can count on.",
        "Nick: I agree with you on that, Stephanie. Which is why I pray that she stays away from you and your screwy family.",
        "Stephanie: Didn't you just say that to Brooke a little while ago?",
        "Nick: Too bad she didn't listen.",
        "Stephanie: Maybe it is too bad. Look, the kids are still seeing one another against her father's wishes. And Brooke -- Brooke supports it.",
        "Nick: She supports it because there's nothing wrong with it.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I see she's discussed it with you. That means that Ridge is the only one in the dark.",
        "Nick: Not for long, I'm sure, being the ray of sunshine that you are.",
        "Stephanie: Look, I'm not the villain here, Nick. And neither are you. I know you would not deliberately hurt Taylor. But it's going to happen if you don't stop now.",
        "Nick: Time for you to go.",
        "Stephanie: She doesn't deserve to be thrown over for Brooke, again.",
        "Nick: Please drive safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Taylor remembering]",
        "Nick: You know, I've taken just about everything off already. What's one more thing?",
        "Taylor: You don't have to do that for me.",
        "Nick: Let face it. You would have won the next hand, and my guess is, you would have wanted the pants to come off. I just think that this makes more of a statement, don't you?",
        "[Nick sighs]",
        "Taylor: You were gone a while.",
        "Nick: Sorry.",
        "Taylor: Who was it?",
        "Nick: Stephanie.",
        "Taylor: Did she know I was here?",
        "Nick: Are you kidding? If she knew you were here, she would have drug you downstairs by your hair and taken you out of here.",
        "Taylor: Oh, I know it. She's definitely not happy about the two of us seeing each other.",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Taylor: So, is that what she wanted? She wanted to come here and find out what was going on?",
        "Nick: I think she put something new in her pipe to smoke.",
        "Taylor: What are you talking about?",
        "Nick: There's a problem with Brooke.",
        "Taylor: And what does that have to do with you?",
        "Nick: Nothing. But, this woman claims that Ridge and Brooke's relationship is going to fall apart, and Brooke will come running back to me.",
        "Taylor: You know what? I know I was a little out of it, but when she was at the hospital, she said something really strange to me. She told me that Ridge would always know that I was an important part of his life. Now, why would she say that to me? And why did she just say that to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: Wow. Talk about tension. I'm not even involved and I need an aspirin.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, keep that up and I'll need one, too.",
        "Felicia: Don't blame me. You're the one who was trying to knock Rick over with your evil eye. Okay, I get it. You are less than thrilled about working with the guy. But Phoebe doesn't seem to have a problem with it, so why should you?",
        "Ridge: Well, I thought she handled herself very well, actually. I was afraid it would be real difficult for her.",
        "Felicia: She's a trooper. The fashion show must go on, right?",
        "Ridge: Still, I don't want them spending too much time together alone.",
        "Felicia: Come on, Ridge. I think Rick got the message when you kicked him out of the house.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, Mother obviously didn't. She still thinks Phoebe and Rick are involved with each other, and she thinks Brooke's supporting it.",
        "Felicia: Ouch.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Felicia: It sounds like the honeymoon between Brooke and Mom is over, and your wedding hasn't even happened yet.",
        "Ridge: Well, I made it very clear I'm not going to tolerate her abusing Brooke anymore. Rick and Phoebe's relationship is the last hurdle before our wedding, right? Now, we're over that. That's it, no more. See you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Rick, this is wrong. I can't lie to my fianc\u00e9, especially weeks before the wedding!",
        "Rick: Mom, Ridge is fine right now.",
        "Brooke: You and Phoebe did great today. And I appreciate that. But one slip, one secret look --",
        "Rick: We know what's at stake here, okay?",
        "Brooke: Well, then, just keep your distance from each other, okay? At least until after the wedding.",
        "Rick: A few weeks is like an eternity to an 18-year-old, you know that. Besides, she may dump me before then, anyway.",
        "Brooke: I don't want that to happen. It's just -- look, if you two are going to see each other, just be careful, okay? It's not just Ridge who's watching over you two. It's Stephanie, too. She's got an eye on you. And if you get caught --",
        "Rick: We won't. [Door opens] Stephanie --",
        "Brooke: Phoebe, I thought you were changing into another gown?",
        "Phoebe: Well, I was, but grandma wanted to check something.",
        "Rick: What's the problem?",
        "Stephanie: The neckline. I just don't think the stitching is right. Take a look at it.",
        "Rick: That's impossible.",
        "Phoebe: I don't feel anything.",
        "Brooke: Let me see.",
        "Stephanie: I can have Eric check it later, you know. Actually, Brooke, I came in here to see you for a moment. Can I talk to you?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, what? Sure.",
        "Stephanie: Good. Well, I thought we should go over to Ridge's office. He's not there. Come on. Any reason they shouldn't be left alone? You told me they weren't involved, gave me your word.",
        "Brooke: Yes, of course.",
        "Stephanie: Well, come on.",
        "Phoebe: Finally, I have you to myself. I",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: From what I heard, Brooke and you rely on each other.",
        "Nick: Stephanie thinks the kids are still seeing each other. And that Brooke's lying to ridge about it.",
        "Taylor: Well, they're not.",
        "Nick: I'm just telling you what she said.",
        "Taylor: From what I heard, Brooke told Rick to stop seeing Phoebe, and he did. That's what Ridge just told me.",
        "Nick: Well, I don't know, but you do know that this woman's nuts, and she hates Brooke.",
        "Taylor: So Stephanie tells Ridge that Brooke's been lying, and then he would want to stop the wedding? Didn't she just spend the last year trying to put the two of them together? And now she wants to break them up? I just -- I don't get it. So, what? She -- okay, she thinks all of this would cause Brooke to come running back to you? Is that what you think?",
        "Nick: Me? I don't know what Brooke'll do.",
        "Taylor: So what happens to us? Do we allow Stephanie and the Forresters' drama to affect our lives? Or are we through with that? I know I am. What about you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So what do you want?",
        "Stephanie: How about the truth?",
        "Brooke: Oh, God, here we go again.",
        "Stephanie: Ridge deserves to know what's going on. And you are keeping it from him.",
        "Brooke: What are you talking about?",
        "Stephanie: You're lying to him. Those two are still involved. Why can't you just be honest?",
        "Brooke: Ridge doesn't believe that.",
        "Stephanie: Brooke, do the right thing and tell him. Tell him yourself.",
        "Brooke: I don't need you to tell me what the right thing is for my family.",
        "Stephanie: Well, maybe you do. Because you've certainly mishandled this whole situation. He's told you from the beginning she's an innocent little teenager, and you've done nothing to rein your son in.",
        "Brooke: That's because I don't bully my children the way you've bullied yours.",
        "Stephanie: Oh. So it's okay, then, for them to have sex?",
        "Brooke: I didn't say that.",
        "Stephanie: How do you think this is all going to go down -- as they say -- when Ridge finds out? This girl will come and tell him who she slept with.",
        "Brooke: Oh, stop it.",
        "Stephanie: She will! She's a good girl. She's not a liar. You could keep a secret like this, but that little girl will never be able to keep that secret --",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, I said stop it! My God, you know what? You're right. Phoebe is a good girl, and Rick is a good man. And I don't give a damn what you think! He would never take advantage of Phoebe or any other woman for that matter. So just keep your mouth shut and leave my son alone. Do you hear me? Stay the hell out of it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Phoebe, Phoebe, this is not a good idea. I mean, people are going to -- they can walk in here.",
        "Phoebe: Then lock the door.",
        "Rick: Lock the door? Like that's not going to set your father off. The two of us in here with a locked door?",
        "Phoebe: My father is downstairs in the cutting room with Felicia. Nobody knows what's going on over here.",
        "Rick: It's not just your dad that we have to worry about.",
        "Phoebe: Who else? My grandma?",
        "Rick: She suspects.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, because my dad probably asked her to keep an eye on us.",
        "Rick: Listen, for my mom's sake, okay? We have to do this. She's not telling your dad, but we can't risk getting caught.",
        "Phoebe: So let's go somewhere no one can walk in on us.",
        "Rick: You mean get away?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah. I mean, we're almost done here. I'll leave my dad a note and tell him I'm going to the beach with Madison.",
        "Rick: No, no. Bridget's house is no good. I mean, if I disappear, too, that's the first place your dad would check.",
        "Phoebe: What about Big Bear? We'll take separate cars. And I'll go first. And then you'll just meet me there. Come on.",
        "Rick: Okay, okay. But first --",
        "[Kissing noises]",
        "Phoebe: That was nice.",
        "Rick: There's more where that came from.",
        "Phoebe: I'll see you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Lord -- I don't know if I can get Ridge to listen to me. But I've got to. He's got to see this for himself. I should probably go up to Big Bear."
