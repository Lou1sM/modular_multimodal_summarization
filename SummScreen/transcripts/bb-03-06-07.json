        "Nick: It sounds like you're asking me if I'm through with Brooke.",
        "Taylor: Are you?",
        "Nick: Haven't I made that answer pretty clear by now?",
        "Taylor: In a few ways.",
        "Nick: Well, hold on to that then. And let go of whatever Stephanie may come and say and do.",
        "Taylor: Well, I know that Stephanie was just trying to stir up trouble, but she might have brought up an issue that might be good for us to address.",
        "Nick: Which one?",
        "Taylor: If Brooke, for some reason, was suddenly available, and showed up on your doorstep, how would you feel about that? I'm not asking for reassurances. I'm just, you know, trying to find out how you would feel. Okay, how did you feel when Stephanie just told you that Ridge and Brooke might be having problems?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Nick: Doesn't anyone know how to use a phone? Hold that thought. Actually, go ahead and lose it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Sweetheart, I need to talk to you for a moment, privately.",
        "Ridge: Mother, we just got started here.",
        "Stephanie: Please, now.",
        "Ridge: Let's take five.",
        "Stephanie: Go home for the night, Paulette.",
        "Ridge: All right, what's so damned important?",
        "Stephanie: They're still seeing one another.",
        "Ridge: No, they're not.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, there are. I heard him on the intercom. They're on their way up now to Big Bear.",
        "Ridge: Mother, Phoebe wouldn't do something like that. We have an understanding.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, Phoebe says to you and tells you what you want to hear, and so does Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Will you stop with the thing with Brooke?",
        "Stephanie: She's lying to you.",
        "Ridge: Mother, I'm not going to take it anymore. You're not going to drive a wedge between us.",
        "Stephanie: I'm telling you to stop worrying about Brooke and start protecting your daughter!",
        "Ridge: Phoebe knows how I feel about all this. She's a good girl.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, she's a good girl, but she's also a teenager. Honey, she's going to do what the hell she wants and she's going to worry about the consequences later. And Brooke is encouraging her to act on her feelings.",
        "Ridge: Mother, Brooke is just as upset about all of this as I am.",
        "Stephanie: If she's upset, the only thing she's upset about is that you might catch her in a lie.",
        "Ridge: I said stop with that!",
        "Stephanie: Rick confirmed it. I'm telling you, Brooke knows what's going on. I heard him in the conversation. He said, \"Phoebe, we've got to be careful, we can't get caught because of my mother.\"",
        "Ridge: That could mean anything.",
        "Stephanie: It means I'm right and you know it!",
        "Ridge: Okay, tell me, what exactly did you hear?",
        "Stephanie: Come with me up to Big Bear. I'll tell you everything in the car. [Ridge sighs] Come on, before it's too late!",
        "Ridge: All right, but I'm driving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I should have called.",
        "Nick: Well, I wasn't expecting to see you. Come in.",
        "Brooke: Well, I can't stay, really. It's just -- I wanted to bring you something. Hope heard about your accident, and she wanted me to give you this. She thought it'd make you feel better. It's a DVD from her school play. Isn't it cute?",
        "Nick: Well, thank you. Thank hope for me.",
        "Brooke: I will. Well, I -- whose purse? Is Taylor here?",
        "Nick: She's upstairs.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yeah. Well, I guess I should have called before I stopped by.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: We should have called the caretaker.",
        "Rick: No, nobody could know that we're up here.",
        "Phoebe: Well, we could have convinced him not to say anything.",
        "Rick: Well, knowing your father, he probably paid the entire neighborhood to watch out for us.",
        "Phoebe: Well, you know, then it's a good thing we're here. They can earn their keep.",
        "Rick: I should probably start a fire.",
        "Phoebe: I think you already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You're sure Rick and Phoebe were meeting at the cabin?",
        "Stephanie: That was not her message?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Stephanie: She said she was going to the beach with Madison. And don't worry, she'd be home late, so don't wait up for her. I told you, I heard their entire conversation on the intercom.",
        "Ridge: Well, it wasn't Phoebe's idea. I don't care how it sounded. I'm sure Rick was behind this.",
        "Stephanie: What does it matter who's behind what? The point is, they were supposed to stop seeing each other, right? And that's what Brooke led you to believe.",
        "Ridge: I don't want to hear one more word about Brooke, all right? Phoebe is my main concern right now.",
        "Stephanie: Well, shouldn't she be Brooke's concern, too? She's going to be her stepmother. What the hell, she was never worried about her own virtue, why would she be worried about Phoebe's virtue --",
        "Ridge: Okay, that's enough!",
        "Stephanie: Look, I've been thinking, you know, if you're concerned about launching this whole new string of boutiques, and trying to tie in the whole wedding thing, you could call that off.",
        "Ridge: I am not canceling the wedding.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I realize there's a lot at stake, but it's certainly not worth throwing your future away.",
        "Ridge: My future is with Brooke, all right?",
        "Stephanie: Honey, you can't make a good life with someone who's lying to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So, Taylor's here, and I'm interrupting.",
        "Nick: No. No, she's -- she's resting. It's okay. She's okay.",
        "Brooke: Is she really okay? After what happened last night?",
        "Nick: She's a little rattled.",
        "Brooke: I'll bet. You both could have been killed.",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: It's hard to believe, that a Marone tanker destroyed the marlin. I loved that boat.",
        "Nick: So did I. I should probably let you know that Stephanie was here a little while ago.",
        "Brooke: Why did Stephanie come here?",
        "Nick: She wanted me to know how available you're about to be.",
        "Brooke: What? She has no right coming here to you.",
        "Nick: Brooke, if you support this relationship with Rick and Phoebe, you know Forrester's going to have a problem with that.",
        "Brooke: It's getting complicated.",
        "Nick: Well, when hasn't it?",
        "Brooke: Look, I'm sorry that she came to you. That's horrible.",
        "Nick: I'm just saying. Watch your back. Brooke --",
        "Brooke: Look, I should go.",
        "Nick: Brooke -- listen, talk to me. Will you just tell me what is going on with this whole deal --",
        "Brooke: Nothing. Nothing is going on!",
        "Nick: It's not nothing!",
        "Brooke: It's nothing to you! It's not your problem anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: I found blankets! Wow.",
        "Rick: I was just going to say the same thing about you.",
        "Phoebe: How did you do all this so fast?",
        "Rick: I was a boy scout. I always come prepared.",
        "Phoebe: For what?",
        "Rick: For anything.",
        "Phoebe: Were you prepared for me?",
        "Rick: Absolutely not.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, well, you surprised me, too.",
        "Rick: You surprise me every day. Like wanting to come up here, just the two of us.",
        "Phoebe: It was kind of smart, right?",
        "Rick: Kind of sneaky.",
        "Phoebe: I know. I hate having to sneak around like this. But, I don't know -- for now, it's kind of exciting.",
        "Rick: I know what you mean.",
        "Phoebe: So, here we are.",
        "Rick: Yes, here we are.",
        "Phoebe: All alone.",
        "Phoebe: I don't know. We can do whatever we want. And no one can stop us.",
        "Phoebe: Well, forget what I said about sneaking around. I'm starting to like this.",
        "Rick: If we didn't have to hide from your family, we could do this all the time, a whole lot more. I mean, you know, like go out to a movie, to dinner --",
        "Phoebe: Uh-huh, right.",
        "Rick: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry. Look, I appreciate your concern.",
        "Nick: Those people, I swear to God. These people! I told you that woman would turn on you.",
        "Brooke: I know. And Ridge told Stephanie that if she abused me anymore, that she would lose him.",
        "Nick: What about if you lose him?",
        "Brooke: We'll get through this. Ridge and I have waited too long and tried too hard to be together to lose it all now.",
        "Nick: Well, that's good. That's good.",
        "Brooke: Look, I think you should call hope and let her know what you think about the DVD, okay?",
        "Nick: I will. I'm going to go up and check on Taylor.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Oh, you know what? Gosh, I really hate to ask this, but can I use your phone? Because my battery's dead in my cell.",
        "Nick: Sure. Here you go. Thanks again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: If you mention Brooke's name one more time, if you so much as think about her, I'm going to pull over and put you out of the car. [Cell phone rings] Hello?",
        "Brooke: Hi, Ridge, it's me. I'm on my way home, and I was just wondering if you wanted me to pick something up to eat.",
        "Ridge: No. Listen, I already talked to Catherine. She's going to stay late and watch the kids.",
        "Brooke: What's going on?",
        "Ridge: I need you to get up to the Big Bear cabin, right now. I'm on my way up there now. Apparently, Rick and Phoebe have got some kind of rendezvous going on.",
        "Brooke: They're at the cabin?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. They're seeing each other again, Logan. But don't worry. When I get up there, I'm going to put a stop to it once and for all. I'll see you up there, okay?",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God, Rick. What are you thinking? What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I am going to put another log on the fire.",
        "Phoebe: I have a better way to keep warm.",
        "Rick: You know, I like this way better. [Car approaching] Did you hear that?",
        "Phoebe: What?",
        "Rick: It sounded like -- like a car.",
        "Phoebe: You're just teasing me.",
        "Rick: No, no -- never mind.",
        "Stephanie: You make sure that they're here.",
        "Rick: Geez!",
        "Ridge: Phoebe? Phoebe?",
        "Phoebe: I'm right here, Dad.",
        "Ridge: Where's Rick? I know he's here. I saw his car out there.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'm here.",
        "Ridge: Sweetheart, are you all right?",
        "Phoebe: Of course I'm okay, Dad.",
        "Ridge: Come on, let's go.",
        "Phoebe: No.",
        "Ridge: No? No? You did this. You brought my little girl up here for what, Rick? Huh? For what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: This is weird. This is too weird.",
        "Nick: She brought me a DVD that Hope wanted me to have of her in her school play.",
        "Taylor: And that's the only reason Brooke came by?",
        "Nick: That's it.",
        "Taylor: She didn't know Stephanie had been here?",
        "Nick: Not until I told her, no.",
        "Taylor: Why did you do that?",
        "Nick: Because she's in a tough spot and I'm concerned about her. But she said everything's all right.",
        "Taylor: So Stephanie was wrong then. She was wrong about Phoebe and Rick, that they aren't seeing each other.",
        "Nick: Well, Forrester doesn't think so. Is that what this is about, though? Rick and Phoebe? Is that what your concern is about here? Or is it really about something else? Because you asked me before how I felt. So, I refer to you. You are my analyst. You're supposed to know how I'm feeling. So, let me ask you. How do I feel?",
        "Taylor: You didn't answer my question. If Brooke and Ridge split up --",
        "Nick: It's got nothing to do with me. I'm not with you because Brooke's not available. I'm with you because I want to be with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Phoebe, honey, get your coat. You can explain all this to your father in the car.",
        "Ridge: Not until I hear what Rick has to say for himself.",
        "Rick: Oh, please, Ridge, like you're going to listen to me anyway.",
        "Ridge: Am I wrong? Hmm? The candles? The fireplace? Am I getting the wrong impression here?",
        "Phoebe: Dad!",
        "Ridge: What happened, Rick? Did you plan on defying me from the beginning?",
        "Phoebe: Dad, he wanted to break it off in the beginning, but I wouldn't let him.",
        "Ridge: That act you put on in the office, it was very convincing.",
        "Phoebe: We didn't want to lie to you.",
        "Stephanie: But he didn't lie to everyone, did he?",
        "Rick: Nobody knew we were supposed to be up here.",
        "Ridge: No, of course not. You wouldn't want to risk somebody coming up and destroying your little plan, would you?",
        "Stephanie: Ridge does not believe that your mother knows about this, but she does. I overheard the two of you.",
        "Phoebe: What did you hear?",
        "Rick: What? So you're spying on us now? Oh, my God, is this how it's going to be? What are you, bugging your offices now? Is this how you treat your daughter, who you love so dearly, you treat her like a criminal?",
        "Ridge: You know what, Rick? My mother told me you guys were here. And I'm damn glad she did. God knows what would have happened if we'd left you up here alone.",
        "Rick: Nothing! Nothing would have happened that Phoebe didn't want to happen.",
        "Ridge: You shut your mouth!",
        "Stephanie: Don't let him bait you, honey.",
        "Rick: You know what? Coming up here was a waste of your time. You can't get Phoebe to stop seeing me. And you can't drag her out of here. She's an adult, ridge. She is 18 years old!",
        "Phoebe: Rick --",
        "Rick: And she didn't come up here just to be with me. She came up here to get away from you. And I can't blame her. If I could get my mom to do the same thing, I would. I would get both of them as far away from you as humanly possible.",
        "Ridge: I told you to shut your mouth! Shut your mouth! You stay the hell away from my daughter! You hear me?",
        "Brooke: Ridge, stop it!",
        "Ridge: Stay the hell away from her!",
        "Brooke: Leave him alone!"
