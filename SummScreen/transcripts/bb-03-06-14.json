        "Ridge uses his key and lets himself in at Katie's. He tells her the key works. She tells him yes but she thought he was going to stay away today since Brooke was coming and she wanted to talk to her first. She doesn't know yet what she will say to her. He insists that he still wishes he could talk to Brooke first. Katie says no, she is a big girl and she will not hide behind him. She says Brooke may never understand it but love doesn't have to make sense. And if anyone understands that, it would be Brooke. Brooke is napping on the plane and thinking of Ridge and telling him that she is hurrying home as fast as she can. Hope checks in on her. She comes back and tells Wyatt that she thinks she might have done a terrible thing. She starts by saying that Katie did not faint at her mom's wedding. She actually stopped the wedding because she is in love with Ridge. She swears Wyatt to secrecy. He says of course as no one would believe him anyway. She says she could not see her mom get hurt by Ridge again so she arranged for her to go to Paris with them. This would give Katie and Ridge time to sort out their feelings. She thought they would come to their senses but found out last night that they do want a future together. Wyatt says that is not her fault. She says she knows but she wonders if maybe it would have been best for her to stay out of it and let Brooke have him for a week rather than nothing at all. She is going to be heartbroken. When Brooke joins them in the cabin they tell her Aly is in the cockpit with the pilot. It's better this way. Brooke wants to start making plans, forget the big wedding, just go to the courthouse and fill out a few papers, get a witness and be married. She asks if they would like to be her witnesses and they both make a quick excuse of why they can't commit right now. Brooke says okay, one thing at a time. First Katie wants to talk to her and that feels good to get things back on track. Ridge starts to leave and wants to be sure Katie doesn't want him there with Brooke. Katie says no as it would be like Brooke in a strait jacket. She is never the same with Ridge around. She admits to Ridge that she is scared. She is about to tell her sister that she is guilty of things she has accused Brooke of. He says she is not guilty of anything and all they have to do is admit their feelings have changed. Even at the end of the day and it is a disaster, it just has to be done.",
        "Back at the office, Hope walks in. She says it works out well for Ridge as he won't get the brunt of the shock and pain this will cause Brooke. She wants to know what happened. He says he has played it around in his mind and he doesn't know what happened. He tries to make an analogy. He asks Hope if she has ever wanted something so badly and for so long that you don't remember ever not wanting it. And finally that day is there and it's yours but something inside you has changed, it's shifted. And that thing you have wanted for so long, you just don't want it anymore. Hope reflects and admits that yes she has felt that too. But she is still amazed that this happened so fast so how does Ridge know for sure that he loves Katie. And she does tell him that as much as she loves her Aunt Katie, she is not the innocent victim that she is making herself out to be. And if it weren't for Taylor's vendetta against Brooke, Bill and Katie would still be together and it wasn't that bad a match. She can agree that Bill can be a terrible person but he hasn't done any worse now that what Ridge is doing. He asks just how he is like Bill Spenser. Hope says he is trading in his wife for a sister. What Bill and Brooke did, he can not look at her the same way anymore. Hope surmises that to mean that what they both did was bad, but what her mom did was worse. And yet Katie is doing almost the exact same thing and it's Ridge in the middle of two women again. Maybe that is more acceptable to his ethics. He says all he knows was that he stayed away a year to try and be a better man. But he came back and now to her he is just a clown trying to figure out what a better man would do. He relied on his mom the same way that Hope does. But he can not ask her what she thinks anymore. But he thinks she would have had words for Bill and Brooke and she would have thought he was the better man and said enough is enough. Ridge asks Hope to not talk about Katie. She really did try to get Ridge and Brooke back together until she couldn't any more. That's just life. It's like driving a car with the steering wheel ripped from your hands and all you can do is sit back and hope no one is hurt too badly. Brooke visits Katie and wants to hear everything the doctor has told her. Katie says she is fine. Ridge did not even have to stay with her that first 24 hours that he promised he would, but he did come by every day. Ridge also knew something that she and Dr. Patrick didn't know. There was nothing wrong with her. Brooke tells her not to feel guilty about the wedding. She is just glad they can now talk openly and honestly about everything. And she knows someday a man will come along and Katie will fall head over heels. Brooke is stunned when Katie says that has already happened. Brooke is filled with glee and starts questioning Katie as to who it is. She wants to hear everything. Katie starts slowly and says at the end of the day they are sisters and she would never want to hurt her. She loves her and she hopes someday she will understand. She says it is Ridge. She is in love with Ridge. That does not compute with Brooke."

        "Ridge: The key works.",
        "Katie: What are you doing here? I thought we agreed that you were gonna stay away today.",
        "Ridge: Is someone here?",
        "Katie: No. I just figured you'd show up since I always seem to get involved with men who don't follow direction. My son's the same way.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. Good morning.",
        "Katie: It is now.",
        "Ridge: Do you know when Brooke is getting in?",
        "Katie: Um...no. And if you're wondering what I'm gonna say to her when she does arrive...so am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'm coming home to you as fast as I can. Paris seemed so gray without you.",
        "Ridge: You're dreaming, Logan.",
        "Brooke: I like to dream about you when I'm so far away. So many nights, so many dreams. [Groans] Are we there yet?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] You sound like I used to sound on long car trips.",
        "Brooke: Oh.",
        "Hope: No, I'm just checking on you.",
        "Brooke: I'm fine, sweetie. I'm just resting.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Hope: I don't know what to do.",
        "Wyatt: I'm fine with Aly sitting up in the pilot's jump seat. We never would have left the ground if Kyle hadn't have proposed it.",
        "Hope: No, no, no, no. That's not what I mean.",
        "Wyatt: Well, can I help it if I inspire such strong feelings in women? No jokes? Okay. Is your mom okay?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] I have a terrible feeling that I did a terrible thing.",
        "Wyatt: That sounds terrible.",
        "Hope: I need you to tell me if you think I was wrong.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I pretty much never think that you're wrong, but sure. What -- what happened?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Katie did not faint at my mom's wedding.",
        "Wyatt: What do you mean, like something medically happened?",
        "Hope: Not medically, but something.",
        "Wyatt: Which was what?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Stopping the wedding.",
        "Wyatt: No, Katie's not that spiteful.",
        "Hope: No, I'm not saying that she did it to hurt my mom.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but, I mean, what kind of a person would deliberately do that?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] You haven't known Katie very long, and don't get me wrong -- I-I love her. I adore my aunt. I have always looked up to her.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: I mean, there were some issues with her and my sister, Bridget, but we were all way younger then. I think that getting married and having a baby really changed Katie, so this is the last thing that I would have expected from her.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, what -- what is?",
        "Hope: Falling in love with Ridge. You can't tell anybody. You cannot tell anybody that I just told you that.",
        "Wyatt: What? What? Oh my .Who would believe me? I mean, talk about self- defeating. Another man committed to your mom?",
        "Hope: Well...used to be. Not anymore.",
        "Wyatt: What about all the profession of vows we all heard?",
        "Hope: See -- okay, this is what I grew up with. Ridge would be living with us, everything was great, and he would try and do right by his kids that he had with Taylor. And then he'd be gone. He would leave. He would move in with Taylor, and then eventually, he'd marry Taylor, and that would last like a year or two. And then he'd come back. I-I couldn't stand to have my mom go through that again, so I told Ridge and Katie before we left that they need to figure out what they're doing, and I was going to bring mom to Paris for a few days so they could have that time. [Sighs] I actually thought that they would come to their senses, but last night, they told me that they want to be together.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, but how's that your fault?",
        "Hope: I just -- I feel like maybe I should have stayed out of it. I'm wondering if it would have been better for my mom to have had Ridge for a week than to not have him at all.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: This is gonna break my mom's heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I still think I need to talk to Brooke first.",
        "Katie: Ridge, no. I'm not gonna hide behind you. I'm a big girl. I need to face this on my own.",
        "Ridge: This is about a decision that I've made.",
        "Katie: You're not alone. You and me, remember? Listen, Brooke may never understand this, and we will have to live with that. But love doesn't make sense. It doesn't have to. And if anyone should understand that, it's my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Hi! I-I was just about to come wake you up.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I heard Kyle say we'd begun our descent. Is Aly still up there with the pilot?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, yeah. She's -- she's okay. She's fine.",
        "Brooke: Good. I hope so. I'm gonna call the county clerk as soon as we get to L.A.",
        "Wyatt: Why? You got a -- you got a deed to file or something?",
        "Brooke: The deed for my marriage. I am tired of invitations and planning and all that jazz. I just want to get married in front of the justice of the peace and be with Ridge again. I mean, it wouldn't take too long, right? We just fill out a few papers, and we say our \"I dos.\" Hey. Do you guys want to be our witnesses?",
        "Hope: Oh, um, I don't -- I don't think that we can commit to anything right now.",
        "Wyatt: It's kind of hard right now.",
        "Brooke: Oh, okay. Yeah, I understand. It's been a long flight.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, who knows what the day's gonna look like in L.A.?",
        "Brooke: That's true. Katie wants me to come there right away.",
        "Hope: Oh, did she say why?",
        "Brooke: I-I don't know, actually, but it feels good. It feels like we're sisters again. Maybe she's making me breakfast.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Ah, the county clerk can wait a few hours, right?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You want me to stay.",
        "Katie: I don't.",
        "Ridge: You do.",
        "Katie: I do, actually, but you can't. You can't. Brooke won't say what she really means if you're here. It'll be like she's in a straitjacket.",
        "Ridge: What does that mean?",
        "Katie: She's not the same person when you're around. Don't you know that? She's whoever you need her to be when your eyes are on her, and then...it's someone else's turn.",
        "Ridge: Well, I guess there's some truth to that.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Katie: Ridge. I'm scared. I'm about to admit that I'm guilty of what I've accused her of.",
        "Ridge: You're not guilty of anything. The only thing we have to do is confess that our feelings have changed.",
        "Katie: I stopped your wedding.",
        "Ridge: And I'm glad.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Where will you be?",
        "Ridge: At the office, probably, just thinking of you every minute.",
        "Katie: What if it's a disaster?",
        "Ridge: At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter. It just has to be done.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] [Sighs]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You're back.",
        "Hope: Yeah. My -- uh, my mom is on her way to Katie's. I figured you'd be there, too.",
        "Ridge: Well, Katie wanted to talk to her sister alone first.",
        "Hope: Works out very well for you. You won't be there to take the full brunt of shock and pain that you're causing. Sorry. Jet lag, you know? You know how it is flying back from Paris. You leave in the morning. Half a day later, you land expecting it to be night, and it's the same morning you already lived through.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I've been to Paris. I know all about time travel. I've done it.",
        "Hope: Then why can't you at least, in your mind, go back and remember how much you loved my mom?",
        "Ridge: Well, I can. I have, in my mind.",
        "Hope: What happened?",
        "Ridge: I don't know what happened. [Sighs] How old are you now? It doesn't matter. You're old enough -- do you know what it's like to -- to want something so badly for so long that you don't even remember not wanting it? And then finally, the day's there. At last, it's yours, and... something inside you has changed. It's shifted, and the thing that you wanted for so long -- you just don't want anymore.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah, I have felt that.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I'm sorry -- I truly am -- for all of it.",
        "Hope: Katie says that the two of you are in love.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, we are.",
        "Hope: God. I mean, how -- how can you know for sure? This is still so new.",
        "Ridge: It's not that -- I've known her for a long time. Come on.",
        "Hope: You have. But how -- how well do you know her?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: I mean, honestly, Ridge, you haven't even been around the past year. My mom knows that, um, what I think happened between her and Bill was inexcusable. But Katie -- you know, she -- she really isn't the innocent victim that she's making herself out to be. And, frankly, none of this would have even happened if it weren't for Taylor's vendetta against my mom. Bill and Katie would still be together, and, honestly, I-I don't think they were so badly matched.",
        "Ridge: Bill Spencer's a horrible human being.",
        "Hope: He's a terrible person. You're right. But how can you say that what you've done isn't any different from what he's done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'm back! [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Brooke: How are you? How do you feel?",
        "Katie: Um, better. I'm -- I'm better. Come in.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Katie: Uh, how -- you must be exhausted.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I'm just excited to be home. I love Paris. Who doesn't? But it felt like it was a million miles away.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, fashion week can be crazy. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Well, it wasn't that, really. You look pale. What did the doctor say?",
        "Katie: Um, nothing. I-I haven't been back.",
        "Brooke: When's your next appointment?",
        "Katie: Um, six months.",
        "Brooke: Six months? So, you haven't had a recurrence of --",
        "Katie: Of what happened at the wedding? No. Uh, we should really talk about that.",
        "Brooke: But Ridge did stay with you that first night?",
        "Katie: No. No. He's never stayed in this house. No.",
        "Brooke: He promised, and Dr. Patrick wanted you to be watched for 24 hours.",
        "Katie: Well, people were calling, and I was fine, and Ridge came by every day.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Well, that was sweet of him.",
        "Katie: And he knew something that you and Dr. Patrick didn't.",
        "Brooke: Honey, you shouldn't keep secrets from the doctor.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] There was nothing wrong with me at the wedding.",
        "Brooke: I know. And we're all so grateful for that.",
        "Katie: No. What you think happened... didn't happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Wow. Well, I got to ask you -- how, exactly, am I like Bill Spencer?",
        "Hope: You traded in your wife for her sister.",
        "Ridge: She's not my wife!",
        "Hope: Ex-wife.",
        "Ridge: She's not my wife. And I didn't have an affair behind her back. What Bill and Brooke did together -- I-I can't look at her the same way anymore.",
        "Hope: Okay, so what are you saying? Are you saying that what you did was bad, but what my mom did was worse?",
        "Ridge: No, I'm not saying that.",
        "Hope: First, you agonize over this supposedly inexcusable crime that my mom committed with Bill -- you know, do you still love her? Do you think that you'll ever be able to -- to look at her the same? And then Katie does the same thing, essentially, but it's different. It's different, because now it's put you back in that very familiar, very comfortable man-in-the-middle situation.",
        "Ridge: Aw, don't.",
        "Hope: And what, is -- is that more acceptable to your ethics?",
        "Ridge: Maybe you're right.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: I left for a year, and all I wanted was to come back a better man. And sadly, all you see is some clown trying to figure out what a better man would do. I relied on my mom the same way you rely on yours. And I loved my mom the same way you love yours. But I can't ask her what she thinks anymore. But I have a feeling, if Stephanie were here and she'd seen what was going on with -- with Bill and Brooke, I think she would have seen the better man in me, and I think she would have said that enough is enough. You got to do me a favor. Don't talk about Katie. She was relentless about putting me and Brooke back together. She tried as hard as she could until she couldn't. And you know what? That's life. You think you're driving the car, and next thing you know, the steering wheel is ripped out of your hands. And the only thing you can really do is sit back and hope that no one gets hurt too badly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Oh, honey. [Sighs] You've really got to get past this. I know you feel bad about interrupting the wedding, but it's not your fault. You really shouldn't feel guilty. I'm just -- I'm happy we can be here together and talk openly and honestly.",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah, I-I think that we should be honest about everything.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Maybe this isn't a good time to talk about weddings and wedding plans, and maybe you can't really be happy for me, now that I'm with Ridge, but you -- you can say no.",
        "Katie: To what?",
        "Brooke: I do believe, if you get married in a courthouse, you need a witness, and I was wondering if maybe you want to help Ridge and me finish what we started?",
        "Katie: Um...I...",
        "Brooke: Uh, I-I know this is difficult for you, but someday, a man's gonna come along, and he's gonna love you. And you're gonna fall head over heels.",
        "Katie: What would you say if, um [Clears throat] I said that that had already happened?",
        "Brooke: What?! You're kidding! Who? What? Is it Bill?",
        "Katie: No. No. [Chuckles] Um, someone I could love and trust in return.",
        "Brooke: Oh, that's wonderful! You know how much I want that for you. I want you to be happy. So, do I know him?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Yeah, you do.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Okay. Well, tell me everything.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Um... I'm not really sure where to begin. Um... we've been through a lot, and... at the end of the day, we're -- we're sisters, and -- and I love you, and I would never want to hurt you.",
        "Brooke: I love you, too. And I'm sorry that I ever hurt you.",
        "Katie: I know. I know you are. I believe you.",
        "Brooke: Oh, honey. [Sighs] Thank you. Thank you. [Chuckles] So, who is it? You've got to tell me. Who is this lucky man in your life?",
        "Katie: Okay. Here it goes. Um...I love you. I do. And I -- and after Bill, I was worried that I would never be able to trust anyone ever again. I would never be able to open myself up and allow someone to love me and see me for who I am, but... I know that this is gonna come as a shock, and I'm sorry, but I hope that -- that one day you'll be able to understand and maybe even be happy for me.",
        "Brooke: Of course, I would be happy for you. Of course. Who is it?",
        "Katie: [Sighs] [Clears throat] It's Ridge. I'm in love with Ridge."
