        "Ridge: That's it. That's it. Both of you, just get the hell out of here!",
        "Stephanie: You know I'm right. You're in love with Nick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: What's going on up there?",
        "Massimo: I told Dominick that I would not interfere in Ridge's plans in marrying Brooke, and neither should he.",
        "Jackie: Oh, Massimo, no.",
        "Bridget: There's nothing you can do to change that.",
        "Massimo: Ridge and Brooke have a child -- my grandson. I am not allowing this boy to grow up tainted in scandal.",
        "Jackie: But if it's meant to be --",
        "Massimo: Oh, for God's sake. Jacqueline, they almost got married. She'd made her choice.",
        "Bridget: That's when she thought that Nick and I were still together.",
        "Massimo: And you should be. You Forresters -- you treat marriage as if it's a square dance. You keep switching partners whenever you want.",
        "Eric: Oh, stop it, mass. Stop it.",
        "Massimo: Never mind, Eric. It's reprehensible. And damn it, Bridget, it's just not like you.",
        "Eric: Massimo, my daughter has made a decision. It's finished now. God, you're like Stephanie. You're running around here pushing your own agenda. We have to let our children live their own lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Felicia? Oh, God, can you hear me? I have to call an ambulance.",
        "Felicia: No.",
        "Dante: You need a doctor.",
        "Felicia: My family --",
        "Dante: You need your family?",
        "Felicia: Now.",
        "Dante: I'll call them, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Massimo: Eric, your daughter sent Dominick over here. All I wanted was Ridge and Brooke to finish what they started.",
        "Eric: Well, this isn't about what you want, Massimo.",
        "Bridget: No, it's not. It's about what mom wants right now.",
        "Massimo: Well, she made that perfectly clear when she accepted his proposal, huh?",
        "Bridget: Well, then she'll make the same choice again no matter what Nick says, won't she?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Thorne: I got it. Hello?",
        "Dante: Hello, this is Dante Damiano. I need to speak to a member of the Forrester family, please.",
        "Thorne: Dante, it's Thorne. What is it?",
        "Dante: Look, it's Felicia. You have to hurry, okay? She's -- she's very sick. She needs to see all of you, right away.",
        "Thorne: We'll be right there. Dad. Dad! We have to go.",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Thorne: It's Felicia. She needs us.",

        "Ridge: Mother, Brooke's future is with me.",
        "Stephanie: But her heart belongs to Nick, doesn't it?",
        "Brooke: Stop it.",
        "Stephanie: You stop it. Tell my son what he has to hear. Let him go.",
        "Eric: Stephanie --",
        "Stephanie: Not now, Eric.",
        "Eric: Yes, now. It's Felicia. Something's wrong.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my God, no.",
        "Ridge: Come on, let's go.",
        "Stephanie: Not you. Felicia wants her family, and you're not a part of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Here. Your family should be here any minute. Is there anything else I can do for you?",
        "Felicia: Stay.",
        "Dante: Look, I'm not leaving. But I'm going to call an ambulance.",
        "Felicia: No.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I thought everybody left.",
        "Massimo: Well, I didn't want to intrude on Felicia's time with her family.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie refused to let me be there. Can you believe that? Her daughter could be dying, and she's taking shots at me.",
        "Massimo: You don't deserve that. But it gives us a little time to talk.",
        "Brooke: I'm all talked-out.",
        "Massimo: I'll bet. Then just listen. Brooke, I don't want you worrying about Stephanie. I'll make sure that she doesn't bother you anymore. Nor will Dominick. And you and Ridge will be free to run your own lives and make your own decisions, for yourselves and your children.",
        "Brooke: Well, that's very good of you, Massimo. But --",
        "Massimo: But you think I'm getting a little ahead of myself.",
        "Brooke: A little.",
        "Massimo: Brooke, the minister was about to announce you husband and wife. You and Ridge are practically married already. And you will be, Brooke. It's the only way I will allow it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: How is she?",
        "Dante: She's been asking for all of you. And you, too.",
        "Thorne: Thanks, man.",
        "Dante: Thanks for coming.",
        "Stephanie: Dante, did you call an ambulance?",
        "Dante: She wouldn't let me.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, I think you should be in the hospital now.",
        "Felicia: Too late.",
        "Stephanie: No, it's not.",
        "Dante: Stephanie, this is what Felicia wants.",
        "Ridge: Champagne? Now?",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, I think it's your liver. I don't think it's the cancer yet. If it is, I just don't think you should have any alcohol.",
        "Eric: When have you ever known Felicia to take no for an answer?",
        "Felicia: My way.",
        "Dante: Everyone, please take a glass.",
        "Nick: Well, I could use a drink. You know I'm usually a beer guy, but seeing as it's you -- a toast to the life of the party and the coolest girl I ever had the pleasure of --",
        "Felicia: The pleasure was all mine. Sorry.",
        "Nick: For what?",
        "Felicia: Dominick. I really believed he was your son.",
        "Nick: You don't have to be sorry for that. You don't have to be sorry for anything.",
        "Felicia: One for the road.",
        "Nick: Let's raise our glasses, shall we? To Felicia.",
        "Thorne: Vintage Felicia. We all love you so much.",
        "Felicia: I know.",
        "Ridge: You always did bring the life to the party, kiddo. But you brought so much more, too. The way you brought this family back together. You reminded us what was really important. Taught us all a lesson. How strong can a mother's love be?",
        "Felicia: Dominick.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. We're all going to take care of Dominick, don't worry. Who would've guessed, huh? My kid sister -- strongest one of us all.",
        "Thorne: That goes for me, too. You gotta make a lot of noise in this family to be heard. And believe me, I know. But you, Felicia -- you always stood out. Even in this crowd. I just can't fathom not having you here. I love you so much.",
        "Felicia: I love you.",
        "Eric: Thanks for coming home to us. I was so happy to see you. Oh, we were a mess. Weren't we? We were all fighting over the company. And your mother and I at each other's throats. We'd lost all perspective and faith. But you looked into each one of us -- into our eyes -- and you reminded us how much we mean to each other. Thanks. Well, you're just this black sheep, aren't you? Black sheep of the family, and you're so proud of it. Well, it's a dubious honor. The best -- from the first day you learned how to say no, you were determined to be an outsider, but you're not. And you never will be. You have this special place of your own in this family, and you always will. I love you.",
        "Felicia: I love you, too, Daddy.",
        "Eric: My little girl.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, I'm taking you to the hospital. I'm going to call an ambulance right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Massimo: Brooke, you have to think of R.J. Ridge's namesake. If you step towards Dominick --",
        "Brooke: Ridge will always be a part of R.J.'s life.",
        "Massimo: Brooke, stay with Ridge. Give your son a proper family.",
        "Brooke: You don't have to tell me what's at stake here.",
        "Massimo: I think you and your daughter should be reminded what it was like for her growing up in the shadow of her parents' scandals. That's not what you want for R.J. Brooke, I know that. And neither does Bridget. Look, you care for Ridge. You were ready to marry him.",
        "Brooke: Yes. Yes, I was. But I never stopped loving Nick.",
        "Massimo: Ridge left Taylor and his children for you, damn it.",
        "Brooke: After he left me for them!",
        "Massimo: All right, fine. Okay. I just want to say one more thing. If you are afraid to go ahead with this wedding because of Stephanie, trust me, if you step towards Dominick, your problems with Stephanie will be a walk in the park compared to what you'll get from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Yes, yes, that's the address. Well, how long are you going to take? Tell them to hurry, please.",
        "Thorne: Mother, mother. I know how hard this is.",
        "Ridge: You're just making it harder now.",
        "Eric: She wants to be with us. She wants us all to be together as a family.",
        "[Dominick fusses]",
        "Bridget: I hope it's okay. I thought that maybe -- I thought maybe you'd want to see Dominick. Want to see, mommy?",
        "Felicia: Hi, baby.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, honey, listen to me. If you won't fight for yourself, please fight for this little baby.",
        "Eric: Stephanie, don't.",
        "Felicia: Momma loves you so much. Please -- please --",
        "Dante: Felicia, we will take care of him.",
        "Bridget: Like my own.",
        "Felicia: Bridget's mommy now, okay? Oh, God -- Dominick's family. All of you. He's going to need you so much.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, this baby needs you more than anybody else.",
        "Eric: Stephanie, don't.",
        "Stephanie: You have got to keep fighting.",
        "Bridget: Stephanie, she's really at peace about what's happening.",
        "Stephanie: It's happening because we're letting it happen.",
        "Bridget: She has done everything. Come here, sweetie.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia --",
        "Bridget: She's done everything she can do.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia? Felicia, listen to me. Felicia, Felicia? You can have an organ transplant. It wouldn't cure the cancer, but it would buy you time. It'd buy you time with the baby. He can't lose you, honey. I can't lose you. And he deserves that time. Please. Listen to me. If I can buy you that time -- oh, honey, in the end, nothing means anything except you and the baby. You've got to keep fighting. Felicia, you can't walk away from your child. You have a duty to him. To us. Please, you have to be here for him. Oh, honey, I'm sorry I wasn't here for you always. I'm so sorry.",
        "Felicia: You are now.",
        "Stephanie: Please listen to me and keep fighting. Keep fighting for the baby. That's what's important.",
        "Felicia: No --",
        "Stephanie: It is. He needs to know you. He needs to know how much you love him.",
        "Felicia: Help me!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, baby girl. Felicia? Felicia? Oh, my God, no! Oh, no! Oh, God, no! Not my baby. Please, not my baby. Oh, God. Please!"
