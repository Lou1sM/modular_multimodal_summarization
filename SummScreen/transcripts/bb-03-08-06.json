        "Ridge: My sister. My baby sister.",
        "Massimo: I am so sorry, son.",
        "Ridge: I can't believe Felicia's really gone. I just can't believe it.",
        "Massimo: But you'll always have lovely memories.",
        "Ridge: It's hard to prepare for things like this, Massimo. I was dancing with her at mother and dad's wedding. I knew there was a possibility that it would be the last chance I ever held her in my arms. I knew she was dying. But she was so full of life. She seemed so beautiful and so happy. You know she had us toast her? Champagne -- wish her bon voyage. She was the life of the party, right up till the end.",
        "Massimo: Ridge, she loved you very much. She looked up to you.",
        "Ridge: I know.",
        "Massimo: Look, we can't stay here. My driver's out front. Let me take you home to Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Oh, all this wedding stuff has been going on, I just --",
        "Massimo: Look, that doesn't mean anything now. Ridge, you're grieving. You need to be with your family. Your son and his mother.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I do.",
        "Massimo: Brooke loves you very much. If you need her, she'll be there for you.",
        "Ridge: She always has been, Massimo.",
        "Massimo: So what are we waiting for? Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: Taylor?",
        "Taylor: Hey!",
        "Hector: What are you doing here?",
        "Taylor: Waiting for you.",
        "Hector: When you said you wanted me to pick you up at the marina, this isn't exactly what I pictured.",
        "Taylor: Well, what am I going to do, go to the Cafe Russe? Risk running into one of the people I know. Facing their looks of pity.",
        "Hector: Is that why you're drowning your sorrows? You're upset about Ridge and Brooke's wedding?",
        "Taylor: No. I am drinking a toast. To my dearly departed sister in law.",
        "Hector: Felicia? I'm sorry.",
        "Taylor: Stephanie called. Felicia died tonight. And where was I? Was I there? Was I there with my family member? Was I there supporting my husband? Helping him grieve? Was I supporting my mother in law? No. Where the hell was I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Brooke: Hello?",
        "Nick: It's me.",
        "Brooke: Nick. How's Felicia?",
        "Nick: She's gone.",
        "Brooke: Oh, no. The whole family must be devastated.",
        "Nick: They are. Stephanie -- she was a wreck.",
        "Brooke: She just started spending time with Felicia again.",
        "Nick: Well, it's better late than never. It did make me think how short life is. Just can't waste a minute of it.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, this tragedy reminds us how precious this time really is.",
        "Nick: Especially my time with you. There was so much I wanted to tell you today.",
        "Brooke: I know. I want to talk to you, too.",
        "Nick: I'm at the Marlin. I want to come over.",
        "Brooke: No, no, I don't think tonight's a good night.",
        "Nick: I want to see you.",
        "Brooke: I want to see you, too. And I need to see you. But I think Bridget needs me more. She was really close to Felicia. I think she's going to be too upset to take care of Dominick. And if she comes over and you're here with me, then \u0096",
        "Nick: It's what she wants.",
        "Brooke: I know. I just think that she needs my full attention tonight.",
        "[Car pulling up]",
        "Brooke: Oh, I hear I car. I think it's Bridget. I've got to go.",
        "Nick: Brooke -- I love you.",
        "Brooke: I love you, too.",
        "Nick: There's just one more thing I need to know, and it can't wait.",
        "[Phone clicking off]",
        "Nick: Brooke? Brooke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: Hey, let me take you home.",
        "Taylor: No, not there.",
        "Hector: You won't be alone. I'll stay with you.",
        "Taylor: I am not the one that needs consoling, okay? It's ridge. Ridge needs somebody. He had a really close relationship with his sister, okay? I just can't even imagine what he's going through. I have no idea what he's going through with no one to console him.",
        "Hector: You don't think Brooke would understand?",
        "Taylor: He isn't going to talk to Brooke.",
        "Hector: But they're married, Taylor.",
        "Taylor: No. No, they're not. Nick stopped the wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Oh, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Hey, Logan. Felicia died.",
        "Brooke: I know. I'm so sorry.",
        "Ridge: She was so brave. Gathering the family together. Wanting us all to take care of each other. To look after her little boy.",
        "Brooke: That must've been hard.",
        "Ridge: It was hardest on mother. She just wasn't willing to let go. Right up to the end, she was begging Felicia to keep on fighting.",
        "Brooke: Like any mother would.",
        "Ridge: The whole thing keeps replaying in my mind. The toasts for her, the champagne. Seeing her with little baby Dominick in her arms for the last time.",
        "Brooke: What can I do?",
        "Ridge: Just being here with you right now really helps me. Makes me feel a lot better. I'm gonna take a shower. Is that okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: Nick stopped the wedding?",
        "Taylor: I guess he grabbed her right off the altar.",
        "Hector: What's wrong with that guy?",
        "Taylor: Obviously, he still loves her, couldn't hide it anymore.",
        "Hector: Brooke is going to marry his brother. It's a little late in the game.",
        "Taylor: Maybe not.",
        "Hector: What are you saying?",
        "Taylor: I'm saying -- if Nick's marriage to Bridget is over, then maybe Brooke is having second thoughts about ever marrying Ridge.",
        "Hector: Sounds to me like you're the one who's having second thoughts. Taylor, you can't be thinking about a reconciliation. Not after the way Ridge has treated you.",
        "Taylor: Hey, if Brooke doesn't want him --",
        "Hector: That's the alcohol talking, okay? You have too much self-respect for that. Taylor, this isn't healthy. You have got to put Ridge behind you.",
        "Taylor: How? That man is the father of my children, okay. I've spent more than half my life with him. How do I put that behind me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Pop, what are you doing here?",
        "Massimo: I brought Ridge home.",
        "Nick: Where is he?",
        "Massimo: Where he's supposed to be. Unlike you.",
        "Nick: I need to talk to Brooke.",
        "Massimo: No, look, not tonight. Ridge lost his sister. He needs to be with his wife.",
        "Nick: She's not his wife.",
        "Massimo: She's going to be.",
        "Nick: She won't.",
        "Massimo: Damn it, just leave them alone.",
        "Nick: She's upstairs with him?",
        "Massimo: I assume they're in the bedroom. They haven't come down in quite a while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Feel better? It might help to talk about it.",
        "Ridge: I keep asking myself, is there something more I could have done? Something else I could have said?",
        "Brooke: I'm sure you said everything that you needed to.",
        "Ridge: You think I was a good brother to Felicia? You think she knew how much I loved her?",
        "Brooke: Of course she did. She adored you, Ridge. She admired you so much when she was growing up. The little, starry-eyed sister following her big brother around.",
        "Ridge: She was always hanging around. She was always there.",
        "[Ridge sighs]",
        "Brooke: And she will be. She'll always be right here, in your heart. I know it's painful. But Felicia is in a better place right now. And I'm here for you. I'm right here.",
        "Ridge: And I need you. I really, really need you. Does your ultra thin ever get wet and uncomfortable? Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Barkeep. Fill me up.",
        "Hector: She's okay for now, all right? Thank you, appreciate it. You don't need that.",
        "Taylor: I need my husband, I need my family. And if there's a chance I should take --",
        "Hector: At what cost, Taylor?",
        "Taylor: Ridge is the love of my life.",
        "Hector: But are you the love of his? Look, you've had a really bad day, okay? You thought Ridge and Brooke were getting married. You found out that Felicia died. You need to pull yourself together.",
        "Taylor: I need to talk to Ridge.",
        "Hector: Oh, Taylor. You have too much pride for that.",
        "Taylor: Oh, my god, what good is pride if you're not happy?",
        "Hector: Did Ridge make you happy?",
        "Taylor: Yes, he did, yeah, we had a great life together. This isn't about self-respect or pride. I don't care about that. I just -- I want my life back with Ridge. I want my husband back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Logan?",
        "Brooke: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Logan.",
        "Brooke: Look, I -- I think we're both exhausted. It's been an emotional day.",
        "Ridge: We should've been together.",
        "Brooke: I know. I know that you're very confused and upset.",
        "Ridge: Not with you.",
        "Brooke: You wanted an answer.",
        "Ridge: I wanted you. And now, I'm with you. There you are.",
        "Brooke: Well, I'm sure that you had some questions about Nick and the wedding.",
        "Ridge: Not now. No, not now.",
        "Brooke: We do have to talk about it.",
        "Ridge: Tomorrow. Tonight, I just want to lose myself in you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Massimo: Dominick, don't.",
        "Nick: Pop --",
        "Massimo: No, no, no, no. Look, you've already disrupted their wedding. What do you want to do now? You want to interfere in their honeymoon?",
        "Nick: We love each other. We're not going to deny it anymore. And we're not going to let anyone keep us apart.",
        "Massimo: Dominick, Brooke almost married Ridge today.",
        "Nick: But she didn't. And she's not going to.",
        "Massimo: All right, fine. Why hasn't Ridge come down? If she is so committed to you, Dominick, why does she stay up there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Logan, I just want to put this whole day behind me. Or forget everything. Just be with you. Love you.",
        "Brooke: I love you, too. And I hate seeing you in so much pain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Massimo: Don't go up there, Dominick.",
        "Nick: Man to man here, Pop. You gotta let me do what I gotta do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Ridge, this isn't going to take away your pain.",
        "Ridge: It'll help.",
        "Brooke: For a little while, maybe.",
        "Ridge: Right now, that's all I want, Logan."
