        "Phoebe pressures Rick to make love to her; it's not wrong and it's unfair for their parents to dictate to them. He puts on the brakes and she begs him not to. He tells her he loves her and he wants her special moment to be as perfect as she is. Despite more pressuring, he tells her they must leave the cabin, but he won't let anything happen to them. Nick enjoys the CD that Hope sent over and Jackie realizes he misses her terribly. She's delighted to hear that the Ridge/Brooke wedding might not take place. He nixes any plans she has of getting him back with Brooke. Suddenly she is embarrassed when Taylor comes downstairs and even more so when Taylor hints that she knows Jackie has fond feelings for Brooke and believes she is the one who can make her son happy. Brooke has words with Ridge, but doesn't believe this situation is as big a deal as he does. She tells him if he loves her, then he must love her son. They don't have to agree, but he must accept him.",
        "Rick explains that sneaking around was wrong and also sent Ridge the wrong message, that he didn't respect her. When she has doubts of their parents accepting this, he vows no matter what, he will never ever let her go. Nick tells Taylor to forget what his mother said, she really wasn't trying to start trouble. Ridge says it comes down to a difference in parenting styles, but he doesn't want that to interfere with their relationship. Rick calls Brooke and tells her they are fine, but it's over. Ridge is grateful that Brooke managed to get him to call it off. Thinking out loud, Phoebe vows that no matter what her dad says, she and Rick are NOT over."

        "Phoebe: Don't stop. I don't ever want you to stop.",
        "Rick: Phoebe --",
        "Phoebe: They're not coming back, Rick.",
        "Rick: What about what you told your dad?",
        "Phoebe: I know. But my father dictating to us how to live, and your mother telling you not to see me anymore -- it's not fair. I mean, especially when she doesn't even believe it's wrong to begin with. And it's not. Rick, it's not wrong. It's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I'm Hope, queen of the forest fairies. But you can only see me if your heart is full of love. Come close -- closer. Can you see me? Is your heart full of love? It is now!",
        "[Nick laughs]",
        "Jackie: You miss her, don't you?",
        "[Nick sighs]",
        "Jackie: Is that hope's school play?",
        "Nick: Yeah, Brooke brought the DVD by.",
        "Jackie: Well, what a pity you couldn't have been there in person. But of course, I suppose Ridge would've thrown a fit. How she could prefer that man to you, far less marry him again --",
        "Nick: Rumor has it the wedding may not take place.",
        "Jackie: Really? Brooke has seen the light?",
        "Nick: Take it easy, Mother. Stephanie's the one who's spreading the rumor.",
        "Jackie: Let me guess. She's back to hating Brooke again.",
        "Nick: Bingo.",
        "Jackie: So tell me, what has Brooke done to fall out of favor this time?",
        "Nick: Rick and Phoebe have a thing for each other. Brooke supports it, Ridge doesn't. I think there's a little friction there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I still think it was a mistake leaving Phoebe up at Big Bear. I should've insisted --",
        "Brooke: Please. We've been through that. They just need some time to talk.",
        "Ridge: I just wish I could trust that's all they were doing.",
        "Brooke: Sometimes that's all it comes down to, trusting.",
        "Ridge: Well, it'd be a lot easier to do if I hadn't been lied to. I still can't believe you knew they didn't break it off, and you didn't tell me. And don't say it's for lack of trying. Because if you really wanted to do it, you would have done it. Now we got all this tension to get through here. But believe me, it will be nothing compared to what it will be if Rick doesn't break it off with my daughter tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Phoebe --",
        "Phoebe: Don't --",
        "Rick: Phoebe --",
        "Phoebe: Don't say it.",
        "Rick: Somebody has to, honey. We just can't pretend that we weren't totally busted up here by your father.",
        "Phoebe: My dad shouldn't have followed us.",
        "Rick: What about what we did, Phoebe? Sneaking up here like this?",
        "Phoebe: I just want to love you. And for you to love me back. I know you want to. Hey -- I can see it in your eyes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: You do realize, of course, if this plays out the way that Stephanie's hoping it will, there could still be a chance for you and --",
        "Nick: Mother, I don't want to do this again.",
        "Jackie: Nicky --",
        "Nick: I mean it. Brooke is gone. What we had together is gone. There's no bringing it back, even if I wanted to. And I don't.",
        "Jackie: That's because you let Brooke and that precious little girl into your heart. And it hurt so much when you were forced to close it off. But don't you see that Brooke is never going to be totally out of your heart.",
        "Nick: Mother, that's a beautiful speech and I love you. But those are memories. That's all they are.",
        "Jackie: They don't have to be. Taylor? Oh, I didn't realize --",
        "Nick: Well, now you do. So let's drop it, shall we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Despite what you think -- if Jarrett and your mother hadn't interrupted, I would've told you the truth, right then and there. You're Phoebe's father. You have a right to know. But instead of jumping to conclusions that your daughter's life is headed towards catastrophe, at least allow the possibility that maybe she's smart enough and old enough to make decisions for herself.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, you didn't walk in on what I walked in on. You didn't see it. I just thank God I got there when I did.",
        "Brooke: Rick would never take advantage of a woman. Especially somebody as young and sweet and innocent as Phoebe.",
        "Ridge: My point exactly. Phoebe's just begun to live her life. Rick's already been married, divorced, been abroad. He's had all these adult experiences.",
        "Brooke: You make him sound like some irresponsible playboy.",
        "Ridge: No, I'm not saying that. Look, the point is, Phoebe's kind of into the idea of Rick right now. The experienced older man. It's a little exciting. A little enticing. Maybe even a little forbidden, due the fact they're related to each other.",
        "Brooke: Not by blood.",
        "Ridge: There are still very much family. The point is, first love for Phoebe, is not the same as having a relationship with a divorced man. That's why I'm drawing the line.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: What are you doing?",
        "Rick: I'm putting on the brakes. As much as I don't want to.",
        "Phoebe: Then don't.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, you deserve better than this. You deserve a perfect moment. Believe me, it would be so damn easy for me just -- just like any other girl. But you are not just like any other girl, Phoebe. You are so special to me. I love you. And I want your perfect moment, your perfect situation to be as special and as wonderful as you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: I'm terribly sorry. I didn't realize --",
        "Nick: I thought I'd mentioned that Taylor was going to recuperate here.",
        "Jackie: Well, yes. But I assumed that -- you're obviously feeling better.",
        "Taylor: Yes. Yes, I am. Thanks to your son.",
        "Jackie: Well, it's getting late. I should --",
        "Taylor: Oh, Jackie, listen, I want you to know I realize that you'll always have a special fondness for Brooke.",
        "Jackie: As I do for you, Taylor.",
        "Taylor: Yes, but I understand that evidently, you still believe that Brooke is the one who can make Nick happy.",
        "Jackie: I really am exhausted. I'll see you both in the morning.",
        "Nick: Don't forget that she is a mother. My mother.",
        "Taylor: It's okay. I'm a big girl. I understand that in Jackie's eyes, I'll never be as important to you as Brooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Ridge, I understand where you're coming from. I do. It's just --",
        "Ridge: You don't agree it's the big deal that I believe it is.",
        "Brooke: You love your daughter. And you want to do what's best for her. And you should. That's why I told Rick that he had to break it off with Phoebe once and for all. But it doesn't mean that if she gets involved with somebody else, a younger man maybe, that he would treat her any better than Rick would.",
        "Ridge: It's a crazy, crazy world out there, Logan. Kids are growing up far too fast nowadays. I'm just trying to protect my daughter from a lot of the mistakes that girls her age will make.",
        "Brooke: I know. That's because you are a caring and loving father. Of course you want to protect her. But you can't be there for her all the time. I understand that. I went through the same thing with Rick and Bridget. I mean, they certainly had their teenage angst years. But they made it through. And now, I couldn't be more proud of them. I want to get something straight here. If you love me, you have to love my son. Because he's a part of me. I don't want to perpetuate a family that's dysfunctional, the way that Stephanie did. No, you don't have to agree with the relationship between Rick and Phoebe, but you do have to accept my son. Do you think you can do that? For me? For us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Come on, let's go.",
        "Phoebe: No. Come on.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, Phoebe, you think I want to leave? I don't want to leave any more than you do. That is the last thing in the world I want to do right now. But we are in an impossible situation. Everywhere we turn, our family's are telling us not to be together.",
        "Phoebe: Not your mother. I mean, Brooke said that she'd give us a chance.",
        "Rick: She's afraid.",
        "Phoebe: For herself.",
        "Rick: That's not fair.",
        "Phoebe: Rick, nothing about this is fair. I mean, my God, one minute you're telling me that you love me, and the next, what, we can't be together?",
        "Rick: No, honey, sweetheart -- sweetheart, that is not what I'm saying here. What I'm saying is that I just feel that we need to cool down for our family's sake.",
        "Phoebe: Cool down?",
        "Rick: And it will. It will. Phoebe, honey, listen to me. We're going to be just fine, okay? We're going to be okay. I'm not going to let anything happen to us. I won't.",
        "Rick: Look, sneaking around behind your father's back -- not only was it wrong, but it sent him the wrong message. Like I didn't respect you. So we need to show him that we are adults in this situation. Adults who are capable of controlling their emotions and making the right decisions about their lives. Even if that means that --",
        "Phoebe: We can't be together? Rick, how do we do that?",
        "Rick: I know it's going to be hard.",
        "Phoebe: My dad -- what if he never comes around though? I mean, what do we do then?",
        "Rick: I don't know. But, you know what I do know? Is that no matter what, I will never let you go. Ever. You better go. And head down this mountain. I'll follow you in my car, okay?",
        "Phoebe: I'm going to stick around for a minute. I need a minute, but go. I'll be fine.",
        "Rick: Phoebe --",
        "Phoebe: I'll be fine.",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Come on, forget about what my mother said. She wasn't trying to stir up trouble, I promise.",
        "Taylor: I know. I know. Listen, I think I better go change and need to be heading home.",
        "Nick: Wait. Come on. Don't let her scare you away, please.",
        "Taylor: I'm not. I'm not. It's just that -- you know, I can't shake this feeling there's something going on with Phoebe, and I really feel like I need to be there for her. It's a mother thing. You understand?",
        "Nick: I understand.",
        "Ridge: I guess it all comes down to a difference in parenting styles. But I don't want that to put stress on our relationship any more than it already has.",
        "Brooke: Neither do I. And quite frankly, I wish I didn't have to go Australia to oversee the opening of our new store. Rick and Phoebe are going to need our support, especially after tonight. [Phone rings] Hello?",
        "Rick: Hey, Mom, it's me. I'm just getting ready to leave Big Bear.",
        "Brooke: Is everything all right?",
        "Rick: Yeah. Yeah, Phoebe and I had a long talk. We know how it has to be now.",
        "Brooke: Honey, I'm sorry. I wish it could be a different way.",
        "Rick: I know. I know, Mom. You tried. I'll see you at work tomorrow, okay?",
        "Brooke: Bye.",
        "Ridge: Is it over?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, he said that they were fine. But I'm sure it's going to be difficult for both of them.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm very grateful that you convinced Rick to back off. Thank you. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: I don't care what you say, Dad. Rick and I are not over."
