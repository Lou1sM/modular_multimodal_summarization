        "Brooke: Tell me this isn't what it looks like. Please, tell me there's another explanation. Nick, tell me, you and Taylor weren't about to \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: There you are. We were beginning to worry.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I had things I had to care of. Where's your father?",
        "Bridget: He's upstairs, calling Kristen, telling her about Felicia.",
        "Stephanie: Oh. Well, I wish he hadn't done that.",
        "Bridget: Did you want to tell her yourself?",
        "Stephanie: Where's the baby?",
        "Dante: Oh, he's right here, waiting for his grandma.",
        "Stephanie: Hello. Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello. Hello.",
        "Dante: I'm so sorry, Mrs. Forrester.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you, Dante. There's nothing to be sorry about. When I look at you, old squiggle puss, I see your mother's face.",
        "Dante: I know it may feel like Dominick's all you have left of your daughter.",
        "Stephanie: No, I don't feel that way at all. I haven't lost Felicia. She's still with us in every way that counts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Not so fast, lady. You're not going anywhere until you give me a straight answer. Did you see her? Do you know where she went? Damn it, Jackie, answer me! What's going on here?",
        "Jackie: Would you please let go of my arm.",
        "Ridge: You know more than you're saying.",
        "Jackie: And you are obviously very distraught.",
        "Ridge: Well, I don't know why I would be, Jackie. Your son threw my wedding into chaos, then my little sister died tonight. And now Brooke has gone somewhere, and I don't know where. And you're standing here pretending like you don't know anything about any of this, and I know damn well you do. Where is my wife?!",
        "Jackie: She's not your wife.",
        "Ridge: Where is she?!",
        "Jackie: God, Brooke went out.",
        "Ridge: Out? What do you mean out? This is our wedding night.",
        "Jackie: Well, it obviously isn't, is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: My god. The two of you were --",
        "Nick: No.",
        "Taylor: No, no.",
        "[Nick mumbles]",
        "Brooke: You're drunk. You both are. So this is your excuse? You get intoxicated, and you can do whatever the hell you want?",
        "Nick: Well, what about you, huh? What's your excuse? This is wrong, but what you do is okay, is that it?",
        "Brooke: Nick --",
        "Nick: What? What? I came over to your house with these great expectations, and I found you in bed with Forrester.",
        "Brooke: Ridge just lost his sister. He was a wreck. He came over for my support, and I gave it to him.",
        "Nick: Did you ever.",
        "Brooke: He was in pain. I was comforting him.",
        "Nick: Did you have sex with him?",
        "Brooke: No. No, I wouldn't do that because of my feelings for you.",
        "Nick: Well, you shouldn't have been in bed with him!",
        "Brooke: And this? This?! Oh, god, forget it. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Nick: Hey, we will talk about this now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: You are your mother's pride and joy.",
        "Dante: And his dad's, too. I hope Felicia knew that. I hope Felicia knew that I only want the best for Dominick.",
        "Stephanie: You're a sweet and decent man, Dante. But I'll tell you a little secret -- there are some things that only a mother can give a child.",
        "Dante: Well, that's why I'm so glad I won't be doing this alone. You know, even though Felicia's not with us, it's a relief to know that Bridget always will be. Dominick will always be a Forrester, if that's what you're concerned about.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you. That's very reassuring.",
        "Bridget: That's not exactly what you were getting at, is it? It seems like there's something else going on. Did Felicia ask you to do something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: It would have been our wedding night tonight if Popeye hadn't interfered.",
        "Jackie: Nicky did what he had to do.",
        "Ridge: Nicky is delusional. And so are you if you think he ever had a chance with Brooke.",
        "Jackie: My son loves Brooke deeply, which he's proven time and time and again by being there for her when you weren't.",
        "Ridge: Because I had a family -- another family that I just couldn't turn my back on.",
        "Jackie: You're just making excuses. You deserted Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Oh, and Nick was perfectly happy stepping into that place, wasn't he? Telling her everything she needed to hear. Oh, never mind, he was involved with her daughter. You've kind of conveniently forgotten that, haven't you?",
        "Jackie: You're just making things up.",
        "Ridge: I'm not making anything up, Jackie, and you're doing exactly what you always do. You're defending your loser son when you should be consoling him, because Brooke chose me.",
        "Jackie: Well, that isn't official. You're not husband and wife.",
        "Ridge: It doesn't change the fact that she made her decision. Brooke and I were in bed tonight, Jackie, starting our life together. And now, Brooke's suddenly disappeared. Hmm, and here you are. It wouldn't surprise me at all if you and nick were in cahoots about all this. Oh, I'm sure you're gonna try and deny it, aren't you? But if you are, Captain Bly is planning to kidnap Brooke and sail off to the south seas, I can promise you Jackie, I will personally organize the mutiny on his bounty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: First of all, this has nothing to do with her.",
        "Brooke: That woman was in your bed, Nick.",
        "Nick: Well, Forrester was in your bed, but you told me that that was misleading, that I misread that. Well the same thing goes here. And let's not forget about why I came over to your house. I came over because I wanted to look you in eye, and I wanted to tell you that I love you. And I wanted to ask you if you want to have a life together. And I opened your bedroom door, and I got my answer.",
        "Brooke: So you run straight over to your brother's ex-wife? My god, Nick, don't you think if I decided to stay with Ridge, I would've told you first?",
        "Nick: I saw what I saw.",
        "Brooke: I know what you saw.",
        "Nick: Is that why you came? You came here because you wanted to tell me what? Why are you here, Brooke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: The number of things that Felicia ever asked me to do I could count on one hand. Mostly, she just wanted me to stay out of her life.",
        "Bridget: That sounds like Felicia. She's such a free spirit. She definitely lived life on her own terms. The most important thing was she knew how much you loved her. She knew that you would have done anything to save her, anything she ever asked you to do. But you respected her, and you honored her, honored her wishes. Oh, Stephanie, I'm sorry. I'm just talking too much. I'm not helping.",
        "Stephanie: No, no, no. No, you're not. You're being your usual, wonderful self.",
        "Bridget: You know what? You should -- you should be with her. I'm sure she would come over here if I just called her and asked her --",
        "Stephanie: Oh, no, don't do -- no. You know, you're right. I think I will go see Taylor. I'm gonna drive myself, because I could use the time to be alone. Your mother loves you. Look at that. Go to your daddy. Take good care of that baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: We will. Hey, this little guy had a long day.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, I should probably take him home and put him to bed, huh?",
        "Dante: Well, actually, I was wondering if he could stay with me tonight.",
        "Bridget: Oh --",
        "Dante: If that's okay with you.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, of course. He should be with his father.",
        "Dante: Well, you're welcome to come with us, since this is gonna be our first night together.",
        "Bridget: No. You'll be fine. He'll be fine. You both will. And if anything happens, please call me. I'm just a phone call away.",
        "Dante: You know, it doesn't have to be this way, you know? Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pressure you. It's just, I can't help hoping that someday, we'll be raising this kid together, like his mom wanted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I'm waiting. Why are you here?",
        "Brooke: Did you kiss her?",
        "Nick: No.",
        "Brooke: Did she kiss you?",
        "Nick: I'm not sure. Did you?",
        "Taylor: No, we didn't.",
        "Brooke: Really? Then what was it, Taylor? I know you've found yourself in a lot of compromising positions lately. Did you just figure that your little halo is so tarnished that any man was fair game? Or were you so angry with Ridge for leaving you that you decided to just stick it to him?!",
        "Taylor: Oh, grow up.",
        "Nick: Hey, we had a little too much to drink, and we were comforting each other. But of course, you know how that is.",
        "Brooke: Oh, stop it, nick! Maybe you would have put on the brakes, and maybe not. But I just can't believe that you could be doing this! God, I'm out of here.",
        "Taylor: No, no, I'm the one who's out. Listen, Brooke, I just don't want you to say anything to anybody, okay? I didn't mean to cause a problem between the two of you. I really didn't. And I just want you to think about the sake of my children. Don't say anything. I'm begging you, don't say anything to Ridge, please.",
        "Nick: I went over to Chuck's to get really drunk. I didn't know she was there, and she came over to me.",
        "Brooke: So she was in so much pain that instead of commiserating over drinks, you both came here to the Marlin. I just don't get it, Nick. You're divorcing my daughter, and then you stop my wedding because you wanted to tell me how much you love me and how much you want to spend the rest of your life with me. And then I find you here, drunk with Taylor, in your bed.",
        "Nick: Well, I guess we've both been to bed tonight, haven't we?",
        "Brooke: You know, I never thought that you would hurt me. I never thought that you would let me down. But tonight, you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cab driver: Let me help you inside.",
        "Taylor: No, I'm fine.",
        "Cab driver: You sure? You don't look so --",
        "Taylor: I just need to find -- money.",
        "Cab driver: It's okay, lady. Chuck took care of it, remember? Chuck gave me your keys.",
        "Taylor: Thanks, Benere. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: You're overreacting, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I doubt it, Jackie.",
        "Jackie: Brooke is fine -- better than fine.",
        "Ridge: Meaning you know where she is. Damn it, Jackie, quit playing games here and just tell me.",
        "Jackie: I assure you, I am not playing games. And neither was my son when he was here earlier.",
        "Ridge: Nick was here?",
        "Jackie: Yes. Apparently, he saw you and Brooke in her bedroom together. At least, that's what it looked like to Nicky.",
        "Ridge: Well, well, well. So he got an eyeful, did he? Good. Good. Maybe he'll finally get it through his thick skull that Brooke loves me.",
        "Jackie: But that's not all. When Brooke came downstairs, and I told her what had happened, she was horrified. She said that Nick had misinterpreted.",
        "Ridge: Misinterpreted? Brooke made a decision tonight.",
        "Jackie: Yes, Ridge, she did. And that's why she's with my son right now. She's with the man that I believe she wants to spend the rest of her life with. I'm afraid it's you that's misinterpreted. You've just lost your sister. I'm so sorry about that. Felicia was a gutsy young woman. She didn't deserve to die so young. But Brooke -- Brooke assured me, Ridge, she was just comforting you, which is why she raced out of here. She raced out of here, Ridge, to tell Nicky that that is all it was.",
        "Ridge: Lady, you're as crazy as your son. Brooke and I were gonna make love tonight. I didn't misinterpret anything, Jackie. But you sure as hell did if you doubt that Brooke wants to be with me. If Brooke did go to see Nick, it was to let him down easy. But I guarantee you, she is coming back to see me here tonight, no matter how much wishful thinking you and your son do, Jackie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Taylor? Thomas? Is anybody home? Oh, my god, Taylor. Taylor. Oh, my god, are you all right? Taylor? Taylor, are you ill? Honey, what's the matter? What is it? Taylor, come here. Is this about Felicia? Are -- are you okay?",
        "Taylor: You don't understand.",
        "Stephanie: I see you've had a little too much to drink, honey.",
        "Taylor: Well, yeah. Don't hate me.",
        "Stephanie: Why would I hate you, Taylor, if you've had just a little too much to drink? Has something happened? Are you all right? Tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I've let you down?",
        "Brooke: Which you promised you never would. But you did. And I trusted you, even above Ridge, and now --",
        "[Phone rings] Brooke: It's Ridge.",
        "Nick: Give me that. This isn't happening again. And you have no room to throw stones, young lady. Now we have two choices. We can let what happened tonight tear us apart, or we suck it up, and we start our life together. What's it gonna be?."
