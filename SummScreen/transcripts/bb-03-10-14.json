        "Hope and Wyatt are enjoying themselves in the steam room. He's kissing her on the lips, on the neck, on the legs, forearms until she keeps telling him they have to go to a meeting ..the last thing on his mind. Finally he lets her up as he thinks back on their HOTT trip. Brooke tells Ridge that she has no idea what is wrong with her sister for her to think that she has a future with him. He really needs to set her straight. She turns to Katie and says Ridge is not leaving her for Katie. Katie obviously has a crush on him but he's not going to leave her so he needs to tell Katie that. He says he is sorry but Katie is telling the truth. Brooke is shocked and says okay this is a bad joke at her expense and maybe she deserves it. They can have a little laugh and then move on. Katie tells her it is not a joke. So Brooke says okay then they are having an affair and sleeping together. Katie says no, they did not want to hurt Brooke. Brooke guesses this must be a way to get back at Bill. Brooke says she has apologized a thousand times but now Katie is doing the exact same thing. Ridge says no this is different. It is nothing like with her and Bill. Brooke says he is breaking up their family and running off with her sister. She will not allow that. Katie says this has nothing to do with revenge. She tells Brooke that she fought this for so long as she did not want to do the same thing that Brooke did. Ridge says nobody went after nobody. It just happened. And he's very happy to have Katie in his life. He knows it is a shock but Brooke is gonna have to accept it. Brooke keeps saying it is crazy. Katie says she would say that as no man would want Katie after being with Brooke. Brooke says no, she will never accept this ever. Aly tells Pam that Wyatt and Quinn are bad news and she thinks that Pam knows that too. She says she saw her with Quinn just now and noticed her body language. She has also seen how she is around Wyatt. She is suspicious and she has a right to be. They are sneaky and it's all about money and ambition. They should not be around here contaminating Hope. Pam reminds her that Hope loves Quinn's jewelry and she's in a relationship now with Wyatt. Aly tells her that she doesn't have to be involved. Just give Aly the ammunition and she'll run with it. Wyatt and Hope walk in and Hope asks if they are intruding. Aly is curt and says it doesn't matter. Hope won't hear it as he won't let her hear. Pam tries to break it up by saying the others will be here soon for the meeting. Quinn and Eric join in and Eric says Caroline and Rick are on the way. When Quinn can't get Pam to get her a cup of coffee, she ends up pouring one for her and Pam and gives it to her .since she is such a nice person. Eric tells them that Ridge and Brooke won't be here today. They had some personal business. Wyatt gives a little mini presentation about Stephanie's jewelry and says they need to follow up the diamond with more buzz worthy success .stunning, elegant and classy. Eric says Stephanie would have loved that. Wyatt says he would love to display them at the Boutique and then take the collection around the world like a famous art exhibit.",
        "Everyone thinks it is a terrific idea except Aly. She speaks up and says it is a terrible idea. Eric asks her to explain. She says her grandmother's collection is not a sideshow. It's private and personal. Wyatt is all about buzz and sales figures. She thinks it is disgraceful and undignified to put them on display. Pam speaks up and says she agrees. Aly continues that Wyatt just wants to get his name out there so people can gush what a hero he is. Wyatt says these are works of art and art should be shared. Pam says that she thinks Stephanie would be mortified but besides that they have already had one attempted heist so who's to say now they won't really be an easy target. Aly continues that she is not surprised that Wyatt would want to do this and turn it into the publicity stunt of the month. But he if he really cares for Hope, he will take his mother and go back to their little warehouse and leave all of them alone. Brooke says she can not even wrap her head around this. Katie says they tried to pretend that it wasn't happening. Brooke cries so she is now losing Ridge to her sister. Hope tries to calm Aly down and says she knows where she is coming from. She knows she is trying to protect the family, but she does not like her attitude. She points out that Wyatt has come up with a concept that will help the line. And they are in a relationship so he's going nowhere and Aly needs to accept that. Aly says she is part of this team and the family too so she has a right to her opinion. Eric tells her duly noted. Wyatt says they have all stated their opinion but ultimately the decision is up to Eric. Brooke repeats her baby sister \u0096 the one with morals and values and principals .everything that Brooke isn't. Ridge says people change. Brooke states that she refuses to believe that he doesn't love her. Ridge says he does love her. He will always love her. And he doesn't regret one moment with her but he's not that man anymore. He doesn't want to be wildly addicted to someone and wonder what is going to happen next. Brooke begs Ridge not to do this, not to break up their family. She knows she hurt them and now he is getting back at her. She wants to speak with Katie alone. Ridge tells her that won't change anything."

        "Hope: We're gonna be late for the meeting.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Right.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Hope: You don't care that we're gonna be late for the meeting.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I do. I do.",
        "Hope: Okay. Seriously.",
        "Wyatt: No. Mnh-mnh.",
        "Hope: Uh-huh. We have to go.",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: I knew you were gonna say that.",
        "Hope: We have to go put our clothes back on. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.",
        "Hope: Come on. I believe in you. You can do this.",
        "Wyatt: Come on. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I really don't know what's wrong with my sister for her to think that there's a possibility of a future relationship for the two of you. You really need to set her straight. Ridge is not leaving me for you. We have a family. We're going to be together. Tell her, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: That was my intention.",
        "Brooke: Katie obviously has a crush on you, but he is not going to return those feelings. Tell her!",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. Katie's telling the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Wyatt and Quinn are bad news. You know it, too.",
        "Pam: Well, did I say that? I don't -- I don't think I said that.",
        "Aly: With Quinn just now. I saw your body language. And I've seen how you look at Wyatt, like you're suspicious. And you're right to be. I don't like them either. They're sneaky. All about money and their own ambition. They shouldn't be around here, contaminating Hope.",
        "Pam: Yes, but Hope loves Quinn's jewelry, and she's in a relationship with Wyatt.",
        "Aly: That is why it is so important to expose these people for who they really are. They're everywhere -- in Hope's business, her personal life. Look, you don't have to get involved. Just give me the ammunition, and I'll run with it. Tell me what you know about Quinn and Wyatt, for Hope's sake.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: Bad time?",
        "Hope: What's -- what's going on, guys? Aly, are you -- are you okay?",
        "Aly: I'm fine.",
        "Hope: Anything you want to talk about?",
        "Aly: What difference would it make? You don't listen. He won't let you hear.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. Once more with feeling, shall we?",
        "Pam: Uh, how about we not do this right now? The others are gonna be coming in soon for a meeting. Ah. Perfect timing.",
        "Quinn: Hey.",
        "Eric: Rick and Caroline are on their way.",
        "Quinn: Mm. And I could really use a cup of coffee. Pam?",
        "Pam: Quinn... meet pot.",
        "Quinn: Eric?",
        "Eric: No, thanks. I'm fine.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Pam: You know, actually, I-I wouldn't mind one.",
        "Quinn: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Pam: Well, you're standing right there. Would it kill you?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] You know what? Since I am such a nice person... anybody else?",
        "Aly: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Eric: No thanks.",
        "Hope: Thanks.",
        "Pam: Thank you.",
        "Quinn: There you go.",
        "Rick: Yet another presentation. Do you ever stop working?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you know, I take the occasional moment.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] That's my son -- always thinking two steps ahead.",
        "Eric: Exactly what we need around here.",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm. Got to stay cutting edge.",
        "Eric: We're positioned really beautifully with this team. It's a pleasure to come to work with all of you every day.",
        "Quinn: Mm. How can we miss? I mean, this environment is so conducive to creativity.",
        "Hope: Oh, yeah. I think we can all agree on that.",
        "Rick: Where's Mom and Ridge?",
        "Eric: They won't be joining us today. They're taking care of something personal that needed to be taken care of right away. If it was business, I wouldn't mind so much, but this personal stuff gets in the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: This is all a bad joke. Right? You're just having a little fun at my expense. It's okay. Maybe I deserve it. So let's just have a little laugh and move on.",
        "Katie: It's not a joke, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: So you're... sleeping together? You're having an affair?",
        "Ridge: No, we're not.",
        "Katie: Neither one of us wanted to hurt you.",
        "Brooke: This is crazy. Is it because of Bill? You're doing this because of Bill?",
        "Katie: You know I'm not vindictive like that.",
        "Brooke: Katie, I apologized a thousand times. I'm sorry for what happened with Bill. But you're doing the exact same thing.",
        "Ridge: It's not the same thing. Our relationship is nothing like with you and Bill.",
        "Brooke: How can you say that? It is! You're breaking up our family, and you're running off with my sister. I am not going to allow this. I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: We need to follow up the success of the Hope for the Future diamond with something even more buzz worthy. This is it, the Stephanie Forrester collection. Stunning, classic, elegant. It'll even make broaches hip and edgy again.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] Stephanie would love that.",
        "Wyatt: It could happen. Have Hope here wear a few of these, and I am telling you it will drive people to Forrester. That's the point of displaying this collection, is taking it into all kinds of new directions.",
        "Hope: Well, what I love is that it pays tribute to Stephanie. She's the matriarch. She's the co-founder of this company.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. I would love to display this jewelry at the Beverly Hills boutique, just like we did with the diamond, but with an eye toward taking that collection around the world, like a famous art exhibit.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. And -- and that's what these pieces are -- works of art. People should see them.",
        "Caroline: I mean, I could fast-track a couple of designs, you know, and have Hope wear them at the store. We would have to work production around the clock, though.",
        "Rick: Whatever you need.",
        "Caroline: I'm just thinking like... three or four outfits, kind of a teaser for the next Hope for the Future rollout.",
        "Eric: This jewelry could work very well for couture, as well.",
        "Rick: I'll make a note for Ridge.",
        "Wyatt: Well, we don't want to lose momentum. If we're gonna do this, we should probably get to it as soon as possible.",
        "Aly: I'm sorry, but I have to say it. This is a terrible idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You think this is going to happen, that I'm going to let it happen? We have a son together... our little boy, who wants his parents together, not you with my sister. What is this, Katie's ultimate revenge?",
        "Katie: Oh, God! This has nothing to do with revenge! You want to know the truth? I fought my feelings for as long as I possibly could because I didn't want to hurt you the way you hurt me. I didn't want to be the woman who stole your husband away. I didn't want to be you.",
        "Brooke: You are going after Ridge.",
        "Ridge: No one's going after anybody. It just happened.",
        "Brooke: You know how absurd that sounds?",
        "Ridge: What's absurd, that I would have feelings for your sister?",
        "Brooke: Yes!",
        "Ridge: No! I'm very lucky to have her in my life.",
        "Brooke: What about our life, Ridge? What about the life that we were putting back together? We were having R.J. come back from boarding school and living with us and starting our life over. And now you're saying this! [Sighs] You know what's crazy? It's crazy that you are imagining some romance with Katie. There's something wrong with that.",
        "Katie: Because no man could ever want me after he's been with you, right?",
        "Ridge: I know this is a shock, and I know it's gonna hurt you, but... you're gonna have to accept it.",
        "Brooke: No, I'm never gonna accept this. Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: What are your concerns, Aly?",
        "Aly: Stephanie's jewelry collection isn't a sideshow. It's private, personal. Wyatt's all about buzz and sales figures. He doesn't care about the emotional value these pieces have to our family. Well, I do. And I think it's disrespectful and undignified to put them on display.",
        "Pam: Eric? I agree.",
        "Aly: Wyatt, you just want to get your name out there so people can gush about what a hero you are... and Hope can be impressed.",
        "Wyatt: Believe it or not, I couldn't care less about personal publicity unless it benefited the line, of course. But putting this collection on display would only be good for business.",
        "Aly: Forrester Creations is a family-run company with established values to uphold. Plus, is this really what Stephanie would want? Her personal possessions on display for people to gawk and point?",
        "Wyatt: These pieces are works of art. And art needs to be shared. Showing this collection wouldn't detract from the Forrester reputation. It would only add to the legend. It would put the essence of the family right there for people to see and admire -- the style, the elegance, the grace that is synonymous with this Forrester name.",
        "Aly: You don't know my family well enough to speak to its grace and elegance.",
        "Pam: I have to say, I have real concerns about this idea, too.",
        "Eric: Pam, what are they?",
        "Pam: Well, first of all, um, I agree with Aly in that I think that Stephanie would be mortified. But that being said, there's another issue that I think is really important. Steph's jewelry is irreplaceable. So we've already had an attempted jewel heist at the Beverly Hills store. Who's to say that people won't think that we're an easy target now and just try it again?",
        "Wyatt: Well, obviously I can't predict what the jewel thieves were thinking, but I will do everything in my power to make sure that they are safe.",
        "Pam: Well, yes, but didn't you do that last time? And [Chuckles] Look what happened. And then also, safe from whom, Wyatt?",
        "Aly: Look, it's just a bad idea. But I'm not surprised. You're an awful influence around here. You have taken a line that was inspirational and turned it into the publicity stunt of the month, trashed everything Hope ever stood for.",
        "Hope: Aly!",
        "Aly: No, it's true. Wyatt, if you really care about Hope, take your mother, go back to your warehouse, and leave us alone.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I can't even wrap my head around this. How are you in love with my sister?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. It just happened. I was concerned for Katie. And she opened up to me about the pain she was in and... the more time we spent together, the more I-I saw her clearly, maybe -- maybe for the first time. And we got close.",
        "Katie: We tried to pretend it wasn't happening.",
        "Brooke: So I'm...I'm losing you... [Sniffles] ...To my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Aly...I get where you're coming from. I really do. I know that you're trying to protect me and you're trying to protect this family... but I don't like your attitude. Wyatt has come up with ideas that have brought Hope for the Future more success than we've ever had. He's an integral part to this team, and we're in a relationship. He's not going anywhere, and I really wish that you'd accept that.",
        "Aly: Well, I'm part of this team, too, and this family. I have the right to express my opinion.",
        "Hope: Fair enough.",
        "Eric: Duly noted. Wyatt, anything else?",
        "Wyatt: No. Uh... I have stated my case. Aly's certainly stated hers. But it's not up to either one of us. Hope, this is your line. Rick, you're the executive in charge. But ultimately the decision is yours, right, Eric?",
        "Rick: What do you say, Dad?",
        "Hope: The collection belongs to you, so we'll do whatever you say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: My baby sister... with values and morals and principles. Everything I'm not, right?",
        "Ridge: Hey. There was a time when we were everything to each other. People change, you know.",
        "Brooke: I refuse to believe you don't love me.",
        "Ridge: I do love you. I will always love you. And I wouldn't want to give up one moment that we spent together. But I'm not that man anymore. I don't want to be wildly addicted to someone... trying to figure out what's gonna happen next.",
        "Brooke: So you think the answer is Katie? The two of you only have a common ground because of your disappointment in me.",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Brooke: Don't do this, Ridge. Don't give up our family and everything that we built because of this. I know what you're doing. I hurt you, and this is your way of getting me back. Well... it's a good way of doing it. [Sighs] I need to talk to my sister alone.",
        "Ridge: Nothing's gonna change, Brooke.",
        "Katie: Go ahead. Say whatever you need to say.",
        "Brooke: I am not letting you get away with this."
