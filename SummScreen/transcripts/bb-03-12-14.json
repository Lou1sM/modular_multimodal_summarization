        "Wyatt and Hope are locked in a kiss in her office while Aly is lurking with the door ajar. He mentions locking the door but Hope blows that off. They share a few more kisses but she tells him he will be late for his meeting. He doesn't want to go but finally does. Charlie and Pam have their heads huddled talking about Aly when Quinn walks up and Pam tells Charlie diva alert. Quinn tells Charlie that she can see him watching her. He says it is his job. She offers that he is supposed to keep criminals out of the building not his eyes on trusted employees. Pam quips then it is too bad Charlie wasn't here the day she and Wyatt turned up at FC. Quinn says if they knew what was good for them they would keep their opinions to themselves. Aly is lurking and waits until Quinn leaves and Pam is called away from her desk. Aly approaches Charlie and casually mentions things would be better if she did not have to run into Quinn and Wyatt every time she turned around. Pam must confide in him; she's like to know what he knows about Wyatt. Pam told her everything. Charlie is surprised that Pam told Aly. Aly says it's because she got so worked up at the meeting the new campaign of Wyatt's, how he has changed Hope. He's destroying her reputation. Can Charlie imagine if people knew just how bad Wyatt really is. Charlie says yes, it is the charming ones you really have to look out for. You get comfortable and then let your guard down. He did not know he was going to have to look out for the guy that brought the diamond into Forrester. Aly rants \u0096 stupid diamond, that's when everything changed, Hope's line, her message. All that mattered to Wyatt was more publicity. Charlie smarts that yeah that is all that matters. Doesn't matter what happened to him when Wyatt's precious diamond goes missing for a couple of hours. Doesn't matter that Charlie was standing there by an empty display case looking like an idiot .Charlie's reputation and career toast while Wyatt slipped that hot rock in his pocket. Aly says no, Wyatt can not get away with this. Wyatt needs to learn that actions have consequences. Charlie agrees but Wyatt got all the consequences he wanted by landing HFTF right on the front page. Aly says but it was a lie, the thieves were arrested and made Wyatt look like a hero. They agree that Wyatt didn't want Hope to know or she'd recognize him for the con artist that he is. Aly says not only is Wyatt selfish and corrupt but he's a criminal and criminals deserve to be punished for the bad things they do. Wyatt tells Quinn that something has got her all worked up. He asks if Aly is throwing more shade. Quinn says it is Pam and her bumbling boyfriend. They are acting like the Fullers are here to take the petty cash when in actuality the company has made big profits since they have been here. Wyatt says she better not say that or Aly will just add it to all the other stuff she holds against them. Quinn tells him that she doesn't want him to waste one more minute worrying about that. The line is great; his idea was great, he and Hope are perfectly happy and nobody is going to interfere with any of that. He tells her he wants this promotion to be flawless. Hope is depending on him and he wants to show her that he can do this the right way. This is the Stephanie Forrester collection. It can't feel like a publicity stunt. Quinn says he is putting too much pressure on himself just thinking what Aly said in the meeting. But Eric knew Stephanie better than anyone and he thinks it is a great idea. Wyatt claims this has to be powerful. It has to have integrity and substance, no stunts. There are three people in the building gunning for them and he hopes they can win them over. She says she hopes so too but that Aly is trouble. He says she knows firsthand what kind of damage she can do. Quinn says she is like a high school girl with a crush. He says but her last name is Forrester and social media could make it news, the kind they don't want. Wyatt says he promised Hope no controversy. He doesn't think Aly knows anything. Quinn points out that Aly has been snooping around like a bad junior detective and if she gets a hint at anything she will not let it go. She reminds him that he almost lost his relationship with Hope over the diamond and she does not want to see that happen again.",
        "Liam surprises Hope when he stops by. He says he saw Wyatt leave so he thought he might have a few minutes alone with her. He'd heard she was back in town. She says yes and she was going to call him. He asks about her mom and if Hope is sorry that he told her. She says no, not at all. She is glad they can talk and be honest with each other even when it is hard to talk about. He says he is glad she feels that way as he has a few things to say about Wyatt. She says they are not living together. They are taking it slow. He says he is sorry. He'd just as soon she get this over as soon as possible. He says Mexico, Hawaii, Paris that is all fun but sooner or later she is going to want somebody who can give her more than headlines and diamonds \u0091cause everything Wyatt does is for effect and that has served him well but his luck will run out eventually. He tells her that Wyatt is not who she thinks he is and he does not deserve her. Hope says she is happy and she wishes he could be happy for her. He is beginning to sound like Aly. Liam is delighted to know Aly shares his views on Wyatt. Hope says she is sorry that Aly is disappointed in her but she is very proud of what she and Wyatt have accomplished. Aly is just caught in the past. She's upset that Hope is dating Wyatt and not with Liam. Liam laughs that he can't blame her; he's a little irked about that himself. He says but what really gets him is that Wyatt doesn't get her like he does. He brings out the new edition to Eye On Fashion looking at the new generation of style makers. Hope is surprised and impressed that it is a tribute to her. She knows Liam wrote that and she touches him on the face as thanks. He says everybody loves a good comeback story. Wyatt did not save her collection and neither did the diamond. Hope did by her choices that brought it back better than ever. Aly is lurking again and hears him say that Hope doesn't give herself enough credit but that is okay as he is going to be here to make sure she does. Liam leaves Hope's office and goes to see Wyatt in \"the big man's office\". Wyatt says they just finished a meeting and Liam may be subtle but he doesn't mind if he spoke with Hope. Liam says right as he's not the jealous type. Wyatt says not over Liam he is not. Liam retorts that right now Hope thinks Wyatt is some sort of savior pulling her line back from the brink. Wyatt says more than that, he pulled her back from Liam. She could have been married to him by now. He says he is very grateful to be part of this company and Hope in his life. Liam says he ought to be it's turned out just the way he and his mother hoped it would. And it would be one thing if he came about it honestly, but karma is a funny thing. Wyatt says that is too bad as he does not believe in karma. Liam says he does not trust Wyatt and apparently he is not the only one who feels that way .Wyatt's mask is slipping and it's only a matter of time before his lack of integrity catches up with him. Charlie tells Pam that they need to talk. They had agreed not to keep secrets so how could she let Aly in on their secret. Aly charges into Hope's office and says she was right about Wyatt and everything. Hope says they talked about this and Eric was very clear. And she know Aly doesn't like it but what she and Wyatt do is their business. Aly blurts out that Wyatt is a thief and responsible for the diamond heist. They can not let him get away with this. It was a crime and he lied to the police and the insurance company. Hope should be the one to tell them or else they may think she was involved. She starts to call the police and Hope tells her to put down the phone. She is not going to tell anyone. She is not going to say a word."

        "Aly: Be a whole lot better if I didn't have to run into Quinn and Wyatt every time I turn around. Listen, I can be honest with you, can't I? Pam must talk to you about this stuff, too.",
        "Charlie: What stuff?",
        "Aly: About Wyatt. She told me what he did.",

        "Quinn: [Sighs] Pam and that bumbling boyfriend of hers.",
        "Wyatt: Charlie?",
        "Quinn: They act like we're out to steal the petty cash. Forrester has made big profits since we've been here.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, no, no. Don't -- don't mention that to Aly, 'cause she'll just add that to the list of things that she hates me for.",
        "Quinn: Honey, I don't want you to waste one more minute thinking about her. The line is great. Your idea's great. You and Hope are perfectly happy together. Nobody is gonna interfere with any of that.",

        "Hope: No. No, no, no.",
        "Liam: Are you sorry that I told you?",
        "Hope: No. Not at all. In fact, I'm really glad that we can still talk. I love that we can be honest with each other, even when, you know, something's hard to talk about.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad you feel that way, 'cause, uh... I have some things to say about Wyatt.",

        "Hope: Ah.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] You know, Hawaii, Paris, Mexico, that's -- that's good. It's fun, but eventually you're gonna want somebody who gives you more than headlines and diamonds. 'Cause everything Wyatt does is for effect, right? And that's served him pretty well so far, but... his luck is gonna run out eventually.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I want this promotion to be flawless.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You're putting a lot of pressure on yourself, Baby.",
        "Wyatt: Well, Hope is depending on me! I...I want to show her that I can do this the right way. This is the Stephanie Forrester collection. This can't feel like a publicity stunt.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You're thinking about Aly and what she said in the meeting.",
        "Wyatt: Well, she's got me thinking.",
        "Quinn: She was hostile and petulant, and what she said was completely unprofessional.",
        "Wyatt: Pam agreed with her.",
        "Quinn: Pam hates us.",
        "Wyatt: They knew Stephanie! We didn't!",
        "Quinn: And Eric knew Stephanie better than anyone, and he thinks displaying the jewelry is a great idea.",
        "Wyatt: Look, I just want this to be powerful. I mean, it -- it's -- it has to have integrity and -- and substance. No stunts.",
        "Quinn: No. Especially now that we have at least three people in this building gunning for us.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. You know what? If we present this collection the right way, I think we could win them over.",
        "Quinn: You think?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, why is Aly so upset? These pieces are family heirlooms. They're part of the Forrester legacy. They're handed down from generation to generation to show the Forrester women of Stephanie's example -- her strength, her grace, the difference that she made in this world. And hope has continued that legacy. This collection could highlight that and tie all of it together, and I think that Aly would just love that.",
        "Quinn: She might. If she heard it from anyone else but you. Don't kid yourself, Honey. That girl is trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Thank goodness for Pam. Everybody else sided with Wyatt and Quinn. Boy, do those two have everybody fooled.",
        "Charlie: But, uh, not you?",
        "Aly: Or you. Or Pam. Because we know the truth about them.",
        "Charlie: So, Pam actually talked to you about this?",
        "Aly: Yeah, she did. Because I was so angry about everything. This new campaign of his, the way he's changed Hope. He's destroying her reputation, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Aly: And just imagine if people knew how bad he really is.",
        "Charlie: It's the charming ones you have to watch out for.",
        "Aly: That's right.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Aly: Yeah, I-I thought he was funny. He called me Hope's shadow. I'd just met him, and he acted like we were friends.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, that's how they operate. You know, they get you all comfortable, and you let your guard down. I mean, I didn't know I was gonna have to watch the guy that brought the diamond into Forrester.",
        "Aly: Stupid diamond. That's when everything changed. Hope's line, her message.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Wyatt just wanted more publicity for the line.",
        "Aly: Well, that's all that matters to him.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Well, it didn't matter what happened to me. I mean, his precious diamond goes missing for a couple hours, no big deal, except I'm the guy standing next to the empty display case looking like an idiot. My reputation -- toast. My career -- over. But did he think about that when he slipped that hot rock into his pocket? No.",
        "Aly: No! No, he -- he should not get away with that. Wyatt needs to learn actions have consequences.",
        "Charlie: Well, he got all the consequences he wanted. His little stunt put Hope for the Future right on the front page.",
        "Aly: But it was a lie. Those thieves they arrested --",
        "Charlie: Were in the wrong place at the wrong time.",
        "Aly: He made himself look like a hero. [Scoffs]",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, he looked pretty smart making me look like a hero, too. So if anybody found out, I look like I'm in on it.",
        "Aly: But you weren't.",
        "Charlie: [Sighs] With any crime, the first question is, \"Who benefits?\"",
        "Aly: Hope for the Future did.",
        "Charlie: Right.",
        "Aly: But Hope would never okay something like that.",
        "Charlie: Oh, no, no, no. Wyatt didn't want her to know anything about it.",
        "Aly: Because then she'd see him for the scam artist he really is.",
        "Charlie: Right.",
        "Aly: Everything I've been saying about him is true, worse! [Sighs] Wyatt isn't just selfish and corrupt. He's a criminal. And criminals deserve to be punished for the bad things that they do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, you don't have to warn me about Aly. I know what kind of damage she can do.",
        "Quinn: She's like a high-school girl with a grudge.",
        "Wyatt: Her last name is Forrester! If she decides to use social media against this line, it would make news, and not the kind of news that we want.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but Eric and Hope are never gonna let that happen.",
        "Wyatt: Starting a family feud in the press isn't gonna be good, either! Look, I don't want any controversy connected with this line! I promised Hope that I was gonna -- I was gonna protect her reputation, not hurt it.",
        "Quinn: Then we have to talk about Aly, because she's been asking a lot of questions, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, she doesn't know anything.",
        "Quinn: She has been snooping around like a bad junior detective, and the way she feels about you, if she gets a hint of anything, she's not gonna let it go.",
        "Wyatt: What I did with the Hope for the Future diamond was -- was stupid and reckless, but it didn't ruin anything.",
        "Quinn: It almost cost you your relationship with Hope, and I don't want to see something like that happen again!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: He doesn't deserve you, you know.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] And we were having such a nice conversation.",
        "Liam: Wyatt is not who you think he is.",
        "Hope: I'm happy. I really wish that you could be happy for me.",
        "Liam: I think I would be if I didn't know what your involvement with Wyatt would do to you and everything you care about.",
        "Hope: Oh, God, you sound like Aly.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] I sound like Aly?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Liam: Really? What? Wyatt hasn't got through to her yet?",
        "Hope: She has the wrong idea of Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Maybe she has the right idea.",
        "Hope: No. Aly blames Wyatt for changing my line, but the truth is, he saved it.",
        "Liam: Does Wyatt -- does he really know what it means to you? No. Does he know what it means to young women everywhere like Aly?",
        "Hope: I'm sorry that Aly is disappointed with the direction that we've decided to take, but I am really, really proud of the things that Wyatt and I have accomplished together. Aly is stuck in the past. She's...[Sighs] She's upset that I'm dating Wyatt, and I think that's what this is all about. She's mad at me because we're not together.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Well, I can't say I blame her. I'm a little irked by that myself.",
        "Hope: Well, okay. Well... [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: But you want to know what really bothers me?",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Liam: Seeing you with someone who doesn't get you. Who doesn't really get you the way I do. So, Eye on Fashion has a new feature. Looking at the next generation of style makers.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God. It's a tribute.",
        "Liam: Everybody loves a good comeback story.",
        "Hope: Hmm. [Sighs] \"Hope Logan. Like the diamond that garnered Hope for the Future so much attention, Hope was transformed by the intense pressure she was under. This year, Hope and her collection emerged stronger and with a greater clarity of purpose than they'd ever had before.\" You wrote that.",
        "Liam: Wyatt didn't save your collection, Hope, and neither did the diamond. You did. It was the choices you made that brought it back and made it better than ever. And the thing is, you never really give yourself enough credit. But that's okay, 'cause I'm gonna be here always to make sure you do get it.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Liam: My pleasure. Well...",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat]",
        "Liam: [Clears throat]",
        "Wyatt: Sorry, Eric, uh, my mom and I were just --",
        "Liam: Borrowing the big man's office?",
        "Wyatt: Huh. Just finishing a meeting.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah? Anything to do with this new project you and Hope are working on?",
        "Wyatt: Wow, that was subtle. But ineffective. I could care less if you talk to Hope.",
        "Liam: Right, 'cause you're not the jealous type.",
        "Wyatt: Not jealous of you.",
        "Liam: Well, that's awfully confident for somebody who came this close to losing her recently.",
        "Wyatt: You know what? I didn't lose her, Liam. And unlike you, I never will.",
        "Liam: Right. 'Cause at the moment, Hope has it in her head that you're some kind of savior, that you pulled her line back from the brink.",
        "Wyatt: Well, it wasn't just her line. It was her whole life, really. If it wasn't for me, she might be married to you.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Forrester's had a really good year. I'm sure you're patting yourself on the back for that, too.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Wow. No, I'm very grateful to be a part of this company and to have Hope in my life.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you should be. Everything's gone exactly the way you and your mother hoped it would.",
        "Wyatt: It has, hasn't it?",
        "Liam: I mean, it would be one thing if you came by it honestly, that way you could stop, relax, enjoy it. But, uh, karma's a funny thing.",
        "Wyatt: You know what? It's too bad that I don't believe in karma.",
        "Liam: What about cause and effect? That meat and potatoes enough for you?",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Liam: Listen, I don't trust you. You know that. But apparently I'm not the only one who feels that way. Your mask is slipping. It's only a matter of time before your lack of integrity catches up to you.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Hello, Handsome.",
        "Charlie: Pam, we need to talk.",
        "Pam: That's a serious look.",
        "Charlie: You said we should always be honest with each other, remember, with what happened between Quinn and -- and Wyatt? We agreed not to keep secrets.",
        "Pam: [Gasps] You looked at my phone?",
        "Charlie: Y-- no, I didn't.",
        "Pam: Then why the face?",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm shocked. I'm stunned, if you want to know the truth.",
        "Pam: Have you been snooping in my computer? 'Cause those pictures are Donna's.",
        "Charlie: No! No! I-I was talking to Aly. I mean, she confided in me. She was worried about Wyatt. She thought I'd understand.",
        "Pam: Oh. You know, Charlie, maybe there's something I need to tell you about Aly.",
        "Charlie: Pam, what were you thinking? How could you? How could you let her in on our secret?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I was right about Wyatt! I was right about everything!",
        "Hope: Okay, we've talked about this, and Eric was very clear --",
        "Aly: But he doesn't know! He has no idea!",
        "Hope: I know that it upsets you, but what Wyatt and I do in private is our own business.",
        "Aly: But Wyatt did something terrible!",
        "Hope: I've tried to be patient with you!",
        "Aly: He's a thief! The heist at the boutique, it was him. Wyatt stole the Hope for the Future diamond! Hope, did you hear what I said?
