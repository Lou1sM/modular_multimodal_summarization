    "Recap": [
        "Wyatt comes over to Quinn's. He asks if Deacon is there and she says no. She sees the manila envelope and asks if he has more papers for her. He reminds her that he had the restraining offer withdrawn. She tells him that he can put that right in the shredder if it is prenup papers. She will never ask Deacon to sign one. Rick tells Maya that his divorce papers will be final. She tells him that she will be waiting for him at home and his divorce is his business. But at least now she won't be the other woman anymore. Ridge explains to Carter that Caroline is out of town with her mothers and her papers came today. He thinks she will be okay with that. Brooke gives a quick story of her suddenly drinking and how lost she feels. The counselor asks for more volunteers and Deacon stands. He tells his story that he has screwed up all of his life but he is going straight now and does not want to drink and mess it up again now that he is on the straight and narrow and actually helping other people. Wyatt tells Quinn not to ask questions, just put the papers in her safe as he does not want to see them. They are his divorce papers. He really wanted to wave them in her face and show her what her craziness did to him. He says but he understands now. He did the same thing. He chased Hope and he could not understand why the world would not hand her to him, the one thing he wanted so badly. He knew when Hope stayed with him that it wasn't for him. But at least she was close. Now he understands. He is his mother's son.",
        "Nicole is jiving to loud music in the living room and finds a note from Maya that tells her in certain terms to clean up after herself and make her bed as the housekeeper won't. Nicole just makes a frown and throws the note into the fireplace. Maya comes home and asks Nicole to turn off the music. She explains that this is a special day with Rick's divorce becoming final and she is going to fix a special supper. And this would be a good night for Nicole to hook back up with her UCLA friends at their place. Nicole counters back that Rick likes her and is not always trying to get rid of her so maybe she will stay. She is not going to go just because Maya is ashamed of her. Maya says she is not just asking, she is telling Nicole to go away tonight. Nicole says she has as much right to be here as Maya does. Maya says no, this is her home and Nicole is a guest here and she will take her apartment hunting tomorrow, even paying her first month. This is a fight she can not win. Nicole says she is not leaving and Maya knows why. Rick tells Carter that the only regret that he has is that he hurt Caroline so badly. Carter says there is still time. Rick says no, he did love her but this is for the best."

        "Deacon: Okay. Uh... this -- this is my first time here at this meeting, but it's not my first time. Lady, uh, was talking about blacking out last night. I think I've blacked out for entire years of my life. There's a lot that I wish I couldn't remember. I wasn't a very nice drunk. Um... I, uh -- I did a lot of stupid stuff. Stuff that I'm too embarrassed to tell any of you about. I had a daughter who I adored, and even I knew that I wasn't fit to be around her. I did manage to get sober in these rooms. It wasn't pretty, and it didn't magically make me a better person. But the funny thing is that it started to make me a better person in spite of myself. See, I got involved in a relationship with somebody who... she was way more desperate than I was. Somebody who really needed my help. And the amazing thing is that I was actually able to help her. I was actually able to be there for this person. Now we're getting married. See, I-I don't -- I don't want to screw this up. Um...I started drinking again. And I know that if I keep drinking, that it's gonna go back to the way it was. And I'm gonna wind up poisoning everything that's good in my life. Thank you.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Sweetheart, did you think you couldn't tell me?",
        "Wyatt: Hell, no! I intended to wave it around in your face and tell you, \"hey, look what all your craziness has led to.\"",
        "Quinn: So, wait, Hope just had some lawyer drop this on you? That is cowardly.",
        "Wyatt: No, it was my idea. I decided to stop kidding myself. Don't you think it's about time? I walked up to your door, and I thought to myself... [Sighs] \"I'm gonna stop blaming you and making you feel bad.\"",
        "Quinn: No...",
        "Wyatt: Just...",
        "Quinn: Sweetheart, you're right. No, you're right to blame me.",
        "Wyatt: Stop talking, please! You're seriously off-center. You know that, right? And I get it. I know how desperate and nuts you make yourself sometimes, that you'll do and say just about anything to get what you want. But the one thing that we don't admit to ourselves... I'm the same. I'm you.",
        "Quinn: Oh, no, sweetheart. Don't say that.",
        "Wyatt: I couldn't... I couldn't understand why the world just wouldn't give me the one thing that I wanted. So I...I chased Hope. I...begged her. I flattered her. And I tricked her. And I stretched the truth. And I lied to her. And she loved me. But just not the same way that I loved her. And when she decided to stay, I knew that it wasn't for me. But I didn't care 'cause she was close, you know? But then I finally understood one thing. I am my mother's son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Thanks, everybody, for another fantastic meeting. Oh, and just remember. By being here, you've agreed that whatever you hear and whoever you see in this room is kept on the strictest confidence. Have a good day, everyone. Keep coming back.",
        "All: It works if you work it.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kris: Everything from the stipulated judgment that we negotiated remains. Because it's uncontested, the only area of concern is financial. Caroline's attorney, she reaffirmed that because neither party wants spousal support...",
        "Rick: We're good.",
        "Kris: Of course, there's a six-month waiting period from the date here when the papers were served for the divorce to be final. Otherwise, you're done.",
        "Rick: Well, \"done\" is what we want it to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I'm sure you understand. It's a big moment in our relationship.",
        "Nicole: Absolutely.",
        "Maya: And we just want to celebrate.",
        "Nicole: It's such a big house. You could have a family of five living here that you've never seen before. No, two families of five. I can stay out of your way, no problem.",
        "Maya: Really, Nicole? You're really gonna fight me on this?",
        "Nicole: I'm not fighting. Life is compromise.",
        "Maya: Go to the movies.",
        "Nicole: You know, Rick likes me. He's not the one who always wants me out of the way.",
        "Maya: Rick treats everyone with kindness and respect.",
        "Nicole: Whatever. I just know he likes me. Maybe he wants me to be part of your celebration. I'm family.",
        "Maya: This is a perfectly reasonable request. So do whatever you have to do to be wherever you need to be. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.",
        "Nicole: And I'm telling you that I'm not going to be swept under the rug just because you're ashamed of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Of course I'll put it in the safe for you.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Has Hope responded? Are you thinking about telling Liam?",
        "Wyatt: Doesn't matter. It's gonna be public record.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but does that guy read anything but fashion magazines and tofu times?",
        "Wyatt: He'll probably find out from Brooke. Kind of figured she should hear it from me. Which is probably a mistake.",
        "Quinn: If she criticized you in any way --",
        "Wyatt: Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! Nothing like that, okay? But she was...lonely. It was kind of sad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: I can't believe that you're at this meeting. This is crazy.",
        "Brooke: What are the chances?",
        "Deacon: Why -- you know, I'm happy. You came at the right time. I mean, at least you're not letting your life go down the toilet.",
        "Brooke: No?",
        "Deacon: Not like mine did. You gonna be okay?",
        "Brooke: At least I'm showing some interest.",
        "Deacon: Just -- just don't drink today, all right? I-I won't either.",
        "Brooke: One day at a time.",
        "Deacon: Come on, I'm serious. Look, if you feel like you're gonna reach for the bottle, just...just call me.",
        "Brooke: Can't I just throw away the wine opener instead?",
        "Deacon: No, that -- no, you can't. That's not -- can't do that. I'm serious. Look, if you feel like you're gonna do it, just call me. And I'll do the same. I'll call you.",
        "Brooke: Why would you do that? I don't even know what I'm doing.",
        "Deacon: It's kind of nice having a friend who has such low expectations of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Well, that wasn't so bad.",
        "Carter: No regrets?",
        "Rick: I'm sorry that I hurt her.",
        "Carter: Really?",
        "Rick: I'm sorry that I hurt her so bad.",
        "Carter: Well, nobody died. Caroline fell to pieces, but she swept them all up.",
        "Rick: I just... you know, if it hadn't been -- never mind.",
        "Carter: There's still time.",
        "Rick: No. I loved her. It broke my heart to lose her. But this is for the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Why would I be ashamed of you? I hardly know you. And plus, you're beautiful and more educated.",
        "Nicole: Then let's agree. I have just as much right to be here as you do.",
        "Maya: No. No, Nicole. I live here. This is my home. You are a guest, temporarily, until you find another place to stay.",
        "Nicole: I think I found it.",
        "Maya: No.",
        "Nicole: Let's ask Rick.",
        "Maya: You will do no such thing. You have taken advantage of his generosity for long enough. So let's go apartment hunting tomorrow. I am happy to front you first and last month's rent and deposit.",
        "Nicole: I'm not going out. And I'm not moving out.",
        "Maya: I appreciate a girl who knows how to stand up for herself. I wish that I had known how to do that when I was your age. But this is a fight you can't win.",
        "Nicole: Want to bet? I'm not leaving. And you know why."
