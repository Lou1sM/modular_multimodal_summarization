        "Nick tells Brooke they can let what happened tonight tear them apart or they can come together. Pick one! Ridge is at Brooke's and bemoans to Bridget that Brooke has left him high and dry and he needs to go after her. Though nothing bad happened, Taylor recalls her earlier drunken night with Nick. She confides in a shocked Stephanie, who still considers Taylor her angel so nothing she can say will turn her against her. She thinks Taylor and Ridge are free now and get back together and she'll help her.",
        "Nick tells Brooke they don't have to be in denial anymore; she can be honest with him. She still waffles; it's been a long day and she's confused. Before they can settle anything, Ridge walks onto The Marlin, assuming Brooke has chosen him but is only wanting to let Nick down easy. Bridget tells Dante she feels sort of numb. She made her decision to free Nick and now Brooke hasn't. Ridge states he is tired of these games and pretty much commands Brooke they need to get out of there. However, she doesn't follow."

        "Ridge: Come on, Catherine, where are you? Catherine, it's Ridge. Call me when you get this message. I know it's late, but I really need you to watch Hope and R.J. Were you expecting Nick?",
        "Bridget: I just saw Jackie's car leaving as I was pulling in the driveway. What are you doing here?",
        "Ridge: Bridget, I need you to watch the kids, okay?",
        "Bridget: Where's mom?",
        "Ridge: She's probably on Popeye's boat by now.",
        "Bridget: So she chose Nick?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Bridget: Well, you're here and mom is with Nick. Is this some kind of misguided attempt of yours to woo mom back?",
        "Ridge: Hardly.",
        "Bridget: Ridge, if mom is with Nick right now, shouldn't you give them a little bit of privacy?",
        "Ridge: Look, I don't want to get into this right now. Your mom and I were up in bed and Nick comes barging in. That's all I want to say, okay?",
        "Bridget: Mom chose you?",
        "Ridge: Well, she didn't just come out and say it.",
        "Bridget: So then, you don't know for sure.",
        "Ridge: Bridget, come on.",
        "Bridget: Look, if mom is with Nick, doesn't that tell you something right now, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, it tells me she wants to let him down easy. That's what it tells me. Now, I need to go up and get dressed. Can you watch the kids? Thank you.",

        "[Taylor remembering]",
        "Taylor: I've been in so much pain for so long. Every moment, every day, it's always there. Until now. I don't know why, but -- being with you, it's gone. I can't, I can't, I can't. I can't. Oh, oh, oh, oh!",
        "Brooke: Nick, I -- Taylor? My god, what are you doing?",
        "Stephanie: Taylor? Honey? Here, drink this.",
        "Taylor: Thank you.",
        "Stephanie: How'd you end up like this? You want to talk? Or not.",
        "Taylor: Something terrible has happened. It's terrible. I met Hector for a drink.",
        "Stephanie: Hector? Did he get you drunk and try and take advantage of this?",
        "Taylor: No, no, Stephanie. If anything, he was looking out for me.",
        "Stephanie: And where were you two?",
        "Taylor: This place -- Chuck's. It's down at the Marina.",
        "Stephanie: I know that well. I was there once with Nick. So you've done a little heavy drinking, eh?",
        "Taylor: It was really just a last straw. When we lost Felicia -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Stephanie: No.",
        "Taylor: I'm so sorry. You must be devastated.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you, sweetheart, it's okay. I hope that she's in a better place now.",
        "Taylor: Any place is better than here.",
        "Stephanie: Come on, drink some more of this. You want to tell me what happened tonight?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Do you need me to repeat the choices? Do you? Do you?",
        "Brooke: No. No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Wait, Ridge, just wait. Please, don't go over there. You've been through a lot today. You just lost Felicia.",
        "Ridge: I need my wife.",
        "Bridget: Mom is not your wife.",
        "Ridge: Bridget, I get it. Your mom cares for Nick. She's concerned about how he's gonna react when finds out we're still together now. But that's all there is between them.",
        "Bridget: No, no. Mom is in love with him. As hard as it was for me to let him go, I had to do it. Whatever's going on between them, we can't fight it.",
        "Ridge: Well, maybe you can't fight it.",
        "Bridget: No, you had your chance, Ridge. Now it's time for mom to be with Nick.",
        "Ridge: You know, it's very sweet how concerned you are for me. I appreciate it. Thank you. But you're wrong. Now will you please just stay and watch Hope and R.J. until Brooke and I get back? Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: It's exactly as I told you on the phone. Nick broke up the wedding. So they're not married. I should think you'd be happy. Honey, you and Ridge can get back together again.",
        "Taylor: No!",
        "Stephanie: Yes, you can. Sweetheart, nothing has been resolved. Bridget's walked away from Nick. He's free.",
        "Taylor: It doesn't matter.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it does. Look, Brooke will be with Nick. And eventually, Ridge will understand that that's what's the best thing.",
        "Taylor: It's too late, okay?",
        "Stephanie: Why are you saying that? Taylor -- Taylor, my son is never going to find someone like you the rest of his life. You are his -- you're his moral compass.",
        "Taylor: I'm lost, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: He'll find you. He'll find his way back to you and I'll help you. We'll fight this together. Whatever it takes. Because you and ridge deserve one another. You deserve to be together.",
        "Taylor: No!",
        "Stephanie: Stop this nonsense. I don't know what's going on with you, but whatever it is, it couldn't be worse than anything Brooke's ever done. You and Ridge are going to be all right.",
        "Taylor: No, we're not. No, no. Not after what I did tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Nick, as much as I love you, and I do, I just want to be sensitive.",
        "Nick: Forrester's got his whole family to lean on.",
        "Brooke: I know. And I know you want me to move forward.",
        "Nick: I want you to be honest with me and yourself.",
        "Brooke: I am. At least, I'm trying to. It's just -- it's been a very confusing day. Especially for Bridget.",
        "Nick: Bridget has never been more clear. We don't have to live in denial anymore. It's okay.",
        "Ridge: Well, what's this? Bed's a mess. You trying to comfort my wife?",
        "Nick: Ex-wife, actually.",
        "Brooke: Nick --",
        "Nick: Sorry, couldn't resist.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, we're in the middle of something.",
        "Ridge: Whoa. Well, well, well. What have we here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Dante, you didn't have to come all the way over here.",
        "Dante: No? That phone call seemed like an sos to me.",
        "Bridget: Well, it's just to bring Dominick out at this hour --",
        "Dante: Well, you did me a favor. Little guy wouldn't go to sleep.",
        "Bridget: His first night without Felicia.",
        "Dante: Yeah, I took him around town in my new carrier. He was out like a light. So listen, what's going on?",
        "Bridget: Well, as if today hasn't been difficult enough --",
        "Dante: Another crisis?",
        "Bridget: Yep.",
        "Dante: Let me guess. Your mother?",
        "Bridget: Who else?",
        "Dante: Did she make a decision?",
        "Bridget: I don't know.",
        "Dante: But that's why you ended things up with Nick today.",
        "Bridget: Exactly. This craziness had to stop.",
        "Dante: How're you holding up?",
        "Bridget: Honestly? I feel just kind of numb.",
        "Dante: Bridget, it's going to take some time, you know.",
        "Bridget: Well, that's fine. I can accept that. But what's my mother's excuse? She wants to be with Nick so badly. What is she waiting on?",
        "Dante: She's not with him?",
        "Bridget: No, they're at the Marlin.",
        "Dante: Well, there's your answer.",
        "Bridget: Ridge is with them as well.",
        "Dante: He's looking for trouble?",
        "Bridget: I don't know all the details, but from what I gather, Ridge and my mom were up in the bedroom, Nick walked in on them, and so mom went over to Nick's to explain.",
        "Dante: Ridge had to follow.",
        "Bridget: I know that this is painful for him and I feel terrible. But he needs to understand that, like it or not, my mom and Nick -- they belong together. And there's nothing that Ridge or anyone else can do to keep them apart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Ever since Ridge left, I've just been sad and alone. Drinking too much. Tonight was the absolute worst.",
        "Stephanie: I can see that.",
        "Taylor: Then Hector took my keys, and he gave money to Chuck and he said to help me get home. And then he left. And that's when he walked in. And he was feeling exactly the same way I was. Lost. I don't know, it's just like, you know -- the first time since Ridge walked out on me, it was like somebody finally understood me. And I don't know, I just -- I don't know why I did what I did. I just don't know why I let it happen -- if it was the alcohol or -- I don't know. But he knew how I was feeling.",
        "Stephanie: Who was he?",
        "Taylor: You're not going to like it. You might hate me.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, sweetheart, now stop. Come on, there's nothing that you could say or do that would make me change my mind about you. You're my angel.",
        "Taylor: I went back in. I couldn't find Chuck anywhere and I had been drinking. I didn't know how I was going to get home. And I don't know why I did what I did. I went to his place. And then, I don't know -- I don't know what happened, but I just -- I fell into his arms. And then we fell on the bed. But nothing happened.",
        "Stephanie: So we're just talking about some guy?",
        "Taylor: No. It was Nick.",
        "Stephanie: Nick? Nick?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: These aren't yours.",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Ridge: Another woman? The plot thickens. Forrester design. Good taste in clothes. But not men. Must be a real loser to hang with you.",
        "Nick: I'd say that woman's hung with worse.",
        "Ridge: Showing your true colors, are we, Nick?",
        "[Nick scoffs]",
        "Nick: As usual, you have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Ridge: Who was she, Nick? Must've run out of here pretty fast to leave her shoes behind.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, just leave it alone.",
        "Ridge: Did you see her, Logan? Someone's wife? Someone's mother?",
        "Brooke: Nick was just hurt. He saw you and me in bed together at the house.",
        "Ridge: Oh, so I shouldn't rub it in? Hurt people go to a doctor, Nick. Or a psychiatrist. Not some strange woman and a bottle of cheap booze. You're sick in the head, Nick. You need a shrink? Maybe you should call Taylor and get a referral.",
        "Nick: Little late for that.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, you're right about that. Well, Logan, if ever there were a decision to be made between him and me, there ain't anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Still sleeping?",
        "Bridget: Yeah. You know, after watching Dominick, I understand what Ridge is fighting for. His family. And his son.",
        "Dante: It's not just about the child. He loves her very much.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, I know.",
        "Dante: But he hasn't always been good to her.",
        "Bridget: No, you're right. He hasn't.",
        "Dante: That's why you want your mom to end up with Nick.",
        "Bridget: No, what I want for my mother is to be happy. And what about Hope? She adores Nick. She practically thinks of him like a father. After everything they've been through, they deserve a man they can count on.",
        "Dante: So do you. Look, you made a heck of a sacrifice today. Because you know there's only one woman for Nick. And that's your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: You were with Nick? All right, I guess I can understand this. You're angry with Ridge! I mean, he left you, he went back to Brooke, and you decided to hurt him.",
        "Taylor: I don't know. Nick told me that Brooke had chosen to stay with Ridge. And then, shortly there after that, he found them in bed together.",
        "Stephanie: What? What?",
        "Taylor: I don't know, I guess -- I guess nothing even happened. Nick had misinterpreted this whole thing.",
        "Stephanie: And you were at Chuck's tying one on?",
        "Taylor: Oh, believe me, I did not expect to see him there. I just -- I wanted somebody to talk to. I just needed someone who understands what I'm dealing with.",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, this is a huge lapse in judgment. But having said that, honey, I -- I think we can fix this. I do, I think we can straighten it out. I'll take care of it, all right? I'll take care of everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You think you got it all figured out, don't you, Forrester?",
        "Ridge: Well, you made it awfully easy, Nick. Valiant effort, though. Very dramatic. Interrupting our wedding, sweeping the bride off of her feet, only to be rejected in the end. I tried to convince Brooke what you were all about. But she always wanted to believe the best of you. Now you've pretty much done all that for me. She finally sees you for what you really are. A waste of time. Come on, Logan. Let's get out of here. Come on, enough of these games. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: On the next \"bold and the beautiful\" --",
        "Ridge: Logan, what are you waiting for?",
        "Nick: She's not going home with you tonight.",
        "Brooke: This has been one of the longest days of my life and I just need some time.",
        "Stephanie: Don't talk about loving her in the past tense.",
        "Eric: You cannot avoid what's happened to Felicia. She's gone now. You have to accept that.",
        "Stephanie: The hell I do."
