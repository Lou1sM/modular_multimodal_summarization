        "Phoebe glances at the wedding invitation of Ridge and Brooke. She tells her dad if she can't see Rick, she doesn't feel like seeing her other friends. She understands Ridge's feelings, but she feels like Brooke has done a 180. Donna and Jackie lament the situation of the Forrester's not caring for Phoebe's feelings, but just their own, how this will look. They know Brooke and Nick were really happy and if Brooke and Ridge were to split up, they could be again. Stephanie spies them and even gloats that Jackie's precious Nicky may get Brooke back, how about that? They spy Phoebe in Insomnia and she doesn't look happy. If they could arrange for Rick and Phoebe to get together and Ridge find out about it, he would go crazy and Brooke in Australia, well .it could drive them apart for good. While dining separately, Rick sees Ashley and joins her. She asks if he's having dinner or making her his sale's pitch? He takes her hand as they reminisce about their special night in Paris and how exciting it was. She does find it ironic that he's now interested in a \u0091younger' woman. He assures her his issue with Ridge is a non-issue, it won't affect their business.",
        "Donna joins Phoebe and plays confidant, she is on her side. She plants the seeds in her head that if she really loves him, how can she let him go? She may not get another shot at true love. Sometimes in life you have to break the rules or end up being alone, like Donna."

        "Ridge: I hope you weren't calling Rick.",
        "Phoebe: I'm not calling anyone. I don't have anyone to call.",
        "Ridge: Sweetie, just because you can't see Rick doesn't mean you can't see your friends.",
        "Phoebe: I don't feel like it.",
        "Ridge: I know this has been kind of difficult for you, but I think in the long run, you're going to find that it's all going to be for the best.",
        "Phoebe: I will never believe that. But I understand why you do. I mean, at least you've been clear from the beginning. It's just Brooke, who did a complete 180 on us.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, Brooke hasn't really handled the situation very well. And she'd be the first to admit that.",
        "Phoebe: Well, can I admit something?",
        "Ridge: Sure.",
        "Phoebe: You haven't hesitated to tell me exactly how you feel about Rick, so I want to tell you how I really feel about Brooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: It's so sad. Rick and Phoebe really care for each other. But does that matter to Ridge and his family? They're only worried about how it'll look. How it affects them.",
        "Jackie: Does that surprise you?",
        "Donna: No, but Brooke's attitude does. I don't get it. I mean, she was really happy when they started spending time together.",
        "Jackie: And then Ridge put his foot down.",
        "Donna: Well, Phoebe is his daughter. He has a right to be concerned. But the way he's acting, forcing Brooke to choose between her fianc\u00e9 and her son. It's just -- it's crazy.",
        "Jackie: It's typical Ridge is what it is, and we both know where he learned that, don't we? From the master, his mother.",
        "Donna: Oh, don't even get me started on Stephanie.",
        "Jackie: It is her legacy. It's just this whole ugly pattern, starting all over again.",
        "Donna: Yes. Yeah, I see it, too. But Brooke doesn't.",
        "Jackie: Well, she can't, can she? You take it from me, the bigger the mistake, the harder it is to admit. Especially to yourself.",
        "Donna: She saw it when she was with Nick. Ridge promised her the world. Stephanie gave her half the company. They swore things would be better. I believed it. Brooke didn't.",
        "Jackie: And then nick let her down, and everything changed.",
        "Donna: They were really happy together, weren't they?",
        "Jackie: For awhile. I think that if Ridge and Brooke were to split up, they could be again.",
        "Stephanie: Well, here's to the ladies that prowl. How's the single life, girls?",
        "Donna: What do you want, Stephanie?",
        "Stephanie: Nice to see you, too, Donna. I just came in for coffee, but now that I see the clientele that's here, I may never come back.",
        "Jackie: That's good. Why don't you leave? Start now.",
        "Stephanie: Have you heard the latest news flash? Your darling Nick may actually get his precious Brooke back. How about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Thank you. [Cell phone rings] Sorry.",
        "[In a French accent]",
        "Rick: Would mademoiselle like a glass of champagne?",
        "Ashley: Oh, no thank you. I'm having cabernet.",
        "Rick: Ah, but you need glass of champagne to celebrate new job. [In normal voice] Which I hope you will take.",
        "Waiter: Well, if monsieur would like his own bottle of champagne, I will get it for him.",
        "Rick: Excuse me.",
        "Ashley: Still making friends everywhere you go.",
        "Rick: I'll just order my dinner in French. He'll come around.",
        "Ashley: So, are you here to eat, or are you going to make a sales pitch?",
        "Rick: Why, do you need a sales pitch?",
        "Ashley: Not really, but I could use some company. Want to join me?",
        "Rick: I'd love to.",
        "Ashley: Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Phoebe, you don't have to tell me you're upset with Brooke.",
        "Phoebe: No, my point is, people didn't approve of your relationship with Brooke either. I mean, look at the problems you two have had, and you're still getting married. And I've supported that, Dad, because she makes you happy. Why can't you do the same for me?",
        "Ridge: Because it's not the same.",
        "Phoebe: Come on. Look at the way you're acting. It's the same way grandma acted with you and Brooke. Okay, not as bad. I get it that you're worried about the store's opening and your wedding.",
        "Ridge: Phoebe, I'm worried about you. Rick is just not right for you, and I'm sorry, but there's nothing really either of you can say to change my mind about any of that. Phoebe, where are you going?",
        "Phoebe: Insomnia. Maybe I'll actually find someone who'll listen to me.",
        "Rick: Thank you for the invitation, Ashley. This is a nice surprise.",
        "Ashley: Wasn't that why you came over? You know how much I hate to eat alone.",
        "Rick: Actually, I'm a bit curious as to what you think of that contract.",
        "Ashley: Oh, well, I'm definitely considering it. But you know, there's been a lot of change in my life lately. With jabot, moving Hong Kong. Abby and I have hardly had a chance to get settled.",
        "Rick: And your father's passing. I sent flowers to the funeral.",
        "Ashley: You did? I don't remember.",
        "Rick: I didn't enclose a card. But I had the florist make up a bouquet of the flowers that we picked out that night in Paris in the Latin quarter at that little market after dinner at Delphine's?",
        "Ashley: Yeah, stargazers and white roses.",
        "Rick: I remember that night so well. Walking back to your hotel, and we talked about your dad the entire way. It was obvious how much he meant to you, Ashley.",
        "Ashley: Yeah. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Is this taken? You know, we both want the same thing.",
        "Jackie: No, we don't.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you don't want nick back with Brooke?",
        "Jackie: That isn't what you want. I mean, yes, you want Brooke away from Ridge. But after that, you don't give a damn what happens to her.",
        "Stephanie: I see Nicky told you about our conversation.",
        "Jackie: Conversation? You've never had a conversation with anyone in your life. You open your mouth, it's manipulation. Nicky knows it, so do I.",
        "Donna: And now, Brooke does, too.",
        "Stephanie: This doesn't concern you, pooky-lips.",
        "Donna: You turned on my sister, Stephanie. That concerns me. It concerns me a lot.",
        "Stephanie: And she let my son down.",
        "Donna: Well, if Ridge is feeling so betrayed, why hasn't he called off the wedding?",
        "Stephanie: I don't know. Perhaps he has to process what she's done.",
        "Donna: Well, Brooke wouldn't have to keep anything from him, if he was able to have a mature discussion about this.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, a mature discussion. I don't think that Rick and Phoebe are going to continue in any kind of relationship. So, there's really nothing to discuss. Your sister can't seem to see that. And because she can't, I don't think that relationship with Ridge is going to last. Bye.",
        "Donna: That woman --",
        "Jackie: Ridge and his mother, they're cut from the same cloth. And the way that he's treating Rick and Phoebe proves it.",
        "Donna: But how do we prove it to Brooke? I've tried to talk to her, but she won't listen. I don't know what else to do.",
        "Jackie: I think I might have an idea. Sheriff, the McSweeneys are tearing up the town !",
        "Donna: Brooke can't marry Ridge. She's losing herself already, Jackie.",
        "Jackie: Okay, look, you said you talked to her. You expressed your concerns.",
        "Donna: But it only makes her defensive.",
        "Jackie: Well, that's just because it's one more person telling her what to do.",
        "Donna: How else can I get through to her?",
        "Jackie: We have to make her realize it for herself.",
        "Donna: She knows what Ridge is like. They've been doing this dance for as long as I can remember.",
        "Jackie: But now, Ridge is giving Rick orders. And no matter how strong Brooke's feelings are for Ridge, a mother's love for her son is stronger.",
        "Donna: Phoebe doesn't look happy.",
        "Jackie: Poor love. She must be heartbroken.",
        "Phoebe: Hey, Rick. It's me. I sent you a text message, and I know you're busy, but just call me back when you get the chance. I miss you.",
        "Jackie: Well, that was interesting. She's just left someone a message. Do you think it could be Rick?",
        "Donna: They agreed to cool it, prove to their parents they can behave themselves.",
        "Jackie: You make it sound as though it was their decision. I overheard Brooke and Ridge talking before she left for Australia. It's quite clear who was calling the shots, and Brooke was not particularly happy about it.",
        "Donna: Then why doesn't she stand up to him?",
        "Jackie: I think she would. If she was forced to. Forced to defend her son.",
        "Donna: Ridge wouldn't like that.",
        "Jackie: Not at all. If we could arrange something, get Phoebe and Rick together, Ridge would go crazy, and it might open Brooke's eyes. And that would benefit everyone, wouldn't it?",
        "Donna: Only if Ridge found out about it.",
        "Jackie: I think we could arrange that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Well, you seem to have dealt with Brooke's absence rather well. Of course, the way the two of you have been arguing lately, it's probably a relief.",
        "Ridge: Might be. If I was only arguing with Brooke.",
        "Stephanie: Do you need me to talk to Phoebe?",
        "Ridge: No, she's not here. She went out for some coffee.",
        "Stephanie: By herself?",
        "Ridge: Hopefully she's seeing some friends.",
        "Stephanie: But not Rick.",
        "Ridge: She and Rick aren't seeing each other anymore, Mother.",
        "Stephanie: As far as you know.",
        "Ridge: Look, it's all been dealt with, okay? There is no more sneaking around, no more deception. By anybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ashley: So, I'm surprised you're here alone. No plans with Phoebe?",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Ashley: She seems like a very lovely girl. It's kind of ironic, isn't it? I mean, you and a younger woman?",
        "[Rick laughs]",
        "Rick: She's -- she's very special to me.",
        "Ashley: Oh, I'm sure she is. And sharing something special with someone younger, at the right time of your life. You know, it might be just what you need. It can be fun and exciting.",
        "Rick: Is that how you remember Paris? Fun and exciting?",
        "Ashley: Very. Don't you?",
        "Rick: Paris was amazing.",
        "Ashley: Do you miss it?",
        "Rick: I do, yeah. I mean, Paris is Paris. L.A. is just so --",
        "Ashley: It's a little too shiny.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Ashley: But it's home for you. It's -- your family's here.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I just -- L.A.'s great. Well, everything except for my relationship with Ridge. Look, Ashley, I know you've had your fair share of family squabbles. And the last thing you want is to wind up in the middle of ours.",
        "Ashley: Yeah, the thought has definitely crossed my mind.",
        "Rick: Well, erase it, okay? Look, Ridge and I, we have our differences. We have our issues, but we have one thing in common. We both want this company to succeed, and it can with your help, Ashley.",
        "Ashley: So this issue with you and Phoebe?",
        "Rick: It is a non-issue. It will not affect business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: They went behind Ridge's back once, they may not do it again. Unless I give them a little nudge in the right direction.",
        "Jackie: Poor Phoebe. She must feel like the whole world is against her right now. She may be very relieved to know that somebody is on her side.",
        "Donna: You're leaving?",
        "Jackie: Yes, I'm going to go and pick up hope. You want Brooke to see Ridge for what he truly is? Rick and Phoebe are the answer. Get them together and they will drive Ridge and Brooke apart. You're a smart girl, Donna. Go to bat. Do it for your sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Hey, Phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: Hi. I didn't know you were here.",
        "Donna: Maybe because you haven't stopped looking at your phone since you got here. Are you waiting for a call? It must be tough, being forced to give up a guy you like so much.",
        "Phoebe: I'm not trying to be rude, but if you're trying to give me another lecture about how Rick is not good for me, I really don't feel like hearing that right now.",
        "Donna: Isn't that for you to decide?",
        "Phoebe: Well, my father doesn't think so.",
        "Donna: Well, your dad doesn't want to believe you've grown up.",
        "Phoebe: No, he doesn't.",
        "Donna: Well, it's like that with most dads. Not mine. I mean, he wasn't around.",
        "Phoebe: Well, if you're telling that I am lucky to have a father who cares about me, I understand --",
        "Donna: No. I mean, you are, but I'm sure you must not feel that way. I wouldn't. I'd be frustrated as hell. And Brooke, when she was your age, if somebody tried to tell her what to do, forget it.",
        "Phoebe: Well, Brooke's on my father's side.",
        "Donna: I'm sure it seems that way.",
        "Phoebe: She told Rick to break up with me, Donna.",
        "Donna: Because she had to. Believe me, the Brooke I know would never ask anyone to walk away from love. That is what you feel for Rick, isn't it?",
        "Phoebe: What if it is?",
        "Donna: Then I feel even worse for you. Phoebe, if you think Rick is the one, how can you let him go?",
        "Ridge: I kind of came down hard on Rick and Phoebe. Brooke, too. They all know what they did was wrong, and it won't happen again. Rick and Phoebe are over.",
        "Donna: Your father tells you it's over, and that's it? You can't accept that.",
        "Phoebe: Well, who says I have?",
        "Donna: Brooke told me you guys agreed to cool it.",
        "Phoebe: For now. Not forever.",
        "Donna: Phoebe, as someone who has been single all my life, you may not get another shot at true love if you don't take a stand. It happens all the time. Mr. Right slips away. Trust me, I know. I've spent a lot of lonely nights thinking, \"What if?\" I mean, Rick is a wonderful guy. Do you really want to see him slip through your fingers? You're a good kid, Phoebe. You're a rule follower, but sometimes in life, you've got to break the rules. And that time for you is now. Take Rick and make him yours. Before you end up alone, like me."
