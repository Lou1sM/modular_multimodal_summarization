{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7543 ~ Katie is surprised & hurt at Brooke's reaction to her suspicions concerning Quinn & Ridge; Eric, Ridge, & Brooke relish in the fact that things are on the upswing for the Forrester family."], "Recap": ["Katie says she did not want to tell Brooke but she cannot deny what she saw. Ridge touched Quinn and it seemed to be just the jewelry as an excuse. Brooke barks that Ridge would never do that and neither would Quinn. That would be really low. Quinn discusses it with Ridge and says they are good and no one seems to know anything. Eric interrupts and she covers that they were just going over the Australian shoot. He says he really needs to talk to Ridge alone. Ridge says it is good to see him around him and wonders if he misses it. Eric says not really, no distractions so he likes working at home. It fills his heart that Ridge has come around to Quinn and he could not be happier to see them working together. Quinn tells Ivy that she is not in a scary mood and she hates having to keep saying it. She likes Ivy's changes in the jewelry and just wants her to keep doing it. Ivy rants on but Quinn is not listening to her. Quinn tells her if she comes across an open door, do not hang around and eavesdrop; that is too sneaky. Katie tells Brooke that she would never come to her like this just before Brooke's wedding if she did not believe what she was saying. Brooke still argues that this is ridiculous and it probably has something to do with her spending so much time with Eric and she is thinking of him. Or maybe it is Ridge. She and Ridge were engaged at one time and now she wants to stir things up. Brooke wants a little support. She just invited her to Australia to be in the wedding and now she is spouting all this crazy stuff. Katie apologizes.", "Ridge tells his dad that all he wants is for them to be happy. Brooke is outside and hears this and joins in. She is glad everything is good between the two of them. Quinn tells Ivy they have had this conversation before and she assured her nothing was going to happen again with Ridge. It is Katie who keeps spying and popping in on Eric and she just wishes she would stay out of her business and now it is worse. She is going to join them in Australia. Katie returns to Quinn's office and she asks what is on her mind. She must be very excited now that she is joining them in Australia. Katie says it is really a big day in Brooke's life and she really wants it to go smoothly. Quinn says of course but what does that have to do with Quinn. Eric tells Brooke that he did not think he would ever love again after Stephanie, but because of Quinn he feels like it is a gift he is opening every day. And isn't it great that Ridge and Quinn can now be friends. Brooke says she heard from Katie that Ridge was working with Quinn over some jewelry. Ridge downplays it by saying she just wanted his opinion on a few pieces, one in particular and he just wanted to see it on her first. Again both Eric and Brooke are glad they can work so well together without the acrimony. Ridge says he does not want anything to come between him and his dad again. Brooke surmises that Eric is madly in love with Quinn and she and Ridge are getting married .Steffy and Liam too and they are all getting along. Eric laments yes that is all in the past and everything is great now. As Katie rattles on Quinn asks her if there is a purpose to this then just say it. She is dying to know. She knows she wants Eric all to herself and she is not even being subtle about it. She has told this to Katie but she still hangs around. She is offensive and just plain wrong. Is she trying to make up something to go tell Eric. She better not or she will regret it. She said it; she braces herself as Katie leaves and says nothing more."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Katie: I debated about whether to tell you or not. I mean, you're so happy. You're about to marry the love of your life. But I can't deny what I saw.", "Brooke: Which is what, exactly?", "Katie: Ridge and Quinn... standing very close to each other, the way he... touched her.", "Brooke: Quinn or the necklace?", "Katie: I kind of felt like the jewelry was really a prop, to be honest, and an excuse to be intimate. And this isn't the first time I've seen them like this together. I wish I didn't have to say anything.", "Brooke: No, no, gosh. Go ahead -- say it. Get it off your chest.", "Katie: I think there's something going on between ridge and his father's wife.", "Brooke: [Scoffs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: So, there's nothing to worry about.", "Ridge: Right. Nothing to worry about.", "Quinn: Right. No red flags, us being alone together, even if you're Katie.", "Ridge: No, we're designers designing. Where else would we be?", "Quinn: Right. We have a big photo shoot coming up.", "Ridge: I needed to see the necklace on you.", "Quinn: So we're good.", "Ridge: Perfectly fine. Dad.", "Quinn: Eric.", "Eric: Should I have made an appointment?", "Quinn: Oh, no, no, no! Of course not. You just never come to the office very much these days. Ridge and I were just going over some of the accessories for the Australian photo shoot.", "Eric: Wow. This is beautiful.", "Quinn: Yeah, it's...one of our favorites.", "Ridge: So, what brings you here?", "Eric: I was hoping to talk to you -- alone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: I-I can't believe you're saying these things.", "Katie: Well, I think if something's going on between ridge and Quinn, you should know about it before you get married.", "Brooke: And you're basing this wild speculation on supposedly an \"intimate\" moment between ridge and Quinn and a necklace?", "Katie: If you had seen it...", "Brooke: Ridge would never do something like that, and neither would Quinn. They don't want to destroy their relationship with Eric. For you to say so is ridiculous. For you to even think it, let alone say that to me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Good seeing you around here.", "Eric: Spent a lot of years in this office.", "Ridge: You miss it?", "Eric: Not really.", "Ridge: Not really or not yet?", "Eric: Working from home suits me right now. It's all about the work, not about the politics.", "Ridge: No distractions.", "Eric: No. Until my wife comes home. When I first came in, seeing you and Quinn working together so closely... fills my heart. Makes me proud of you, the way you've come around to Quinn. I couldn't be happier.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Whoa. Who shot you out of a cannon?", "Quinn: Don't ask. How's the piece coming?", "Ivy: Uh, yeah, good. Almost finished. What do you think?", "Quinn: It's beautiful.", "Ivy: Thanks. Well, I'm open to suggestions or changes --", "Quinn: No, no, no. Don't -- don't change anything. It's good work.", "Ivy: Oh, thanks. What's with the scary mood?", "Quinn: I am not scary.", "Ivy: Quinn, sometimes you can be.", "Quinn: You know what? That's not who I am anymore. Why do I have to keep saying it?", "Ivy: Sorry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: See, this is why I didn't want to say anything. I knew you'd be upset.", "Brooke: You think?", "Katie: You're my sister, and I don't want to see you get hurt. This could blow your whole life apart. Believe me, I --", "Brooke: Believe what, Katie? That ridge and Quinn are having an affair? That my fianc\u00e9 is sleeping with his father's wife? That is scandalous.", "Katie: Yeah, I agree.", "Brooke: Well, then, what am I supposed to do with that?", "Katie: I don't want to hurt you, really. Do you think I would come to you with something like this if I didn't honestly think that... something could be going on?", "Brooke: Ridge is being nice to Quinn, and that is a good thing. That is what Eric wanted. That is what this family needs. And I certainly don't need my sister coming up with these dangerous accusations, especially days before my wedding! I am so disappointed in you.", "Brooke: Why, Katie? Why would you come to me with something so damaging? Is it bill? Are you still upset with me about that?", "Katie: No. No, I'm not.", "Brooke: Okay. Then, it's Eric. You're trying to drive a wedge between Eric and Quinn. I know you've been spending time over at Eric's when Quinn isn't there.", "Katie: That has nothing to do with anything. I don't feel about Eric that way, and even if I did, I wouldn't spread lies about his wife. You know me better than that.", "Brooke: I don't know what to think. I don't even know why you're doing this.", "Katie: I'm just telling you what I saw and what I believe.", "Brooke: Ridge and Quinn having an affair.", "Katie: [Sighs]", "Brooke: Why are you doing this? Are you still upset with me about bill? I know. It's ridge, isn't it? You two were engaged at one time, and now I'm marrying ridge. I think it's better that you don't come with us after all.", "Katie: This has nothing to do with old wounds, okay? This is about what I saw between the man that you're going to marry and his father's wife. I don't want you going into a marriage without knowing something this destructive.", "Brooke: Oh, my god. I am days away from bringing my family back together. This is everything that we worked for, everything that we wanted, everything we waited for! And I don't need my sister to do this, to come up with these crazy accusations about my future husband! God! Show me a little support! Why don't you stand by me instead of try to tear me down all the time?!", "Katie: I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm sorry. I really am. I-I didn't mean to upset you. I'm sorry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: I mean, it has been nuts around here lately. Between planning Liam and Steffy's wedding and the fashion shoot, I've barely had time to breathe, let alone sleep. But it's a good kind of tired, you know? Like, I'm really looking forward to being in Sydney, no less, and it's gonna be amazing. Both events are gonna be amazing. Hey, have you ever been?", "Quinn: Been where?", "Ivy: Quinn, are you even listening to me?", "Quinn: Yeah. You -- you said you're, uh... you're tired, right? Sorry, no, I haven't been listening to you.", "Ivy: Should I even try and ask you what's bothering you again?", "Quinn: Some people just really get on my nerves. And you know what? I'll give you a little piece of advice. If you walk by a door and it's a bit open, you should consider it a bit closed. Don't hang around and eavesdrop. It's sneaky. It's really bad form.", "Ivy: Quinn, why do I get a sinking feeling about this? You just left to show ridge a necklace. Did something happen again?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: I have so much admiration and respect for you, son, the man you've turned out to be. Principled, loyal...", "Ridge: No. You know what? I don't always -- I'M... you need to understand something. Everything that is good in me, I got from you. And I wake up every day hoping that the good will outweigh the bad. And sometimes, I fall short.", "Eric: You don't fall short. You're a man who's strong with his convictions. You stand up for yourself. I appreciate that in you. And I'm ecstatic that you and Quinn have come up with your own relationship. I think that's great.", "Ridge: Dad, I just want you to be happy. I want you to be happy and at peace. That's all I want. And if someone can give you that, then they have my vote.", "Eric: Come here. Come here.", "Ridge: Love you, dad. Hey.", "Eric: Ah, the blushing bride -- or, one of them, anyway.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Bad time?", "Ridge: Never a bad time for you. We were just having a moment.", "Brooke: Yeah, I could see that. Makes me realize that everything is good in our world.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I'm assuming by your use of the word \"again,\" you're wondering if something physical happened between me and ridge.", "Ivy: Yes.", "Quinn: We had this conversation, ivy. I told you, there's nothing going on. I wouldn't betray my husband. And he's -- he's not gonna betray Brooke or Eric.", "Ivy: So, you and ridge didn't kiss?", "Quinn: [Scoffs] No.", "Ivy: So, then what's with the mood?", "Quinn: Katie. Always lurking in the fringes, listening, watching... she's that nosy neighbor who thinks nothing of popping by whenever she feels like it, for the flimsiest of reasons, even though I've told her time and again that I'm not comfortable with her spending time alone with my husband. But does she listen to me? No, of course not, because she's precious Katie Logan, everybody's pet.", "Ivy: Well, not yours, apparently.", "Quinn: I just wish she would stay out of my business. Now I just found out that she's joining us in Australia.", "[Knock on door, door opens]", "Katie: Hi.", "Ivy: Katie, hey.", "Katie: Hey. All set for Australia?", "Ivy: Yeah, well, I'd better be. I've been organizing everything with Steffy. Well, I have a meeting scheduled with rick, so, um...", "Quinn: Go.", "Ivy: Mm-hmm.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Good to see you.", "Quinn: So, Katie, did you get those pictures of Brooke's wedding dress?", "Katie: Yeah, I did, I did.", "Quinn: Must be really beautiful.", "Katie: It is. Well, ridge designed it, so... no surprise there, right?", "Quinn: Mm. So, do you have something on your mind?", "Katie: Just thinking about Australia.", "Quinn: You must be so excited, now that you're joining us.", "Katie: I am, I am. You know, I wouldn't miss it. My sister is finally remarrying the man that she's always been in love with. And she thinks that it's probably gonna be one of the most meaningful and special days of her life, so... it really has to go smoothly.", "Quinn: Good for Brooke. And I hope it does. But what does any of that have to do with me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Oh, you know what? In case nobody told you yet today, you look fabulous.", "Eric: Thank you. Nobody else told me that today.", "Brooke: No?", "Eric: I feel good, too. I think the two of you would understand this better than anybody else, that when -- when Stephanie died, I wasn't certain I was ever gonna be happy again. I didn't trust that at all. And now every day is like a new gift I can't wait to open. Every day -- and it's because of Quinn, this wonderful woman I've married. I feel like I won the lottery, and even more so now that the family's come around. I'm so happy these days. It's all because of you, you know? And I thank you for that. You've stepped out of your comfort zone, and you met Quinn halfway and made it possible for everyone else to follow your lead, so thank you. Thank you.", "Brooke: Katie says she saw you and Quinn discussing jewelry for the photo shoot. Quinn was modeling a necklace for you.", "Ridge: No one -- I don't know what Kat-- no, she wasn't modeling it. She put it on for me so that I could see what it looked like. She's a good designer. Very -- very talented and original.", "Eric: Well, I'm glad you see that. I'm glad you appreciate her talent. You're right. She's very creative. Isn't this wonderful, how two people -- two enemies -- can become friends? Look at this.", "Ridge: Well, I don't know about friends, but she just showed me a side of her I didn't see, and -- and, um... and it was nice. It just took me a while because -- you don't know this about me, but I'm a little stubborn sometimes.", "Brooke: [Gasps] [Mock coughs] Wow. He admits it!", "Eric: He does, he does.", "Ridge: Yes. Point is, all I had to do was listen to her story, and I did. And I heard her, and she was sincere, and she was genuine. Genuine, like she is with you. She loves you, unconditionally, and you know what? That doesn't happen that much anymore these days. How can I be on the wrong side of that?", "Eric: Thank you.", "Brooke: [Chuckles]", "Ridge: I don't want anything to ever come between us again.", "Eric: Nothing ever will. Never again. We're father and son. That's not gonna change, whether we like it or not.", "Brooke: Family. I am so happy to be a part of this wacky and wonderful family. I want you both to know that I will never take it for granted. And I really am very grateful.", "Eric: I don't even remember when she wasn't part of this family. Do you?", "Ridge: No, I don't. I think we're missing a heartbeat.", "Brooke: [Laughs] Well, this is the golden era for us. Eric, you're madly in love with Quinn, and, ridge, you and I are getting married. Liam and Steffy, too. And the best part of all, we're all getting along.", "Ridge: How about that.", "Brooke: You and Quinn, too. As a matter of fact, I never thought that would happen just a few months ago, right?", "Ridge: We found common ground.", "Brooke: People will speculate. They'll come up with all these crazy conclusions, but we don't need to listen to them, right? We just need to pull together as a family.", "Eric: A whole new chapter. I want it to be a clean beginning. Moving into the future. No more guilt about what happened with Quinn. That's all behind us now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Why would Brooke's wedding day and how perfect or imperfect it might be have anything to do with me?", "Katie: Well, you've caused a lot of trouble for people that I love, my family.", "Quinn: I don't do that anymore.", "Katie: You and ridge have been getting along awfully well.", "Quinn: We're a work in progress. But we're getting better. Thank you.", "Katie: Downright chummy, if you ask me.", "Quinn: Is there a point to this? Is there a problem that I can help you with?", "Katie: Should I have a problem?", "Quinn: Why don't you just say what you want to say? Because I'm dying to hear it.", "Katie: You got really lucky landing Eric for a husband.", "Quinn: Yeah, I did.", "Katie: I mean, I'm just making an observation.", "Quinn: Yeah, well, you're in the position to do so. I mean, you're -- you're right there, next door, right? Coming over anytime you want. And, see, I think I know why. 'Cause you want my husband all to yourself.", "Katie: [Chuckles] That is ridiculous.", "Quinn: It is? I mean, you're not even subtle about it. Hanging out with Eric whenever you want, no matter how many times I tell you that I don't want you to. I mean, you and I, we had this woman-to-woman talk -- right? -- Where I told you that -- that I thought it was inappropriate and it made me feel uncomfortable, but didn't listen to me. And now here you are, in my office, and you're lurking about, making insinuations that are offensive and really just plain wrong. So, what's your endgame here, Katie? Are you trying to make up something in your mind that you can take to Eric to turn him against me so you can have him all to yourself? 'Cause I'm warning you... don't.", "Katie: You're warning me? That's interesting.", "Quinn: Yeah. See, I've made a place for myself -- with Eric and in his family. I'm not about to let you take that away from me. So don't make any more trouble between me and Eric, or you'll regret it. [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Bill, I can see hope's car. She's almost here. You have to stop this gondola.", "Hope: Liam!", "Steffy: Marry me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: I don't think I... knew what love was... until I knew I loved you.", "Stephanie: It all adds up to now.", "Brooke: Yes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: So able to depend on each other for anything, right? What a lie!", "[Glass shatters]", "Katie: What a lie, all of it. All of it's lies! All of it! My whole life! My whole life is nothing but lies!"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Unvk6Kr9qE"}
