        "Steffy tells Liam she still needs to finish packing. They cannot be late for the flight to their own wedding. Bill comes by and immediately Liam notices that he is not wearing his necklace. Bill says he is just taking a break from it. RJ laments to Brooke and Ridge that he does not mind staying behind. Brooke kids him that will give him time to spend with new friend Coco. Katie stops by to see if they are ready to leave. RJ tells her to be sure these two get married this time. Thomas stops by Spectra and tells Sally that he is on the way to the airport and he wishes he could take her with him. Darlita is in a fog, dreaming about that dreamy Thomas. Saul is disturbed when he finds out Thomas was there. He rushes in to see if he can find him but Sally says she turned Thomas down. She will not be going to Sydney. Shirley tells her she must. She will run her across the ocean in a dingy if she has to. She can just see the pictures and the videos. They will get millions of hits; she must go. Saul says no, Thomas is a playboy, bad idea. Shirley says this opportunity may never come again. Sally finally says yes, tells Darlita to find the cheapest plane she can find.",
        "Everyone boards the plane; it's like a giant party. Quinn tells Eric that she does not think she will have to worry about anything ever again. Katie keeps her eyes on Ridge. Bill tells Brooke to have a good flight. Ivy tells Thomas that she has lined up some good places to visit and she thinks they all will have fun. Settled in their seats, Eric and Brooke decide to go check out the cabins leaving Quinn and Ridge alone. Katie observes. Shirley tells Saul not to be such a party pooper; Sally is finally showing some gumption. Darlita tells her she could not get her on the same flight but she is still working on it. It's Discount Airlines which no one has ever heard of. She tells Darlita to book her on that flight. Thomas invited her and she is going like a lady and will behave herself. Every time Quinn looks their way Ridge and Brooke are kissing with their hands all over each other. Bill tells Katie that he was so sure by now that Ridge would have pulled one of his stunts and not be coming on this flight. Eric tells Quinn that he is so blessed to have her and they are all together; it is a great feeling. She kisses him and tells him that she loves him but thinks of Ridge."

        "Steffy: Baby...",
        "Liam: Huh?",
        "Steffy: The flight won't. Now, we don't want the bride and groom missing the plane to our own wedding, right?",
        "Quinn: Okay. Tickets?",
        "Eric: On the phone.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, uh, and passports?",

        "R.J.: No, it's just --",
        "Ridge: We know what this means to you.",
        "R.J.: As long as you guys come home Mr. and Mrs., I don't need to see it. I'll stay here. Hold down the fort.",
        "Brooke: And you'll get to spend some time with your new friend, coco spectra.",
        "Sally: What are those?",
        "Darlita: Well, you said to bring you four bolts from the table in the hall.",
        "Sally: Bolts of fabric! Put those back!",

        "Sally: Yeah. Yeah, I see him. Thank you.",
        "Thomas: Hope this isn't a bad time. I'm on my way to the airport.",
        "Sally: Business trip?",
        "Thomas: Sister's wedding. It's a pity you're not gonna be in Sydney. I would take you as my date.",
        "Sally: So you would take me to your sister's glamorous destination wedding...",
        "Thomas: I would if I could.",
        "Sally: Why? To stick it to Steffy?",
        "Thomas: No. Because I actually think we'd have a lot of fun together. Besides, you are gorgeous.",
        "Sally: Well, can't argue with that. We would definitely set the bar beyond fire.",
        "[Sizzles]",
        "Thomas: It's not gonna be the same without you. Ugh, car's waiting. I better go.",
        "Sally: What if I showed up?",
        "Thomas: I hope you do.",
        "Liam: 1, 2, 3, 4. I got the bags.",
        "Steffy: Okay, I'm almost ready, I'm almost ready. Don't rush the bride.",
        "Liam: Pfft, if that were possible, we'd be married already.",
        "Bill: Let's go! Chop, chop! Car's waiting!",
        "Liam: Hey, dad.",
        "Bill: Hey. Need a hand?",

        "Bill: [Grunts]",
        "Liam: Okay! Whoa! Hold on a second.",

        "Bill: Oh, I'm just, uh... taking a break from it.",
        "Brooke: Oh! Be good.",
        "R.J.: Will do.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, be good. No party at the house and no fooling around at the office.",
        "R.J.: No fun while you're gone. Got it.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] That's right.",
        "Katie: Hi!",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Katie: All ready to go?",
        "R.J.: Hey, aunt Katie, can you do me a favor?",

        "R.J.: Make sure these two get married, okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Nothing's gonna stand in our way this time.",
        "R.J.: Oh, did you hear that? My parents are all grown up and ready to settle down. I'm proud of you. Especially you, dad. You finally came to your senses and realized mom's the only woman for you.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "Eric: You okay?",
        "Quinn: I'm just marveling at my life. I'm about to attend Steffy's wedding as your wife, an accepted member of this family.",
        "Eric: Pretty amazing.",
        "Quinn: Mm.",
        "Eric: Not really surprising, though, the way things have been going.",
        "Quinn: Well, the -- the way things have been going, nothing should surprise me anymore.",
        "Shirley: We can't use high-end fabric like this on knock-offs, Saul! You're gonna have to sell it!",
        "Saul: We won't get what we paid for it.",
        "Shirley: Darlita, where's the invoice? Darlita!",
        "Saul: Hey. What's with you?",
        "Darlita: [Sighs] That dreamy Thomas Forrester was here again.",
        "Saul: Is he in there now?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Shirley: Why was Thomas Forrester here?",
        "Saul: Are they onto us? Did they fire coco again?",
        "Sally: Thomas is going on a trip. And he wanted to say goodbye.",
        "Saul: Oh, for good, I hope.",
        "Sally: He's going to his sister's wedding in Australia, and if I were in Sydney, I would be going, too.",
        "Saul: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Crashing one Forrester wedding, that's enough.",
        "Sally: For your information, I was invited as Thomas' date. I'm not going, of course, but it would be something. Could you imagine the look on Steffy's face whenever she saw me?",
        "Saul: If Thomas wants to ruin his sister's wedding, let him do it himself.",
        "Sally: Gee. Thank you.",
        "Shirley: Obviously it wasn't a serious invitation.",
        "Sally: Heck yeah, it was!",
        "Shirley: [Gasps] So Thomas would really take you to the ceremony.",
        "Sally: If I was in Sydney, yeah. He said we would have a really good time. I think he actually likes me.",
        "Shirley: Then you have to do it. You have to go!",
        "Eric: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Do you want me to help you with your bag?",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Eric: Here, I got it.",
        "Thomas: Here, here, here. Let me help you with that.",
        "Ivy: Ahh, thank you!",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: This is so exciting!",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I know, right? I can't wait to see what Steffy has in store for us.",
        "Ivy: Mm...",
        "Thomas: Hmm...",
        "Bill: How fast can somebody get me a scotch around here, huh?",
        "Katie: Uh-oh. Am I gonna regret sitting next to you?",
        "Bill: Well, you could have gotten a seat up front. Next to your sister.",
        "Katie: No, that's okay. This seat is just fine.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Welcome aboard. As soon as you're all settled in, I'll come through and serve some champagne.",
        "Steffy: Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much!",
        "Liam: Cool! Thank you.",
        "Steffy: This is so exciting!",
        "Liam: I know, and with everybody traveling together, it's like a giant party.",
        "Steffy: Yeah! Everyone, I just want to thank you all for making the trip with us. Sydney, here we come, all right?",
        "[Cheering]",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Ohh. Well, this is a little different than the last time I flew overseas, that's for sure.",
        "Eric: Well, you never have to worry about that again.",
        "Quinn: With you, I don't think I ever have to worry about anything, ever again. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Mmm. Just a short little trip, and we'll be married.",
        "Brooke: Yes. I can't wait.",
        "Ridge: Are you good? Do you need anything?",
        "Brooke: Uh, I could use another pillow. Could you get one from the attendant? I am gonna text R.J. and tell him we're already aboard the plane.",
        "Ridge: Good. I'll go get your pillow.",
        "Brooke: [Giggles]",
        "Ridge: Hey. Excuse me, could I get another pillow, please? Yes, sir.",
        "Ridge: Thank you. Hey.",
        "Quinn: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Everything okay?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited for this trip. It's gonna be great.",
        "Ridge: I've, um...",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "[Bell dings]",
        "Bill: Hey. All buckled in and ready to go?",
        "Brooke: I am. If you'd please take your seats, we'll be pushing back shortly.",
        "Bill: Thank you. Well, have a good flight.",
        "Brooke: You, too.",
        "Sally: If you want an update, shifty, you can read the trade papers just like everybody else. [Scoffs] [Whispering] Okay, could you guys stop whispering over there? I know you're talking about me.",
        "Saul: You can't go to this wedding.",
        "Shirley: Oh! I will row you across the pacific in a dinghy if I have to.",
        "Saul: If Thomas really wanted you to be his date, he would have bought you a ticket, right?",
        "Shirley: That is a big step for a first date, even for a Forrester! But if sally just happened to be there...",
        "Saul: Nope. She won't. Nope, she'll be right here, working on the plan that you thought of, Shirley.",
        "Sally: Okay, in case you two forgot, I can't even afford a bus pass right now.",
        "Shirley: Honey, we'll find a way to swing it because you have to go! Just think of the publicity. The pictures, the videos...",
        "Sally: Grams, I might actually like this guy.",
        "Shirley: So?",
        "Sally: So... we're already using coco to poach their designs, which I'm still not a fan of.",
        "Shirley: [Laughs] Just think of it, though. Private pictures of this Forrester wedding. [Gasps] If we put that out there and posted it on our website, we'd get a million hits. Millions of hits! Oh! Darlita! Darlita, get in here.",
        "Saul: She doesn't want to go, Shirley.",
        "Sally: Yeah! Of course, I do.",
        "Shirley: You have to book sally a ticket.",
        "Saul: No! No, she doesn't. Chasing Thomas Forrester, that is a terrible idea. He's a playboy, sally. You know that. He's gonna love you and leave you. I mean, come on! You can't keep up with a guy like that!",
        "Sally: That's a real vote of confidence, Saul.",
        "Shirley: Thomas Forrester invited you to Steffy Forrester's wedding. That does not happen to everybody. Oh, you have to have advantage of this. This opportunity may never come again.",
        "Sally: Darlita, book me a flight.",
        "Darlita: For when?",
        "Sally: Tonight. But please make sure it's cheap. The cheapest and the fastest plane that you can find.",
        "Darlita: Okay.",
        "Steffy: Oh! Thank you.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Thomas: So, are you excited to be going home?",
        "Ivy: Yeah! I mean, L.A. is home, too, but I'm excited to show everyone Australia. Hey, I've organized a whole bunch of sight-seeing trips for everyone, but if you want to get out there and surf, I can organize a board, too.",
        "Thomas: That'd be great.",
        "Ivy: Mm.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: You know, I'm surprised you didn't bring a date along.",
        "Thomas: I thought about it.",
        "Steffy: It's pretty amazing, everyone here to celebrate our relationship.",
        "Liam: I'm really impressed my dad decided to be here.",
        "Steffy: We'll make sure your father has a good time.",
        "Liam: I don't know, he seems to be doing okay so far.",
        "Bill: Hey.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Bill: How's will?",
        "Katie: He is happy as a clam. He's being spoiled by his aunt donna.",
        "Bill: As he should be. Good.",
        "Katie: I bet a part of you, like me, wishes that you were back there with him.",
        "Bill: Yeah. But I'm glad to be here for Liam and Steffy.",
        "Katie: Well, I know they appreciate it. Where's your necklace? Did you leave it at security?",
        "Bill: Wasn't wearing it.",
        "Eric: Uh, we're headed to the lounge. You want to join us?",
        "Ridge: No, thank you.",
        "Brooke: I'm gonna put on my pajamas and try to get some sleep.",
        "Eric: Have you and ridge decided what you're gonna say to each other? Your vows? Have you worked on that yet?",
        "Ridge: Um...",
        "Brooke: I don't think it's gonna be difficult putting our feelings into words.",
        "Eric: We'll catch up with you later.",
        "Quinn: Good night.",
        "Ridge: Good night.",
        "Quinn: Good night. [Laughs]",
        "Sally: I won't let you come in here and tell me that I don't get to have my moment.",
        "Thomas: That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Sally: Thomas, then why are you here? If not to undermine me, why are you here?",
        "Saul: This is a mistake.",
        "Shirley: Don't be such a party pooper! Sally is finally showing some gumption.",
        "Saul: Are you really gonna do this? You're gonna go to Australia?",
        "Sally: Well, if Darlita can book me a flight... hey, d, how's the search coming?",
        "Shirley: You found something?",
        "Darlita: I couldn't get on you the Forrester flight. That already left.",
        "Sally: That's okay. Gives me a little element of surprise.",
        "Saul: I need you to stop and think about this. I know things aren't going the way we planned, but you cannot give up.",
        "Shirley: Who said anything about giving up?",
        "Saul: You're not gonna win the respect of the fashion world by marrying rich!",
        "Darlita: And handsome. And talented. Oh, I found something! And it leaves tonight!",
        "Sally: How much?",
        "Shirley: Oh! Not bad.",
        "Saul: I've never heard of that airline.",
        "Shirley: Discount airways. It looks fine to me. It's got a logo and everything.",
        "Saul: Uh, we need to be focused on the company.",
        "Shirley: This could help the company! It's the perfect smoke screen. No one would ever accuse Thomas Forrester's girlfriend of stealing from him.",
        "Sally: Okay, one, not his girlfriend.",
        "Saul: See?",
        "Sally: And, two, I am not going down there to scoop on Steffy's big day or generate publicity or get my face shoved in another wedding cake. Thomas invited me to a Forrester wedding, so I'm going to go behave like a lady and be honored to be a part of it. Darlita, book me that flight. Ma'am, we're just about to dim the cabin lights.",
        "Steffy: All right. Thank you. Thank you. I guess it's time for us to say goodnight.",
        "Liam: I don't know, I bet we could both find a way to cuddle up right here.",
        "Steffy: I don't think we'd get much sleep in this.",
        "Liam: It's kind of the point.",
        "Steffy: You're bad.",
        "Liam: Am I bad? I'm so bad. I'm so bad.",
        "Steffy: See you in the morning.",
        "Liam: All right. You, too.",
        "Brooke: Did you get R.J.'s text?",
        "Ridge: I did. He's very excited for us.",
        "Brooke: Me, too. We've been headed in that direction for a very long time.",
        "Ridge: Only a few more thousand miles to go.",
        "Brooke: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: You were saying something about will?",
        "Katie: Hmm?",
        "Bill: You keep doing that.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Bill: Looking over at Quinn.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] You know what, I think I am gonna get some sleep.",
        "Bill: You're still so certain that ridge and Brooke are going to tie the knot?",
        "Katie: Yeah, of course. I mean... Brooke's always said that they were meant to be.",
        "Bill: Well, history says otherwise.",
        "Katie: Mm.",
        "Bill: I was so sure that Forrester would do something, pull one of his stunts, screw Brooke over yet again.",
        "Katie: Well, I hope he doesn't.",
        "Bill: You have doubts.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Eric: This is a good look for you.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Thank you.",
        "Eric: Back at the house, you were marveling at your life. I feel the same way about mine. Quinn I'm glad.",
        "Eric: I'm so blessed right now. I have you. I have this wonderful family. All of us together. Steffy's so happy. And ridge and Brooke finally getting married. It's a great feeling. [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Ridge.",
        "Eric: I love you so much.",
        "Quinn: I love you, too.",
        "Brooke: Riiiiiiiidge! [Gasps]",
        "Nicole: You're not my sister, Maya. You're not Maya at all. You're Myron. You're my brother.",
        "Steffy: You targeted Liam! You have messed with my family, and now you are targeting my grandfather! Never again!",
        "Quinn: I love him! [Screams]",
        "Steffy: Never."
