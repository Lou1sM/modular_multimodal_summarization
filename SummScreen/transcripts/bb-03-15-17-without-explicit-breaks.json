    "Recap": [
        "Everybody on the flight enjoys the delicious food. Katie realizes Bill is keeping her company but does not enjoy his direct view of the lovebirds, Brooke and Ridge. Eric tells Quinn that he loves that smile and she replies she has a lot to smile about . .being part of a Forrester wedding party trip. Over on another flight Sally has managed a seat on Discount Airlines and is suddenly surrounded by a couple where one has to have the aisle seat and the other window so poor Sally is caught squished in between. She wants to change seats but the attendant reminds them they need to be quickly seated so there is no time. They seem to spend most of their time fighting and scampering for a bag of peanuts and the guy shakes hands with Sally with his sweaty palms. Later he takes the cold neck brace pillow from around his neck and puts it on Sally. He's ready for a snack, a bison bacon sandwich and he foists a bite upon Sally and then the missus on the other side wants one too, puts on her throw and snuggles up to Sally saying she is cold. As Ridge leaves, Eric takes his seat with Brooke and they marvel that there will be two weddings. He says he could not be more pleased as Ridge has looked the world over and finally decided there is no one better for him than her. Ridge ends up having to sit with Quinn and she is grateful to be along for the ride. She tells him his life is about to change as he is about to become a married man. He says he just wants to keep is simple so he is sorry she is not invited. She is just glad that he accepted her. It is an honor and a privilege.",
        "Katie strains her neck to see what she can see and overhear. She watches as both Quinn and Ridge leave their seats and go further into the cabin. Quinn tells Ridge that she never wants to lose his father. They grasp all four of their hands and he asks if she is sure. Steffy says she is glad Sally Spectra isn't here. Liam says why should she be ..just to shove her face in another piece of cake is a bit of a stretch. The seat mates from hell continue their annoyance and Sally is about ready to barf when the fellow gets a case of the sniffles and starts sneezing all over Sally. Finally the Forrester group land in Sydney led by Ivy who shows them around. Katie finally manages to drag Brooke away and says she needs to talk to her. This is too important and cannot wait. She tells Brooke that on the plane Ridge and Quinn were holding hands and it was intimate. She keeps saying she is not crazy and Brooke needs to talk to Ridge and get to the bottom of this. Brooke assures her she is just wrong. They flew half way around the world to say their vows and there is no way he would jeopardize that for her! Katie begs her one more time to talk to Ridge before it is too late."

        "Katie: Brooke, um, let's go check out the view, okay?",
        "Brooke: Oh, okay. [Laughs] Oh, isn't it wonderful here?",

        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Katie: On the plane before we landed, I saw Ridge and Quinn together.",
        "Brooke: That's because Eric asked Ridge to switch seats. So what?",
        "Katie: No, they were holding hands.",
        "Brooke: You are not going to do this again.",
        "Katie: They were holding hands! It was intimate! Something is going on between the two of them.",
        "Brooke: Katie, please.",
        "Katie: No, you have to listen to me. I'm not crazy. I'm not blind. You have to talk to Ridge and get to the bottom of it.",
        "Brooke: You are wrong, so just stop it. Ridge and I have struggled for 30 years to be together! And here we are. We're going to get married. We're going to say our vows to each other. There is no way he's gonna jeopardize all of that for her. It's ridiculous.",
        "Katie: Brooke. You have to listen to me. Please, you have to find out what's going on. Talk to him before you marry him. Before it's too late."
