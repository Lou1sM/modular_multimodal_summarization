        "Nicole tells Maya that she knows her secret and if she doesn't watch it she will go straight to Rick. Maya says she is not afraid of her. She wants her to pack her bags and leave. She came into her home making accusations but she doesn't know what the problem is. The photo shoot is underway but no Maya. Rick says he has texted her twice but he is sure she will be here soon. Finally she rushes in just as the others had nothing else to do. Katie drops in on Ridge and they discuss her honeymoon. She says Aspen because she wanted to own that place after it being Bill and Brooke's place. She's happy now. She's glad he has Caroline too. Then she spots the nude Caroline portrait. Finally she tells Ridge that she is here because of Brooke, because she is worried about her. Nicole shows up at FC and is told that Maya is at a photo shoot at the Sky Lounge. Maya is before the camera when she spots Nicole and ends up frowning. Rick calls for a quick break to regroup. Rick introduces her to Carter and Oliver, and Nicole says she wanted to see her sister in action. She takes a position on the sidelines but Maya can't get focused and loses her expressions so they call it a quick wrap. Rick tells Nicole she is welcome anytime. She is family, but Maya can't wait to get rid of Nicole. Her sister tells her she is not interested in being an intern. She wants to be a model and all Maya has to do is talk to Rick and make it happen.",
        "Katie tells Ridge that her sister seems aloof, all alone. She wonders if she is checking in at the office. Katie says that Brooke was there for her most of her life and now she wants to be there for her. She and Ridge hug. Aly tells Carter and Oliver that she picked up that Nicole and Maya do not like each other and it is more than just the age difference. She showed up at the house and now she is showing up at work. Maya is astounded that Nicole wants her to find her work here. Nicole says if Maya can model so can she. Maya says here's the deal. She does not want Nicole working here or even living in her house. Nicole accuses her again of being less than welcoming and warns her that she knows her secret and is not afraid to use it. Rick sees them sparring and asks what is up. Maya puts on a stiff upper lip."

        "Nicole: I know your secret, Maya.",
        "Maya: You don't know anything.",
        "Nicole: Be careful with your attitude, or I will go straight to Rick.",
        "Maya: You think I'm scared of you? I'm not. You have no power over me.",
        "Nicole: You sure about that?",
        "Maya: Get out of here. If this is the way you treat family, I don't want you in my life.",
        "Nicole: Well, don't pretend like you welcomed me with open arms.",
        "Maya: I gave you a place to stay.",
        "Nicole: No. Your boyfriend did. If it were up to you, I'd be sleeping on a park bench, just as long as I'm not intruding on your fancy new life.",
        "Maya: I want you gone, Nicole. Pack your bags and leave.",
        "Nicole: Won't Rick wonder why you're kicking me out?",
        "Maya: You have some nerve coming into my home and threatening me, making accusations.",
        "Nicole: If it's not true... then what's the problem?",
        "Oliver: Perfect. Perfect. That's great. All right, try some, like, soft -- yeah. Perfect. I love that. Okay. A little to the left. Nice. Nice.",
        "Aly: So, we're almost ready for the next setup, and Maya's not even here.",
        "Rick: It's not like her to be late. I'm sure she's coming with some of her base makeup done.",
        "Carter: Did you call her?",
        "Rick: I texted her twice. I'm sure she'll be here soon.",
        "Katie: Wow. Check this place out! You finally got the loft space you always wanted.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. I get more done here than I do at the office. There's no distractions.",
        "Katie: No Rick and Maya. How's Caroline?",
        "Ridge: She's grateful the divorce is almost over. It's a little sad.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I guess it's always bittersweet when you end a relationship with someone you used to love.",
        "Ridge: How was your honeymoon?",
        "Katie: It was good. It was beautiful.",
        "Ridge: Where'd you go?",
        "Katie: Um...aspen, actually.",
        "Ridge: Aspen?",
        "Katie: Yeah. You know, I wanted to stay closer to home for will and -- whoa! Wow! What's this?",
        "Katie: Well, it looks like your muse is inspiring something other than fashion these days. I'm sure she appreciates all the support you've been giving her.",
        "Ridge: Well, if anyone knows about divorce, it's me.",
        "Katie: Yes. You are quite the expert.",
        "Ridge: You know what I didn't know? There's a 6-month waiting period before the divorce is final. Did you know that?",
        "Katie: Well, I'm sure Caroline is only planning on doing it once, so...",
        "Ridge: I'm sure she wasn't planning on doing it at all. I think she wanted the relationship to last for a long time -- have a family, you know.",
        "Katie: And no one likes feeling like they've failed at something.",
        "Ridge: If you go into something with an open heart and give it a shot, that's all you can do.",
        "Katie: Yeah. I guess ultimately, it was... out of her hands.",
        "Ridge: So, why are you here?",
        "Katie: Uh, actually, I'm here because of Brooke. I'm worried about her.",
        "Oliver: Beautiful. Beautiful. Let me see the bracelet a little bit.",
        "Rick: All right. All right. I think we got enough of that look.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Yeah. I'm ready to move on.",
        "Aly: We can't without Maya.",
        "Rick: Relax, Aly. We're just gonna have to improvise a little.",
        "Carter: How? Maya's our lead model.",
        "Aly: We've already been stalling as it is.",
        "Maya: Sorry. Sorry I'm late. Hi, baby.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Aly: Are you okay? Where have you been?",
        "Maya: There was something I had to deal with.",
        "Nicole: I want to double-check the address of Forrester Creations. Haragate. Right. Okay. Thanks.",
        "Katie: Uh, maybe this, uh -- this might have been a bad idea.",
        "Ridge: Why?",
        "Katie: Well, we should have an etiquette between us, right? I mean, I-I can't just show up here without calling first. I mean, you could be with your -- with Caroline.",
        "Ridge: Etiquette? Really? Come on. We know each other pretty well.",
        "Katie: Yeah. But we're redefining who we are. I mean, I'm back with Bill, and you're...",
        "Ridge: Yeah, Bill. Is he treating you --",
        "Katie: He is -- he is -- well, is he behaving himself? Is he acting like a gentleman? No, but he's Bill. But he's, um... I like the way he's treating me.",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Interesting destination for your honeymoon, though, wasn't it?",
        "Katie: Yeah, aspen. I mean, Bill wanted to, of course, do something exotic and then take the yacht and --",
        "Ridge: So, why -- why -- why aspen, of all places? Why?",
        "Katie: Well, I guess I can talk to you about this. I mean, I keep telling everyone that it was because of will and that I wanted to be close to him and not be so far away, and that's true. That is true. But a part of me just wanted to reclaim that place, you know? I mean, we're trying to move on and we're trying to get past that part in our lives, and aspen was so much a part of Bill and Brooke's relationship, and I just wanted to... create memories of our own, make it ours. And I feel like I did that, you know? I feel like I can hear the word \"aspen\" and I can smile and not twitch every time I hear it. And we had fun. We skied and we snowboarded and we climbed rocks, and it was -- it was fun.",
        "Ridge: I got to tell you, I'm... you happy?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I am.",
        "Ridge: Well, you deserve that.",
        "Katie: You do, too. I'm glad you have this, you know -- a place to create. I-I-I always wanted you to...",
        "Ridge: You always gave me everything I wanted. It was nothing -- [Sighs] It wasn't like that at all, so... hey. Maybe -- I mean, this place -- [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Well, it's someplace that you can share with your muse. [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm happy. You're happy. There you go.",
        "Katie: Yeah. I just wish my sister was. Head straight through those doors. May I help you?",
        "Nicole: I'm Nicole Avant. I've been here before. I don't have you on the list. I.D.?",
        "Nicole: I'm Maya's sister -- Maya and Rick Forrester. Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't met you before. I believe your sister is up in the sky lounge. Big photo shoot today.",
        "Nicole: Right. Elevator's straight through the door. Take it up to level 3. Sky lounge will be on your left.",
        "Nicole: Thank you. You're welcome.",
        "Maya: Are we good? Okay.",
        "Rick: All right, ladies. We can call it a day. Thank you so much. Good job. Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Carter: Thanks, ladies.",
        "Rick: You look beautiful.",
        "Maya: Thank you.",
        "Rick: Is everything cool? You never told me why you were late.",
        "Aly: So, are we ready?",
        "Oliver: The light's perfect right now. We need to take advantage.",
        "Maya: Great. Let's get to work. If you show what you got then you get what you want stop being a good girl when you show what you got then you get what you want stop being a good girl if you show what you got then you get what you want stop being a good girl when you show what you got then you get what you want stop being a good girl",

        "Oliver: Are you all right? If you show what you got",
        "Oliver: What's going on?",
        "Rick: Let's take five, everyone. Hey! I'm so glad you're here! Hey, everyone, this is Maya's sister.",
        "Carter: Hey. I'm Carter. It's nice to meet you.",
        "Nicole: You, too.",
        "Carter: This is Oliver, our master photographer.",
        "Oliver: Hey.",
        "Nicole: Hi. Hi, Aly.",
        "Rick: Maya didn't tell me you were coming.",
        "Nicole: I thought I'd surprise her -- see my sister in action.",
        "Nicole: So glamorous.",
        "Maya: Believe me -- it's really not all that exciting. You should come back on another day, like when we have a fashion show.",
        "Nicole: Oh, this is fun for me. I've never been to a big photo shoot before.",
        "Maya: Well, we're kind of rushing through it. I got here a little late.",
        "Nicole: That's okay. I don't mind.",
        "Rick: No, stick around. Stick around. Your sister's just being modest. Pay attention to this woman. She's got some serious talent.",
        "Nicole: Oh. What's Maya got going on? Can't keep something like that hidden.",
        "Rick: No, you can't, can you?",
        "Carter: Hey, guys, Oliver says we're losing light.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. We need to get rolling again.",
        "Rick: All right. Let's go. Hey, why don't you, uh -- okay. Great. If you show what you got then you get what you want stop being a good girl when you show what you got then you get what you want stop being a good girl if you show what you got then you get what you want stop being a good girl when you show what you got then you get what you want stop being a good girl",
        "[Instrumental break]",
        "Oliver: What's wrong? Stop being a good girl",
        "Rick: Oliver, why are we stopping?",
        "Maya: You know what, Rick? He's right. I'm kind of tired. Can we be done for today?",
        "Rick: No worries. I think we got what we need. That's a wrap, everybody!",
        "Katie: You saw my sister at the wedding.",
        "Ridge: Well, we all saw your sister.",
        "Katie: She was being good to me, you know, standing up for me, and we're trying to put the past behind us.",
        "Ridge: That was a lot to ask.",
        "Katie: I know, and a part of me thinks I shouldn't have, but she said she was okay with it, so...",
        "Ridge: That's what she said.",
        "Katie: She just seems off. And I know my sister very well.",
        "Ridge: What does donna say?",
        "Katie: Not much. I'd get little bits and pieces, you know, when I was video- chatting with will.",
        "Ridge: She's concerned, yes?",
        "Katie: She's visited donna and will a couple of times. She just seems so aloof. I don't like to think of my sister alone.",
        "Ridge: Brooke is never alone.",
        "Katie: I know. That's my point. I don't know how she's dealing with it. That's why I wanted to check in with you and see if you've talked to her.",
        "Ridge: Not really.",
        "Katie: Has she been into the office?",
        "Ridge: No. I mean, I'm sure she has, but I haven't seen her. It's been a little crazy over there.",
        "Rick: Are you sure you're all right?",
        "Carter: That's a great shot.",
        "Aly: Ooh, that one, too. I really like that angle.",
        "Carter: That looks spectacular. Ridge and Caroline will be pleased.",
        "Nicole: Mm. Can't take a bad pic, can you, sis?",
        "Rick: That's why she's the face of Forrester. The camera adores her.",
        "Nicole: Oh, yeah. Well, no secret there.",
        "Maya: So, we got enough coverage?",
        "Oliver: We should be fine.",
        "Nicole: Hope I didn't get in anyone's way.",
        "Rick: Of course not! You're welcome here anytime. You're family.",
        "Nicole: Thank you, Rick.",
        "Oliver: All right. I'm gonna upload these to the server.",
        "Aly: I'll help.",
        "Oliver: Thanks.",
        "Carter: Nicole, it was great meeting you.",
        "Maya: Sweetie, don't you have a phone interview?",
        "Rick: Oh, that's right. Thank you for reminding me. Uh, great job today.",
        "Maya: You shouldn't have come here.",
        "Nicole: What's the big deal?",
        "Maya: It's bad enough that you've infiltrated my home, Nicole. This is my livelihood. This is my work.",
        "Nicole: Head model. Very prestigious job. I could use some work myself.",
        "Maya: Oh, we're not hiring any interns.",
        "Nicole: Oh. I don't want to be an intern. I want to be a model.",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Nicole: Come on, sis. You've got pull. Talk to Rick. Make it happen.",
        "Ridge: So, you're heading to Brooke's now?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I'm gonna swing by Spencer first and pick up Bill.",
        "Ridge: Really? You think that's a good idea?",
        "Katie: Maybe not. But I don't want her to think that it's just her little sister checking up on her.",
        "Ridge: But it kind of is.",
        "Katie: Yes. But for most of my life, Brooke was the one who was always there for me, and I-I want to be there for her -- you know, return the favor.",
        "Ridge: She's a big girl, Katie.",
        "Katie: But she doesn't do well by herself.",
        "Ridge: True. She's lucky to have you.",
        "Katie: Caroline's lucky to have you.",
        "Ridge: Come here.",
        "Oliver: Anyone else pick up on a vibe?",
        "Aly: Between Maya and her sister? Totally. For some reason, those two do not like each other.",
        "Carter: Maybe it's just the age difference.",
        "Aly: Mm, I get the feeling it might be more than that.",
        "Carter: Like what?",
        "Aly: I don't know.",
        "Oliver: Maya was so loose, into the shoot, and then Nicole walks in, and she stiffens up.",
        "Aly: She was trying not to show it, but her demeanor totally changed.",
        "Carter: Okay. I can tell Maya was surprised to see her. She had no clue she was coming.",
        "Oliver: Maybe Maya was just overwhelmed. I mean, you said they don't know each other that well.",
        "Aly: It's a lot. Nicole moves in to the house, and now she's showing up at work.",
        "Carter: Okay, guys. Family's family. It shouldn't be that big an issue.",
        "Oliver: I'm just thinking there's something going on here that we just don't know about.",
        "Maya: You want me to get you a job -- here?",
        "Nicole: All I'm asking is that you put in a good word with Rick.",
        "Maya: As a model?",
        "Nicole: I don't think it would be too hard to convince him. I mean, after all, I am blessed with the same genes as you.",
        "Maya: You're a computer programmer. You're busy with college.",
        "Nicole: If you can model... I can model.",
        "Maya: Do you really think it's that easy?",
        "Nicole: You put on expensive clothes and smile at the camera. It's not rocket science.",
        "Maya: Here's the problem -- I don't want you working here. I don't want you living in my house.",
        "Nicole: Maya, that's not very nice of you. Sure you want to talk to me like that?",
        "Maya: Or what?",
        "Nicole: You seem a little tense. I'll let you get back to your thing. Oh. Hey. What's on the menu for dinner tonight?",
        "Maya: You cannot be serious.",
        "Nicole: Rick invited me into his home. I'm not leaving, Maya. I know your secret, and I'm not afraid to use it.",
        "Maya: You're bluffing.",
        "Nicole: Try me.",
        "Maya: Trying to control me, trying to blackmail me? What kind of sister does that?",
        "Rick: Is everything okay? Maya? What's going on?"
