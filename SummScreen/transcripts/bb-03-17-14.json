        "Aly almost takes over the meeting and does the most squawking saying a crime was committed and it wasn't those two men in jail. It was Wyatt so let him have his day in court. Eric questions Pam and she readily says yes Wyatt took the diamond and then slipped it in the thieves's bag. Rick and Hope both admit they also knew. Eric is incensed that nobody told him. He yells at them that he was running this company long before any of them were around and now they want to isolate him from it. He should have been told. Aly says it was Quinn and Wyatt. They did not want it to get out. Hope agrees it would have been bad for the line. Aly charges the line was already ruined the minute she chose to protect Wyatt over her message of integrity. Eric wants to hear from Wyatt, why he did this. He admits he took the diamond. He thought it would help the line. Hope adds in that he only wanted to keep it a little while until it got people talking. He says he knows it was dumb and he's not that guy anymore. But he knew it would get publicity and it did. But it did put the company in jeopardy so he is ready to take whatever they throw at him. He explains that he and his mom had to scratch and claw their way, maybe conned a little, just to pay the bills. He realizes that is no excuse but that's his only explanation for his own stupidity. If Eric wants to go to the cops, Wyatt says he will take full responsibility as Hope nor his mom or Rick had anything to do with this. He's Eric's guy. He will do whatever he wants. There are more outbursts from Aly who wants both Wyatt and Quinn arrested. Rick speaks up and says there will be no arrests. Aly is outraged that he is letting Wyatt off the hook. Rick says he is letting all of them off the hook and this is why he didn't want to let this out in the first place. Aly lashes out at all of them and says this is wrong. She won't let Eric adjourn the meeting. She tells Hope that she doesn't want to talk to her; she doesn't want to shadow her anymore. She quits. Then she looks at Wyatt and gnashes her teeth at him ad tells him that she hates him, Mr. Popular. Brooke tells Ridge that she can't wait til RJ comes home and sees him here. Ridge says he is not going to see him here. It's not going to happen. Brooke says her son wants him here and she is not going to let him down. He says he can't do this anymore, all the complications and issues. She says no issues; it will be a drama free zone. He laughs. She doesn't believe he means it when he says he is going to Katie and won't be coming back. He respects Brooke and that is why he is telling her the truth right now but she doesn't want to hear it. Katie gives him honesty and a life without complications and that is what he wants. She cries that she can give him that and so much more. He is not going to give up on them. He says he has given up. It's done; his heart is with Katie now. She tries to stop him when he wants to leave; this is where he belongs. He says he is sorry but no it isn't anymore."

        "Brooke: Starting today.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, I didn't come here --",
        "Brooke: This is very doable. We've done this before. We can do it again.",
        "Ridge: Well, I can't deny that.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] We've always managed to get through everything.",
        "Ridge: Can't deny that, either.",
        "Brooke: We have a family. Our son wants you here at home. And know you won't abandon him. It's not like you. Just come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: What has happened to you?",
        "Katie: I fell in love, Donna. Is that not allowed?",
        "Donna: Great. You're all gaga over Ridge. Who the hell is it, Katie? He's not just any guy.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. He's Ridge of \"The Brooke and Ridge show.\"",
        "Donna: And that doesn't bother you?",
        "Katie: Of course it did at first. But Brooke's condescending attitude has made it bother me a little bit less every day.",
        "Donna: Okay, so you're still angry with Brooke.",
        "Katie: I'm gonna forgive you for saying that, because what's happening with Ridge and me, it's the real thing.",
        "Donna: Brooke is with him right now. She wants him back, Katie. Are you really ready to fight your big sis for the man that she has loved her entire life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: A crime was committed, and it wasn't by those two men in jail. It was committed by Wyatt.",
        "Carter: That's not for us to determine, Aly.",
        "Aly: Fine. Let him have his day in court.",
        "Eric: Pam, you -- you know a lot about this?",
        "Pam: Well, yes, but what Aly's saying is, for the most part, true, Eric. When Charlie wasn't looking, Wyatt did steal the diamond. And when those two men just happened to arrive at the boutique to rob the store, he put the diamond in their bag.",
        "Eric: So, you do know a lot about this. Rick, what about you?",
        "Rick: Regrettably, yes.",
        "Eric: And, Hope, you know about this?",
        "Hope: Yes, I knew.",
        "Eric: And nobody said anything to me?!",
        "Quinn: We were trying to protect you, Eric.",
        "Eric: Protect me?",
        "Rick: Deniability --",
        "Eric: This is my company! Forrester was here a long time before any one of you was in this room with me! I've been the head of this business for almost 50 years, and -- and you all decide all of a sudden that you're gonna -- you're gonna isolate me from it?! I should have been told!",
        "Rick: I understand.",
        "Eric: Stop. Wait. [Sighs] Never do this again. [Sighs] Why wasn't I told?",
        "Aly: Quinn and Wyatt. They kept it a secret.",
        "Hope: We knew that if this got out, it would damage the company, it would damage the line.",
        "Aly: The damage was already done, Hope. Everything you stood for went up in smoke the minute you chose to protect Wyatt over your message of integrity. How could you do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: I don't want to see you get hurt again.",
        "Katie: See, now you're starting to sound like Brooke.",
        "Donna: Katie, you've got to back away. There is no happy ending to this.",
        "Katie: You mean for me, because Brooke always gets what she wants.",
        "Donna: Katie, they're a couple. They're a couple, and they share a son just like you and Bill.",
        "Katie: No, no. Bill and I are not a couple. And we're never, ever going to be again.",
        "Donna: Honey, I hate to burst your bubble.",
        "Katie: Then don't. All right? Stop trying. I'm in love, Donna. I never thought this could happen to me again, but it has. I'm in love with Ridge, and I want a future with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Ridge, we've been through far worse than this.",
        "Ridge: You're making it sound like this is some kind of a phase I'm going through, and it isn't.",
        "Brooke: I'm not discounting your feelings for Katie. She's a wonderful person, and she's gonna find a wonderful man. Just not gonna be you. We've all suffered a lot. There's been a lot of blame cast around, and I take responsibility in that, but that doesn't solve the problem.",
        "Ridge: The problem?",
        "Brooke: Mistakes have been made. Mistakes need to be corrected.",
        "Ridge: You got to listen to yourself. You sound like a C.E.O. right now.",
        "Brooke: In this house, I am. We need to put our lives back together. Yours, mine, Katie's, and all of the children's. [Sighs] Katie's not gonna get what she wants. It's not gonna solve the problem. Besides, you wouldn't even be happy with her. Not when your son is longing for you and not when you are longing for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: All right, Wyatt. It's you now. Speak up.",
        "Aly: You can't believe a word he says.",
        "Eric: Aly, no. Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: Aly's right. I took the diamond.",
        "Eric: Tell me why.",
        "Wyatt: I just -- I thought it would help the line.",
        "Aly: You thought it would help yourself.",
        "Hope: Wyatt's intention was just to pocket it for a little bit, just so people would start talking. That's it.",
        "Wyatt: Look, it was dumb, and I can honestly say to you I-I'm not that guy anymore.",
        "Pam: [Scoffs] Well, it's a little late for that sentiment.",
        "Wyatt: What I did was wrong. And would I do it again? No. Looking back, I-I was ashamed, and I... no, you know what? I'm not. I did it for the line and, yes, for the namesake and for the company, too. I knew that it would get publicity, and it did, more than we ever could have imagined. And yes, it was -- it was risky, and I-I put the company in jeopardy, so I'm ready for whatever you want to throw at me.",
        "Aly: Finally, something I agree with.",
        "Eric: God, Wyatt, what were you thinking?!",
        "Wyatt: I wasn't.",
        "Eric: How can you do something that reckless?!",
        "Quinn: We all make mistakes, and we all move beyond them.",
        "Aly: You just don't want to see your son in prison where he belongs.",
        "Wyatt: I don't want to hear another word out of you! And, Mom, please. Look, it's no excuse, okay? But before my mom and I started working here, our lives were very different. We were building a business. We had to scratch and claw our way and maybe even con a little, but we didn't hurt anybody. We were just working to -- to pay the bills, and -- and that's not an excuse, Eric. I-I know that. And I understand that. And it's just -- this is my explanation for my own stupidity, okay? If you go to the cops, I will take full and complete responsibility. My mom had nothing to do with this. Hope and Rick had nothing to do with this, either. I'm your guy, okay? I will confess to the authorities, whatever you want. Just... just say the word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Bet you never thought I'd be in this position -- going up against Brooke for a man. I mean, how could I ever possibly compete, right?",
        "Donna: Oh, Katie, stop. You can compete with anyone. It's not the issue here.",
        "Katie: No, the issue is what Ridge wants.",
        "Donna: Brooke is the whole reason that Ridge came back from Paris.",
        "Katie: But he doesn't want her now, not after what she's done.",
        "Donna: Okay, fine, he was disillusioned. He felt horrible for you. Yeah, he was disgusted with Brooke, and no wonder you guys bonded over something like that.",
        "Katie: It may have started like that, but it's more now.",
        "Donna: But the thing you have to ask yourself -- and you really have to answer it truthfully -- does he no longer love Brooke? This thing that they've had their whole adult life of breaking up and making up and the history, the family, and the memories, all the successes at Forrester -- is Ridge really ready to let that go? Is he truly done with Brooke?",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Seems like that's all we're doing our whole lives -- just fixing it.",
        "Brooke: Oh, come on. Yes, we've had problems, but the success of a marriage isn't whether or not you have problems.",
        "Ridge: Success of a marriage is about growing together.",
        "Brooke: That's right! And that's exactly what we're doing. We're growing together. We're working through this. I miss you. I do. I miss everything about you. I miss the feel of your skin...",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: ...Your touch. You miss that, too, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Wyatt, you put this whole company in a very dangerous place!",
        "Quinn: The damage is done. No harm, no foul.",
        "Aly: What about those two men in prison? They are innocent!",
        "Carter: They're definitely not innocent. Attempted armed robbery.",
        "Hope: That's way worse than what Wyatt did.",
        "Aly: How can you defend him? Look at what he's done to this company, to your clothing line. Look at what he's done to you, Hope. Everything you stood for... your message, your values. He poisoned it. How can you not care? How can you not care?!",
        "Hope: Yes, I care! Of course I care! Do you think that I let him get off scot- free when he told me? No! I didn't! But I know how to be tolerant, and I know that there are some things that you have to make an exception for!",
        "Aly: For a man who's a criminal, who stole you away from Liam!",
        "Eric: We have a decision to make here.",
        "Aly: There is only one decision, Grandpa. The police should be called. They should both be arrested.",
        "Wyatt: My mom had nothing to do with this!",
        "Aly: She covered up your crime!",
        "Eric: If you had tried to pull something off like this at your father's company, he would have thrown you under the bus and walked away!",
        "Rick: Dad, would you allow me to handle this?",
        "Eric: Yeah, I think that's a really good idea.",
        "Rick: Wyatt, what you've done is an embarrassment to all of us. It's disrespectful. The publicity you gained for our company wasn't even legit, and frankly, I have to question if you're even the right person for my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Ridge said that he would come home to me, and I believe him.",
        "Donna: I'm sure he really meant it.",
        "Katie: One meeting with Brooke is not a game-changer. He's committed to this. He's committed to me.",
        "Donna: Honey, he's made that same commitment to Brooke a hundred times.",
        "Katie: Don't. Stop. Please. Please. I know what I'm up against, all right? I mean, I have -- have thought that this can't possibly be real, that Ridge will never leave Brooke, because that's what I've heard for years. But I got to tell you something, Donna. The guy who left here wasn't thinking about Brooke. I mean, we were so close.",
        "Donna: Oh, God, Katie, please, please tell me you did not make love to Ridge. Tell me.",
        "Katie: No. Not yet. But that's where we are in our relationship.",
        "Donna: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: He's thinking of naming a line after me. I... I inspire him. I make him happy. We share a vision, a vision of a life that we both want. And maybe I am fooling myself. Maybe I can never give him what Brooke did, but... I can give him me. And that seems to be what he wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Of course, if the spark is gone, well, then...",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] There's never gonna be another woman like you.",
        "Brooke: There's never gonna be another couple like us. [Sighs] I can't wait for R.J. To come home and see you here.",
        "Ridge: He's not gonna see me here.",
        "Brooke: Our son is depending on me, and I'm not going to let him down. Neither are you.",
        "Ridge: No, I'm not. I'm gonna be there for R.J. whenever he needs me.",
        "Brooke: But he wants you here, Ridge, in our home.",
        "Ridge: It's not gonna happen.",
        "Brooke: We raised our child with the love of two parents, and I'm not about to change that. So if you need to go talk to Katie, do that. R.J. will be home when you get here, and so will I.",
        "Ridge: I don't want to do this anymore.",
        "Brooke: Do what?",
        "Ridge: This. The complications and the issues. I just don't want to do it.",
        "Brooke: There won't be any issues. This is gonna be a drama-free zone.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Ridge: Okay, sure.",
        "Brooke: I'm serious. I'm gonna keep it really simple for you.",
        "Ridge: We will love our son. We'll raise him together. And he will understand. But this doesn't work for me anymore.",
        "Brooke: But it will work. We're going to make it work for our son and for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Rick, my relationship with Wyatt isn't the issue here.",
        "Pam: Well, I would disagree with that, Hope.",
        "Quinn: He did it to benefit HFTF, and he did quite successfully. Look at the numbers!",
        "Aly: This company isn't a money machine. It is a family business, and you are not family. And neither he is.",
        "Rick: Aly, stop! Do you see what you've done? Do you see the conflict that you have caused?",
        "Wyatt: Look, I-I am sincerely sorry for all of this. I am. And you're right. A part of me maybe did this to impress Hope, but there was a greater part of me that wanted to put her and the line front and center where I believe that it belongs. Look, you don't have to tiptoe around it anymore. You just -- you want to call the cops, call the cops. I'll deal with the consequences.",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Rick: No arrests will be made. Anything that we spoke of here today will not leave this room.",
        "Aly: You are letting him off the hook?!",
        "Rick: I'm letting us off the hook, including you! This is the whole reason why I didn't want this out in the first place! If this goes public, everything we've worked for, including Hope's line, will be lost!",
        "Aly: We can't let him get away with this, Uncle Rick!",
        "Rick: I have made my decision.",
        "Eric: Aly, listen. Listen to me.",
        "Aly: What has happened to you?! Don't you see what he has done to us, to Hope?!",
        "Eric: All right, everybody. This is adjourned.",
        "Aly: No! This is wrong! He is evil! Pam, say something!",
        "Hope: Aly!",
        "Aly: You are letting him control you!",
        "Hope: Do you want to go talk about this in Rick's office?",
        "Aly: No, I do not want to talk to you. And you know what, Hope? I don't want to shadow you anymore, either! I quit. Do you hear that, everyone? I quit. I quit! And you. I hate you so much! Mr. Popular.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You don't want to hurt Katie. Well, neither do I. But she had to know you were gonna come back to me.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I'm not coming back, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: You don't mean that.",
        "Ridge: I do mean it. And I respect you so much. That's why I'm telling you the truth right now, but you don't want to hear it.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, we haven't even had time together since you came back from Paris. We need some time to connect. Look, I-I know that you're caught up in something, but --",
        "Ridge: Stop. Shh. Stop. It's more than that.",
        "Brooke: She's a wonderful person, but she's not gonna make you happy.",
        "Ridge: She gives me honesty, and she gives me a life without complication, and that's what I want.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, I can give that to you. I can give you so much more than that. Look at me. The woman that you shared so much love with. You're not -- [Sighs] You're not gonna give up on us. You're not.",
        "Ridge: I have given up. It's done. [Sighs] My heart is with Katie now.",
        "Brooke: How can you say that?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I'm going home to Katie.",
        "Brooke: Stop. Don't. This is your home, Ridge. This is where you belong.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] No. Not anymore. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]"
