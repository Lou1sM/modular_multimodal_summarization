    "Recap": [
        "Rick asks Maya what is going on. Maya says it is just sister stuff, nothing he has to get into. Nicole says she is being treated fine. With perks like this she will never leave. Alone Maya tells her she does not know who she is dealing with. She won't get what she wants by making threats like she has. Bill and Katie stop by Brooke's and explain that the honeymoon is over and they just wondered if anything happened while they were gone. Brooke says not everybody listens to her advice but Deacon got engaged to Quinn. Katie tells her they went to Aspen because she wanted to stay closer to home. Brooke gasps but says good choice. Brooke says she is not where she would like to be at this point in her life but she is trying to get out and about. And Katie does not have to check up on her. Will has his family back together and she is very happy about that. She wishes her and Bill a very successful life. Maya fills Carter in on her sister and wants him to run a background check, ASAP, whatever he can find out about her. Nicole asks Pam if she might speak with Rick. Then him that he asked about Maya and her before so she thinks he deserves to know. She admits there has been tension between the two of them. They have been apart but she knows her more than Rick does. She says she does not want to make trouble. Rick says she won't. Maya knows how much he values honesty and he would not be with her if she wasn't.",
        "Maya walks in before Nicole can say more. Rick tells Nicole that Caroline kept secrets from him but Maya never has. Pam overhears Maya and Nicole arguing when Rick leaves. Brooke heads for the Vodka when Bill and Katie leave but then thinks better of it and puts it down. She calls Deacon who tells her not to open the bottle; he will be right over. He starts to tell Quinn but she says that should be confidential if he is going to help a friend. Maya checks back in with Carter who relays that Nicole quit at UCLA and only took extension courses. Maya has no clue what she is doing now but she hopes she has enjoyed her last day at Forrester Manor. Deacon gets to Brooke's as quickly as he can. She apologizes and says she over-reacted. She did not want to be alone and the drink would make her feel better. She does not want to feel like this anymore. He reminds her that she called him and she does not have to feel like this anymore; he is there to help. Pam adds fuel to the flame to Rick about Maya and Nicole, like they were sizing each other up. He is hoping they can learn how to be sisters again like she and Stephanie did. Maya comes home and says she thought she and Nicole should talk in private. She does not want things to go this way. She feels bad that they haven't stayed in touch. But now she feels like she is being manipulated. There is no reason for Nicole to be here. She is not at UCLA so she lied to Maya and tricked Rick to give her a space to stay. She came to L.A. with her own agenda. Nicole points out the surroundings and it is Maya who has an agenda. Maya says she has nothing to be ashamed of or to hide. Nicole says she better get used to losing this as this could come tumbling down if Nicole said only one little word."

        "Bill: Well, the guy should listen to you. You, uh, certainly know what you're talking about.",
        "Brooke: That's about all that's happened around here lately. So, how 'bout you? How was your honeymoon? Was it good?",

        "Carter: Maya, I'm not dating your sister.",
        "Maya: Her background. She's a student at UCLA. She transferred from another school. I need to know which one and why. Anything you can get on her, I want to know -- today. I'm not asking you to do anything shady. Just make a few phone calls.",
        "Carter: About your sister.",
        "Maya: Start at UCLA.",
        "Carter: Why can't you?",
        "Maya: Because I don't want it coming back to me. Please, Carter, I want her out of my house, out of my life!",
        "Carter: What do you expect me to find?",
        "Maya: You might not find anything, but I have to do something. She can't just show up and destroy [Voice breaking] everything that I've been building.",
        "Carter: Maya, calm down, all right? I'll do it. Just relax. You're acting stranger than usual.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Marketing wasn't here long.",
        "Rick: I told them to come back when they have an actual idea to present. Pam, I don't have all day to brainstorm for every department in this building.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Nicole: Rick, do you have a minute?",
        "Pam: Uh, well, he does now.",
        "Rick: Sure.",
        "Nicole: You asked a question earlier -- what's going on between Maya and me. I think you deserve to know.",

        "Brooke: [Sighs] Aspen is so beautiful. That's it? No more?",

        "Brooke: I'm -- I'm just not where I thought I would be at this point in my life. But you are where I hoped you would be, back with the man that you love, raising your child together. I mean, it's really sweet that the two of you stopped by, but, really, you don't have to check up on me like this.",

        "Carter: Avant -- A-V-A-N-T. Nicole Avant. She's a transfer student. Are you sure? Okay. Will the bursar's office have more information? I see. No. No, no, no. Thank you. That's -- that's all I need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: You were right. There has been tension between Maya and me.",
        "Rick: You've been apart for a long time.",

        "Nicole: That's part of it.",
        "Rick: Is there something else?",
        "Nicole: Maya doesn't want to make a big deal out of it, and neither do I. I just -- I want everything to be cool, you know? I told you I didn't want to be any trouble.",
        "Rick: And you haven't. But if there's something going on, I'd like to know. Maybe I can help. Look, Maya and I -- we don't keep anything from each other. She knows how important honesty is to me. Nothing's an act with her, unlike all the other women I've been with, especially my ex-wife.",
        "Nicole: You really trust her?",
        "Rick: I wouldn't be with her if I didn't.",
        "Maya: Nicole. I thought you left.",

        "Rick: I was just telling Nicole how much I appreciate your honesty.",
        "Nicole: Sounds like it's the key to your whole relationship.",
        "Rick: It's certainly one of them. Caroline kept secrets from me. Maya's never done that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Nicole says there's been friction between you two.",
        "Maya: I don't want Rick bothered with this, Nicole. You have enough to deal with.",
        "Rick: So do you, especially with my family. I'd like to see you actually getting along with yours. You and Nicole aren't that close. This is an excellent opportunity for you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rick: Living together in the house...",
        "Nicole: Seeing each other around the office...",
        "Rick: This is Rick. Yeah. Can you hold? It's the cutting room. They got some questions for me. Apparently, Ridge and Caroline are AWOL. Hey, whatever's going on between you two, I know you can work it out.",
        "Maya: You orchestrated that.",
        "Nicole: He knew something was wrong. He said you might be feeling a little guarded -- just give it some time. You'll come around.",
        "Maya: Don't hold your breath.",
        "Nicole: You should have heard him, Maya, going on and on about how honest you are.",
        "Maya: This isn't the way to get help from me, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: I don't want help. I want in. At least we're being honest. It feels pretty good. Why don't you give it a try? Let's get Rick back in here, and you can be honest with him.",
        "Maya: I have been.",
        "Nicole: Oh, right. You don't lie -- Miss Perfect. But we all have secrets, Maya, don't we? You don't want to talk about it here? We'll discuss it later. But this isn't over. I'll see you at home.",

        "Deacon: Um, what -- what happened?",
        "Brooke: I really want a drink.",
        "Deacon: Where are you?",
        "Brooke: I'm at -- at home.",
        "Deacon: Okay, listen. Don't reach for the bottle. I'll be right over, okay?",
        "Quinn: Someone from your meeting?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. It's somebody I told that I'd help if they got into a jam.",
        "Quinn: Well, you better go.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, you got to know something about this person.",
        "Quinn: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Isn't that supposed to be confidential?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. We're not, you know, supposed to talk about the people that are at our meetings.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Well, my fianc\u00e9 is the kind of man who steps up when someone's in trouble. That's all I need to know. Mm. You better go before he does something he's gonna regret.",

        "Pam: Maya and Nicole. I mean, for sisters, they just don't seem very close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Well, if the patents were inaccurate -- so, you think I made a mistake? No.",
        "Maya: I got your text.",
        "Carter: Look, I got to call you back.",
        "Maya: So, what did you find out about my sister?",
        "Carter: She goes to UCLA?",
        "Maya: Yeah, computer science. I don't think she's been there very long.",
        "Carter: No, not long at all.",
        "Maya: What do you mean?",
        "Carter: She quit.",
        "Maya: She dropped out?",
        "Carter: She wasn't full-time. She was taking extension classes.",
        "Maya: She lied to me.",
        "Carter: Why would she do that?",
        "Maya: It doesn't matter. But I hope Nicole has enjoyed her last night at the Forrester estate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Hey, Brooke. I got here as soon as I -- Brooke, whatever happened, that's not gonna help. Okay, what's -- what's going on?",
        "Brooke: I shouldn't have called.",
        "Deacon: No! No. You did the right thing.",
        "Brooke: The house just felt so empty. I overreacted.",
        "Deacon: To what?",
        "Brooke: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Deacon: Well, you don't want that, either.",
        "Brooke: Just one...little... glass.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, put it down.",
        "Brooke: And why not...",
        "Deacon: Please, just --",
        "Brooke: ...If it makes me feel better?",
        "Deacon: You drink that, you're not gonna feel better.",
        "Brooke: I don't want to feel like this anymore!",
        "Deacon: Brooke, please, listen to me. Don't do this to yourself. All right? You called me. I'm here. I'm here to help you. Whatever -- whatever \"this\" is, you don't have to face this alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Maya and Nicole haven't seen each other for a long time.",
        "Pam: Well, I guess that could explain it.",
        "Rick: Explain what?",
        "Pam: Well, the way they look at each other. I mean, I glanced in here when -- the door was open. I was just bringing in a file. But it was like they were sizing each other up.",
        "Rick: Oh. And you and Stephanie never looked at each other like that?",
        "Pam: No, we did. But if you recall, things were not exactly hunky-dory between me and Steph when I first arrived here.",
        "Rick: But living together was a good thing. I think it'll be the same thing for Maya and Nicole.",
        "Pam: Do you know how Maya feels about that?",
        "Rick: [Sighs] Maya has been on her own for a long time. Her family didn't support her the same way they supported Nicole. And I know firsthand what kind of resentment that can bring. But, honestly, I think Maya and Nicole can move past it. This could really open things up. And who knows? Maybe they could actually learn how to be sisters again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: That didn't take long.",
        "Maya: I thought we should talk in private.",
        "Nicole: I just made a sandwich. Want one?",
        "Maya: No. I just want you to know, Nicole, that this isn't the way I wanted things to go. I was thrilled when you first got here. We hadn't seen each other in a long time, and I felt bad that I hadn't stayed in touch.",
        "Nicole: Me, too.",
        "Maya: It was strange being together at first, but I was excited. My little sister, going to college in L.A., studying computer science. I thought, \"this is finally a chance for us to get close.\" But then I started to feel manipulated by you, like you were trying to control me.",
        "Nicole: Oh, no. Is this your way of telling me I won't be modeling for Forrester?",
        "Maya: I know the truth about you, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: I think you've got that backwards.",
        "Maya: There's no reason for you to be here.",
        "Nicole: I was invited.",
        "Maya: You don't go to UCLA. You were never in the computer-science department, and you took extension classes until you dropped out.",
        "Nicole: Do you know how hard it is to get into that program, how competitive it is? People from all over the world --",
        "Maya: You lied to me. You tricked Rick into feeling sorry for you. There was no roommate problem, no dorm. You came to L.A. with an agenda.",
        "Nicole: I came to L.A. to find my sister, to relate to you -- have your attention, a little guidance, a little love. Mom and Dad were hard on you. Well, it wasn't easy for me, either. And now we're sisters reunited again, and you want to turn your back on me again? You want to talk about an agenda? Look where we are. Built yourself a whole new life here. But if I tell your secret... it'll all come crumbling down.",
        "Maya: Do you think you have something on me? You don't... because there is nothing that I am ashamed of.",
        "Nicole: Are you really ready to say goodbye to all of this? Because I could take it all away, Maya, with one word -- one word."
