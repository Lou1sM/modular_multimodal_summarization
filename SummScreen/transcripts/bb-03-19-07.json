        "Phoebe: Kinkaid.",
        "Rick: Drew is coming to the wedding from London? Just put him at the table with Tommy. They're old friends.",
        "Phoebe: Can't a secretary do this?",
        "Rick: No. Because they don't know which VIP is going to slit some other VIP's throat because they don't get along.",
        "Ridge: Hey, Phoebe? Could you get me the Rodeo Drive plans from my office? Our interior designer has all the fitting rooms looking like cubbyholes. And a felt-tip pen, please.",
        "Phoebe: Dad, can you do it? I mean, we're only on the Ks.",
        "Ridge: Okay, you're busy. I'll be right back.",
        "Phoebe: Why?",
        "Ridge: Why what?",
        "Phoebe: Why work in here, when you keep finding everything you need's in your office?",
        "Ridge: You're right. I'll be in there if you need me.",
        "Phoebe: We'll be fine.",
        "Rick: You can be such a brat sometimes.",
        "Phoebe: Well?",
        "Rick: Well, I'm just making a mental note, for future reference.",
        "Phoebe: He can't trust us in my grandfather's office with at least 50 other people roaming these halls?",
        "Rick: Come on, who's next?",
        "Phoebe: Me. How long am I going to be on your VIP list? If I still am?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Well, I suppose the question is, how exactly to arrange it?",
        "Donna: Well, I can think of another one. Is what we're considering better or worse than what Ridge is doing to those kids? He at least can say he's acting from fatherly motives, whether he's right or wrong.",
        "Jackie: All we're discussing here is a way to help Phoebe and Rick follow their true feelings.",
        "Donna: There's a little more to it than that. Engineering a way so Ridge can find them in some intimate situation --",
        "Jackie: To confront him with just how wrong he is.",
        "Donna: To hope he crosses Brooke's line in the sand and she breaks it off with him.",
        "Jackie: So, do you think he's good for your sister? Have you forgotten how he toyed with you, and then quite unceremoniously dumped you?",
        "Donna: No.",
        "Jackie: Well, then maybe you're just a little bit worried that if she does get rid of Ridge and his family, that she will come back to Nicky, and Forrester Creations, and you will slip down the totem pole?",
        "Donna: I am not so completely selfish as all that. But trying to play my own sister like a ping pong ball --",
        "Jackie: All we're doing here is trying to help Brooke free herself, so that she can follow her feelings, too. I mean, the only reason that she ran back to Ridge was because Nicky disappointed her. And now she's trapped. If you could've seen Nicky last night with her -- the most bitter regret of his life is losing Brooke and her family. Taylor is a marvelous woman -- marvelous woman -- but she's just a substitute for what he really wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Make sure this gets filed. Make sure you file that, also. Thanks, Meriah. Hey, also -- Meriah, would you hold all my calls, please?",
        "Meriah: Yes, sir.",
        "Taylor: Wow, it feels good to take precedence.",
        "Nick: Sorry about my mother bringing Hope by last night.",
        "Taylor: No, don't be silly. Your commitment to that little girl is one of the things I love about you. The one thing I wish I could change is your mother pining away for you to get back with Brooke.",
        "Nick: Well, don't take that too seriously.",
        "Taylor: No, no, it's understandable. I'm sure she associates me with Stephanie, not her favorite person in the world. But I wanted you to know that I'm okay. I'm okay with what happened last night.",
        "Nick: Are you? Well, like I said -- don't take what my mother said too seriously. And I would like the opportunity to drive that point home.",
        "Taylor: Would you?",
        "Nick: I would.",
        "[Intercom buzzes]",
        "Taylor: Shouldn't you get that?",
        "Nick: I thought I said to hold all my calls --",
        "Taylor: Yeah. But what if it was important? It might be important.",
        "Nick: This is pretty important to me. [Intercom buzzes] I'll be right back. [Intercom buzzes] I thought I said to hold my calls. Oh, God. Oh, I forgot all about that. Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll be right with you. Look, I got a lunch appointment that just showed up. So, I got to owe you one, baby.",
        "Taylor: Oh, yeah, you will.",
        "Nick: You dress me, I'll dress you.",
        "Taylor: Boy, this acting like a teenager is kind of fun and racy.",
        "Nick: Is this what you were like as a teenager?",
        "Taylor: No, I was very serious. I was very shy.",
        "Nick: Like your daughter?",
        "Taylor: No, I was more serious and more shy. I don't know, if I had met some hot guy like Rick Forrester, I might have -- I don't know, acted like a crazy, racy teenager.",
        "Nick: Not like it's the end of the world.",
        "Taylor: You talk to me about that when Hope is 18.",
        "Nick: God, these kids -- all the stress they're going through. Your ex and my ex possibly breaking up over it -- should we send them a sympathy card or a thank you card?",
        "Taylor: For what?",
        "Nick: Well, if they hadn't dumped us, this wouldn't be happening.",
        "Taylor: I think a thank you card.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: You talked to Phoebe. You said yourself her feelings haven't changed.",
        "Donna: No. And I know Rick's haven't, either. They're just hiding them.",
        "Jackie: We have to act. Brooke is away, the wedding is looming.",
        "Donna: I don't see why we have to do anything. Rick and Phoebe work together, they see each other all the time. Why can't we just trust nature to take its course?",
        "Jackie: Maybe we can. But no one is going to be helped. Nothing is going to be prevented unless ridge sees that it is not over. And call me a pessimist, but I don't think that we can rely on nature to take ridge into its confidence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Are you actually saying that you're not important to me?",
        "Phoebe: Well, I know I was. I hope I still am. But how long are we just going to rely on thoughts?",
        "Rick: Phoebe, if you think that because we are not making out or having sex, that I am going to go elsewhere, then you don't know me very well.",
        "Phoebe: I don't think that at all. But thank you for saying it.",
        "Rick: Then what do you think?",
        "Phoebe: That we love each other, but love can die of starvation. You know?",
        "Rick: No. No, I don't know.",
        "Phoebe: I -- I don't know. I was just -- I was talking to someone last night, and she got me thinking about how my parents couldn't keep their hands off of each other. And we all just learned to knock before we entered a room. And, you know, even after they were separated, you could still feel something there. Now, when they look at each other, it's like, they don't even -- they don't even remember what they saw in each other. They forgot. I think time does that.",
        "Rick: Maybe it does.",
        "Phoebe: Well, what's to say that's not going to happen to us? I mean, here we are, trying to keep how we feel from ourselves, I mean, waiting for the right time, not even knowing if that right time is going come. Meanwhile, what?",
        "Rick: Meanwhile, Phoebe, I think about you every second of every minute of every day. What else can I do?",
        "Phoebe: I need something. We don't have anything to fall back on. I mean, I go over every conversation we have in my head, all of the time, wondering if you really meant what I thought you meant, or if I was just -- I don't know, hearing what I wanted to hear --",
        "Rick: Well, like what? Like what? I'll say it again.",
        "Phoebe: Well, I just -- I need more to remember. I want what we have to get stronger, and not more watered down. And I don't need to make out or make love to get something real from you.",
        "Rick: Okay. What are you doing?",
        "Phoebe: Everyone is so concerned with protecting my innocence. I can protect my own, thank you very much. Take it off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Ridge: Oh.",
        "Taylor: Well, hello to you, too. I'm looking for Phoebe. I want to take her to lunch.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, I was hoping you were her.",
        "Taylor: What, is she missing?",
        "Ridge: No, she's working in dad's office with Rick. They're presumably working.",
        "Taylor: Okay. I'll go get her.",
        "Ridge: No, wait, wait, wait. Come here. She'll think that I sent you, that I'm checking up on her. You know how I hate having the two of them be alone together. So just wait.",
        "Taylor: So you're waiting over here?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Taylor: That's progress.",
        "Ridge: Well, I love our daughter. And I want to trust her.",
        "Taylor: I think we raised a pretty stand-up kid.",
        "Ridge: I agree.",
        "Taylor: You know we knew that the day would come when we would just have to hope that we've instilled the right values in our children, and stand back and trust them to make the best choices as adults.",
        "Ridge: I love when you talk dirty like that. I really do.",
        "Taylor: Maybe that's why I do it. No, I'm proud of you. I am. You know, you're putting principles before impulses. So, if you think it's best that I don't go bother Phoebe, I won't.",
        "Ridge: Yeah -- but wait, wait, wait -- maybe what you could do is just very quietly and easily just test the door to see if they locked it?",
        "Taylor: You're backsliding.",
        "Ridge: Well, yeah. Can I ask you a question, though? Why does it look like you just got out of bed?",
        "Taylor: Well, I guess just about anything can happen in an office in broad daylight with the door locked. Do you mind if I just wait here for a little bit? Then maybe I can see if she wants to go to lunch?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Maybe you're underestimating Phoebe. She doesn't like her father telling what's acceptable to feel. She's that close to defying him already.",
        "Jackie: So is the wedding, that close. And if it's coming to a showdown anyway, isn't it better that it happens now?",
        "Donna: Probably.",
        "Jackie: And it's doubly urgent. I mean, if your sister does come to her senses, and she decides that she wants my son back, she'll very shortly find that door closed. He's going to be committed elsewhere.",
        "Donna: Taylor. All right!",
        "Jackie: All right. So, can we please stop trying to prove what well- intentioned people we are and get our hands a little dirty, if we have to? [Door opening] Oh, Nicky!",
        "Nick: Hello, girls. How are you? You look beautiful today.",
        "Jackie: Thank you.",
        "Nick: Why aren't we at work, mother?",
        "Jackie: Well, I cannot get anything done at the office, it's just so noisy. And then there was problems with the fall/winter collection, so I asked Donna to come --",
        "Nick: Well, I really don't want to hear about that. Have Clarke fix it. Also tell him that he's overpaid for what he does, will you?",
        "Donna: We already have.",
        "Nick: Well, tell him again.",
        "Donna: Aye aye, sir.",
        "Jackie: I'll talk to you later.",
        "Donna: Bye, Nick.",
        "Nick: Bye.",
        "Jackie: I better be going as well, you know --",
        "Nick: Not so fast. I've been hunting you down for a reason, Mom.",
        "Jackie: Oh, no, what have I done now?",
        "Nick: Well, you're the one with the extended vocabulary. Is there a word that's more polite, but means the same thing as \"sabotage\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: What's Eric's extension?",
        "Ridge: Oh, no, no, no. Don't do that. It'll light up in there that you're in the building and it will show her that you're checking up on her.",
        "Taylor: Okay, fine. Fine. I'll call her from my cell. I'll just tell her I'm outside, somewhere down the street -- look what you've got me doing!",
        "Ridge: Well, what happened to principles and letting her make her own choices, huh?",
        "Taylor: That's what I said, and that's I meant. They've been in there how long?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Nice chest.",
        "Rick: Thank you. You know, it's a little cold in here.",
        "Phoebe: Your hair is so sexy.",
        "Rick: You think so?",
        "Phoebe: Uh-huh. It's got to go. What did you think I was doing?",
        "Rick: Well, I don't know. You're taking my clothes off in here --",
        "Phoebe: Well, you're such a good boy. Why would I even be interested?",
        "Rick: I've got a secret for you. I'm not that good.",
        "Phoebe: Uh-huh. Maybe a little more clean-cut, you could pass.",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Phoebe: Really? Really, I can cut it?",
        "Rick: I trust you.",
        "Phoebe: Okay.",
        "Rick: Just do me favor with those scissors. Lose them when your father comes in. I don't need those plunged into my heart. So, should I trust you? Do you know what you're doing?",
        "Phoebe: I used to cut my brother's hair, until he made me stop.",
        "Rick: He made you stop? What -- never mind. The thing about hair is, I mean, it always grows back. I could shave my head.",
        "Phoebe: Over my dead body.",
        "Rick: Well, if your father comes in here, there will be two dead bodies in here.",
        "Phoebe: Why? It's just a haircut. Perfectly innocent.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, what you're doing to me right now is not perfectly innocent. You're standing so close.",
        "Phoebe: Maybe you should close your eyes.",
        "[Italian opera music plays]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: She's not answering.",
        "Taylor: Her cell phone's not on. This is really ridiculous. We don't have any reason to think anything is going on in there.",
        "Ridge: Rick and Phoebe -- no reason? I told you what I walked in on up at big bear. Are you forgetting what our hormones were like during that time?",
        "Taylor: Then I'll just walk in. It's an office. I can go in there. I came looking for her, and you told me where she was, and -- who needs a story? I'm not checking on, I'm taking her to lunch.",
        "Ridge: You go, you do that. I'm checking on her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Sabotage?",
        "Nick: Yes. You knew that I had an evening planned with Taylor.",
        "Jackie: Last night? I'm sorry, I didn't think. There was an opportunity for Hope to visit, and I thought that you'd want me to --",
        "Nick: That is just one of several things that you have done recently to make it very clear that you still want me with Brooke.",
        "Jackie: Excuse me? Is Taylor complaining about me?",
        "Nick: No, I am! This is serious between us, Mother. I want you to understand that.",
        "Jackie: What if Brooke were available again?",
        "[Nick sighs]",
        "Nick: She's not!",
        "Jackie: Humor me, will you, please? Just listen. What if their marriage were to self-destruct? And not in a couple of years, next week. Wouldn't that be of interest to you? Come on, be honest.",
        "Nick: Honestly? I would be thrilled. For Brooke, because she would finally be rid of this pompous ass and his twisted family. But it would make no difference to me personally.",
        "Jackie: Okay, I'm sorry. I don't believe you.",
        "Nick: You know, Mother, there's available, and then there's available. And the whole time that we were together, I was sharing her with him. Now, do you really think that I would put myself in that position again?",
        "Jackie: But what if it were final? What if it were finally, finally over?",
        "Nick: Well, I'll believe that when I see it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: The door isn't locked.",
        "[Music muffled by the door]",
        "Ridge: Is that music?",
        "Taylor: They can't be -- nothing is going on in there, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Well, whatever it is, it's not work. What the hell?"
