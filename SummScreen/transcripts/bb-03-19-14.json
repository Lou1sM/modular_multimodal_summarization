        "Brooke slowly lets herself into Eric's house, calling out his and Aly's name to see if they are there. She pours herself a drink and approaches Stephanie's portrait on the wall. She slurs her words. She tells Stephanie that she left too soon. Maybe she could have slapped some sense into her. Brooke admits that she was always scared of her with her beady eyes and her clenched jaw but Stephanie was always right. She wishes Stephanie had been around when she got involved with Bill. She would have stopped her some how. But she couldn't do it. She could not be the Forrester matriarch. She sighs that she is sorry that she let her down and disappointed her. Maybe Stephanie would have wanted Ridge with Katie because she is so good. But she knows that Stephanie cared for Brooke too at the end because she finally saw the good in her. She finally accepted her and now poof it is gone. Now Ridge and Katie are here and Stephanie is not here to help her fight. While drinking more, she cries how she misses Stephanie. Bill charges into Rick's office. Rick tells him that Caroline is not there if he is looking for him. Bill assures him that he is looking for Rick. Rick replies then he must be here for his investment. Bill scoffs \u0096 what for his peanut shares in this dress factory. Bill says they have something much more important to talk about, his mother and what he knows about that. Rick says he knows nothing so is it the same thing \u0096 Ridge is leaving her. Bingo says Bill and it's not what Rick might think that she has done something unforgivable. Ridge thinks he is in love with Katie. Rick tries to call, but the phone is off. He says he should have been there with her. Bill tells him to please stop by tomorrow and check up on Brooke. And bring his favorite hangover cure; she is gonna need it. Rick says she usually doesn't drink that much. Bill says but Ridge has never left her for her sister before. He says she was knocking back a few with no indication she was going to stop anytime soon. Rick assures him Ridge is not going to do this to his mother again. He wishes he had just stayed in Paris. Bill says yes instead of using her sister to guilt her. Ridge and Katie are both hypocrites. They have hurt Brooke. He knows Rick has been a good son over the years and tried his best but now he has Bill and they are going to make sure Brooke finally gives up on Ridge. He wants to be there for Brooke, but she keeps pushing him away. It scares him. Rick can't be sure that she will go back to Bill, but he knows he is 100% there for her which is more than Ridge.",
        "After making love and cuddling, Katie tells Ridge this is so crazy. She feels like he has been hiding in plain sight. He says he is not the same man then he was in Paris and that is a good thing. And he's learned a lot about himself. He admits he can not control the future and he can't live in the past. But the future can be fun if you have no expectations and just let things happen. And all he cares about right now is this moment with her and does not care what happens next. She wonders if they can not worry or look for expectations. He says they can try. She says she does not want this to end but what if it looks differently in the morning. She's not too good to living in the moment but maybe that is something she can learn. Brooke flashes back to when Stephanie was dying in her arms and telling her that she needs her to take this family forward .some place where it is filled with happiness and love. And she does not want her to waste one moment of her life whether that be with Ridge or not. They made a decision to do good for other people and she is expecting her to do that and be a better woman than Stephanie was. Brooke cries that she was not able to do that but Stephanie was right from the beginning. Brooke was the slut from the valley. She stumbles and falls on the stone floor below with the bottle and drink beside her."

        "Brooke: I need you. You left too soon. You could have helped. You would have just slapped some sense into me...literally. [Chuckles] You were pretty good at that, you know? I was always so scared of you when you were disappointed in me. Your eyes would get beady, your jaw clenched. But you know what? [Sighs] You were always right. [Shudders] [Sighs] God. I wish you were around when I was getting involved with Bill. You would have stopped me. Hey! Did you hear the news? Ridge, Katie. [Chuckles] I couldn't do it. I couldn't be the Forrester matriarch that you wanted me to be. [Sighs] I'm sorry. I failed you. I let you down. [Sighs] [Shudders] [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Telling you -- she's not gonna answer. Her phone's probably off.",
        "[Cell phone beeps, thuds]",
        "Rick: I should be there for her.",
        "Bill: Well, I should, too, but she said she wanted to be alone.",
        "Rick: So, what? I'm just supposed to, uh -- I don't know -- wait for her to reach out to me when she feels comfortable?",
        "Bill: No, no, no, no. Look, even if she doesn't call you back, I want you to stop by her house tomorrow and check on her.",

        "Rick: My mom doesn't usually drink that much.",
        "Bill: Well, she doesn't usually have Ridge leave her for her sister, either. She was knocking back a few, and I didn't get the impression she was gonna stop anytime soon.",
        "Rick: I can't believe them. I can't believe either one of them!",
        "Bill: Oh, it seems right in character to me. And, historically, this is how Ridge has treated your mom. You really thought it would be different this time?",
        "Rick: Yes. Foolishly, yes. I shouldn't have trusted him. I-I -- she shouldn't have trusted him, but for Katie to betray her sister like that...",
        "Bill: I heard about Katie collapsing at the wedding. You were all very concerned.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Bill: It was fake.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Bill: She wanted to stop the ceremony.",
        "Rick: You're telling me that she pretended to faint?",

        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: I mean, have you really been standing in front of me my whole life, and I've just never seen you?",
        "Ridge: We're not the same people that we were. I'm not the same guy that went to Paris, and that's a good thing.",
        "Katie: Why is it?",
        "Ridge: Well, 'cause before, I was kind of stuck. I learned a lot about myself.",
        "Katie: What did you learn?",
        "Ridge: Well, number one, turns out I can't control the future.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: And, number two, I can't live in the past.",
        "Katie: Sometimes, the past is hard to let go of.",
        "Ridge: But the future can be a lot of fun if you have no expectations and just let things happen.",
        "Katie: Is that what you're doing now -- letting things happen?",
        "Ridge: All I want right now is this moment with you. I really don't care what happens next.",
        "Katie: No expectations, huh? No worrying about the future? No mourning the past? No fears? No regrets? Can we do that?",

        "Brooke: [Slurring] Maybe you would have approved. [Sighs] Maybe you would have wanted Ridge with Katie. [Sighs] Well, she is so different from me. [Sighs] So...good. [Sighs] [Sighs] But you saw the good in me, didn't you? I know you did. Towards the end...you cared about me.",

        "[Back to present]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] You made me believe that I belonged. [Voice breaking] After all those years of fighting to be accepted in the Forrester family, and you did. You finally accepted me. And poof. It's all gone. And Ridge and Katie -- [Sighs] They're together, and you're not here to help me fight! [Sighs] I miss you. Oh, I miss you. [Sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Ridge just should have stayed away.",
        "Bill: Understatement of the year.",
        "Rick: [Scoffs] You know, uh, my mom -- she was finally starting to find her way after all the years of being pulled in and out of marriage. At least when he was in Paris, it was a lot easier. She didn't have to wonder who he was choosing that day or whether or not she was good enough. Why? What -- why -- why -- why? Why did he come here and do this again?",
        "Bill: And this time using her sister, after the guilt trip he put Brooke through? And Katie, as well. They're both hypocrites.",
        "Rick: You know, so many times, I tried to help her. Even as a young kid, you know, I-I knew you don't -- you don't treat a woman like that, and he cons everyone. He sucks them all back in.",
        "Bill: Listen, you know, obviously, it's bad right now. Your mother is -- is hurting. She feels betrayed by Ridge and Katie. But this will be the last time, because we're gonna see to it. We're gonna make your mother understand that she deserves better. Now, I know you've tried over the years. You've done the best you can. You're a good son. But now you have me, and I'm gonna help you, and, together, we're gonna make sure that Brooke gives up on Ridge... for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Soft guitar music plays] I believe it's times like these that we become who we're meant to be so hold me close there's a cold wind blowing but it don't mean nothing come on, now I want to see you shine come on, now I want to see you shine come on, now I want to see you shine",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: \"Give up Ridge\"? Yeah, well, so many times, I thought that my mom would. Something so bad would happen that she would finally see the way.",
        "Bill: I told her to let Ridge go. Let Ridge and Katie be together.",
        "Rick: Do you think that this is some sort of passing thing with Ridge and Katie?",
        "Bill: I don't know.",
        "Rick: Well, who knows what's going on in Ridge's mind?",
        "Bill: Always stuck in the middle, wanting what he just gave up. Not me. No divided feelings.",
        "Rick: I'm glad that you're there for her.",
        "Bill: I want to be, but she's pushing me away.",
        "Rick: Well, just give her some time. I don't know if my mom's ever gonna go back to you, but what I do know is that you have cared for her completely, and that is something that Ridge is incapable of. And, deep down, she knows that.",
        "Bill: I want to be there for Brooke. I've never seen her so low. The truth is, uh...it scares me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: This has been an amazing night. Mm.",
        "Ridge: Oh, it's not over yet. Yeah.",
        "Katie: I don't want it to end.",
        "Ridge: It doesn't have to.",
        "Katie: What if everything looks different when the sun comes up? This feels so good. I don't want to let it go.",
        "Ridge: Why don't we just think about this moment right now?",
        "Katie: I'm not very good at living in the moment. It doesn't come naturally.",
        "Ridge: Maybe I can help you with that.",
        "Katie: Well, I suppose it's something that I could learn.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "[Brooke remembering]",
        "Stephanie: I need you to take this family forward -- someplace where it's just filled with happiness and with love. I want you not to waste one moment of your life. I want you just to get on with life, whether it's with Ridge or it's not. You and I made a decision to do good for other people. I'm going to expect you to do that. I need you to be a better woman than I was. Can you do that? You can. I know you can. I love you, Honey.",
        "[Back to present]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I couldn't do it. I couldn't be the Forrester matriarch. But you were right. [Gasps]",
        "[Bottle thuds]",
        "Brooke: You were right from the beginning. [Laughing] I was the slut from the valley. [Laughing continues] I'm the s-slut... from the valley."
