        "Stephanie: My family's \r\nhaving a memorial service tonight. ",
        "Dr. Ramirez: You still \r\nhaven't told them? ",
        "Stephanie: No, and I -- I \r\ncan't. I -- I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know how I'm going to \r\nhandle this. I -- I -- I mean -- I'll have to stand there and watch them grieve \r\nand -- you know, thinking that their sister and their daughter is dead and all \r\nthe time, I know she's alive and she's on life support, I mean -- have I made a \r\nterrible mistake here? ",
        "Dr. Ramirez: I'm sorry. I \r\nknow how difficult this must be. And given the odds, I think what's happening at \r\nyour house today is appropriate. Let the people who loved Felecia grieve for \r\nher. ",
        "Stephanie: Is she going to \r\ndie? ",
        "Dr. Ramirez: I wish I \r\ncould be more encouraging -- but her vitals are even weaker than when we spoke \r\nbefore. ",
        "Stephanie: Did you look at \r\nthe dvd? ",
        "Dr. Ramirez: I've received \r\nit. I haven't had an opportunity to -- ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, Dr. Ramirez \r\n- please, please. Please look at it -- you and the staff. Please look at it so \r\nthat you get know her and see what -- I mean, she's just --- she's just this \r\nwonderful person who's so filled with this joie de vivre. I mean, I don't want \r\nher to just be another case. Another person laying in one of those beds. You \r\nknow, she's -- she's a mother and she's a daughter and she's a sister and -- I \r\ndon't know what we'll do if we lose her. Please look at the dvd. Don't give up \r\non her. ",
        "\r\n************************************************",
        "Kristen: I still can't \r\nbelieve she's gone. ",
        "Thorne: She's not. She'll \r\nalways be in our hearts and our memories. ",
        "Eric: I wasn't sure you'd \r\nbe up for this. I'm glad you're here. It's important for all of us. To say \r\ngood-bye to our daughter. Sister and friend. Stephanie? ",
        "Stephanie: I can't let go. \r\nI can't say good-bye. Not yet. ",
        "Eric: Thank you all for \r\nbeing here, today. As difficult as this is for all of us, it's a good thing that \r\nwe're together here. It means a great deal to Stephanie and me. And to Felicia, \r\nwho I am convinced is here in spirit. I know that she is in a better place and \r\nthat she is no longer in pain. My faith tells me that. But my heart wishes that \r\nI had one more day with her. One more hour, one minute, just to hold her in my \r\narms and tell her how much I love her. I found a poem. It spoke to me. It \r\nresonated with me. And I think I would like to share it with you. \"Death is \r\nnothing at all. I've only slipped away into the next room. I am I, and you are \r\nyou. Whatever we were to each other, that, we still are. Where no forced air of \r\nsolemnity or sorrow. Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we \r\nalways enjoyed together. Life means all that it ever meant and it's the same as \r\nit ever was. There is unbroken continuity. Why should I be out of mind because I \r\nam out of sight? I'm waiting for you for an interval somewhere very near, just \r\naround the corner. All is well.\" ",
        "Ridge: Growing up as the \r\noldest kid in this family, I always had to put up with my kid brother and \r\nsisters. Thorne and Kristen, I could handle, but Felicia -- I remember the time \r\nthat she convinced me to let her borrow my Porsche -- my new Porsche -- to go \r\naround the block. Well, she wound up in palm springs at a kick-ass party. That \r\nwas her way of saying it. I was going out of my mind, but she was having the \r\ntime of her life. Of course, that was nothing compared to when she convinced --\r\n",
        "Kristen: So instead of \r\nwearing this gorgeous designer gown that dad had designed for her for the prom, \r\nFelicia comes downstairs in this full leather getup, complete with a spiked dog \r\ncollar. You should have seen the looks on mom and dad's faces. But her date \r\nloved it. That was my sister. Beautiful, unpredictable Felicia. ",
        "Thorne: When she decided \r\nthat we should all become vegetarians. Remember that mom and dad? You paid each \r\nof us kids $10 a meal if we went along with it. And that lasted only about, \r\nwhat? Two days? Felicia said if she never ate anything leafy and green again, \r\nit'd still be too soon. ",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Thorne: Thanks, sis. For \r\nall the smiles. ",
        "Ridge: And all the laughs.\r\n",
        "Kristen: We will hold you \r\nin our hearts. ",
        "I pray you'll be my eyes \r\nand watch her where she goes and help her to be wise help me to let go \n",
        "every mother's prayer \r\nevery child knows ",
        "lead her to a place guide \r\nher with your grace to a place where she'll be safe Jason, from California.\r\n",
        "Bridget: Before Felicia \r\ncame back to L.A. This last time, I'd never really had a chance to spend a lot \r\nof time with her. No really deep conversations. That all changed and I'm so \r\nglad, so grateful. I'm so grateful about our long talks about life and death and \r\nlove and loss. I'm so grateful that she entrusted me with her little boy. And \r\nI'm grateful that she's with my daughter, Nicole, looking after her. The way \r\nthat Dante and I will be looking after her little boy, Dominick. The way that \r\nhis grandparents look after him and his aunts and uncles. That's exactly the way \r\nit should be. ",
        "Stephanie: I'm not sure \r\nthat it should be this way at all. It's not supposed to be this way. ",
        "Eric: Stephanie -- \n",
        "Stephanie: No. Felicia \r\nwants to live and we're her family. We're her parents. We have to do everything \r\nwe can to help her. ",
        "Eric: Stephanie -- \n",
        "Stephanie: What? \n",
        "Eric: We didn't want her \r\nto go through anymore pain, anymore suffering. Honey, I know how hard this is \r\nfor you. But you can't second guess yourself. It's too late. ",
        "Stephanie: It's not too \r\nlate. Oh, god, I hope it's not too late. I hope it's not. ",
        "Ridge: Just let her go. \r\nThere's nothing more we can say or do right now. ",
        "\r\n***********************************************",
        "[Phone ringing] \n",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Mrs. \r\nForrester? ",
        "Stephanie: Yes? \n",
        "Dr. Ramirez: It's your \r\ndaughter. I need you to come to the clinic right away. ",
        "\r\n*************************************************",
        "Waitress: Something to \r\ndrink, ma'am? ",
        "Ridge: So what do you say, \r\nLogan? I take you home, we fix a nice dinner? ",
        "Brooke: Ridge, I thought \r\nyou understood. ",
        "Ridge: Oh, I do. Probably \r\nbetter than you know. Makes me even more determined. I know you still love me, \r\nLogan. We're never truly going to be happy until we're together again, raising \r\nour family the way it's meant to be. ",
        "Nick: That's not what it \r\nlooks like. That's not where her future is. ",
        "Massimo: Her future is \r\nwith the father of her child. ",
        "Nick: Well, I guess you \r\nhaven't heard. ",
        "Ridge: Heard what? \n",
        "Nick: Bridget and I signed \r\ndivorce papers. I thought I'd be the one to let you know that. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************",
        "Stephanie: I hope I've \r\ndone the right thing, saving you. I don't want you to have any more pain. I know \r\nyou've had enough of that already. ",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Mrs. \r\nForrester? ",
        "Stephanie: She's dying?\r\n",
        "Dr. Ramirez: No, I wanted \r\nyou here because I'm seeing signs of a rebound. ",
        "Stephanie: What? \n",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Felicia's \r\nvital signs are stabilizing. Not that she's out of the woods, by any means, but \r\nthis is the first positive sign we've had since she's been here. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh my god.\r\n",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Now, she \r\nstill has to get through the chemo, then the liver transplant, but you were \r\nright. She is a fighter. I saw it in her eyes on the dvd. And now on the \r\nmonitors. If there's any way to pull her through this, any way, I'll do my \r\ndamndest. But she's got to keep fighting. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, she will. \r\nShe will. She's a fighter. She'll fight for that little baby boy. She'll fight \r\nfor everyone who loves her. Can you hear me? Don't give up. Don't you dare give \r\nup. She can hear me. You can hear me, can't ya? You are fighting, aren't ya? Oh, \r\nFelicia, hang in. You're going to show them all. My girl's going to show them \r\nall, aren't you? "
