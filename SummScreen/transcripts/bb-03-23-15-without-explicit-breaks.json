        "Maya tells Nicole that she is not having this conversation. Nicole says all she wants to know is the truth \u0096 does she have a big brother or a big sister. She saw a birth certificate that says Myron so Maya needs to tell the truth. Maya says seeing that birth certificate is impossible. Nicole says her mother had an old book that she only brought out once and after Maya left home Nicole found it and learned about Myron. She thought it was a baby that had died. Maya admits that she had her name changed. Deacon throws away all of Brooke's alcohol and she thanks him. She asks what does Quinn know about this. He says she thinks he is with a friend from AA and they will go again tonight. Deacon returns home and Quinn loves his text of ILU. Deacon says yes he loves her and she makes him happy. He hopes she thinks about him in that way too. Rick tells Katie that if he can not trust a person on every level then he'd rather be alone. He says he can not rely on Katie because she was with Ridge at the time and now he has Maya who he can turn to and admit everything. Nicole calls Maya a freak. Maya says her parents called her that too. She had to leave and go to California as they had things she needed and even then not until she was 21. She could not come home although she wanted to. Katie asks how does Rick's relationship shape up with Maya. Do they want children like he and Caroline did. Maya tells her sister that she can't just put on an outfit and make herself be that. Every girl has some work and procedures done to make her more attractive. She was told lots of little boys play with dolls but they were only making excuses for her. At a certain point she stopped panicking and feeling like a freak. She is her older sister and that is who she will always be.",
        "Deacon tells Quinn that he really thinks he helped his friend and he now needs to back that up by not grabbing for a beer and alcohol himself. She tells him she is going down to the shop and close up and will be right back. Deacon calls Brooke. She says she is taking the bottles out to the garage and he helped a lot and now he is checking up on her. She hopes he has a good day. Rick says yes when the time is right they will want kids. Maya had a daughter that died and she never got over that. Maya tells Nicole that she never told a lie to Rick, not one. She dated another in the beginning. She admits she had a medical problem that needed corrected and for the first time she loves herself and that had to happen before someone else could love her. She wants to be there for Nicole if she will let her."

        "Nicole: Say something.",
        "Maya: I'm not having this conversation.",
        "Nicole: What? I'm not important enough? The least you could do is tell me the truth. Are you my big brother or my big sister?",
        "Maya: Whatever you think you know, Nicole --",
        "Nicole: M-Y-R-O-N. That is what I know. You were named after Grandpa Avant.",
        "Maya: You never had an older brother.",
        "Nicole: I saw the birth certificate. I held it in my hand.",
        "Maya: That's impossible.",
        "Katie: I think a little reality check might be in order here. I mean, before you try to force-feed me this \"Maya and I are all about honesty\" pill. Didn't she break up with you at one point and she never even told you why?",
        "Rick: Yes. Because your husband was blackmailing her.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] That is beside the point.",
        "Rick: [Chuckling] Yeah.",
        "Katie: I'm just worried about this pedestal you're setting her on. I mean, she's human. She's gonna disappoint you. And then what? More bullet holes in the wall?",
        "Rick: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: Oh. Gosh. Just seems so wasteful.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] Brooke, I'm gonna remind you of a little something. You're filthy, dirty rich. I think it'll be okay. Besides, if you don't stay up all night getting wasted, then it's not really a waste, is it?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, I could call the local liquor store. They will always deliver.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, but you'd have to be drunk to do that.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Did I say thank you?",
        "Deacon: My memory's a little spotty.",
        "Brooke: I know I've been awful to you through the years. I don't even know why you're here for me right now. But...thank you.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Brooke: Where does Quinn think you are?",
        "Deacon: She thinks I'm with a friend. It's called AA, and you need to go to a meeting tonight, if not sooner.",
        "Brooke: Oh, and don't worry. I'm not gonna be calling you every five minutes.",
        "Deacon: It's funny, you know, it used to always be my fantasy to be the guy who rescued you from everything. Not the guy that you had to be rescued from.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: I feel sorry for you and my mom -- most people that we know. 'Cause if you want to settle and call it being realistic... you know, that's fine by me. But if I can't trust somebody one every level, I'd rather just be alone.",
        "Nicole: I don't remember you living with us.",
        "Maya: I moved out when you were young. You knew that.",
        "Nicole: I don't know if you ever saw it. But mama had this book. \"So your kid wants to know about\" -- you know, some title like that. And when I was asked on my first date, she brought it into the kitchen. And... she showed me some pictures of girls who get venereal disease. And I didn't understand what she was talking about. I didn't know how you could get it going to a high school dance. When they left the house, I looked for it and... I finally found it. Up high in the garage, tucked away in one of mama's old bags. And hidden in the bag... was a hospital bracelet. And a baby picture. And a birth certificate... for Myron Avant.",
        "Maya: It wasn't mine.",
        "Nicole: \"Male\" is what it said. At first, I thought they had a baby that died.",
        "Maya: It wasn't mine.",
        "Nicole: What's your date of birth, then, Maya?",
        "Maya: It -- it wasn't mine. Because I had it changed.",
        "Quinn: You're home!",
        "Deacon: I am home.",
        "Quinn: Yay! So, were you a hero?",
        "Deacon: Little bit.",
        "Quinn: Yeah?",
        "Deacon: What are you working on?",
        "Quinn: I am putting some felt around these so it doesn't scratch your sensitive skin.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] Well, my wrists thank you.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Hey, um...was there a, uh, typo in the text you sent me?",
        "Deacon: No.",
        "Quinn: Well, I mean, I thought I was up on all the crazy internet slang these kids are using these days, but \"ily\"? Does that -- does that mean \"I'm leaving you\"?",
        "Deacon: I love you.",
        "Quinn: You're helping some guy stay sober and that's what you're thinking about?",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: Maybe this visit was a bad idea. I mean, really my only intention was to tell you that Brooke and I are friends again. So we should be closer, too. You don't have to tell yourself that Maya is the only one you can count on.",
        "Rick: I love you, aunt Katie. I do. Maybe you think I should have spilled my guts while my mother was away. But here's the thing. You're married to a guy who wants a portion of my company, who thinks that I'm some sort of undisciplined head case. So how can I rely on you? Because if the choice ever came down to between me or bill, you would choose bill every time. And I have a woman now that I can tell everything to, so you'll have to forgive me if she's the one I prefer to turn to.",
        "Nicole: I knew it.",
        "Maya: You want money? Isn't that what this is all about?",
        "Nicole: First you lie to me, then you insult me?",
        "Maya: [Sighs] Nothing wrong with looking out for yourself. It was always the key to my success. Although blackmailing people isn't the most pleasant way to get there.",
        "Nicole: What else was I supposed to do to get you to admit that you're a freak?",
        "Maya: Our father used that word, too.",
        "Nicole: Our whole lives were a lie because of you.",
        "Maya: What's the first thing you remember about me?",
        "Nicole: One of the Missouri cousins was getting married. I was...7? When I went to give auntie Caroline a kiss, she said to me in my ear, \"tell your sister I said hello.\"",
        "Maya: She did? I always wondered if she knew.",
        "Nicole: So I asked about it on the way home. It got so quiet, I knew it was true. And dad said, \"yes, you have a sister that ran away from home. But we don't talk about her to spare mama's feelings.\" She didn't say anything. And that was it. Until a lady showed up at my school.",
        "Maya: Your ninth birthday.",
        "Nicole: You gave me a little velvet horse. And took me out for ice cream.",
        "Maya: I was so alone. And I wanted to know you. I know you won't believe it now, but... I wanted you to let me love you because I knew how hard it was to feel love in that house.",
        "Nicole: Then why didn't you come back?",
        "Maya: Because, Nicole, it felt impossible.",
        "Nicole: Nobody made a scene when you walked me home.",
        "Maya: Not till you went upstairs.",
        "Nicole: You could have come back!",
        "Maya: I did. Until I had to go.",
        "Nicole: I was lonely, too.",
        "Maya: I'm sorry. You could have taken me with you.",
        "Maya: No, sweetie, I couldn't. I had to come here to California. There were things here that I needed that I couldn't get in other places then, things that I couldn't even ask for until I was 21.",
        "Nicole: You didn't look then like you do now.",
        "Deacon: Yes, I think about you, I think about loving you. It makes me happy.",
        "Quinn: That's sweet.",
        "Deacon: You don't think about me? I mean, obsessively. You know, in that way that you do about everything?",
        "Quinn: Sure. Yes, I think, um... \"why is he not here and how long is it going to take him to get back here to me?\"",
        "Deacon: Okay, well, I guess that's a start. That's a little like love.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] So, how did it go? I'm not asking for specifics or names or anything. I respect the anonymity rule, but were you able to help?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I think I did.",
        "Quinn: So he's not gonna drink?",
        "Deacon: Who? No, no, not tonight.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: So where do you see this relationship with Maya going? I mean, you and Caroline always talked about having children.",
        "Rick: Well, that's definitely not gonna happen with Ridge. I mean... he's already raised a couple families.",
        "Katie: So the children you talked about having with Caroline -- are you gonna have them with Maya?",
        "Nicole: Did you always have that voice?",
        "Maya: It's been a few years.",
        "Nicole: Did you always talk like a girl?",
        "Maya: How do girls talk?",
        "Nicole: You weren't born with those.",
        "Maya: No woman is.",
        "Nicole: Even your face is different. I saw it right away. Your cheeks, your eyes -- what did you do to yourself?",
        "Maya: I grew into my body. The same way that you did.",
        "Nicole: I've read about the operations and...procedures. What did you have done? How many?",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: Why couldn't you just wear the clothes?",
        "Maya: Because being myself isn't an outfit that I can put and take off.",
        "Nicole: But if you didn't look right in the dress, didn't that tell you something? Namely that you were a boy?",
        "Maya: Never. I never was.",
        "Nicole: I mean the way nature made you.",
        "Maya: This is the way I was born. Every third woman in this town has a little bit of work done. New chin, a new nose, new breasts. Who knows what kind of private alterations? Would you go up to her on the street and ask how many? Is she not a woman because some rebuilding has been involved?",
        "Nicole: It's not the same thing, and you know it.",
        "Maya: I knew I worried dad from a young age. Other people didn't catch on until I was...about the age you were when I picked you up from school. But I always knew.",
        "Nicole: You couldn't. Kids don't think like that.",
        "Maya: I knew I wasn't supposed to say anything. Nobody had to tell me that. I hated haircuts and Sundays. Little boys had a freedom that little girls don't have, and I never complained about that. But come Sunday... I knew that I was supposed to be wearing dresses like the other little girls at church. Our mother said I would grow out of it. That lots of little boys play with dolls, she said.",
        "Nicole: She said those were her dolls.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] She was always trying to protect me. Make excuses for me. Mothers will do that. Maybe it was how much I got sent home from school or how much I got beat up that made her panic. But at a certain point, I stopped panicking. And I realized I'm not a freak. I know this is a shock for you. But the reason that you have only known me as your older sister is because that's who I am. It's who I've always been.",
        "Deacon: It was a little weird, to tell the truth.",
        "Quinn: Was he crazy and desperate? I mean, you should be used to that with me.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] You know, Quinn, I haven't been to A.A. Meetings in years. You know, I -- you probably didn't notice, but the minute I walked through the door, the first thing that was on my mind was just instinctively grabbing a beer out of the fridge. And this person is really new, and when you're new, you have to have a sponsor. That's somebody who's been clean and sober for awhile, and that's just not me anymore. But I really think I helped them. I mean, I do, and the thing about it is -- it made me feel stronger, you know? More committed to my sobriety.",
        "Quinn: Question. Are you gonna be all inspirational now? Do I have to maybe start reading a self-help book or two?",
        "Deacon: Please don't do anything rash.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Okay. I'm gonna go down and close up the shop. You... put these with the other toys.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] I think I remember where these go.",
        "[Ringing]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Brooke: It's you.",
        "Deacon: How's it going?",
        "Brooke: Oh, uh, good. I was just taking the bottles out to the garage to recycling. How are you?",
        "Deacon: I'm good if you are.",
        "Brooke: You helped. A lot.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Well, I'm not a very helpful person by nature.",
        "Brooke: And yet here you are, calling to check up on me.",
        "Deacon: Take care, okay, Brooke?",
        "Brooke: Have a good day.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: Yeah, I know Maya wants kids. She had a daughter that she lost. She never got over that. So, yeah, when the time is right... you know, I think she's more in that nesting phase and less focused on her career.",
        "Katie: So you would actually marry her?",
        "Rick: Why? I mean, can you think of one good reason not to?",
        "Nicole: I don't understand how Rick could not know. If you love him like you say, how could you have lied to him all this time?",
        "Maya: I never told him a lie. Not one. Unlike you.",
        "Nicole: Is that how you convince yourself that this is right? That -- that it's honest?",
        "Maya: I broke up with Rick when we first met because I thought -- well, I thought he would react like you did. So I dated someone else.",
        "Nicole: A man?",
        "Maya: Yes. A man. But I was in love with Rick. And I decided to find out if he would really reject me instead of rejecting myself in advance.",
        "Nicole: But you still don't know that. How could Rick not find out? You talk about marriage, you need a birth certificate for that.",
        "Maya: I told you I had it changed. It's one of the reasons I needed to come to California. I still had to go before a judge in Illinois, but it's done now.",
        "Nicole: They let you do that?",
        "Maya: Let me? You have no idea the barriers that they put up. The affidavits, the evaluations, the doctor signatures. Look, the bottom line is... I had a medical problem that I needed corrected, so that my outside would match my inside. And for the first time, I felt like me. For the first time, I loved myself, and isn't that the point of living? I had to love myself before I could let someone else love me, and I am sorry that that took a toll on us. But I can be there for you now. If you let me."
