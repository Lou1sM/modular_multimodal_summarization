        "With Eric in San Francisco, Rick lets himself into the house to pick up some sketches and finds Brooke sprawled out on the couch. With a bottle nearby, it is clear that she has been drinking big time. He manages to revive her and to ascertain that she took a cab over. She doesn't remember much after that except she had been drinking and then must have fell asleep. Hope giggles when Wyatt wakes her up with a kiss. Despite the sunlight out, he tries to convince her it is night and they do not have to go into the office. Then he tries to convince her to spread out a bit and open her own lingerie line. It takes some talking but he finally gets her to say yes and he's already got a launch meeting set up. And he's just glad that the office puritan has quit. It will make this go so much easier. Aly is in her room cutting out hundreds of paper dolls of Hope for collages for the wall. Thorne surprises her when he knocks on the door and comes in. She had not realized he was coming from Paris. Then she realizes that Eric called him and they are worried about her. He admits Eric called him and said Aly had sort of lost it yesterday. She says she was taking a stand. He says she needs to ease up and trust that Rick and Eric know what they are doing. She is upset when she mentions her mom and he thinks she is imagining things. She says her mom talks to her a lot and she said she knows right from wrong and she needs to put an end to what is happening at FC. Thorne asks exactly what does her mom want her to do. Aly replies to get rid of the filth \u0096 Wyatt and his mother and what they bring to FC and their family. She argues with her dad that it is her job to protect Hope. Thorne says he knows Aly thinks her mother was a saint and that's the way he remembers her too, a very good person. But he doesn't think she would be opposed to Wyatt and Hope's relationship. Aly sneers that he must not have known her mother that well after all. But she always listens to her advice. She will not allow Thorne to say the word Taylor. But she goes on again about how good Darla was and wants her to be by Hope's side to keep her out of trouble. Thorne clinches his lips when she says that is exactly what she intends to do. Eric returns from his trip and stops by the Boutique to see Quinn and assures her that he missed her and she is doing well with the Stephanie jewelry collection. He'll see her at the meeting tonight.",
        "Rick tells Brooke that Bill told him about Ridge and Katie. He can not believe Ridge promised this time would be different and now it is with her sister. Wyatt talks to Oliver on the phone and thanks him for setting up a photo shoot. Aly walks in and he's surprised to see her since she just quit yesterday. She says she is a Forrester and belongs here, he doesn't. And she can quit every day if she wants too and still show up for work. She says Fuller \u0096 full of something that stinks. She says he may have conned her grandpa and Rick but she is still watching him and she will be at this meeting tonight. Wyatt says that is not a good idea. She won't like it. He knows she wants to be protective of Hope but something she might think is a disgrace might be good for the company; that should be up to Eric and Rick, not her. He tells her she should turn around and leave. She says she is staying. To herself, she utters that she is Hope's shadow and she will protect her. Brooke tells Rick to please not talk about Ridge like that. They have been at odds for so long ..she doesn't think she can handle any more of it. She blame herself and what she did to her own sister when she was ill with PPD. She just lived up to her reputation so that was no surprise. Rick tells her to stop beating up on herself. She looks at Stephanie's portrait again and says she is sorry. She was supposed to be the Forrester matriarch, but she just couldn't do it."

        "Thorne: I came in though the back hoping to get some coffee.",
        "Aly: Granddad usually makes it, but he spent the night away on business.",

        "Eric: I wanted to see how the installation's going.",

        "Aly: Well, that's not what Mom thinks.",
        "Thorne: Honey, I know you like to imagine that --",
        "Aly: I am not imagining.",
        "Thorne: Aly, your mother's not here anymore.",
        "Aly: Maybe not with you. But she talks to me a lot. And you know what she said last night? She said that I know right from wrong and that I need to put an end to what's happening at Forrester Creations.",

        "Hope: [Laughs] Yeah, yeah. Whatever.",
        "Wyatt: What? I still think you should capitalize on this.",
        "Hope: Oh, no. Oh, no, not this again.",
        "Wyatt: What? I'm ser-- you're already in the public eye. Let's get you out here looking like this in the magazines and the billboards. [Gasps]",
        "Hope: In my lingerie?",
        "Wyatt: Hey, there are some things that are just good business sense, Baby. I'm telling you.",

        "Rick: What are you doing here? I didn't see your car.",
        "Brooke: [Groans] I... oh, I took a cab. I-I don't know what -- [Sighs] I must have fallen asleep. I was drinking.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I can see that. And I know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Honey... what is it your mom wants you to do exactly?",
        "Aly: Get rid of the filth.",
        "Thorne: [Sighs] Aly, I don't understand.",
        "Aly: Wyatt and what he brings into the company, to our family. Mom wants me to protect Hope.",
        "Thorne: That's not your job.",
        "Aly: Yes, it is.",
        "Thorne: Honey...",
        "Aly: Do you remember when you gave me this?",
        "Thorne: Yes. Of course I do.",
        "Aly: It's gold.",
        "Thorne: Yes, it is. It's a heart. Let me show you something, too. Mommy will always be in your heart. And mine, too, Sweetheart.",
        "Aly: I always listen to Mom when she gives advice. I mean, she's in heaven. She knows what she's talking about.",
        "Thorne: I'm sure she does, Honey. And I know you like to think of her as a saint. And that's how I remember her, too. She was a good person, Aly. And I don't think your mother would be opposed to Wyatt and Hope's relationship.",
        "Aly: Well, then, I guess you didn't know her very well, did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Okay, look, I'm not brining this up because you look damn good in lingerie. But you really, really do, by the way. Um, but, no. I just -- I did a little research.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Okay? Brooke's bedroom was huge. It was the biggest moneymaker for Forrester. If you took that over --",
        "Hope: But we've talked about this, and I am so flattered. I am. But I think I would just feel so... so weird having my body on display like that.",
        "Wyatt: Why?",
        "Hope: Because I'm not my mom.",
        "Wyatt: Ugh.",
        "Hope: I'm not. And besides, you know, I don't even know if we have time for a lingerie line. In case you didn't notice, we have a lot going on. I mean, we just started the Stephanie Forrester jewelry collection.",
        "Wyatt: I know. Which will be great. Which will be great. That would draw people in. But if you took over the bedroom line, I mean, jaws will drop, all right?",
        "Hope: Thank you. [Laughs] I mean, I -- I could consider it. I could.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: But there is a reason that I started Hope for the Future. Growing up with my mom, it was... she was just so blatant with her sexuality. It was embarrassing.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Hope: It was. I'd go to school and all the other kids knew what my mom looked like half naked. You know, Hope for the Future gave a different message. And I'm not sure how it would reflect on me if I started modeling lingerie.",
        "Wyatt: It would show that you're an adult with many different sides to you. There are a lot of women who would love to wear Hope for the Future during the day and Hope's bedroom at night. I mean, imagine the sales that we'd get. Just like when your mom first started the line.",
        "Hope: Oh, the heyday of Forrester. My mother modeling and Ridge designing.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. And I just so happen to fancy myself a young Ridge.",
        "Hope: Ah. Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Not really?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] And you are the quintessential young Brooke. I mean, I-I don't know how you could say no to this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Here you go.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Rick: How much did you drink?",
        "Brooke: I don't know.",
        "Rick: Well, Caroline and I are just across the way. You don't... you don't ever have to drink alone.",
        "Brooke: You said you knew.",
        "Rick: About Ridge and Katie? Yeah.",
        "Brooke: She believed in me. She trusted me to lead her family.",
        "Rick: You're doing a fantastic job.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've been doing a great job. Look at what I did to Katie. So, who told you?",
        "Rick: Bill. He's worried about you, Mom. He came to see me. I left you a message. I swung by the house, but the lights were out. I assumed that you were asleep, and I didn't have any idea that you would be here.",
        "Brooke: I'm glad that you're the one that found me. And not Eric or Aly.",
        "Rick: They would have understood.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I don't.",
        "Rick: Ridge and Katie got together because of some sort of payback.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Part of me wonders that... deep down. But I-I just can't imagine them consciously wanting to hurt me. There has to be some kind of explanation.",
        "Rick: No, there's no explanation. He promised that he wasn't gonna do this again.",
        "Brooke: I know. [Sighs] I know.",
        "Rick: Mom, after all these years, watching you believe his lies and getting hung up every single time. And now this? That's your sister. He promised, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Well, I better get to the office. You're coming to the meeting, right?",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I'll be there.",
        "Eric: Do you know what Wyatt has on the agenda?",
        "Quinn: Um...no, I'm not sure, but probably something positive for Hope, I imagine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Mom has always steered me in the right direction.",
        "Thorne: But do you remember what your doctor said...about believing that it's okay that your mother is looking --",
        "Aly: Even on the day you gave me this locket... you were supposed to marry her. But she steered me right that day, too.",
        "Thorne: Honey, Taylor was --",
        "Aly: Don't say her name. I don't want to talk about her.",
        "Thorne: Okay. Okay.",
        "Aly: I don't think Mom was a saint. She was. Selfless to the end. She had the same kind of values that Hope used to talk about. And that is why Mom has put me on this mission. She and I are full of so much love for the Forrester family. And she wants me by Hope's side, to keep her out of trouble. And that is exactly what I intend to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You are not the same girl you were when you started Hope for the Future. You've -- you've grown. You've matured. And your clientele has grown with you.",
        "Hope: Well, I am more comfortable with my sexuality now. That's for sure.",
        "Wyatt: Mm. And I am happy to benefit from that.",
        "Hope: Hey, now.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, now.",
        "Hope: Actually, honestly, it is a lot because of you.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, yeah?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Hope: Yeah, you opened me up to a new relationship, a new kind of intimacy, a new outlook. I think that you've even enabled me to see my mother in a new light.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Hope: I mean, a part of me will always remember what it was like growing up with her, but that is something that I will never be able to explain to you. Only Bridget and Rick will understand that, but... I do see her from a more mature viewpoint. Yeah, that sensuous side of things that I was always so... intimidated by, I'm...really not anymore.",
        "Wyatt: Are you saying that you understand why she'd wear lingerie for the world?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: And maybe you see the benefit in doing it, too?",
        "Hope: Maybe.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: I think... I mean, I know I could do it. I could.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah!",
        "Hope: And I would do it. I would. And I kind of want to.",
        "Wyatt: Yes! Yes! This is -- I'm telling you, this is gonna be epic.",
        "Hope: I feel like I've been trying to run away from my sexuality for so long, always trying to separate myself from my mother. But...this is business. It is. And I'm a woman, and I have nothing to hide. And I'm certainly not ashamed of myself.",
        "Wyatt: Good. I am so glad you said that because this meeting today, um...",
        "Hope: Yeah?",
        "Wyatt: I sort of, kind of, have an agenda.",
        "Hope: [Gasps] Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: It was a launch idea. It was a launch --",
        "Hope: A launch idea for me?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hope: Ooh, and you didn't even get my permission? You're the worst.",
        "Wyatt: I just -- I just --",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: I just knew you'd say yes.",
        "Hope: It is such a good thing that you know me so well.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] And it is a good thing that the office puritan quit.",
        "Hope: Who?",
        "Wyatt: Your shadow.",
        "Hope: Oh, God. Aly. Oh, poor Aly.",
        "Wyatt: You know what? I'm -- I'm not sad she left. I'm sorry. It'll make putting you front and center in the lingerie campaign that much easier. She would have gotten upset and made everyone else upset, and it just wouldn't have been good.",
        "Hope: I know.",
        "Wyatt: It just -- it'll make this a whole lot smoother of a transition.",
        "Hope: You're right. What do you say? Should we think about going into the office?",
        "Wyatt: No. It's the middle of the night.",
        "Hope: Oh, you're so right. I don't know what I was thinking. God, I must be crazy.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no. This is great. Look, if we get approval, then we'll do an actual photo shoot with Hope in lingerie. This -- this will get the point across, though. And thank you for getting it to me so quickly, Oliver. I owe you one. Okay. Sounds good. Thanks. Bye.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Aly: What's all that?",
        "Wyatt: Hey...Aly. Uh, this is just something I'm working on. What brings you by?",
        "Aly: I work here.",
        "Wyatt: Uh...no. You quit.",
        "Aly: You believed that? Sometimes I say things I don't mean. I'm a Forrester, Wyatt. I belong here. I can quit every day if I want to and still show up for work tomorrow.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Aly: Same can't be said for you. Because you're a Fuller. Full of something, and it stinks.",
        "Wyatt: I have a meeting to set up for, so --",
        "Aly: Oh, the one you called for? Good. Great. Set up. I'm here for it, too.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] You are not gonna want to stick around for this.",
        "Aly: Why not?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, I mean --",
        "Aly: Trying to get away with something else, are we?",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Aly: You may have conned my grandpa and Rick, but I am still watching you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I've noticed.",
        "Aly: You do one more thing to disgrace Hope or this family, and you're gone.",
        "Wyatt: Aly, look, I know you want to protect Hope, but something that you think is a disgrace might actually be really good for this company. And the decision is up to Eric and Rick, not you. I suggest that you don't stick around for this meeting.",
        "Aly: Sorry, but I am.",
        "Wyatt: You won't like what you see. You should turn around and leave. All right. You've been warned.",
        "Aly: I'm Hope's shadow. And I will protect her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Don't do anything, Rick. To Ridge, I mean. You two have been at odds for so long. I don't want to see something happen. I don't think I could handle that.",
        "Rick: He treats you like garbage.",
        "Brooke: And why shouldn't he? Look at how I treated my sister.",
        "Rick: Don't do that.",
        "Brooke: She was married. She was going through postpartum depression, and what did I do? I just stepped right in there, and I lived up to my reputation. Is that really any surprise?",
        "Rick: Stop. Look, I don't like to -- I don't like to see you beat yourself up like this.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie wanted me to be the Forrester matriarch. I just [Sighs] I couldn't do it. I'm sorry."
