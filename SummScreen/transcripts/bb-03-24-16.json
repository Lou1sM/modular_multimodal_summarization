    "Recap": [
        "Ridge tells Caroline that Patty is a professional nanny; she will be fine alone with Douglas. They need a date night to be alone and have some adult conversation. Maya and Rick look through Ridge's desk drawer at work looking for something incriminating. Thomas catches them riffling through the desk. Rick admits it; they are trying to find something to prove that his dad can not be trusted to run the company. Vivienne feels badly and tells Nicole that was supposed to be her girl and now Sasha goes after Zende. Nicole says yes, she stabbed her in the back, her very best friend. Julius says what is done is done so it's time for Nicole to move on. Nicole cannot believe he is taking Sasha's side over hers. Sasha shows up at Zende's room and asks if he told Nicole about them. Before he can answer, she kisses him and says she really did not come here to talk. Ridge and Caroline have a good dinner and she says she is still pinching herself that she has such a handsome husband and the sweetest, cutest baby. He swears he is going to be a very good dad. A guy keeps staring at Ridge. Ridge admits to Caroline that he knows he has seen him somewhere, he just can not remember where. Rick has Charlie check out the Forrester security footage of the parking lot a few weeks back when someone put a dent in his car. Charlie says okay but it will take a while. Sasha comes on stronger until Zende finally pulls away and says his mind is on other things now. Not to be dismissed she starts to strip and kisses him again. They end up in bed. When he asks about her parents, she stops shy of telling him about Julius. Zende says here they are in bed and they are talking about her father; not very romantic. She says no, it is okay. They should be able to tell each other everything. Then he admits he told Nicole they made love. She had pretty much figured it out herself. Sasha says it is okay as it was love for her. She hopes that is how he felt. Rick tells Maya that he is not backing down despite what Thomas said. He is going to find a way to bring Ridge down. When Caroline can't wait a second longer to get back home to her baby, she leaves while Ridge is going to pay the bill. The man walks over and introduces himself as Dr. Wolin, the doctor who refused to reverse Ridge's vasectomy. He does congratulate him on the birth of his son ..but then adds it was more than a miracle. It was impossible with zero sperm. He knows his secret; he is not the father of that baby."

        "Rick: He stole the office from me. He took it right out of my hands.",
        "Maya: Okay. What exactly are we looking for?",
        "Rick: I don't know. Something. Any kind of clue. Could be improper suppliers or -- or falsified documents, maybe plagiarized designs -- something to expose him for the fraud that he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivienne: Sasha? She was supposed to be your girl.",
        "Nicole: Not anymore.",

        "Vivienne: [Sighs]",

        "Caroline: I don't know if I'm ready to leave him alone yet, though!",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] You've been devoted to this little kid ever since you gave birth to him. It's time to have some time for us, have some adult conversation. You could talk to me.",

        "Vivienne: Well, I expected more from both of them.",
        "Nicole: Me, too. [Sighs] She stabbed me in the back. My best friend. Like sisters. She comes here... moves in on my boyfriend, and takes him away.",

        "Zende: Is it okay if we don't talk about it right now?",

        "Thomas: Still haven't answered my question. What are you guys doing?",
        "Rick: Well, what does it look like I'm doing, Thomas? Trying to prove your old man can't be trusted.",
        "Thomas: Ah. Still upset about this whole CEO thing.",
        "Maya: You know what? Rick fought hard to become CEO. He was thriving. He did a fabulous job until Ridge took it away.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'm sorry, man. I know he's your father, but he's always trying to pull one over on me, take my job from me, kick me out of the house, manipulating, cheating, lying. And you know what else? I don't trust him one bit.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Here's to us. Cheers, to a beautiful boy and to getting you out of the house.",
        "Caroline: Getting me out of sweatpants.",
        "Ridge: Mm. I am proud of you. I know that wasn't easy, leaving him for the first time. Are you okay?",
        "Caroline: Uh, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm going a little crazy 'cause I just miss his little baby cheeks and his perfect little baby head.",
        "Ridge: He's a perfect boy, isn't he? And he's all ours.",
        "Caroline: I finally have the family I always wanted. I have this... mm, handsome husband...",
        "Ridge: You're welcome.",

        "Ridge: I don't know. He looks familiar, but I can't place him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: It's a pretty big ding. It's on the passenger side. The more I started thinking about it, I realized it must have happened here in the parking lot.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. You say I-it happened weeks ago? Y-you know, it's gonna take me a little while to find the, uh, culprit.",
        "Rick: Well, I certainly appreciate you going through your footage. It'd be nice to know who ran into my car.",
        "Charlie: [Chuckling] Yeah.",

        "Nicole: Once again, you were right, about everything. Happy?",
        "Julius: Of course not. Look, Nicole. When you decided to be Maya's surrogate, you knew this was a possibility. I mean, you had Zende, a great guy, but you just asked too much of him!",
        "Nicole: I know that, Dad. And I feel bad enough. Thank you.",
        "Vivienne: Julius, do not lecture her to make her feel worse. Please. This is a time that we have to stand with our daughter.",
        "Julius: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what you're going through. But I'm -- I'm gonna have to stay out of this. This is gonna have to be between you and Sasha.",

        "Zende: It's just... it's been a crazy day, you know? My mind's all over the place.",
        "Sasha: Well, you shouldn't be thinking right now. You're supposed to be feeling. Hey. How's that feel? And that?",
        "Zende: Not bad.",

        "Maya: I think it's sweet they named him Douglas after Stephanie.",
        "Thomas: And he is ridiculously cute. Dad and Caroline are super-excited. I-I mean, we all are.",
        "Maya: Babies have a wonderful way of bringing people together.",
        "Thomas: Look. My dad and I have had our differences in the past. It's over. It's done. I support him in everything that he does - how he leads our family and how he runs this company. I'm fully aware of your guys' rivalry. I'm sure it bothers you to no extent that everything seems to be going his way. There's nothing you can do about it. My dad isn't hiding anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Everything's falling into place, exactly the way it should be.",

        "Ridge: Mm-mm.",
        "Caroline: I feel like I can finally breathe again.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. You can. Things are great. I'm running the family business. We're living in the family home. We're happy, we're healthy. We have a beautiful baby boy. I-I wouldn't change anything about my life.",
        "Caroline: You really mean that?",
        "Ridge: I do. Nothing can stop us now.",
        "Caroline: I'm actually beginning to think that you're right.",
        "Waiter: Excuse me. Can- can I get you anything else?",
        "Caroline: Mm. No, thank you so much.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Caroline: (Clears throat) That guy still gawking at you?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: Maybe he's a fan. Ooh, or maybe he's just, like, checking you out 'cause you're really fine.",
        "Ridge: I know that guy from somewhere. I just...can't remember where.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivienne: At least he was honest with you, sweetheart. I'll give him that.",
        "Nicole: (Sighs) It hurts too much. I almost wish I didn't know.",
        "Vivienne: I know, sweetheart. But we're gonna get you through this.",
        "Julian: Yes.",
        "Vivienne: I know it's not easy.",
        "Nicole: Another woman - some random chick. I could understand that. But someone who's practically family, like Sasha? I don't understand how they could do this to me. Th-that's just a boundary you don't cross.",
        "Julian: Baby, you are young. You're beautiful. You're talented. And once you have this baby, you'll meet another young man. You'll forget all about Zende.",
        "Nicole: How can you say that?",
        "Julian: What's done is done. You've got to learn to move on.",
        "Nicole: You're siding with Sasha...",
        "Vivienne: Uh--",
        "Nicole: Over me, your own daughter? You're supposed to support me, Dad, not some girl you don't even like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: Are you glad I came over?",
        "Zende: What do you think?",
        "Sasha: I think this was exactly what you needed.",
        "Zende: So you think you're getting to know me now?",
        "Sasha: [Chuckles] I think I want to know everything about you.",
        "Zende: Is that right?",
        "Sasha: Mm-hmm.",
        "Zende: Like what?",
        "Sasha: I don't know...like, are you a morning person or a night person?",
        "Zende: Um...well, I like to get up early so I can get my day started.",
        "Sasha: Okay, so you can hit the gym with Carter and work on those six-packs. You know, you two have quite the bromance happening.",
        "Zende: Yeah, that's my boy.",
        "Sasha: You know, you gettin' all shirtless and sweaty with someone else for hours on end...Don't know how I feel about that. I might get a little jealous.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles] Where do you get your sense of humor?",
        "Sasha: [Laughs]",
        "Zende: Your parents? Your mom?",
        "Sasha: No, my mother...she was-- she was real strict. I guess she had to be.",
        "Zende: What about your dad?",
        "Sasha: No, nobody really knows my father.",
        "Zende: Is he alive?",
        "Sasha: Yep. Yeah, he's alive.",
        "Zende: Not to bring up Nicole and her family again, but... [Sighs] Her dad can be a piece of work.",
        "Sasha: [Sighs softly] This just feels so good. You're so kind to me, and you laugh at my jokes, and you think I'm smart, and sexy. When you hold me in your arms, it just...just feels so good to be held.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: Here we are in bed, and I'm bringing up your dad.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Zende: That is not romantic. I'm sorry.",
        "Sasha: No, no, it's okay. I'm an open book. And you know, that's the kind of relationship I want us to have -- the kind where we can share everything with each other.",
        "Zende: Being honest is always best.",
        "Sasha: You know, since you brought up Nicole earlier...um, I didn't really get to ask you, but...What exactly did you say to her? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I know it's none of my business, but I figured I'd ask.",
        "Zende: I told her everything.",
        "Sasha: Everything?",
        "Zende: Yeah. I told her you and I made love.",
        "Sasha: Wa-wait, say that again?",
        "Zende: Nicole knows that you and I made love.",
        "Sasha: [Sighs]",
        "Zende: Uh... Sasha, I'm sorry. I, uh..she kind of figured it out by herself...",
        "Sasha: That-That's not why I'm upset. You said that we made love. That's how it was for me. Is that how you felt?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Rick and his precious roadster. Bet the damn thing is leased. [Chuckles]",
        "[Keyboard clacking]",
        "Charlie: [Sighs] Huh? Wait a minute.",
        "[Keyboard clacking]",
        "Charlie: What the heck? What?",
        "[Keyboard clacking]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I meant what I said to Thomas. I'm not backing down.",
        "Maya: Ridge and Thomas seem to be getting along better. Maybe with the new baby, Ridge is finally softening a bit.",
        "Rick: No. Ridge is not the white knight that everybody makes him out to be. He's only out for himself. Now it seems he has everything he's ever wanted. He's got the perfect life, the perfect family. But I'm gonna find a way to bring him down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I'm really glad we did this. It was lovely and...I enjoyed every minute of it.",
        "Ridge: But now you want to go home and be with our son.",
        "Caroline: I'm dying. I'm-I'm physically aching for him. He's just so ridiculously delicious.",
        "Ridge: Then you should go home. I'll take care of this, and I'll see you there.",
        "Caroline: Thank you for this.",
        "Ridge: Always.",
        "Caroline: Mm. I love you.",
        "Ridge: I love you.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Mr. Forrester. I thought that was you. I didn't want to interrupt you and your wife. It's Dr. Wolin.",
        "(Flashback)",
        "Ridge: Doc.",
        "Dr. Wolin: I have your results. I'm really sorry, Ridge.",
        "(Back to present)",
        "Dr. Wolin: I grew a beard. You probably didn't recognize me. May I sit?",
        "Ridge: Sure. Sure, sit down. [Sighs] How may I help you?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Well, I heard the news. You and Mrs. Forrester had a child.",
        "Ridge: Yes, a son.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Exciting. Congratulations.",
        "Ridge: Thank you. Miracles of medicine, you know?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Quite miraculous, yeah. [Chuckles] Especially considering your condition, azoospermia, and the fact that I refused to reverse your vasectomy.",
        "Ridge: Right, well, I went to different doctors.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Ah. Who'd you see?",
        "Ridge: That's...not really relevant, is it?",
        "Dr. Wolin: You're right. It's not relevant...because I ran those tests again and again. Your sperm count was zero, Mr. Forrester. Zero. I know your secret. There's no way that baby's yours. It's impossible."
