        "Wyatt is still conducting the meeting while everyone gives their views about a possible launch of After Dark. Aly is the loudest and tells Hope that sex sells and that is exactly what she would be doing \u0096 selling sex. Hope Logan fought so hard for her message for young girls like Aly to be responsible and wait. And now Hope is going to be modeling lingerie. She can't imagine what has happened to Hope. Pam and Liam are outside the door trying their best to hear a peep from inside. Liam says Aly is the voice of reason and she has never lost control around him. Pam says that is because she adores Liam, but hates Wyatt. Liam agrees that is another reason for him to like her. Wyatt is pushing Hope too far this time and maybe it is a good thing, maybe she will see the light as she has too much integrity for that. Aly wants to talk to Hope alone but Eric tries to say they are all in a meeting together. Hope speaks up and says it is okay. She will give her a couple of minutes. When Wyatt walks out he catches Liam and Pam talking. She excuses herself. Wyatt asks why Liam is there. He scoffs he is there to watch Wyatt's demise. He says Wyatt doesn't have a clue who Hope is. She is not going to be a lingerie model. Wyatt thinks Liam doesn't believe in Hope, but she's on board with this. Liam says if they do this, Hope will hate herself and Wyatt even more. Wyatt says that is why Hope is with him now. He encourages her and Liam only holds her back. Liam admits that Wyatt does feed her a large dose of charm but eventually she is going to gag. Wyatt says Liam doesn't know Hope at all. She is not that sweet high school girl that he knew. She grew up right after she left him. Hope tells Aly she gets a couple of minutes but please do not use them to slam Wyatt or it will be less. Aly basically goes over all the things she has said before. She asks Hope to think when she launched her line why she called it Hope For The Future. She had a vision and it caught on and changed the world. Hope says yes but she grew up and her values have not changed, but they have matured. Aly points out what a crusader Hope was and how she taught her generation to respect themselves and what will happen if they don't. She says Hope's whole life is a lesson and they need that. Hope says she is no angel. Aly says they don't want an angel. They simply want someone who will slip and fall, but picks herself back up and corrects them. Hope taught them to invest in themselves and not just give it away. She tells Hope she has to live her message and not cheapen herself or it will cheapen the message. She tells Hope to take back her world and respect herself. She can not do that parading around in her underwear. Hope says Aly has given her a lot to think about. She has been listening but the decision is hers, not Aly's.",
        "Back in the meeting room, Eric tells Hope it is her call if she has made a decision. Hope starts by saying she agrees with Wyatt she thinks this will sell but she also has heard what Aly said and it comes down to she needs to do what is right for her. And right now following in the footsteps of her mother isn't what she wants to do. It might change she says looking at Wyatt, but right now she is saying no. Of course both Quinn and Wyatt are very disappointed. Quinn tells him that Aly has got to be stopped. Wyatt is surprised that Aly got to Hope that way. Quinn says Aly wants Quinn gone and she wants Wyatt gone too but they can not let that happen. Aly walks in with a smug look on her face and says but it is happening. She tells Quinn that she does not know who she is messing with but finally the voice of reason prevails. She says she hates being angry but they make her crazy. Wyatt whispers a good choice of words. Aly tells him that she hates him, but that's okay because they took her advice .or rather her mother's advise. Quinn rolls her eyes when she hears Aly say that and that Darla was the most respected woman in the family. She steps up to Quinn and calls her a wicked, evil, conniving witch. She knows they exist. She even lurches forward more and smells Quinn up and down. She says they both reek of evil but she will not let them poison Hope. Hope asks Liam what he is doing here. She mentions Steffy and he says ah yes the lightening rod that kept them from marrying. But he's not in touch with her. If he wanted to be with Steffy he'd be with Steffy. He says he knows she is still skeptical but his point of view has not changed. He still loves Hope the same as he always did. But he knows she is trying to make it with Wyatt and there is nothing he can do about that. He knows she had nothing to do with this lingerie line but hopes she is okay with that. She agrees that she got overly excited about it until Aly brought up some points she had not thought of. Quinn cracks the door to hear the rest. Liam says Hope has a code and it defines her. He was lucky enough to be there for some of that but it never changed who she really was. And he can't imagine anyone else wanting to change that either. He says today showed him something .the woman he loved is still the woman he loves ..and he is so damn proud of her. He quickly gives her a kiss. She stands there frozen and allows the kiss but does not return it. It's awkward for both at the end and they say nothing."

        "Eric: All right, Wyatt. You've made your feelings very clear. But Aly has a valid point. She'll be staying in the room, everyone.",
        "Aly: Thank you, Grandpa. Hope, look, you don't have to do this just because he wants you to.",
        "Wyatt: You act like I'm trying to shanghai her. Hope, did I force this on you?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Quinn: Of course not. Wyatt is merely trying to expand the line.",
        "Wyatt: We're filling a gap that could very profitable for us.",
        "Aly: By selling underwear, lingerie? It's beneath you, Hope.",
        "Caroline: HFTF has evolved. I mean, why not a lingerie collection?",
        "Wyatt: And this will sell. Do you have any doubt about that?",
        "Rick: I don't.",
        "Aly: Because sex sells. And that is exactly what you would be doing. Hope Logan, the woman who fought so hard to convince girls like me to wait, to be responsible, sophisticated. And now you're gonna be modeling lingerie? My God, Hope, what has happened to you? It's your line...",
        "Pam: They're starting up again.",
        "Liam: Oh, nap time's over, huh? Maybe Wyatt shut up.",
        "Pam: Aly's not gonna let anybody doze off -- that's for sure.",
        "Liam: Aly -- the voice of reason.",
        "Pam: That's not the way some of us would describe it.",
        "Liam: See, I don't -- I don't get that. She's never lost control around me.",
        "Pam: Well, that's because she adores you, Liam. It's Wyatt she hates.",
        "Liam: Another reason to like her.",
        "Pam: She hasn't exactly done your cause any good.",
        "Liam: My cause is what's best for Hope. Modeling lingerie is not what's best for Hope. Wyatt is pushing her too far this time, and maybe that's a good thing, you know? Maybe she'll see the light.",
        "Pam: Or the spotlight, you know, if she agrees to go through with it.",
        "Liam: No, she -- she has too much integrity for that.",
        "Wyatt: This is not an indictment on Hope's integrity.",
        "Rick: Honestly, it doesn't mean that somebody might not see it that way, though.",
        "Aly: People like me. There are millions of us.",
        "Quinn: That is rubbish.",
        "Eric: Maya, how are you feeling about this?",
        "Maya: I don't have a problem with it. If Hope is comfortable with the concept, I'm behind it.",
        "Aly: I want to talk to Hope alone.",
        "Eric: Aly, we're in the middle of a meeting here.",
        "Hope: It's okay. Really, it -- it's fine. Just give us a couple minutes.",
        "Carter: Aly belongs in law school. The kid can argue.",
        "Rick: You're telling me. She's relentless.",
        "Quinn: Unreasonable.",
        "Maya: She does have a point. I remember being very moved by those early HFTF ads.",
        "Eric: You know, Hope for the Future was, uh, not just a clothing line. It was an inspiration to a generation.",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm. It was a brand with a message.",
        "Eric: So to change that whole thing requires very serious consideration.",
        "Rick: It's not that it can't be done. It's like Dad said. We have to tread lightly.",
        "Wyatt: But Aly's got an ax to grind, and it has nothing to do with the line. It has to do with me.",
        "Pam: Pretty tough when your only ally is a mouthy teenager.",
        "Liam: That's the thing, Pam. I don't need an ally. Hope's never gonna buy into this.",
        "Pam: Well, Wyatt must have gotten her approval before they went in there.",
        "Liam: Well, maybe. Wyatt's a smoothie.",
        "Pam: [Scoffs] Uh. You know, I think somebody needs me in shipping.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Hey, Buddy.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Liam: Hope and Aly made a quick exit.",
        "Wyatt: What are you doing here?",
        "Liam: I'm here to witness your demise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Okay. A couple minutes, Aly -- that's all you get. And please, please don't spend this time slamming Wyatt, because then you're only going to get less.",
        "Aly: Look, I am really sorry for before.",
        "Hope: Thank you. I'm sorry, too.",
        "Aly: I just want you to think about something.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Aly: Your line -- the reason you called it Hope for the Future.",
        "Hope: I was -- I was young, Aly.",
        "Aly: But you had a vision, and it caught on. It changed the world, Hope.",
        "Hope: As do a lot of young people with a vision, but the thing is people grow up.",
        "Aly: So your ideals have changed.",
        "Hope: No. I've not said that they've changed. I'm saying that they've matured, just like I have and just like you will.",
        "Aly: So if you do this, will you change the name of your line?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Aly: Well, I am seeing a billboard with a huge HFTF banner and, right below it, a picture of you half naked. \"Hope for the Future.\" What are you suggesting we hope for? A hot night in bed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: What could they possibly be discussing?",
        "Eric: I'm sure Aly is making her case.",
        "Quinn: Oh, she's already done that, Eric. I don't understand. Why are we letting a teenager derail such an excellent proposal?",
        "Rick: That teenager happens to be a Forrester.",
        "Maya: This company needs someone like Aly. Yes, she is abrasive, but she plays a role.",
        "Caroline: The guardian for what we stand for.",
        "Carter: So, the bottom line -- Hope has to be onboard.",
        "Rick: Carter's right. She's always on point, but we have to make sure that she's gonna be comfortable with this.",
        "Quinn: Why wouldn't she be? She's beautiful, charming, handles the press. She's camera perfect.",
        "Eric: She's also a young woman of principles. She needs to be resolved about any doubts that she might have.",
        "Quinn: Well, Aly will help her do that, won't she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Lingerie model, huh? You're a piece of work.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. You don't believe in her.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] You don't have a clue, do you?",
        "Wyatt: About...?",
        "Liam: Who Hope is, what she stands for.",
        "Wyatt: She's onboard, mon fr\u00e8re.",
        "Liam: Yeah? Tough sell? Did you buy her another diamond?",
        "Wyatt: Nope. She's down.",
        "Liam: You're gonna bring her down if she agrees to this, and you know something, Wyatt? You're gonna make her hate herself... and you even more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I don't think you realize the impact you've had on my generation.",
        "Hope: It wasn't always positive.",
        "Aly: So you slipped a few times. Even that was a lesson.",
        "Hope: Yeah, yeah. That I'm human, just like everybody else.",
        "Aly: And it taught us something.",
        "Hope: What did it teach you?",
        "Aly: That it isn't always easy being true to yourself, your principles. That's it hard work, even for someone like you.",
        "Hope: Sometimes I look back on that and I wonder if I wasn't on some kind of ego trip.",
        "Aly: No. You showed us what it means to respect yourself and what can happen when you don't. Don't you see? Your whole life is a lesson, and we need that, Hope. Aren't there enough bad examples out there? Movie stars and athletes that turn to drugs and sex -- those were our role models... until you came along.",
        "Hope: I'm not angel, Aly.",
        "Aly: We don't want an angel, Hope. We want someone who fights and slips and falls like us and picks herself back up, admits her mistakes, and corrects them. We want a crusader, Hope. And that's what you are.",
        "Hope: I'm also responsible for a line of clothing that this company depends on.",
        "Aly: And why do you think that line is so successful? Why do we want to look like you, dress like you, be like you? Because we know that what you stand for is right. It may not be popular, it may not be cool, but if we want to be a success in this world, if we want to be loved and respected, we can't just give it away. You taught us to invest in ourselves. That is what Hope for the Future is all about.",
        "Hope: And that hasn't changed. I still feel that way.",
        "Aly: But it has to be more than just a feeling. You have to live it, Hope. If you cheapen yourself, then you cheapen your message, and what are we left with? What are the young, impressionable women left with if their crusader starts parading around in her underwear? What are we to think? That seduction is good? They listen to your words, Hope. Take back the world. Respect yourself. They need to hear that. I needed to hear that. And like it or not, they are watching you, listening, taking your cue. Just ask yourself -- what advice are you giving them if you start modeling lingerie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: You two behaving yourselves?",
        "Wyatt: Liam here thinks that poor Hope has been misled.",
        "Pam: You know, I wouldn't worry too much about that one. She's gonna do what she does regardless of you two.",
        "Wyatt: Which is exactly why she's with me -- because I believe in her. I encourage her to do bigger and better. You just hold her back.",
        "Liam: Well, you do spoon-feed her large doses of charm. She seems to like that, but eventually, she's gonna gag.",
        "Wyatt: How ironic. You think that you know her so well, but you really don't. That sweet, little high-school girl is all grown up. And it happened right after she left you.",
        "Liam: See, and I bet you think it's 'cause she needed the right man.",
        "Wyatt: I'm glad you -- you recognize that.",
        "Liam: Do you understand that the more I'm around you, the more confident I get? I love your arrogance, Wyatt, 'cause it means you're setting yourself up.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, for the big fall where she dumps me and she comes crawling back to you? Let me get this straight. Is that -- is that before or after we make a bunch of money on this lingerie line?",
        "Liam: Wow, you really think this is gonna happen. I love this. I love this.",
        "Wyatt: Its happening, Brother.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Fine. Fine. How do you think Aly is handling this whole thing?",
        "Wyatt: Aly? Aly is out of control, and Hope is reining her in right now.",
        "Liam: You sure it's not the other way around?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Think about those things that you used to say in the beginning. Check the message boards, the blogs. That message is still playing loud and clear. You might want to pretend that it isn't, that you're all done with that. Well, you aren't. This could hurt you, Hope. It could destroy your line, and I just -- I really don't want to see that happen.",
        "Hope: Hmm. Well, you've certainly given me a lot to think about.",
        "Aly: Please, please don't do this, Hope. Don't change who you are.",
        "Hope: Okay. Okay. Okay. You've made your point. You have. I-I-I'm listening. But the decision is mine, not yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Okay, okay, okay, Guys. Look. This is how it's gonna be. I want no more talk about Aly. She is a Forrester. You are not. I want you to treat her with respect.",
        "Wyatt: Pam, she's certifiable.",
        "Pam: See, that is not what I want to hear, and that is definitely not what I want Aly to hear.",
        "Wyatt: Well, maybe she needs to hear it.",
        "Pam: No, no, no. Trust me. That is not what she needs.",
        "Wyatt: Why not, Pam? Hmm?",
        "Pam: Wyatt --",
        "Rick: Good. You're back. Let's wrap this up. I've got another meeting I have to get to.",
        "Eric: Hope, it's your call. Have you made a decision?",
        "Hope: Yes, I have. Okay. Um... I agree with Wyatt. I think that with the popularity of this line, there is no doubt that a lingerie addition will sell. But I also understand where Aly's coming from. We have a responsibility to the customer base that built this line, and that is a youth market. So what do we do? Can we have it all? Can we market responsibly and increase sales? Maybe. I think maybe we could have it all. You know, we could target the younger demographic with responsible marketing and the adult women with a lingerie campaign. Bui think what it comes down to is this... it's my name. It's my face on the line. My values, my reputation, everything that I stand for -- that's all part of Hope for the Future. And ultimately, I have to do what's right for me. And launching a bedroom line, following in the footsteps of my mother... isn't. And that may change. It might. We'll see. But I think that, right now, we shouldn't do it.",
        "Quinn: Oh, that girl has got to be stopped.",
        "Wyatt: Aly got to her.",
        "Quinn: A brilliant idea derailed because they're listening to a stupid teenager?!",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but it's more than that, Mom.",
        "Quinn: What?! What more? Aly is unstable.",
        "Wyatt: And yet they tiptoe around it. Why? At least some of them do. But Eric and -- and Pam...",
        "Quinn: She wants you gone. She wants me gone, and we cannot let that happen.",
        "Aly: Oh, but its happening, isn't it? Finally, the voice of reason prevails.",
        "Quinn: More like the voice of insanity.",
        "Aly: You do not know who you're messing with, Lady.",
        "Quinn: Don't push me, Kid.",
        "Aly: Oh, I will push and shove you right out the door -- you and your hotshot son. I don't like getting angry, but you two make me crazy.",
        "Wyatt: That's kind of the perfect choice for words.",
        "Aly: I hate you! But that's okay, because they took my advice -- well, my mother's advice.",
        "Quinn: Y-your mother?",
        "Aly: Yeah, that's right. Darla Forrester, the most respected woman in the family.",
        "Quinn: Oh.",
        "Aly: That's what Stephanie called her.",
        "Quinn: Well, if, uh, she's anything like you, then I'm glad I don't know her.",
        "Aly: You are a witch -- a wicked, conniving witch. They exist, you know? Oh, I can smell it. [Sniffs] Evil. You reek of it. And so do you. But I will not let you poison Hope. I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: What are you doing here?",
        "Liam: I don't know. It's weird. Something keeps drawing me back here. I wish I knew what.",
        "Hope: [Laughs] Uh, I trust that I will not read anything about what happened in this office.",
        "Liam: Well, I will say you were on fire.",
        "Hope: Oh, I just said what had to be said.",
        "Liam: Yeah, if only you'd do what had to be done. I'm kidding. I know what you're thinking, by the way. \"Why doesn't Liam get a life?\"",
        "Hope: God, Liam, yeah. Why don't you get a life?",
        "Liam: I guess I could move to Paris, you know, ride a motorcycle, take skydiving lessons.",
        "Hope: Yeah, well, she's there.",
        "Liam: Ah, yes. The lightning rod that kept you from marrying me.",
        "Hope: How is Steffy?",
        "Liam: Couldn't tell you.",
        "Hope: Oh, come on. You guys must text every now and then.",
        "Liam: Hope, if I wanted to be with Steffy, I'd be with Steffy.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: I know I earned your skepticism, but, you know, from my point of view, nothing's changed. I love you just as much as I did when we said our vows in Italy.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: You weren't soliciting that information, I know that. And you're trying to make things work with Wyatt, and if that's who you want, I can't do anything about that. My only question is...is it? 'Cause what he's bringing to your life -- what happened in here for example -- are you good with that? Because you didn't ask to be put in that position. He put you there.",
        "Hope: No, but I agreed to do it.",
        "Liam: But it must have been against your better judgment. Otherwise, you wouldn't have changed your mind.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Honestly, I-I think that I just got overexcited about the idea. I didn't really think things through, and Aly brought up some points that I-I really hadn't thought of.",
        "Liam: You've always known what you wanted. You've always taken a stand, and nobody could sway you because those values are you. You have a code, you know? And you've refined that code over time. I was -- I was lucky enough to be a part of that, but it never changed who you are. It never changed this amazing person that you grew up to be, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why anybody would want to change that. I guess Wyatt does. Maybe you see that, maybe you don't, 'cause you're wrapped up in...whatever. But...I hope today showed you something. It showed me something. It showed me that the woman I love... is still the woman I love. And I'm so damn proud of you.",
