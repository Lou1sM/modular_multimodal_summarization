        "With Stephanie onlooking, the doctors unhook the monitors and ventilator from Felicia. It's touch and go for a few moments, but she finally responds by breathing on her own. Bridget is elated when Dante shows her papers making her a legal guardian for Dominick. Felicia is not out of the woods yet and Stephanie abruptly leaves her side to bring on a miracle worker.",
        "Brooke and Nick continue to get hot and heavy before he knows he has to put on the brakes. How is he going to stand this for six months? Later Taylor drops by and puts in her two cents. She likes her new drinking buddy and doesn't want to see him burnt by Brooke. It will always be Brooke and Ridge and thinks Nick may be just a temporary band-aid. She doesn't want him to be another one of Brooke's statistics. Stephanie insists to Bridget and Dante that she needs to borrow Dominick for the night. She takes him straight away to Felicia's room. His mere presence is a miracle and seems to revive Felicia and they are all jubilant. Keep fighting, yes!"

        "[Crickets chirping]",
        "Bridget: I'm just so overwhelmed. To have me named his legal guardian--",
        "Dante: Yes, with me. She was blessed to know that she had someone like you to take care of Dominick when she was gone.",
        "Bridget: Well, what about you? I'm sure you had some say this, too.",
        "Dante: You know how I feel about you.",
        "[Dominick cries]",
        "Bridget: [Chuckles] Sounds like we need one more person's approval.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Ramirez: She's arresting. Give me another .5 Atrapene.",
        "Stephanie: What the hell is happening here?",
        "Dr. Harwood: Mrs. Forrester, let the doctor do his job.",
        "Stephanie: Well, maybe we should put her back on the life support. Ah, I don't want her to die.",
        "Dr. Harwood: Mrs. Forrester, please. The doctor knows what to do. Now, you've gotta remain calm or you'll have to wait outside.",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Come on, Felecia . Come on, Felecia , you can do this.",
        "[Buzz]",
        "Dr. Harwood: Heart rate is steady.",
        "Stephanie: So she's breathing on her own?",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: Thank God.",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Harwood, let's get her on the donation list.",
        "Dr. Harwood: Her vitals don't justify--",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Just do it.",
        "Dr. Harwood: All right, I'll get the paperwork ready. Nurse?",
        "Stephanie: Is she gonna make it?",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Mrs. Forrester, we're doing all we can, but at this point Felecia needs to help us. She needs to decide to stay with us. We can just hope.",
        "Stephanie: She needs something more than hope. And I know what it is. I'm gonna get it for her.",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Mrs. Forrester. Where are you going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Oh, Nick, we have to stop.",
        "Nick: I'm trying, believe me, I'm trying.",
        "Brooke: No, we promised. I promised Bridget.",
        "Nick: Okay. Okay -- all right, all right. Let's -- let's try to make a few ground rules here, shall we? Okay? Uh. Let's see, uh, I don't know what to say. Like this should be okay, huh? I mean, that--that's all right, isn't it?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Nick: And, uh, maybe. You know, like thi-this area right in here's, maybe that's legal, uh?",
        "Brooke: Oh, yeah, that-- that should be okay.",
        "Nick: Good. Good. Maybe right here -- this corner -- that corner right there should be -- okay. No tongue.",
        "Brooke: As long as it's innocent --",
        "Nick: Believe me, innocent is not what I'm thinking.",
        "Brooke: Oh, me neither.",
        "Nick: Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa. Back to high school here, huh? Go to the malt shop, and then to the drive-in, and then go home and chew my arm off. I might as well move to Tibet, and stay with the monks and practice celibacy.",
        "Brooke: Oh no, no. Don't do that.",
        "Nick: Oh. Oh. Maybe I ought to just paint my boat, huh? That'd take a good six months.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, yeah. That's a good idea.",
        "Nick: Varnish the floors, inside and out.",
        "Brooke: Or, you could erect the mast.",
        "Nick: That is so not fair.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Why don't you just promise to love me, and to take care of me, okay?",
        "Nick: For six whole months?",
        "Brooke: That, you're going to have to do forever.",
        "Brooke: Ow. Thank you.",
        "Nick: Mm-hmm. I truly believe I would be better at undressing you than dressing you.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yes. I believe that, too.",
        "Nick: Well, maybe we can try that in six months.",
        "[Brooke chuckles]",
        "Brooke: That would be great. Can't wait.",
        "Nick: On a serious note, I want you to let me know if something comes up with Fforrester.",
        "Brooke: Hmm --",
        "Nick: I mean it. I want him to leave you alone.",
        "Brooke: You're my future now. This family that we had here today, along with R.J. -- It's my life. And I couldn't be happier. You better go. Love you.",
        "Nick: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Bridget: Oh, Dominick, you're gonna have to go to sleep, honey.",
        "Dante: You were meant to be a mother.",
        "Bridget: Oh, I think all women were meant to be mothers, but I don't know that I was. [Rattle shaking] This little thing isn't listening to a word I'm saying.",
        "Dante: That's not true, he's been sleeping all day.",
        "Bridget: What? Well, that explains it.",
        "Dante: What'd I do wrong? Listen, when he's tired, he sleeps, and when he's not tired, he's awake.",
        "[Dominick fussing]",
        "Bridget: Well, I think it's a little more than that -- it's called a schedule.",
        "Dante: Look, I think I can teach you something about babies, too.",
        "Bridget: Oh, really? Can you?",
        "Dante: You want him to go to sleep? I got an easy solution.",
        "Bridget: Oh, this I can't wait to hear.",
        "Dante: See, he's just like his father -- loves cars. I'll take him for a drive, it'll knock him right out.",
        "Bridget: Huh? Well, lead the way.",
        "[Dominick fussing]",
        "Dante: Hey, I'm good for something.",
        "[Bridget gasps]",
        "Bridget: Stephanie, gosh, you scared me.",
        "Stephanie: I'm so sorry. I was hoping to take the baby.",
        "Bridget: What? Take him -- what do you mean?",
        "Stephanie: I was thinking that maybe he could spend the night with me. He's my only hope, Bridget.",

        "Taylor: You're in a good mood.",
        "Nick: Oh, hi there. Hope and Brooke came over for dinner so --",
        "Taylor: Yeah, I came by a little bit earlier -- I saw you guys and I left. So, how'd that go?",
        "Nick: Good. I think Hope had a good time.",
        "Taylor: I'm sure she's crazy about you.",
        "Nick: Well, we did get along pretty well. I guess that's what fatherhood's all about. I'm sure we both agree she deserves to have a good father.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, just as Brooke deserves a good husband.",
        "Nick: She does?",
        "Taylor: Well, I wish you all the luck in the world. I really do. You know, I've never really met anyone quite like you. You deserve to be happy.",
        "Nick: Thanks. Not really sure where you're going with this, though.",
        "Taylor: Well, you seem convinced that Brooke is going to make you happy and -- I think that's wonderful, I really do. It's just -- I just don't want you to get hurt when she lets you down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Stephanie, I know that you're going through a lot, we all are but do you really need to take him right now? I'm trying to get him to sleep --",
        "Stephanie: I know this probably seems a little crazy, I mean, I realize it's late but this is important to me, I need him tonight. [Bridget sighs] Just put it down to the fact that I'm going through a lot because of Felecia and I'd like to be with her baby. I have the car seat all set up.",
        "[Dominick fussing]",
        "Bridget: It's not a matter of safety, I know that he'd be safe -- of course he would. It's just -- you know, it's really late. Look at him. Maybe we can set up a time for the two of you guys --",
        "Stephanie: Sometimes, you know, you need to be around family. And this is one of those nights. I'll have him back in the morning, I promise you. [Dominick fussing] Bridget, I need this.",
        "Dante: Look, maybe it's not such a bad idea that he spend some time with his grandma. It might be good for all of us. Look, he's gonna be with us for the rest of our lives. It's just one night.",
        "[Dominick crying]",
        "Bridget: Look, he -- he's gonna need a bottle and a change of clothes and some diapers --",
        "Stephanie: I'll take care of everything.",
        "Dante: Here. Just bring him back in the morning.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you, Dante. Thank you very much.",
        "[Dominick fussing]",
        "Bridget: Go see Grandma, it's okay.",
        "Stephanie: Come on, it's all right. I know, I know, you're tired and you want to go to sleep. I know that.",
        "Bridget: Wait -- wait, please. I didn't say goodnight to him. My sweet angel. [Dominick fussing] This little boy is a miracle worker. You know that, don't you?",
        "Stephanie: That's what I'm hoping for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Why would you say something like that?",
        "Taylor: I just don't want to see a good man like you get burnt.",
        "Nick: Well, I really don't think you know what you're talking about.",
        "Taylor: Well, I'm aware how intoxicating Brooke can be. I mean, how many men have been exactly where you are. Thorne, Eric, Ggrant, James, the list goes on. They're all good men. But as mesmerizing as Brooke can be, I'm just -- I guess I'm just asking you to step back and think -- I mean, really think. I don't think there's really been one man who's been able to walk away from Brooke unscathed.",
        "Nick: They're different.",
        "Taylor: I don't know about that. But I do know Brooke and I probably know her better than she knows herself. Now, I don't really know how to say this, I guess I just -- I have to come right out and say it to you. I think you might be a bandage for Brooke. It's always been Brooke and Ridge. I'm afraid that's the way it's always going to be. I mean, I've had to accept that. Look, I'm not saying this to you for any other reason than -- that I admire you and I respect you. And really, what kind of friend would I be if I didn't just come right out and speak up and tell you what I think. Okay, you can listen or you don't have to. You don't have to take it, just telling you. But -- I've just seen how Brooke has used men in the past and I don't want you to be another statistic.",

        "Dr. Ramirez: Mrs. Forrester, where did you go?",
        "Stephanie: Look, I had something to do. Is Felecia all right? Has there been any development, anything happening?",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Mrs. Forrester, you really should be here right now.",
        "Stephanie: I'm on my way. And I'm bringing something I thinks going to help.",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Mrs. Forrester, I really don't know how much time that --",
        "Stephanie: Dr. Ramirez -- tell my daughter that her mother is coming and tell her that I'm bringing her baby boy. Tell her to hold on.",

        "Nick: I was actually having a pretty good night.",
        "Taylor: I'm sorry I just -- I just want you to be prepared, that's all. You know, I've known Brooke a lot longer than you have, Nick. Do you the entire history with her and Ridge?",
        "Nick: Taylor, I'm sorry things haven't worked out for you and Ridge.",
        "Taylor: This isn't about me, it's about you. You're really a special man, Nick. [Taylor whispering] Just keep your eyes open.",

        "Dante: It's just one night.",
        "Bridget: Stephanie seemed a little -- desperate, didn't she?",

        "Dr. Harwood: Mrs. Forrester, you can't come in here like that.",
        "Stephanie: Of course I can.",
        "Dr. Harwood: This is a sterile room, don't you realize what you're doing.",
        "Stephanie: I know exactly what I'm doing.",
        "Dr. Ramirez: It's okay, let them in. Mrs. Forrester, I'm sorry.",
        "Stephanie: Felecia? Felecia, look who I brought, look. Look over here. My god Felecia, look. It's your little baby boy. [Dominick fussing] Here. There. Look who's here. See? See how brave and strong she is. She's staying right here. [Stephanie exhales] Felecia -- he needs you Felecia. We all need you.",
        "[Felecia daydreaming]",

        "Dr. Harwood: Her blood pressure's rising.",
        "Stephanie: Please.",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Heart rate is 60 and climbing. She's stabilizing.",
        "[Stephanie laughs]",
        "Stephanie: What did I tell you Dominick? She just needed you. She just needed her baby boy.",
        "Dr. Ramirez: Her vitals are even stronger I --",
        "Stephanie: Oh, sweetheart, I told you, I told you. Felecia, this is it. Felecia -- Felecia, stay with us, please. Look, look, it's Dominick. He loves you -- we all love you. He's here with you. We all love you. Keep fighting. Yes."
