She does not like being drunk but she also does not like being alone and right now she is very lonely. Her children are gone and her sister just got re-married and she suddenly was terribly alone.

Will would love to see you.", "Brooke: Look, let's just do it another time, okay? Sometime soon.", "Katie: I'm gonna hold you to that. Call me.", "Brooke: [Sighs] Sure.", "Bill: Hey! Hey, is that my phone? Where are you going? What are you doing? Get ahold of Brooke?", "Katie: I did, but she's not available. She's got someplace she has to be.", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: My friend?", "Quinn: From AA. I thought I heard you say something about giving him a ride. Is that what you're doing today?", "Deacon: Yeah. As a matter of fact, I need to, uh -- I need to get out of here.", "Quinn: Okay.", "Deacon: So...", "Quinn: Hey. I am proud of you.

Are you trying to escape from the bed?", "[Laughter]", "Bill: Hey. I thought you said you were going in late.", "Katie: Well, Brooke's not available, so I figured, \"what's the point of staying home?\"", "Bill: Oh, what's the point? So, I guess the Spencer men -- we don't make the cut? Hey, don't you say that we are hungry all the time?", "Katie: You are hungry all the time because you are growing so fast! [Laughs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Will: [Giggles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laughter]", "George: Welcome back.", "Brooke: Thanks.", "George: Grab a coffee or water if you like. We're almost ready.", "Brooke: Oh, okay.", "George: Deacon, right?", "Deacon: Yeah. I'm sorry. Am I late?", "George: Just about to start.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Elevator bell dings]", "Pam: [Gasps] I am calling security.", "Quinn: Thank you! But I already saw chuckie boy downstairs. How nice of you to know that I'd want to say hello.", "Pam: Yeah. He let you in?", "Quinn: I'm on the \"approved\" list.", "Pam: I didn't put you on it.", "Quinn: Well, I guess Rick must have done it personally, because I'm here to see him.", "Pam: Yeah, right. I wasn't born yesterday, Quinn.", "Quinn: Clearly. Neither were these lemon bars. What are they -- like a week, two weeks old? They seem kind of stale.", "Pam: No. What do you me-- wait! You can't go in there!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Mom! What are you doing?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: I'm sorry, Rick. She just stormed right past me.", "Rick: It's all right, Pam. I asked Quinn to come.", "Pam: You did?", "Rick: That'll be all, Pam.", "Pam: And they're not stale.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: They are.", "Rick: Well, it's been a while.", "Quinn: Uh, yeah. It, uh -- it has.", "Rick: I hear congratulations are in order -- you and Deacon.", "Quinn: Oh, yes. Yes. Uh, thank you.", "Wyatt: Okay. I'm a little weirded out here. Can we skip the chitchat? Why did you ask my mother down here today?", "Quinn: Wyatt, don't be rude.", "Rick: It's all right. It's all right. I actually appreciate somebody who values my time. I'm C.E.O. Now.", "Quinn: Yeah. I-I'm aware.", "Rick: And it comes with certain privileges, including hiring and firing. I assume if your old job was available, you'd want it back.", "Quinn: Absolutely.", "Rick: I wonder if we can make that happen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: You know, I think I'm gonna --", "Will: [Crying]", "Katie: I think I'm gonna go see Brooke and check in on her. I think I would feel better about it if I saw her in person.", "Bill: Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a second. You said she had plans, and you were there last night. She's gonna know you're checking up on her.", "Katie: I know, but it -- she's going through something, and she says she can handle it on her own, but... I just don't know if I should believe her. Spent the whole day convincing myself I wouldn't crave a drink after work. I was actually starting to believe it. But on my way home, I chose a route that goes past the liquor store, maybe to prove I could drive by. But I pulled in to the lot, went in, bought my regular. Three weeks of sobriety, and... I'm clutching a brown paper bag. Thank God my daughter was home. She wasn't supposed to be. She's usually at play practice until 6:00. But she was there when I walked in, doing her homework. She saw the bag. She knew what it was... what I was about to do. The look in her eyes was all I needed to dump it down the drain. Tonight I'll take a different route.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "George: Thank you for sharing. I'm glad your daughter was home. But don't forget -- you can call me or any of us anytime if you find yourself in that parking lot again. Anyone else ready to share?", "Brooke: Um... I haven't had a drink since... not because I wasn't tempted. I was. It's just... I don't like to be drunk, but I-I don't like to be alone, either. And right now I'm -- I am very lonely. I've always had people around me my whole life -- my mom and my siblings, and when I was old enough to date, I fell in love with somebody, and then... well, that didn't work out, so there were various people, men, in my life, and, of course, there were my kids -- my wonderful kids. But right now, there is -- there's nobody home -- just a big, empty house. And I am alone. My sister just got married recently, and I couldn't be happier for her. But her wedding was very difficult for me to get through. And then when they went away on their honeymoon... that was the most difficult time, actually. Alcohol filled the void.", "George: What's different now? What helped you not drink last night, this morning?", "Brooke: A friend. I wanted nothing more than to just drink myself to sleep, and my friend came over and helped me get through it.", "George: An alcoholic?", "Brooke: Yeah.", "George: So, he understands what you're going through.", "Brooke: I suppose so.", "Deacon: It must feel good to reach out to somebody who understands, who's felt that same loneliness.", "Brooke: It really is very special. And... he knows the worst about me. [Chuckles] But still he cares. I haven't been very good to him, actually. I've been really awful. But he doesn't hate me. I don't know why. But I do know that he has been there and is there for me to help. He's helping me get through, one day at a time. And I know if I call... he will be there.", "George: Have a good day, all, and remember -- what we've said here today in this room will be held in the strictest of confidence. Keep coming back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Together: It works if you work it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: I just want to thank you for what you said. You know that I'll pick up the phone, day or night. I'm here for you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I'm sorry Ivy isn't working out for you.", "Rick: Uh, no. It's not that. I'm gonna keep her around, for now.", "Quinn: Oh, okay. So, we would be working together?", "Rick: At times. I need more out of her. Bringing on a seasoned jewelry designer like yourself could help stimulate her creativity -- you know, healthy competition and all, not that I'd be pitting you guys against each other.", "Wyatt: Uh... a-are you sure that you're ready to handle the, uh -- the employee backlash?", "Rick: You know, Wyatt, I have to think about what's best for this company, even if it means a few disgruntled employees. The bottom line, Quinn -- I've gotten a lot of requests about your work. You've bee missed.", "Quinn: Does that mean that you're offering --", "Rick: I don't know. I'm -- I'm still not thrilled with how you treated my sister. Is it worth the risk?", "Quinn: Risk? What risk?", "Rick: Basically, how much of a liability will your craziness be?", "Quinn: You do not have to worry. I'm a changed woman. Tell him.", "Wyatt: She's made a lot of progress.", "Quinn: Yeah. I-I-I guess, you know, Deacon's brought out the best in me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: What are you making?", "Will: Ohm!", "Bill: Pancakes?", "Will: Ohm!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Donna is getting a massage. She can't swing by and check on Brooke. I mean, do you think I should call my dad and see if he called her?", "Bill: I think that, uh, will is the one who needs babysitting, not Brooke. You have to trust that she knows what she's doing, Katie.", "Katie: It's just that --", "Bill: If she's in trouble, she'll let us know.", "Katie: I know, and she has in the past, but last night, the things that she said -- she's -- she's lonely.", "Bill: Well, loneliness passes.", "Katie: She doesn't do well on her own. She makes bad choices. I just hope she doesn't reach out to the wrong person.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Deacon!", "Deacon: I should have called first, right?", "Brooke: No, it's okay. Come on in.", "Deacon: Okay.", "Brooke: You okay?", "Deacon: Yeah, uh, for the most part.", "Brooke: It was a good meeting today.", "Deacon: Yeah. As a matter of fact, I can't stop thinking about it. That's why I'm here.", "Brooke: If you're tempted to drink, I'm glad you came by. You said that I can call you anytime. Well, the same goes for you.", "Deacon: Brooke, I'm tempted, but not by alcohol.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: The nanny just got here, so we will be in shortly. All right. Thank you, Adele. Okay. Ready?", "Bill: Whenever you are.", "Katie: Well, there's actually something that I want to do first.", "Bill: Thatagirl! Lock that door.", "Katie: Uh, no, no. I wasn't talking about that. I wanted to thank you. I know how much you're trying.", "Bill: Trying?", "Katie: Yeah. I mean, I'm going on and on and on about my sister, and I'm sure you're thinking about a million other things that you have to do, and I know you think I'm overreacting, but you're listening to me, and that makes me feel good. That makes me feel loved.", "Bill: You are overreacting...", "Katie: Mm.", "Bill: ...And you are loved.", "Katie: I know.", "Bill: Now go lock the door.", "Katie: [Chuckles]", "Bill: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Same salary as before.", "Quinn: Fine.", "Rick: Except longer hours. We've had an exceptional quarter. Everybody's working around the clock to make this next quarter even better.", "Quinn: Yeah, no problem.", "Rick: In that case, welcome back.", "Quinn: Seriously?", "Rick: Yes, seriously.", "Quinn: Thank you! Thank you so much!", "Rick: Can you stick around? I'd like to make it official.", "Quinn: Yeah. Consider me on the clock.", "Rick: That's what I like to hear.", "Quinn: Hey, Rick, I won't let you down. I can separate my personal life from my professional life. You won't even think about my past. I'm gonna be employee of the month -- employee of the year.", "Rick: Maybe I should order some of those plaques. That's not a bad idea. Good morale-booster. I'm gonna have Pam set up that meeting. Oh, and, uh, Quinn... don't make me regret this.", "Quinn: Oh, you won't.", "Quinn: We're gonna be working together again, baby!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Congrats.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Aah! I cannot wait to tell Deacon. We are gonna celebrate tonight! [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: What are you saying?", "Deacon: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I-I haven't had a drink in a couple of days. I mean, maybe it's messing with my head or something. That's -- that's not why I'm here. Did you mean what you said today at the meeting?", "Brooke: Every word. Look [Sighs] This whole thing is really a struggle for me, but I'm looking at it more positive now and starting to get my footing because of you. You know, you were there for me. Like when I just wanted to drink myself to sleep, you came over and you talked me out of it. You got me through that. And I really appreciate it. Thank you.", "Deacon: I'm engaged to Quinn.", "Brooke: I know.", "Deacon: I mean, we're getting ready to build a life together.", "Brooke: That, I think, is a mistake.", "Deacon: I mean, I love her. I do, you know? But then there's you -- the unattainable, the woman that I never had any right to know, the mother of my daughter. And if I could just -- if I could just have one more chance with you. I keep asking myself if anything has changed, you know, now that we're going through this together, that Ridge is out of the picture, and bill. You don't have to be lonely. Maybe I'm what you've been looking for, because I'm feeling it. I know I am. And I think you're feeling it, too. So, I got to ask you... is there a chance for us? Is there, Brooke?"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ryLhE1JRBo"}
