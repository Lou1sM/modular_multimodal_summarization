    "Recap": [
        "Deacon tells Brooke that this can not just be him. Does she feel this too? She says he is very special to her. He says that is not what he means. He needs to know if there is any future for them. He admits he loves Quinn and she has made him a better man but there is still this strong connection and he has to know if she feels it too and if there is any chance of a future together. Wyatt tells Rick that his mother is making a lot of positive changes and he thinks Quinn will not let him down. Ivy and Ridge walk in and she wonders why Quinn is here. Pam and Carter soon join and Rick tells them to welcome Quinn back to FC. Liam tells Bill and Katie that things are light here at Spencer today but he can't say the same at FC. He just got a text from Ivy and a lot is going on. Bill calls Rick a dirty little sadist. He also advises Liam to tell Katie of his plan. She is not surprised to hear that Steffy will not give her shares without Liam's love. Liam says this is not just about Caroline. Rick is making all of them miserable. Bill agrees that Rick is a smarmy little dictator and he has to go.",
        "Carter says bringing Quinn back is insane and a real liability. Rick tells them to calm down. He has already told Quinn that she is under scrutiny. He has had demands for her work and he is honoring it. He will run this company as he sees fit and if they don't like it there is the door. He says he is serious. No one has to stay. Quinn is here to stay. Quinn speaks up and says she is a changed woman. She is engaged to Deacon and trying to make a better life. Rick tells them to stop their whining and accept it, get over it. Liam suspects something is wrong with Brooke and Bill and Katie fill him in that she wasn't just being festive at Katie's wedding. There could be more to it than that. She is always busy when they invite her over and yet she is not working or doing anything else with her life. Brooke argues with Deacon about Quinn and says she hurt their daughter and she is afraid she will hurt him too. She says he wants companionship but he doesn't want Quinn. Quinn calls Deacon and tells him to get over to FC right away, she has good news. He in turn tells Brooke that he needs an answer from her. Ivy goes to see Rick. She says she was supposed to have a meeting with Rick but everyone was there. And now Quinn is working back at FC. Quinn tells Wyatt that she is so happy now that she has been given a second chance. Wyatt tells her that he is proud of her. She says that is all that matters. Anything else like this job is just the cherry on top. Deacon tells Brooke that he will not leave until she answers him. She tells him what he said was so kind and means the world to her at this time in her life. She does not know what she would have done without him. Life can be great and she can not help but think of those times with him when they created their beautiful baby girl. Maybe this could be their time but there is Quinn."

        "Deacon: This feeling -- I got to know. I mean, this cannot just be me. Are you feeling this, too?",
        "Brooke: You know I'll always care.",
        "Deacon: No, no, no. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about what you said at the meeting earlier.",
        "Brooke: I meant every word of it. You're very special to me, and you're the one person that I've really been able to count on.",
        "Deacon: Then I'm not crazy? Then there is something here, something between us? I mean, we -- we could have a future together.",
        "Brooke: Deacon...",
        "Deacon: No, listen. I've always been honest with you about how I feel. I need you to be straight with me right now. Please, tell me... is there a chance for us?",
        "Quinn: Thank you for giving me a second chance.",
        "Rick: Don't make me regret it.",
        "Quinn: I won't. I won't. I -- this job means everything to me, and I'm thrilled to be back here at Forrester, working with my son.",
        "Rick: You think she's up for it?",
        "Wyatt: I think she's making a lot of positive changes. She won't let you down.",
        "Rick: Okay. I mean it. I'll be watching you.",
        "Quinn: Yes. Yes.",
        "Rick: One bad move, and --",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no, no. Won't happen. Won't happen. I will be on my best behavior.",
        "Rick: I hope you mean that.",
        "Ridge: All right. We're here. Make it quick.",
        "Ivy: Why is she here?",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Bill: Hey.",
        "Liam: You're slacking, dad.",
        "Bill: You are funny.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Bill: You know, I made you president. I can unmake you president.",
        "Liam: I'm just trying to keep you on your toes, that's all.",
        "Bill: What are you doing?",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Bill: That's her job as my wife and my executive vice president.",
        "Liam: Okay. I'm pretty sure that qualifies you for sainthood.",
        "Katie: It does.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Katie: It does.",
        "Bill: Everybody's just so funny today!",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Katie: So, did we miss anything?",
        "Liam: Uh, no. Pretty light day here. Can't say the same for Forrester.",
        "Katie: Why? What's going on at Forrester?",
        "Liam: Well, Ivy texted me. Apparently, Rick has just called a huge meeting.",
        "Bill: I wonder what that's about.",
        "Katie: So, Rick is C.E.O. Why is it weird that he's calling a meeting?",
        "Bill: He's a weird dude.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, you should see the way he's treating Ivy and Caroline.",
        "Bill: He's a greedy, power-hungry sadist.",
        "Katie: That's funny. I think I've used those exact same words to describe you.",
        "Liam: No, no, no. This is a whole different story. I mean, the way that Rick is running Forrester is --",
        "Bill: Well, tell her about your plan.",
        "Liam: Well, it's kind of not happening right now because it's on hold.",
        "Katie: What plan?",
        "Liam: I had this idea to take over Forrester.",
        "Carter: I thought she was banned from the building.",
        "Pam: Yeah, well, so did I, but apparently --",
        "Ivy: Wait. You invited her here?",
        "Rick: I did.",
        "Ivy: Why would you do that?",
        "Ridge: Get to the point. We've got work to do.",
        "Rick: As you know, our last quarter was nearly flawless. There's one department that needs improving -- an edge, a maturity that only one person can deliver.",
        "Pam: No, wait. Rick, you are not saying --",
        "Rick: I would like you all to welcome Quinn back to Forrester Creations.",
        "Brooke: This is about Quinn. You've finally realized what kind of a woman she is.",
        "Deacon: No! I love her! Look, I-I committed to her for a reason, Brooke, and I was sure I was doing the right thing, but now I --",
        "Brooke: Now you should be having second thoughts about your fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Deacon: I get that you don't like her, okay? And you've got every reason not to. But Quinn's good for me, Brooke. She's made me a better man, and I want to marry her! This crazy connection that you and I have -- I mean, is it me, or has it gotten stronger? Look, I just -- I don't think I could live with myself if I just let the opportunity pass by, I mean, if I didn't at least take a shot. Ridge is out of the picture now, bill is with Katie, and me -- I'm standing right here. Please tell me. Give me a sign or something. I mean, is there any potential? Is there any possibility for us?",
        "Katie: So, Steffy basically said, \"no relationship, no takeover\"?",
        "Liam: More or less.",
        "Katie: Oh. That sounds like something she's day. And Ridge won't go behind his father's back.",
        "Bill: Which is ironic, being that Eric made Rick C.E.O. He's never been loyal to Ridge.",
        "Katie: Well, Rick is presiding over a very successful company.",
        "Liam: Yeah. See, that doesn't matter. It's about how he's treating people.",
        "Katie: I'm not defending his behavior. It's been despicable. But he is my nephew.",
        "Bill: And Caroline is my niece. And she doesn't have a father to protect her.",
        "Katie: She's got two very capable mothers. And I'm sure she appreciates her uncle bill's support and protection.",
        "Liam: This is not just about Caroline, guys. I mean, it's Ivy. It's Carter. It's Pam. It's Charlie. They're all miserable.",
        "Katie: What does Wyatt think>",
        "Bill: Oh, he's on board with Liam and me. He wants Rick out as much as we do.",
        "Katie: Brooke is still part of that company. I don't want her to be hurt.",
        "Liam: Oh, trust me -- dethroning Rick is what's best for everyone. If we let him continue on like this, there's not gonna be a company to run.",
        "Katie: She's his mother. I'm not sure she would agree with you.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I own part of that company, okay? And Rick is a smarmy little dictator, running around, acting like he's God. There's only one of those -- me. He's got to go.",
        "Liam: It's gonna take some time, but I'm determined to get Rick out of there.",
        "Pam: Quinn working here again? Rick, you can't be serious.",
        "Rick: The decision has been made.",
        "Carter: She's dangerous, Rick -- a liability. I wouldn't advise bringing her back.",
        "Rick: Quinn has made mistakes, admittedly, but no one can deny the fact that she is insanely talented.",
        "Ivy: Exactly! She's insane, all right! She's nuts! She pushed me off a bridge! Do you remember that?!",
        "Ridge: Not to mention what she did to your sister.",
        "Pam: And Liam -- she threatened him with a sword.",
        "Carter: And you're hiring her?",
        "Rick: Rehiring her.",
        "Carter: But you fired her.",
        "Rick: I changed my mind.",
        "Pam: Wyatt, even you must think this is a terrible idea.",
        "Wyatt: Uh...hey, this is between Rick and my mother.",
        "Ridge: You keep doing that. You ask us to --",
        "Rick: All right. Everybody just calm down! I've already advised Quinn that we'll be watching her very carefully.",
        "Ridge: How are you gonna do that?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Everything she does is sneaky and underhanded.",
        "Rick: Some of our buyers prefer Ivy's designs. We're getting requests for Quinn's. Why can't we have both options? You're both talented. There's a demand, and I'm delivering it.",
        "Ridge: This is unbelievable. I'm sorry.",
        "Quinn: Look, I-I'm sorry. If I may, I realize this has taken everyone off guard. I was, too, when he called me.",
        "Rick: It's all right, Quinn. I'm in charge here. I make the decisions. I'm gonna run this company as I see fit. If anybody doesn't like it, well, there's the door. But Quinn -- she's here to stay.",
        "Brooke: If Quinn knew what you were saying right now...",
        "Deacon: The last thing I want to do is hurt her.",
        "Brooke: Why? She's hurt so many people. She's damaged so many lives.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, she's not a bad person. I mean, she's just doing the best that she can.",
        "Brooke: Really? Did she do the best for our daughter?",
        "Deacon: I told her to stay away from hope.",
        "Brooke: But she didn't, did she? She didn't listen to you. She disrespected you because she went after hope again and again.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, she was not responsible for hope losing her baby. Now, you say what you want about Quinn, but that was not her fault.",
        "Brooke: Hope and Wyatt would be together right now if it weren't for her! They would be expecting their precious little baby.",
        "Deacon: Nobody hurts for our daughter more than I do.",
        "Brooke: Don't you see what Quinn does? She eats away at people. She destroys them little by little, one by one, and I'm afraid that you're going to be her next victim. Marrying her would be a huge mistake. I know you don't want to go through with it.",
        "Deacon: Why don't I want to marry her, Brooke?",
        "Brooke: You want to be with somebody, Deacon. You want companionship. But you don't want Quinn.",
        "Deacon: Then who? I mean, who -- who's -- who's the woman for me, Brooke? Tell me. Is it you?",
        "Rick: I'm serious. If you don't like the way I operate things, no one is forcing you to stay. I have to do everything in my power to make sure this company reaches its full potential. That's why I brought Quinn on. That's the only reason.",
        "Ridge: That's the only reason, right? 'Cause everything's always so clear-cut with you.",
        "Quinn: You know what? I understand if everyone has their reservations about me. I've done things in the past I deeply regret. But I'm giving you my word those things are never going to happen again.",
        "Carter: Mm-hmm. Yeah, right.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, thanks, Quinn, but we've heard all of that before.",
        "Quinn: Look, you can ask Wyatt. I'm a changed woman. Aren't I, honey?",
        "Wyatt: She's been trying. She's really making an effort.",
        "Quinn: I have been designing more than ever. I'm engaged to Deacon. I'm settling down. I'm thinking about my future.",
        "Ridge: Settling down with Deacon -- that's supposed to make us feel better? Come on. Really? Wow.",
        "Pam: That's not exactly a great selling point.",
        "Rick: All right, enough! Everybody stop your whining and get over it! I brought Quinn back. End of story! Does anybody else have any issues?",
        "Katie: Overthrowing Rick -- that's a bold move. It could have tremendous consequences. I don't want Brooke to get hurt. She can't take it, especially not right now.",
        "Bill: It's not gonna be right now, Katie. I mean, it's gonna take months.",
        "Liam: Hey, guys? Is something going on with Brooke? Does it have anything to do with how she acted at your wedding?",
        "Katie: She drank a little too much at the wedding.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. I mean, I kind of laughed it off. I thought she was just being festive.",
        "Bill: Might be a little more than that.",
        "Liam: Have you talked to her?",
        "Katie: I have, and she says she's fine, but I think she's hiding something.",
        "Bill: Katie's reached out, invited her over. She's always busy.",
        "Katie: Or so she says. Whatever's going on, I just hope she's getting the support that she needs.",
        "Deacon: You always were mysterious. I just can't seem to get a read on you.",
        "Brooke: Really? I think you know me very well.",
        "Deacon: I've asked you this before, and you've always said that you don't have feelings for me. When you said it, it wasn't a shock. That belief is what allowed me to propose to Quinn, to convince her to marry me.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure it didn't take too much persuading.",
        "Deacon: What, are you kidding me? I had to beg her. I mean, I had to -- I had to pour my heart out there, and I meant every single word of it.",
        "Brooke: Deacon, she lured you in. She manipulated you. That's what she does.",
        "Deacon: This is real, Brooke! I'm nuts about her. But I proposed to her when you were out of the picture. You just weren't an option. What am I supposed to do now? I know that you've always been the one for me. You're the mother to my daughter. I mean, you're the woman that I should have held on to and loved and --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Deacon: Hey.",
        "Quinn: Where are you? Are you still with your friend?",
        "Deacon: Uh, yeah. I'm just finishing up.",
        "Quinn: I need to see you right away.",
        "Deacon: Uh, what's up?",
        "Quinn: I'm at Forrester. Can you believe it?",
        "Deacon: What are you doing there?",
        "Quinn: Just get over here! I'll see you soon.",
        "Brooke: I'm guessing that was Quinn.",
        "Deacon: Yeah. She wants to see me.",
        "Brooke: That's too bad.",
        "Deacon: What -- what are we doing here? I mean, what is this? I-I need to know where I stand with you.",
        "Ivy: Is, uh -- is this a good time?",
        "Liam: It's always a good time for you. Are you kidding me?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Well, my day just got a whole lot better. How are you?",
        "Ivy: Uh... [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Oh, no. What? What happened? What's wrong?",
        "Ivy: I don't even know where to start.",
        "Liam: Is it Rick?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: It's Rick. Damn it! I knew it! I knew when you texted me. What did he do now?",
        "Ivy: Okay. So, he and I were supposed to have a meeting, just one on one, Rick and me, and then he had Pam cancel that at the very last minute.",
        "Liam: Why?",
        "Ivy: Because he called everyone in to his office for some big announcement. He had Ridge there. Carter was there, Pam, Wyatt. Well, he was there to start with.",
        "Liam: Oh, no. He didn't fire Wyatt again, did he?",
        "Ivy: No. No.",
        "Liam: Good.",
        "Ivy: But you know what? This isn't much better.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Ivy: Rick has rehired Wyatt's mother. Quinn is working back at Forrester.",
        "Quinn: Ohh! I'm back! Baby, I'm back!",
        "Wyatt: You're not happy about this, are you?",
        "Quinn: Oh, this is the third happiest day of my life. I mean, the first, of course, is the day that you were born, and then the second was when Deacon proposed to me.",
        "Wyatt: Top three. Not bad.",
        "Quinn: Yes! Oh, I'm so excited! And I am -- I am so grateful to be given a second chance.",
        "Wyatt: Well, actually, it's more like your fourth or fifth chance, but, I mean, who's counting, right?",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. Rick still believes in me.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, but everyone else seems pretty pissed.",
        "Quinn: They'll come around.",
        "Wyatt: I don't know, mom. But you know what? I...am proud of you. So, congratulations.",
        "Quinn: See? That's all that matters, is that my son is proud of me...",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: ...And that I have Deacon's support and commitment. This job is just -- it's just a lovely, scrumptious cherry on top.",
        "Wyatt: Great! Don't screw it up.",
        "Quinn: Look at me. My big return to Forrester, working with my amazing son, about to marry my incredible guy. My entire life is falling right into place.",
        "Deacon: I'm not leaving till you tell me how you feel.",
        "Brooke: I can't.",
        "Deacon: No, no, no, no, no. I want to hear you say it.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Deacon...",
        "Deacon: Come on. Listen. Hey. I told you where I stand. Now it's your turn.",
        "Brooke: The strength that you've given me and the things that you said to me... it -- it means so much to me, more than I can tell you. I mean, you've been so kind and so helpful and so supportive through this time in my life. I honestly don't know what I would have done without you.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, you know you've helped me as much as I've helped you.",
        "Brooke: No. No. I'm the lonely one. I'm the one who's been lost. But you did help me to remind me that life could be great. And then I can't help but think about those times when we were together... how unexpected and how passionate... they were... creating our beautiful baby girl. So, yeah. Yeah, I think... that this could be our time. But --",
        "Deacon: But -- but -- but what?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: Brooke, tell me. Tell me. Please tell me what's standing in our way.",
        "Brooke: Oh, gosh. So many things, um... especially the fact that you're engaged to Quinn, of all people.",
        "Deacon: So, that's it? That's -- that's what's standing in our way -- that I'm engaged to Quinn. But if not... you and me, we...",
        "Brooke: I think it could be our chance."
