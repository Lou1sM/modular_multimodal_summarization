        "Steffy tells Wyatt that they are getting married tomorrow and she needs a maid of honor and him a best man. Adam asks Eve where they were married and was anyone else there as witnesses. She asks if he is having memories and he replies yes some. There is a face he almost can see. She questions him, man or woman. He says there is a whole world he can not share with her because it is walled off and that should matter to her. She does not think him looking at the albums are going to do any good. Brooke sneaks into SP and tells Bill that she should not be here after Katie's latest accusations. Katie cleans up in the kitchen but recalls how she accused Bill and Brooke of flirting with each other right in front of her. She takes another little nip from the bottle. Brooke says they do not have the power to make sure Katie does not drink but they do have that power to offer support.",

        "Steffy: Okay. It's not like we're climbing El Capitan.",
        "Wyatt: I know. So, the first one to achieve their goal...gets a shirtless selfie from the other.",

        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Steffy: Better start puffing up that chest there.",

        "Liam: What was the name of the person who married us?",
        "Quinn: I don't know. Some rent-a-minister.",
        "Liam: But their name would be on our marriage license, right?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Yeah. But all of our legal, medical, and banking records are all packed away. Why?",
        "Liam: Was somebody else at our wedding?",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Liam: Do you have a sister?",
        "Quinn: Adam, have -- have you remembered something?",
        "Liam: Yes.",

        "Ridge: So, this is it? This is what you came up with -- high-and-low skirts?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. A lot of women still really like that.",
        "Ridge: No. They don't.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they do. Telling you.",

        "Bill: You got my message. Come in. Close the door.",

        "Bill: She apologized for that.",
        "Brooke: We can't be doing this -- I mean, these secret meetings.",

        "Brooke: We've seen Katie irrational before, and it's had nothing to do with alcohol.",
        "Bill: So, you think she's telling the truth? Because it's gotten to the point where I can't tell if I taste it on her or not.",
        "Brooke: Look, we don't have the power to stop her or to know what she's doing when she's alone, but we do have the power to offer our support. It made a world of difference to me when I was going through the same thing. Is she at home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I haven't been drinking. Look, why don't you go downstairs? You know how much booze there is in the house. Check the levels of the bottles, and you can tell me what you find. I won't be offended.",

        "Bill: Tomorrow?!",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] Yeah. You heard right.",
        "Bill: I guess living in sin isn't working for you.",

        "Liam: You don't seem to want to help me remember. Why don't you? There's a whole history we have together that I can't share with you, because it's walled off from me. Doesn't that...matter to you?",
        "Quinn: More than you know.",
        "Liam: I know you want me to pack.",

        "Liam: Aren't you supposed to meet the real-estate agent?",
        "Quinn: Well, where -- where are the albums? Did you -- did you put them someplace?",
        "Liam: Maybe. I mean, I'm the guy who can't remember. Is it important?",

        "Katie: Yeah. What would you like it to be?",
        "Brooke: I'd like us to be able to be honest with each other without being afraid that it would be the end of us. Are you still drinking, Katie?",

        "Bill: People say that's my forte.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Liam cut Steffy off completely, and me, too, apparently! He -- he knows we're getting married.",
        "Bill: Look, just ask him. Let him turn you down if that's what he feels he has to do. I will stand up for you if he won't.",
        "Wyatt: Is this some kind of \"eat your vegetables\" strategy? You think groveling to the man that my fianc\u00e9e picked first is gonna be good for me?",
        "Bill: I'm looking out for what's good for me.",
        "Wyatt: Ugh.",
        "Bill: How many years have you accused me of showing favoritism toward your brother? Well, I don't want Liam to be able to come to me and say that I favored you in this situation with Steffy...",

        "Caroline: See? So, you had a favor to ask?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Um...remember that you told me that you would never replace my mom?",
        "Caroline: Ugh, God. You're gonna make me cringe.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Now you have to. I need you to be my matron of honor. The wedding's tomorrow, and my mom's not here, and you'd be the perfect choice -- second choice. Please, please, please, please, please.",
        "Caroline: Yes, fine. Yeah, totally, as long as you agree to not use the word \"matron\" or use it in any press release.",
        "Steffy: No. No. I wouldn't. I wouldn't -- no.",
        "Caroline: And, uh, not \"stepmother,\" either.",
        "Steffy: Oh, I'm gonna call you that to annoy you.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs] Okay. Well, yes. I mean, yes! In that case, I have the perfect thing to wear!",
        "Steffy: Thank you!",
        "Caroline: Yay!",
        "Steffy: Oh, thank you.",

        "Wyatt: [Groans]",
        "Bill: What -- what are you doing?",
        "Wyatt: Losing a bet.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Wyatt: Yes. I was so sure that you were gonna say yes to being my best man. But, apparently, Steffy got her maid of honor first, so now I owe her...",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Wyatt: ...A shirtless selfie.",
        "Bill: Oh. Wow. Well, that -- that sucks. Oh, and, by the way... yes.",
        "Wyatt: What do you mean, \"Yes\"? Yes, you're gonna be my best man, after all that?",
        "Bill: That is the question on the table, isn't it?",
        "Wyatt: You just want to be able to say that you said no when Liam shows up. Am I right? Hmm? Yeah. \"No, Liam. Don't worry about it. Wyatt had to beg me. I had to say yes. I had no choice.\"",
        "Bill: Well, I really don't talk that way.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, you do.",
        "Bill: Come over here. Let me give you a hug. I'm happy for you, and I'm proud of you.",

        "Bill: I'm honored to be your best man.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I just know from experience that challenges don't end because you stop drinking.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Let's not belabor this, okay? I-I'm the one with the willpower, right?",
        "[Thumping]",
        "Katie: Ohh.",
        "Brooke: What was that?",
        "Katie: That's Will. He gets carried away throwing the ball with his nanny. We've broken four windows. Hey, Will! Don't throw the ball in the house! Got some arm on him. Of course, Bill loves --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I don't know what you're asking me. What kind of flowers? Wedding flowers, I guess. Yeah, seasonal, sure. Where are you going?",
        "Thomas: We're obviously not getting anything done in the next couple of days, so...",
        "Ridge: Calm down. No, no. Not you. Hello?",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God. You're not gonna be that kind of married couple, are you?",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] Okay. Please tell me that Dad never --",
        "Caroline: Oh, no. Never.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: What did the real-estate agent say?",
        "Quinn: That we'll probably lose money if we sell, that I didn't hold on -- uh, we didn't hold on -- to the place long enough.",
        "Liam: We don't have to move.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Adam, please, let's not argue. We don't argue. I always just give in. I thought you said you didn't know where you left those. You seem to be getting better at finding things you're looking for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Where did you get that?",
        "Brooke: When you're hiding something, people who know you, people who love you, can tell.",
        "Katie: So, did Bill send you? Did you talk to him? Is that why you're here?",
        "Brooke: He knows that something's not right.",
        "Katie: And that's what he thinks? He thinks that I'm drinking?",
        "Brooke: He wants to be there for you, Katie, more than anything.",

        "Bill: Guess who's gonna be the best man.",
        "Katie: Well, good! Good! I'm sure that must make you really happy. I'm glad you said yes.",
        "Bill: Yeah. How are things at home?",
        "Katie: Yeah, sure. Everything's fine. No reason to worry.",
        "Bill: Good. Well, I just wanted to give you the breaking news, and I'll give you the details later. I got to go. I love you.",
        "Katie: Love you, too.",
        "Brooke: Nothing is fine, Katie!",
        "Katie: You can't tell him, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Well, then, you have to tell him! You can't keep cutting him off like this. Yes, you're struggling, but it's not a crime.",
        "Katie: I made a mistake, okay? It won't happen again.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] That's what all alcoholics say.",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Brooke: Look, I know you don't want to believe this, but the best thing to do is to tell him the truth.",
        "Katie: I told Bill that I wasn't drinking. If it wasn't true then, it is now.",
        "Brooke: Katie, you're isolating yourself, and you don't even see it! I did the same thing when I was drinking.",
        "Katie: You can't tell him. Okay? I feel so alone... when he doesn't trust me. You can't say anything.",

        "Liam: I remembered where I put them. There's hope for me yet.",
        "Quinn: What do you see in those pictures?",
        "Liam: Us.",
        "Quinn: Then what do you keep looking for?",
        "Liam: Me.",
        "Quinn: You know I would do anything for you, don't you? I'm gonna go make us some lunch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Liam knows we're getting married, and, no, he's not invited.",
        "Ridge: Why not?",
        "Steffy: Did you invite Mom when you married Brooke? Anyways, he's not interested.",
        "Ridge: There were a lot of years when he was interested.",
        "Steffy: And that went away. That's what they tell me.",
        "Thomas: Maybe you should wait.",
        "Steffy: For?",

        "Ridge: Congratulations.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: So, why the hurry? It almost seems like you think someone's gonna stop you if you don't tie the knot right away.",
        "Wyatt: W-- okay. That's not how I operate.",
        "Ridge: That's exactly how you operated with Hope.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. There's a lot of water under that bridge since then. Steffy and I have both been in love before and both been abandoned, and that can feel like losing or rejection or whatever you want to call it, until you realize that the real winners are the ones that keep their promises. And I intend to do that. I love your daughter, Ridge. And I got a lot of promises to her that I just -- I can't wait to keep.",
