        "Brooke asks Bill what happened to his room. He explains that it really doesn't matter. He came home from seeing her, all upset He puts his shirt back on and says they can go downstairs and talk. She says they can talk but not downstairs as they need privacy. He looks toward the closet and says their last private conversation didn't go so well. She says she did not want to leave things like that. She tells him that she does not want to be this cold, aloof person that keeps telling him to go away. Listening from her closet post, Quinn is bored to death. Bill tells Brooke that because of Katie that is all she knows how to do. But people will talk from the cradle to the grave and he's been listening to it all his life. But loving him makes her who she is and he can't get enough of it. Aly is taking selfies as she needs a photo for the Forrester directory. Liam comes in. He is not looking for Hope; says the car just drove itself. She doesn't have to look for the dynamic duo. He just wanted to get out of the house. She calls him a genius when he helps her with her title instead of just shadow. She says she can go get her photos taken and then they could have dinner if he wants. He asks for a rain check. He says he feels his dad is going to need some propping up tonight. And he advises her than when one of those love struck puppies asks her out that he really appreciates and respects her. She blurts out that she's never had a boyfriend before. He's surprised but says it's really easy. It's like learning the words to a song you already know. Brooke tells Bill that it wasn't all bad or wrong. They loved each other. They wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. He says there is no expiration date on that so she can hold on to that. She says she can imagine them raising Will and RJ but what she can't get past is trading husbands with her sister. That is just wrong and too weird. He agrees it is taboo but haven't they already paid that price. He wants to wait as he has for months even though she told him there was nothing to wait for. He tells her she is not a failure. She did not lose Ridge; she outgrew him.",
        "Maya goes through a photo shoot of glam poses for Oliver. She tries to act normal despite their one kiss between them. She says she is glad it meant nothing more and they can still be friends. Somehow they get off on the subject and he tells her that he once had a thing for Hope. He thought he had found it but it ended badly. He can't help but think how things would be if they'd gone a little differently. He owes a lot to the Forresters but his life changed the day he dropped out of being a potential Forrester. It all depends on your last name around here and those married to it. He assures her though that he is not dissatisfied. Oliver shoots Aly's pictures although she is a little apprehensive. He thinks she is a natural and manages to bring out the best in her. She says he is the talk of the office if he is single or available. Maybe they will find out at the Spring showing. He says maybe things will look up for him by then. Later he wants to show Aly the pictures. She hates looking at pictures of herself. She points out that all the women in her family are gorgeous. There is Steffy and Hope and she is just average. He says on what universe. Bill tells Brooke that he does not want to start over. There is no one else for him but her. She says she needs more time. She vows to be a better person, a better mother and do something that she is proud of. He says he can give her the time; he kisses her. He comes back to find Quinn laid out on his bed. He commends her for being quiet and not giving him away. She says she does not want to steal him away from Brooke so what would be the point if she and Brooke got into it fighting on the floor and pulling hair out. She says he is so shallow and arrogant but she does like him a little more now that he's had his heart broken a little thanks to Brooke. Bill says Brooke does not need to know about his. She thinks he means the whip. He says no, the two of them. There is no \"you and me\". This little freak session where she jumped his bones never should have happened in the first place. She asks really does he think she wants anyone else to know about this. He threw her reputation in the sewer once before and she's not about to let that happen again. He says good as this meant nothing anyway. Quinn says he has nothing to worry about from her."

        "Aly: That's an awful thing to say, even as a joke.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Yeah, I don't know why I'm here. The car just drove itself. What's this?",
        "Aly: My Hope for the Future notebook.",
        "Liam: What does that say? \"Never ask a model if she's had lunch.\" Why?",
        "Aly: She'll think it's a trick question.",
        "Liam: Ah.",
        "Aly: So, I have to take my picture today, and I'm trying to figure out what to call myself. I have to be in the Forrester directory with my name and title, and nobody ever gave me a title except for \"Shadow,\" so Grandpa said I should make one up.",
        "Liam: Wow. That's diabolical of him.",
        "Aly: I know. I was thinking, um, \"Assistant administrative...\"",
        "Liam: Why don't you just go with HFTF intern? I mean, that's what you are, right?",
        "Aly: You're a genius.",

        "Oliver: [Chuckles] I think we got it. You are really on today.",
        "Maya: Thanks. I-it's been helping me to think of it like an acting job. Like, I have [Clears throat] Three or four different situations I'm playing out in my head.",
        "Oliver: Are we acting right now?",
        "Maya: Maybe a little.",
        "Oliver: Because of one kiss.",
        "Maya: Because I still don't think you know what I meant, and I'm not sure I know what you meant.",
        "Oliver: Why don't you tell me?",
        "Maya: I think it was a one-time thing, and I'm glad we can still be friends.",
        "Oliver: Okay. I mean, I still don't get why you're not married yet.",
        "Maya: Why are you still single?",
        "Oliver: Don't ask if you don't want to know.",
        "Maya: Well, maybe I do... friend.",
        "Oliver: Well, I moved back to L.A., got a job deejaying at Dayzee's before it was Dayzee's, and that's where I met Hope.",
        "Maya: Hope?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Hope and I were involved. You didn't know that.",
        "Maya: No.",
        "Oliver: [Chuckles] People don't talk about it anymore. I guess that's a good thing.",
        "Maya: I mean, I heard a model once mention something about you being hung up on Hope, but it never occurred to me to actually believe it.",
        "Oliver: I was that. You know, I really thought, \"this is it. Whatever there is to find, I found it.\"",
        "Maya: How'd it end?",
        "Oliver: Poorly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Should people smile for business photos or be serious? Or in between?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I think all people should smile at all times. Especially you. Look at that. Come on.",
        "Aly: I know Hope and Wyatt were working on something, unless they already left. You want me to call around and see if --",
        "Liam: Uh, no. No, no. Don't disturb the dynamic duo on my account. I just wanted to get out of the house.",
        "Aly: Is it being painted or something? Fumigated?",
        "Liam: No, but that's a pretty good idea, actually.",
        "Aly: Well, I could go get those photos taken, and we could have dinner after if you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I don't want to be this person with you anymore. This cold, aloof person who just says, \"Go away. I don't want to be with you.\"",
        "Bill: I know you don't mean it, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I mean it enough.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] That's because Katie has shamed you into thinking that's all you have a right to say. And you're worried about what people will think when we get back together. Let me tell you something. [Chuckles] People are gonna talk garbage from the cradle to the grave. They are small, they're terrified, and that's all they know. I've been listening to it my whole life. Loving me makes you you. And I can't get enough of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I never noticed any awkwardness between you and Hope.",
        "Oliver: Time heals all wounds. I owe a lot to the Forresters. I make a good living, been able to learn and grow here. But my life changed the day I dropped out of the running to be a potential Forrester. I'm sure you felt the same way when you stopped seeing Rick.",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",
        "Oliver: Now we're employees. If we don't deliver what's wanted, we're out the door. In a family-run business, you can succeed on your own merits, but only so far because those top slots are reserved for the people with the right last name and those people married to them.",
        "Maya: No job is forever. Oliver, if you're unhappy here --",
        "Oliver: I'm not. You can't get rid of me that easily.",
        "Maya: I'm not trying to.",
        "Oliver: You know, I just -- I can't help but think where I'd be if things had gone a little bit differently, that's all.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Ah. Now, unless I'm mistaken -- and to my knowledge, that's never happened -- I'm pretty sure I've just proven you are beyond photogenic, my dear... and will undoubtedly star in every future edition of the Forrester directory.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Can I ask you a favor?",
        "Aly: Anything.",
        "Liam: Rain check on dinner tonight? I just have this feeling that my dad's gonna need some propping up.",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Liam: In the meantime, when one of those guys who looks at you like a sick puppy actually asks you out, just make sure he respects you and appreciates you.",
        "Aly: Like a boyfriend? I've never had one.",
        "Liam: Really? Oh, man. It's easy. It's like -- it's like learning the words to a song you already know. I'll see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: It wasn't all bad. It wasn't all wrong. We loved each other. We were happy. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.",
        "Bill: And you need to hold onto that feeling. There doesn't have to be an expiration date on that wish, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I guess I could picture us together with Will and R.J. and raising them. At least raising them half the time. But what I can't really get past is trading husbands with my sister. That's just weird. That's wrong.",
        "Bill: Well, it does break a couple of taboos. But haven't we been through that already? Haven't we paid that price?",
        "Brooke: I'm not gonna say I don't love you. I'm just not ready. I didn't just lose a husband. I lost a life. I lost a family.",
        "Bill: Can I wait? I've been waiting for months while you've been telling me that there's nothing to wait for. I've been waiting for you to stop telling yourself that you're a failure. You are not. You didn't lose Ridge. You outgrew him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Aly: I know you're waiting for me, and I am so sorry.",
        "Oliver: No worries. Have a seat.",
        "Aly: Oliver, we can do it tomorrow. I know it's late.",
        "Oliver: Do you have to go home?",
        "Aly: No. With Dad gone, there's no one waiting, and no special time I have to be anyplace, so...",
        "Oliver: Good.",
        "Aly: Besides, look, I don't think I wore the right thing for pictures today.",
        "Oliver: You look fantastic. This will be easy.",
        "Aly: You don't have to say that.",
        "Oliver: You know, it's just for the staff directory. Most of us look like zombies in the staff directory. I promise you won't.",
        "Aly: I, uh, ran into a friend and lost track of time. I don't have too many friends around here.",
        "Oliver: That can't be true.",
        "Aly: Some people think I have too many opinions.",
        "Oliver: Well, too bad for them. You have nothing to worry about 'cause your last name is Forrester.",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Oliver: All right. Say cheese.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles]",
        "Oliver: I like that. There you go.",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Oliver: Relax your shoulders.",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, I like that. It's nice.",
        "Aly: This?",
        "Over: Yeah. And your little necklace.",
        "Aly: Oh, thank you.",
        "Oliver: Yeah.",
        "Aly: Oh, I thought I would hate this, but I don't.",
        "Oliver: No one can resist my charm. Uh, okay, move your chin a little to the left.",
        "Aly: This left or this left?",
        "Oliver: That...yeah.",
        "Aly: This one?",
        "[Chuckles]",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Aly: [Sighs] So the, uh, ladies in the cutting room have a pool going.",
        "Oliver: Like a betting pool?",
        "Aly: Some of them think you're taken, and some of them think you're not, so they're betting on whether or not you take someone to the spring showing or not.",
        "Oliver: Move your chin a quarter inch to the right, Miss F.",
        "Aly: This -- this way?",
        "Oliver: Yeah.",
        "Aly: [Chuckling] Okay.",
        "Oliver: I'll tell you what. Put money on me going solo, and you might just win big. The chances that I have a date by then are very slim.",
        "Aly: I don't believe that. And I wouldn't let anyone else say it, either. Or who knows? Maybe my luck will change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You ever think it's too late?",
        "Bill: For what? For us? No. Never.",
        "Brooke: Too late to ever make it right again. Maybe there was too much anger or too many tears, too much sadness. Maybe it's better to just start all over with somebody else, somebody new. I mean, there's thousands of women, right?",
        "Bill: I don't want anyone else. Why... [Sighs] Why can't you let go of a man who thinks he's too good for you? You know, I've made a lot of mistakes. I... I freely admit that. But I've never made that one.",
        "Brooke: I know. You've been very consistent and very committed. Don't think I haven't noticed what a great person you are. It's just that I need to be a good person, too. I need to do something that I'm proud of, and I need to be a good mom. I just need a little time. Can you give me that?",
        "Bill: Of course. Of course I can.",
        "Brooke: I, uh -- I didn't think I could sleep tonight unless I came here to tell you that.",
        "Bill: Thank you.",
        "Brooke: I think I'll go and let you tidy up. [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Uh, yeah, I-I better do that. I'll walk you to the door.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Nice. Very nice. You got some nice shots here, Aly.",
        "Aly: I'm glad. Well, I've kept you late enough.",
        "Oliver: You don't want to see how they turned out? Don't worry about the hour. I got no one waiting on me, either.",
        "Aly: I, um -- I don't really like having my picture taken, so...",
        "Oliver: I thought we had fun, no?",
        "Aly: I'm not that good at it, I mean.",
        "Oliver: You don't have to be. I do. And luckily for you, I'm the best.",
        "Aly: I don't really like looking at pictures of myself.",
        "Oliver: Don't you think that's normal, Miss F.? You got to at least pick a favorite.",
        "Aly: You pick. You know them better than I do.",
        "Oliver: I love that one.",
        "Aly: It's okay.",
        "Oliver: Seriously? When people see that in the directory, they are gonna -- they'll fall out of their chairs.",
        "Aly: You can use it if you want.",
        "Oliver: Okay, or we can choose another one.",
        "Aly: Please, don't.",
        "Oliver: Why?",
        "Aly: The women in my family are gorgeous. Look at Steffy. Hope. I'm average, and all the pictures in the world won't change that, and its fine.",
        "Oliver: I'm sorry, but in what universe are you average in any way?",
        "Aly: I should go. I-I don't even know why we're talking about this. Looks don't matter.",
        "Oliver: Especially when you don't see them, Miss F. But I see you.",
        "Aly: Good night.",
        "Oliver: Good night.",
        "Aly: Thank you, Oliver.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I was thinking that I would sneak out the back as you left, but she might have seen me. I really need to get out of these clothes.",
        "Bill: Uh, not here, you don't.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. It's highly amusing how you defend your endangered virtue.",
        "Bill: What exactly is your angle, Quinn?",
        "Quinn: I think I've been a pretty stand-up guy for you, wouldn't you say?",
        "Bill: Well, y-you did stay pretty still in there. I-I will give you that.",
        "Quinn: That, I did.",
        "Bill: You could have screwed things up for me or at least attempted to, but you didn't. Why?",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Oh, you would have loved that, wouldn't you? Me and Brooke pulling each other's hair, rolling around on the floor. What would be the point? I don't want to steal you away from her. Frankly, I don't think she's really clear on whether she wants you back, either. But you are still so shallow and so arrogant, but I do like you a little bit more now that you've had your heart broken a little bit. And I think we have Brooke to thank for that.",
        "Bill: She doesn't need to know about...this.",
        "Quinn: What? This? Oh. Oh, you and me?",
        "Bill: No, no. No. There is no \"You and me.\" This little freak session, where you jumped my bones, it never should have happened in the first place.",
        "Quinn: Oh, please. You really think I want anyone else to know about this? You threw my reputation in the sewer once before. I'm not letting it happen again.",
        "Bill: Good. Because this didn't mean anything, anyway. Right?",
        "Quinn: You got nothing to worry about from me. . I'm over the hill."
