    "Recap": [
        "The beach is set up for the wedding. Wyatt walks back into the house where Bill and Katie congratulate him on his wedding day. Bill tells Wyatt that he cleans up fine but he needs to have a little father/son talk before the others show up. They discuss Quinn and her bringing the new man in her life \u0096 Adam. Adam asks Eve what the big rush is. They do not have to leave tomorrow on their trip. She manages to sweet talk him and says she has one quick errand to run and dissuades him from going along. She wants him to stay and pack. She quickly shows up at the wedding gushing how thrilled she is for Wyatt. Instead of packing Adam picks up the wedding album once more and almost sees the face of Steffy on their wedding day. Ridge tells Steffy that he wants her to be happy and she can with Wyatt. She says her mother just called and cannot come, but she sent this beautiful bouquet.",
        "Quinn slips into Steffy's dressing room and wants to hug her before the ceremonies. Steffy says she knows Quinn was always in their corner even before there was a Steffy and Wyatt. And because of her past involvement with Wyatt it was a little scary, but she is okay with that now and she appreciates her coming. Wyatt catches Quinn before they head down to the beach. He wants to know again if she had anything to do with Liam disappearing. She repeats her little story that Liam collapsed, she found him, tried to take him to hospital, and he did not want to go. So it looks like he just took off and Wyatt should not be worrying about him on his own wedding day. Adam gets on the laptop and starts experimenting with making faces like the one he keeps seeing in the pictures. The bride emerges and the ceremony will begin."

        "Wyatt: Marry me. Look, when -- when... when we were down on the beach, I told you that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. I meant that. I know I said that I'd give you some time to think about it. But... time's up!",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: I... marry me, Steffy. Be my wife.",

        "Bill: Hey, what are you doing, huh? Why aren't you dressed?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Look at me!",
        "Wyatt: Hi to you, too, Dad. Katie. I was just down at the wedding site making sure everything was all ready, you know? Oh, and thank you for congratulating me on my wedding day.",
        "Bill: Few chairs, some flowers -- you're good to go!",
        "Wyatt: Is he serious?",
        "Katie: My husband, the romantic. Congratulations.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks, Katie. Are you still up for being my best man?",

        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Congratulations, son.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Katie: Where's Quinn? I know she was a big proponent of a this. I wonder what's keeping her.",

        "Quinn: Hey!",
        "Liam: Hey. What do you think of me trimming the beard and cutting the hair? I want to look more like this guy --",
        "Quinn: No, no, no! I-I-I think you look good just the way you are. We need to start packing, hon. You know, we're leaving tomorrow on our big adventure.",

        "Wyatt: About?",
        "Bill: Well, how to handle your new father-in-law, for starters.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I'm not worried about Ridge. He's actually been very supportive.",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah, whatever. Don't be fooled. Being married to your cousin Caroline, maybe that softened him a bit, but you're a Spencer, and you better watch your back.",
        "Katie: What about little Douglas? Does he need to watch out for him, too?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: Did someone mention my boy's name?",

        "Bill: Oh, surprisingly, she's not here yet.",
        "Katie: Should we call and check in with her?",
        "Wyatt: I'm sure everything's fine. Plus she's bringing someone with her.",

        "Wyatt: New man in her life. Adam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Everybody needs a change of scenery every now and again. Maybe getting away will help you regain your memory.",
        "Liam: Okay, but I-I thought that that's what I was doing right here, right now. I --",
        "Quinn: I-I think I know what's best for us, okay? Oh, listen, there's something that I have to go and do. Um, but you just hang tight, and you will not be cooped up for much longer, okay?",
        "Liam: Okay, why can't I just go with you, 'cause I'm going stir crazy here.",
        "Quinn: I know, I know, but I need you to stay here and -- and just keep packing. I'm thinking maybe what we'll do is we'll go up north. Rogue River Valley -- it is -- it's beautiful and remote. Doesn't that sound ideal? You know what? I love the beard.",

        "Steffy: Good.",
        "Caroline: It's not really fair, is it? The grooms have it so easy. They just got to, like, put on a shirt and some shorts --",
        "Steffy: No, no, no, no, no. Wyatt better not be wearing his favorite board shorts. No. It's not happening.",
        "Caroline: You hid them, right?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, of course, in the back of his closet where he never goes.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] I have never seen my cousin happier.",
        "Steffy: Really?",

        "Thomas: Yeah, well, just treat my sister right.",
        "Wyatt: You got nothing to worry about. I love Steffy. And I'm gonna spend the rest of our lives together proving to her just how much.",

        "Steffy: I never wore pigtails.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's how I remember it. And you were fearless. Even then, you were fearless and smart and funny. [Sighs] And there wasn't a father in the world prouder than me. And there isn't a father in the world prouder than I am right now.",

        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] She's here in spirit. And so is Grandma and Phoebe. You say you're proud of me, but... I'm proud of you because you are my biggest champion. Even when I screwed up, which was basically, like [Chuckles] every other day.",

        "Steffy: Yeah. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Yeah, you made some mistakes. We all make mistakes. But look at you now. You're the president of a major fashion house. And young women everywhere -- they look up to you. You're an icon. How did that happen?",
        "Steffy: And soon-to-be wife to a wonderful man. What more can a bride ask for on her wedding day?",

        "Katie: He's joking. He's joking.",
        "Bill: Yeah, lighten up.",
        "Eric: What about vows? You and Steffy write your own vows?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, well, my vows pretty much wrote themselves. I mean, how could they not with an incredible bride like mine, right? [Chuckles] No, I-I-I just wanted Steffy to know how truly committed I am to her and how I'll always be there for her no matter what life throws my way.",
        "Reverend Rydale: Excuse me. I'm, um, Reverend Rydale.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Should I go and check and see if the minister's here?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, maybe that's a good idea. We don't want to keep everyone waiting.",
        "Caroline: Right.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: Okay.",
        "Quinn: Hey! The minister just arrived. Uh, Wyatt's introducing him to everybody.",
        "Steffy: Including your boyfriend?",
        "Quinn: Oh, well, no, he's not here, but I'll -- I'll explain that later. Caroline, do you mind if I have just a minute with Steffy before this all begins?",
        "Caroline: Oh. Okay.",
        "Quinn: Steffy --",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Steffy: Quinn, oh, Quinn. You really don't have to say anything. I know you've been rooting for Wyatt and me since, well, before there was even a Wyatt and me. And, um, okay, I'm just gonna be honest with you. It was a little scary, just because I know you've been really obsessed with Wyatt's love life before, and I've just noticed that you've restrained yourself, especially now, and I really appreciate that. Wyatt does, too.",
        "Quinn: Wow. [Chuckles] Well, you said everything I was going to say except so much better.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Good. Um...",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Quinn: Listen, I just -- I want you to look forward in your life, Steffy. Don't -- don't look at the past, okay? And I am -- I am so thrilled and excited for you and my son. Okay! So, Steffy is almost ready, so I think it's time for us to start making our way down to the beach.",
        "Eric: All right.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Finally. I'll see you guys down there. Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Come on.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, um, I hate to bring up my brother's name today of all days, but I got to know. Are you sure you didn't do anything to Liam? You were on that security footage.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, please. I already told you. Liam collapsed. I-I tried to take him to the hospital, but he said no. He -- he didn't want to go. He just wanted to get away, and apparently that's exactly what he did. Baby, it's pointless for you to be worrying about your brother today. You have Steffy. You are marrying her. Concentrate on her. Don't give Liam another thought.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Wow. You never looked more beautiful.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I know I'm supposed to give you a big speech about marriage and what it's supposed to be, but I don't...",
        "Steffy: I know what I have in Wyatt. He's good for me, and we're actually good for each other. He respects me and he loves me and he keeps me laughing. What better way to start a marriage than that, right?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Let's get you married.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You put this all together all by yourself?",
        "Wyatt: Pretty much, yeah.",
        "Bill: I'm impressed."
