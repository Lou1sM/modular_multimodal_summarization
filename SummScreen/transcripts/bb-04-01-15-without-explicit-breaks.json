        "When she confronts Brooke, Quinn realizes she is wearing the same perfume she smelt on Deacon. She asks Deacon if Brooke is his friend from AA. Deacon admits she is and he could not just leave her in her hour of need. He went to the meeting alone and had no idea Brooke would be there. He realized her story was worse than he originally thought it was and they made a pact to help each other in times of need. He hopes Quinn can get over this as Brooke is doing good now and has not had another drink since that meeting. She says she can not believe him. She has been telling him and everyone else at FC that she is a different Quinn, a more likeable Quinn and she could not be prouder of Deacon. He is trying to be a good man and improve himself and he reached out to help a friend. She doesn't want there to be secrets between them though and she wishes he had told her it was Brooke. She gets a phone call and has to go attend to some paperwork concerning her being back at work. She says she knows she will be seeing a lot more of Brooke and she will not disappoint. Deacon has to believe that Quinn is right and she is different now. Brooke says if she is it is because she with Deacon now. She reminds him the last time Quinn was at FC it almost cost Ridge his life. Deacon reminds her that it was Bill that threw him into the Gulf. Brooke is still shocked that Deacon will marry Quinn. He repeats they are good for each other and Brooke will always be that untamable Logan woman. They hug and Deacon leaves and closes the door.",
        "Bill plays with Will at the office and tells Katie that she is VP and does not have to run everything past him. It is the President that needs to suck up if he wants to keep his job. He is driving Ivy back to FC where there is plenty of drama today as they have hired Quinn back. Rick said the public was demanding Quinn's work but he knows it is really just to stick it to Ivy. And that is not right and one more reason to take the company out of Rick's hands. Maya has a lot on her mind with thinking of her conversation with Nicole about being Myron. Rick comes in and tells her that he re-hired Quinn. Nicole walks in and gushes about wanting a tour of the place and especially to see a photo shoot. Rick encourages Maya to do that for her sister. And to be sure and introduce her to everyone as they will be seeing a lot more of Nicole. Maya forgets that she has a fitting downstairs. Nicole seems okay to stay and talk to Rick. Maya doesn't want that and says Rick is too busy for that. She invites Nicole to come to the fitting and they can start the tour there. Katie leaves a text for Brooke and confides to Bill that she is worried about her. She tried to stop by and see her and she is worried who she is spending her time with. Bill thinks it is Ridge but Katie says even worse. Bill can not believe Brooke would turn to a convict and a loser and one coupled with Quinn and that will set her over the edge again. Rick tells Maya that he was looking forward to spending a little more time with Nicole and maybe he'd find out a few things he did not know about Maya. Maya suddenly says she can reschedule the fitting it does not have to be today. Even Nicole says she will not tell Rick anything that he doesn't want to know. Maya leaves long enough to leave Rick with Nicole and he fills her in on some of his past history, about his sister, Bridget, and how honesty is so important to him and why his past relationships with Amber and Caroline did not work out. They could not be less alike except that they kept things from him. But with Maya, she tells the truth and holds nothing back. Nicole smiles at that and says it was not always that way. Maya charges in and tells Nicole that is enough, say no more. With Deacon having left, Quinn slips into Brooke's office and she calls Brooke a pathetic lush. She says this is a new low even for Brooke, and who in the hell does she thinks she is?"

        "Quinn: Same perfume. Am I right? Brooke is your friend from A.A.?",
        "Bill: Look at this, how cool this -- look.",
        "Katie: I have this for you.",
        "Bill: You don't need to run that by me. You're the vice president.",
        "Katie: Oh, actually, I wasn't really running it be you. It's kind of already done.",
        "Bill: Oh! So you just, uh, showing it to me as a courtesy, huh?",
        "Katie: Well, you know, I'm trying to suck up to my boss a little bit.",
        "Bill: Oh! Hey, mommy's being a suck-up. Say, \"hey, mommy, you're a suck-up, mommy.\"",
        "Will: Suck-up.",
        "Bill: Attaboy!",
        "Katie: Awesome. Thank you so much for teaching him that.",
        "Bill: Us Spencer men, we just tell it like it is, right? Yeah. Hey, you know, you got to teach, uh, my son, the president, to do a little sucking up himself if he wants to keep his job.",
        "Katie: Where is he? Where is our president?",
        "Bill: Well, actually, he is driving Ivy back to Forrester. A little drama there today that was pretty upsetting for her.",
        "Katie: What did Rick do now?",
        "Bill: Oh, only the, uh, worst, most idiotic thing imaginable. Rehired Quinn fuller.",
        "Nicole: The reason I haven't seen you since you left home is because...you've been living a whole nother lifestyle. I've done research, and I know why our parents kept it a secret.",
        "Maya: [Voice breaking] What secret?",
        "Nicole: You're not my sister, Maya. You're not \"Maya\" at all. You're Myron. You're my brother. I've read about the operations and...procedures. What did you have done? How many?",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: Why couldn't you just wear the clothes?",
        "Maya: Because being myself isn't an outfit that I can put on and take off.",
        "Nicole: But if you didn't look right in the dress, didn't that tell you something? Namely that you were a boy?",
        "Maya: Never. I never was.",
        "Nicole: I mean the way nature made you.",
        "Maya: This is the way I was born. You cannot tell -- not Rick... not anyone.",
        "Nicole: No problem. You take care of me -- I'll take care of you.",
        "Rick: Talk about explosive.",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Rick: My decision to rehire Quinn fuller. I-I thought you had heard.",
        "Maya: Yeah, I've had a lot on my mind.",
        "Rick: Nicole. I thought you guys were working on your relationship.",
        "Nicole: So did I. That's why I'm here. No time like the present, right?",
        "Rick: Absolutely. You and Maya have years to make up for.",
        "Nicole: Not sure we're into braiding each other's hair or gabbing about guys like sisters do when they grow up. We kind of missed out on that.",
        "Rick: Well, I'm sure that there are other things you can share.",
        "Nicole: We both love fashion. I mean, this place -- I'd kill to get a tour, see what it takes for you to be a model.",
        "Maya: You saw the photo shoot the other day.",
        "Nicole: I know, but you seemed a little off, probably because you were in a rush, like you said.",
        "Rick: Well, she's definitely not in a rush now. Go on, baby. Show her around. It'll be fun.",
        "Katie: He fired Quinn. Why would Rick rehire her?",
        "Bill: Well, according to Liam, the official party line is that Forrester buyers were clamoring for Quinn's jewelry.",
        "Katie: As opposed to Ivy's? I mean --",
        "Bill: In addition to. Look, it's just that little tyrant's way of sticking it to Ivy because she's no fan of Maya.",
        "Katie: He's letting his personal feelings influence his business decisions. That's no way to run a company.",
        "Bill: That's why I'm telling you that somewhere down the road, control of Forrester has to be wrested from Rick.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: And as far as Quinn is concerned and any claims she's making that her insanity is a thing of the past, that's a bunch of crap. She's unpredictable as a rattler.",
        "Katie: Well, I've got to get will back to daycare.",
        "Bill: I'm gonna do it.",
        "Katie: You are?",
        "Bill: I'm giving him a piggyback ride. Come on, buddy! Let's go! Piggyback ride!",
        "Quinn: Is Brooke the friend you've been helping?",
        "Deacon: Yes, okay? She is, all right? But before you get all... baby, remember that we -- we have a history together. We -- we share a child together. I couldn't just leave her in her time of need. There's no reason for you to get upset. None at all.",
        "Rick: Make sure to introduce Nicole to everyone. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of her around here.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Maya: Oh. Oh, dear.",
        "Nicole: What?",
        "Maya: Well, I totally forgot that I have a fitting downstairs. I guess we'll have to postpone the grand tour till another time.",
        "Nicole: I could wait here with Rick until you're done, unless I'd be in the way.",
        "Maya: Actually, you would. Rick is too polite to say it, but he's really busy. Back to back meetings, conference calls.",
        "Rick: Nothing I can't reschedule. Go on. Go do your thing. I'll keep Nicole company. I'm sure there's something that we'll be able to talk about.",
        "Maya: You know, on second thought, why don't you come down with me to the fitting? It won't take long, and we can start the tour from there.",
        "Nicole: That okay with you, Rick?",
        "Maya: Of course it is. Right, honey?",
        "Katie: Hey, it's me. Um, I know I left you a couple messages, but just give me a call when you get a chance, okay? I love you. I stopped by Brooke's on the way over here. I've been worried about her, you know.",
        "Bill: I know.",
        "Katie: Well, she is going through something more than I realized.",
        "Bill: Okay. Brooke swear you to secrecy?",
        "Katie: Not really. I just... I'm concerned, and I wish she would lean on me instead of this other person.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on. Ridge? I mean, it's bad enough he's involved with my niece. Now he's two-timing her?",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no, no. It's not Ridge.",
        "Bill: Well, who?",
        "Katie: [Sighs] She says that he's been a life line, but all I see are complications, especially considering he's...",
        "Bill: He's what? Brooke in some kind of trouble, Katie?",
        "Deacon: Look, I was up-front about how concerned I was with Brooke's drinking. Hell, I even started slipping myself. That's why I went to an A.A. Meeting. I had no way of knowing that she was gonna be there. And when I got there, she was telling her story, and I could hear the desperation in her voice. And I-I knew that it was way worse than I thought. So we made a pact, right? We made a pact that we would be there for each other during the dark times. And no, it hasn't been easy. And the temptation is still there. But the good thing is that Brooke -- you haven't had a drink since that first meeting, right? I mean, look, it's early on. I get it. But, I mean, we've made progress, right? We've -- we've learned things about each other. And, baby, you're right. I should have been honest with you from the get-go and said that Brooke was my friend from A.A. But she had enough to worry about. You know, I-I just didn't think she needed you going ballistic on her for no reason at all. Can we please just move past this?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I can't believe you.",
        "Bill: All right, look, I appreciate that you don't want to betray Brooke's confidence, but, Katie...",
        "Katie: I know you're gonna keep after me until I tell you everything.",
        "Bill: Well, we both knew something was going on, and if you know what that something is, you got to tell me about it.",
        "Katie: Actually, it's more than one thing.",
        "Bill: All the more reason that we should be there for your sister and not this bozo. We're her family. I mean, he couldn't possibly be as concerned about her as we are.",
        "Katie: He's...kind of family.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Katie: The person who's supporting Brooke is... Deacon.",
        "Bill: What?!",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. That was my reaction, too.",
        "Bill: Why would she turn to Sharpe, of all people?",
        "Katie: Well, he is hope's father.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on. Forget about that. He's a convict and a loser, and nothing illustrates that better than his being engaged to Quinn. And I'm sure that, uh, she's not gonna be thrilled sharing her fianc\u00e9 with the woman that he fathered a child with. It's gonna send her way over the edge -- again.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: Here it comes, right? I mean, I-I can't -- I put it all out on the table, and all you can say is, \"I can't believe you\"?",
        "Quinn: What have I been saying to everyone here at Forrester? That I've changed. I'm not the same woman that Rick fired all those months ago. Gone is the erratic, neurotic Quinn. She's been replaced with a more",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Quinn: Oh. [Chuckles] Sorry. [Sighs] HR. They want to get me back in the system. I'm gonna catch up with you later so we can celebrate. I guess we're gonna be seeing more of each other now that I'm working here at Forrester again. I won't disappoint, Brooke. I never do.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: I was hoping to get a little alone time with Nicole, grill her about your past. Odds are she knows a few things about you that I don't.",
        "Maya: Sweetie, you know Nicole and I didn't really grow up together.",
        "Rick: Yeah, but sisters, they share all sorts of things. I'm sure she has a few little tidbits that I don't know.",
        "Maya: He'll probably be disappointed. Won't he?",
        "Nicole: Probably. Then again...",
        "Maya: You know, on second thought, why don't I just cancel the fitting? There's no reason I can't do it tomorrow.",
        "Rick: And there's no reason to reschedule. Nicole will be fine.",
        "Nicole: It's okay, sis. I won't divulge anything you don't want me to.",
        "Rick: There. You see? Now go so I can get to know Nicole better, remind her of what an amazing big sister she has.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rick: And then there's my sister, Bridget, the doctor. She lives in new York. She has a little boy. Well, then again, he's not so little anymore.",
        "Nicole: Does she know about you and my sister?",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] The whole world knows about me and your sister.",
        "Nicole: Well, that you're together running Forrester side by side, but there's more to the story, right?",
        "Rick: I mean, if you're -- you're discussing Maya's loyalty, how honest she is.",
        "Nicole: Honesty is a big thing for you, isn't it?",
        "Rick: Well, yeah. No relationship can survive without it. Which is probably why none of mine ever did. Amber, Caroline. They couldn't be less alike except for the fact they kept things from me. It just shattered my trust. You and Maya, you're just getting reacquainted again. It's almost like you're strangers. But once you do get to know each other better, you'll realize what I have -- with Maya, what you see is what you get. There's no secrets, no holding back.",
        "Nicole: Of course. How would you know my sister's keeping something from you if she's good at hiding it? Not saying that she is. It's just Maya hasn't always been open and honest.",
        "Maya: That's enough, Nicole. You've said enough!",
        "Bill: Look, if anybody should be there for your sister, I think it should be us.",
        "Katie: I agree. And I'm not crazy about Deacon, but maybe he can help her better than we can right now.",
        "Bill: You can't be serious.",
        "Katie: I love that you're looking out for my family. But we shouldn't go charging over there, at least not yet.",
        "Bill: All right. Whatever you want.",
        "Katie: That's what I want.",
        "Bill: You know what I want?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Katie: Yeah. [Laughs]",
        "Deacon: I guess Quinn's right. I mean, we're gonna have to stop expecting that she's gonna react the way that she has in the past.",
        "Brooke: You actually believe that she's changed?",
        "Deacon: I think that she's finally getting the life that she wants.",
        "Brooke: Because of you!",
        "Deacon: No, and because of Rick. I mean, you saw how happy she is to be working at Forrester.",
        "Brooke: I know, and I've got to talk to him. I have no idea what inspired him to rehire her.",
        "Deacon: Brooke! Probably the fact that she's talented as all get-out!",
        "Brooke: Last time she was here, she practically cost Ridge his life.",
        "Deacon: Okay, wait a second. [Chuckling] Wait a minute. Bill's the guy that threw Ridge into the Persian gulf, not Quinn.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: Besides, Brooke, you heard what she said. It's not who she is anymore.",
        "Brooke: So you're actually going to marry her?",
        "Deacon: I-I get that you have major concerns. Damn it, Brooke, we're good together. She and I, we -- we're good for each other. As far as you and me, you will always be my unattainable woman. I mean, at least that's how it's always been. Right up until I --I mean, when I saw her just now at her very best, it made me realize... if you -- if you ever feel the urge to drink again, I'll be there for you. I will. Please don't cut me out just because of Quinn.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Deacon: Speaking of my fianc\u00e9e... I got to head out. Brooke... I'll always care for you.",
        "Brooke: You made a huge difference in my life, and honestly, I don't know what I would have done without you. I will always care for you, too.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Quinn: You pathetic lush. This is a new low even for you. Who the hell do you think you are?"
