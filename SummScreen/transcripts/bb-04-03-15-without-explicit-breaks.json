    "Recap": [
        "Wyatt walks on into the room and says he knew it. He just heard Deacon say that he and Brooke had another shot if he was not engaged to his mother. Does that sound like a guy who wants to get married? Oliver gives the potential models a pep talk and then Nicole joins in and wants to submit herself for the job. Oliver tells her that he is pretty swamped today so she will have to run this past Maya or even Rick. Carter is worried. He knows something is bothering Maya and assures her that she can tell him. Deacon tells Wyatt that he has nothing to worry about. He is in love with his mother. Brooke speaks up and says yes at one time Deacon thought he had a chance with Brooke but then she went to Milan and Deacon fell for Quinn so that was the end of it. Katie tracks Rick down while he is working out. She scoffs that he is newly divorced so he should be going out and getting fat. Nicole interrupts Carter and Maya with Carter saying they are in the middle of something. Nicole smirks that she doesn't mind talking in front of Carter if Maya doesn't. Wyatt tells Deacon that the fact they are even talking about it means he should not be marrying his mother. He has never gotten over Brooke and he just admitted it to her. Deacon says he would not have even proposed if he still had feelings for Brooke.",
        "With Carter gone, Maya tells Nicole that she does not appreciate this, Nicole thinking she can come talk to her any time when she is busy. Nicole proceeds that Maya can do her a sisterly favor by making sure she can get on that runway today as a model .again helping each other. Quinn sharpens her dagger just as Wyatt walks in. She calls it a letter opener for Rick to replace the plastic one on his desk. Wyatt says it looks more like a .then he ends up telling Quinn that he walked by Rick's office and saw Brooke and Deacon. Brooke had said that there could be a chance for them if he were not engaged to Quinn. He heard Deacon say this bothered him. Quinn thinks about it and accidentally cuts her hand when squeezing it too tightly. Wyatt says they denied it but the first thing she needs to do is not talk to Brooke but give Deacon's ring back and give him what he wants. Deacon goes back to Brooke and says as unlikely as it seems he is going to remain with Quinn, and Brooke will always be the unobtainable Brooke Logan. Maya tells Nicole that she can not snap her fingers and make her a model. Nicole says Maya surely is not saying no as she would not want to do that. Oliver tells Carter that something is going on between Nicole and Maya that he doesn't like. Aly even had to give up her room at Eric's because of Maya giving it to Nicole and yet they can't stand to be in the same room together. Carter confides in Oliver that Nicole does not go to UCLA after all so that is why she is hanging around Forrester now. Katie tells Rick that it seems to be getting easier for him to move on. He admits that Caroline lied to him and kept secrets the one thing that he can not tolerate, but she can't stay with Ridge forever and he is sure in time they can still work together at FC. Nicole tells Maya that she was gone for years and now she wants to be a big sister so start acting like it. She wants a part of this life so give her a chance. They are bantering back and forth when Carter is outside the door and about to walk in and hears the harping. Maya ends by saying she will tell Rick eventually. Nicole says she needs to tell Rick right now that she is Myron, her brother, not Maya. Carter walks in with shock written all over his face. Brooke is working alone in her office and turns around suddenly to find Quinn lunging at her."

        "Wyatt: I knew something was going on with you two.",
        "Brooke: What? Wait. No, no.",
        "Wyatt: I heard it. You still have feelings for her.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, you completely misunderstood.",
        "Wyatt: Really? Really? You could have another shot with Brooke. If you weren't engaged to my mother, you could start over. Is that not what you just said? What if my mom had overheard this instead of me? Are you kidding me?! With the way she reacts?! [Scoffs] No. You know what? She trusts you, dude. She loves you, but she shouldn't, 'cause you'll end up hurting her like no one else has. And, believe me, that ain't gonna be pretty.",
        "Oliver: And you must be Shia. All right, ladies. Rick Forrester will be choosing two, maybe three of you from the photos I take today. So stay focused. Stay calm. Show the camera your personality, what makes you special, the one that Rick will want representing Forrester. Give me a few minutes to get prepped, and we'll get started.",
        "Nicole: Can I join?",
        "Oliver: Hey. Uh, sure. Uh, I could use some help taking notes.",
        "Nicole: Uh, no. I mean join them. Audition to model.",
        "Oliver: Have you modeled before?",
        "Nicole: No.",
        "Oliver: We're pretty packed today.",
        "Nicole: Add me. Please?",
        "Oliver: I just take orders around here, you know? I start changing things, I get fired. You need to talk to Rick or Maya. One of them tells me to add you, I will.",
        "Nicole: Okay.",
        "Katie: Oh, there he is -- my nephew, C.E.O., And Mr. Universe candidate.",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah, that's me. I know.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: No, it's my light day. What are you doing? You looking for mom?",
        "Katie: No, actually. I'm looking for you.",
        "Rick: Yeah? Why's that?",
        "Katie: I got a bit of an odd call earlier from your former mother-in-law. Apparently, Caroline received the divorce papers, and Karen wants to make sure you're okay.",
        "Carter: What's going on?",
        "Maya: Uh... it's nothing.",
        "Carter: Maya, something is bothering you. And whatever it is, you can tell me. I won't judge.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, I have no intention of hurting your mother, ever.",
        "Brooke: Deacon did want another chance with me, and your mother knows that. But then I went to Milan, and Deacon fell for Quinn. The timing was wrong.",
        "Deacon: That's right. So, you see? You've got nothing to worry about.",
        "Wyatt: You guys can pretend like nothing's going on, but I don't buy it, not one bit.",
        "Rick: [Sighs] Karen doesn't hate me?",
        "Katie: I think she and Danielle just want what's best for Caroline, and...if that's not you, then I suppose they're happy that it ended before it got really complicated, you know, with kids and everything.",
        "Rick: And Caroline? What's their take on how she's handling it?",
        "Katie: I got the impression that being at home was good for her.",
        "Rick: Hmm.",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Katie: Well, I-I'm just glad to see that you're taking care of yourself. I mean, you're newly divorced. Shouldn't you be drinking and getting fat?",
        "Rick: Well, yeah.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] I suppose what they say is true. Living well is the best revenge.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: I-it's fine. You don't have to worry.",
        "Carter: Okay, Maya. I know -- I know a lot went down between us, and things didn't work out the way I hoped, but... I still care about you, okay? I want you to be happy. Okay, Maya. I know you, and you're not acting like yourself, so... something is stressing you out. Is it your sister? What is it?",
        "Nicole: Maya, we need to talk.",
        "Carter: We're kind of in the middle of something.",
        "Nicole: That's okay. I'm comfortable talking in front of Carter if you are.",
        "Maya: Not now, Nicole.",
        "Carter: Hey, I'll take off. I'll check in on you later.",
        "Maya: Thank you.",
        "Carter: I meant what I said. I'm here for you. If you ever need someone to talk to, you can open up to me about anything.",
        "Wyatt: Deny it all you want, but I know what I heard -- like how you've been going nuts, that -- that if you weren't engaged to my mom, that you would have another chance with Brooke.",
        "Brooke: But he is engaged.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, listen to me. I never would've proposed to your mom if there was any part of me that wanted to be with someone else.",
        "Wyatt: You've always had a thing for Brooke! And now here she is, basically telling you that she'd consider it. You know what? The fact that you two are even talking about this means that you shouldn't be marrying my mother.",
        "Deacon: I love your mom.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? Enough to give up on the opportunity to be with Brooke, the woman that you've been going after all these years? I don't think so. [Scoffs]",
        "Oliver: Chin up. Shoulder to camera. Eyes to camera. Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Oliver: All right, ladies. Take five. Violet, you're next.",
        "Carter: Ladies. How you doing? Are they changing into swimsuits? Because I can stick around.",
        "Oliver: I'm afraid not.",
        "Carter: [Laughs] These girls any good?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Yeah. Rick and Maya are gonna have a hard time choosing.",
        "Carter: Mm.",
        "Oliver: Speaking of, have you met Nicole, Maya's sister?",
        "Carter: Yeah.",
        "Oliver: We had the weirdest interaction earlier.",
        "Maya: I would appreciate if you wouldn't do that.",
        "Nicole: What?",
        "Maya: Make me feel like you'll tell anyone at any time. This is my business --",
        "Nicole: Did I say anything to Carter? No.",
        "Maya: No, you just made me feel like you would. That has to stop.",
        "Nicole: I can do that. Oh! And you can do something for me.",
        "Maya: Yeah? What's that?",
        "Nicole: I was just down at the photo studio. Oliver's checking out new models. I want to be one of them.",
        "Maya: I-I'm not in charge of who gets to model.",
        "Nicole: You're lead model. You're dating the C.E.O. First lady of Forrester. You can get me on that rundown. We agreed to try this -- being sisters? You help me, I help you. What's more sisterly than that?",
        "Rick: Hey, tom. Those are classified, by the way. I'm not sure the vice president of Spencer publications should be getting a sneak peek.",
        "Katie: Oh, don't worry. I'm not working undercover. Have to admit... [Sighs] ...Caroline does have talent.",
        "Rick: Yes, she does. And I'm glad that Forrester gets to benefit from that.",
        "Katie: So, you're okay still working with her?",
        "Rick: [Sighs] It's a little awkward. But it doesn't have to be that way forever. I don't want us to be enemies. I mean, we were friends before we ever got together. So, in many ways, Caroline and I can still make a great team.",
        "Wyatt: Hey.",
        "Quinn: Hey! Check it out.",
        "Wyatt: Uh... a letter opener?",
        "Quinn: Uh-huh! Yeah. It's a thank-you gift for Rick. I saw a cheap, plastic one on his desk, and I thought a C.E.O. Should have something a little classier, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. It's -- it's nice.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: It -- it looks... sharp.",
        "Quinn: Oh, yes, it is. I already tested it. And it will open even the toughest of envelopes.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles nervously]",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Something wrong?",
        "Wyatt: Mm? Oh. I mean... [Sighs] I overheard something.",
        "Quinn: Okay...?",
        "Wyatt: I-I was walking by Rick's old office, and -- and Brooke was in there... with, uh... Deacon.",
        "Quinn: Okay. And...?",
        "Wyatt: And I... I thought that you should hear it first from me, because if days go by, maybe even weeks, you know, and then you find out on your own --",
        "Quinn: Just tell me! Tell me.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Okay. Um... she said there's a chance for them, that your engagement is the only thing stopping them. And, mom... [Sighs] ...Deacon said that he was going nuts thinking about it. His words.",
        "Quinn: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: I see.",
        "Wyatt: They deny anything's happening, but -- my God! Your hand! Are you okay?",
        "Quinn: What? Oh! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just a hazard of the job, you know? [Chuckles] Oh, they have, um -- they have been spending a lot of time together lately, you know? Brooke's needed a bit of help. [Chuckles] Just such a -- she's such a delicate little flower. [Sniffs] I'm, uh -- I'll have to explain things to her.",
        "Wyatt: That's not why I told you. I don't think you need to say a word to Brooke ever. The person you need to talk to is Deacon. Give him his ring back and -- and tell him to figure out exactly what he wants.",
        "Quinn: I appreciate your telling me.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt wouldn't go to Quinn, would he?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckling] Oh, probably exactly where he went.",
        "Deacon: All right, I got to go find him.",
        "Brooke: Wait. Are you sure?",
        "Deacon: If we're talking about Quinn, yeah, I'm sure. Brooke, I'm always gonna care about you. I'm always gonna smile when I think about the time that we shared together, the connection that we had. You're the mother of my daughter... the unobtainable Brooke Logan. I just can't chase it anymore. As bizarre as it seems to everyone about me and Quinn, we just click. There's something about us that just works.",
        "Brooke: You're making a big mistake. And I hope that you realize that someday. I just hope it's not the day that she comes at you with a sword.",
        "Katie: You and Caroline, a team? Do you really think that's possible?",
        "Rick: So our marriage failed. True, right? Marriages fail all the time at this office.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles dryly]",
        "Rick: I'm still C.E.O. She's still a wonderful designer. Maybe we'll be better suited for that kind of teamwork.",
        "Katie: Maybe.",
        "Rick: And I'll try to ignore the fact that she's with Ridge.",
        "Katie: Mm.",
        "Rick: Because let's be realistic. How long is that gonna last? Caroline is a smart woman. And, eventually, every smart woman leaves Ridge.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Yeah.",
        "Carter: Nicole wants to be a model?",
        "Oliver: As if I'm gonna put her on the rundown without approval. Rick does not like surprises.",
        "Carter: That's why she went to see Maya. Yeah, she's -- she's talking to her now.",
        "Oliver: I thought she was a full-time student. Why would she want to add modeling to her schedule?",
        "Carter: Can you keep a secret?",
        "Oliver: Yeah...?",
        "Carter: Nicole lied. She's not taking classes.",
        "Oliver: Why would she make that up?",
        "Carter: Beats me.",
        "Oliver: Oh, explains why she's here all the time, and at the Forrester house, causing trouble. You know she took Aly's room?",
        "Carter: Even though Maya doesn't want her around.",
        "Oliver: Something is going on between those sisters.",
        "Maya: I can't just snap my fingers and make you a model.",
        "Nicole: I'm not asking you to put me in a fashion show sight-unseen. It's an audition, that's all. You can give me that. I'll do the work from there. Look, if I fall on my face, I'll be the first one to laugh and admit that it was a mistake.",
        "Maya: Okay, let's say that you do this. You become a model. What about your long-term goal of becoming a computer programmer?",
        "Nicole: Are you saying no to me? Because I don't think you want to do that.",
        "[Breathing heavily] [Gasps softly] Hey, babe. Yeah, I'm still at work. I can't talk long. How'd it go? No kidding. Really?! [Continues breathing heavily]",
        "Brooke: [Gasps]",
        "Quinn: I told you to stay away from Deacon.",
        "Brooke: Look, I don't know what Wyatt told you.",
        "Quinn: You should've listened to me, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: [Groans]",
        "Katie: Well, it seems like it's getting easier for you, moving on.",
        "Rick: Yeah, it's funny how that happens. In the beginning, it feels like it's just -- it's so much pain, that you'll never be happy again. [Sighs deeply] You know, it's just so hard to believe. If she hadn't... look, Caroline lied to me. She kept secrets, even though she knew that was the one thing that I couldn't tolerate.",
        "Maya: I want to help you. I want what's best for you. So of course I'm going to encourage you to think twice before walking away from computer programming and into modeling, something that's very hard to break into.",
        "Nicole: So why are you making it harder for me? Just tell Rick to put out a memo, and it's done.",
        "Maya: You can't just walk into a new career and expect it to just unfold for you.",
        "Nicole: Look, if you can do it, I can do it. Smile at a camera. Can't be that hard.",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: Look, you were gone for years. You're supposed to be a big sister to me, so start acting like one.",
        "Maya: I just don't understand why you're fixated on modeling. Let me help you in other ways.",
        "Nicole: Why can't you help me in the way that I'm asking? Let me be a part of this world that you stumbled into. You were working at a coffee shop, and now you're a famous model living at the Forrester estate. I want a shot at it, too. Give me a chance.",
        "Maya: You know, if you really want a place in my life, threatening me is not the way to go about doing it.",
        "Nicole: I'm not threatening you.",
        "Maya: Yes, you are. I'm not stupid. I know how this works. I give you this. I set you up as a model. Tomorrow, it's something else. It'll never be enough. So, you know what? It stops here. You're cut off. Done. You better respect me. Respect my privacy. And not because you're getting something in return, but because you're my sister.",
        "Nicole: But you're not.",
        "Maya: Stop it.",
        "Nicole: You're not! And if Rick knew that you --",
        "Maya: I will tell him eventually!",
        "Nicole: See, I don't think you will. I think you're too ashamed.",
        "Maya: I am proud of who I am.",
        "Nicole: But not of who you were, Myron...my brother. You need to tell Rick. Why don't you just tell everyone that you were born a man?",
        "Maya: This is my private business!",
        "Nicole: Whatever.",
        "Maya: Nicole, you wait. Nicole, wait!"
