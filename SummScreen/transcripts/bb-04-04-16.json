Thomas also gives Wyatt a warm welcome. Eric says there is a lot of support here in this room. Brooke tells Rick and Maya that she is thrilled for Wyatt but it is strange that no one has heard from Liam. Pam speculates that Steffy must be over Liam or she would not have married Wyatt. Brooke tells Rick that she is still worried about Katie if she can be truthful and give up the booze. Katie tells Bill she was a very good girl. At the wedding during the toasts she did not have a single little drop. He does not have to be worried. She thanks Bill for trusting her. She thinks by seeing her therapist and not drinking she will be back to herself in no time. Eric tells Quinn they miss her at Forrester's and she can come back any time she wants. She tells Eric and Wyatt that she hopes they do not mind but she is going to take a little vacation; it is sort of a mystery. She really needs to get away. She is so relieved how things worked out.",
        "Adam plays around on the internet focusing on the collage of photos trying to remember the face that will come to him during his wedding. Adam hides everything when he hears Eve coming in. She said she had a glorious day but notices he has not packed very much so wonders what he has been doing since she has been gone. She says the past is the past and the photo albums should not matter. They have their whole future together. He says he wants to know more. He wants to know about their wedding day. Bill tells Katie that she is a strong woman and he is very proud of her. She calls Brooke and tells her the wedding and reception was fine and she did not have a single drink. She is getting herself under control so Brooke does not have to tell Bill. Brooke says she does not want to see her in pain and also not to keep things from Bill. Eve tells Adam that she has told him everything she knows; there is no big mystery. He asks her why she can not be honest with him. He knows there is more to it than that. She asks if his memory is coming back. Wyatt tells Steffy that she is incredible and he will never take her for granted. She has the brains to be President of FC and also to marry him, so she is very smart."

        "Bill: Well, I love you, and I am protective of you.",
        "Katie: You don't have to be. I was a very good girl, not even one, tiny, little drop.",

        "Liam: Where'd you go? You look like you got a tan.",

        "Wyatt: I actually saw them shake hands at one point.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Today was a miraculous day.",

        "Katie: And I feel bad about not being truthful, but we're in a very good place right now, and I'm getting myself under control.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I want you to know that I do understand, and if you need any help, I am willing to be there for you. I just don't like seeing you in this kind of pain. And I don't want this to damage your marriage.",
        "Katie: Bill and I are good right now, okay? If you really want to support and protect my marriage, then you won't say anything to him. Not one word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Why -- why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Because I have questions about my past, and the more I ask, the more you seem to avoid answering me.",
        "Quinn: I-I don't know what would give you that impression. I've been answering your questions the best I can.",
        "Liam: You see those -- those photos over there, our wedding? I just want details, and you never want to talk about it.",
        "Quinn: It was a sunny day. We went out for steak afterwards. I mean, it's -- it's no big mystery.",
        "Liam: Eve, I know there's more to it than that. What -- [Sighs] Why can't you just be honest with me?",

        "Wyatt: Have you seen the bathroom lately?",
        "Steffy: Okay.",

        "Wyatt: You are perfect for me. And after sharing today with you and exchanging our vows, I know that now more than ever. I will never take you for granted or us for granted. You're incredible, Mrs. Spencer.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: With your grace and your grit, your zest for life and adventure. And you're very smart. Like, just incredibly smart. You know, like, president of Forrester Creations, and you had the brains to marry me? I mean, you're smart.",
