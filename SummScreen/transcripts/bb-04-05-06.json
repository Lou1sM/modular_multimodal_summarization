        "Nick: That's it. See? You get it all ready, and you put it on the chocolate, just like that. And then you squeeze it together -- mmm! Okay, who wants this one? Huh?",
        "Hope: Me, me, me!",
        "Nick: Ohh, ohh! You? I think you've had plenty already, don't you think?",

        "Brooke: Hmm, what?",
        "Nick: You are so busted. Come here.",
        "Brooke: What are you talking about?",
        "Nick: Come here. [ Brooke laughing ] I have evidence.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I get it. I've got food all over --",
        "Nick: Chocolate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Dr. Ramirez feels that we should tell the rest of the family about Felicia condition. He feels pretty strongly about it.",
        "Christian: Are you ready to go in?",
        "Eric: Yeah, in a moment. Doctor, I thought you understood our decision to keep Felicia's condition a secret.",
        "Christian: I do. You're trying to protect your family, and you don't want to get their hopes up. But I've got Felicia's latest test results, and I think you and your family have reason to hope.",
        "Eric: She's improving?",
        "Christian: Dramatically. Now, she's still got a way to go, but there's every indication that she's going to make it.",
        "Stephanie: Are you sure about this?",
        "Christian: Go in and see for yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Yeah, thanks anyway. I don't know who else to call.",
        "Massimo: Well, I just spoke to the harbormaster again. Dominick did not radio his heading when he left the marina. And no boats were coming in or going out at the time.",
        "Ridge: So nobody knows what direction he went?",
        "[ Massimo sighs]",
        "Massimo: He could be going anywhere.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, wherever he went, he took Brooke and the kids with him. The bastard's high-jacked my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: It's sticky, that marshmallow, huh? Oh, my gosh, mom's gonna sing us a song!",
        "Brooke: No, you are.",
        "Nick: Me?",
        "Brooke: Yes, you.",
        "Nick: Not you?",
        "Brooke: No! Camping on this island wouldn't be the same without you singing songs.",
        "Nick: Oh, all right. Well, what are we gonna sing? Let's sing something we all know, huh? Will you help me if I sing something? Let's see -- oh, I know.",
        "[All singing] If you're happy and you know it clap your hands if you're happy and you know it clap your hands if you're happy and you know it and you really want to show it if you're happy and you know it clap your hands",
        "Nick: Very good. Way to go, R.J. I think it's time for all pirates under 4' to go to bed. What do you think, Mom?",
        "Hope: Tell us a story first.",
        "Nick: A story? You want a song and a story?",
        "Hope: Please?",
        "Nick: I don't know about that.",
        "Brooke: Okay. But just one story, and then you've got to go to bed.",
        "Hope: Make it a long one.",
        "Nick: A long one, huh? Hmm, let me think about that. Oh, I got one. Have you ever heard the story about blue-eyed bill? He was the handsomest sailor in the seven seas. He was tall and strong, and he was very clean, and his sword was always shiny. And every time he was on his ship -- the soaring seagull -- he'd come into port and all the girls would line up and they'd take their handkerchiefs and they'd wave to him. But he didn't pay any attention. You know why? Because he had a special girl back home waiting for him, the beautiful lady lee.",
        "Hope: Is this a love story?",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Does it have a happy ending?",
        "Nick: Well, do you want it to have a happy ending? Then it'll have a happy ending.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm gonna put a stop to this right now.",
        "Massimo: Wait a minute. Hold it. Let's not overreact. Ridge, you don't know where he went.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I know all right. He got the idea from me, Massimo. He thinks he can remind Brooke of what they had. Before R.J., before Bridget -- only there wasn't enough time to take her back to Hawaii. They're on the channel islands.",
        "Massimo: Yeah, I remember. Brooke and Dominick were stranded on that island a couple of years ago, right?",
        "Ridge: That's where this whole fiasco started, Massimo. A night alone on a deserted island. Only this time, he's dragged my kids into it. I swear, he's not going to get away with it this time. Call the airfield, will you? I want the Marone chopper on the roof in 15 minutes. I'm bringing my family back, tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: And then blue-eyed bill, with his last gasp of air, took a jump and soared to the top of the mountain and he landed face to face with lady lee. And they each knew that their never-ending love had given him life. And that's where their adventure began. She's sleeping. My story put her to sleep.",
        "Brooke: That's not because your story was boring -- it's because we all had such a great day.",
        "Nick: You sure?",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Nick: Well, it's not over yet. Not for the grownups.",

        "Ridge: I'm gonna get Brooke and the kids off that damned island.",
        "Massimo: Listen to me, you stormed the island before -- did it bring her back to you? No. You want a relationship with Brooke -- you cannot solve this problem with a sledgehammer, okay? You want to cut the tie between Brooke and Dominick? Then you've got to use a scalpel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hey, how are the kids?",

        "Brooke: How did you know I was thinking about bridget?",
        "Nick: Because I think you do a mental bed check for all of your kids. And you say a prayer for every one of them, every night.",
        "Brooke: That's true. I say a prayer for you, too, you know.",
        "Nick: Me? I'm in there?",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Nick: Well, I feel very special. It must be working out, I'm here.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, it is working out -- you, me, the kids. Right here on this island, where we fell in love. Finally together. Finally content. It's the answer to so many of my prayers. Sing me a song.",
        "Nick: You want a repeat performance? Oh, feeling musical tonight, aren't you? \"Happy if you know it clap your hands,\" you want that one again?",
        "Brooke: No, no, no. No, I don't want that one. I want --",
        "Nick: Okay, what do you want?",
        "Brooke: Our song.",

        "[ Brooke sighs]",
        "Brooke: Yes, I do remember.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Brooke: In fact, I haven't been able to get it out of my head. It's the one thing that's given me hope when nothing else could. Open up your eyes tell me what you see is there a place for me inside of you can we both forgive try to just forget forget the past and let today begin I'm going back again I'll take it to the end remember where we've been and where we have to go take a look around look at what we've found and know that we can be what we want to be I'm going back again I'm going back again",

        "Felicia: I thought I died.",
        "Stephanie: So did I, honey.",
        "Eric: You would've, sweetheart, if your mother hadn't brought you here.",
        "Stephanie: We had you on life support -- I know that's not what you wanted, but it was the only way, honey.",
        "Felicia: What else?",
        "Stephanie: Chemo, radiation and most importantly, you had a liver transplant.",
        "Felicia: Thank you. Thank you, Mom.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I didn't do this alone, sweetheart. We have a lot of nurses and doctors to thank. And one of them is Dr. Ramirez. He's actually the person that saved your life.",
        "Christian: Hello, Felicia. You've been through a lot. I want you to take it easy.",

        "Christian: I can't take all the credit.",
        "Felicia: My baby --",
        "Stephanie: Honey, he's the reason you're here. When we took you off life support, I brought him to the hospital. I brought him here to you. I put him here on top of you and you held him and you felt his heart beating. I know -- I know he's the reason you are here.",
        "Felicia: I need him, now.",
        "Felicia: I need to see Dominick.",
        "Eric: We'll bring him.",
        "Christian: Soon. You've still got some fighting to do. You're doing very well. You're latest labs show no sign of unusual antibody activity.",
        "Eric: That's wonderful news.",
        "Christian: And I hope to be getting more good news in the weeks to come. But in order for that to happen, Felicia's going to have to rest and conserve her strength. So that means no more crying, okay?",
        "Felicia: I want to see --",
        "Christian: Yes, I -- I know you're gonna have a lot of questions for me and your parents. We're gonna answer them all. Right now, I just want you to rest and try to get some sleep.",
        "Felicia: Will you stay?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, honey, of course. We're not going anywhere. And more importantly, neither are you.",
        "Felicia: I love you, Mom.",
        "Stephanie: No crying. I love you, too.",
        "Felicia: I love you both so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Massimo: You're angry and you're frustrated, but you've got to understand -- that if you make the wrong move now, Dominick is not going to be responsible for derailing your relationship with Brooke, you will.",

        "Massimo: This time he's going to listen. Because if he doesn't, there'll be consequences.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Even when I was trying to forget about you, I couldn't forget that song. It was the one absolute truth in the middle of so much confusion. You and I were denying our feelings for each other. We were trying to do the right thing. And I would lay awake at night, trying to make sense of it all. And I just kept hearing that song. And I'd remember how I felt the first time I heard it. We have gone back again. Gone back to what is real. Back to each other.",
        "Nick: Well -- not completely, not yet.",
        "Brooke: Well, not physically, but in our hearts.",
        "Nick: Yes.",
        "Brooke: That's what really counts. That's the real connection.",
        "Nick: And it's never gonna be broken.",
        "Brooke: You don't know how much I really want to believe that.",
        "Nick: We tried to break it. We tried, didn't we?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Nick: And it didn't work, did it?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Nick: So -- I'm here. We're here. You have my word. I will never leave you or your children, ever."
