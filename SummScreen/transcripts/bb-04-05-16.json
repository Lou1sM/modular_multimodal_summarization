        "Adam says he is just very confused, he is not sure it is memories. Eve says she is his wife, she wants to help and protect him but he must tell her what he is thinking. She is aggravated by his obsession of who he is and where they were married. She feels like suddenly she is not enough for him. He can not believe she does not want him to be normal again. She rants that she is starting to feel used. She has spent much of her life taking care of him and now he is suspicious of her. Nothing is going to make them happier than they are right now. He says he has not seen that look in her eyes before. He is feeling like he does not know the real Eve. Brooke lets herself in and catches Katie again with a Vodka bottle although she has not had a drink yet. Brooke asks her just how long can she keep this up without telling Bill. He is not stupid. She laments that Bill is her husband and it's her business, not Brooke's. Bill walks in and Brooke says she wanted to hear about the wedding and Katie was filling her in.",
        "Adam tells Eve that he feels he is on the verge of discovering something right here. She says they can compromise. She is going to go finish packing and they can go away and discuss this further. He goes back to his composite photo but can not quite make out who it is. Wyatt takes Steffy to the bedroom where he has strewn rose petals all over the bed. They make love. Katie manages to dismiss Bill from their talk and then tells Brooke that she is not an alcoholic and everything is under control. If she tells Bill it will only worry him. Eve apologizes to Adam and says she just wants to be with him. Nothing is more important than putting their lives back together and they can not do it here; it is too cramped. They need to forget the past and think of their future. She loves him, pure and simple. She tells him about Oregon where they can camp, fish in the stream and she knows he will love it. He doesn't seem convinced. He goes back to his composite and remembers the bride walking toward him on the mountain."

        "Brooke: Will's nanny was leaving, and she let me in. She said you were here in the kitchen. Where's Bill?",
        "Katie: He's upstairs. And before you say anything, I haven't had anything to drink.",
        "Brooke: Yet.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] God, I-I need to make this decision on my own, okay? I'm so tired of everyone breathing down my neck. You should understand that better than anyone.",
        "Brooke: I also know what you're going through and the battle you're fighting.",
        "Katie: I'm winning the battle.",
        "Brooke: Not as long as you keep hiding that bottle.",

        "Katie: Why? Why now? You weren't thinking about being my sister when you were telling Bill how much you love him.",
        "Brooke: You are not gonna throw that in my face to justify your drinking. Bill and I are worried about you. We care. We love you, Katie. You're struggling right now.",
        "Katie: I'm fine. The only thing stressing me out is worrying about whether you're gonna say something to Bill.",
        "Brooke: How long do you think you can keep this lie up? Bill is going to figure it out, and not because of me. He's not stupid, you know?",

        "Quinn: No. \"We,\" Adam. We need a break.",
        "Liam: Okay. All right. That, too. But do -- do you understand that I'm looking for me? I mean, isn't that -- isn't -- Eve, isn't that what you want? For me to be normal again, for me to know who I am?",
        "Quinn: Yes, but people search their whole lives for the answer to that question -- who I am? I mean, you're not going to find it in these albums.",
        "Liam: Okay. All right. You don't understand why this is --",
        "Quinn: No, I understand, okay? I do. I understand that I am starting to feel taken advantage of. I'm starting to feel used.

        "Liam: No. I just -- I have questions, and I'm looking for answers.",
        "Quinn: Yes, but you're never gonna find any answers that make us any happier than we are right now. So -- so -- so, what am I supposed to do? I'm supposed to wait on you, hand and foot, while -- while -- while you keep going on with this identity search? You are my husband! You are Adam! Just look in the mirror!",

        "Katie: And to Bill. I mean, you two have gotten pretty close.",
        "Brooke: Well, sounds like a nice family event.",
        "Katie: It was. Everyone behaved themselves, even me, right, babe? [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Yep.",
        "Katie: You really should have been there. I mean, the Forresters and the Spencers getting along -- it was a lovely party.",
        "Brooke: I imagine so.",
        "Bill: There was one significant no-show. Liam should have been there.",
        "Katie: Well, we have to be patient, right?",
        "Bill: Patience is not my strong suit. We know that, Katie. Liam needs to get back here, where he belongs.",

        "Quinn: I haven't been in a position like this before -- having to take care of a helpless husband.",

        "Quinn: Please, don't -- don't -- don't make more of this than -- than it is.",
        "Liam: Just answer my question, Eve. Have you come at me like that before or not?",
        "Quinn: I've had anger issues in the past. But you -- you were the one who's helped me through all of that. You know what? You were right. You were right. You said it yourself that we have been cooped up in this place for too long, and that is why we need to get away.",
        "Liam: Well, maybe you do, but I feel like I'm on the verge of something here. Do you understand? I've -- I feel like it's -- it's right here.",
        "Quinn: Okay. All right. Then why don't we do this? Let's compromise. Okay? We -- we will go away, and when we get to our destination, then you can take all the time you need to -- to figure out whatever it is you want to figure out. And -- and I will even help you, okay? Okay, I -- hey, I'm gonna go finish packing, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You're so beautiful.",
        "Steffy: The way you look at me, that's how I feel.",
        "Singer: Been so long since I felt these desires finally lit the flame to take it all higher so much to say, but it'll just have to wait for now I'm gonna hold you and make you feel safe the candlelight glows all around you tonight fantasy feelings never felt so right the night won't last forever, but we sure can try it's you and me, baby, and the world is on fire it's you and me, baby, and the world is on fire the world is on fire",

        "Katie: I'm sure Liam will respond in some way to his brother's wedding.",
        "Bill: He didn't respond to the engagement.",
        "Brooke: Liam is definitely going through something.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, aren't we all? Look at Katie. She could have closed up, shut us all out. Instead, she's taking control. Unlike Liam, who's obviously out of control. I'm proud of you, the way you handled yourself at the wedding. I'm sure your sister is, too.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, um, you know, why don't you let me finish up with her, okay? I'm sure you've had enough wedding talk.",
        "Bill: You know me so well.",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: [Smooches] I'll see you upstairs.",

        "Brooke: Katie, you can't just wean yourself off of alcohol, especially if you're an alcoholic.",
        "Katie: Brooke, I-I'm not an alcoholic! I had a bad couple of weeks, okay? I have it under control.",
        "Brooke: Okay, now that kind of talk worries me.",
        "Katie: If you say something to Bill, you will sabotage my marriage. Is that what you want?",
        "Brooke: I would never do that.",
        "Katie: Then just let it go. Okay? You saw him. He loves me. He trusts me. Don't come between us. Don't do that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hey. I-I didn't mean to go off on you like that. I've been under a lot of pressure at work. I-I haven't been there that much since I've been caring for you.",
        "Liam: If we go away... you would quit your job?",
        "Quinn: I already took a leave of absence.",
        "Liam: That's a big decision.",
        "Quinn: I just want to be with you. There's nothing more important than -- than putting our lives back together. We just -- we can't do that here.",
        "Liam: Why not?",
        "Quinn: 'Cause this place is too cramped.",
        "Liam: So we move to a bigger place.",
        "Quinn: This -- this -- this is about starting our life over again. Forget about the past. Look to our future, you know, in another city, away from the -- the -- the urban sprawl and the freeways and the -- and the bad memories. I love you. Plain and simple. That's why we're doing this.",
        "Liam: Where would we go?",
        "Quinn: I told you about Oregon, remember? The Rogue River Valley? When we get there, we can -- we can get a cabin by a stream, and -- and we could fish and kayak. It's -- it's a better environment for you, Adam. I'm doing this for you, for us. You want that, too, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: My wife.",

        "Wyatt: That's my wife. Yeah. Oh, nice to meet you. Yeah, this is my wife, Steffy. Hi. Hey, guys, I got to go. I got to get back to the wife. I like saying this, you know? I'm gonna say it all the time. My wife thinks they're going to the playoffs. Oh, my wife went shopping today.",
        "Steffy: Can you, like -- can you stop? Stop. Stop.",
        "Wyatt: What? I love this! This is great.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: I have a wife. And, God, do I love her... just her smile and her laugh. I will never take you for granted. Not one day. Nothing will ever come between us."
