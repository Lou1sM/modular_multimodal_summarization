        "Wyatt wakes Steffy up with a pretty breakfast tray with flowers and all her favorite foods. She says he can not spoil her like this forever. She remembers their words of commitment to each other and that will be forever. Wyatt says he hates to leave her on their first day of a honeymoon but he is worried about his mom and thinks he ought to go see her. She says yeah, he probably would like to see this new guy in her life. It might really open his eyes to see what kind of guy he is. Meanwhile on the other side of the mountain Adam asks Eve where they are going. She says some place a long way from L.A., a fresh new start. He finds a sword necklace in her belongings while Eve is packing the car. Bill calls Justin in and says he has an assignment for him \u0096 find his son. It's not like Liam but it is as if the rest of them do not exist and he may just be sitting on top of a mountaintop alone somewhere. He can go off and find himself but he has no right to just cut himself off from everyone else. He wants Justin to look with a fine tooth comb and find out what Liam is up to.",
        "Eve returns to the cabin and asks Adam what he is doing with the necklace. She admits it was a gift to him but he didn't like it so she put it away. Adam asks more questions and she questions why he is asking so many when she told him everything he needs to know. She wonders if the necklace is making him remember. He asks would that make a difference if he did. He walks away when she says forcing things are not making it better. He says he does not have time and it's like she does not want him to ask questions. She replies again that everything she is doing is for him and she promises everything will be fine. She cajoles him that they just need to say goodbye to this room. She starts to kiss him but he pulls away, thinking of kissing another girl, Steffy. Wyatt walks up and sees a For Rent sign on the cabin door, he peeks inside the window. He lets himself in and keeps going into the bedroom where he sees Quinn kissing Liam. Shocked, he demands some answers from her and why Liam is here. Adam pulls back and also in shock asks who Wyatt is and what did he call him \u0096 Liam? Wyatt wonders if he has been here all this time and demands answers from Quinn."

        "Wyatt: Good morning, wife. Morning.",

        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I hope you're starved, because I made all of your favorites.",

        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Steffy: Is this how it's gonna be every morning? Breakfast after nonstop wedded bliss?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Steffy: Mm.",
        "Wyatt: Did we dream it all, though? Like, last night, our wedding on the beach? I will always be honest with you, and I will always, always put you before anyone else. My commitment to you is forever.",
        "Steffy: I trust you that your commitment is forever, [Voice breaking] because my commitment is forever, too. [Sniffles]",
        "Both: No.",
        "Wyatt: No, not a dream.",
        "Steffy: That wasn't a dream.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: It really happened. We got married. And we're starting a life together.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: It's crazy. I love, love, love you, Mrs. Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: The sooner we get these last few boxes packed, the sooner we can hit the road.",
        "Liam: Where are we going, again? Oregon?",
        "Quinn: I rented a cabin at Rogue River Valley.",
        "Liam: Without mentioning it to me first.",
        "Quinn: The cabin? Yeah. No, it -- it was a surprise, but I know how cooped up you've been feeling around here lately, and I think you're really gonna love it there.",
        "Liam: Long way from LA.",
        "Quinn: That's the point, isn't it? I mean, new surroundings, new adventure, fresh, new start. Ooh, I'm gonna start packing up the car.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[Car door opens]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: You said it was urgent.",
        "Bill: What took you so long?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Justin: Uh-oh. What's wrong?",
        "Bill: Hopefully nothing. But the more time passes, the more concerned I get.",
        "Justin: Well, how can I help?",
        "Bill: I have an assignment for you. Find my son. Find Liam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Steffy: Hmm. I could get used to this.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Steffy: Especially in the comfort of our own home.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] Yeah. That's the beauty of having our honeymoon in Malibu.",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: We get a jump on what married life is gonna be all about, those every- day moments that will never just be every-day moments anymore.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Not when you've spending it with the woman you love, the woman you love more than anything else in this world.",
        "Steffy: Your mom truly raised a romantic guy.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: She did. She did.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Speaking of Mom, um...",
        "Steffy: Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that.",
        "Wyatt: What? I just -- okay. The last thing I want to do is leave my beautiful, sexy bride on our first full day as man and wife.",
        "Steffy: Uh-huh. I'm hearing a \"but\" coming.",
        "Wyatt: But... I'm concerned for my mom, and I-I think I should pay her a visit.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: You've heard nothing from Liam?",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Justin: Hmm. Maybe there's a no-texting policy at this yoga retreat.",
        "Bill: I'm not even convinced he's at a yoga retreat, Justin, not after all this time. And hopefully it's as simple as he's, uh, blissfully sitting on a mountaintop somewhere, and he's just forgotten the rest of us exist.",
        "Justin: That's not like Liam. Family is always numero uno to him.",
        "Bill: The Liam we knew, yes. But this Liam? Something's off, Justin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: What are you doing with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: This is your last text from Liam?",
        "Bill: I know what you're thinking. Why didn't I do something sooner?",
        "Justin: No, you wanted to give your son a chance to pull himself together. I get that.",
        "Bill: Yeah, but this has gone on way too long, Justin. I mean, at the very least, Liam should have picked up a phone and let me know what he's thinking.",
        "Justin: This text pretty much says what he's thinking, doesn't it? He's happy with Wyatt marrying Steffy, and he wants Wyatt back at Spencer in his old job.",
        "Bill: I don't buy that. That's a total 180 from Liam. He's just gonna hand Steffy over? To his half-brother, no less? Come on. Those two have been competing from day one -- for women, for jobs.",
        "Justin: And their father's affection and attention.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Look, I have kept myself in check with regard to getting involved in Liam's personal affairs. If he wants to go find himself, have at it. But what he doesn't get to do is cut himself off indefinitely from all the people who love and care about him.",
        "Justin: Well, he hasn't exactly cut himself off, not totally, anyway. He's been in contact and touched base with you and Steffy.",
        "Bill: Touching base isn't good enough anymore, Justin. I am worried about my son. I want you to go over his paper trail with a fine-toothed comb. I want to know where Liam is and what he's up to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Seagulls calling]",
        "Steffy: Okay, wait. I didn't hear that right.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Steffy: You want to hang out with your mom on our honeymoon?",
        "Wyatt: No! It -- yeah, I mean, it's not like that.",
        "Steffy: 'Cause I'm not living with that. At all.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, I-I think you're overreacting a little -- really?",
        "Steffy: I'm kidding!",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] How --",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: No, but seriously, can I go for like a tiny bit? Just a little bit.",
        "Steffy: I mean, as long as you make it up to me when you get back.",
        "Wyatt: I can totally do that.",
        "Steffy: Good.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I don't deserve you.",
        "Steffy: No, you don't.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: But I think I'll score some points with your mom if I let you see her one last time before she leaves.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I mean, I just -- I don't want her leaving town without meeting this guy who -- who somehow has her on her best behavior, you know?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. I mean, I totally get that. She has been more mellow. But I totally understand that you want to meet him.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Steffy: I think he's been a really good influence on her, but he's still a mystery. And then once you see him face to face, that will be an eye opener.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Where did you find it?",
        "Liam: Is this from you? Is this a gift to me?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] What does it matter?",
        "Liam: Well, I'd like to know.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. It was a gift, but you never really liked it, and you barely wore it, so I put it away.",
        "Liam: Are you keeping other things from me?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckling] Oh, Adam, for heaven's sake --",
        "Liam: Well, no. Would you -- would you tell me if you were?",
        "Quinn: Uh, uh, uh... you're asking a lot of questions again.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I am. Is that a problem?",
        "Quinn: Well, I mean, it's only a problem if it's gonna upset you, especially as we're about to embark on this -- on this whole, new adventure. The necklace, is it... is it bringing up any memories? Are you -- are you remembering anything specific?",
        "Liam: What if I am?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Seagulls calling]",
        "Wyatt: All right, well, I won't be long.",
        "Steffy: Maybe you should tell your mom, tell her you're on the way.",
        "Wyatt: Why would I do that? That would ruin the whole element of surprise.",
        "Steffy: Why would that -- oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, if she knows that you're coming, then she'll probably --",
        "Wyatt: Exactly. I don't want her to prep or put on a show. She's been so secretive about this guy, like who he is and what he's like. The only thing I know is that his name is Adam, and I don't even think that's his real name.",
        "Steffy: You know what would be really funny?",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Steffy: If Adam was actually Deacon.",
        "Wyatt: Ohh! Right?",
        "Steffy: I know.",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. She says it's not. But who knows? I mean, you know how she can be.",
        "Steffy: She's like her own worst enemy. I get it. I know.",
        "Wyatt: I'm hoping that's in the past, but I just -- I got to meet this guy for myself. You know what I mean?",
        "Steffy: Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Steffy: You know you're a really good son?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I'm a good husband, too. And I'm an even better kisser.",
        "Steffy: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: I'm gonna get some of those juices, too.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: When I come back. And we'll get our boards and we'll go.",
        "Steffy: Hurry back! Love you, husband!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I thought you put that thing away. Hey, sweetheart, listen to me. Come on. I know you're frustrated trying to remember your past, but looking at those photo albums over and over again and now this necklace? I mean, how is that making anything better?",
        "Liam: It's like you don't even want me to remember.",
        "Quinn: Of course, I do. And -- and you will! It -- hey. Trying to force things hasn't really worked out for you, has it? I mean, all it's ever done is just -- it's -- it's made you upset, which is why this move is gonna be so beneficial, because you can be relaxed, right, and -- and -- and not stressed out about your past. And then maybe then the floodgates will open in time.",
        "Liam: I don't have time! You understand? I feel like... [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Liam: I don't know. Sometimes I-I feel like you're trying to mollify me, like the last thing you want is -- is for me to ask a question, God forbid. And yet that's crazy, right? 'Cause you're my wife, and you love me, and I know that.",
        "Quinn: I am. I do everything I have done, everything I'm doing, is for you. For us. My family. I know that you're anxious about this move. I totally understand that. But everything is gonna be fine. I promise you.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] But how can you promise me that when --",
        "Quinn: Hey, hey, hey. Look at where we are. Come on. We're in this room, right, where we reconnected. You know? This -- this trip is about continuing that reconnection, so maybe what we need to do is give this room a proper goodbye.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Come on. For your wife. Come on. It's okay. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Liam: For me?",
        "Bill: Open it.",
        "Liam: Oh. Wow, Dad.",
        "Bill: I know how you feel about the sword, Liam. But you need to understand something. You're my son. William Spencer III.",
        "Bill: It would be my honor to stand up for you.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Ah! I'm so proud of you.",
        "Bill: What'd you find out?",
        "Justin: No ATM transactions, no credit-card expenses, no travel reservations.",
        "Bill: What about online purchases?",
        "Justin: Yeah, I know. I'm as surprised as you. He's been gone quite awhile. There should definitely be a trail.",
        "Bill: But why isn't there, Justin?! I mean, my son can't just have vanished!",
        "Justin: Bill, you don't know where this retreat is?",
        "Bill: If I knew where it was, I would be there, wouldn't I?! Damn it! What the hell has happened to my son?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Mom?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: Liam? What are you doing? Mom? Have you lost your mind? What is going on here? Like, have you been here, Liam, this whole time?!",
        "Liam: What did you call me? What did he call -- what did he call me? Who -- who are you?",
        "Wyatt: Liam. Come on, man. It's -- it's me. Wh-- what have you done to him? Oh, my God. Mom, what has happened here? Mom!"
