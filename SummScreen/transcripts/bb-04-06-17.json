{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7559 ~ Shirley finds a new and innovative way to get Coco to unknowingly wear a camera at Forrester Creations; Thomas becomes defensive when Steffy chides him about taking Sally to her wedding."], "Recap": ["Sally tells Shirley that she does not need a break. She needs to keep working on this design. Shirley looks at Coco and tells her she needs a serious piece of jewelry in the hallowed halls of FC. She gives her a flashy brooch and tells her to run along but pay as much attention to her work as that young man over there. Sally does not understand why Shirley thinks Spectra's and Forrester's cannot get along. Zende laments to Nicole that RJ is not the only one with a Spectra on his mind. Sally went all the way to Australia to be with Thomas. He does not want them to be hurt if they are taking advantage of the situation. It seems like a very big coincidence and they can't be too careful. Steffy tells Thomas, RJ, Zende and Nicole that her dad is throwing himself back into work and shows them his latest design. She wants no one else to know about it. Thomas tells Steffy that Sally posed no problem. She did not post any pictures from the wedding. He may have pushed the button but he did not invite her to cause problems. He really likes her. She tells him they cannot be too careful. Shirley tells Sally that she should be setting an example for her sister. Thomas is a Forrester and she is a Spectra, a disaster. And she explains that Sally's designs are okay but they do not compete with these \u0096 showing her some of the Forrester designs ..genuine originals, soon to be transformed into Spectra Designs. Coco has a front row seat to all the action. If Sally wants to get back to the Spectra roots that is what they are doing.", "RJ runs into Coco while he is holding the new Ridge designs and he says he is on the way to the vault but he trusts her and he proudly shows them to her. Thanks to Coco's brooch Shirley and crew see it all on the laptop and she says no one is the wiser, not even her sister. So she does not want Sally to have that sour face and pull out on her now. Nicole tells Zende that he is protective of his family and she loves that about him, but she likes Coco and thinks it is all right. RJ tells Coco that he is disappointed in his mom and dad but he will be okay. He gives her a quick kiss. On the laptop Sally sees it too and asks Shirley it off. Steffy tells Thomas that he is one terrific guy and she wants him to be as happy as she is, but she just thinks that he deserves better than Sally Spectra. Sally tells Shirley that it sounds like she thinks she is doing something good for giving to the working class. Thomas will never speak to her again when he finds out about this and she is sure in the end he will. Saul comes in and shows them the Ridge designs with a few of his changes. Shirley says these are great and will be a big hit especially when they can get theirs out first. They will all go down with the ship unless they do this. She tells Sally to buckle up. They will ride this all the way to the bank."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Nicole: So, how was it?", "Steffy: The wedding and the honeymoon was really... really beautiful and really, really romantic.", "Nicole: And you came in on a zipline.", "Steffy: Yeah. Thanks to ivy. Honestly, thank you so much. I wouldn't have been able to do this without you.", "Ivy: Well, I just wanted to give you the thrill of a lifetime.", "Steffy: Mission accomplished.", "Thomas: Well, it's too bad it didn't work out that way for dad and Brooke.", "Steffy: Yeah. R.J., I'm really sorry.", "R.J.: Me, too.", "Nicole: I can't believe Ridge and Brooke didn't get married.", "R.J.: Hey, we're still a family. Nothing's changed.", "Thomas: Hear that, Stef? You did say I could bring a date.", "Steffy: A date? Um, Sally Spectra? Really?", "Nicole: I heard she ended up in the water.", "Steffy: She sure did.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: Sis, you've been working nonstop since you got back from Australia.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: I'm trying to keep this company afloat.", "Shirley: [Scoffs] You need to take a break!", "Sally: This collection is not going to design itself, grams! I know I can do this! I'm not gonna let one bad review crush my confidence.", "Saul: Yeah! What does Jarrett Maxwell know, anyway?", "Sally: I need to get back on the horse.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: Well, pushing yourself isn't the best way to get the creative juices flowing.", "Shirley: Whoa! Listen to you! You seem to be learning a lot over there at Forrester creations.", "Coco: Oh, speaking of which, I have to get going.", "Shirley: Wait, is that what you're wearing?", "Coco: What's wrong with it?", "Shirley: You know what, you need to gussy it up a little bit. Especially if you're gonna be walking those hallowed halls. Here.", "Coco: Oh, it's a broach!", "Shirley: Mm-hmm! Yeah, if you want to be taken seriously, then you need to wear a serious piece of jewelry.", "Coco: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Okay, enough about my wedding and Sally Spectra.", "Thomas: Wait, wait, wait. You didn't call this meeting to bask in our congratulations?", "Steffy: Ha, ha, ha! No. Apparently dad is throwing himself back into work. I have his latest design. I think it's the best he's ever done.", "Thomas: Not wrong about that.", "Ivy: Wow.", "Steffy: Dad wants to use this one for the showstopper.", "Zende: No question.", "Nicole: It's stunning.", "Steffy: Which is why I don't want anyone to know about it. I don't want to harp on security, but with the Spectras' presence, I don't think I have to remind you that --", "Thomas: You don't, Stef. We get it. It's fine.", "Steffy: This stays in the vault, and it only comes out when the cutters need it, okay?", "R.J.: I'll take it.", "Steffy: Great.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: I think we should have Charlie do it. He does security, so...", "R.J.: I'm heading there now. It's not a big deal.", "Zende: Look, you have a lot of responsibility around here now. You have to be careful, R.J., With work and with your friends.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: Don't fiddle with it.", "Coco: It looks all right?", "Shirley: Like a million bucks.", "Saul: Might be just the piece that holds everything together.", "Shirley: So, tell us. You're learning a lot there at Forrester, getting to know your way around?", "Coco: Mm-hmm, yeah, R.J.'S really been showing me the ropes. I get to witness the entire process, from sketch to runway.", "Sally: Well, those Forrester boys are real gentlemen, aren't they?", "Shirley: Just make sure that you're paying as much attention to your work as you are to that young man.", "Coco: Right.", "Shirley: Okay. You run along now. Learn as much as you can.", "Coco: All right. Bye, guys!", "Shirley: Bye-bye!", "Sally: Well, I think my little sister has a crush.", "Saul: I think you both think about those Forresters way too much.", "Shirley: I agree. You seem to forget who you are, Sally, and I can guarantee you, the Forresters do not. What ever made you think that our families could get along?", "Sally: Really? You think it's crazy that a guy like Thomas could care for me? Well, maybe we're crazy for thinking that we can steal from him and his family!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: So, this is how it is? Now that we're married, I have to work to get my husband's attention?", "Zende: Oh, you want to work? Okay. Well, work then! [Chuckles]", "Nicole: What were you thinking about?", "Zende: R.J.", "Nicole: I know. He was really hoping that Ridge and Brooke would get married.", "Zende: Yeah, but while they were gone, he was getting pretty close to one intern in particular.", "Nicole: It's kind of cute.", "Zende: Maybe, if Coco's last name wasn't Spectra. Look, don't get me wrong. She seems nice, eager, and motivated. But she's not the only Spectra we have to worry about getting close to our family. Sally was at Steffy's wedding. I wasn't even at Steffy's wedding! She went all the way to Australia because Thomas wanted her to be his date.", "Nicole: I guess eager and motivated run in the family.", "Zende: Not exactly the family trait I was thinking about. Look, I am very familiar with the history. The Spectras have taken advantage of Forrester creations. I don't know want it to happen again, especially not to R.J.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: Oh!", "Coco: Oh! R.J. Hi!", "R.J.: Hi.", "Coco: Um, I was hoping to run into you -- not literally.", "R.J.: Almost.", "Coco: So, uh, how were things with your parents the other day?", "R.J.: Oh, um, you haven't heard. They, uh -- they didn't get married.", "Coco: Really?", "R.J.: Yeah. I was surprised, too. I thought that's what they wanted.", "Coco: Yeah, you were so excited for them.", "R.J.: I know they love each other. My dad was ready, but... my mom said no. Something happened, but they didn't tell me what. It messed everything up.", "Coco: I'm really sorry, R.J. Are you okay?", "R.J.: I'm fine. I'm even better now that you're here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Thomas, you must have known that bringing Sally Spectra along was gonna cause some problems.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: It didn't.", "Steffy: Bringing Sally was a problem.", "Thomas: Why, Stef? She didn't use it for publicity. She didn't take any pictures. She respected the fact that it was a private ceremony. She didn't post anything anywhere. She even offered to leave when she knew it was gonna upset you.", "Steffy: She wasn't invited. I don't understand -- how do you not get this, Thomas? Really.", "Thomas: Okay, Stef, you're right. I may have been pushing it a little bit, but I didn't bring her to mess with you.", "Steffy: I know.", "Thomas: It's different. I -- I like her.", "Steffy: I know you like her. I know you wouldn't have brought Sally to my wedding if you didn't care for her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: You should be setting an example for your sister.", "Sally: Hello! Look at this work ethic!", "Shirley: Mm. Yes, I guess hard work is a heck of a lot more reliable than that pie-in-the-sky romance with prince charming.", "Sally: Why can't I have both?", "Shirley: Oh, Sally, honey, it's just not in the cards for you. It never has been. Your parents dumped you, and every rotten boyfriend you've ever had.", "Sally: Thomas isn't rotten.", "Shirley: He is a Forrester. You are a Spectra. That combination can only lead to disaster and tragedies!", "Saul: Not another disaster!", "Shirley: I am trying to prevent one! [Sighs] We've got shifty breathing down our necks, C.J. has never had confidence in us... all we have is each other!", "Saul: And these.", "Shirley: [Sighs] Sally, honey, your designs are so good. They're outrageous and unique. But they can't compare to these.", "Sally: Wow. They're beautiful and elegant and classy and refined. Where did you get these? Grams...", "Shirley: You know where we got them. These are genuine Forrester originals, soon to be transformed into Spectra designs.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I understand your concerns about Coco.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: I just think it's a weird coincidence. You've got R.J. And Coco. There's Thomas and Sally... you heard what Steffy said. It doesn't hurt to be extra careful with so many Spectras in the mix.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I think I have reason to be concerned.", "Thomas: Because I actually like Sally?", "Steffy: I know you're getting in deeper with Sally.", "Thomas: I enjoy her company. She makes me laugh.", "Steffy: So, you're just having fun with her? I thought you weren't that guy anymore.", "Thomas: I'm not. Does that bother you, too?", "Steffy: In context, yeah. It's like what Zende said to R.J. You need to be careful.", "Thomas: Because sally's a Spectra.", "Steffy: Yeah, because sally's a Spectra. She's guilty by name, guilty by association, and I just don't want history repeating itself.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: Before you went to Australia, we had a plan -- use Coco as our spy -- but she didn't want anything to do with it.", "Saul: So, as you know, even though it was a tough decision, we gave Coco that necklace with the camera planted inside.", "Sally: That broach... more cameras?", "Shirley: Coco goes about her day as a busy little Forrester intern and we have a front-row seat to the whole thing!", "Saul: Coco has access to everything, and she's been all over the building, to cutting rooms and executive offices.", "Shirley: And we need to spruce this place up. Do you know that they have stained-glass windows there?", "Sally: Grams!", "Shirley: Oh, relax. I know you weren't big on the plan, but coco's innocent. She has no idea that she's saving our butts! You wanted to get back to our Spectra roots, that's what we're doing. Come see for yourself.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: Well, I probably should be getting back to the mail.", "R.J.: Right. Right. I got to put this in the vault.", "Coco: It must be important, then. Is it a design?", "R.J.: Oh, my dad's latest. Could be our next showstopper.", "Coco: Ooh! Must be something.", "R.J.: It really is. I probably shouldn't show it to you.", "Coco: Yeah, don't.", "R.J.: But you're here to learn. That's what interns do.", "Coco: I don't know...", "R.J.: I trust you.", "Coco: R.J.", "R.J.: It's cool, huh?", "Coco: Yeah, that's beautiful.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: It's gorgeous. Completely original.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Saul: Groundbreaking.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: And it's all ours.", "[Camera shutter clicks]", "Shirley: Okay, Saul baby, you're on. I've sent it to your computer. Go out there and work your magic with that fancy app or whatever it is and turn that picture into a sketch of the latest Spectra masterpiece. [Giggles] [Sighs] You see how easy that was, Sally? And no one is the wiser. Not even your little sister! Oh, do not give me that face. We have too much riding on this. Do not go soft on me now, Sally Spectra!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I spent some time with Coco. She seems all right.", "Zende: Look, I'm not saying she's not a nice person. It's just -- trust is something you have to earn, and she just hasn't been here long enough.", "Nicole: You're protective of your family, and I love that about you. But Steffy and Ridge can keep an eye on the Spectras. My husband and I have better things to do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: Hey! How's mail sorting?", "Coco: I'm almost done. All locked up?", "R.J.: Safe and sound.", "Coco: I can't wait to see the finished product.", "R.J.: It's gonna be the hit of the show.", "Coco: Yeah! Your dad's an amazing designer.", "R.J.: He's able to throw himself in his work, especially when things aren't going his way.", "Coco: Right. I'm sorry your parents' wedding didn't happen.", "R.J.: I'm disappointed, but what can I do?", "Coco: Yeah, I think you're handling this really well.", "R.J.: I can't get wrapped up in their stuff. Especially when great things are happening to me.", "Coco: [Chuckles]", "R.J.: I know we haven't known each other long, but... I'm really happy you're in my life, Coco.", "Coco: Me, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Okay, that's enough. Turn it off. Did you see the way that he looked at her? I am not ruining this for Coco. We are not doing this, grams. I won't steal from Thomas and his family.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: I appreciate your concern, Stef. I just don't share it.", "Steffy: At least we're not fighting about it.", "Thomas: Not today.", "Steffy: I'm really glad that you came to my wedding, Thomas.", "Thomas: I am, too. I am. And I know you and Liam are gonna be really happy together.", "Steffy: Thanks.", "Thomas: This is the part where you say \"I'm gonna be really happy when you find someone...\"", "Steffy: Yeah, of course! Of course, Thomas. Of course. You're an amazing guy. Any woman would be lucky to date you. I just... I think you deserve better than Sally Spectra.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: It's Thomas, isn't it? That's why you're getting cold feet!", "Sally: Prison is giving me cold feet, grams. Stealing is a crime!", "Shirley: Sally, it is the fashion business! My sister did it for years! She never went to jail! You tweak a little here, you tweak a little there, then deny, deny, and -- poof! -- You've got you've got your own special line. We are going to take the Forresters' style and make it into something everyone can afford.", "Sally: You make it sound like we're doing something good.", "Shirley: We're giving beauty and elegance to the masses. There is nothing wrong with that! You know what is wrong? The Forresters who just give to the one-percenters. We are giving style and glamour to the working stiffs just like my sister did. And we're gonna do it before someone else does!", "Sally: Okay. Let 'em. And you know what? They can take the rap for it, too.", "Shirley: Saul has the sewing machines greased up and ready to go! We are not gonna let your crush on superhero Forrester stop us!", "Sally: After everything that Thomas has done for us? And the way that they welcomed Coco?", "Shirley: [Scoffs] Coco is living in a dream world, and so are you! It is time for that bubble to burst! It's gonna blow up at one point anyway. We might as well make a few bucks before it does!", "Sally: I was just trying to rebuild the legacy.", "Shirley: Our legacy? You think the Forresters respect us? They're nothing but Beverly Hills elitists.", "Sally: That is not who they are! Brooke Logan started off catering at the Forrester estate and now look where she is. Thomas will never speak to me again if he finds out that I did this.", "Shirley: I never should have sent you to Australia. You've come back a lovesick puppy! I raised you and your sister to be tougher. I made an investment in you. I came all the way to the golden state to cash in. I will not be dumped for Mr. Muscles now.", "Sally: I'm just trying to make you see --", "Saul: We got it. Ridge Forrester's latest design with some changes.", "Shirley: Oh! It's glorious. This collection is gonna save our butts.", "Sally: People are gonna know that they're knockoffs.", "Shirley: Not if we show them first. Listen to me. You're gonna have a ton of men in your life, but you're only gonna have one grandmother, a grams who loves you like a mother, who's always looked out for you, and that's what I'm doing now -- looking out for you. If we don't do this, we're gonna go down -- Darlita, Saul, Coco, you, me. We're all going down with the ship. Unless we do this. Is that what you want? I refuse to let that happen. Your feelings for Thomas Forrester are not gonna stop us, so buckle up, little girl. We are taking this ride all the way to the bank."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXERuUWOWHo"}
