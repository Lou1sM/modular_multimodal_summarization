    "Recap": [
        "Carter tells Rick that he won't believe this. Maya tries to stop him and Carter says if she doesn't tell him he will. He needs to know. Brooke pours Wyatt a lemonade and he says he could not live with himself if he had not told his mother about Deacon. He still does not trust him. He owes his mother the truth if he is still in love with Brooke. Quinn tells Deacon that she thinks Deacon is panicking. He declares what he said to Brooke meant nothing. She says okay then now is the time for him to be a big boy and say it to her face how he really feels about old Quinn. There is no way in hell that she is going to marry him if there is the slightest doubt he still loves Brooke. Bill tells Katie that maybe Rick is having second thoughts about Caroline and she wants him back over Ridge. Maya breaks up a shouting match between Rick and Carter with Carter saying he will not shut up. Rick has the right to know this. Ridge hears and comes in. No Rick will not hear this. He wants Carter out and accuses him of still pining away for Maya. Rick tells Carter to get out and find his own woman. He won't find one like Maya but he is free to look. He apologizes to Maya for her having to put up with that.",
        "Wyatt tells Brooke that he is not trying to start something here. Brooke tells him that his mother is highly unstable and Deacon should not be marrying her. Deacon pleads his case to Quinn and says what he feels for Brooke is not even close to what he has with Quinn. He begs her to pick a date and let them do this. Instead she leaves. Maya flies into Carter's office and says she will not let him talk to Rick. It is not his business. She is a woman even though her body said she was once a man. She's lived with this crap all her life and she will not put up with it from Carter. Bill tells Liam and Katie that Caroline will be fine, it is Brooke they should be worried about. She is hitting the bottle and has turned to Deacon. And that is the last person she should be messing with. Deacon visits Wyatt and says he just had to put his nose in it and now Quinn may do something they will all regret. Quinn recalls her daydream about stabbing Brooke in the tummy. Then she knocks on Brooke's door and tells her she should have known by now not to mess with her. Brooke is not scared but Quinn says she ought to be. Maya tells Carter that she will not be bullied. She will tell Rick when she is ready and that is when he proposes. Carter offers that she has not told him for all these months so he does not believe she will now. Ridge realizes Rick is not listening to him at all and says he has no time for this. Rick rants that he is really mad at Carter and for saying that he knows Maya better than Rick does. Quinn tells Brooke that she is engaged to Deacon and they are going to be married and there is nothing Brooke can do to stop that. She takes her relationships seriously. Deacon is taken. She can find herself another new AA partner, understood? Rick asks why Ridge even cares. None of them like Maya but Carter is jealous and on some sort of tirade. He is going to set him straight right now. Carter tells Maya that she is naive. All have been duped. Rick will not risk losing his country club rights and prestige around the world for Maya's secret. She tells him if he tells Rick that she will have him fired. Carter says go ahead as when he tells Rick, she will have no power. Rick charges in and tells them to stop. He wants to hear it all right now, whatever it is."

        "Carter: You won't believe it when I tell you.",
        "Rick: Tell me what?",
        "Maya: Carter --",
        "Carter: He needs to know. If you won't tell him, I will.",
        "Rick: What? What do you want to say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, what exactly does she mean by \"nice\"?",
        "Liam: According to Caroline, Rick is being cordial -- dare I say, \"polite\"?",
        "Bill: Is the divorce final?",
        "Katie: Not yet.",
        "Bill: I rest my case.",
        "Katie: You mean that's why he's being nice?",
        "Liam: I wouldn't trust him.",
        "Katie: I wouldn't, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Telling Quinn was a mistake. God only knows how she's going to react.",
        "Wyatt: I couldn't live with myself, keeping something like that from her.",
        "Brooke: You overreacted. Deacon and I were just speaking hypothetically.",
        "Wyatt: Deacon said that you told him that if he wasn't engaged, he could have another shot with you, that you could start over. Was that not what was said?",
        "Brooke: He also said how good Quinn is for him and how much she's changed and how much he loves her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were panicking.",
        "Deacon: I don't want to be with Brooke. Quinn, I want to be with you!",
        "Quinn: Then why did you say to Brooke that you --",
        "Deacon: It was a stupid, throwaway comment! It didn't mean anything!",
        "Quinn: \"Oh, gee, Brooke. You know what? Maybe you and I could be together if I wasn't tied to old Quinn.\" Well, you know what? If that's how you feel, now's your chance to be a big boy and say it to my face!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You know how dangerous Quinn can be.",
        "Wyatt: She's not gonna come after you.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I've heard that before, and then I ended up on the ground.",
        "Wyatt: And I'm sorry she hit you.",
        "Brooke: You can't control her. Nobody can -- not even Deacon.",
        "Wyatt: But she has a right to know if her fianc\u00e9 is up to no good. That's all I'm saying.",
        "Brooke: Nothing is going on between Deacon and me. He made it very clear that he wants to honor his commitment to your mother.",
        "Wyatt: That's what he says, but deep down, I believe that he's still in love with you.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: So, being with Brooke is, what, some \"what if\" fantasy?",
        "Deacon: I'm not waiting for that to happen, if that's what you think.",
        "Quinn: So then why even say it? Why is it an idea in your head?",
        "Deacon: I was repeating what she said! Quinn, listen to me! My future's with you. You are who I want to spend my life with.",
        "Quinn: I thought that, too. I really believed that, Deacon.",
        "Deacon: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Quinn: Well, you talk a big game about wanting to be my husband. But there is no way in Hell that I am going to marry you... if you're even the slightest bit in love with Brooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You know, Caroline has a thousand good qualities. Taste in men is not one of them.",
        "Katie: Well, people could say the same thing about me.",
        "Liam: Oh-ho! Point, Katie.",
        "Bill: Do you like being president? I mean, I'm just asking.",
        "Liam: Very much.",
        "Bill: Good. Then behave yourself.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Bill: Now, what if Rick does want Caroline back?",
        "Liam: I mean, it's possible.",
        "Bill: I mean, I know she's with, uh -- what's his name?",
        "Katie: Ridge. His name is Ridge.",
        "Bill: Right. Ridge. Maybe Rick is having second thoughts about Maya. Maybe he finally realizes who she really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Maya isn't who you think she is.",
        "Rick: I've heard this all before. I'm not interested.",
        "Carter: Listen to me. She is hiding something important from you.",
        "Rick: Will you stop?! I'm not gonna stand here and listen to you bash my girlfriend!",
        "Carter: That's just it! She is not your girlfriend!",
        "Maya: Quiet, Carter!",
        "Carter: I'm not talking to you.",
        "Rick: You watch how you speak to her.",
        "Carter: Rick has a right to know who you --",
        "Maya: Stop it. You stop this right now!",
        "Ridge: Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on in here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You got to wonder if Rick's eyes are finally being opened to Maya.",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't think so. You should have heard him going on and on about how honesty is the most important thing to him. I mean, he certainly wasn't honest to Caroline when he was shacking up with Maya, and he seems to have conveniently forgotten her gold-digging days. He is committed.",
        "Liam: Well, at least that's what he wants everyone to think.",
        "Katie: He says he's very much in love. I think it would take something major to break them up.",
        "Bill: I don't buy it. I mean, not that I'd want it, but Rick would leave Maya high and dry if Caroline snapped her fingers.",
        "Katie: Well, she is still waiting for the divorce to go through.",
        "Liam: I mean, if you ask Caroline, she'll tell you she's very happy with Ridge, that she's ready to move on. So...it kind of seems like Maya is the woman in Rick's life right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Carter and I were just leaving.",
        "Carter: Rick, you need to hear me out on this.",
        "Rick: No. Do you like your job? Then stop this B.S.!",
        "Carter: The person you love is living a --",
        "Rick: Not another word! Do you hear me?!",
        "Ridge: You should let the guy talk.",
        "Rick: You and Maya broke up. Get over it. It's been almost a year. Or are you still, uh -- you still pining away for Maya?",
        "Carter: That's not at all what this is about.",
        "Rick: Oh, sure, it is. Why else would you be so angry? I'll tell you why -- because you haven't found another woman quite like Maya, and that bothers you, doesn't it? There's plenty of other women out there. You want to find one -- none quite as unique and special as Maya, of course. But you can feel free to look. So go on. Go on. Get out of here.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry that you had to put up with that.",
        "Maya: Have your meeting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I'm not trying to instigate anything here.",
        "Brooke: It's not your place to interfere.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Yeah? Well, I could say the same thing for you.",
        "Brooke: You're protecting your mother, and I'm protecting my daughter's father. But Deacon should not be with Quinn, let alone marrying her. I'm sorry, Wyatt, but your mother's highly unstable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: What can I do to prove it to you?! Tell me! I'll do anything it takes!",
        "Quinn: Anything?",
        "Deacon: Yes! I want to be with you -- only you!",
        "Quinn: How can that be true when my son heard you daydreaming about a life with Brooke?",
        "Deacon: Quinn, we share a daughter together. On some level, yes, I am probably always gonna care about Brooke. But it doesn't compare to how I feel about you!",
        "Quinn: You know what? I'm not gonna spend my life second-guessing!",
        "Deacon: But, baby, you won't have to. I am 100% committed to this relationship.",
        "Quinn: Tell that to Brooke.",
        "Deacon: I have! I will! I'll do whatever you want! Listen to me, please. Just pick a date! Pick a date and let's do this! Let's get married, Quinn!",
        "Quinn: I have to clear my head. I need to get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carter's flashbacks]",
        "Carter: To looking forward.",
        "Maya: I just got cast as a lead in a web series with you as my partner?!",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Carter: Spicy enough for you?",
        "Maya: Mmm. I don't know. I might need another taste. You have some right...",
        "Carter: Will you marry... me?",
        "Maya: Yes.",
        "[Present time]",
        "Maya: How...dare you?!",
        "Carter: There is nothing you can say to me.",
        "Maya: You were going to tell Rick.",
        "Carter: Yeah, I was. He has a right to know, Maya. Or should I say, \"Myron\"?",
        "Maya: Don't you disrespect me! You think I haven't had to deal with enough crap like this in my life?!",
        "Carter: It's your choice.",
        "Maya: No, it was not my choice! This is who I am! I have never been a man, no matter what my body looked like!",
        "Carter: Fine. It's not a secret I can let you keep any longer.",
        "Maya: That's not your business! And if you had any kind of compassion or empathy, you wouldn't do this!",
        "Carter: Empathy? You lied to me. You used to be a man.",
        "Maya: I am a woman! And I will not stand for this! Do you understand me?! You will not say one word to Rick. I won't let that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: All right. You know what? Caroline's gonna be fine. I think it's Brooke that we should be worried about.",
        "Liam: What's the latest on that?",
        "Katie: She finally admitted that she's been having a problem.",
        "Liam: With the -- the drinking?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Liam: Oh, man.",
        "Bill: Yeah. And of all people she's turning to, it's the mugshot.",
        "Liam: Deacon?!",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, the shipment is stuck in customs. There's nothing I can do. Okay. Well, as soon as I hear something, I'll let you know, then. All right. Thanks.",
        "Deacon: You just had to open your mouth, didn't you?",
        "Wyatt: My loyalty's with my mother, not with you.",
        "Deacon: Yeah? Well, you may have lit a match under a powder keg, kid.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, what is that supposed to mean?!",
        "Deacon: What it means is you just gave Quinn another reason to hate Brooke! Let's hope that she doesn't do something that we're gonna all wind up regretting!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Quinn's flashback]",
        "Brooke: [Gasps]",
        "Quinn: I told you to stay away from Deacon.",
        "Brooke: Look, I don't know what Wyatt told you.",
        "Quinn: You should have listened to me, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: [Gasps]",
        "[Present time]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] I'm sure you know why I'm here.",
        "Brooke: If you lay one hand on me, I will call the police this time.",
        "Quinn: How dare you lead Deacon on -- make him think that he has some chance with you if he wasn't engaged with me?",
        "Brooke: Is that so hard to believe?",
        "Quinn: You are manipulating his feelings to try and break us up.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Okay. Whatever you say, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Haven't you learned by now not to mess with me?",
        "Brooke: Do I look scared to you?",
        "Quinn: Keep going with this, Brooke, and, trust me, you will be -- you'll be very scared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: And that's why I sent you the e-mail. Caroline designed this before she left for New York. It's modern, and it's fresh.",
        "Rick: Ridge, I like the concept.",
        "Ridge: Ah, good! I'm happy, 'cause it's a showstopper.",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: Let me ask you something. Did you look at the billboards?",
        "Rick: I don't think so.",
        "Ridge: No? Oh, look. It's right here. We're going big -- Wilshire, Sunset. It's gonna be silver with black beads, sequins -- what Forrester used to be, bit of a throwback. Am I boring you right now?",
        "Rick: What?! No!",
        "Ridge: 'Cause you're not listening to a word I'm saying, and I don't have time for that.",
        "Rick: Hey, Ridge, I got it -- sequins. Beads.",
        "Ridge: Don't patronize me. What is it with you? What is it? Did Carter upset you? There's something -- he irritated you? What?",
        "Rick: Yeah. As a matter of fact, Carter is irritating me. He's telling me he knows Maya better than I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: You can't keep me from talking to Rick.",
        "Maya: Let me tell him in my own time.",
        "Carter: When? You've been with him this long. You're together, living in that house. When do you plan on telling him?",
        "Maya: When I'm ready.",
        "Carter: No.",
        "Maya: We are devoted to each other. He will love me no matter what.",
        "Carter: Then tell him. Oh, yeah, wait -- you're waiting for a proposal. Get the ring, hook him, then be honest.",
        "Maya: The Rick I know will accept me for the woman that I am.",
        "Carter: Then call him in here! Why are you waiting this long? I mean, he does deserve the truth, right?",
        "Maya: Of course he does!",
        "Carter: You're too scared to do it. What if he rejects you?",
        "Maya: Stop pressuring me, Carter. I will not be bullied by you! I will tell Rick on my terms, when he proposes.",
        "Carter: It won't come to that. There is no way I'm letting you keep this from Rick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Look, the last thing Brooke needs is to be tangled up with Deacon.",
        "Liam: I think she could do a little better, no?",
        "Katie: Well, then there's Quinn.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Does she know about the fact that Brooke is hanging out with her fianc\u00e9?",
        "Katie: For my sister's sake, I hope not.",
        "Bill: There's no telling what that crackpot will do when someone threatens to take her toy away.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, this isn't a joke. You made a big mistake tattling to your mother.",
        "Wyatt: She deserved to know.",
        "Deacon: She already hit Brooke once. Who's -- who's to say what she'll do now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: There is no way I am letting you interfere in my engagement. Deacon and I are gonna get married, and there isn't anything you can do or say to stop it.",
        "Brooke: We'll see.",
        "Quinn: I have been interested in two men my entire life -- Bill and Deacon. I take my relationships very seriously, unlike you, who's had so many marriages and affairs and children, you can't even count! Deacon is taken. You will no longer reach out to him, he will no longer be your friend, and you go find yourself a new AA partner. Understood?!",
        "Brooke: Or what?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I'm seriously losing patience with that guy.",
        "Ridge: There's a shocker. Rick's overreacting.",
        "Rick: No. Carter keeps going on about -- about how I don't know who Maya is and how she's conning me and \"blah, blah, blah.\" And what do you care?! All of you just keep on dissing Maya, but you need to accept her for who she is, because she's the woman I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.",
        "Ridge: I think we're all painfully aware of that.",
        "Rick: Yeah? Then why doesn't Carter give it a rest?",
        "Ridge: Well, does Carter still like Maya? Is that what's going on?",
        "Rick: Then why is he on some sort of tirade?",
        "Ridge: I don't know!",
        "Rick: I'll tell you why -- because he's jealous! You're all jealous! There's no other explanation!",
        "Ridge: Oh, God, please.",
        "Rick: I'll tell you what I am gonna do. I am gonna go set that guy straight. I'm gonna set him straight right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: It's no secret Rick and I haven't always seen eye to eye, but after knowing what I know now, we have a lot more in common than he realizes. We've both been duped by you.",
        "Maya: Nobody was duped. He'll understand.",
        "Carter: You really think Rick will forgive you for not being honest all this time? Are you that naive? This is the Forrester family we're talking about -- country clubs, reputations around the world. Rick won't risk losing that because of you.",
        "Maya: They work in fashion. They're a lot more accepting and open-minded than most people, including you.",
        "Carter: You never gave me a chance to be open-minded. What about the scandal? You think about that -- how it'll affect the business, your career, Rick's?",
        "Maya: There is a very powerful LGBT community who will applaud the Forresters for accepting me.",
        "Carter: Fine. That's your attitude. But will it be Rick's? Let's find out.",
        "Maya: You say one word to Rick, and I will do everything in my power to make sure you're fired.",
        "Carter: You won't have any power.",
        "Maya: Try it. You go against my wishes, tell Rick, I guarantee you - you are out of here!",
        "Rick: Hey! Enough! Whatever the Hell this is... it's time to get it out in the open. You're telling me there's something that I need to know, something that we have in common. Obviously, it's about Maya. So, you better tell me, because I would really like to know."
