        "Sally tells Shirley that she knows these are Forrester designs and she does not want to use them. Shirley says she just does not want to risk losing Thomas. But she gets Saul to tell what he knows about Thomas. Saul admits that he has a baby with Caroline Spencer. So there is no need to protect him or his image. Sally does not want to believe this as she thinks she knows Thomas better than that. Shirley shows her the news on the internet. Sally says he is not the first guy who has a baby and Caroline is in New York so they are not together. Shirley berates her to do this \u0096 break up with Thomas. She owes her that after all she has done for her. Rick, Maya and Nicole all agree they like Coco and can trust her but be cautious as her last name is Spectra. Coco picks up on it later and asks if there is anything she can do as she sees the looks and the stares as she goes down the hall. She assumes it is because her name is Spectra. Maya says she is doing fine but Rick is being protective. She admires Coco's brooch and that prompts Coco to take it off and pin it on Maya for time being. At her laptop, Darlita gets an eyeful as Rick locks the door and takes Maya into his arm and leads her to the couch in the office. But Darlita does not see Maya and thinks it is Coco. Boy can that girl multitask.",
        "Sally invites Thomas for lunch and tells him that she learned something about him today that he never bothered to tell her. It is not that big a deal but she would have thought he would have mentioned having a son. He says yes, he should have but it is not something he is comfortable to talk about and he was waiting for the right moment. She agrees it is no big deal and they are not that serious but whatever they have had is now over. Shirley loves the Forrester designs and Saul says that will keep their boat afloat for a long time. Shirley says yes but Sally has to end things with Thomas. Thomas tells Sally he does not want to end things just when they have started. He will tell her now all she wants to know about his son. He wants her to be part of his son's life, his life. She makes him laugh and he wants to be with her. He cares about her too much and will not let her walk away. When she starts to walk always he grabs her arm and says he loves her, then kisses her."

        "Sally: I want to make it big just as much as you do, Grams, but these are Forrester designs. I don't feel right using them.",
        "Shirley: Why? 'Cause, um, you think Tommy boy will kick you to the curb if you do?",
        "Sally: [Sighs]",
        "Shirley: It's gonna happen anyway. Why not get it over with?",
        "Sally: Maybe it won't. Maybe he really likes me.",
        "Shirley: And maybe he just wants to get you into bed.",
        "Sally: He is not that type of guy.",
        "Shirley: You want to know what kind of guy he is? Saul, tell her what kind of guy he is.",
        "Saul: Um... tell her...",
        "Shirley: What we found out about muscles McGee, what we saw online.",
        "Saul: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Right. Well, uh... he has a baby.",
        "Sally: [Chuckles] No, he doesn't.",
        "Shirley: With Caroline Spencer.",
        "Sally: The designer?",
        "Shirley: The designer, the socialite, rich, gorgeous, living it up in a Manhattan high rise. That's the kind of woman Thomas is gonna end up with. You're just the flavor of the month. So we're using these designs, and there's no reason for you to feel bad about it and no reason for you to protect an imaginary relationship with Thomas Forrester.",
        "Coco: [Laughing] That was terrible!",
        "R.J.: What?",
        "Coco: That was a terrible impression!",
        "R.J.: Okay, if \"terrible\" you mean \"brilliant,\" yes. [Chuckles] Well, I mean, if you can do any better.",
        "Thomas: [Clears throat] What's going on here?",
        "R.J.: Oh, hey, man. Coco and I are just taking a break from inventory.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Coco: Okay, uh, I should probably get going. Nicole's waiting on this.",
        "Thomas: It looks like the new girl's working out.",
        "Rick: I don't understand what's going on. I mean, you look like Nicole. You certainly sound like Nicole. But where is that husband of yours? You guys have been connected at the hip ever since the honeymoon, right?",
        "Nicole: Ha ha. Very funny.",
        "Maya: I think it's sweet. They're newlyweds!",
        "Nicole: Newlyweds with day jobs, so sadly, our plan to be together 24/7 isn't panning out.",
        "Maya: Well, that's the fun part of working at a family company. Plenty of chances to see your spouse.",
        "Nicole: This is true. And it's fun to get in everybody's business, you know, your siblings, your cousins, ex-wives.",
        "Rick: [Laughs] Yeah, that tends to happen.",
        "Maya: [Laughs]",
        "Nicole: Like Zende right now. I think -- I think he worries too much, you know, worries about things he doesn't need to worry about.",
        "Maya: Like what?",
        "Nicole: Currently, R.J. And a certain intern.",
        "Maya: Well, I can't say I blame Zende for that.",
        "Nicole: So you're on that bandwagon, too?",
        "Rick: I think we all have a reason to keep our guard up, especially with anyone that has the last name Spectra. So far, so good with Coco. All I'm saying is she's a Spectra...",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Rick: ...And we got to remember that.",
        "Maya: Trust her, but be cautious.",
        "Nicole: All right. I mean, you two be cautious around her if you need to be. I am just going to be a mentor and a friend.",
        "Rick: Yeah, you go ahead and do that. And I'm gonna head down to shipping. I'll be back in a few.",
        "Maya: All right.",
        "Rick: Oh.",
        "Coco: Oh. Hi, Mr. Forrester.",
        "Rick: Hi.",
        "Coco: Hi. Oh, right, I grabbed those old photos from storage for you.",
        "Nicole: Nice work.",
        "Coco: Yes.",
        "Nicole: That was fast.",
        "Coco: Thanks. Thanks. Let me know if you need any help scanning them.",
        "Nicole: How did you know I was gonna scan?",
        "Coco: Hey, you're the one that told me to always anticipate.",
        "Nicole: See, now that's a good sign of an intern. Already implementing my advice.",
        "Thomas: So no regrets hiring Coco?",
        "R.J.: Regrets? You kidding me? She's fitting right in. Super sweet, super -- I mean, super intelligent.",
        "Thomas: Right, right. Kind of cute, though, too.",
        "R.J.: I mean, yeah, if -- if you notice that kind of thing.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, if. Well, it looks like we've got something in common. Forrester men under that Spectra spell.",
        "Sally: You can't believe everything you read on the internet.",
        "Saul: It wasn't just some random blogger. There's even a Forrester press release about it.",
        "Sally: No. No, I know Thomas!",
        "Shirley: Not well enough, obviously.",
        "Coco: Mr. Forrester doesn't seem to like me very much. Is there something I did wrong?",
        "Nicole: Which Mr. Forrester? You know, you can use first names. It just makes it easier.",
        "Coco: Rick. Rick -- he barely looked at me just now. Is there something I could do differently?",
        "Maya: You know, it's not fair, and it's not your fault. But the fact is that you have more to prove than the other interns.",
        "Coco: Because I'm a Spectra? That's why rick won't look at me when I pass him in the hall?",
        "Nicole: He's very protective of the family and the company, and the Spectras and the Forresters have a lot of history.",
        "Coco: I get it. And I don't blame him. And I don't blame any of you for holding me to a higher standard. But I promise I can live up to it.",
        "Thomas: Just be prepared for some reactions.",
        "R.J.: What do you mean?",
        "Thomas: With you and Coco, your interest in her.",
        "R.J.: It's not like I'm broadcasting it.",
        "Thomas: You are, whether you know it or not. My instinct tells me just do what I do, right? I let all the negative comments go in one ear and out the other.",
        "R.J.: Are you talking about when the family says something about you and Sally?",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "R.J.: Wait, does that mean the two of you are...?",
        "Thomas: Oh, we're good.",
        "R.J.: How good?",
        "Thomas: Listen, the woman flew all the way out to Australia to come see me for a wedding. I'd say I'm optimistic about the whole situation. See a lot of potential. Forrester brothers, Spectra sisters. We've got a bright future ahead of us.",
        "R.J.: [Chuckles]",
        "Saul: Oh! Darlita, it is just so wrong.",
        "Darlita: Well, it's not my usual color, but --",
        "Saul: No, not your nails. Sally. This whole situation with Thomas. Sally is about to get her heart broken.",
        "Shirley: See? Right there. He's not even trying to hide it. Well, except from you.",
        "Sally: Okay. All right. You know what? Big whoop. So he has a kid. It wouldn't be the first person in the world to have a child with a woman that he doesn't care about.",
        "Shirley: Not just any woman. That's Caroline Spencer. A famous designer. A gazillionaire. Sweetheart, you think you can compete?",
        "Sally: She lives in new York. She's not even in his life anymore.",
        "Shirley: Honey, the mother of a man's child is always in his life. Thomas is just out here having a few flings with whatever woman catches his eye. His son is growing up in new York with his beautiful, talented mother. It won't be long before Thomas wants to be a part of that. Do you see why we can't change our plans? We have to beat the Forresters to the runway. We've got to make some serious money and make the Spectra name be something again. Sally, you need to get your head on straight. Be loyal to your family. We need those designs. Without them, we don't have a chance. We will go under. Shifty will be calling you up demanding payment. What then? You can't let that happen, not for Thomas Forrester, not for a man with a child in new York with his mother. You need to end that relationship today. Call him up. Tell him you want to meet him.",
        "Sally: I don't know if I can --",
        "Shirley: Sally, do it. After all I've done for you, you owe me. End that relationship with Thomas today.",
        "Saul: Any updates? The feed?",
        "Darlita: I'm supposed to be feeding somebody? What? Like a -- like a pet?",
        "Saul: Watching the feed, Darlita. You said you would keep an eye out.",
        "Darlita: Oh, right! Coco. Uh, I completely forgot. I was painting my nails. You know how that goes.",
        "Saul: Not really, no. So you got this?",
        "Darlita: Yes, I got this.",
        "Saul: If you see anything exciting --",
        "Darlita: Don't worry. My peppers are gonna be glued to the screen.",
        "Saul: Peppers? Peepers.",
        "Darlita: Huh?",
        "Saul: Never mind. I have full confidence in you, Darlita. You and -- and your -- your peppers.",
        "Maya: Coco, I don't want to give you the wrong impression. No one is rooting for you to fail. We want you to succeed.",
        "Coco: I appreciate that.",
        "Maya: That is a lovely brooch, by the way.",
        "Coco: Oh, thank you. Do you want to try it on?",
        "Maya: That's so sweet of you, but no.",
        "Coco: Not at all. I insist. Let's just see how it looks.",
        "Maya: Uh, okay.",
        "Coco: There.",
        "Maya: Thank you. Oh, I love it.",
        "Nicole: Hey, it matches your blouse.",
        "Maya: Did you know Stephanie was known for her brooches? All of a sudden I'm feeling like a Forrester matriarch.",
        "Nicole: Well, don't say that to Quinn.",
        "Maya: Hmm.",
        "Coco: Oh, I have to head out. R.J. Needs to see me.",
        "Maya: Oh, Coco, your brooch.",
        "Coco: Oh, I'll just get it from you later. It looks better on you, anyway.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Maya: Thanks. [Chuckles]",
        "Darlita: Coco is so lucky getting to work with all those Forrester men.",
        "Rick: Well, I guess we're alone.",
        "Maya: Yes.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Where's Coco?",
        "Maya: How about we stop worrying about her? About Coco, about Sally, about anything Spectra?",
        "Rick: Yeah, if you can teach me how to stop worrying, sure.",
        "Maya: Oh, I have a couple ideas.",
        "Rick: Do you?",
        "Maya: Yeah. Lock the door.",
        "Darlita: [Coughing] [Gasps] No!",
        "Darlita: Coco Spectra, what do you think you're doing?!",
        "Shirley: Anything new from Forresters?",
        "Saul: Darlita only just remembered to start watching.",
        "Shirley: What?",
        "Saul: Oh, it's fine, 'cause she's doing it now.",
        "Shirley: She is not the sharpest tool, but [Sighs] She can keep her eyes on a computer screen.",
        "Saul: Sally's the one I'm worried about.",
        "Shirley: You don't have to be, not after today. She's finally wising up and cutting that hunk of Forrester meat loose.",
        "Sally: Thank you.",
        "Thomas: Hey, gorgeous. Glad I got your text.",
        "Sally: Yeah, thanks for meeting with me.",
        "Thomas: Sound so formal. Is this strictly business?",
        "Sally: Well, bucko, we are from competing fashion houses.",
        "Thomas: Ah, yeah. I see how it is. Come on, I'm just playing around. What's going on?",
        "Sally: Yeah, I know. In all sorts of ways, maybe.",
        "Thomas: Okay, what's that supposed to mean?",
        "Sally: Well, I, uh, learned something today.",
        "Thomas: Yeah?",
        "Sally: Something that I thought maybe would have come up in conversation.",
        "Thomas: Okay, what's going on? Just tell me what's bothering you.",
        "Sally: Bothered? Really? Should I -- should I be bothered finding out that you have a kid? I mean, right, it's not -- it's not that big of a deal, right? People have kids. I just thought, I don't know, maybe you would have... mentioned it. Caroline Spencer, huh?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Caroline Spencer. Yeah. I should have said something. I-I don't know why I didn't. I guess I was just waiting for the right moment. It's not exactly something that I'm comfortable talking about. But yeah, with -- with you, I-I just want --",
        "Sally: Save -- save your breath. Really? \"With you?\" Come on. Really? Don't kid yourself. There's nothing serious going on between us. We both know that Caroline is the type of woman that you're supposed to end up with.",
        "Thomas: What are you saying?",
        "Sally: I'm saying that whatever this is between us... it has to end.",
        "Darlita: Coco. Coco, you can't! How can you not? I mean, look at him. Darlita, snap out of it! Help her. Help her.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Coco: Hello?",
        "Darlita: You've got to stop.",
        "Coco: What?",
        "Darlita: Yes. He's gorgeous. I get it. But it's not worth it.",
        "Coco: Darlita? Wait, did you dial the wrong number? This is Coco.",
        "Darlita: How are you even talking to me right now?",
        "Coco: You're the one that called me. What's going on?",
        "Darlita: I have no idea.",
        "Coco: Okay, well, I'm kind of in the middle of something, and I can't really talk right now, so I'm just gonna call you back later.",
        "Darlita: No, wait, but --",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Darlita: How are you -- wow! That girl can multitask.",
        "R.J.: You okay?",
        "Coco: Yeah, I guess. I just had the strangest conversation with Darlita.",
        "R.J.: Who?",
        "Coco: Oh, uh, the receptionist at Spectra.",
        "R.J.: Oh. You're calling Spectra on the clock at Forrester. Now, I'm gonna have to put a stop to that.",
        "Coco: Yeah?",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Coco: How?",
        "R.J.: I don't know.",
        "Shirley: Beautiful.",
        "Saul: The kind of designs that will keep this battleship afloat.",
        "Shirley: More than afloat, Saul. [Sighs] This will have us cruising at 40 knots.",
        "Saul: Well, assuming that Sally stays loyal and doesn't say anything to sir abs-a-lot.",
        "Shirley: She better be saying something to him -- about ending their relationship. Nothing about the designs.",
        "Saul: Do you really think that she will?",
        "Shirley: It's not gonna be easy, but she has to end things with Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Look, I-I wasn't purposely hiding him from you. You would have met him by now if -- if he lived in L.A. and yeah, I should have -- I should have told you about him, and I should have told you about Caroline, and I will if you let me. But I don't want to hear about you trying to end things when we're just getting started.",
        "Sally: Yes, we are just getting started. Okay, it makes this whole thing a whole lot easier. We can just walk away with no hard feelings.",
        "Thomas: Where is all this coming from?",
        "Sally: It's just something that I have to do.",
        "Thomas: Something that you have to do? Wh-why? Because of my son? Douglas is an amazing baby. You will love him. I want you to be a part of his life. I want you to be a part of my life. You came into my world, and you turned it upside down. You make me laugh. I look forward to what you're gonna do, to what you're gonna say, to what -- Sally, to what we are going to do.",
        "Sally: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: And suddenly you want to -- you want to walk away from that. No. No, I care about you too much. I'm not gonna let you walk away.",
