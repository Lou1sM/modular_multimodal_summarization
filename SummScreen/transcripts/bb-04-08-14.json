        "Katie and Ridge lounge in bed. She says she doesn't want things to change and she knows the force is gathering. He says let them; it won't affect them. And sometimes change is good. Ridge pours them some wine. He tells Katie that now that everyone in the family knows and his dad used him as a bargaining chip it will be just a matter of time before the press comes down on them too. He just wants her to be prepared. She says maybe they should hibernate the rest of the year. She definitely doesn't like the fact that he will be working with Brooke but Eric probably figures putting them together will eventually get them back together as he wants. She's surprised as she always thought Eric liked her. Katie says Brooke will get lonely; she always does. Ridge says that won't affect anything. It doesn't matter what Brooke wants. What he wants is right here. Brooke is getting ready for bed. She is brushing her hair when Bill comes flying through her door. He says he wants her back. And she might as well not say no as he is not going anywhere. He ends up brushing her hair and she loves it. He says he will brush it 100 times every night. She fills him in on the day. He's okay with everything until she tells him that she and Ridge will be co-VP's. She doesn't know why he is flipping out over this. He reminds her how patient he has been while he waited for her to marry Ridge again and then get kicked to the curb, only to end up with her sister. He can't imagine why she'd even want to be in the same room with him much less in a cozy little office. He wonders if the steam room is next. He declares he is not putting up with this crap any longer. She tries to calm him down. She says Forrester is the only place she can be now. She has a vested interest there plus her children that she needs to protect from Ridge. He's trying to barrel in there and sweep them out. Bill says she does not have to be there to police Ridge. Her children are grown and can take care of themselves. He declares that he is losing patience with her. He is not getting anything he needs from her and he is not putting up with it anymore. Bill tells Brooke that she said she loved him .she admits she does, but .he says then act like it. Show it, she wanted to find herself, take him along for the ride. They can discover themselves together out in the open as a couple. There is no Katie to protect; no hurt feelings from Ridge. He says he is standing there right now in front of her. And if she tells him to go she better make damn sure that is what she wants as he is not coming back. She looks at him long and hard and says no, that is not what she wants. She wants him. He hungrily kisses her and she says now. They fall into bed.",
        "Aly stares into Oliver's eyes. He says maybe he should not have done that. She thinks he regrets kissing her already. He says no; it's just that she looked a little freaked out. She jumps up and says no, but fans herself and babbles that she just needs a minute to catch her breath. Oliver realizes this is her first kiss. She finally admits he is her first. He moves closer and says she has a lot of catching up to do; and kisses her again. He tells her it is an honor that she chose him for her first kiss. He calls her Ms. F. He says she is like a breath of fresh air. He works with so many models that are been there, done that, jaded. He kisses her again but they are interrupted by Pam at the door wanting to come in. Aly directs Oliver to the closet to hide and stay quiet. Pam is dressed in her medieval wench costume and says they need to go now. They have turkey legs to eat and jousting to do. Aly makes an excuse before Pam opens her closet. She says she knows what she will wear and she will meet her downstairs in just a jiff. She apologies to Oliver for the interruption. He says it's her house and he came uninvited. She says he is always welcome. Then she says forget that. She doesn't want to come off as cheap. He says she couldn't even if she tried. He says he likes her. She is a terrific kisser and he does want to see her again. He'd better leave now before Pam gets back. He kisses her one more time and says he will be thinking of her. After they are spent, Brooke tells Bill that she is not going to back out on him. She is ready to tell the whole world. She picks up her phone and calls Katie. She says she is not calling to rub her nose in it, but she'd better tell her before someone else does. She and Bill are together now. .permanently. There are no more secrets. Katie is with Ridge and she is with Bill and that is the way it is. Katie says awesome; she is not surprised. She relays it to Ridge. He can't believe Brooke would do his again. She knows how he feels about Bill being with RJ. Katie says Bill does have his issues but he is not a monster. They will get through this."

        "Katie: This is definitely the best part of our day -- ending it right here with you -- our own little world where nobody can touch us.",
        "Ridge: They can't touch us anywhere.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: Are you sure? Forces are gathering.",
        "Ridge: So let them gather. Won't effect what we have together.",
        "Katie: Good, because I don't want things to change.",
        "Ridge: Sometimes change is good.",
        "Katie: I can't really imagine it getting any better than this.",
        "Ridge: You ain't seen nothing yet.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Bill!",
        "Bill: I want you back.",
        "Brooke: Uh, it's -- it's been a long day.",
        "Bill: Don't even say it, because I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Maybe I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Aly: You regret kissing me already?",
        "Oliver: No. No. You just look a little freaked out.",
        "Aly: I am. No! No, not really. It's just -- hold on. I just, uh, need a minute to... catch my breath. Okay. I -- breathing in. [Inhales deeply] Breathing out. Okay. In... and out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Seriously, are you okay?",
        "Aly: I am better than okay. That was -- whew -- breathtaking.",
        "Oliver: I'm flattered. I-I've never had a reaction like that before.",
        "Aly: I had no idea.",
        "Oliver: About what?",
        "Aly: How it feels, you know, to kiss and stuff.",
        "Oliver: Are you -- are you saying you've never been kissed before? A beautiful girl like you?",
        "Aly: I'm not beautiful, and no. You're my first.",
        "Oliver: You know what that tells me? You've got a lot of catching up to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Well, that's it, then.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Ridge: Our little sanctuary is gone. Our family knows we're together, and my dad already used us as a bargaining chip, so it's only a matter of time before the media comes down on us.",
        "Katie: Mm. Maybe we should just hibernate for the rest of the year.",
        "Ridge: Maybe. I just want you to be prepared. That's all.",
        "Katie: I run Spencer Publications, remember? We are the media. And I was married to Bill, and Brooke is my sister. I've got scandal chops.",
        "Ridge: Not the same as being the focus.",
        "Katie: I'm stronger than I look. I can get through anything with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Why does it always feel better when somebody else brushes your hair?",
        "Bill: I'll make you a deal. How about 100 strokes a night?",
        "Brooke: Only 100?",
        "Bill: So, you said you had a long day?",
        "Brooke: Yes. And a few surprises.",
        "Bill: Tell me.",
        "Brooke: Ridge fired Oliver.",
        "Bill: Why?",
        "Brooke: Who the Hell knows? Then he went on to disrespect Hope and Rick and their contributions to Hope for the Future. He bashed the line, and then he tried to oust Rick as president.",
        "Bill: Well, that's an ambitious agenda even for Ridge.",
        "Brooke: Yep, but it didn't fly. Eric reinstated Oliver, and he made sure that Ridge knew that Rick's position was secure.",
        "Bill: Good for him.",
        "Brooke: And he appointed Ridge and me co-vice presidents.",
        "Bill: He -- he what? That sneaky son of a -- I mean, you know what he's doing, right? He wants you and Ridge together, and it is a transparent ploy to make that happen. Well, I hope you told him to shove it.",
        "Brooke: Not exactly.",
        "Bill: Well, what the Hell, Brooke?!",
        "Brooke: Why are you flipping out?",
        "Bill: Why am I flipping out? You know what? You're right. I am flipping out. Let me take a deep breath. [Inhales deeply] See if that helps. It does not help! Do you know why? Because this goes against my very nature -- who I am. I have had to learn patience for you, and I don't like being patient. You needed space, I gave you space. Hell, I-I-I backed all the way out when you decided, for the millionth time, that you wanted to marry Ridge yet again. Well, how did that work out for you? Same as usual? Kicked to the curb? So, this time, he goes for your sister. I mean, I can't imagine why you would want to be in the same room with the guy, let alone a cozy, little office situation. I mean, what's next, Brooke? Steam room? I am not putting up with this crap any longer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: First kiss and you chose me. I'm honored, Miss F.",
        "Aly: Is that how it seemed? Because I-I wasn't, like, coming on to you or anything. I wouldn't even know how.",
        "Oliver: Are you always so literal?",
        "Aly: Pretty much.",
        "Oliver: So, you say what you mean.",
        "Aly: You have to. Trying to translate what's unspoken or said in a roundabout way -- I don't know. People should just say whatever it is they're thinking.",
        "Oliver: You're very refreshing. No, I'm serious. I work with models. You wouldn't believe how \"been there, done that\" a lot of them are, all world weary and jaded. You are like a breath of fresh air. That makes me want to...",
        "Aly: [Chuckles]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Pam: Aly, may I come in?",
        "Aly: Pam.",
        "Oliver: What do you want me to do?",
        "Aly: Hide. Closet. Closet. Shh. Shh. Okay. Hi. Wow. Look at you.",
        "Pam: Yeah. Medieval night. Come on, sweetheart. We got to go. Now. Something...going on in here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Full disclosure?",
        "Ridge: Please.",
        "Katie: I'm not thrilled with the idea of you and Brooke being co-vice presidents.",
        "Ridge: Neither am I.",
        "Katie: Eric wants you back together, and he thinks that proximity is the fastest way to make that happen.",
        "Ridge: I don't like that he's dismissing our relationship.",
        "Katie: You know, I-I'm kind of surprised because I always thought that he liked me. I mean, for him to dangle this C.E.O. position in front of you just to get you to leave me --",
        "Ridge: It's -- he just thinks that that is what I really want.",
        "Katie: He thinks that if you're around Brooke enough, your feelings for her will resurface. Is he right?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Katie: Brooke will get lonely. She always does. She wants you back. She thinks you're fair game.",
        "Ridge: I don't care what she wants. What I want's right here. So do with me as you wish.",
        "Katie: If you insist.",
        "Ridge: Okay! I'm coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: It is important for me to be at Forrester right now.",
        "Bill: Why? Forrester's not the only game in town.",
        "Brooke: It's the only one I know. It's where I'm invested. It's where my children are. And I need to protect them.",
        "Bill: From what?",
        "Brooke: From Ridge. They've accomplished a lot at Forrester Creations, and Ridge is trying to barrel in there and squeeze them out.",
        "Bill: Your children are grown-ups who can protect their own interests. You don't need to be there policing Ridge. Unless Rick and Hope are just an excuse.",
        "Brooke: Meaning?",
        "Bill: So you can be around Ridge, draw him back in.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God. Now you're just being insulting.",
        "Bill: No. I'm keeping it real, Brooke. I am out of patience. I am tired of being shown the door. I am not getting anything that I need from you. And I'm not putting up with it anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: What's in the closet, Aly?",
        "Aly: Nothing.",
        "Pam: You seem awful distracted for nothing.",
        "Aly: A mouse.",
        "Pam: A mouse?",
        "Aly: Yeah, I-I thought I heard a mouse.",
        "Pam: I'll get my lance and my broadsword.",
        "Aly: What are you wearing, exactly?",
        "Pam: What? Don't you like my outfit?",
        "Aly: It's...interesting.",
        "Pam: Oh, I ran it by Charlie last night. He loved it. He gave it rave reviews. He was so sorry he couldn't come with us, but come on! Medieval night awaits! We got turkey legs to eat and jousting to watch. I'll help you with your outfit.",
        "Aly: No, wait!",
        "Pam: What? Aly, don't tell me that you're backing out. I was so looking forward to this.",
        "Aly: No, no, no. I just, uh -- I-I just want to change.",
        "Pam: Yeah. Well, I'll help you. That's why --",
        "Aly: No! I actually already know what I'm gonna wear, so, um, I'll meet you downstairs.",
        "Pam: All right. But hurry, Aly, okay? I don't want to miss the beginning. Apparently this really cute white knight comes in on a horse, and the horse bows down in front of all the people.",
        "Aly: I will be right there.",
        "Pam: Hurry, Aly!",
        "Aly: I will. [Sighs]",
        "Oliver: Turkey legs?",
        "Aly: [Chuckles] [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Katie: Why do we have to keep learning the same lessons over and over?",
        "Ridge: Here we go. Going deep. We don't have to be philosophical now. Let's just get some rest. 'Cause I know I have that effect on women.",
        "Katie: You do.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Katie: You really do. No, seriously, though, these things happen in your life -- these horrible, tragic, stressful things, and you think, \"how am I ever gonna get through this? I'll never be able to survive.\" And then, inevitably, you back on those events, and you realize that they were the best things that ever happened to you.",
        "Ridge: 'Cause they make us who we are.",
        "Katie: Why is it so hard to remember that when you're in the middle of it?",
        "Ridge: I guess the important part is to remember that you can make it. You can do anything. That's how strong you are.",
        "Katie: You really believe that?",
        "Ridge: I do.",
        "Katie: No one's ever seen me like that before.",
        "Ridge: Well, then they're either blind or they're stupid. I don't doubt you for a minute.",
        "Katie: You'll never have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You came to me, said you love me, asked me to be... patient.",
        "Brooke: I do love you.",
        "Bill: Then act like it, and act on it. Stop putting up artificial barriers. You said you wanted to find yourself, then take me along for the ride. Let's figure out who we are together, as a couple, out in the open. There's nothing standing in our way anymore -- no Katie to protect, no Ridge to worry about and his little hurt feelings. It's just us and everything we talked about and everything that we said we wanted. I'm here, Brooke. I'm standing right here in front of you. It's time. It's time to take a shot -- no more reasons why we can't happen, no more showing me the door. If you tell me to go, you better be damn sure it's what you want, because I am not coming back. Is that what you want?",
        "Brooke: No. I want you. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: [Sighs] Sorry about the interruption.",
        "Oliver: Don't be. It's your house. I came by uninvited.",
        "Aly: But not unwelcome.",
        "Oliver: That's good to know.",
        "Aly: I mean, if you wanted to come back... forget I said that.",
        "Oliver: You don't want me to come back?",
        "Aly: No, no, I -- yes, of course I want you to come back. It's just I-I don't want to come off...cheap.",
        "Oliver: You couldn't if you tried. I would love to see you again. I like you.",
        "Aly: Great. Because this has been... so fun... hanging out. I like you, too, Oliver. You're a really great guy.",
        "Oliver: And you, Miss F, are a terrific kisser. Well, I better go before Pam gets back.",
        "Aly: You know how to get out without her seeing? I'll figure it out. Medieval night. I could turn that into a photo shoot.",
        "Aly: Please, no more photo shoots.",
        "Oliver: We'll see. In the meantime, enjoy those turkey legs. I'll be thinking of you.",
        "Aly: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: [Grunts] Oh, wow. Who knew it could be like that again?",
        "Brooke: Uh, you?",
        "Bill: Yeah, that's right. I never gave up on us.",
        "Brooke: Oh, no. You were relentless.",
        "Bill: Mm. Well, you can say it any time.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Bill: \"You were right, Bill.\"",
        "Brooke: I think I expressed that.",
        "Bill: You won't back out on me?",
        "Brooke: No. I won't back out on you. In fact, I think I'm ready to tell the whole world. [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: What are you doing? Who are you calling?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Katie: Hello?",
        "Brooke: Katie. Hi. I'm not calling to rub your nose in it, but I didn't want you to hear this from somebody else. Bill and I are together now.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Brooke: Permanently.",
        "Katie: What is it you want me to say, Brooke?",
        "Brooke: Well, you don't have to say anything. We're gonna do right by the kids, and now there's no more secrets. You're with Ridge, I'm with Bill, and that's the way it is.",
        "Katie: Great. Awesome. Congratulations. I wish I could say I'm surprised, but I kind of figured you'd end up together.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I just thought you should know.",
        "Ridge: Brooke and Bill?",
        "Katie: Together again.",
        "Ridge: I can't believe she'd do that.",
        "Katie: I can't believe you're surprised.",
        "Ridge: She knows how I feel about the guy. I don't want him around my son.",
        "Katie: Listen, Bill has his issues, but he's not a monster. R.J. will adjust. And we'll get through this together."
