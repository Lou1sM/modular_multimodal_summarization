    "Recap": [
        "Rick tells Carter that he doesn't think he knows a damn thing about Maya. But if he does, spit it out and then leave. Maya asks why is he doing this to them. They just want to be happy. Rick thinks Carter is jealous but Carter denies that. Rick says he knows Maya better than most couples know each other. Carter stops short of telling what he knows but tells Rick that he better get the full story from Maya. Rick informs Carter that this is not helping his job security. And he knows he can trust Maya and she has been loyal to him and that is all that matters. And he demands that Carter give Maya the proper respect that she deserves. Rick needs to take a phone call so he leaves Maya and Carter alone. Oliver tells Ridge that he needs to take some pictures for the new structure of the company and Ivy will be next. That suits her fine so she can stay away from Maya and Rick. But they all wonder when Nicole waltzes in and wants her chance at a photo shoot. Ridge sees a chance and gives Nicole the okay for Oliver to do that. She is green as a gourd and doesn't even know that she, like all models, has a good side. Deacon tells Wyatt that he went about this the wrong way by telling Quinn about Brooke. Wyatt defends himself by saying he was only looking out for his mother. They both hope that Quinn won't go after Brooke now. Brooke tells Quinn that she doesn't know why she is here. She does not need a man in her life right now. She just wants to focus on her family and sobriety. But she does tell Quinn that she doesn't think her marrying Deacon is a good idea and nothing Quinn can say will change how she feels. Quinn says Brooke's opinion means nothing to her but just stay the hell out of her life. Carter tells Maya not to thank him just yet because he did not tell Rick today. Maya says she doesn't think he will. And she will tell him herself when Rick proposes. But with his divorce and all the dissention here in the office he may not ever propose. Carter says he knows that Maya thinks this is her life and hers to tell but if she is going to then she better do it soon.",
        "Quinn comes back home and try as he might Deacon can not get her in a good mood and she plays standoffish with him. She does say she is surprised that Brooke has not called him yet to say that Quinn had been by. She informs Deacon that Brooke will no longer be his AA partner. Deacon does not want to talk about that but about them. He guesses that Quinn told Brooke to back off so that must mean she is not finished with him yet. And Brooke will not interfere. Brooke talks to Rick on the phone and tells him that she will be at work in the morning if he really wants her there. Nicole walks into Rick's office to tell Maya something but only finds Carter there. He tells her that he was there earlier when he heard Nicole tell Maya that she was dying to tell Maya's secret and would tell everyone. He closes the door and says they are the only two people there that know that Maya used to be a Myron. Maya is worried but at home she tells Rick that nothing is wrong and she will agree to pizza and a Kings game. Quinn tells Deacon to stop trying to use his charms on her. He says he will if she stops acting like an idiot. He will argue all night with her if he has to. He reminds her he could be with Brooke right now but he is with Quinn, the one he wants to be with and spend a lifetime with. She does not say no. Ridge gets a phone call from Caroline in New York just as he is thinking about her and painting her picture. She says she has been thinking about him all day .and he better not be painting without her. They both say they miss each other and love one another. Rick is happy that Maya will watch a hockey game with him. He brings up when they first met and she thought he was a waiter. He says that he spent his whole life looking for the right woman but he was let down so many times before he met her. She has been so great for him and he does not want her to ever feel ashamed of anything. She is a woman of integrity and that means everything to him. They hug but Maya silently cries."

        "Rick: You think you know something about Maya, something I well, go on. Get it off your chest, and you can get on out. Because you don't know a damn thing. Yeah.",
        "Carter: You're wrong, Rick. You don't know Maya as well as you think you do.",
        "Ridge: So, tell me again why we're doing this.",
        "Oliver: We need new artwork for the new power structure at Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Politics, my favorite.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, just be a few more. Ivy, we're gonna take your pieces next.",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah,",
        "Ridge: No rush? Yosese to be, or no?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Somewhere else? Do you mean upstairs with the very high risk of running into Rick and Maya? No, thank you. It's a lot easier to stay out of the boss's way down here.",
        "Oliver: Don't I know it.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Nicole: Oh, good! Oliver, you're already set up. You can do me next.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt you're trying to get here, this is not the way to go about it.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, I'm just looking out for my mom.",
        "Deacon: How -- by trying toerer more suspicious of Brooke?",
        "Wyatt: This isn't about Brooke! I told my moth about you.",
        "Deacon: You're not he her, Wyatt. You know, you can't just rile Quinn up and t",
        "Wyatt: You really think she'll go after Brooke?",
        "Deacon: I don't know, but I didn't stop her. Maybe I should've.",
        "Quinn: Away from Deacon, and you didn't listen. B Brooke: I don't respond well to threats.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] You think I'm threatening you? I'm not threatening you. And you don't want me to.",
        "Brooke: W Quinn? Didn't Deacon explain the situation to your satisfaction? I am not pursuing Deacon. I don't need a man in my life right now. I just want to focus on my sobriety and on my family. But that doesn't mean that I agree with your relationship, with your engagement, because I don't. Deacon does not belong with you, and there's nothing that you can do or say that's going to convince me otherwise.",
        "Deacon: You know, Wyatt, your mom was in a really good place. She was happy. She was looking forward. New job, wedding. Why couldn't you just let it be?",
        "Wyatt: What -- let her be in the dark?",
        "Deacon: You know, man, things were good between us.",
        "Wyatt: She had no idea that you were being Brooke's white knight and savior.",
        "Deacon: That is your take on it!",
        "Wyatt: Hey, I just told her what I heard. That's it. You had your chance to explain yourself. If she went over to confront Brooke, well, then, you must not have done a very good job of it.",
        "Ivy: Nicole is modeling?",
        "Oliver: Great, great. They have the photos. They'll be retouched and uploaded with the article.",
        "Ridge: What's going on there?",
        "Oliver: Uh...Nicole, I haven't heard back from your sister yet.",
        "Nicole: You will.",
        "Oliver: I know, but until I do, I can't do anything. My hands are tied.",
        "Nicole: Well, I thought we could get a jump on things. You could give me a few pointers before you get the call.",
        "Ridge: You want to be a model?",
        "Nicole: I do.",
        "Ivy: Well, do you have any experience?",
        "Nicole: Not yet, but my sister's gonna pull some strings for me.",
        "Ridge: Why wait? Jump right in.",
        "Maya: Why are you doing this, Carter? Can't you just let us be happy?",
        "Rick: Don't you think it's a little late in the game to start the whole \"jealous ex\" routine?",
        "Carter: I'm not jealous.",
        "Rick: Maya and I, we've been through a lot together. We know each other better than most couples ever will.",
        "Carter: You don't know everything.",
        "Rick: Okay, well, maybe we haven't shared every detail, but that's a relationship. You take that time to get to know each other.",
        "Carter: Rick... you just better make sure she doesn't leave anything out. I didn't get the whole story when we were together. I'm still learning things about Maya. In time, so will you.",
        "Carter: I should go.",
        "Rick: No, no, no, no. I came here looking for you, Carter. I'd really like to know what's going on.",
        "Maya: Nothing. [Sighs]",
        "Rick: Maya? I've walked in on you guys going at it twice today.",
        "Maya: Everything's fine now.",
        "Rick: Better stay that way, because badmouthing Maya might score some points with your pal Ridge, but it's not doing much for your job security. I may not know everything about Maya, but I know what's in her heart. I know where her loyalty lies, and that's what matters, Carter. And that's why you're gonna treat her with the respect that she deserves. Because if you have a problem with her... you're gonna have a problem with me. You got it?",
        "Carter: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Good. I've got a phone call.",
        "Maya: I'll see you at home.",
        "Deacon: I will marry your mother, Wyatt. But there's something you got to understand. Brooke has been a very important part of my life for a very long time. And that's not gonna change because Quinn's my wife.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, man. You cannot be that naive.",
        "Quinn: I don't have to convince you of anything, Brooke, because -- and here's the part that you don't seem to get. I don't care what you think. Your opinion about my relationship is irrelevant. So stay the hell out of it.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: Okay, be honest. Tell me what you really think.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Is the shoot about you or the design?",
        "Nicole: Well, it's my audition.",
        "Ridge: It's always about the design.",
        "Nicole: Right.",
        "Oliver: Try looking this way a little bit. That's your good side.",
        "Nicole: I have a good side?",
        "Ridge: Everybody has a good side. Models know which side that is, and they know how to use it.",
        "Oliver: And now let's go over here. Try softening your eyes.",
        "Ivy: It's probably not my place to ask, but what are you doing?",
        "Ridge: I'm helping, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: You're helping Maya's sister?",
        "Oliver: And, uh...",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I'm a team player.",
        "Oliver: Okay.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Okay, why am I having a hard time believing that?",
        "Ridge: She's not a model. But if her sister wants to throw her in front of a camera, let her do it. It's gonna show what a ridiculous influence Maya is on this company.",
        "Oliver: Back in. Okay.",
        "Ridge: I got to get rid of Maya and Rick.",
        "Ivy: But how?",
        "Oliver: [Speaking indistinctly]",
        "Carter: Don't thank me.",
        "Maya: Don't worry.",
        "Carter: I didn't tell your secret.",
        "Maya: And you're not going to.",
        "Carter: You didn't intimidate me, Maya. Threatening my job -- it's a desperate move.",
        "Maya: So why'd you change your mind?",
        "Carter: Rick.",
        "Maya: He loves me.",
        "Carter: He needs to hear it from you.",
        "Maya: He will... when he proposes.",
        "Carter: He can accept it, or he can't. Wearing a ring's not gonna change that.",
        "Maya: You know, he's going through a lot right now, Carter -- his divorce, people constantly threatening to take his job. With all of that, he might never propose. But if he does, it's another level of commitment. And when a man makes that choice --",
        "Carter: He should do it knowing what he's getting into. Look, I know you say it's your life, right? It's your business. But it doesn't just affect you.",
        "Maya: You feel tricked.",
        "Carter: If you don't want Rick to feel the same way... be honest with him.",
        "Maya: This is who I am. The woman who Rick and you see standing in front of you... is the real me.",

        "[Door opens]",
        "Deacon: [Exhales sharply]",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Deacon: Hey. I, uh, heard your car pull up.",
        "Quinn: What are you doing down here?",
        "Deacon: [Sighs] I was talking to Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: Did he leave?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I figured we could use a little bit of privacy.",
        "Quinn: [Inhales deeply] Went to see Brooke.",
        "Deacon: I guessed.",
        "Quinn: She hasn't called you yet?",
        "Deacon: No.",
        "Quinn: Well, she won't. I got through to her. You are done being her AA. Partner, Deacon.",
        "Deacon: Is that what you need to hear from me? 'Cause I'd rather talk about us.",
        "Quinn: This is about us.",
        "Deacon: Brooke's not interfering.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, she won't. Don't you want to know what I mean, what I did to her?",
        "Deacon: I know you better than that.",
        "Quinn: Told her to back off.",
        "Deacon: So, uh, that means you're not finished with me yet.",
        "Quinn: I haven't decided.",
        "Deacon: I told you before that I'm committed to you and this relationship. That hasn't changed. And it's not going to.",
        "Brooke: I'll be there.",
        "Rick: Good. Good. Forrester needs you.",
        "Brooke: Well, thank you for saying so, honey. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.",
        "[Computer chimes]",
        "Ivy: Hey, I think this means the article's just come through. Ooh, do you want to see it?",
        "Ridge: Nope.",
        "Ivy: You know what? It's actually -- it's really positive.",
        "Ridge: Is it?",
        "Ivy: Yeah!",
        "Ridge: It's a fluff piece to help Ricky out. That's what that is.",
        "Ivy: Look at you. You look so handsome. [Laughs] I mean, come on. This could be a lot worse. It could be some article about queen Maya and her little sister, Forrester's new ing\u00e9nue.",
        "Ridge: I'm sure it's in the works.",
        "Ivy: Well, hey, now they've got some great photos to go with it.",
        "Nicole: Maya, you won't believe I just had my first... modeling session.",
        "Carter: Got your big break.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckling] Oh, hey, Carter. Uh, it was just a test shoot.",
        "Carter: Your sister set that up for you?",
        "Nicole: Ridge actually said I should go for it. But I'm sure Maya will be okay with it.",
        "Carter: Really? I thought she was against the whole modeling idea -- that she wanted you to focus on computer programming.",
        "Nicole: She talked with you about that?",
        "Carter: No. I heard her talking to you.",
        "Nicole: When?",
        "Carter: In here...earlier.",
        "Nicole: Oh.",
        "Carter: \"Oh.\" That's all you have to say? It sounded like you were dying to tell Maya's secret. You said you should tell everybody.",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: Did you get caught up at the office?",
        "Maya: Oh, uh...sorry. I, uh...yeah. I just -- I had to take care of some last- minute things.",
        "Rick: You didn't get into it with Carter again, did you?",
        "Maya: Uh, no.",
        "Rick: I don't know what's going on with him.",
        "Maya: Just an off day. Everybody has them.",
        "Rick: Yeah, except for you.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] Well, today wasn't stellar.",
        "Rick: Well, that's okay, because I have just the cure for it.",
        "Maya: Oh, yeah?",
        "Rick: Yeah. Pizza...and the kings game.",
        "Maya: Pizza! And... hockey.",
        "Rick: You don't like hockey?",
        "Maya: Not really.",
        "Rick: Well, then, I guess Carter's right. I don't know everything about you. What? What'd I say? What's wrong?",
        "Maya: Nothing.",
        "Deacon: I'm sorry. You know what? You're right. I am concerned about Brooke.",
        "Quinn: And you're telling me that I shouldn't be?",
        "Deacon: We have different concerns.",
        "Quinn: Oh, and yours are valid, and mine aren't?",
        "Deacon: Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Quinn? 'Cause you know how much that turns me on.",
        "Quinn: Oh, don't try to use your charm to win me over.",
        "Deacon: Right, fair enough. I won't use my charm if you stop acting like an idiot.",
        "Quinn: I'm not an idiot.",
        "Deacon: Ow. Look, you're right. I could be with her, right? But I'm not. I'm right here, with you.",
        "Quinn: She needs to find someone else to lean on.",
        "Deacon: Uh, that's a great idea! You know, she's been doing really well with her drinking. I mean, if she needs support, there's a lot of other people that can help her.",
        "Quinn: So now you're agreeing with me.",
        "Deacon: Unless you want to fight about that, too. But if that's the only way that I can prove myself to you, then we can fight all night long, baby! Let me tell you something. I'm stubborn. When I want something, I get it. And I want a life with you. I'm tired of running around in circles and chasing my tail. All you got to do is give me the word.",
        "Quinn: What word is that?",
        "Deacon: Any word but \"No.\" I'm guessing by your silence that that means \"Yes\"?",
        "Quinn: It's not a \"No.\"",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: Hey. I was just thinking about you. I was hoping you'd check in.",
        "Caroline: Well, I've been thinking about you all day. Are you still at work?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I'm just finishing a sketch.",
        "Caroline: You better not be painting without me.",
        "Ridge: Never. Why don't you get back here? I need my muse.",
        "Caroline: I'll be back as soon as I can.",
        "Ridge: Not soon enough. So, what are you doing? You getting ready for bed?",
        "Caroline: It's new York. Things are just getting started.",
        "Ridge: Ah. You're going dancing?",
        "Caroline: Mm, I'm, uh... not really in the mood for dancing lately.",
        "Ridge: Okay, but you're having fun, right?",
        "Caroline: I'm staying busy.",
        "Ridge: I miss you.",
        "Caroline: I miss you, too. And I'll be back as soon as I can, okay? I love you.",
        "Ridge: I love you, too.",
        "Caroline: Okay. Good night.",
        "Ridge: Night.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Nicole: Uh, is Maya still here?",
        "Carter: Maya's gone. Rick is, too. It's just us, Nicole. The only two people in this building who know your sister Maya...used to be your big brother Myron.",
        "Maya: You know, after everything you've done for me, I think I can watch hockey.",
        "Rick: We're a team, but we don't have to like all the same things.",
        "Maya: You've always treated me like an individual. You never made assumptions like I did about you when we first met.",
        "Rick: You weren't wrong about me, Maya.",
        "Maya: I thought you were a homeless waiter.",
        "Rick: You thought I was a guy that needed some help.",
        "Maya: And you didn't.",
        "Rick: I did. I just didn't know it till I met you.",
        "Maya: I can't tell you how much it means to hear you say things like that, and to know that I'm appreciated by such an incredible, kind, open, understanding man.",
        "Rick: I spent my whole life looking for the right woman... always being let down time and time again... until you. You have been so great for me. And I know it hasn't been easy. People might even scoff at it -- you and me together, living this life. But they don't know you. They don't know the ridicule that you've been through and the threats and the name-calling. But you don't have to worry about any of that, Maya. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You've been honest and up-front. You've been a woman of integrity. And that means everything to me."
