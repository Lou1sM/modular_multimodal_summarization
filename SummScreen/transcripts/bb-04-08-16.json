        "Quinn screams at Wyatt to be smart about this. All he has to do is walk away and not look back. He can have his life with Steffy and she with Liam. He tells her that she needs to be locked up. Steffy would leave him the minute she found out about Liam. Suddenly Liam remembers who he is and Steffy was his bride in the picture, not Quinn. Wyatt demands the key to open the lock but Quinn keeps berating him to just leave. Wyatt kicks in the door and on the other side is Liam who rushes toward him. Wyatt says he knows he has no idea what is happening but he needs to go with him right away. Liam smiles and says yes, he will go, he knows he is his brother. He says he is remembering more and more. He looks at Quinn and says she is insane. Frantically she rails that Adam was the best part of Liam and no man has ever talked to her like that. She did not plan on this or know what to do. He said she acted like they were married but he had no idea how far she would go. She robbed him of his life with his family. She rants until he tells her to stop pretending she loves him. She was only manipulating him. He said she tried to convince him that she was his Eve but he also knew that his Eve was somewhere out there and now he is going home to his Steffy. Bill tells Steffy none of this sounds plausible. Liam is somewhere and they need to find him. She agrees. It does not seem possible that the old Liam would leave his family, his job and her. But this new Liam might that was so bitter about everything.",
        "Quinn still tries to twist things around that Steffy was there once but that is behind him. She begs Wyatt to convince Liam to forgive her and get him to remember how he felt as Adam. She needs to get him away from this place. Liam says yes she is going away; she is going to prison. With Quinn still yammering they can start over, Wyatt and Liam manage to grab her and throw her into a closet and put a padlock on it. All the while she is screaming to let her out. Wyatt calls Bill who is surprised that he has found Liam and they are on their way to the cliff house. Bill says he is there already and so is Steffy. She will be happy to see him. At his home, Wyatt points Liam down the path to the beach where he will find Steffy. He says they were all worried about him but Steffy most of all. He needs to go see her. Steffy sits and waits until Liam comes into view. He sees her first and runs toward her. She senses his presence and gets up and runs as fast as she can toward him. She jumps into his arms and they hug."

        "Quinn: Just leave. Forget you saw anything.",
        "Wyatt: Forget that you kidnapped Liam?",
        "Quinn: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: That I saw you guys in bed together?! That -- that he has no idea who the hell he is right now?!",
        "Quinn: Yes, yes! Yes, just -- just leave. Go back to Steffy and live your life, and let me live my life with Liam. Be -- be smart about this, okay? I mean, we can have everything we have ever wanted if you just walk away and never look back.",
        "Liam: Steffy. I remember. It was Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You're imagining things.",
        "Bill: Explain to me where he is.",
        "Steffy: He's at some retreat.",
        "Bill: Any inkling where? You have an address? Is he even in this country?",
        "Steffy: No, I don't -- I don't know.",
        "Bill: Exactly. Nobody does.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Caroline gives birth, his brother gets married to you, and we get crickets from some mysterious retreat. Liam doesn't show up for any of it. Sound plausible to you? Because it doesn't to me.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: It's so frustrating. I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.",
        "Steffy: I'm worried about Liam, too. And you're right. It doesn't seem plausible for him to just take off for weeks and leave his job, his family, me. Not the old Liam. But this -- this new Liam who's distant and full of anger -- I hate to say it, but it does seem plausible.",
        "Bill: It would be one thing if he were just cutting off communication with you. All right, relationships go sour. But why would he not contact me or Caroline?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. Wyatt just has this theory that Liam's just trying to find himself.",
        "Bill: No. Something's wrong. I feel it. And I know you feel it, too.",
        "Steffy: Liam. Liam. Check, check, check. Marry me. [Echoing] Marry me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Just walk away. No one has to know, and you and Steffy could live your lives in peace.",
        "Wyatt: Staying silent is living in peace? Not being able to look my own wife in the eye is -- is living in peace?",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, just be reasonable.",
        "Wyatt: She would leave me, Mom.",
        "Quinn: I know that! That is why I'm --",
        "Wyatt: No, for lying to her! You don't think I'll keep Steffy if Liam comes back? Is that it?",
        "Quinn: Well, do you want to take that chance?",
        "Wyatt: Wow, you -- you are crazy. Everything you're doing right now is just disgusting.",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Wyatt: You need to be put in a mental hospital. That's what you need.",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. Stop it. Don't say that.",
        "Wyatt: How did I even come out halfway as good as I did, being your son? Give me the keys to this lock.",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Wyatt: Mom...",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Wyatt: ...Give me the keys to the lock.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, please, just --",
        "Wyatt: You know what?",
        "Quinn: No, Wyatt! [Screams]",
        "Wyatt: I know you don't know who I am, but you need to trust me. You have to come with me right now.",
        "Liam: I think I can manage. After all, you're my brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Look, I know you want to believe that Liam wouldn't disappear or not stay in contact. I want to believe that, too. But we have to accept it. If Liam was really in trouble, why would he text me? Why would he call me, telling me not to bother him anymore? Wouldn't he -- wouldn't he be calling me, saying, \"Help! Call 911\"?",
        "Bill: Justin did a thorough check. There have been no credit-card charges since Liam left. No retreat, no hotels, no restaurants, nothing.",
        "Steffy: Okay, so he's paying cash.",
        "Bill: Whose cash? No money has left his account.",
        "Steffy: Okay, so, there has to be an explanation. If he's hiding, maybe -- maybe he got another credit card.",
        "Bill: No. We did a thorough check. Liam has disappeared. He's in trouble, and we have to find him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You remember me?",
        "Liam: You're my brother.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Right?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I remember. I remember... more and more. You're insane.",
        "Quinn: I took care of you. You were sick.",
        "Liam: I needed help.",
        "Quinn: That's why I did what I did.",
        "Liam: From a doctor! I needed help!",
        "Quinn: I talked to a doctor. I researched your condition carefully. That's -- that's why --",
        "Liam: Oh. Oh, God.",
        "Quinn: I loved you.",
        "Liam: Oh, God. No, no, no.",
        "Quinn: I did!",
        "Liam: No, no. Don't --",
        "Quinn: And I still do.",
        "Liam: How can you say that?! How can you possibly think that's love?",
        "Quinn: Because I feel it, and you feel it, too. Getting to know you the way I did --",
        "Liam: Getting to know me? Getting to know me?! The man without a memory?",
        "Quinn: But you were still you. Adam was the best part of Liam. He was so kind and he was so gentle and he talked to me so sweetly, like -- like no man ever has before.",
        "Liam: Oh, God.",
        "Quinn: And then you got to know me. You got to know parts of me that no man has ever known!",
        "Liam: You kept me here against my will!",
        "Quinn: I-I-I-I wasn't -- I didn't plan on it. I didn't -- I didn't plan on any of this. You -- you -- you fell. You hit your head, and I didn't know what to do with you.",
        "Wyatt: Taken him to a hospital might have been a good choice.",
        "Quinn: I thought I could handle it.",
        "Liam: And I was in and out of consciousness. I couldn't -- I had no idea who I was, and you kept me here, and you lied to me. And -- and you -- you told me we were married. You acted like we were married. I-I had no idea. I had no idea how far you were willing to go. You -- you're a monster.",
        "Quinn: Adam, please --",
        "Liam: You robbed me! You robbed me of my life, of my family!",
        "Quinn: Don't you see? I became your family. I became your life.",
        "Liam: Oh, God.",
        "Quinn: We had each other. That's why I did it all. That's why I waited on you, hand and foot, because of how I feel about you.",
        "Liam: Stop pretending that you love me. Stop it.",
        "Quinn: You called me your angel, remember? We were happy once. We still could be. You don't have to go back to being Liam. We're all packed and ready to go. We could -- we could just go. We could hit the road and -- and be Adam and Eve and start our whole lives together, but this time, without any lies, without anything hidden.",
        "Liam: You are not my Eve. You tried -- oh, you tried and you tried to convince me -- to convince me that this was you. And I couldn't shake it. I knew that my Eve was somewhere out there waiting for me. I'm going home now...to Steffy.",
        "Quinn: You're confused. You're only just starting to remember. Yes, you -- you and Steffy -- you were together once a long time ago.",
        "Liam: Just stop -- stop doing that! Stop twisting everything around! Yeah, it's still fuzzy, but I remember enough. And I know what Steffy and I had, and I know that she's waiting for me. And she's -- she's probably worried sick.",
        "Wyatt: She has been concerned, yes. We all have, but li-listen.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, I got to see her. I got -- I got -- I have to explain.",
        "Quinn: Yes, but wait! Why don't you just wait first! Just wait. Just rest a little bit. You need to rest and get your memory back.",
        "Liam: No! No! I'm going now!",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, please help me talk some sense into him.",
        "Wyatt: What?! Help you?!",
        "Quinn: Liam and I belong together. I know you don't see it right now, but we share something so special with each other. And he's angry at me right now, but he's gonna forgive me. He will. I know he's just shocked. He just -- he just needs to spend some time with me and remember how he feels.",
        "Liam: Do you even hear yourself?",
        "Quinn: Please, please. Help me. Help me. I know that I can convince him. This is gonna benefit all of us. I just need to get him away from this place and away from all of these memories.",
        "Liam: Trust me, you're going away. You're going to prison.",
        "Quinn: No. Come on. You won't let that happen. You won't let that happen to me.",
        "Liam: He knows it's where you belong, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: This is your chance. This is your chance. Do the right thing.",
        "Wyatt: I will.",
        "Quinn: No! No! Don't! Please! Wyatt, please! Wyatt, please, don't do this to me!",
        "Wyatt: Open the door! Just grab her feet.",
        "Quinn: Don't do this to me! Wyatt, please! Wyatt! Wyatt! Wyatt! Wyatt! Wyatt!",
        "Liam: Um, uh, the key! The key! It's in the desk -- the left drawer in the desk.",
        "Quinn: Let me out! Wyatt, please! Please!",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: You do the honors.",
        "Liam: Okay. Okay.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, please don't leave me in here! Wyatt, come on! Let me out!",
        "Liam: Take me to Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: All right.",
        "[Key clatters]",
        "Quinn: Let me out! Wyatt, please!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: So, what are you suggesting we do? Call the police?",
        "Bill: At this point, yes. Do you still have the message Liam left? They'll want to hear it.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. I thought he wanted nothing to do with me. What if... I-I can't -- I can't do this. So much has changed.",
        "Bill: I know.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Call Liam and tell him we're thinking about getting the police involved. If he feels like he needs space, then he'll get back to you.",
        "Bill: I don't think it'll do any good, but...I'll try it for you.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Bill: But I'm gonna let him know up front I don't want to get any -- any vague text message in response or some kind of dismissive voicemail where he tells me to respect his privacy.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I know. I get that.",
        "Bill: I want to have a live conversation with my son where he explains where he is and what the hell he's up to.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Look, I-I don't want to be here when you call him. I just -- I don't think I can deal with it -- having him say that he hates me again -- so, I'm gonna go to the beach. Let me know, okay?",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Ringing]",
        "Steffy: Hey, you've reached Steffy Forrester. Leave your name and number, and I'll get back to you.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Steffy's phone must be off. You know, I'm gonna call dad.",

        "Wyatt: How about \"Hello?\" He's in the car here with me.",
        "Bill: He's what?",
        "Liam: Dad?",
        "Bill: Liam?",
        "Liam: Dad, hey! I'm here. I'm here thanks to Wyatt.",
        "Bill: Thanks to Wyatt? Wh-what's going on?",
        "Wyatt: Okay, look, it's a long story, Dad, but I'm driving him back to his house. Uh, you want to meet us there?",
        "Bill: Actually, uh, I'm at the cliff house right now. Steffy's with me.",
        "Liam: You're with Steffy?",
        "Bill: Yeah. She's going down to the beach as we speak. She'll be happy to see you.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Please be okay. [Voice breaking] I'm gonna go. I'm gonna wait for you to come home. I don't understand how he could just turn on me like this. I-I didn't even have a chance to explain myself.",
        "Bill: Something's wrong, Steffy. I'm worried that Liam's gone missing.",
        "Steffy: There has to be an explanation.",
        "Bill: He's in trouble, and we have to find him.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: So...this is...",
        "Wyatt: Your house. Yeah.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Whoa. Dad said Steffy's on the beach?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, go down that path right there. It'll take you right to her. Listen. Liam... we've all been worried about you, wondering where you've been... Steffy most of all. Better get done there. Let her know you're home.",
        "Bill: They're on their way over right now. That's all I know. Uh, you know what? They just got here. Let me call you back. Where's Liam?",
        "Wyatt: He's on his way to see Steffy. I, uh -- I should him where the path was to go down to the beach.",
        "Bill: What do you mean you -- you showed him the path? He's been down that path a thousand times.",
        "Wyatt: Dad -- Dad, you won't even believe what he's been through.",
