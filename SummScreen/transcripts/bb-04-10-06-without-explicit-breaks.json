        "Brooke: Your father can be \r\npretty intimidating. ",
        "Nick: He's used to getting \r\nwhat he wants. Not this time. Not about this . ",
        "Brooke: You know what he's \r\ntrying to do. ",
        "Nick: And it's not gonna \r\nchange the way I feel. Because I love you. And as long as we have each other, \r\nthere is nothing that the old man can do to us. Nothing. ",
        "\r\n*************************************************************",
        "Massimo: Ridge, what the \r\nhell are you -- ",
        "Ridge: Don't, don't, \r\ndon't! Don't say a word! Now and everywhere I turn, I'm constantly reminded over \r\nand over again how my stinking, punk brother is trying to steal my family. His \r\nstinking cigars and his stupid pinball machines and I've damn well had it with \r\nhim playing poppa nick to my little boy. ",
        "Massimo: Son, you have got \r\nto get a grip! ",
        "Ridge: What I've got to do \r\nis teach that brother of mine a lesson, a lesson he'll never forget. That's \r\nexactly what I'm gonna do. ",
        "Massimo: No, no, no, you \r\nare not doing anything -- ",
        "Ridge: Massimo, don't \r\nstart with me now! ",
        "Massimo: Listen to me! I \r\nunderstand how frustrated you are, okay? But I told you earlier, you are not \r\ntaking matters into your own hands. I am your father! I will handle things, and \r\nI have. I have spoken to Dominick. I have made my case with him. He knows \r\nexactly what I expect. ",
        "Ridge: Yeah, let me guess \r\nwhat he told you -- \"shove it?\" ",
        "Massimo: All right, okay, \r\nfine, we both know that your brother is head strong, but there are ways to make \r\nhim see how futile his constant defiance is. Listen, please, please, son, I have \r\nthis situation firmly under control. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************************",
        "Jackie: Look, how many \r\ntimes do I have to tell you? You've made a terrible mistake. ",
        "Detective: The facts say \r\notherwise, ma'am. ",
        "Jackie: Facts? You haven't \r\neven told me what I've been charged with. Look, I know my rights, I'm entitled \r\nto make one phone call and damn it, I want to make that phone call right now!\r\n",
        "\r\n**************************************************************",
        "Brooke: I know you're \r\ntrying to reassure me. And I appreciate it, I really do. But Nick, I'm worried. \r\nI don't want to alienate you from your father or cause problems for the Marone \r\nfamily. ",
        "Nick: Hold it, lets get \r\nsomething straight here, anything that's happening has nothing to do with you. I \r\nmake my own decisions. I'm not gonna let my father tell me how to live my life \r\nor tell me who I can love. Besides, it wouldn't do any good because nothing's \r\ngonna pull us apart. Because I wouldn't let that happen. ",
        "[Cell phone rings] \r\nSorry. Hello? ",
        "Jackie: Nicky, thank god \r\nyou're there. You've got to come down here as quickly as you can. ",
        "Nick: Where? ",
        "Jackie: The federal \r\nbuilding in Westwood. I've been arrested. ",
        "Nick: What? ",
        "Jackie: No, I can hardly \r\nbelieve it myself. But I assure you, when I get to the bottom of this, heads \r\nwill roll. ",
        "Nick: Well, what happened?\r\n",
        "Jackie: I don't know. I \r\nwas in my office one minute and the next minute, the FBI -- they swarmed in and \r\nI told them they're making a horrendous mistake but they just won't listen. \r\nNicky, please, get here quickly. I don't know how much more I can take. \n",
        "\r\n*************************************************************",
        "Ridge: I don't need my \r\nfather fighting my battles. I can take care of Nick. ",
        "Massimo: And I am telling \r\nyou that I am not going to allow the bad blood between you and your brother over \r\nBrooke to escalate any further. That's why I have acted swiftly and decisively \r\nto put a stop to it. ",
        "Ridge: What the hell does \r\nthat mean? ",
        "Massimo: What I'm talking \r\nabout is justice, son. About seeing to it that people who act in a certain way \r\nget what they deserve. You have been betrayed by your brother, Ridge. Your own \r\nflesh and blood. I've been betrayed, too. That's why I understand the pain that \r\nyou are going through. Because I have lived through it myself. I know what it is \r\nto sit there and watch somebody take over your whole world. Feeling helpless to \r\ndo anything about it, to stop it. I've lived that. ",
        "[Massimo remembering]\r\n",
        "Deacon: Is he all right? \r\nYou still in there ticking? [Snap] Lights are on but nobody's home, huh? But I \r\nam. I'm home with your wife. ",
        "Massimo: I've lived that \r\nhorror. And I'm not going to let the same thing happen to you. ",
        "Ridge: Why do I get the \r\nfeeling we're not just talking about Nick here? ",
        "Massimo: I'll say it \r\nagain. I am not going to allow this family or the Marone reputation to be \r\ncompromised in any way. That almost happened once. And it's not going to happen \r\nagain. ",
        "\r\n***********************************************************************",
        "Jackie: I have never been \r\nmore humiliated in my entire life. This like a bad movie. The FBI shows up out \r\nof nowhere and drags me out like I'm a murderer. ",
        "Agent #1: Nobody said \r\nanything about murder. ",
        "Jackie: Nobody said \r\nanything. That's why it is so infuriating. I don't have a clue why I'm here! I \r\nmean, you could at least tell me what charges I'm facing. ",
        "Ron: I'll handle this, \r\nagent Dawson. ",
        "Jackie: Nicky! ",
        "Nick: Are you all right?\r\n",
        "Jackie: I think so, I \r\nthink so. ",
        "Nick: What is this? Can we \r\nget these off of her, please? ",
        "Ron: I will, for now. Mrs. \r\nMarone is in some very serious trouble. ",
        "Jackie: That is not \r\npossible. I've told them I haven't done anything. I've told them repeatedly.\r\n",
        "Nick: Shh. What's the \r\ncharge? ",
        "Ron: I was about to \r\nexplain that to Ms. Marone. ",
        "Nick: What's the charge?\r\n",
        "Ron: There are three \r\ncharges. Tax fraud, tax evasion and money laundering. ",
        "Jackie: What? ",
        "Nick: You've got to be \r\nkidding me. ",
        "Ron: I assure you, I am \r\nnot. I can also assure you, if convicted, Ms. Marone's looking at a minimum of \r\n25 years. ",
        "Jackie: Oh, this can't be \r\nhappening. ",
        "Nick: Let me talk to you \r\nfor a second. Listen, agent -- ",
        "Ron: Pachecko, Ron \r\nPachecko. ",
        "Nick: Okay, I don't know \r\nwhat's going on here, Ron. But you and your boys have made a mistake. My \r\nmother's not guilty of anything you're claiming. ",
        "Ron: Yeah, we'll see about \r\nthat. ",
        "Nick: Yeah, we will. Until \r\nthen, I need to know what the bail is, please. ",
        "Ron: I wouldn't count on \r\nMs. Marone even being granted bail, given everything we know. ",
        "[Phone rings] \n",
        "Jackie: Nicky, I think --\r\n",
        "Nick: Mother, let me \r\nhandle this. What do I have to do? ",
        "Ron: First a bail hearing \r\nhas to be set, as I said, it's very likely your mother will not be granted bail. \r\nIf she is, it'll be steep. ",
        "Nick: How steep? \n",
        "Ron: Million dollar bond.\r\n",
        "Jackie: I don't have that \r\nkind of money just laying around. ",
        "Nick: Mother. ",
        "Ron: Meantime we'll get \r\nher in a holding cell, get her booked and processed. ",
        "Jackie: Cell? No, I can't, \r\nNicky. ",
        "Nick: Shh. Settle down. \r\nI'm going to go to the old man and I'm going to talk to him. ",
        "Jackie: Yes, Massimo, \r\nhe'll know what to do. He'll know exactly what to do. ",
        "Brooke: I'll stay with \r\nher. ",
        "Nick: I will get this all \r\ncleared up. I promise. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************************",
        "Massimo: A man does not \r\ncome between his son and his father, okay? It seems that you and I understand \r\nthis, Ridge, but Jacqueline and Dominick don't. ",
        "Ridge: Oh, please, don't \r\nget my started on Jackie. That woman has done nothing but encourage Nick to go \r\nafter my wife and family. If she'd just kept her high fluting nose out of it. I \r\ndon't know what you saw in her, Massimo, I really don't. Now it seems they've \r\ngot Bridget on the bandwagon. ",
        "Massimo: I know. That's \r\ngot to hurt because you and Bridget have been so close all these years. \n",
        "Ridge: What hurts is the \r\nfact that everyone seems to be rallying around Nick and all he's done is \r\ndisrespect me, you and this whole family. ",
        "Massimo: Okay, all right. \r\nI've said this before, but, Ridge, this is all going to work out. You just have \r\nto be patient and get along. I know it's not going to be easy, okay? But trust \r\nme. Your brother will come to his senses sooner than you think. ",
        "\r\n***********************************************************************",
        "[Phone ringing] \n",
        "[Cell door squeaking]\r\n",
        "Agent #1: Hands up. To the \r\nside. Watch your fingers. I need you to take off all your jewelry. One pair of \r\nyellow-gold earrings. The necklace. One white metal necklace with a clear stone.\r\n",
        "[Machine processing] \r\nTurn to the right, please. Turn the left please. ",
        "\r\n**************************************************************",
        "Massimo: Your brother is \r\nvery angry, Dominick. I tried to warn you. ",
        "Nick: My mother's been \r\narrested and I need your help. ",
        "Massimo: I asked for your \r\nhelp earlier. ",
        "Nick: Did you hear what I \r\nsaid? She's down at the federal building right now. She's been arrested for tax \r\nevasion, money laundering, tax fraud. We're talking real time and real crime. \r\nThis isn't about Forrester. ",
        "Massimo: I told you that \r\nunless this situation resolves between you, your brother and Brooke, our \r\nfamily's problems have just begun. But you didn't want to listen to me, \r\nDominick. So why should I listen to you?",
        "\r\n*************************************************************** ",
        "Jackie: This is beyond my \r\nworst nightmare. ",
        "Brooke: I know, I know. \r\nBut there isn't anything that nick wouldn't do. You know how determined he is. \r\nAnd I'm sure Massimo is moving heaven and earth to try and get you released. \r\nDon't worry, okay? Everything's going to be all right. Your family really does \r\nlove you. And there's nothing they wouldn't do. Nothing we wouldn't do. \n",
        "Ron: Ms. Marone? Will you \r\ncome with us, please? ",
        "Jackie: Where? Where are \r\nyou taking me? ",
        "Ron: To a holding cell.\r\n",
        "Agent #1: Let's go, ma'am.\r\n",
        "Jackie: What? No, Brooke. \r\nNo, tell Nicky to hurry! Tell Massimo! ",
        "Nick: Now I know you have \r\nfriends in the FBI who can straighten this thing out. The bigwig in DC you \r\ncalled when we were falsely accused, again because of Forrester. ",
        "Massimo: Even then, \r\nForrester was fighting for Brooke. He'll always fight for Brooke, Dominick. For \r\nhis family, which as it should be. That's the reason why I am telling you, stay \r\naway from Brooke. Let Ridge and Brooke be. ",
        "Nick: Are you playing \r\nmatchmaker with me? ",
        "Massimo: Why can't you \r\nunderstand something? I want your happiness every bit as much as I want Ridge's. \r\nBut if you continue down this path -- you lost Brooke once and it ripped your \r\nheart out. I don't want to see that happen to you again, son. And it will, \r\nunless you accept the fact that Brooke belongs to Ridge. ",
        "Nick: I will never accept \r\nthat. ",
        "Massimo: Yes you will! \r\nBecause this is about more than what you want! Please understand that. Ridge and \r\nBrooke have a son. A child that they wanted desperately. And this sweet little \r\nboy should be raised in a family with his own mother and father. You've got to \r\nrespect that, Dominick. ",
        "Nick: I did not come here \r\nfor a lecture. I came here because you're the most powerful man that I know. The \r\nsituation with Forrester is not why my mother is in jail. Or is it? ",
        "\r\n*************************************************************",
        "Agent #1: Step inside, \r\nma'am. ",
        "Ron: Not exactly all the \r\ncomforts of home, but it could be worse. At least you have some privacy for now. \r\nThough that'll change if you end up at the federal penitentiary. ",
        "[Jackie sighs] \n",
        "\r\n*************************************************************",
        "Nick: Turning a deaf ear? \r\nI won't go along with your demands so you're going to punish me by not helping \r\nmy mother out? Or is there more? You really wouldn't do something like this, \r\nwould you? Hurt my mother to show me who's in charge? Answer me! "
