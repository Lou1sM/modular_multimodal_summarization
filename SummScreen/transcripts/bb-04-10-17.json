{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7561 ~ Thomas is blindsided and heartbroken by Sally when she makes an abrupt change in their plans; the Spectra clan hit the jackpot when their plan of espionage finally pays off."], "Recap": ["Thomas convinces Sally to sit back down and they will discuss this. He tells her that she is so important to him but there is some reason she wants to run away from him and he does not get it. He wants to know what she is not telling him. Shirley laments to Saul that he has that going to give a lecture look. She knows he does not want Sally hanging around with Thomas any more than she does. He just does not want her to get her heart broken. Darlita is shocked when Coco comes in and Darlita is looking at who she thinks is her on the laptop at FC. She is finally straightened out by a confused Coco that she loaned the brooch to Maya. Shirley tells Saul that she is not talking about him but Thomas. There is one thing you can trust more than the wind and that is money. Sally asks Thomas if he has ever been rejected before. She doesn't think he should be hitting on other women. He should go back and hit on Caroline, the mother of his son. He says he did. He went out there and it was impossible and then he met Sally and all that confusion turned into laughter. When they are through with their hanky panky in the office, Rick shows Maya the newest Ridge designs and Shirley and Saul capture it all. She knows they can tweak them here and there and they will be pure Spectra. And Sally is breaking up with Thomas right now and she will be just as thrilled with these designs.", "Thomas tells Sally that he came back from New York and his little sister was handed the CEO position and he was overlooked, not even considered. He is just another cog in the wheel but he is not going to think about that now. She brings him so much happiness. She says she fell for him hard too but this is reality. He says he does not want her to like or do anything different, just be herself. He will always love his son and be in his life but they have something so special and nothing should stop them. Shirley tells Saul that stealing is not her way but this is business. Sally will love these designs. She tried but Maxwell shut her down so they will have to go back and do what Spectra has always done and get back on top. She knows Sally will shut this silly thing with Thomas in the past. Sally tells Thomas she has been wasting her time. She came here to get Spectra back on top. She is Sally Spectra, the one who fights and scratches to get on top, unlike the Forrester's. She will not be dependent on a man. He says he only wants what is best for her so trust him. She says she wishes she could trust him but she promised her grams that she would stay focused. He says she can do both. She does not have to cut him out. She says it was fun while it lasted but that is all it was \u0096 fun, so just go. He says he does not believe her but he does slowly leave, leaving her crying."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Thomas: Just come here. Sit down for one second. Let's just talk about this, okay? I should have told you about my son. I get that. I do. But is that really enough to make you want to walk away from this? Sally, I know you. I know what we have been building together. What else is going on?", "Sally: It's complicated.", "Thomas: It doesn't have to be complicated. Look, you are so important to me, and I want you -- I want you to, one day, be important to my son. But for some reason, that makes you want to run away from this. I-I don't get it. But -- but I can't let you walk away.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Bell dings]", "Shirley: What's with the look?", "Saul: What look? I'm not -- there's no -- You got a look like you're about to give me a lecture look.", "Saul: I know that we have to use the Forrester designs, but does sally really need to end things with Thomas?", "Shirley: What? Of course she has to end things with Thomas! I mean, we can't go on taking their designs and she's playing kissy-face with him. You kno-- let's just back this up a notch or two. You do not want sally hanging around with Thomas Forrester any more than I do.", "Saul: But what I want doesn't matter, 'cause sally genuinely likes him. Does she really need to get her heart broken in order for us to succeed?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Darlita: Oh, no. No, no, no, no! Coco! No! What are you doing?! Don't you let him sweet-talk you...just 'cause he's got that beautiful body.", "Coco: Hey, Darlita.", "Darlita: Oh, hey, coco. Coco! What are you -- how are you -- I thought you were at Forrester creations.", "Coco: Yeah. Yeah. I was. I had a great day.", "Darlita: Yeah? Uh, anything exciting happen?", "Darlita: Coco, you're here.", "Coco: Yeah.", "Darlita: Okay. Strange. Uh, there must be some kind of tape delay happening.", "Coco: What are you talking about?", "Darlita: Uh, nothing. How's rick?", "Coco: Forrester?", "Darlita: Yeah. You work with him a lot, right?", "Coco: Yeah. I mean, I work with pretty much everyone over there.", "Darlita: You know his wife is a model, right?", "Coco: Yeah. Yeah. Maya. I work with her, too. Although I'm not so sure she trusts me. I'm trying my best with her. I even loaned her my brooch today.", "Darlita: Wait. You loaned her your jewelry and then went right around and -- ohhh. You've loaned her your jewelry. Okay. Mm-hmm. That makes sense. Yeah. Uh, Rick's wife. Okay. Yeah. That explains so much.", "Coco: Oh. Okay. I-it does?", "Darlita: Trust me. It does.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Saul: As much as I do not want to admit it, sally and Thomas -- they have a certain chemistry. They are adorable. He seems to make her happy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: For the moment. May even last a week or two if we let nature take its course. But we don't have time. Men will always let you down in the end. No offense, but it's true. Men come, and they go. And right now, it is time for Thomas Forrester to go!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Trust me. Ending this is cleaner for both of us. It is better now than --", "Thomas: Than -- than when? Who says this has to end?", "Sally: I am thankful for the time that we spent together. I have never met a man like you. But you need to go be with your son, with his mother.", "Thomas: No, no, no. That's -- that's not -- I want to be with you. I can't believe you're ending this because you found out that I have a son. What aren't you telling me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: Darlita, don't take this the wrong way, but are you sure it's only soda in here?", "Darlita: I'm not drunk. Believe me, you'll know when I've been drinking.", "Coco: Okay. Okay. It's just between that confusing phone call and -- and now, honestly, I really don't know what you're talking about with the brooch and rick and Maya.", "Darlita: Well, I just think it's interesting that you loaned it to Maya. Oh, no.", "Coco: What?", "Darlita: You loaned it to Maya.", "Coco: Yeah. Is -- isn't that what we've been talking about? Is that a problem? No. No problem.", "Coco: Okay.", "Darlita: No problem at all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Wow.", "Maya: Hmm?", "Rick: New brooch?", "Maya: Oh! You know, it's coco's, actually. She let me borrow it.", "Rick: It's beautiful.", "Maya: Yeah. I should probably find her and give it back to her.", "Rick: Yeah. Tomorrow.", "Maya: Why?", "Rick: Because...we don't have much time before Lizzy's back from day care. And I want to make the most out of this time right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Saul: Why do you have to lump all men together? I don't let women down. I don't come and go.", "Shirley: Obviously, I'm not talking about you! I'm talking about a man who can sweep you off your feet!", "Saul: Ohh!", "Shirley: Sally needs to know what to focus on. She needs to learn what to trust. Believe me -- in this world, there's only one thing you can trust, and it ain't men. It's money.", "[Door opens]", "Darlita: Oh, my goodness. You won't believe what I just saw.", "Shirley: More designs?", "Darlita: No, no. Not designs -- coco. I mean, she was -- I mean, she wasn't -- well, of course she wasn't, but...wowzers. The heat.", "Saul: You're not making any sense.", "Darlita: A married man? It totally taught me off guard -- in shock.", "Shirley: Calm down. Tell us what this is all about.", "Darlita: [Sighs] Coco doesn't have the roach anymore.", "Shirley: We have roaches?!", "Darlita: No, not the bug kind -- the jewelry kind.", "Saul: The brooch.", "Shirley: Coco doesn't have the brooch? She's lost the brooch?", "Darlita: No. She gave it to, uh -- to that model Maya, rick Forrester's wife.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: You have got some ego, don't you?", "Thomas: [Scoffs] Excuse me?", "Sally: You've never been rejected before. Look, when a girl says she isn't feeling it, she isn't feeling it.", "Thomas: Okay. Now I know there's something going on because you're outright lying to me. I know you're feeling everything that I am right now.", "Sally: Maybe what I'm feeling is pity for your son that his father should stop hitting on other women and go try and make it work with the mother of his child.", "Thomas: As much as I care about Caroline, and I always will, our relationship was never ideal. There's a lot of complicated things that I cannot go into right now. I had just come back from new York. I had just come back from confusion and disappointment. I went out there to try and make it work with Caroline, and it was just impossible. And then I met you. And all that -- that confusion and disappointment -- it turned into laughter. I thought that I knew what I wanted. I didn't. Not until I met you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: Coco doesn't have the brooch?", "Darlita: Nope.", "Saul: Maya does? Maya Forrester? Now, what if she finds out there's a camera inside of it?", "Darlita: I was worried about that, too, but the thing is I don't think she's exactly thinking about jewelry right now.", "Shirley: Okay. What is she thinking about?", "Darlita: Her sexy husband.", "Saul: What?", "Shirley: How could you possibly know that?", "Darlita: See for yourself. But you should know it's not exactly rated pg.", "Shirley: They're -- they're -- oh, my God!", "Darlita: I know. I know!", "Shirley: It's more designs!", "Darlita: What?", "Saul: What?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Oh, it's beautiful.", "Rick: Yeah. My dad -- he's got some skills. And, uh...this one here is Ridge's.", "Maya: Wow.", "Rick: Uh-huh. I'll have to admit, he's got talent from time to time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Both chuckle]", "Shirley: He's moving them too fast.", "Darlita: I'll grab my phone.", "Shirley: Hurry!", "Saul: No, no, no, wait. I can screen-capture these.", "Shirley: Ooh. We have hit the mother lode. This is it.", "Darlita: Ooh! Those are stunning.", "Shirley: I like them both. Soon-to-be spectra originals. Saul, you need to print them up, give a little tweak here, a little tweak there, and these Forrester designs will be pure spectra.", "Saul: But wait. No, no, no. What about sally?", "Shirley: What about her?", "Saul: She and Thomas are --", "Shirley: She is breaking up with him as we speak. She will be just as excited about these designs as we are. At least she better be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: We wouldn't work out, Thomas -- not in the long run. We are way too different I don't fit in with your crowd.", "Thomas: Right. I don't, either.", "Sally: Yeah, right.", "Thomas: As a kid, I never fit in. It made me act out at times. And as an adult, it's just overwhelming. I came back from New York to see my little sister appointed C.E.O. I was overlooked again. I was never even seriously considered once. So, that old sinking feeling in my gut came creeping back in. Where do I fit in? Where do I fit in my family, my company? And just as all that anger was starting to consume me, I meet you. And, suddenly, all that bitterness starts to melt away, and I'm not as frustrated that Steffy's been C.E.O. Or that granddad and dad just look at me as another cog in the wheel. Why should I worry about any of that when you bring me so much happiness?", "Sally: I do that for you? [Sighs] Look, Thomas, okay? I fell for you. I fell for you hard, which is why this is not easy for me. We had a good run. But it is reality-check time. You need to go to your son, to his mother. Go to where people pretend to like caviar, because I like pigs in a blanket, thank you very much.", "Thomas: Then like what you like. I don't want you to do anything different. I don't want you to like anything different. I just want you to be you -- crazy, outrageous, beautiful you. Sally, my son is my son, and I will always love him. But you can't let him get in the way of this. We have something so special. I can't let it end. Reviving spectra is her dream.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Saul: But steal", "Shirley: Ohh! This is it, Saul. Keeps the company afloat.", "Saul: If sally goes along with it.", "Shirley: Oh, she will. Reviving spectra is her dream.", "Saul: But stealing -- it's not her way.", "Shirley: It's not my way, either. It's not! It's business. [Sighs] Sally took a stab at legitimate design, but it was a flop, thanks to that Jarrett Maxwell. [Sighs] But you know what? She tried. And now...we're just gonna have to go back and do things the old-fashioned way, the way we used to do them at spectra -- a little dirty and a little underhanded. But we will bring spectra back to the top. [Sighs] We'll get these designs, with a little tweak. [Sighs] The designs, the runway show, and voil\u00e0 -- we are back on top. Success.", "Saul: Let's just hope that sally's on board, because this whole situation with Thomas --", "Shirley: Sally will commit. She'll put this silly relationship with Thomas Forrester in the past.", "Saul: Break her heart, you mean.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: If I knew how to do this, I would.", "Thomas: Do what? Be with me?", "Sally: Be with you...while... being at spectra.", "Thomas: Do you really think that I'm that shallow, that I'm concerned about your last name being spectra or that I think I should be with Caroline because her last name is Spencer?", "Sally: I think if we pursue this, you're gonna end up regretting it, that you will wonder why you took a chance on me when you could have the safety of a classy, sophisticated socialite waiting for you in new York.", "Thomas: But I want to take that chance.", "Sally: I came to los Angeles with my grandmother to do a job -- to get spectra fashions back on its feet, and what have I been doing? Wasting my time daydreaming about you and kissing you. My God. I even went all the way to Australia. Really? What was I thinking, chasing you like that?", "Thomas: You were having fun. You were living a dream that is worth living.", "Sally: No. Wrapped up in your life and your world, thinking that I could be a part of it.", "Thomas: You are a part of it.", "Sally: No. I am sally spectra, the one who fights and scrounges, who will risk everything just for a glimmer of what you Forresters naturally are born with. Do you really think I could be a part of your world? The luxury, the private jets, and the mansions, a child in new York city, a high-paying fashion job in los Angeles, rich and powerful friends in every single country -- that is not me.", "Thomas: It could be.", "Sally: Yeah, someday, perhaps, if I make it happen. Not because I'm latched on to you. I will not be dependent on a man.", "Thomas: Don't be dependent on me? Can you just trust me, please, that I-I want the best for you? Trust me.", "Sally: Trust? Really? Trust, Thomas? Who can you trust in this world? Look, okay? I really wish things could be different. But I promised my grandmother that I would stay focused.", "Thomas: So focus. I completely support you in that, and I promise, sally, I won't invite you to any more events for the next two, three months, max. That's all I can take. Sally, you don't have to cut me out in order to succeed at spectra. You can do both.", "Sally: What is wrong with you? Do you have wax in your ears? Have you never been rejected before? Look, I know there's a first time for everything. It stings. But you will get over it, okay? Just go. Go live your life.", "Thomas: You don't mean that.", "Sally: Yes. Yes, I do, Thomas, okay? There is no future here. Come on. Why the face? Really? Go. Go, okay? Go hit the gym. You probably lost part of your 8-pack sitting in this Italian joint, soaking up all of the carbs anyway. I don't want you anymore. Okay? It was fun while it lasted, but it was what it was, but that's all that it will ever be. Just go, okay? Go and live your fancy life. Bye.", "Thomas: I don't believe you.", "Sally: Goodbye, Thomas. Ciao. Sayonara. I don't -- I don't -- is there any other way I can say it? I don't know.", "Sally: Goodbye.
