        "Brooke tells Rick that she is back with Bill. She wasn't sure how he'd react. He's just glad it wasn't Ridge or that she is trying to make Ridge jealous. Wyatt tells Hope that they may be having a baby and he's okay with that. He would never leave her. She's a little stressed as she always thought some day she would get married and have a baby but this was not planned. He says life happens. He says pregnancy is only a problem if she is ashamed of it. This doesn't have to change her HFTF message or her line. Liam finds the pregnancy receipt that fell from Hope's purse. While Bill calls it blackmail for not telling Brooke about Quinn and Quinn calls it a favor, she wants Bill to give Wyatt the Spencer name. He's earned it and she thinks it would make him very happy. Bill says he will consider it. She offers him another romp for old times sake. She has the handcuffs in her purse. He says he will pass.",
        "Bill throws his bag into Brooke's bedroom; he says it is moving day. They marvel at how both Hope and Liam took the news so well. Just as Hope is about to go take the pregnancy test, Liam bursts into the room and asks what the test says. Wyatt tells the dude to leave. They are in the middle of this. Liam says it affects him too. Hope says Liam can stay; she will be right back. Liam stares down Wyatt. He can't believe this is happening. And he hopes Wyatt did not trick Hope into this. Wyatt denies he did anything to trick her. Hope takes the test and comes back into the room to give them the results."

        "Wyatt: You think that you're... you're that late? Like...pregnant late?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Maybe. I-I don't know. But, Wyatt, I've never been late before. Um... I bought a test.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Okay. Wow.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Wyatt, our lives might be changing soon.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Hope Logan. No, no, no, no, no. She can't be.",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rick: Knock, knock.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Rick. I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Rick: I am so sorry. I had to come over a little bit early. Madison scheduled this conference call for me, and I got to get to the office.",
        "Brooke: If you need your V.P., I can just throw on some clothes.",
        "Rick: Uh, no, no, actually, I-I'm -- I'm fine. Unless, of course, you wanted to go to the jabot fashion show. That's what this is about. It's timetables and logistics...",
        "Brooke: I know. And I know how excited Caroline is to feature her designs in Genoa city.",
        "Rick: And the potential of a synergy between the two lines. I know, I know -- this is not something that Ridge would approve, thinking outside the box. I'm sorry. What was your big news? What did you want to talk to me about?",
        "Brooke: Well...um...",
        "Rick: Is something wrong?",
        "Brooke: I don't think so. But you might. I'm back with Bill.",
        "Bill: So here we go. Blackmail.",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Bill: You'll keep silent as long as I grant you a wish. Now, I'm familiar with blackmail, and that's what it sounds like.",
        "Quinn: Well, when you put it that way...",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I am not a genie, and I don't grant wishes.",
        "Quinn: Mm. This one, you will.",
        "Bill: Oh, you're gonna tell Brooke what happened between us?",
        "Rick: You're back together with Bill.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Are you upset?",
        "Rick: Mm...if you would have told me Ridge, probably. [Sighs] Are you sure about this?",
        "Brooke: Yes, honey.",
        "Rick: 'Cause I just -- I don't think it's healthy if it's some kind of ploy to -- to make Ridge jealous.",
        "Brooke: No. Gosh, no. He's with Katie now. It's always somebody else -- somebody who can tell him how horrible I am. I did that for way too long with Taylor. I'm not doing it with my little sister. I deserve a man who I don't have to share with anybody else.",
        "Bill: Go ahead. Tell Brooke.",
        "Quinn: About our little romp in bed? No, you don't want me doing that.",
        "Bill: I'll tell her myself and beat you to it.",
        "Quinn: Oh, brave man. But you know she'll be full of crying and accusations. It's so much simpler to bury it, pretend like it never happened.",
        "Bill: Okay. What is it you want?",
        "Quinn: You know that the most important thing in my life has always been our son.",
        "Bill: Right. Well aware.",
        "Quinn: And I would do anything for him.",
        "Bill: You lied to him about me. Now that I know he exists, if you think I'm gonna stay out of his life, you're out of your mind.",
        "Quinn: Give him your name.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Quinn: Make Wyatt a Spencer.",
        "[Speed-dialing]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Hope. Hey, it's me. Can you call me back? I need to see you. You're not pregnant. Not by him.",
        "Wyatt: You could seriously be pregnant. With A... with a baby. Our baby. Huh.",
        "Hope: I'm not the only one freaking out, right? 'Cause I'm -- I'm not alone in that I'm freaking out?",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no, no. You're not alone in that. Um...",
        "Wyatt: I mean, you won't be. You know -- alone. I would never, ever...",
        "Hope: I know. Wyatt, I know. I know. You would be... a really great dad.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: You'd be committed, and, you know, you would be the dad that I never had growing up. Or, you know, the one that you never had, for that matter. And now I'm feeling stupid. I'm feeling really stupid for talking about this possibility.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no. Hope, hope, hope, hope, we had to. We had to. We might be parents soon.",
        "Brooke: Thank you for understanding. I wasn't sure how you'd react.",
        "Rick: Well, I've had my issues with Bill. Who hasn't? But he is Caroline's uncle, and I'm doing my best to -- to get along with him for her sake. But he's also proven his commitment to you in ways that Ridge never has. You're making the right decision, mom.",
        "Quinn: It's Wyatt's rightful name.",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: I kept it from him for so long, but now that he knows about you, it feels right to let him acknowledge who he is.",
        "Bill: Even if it makes you cringe.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Oh, I used to be so bitter. I would drive by your billboards or see your magazines at the supermarket. I swore I would protect him and never let you near him. But...I don't cringe anymore.",
        "Bill: So I won you over with my charming personality?",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Hardly. No, actually, it was something you said to me at thanksgiving that stuck with me. You wanted me to know the father you are now versus the one you would have been then. You were a cruel, disgusting man. \"Boy,\" I should say. But today, you're not the father that you would have been then. I mean, you're no Ward cleaver, but I do know you care about your sons.",
        "Bill: I would have cared about him then, too. Regardless of the way I acted when you told me you were pregnant.",
        "Quinn: I kept my son from knowing half of who he was. And that wasn't fair. I'd like to give him the chance to be a Spencer -- if that's what he wants. I-I don't know if he will. [Chuckles] I can't believe I'm coming to you with this.",
        "Bill: Well, I can't believe you came to me with a whip.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Well, it's our little secret. Just give our son your name. He's proud to be your kid. The other day, somebody called him Mr. Spencer right in front of me, and the way his face lit up, like he wanted it to be true... I want to make it true.",
        "Bill: You know, uh, I like us getting along like this. Never thought I could trust you, let alone forgive you for keeping my son from me. But I believe your offer is sincere. So maybe it's time to make it official with Wyatt. I'll consider it.",
        "Quinn: Thanks. You know, I was starting to like spending time with you.",
        "Bill: We're Wyatt's parents. We'll be spending some time together.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] You know what I mean.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Oh. Uh, right. Um...that was fun.",
        "Quinn: You know, I...did happen to bring a pair of handcuffs with me in my purse, so...I don't know. You want to have one more romp? What do you say? Old times' sake? I mean, since we're keeping it a secret, what difference does it make?",
        "Bill: Pass.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Well, I'm gonna miss you. And your little sword.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Pam: Forrester creations.",
        "Liam: Hey, donna?",
        "Pam: Seriously?",
        "Liam: Sorry. Sorry. Pam. Um, I need to speak to hope. Is she there?",
        "Pam: You need to buy me a dozen roses, Liam, thinking that I was --",
        "Liam: Is she there?",
        "Pam: Who? Donna?",
        "Liam: No -- hope.",
        "Pam: Well, yes, but, Liam, I'm not kidding. That was re--",
        "[Dial tone]",
        "Hope: I've been careful, right? I mean, I thought I had. I thought we'd been careful.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, I guess nothing's ever 100% effective.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Abstinence. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Come on.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Oh, God. \"Hope for the Future.\"",
        "Wyatt: What about it?",
        "Hope: My message. All of those speeches that I have made to all these young women about making the right choice for themselves, and what are they gonna say when I'm presenting my next line in maternity clothes? And Aly -- Aly's gonna flip out.",
        "Wyatt: Hope! Your message was never about abstinence. It was about girls making the right choices for themselves.",
        "Hope: And pregnancy is mine?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: Sorry. It's... you know that I want a family someday -- someday. It's important to me. It's something that I've always looked forward to. I just didn't think that it would happen now, you know, when my career is just taking off and... I, essentially, just got out of a relationship with Liam. I'm sorry. I know you don't want to hear that, but... I like you. I like being with you. I do. But we don't have a commitment. And I always pictured myself being married first. And, you know, my husband and I would spend a couple years traveling and building our careers and then... and then baby. I just didn't expect this. I didn't expect it to be thrust upon me like this. Oh, God, I... I don't want you to misconstrue what I'm saying. I...",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Hope: You know that I would love this child and I would love a life with you. It just, uh... it just isn't what I planned.",
        "Bill: Look out, ladies and gents! It's moving day.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Oh, you're here! [Laughs] Oh! Mm. So, did you tell Liam?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Of course I did. A-and he was deliriously happy for us. Well, he -- he approves, anyway. And -- and, uh, hope was there, and much to my surprise, she was very mature about the idea.",
        "Brooke: And Rick, too. He's being very supportive. He thinks I'm making the right decision.",
        "Bill: Well, there you go. Everybody's on board the b and b train.",
        "Brooke: The B and B -- oh, Brooke and Bill. That's cute. All aboard.",
        "Bill: You sure you're ready for this, now?",
        "Brooke: To tame the wild stallion?",
        "Bill: [Neighs]",
        "Brooke: [Laughing] Yee-haw.",
        "Wyatt: I know it's not what we planned, but life happens.",
        "Hope: [Scoffs] Literally. Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm such a mess right now. I don't...mean to be. I'm sorry. I just... the timing of this is, you know...",
        "Wyatt: Okay. [Sighs] The one thing that you should not be worried about right now is your line.",
        "Hope: But it's selling so well right now.",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Hope: And the boost from your jewelry has been really amazing. It's... you haven't been here. You have not seen what my personal life can do to damage my line.",
        "Wyatt: No. But a pregnancy is only a problem if you're ashamed of it. So we show the fans the happiness that it brings, how excited we are to be together and the excitement we have for this adventure together. And it'll all be okay. All right? I-it doesn't affect your line one bit. And it certainly doesn't change your message.",
        "Hope: [Sniffles]",
        "Wyatt: The question is... are we having a baby?",
        "Hope: You ready to find out?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I love you.",
        "Liam: Where is she?",
        "Pam: [Gasps] Give me a heart attack, why don't you?",
        "Liam: Sorry. Sorry, Pam. I-I need to speak to hope. Please. It's important.",
        "Pam: Okay. She's in Rick's office.",
        "Hope: Okay. [Sighs] Be right back.",
        "Wyatt: All right.",
        "Liam: Hope? Oh, my God. How are you? Are you okay?",
        "Hope: Liam, hi.",
        "Wyatt: We're kind of in the middle of something here, bro, okay?",
        "Liam: What did the test say? Are you pregnant?",
        "Wyatt: Leave -- now.",
        "Liam: Are you pregnant?",
        "Hope: How did you know that?",
        "Wyatt: Dude, I'm telling you, just get out of here.",
        "Hope: This -- this is between me and Wyatt, okay? That's it.",
        "Liam: Hope, you're the one thing I care about more than anything in this world. This affects me, too, and you know that. You can tell me.",
        "Hope: I don't -- I don't know.",
        "Liam: Come on, hope. I can take it. Just --",
        "Hope: Liam, I really don't know. I don't know.",
        "Wyatt: She's about to take the test right now. So could you leave us alone?",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Hope: Guys, please.",
        "Wyatt: All right. What do you want us to do?",
        "Hope: Um... you can both stay. I'll be right back.",
        "Wyatt: All right.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Bill: I have been waiting for this... feels like forever.",
        "Brooke: Moving in?",
        "Bill: No, not just that. The way you're looking at me. Knowing you believe in us again.",
        "Brooke: Thank you for being patient.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, that was a stretch for me, but... I know it was hard for you, giving me a second chance.",
        "Brooke: You don't have to say --",
        "Bill: I didn't -- I didn't want a life without you, the only woman who accepted me for who I was. I was desperate to have us work out, and I should have just trusted that it would. I didn't do that. You know, in business, I manipulate situations to have them work out the way I want them to. But with you, I just have to trust. I'm home.",
        "Liam: I can't believe this is happening. If she is pregnant...",
        "Wyatt: If she is pregnant, then that is between her and me. What are you even doing here, anyway?",
        "Liam: I, uh... I found a receipt outside my door and picked it up. It was for a pregnancy test.",
        "Wyatt: Maybe it was meant to be.",
        "Wyatt: A trick? Are you serious? I don't have to trick or trap her into anything. And if she is pregnant, I love her. I would be a much better husband and father than you would ever be.",
        "Liam: Oh, shut up. Shut -- shut up. I can't believe this is happening to her.",
        "Wyatt: It's out of our hands now, man.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: You took it?",
        "Liam: Hope, what does it say?"
