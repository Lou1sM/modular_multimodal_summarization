        "Steffy is devastated that Quinn had Liam all this time and took advantage of him. He says no, she was taking care of him and told him that she was his wife. But she will be turned over to the police now. He does not want to talk about it and wants just to get on with his life with Steffy and put this past them. She argues that she was there waiting for him the day he apparently lost his memory. She was ready to continue their life but he never showed up. Wyatt and Bill find the closet door in the cabin to be broken into and no Quinn. Sasha tells Julius she has every reason to be happy at Forrester. She works there and is dating the son of a Forrester. She knows Nicole is sad but he can take some pleasure that she is his daughter too and is happy. Sasha says she knows how lucky she is to be with Zende and he broke it off with Nicole. He made that decision and she is not going to let him go. Nicole tells Maya and Rick that she did this for them and Zende is the one who moved on. They do not have to feel badly about that.",
        "Lt. Baker comes in and gets all the details that Bill and Wyatt can give him. Liam tells Steffy that he is sorry. All he remembers is waking up at the cabin. He does not know how he got there. And he knows Quinn hates him but it is sick for her to pretend they were married while taking care of him. He wonders what she wants. Steffy remembers what Quinn said at her wedding to Wyatt that all was worth it. While eating his hotdog, Lt. Baker says he will need to speak with Liam. Bill says he will arrange that. Liam wonders if Quinn was packing up the house if she was planning to kill him and move away. He thanks Wyatt for finding him and bringing him home. He hugs him and says he wants to find Quinn so he can find out why she did this. But it is clear that Wyatt saved his life. Now he just wants to be alone with his fiance. Sasha continues to berate Julius for favoring Nicole and not accepting her as his daughter too. He says he has looked out for her his entire life and this is the way she repays him by hurting his other daughter. Zende walks in before they are through and he tries to apologize to Julius for breaking up with Nicole. Sasha jumps in and says but at least he is dating her now and Julius is cool with that. Julius makes a quick exit. Maya tells Nicole that Sasha stabbed her in the back and Zende is not with her because she is prettier or not pregnant. Sasha tries to turn Zende on right there in the office but he pulls away and says he cannot do this. She recommends that he go home as Caroline and Ridge will be wrapped up in their new baby and he can have the house all to himself. Wyatt is shocked to hear Steffy say she is going to stay with Liam for now. He is fragile and she could not break it to him in just one sentence that she is married to Wyatt. Liam tells Steffy that he is so grateful to be home .and with the woman he loves."

        "Liam: I didn't know who she was, Steffy. I had no memory. I just -- I thought -- I thought she was taking care of me.",
        "Steffy: She locked you away all this time. She took advantage of you.",
        "Liam: Well, she didn't get away with it. She's gonna be arrested, and she's going to jail.",

        "Bill: What happened to the doors?",
        "Wyatt: I did that.",
        "Bill: Closet?",
        "Wyatt: Up there. I got to find the keys.",
        "Bill: What do you mean you have to find the keys?",
        "Wyatt: I got find the keys!",
        "Bill: That's great. Wyatt. Empty closet.",
        "Wyatt: No!",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Mom? Mom! Okay, I-I don't know how she could have gotten out of there.",
        "Bill: She's out.",
        "Wyatt: What is that, seaweed? Okay, what the hell is happening?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: We scheduled a pregnancy massage for you tomorrow.",
        "Rick: We know you've been dealing with a lot lately.",
        "Nicole: That's really sweet of you guys. But I keep telling you not to worry.",
        "Maya: We just want you to be as happy and as excited about this baby as we are. It's coming close. You're so big now. [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Big as a house. Just like dad said.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: [Chuckles]",
        "Julius: Well, you've made yourself quite comfortable here at Forrester.",
        "Sasha: I work here. I'm a model, and I'm dating the C.E.O.'s nephew. I have every right to feel at home here.",
        "Julius: And Nicole is miserable.",
        "Sasha: I'll bet. She's blown up like a balloon.",
        "Julius: That's not what I meant. Nicole is miserable because she lost Zende. Listen, it's very simple. When my daughter's not happy, I'm not happy.",
        "Sasha: I'm your daughter, too, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Is there something else you need?",
        "Rick: All you have to do is ask us.",
        "Nicole: No. There's nothing. Nothing except Zende. I miss him a lot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: You know, I should have known better. I don't even know why I bother.",
        "Sasha: Okay. One of your daughters is sad. And I'm sorry about that. I really am. But your other daughter has never been happier. Can't you take any pleasure in that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Good, because you do not want me to find her myself.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Bill: Police are close.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, it might be too late. Mom's car is gone.",
        "Bill: She can't run away from this. What? Well, if we didn't know it already, Wyatt, your mother is completely out of her mind.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, I agree with you. I don't think she has any idea what she's doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I don't want to talk about Quinn. I mean, I -- I'm home. Can we just... can we just put this -- this nightmare behind us and -- and move on with our life together? Can we do that?",
        "Steffy: Liam, you said you lost your memory.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I mean, it's -- it's coming back, piece by piece, but --",
        "Steffy: Liam, no. The day that you went missing, I was here. I was waiting for you. All you had to do was just come home and then we would have just continued our life together. But you never showed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Honey, I am so sorry.",
        "Nicole: I don't want you to be sorry. I did this for you, to make you happy.",
        "Rick: But if you're hurting, we want to help.",
        "Nicole: There's nothing to do. Zende's already moved on. He's with Sasha now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: I did not ruin Nic and Zende's relationship.",
        "Julius: Sasha, you don't fool me, not one bit. You have taken -- which I agree was Nicole's bad decision -- and turned it in to an opportunity for your own personal gain.",
        "Sasha: No. No. Stop. Do not make me out to be the bad guy. Zende is not a conquest.",
        "Julius: How do you live with yourself? Nicole gave you everything -- everything. And you take from her the one thing that meant more to her than anything.",
        "Sasha: Zende turned to me because I appreciate him. And trust me, I know how lucky I am to be with him, to be with a guy who finally actually cares about me. And I didn't want it to be Nicole's ex, but that's just the way it worked out. And, yes, he is drop-dead gorgeous, but more than that, he comes from a good family.",
        "Julius: [Scoffs]",
        "Sasha: He's a real gentleman. He's a guy who could actually love me. Nic made her decision, and Zende made his. And he is everything to me now, and I am not letting him go.",

        "[Police radio chatter]",
        "Lt. Baker: So, what do we have so far?",
        "Man: We've got the boxes labeled.",
        "Bill: All right. You got my son's eyewitness account. Quinn kidnapped Liam and held him here all this time. Now, you better find her before I do and lock her ass up.",
        "Lt. Baker: We've already issued an APB. If she's on the move, we'll catch her. Now, you said that you locked her in this closet. She escaped from here. You and your brother locked her in this?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Lt. Baker: Anything else? What you got?",
        "Wyatt: Photo albums, or what's left of them.",
        "Lt. Baker: [Sighs] You're not kidding. Well, what about this kelp? Is this, um, evidence or is it just your mother's eclectic decor?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, that, I don't know. That wasn't here before.",
        "Lt. Baker: Bag it.",
        "Wyatt: So, am I good? I mean, uh, you already have my statement. I mean, if you have any questions, please feel free to call me, but, uh, I think I should get back to my brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I was so certain that you would show up. That's all you had to do. And when you didn't, I...",
        "Liam: I'm sorry.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] It's not your fault.",
        "Liam: All I remember is waking up at the cabin. That's it.",
        "Steffy: Do you remember how you got there?",
        "Liam: No, that's still a blank. I mean, what the -- what the Hell?! Did Quinn -- did she attack me? I mean, why -- why would -- why would Quinn do that? I mean, I know she hates me. I know how much she hates me, but to -- to -- to hold me hostage and to tell me that she's my wife? That's -- that's sick. Even for her, that -- that's sick. She had to know that I would get my memory back. She had to know I-I would know who she was. Why keep it up? What did she want?",
        "[Steffy's flashback]",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, you've always been my priority. There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you. I've given you every opportunity I can think of, and standing here right now, I know that it has all been worth it.",
        "[Present time]",
        "Liam: Why did she do this to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You did have your reservations about Sasha. You didn't want them working together.",
        "Nicole: I don't blame Zende for breaking up with me. I saw how he reacted every time the baby came up. I just was hoping we'd get through it.",
        "Maya: And maybe you would have if Sasha hadn't gotten involved.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] Look, Zende was honest about his feelings from the very beginning. He never wanted any of this for us. He did his best to accept it, and he -- he just couldn't. I can't be angry with him for that. Or for being with Sasha. I mean, what man wouldn't want to be with her? She's gorgeous, she's fun, and she's not pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: Why can't you just support me?",
        "Julius: Because what you're doing to Nicole is unconscionable.",
        "Sasha: You know, you barely accept Maya for who she is. And now her sister is carrying her brother-in-law's child. [Chuckles] And yet, somehow, I'm still the disappointment? What is so wrong with me?",
        "Julius: You don't want me to answer that. You just want me to feel bad for you.",
        "Sasha: Can you just love me for me? Or am I forever the love child who was born of the \"wrong mother?\" Forget what people might think. Forget -- forget what Viv might think. Can't you just -- can you just see your daughter and love me for me?",
        "Julius: I've taken care of you your whole life. But what you're doing to Nicole -- it's just wrong. It's foul. It's not necessary.",
        "Zende: Oh, uh, sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Julius: No problem, Zende. I'm just leaving.",
        "Zende: Mr. Avant. Look, I know you're upset with me because I'm not with your daughter anymore.",
        "Sasha: Yes, you are.",
        "Zende: What? What do you mean?",
        "Sasha: I mean you see her at work and when there's family get-togethers.",
        "Zende: Yeah. No, Nicole is still very much a part of my life. I'd like it if we could be friends.",
        "Julius: I don't think that's very likely.",
        "Sasha: And the fact that we're dating probably makes it even harder. It's okay. Mr. Avant knows. And you're cool with it, right, Mr. Avant?",
        "Julius: If you'll excuse me, I have to go.",
        "Zende: [Sighs] I don't think he's okay with it.",
        "Sasha: Well, I mean, he didn't let you have it, did he?",
        "Zende: I just don't want anyone blaming you for my breakup with Nicole.",
        "Sasha: Look at you. You're so protective of me. You really know how to let a lady know how much she's appreciated. And now I want to show you how much I appreciate you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lt. Baker: I'm gonna need to speak to Liam.",
        "Bill: I'll arrange it.",
        "Lt. Baker: What do you think?",
        "Man: Might make a tasty relish.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Lt. Baker: Yep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I mean, wh-what was her plan, exactly? 'Cause she had me pack up the house, so... was she gonna kill me?",
        "Steffy: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.",
        "Liam: Was she gonna...",
        "Steffy: Take it easy.",
        "Liam: ...Leave me some...",
        "Steffy: Take it easy. I got you. Come on.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Okay. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: You, uh, need a hand?",
        "Steffy: No, he's -- he's all right. He's all right.",
        "Liam: Just, uh...worn out.",
        "Wyatt: It's been a Hell of a day for you, bro.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, he's a little foggy on everything.",
        "Liam: I-I got to tell you. I-I-I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't found me. Thank you for bringing me home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Zende isn't with Sasha because she's prettier than you.",
        "Nicole: I know it's more complicated than that.",
        "Maya: Yeah, it's disgusting. She stabbed you in the back. And you think of her as a sister. How could she do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: Sasha, listen. Look, what you said to Mr. Avant about the two of us --",
        "Sasha: He already knew about us.",
        "Zende: Okay.",
        "Sasha: Look, I want you so bad.",
        "Zende: We are at the office.",
        "Sasha: That just makes it even hotter.",
        "Zende: Okay, look. Look, stop. Not here, okay? Not like this. Right? Not in between meetings, not with a locked door, all right? Sasha, I want to make love to you.",
        "Sasha: The way you say that, it just -- it just makes me realize how special you are.",
        "Zende: Look, I don't want to rush this. I have a meeting, okay?",
        "Sasha: Well, I want to see you later.",
        "Zende: When I'm done, I'm going home.",
        "Sasha: And with Ridge and Caroline all wrapped up in that new baby, I bet it's like having the house to yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I'll get you some water.",
        "Wyatt: Listen, Liam, uh, there's no real easy way to say this. I got some bad news for you. Mom got away.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: What? How?",
        "Wyatt: I-I don't know. The closet was empty when we got there, and her car was gone.",
        "Liam: I can't believe it.",
        "Wyatt: Look, don't worry. The cops are gonna find her. She won't get away with this, all right?",
        "Liam: When they catch her, I want them to ask her why she did it. You know... if you hadn't found me, I really might have disappeared forever, 'cause I had no idea who I was. I didn't know what was real. You gave me my life back. I can't thank you enough, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Uh, well, you're welcome. [Chuckles] Uh, is there anything else you need? Anything I can do?",
        "Liam: Honestly, right now, I just kind of want to be alone with my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Steffy: I'll -- I'll show you out.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Let's do that.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: We have to tell him we're married.",
        "Steffy: He's still fragile. I just -- I don't want to hit him with everything all at once.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] [Sighs] So, what do you want to do?",
        "Steffy: I'm gonna stay here.",
        "Wyatt: I'm sorry?",
        "Steffy: I just need to make sure he's okay.",
        "Wyatt: But you're coming home, right? You're coming home right after?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah, of course.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Okay. Call me if you need anything.",
        "Steffy: Okay. How are you feeling?",
        "Liam: I don't know. I, um -- I know I should be furious with Quinn. I am furious. I -- [Chuckles] I am. But...mostly what I feel right now is relief. I'm just happy to be home... and with the woman I love."
