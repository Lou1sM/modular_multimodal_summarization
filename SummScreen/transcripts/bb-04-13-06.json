        "Nick paces the halls outside of Jackie's bail hearing. Brooke tells him everything will be all right and Jackie will be released today. First thing Ridge sees when he gets off the elevator is Brooke and Nick huddled chest to chest. He tells Massimo he thought he was going to do something about THAT. He declares he is. Obviously not fast enough for Ridge. Mass rebukes him that Jacqueline has brought enough shame to the family; he's not going to have brother against brother fighting at the courthouse. He dismisses Ridge to leave it to him; he'll call him soon. Ridge declares either this gets settled soon or he'll handle it his way. Jackie is led in and Massimo manages to talk to her as they both spy the lovebirds being not that discreet in public. He warns her this must stop. And she proposes he is treating Brooke like she is a piece of property. And she vows that she will never stand between her son and Brooke. Bridget tells Dante she hopes people don't think she is being uncaring or insensitive, but she misses Dino so much. Dante says that Felicia chose them to be the parents and that is exactly what they are going to do. Felicia flirts with her Doctor Ramirez and he tells her she is the best patient he has ever had. He tells her he is pretty good with razors himself and he'd be happy to be her stylist if she needs more assistance. Jackie meets her attorney, Mr. McCoy, first time in court which is held in the Judge's chambers. Charges are read of which Jackie claims all are false. Mass comes forward with the grand gesture that because she is the mother of his son he'd like to post bail, no matter how high it is. The prosecutor calls her a flight risk and asks that bail be denied. Everyone starts talking at once and chaos ensues. Felicia lets the Doc shear her head and he tells her she looks beautiful. They share a sweet kiss. Massimo demands again that the court set bail as high as they want and he will be responsible for it, but he will not stand by one more night and watch Jackie spend the night in jail. Bridget and Dante come to take Dino home and they're stunned when Felicia announces this is where he's living now. Mass seems to pull his attention aside when Jackie's sordid past with criminal, Deacon Sharpe, is mentioned at the hearing. Jackie resorts to standing and begging the court not to deny her bail; she won't go anywhere."

        "Felicia: No offense, Doc, but being close to Dominick again is the best medicine.",

        "Christian: You got me all figured out.",
        "Felicia: If it weren't for you -- and for my mother, of course -- I wouldn't have this time with my son. And I'm gonna make the most of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Oh, Nicky.",
        "Nick: Not another night in here. Mother, this is Peter Mccoy, he's going to be your defense attorney.",
        "Peter: Ms. Marone, we're gonna get you out of here.",
        "Jackie: Well, I appreciate you hiring the very best defense attorney in L.A., But this shouldn't be complicated. I mean, I have done nothing wrong. They have made a very bad mistake.",
        "Nick: All right, mother, just take it easy. We'll get it all straightened out.",
        "Peter: Prosecutor Gilmore doesn't charge someone unless she thinks she can get a conviction.",
        "Jackie: But I haven't done anything. Why does nobody em to believe that?",
        "Brooke: We do.",
        "Nick: It's your job to prove it to the judge, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christian: I know how much you love your son, but I've noticed something else. Bridget loves this baby very much, too. Almost as if he's her own.",
        "Felicia: She recently miscarried, late term -- a little girl. Nicole. The plan was that I was gonna keep an eye on Nicole in heaven while she took care of Dominick down here. But that's when you make god laugh, right? When you tell him your plan? [Phone rings] Good morning, Bridget.",
        "Bridget: Hey, I hope it's not too early to call.",
        "Felicia: Not at all.",
        "Bridget: Well, I just wanted to see how everything went last night. Did it go okay?",
        "Felicia: Couldn't have gone better.",
        "Bridget: Oh, well, I'm glad. Dino had had a couple of late nights, so I wasn't sure how he'd sleep.",
        "Felicia: Through the night.",
        "Bridget: Good. Anyway, Dante and I were gonna stop by in a little while, if that's okay?",

        "Christian: You know, I'm pretty good with a razor. Hey, if you're looking for a stylist --",
        "Felicia: You have so many talents, doctor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bailiff: Please rise, the honorable Judge Morrissey presiding.",
        "Judge Morrissey: Please be seated, everyone. Thank you. Though I have agreed to hold this hearing in my chambers, this remains a court of law and everybody is under obligation to speak the truth at all times. Ms. Gilmore, what are the charges against the defendant?",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Your honor, the defendant, Jaqueline Marone, has been charged with three felony counts. Count one, defrauding the federal government of over $3 million in tax revenues. Count two, failing to report more than $4 million in earned income. Count three, conspiring to launder over $14 million of united states currency.",
        "Jackie: None of this is true!",
        "Brooke: This can't be.",
        "Nick: I think your boy's been looking in the wrong garbage cans.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Your honor, all evidence was collected from ms. Marone's personal computer, obtained from her office through a legal warrant.",
        "Brooke: There's nothing legal about what you're doing.",
        "Eric: Judge Morrissey, there has to be some kind of an explanation.",
        "Massimo: Let's try to remain calm. Your honor, may I? Because Jacqueline Marone is the mother of my son, I would like to post bail. And I am certain I have sufficient funds to cover any amount.",
        "Nick: Maybe I was wrong.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Your honor, because the prosecution considers Ms. Marone a flight risk, we respectfully request that bail be denied.",
        "Nick: Flight risk?",
        "Ms. Gilmore: I'm sorry.",
        "Nick: What the hell is this? This is insane! [Talking over each other] Flight risk? Define that, would you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: Are you sure you've done this before?",
        "Christian: No.",
        "Felicia: Go ahead.",
        "Christian: You look beautiful. Hey, I'm not one for empty compliments. You look beautiful.",
        "Felicia: You've got one hell of a bedside manner.",
        "Christian: I'm glad you think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: A flight risk? Come on, my mother's never even had so much as a speeding ticket.",
        "Peter: Your honor, Ms. Marone has no prior convictions, no prior arrests.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Ms. Marone travels the world on business, there's no telling how many millions in stolen funds she's managed to stash away.",
        "Jackie: Millions?",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Ms. Marone's stolen assets would help her evade prosecution for years, maybe forever.",
        "Eric: Jackie Marone is a respected businesswoman with an international reputation. She does not deserve to be dragged in here and vilified.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Do you not make frequent trips to Buenos Aires?",
        "Jackie: Well, yes, I mean -- I have several boutiques there.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Which just happens to be across the river for Uruguay.",
        "Jackie: No.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: A country with which the United States has no extradition treaty.",
        "Nick: Oh, come on! This is insane. What are we talking about here?",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "[Gavel smacks]",
        "Judge Morrissey: Silence!",
        "Massimo: Your honor, I was married to this woman. I don't think anyone knows her any better than I do. Set your bail as high as you wish and I'll be responsible for it. I will not sit back and watch my son's mother spend another night in jail.",
        "Massimo: Your honor, if you would allow me to speak on behalf of my ex-wife.",
        "Judge Morrissey: You are considered to be under oath.",
        "Massimo: The notion that this woman has committed tax fraud, laundered money for drug cartels, is preposterous. What would she gain? Money? Prestige? She already has that. I made sure that she had a generous divorce settlement, which included the Jackie M. Boutique empire. This woman has been falsely accused. She should be allowed to post bail immediately.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Your honor, I'd like to question Mr. Marone on a few relevant points.",
        "Judge Morrissey: Proceed.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Mr. Marone, your divorce from Ms. Marone was amicable?",
        "Massimo: I have sufficient assets. I would never deprive my son's mother to have a lifestyle anything less than comfortable.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: You gave her complete ownership of Jackie M. As part of your divorce settlement?",
        "Massimo: No, I gave it to her before the divorce and allowed her to keep it.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Are you still a part of its financial structure?",
        "Massimo: Not since she has taken over the company.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Then you have no idea how the company's finances are handled?",
        "Massimo: I know that my ex-wife is not a thief.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: You gave Ms. Marone complete ownership of Jackie M., Is that because she was a loyal wife? No? What was the reason for your divorce?",
        "Massimo: Your honor, I don't see that this is relevant to the case.",
        "Judge Morrissey: You were given the opportunity to speak on your ex-wife's behalf, and now you must answer the prosecutor's question.",
        "Massimo: I divorced Jacqueline because -- [Massimo sighs] She was having a relationship with another man.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: An affair?",
        "Massimo: Yes.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: With Deacon Sharpe, someone she employed at her boutiques?",
        "Massimo: That's correct.",
        "Jackie: How did they know about Deacon?",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Were you aware that Mr. Sharpe had a criminal past?",
        "Massimo: Not initially, but I had some private investigators confirm it. Deacon Sharpe's crimes are a matter of public record.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: So, your wife was having an affair with a criminal?",
        "Jackie: No, it wasn't like that!",
        "Judge Morrissey: So, lets get this straight -- your ex-wife was having a relationship behind your back with a criminal?",
        "Massimo: Your honor, it -- it was not behind my back. It was in front of me.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: In front of you? You condoned the relationship?",
        "Massimo: For god's sake, no. I was incapacitated at the time. I was in a wheelchair -- on a ventilator.",
        "Ms. Gilmore: So, at a time when you were most vulnerable, the woman you loved was in the arms of another man, a man with a criminal past. The woman who promised to love and honor you.",
        "Massimo: Yes. Your honor, I -- I prefer not to answer any more of these questions. It was one of the most difficult times of my life. I -- I have nothing more to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christian: I know you better than you realize. Your mother gave me a dvd of your greatest hits. It gave me extra incentive. I needed to find out more about this woman who was so full of life.",
        "Felicia: So now I have another reason to have to thank my mother. [Knocking at door] Come in.",
        "Christian: Come in.",
        "Felicia: Hey.",
        "Bridget: Hi.",
        "Felicia: You're the first to see it. What do you think?",
        "Bridget: Oh my goodness, you look amazing.",
        "Dante: Prettiest bald woman I ever seen.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Felicia: You Italians -- Dominick just went down for his morning nap.",
        "Bridget: Right back on schedule, I'm pretty impressed.",
        "Felicia: Yeah, I was afraid he'd stop listening to his mother by now.",
        "Bridget: I just think that means we need to arrange for a few more sleepovers, soon.",
        "Felicia: Sleepover? Dominick's living here now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I suggest you turn this around.",
        "Peter: Is what your father said accurate?",
        "Ms. Gilmore: Your honor, Jacqueline Marone gave this man a promise, to be his wife, to love and honor him. But at a time when he was most vulnerable, she cheated on him with a man who had a criminal past. Now she's giving us a promise that she'll remain in the country until her trial. She can't be trusted. I ask that bail be denied and that Jacqueline Marone be held in federal custody until the completion of her trial.",
        "Judge Morrissey: All right, I'm ready to make my judgment.",
        "Jackie: Please -- please, your honor, I won't go anywhere. I promise you. You can't put me behind bars, I'm begging you."
