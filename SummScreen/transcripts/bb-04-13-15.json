        "Rick holds the bottle and asks Maya why is she taking estrogen. She frowns while he continues that he thought that was just for older women who had female problems. She takes the bottle from him and says it is sort of complicated. She stammers and finally says it helps regulate her. He understands and she says she appreciates him. Nicole loves her pictures, but Carter says she needs a little more practice. She brags that luckily she has a big sister that can help her. He snarls that she is depending too much on Maya's help. Nicole feels Maya owes her for all those times she said she would return to her and then didn't. Carter tells Nicole that he and Maya were engaged and she never told him about her transgendering. He doubts she will tell Rick either. Nicole says that is an interesting story and she can't believe Maya did that. She can tell Carter really cared for her and he says yes he thought he was the one but it wasn't meant to be. He is not pining after Maya although he is hurt and angry why Maya did not tell him. He is sort of proud that she went after what she wanted and he does not want her to get hurt. Liam tells Ivy that she is the Forrester and not Quinn so she needs to rise above that and he will always be there for her. Wyatt overhears this. He goes on in and asks Liam what he is doing here. Liam says just to check up on Ivy and she denies that she is threatened by working with Quinn. Quinn comes in and hopes Liam is going to do a piece of her coming back to FC. She says she has changed and is not the same woman she used to be. She doesn't even recognize that woman any more. Wyatt says if Ivy can forget the past and they work together this will improve everyone. Liam is skeptical. Quinn says not only Rick forgave her but so did Wyatt so she is hoping Ivy can too. Liam says he can not speak for Ivy but Quinn is asking a lot of her. She reels people in and continues to do the same. She has nothing else in her. Carter says this is a lot to process. Carter says Maya did not have to tell Rick the truth on their first date but look how far Maya let it go and to himself even when they were engaged.",
        "Rick says he couldn't help but jump to the worst case scenario. Maya apologizes and says she should have told him right away. He is so sweet. She is happy to be questioned by her big strong CEO, and assures him that nothing is wrong. He still feels like there is. She says she does not want to push but she would like to know where they stand or where they are going. She is not asking for a proposal but she would like to know what Rick sees in their future. Quinn tells Liam that she wishes he would believe her so she will just have to prove it by her actions. Wyatt tells them that his mother has messed up a lot of things, even for him, and he is being cautiously optimistic. Liam says he may have to forgive her because he is her son but that doesn't include him automatically. Wyatt says Ivy and Quinn must work together but she can not do that if Liam is always in Ivy's ear. They have to move on. Carter tells Nicole that proposal or not Maya has to tell Rick. Rick says he is only taking this moment to moment and enjoying it. Maya says so is she but if they are to move forward there are things to talk about. Rick retorts that maybe it is because she is a woman and he has been hurt before and going thru a divorce right now. She says she knows but there are things that she needs to share with him if they are going to last. He says that is fine but he wonders if there is something she is keeping from him."

        "Rick: This is yours, right? Well, it has to be. \"Maya Avant.\" Uh... \"conjugated estrogen.\" What does that even mean? Why are you taking estrogen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Wow. I never realized.",
        "Carter: What?",
        "Nicole: How much fun it'd be. Modeling.",
        "Carter: Um...give it time.",
        "Nicole: What do you mean?",
        "Carter: Nothing. It's just, uh -- it, uh, takes practice. It was only your first time, so...",
        "Nicole: Well, luckily, I have a sister willing to help me learn the trade.",
        "Carter: You feel like Maya owes you, don't you?",
        "Nicole: Do you know how many times I would go to sleep at night waiting for Maya to come and rescue me? I mean, she took off for Los Angeles, never looked back. But me? I was the one who was left at home with the bitter and embarrassed parents who sure as hell weren't gonna make the same mistakes they thought they made with Maya, with me. And I knew I had a sister out there, someone I could connect with, someone who knew more than anybody else what it was like to grow up in the house that we did. But she didn't come. So, yeah. Maya owes me. All that I ever wanted from a sister, that relationship I used to dream about -- it can finally happen. We're finally getting the chance.",
        "Carter: As long as you keep her secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Are you sure?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yes. Yes, I'm sure. Of course, I'm sure. It's beautiful.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Okay. If you say so.",
        "Liam: Oh, if I say so. Are you kidding me right now? Y-you're the jewelry designer. You're looking right at it. It -- it's -- it's good. You know it's good.",
        "Ivy: It's just, I can't stop thinking, what would Quinn do?",
        "Liam: Oh, God. Don't do that. Anything but that.",
        "Ivy: I know. I know. You're right. I-I have to stop thinking like that. Otherwise, I'm never gonna win this competition!",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] And, also, it's not a competition.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Apart from the fact that it kind of is.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Okay. You can't let Rick's decision to rehire Quinn get the best of you. Yes [Smooches] It's cruel. It's unfair, especially given your history together. But you are the Forrester, not her. So rise above, believe in your work -- because you know it's good -- and if you ever need some inspiration or encouragement or just a gentle reminder that you kick ass, I'll be here.",
        "Ivy: Ugh!",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat]",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, Liam. Uh, what, uh, brings you by?",
        "Liam: Oh, you know, just checking up on the world's most beautiful jewelry designer, making sure she's not slacking.",
        "Ivy: Oh, please.",
        "[All chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: Ivy is anything but a slacker.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, especially now. I can't afford to be.",
        "Wyatt: You're not threatened by my mom being back, are you? You don't have to be. There's enough room here for both of you.",
        "Liam: Okay, see, that right there -- uh, no offense to you, but that's another reason why we need to get rid of Rick. I mean, rehiring your mom -- that's just a bad idea.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, I disagree. I don't --",
        "Liam: It is. It --",
        "Quinn: Hey! Liam! What a nice surprise! Are you here to see me?",
        "Liam: No. No, I'm not.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Oh, I thought Eye on Fashion was gonna do a piece about my return. [Chuckles] What a shame. Well, listen, if you change your mind, I'm always available for a quote.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I don't want to tell Maya's secret.",
        "Carter: But you would.",
        "Nicole: Things were tense at first. I think she freaked out a bit, and I didn't like the way she was treating me.",
        "Carter: So, you, what -- you threaten the sister you're wanting to connect with? How does that make sense?",
        "Nicole: Okay, maybe we were both freaking out. It's an unusual situation. We're finding our way to being sisters.",
        "Carter: So don't ruin it. [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: What, Carter? If they're engaged, she'll have to tell him.",
        "Carter: You know about me and Maya, right?",
        "Nicole: You...dated?",
        "Carter: We were engaged, Nicole. And she didn't say one word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I didn't realize that you were taking medication. Estrogen. I thought that was for older women with bone issues or menopause or something like that.",
        "Maya: It can be. It can be.",
        "Rick: Then why are you taking it?",
        "Maya: It's complicated.",
        "Rick: Maya, is something going on? Is it serious? Are you sick? Maya, please tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Interesting story. I can't believe Maya led you on like that.",
        "Carter: I don't think it was malicious. She wanted to move on from Rick. I was there -- likable guy, attractive enough...",
        "Nicole: \"Enough\"? Give me a break. You mean to tell me you don't feel every woman stare at you when you walk in the room? [Scoffs] Man, Maya must have been seriously hung up on Rick to not fully enjoy a rebound with you.",
        "Carter: That's what I'm saying!",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Carter: No. Can't help who you love. As much as Maya wanted it to be me... it wasn't.",
        "Nicole: You really cared for her.",
        "Carter: Thought she was the one. House in the suburbs, white picket fence, till death do us part -- all that. It wasn't meant to be. It's a good thing, too.",
        "Nicole: You mean because of the...",
        "Carter: No. I'm not gonna lie, okay? I have issues, huge issues. I hate that I was in the dark, but...I wasn't pining after Maya. She was showing me sides of herself I hadn't seen before, and they weren't likable, so... I forgave her for how she treated me, okay? And now I'm starting to understand why she didn't pursue Rick. To be honest, a small part of me -- a very small part of me -- is kind of proud that she had the guts to go after what she wanted, no matter what obstacles she was facing. I don't want her to get hurt.",
        "Nicole: You think that'll happen? You think that if Rick finds out... he'll leave her, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Please. Tell me what's wrong.",
        "Maya: Nothing.",
        "Rick: But you have this prescription. I don't understand.",
        "Maya: Yeah, b-but not because there's a problem. It's fine. Trust me. I do need estrogen. It helps make me... it helps regulate me.",
        "Rick: Oh.",
        "[Both chuckle nervously]",
        "Rick: Uh, yeah. You know, I-I think I'm gonna mind my own business now. I'm sorry. I was -- I was just worried.",
        "Maya: I know. I know, and I-I appreciate it. I appreciate you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You know what? Fine. I will take a quote, actually. Uh, how surprised were you when Rick decided to hire you back? Because for those of us in the same community, we were actually quite shocked.",
        "Wyatt: Liam, come on.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, it's okay. He's earned the right to belittle me if that's what he needs to make himself feel better. Um, uh, the answer to your question is yes. I was shocked, too. But, you know, I mean, it kind of makes sense that a successful design house doesn't put all their eggs in one jewelry basket. Here -- here's the thing, though, right? I mean [Sighs] I've done some things. I-I've made mistakes. I'm the first one to own up to them. But I've changed. I'm not the same woman that I used to be. Going after you the way I did, and -- and carelessly knocking Ivy off of that bridge, I-it's the actions of a woman I don't even recognize anymore.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, guys, look. I got to admit, she really is trying to put the past behind her. Now, if you could do that, and Ivy, too, it would make this transition go a whole lot smoother.",
        "Ivy: You know I'm more than ready to welcome a better working environment. But this is awkward.",
        "Quinn: Oh, honey, I'm not gonna shove you off of anything again, I promise.",
        "Liam: Oh, that's nice. That's real nice. This new-and-improved you -- it's good, in theory. How long is it gonna last, Quinn?",
        "Quinn: Forever!",
        "Liam: Uh-huh. This -- so this is Deacon?",
        "Quinn: Deacon has had a tremendous effect on me. Look, Wyatt has been with me through all my ups and downs. He's seen me at my worst, and he knows me better than anyone. He wouldn't be standing in this office today if he didn't think that I deserved a second chance. I didn't just get a second chance from -- from Rick. This job? Wyatt's given me one. Won't you consider giving me one, too?",
        "Ivy: We're working together. I don't want there to be tension.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. So, will you please give me a second chance?",
        "Liam: You are asking a lot. You know that. I mean, I can't speak for Ivy, but as far as I'm concerned, you have used up all your chances. I've already given you second, third, fourth, fifth. I'm done. Now, do I hope that this is true? Yes, I do, for Wyatt's sake, for Ivy, especially, because she's the one in the unfortunate position of having to work with you every day. But I think that you're just good at pretending, 'cause that's what you do, right? You reel people in so that they trust you again. But when it comes to real change, you don't have it in you, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: I don't know how Rick will handle it, but I wouldn't be surprised if he breaks up with her.",
        "Nicole: Would you?",
        "Carter: I don't know. Maybe. [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: I mean, Rick will be shocked, but it doesn't have to change things.",
        "Carter: Okay, from the male perspective, it's a lot to process.",
        "Nicole: Well, what is she supposed to do? On the first date, \"Oh, by the way...\" I mean [Sighs] Okay, maybe if... you know, she hadn't gotten surgeries done, then, obviously, there's something that needs to be talked about. But she already had all that taken care of when she met Rick.",
        "Carter: Okay, maybe not the first date, but think about how far she allowed that relationship to go, how far she went with me. Now, Rick doesn't like being lied to. He has a history of lashing out, and that's what concerns me. I don't think he's been told one as big as this.",
        "Nicole: But to Maya... it's not a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I-I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. Did it feel like I was snooping?",
        "Maya: No, no, no, it didn't. You were concerned. It's sweet. I-I just -- I didn't know how to answer. You know, how much does a man really want to know about all that?",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] It's true. I-I should've known that nothing was wrong. But I couldn't help but jump to the worst possible scenario. I'm finally with the woman I want to share my life with, and...you're taking medication. I don't know. All these scary thoughts just popped into my mind.",
        "Maya: Oh, I'm so sorry, Rick. That's terrible. I-I should've explained right away. It's just...you know, these pills are part of my daily routine, and I don't even think twice about them.",
        "Rick: And here I am, grilling you, and you -- you're flustered. And I -- no, I'm the one who should feel terrible.",
        "Maya: Hey. You can grill me whenever you want...day or night.",
        "Rick: Yeah? You like that?",
        "Maya: Being interrogated by my man? When I look into those big, sexy eyes... I just melt. I am helpless when my strong CEO gives me the third degree.",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Rick: Good. I'm glad it's back.",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Rick: Your smile.",
        "Maya: Oh. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: It helps get me through the day.",
        "Maya: Oh, sure.",
        "Rick: It does. You do. [Sighs] Maybe that's why I overreacted when I saw the pills. I just -- I thought that there was something wrong.",
        "Maya: Nothing's wrong. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: Then what is it?",
        "Maya: You... you talk about finding the woman you want to be with... and worrying about losing me. Rick, where do you see this going?",
        "Rick: What do you mean?",
        "Maya: I don't want to push o-or make any assumptions. [Voice breaking] But I would like to know where we stand, because there's a lot that we need to -- I'm not asking for a proposal or anything like that. I just -- I need to know what you see when you think about our future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I'm not surprised you feel that way. But I, uh... I really do wish you would believe me.",
        "Liam: Even if I did believe you mean it, will you mean it tomorrow? Ah, that's the trouble.",
        "Quinn: Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to prove it to you with my actions. But, hey, I mean, at least you two crazy kids are still together, so I did one good thing right for you.",
        "Liam: I'm sorry. Are you taking credit for Ivy and me?",
        "Quinn: Well, yeah. In a strange way, I'm responsible.",
        "Liam: Don't -- don't do that.",
        "Wyatt: Come on, Liam.",
        "Liam: What do you --",
        "Wyatt: Can't you see how hard she's trying?",
        "Liam: What do you want me to do, Wyatt? You want me to forgive her? I'm sorry. I can't do that. Frankly, I don't know how you can.",
        "Wyatt: I can forgive her because she's my mother. I've lost a lot of faith in her. She's really messed up a lot of things for me -- for all of us. You have. But she's really trying to make amends. She's in this new relationship now, one I'm not particularly fond of. But it has had a positive effect on her. I'm trying to be cautiously optimistic.",
        "Liam: [Sighing] Okay. Fine. You can forgive her. Maybe you even have to forgive her, because you're her son.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: But Ivy and I get to keep our distance.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, this isn't about forgiveness. This is about being adults. We all want the best for Forrester, right? So if Mom and Ivy have to work together, they have to be able to communicate. They have to be able to bounce ideas off each other. How are they supposed to do that if you're constantly in her ear with all the ways that she's wronged you? We know. We all know. We all lived it. But now we have to do what's right. We have to move on. We have to move past all this -- everyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Maybe Maya's waiting to see if she has to tell him.",
        "Carter: She needs to tell him.",
        "Nicole: Not if Rick isn't serious about a future with her. Maybe that's why she's waiting for the proposal.",
        "Carter: Proposal or not, this has to be weighing on her, right? I mean, wouldn't it be easier if she just told the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: The future? Honestly, I-I'm just trying to take it moment to moment, enjoy everything that's happening with us.",
        "Maya: I know. I appreciate that. I was feeling that way, too.",
        "Rick: \"Was\"?",
        "Maya: I have everything I need right now. You. But if we're going to move forward, there are some things that we need to talk about.",
        "Rick: Maya, I think I understand what's going on.",
        "Maya: No, probably not.",
        "Rick: You're a woman.",
        "Maya: Yes.",
        "Rick: And you don't think about things the way that, necessarily, men do. And, you know, maybe it's because I'm going through a divorce right now. Maybe it's because I've failed miserably at all my marriages. Or maybe it's because I'm just a guy. But I'm not worried about where we're gonna end up... because I know I love you, and I know that I want to be with you.",
        "Maya: And I don't want to put any pressure on you. I know the stress that you're under, but there are just -- there are things that we need to talk about and that I want to share with you. And that can't happen... until I know this is gonna last.",
        "Rick: What do you mean? Is there any reason you think that we're not going to last?",
        "Maya: No.",
        "Rick: Well, then, okay. Then, we're good. I mean, then, you can share whatever you need to share.",
        "Maya: [Voice breaking] I want to trust that, and I want to be in the moment like you say, but...",
        "Rick: What is it? Maya, is there something that you're keeping from me?"
