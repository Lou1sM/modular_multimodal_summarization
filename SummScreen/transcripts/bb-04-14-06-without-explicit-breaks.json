        "Jackie: Your honor -- ",
        "Judge Morrissey: Let me just finish. ",
        "Jackie: Don't I even have the right to speak? ",
        "Judge Morrissey: This isn't a trial, Ms. Marone. We are here to set bail. ",
        "Jackie: All right, but I just -- ",
        "Judge Morrissey: I won't caution you again. These are extremely serious \r\ncharges. Ms. Gilmore makes a compelling argument as to why I should consider you \r\na flight risk, deny bail. But I also appreciate that you have had no prior \r\narrests of any kind. So this is not any easy ruling to make. ",
        "Nick: Oh, for god's sake, get on with it, will you? Can I take my mother home \r\nor not? ",
        "**************************************************",
        "Felicia: I'm so sorry, Bridget. I didn't mean for it to come out like that.\r\n",
        "Bridget: No, no, Felicia, stop. It's -- no. You're Dino's mother. Of course \r\nyou want to be with him. Of course you do. ",
        "Felicia: You're Dominick's mother, too. He belongs to both of us. ",
        "Dante: He's a lucky boy. ",
        "Bridget: No, I think I was the lucky one. ",
        "Felicia: Bridget, he still needs you. I still need you. I am not out of the \r\nwoods yet. There is no guarantee the cancer won't come back. ",
        "Christian: Your recovery is nothing short of miraculous. ",
        "Felicia: But I am not fully recovered. I had my body pumped full of poison -- \r\nradiated. ",
        "Christian: You're cancer-free. ",
        "Felicia: I've had bone marrow extracted from my hip, reinfused. A liver \r\ntransplant -- ",
        "Christian: Which your body is accepting beautifully. ",
        "Felicia: I don't know if I have days, weeks or months, okay? But I know how I \r\nfeel when I look at my son -- when I hold him -- smell him. ",
        "Bridget: You just love him so much you're -- you think you're going to burst.\r\n",
        "Felicia: Bridget, I promise you will be in his life -- ",
        "Bridget: No, Felicia, it's okay. No more promises. I think I should go. Will \r\nyou take me home? ",
        "Felicia: Will you fellas give us a minute alone? ",
        "Bridget: Felicia, don't, it's fine. ",
        "Felicia: No, it's not. You're not going anywhere, Bridget. Not until we \r\nfigure this out. ",
        "******************************************************",
        "Nick: Your honor, I apologize. It's my mother -- it's a frustrating \r\nsituation. ",
        "Judge Morrissey: Just hold your tongue, Mr. Marone, or I will have you \r\nremoved. Now, I have weighed everything that I've heard here today -- the \r\ngovernment's case against Ms. Marone, the existence of evidence obtained from \r\nher personal computer and the surprisingly impassioned defense of his ex-wife by \r\nMs. Marone's former husband. ",
        "Massimo: Well, whatever our differences, she is and will always be my son's \r\nmother. ",
        "Judge Morrissey: And I appreciate that, Mr. Marone. ",
        "Massimo: The business with the affairs -- ",
        "Peter: Your honor -- ",
        "Massimo: I'm sure if she had it to do again she would make a different \r\nchoice. ",
        "Peter: You were about to make a ruling, your honor. ",
        "Judge Morrissey: Your apparent willingness to forgive is commendable, Mr. \r\nMarone. But marital infidelity is not the issue here. What is at issue is \r\nwhether Ms. Marone poses a flight risk. I think ms. Gilmore's point is well \r\ntaken. Ms. Marone's personal assets are considerable and she travels all over \r\nthe world. ",
        "Peter: She's an international businesswoman. ",
        "Judge Morrissey: Bail is denied. Ms. Marone shall remain in federal custody \r\nuntil her case comes to trial. ",
        "Jackie: What? I have to go back to jail? ",
        "Eric: Stay strong, Jackie. Stay strong. ",
        "Jackie: No, this can't be happening. ",
        "Brooke: Don't worry, Jackie, we'll do everything we can. ",
        "Nick: Where the hell do you think you're going? You heard me. ",
        "Judge Morrissey: One more word, and I will hold you in contempt. ",
        "Peter: Don't! Nick, you can't help your mother if you're in jail, too. ",
        "Jackie: Nicky! Nicky, don't let them take me. ",
        "Nick: Mother, I love you. I'll get you out of here, I promise. ",
        "Jackie: Don't let them take me, Nicky. ",
        "Nick: I will get you out here, I promise. ",
        "Jackie: Please, don't let me -- don't let me -- ",
        "Massimo: I'm sorry. ",
        "Jackie: You! You did this to punish me. ",
        "Nick: Mom! ",
        "Jackie: You did this! You did it! ",
        "Nick: I will get you out, I swear! And after I do that, I will find out who \r\nput her here. ",
        "Brooke: Is the judge's decision final? ",
        "Nick: Yeah. He's made his decision. She's locked up until the trial. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god, Nick. ",
        "Nick: None of this makes any sense. ",
        "Brooke: You saw your mother. I mean, she obviously believes that Massimo's \r\nresponsible. And when they brought up the divorce, he couldn't have made her \r\nlook worse. ",
        "Nick: Could my old man really do this? ",
        "Brooke: I know you don't want to believe that. ",
        "Nick: What matters now is getting her out of her. I'm going to go by her \r\noffice. I'm going to check her files and look for anything that can help her \r\nout. I'll drop you off at home on the way. ",
        "Brooke: No, you go ahead. I have some business to take care of. ",
        "Nick: Thanks for being here. ",
        "Brooke: Yeah. She's been there to support us. Now I want to support her. She \r\nshouldn't have to pay for this. ",
        "****************************************************",
        "Christian: I was afraid of this. Bridget getting attached to Felicia's baby. \r\nI noticed how close they were at your barbeque the other day. ",
        "Dante: She's more than attached -- Dino's her son. Felicia had papers drawn \r\nup. ",
        "Christian: She thought she was dying, Dante. Surely you don't expect -- ",
        "Dante: Felicia to hold up her end of the bargain? Yes, I do. ",
        "Christian: Dominick is Felicia's biological child. ",
        "Dante: Mine, too. Which means I have a hell of a lot more to say about this \r\nthan you do. ",
        "*****************************************************",
        "Felicia: I think I know what you must be feeling, Bridget. And what you must \r\nhave felt last night when you left Dominick here with me, and I should've been \r\nmore sensitive. ",
        "Bridget: No. Like I said, Felicia -- ",
        "Felicia: I'm his bio-mom, I know that. But it isn't that simple, is it? ",
        "Bridget: I have nothing to complain about. ",
        "Felicia: Are you kidding me? I'm supposed to be dead. ",
        "Bridget: Felicia, please don't. Don't say that. ",
        "Felicia: I begged you to be my child's mother. And even though you had \r\nmisgivings about that, you came through for me. ",
        "Bridget: I fell in love with him. ",
        "Felicia: I know you did. ",
        "Bridget: When Nicole died, I just didn't think I would ever feel anything \r\nclose to that again. Then I had my own special little miracle. ",
        "Felicia: Dominick. ",
        "Bridget: I rock him to sleep at night and watch his little eyes grow heavy. \r\nHis body goes limp in my arms, and I realize that he -- he needs me and I'm his \r\nmother. I start to feel alive again. ",
        "Felicia: Do you think he knows how powerful he is? ",
        "Bridget: Oh, honey. You didn't die because you couldn't leave him. If that's \r\nnot the power of love, then I don't know what is. ",
        "Felicia: Bridget, you gave me something I will never forget. It's something I \r\ncan never repay you for. Peace of mind. When life was draining out of me, of \r\ncourse I didn't want to leave my son. But I knew I could because he would be \r\nloved by you. ",
        "Bridget: How can any sacrifice I ever make compare to that? ",
        "Felicia: Bridget, I didn't have a choice. I had to give up my baby. But you \r\ndon't have to. ",
        "Bridget: If Dino is here with you, then I don't have a baby. ",
        "Felicia: Yes, Bridget, you do. For reasons you and I may never understand, I \r\ndidn't die. I'm alive. And I want to spend every possible minute of whatever \r\ntime I have left with my son. ",
        "Bridget: Then -- then where does that leave me? ",
        "Felicia: Right here by my side, where I need you. Where we both need you. For \r\nwhatever time there is left. ",
        "Bridget: So Dino has two mommies. ",
        "Felicia: I think it can work. I know it can. ",
        "Bridget: I love you so much. And I love your son so much. ",
        "Felicia: Our son, Bridget. ",
        "Bridget: Oh, Felicia, I don't know that I can do what you're asking. ",
        "Felicia: Of course you can. You know you can. You're the selfless, giving \r\none. I'm the selfish bitch. ",
        "Bridget: I don't know if my heart can take it. ",
        "Felicia: Take what? Say it, Bridget. ",
        "Bridget: You know, what if -- what if you keep getting -- hopefully, you keep \r\ngetting stronger. But what if you realize you don't need me anymore? ",
        "Felicia: I will always, always need you. But there is one thing that I know \r\nfor sure -- and that's that I want Dominick, A.K.A. Dino, to know you and to \r\nlove you as much -- more than I do. So, what do you say? Are we in this \r\ntogether? ",
        "********************************************************",
        "Christian: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to overstep. ",
        "Dante: Bridget lost a baby. ",
        "Christian: I'm aware of that. ",
        "Dante: She thought Dino was going to be hers. ",
        "Christian: I can imagine what she's feeling right now. ",
        "Dante: Can you? ",
        "Christian: Look, it seems we've gotten off on the wrong foot here. ",
        "Dante: Whatever happens between me, Bridget and Felicia -- it's our business.\r\n",
        "Christian: Felicia is my patient. ",
        "Dante: Is that all? ",
        "Christian: I care about her. ",
        "Dante: Stay out of it. I will decide, with Dino's mother, what's best for my \r\nson. ",
        "*****************************************************************",
        "Massimo: Brooke, I was expecting you. ",
        "Brooke: Why's that? ",
        "Massimo: Dominick told you how I feel about your relationship. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, it's nothing you haven't said to my face. ",
        "Massimo: We do understand each other. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, yes, we do. I've had years of experience. The Stephanie Forrester \r\nschool of parental manipulation. ",
        "Massimo: Ah, Stephanie loves fiercely, as do I. ",
        "Brooke: Well, now that would just be an excuse to cover up what you're really \r\ndoing -- controlling people's lives. ",
        "Massimo: You are a very beautiful woman, Brooke. And I can understand why my \r\nson's so infatuated. ",
        "Brooke: But you're going to decide which son will have me. ",
        "Massimo: You have a child with Ridge. ",
        "Brooke: I have a future with Nick. ",
        "Massimo: No, you don't. ",
        "Brooke: Because you won't allow it? My god, what kind of world do you live \r\nin? ",
        "Massimo: I should think you would know that by now. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, yes. Because of what you did to Jackie in that farce of a \r\nhearing. You were really supposed to be there to support her, instead you made \r\nher look like an oversexed tramp. ",
        "Massimo: Well, a woman who can't control herself sexually -- ",
        "Brooke: Should what? Should be stoned in the village square? ",
        "Massimo: She's not on trial for adultery. ",
        "Brooke: Because you've already convicted her. ",
        "Massimo: Are you accusing me of something? ",
        "Brooke: You set Jackie up to punish her -- and me -- for loving the wrong \r\nson. ",
        "***********************************************************************",
        "Bridget: I was never very good at sharing, Felicia. ",
        "Felicia: You shared your father your whole life, and you never, ever once \r\nmade me feel like a half-anything. ",
        "Bridget: Well, I mean, it's you. I'd love you even if you weren't my sister.\r\n",
        "Felicia: So, you're into bald chicks? ",
        "Bridget: I just really like your style. ",
        "Felicia: Triumph in the face of adversity. ",
        "Bridget: What doesn't kill us -- ",
        "Felicia: Only makes us stronger. It's all right. ",
        "Bridget: Honey, I would be so proud to share that child with you. ",
        "Felicia: I love you. And I don't want anything to ever come between us, okay?\r\n",
        "Bridget: I love you, too. ",
        "Christian: I'm sorry to interrupt. ",
        "Felicia: Oh, it's okay. We're just doing each other's hair. ",
        "Christian: The lab called with the test results. ",
        "Felicia: Okay. Let's have it. ",
        "Christian: Your white blood cell count is almost normal. You're doing as well \r\nas you could possibly hope for. ",
        "Bridget: Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Your body is healing itself. You're beating \r\nthis! ",
        "Christian: Now, we still have to monitor your enzymes -- ",
        "Felicia: Yeah, but I'm coming back, baby. ",
        "Bridget: That's wonderful! You're coming back. ",
        "[Dominick fusses] ",
        "Bridget: You go. ",
        "Felicia: No, you go. ",
        "Dante: Don't worry, papa's coming. ",
        "***************************************************************",
        "Brooke: If you think you can use this situation with Jackie to force Nick to \r\ngive me up -- ",
        "Massimo: Brooke, you belong with Ridge. He is the man that you have returned \r\nto time and time again, and this time is no exception. You know that. ",
        "Brooke: I am in love with Nick. ",
        "Massimo: You'll destroy him. ",
        "Brooke: You put his mother in jail. ",
        "Massimo: I'm warning you -- ",
        "Brooke: No, I'm warning you. If I'm right about this, Massimo, and Nick finds \r\nout and he gets proof that you framed his mother -- this dynasty that you think \r\nyou're building is going to crumble before your very eyes. Because Nick is \r\nnever, ever going to forgive you. ",
        "**************************************************",
