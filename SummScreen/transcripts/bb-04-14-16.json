        "Bill and Katie have lunch at an outdoor restaurant. She assures him again that she has not been drinking and she is enjoying herself now without it. He says he will not pass any judgment so she can tell him if she has any urges to drink. Thomas asks Pam if she has seen his dad. She says yes, he managed to tear himself away and is having lunch with Caroline. Dr. Wolin happens to be eating there too and he walks over and introduces himself to Caroline and says he was Ridge's urologist. He congratulates her on her new baby. Ridge walks up and says something came up and he must go. Mistakes can be fixed. While Caroline goes ahead to the car, Ridge tells the doctor that he does not want him near his wife again. The doctor remarks if that child is really his then he has nothing to hide. Bill tells Katie that they need to do this more often. He reminds her again how much she and his family means to him. She says nothing more is going to interfere with his happiness. Ridge catches up with the doctor. The doctor says Ridge did not impregnate his wife. He knows it and Ridge knows it. Ridge says he is throwing round accusations and he does not want him to mess with him. Do they understand each other? Katie overhears as the doctor says it is not accusations; everyone knows it is the truth. Brooke tells Thomas that all is well with her and Katie; in fact she is going there now to see her. Back at the office Caroline asks Ridge is he wants her to massage his shoulders; he seems awfully tense. She wonders if it had something to do with that doctor. He says it is nothing for her to worry about. She does not believe it. He tells her that he did not want her to worry so he did not tell her. He tells her the doctor knows that Douglas is not his son. Thomas walks in.",
        "Katie walks over to the doctor and introduces herself and wants to join him. She has a question. She laments that she could not help but notice he and Ridge were having an argument and wonders what it was about. If there is a problem perhaps she can help. She asks his association with Ridge. The doctor says he is his ex-urologist. He says secrets can be touchy. At Katie's Brooke goes inch by inch in the kitchen cabinets until she discovers some hidden liquor. Bill walks in and asks why Brooke is here. He starts to pour her a drink of sparkling water which Brooke directs him to the bottle she found but it does not contain water. He says it is flat and Brooke hands it to him to smell and it is vodka. Thomas asks his dad about a gown he is designing and then lets him back to what they were discussing. Katie thanks the doctor and says he has helped more than he could know. But she would still like to know why he keeps mentioning secrets. Finally the doctor says that Ridge is infertile. She says that is impossible as he just had a son. The doctor says then it is someone else's child. Ridge tells a worrying Caroline there is no proof that Douglas is not his child. Just some doctor who is trying to shake down the Forrester family. They are safe."

        "Bill: No, nothing yet. Adam and Eve.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. A married couple. I don't even want to think about that. I just can't believe the lengths that she would go to. I mean, kidnapping him, holding him captive. She needs to be put away for a long, long time. What?",
        "Bill: You're -- you're just sort of animated, Katie.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Okay. Is that not a good thing?",

        "Brooke: What?",
        "Thomas: Looks like I caught you daydreaming.",
        "Brooke: Oh, um... yeah, I was just thinking about things.",
        "Thomas: You seem upset.",
        "Brooke: Oh, no, no. Nothing, uh -- [Sighs] Nothing I'm comfortable talking about.",
        "Thomas: Fair enough. Uh, Pam, have you seen my dad?",

        "Dr. Wolin: Take a look at that. Your counts are in the normal range, but read the notes. You're azoospermic. It means the sperm you're producing aren't viable.",
        "Dr. Wolin: I know your secret. There's no way that baby's yours.",
        "[Present time]",
        "Dr. Wolin: I want to congratulate you on the new baby.",

        "Katie: If you don't think I'm fine with water, you're wrong. I am. I mean, it was pretty much my drink of choice before... everything.",
        "Bill: I just want you to know that you can express it to me if you're struggling, Katie. I'm concerned, and I'm not gonna pass any judgment.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I know. I know. You and Brooke are worried, but you don't have to be. I'm fine. I don't have any desire to drink. At all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Well, good for dad, you know? If Caroline had her way, I'm sure she'd never leave Douglas.",
        "Brooke: Can't really blame her.",

        "Thomas: Right?",

        "Pam: Bite your tongue, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Come on. I'll see you. It's amazing, though, right? How this little boy can come into our world and -- and change so many lives forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: What's going on?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Yeah, Ridge. Nobody likes secrets.",
        "Ridge: Rick made a mistake, so we got to get back to Forrester so I can fix it.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Baby, I'm so sorry.",
        "Ridge: It's okay. Do me a favor. Can you, uh, have the valet pull our car around?",
        "Caroline: Oh, yeah. Sure.",
        "Ridge: I'll be right there.",
        "Caroline: It was nice meeting you.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Oh, I assure you. The pleasure was all mine.",
        "Ridge: This never happens again. You stay away from my family. You stay away from my wife.",
        "Dr. Wolin: A little harmless interaction with her in public couldn't bother you. What could I possibly tell her, right? If Caroline's child is really yours, you have nothing to hide.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: We have to do this more often.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] You always say that.",
        "Bill: I know, and I always mean it. Then work gets in the way. I can do better.",
        "Katie: You don't have to do better. You're doing just fine. You know, it's always busy at Spencer. We can't spend every day lounging over lunch.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] You want to head back to the office with me and we'll pick your car up later?",
        "Katie: Um, yeah, actually, you know, I-I saw a-a dress in the window next door, so I thought I would try it on. But I'll catch up to you.",
        "Bill: All right. Come here. I want you to know how much you mean to me, our family. It's all I want in the world, Katie.",
        "Katie: Me, too.",

        "Dr. Wolin: Your wife, uh, she's lovely.",
        "Ridge: I don't need you to tell me that.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Younger women are exciting, but they lack a certain, um, stability. They're impulsive. Live in the moment, as they like to say. You did not impregnate your wife, Mr. Forrester. You know it, and I know it.",
        "Ridge: Are you okay? You seem a little buzzed. Do you think your partners would appreciate how you spend your lunch hours?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Unfortunately, I ran into a little trouble with my practice.",
        "Ridge: Ah. You don't want to mess with me.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Is that what you think I'm doing?",
        "Ridge: No, you're throwing around accusations, and it stops today.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Except they're not accusations. They're facts.",
        "Ridge: Hey. We're not discussing this. You bring it up again, you're gonna see a side of me you wish you never had. Do we understand each other?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Every once in awhile, I am reminded that I have a long ways to go on this whole sensitivity thing.",
        "Brooke: What do you mean?",
        "Thomas: Well, here I am, I'm going on and on about Douglas, and that's dad and Caroline's son. I didn't stop to consider how you might feel about that.",
        "Brooke: You mean like jealous?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Territorial, maybe. You and dad had so many years together.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, we did. And that was an incredible time in my life. I wouldn't trade it for anything. But I am delighted because your father is very, very happy, and that's all I've ever wanted for him.",
        "Thomas: So, if it's not that, then... look, I-I know you said you didn't want to talk about it, or even if you want to talk around it, whatever's weighing on you, I'm here, and I'm a really good listener.",
        "Brooke: Thanks. That's really sweet. Just -- it's just -- ugh, it's something with my sister, an issue. In fact, I need to go see her.",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Do you want me to rub your shoulders? 'Cause you seem kind of tense.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] What? Uh, no. I'm, uh, I'm good. I'm fine. Thank you.",
        "Caroline: You were awfully quiet in the car.",
        "Ridge: Just shifting into work mode. You know how I am.",
        "Caroline: I do know how you are. I'm very familiar with your work mode. Um, but this is not that. Seems like something else is going on, something to do with that doctor, so do you want to tell me what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Katie: Um, excuse me. I'm Katie Spencer.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Yes. Of course.",
        "Katie: Oh, you -- you don't have to get up. Actually, I was wondering if I could join you.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Please.",
        "Katie: I have a question.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Well, then I'm intrigued.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Um, Ridge Forrester is a dear friend of mine, and I noticed that the two of you were having a bit of an argument. What was it about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: There's nothing going on that you need to worry about.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, see, that's not the same as \"there's nothing going on.\" So, what is it? What's happening? Because I knew that that Rick excuse was completely bogus. Who is this doctor, and why does he have the ability to make you so upset?",
        "Ridge: Oh, boy. I didn't tell you 'cause I didn't want you to worry about it, you know, but... do you remember the last time we were at the restaurant?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. The doctor was there, and he kept staring at you.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, and -- and I knew I knew him from somewhere. I just -- I-I couldn't place him 'cause of the beard or something.",
        "Caroline: He said he was your urologist.",
        "Ridge: Uh-huh. And he knows that Douglas isn't my son.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Thomas: Oh. I don't even have to ask. I'm obviously interrupting something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Wolin: So, you and Ridge are close?",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah, you could say that. Um, I've known him for a very, very long time, and he's kind of like family, so you can understand that I would be concerned if he was upset. What was going on between the two of you?",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Chuckles] Are you always so, uh, uh, direct?",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Yes. I'm sure you think I'm being nosey, but the truth is, I protect the people that I care about, so if there's a problem, then maybe I can help. Is there a problem?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Uh, could be. I guess it depends on your perspective.",
        "Katie: How do you know Ridge?",
        "Dr. Wolin: I was his urologist.",
        "Katie: Oh. Past tense?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Well, you see, I've fallen on a bit of hard times. I'm not practicing anymore.",
        "Katie: Hmm. So, why would Ridge be so upset with his ex-urologist?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Men with secrets can be...touchy.",
        "Katie: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Brooke.",
        "Both: What are you doing here?",
        "Brooke: I, uh, thought you were at the office. [Exhales sharply]",
        "Bill: Well, I-I just had to come by and pick up some paperwork for a business meeting later.",
        "Brooke: I had to drop something off for Katie. If I knew you were gonna be here, I certainly wouldn't have come by, so...",
        "Bill: You don't -- you don't have to say that.",
        "Brooke: I just don't want there to be any misunderstandings.",
        "Bill: No misunderstanding. I actually just came from lunch with Katie.",
        "Brooke: Oh. How did she seem?",
        "Bill: Great. She hasn't been drinking at all.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles nervously] That's good to hear.",
        "Bill: Yeah. I'm gonna get something. You want anything? Uh, soda, sparkling water, some juice?",
        "Brooke: Uh, actually, I'll have some sparkling water. But I don't like the chilled one. I-I prefer room temperature. It's in the cabinet.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Brooke: No, I-I'd like the small bottle. Thank you.",
        "Bill: Small bottle it is. It's flat. Let me get you another one.",
        "Brooke: Bill.",
        "Bill: What? What are you doing? [Sniffs] It's vodka. You knew about this?",
        "Brooke: I just found it.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] Katie. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Is everything okay? It seems pretty intense.",
        "Ridge: Fine.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, sure.",
        "Thomas: Okay, well, I hope everything's okay with Douglas. I mean, I-I can come back later. That's fine.",
        "Ridge: What do you got?",
        "Thomas: I just have a question about something. I-I need your advice on this.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Thomas: Halter or one shoulder?",
        "Ridge: One shoulder.",
        "Thomas: Wow. Okay. You didn't even think about that.",
        "Ridge: Gut instinct. Sometimes that's all you need.",
        "Thomas: It's crazy, 'cause that was my gut instinct.",
        "Ridge: Was it?",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Great minds, huh?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Well, I'll, uh, I'll let you guys get back to whatever you're getting back to. [Clicks tongue]",
        "Ridge: All right, all good.",
        "Caroline: What are you talking about, all good? Your doctor knows the truth about Douglas!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Waiter: Anything else?",
        "Katie: Uh, no, that'll be fine for right now.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Meet with your approval?",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] More than you know. So, where were we? You were saying that Ridge has secrets?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Don't we all?",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Very true. What sort of secrets?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Forgive me for being so blunt, but, um...",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no, go ahead. We're all friends here.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Why would I confide in you?",
        "Katie: Well, like I said, maybe I can help.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Me or Ridge?",
        "Katie: Hmm, well, I guess I would have to know what the problem is. I mean, are the two mutually exclusive?",
        "Dr. Wolin: I don't know. Maybe not.",
        "Katie: Well, you didn't seem to be having much of an effect on him. Maybe a gentler touch is needed?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Hmm. Did you know that Ridge had a vasectomy?",
        "Katie: Uh, no.",
        "Dr. Wolin: In Paris. He came to me because he wanted it reversed so he could have a child with Caroline. But then I discovered he has a condition called azoospermia.",
        "Katie: What's that?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Well, simply put, it means he's, uh, infertile.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Well, that's not possible because Ridge and Caroline have a child. Are you telling me that...",
        "Dr. Wolin: Well, Ms. Spencer, you're a very smart woman. Connect the dots.",
        "Katie: Ridge is not Douglas' father? Someone else is?",
        "Dr. Wolin: It is medically impossible for Ridge Forrester to father a child.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: See? Come here. That's why I didn't tell you anything, 'cause I don't want you to worry. I don't want you to freak out.",
        "Caroline: How do I not freak out? There's some doctor out there that I didn't even know existed that now has the ammunition to blow our lives apart!",
        "Ridge: I'm not gonna let that happen.",
        "Caroline: What does he want?",
        "Ridge: I don't know what he wants. I'm not gonna play that game with him.",
        "Caroline: But w-w-w--",
        "Ridge: Caroline, stop. Everything is fine. You and Douglas, you're my world. I'm not gonna let anyone destroy that. He doesn't have any proof. He's just another guy who thinks he can shake down a wealthy family. That's all.",
        "Caroline: Are you sure that you have this under control? Because after everything that we have gone through just to keep this secret...",
        "Ridge: Everything's fine. Our family's fine, and we're safe."
