        "All is abuzz backstage at the Spectra Fashion Show. Sally tells Shirley that in five minutes Coco will see the stolen designs. Shirley says yes but too late. CJ tells Sally that she sure got them in the door so he will give her that. She says they are going to make his mother proud. He hopes so as they are out of options so good luck. Bill gloats to Wyatt that in the past the Spectra's did not have him to bring them down. Today will be different. He's got zoning permits and everything he needs to get the wrecking crew going by the end of the day. Bill says the Spectra's are just a ragtag bunch of dreamers who have sunk their last dime into this doomed project. Thomas tells RJ that he hopes it goes well over at Spectra today as Sally has worked hard. Sally gives the troops a rally pep talk. Then she welcomes the audience and announces to them to set their eyes on the new Spectra fashions. RJ convinces Thomas that he should be there at Spectra for this showing. Thomas eagerly agrees; Sally is just stressed out and did not want him to see her like this.",
        "Coco likes all the gowns and has not suspected anything yet, but she does tell Darlita that they look like something Eric or Thomas would design. Shirley tells Sally that they may pull this off yet. Bill calls Jarrett and wants to know if Sally is tanking yet. Jarrett says quite the contrary; the gowns are spectacular. CJ tells Jarrett that this is nothing like he expected it to be. Looks like he will have to tell his boss the wrecking will have to wait for another day. Jarrett makes a note to himself. He says they are equally as good as FC. In fact they reek of Forrester Creations. Shirley clasps her hands and tells Saul they have knocked it out of the park and all the way to the bank. Finally it dawns on Coco that these gowns are too similar. She does not know how they did it but these designs are stolen. Shirley gets on the microphone and announces the genius behind all of this \u0096 Sally Spectra. To clapping fans, she goes out and takes a bow. Thomas is in the audience and winks at her. But then he too sees all of the gowns when the models come back on stage. The hurt is in Sally's eyes."

        "Shirley: Excuse me. Need you, Sally girl.",
        "Sally: It's our first fashion show, grams.",
        "Shirley: Fabulous, isn't it? But we're only halfway there. Let's get on it.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Shirley: Ladies! Remember, shoulders back on the runway. Oh, my God, Claire. Is that lipstick or a disease? Fix it! [Sighs]",
        "Sally: Why aren't these girls dressed, grams? We're on pretty soon.",
        "Shirley: Precautionary. Your sister.",
        "Sally: Coco is gonna see these designs on the runway in five minutes.",
        "Shirley: Yeah, but by that time, it'll be too late for her to squawk.",
        "Sally: Which she definitely will. She's going to know that these are stolen from Forrester.",
        "Shirley: Loose lips sink ships. These are your designs with a little help from your friends.",
        "Sally: [Sighs]",
        "R.J.: Wow. There's a lot going on there. Almost looks like something Sally would wear.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah. She inspired it.",
        "R.J.: Well, the show is probably starting soon. Wonder how it's going.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "C.J.: Well, you got them in the door. I'll give you that.",
        "Sally: And when they walk out, history will have been made.",
        "C.J.: Well, we'll see. But for your sake, I hope so, Sally.",
        "Sally: It's not just for my sake, C.J. We're gonna make your mother proud.",
        "C.J.: Sally, look, if this goes the other way, that's it. We sell. We're out of options. Good luck.",
        "Bill: I'm gonna rejuvenate the neighborhood, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: If Spectra's fashion show goes south.",
        "Bill: Oh, that's a done deal.",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. I've been reading about Spectra fashions lately. You know how many times they were counted out?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Plenty.",
        "Wyatt: And they always managed to come back.",
        "Bill: For two reasons.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Bill: The old Sally Spectra was running the operation.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Bill: And they didn't have me around to bring them down.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Got zoning, permits, everything lined up and ready to be signed off.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, it's good to be dollar bill.",
        "Bill: Friends in the right places.",
        "Wyatt: You don't even own the building yet, dad.",
        "Bill: Just make sure the wrecking crew is ready to go.",
        "Wyatt: Are you sure you want to do this, though? It's gonna cost us a ton to cancel.",
        "Bill: We will own that building by the end of the day. And by the end of the day tomorrow, it will be rubble.",
        "Shirley: Ladies, get ready! It's your five-minute call!",
        "Coco: Hi.",
        "Shirley: Come on, come on! Hustle! Find your dress! Let's go!",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "R.J.: Are you sure it's really over?",
        "Thomas: Yes. That's what Sally wants. You, on the other hand, you're still in the game.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Killing it. Even as we speak, apparently.",
        "R.J.: Oh, well, check for yourself.",
        "Thomas: What's this? \"I feel like I'm at prom, but where's my date? Wish you were here.\" Oh, that's sweet.",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: I hope it goes well over there. I know Sally worked hard on that collection.",
        "Shirley: Okay, everyone! Gather around! Our head designer has a few words. [Sighs]",
        "Sally: We are going to rock it today. This day is going to be blazed into fashion history. You all are a part of it. So go out there and give it all you got! We are Spectra! Let me hear you say it!",
        "[All chanting \"We are Spectra!\"]",
        "[Cheers and applause]",

        "Shirley: [Squeals] Here we go. All or nothing, girl.",
        "Darlita: I wonder how they're gonna react.",
        "Sally: I wonder how coco will react when she figures out what we've done.",

        "Wyatt: All right. They're all set. The crew will start demo'ing the building tomorrow. I just hope you know what you're doing. I know. You always do.",
        "Bill: First rule of business, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Know your competition. So what do we know about Spectra? They're a ragtag bunch of dreamers who spent their last dime on a fashion show that is doomed to fail.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, if you have anything to say about it.",
        "Bill: Just so happens I do. Along with Jarrett's review.",
        "Wyatt: Other press is gonna be there, too, you know.",
        "Bill: It doesn't matter. Jarrett's review is the only one that counts.",
        "Wyatt: That's harsh, dad, even for your standards.",
        "Bill: Not really. Spectra's broke. And maybe Sally has, you know, some modicum of talent. But she and that bunch of misfits, they can't compete with the likes of Forrester creations.",
        "Thomas: You know what the worst part is? She ended it right before her big fashion show. I wanted to be there to support her.",
        "R.J.: Dude, so be there.",
        "Thomas: What? You want me to just sneak in a side door?",
        "R.J.: Walk in the front. You are Thomas Forrester. They would be privileged to have you.",
        "Thomas: Coco didn't even want you there.",
        "R.J.: Okay, that's different, all right? She works here, and, you know, we're kind of...",
        "Thomas: Involved.",
        "R.J.: You should go, Thomas. She's presenting her own collection. She's gonna want you there, even if she said she doesn't.",
        "Sally: Come on, Becca. Let me see that smile. Yes.",
        "Saul: And when you make your turn at the end of the runway slowly, very slowly, or this whole back piece is gonna come down, okay?",
        "Shirley: Glue, hot gun, something quick! I need it right now! Hurry up! Quick! Come on, come on!",
        "Saul: I'm great!",

        "[Camera shutters clicking]",
        "Sally: Coco. She hasn't put it together yet.",
        "Shirley: We've got bigger fish to fry. I think they like us. Maybe. We've got to pull this off! I'm gonna look at more.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[Camera shutters clicking]",
        "C.J.: I got to say, it's looking more and more like my cousin came through, huh?",
        "Jarrett: All of these are from Sally?",
        "C.J.: Yeah, sure. Who else?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jarrett: Yes?",
        "Bill: She's bombing, right?",
        "Jarrett: Uh, actually, quite the contrary.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about?",
        "Jarrett: The designs are spectacular. Almost, I would say, too spectacular.",
        "Bill: What are you saying, Jarrett?",
        "Jarrett: I've got a hunch, boss. I'll -- I'll call you later.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Thomas: Sally wants nothing to do with me. She says we have no future and that she will only disappoint me.",
        "R.J.: And you believe her?",
        "Thomas: Hell no. Are you kidding? How could she disappoint me? I'm crazy about that girl, and she knows it.",
        "R.J.: She's overwhelmed. It's her first show.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, there's a lot at stake.",
        "R.J.: What else could it be?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, you're right. She is just stressing about the show. You're absolutely right. You know what? I'm gonna go check her out.",
        "R.J.: Cool. Oh, hey, Thomas, uh, tell coco I say hi.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, do you want me to kiss her for you, too?",
        "R.J.: [Mocking laugh]",
        "Thomas: [Mocking laugh]",
        "R.J.: No, it's not funny!",

        "Shirley: Let's go! Next group! Next group!",
        "Saul: Places, ladies!",
        "Shirley: Sally, I am feeling it!",
        "Sally: Something else, huh?",
        "Shirley: We are gonna be having a green-backed dollar winner here.",
        "Sally: We'll see, grams.",
        "Shirley: Sally, you are gonna be the talk of the industry tomorrow.",
        "Sally: I hope so. Yes. Yes. I hope so.",

        "Coco: This is incredible. Every dress.",
        "Darlita: Your sister is good.",
        "Coco: I-I didn't know she was this good. These are like Forrester quality. They remind me of something ridge or Eric or Thomas might design.",
        "[Camera shutters clicking]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Shirley: I can just hear the orders coming in.",
        "Sally: They do seem to like us.",
        "Shirley: Like us? Oh, honey. They love us.",

        "[Applause]",
        "Jarrett: Spectra's latest designs are good. Perhaps too good. So different from the designs I saw at the preview. Those were a product of raw talent, but these... such refinement, restraint. [Camera shutters clicking] In a class with Forrester creations. In fact, it reeks of Forrester creations.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Shirley: We did it! Knocked it out of the ballpark!",
        "Saul: Who would have thought?",
        "Sally: [Sighs]",
        "Shirley: You are a genius designer.",
        "Sally: This... this is unbelievable.",

        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Darlita: Time for some fresh air. Want to join me?",
        "Coco: Darlita, these are similar. They're too similar. They told me to be a plant, but I said no way. But -- but somehow... somehow these are stolen. They're stolen!",
        "Shirley: Wonderful, girls. Beautiful. Just beautiful. [Sighs]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Shirley: Ladies and gentlemen, the toast of the town, designer extraordinaire, the one, the only Sally Spectra.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Saul: Go on! Go up there and get some love! You deserve it.",
        "Shirley: This is your day, girl. Everything is coming true today. It's all yours.",
