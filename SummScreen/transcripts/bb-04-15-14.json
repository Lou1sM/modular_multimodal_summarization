        "Looking over his shoulder, Liam speeds off in the trailer with a confused Hope. Wyatt comes back out to find a missing trailer and sees it take off with Hope waving from the back window. He waves his arms and hollers for Liam to stop. Liam tells her on the cell that he just wants to talk to her. He says he knows this is a little extreme but if she had been pregnant with Wyatt's child that would have been the end of it for them. She tells him this is between her and Wyatt and has nothing to do with Liam. He says he doesn't agree. This was a huge wake-up call to him and he hopes to her too. Wyatt calls too to see if Hope is okay. She says yes; Liam just wanted to talk to her. She is unsure just where he is taking her. Wyatt wants to call the police but she convinces him not to. Wyatt says but he took his truck and kidnapped her. Hope says she can handle Liam. Wyatt says okay but he can't just stay here and do nothing. He has his cell so Hope can call him at any time and he will pick her up. Justin meets Bill for lunch. Bill says cut to the chase and just give him the latest quarterly numbers. Justin tells him no one is panicking yet but they are losing ground steadily. Bill rants there was mutiny but he needs to take back control of his ship. Karen won't return his calls but he will deal with her. And with Katie calling the shots, he can't see his son. He should have equal custody and Spencer company too. Katie is a little distracted these days but surely she did not think he would give up. So this will work in his favor when he is ready to pounce. Justin says no one wants him back more than he does, but taking over now will be dicey now that he is living with Brooke. And it will put her in the middle of him and her sister. Brooke walks into Eric's office and tells Katie that she wasted no time coming and laying the law down to Eric. Katie says that Eric is pushing Ridge at her and she is not going to stand by and watch it happen. Brooke maintains it was Eric's idea and she can not help it if he thinks she and Ridge are the future of FC. Katie says that Eric doesn't understand her relationship with Ridge otherwise he would not have made this proposal. But Ridge leaving her and taking the CEO position is not going to happen. Eric will see in time how happy they are and that Brooke is now back with Bill and in his bed. Brooks tells her that Eric has his agenda and she has hers. She is not going to stand around and watch her children be squeezed out of the company. Katie reminds her that Taylor tried that too and Brooke was all over her. Brooke recites that Taylor is a psychiatrist and Brooke is a chemist, the one who discovered Belief, the men's line, Brooke's Bedroom line .the fact that she is standing here defending herself is ridiculous. She doesn't even know who Katie is anymore. Katie smirks that she sure isn't that shy wallflower little sister anymore. She is sorry that is hard for Brooke to deal with. Brooke says she would like to think that Katie is sorry for other things but she sees now this is what she has always wanted to happen all her life. Katie knows Brooke still thinks this is some sort of payback. Brooke says it is more complicated than that even to the point of her and Karen manipulating Bill out of his company. Katie says Brooke has selective memory so don't forget those papers that Bill got her to sign. Brooke was so mad at Bill for lying to the both of them. How quickly she forgets. Brooke says she and Ridge are so hypocritical and holding Brooke to such high standards as if she is the only one who makes mistakes. Katie scoffs if that is what she is calling all her scandals and indiscretions .mistakes she should be forgiven for. Katie says and she always did until she found herself in another sordid entanglement and came after Katie and her marriage. Then she stopped defending Brooke and started defending herself. She always knew that Brooke's lifestyle would someday catch up with her. It finally has so enjoy Bill, enjoy Katie's husband because they both are two of a kind. He is not the man she married. She hasn't seen that man in a long long time but she is sure Brooke sees him differently. She and Ridge want something different, more drama free, simple. They want to raise their children and be there for each other as a couple. Perhaps someday Brooke will want that too and she hopes it won't be too late.",
        "Quinn is dismayed and shocked when she finds Wyatt distracted and he tells her that Liam took his truck along with Hope. He says he has no idea where they are going and it's driving him crazy. Quinn says this is bizarre even for Liam. Wyatt says he has just been waiting around for Wyatt to screw up. Quinn says but he hasn't. Hope is madly in love with him and she will realizes that when he rescues her from Liam. Wyatt tells her that Liam is not some psychopath that Hope needs to be rescued from. He just wants to talk about something. Quinn doesn't know why he had to make such a big production of it. Hope sees that Liam has taken her to his house. He says he took the back roads so Wyatt could not follow him. She reminds him that he couldn't as Liam took his truck. Liam says oh yeah, he did do that. He asks if she has had any contact with Wyatt. She says yes, and he is going out of his mind. Liam says he can understand how he feels. He is sorry it had to be this way but they need to go inside and figure something out. She calls Wyatt and tells him that she is at Liam's. He says he is on his way. She says no as Liam has locked the gates. Wyatt says it will take more than a locked gate to keep him out. Hope tells Wyatt that she doesn't like what Liam did but he's really upset. She thinks he really needs this time and so does she. She hopes Wyatt can understand and do this for her. He says it is taking everything in him to stay in control. Quinn tells him this is not good; Wyatt needs to go there. In a panic mode, Liam tells Hope that she was almost pregnant with Wyatt's child. He almost lost her. They almost lost each other. He hopes that scared her as much as it did him. She says of course it scared her. She can't be pregnant right now .especially the thought of losing him .the thought of closing that door, but she can't imagine losing Wyatt either. Liam says he knows how she feels but she could give it a try. Just look around at the memories. She can't love him the way she did Liam. They should be married right now and planning their future. But that's a future they can't have if she had his child. He pleads that he is her home. This is her home and she belongs with him, \"come home to me\". He kisses her."

        "Hope: Liam! Oh, my God, what are you doing?",
        "Liam: I just want to talk to you.",
        "Wyatt: What the...? Hope!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You didn't waste any time, did you? Laying down the law to Eric.",
        "Katie: He's pushing Ridge at you. I'm not just gonna stand by and let it happen.",
        "Brooke: It was a business decision, Katie. It doesn't affect you.",
        "Katie: Well, that's not true. Because what affects Ridge affects my relationship with him. I mean, I'm sure it's the same with you and Bill, right? Now that he's living with you.",
        "Brooke: Obviously it's something you're very happy about.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. I'm thrilled. I guess we're all just moving on.",
        "Brooke: And I guess your idea of \"moving on\" is telling Eric you don't want Ridge and me working together.",
        "Katie: Whose idea was that, anyway? Co-VPs?",
        "Brooke: I already told you. It was Eric's.",
        "Katie: Right. Just like it was his decision to offer Ridge the C.E.O. position if he dumped me and went back with you.",
        "Brooke: I can't help it if Eric sees Ridge and me as the future of Forrester Creations.",
        "Katie: You put him up to this.",
        "Brooke: No, I didn't. In fact, it didn't even cross my mind. That just shows you how insecure you are about what you supposedly have with Ridge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Listen, I know this seems a little extreme.",
        "Hope: I...",
        "Liam: I mean, if you were pregnant with his kid, that would have been it. That would have been the end of us.",
        "Hope: This is between Wyatt and me. It has nothing to do with you.",
        "Liam: I can't say I agree. This was a huge wake-up call for me, and I-I can only hope it was for you, too.",
        "Wyatt: Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! Liam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Flashback)",
        "Bill: So, this is how you get revenge? By ousting me from my own company? It's not like you to be vengeful and spiteful. But that's exactly what this is. You and Karen. You teamed up. You made an end run and stole my business. You did that, Katie. And I didn't even see it coming.",
        "Katie: I had a good teacher.",
        "(Present time)",
        "Bill: Don't even.",
        "Justin: There was a four-car pileup. Traffic was backed up for miles.",
        "Bill: How come I got here on time?",
        "Justin: Lay off, okay? This can keep you current on Spencer Publications.",
        "Bill: Thank you.",
        "Justin: Yes. You're definitely gonna thank me once you see what's in the folder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Listen, I know you're hoping to get a rise out of me.",
        "Brooke: No. Although I have every right to, after your little performance with Eric.",
        "Katie: Well, I think I have every right to express my opinion. This is a bad idea.",
        "Brooke: It's a bad idea for your relationship, you mean.",
        "Katie: Well, Eric just doesn't understand my relationship with Ridge. I mean, if he did, he wouldn't have made the C.E.O. position contingent on Ridge leaving me for you, because that's not gonna happen.",
        "Brooke: I'm not sure Eric is convinced that's true.",
        "Katie: Well, he will be. In time, when he sees how happy Ridge and I are together. And how happy you are with Bill. I mean, you have told him that Bill's sharing your bed again, right?",
        "Brooke: What do you think I do, Katie? Sit around all day and talk about my personal life? This is a place of business.",
        "Katie: Right. Business that you haven't been involved in for a very long time, and now, suddenly, here you are. It doesn't take a genius to figure out why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Where's he taking you?",
        "Hope: Uh, I don't know. He just said that he wants to talk to me.",
        "Wyatt: Is he taking you to the beach or the hills or where?",
        "Hope: I'm really not sure.",
        "Wyatt: You know what? I'm calling the police.",
        "Hope: Wait, Wyatt, Wyatt, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Wyatt: He took my truck, and he kidnapped you.",
        "Hope: I can handle Liam, all right? It's fine. And, like I said, he just wants to talk to me, but if you're gonna get the police involved, it...",
        "Wyatt: Look, I'm not just gonna stay here and do nothing! All right, look. Wherever he takes you, I'll have my cell. Just call me, and I'll be ready to come get you, okay?",
        "Hope: Okay. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: All right, cut to the chase. Spencer's latest quarterly earnings?",
        "Justin: Flat at best.",
        "Bill: At worst?",
        "Justin: Losing ground steadily. No one's panicking yet, but...",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, they will if something doesn't change pretty damn quick.",
        "Justin: Well, at the top, you mean.",
        "Bill: There was a mutiny. I need to take back control of my ship.",
        "Justin: Oh, look, Katie is not gonna let that happen. Karen, either.",
        "Bill: You just let me worry about Karen, all right?",
        "Justin: All right. Had any chance or time to spend with your son?",
        "Bill: Not with Katie calling the shots, no.",
        "Justin: But not for long.",
        "Bill: I am Will's father, and I should have equal custody of my son. And I will, along with control of Spencer again.",
        "Justin: How?",
        "Bill: Katie should have known better than to think I've given up. She's a little bit distracted these days. Which is going to work to my advantage when I'm ready to pounce.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: At first, it was Ridge that I didn't recognize anymore, and now it's becoming you.",
        "Katie: Why? Because I'm finally standing up for myself, for the life that I want?",
        "Brooke: No matter what you have to do to get it.",
        "Katie: You had to know that I was gonna call Eric out on his obvious plan to reunite you and Ridge.",
        "Brooke: Eric has his agenda. I have mine. I am going to stay here and protect my children from being squeezed out of Forrester Creations!",
        "Katie: You know, it's funny. Taylor did the exact same thing. She wanted to involve herself so she could protect her children, and you were all over her about that.",
        "Brooke: Taylor is a psychiatrist. I'm a chemist. I created the BeLieF formula, the men's line, Brooke's Bedroom line, which happened to be the most successful line at Forrester Creations! I mean, the fact that I have to stand here and defend myself in Eric's office is ridiculous! Who are you, Katie?!",
        "Katie: Well, I'm sure as Hell not your shy, wallflower little sister anymore, am I? I'm sorry if that's hard for you to deal with.",
        "Brooke: I would like think that you were sorry about other things. But I'm quickly beginning to realize that what's happening between us right now is something that you've wanted to happen all of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hey! Hey, there you are. I want to get your opinion on these before you and Hope hit the road. I'm thinking about using amethyst from our source in Brazil for the inset stones of this... this necklace. Honey? What's wrong?",
        "Wyatt: My plans with Hope -- Liam just stole my truck and kidnapped her.",
        "Quinn: What?!",
        "Wyatt: We were getting ready to go, and she was inside the trailer. I get a call, and while I was taking it, he sped off. And I don't know what the Hell is going on, if I'm gonna talk to her, when I'm gonna talk to her, and it's just driving me crazy right now.",
        "Quinn: Do you have any idea where they went?",
        "Wyatt: If I did, do you think I'd still be here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hi.",
        "Hope: You took me to your house.",
        "Liam: Yeah, where else? I, uh, I didn't want Wyatt to follow us, so I took the back way before getting on the PCH.",
        "Hope: [Scoffs] How was Wyatt going to follow us? You took his truck.",
        "Liam: I did. I did do that, didn't I? [Chuckles] Has he -- has he called you? Have you called him?",
        "Hope: He's going out of his mind, Liam.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, I know how he feels. That's why I brought you here. Listen, I'm really sorry I did it this way, but I think we need some time. You want to come inside? We have a lot to figure out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: No one wants you back more than I do, Bill, but going after Katie's top spot is gonna be dicey now that you're living with her sister.",
        "Bill: Brooke wants me back in control, and she knows how important it is to me.",
        "Justin: Okay, true. But to see you two go at it... do you really want to put Brooke in the middle in that way?",
        "Bill: If Katie doesn't step aside voluntarily, I don't see any way around it. Besides, their relationship is different now.",
        "Justin: Different. How? Does this have anything to do with Ridge Forrester?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You still think this is all about payback?",
        "Brooke: No, it's much more complicated.",
        "Katie: Because you're making it that way. Seriously, Brooke, is it so hard for you to believe that Ridge could be happy with me? I'm not the little girl I used to be. I'm a mother now. I'm a C.E.O. I have people who depend on me. I'm running a multi-national corporation.",
        "Brooke: Yes, with Karen. You two manipulated Bill out of his position at his company.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. Excuse me? Manipulated Bill?",
        "Brooke: Would you prefer \"stole the company\" instead?",
        "Katie: Wow. Wow. Talk about selective memory. It's amazing. So, let me guess -- you've conveniently forgotten about what Bill did several months later, getting me to sign those papers? You were so angry about that, how he lied to me, how he lied to you. You wanted nothing to do with him. Boy, how times change.",
        "Brooke: You and Ridge are so hypocritical. Holding me to high standards, as if I'm the only one who makes mistakes.",
        "Katie: That what we're calling it? All the scandals and indiscretions, those are just mistakes that you should be forgiven for?",
        "Brooke: We all need forgiveness, Katie.",
        "Katie: Yes. And when you found yourself in another sordid entanglement, I always stood by you. Always. Until you came after me and my marriage. And then I stopped defending you and I started defending myself. And I'm not gonna stop doing that. I always knew your lifestyle would catch up to you, and it finally has. So, enjoy Bill. Enjoy my husband. Because you both are two of a kind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Why you bringing up Forrester's name?",
        "Justin: Maybe because he seems totally at home in Katie's office these days. What's up with that?",
        "Bill: I don't know. I'm totally focused on getting my company back. Anything else is a distraction.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So that's how you see Bill and me. Two of a kind.",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Brooke: Yet you married him and you gave him a child.",
        "Katie: He's not the same man I married. I haven't seen that man in a long, long time. I'm sure you see him differently.",
        "Brooke: So, you think Bill is as superficial as you say I am.",
        "Katie: Like I said, you're a good match.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Yeah, I guess you and Ridge are, too.",
        "Katie: I think Ridge wants a life that has a little less drama in it.",
        "Brooke: And you're drama-free. I'm certainly not.",
        "Katie: I just think we want something simpler. Something easier. We want to raise our children and be there for each other as a couple. Maybe someday you'll want the same thing for yourself. I just hope it's not too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: The devil is wrong with Liam? This is bizarre, even for him.",
        "Wyatt: He's just been biding his time. He's been waiting for me to do something to screw up my relationship with Hope.",
        "Quinn: You haven't done anything to screw up your relationship with Hope. She is madly in love with you, and she's gonna realize that even more once you rescue her from Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on, Mom. I don't like the guy, but he's not some psychopath for Hope to be rescued from. He just wants to talk to her or whatever, I don't know.",
        "Quinn: Right, and he couldn't do that here? He had to make a big production about it?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. Are you okay?",
        "Hope: Uh, yeah. We're at Liam's.",
        "Wyatt: I'm on my way.",
        "Hope: Wait. Don't. Just...stay put.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] He locked the gate. There's no way that you could get in, anyway.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, it'll take a lot more than a locked gate to keep me out.",
        "Hope: Look, I-I don't like what Liam did, either, but he's really upset.",
        "Wyatt: All the more reason for me to be there.",
        "Hope: I think he really needs this time. And, honestly, I do, too. Can you understand that? Can you please just do this for me?",
        "Wyatt: I'm not gonna lie, Hope. It is taking everything in me not to just...",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Wyatt: She doesn't want me rushing out to Malibu until she has a chance to talk to Liam.",
        "Quinn: No! You need to go out there! This is not good!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You were almost pregnant with his kid, you know? I freaked out. Can you blame me? Here's the thing. I almost lost you today. We almost lost each other forever. I hope that scared you as much as it scared me.",
        "Hope: Of course, it scared me. I-I-I can't be pregnant right now. I can't. Especially when... the thought of losing you forever... the thought of closing that door was... but I can't imagine losing Wyatt, either.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I know how you feel. But could you try? Because one thing is true -- you don't love him the way that we loved each other. Look around you, you know? Look at this place. Look at the...the memories here.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: We should be married right now. We should be -- we should be planning a future. But that's a future that we can't have... if you had his child. I'm -- I'm your home, Hope. This is your home. And you belong with me. Come home to me."
