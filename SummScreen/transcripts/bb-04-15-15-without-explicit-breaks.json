    "Recap": [
        "With Wyatt listening behind a partially opened door, Maya tells Nicole they have a bigger stake in this than their agenda. If this secret gets out it could really hurt Rick and FC. Nicole agrees that she is not the one who would want to cause that. Bill tells Liam that he likes his little ball of hyper energy that Katie has become at the office. She teases him and says as much as she is flattered Liam is right. This is inappropriate conversation for the office. Bill says okay, what they need to do is get on with FC and focus on the takeover and all be on the same page. He can't believe that Rick rolled out the red carpet for loony Quinn. Liam says if it helps their cause then Quinn can do her worst. Quinn sits on a couch with Deacon and explains that she sent out e-vites to everyone they know. Maybe they will not come but some will as she has changed and some will take notice. She says she got him, he got her, no one else matters. Brooke comes in and says she did not realize they were here. Quinn says she is there for a meeting with Rick. She inquires if Brooke got her e-vite. Brooke says yes but do not expect her to attend, she does not support this marriage. And she would not expect Hope to either even if her daddy is Deacon. And she tells Deacon that he still has time to bail. Quinn reminds her that she is standing right there and that is so disrespectful and they do not need that kind of negativity. And if that is what she is bringing then she can just stay home or feel free to adjust her attitude and change her mind. Nicole tells Maya that she never wanted to blow her out of the water. She just wanted to be treated like family and now Maya has. They are really sisters and she has this fabulous house and a budding modeling career. There is no way she would want to jeopardize that. She will keep her transgender story a secret. Carter knocks but comes on in and agrees this could be a public relations firestorm. He just thinks Rick needs to know the truth. They look like deer in the headlights when Rick comes in and asks what is going on. The energy seems off in here. Maya quickly says that she and Carter just had another disagreement but all is fine. Pam comes in and reminds Rick that he has a meeting with that viper Quinn. Rick says that door swings both ways and anyone who wants to can just leave. Rick tells Nicole that he ought to cut Carter some slack. He came in here after losing the most incredible woman in the world and if it were him he doubt he would handle it as well. Quinn calls Carter into her office and while it catches him off guard and his first tendency is to say no, he agrees to marry her and Deacon. Nicole and Maya end up talking old movies and making popcorn and Rick takes credit for being right and getting the sisters together. Liam tells Bill that it gets more and more intolerable every day at FC and he wishes they could move now. Wyatt rushes in and says he may have something on Rick. He is not sure what it is as he had to leave but he did hear Maya and Nicole discussing some epic secret. They said it would send shockwaves throughout the company and Rick could be out as CEO. Liam tells Wyatt that if this secret is that explosive then they must have it. But Katie speaks up and says they need to slow down. Perhaps there is another way to get what they want out of Rick. Liam says no, he would just take it out on Ivy and Caroline. They have to surprise Rick and that means Wyatt the only one with the inside track. Bill tells Wyatt to use it. Wyatt bolts out and says he knows exactly where to start. Katie tells Bill that she is quiet because she is Rick's aunt and is conflicted. This will affect Brooke and she does not want to cause her more problems. And Katie thinks it ironic that Bill is going after someone for being a tyrant. Bill scoffs that he has been more than warm and fuzzy since he got his Katie back. She replies that yes he has been downright squishy.",
        "Back at FC, Wyatt catches up with Nicole and introduces himself. She says she is just starting out but her sister, Maya, is helping her. It blows her mind every time she thinks how far she has come and what she had to overcome. Wyatt says yeah, from ex-con to Queen of the manor, quite a climb. Some people may see her as manipulative and a gold-digger but he sees a woman who knew what she wanted and went after it and got it. Nicole agrees things were a little bumpy at first and they had some adjusting to do but all is fine now. Wyatt says he finds her very interesting and would like to know her better. Quinn tells Deacon that they have Carter now so maybe others will come around. She tries one more time even a glutton for punishment to convince Brooke to come to the wedding. When she goes to her meeting she tells Deacon to keep working on the guest list. Brooke tells Deacon that Quinn was right. They will always share time with each other for their daughter and because of AA when she was lost. Now he is the one who is lost. She will always be in his corner and she cares for him, but she is not going to accept this. She will not let him marry Quinn."

        "Maya: I'm serious, Nicole. This is bigger than us and any stake or agenda we may have. If this secret gets out, think of how it could affect Rick and Forrester Creations.",
        "Nicole: You think I want to be the one responsible for ruining Forrester or Rick losing his job?",
        "Maya: Then we're agreed. This stays between us. No one else can know.",
        "Katie: Well, you're a very good client. [Chuckles] Thank you. It's very nice to be back. Hey, that's my husband you're talking about.",
        "Bill: Puts us to shame, doesn't she?",
        "Liam: Yeah, it's actually kind of frightening.",
        "Katie: We'll talk soon. Bye.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Liam: [Snickers]",
        "Bill: Nothing! Just very taken by what A... hot, efficient, little ball of hyper energy you are.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Makes me feel a certain obligation to, I don't know, cool you down...",
        "Katie: [Giggles]",
        "Bill: ...Or slow you down.",
        "Liam: You know, maybe we could save the innuendo for private time.",
        "Bill: Do I get on you when you're panting all over Ivy like a little lapdog?",
        "Liam: Uh, no, but it's different. You're -- you're my dad.",
        "Bill: And this is my hot wife. So get over yourself, all right?",
        "Katie: As much as I'm flattered by all the attention, Liam is right. This is inappropriate conversation for the office.",
        "Liam: You preach it, Katie! You tell him!",
        "Katie: I might have to file a report with H.R.",
        "Bill: We'll get back to that. Right now, we have to talk about Forrester, make sure we're all on the same page going forward with the takeover.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, well, provided we have the means to do it, especially since Rick's award-winningly stupid decision to rehire Quinn.",
        "Bill: Crazy as a loon. Proven it time and time again. Yet little Ricky rolls out the red carpet.",
        "Katie: Well, that may be a decision he lives to regret.",
        "Liam: Listen. If it helps with our takeover, I say, Quinn, do your worst.",
        "Quinn: So, basically, what I did was I sent out e-vites to everyone we know or would want to know.",
        "Deacon: I thought we decided that we didn't care who does and doesn't show up -- that we're the party.",
        "Quinn: I know, I know. It's silly. We probably won't get any responses. But, you know, it's my first wedding.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, and hopefully your last.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Yes, that's true. And who knows? What if we got flooded with a bunch of RSVPs -- you know, all the hoity-toity people in this town wanting to give us a few hours of their measly day. I mean, I've changed, you know? Maybe some people will take notice.",
        "Deacon: You know, you put out such a brave front, I forget sometimes how hurt you are inside.",
        "Quinn: I've got you. You've got me. Nobody else matters.",
        "Deacon: Damn straight.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: I didn't realize you were here.",
        "Quinn: Uh, just waiting for my meeting with Rick.",
        "Deacon: So, you're back at it, huh?",
        "Brooke: Oh, lots to catch up on. [Sighs] Got your e-vite.",
        "Quinn: Are you coming to the wedding?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] You're kidding, right? Why would I attend a wedding I don't support?",
        "Quinn: Because maybe you... did some soul-searching. Or you might want a fresh start after our last interaction. Or maybe because you care so much about Deacon that you're willing to put your animosity towards me aside.",
        "Brooke: Sorry. I won't be coming. And you still have time to bail.",
        "Quinn: Really? Really, Brooke? Come on. That's so disrespectful. I'm standing right here. You know what? We don't want that kind of negativity. And if that's what you're bringing, you might as well stay home. I just thought that it was proper to have the mother of my groom's daughter at the wedding. But you know what? Feel free to adjust your attitude, and you can change your mind.",
        "Brooke: Don't count on it.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Hey. Maybe Rick will come, you know, out of professional courtesy.",
        "Nicole: I don't want to blow your secret out of the water, Maya. I never did.",
        "Maya: But you would have.",
        "Nicole: Luckily, we didn't have to put that to the test. All I ever wanted was for you to treat me like family, and you're doing that. I feel like we're really sisters now. And thanks to you, I have a ginormous roof over my head, a modeling career that's kicking off. There's no way I want to jeopardize that. So don't worry. I won't tell anyone that you're a transgender woman.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nicole: Him, on the other hand...",
        "Carter: What about me?",
        "Nicole: We were just discussing how important it is to keep Maya's secret.",
        "Maya: And not just for my sake. For Forrester Creations, too. You know the potential fallout better than anyone.",
        "Carter: Could be a public relations firestorm.",
        "Maya: Good. So you're on board? You won't say anything to anyone, least of all Rick?",
        "Carter: To me, it's Rick most of all. I have issues keeping this from him, Maya. The guy has a right to know.",
        "Maya: And I will tell him when it's time.",
        "Carter: See, I'm not comfortable with that.",
        "Maya: You don't have to be. It's my life, my story.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Rick: What's going on?",
        "Liam: Honestly, I-I don't care what brings Rick down, whether it's amassing enough stock for a takeover or plummeting revenues. I don't care. I want him gone. I-I mean, not only is rehiring Quinn, like, the dumbest corporate move ever, it's an insult to Ivy.",
        "Bill: All of a sudden, not only does she have to be subservient to Rick, she has to worry about Quinn sticking a knife in her back, literally.",
        "Liam: Yep. It's -- it just gets more and more intolerable over there every day. I wish we had a way to move now.",
        "Bill: Who shot you out of a cannon?",
        "Wyatt: I might have something on Rick.",
        "Liam: Hey, if you got something on Rick, we need to know what it is.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I'm not exactly sure what \"it\" is. I had to get out of there before I could hear everything. But Maya and her sister, Nicole, were definitely talking about some epic secret.",
        "Bill: About Forrester or Rick?",
        "Wyatt: They said that whatever it is could send shock waves throughout the entire company, and... Rick could be out as C.E.O.",
        "Rick: Energy feels off in here. Is everything okay?",
        "Maya: Yeah, we're fine. Fine. Right, Carter?",
        "Carter: Actually, Maya and I were having a disagreement. But, uh [Chuckles] What else is new, right?",
        "Pam: You've got that meeting with Quinn.",
        "Rick: Thanks, Pam.",
        "Pam: Mm-hmm. And she wants to see you, too, Carter.",
        "Carter: Me? Why?",
        "Pam: Didn't say, didn't ask. She's across the hall with Deacon.",
        "Carter: It'll be in a few. I got to make a call.",
        "Pam: [Chuckles] Quinn's not going anywhere... unfortunately. I still can't believe you let that viper back in the door.",
        "Rick: Well, it happens to be my door, Pam, and it swings both ways. So if anybody's unhappy around here...",
        "Pam: I get to have an opinion. You're gonna be sorry that you let her back in.",
        "Rick: [Sighs]",
        "Carter: We'll finish later?",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Rick: Are you sure everything's okay?",
        "Maya: Yeah. It gets awkward between us sometimes. We'll work it out.",
        "Nicole: It's so interesting around here. I mean, people who used to be couples coupled with other people -- well, in Carter's case, not, but... I mean, seeing each other every day, working together? I'd say awkward is inevitable.",
        "Rick: Well, when you put it that way, I really should be cutting Carter some slack. I mean, he came this close to marrying the most amazing, most beautiful woman in the world, and he lost out. He's actually handling it a lot better than I think I ever would.",
        "Maya: Well, if I have it my way, you'll never have to worry about that.",
        "Rick: I always give you your way. Always will.",
        "Maya: I hope so.",
        "Quinn: You know, I'm not giving up on hope. She could still surprise us. What? Deacon's her father!",
        "Brooke: Hope is not going to your wedding.",
        "Quinn: You don't know that for sure. It would be really nice to have both our kids at the wedding.",
        "Brooke: Tell you what. Why don't you hold off marrying Deacon until hope gets here?",
        "Quinn: Ha. Nice try.",
        "Deacon: Hey, who needs a bunch of people anyway, right? We just have to feed them.",
        "Quinn: I am sorry you are so blinded by your animosity towards me that you can't see that I've changed.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: You barged into my house uninvited, and you slapped me.",
        "Quinn: Because you deserved it. You were coming on to Deacon, disrespecting our engagement. And, by the way, you still are. But I haven't raised a hand to you, have I?",
        "Brooke: Your restraint is admirable.",
        "Quinn: Thank you for noticing. Oh, you know what? You hate me. I know, I know. You know what? Feel what you want to feel. I can't change it. But let me be clear about this. You can disapprove all you want, but you will not interfere with our wedding.",
        "Quinn: You don't know what it's like. You couldn't. You have had more men than you can keep track of. I have had two in my life, Brooke -- bill and Deacon. I have...I have waited for this for so long -- a man who supports me, who wants me, who loves me. We are going to get married. End of story.",
        "Carter: You wanted to see... me?",
        "Quinn: Hey, Carter! Did you get my e-vite?",
        "Carter: Actually, uh, yeah. Yeah, I did, and I was --",
        "Quinn: So, Deacon and I were hoping you would perform our ceremony.",
        "Deacon: It would really mean a lot to Quinn.",
        "Carter: Wow. I, uh -- I wasn't expecting that. Um, I'm not really --",
        "Quinn: Please?",
        "Carter: ...Prepared to...",
        "Quinn: Please say you'll do it.",
        "Deacon: You've done it before, though, right?",
        "Carter: Friends, mostly.",
        "Quinn: Uh, well, then, make an exception. Or, better yet, consider us as friends? I mean, it'll be a really small ceremony.",
        "Brooke: Teeny.",
        "Quinn: It's at Wyatt's house. Uh, we'll -- we'll pay for your gas or -- or your fee or we'll give you a big tip.",
        "Carter: It's not about the money.",
        "Deacon: Come on, Carter. Please say you'll do it.",
        "Quinn: Uh, it would -- wouldn't take up much of your time.",
        "Carter: Okay. Yeah, I'll marry you.",
        "Quinn: You'll do it! You'll do it! You'll do it! Oh!",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Thanks, Carter. Appreciate it.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] See? Things are coming together. We are getting married. Mm.",
        "[Maya and Nicole chuckle]",
        "Nicole: You like old movies?",
        "Maya: Especially the ones from the '40s.",
        "Nicole: And the screwball comedies.",
        "Maya: Oh, my gosh. The faster they talk, the better.",
        "Nicole: [Laughs] Well, maybe we should watch one together sometime.",
        "Maya: I would love that. And, you know, there are tons of DVDs at the house. I guess Stephanie was a fan, too.",
        "Nicole: Oh. Well, I'll make the popcorn.",
        "Maya: You're on.",
        "Rick: Now, that's what I've been wanting to hear -- you two connecting as sisters! Now, I have to give myself a little credit, which I will.",
        "Maya: [Laughs]",
        "Rick: I knew Nicole moving in with us would be a game-changer.",
        "Maya: Uh, you were definitely right about that.",
        "Liam: I mean, if this secret's as explosive as you're saying it is, and it's really what we need to get Rick out, uh, we got to have the information, bro.",
        "Katie: Okay, let's just take a tiny step back. Maybe there's another way to get what we want from Rick.",
        "Bill: What do you suggest, Katie -- reasoning with him?",
        "Wyatt: Right, because he's such a reasonable guy.",
        "Liam: Yeah, no, no. He would just take it out on Ivy and Caroline. We have to surprise him, which brings us to you. I mean, you're the only one with an inside track.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Use it.",
        "Wyatt: All right. And I know exactly where to start.",
        "Liam: Wait. Where you going? Where's he going? What -- hey, Wyatt!",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Bill: Been awfully quiet about the takeover, Katie.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Well, I guess I'm conflicted.",
        "Bill: Because Rick's your nephew.",
        "Katie: And because of Brooke. Whatever we do with Forrester is going to affect her, and I don't want it to cause problems.",
        "Bill: There's always going to be collateral damage.",
        "Katie: I do have to say that I think it is the height of irony that you're going after someone for being a tyrant.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Well, it's different, and you know it. Yes, I'm tough. But, uh, you know, I-I'm not the president of -- of a dress factory. I'm the C.E.O. Of a multinational corporation. I don't demand any more of my employees than I demand of myself. Now, having said that, you know, I think I've been, uh, much more warm and fuzzy since I've gotten my Katie back.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. You're downright squishy.",
        "Bill: Squishy?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: Okay, so, you choose what we're gonna watch first, and then I'll make sure I have it at home, okay?",
        "Nicole: Okay.",
        "Maya: All right. Bye!",
        "Nicole: Bye.",
        "Rick: You see? Nicole moving in with us was good for her. She's relaxed. She's confident. She's easier with you.",
        "Maya: She can be a challenge, but...I really like my sister. I see a lot of me there.",
        "Rick: For instance?",
        "Maya: The drive for a better life. To find the person she was meant to be and...be it.",
        "Rick: Hey, what's the matter? You seem sad all of a sudden.",
        "Maya: Do I? What do I have to be sad about? The best man I know is all mine.",
        "Wyatt: Nicole, right? Maya's sister.",
        "Nicole: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I'm -- I'm Wyatt. Um, nice to meet you.",
        "Nicole: Oh, you, too.",
        "Wyatt: What are you doing? You look like you're looking for someone.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] I am. I'm looking for Oliver. I want to take another look at the proofs from my photo session.",
        "Wyatt: I didn't know you were a model, too.",
        "Nicole: I'm just starting out. My sister's helping me.",
        "Wyatt: I know Maya does have a lot of influence around here these days.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] Yeah. Tell me about it. I mean, it blows my mind every time I think about how far she's made it and what she's overcome.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Ex-con to queen of the manor. That's quite the climb.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, Maya's, um... something special.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Nicole: Do you like her?",
        "Wyatt: Some people call her manipulative, a gold digger. I see a woman who knew what she wanted and went after it, and got it.",
        "Nicole: Mm.",
        "Wyatt: A lot of changes for you, too. You're living at the Forrester estate. Wow.",
        "Nicole: Yeah. It's crazy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. You and your sister getting along?",
        "Nicole: Now.",
        "Wyatt: Not before?",
        "Nicole: It was a little bumpy at first. Had to do a bit of negotiating.",
        "Wyatt: Value given for value received.",
        "Nicole: Something like that.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: You know, for some reason, I just... I find you very interesting. I want to get to know you better.",
        "Quinn: We have got Carter. Slowly but surely, people are coming around.",
        "Deacon: Babe, we got one guy who's performing a service.",
        "Quinn: Well, that's one more than we had half an hour ago. And that is called progress. [Clears throat]",
        "Deacon: Uh...",
        "Quinn: I know that I am probably a glutton for punishment, but I am going to give it one more try, be the bigger person. I know you don't like me. But you are the mother of Deacon's daughter, and that means something to him. You mean something to him. I know he loves me, and he's committed to me, but for our family's sake, would you please reconsider?",
        "[Tablet chimes] Oh, that's my meeting. Um, okay, you know what, Brooke? Come, don't come, I don't really care. Just can you at least be happy for us, for Deacon's sake? And you -- you keep working on the guest list.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",
        "Quinn: Mm. [Sighs] I know it's asking a lot.",
        "Brooke: I can't. [Sighs] I can't. She is right about one thing. We do share a daughter together, so we will always be connected through Hope. And now we're connected through A.A. Because when I needed help, you reached out to me, and you helped me when I was lost. And now you're lost.",
        "Deacon: No...",
        "Brooke: Yes, you are. You're lost if you insist on going through with this crazy wedding!",
        "Deacon: Brooke, it's as good as a done deal.",
        "Brooke: No, I won't accept that. I'll never accept that. [Both sigh] Look, I wasn't always in your corner, but I am now, full-force, because I care about you. And I want you to find somebody that's perfect for you, that understands you and appreciates your kindness and your goodness. And that isn't Quinn. So, no. No, I am not going to accept this. I am not going to let you marry Quinn."
