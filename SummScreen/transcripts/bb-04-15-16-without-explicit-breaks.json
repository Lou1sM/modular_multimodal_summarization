    "Recap": [
        "Ridge tells Caroline there is no proof for the doctor so she has nothing to worry about. Katie grins and repeats to the doctor that he just said Ridge cannot be the father of his son. She says maybe they used a sperm donor. And he seems to be getting a great deal of pleasure out of all of this, she wonders if he is planning on blackmailing Ridge. He better not try to cause trouble for Ridge and Caroline. He says he is not wrong. A sperm donor would have taken many more months than this. Caroline tells Ridge not to keep things from her as it only hurts worse in the long run. She even thinks they should perhaps think about telling Thomas as Douglas could need blood way down the line and the secret would come out then. Brooke laments to Bill that this is all her fault. It all started the day she could not keep her mouth shut and said she was in love with Bill. He says that is unfortunate but they never crossed that line. And while Brooke may want to take responsibility for Katie's problems she needs to let go of this as Katie's drinking was not her responsibility; it goes deeper than that. The doctor tells Katie that Ridge has a nasty little secret and he suggests she stay out of this. He also tells Katie she better treat him with respect. He is the one with the smoking gun and he is not going anywhere. And he is sure she would not like to see Ridge's reputation go down the drain over this. Katie fires back that he better be careful. Ridge reminds Caroline that telling Thomas is not an option. She thinks it is. They just need to sit him down and explain and she thinks he will understand. It doesn't have to be that complicated. He reminds her of a scandal that could tear the family apart. He just wants to protect his family. The doctor calls Ridge and says they did not finish their conversation Ridge says yes they did. The doctor insists that it would be in Ridge's best interest if he did not try to blow this off. He wants .demands that Ridge meet him at the park. Ridge tells Caroline that he will take care of this right now. Ridge shows up and there is the doctor. The doctor says now that he has been relieved of his practice he has nothing but time. He has time and no bank account. Ridge says ah, so this is for a shake-down. The doctor says he wants $100,000 or the rest of the world will know what he knows.",
        "Thomas asks Caroline if she knows where his father is. She is evasive but he senses something is wrong. Katie is not happy when she gets home and realizes both Bill and Brooke know of her still drinking. He says he is glad Brooke told him as Katie certainly was not going to. She said she did not want him disappointed in her. Katie barks at Brooke that she counted on her support and apparently that was not true. Bill said he has asked her over and over even as late as lunch today. She apologies but he says that is not good enough. She keeps lying to him and does not mean it when she says she has it under control. Katie looks at Brooke with contempt. Thomas tells Caroline that he noticed some tension between her and Ridge. He figures they need some alone time, a date night and he would love to take Douglas and let them have the night off. She says this is nothing he can help with. He tells her that she can tell him anything. Ridge calls the doctor an idiot and starts to walk away. The doctor follows and says he has 24 hours to come up with the cash or he is blowing the horn. Ridge is not out of sight when a big truck drives by, slams on the brakes and the doctor is laying on the ground."

        "Ridge: There's nothing to worry about. There isn't.",
        "Caroline: How can you say that?",
        "Ridge: 'Cause he doesn't have proof.",
        "Caroline: Well, that doesn't sound like it matters to him.",
        "Ridge: Matters to us. That's just assertion.",
        "Caroline: There are assertions that are true, Ridge. You are not the biological father of our child.",
        "Ridge: He doesn't know that.",
        "Caroline: Is that what it's come to? A man who knows our secret and we just have to tell him that he's wrong?",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Katie: So you're saying that Ridge is not Douglas' biological father?",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Chuckles] Virtually impossible.",
        "Katie: Because of this condition he has.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Azoospermia.",
        "Katie: Well, maybe he and Caroline used a sperm donor. I mean, there's more than one way to have a child.",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Chuckles] Uh, is that what he's claiming?",
        "Katie: No, but knowing Ridge, he probably wouldn't.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Well, maybe not to you, but to me, he would. And he hasn't. Look, he's defensive, he gets angry, he's even threatening. I'm the expert on this, all right? I know what I'm talking about.",
        "Katie: You seem to be taking pleasure in this. You're not planning on blackmailing him, are you?",
        "Bill: How long have you known?",
        "Brooke: It was recent. I walked in and I saw Katie holding a bottle of vodka.",
        "Bill: Here in the kitchen? How many times in the last week alone did she swear to me she wasn't drinking?",
        "Brooke: She swore me to secrecy.",
        "Bill: She couldn't keep it up much longer. I had my suspicions. I just chose not to believe them.",
        "Brooke: She should have told you. I didn't want to have to be the one. But she didn't, of course. All the signs were there -- secrecy, denial. You had to be told. I couldn't keep it from you much longer.",
        "Bill: I'm glad you said something. For Katie and for me.",
        "Brooke: I'm worried about her, Bill.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Look, I suggested the possibility of a sperm donor, but he -- he wanted his child to carry his genes. Ridge was, um, he was insistent, which is why he came to me in the first place.",
        "Katie: He could have changed his mind.",
        "Dr. Wolin: He could have, but he didn't. And he told me as much the last time I saw him here.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] I don't believe you.",
        "Dr. Wolin: You can believe what you like, all right? But look at the facts. Within a month, his wife was pregnant. Now, finding a donor, all the paperwork involved, and then the insemination process? Would have taken much, much longer.",
        "Katie: Ridge knows how to get things done, believe me.",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Chuckles] What? One trip to a, uh, nightclub and he finds some sperm donor?",
        "Katie: You don't seem to have very much respect for him.",
        "Dr. Wolin: About as much as he has for me, then.",
        "Katie: Well, why should he respect you? I mean, you barely know me and you're sharing all of his intimate medical secrets with me. You seem a little bitter. And I think you drink too much. And you better not think of causing trouble for Ridge and Caroline.",
        "Caroline: This doctor, he's threatening you, isn't he?",
        "Ridge: He can't touch us.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, but it's not the first time that he's confronted you, so why didn't you say something?",
        "Ridge: Because I didn't want this. I didn't want to worry you.",
        "Caroline: Don't do that. Don't keep things from me, Ridge, because you think that you're gonna upset me. I'm assuming that he wants money?",
        "Ridge: Hasn't gone that far.",
        "Caroline: Yet.",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Brooke: I did this to her.",
        "Bill: You did not.",
        "Brooke: Yes, I did. It's all my fault. Katie's problems began the minute she overheard me tell you how I felt.",
        "Bill: Brooke, playing the martyr role in this is of no use.",
        "Brooke: Bill, I have to take responsibility somehow. I have nightmares about that day, the fact that she overheard!",
        "Bill: You expressed what you needed to say.",
        "Brooke: I-I never should have said anything. I should have kept my mouth shut! She shouldn't have known how I felt!",
        "Bill: How we both felt, Brooke. I have responsibility in this, as well. Listen, it forced us to -- to refocus our priorities. Now, it's unfortunate that Katie heard what she heard, but we never crossed a line. And, you know, regardless, I think Katie's drinking problem goes deeper than that. I think she was falling into a depression before that day.",
        "Brooke: Again, all because of me.",
        "Bill: [Scoffs] I know you want to take responsibility for all of your sister's miseries, but Katie had depression issues for a long time.",
        "Brooke: Since will's birth.",
        "Bill: That was postpartum. I suspect if we look deeper, Katie should have been on medication years ago. Now, I have a wife and a child to protect. This has to stop. And you have to stop beating yourself up over this. It doesn't help. And it's not doing to solve your sister's drinking problem.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Well, it's nice to have a guardian angel, I guess.",
        "Katie: I care very deeply about Ridge.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Why?",
        "Katie: [Sighs] His wife is my husband's niece.",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Chuckles] You know, I suspect it goes much deeper than that.",
        "Katie: Yes, it does, doctor. Or should I call you \"mister\" now that you've been defrocked?",
        "Dr. Wolin: I strongly suggest you stay out of this.",
        "Katie: \"This\"? What's \"this\"?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Ridge has a nasty, little secret, and he thinks he can hide it from the world.",
        "Katie: So you are planning on blackmailing him.",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Chuckles] That is such an ugly word.",
        "Katie: No wonder they took away your medical license.",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Laughs] You know what? Too bad for Ridge they didn't do it sooner, right? Look, I know his condition beyond any doubt. And I'm probably the only one who does.",
        "Katie: You could go to prison for this.",
        "Dr. Wolin: I haven't done anything, Mrs. Spencer. But given your friend's reputation and his glorious status in the world, I doubt very seriously there will be any talk of prison.",
        "Katie: Don't count on me to agree with that sentiment.",
        "Dr. Wolin: So you'll watch, uh, your dear friend lose everything? His reputation, probably his wife, his family? I'm holding the smoking gun. You and he best treat me with respect. I'll be around, Mrs. Spencer. I'm not going away.",
        "Katie: These accusations are totally unfounded. I'd be careful if I were you.",
        "Caroline: What are we gonna do? What if he goes to the media with what he knows?",
        "Ridge: I'm not gonna let that happen.",
        "Caroline: Ridge, you don't know what he's gonna --",
        "Ridge: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't stress. I need my boy's mother to be calm and serene. I've got this covered. There's no problem. Okay? Okay. [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: You know, um... they're doing really amazing things with genetic mapping these days.",
        "Ridge: Genetic what?",
        "Caroline: Mapping. I read about it when I was pregnant.",
        "Ridge: Why are you bringing it up?",
        "Caroline: I think, you know, by the time that Douglas is a teenager, genetic testing is gonna be the norm and he'll be tested and typed and coded.",
        "Ridge: Why you bringing that up now?",
        "Caroline: Because I think that if we're really honest with ourselves, we can't keep the secret of his paternity for the rest of his life. I mean, what -- what if something happens? What if he needs something, like, from you, like blood or something? What -- what then?",
        "Ridge: We'll deal with that when and if it happens. We got to protect our son.",
        "Caroline: I know we do. But secrets don't protect anybody, do they?",
        "Ridge: What are you saying?",
        "Caroline: I think we should talk about maybe telling Thomas.",
        "Ridge: You want to tell Thomas?",
        "Caroline: I think we should at least talk about it.",
        "Ridge: We have talked about it. It's... it's not an option.",
        "Caroline: Maybe it should be.",
        "Ridge: You -- you know what the repercussions are gonna be, right?",
        "Caroline: What about the repercussions of not telling him? Maybe we're just fooling ourselves, thinking that we can keep this secret for forever.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: I think that we can sit down with Thomas and explain everything.",
        "Ridge: [Scoffs]",
        "Caroline: And tell him why it's happening and how, and -- and I think he would understand. And then we would just -- we would sign a couple of papers and that would be it, and Douglas would legally be ours.",
        "Ridge: It's gonna be a little more complicated than that.",
        "Caroline: It doesn't have to be.",
        "Ridge: If this secret gets out, it doesn't just get out for Thomas. It gets out for everybody. For the whole world -- my dad, Rick, everyone. Another scandal. And you -- you think Rick wouldn't use this information to try to tear our family apart? Let's not do this. I don't want to fight with you. I just want to protect my family. You understand that, right?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Sorry. Yes?",
        "Dr. Wolin: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: What do you want?",
        "Dr. Wolin: We didn't finish our conversation.",
        "Ridge: No, I was finished.",
        "Dr. Wolin: No, no, no. You were rude. I don't take to rudeness. Meet me at the park off Melrose by Forrester.",
        "Ridge: I'm at work. I'm busy.",
        "Dr. Wolin: I would not say no to me, Ridge. Be there. I'll be waiting.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: That was him.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. He wants to meet me.",
        "Caroline: Are you going?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. I'm gonna deal with this right now.",
        "Caroline: Be careful.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Oh! Good! You're here. We need to talk.",
        "Bill: Yes, we do.",
        "Katie: No. [Chuckles] You will not believe what happened to me at the restaurant after you left.",
        "Bill: We'll talk about that later, Katie.",
        "Katie: This is important. You're gonna want to hear it.",
        "Bill: I said later.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "[Footsteps approach]",
        "Katie: What are you doing here?",
        "Bill: We need to talk to you.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] \"We\"?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Katie: About what?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Thomas: Hey, is my dad around?",
        "Caroline: Uh, no. He had to go meet someone.",
        "Thomas: Do you know when he'll be back?",
        "Caroline: Nope. I'm not really sure.",
        "Thomas: You okay?",
        "[Children shouting]",
        "Ridge: I could have sworn you said you were gonna be waiting for me.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Patience, Ridge. Come on. Patience.",
        "Ridge: I'm a busy man, just like you, dr. Wolin.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Only I'm not. Now that I've been relieved of my practice, I've got nothing but time. Time and an empty bank account.",
        "Ridge: So this is a shakedown?",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Chuckles] Your secret is safe with --",
        "Ridge: There is no secret.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Please, Ridge, I think we're beyond that.",
        "Ridge: I told you. I talked to another doctor and he found a way to get me to --",
        "Dr. Wolin: And I told you it was impossible given your condition.",
        "Ridge: Well, then you're obviously wrong, but now you got some time on your hands. You can read some medical journals.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Stop it, Ridge. Stop, all right? You and I both know you are not the biological father of that child. That secret will go with me to my grave. If you meet me here tomorrow with $100,000 in umarked bills.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles] Wow.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Don't laugh.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Dr. Wolin: Put them in a paper bag. 100 grand, Ridge. Or the whole world will know what I know. This latest Forrester child really isn't yours at all.",
        "Katie: Bill, I can -- I can explain about that.",
        "Bill: I'm all ears, Katie.",
        "Katie: Not in front of her.",
        "Bill: We both have a stake in this.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Stake?",
        "Brooke: We want you to get better.",
        "Katie: You're the reason why I started drinking in the first place.",
        "Bill: Whether or not that's true is beside the point!",
        "Katie: I'm so glad I confided in you.",
        "Bill: I'm glad Brooke told me! You certainly weren't going to!",
        "Katie: Bill, I... I'm -- I'm gonna stop.",
        "Bill: When?",
        "Katie: Soon.",
        "Bill: Why didn't you tell me that?",
        "Katie: Because I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.",
        "Bill: It is far more disappointing to have my wife continuously lie to me!",
        "Katie: I-I know, and I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm getting it under control.",
        "Brooke: No, you're not.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I counted on your support, which clearly I don't have.",
        "Bill: This isn't about Brooke! This is about you! You and me! How many times have I asked you if you have been drinking?! How many times?! Just today at lunch, I asked you, and you deny it over and over again!",
        "Katie: I know. I know. And I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Bill: No, Katie! \"Sorry\" isn't good enough! I trusted you! I trusted you because I love you! And I love our family! And you are lying to me. You keep lying.",
        "Katie: [Sobs]",
        "Thomas: Is everything okay?",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: So, this is your usual happy state? Is something wrong with Douglas? Is... Caroline, is my brother okay?",
        "Caroline: Yes.",
        "Thomas: Okay, well, then it's something else. Look, I-I picked up on a vibe from you and dad earlier.",
        "Caroline: We're just dealing with something.",
        "Thomas: Is there anything I can help with? You know what it is? You guys need a day off. You need to have a date, some adult time, right? Uh, look, uh, why don't -- why don't I watch Douglas tonight? Seriously. Look, babies are great, but, uh, you know, you need some adult time to go hang out with dad. Douglas and I will chill. We're bros. We're awesome. We'll gossip a little bit. But no secrets.",
        "Caroline: Thomas, can we not talk about this right now?",
        "Thomas: Sure. How about that sun, huh? Thing's bright and yellow. It's like a giant light bulb in the sky. Love it.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be so snappy.",
        "Thomas: It's okay.",
        "Caroline: I'm just really stressed out right now, and it's nothing that you can help with. I'm just...",
        "Thomas: You sure about that, Caroline? Look, you can talk to me about anything you need to.",
        "Ridge: You're blackmailing me.",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Chuckles] No. I'm giving you an opportunity to make this awkward situation go away.",
        "Ridge: There's nothing awkward about it. The kid is me.",
        "Dr. Wolin: [Sighs] You continue to treat me like an idiot.",
        "Ridge: You are an idiot. I'm done here.",
        "Dr. Wolin: You will be done if you don't take this seriously. I'm sure you thought about the consequences of this becoming public. 24 hours. 100 grand. Right at this spot. That's the deal. Must be a shock, right? I mean, total control over everything, and then suddenly Poof! None at all. So how does it feel, huh, Mr. Big Shot? Having someone else pulling the strings now? If I were you, I'd get to that bank sooner than later. You come up with the cash, or I'm blowing the horn.",
