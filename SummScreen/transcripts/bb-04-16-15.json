    "Recap": [
        "Brooke tells Deacon that please reconsider, she will not let him marry Quinn. He understands her concern. But it would be nice to have hr blessing. She says that will never happen. He's in recovery and he should be focusing on that. Quinn asks Rick if he received her invitation she and Deacon are getting married tomorrow. Rick tries to be polite but makes excuses that he can't go. She thanks him for giving her a second chance at work. Bill tries to ally Katie's fears about being a better way to go about this other than using Wyatt. Bill says Nicole knows something and if that can help them take over Forrester then they need to find that out. They need to get little Ricky out of there. And Wyatt is their best shot and hopefully he is doing that right now. Wyatt tells Nicole that Rick and Maya seem pretty solid; what is her take on those two? Maya is successful and gorgeous but nobody's life is perfect .bet she has the window to the real Maya. He tells her that he can definitely relate as he did not know he had a brother until just a couple of years ago.",
        "Brooke asks Deacon if he wants Hope in his life and if so then how can he marry Quinn the one who took the one joy from her. Deacon said he told her and she did not read him the riot act. He thinks she will be okay with it. Brooke says Hope will never be okay with his and Deacon is only being self destructive. She begs him again not to marry Quinn. Quinn comes in and tells her enough is enough, stop badmouthing her right now. She rants at Brooke that no one is forcing her to come to this wedding but it is not her choice to try and stop it. Deacon tells them to stop bickering. Quinn says it is one thing for Brooke not to come to the wedding but another for Brooke to try and guilt trip Deacon into not marrying her. They will marry tomorrow and it will be better without Brooke there. Katie retorts to Bill that she is not sure she wants to know all the details. She worries how Brooke will feel when Katie says she knew in advance. She knows Rick has been a total jerk; Bill says more than that, total abusive. Nicole admits she likes Rick; he really talks to her. Wyatt says he never had that good a rapport with him. She says funny that she gets along better with Rick than Maya. Think Nicole gets wise and says she needs to go someplace but nice meeting Wyatt. She tells Maya that she just met Wyatt and he was very nice to her. Maya says he is a Spencer and comes from a very powerful family .used to be married to Hope but that didn't work out so that is why he is not that close to Rick. Rick explains to Maya that it is one thing to invite Quinn back into the company for her designs, but in no way is he going to be her friend or support her marriage so they will not go. Wyatt goes back to Bill and says he made headway with Nicole and even dropped the word secret to her to see how she would react. She suddenly found other things to do and left. She and Maya definitely share a secret and it is up to them to find it out what it is. Deacon tells Quinn that he was proud of her and finally maybe Brooke is getting it and she will leave them alone. Tomorrow Quinn is going to make him the luckiest man in the world. Brooke gets on the phone and tells someone that she needs them to help her stop Deacon from marrying Quinn tomorrow."

        "Brooke: You're not marrying Quinn. I won't let you do that to yourself.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, I --",
        "Brooke: Deacon, please. Listen to me. This is for the rest of your life. And you're not in the right frame of mind to be making that kind of commitment.",
        "Deacon: Wait, stop, stop. Look, I-I really appreciate your concern. And I get that you can't stand my fianc\u00e9e, but, Brooke --",
        "Brooke: No, that's it, okay? That is it. You are not marrying Quinn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I'm not worried. I'll find a way to make it happen. I always do.",
        "Rick: Easier said than done. Ivy's not exactly a team player these days.",
        "Quinn: Oh, we can work together. We'll make it happen and get you what you want.",
        "Maya: I really like what you've come up with so far.",
        "Rick: Just make those adjustments that I asked for.",
        "Quinn: Not a problem.",
        "Rick: Well, nothing further.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Um, you know, I was going to ask, uh, did you get my e-mail?",
        "Rick: Quinn, I-I get, uh, hundreds of e-mails. What is it?",
        "Quinn: Well, I-I sent you an invitation to my wedding. Deacon and I are getting married tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: All right, w-what could possibly send shock waves through Forrester?",
        "Katie: I could think of a few things.",
        "Bill: Yeah, no, no, no. Come on. I mean, Wyatt said it was a huge secret, something about Rick.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Well, maybe Wyatt shouldn't have been listening in on Maya's conversation.",
        "Bill: Katie, seriously? Wyatt gets a gold star on that one. Now he's just got to figure out what they were talking about.",
        "Katie: What is it you're hoping he's going to dig up?",
        "Bill: What am I hoping they're gonna dig up? Anything. Anything that will bring Rick down as CEO.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Maya's the one with the big story -- you know, the fame, fancy life.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but you're a part of that, too, now.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] I still feel like an outsider.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? Me, too. The only Spencer in the whole building.",
        "Nicole: You've got your mom.",
        "Wyatt: She's a Fuller, okay, soon to be Sharpe. And she's not exactly beloved around here.",
        "Nicole: Ah. Yeah. So I've heard.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Neither is Rick, actually.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] My sister would beg to differ.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Rick and Maya do seem pretty solid, but... what's your take on those two?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Let me get this straight. You're forbidding me from marrying Quinn.",
        "Brooke: That's right.",
        "Deacon: I mean, I-it would be nice to have your blessing.",
        "Brooke: You're not getting it.",
        "Deacon: I think that's clear.",
        "Brooke: Deacon, I'm worried about you. You're an addict. You're in recovery. The best thing to do is to focus on yourself, not go into a marriage with some psycho.",
        "Deacon: Look, Brooke. She's been good for me.",
        "Brooke: So, have you thought about how this might impact Hope?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, of course I have.",
        "Brooke: And you're willing to give up your relationship with our daughter just to be with Quinn?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: It's a big day for Deacon and me. I-if you didn't get the invitation, I could resend it.",
        "Rick: No, no. That won't be necessary.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I didn't mean to put you on the spot. It's just, well, you're my boss, and we'd love to have you.",
        "Rick: It's just, it's -- it's a busy week for us.",
        "Maya: We just have so much going on.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. We're not gonna be able to make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Justin, are you trying to give me a headache? No! [Chuckling] No, there's no negotiation. That's the deal. The deal I offered is the only one, and if they don't like it, they can eat --",
        "Katie: [Clears throat]",
        "Bill: ...They can go fly a kite. Okay?",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Katie: So, Wyatt said he was trying to track down Nicole?",
        "Bill: That's what his text said after he ran out of here.",
        "Katie: So he's gonna manipulate her.",
        "Bill: No! Not manipulate. Well -- why do you have to make it something ugly, all right? He's going to... avail himself as a friend... should she need someone to confide in. And spill every secret she knows about Rick.",
        "Katie: Listen, I understand that you don't want Rick to be C.E.O. I get it, a-and a part of me agrees with you. He's been a real jerk. But I just -- I feel like there might be a better way of going about this.",
        "Bill: There's not. We need to use every angle we can. Nicole knows something. And if it can help us take over Forrester... we have to find out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Rick and Maya letting me live in the house, hang around here -- life could be worse.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. It's no secret they -- they're very private people, hard to get close to. But I bet you get to see a whole 'nother side of them that no one else does.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Wyatt: Maya's gorgeous, successful. Rick seems to have it all. Doesn't mean their lives are perfect. Nobody's is, right?",
        "Nicole: True.",
        "Wyatt: I bet you get to see the whole inside perspective, a window into the real Rick and Maya.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I hope you understand.",
        "Quinn: Of course! Of course. I-it would've been so nice to have you at the wedding, but [Chuckles] I mean, you have a big company to run. There's no hard feelings.",
        "Maya: Well, we wish you well, and we hope you have a lovely day.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. And -- and thank you again, Rick, for the vote of confidence and giving me another chance to prove myself.",
        "Rick: You're very talented, Quinn. There's no one quite like you.",
        "Quinn: You know, I can't tell you how much I love being back here at Forrester. And it's an honor to work for you. You're a -- you're a great CEO. There's nobody better for the job.",
        "Rick: Well, not getting rid of me anytime soon.",
        "[All chuckle]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: There's got to be some way to get little Ricky out of there. The way he is abusing everybody around him, the stupid decisions he's making with my investment --",
        "Katie: Well, I do think that rehiring Quinn was totally irresponsible.",
        "Bill: Then you agree.",
        "Katie: I'm not sure.",
        "Bill: You will be. And Wyatt's our best shot. Hopefully, he's making headway with Nicole right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Maya and I hadn't seen each other in a long time, so it's been a process getting to know each other.",
        "Wyatt: I got you beat.",
        "Nicole: How so?",
        "Wyatt: I didn't even know I had a brother till a few years ago.",
        "Nicole: Oh, right. Liam. I heard about that.",
        "Wyatt: Yep. We were total strangers. I knew nothing about the guy, which is why I can definitely relate to what you're going through.",
        "Nicole: Well, do you get along now?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, for the most part. Still kind of a learning process.",
        "Nicole: Same thing with me and Maya -- trying to make up for lost time.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. It seems to be going okay.",
        "Nicole: Well, she's older. She wasn't really around much when I was little.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Nicole: I'm just finding out who she is.",
        "Wyatt: Mm. And she's discovering who you are, too.",
        "Nicole: It's cool. We're finally getting closer.",
        "Wyatt: That's good. Good for you.",
        "Nicole: Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: And what about Rick? How do you feel about him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Do you want Hope in your life?",
        "Deacon: What kind of question is that?",
        "Brooke: Well, then, how could you even think about marrying Quinn, after everything that Quinn took from her -- her marriage, her baby, her joy?",
        "Deacon: Listen, I spoke with Hope, all right? I invited her to the wedding.",
        "Brooke: I can't imagine she'll come.",
        "Deacon: No, probably not. But she also didn't read me the riot act.",
        "Brooke: So, then, you think she's okay with this?",
        "Deacon: That's how I'm choosing to look at it.",
        "Brooke: No, Deacon. No, she'll never be okay with you marrying Quinn.",
        "Deacon: What do you want to hear me say?",
        "Brooke: I want you to wake up! You were there for me. You were there for me when I needed help. Now you need help, and you won't let me help you.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, I'm fine.",
        "Brooke: No. No, you're not fine. You're being self-destructive.",
        "Deacon: Brooke!",
        "Brooke: Look. Maybe we won't ever have a future together. But I don't want to see you ruin your life. Deacon, please, don't do this. Do not marry Quinn. She is crazy. She \u0096",
        "Quinn: Enough, Brooke. You are gonna stop badmouthing me right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm not sure I really want to know all the details.",
        "Bill: Oh, no. I'm not keeping any secrets from you.",
        "Katie: What happens when Brooke finds out that I knew about this from the very beginning?",
        "Bill: It will be good for everyone to knock Rick off his pedestal, including Brooke.",
        "Katie: I'm not sure she's going to agree with you on that. She defends him. She's loyal to him.",
        "Bill: She's his mother, Katie.",
        "Katie: And I'm his aunt.",
        "Bill: All right, look. [Sighs] Don't start feeling guilty. What the boys and I are doing is right.",
        "Katie: I can't help it. I'm conflicted. I mean, sure. I know that Rick has been a total jerk. I get it.",
        "Bill: A jerk? He's being abusive, Katie -- abusive.",
        "Katie: Well, he must feel very inferior.",
        "Bill: You think? Have you stood next to the guy?",
        "Katie: Maya's behavior has been pretty despicable, as well. Maybe she has too much influence on him.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Maybe Nicole does, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Rick can be a bit of a mystery. Am I right?",
        "Nicole: I hadn't really thought about it.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? I was married to his sister, and he was my brother-in-law. And still, I-I could never -- I could never tell what he was thinking.",
        "Nicole: Well, he's really talkative with me.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, we've had some nice conversations.",
        "Wyatt: Really...? [Chuckles] What does a guy like that, that influential, comes from that kind of family -- what does he like to talk about? I mean, I never really had a good rapport with him.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] I don't know. He talks about work, Maya, family -- usual stuff.",
        "Wyatt: Huh.",
        "Nicole: We actually get along pretty well. Better than my sister and me.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. Then you must know the secret.",
        "Nicole: Um, I just realized I forgot that I told someone I was gonna have coffee with them.",
        "Wyatt: Oh.",
        "Nicole: So I'd better go.",
        "Wyatt: Uh...",
        "Nicole: Sorry.",
        "Wyatt: Nice meeting you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You know, people are human. They make mistakes. But the nerve of Quinn to ask us to attend her wedding...",
        "Maya: I wonder who else she invited.",
        "Rick: Doesn't matter. No one else will attend. It's gonna be her, Deacon, Wyatt. She's alienated herself from everyone else.",
        "Maya: Is it weird that I feel a little bad for her?",
        "Rick: Quinn dug her own grave. People are only willing to forgive so much. I mean, should I forget what she did to my sister, all the destruction she caused? No. I need her as a designer, but I'll never have her as a friend. I can't trust somebody like that. It's one thing being rehired. It's another asking people to embrace her, let alone support her wedding to Deacon. No. No way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I invited everyone to the wedding to show them how much I've changed. I-I've tried to put all of our differences aside for our families' sake, but, clearly, you can't. You know what, Brooke? Nobody's forcing you to come to this wedding. But stop trying to keep it from happening.",
        "Brooke: I'm not going to let Deacon make the biggest mistake of his life!",
        "Quinn: You don't have a choice in the matter! You don't get to tell him what he does or he doesn't do. He's not your little toy to play with. He is mine, all mine.",
        "Deacon: Enough. Enough! Both of you, stop it. Guys, we've got to put this to rest.",
        "Quinn: See? Deacon is as sick of your antics as I am.",
        "Brooke: You have nobody else looking out for you. I was just trying to protect you and your relationship with your daughter.",
        "Quinn: Ohh. Oh, please, Brooke! I am so disappointed in you. It's one thing to decline an invitation. It's another thing to guilt Deacon into not marrying me.",
        "Brooke: Don't blame me for caring.",
        "Quinn: We're getting married tomorrow. And it's going to be a beautiful wedding...without you there.",

        "Nicole: Hey, you busy?",
        "Maya: [Sighing] Oh. Not for you. What's up?",
        "Nicole: Nothing much. I just ran into that guy Wyatt.",
        "Maya: Oh, yeah?",
        "Nicole: Yeah. Seems nice.",
        "Maya: Mm, he's a Spencer. Comes from an extremely powerful, very wealthy family.",
        "Nicole: His dad owns all those magazines, right?",
        "Maya: Yeah, Bill Spencer owns lots of things, billions of things. But Wyatt works for Forrester, and he's a very important part of the team. And he was married to Hope, Rick's sister. But that didn't work out. So, needless to say, he and Rick aren't the best of friends.",
        "Nicole: Didn't realize.",
        "Maya: He was nice to you, wasn't he?",
        "Nicole: Oh, yeah. Wyatt was very nice to me.",

        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Wyatt: Hey. I just talked to Nicole.",
        "Bill: What'd she say?",
        "Wyatt: Well, it's not what she said, per se. It was more like the vibe that I got.",
        "Bill: Oh! There was a vibe.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: We can't do a lot with a vibe, Wyatt. We certainly can't take over a company with a vibe.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I know that --",
        "Katie: I have to agree with your father. You're gonna need something more solid than that.",
        "Wyatt: Geez, could either one of you let me talk?",
        "Bill: Go ahead. Tell us something, anything.",
        "Katie: What's Nicole like? Is she nice?",
        "Bill: Can't be any worse than her ex-con sister.",
        "Wyatt: Seriously? Seriously.",
        "Bill: Go! Talk!",
        "Katie: Go.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, fine. So, I talk to her, okay? She seemed a little guarded, like, you know, \"who is this devastatingly handsome man, and what does he want with me?\"",
        "[Both sigh]",
        "Wyatt: Okay, fine. The more we talked, the more she started to open up, like Rick letting her move in, that she never really saw Maya when they were younger. Now that they're older, they're getting to know each other more.",
        "Bill: Land the plane, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, all right! The kicker is, I deliberately used the word \"secret\" to see how she'd respond.",
        "Katie: And?",
        "Wyatt: Well, she got visibly uncomfortable. She got all tense and nervous, and then she got out of there.",
        "Katie: So she left?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. She made up some excuse, that she had to go somewhere -- coffee or whatever.",
        "Bill: Interesting. You may be on to something.",
        "Wyatt: I'm telling you, Dad. Rick and Maya have a secret, and we're gonna figure out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: I got to tell you, I'm really proud of how you just handled that.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I think I've finally mastered the art of dealing with Brooke.",
        "Deacon: I think she just might be finally getting it. You know, I think she's gonna leave us alone and let us live our life.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Hope you're right.",
        "Deacon: You know, I don't really give a damn what Brooke or anyone else thinks about you, 'cause I know who you are, and I love you anyway.",
        "Quinn: You're such a sweet-talker.",
        "Deacon: So, tomorrow, you're gonna be my wife.",
        "Quinn: And you're gonna be my husband.",
        "Deacon: It's your last chance to back out.",
        "Quinn: I wouldn't dare.",
        "Deacon: I can't believe we're really gonna do this. I mean, tomorrow, you are gonna make me the luckiest man in the world.",
        "Quinn: Damn right I am.",
        "Deacon: Yeah.",
