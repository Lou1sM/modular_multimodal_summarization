        "Liam tells Quinn to get out or he will throw her out. She is just there to do damage control for her son to get Liam to back off. That is not going to happen. He emphasizes there is nothing she can do or say that will get him to give up on Hope; nothing! Quinn tells him that Hope doesn't need him to protect her. She needs a man and doesn't need some whiney little boy who throws temper tantrums every time he doesn't get what he wants. His father gave him a position in the company and just spoiled him. He should be grateful for what he does have and not hold onto what isn't his. She knows he thinks the worst of her and Wyatt. But she declares they are not evil. They may not be squeaky clean but when you have worked for so long and hard then it is not easy to be. They had to fight and claw and hustle their way to the top and she is not going to apologize for that and she's not going to let him judge her for that either. He went too far today. He scoffs that she is the last person who should be lecturing him about going too far. Quinn says do not compare the two. If she has made any mistakes at all it is because she has let her passion and ambition get the better of her. He tried to get Hope alone so he could beg her to get back to him. He says she is right ..all Hope is to her is ambition, a connection to one of the most prestigious companies in the world. She points out that FC works with them because they have an exceptional product. She and Wyatt have earned their respect .everyone except for Liam .which is a shame as she was hoping he could get along with Wyatt as brothers. Hope tells Wyatt that Liam is out of control. Wyatt agrees. That is exactly how he would describe it too \u0096 kidnapping her, stealing his camper but it is okay now as they are back in the office safe and sound. Hope adds and not pregnant and she could have been. And she realizes that Liam over-reacted. Wyatt adds and Liam calls him and his mom crazy. They don't know if Liam ever towed and RV before. He had no idea what he was doing and could have hurt Hope. Donna drops in on Katie who tells her she can not have lunch today. She has a million things to do. Donna says and the most important is to deal with Brooke. Katie says sorry, she has a business to run and can not think about Brooke and her vendetta. And that is what it is to get back together with Bill and then call her in the middle of the night to brag about it. She is surprised Brooke did not put her on the speaker phone so Ridge could hear it all too. So just leave her out of it. She and Bill have a son and that is all that they share. Every time she thinks the next time will be different. They will be able to have an understanding and have a normal conversation. But every time she is with Brooke every word out of her mouth drips with contempt. She's not that little kid anymore so Brooke doesn't get to talk to her that way. So why don't they make a list and see who gets to be angrier. She is in love with Ridge and she is not going to apologize to Brooke or anyone. Karen is shocked that Brooke wants her to fire her sister. Brooke says she wants what is best for both families and Spencer Publications. It sounds harsh, but she's not being vindictive. Katie just should not be running the family business. Karen should give Bill back his job and he will take charge. She only put Katie in charge to punish Bill for being involved with Brooke. Karen says she could not trust his judgment anymore. Katie has done a good job and the employees love her and she doubts she will stay on if she gives Bill her job. Brooke argues that SP is not Katie's passion, but it is Bill's and always has been. Justin tells Bill during a workout that the company numbers don't look good. He better hurry back to the job or there will be nothing to come back to. Justin says Karen is back in town. He needs to set up a meeting with her. Find his mojo and their next meeting will be at the Spencer Gym. Brooke calls Bill and asks how quickly can he get cleaned up and meet her at Il Giardino. He laughs and says he just had lunch there with Justin but he will meet her. Karen inquires and Brooke says it's just a project she is working on.",
        "Hope tells Wyatt that it would be great if everybody could get along. Wyatt says it would be awesome if Liam accepted their relationship but he doesn't see that happening. She says it isn't just about them and the pregnancy test. It's her mom and Katie, Rick and Ridge, even his mom; the families are a mess. When she does have a baby she wants to bring it into a family that is nurturing and supportive. While she was waiting for the test results it became very clear that all this tension and fighting isn't healthy for any of them. Wyatt says he hears her but it's more like a message for Liam, not him. He followed them to Hawaii, even down PCH to Emerald Bay. He's been dogging them ever since they got together. This time Wyatt says he was doing the chasing and he's never ran so fast in his life. Even faster than when he was in the forest and met her. Then she was just some girl he met in the forest ..beautiful, magical and devious. But he didn't know her or what he would lose if he let her get away. And now he does. It doesn't matter how fast he has to run, what kind of surprise he has to deal with or changes they have to make .he will always be there right beside her. Liam tells Quinn that he will tell her the reason he and Wyatt will never get along and it's not because he is jealous or judgmental like she says. It is because he and Wyatt are nothing alike. And in the end that is why Hope will pick him. Quinn points out that he begged her to come back and she didn't. Liam says that is only a matter of time. He has a philosophy that decency and honesty win out in the end; people tend to gravitate towards what's good. At least he tries. He doesn't have to do anything to lure Hope back; just has to be himself. She and Wyatt can be themselves and see in the end who's the most obvious Hope should be with. Quinn says it already is; it's her son. Katie tells Donna that she is upset with her because she spoke with Eric but there is nothing to worry about. He gave her the opportunity to have her cake and eat it too. Now she can have her claws in two men; live with Bill and work with Ridge. Donna thinks she is reading way too much into this. Katie says no after everything that happened. Remember the last time when she read too much into it is when she accused Brooke for having feelings for Bill and she denied it. She doesn't want to put Donna in the middle but if she knows things she needs to let Katie know. Bill walks up and asks Brooke and Karen what is going on. Brooke says he wanted to talk to Karen and she seemed reluctant to get on the phone. Brooke says they can talk business later; they should just relax and catch up. Karen starts to get up and leave and says this is not a very good idea. Brooke begs her to stay. Bill asks why did Karen turn on him."

        "Katie: Oh, no, that's okay. Come on in. We're -- we're through. Thank you. Donna, I'm sorry. There's no way I can do lunch today. I'm dealing with a million things.",

        "Brooke: I want what's best for both families and Spencer Publications. I know this sounds harsh, but I'm not being vindictive. Just hear me out and you will agree a change needs to be made. My sister should not be running your family business.",

        "Wyatt: Hope, you aren't pregnant -- you never were -- but what Liam did -- stealing my truck, running off with you...",
        "Hope: Trust me -- I know. He overreacted.",
        "Wyatt: He lost it. Has he ever towed an RV before? No, he had no idea what he was doing. He could've hurt you. He calls me and my mom crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hope doesn't need you to protect her, Liam.",
        "Liam: You have no idea what she needs.",
        "Quinn: She needs you to be a man, not a whiny little boy who throws a tantrum every time he doesn't get what he wants! Your father thinks he was doing you such a favor giving you a position in his company. All he's done is spoil you. You need to learn to be grateful for what you have and not try to hold on to what isn't yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You know what, Donna? I have a company to run. I don't have time to worry about Brooke and her vendetta against me.",
        "Donna: What vendetta?",
        "Katie: Oh, come on. Getting together with Bill and then calling me in the middle of the night to brag about it? I mean, I'm surprised she didn't make me put her on speaker phone so Ridge could get the message loud and clear.",
        "Donna: Sweetie, they're not just together. Bill's actually living with Brooke now.",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm well aware. Good for them. Just leave me out of it. Bill and I have a son, and that's the only thing we share.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Tell me. It's my company. How bad is it?",
        "Justin: It's pretty bad, man. Could get worse if you don't find a way to get your job back.",

        "Karen: He wants his job back.",
        "Brooke: Well, you should give it to him.",
        "Karen: Why?",
        "Brooke: Because he's your brother. And he's the best person for the job. And you know he will find a way to take charge whether you help him or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Did you get my statement about the new commission ruling?",
        "Man: Legal has it.",
        "Woman: We think it should be an op-ed in one of the dailies.",
        "Katie: Let's wait and see what Legal has to say. Thank you.",
        "Donna: What was that about?",
        "Katie: Just being cautious, something Bill never did when he was C.E.O.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Can't lead from a place of fear. I use my instincts. I anticipate. You have to be able to react like that. That is not how Katie operates.",
        "Justin: Very true. Look how long it took for her to come to her senses about you.",
        "Bill: You know how many gossip sites have popped up on the internet just in the last week? And Forrester, they streamed their last fashion show live. How come we didn't cover that?",
        "Justin: Karen's in town. Dude, set up a meeting.",
        "Bill: She's ignoring me. Let me tell you something. Eventually, she's gonna pay for that.",
        "Justin: If you have any ideas, I think Karen should hear them.",
        "Bill: Oh, no. Karen is not getting a single idea -- nothing from me -- until I am once again captain of my ship.",
        "Justin: Oh, wow. Listen at you. You know, I didn't think you were gonna get Katie back. You managed that. So find your mojo. Our next workout will be at the Spencer gym.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Hi. What are you doing right now?",
        "Bill: Well, actually, I just finished a little sparring session with Justin, but now he is headed to the office.",
        "Brooke: Well, how fast can you clean up and get over here to Il Giardino?",
        "Bill: Uh, well, actually, I just got back from there. I had lunch with Justin. So why don't you come home, and I'll keep you company?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] I'm already here, and I have a table.",
        "Bill: So you just assumed I'd be free. Of course. Why wouldn't you?",
        "Brooke: Please?",
        "Bill: All right, you got it. I'll be there as quickly as I can.",
        "Brooke: All right.",
        "Karen: Work call?",
        "Brooke: Oh, it's just a project that I'm working on.",
        "Karen: Professional or personal?",
        "Brooke: Little bit of both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Wouldn't it be great if everyone could just get along?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. It would be awesome if Liam just accepted our relationship, but I so don't see that happening.",
        "Hope: But it isn't just you, me, and Liam. It's my mom and Katie. It's Rick and Ridge and your mom. Wyatt, our families are a mess.",
        "Wyatt: No, this is about the pregnancy test.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, when I do have a baby... I want to bring him or her into a family that is nurturing and supportive. And when I was waiting on that test result, a few things became very clear to me, and one of them is that all of this tension and fighting... it's not healthy. It's not good for any of us.",
        "Wyatt: No, I -- I hear you. But this sounds more like a message for Liam, not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You really think the worst of us, don't you?",
        "Liam: I just know who you really are, Quinn. That's all.",
        "Quinn: We're not evil. Wyatt and I may not be squeaky clean, but when you have had to work as long and as hard as we have, it is hard to be. Did we have to fight and claw and hustle our way to the top? You bet we did, and sometimes that's what you have to do to get where you want to be in life. But I'm not gonna apologize for that, and I'm not gonna let you judge us for it, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You know, Liam's never done anything like that.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Hope, he followed us all the way to Hawaii, tracked us down on PCH. Liam's been dogging us ever since we got together.",
        "Hope: Yeah, well, this was -- this was a little different.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. But this time, I was doing the chasing. I have never run that fast in my life.",
        "Hope: Even when you ran after me in the forest?",
        "Wyatt: Way faster.",
        "Hope: Wow. You must really love that truck.",
        "Wyatt: No. Hope, look... back then, you were just some girl in the forest, who was beautiful, magical, and devious. But I didn't know you. I had no idea what I would lose if I let you get away. And now I do. Look, I don't care how fast I have to run, what kind of surprises I have to deal with or changes we have to make. I will always be right beside you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You went too far today, Liam, and I think you know it.",
        "Liam: Oh, come on. You know, you're the last person to be lecturing me on going too far.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Don't compare your behavior to mine. You tried to get Hope alone so you could beg her to take you back. If I've made any mistakes at all, it's because I let my passion and ambition get the better of me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right -- Hope is just an ambition to you, a connection to one of the most prestigious companies in the world.",
        "Quinn: Forrester works with us because we make an exceptional product. Wyatt and I have earned the respect of Forrester, their clients, and the entire fashion community -- everyone except for you. Which is a shame because I was hoping you and Wyatt could get along as brothers. Not all siblings can share that kind of connection. Sometimes...circumstances make it difficult.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, this time, they make it impossible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: You don't really think that Brooke has a vendetta against you.",
        "Katie: I just -- I don't know who she is anymore.",
        "Donna: It's funny. She says the same thing about you.",
        "Katie: You know, I keep thinking that the next time we're gonna get together, it'll be different. We'll be able to come to some kind of a understanding, to have a normal conversation. But every single time I'm with her, every word out of her mouth just drips with contempt.",
        "Donna: She doesn't mean it that way, okay? She's your big sis.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm not a little kid anymore. It's not okay to talk to me like that.",
        "Donna: You asked Eric to demote her.",
        "Katie: No, I asked Eric to stop playing matchmaker.",
        "Donna: And you don't think she has a right to be angry about that?",
        "Katie: Well, why don't we make a list and see who gets to be angrier?",
        "Donna: You're angry? I thought you were in love with Ridge and you couldn't be happier.",
        "Katie: I am. And I'm not gonna apologize about that -- not to Brooke or anyone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You put Katie in charge to punish Bill for getting involved with me.",
        "Karen: I didn't trust his judgment anymore.",
        "Brooke: But look what's happened to the company. And can you trust Katie's judgment now that she's involved with Ridge?",
        "Karen: Look, Katie's done some wonderful things with Spencer, and the employees happen to love her.",
        "Brooke: Then make her the head of human resources.",
        "Karen: I doubt she's gonna stay on if I give Bill her position.",
        "Brooke: If Spencer Publications was really her passion in life, she would. But it's not. But it is Bill's passion and it always has been. You and I both know what it takes to succeed. I know because I ran Forrester Creations. You have to have that fire, you have to have that intensity, and my children do. I see it in your daughter, as well. But with Katie, it's very different. She just wanted to make sure everybody knew that she was right and all of us were wrong. Especially me. Do you really want that in a mind-set as a C.E.O.?",
        "Bill: Brooke, what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Do you know why Wyatt and I will never get along?",
        "Quinn: Because you're jealous and judgmental.",
        "Liam: Because he's nothing like me. And in the end, that's why Hope's gonna choose me.",
        "Quinn: But you begged her to come back, and she didn't.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, she will. It's only a matter of time. You see, I have this philosophy that decency and honesty wins out in the end, that people have this tendency to gravitate toward what's good.",
        "Quinn: And that's you.",
        "Liam: At least I try. So, no, I don't have to do anything to lure Hope back to me. I just have to be me. Let's try an experiment. You and Wyatt, you can be you. And in the end, we'll see who it's more obvious Hope should be with.",
        "Quinn: Oh. But, Liam, it already is obvious. And that man is my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: [Sighs] You're upset with me for talking to Eric?",
        "Donna: Yeah. And I don't even see the point. If you and Ridge are as committed as you say you are and Bill is back with Brooke --",
        "Katie: Oh, what? Then there's nothing to worry about? Come on. Eric just gave her the opportunity to have her cake and eat it, too. She gets to live with Bill and work with Ridge. I mean, why have one man when you can dig your claws into two?",
        "Donna: Oh, Katie, come on. You are reading way too much into this.",
        "Katie: Are you kidding me? After everything that's happened? You remember the last time I was reading too much into things when I accused Brooke of having feelings for Bill, and she denied it and denied it to me? Well, maybe she didn't deny it to you. Listen, Donna, I'm sorry. I don't want to put you in the middle of things. But you cannot keep things from me. If you hear that Brooke is up to something, you have got to let me know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Bill, look who's here.",
        "Bill: Yes, my long-lost sister Karen. You two just happened to run into each other?",
        "Karen: Brooke invited me to lunch.",
        "Bill: Did she? Me too.",
        "Brooke: You wanted to talk to her, and Karen seemed reluctant to get on the phone.",
        "Karen: I've been busy.",
        "Bill: Helping Katie run my company -- our company -- into the ground?",
        "Brooke: Why don't you two talk about business later? Let's just spend the time to catch up. Come on.",
        "Karen: I don't think this is a very good idea.",
        "Brooke: Karen, wait. Please, just hear Bill out.",
        "Bill: What happened, Karen? Why'd you turn on me? I mean sure, all right. We had our differences over the years, but with all the big stuff? I was there for you. I supported you and Dani. I stepped in with Caroline. Made you a ton of money. I mean, doesn't that count for something? Instead you -- you turn on me, you team up with Katie. You -- you take Spencer from me. You know what that company means to me. It's like -- it's like kidnapping my child. You want to teach me a lesson? Lesson learned. You can't handle people like you handle business. I was wrong, the way that I treated you and Katie. I can't take it back. All I can do is learn from what this experience has taught me.",
        "Brooke: I became very close to your sister towards the end of her life, and family meant everything to her. I'm sure she would hate to see this. The way you and your brother are. You two should be happy. You should be working together.",
        "Karen: What about you and Katie? You're family, too.",
        "Brooke: Yes, but Spencer Publications is your family business, not hers.",
        "Bill: Is this why you asked us here today? To try and get Karen to reinstate me as C.E.O.?",
        "Brooke: Yes, Bill. That's exactly what I'm asking your sister to do."
