    ],
    "Recap": [
        "Ridge walks away from Dr. Wolin still thinking what he just said that he knew there was no way his son could be his. And he'd better come up with the cash or he will blow his horn. Brakes screech and Ridge looks back and the doctor is on the pavement hit by a truck. At the office Thomas continues to question Caroline of what is bothering her if she says it is not about Douglas. He tells her that she can tell him anything. Katie snarls at Brooke and says she thought she asked her not to tell Bill. Bill tells Katie do not blame Brooke as he would have found out about her drinking eventually. Katie says she is not sick and she did stop drinking but apparently that counted for nothing. She finally says okay if they want to hear the words, she is drinking and the reason she is drinking is the two of them ganging up on her. Bill says they are not and Brooke adds that she knows how hard it is as she still has moments when she is tempted. Katie turns on her and says drinking was never Brooke's real problem; it has always been men and one man in particular, the forbidden fruit, husband of her own sister. She knows if she had taken one more minute Brooke would have been in his arms. She has never got over him. But she knows she cannot be too obvious; she has to have a little compassion for her sis, Katie the pathetic lush. That way when the marriage does fall apart she won't feel so guilty when she is there for Bill probably in something silky and see through. Bill has had enough and he barks at her that is enough. Katie says it sure is and she has had enough of them trying to pretend nothing is happening when clearly it is. She tells Bill do not dare defend Brooke when it is obvious what she is doing. And now Brooke is hovering so Katie will never get better that way. And she can never get those words out of her head that Brooke is still in love with her husband. Brooke says this is getting nowhere and she will go.",
        "Katie cries for Bill not to put her in rehab, they can work this out together. He says they have tried but she needs some therapy. He wants his old Katie back. Somehow Brooke didn't really leave after all and she says she wants that too. Katie turns on her again and says Brooke is the problem. She would not be where she is now except for Brooke. Ridge comes in as Thomas is showing Caroline a design that he hopes his dad will consider for the next showstopper. He notices Ridge looks a little tense and asks if the meeting he had was rough. Ridge nods yeah and says he needs to spend some time with his wife and will look at Thomas's design later. Katie tells Brooke she can save her words of concern. She is not an alcoholic. And Brooke can apologize over and over because that is what she does \u0096 does something terrible, gets caught and then apologizes for it. And then everyone is supposed to go back and pretend it did not happen or rip their lives apart. Bill is stern again and tells her nothing has happened that cannot be fixed ..her problem with alcohol and her relationship with her sister. He loves her and is committed to their marriage and she should not doubt that. Katie says she does not want to talk about this in front of Brooke and that she needs to go. Brooke says okay and Bill walks her to the door. Ridge tells Caroline that Dr. Wolin tried to blackmail him and he must have been drinking and walked out into the street and got hit and now he is dead. She asks and he says he had nothing to do with it. And he took his secret with him and no one else knows so their secret is safe. Douglas is their son and Thomas never has to know. Bill walks back in the kitchen just as Katie lifts the bottle to her mouth. He tries to get it. She says after what just happened she needed something to take the edge off. He asks her nicely twice to give him the bottle and she won't put it down. Finally he grabs it and slams it into the sink breaking it. He says this is not about Brooke anymore; Katie has a problem with drinking. Katie says she has a problem all right but it's name is Brooke. She disrespected and disgraced her and she has every reason to be paranoid. Bill tells her that she needs to see her therapist. Katie says she does not need to have a therapist tell her it is inappropriate for Brooke to pop up unannounced to spend some time with Bill. He tells her that is not the way it was and can they just stick to the main issue \u0096 the drinking. Katie ignores that and asks Bill to hold her, all she needs is him .she cannot live without him."

        "Caroline: Douglas is fine.",
        "Thomas: So why isn't his mother? You know you can trust me, right? With anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I asked you not to say anything.",
        "Bill: Don't blame Brooke, Katie. I would have found out eventually.",
        "Katie: That your wife is lying to you?",
        "Bill: That my wife has been hiding liquor when she said she stopped drinking.",
        "Katie: I did stop.",
        "Bill: You tried.",
        "Katie: And I suppose that counts for nothing, right?",
        "Brooke: Of course, it does, but that is the nature of this disease.",
        "Katie: I'm not sick!",
        "Bill: But you're not yourself, either. The Katie I know wouldn't sit across a table from me and tell me there's nothing to worry about while she is secretly drinking and asking her sister to cover for her!",
        "Katie: Fine. Fine. You want to hear the words? I'll say the words. I've been drinking. But do you know what drives me to drink?! The two of you ganging up on me!",
        "Bill: No one is ganging up on you, Katie.",
        "Brooke: Quitting drinking isn't easy. There's days when I'm still tempted.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but drinking was never your real temptation, right? I mean, your main temptation has always been men. That's the forbidden fruit. One man in particular who just happens to be married to your sister.",
        "Bill: All right, stop it, Katie! You're deflecting!",
        "Katie: No, I'm not! This is as much about me as it is about you and Brooke!",
        "Bill: There is no Brooke and me!",
        "Katie: Really? So, I walk in here and the two of you are together, you're talking. I mean, another minute, and she would have been in your arms.",
        "Brooke: Katie, please.",
        "Katie: She wants another chance with you, Bill! She's never gotten over you! But you can't be too obvious, right, sis? I mean, you got to show a little compassion for poor, pathetic Katie, the lush. That way, when my marriage falls apart, you won't feel too guilty about being there for Bill, probably in something silky and see-through.",
        "Bill: Enough, Katie!",
        "Katie: You're right! It is enough! I have had enough of her trying to convince me that there's nothing going on between you two when clearly there is!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: You don't have to worry about me, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: I know I don't have to worry about you. But you're special to me, Caroline. I mean, you're the mother of my new little brother. Anyways, if -- if it's not about Douglas, could it be about his father?",
        "Caroline: What do you mean?",
        "Thomas: Well, I mean, you and Dad said that, uh, something was going on. Uh, he had to meet with someone?",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Okay, well, was it something important?",
        "Caroline: Possibly. And that's all I'm gonna say.",

        "Bill: This isn't getting us anywhere.",
        "Katie: Did you think that it would after I walked in on the two of you?",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: We were just talking, Katie.",
        "Katie: Yeah, about me and my secret stash of vodka, which I begged you not to mention. You couldn't wait to betray me!",
        "Bill: You shouldn't have done that, Katie. You put your sister in an unfair position.",
        "Katie: Don't you dare defend her when it's obvious what she's doing! She is using this to undermine our marriage. \"Bill, she says she's not drinking, but here's the proof.\"",
        "Brooke: No, no, that's not how it happened.",
        "Bill: We're concerned about you.",
        "Katie: Then stop pressuring me.",
        "Bill: We're not pressuring you, Katie. We just want you to get well.",
        "Katie: I do, too. And I'm trying. But I can't do that with her hovering!",
        "Brooke: Okay. I can see that I'm not wanted here, so I'm gonna go. But just know that I've been there. I know the kind of struggle, what it does to you, what it does to your life.",
        "Katie: My life was fine before I heard you tell my husband that you're in love with him. I cannot get those words out of my head!",
        "Bill: All right, there is nothing productive about doing this right now. Look... you tried to stop drinking on your own. Obviously it was more difficult than you thought.",
        "Katie: [Voice breaking] So you're giving up on me?",
        "Bill: No. Of course not. I love you, Katie. You are my wife. You're the mother of my son. We are a family.",
        "Katie: I know. And that means everything to me. You and Will mean everything to me.",
        "Bill: Then let's get you some treatment. You can't do this by yourself.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] You know, every morning I wake up and I think -- I think, \"Today's gonna be different. [Sniffles] Today [Sniffles] I'm gonna be better. I'm gonna be stronger for -- for Will and for you.\" But then something happens, and... like this, where I see the two of you together, and my resolve just shatters. I wish -- I wish I could believe that you would be true to me no matter what. I wish I could feel your belief in me.",
        "Bill: Katie. I do believe in you. I believe you want to get well.",
        "Katie: Then -- then don't stick me in rehab. We can do this together.",
        "Bill: We've tried that, Katie. It's not working.",
        "Katie: I'll try harder! We'll try harder!",
        "Bill: I want you well again. I want my Katie back.",
        "Katie: I want that, too.",
        "Brooke: We all do.",
        "Katie: Oh, God! This is all because of you! I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you! You are the problem!",

        "[Car horn honks]",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Ridge: Everything is fine. You and Douglas -- you're my world. I'm not gonna let anyone destroy that. He doesn't have any proof. He's just another guy who thinks he can shake down a wealthy family. That's all. He wants to meet me.",
        "Caroline: Are you going?",
        "Ridge: I'm gonna deal with this right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] Found it. Thought I left it at home, but it was in my office the entire time.",
        "Caroline: What is it?",
        "Thomas: It's this design that I've been working on forever, and I'm hoping Dad might consider it for the new showstopper.",
        "Caroline: You haven't shown it to him?",
        "Thomas: No, no, no. Gathering up the courage right now. Getting there. Yeah. It doesn't really follow the, uh, the design notes that we all worked on, but it complements the others, I think. I was kind of hoping somebody I respect as a designer as much as I do my dad might give me her feedback.",
        "Caroline: Oh. \"Her\" feedback?",
        "Thomas: Yes. Okay, look, I-I know we don't have the same design aesthetic, but you -- you always get where I'm going with something.",
        "Caroline: You do realize I have zero pull with your dad.",
        "Thomas: Oh, come on. You could get that guy to do anything you want. Anything. But that's -- that's not what I'm trying to do. Nope. I'm trying to gather the notes and things that I've learned and -- and up my game even further. Take a look. Come here. Okay? Right? Notice how I've taken, uh, the design elements and incorporated them in the bodice and the neckline and created this really asymmetrical profile, but, you know, it's -- it's different and it's dangerous on a dress like this, but it's eye-catching.",
        "Ridge: You want to tell Thomas?",
        "Caroline: Maybe we're just fooling ourselves, thinking that we can keep this secret for forever. I think that we can sit down with Thomas and explain everything.",
        "Ridge: [Scoffs]",
        "Caroline: And tell him why it's happening and how, and -- and I think he would understand.",
        "Ridge: If this secret gets out, it doesn't just get out for Thomas. It gets out for everybody. For the whole world -- my dad, Rick, everyone. Another scandal.",
        "Thomas: You know, I toyed with coming off the shoulder a little bit, but I thought that might be just a little casual for a Forrester showstopper. I don't know. Maybe not. What do you think? Caroline? Look, if you have something to say, you can say it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Hard at it, I see.",
        "Thomas: Dad, how's it going?",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Caroline: What happened?",
        "Ridge: Huh?",
        "Thomas: Caroline said you had a meeting. Looks like it was rough.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: So this is probably the wrong time to show you...",
        "Ridge: Wrong time for what, Thomas?",
        "Thomas: I was gonna run a design by you, but --",
        "Ridge: Yeah, no, I-I really need to spend some time with my wife alone.",
        "Thomas: Okay. No worries. I'll swing by another time.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Caroline: What's wrong? What happened with the doctor?",
        "Ridge: He's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I feel terrible about what I said, but I promised you nothing would come of it!",
        "Katie: And Brooke Logan always keeps her promises, right?",
        "Brooke: Yes! Yes, because I've been where you are!",
        "Katie: [Scoffs]",
        "Brooke: I am a recovering alcoholic, too.",
        "Katie: I am not an alcoholic, okay?! Save your words of concern. If you were really concerned about me, you never would have told Bill that you're still in love with him.",
        "Bill: Brooke has apologized for that over and over again.",
        "Katie: That's what she does! She does something terrible and she gets caught, and then she apologizes! And we're all supposed to just go back to the way things were and pretend like no one's life was ripped apart!",
        "Bill: Listen to me. Nothing has happened that can't be fixed. Your problem with alcohol, your relationship with your sister.",
        "Katie: What about our relationship? Can you fix that up, too? Especially since we both know that you'd rather be with her?",
        "Bill: That isn't true. I'm committed to you, Katie, to our marriage, to our family. I love you. I want you. Never doubt that.",
        "Katie: I don't want to talk about this in front of her, okay? You need to go. You shouldn't be here.",
        "Brooke: And I love you, too. I just wish you knew how much.",
        "Bill: Thank you for letting me know what's been going on. I'll walk you out.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: He's dead?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. I met Wolin in the park, and he tried to blackmail me, said I have 24 hours to get him $100,000 to shut him up.",
        "Caroline: Then what?",
        "Ridge: Then it happened.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Ridge: He stepped into the street and got hit by a truck.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God!",
        "Ridge: I guess he must have been drinking or something.",
        "Caroline: You had -- you had nothing to do with it?",
        "Ridge: No. Total accident. Well, apparently Wolin had hit hard times. He lost his practice. I don't know if it's 'cause of his drinking or what, but with his bitterness, he thought that we were gonna be his big payday. And I can't get it out of my head. He died instantly.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God. No one saw you, right? Like, not the driver or anything?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Caroline: Are you sure? Because if somebody saw you --",
        "Ridge: Caroline, please, can we -- don't freak out.",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: He was trying to ruin our lives.",
        "Caroline: I know, but if --",
        "Ridge: No. Did I want him dead? I-I don't know. Not our call. But he is dead now. And with him dies any chance of anyone finding out our secret. Hey. We can do this. Douglas is our son. Thomas never needs to know. No one knows the truth but us. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: What are you doing?! Put it down.",
        "Katie: No. No, not after what just happened. I need something to take the edge off.",
        "Bill: Give me the bottle, Katie.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Bill: Give me the damn bottle!",
        "Katie: What did she say to you just now?",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? You were there for everything!",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. I'm talking about when you walked her to the door.",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: That was very nice of you, by the way.",
        "Bill: Come on!",
        "Katie: I mean, was she like, \"Bill, you must be so frustrated\"?",
        "Bill: I am frustrated! I am frustrated that I can't seem to reach you! I am frustrated that you don't seem to understand how it is killing me to see what this is doing to you!",
        "Katie: She does this to me!",
        "Bill: This isn't about Brooke anymore! It's about this! The alcohol! You have a problem!",
        "[Bottle shatters]",
        "Katie: I have a problem, all right, and her name is Brooke! She disgraced me! She disrespected me! I have every right to be paranoid! She is the reason why I'm depressed! She is the reason why I am drinking! It's all because of her! [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Is that what you're telling your therapist, Katie?",
        "Katie: Oh, God.",
        "Bill: Are you seeing your therapist, Katie?",
        "Katie: I don't need a therapist to tell me that it is inappropriate for her to pop by unannounced and spend time with you!",
        "Bill: That's not how it was!",
        "Katie: Well, maybe not for you. Maybe. But for her, it was. Do you have any idea what it does to me?!",
        "Bill: Again, that's not how it was!",
        "Katie: This is how she operates. This is what she does. She is gonna come on to you, if she hasn't already, and maybe it won't be obvious, but you will be able to tell by the way she looks at you, by the way she smiles at you, by the way she giggles at you.",
        "Bill: Can we please address the actual issue?!",
        "Katie: What? The issue that I'm having a bit of a rough time right now, and I can't relax or let my guard down because she is targeting you?!",
        "Bill: Katie.",
        "Katie: No, she is. I can feel it. [Voice breaking] I can feel it. Please. Please, you have to -- you have to understand.",
        "Bill: I am... I am trying to understand.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Please, just -- just hold me. Please. I-I just want you. All I want is you.",
        "Bill: Me...and the alcohol.",
        "Katie: No. No. Just you. All I need is you. I don't want to live without you. I can't live without you. [Sighs]"
