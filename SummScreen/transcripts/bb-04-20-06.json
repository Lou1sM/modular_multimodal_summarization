        "Brooke checks with her doctor by phone to make sure the sedative she is thinking of taking isn't too much. Nick rushes in and finds her still very shaky from her visit with her dad. And he's sure that Ridge has his own agenda. If Ridge makes another man look worse than he, it only bolsters himself in Brooke's eyes. Brooke tells Nick that she asked her father to go back to Paris. He hopes that was the right thing to do. He knows that Ridge and his old man are working in cahoots to keep them apart, and they must not know that just isn't possible. He tells her he has to go wrestle a bull and she sends him off to do that. Sally gets a little testy with Megan over office duties. Stephanie sees this and questions Megan about her future with Forrester and if there is someone new in her life, something more important than a career at Forrester? Megan confides there is, something she just wants to keep to herself for now. Ridge and Stephen return and just let themselves into Brooke's house. Stephen is reluctant since Brooke had asked him to leave. Ridge says she is planning a future with Nick, so it can't get any worse. Ridge goes to find Brooke, leaving Stephen alone downstairs when Hope wanders down and they meet. He tells her he is her grandpa from Paris and he's sorry he's been so busy, he hasn't taken the time to come see her. He wants to make up for that. Brooke overhears some warm, fuzzy spots that he relates to Hope, how she is like her mother. She dismisses Stephen and insists that he go back to Paris. She's glad he met Hope because it's never going to happen again. Nick bolts into his father's office and chastises him again for choosing one son over the other and he wants his pop to get his mother out of jail. He begins to trash the office of busts, pictures, all for show ..and then he takes off his Marone ring and slams it on the table, saying the Marone Dynasty is garbage to him. Mass loses control and slaps him. Nick's parting words is that he gave Mass a chance to save himself, and he didn't take it remember that! Misty-eyed, Mass picks up the ring as Nick leaves. Ridge helps his cause by telling Brooke he thought she needed to get past her past and talk to her dad. That is the reason they came back. She states he's not helping her but himself. She orders her dad and Ridge to leave. She has the future she wants with Nick. Stephen sees how futile it is and tells Ridge right now Brooke doesn't need him. She really needs him to leave. He goes, but comes back and gives her one big hug, both shedding tears."

        "Brooke: Yes, doctor. I understand that this anxiety medicine is safe. It's just that I'm not used to taking sedatives, and I don't want to take too much. Yes. All right. Okay. Thank you.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Nick: Hey.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Nick: I got here as soon as I could. You okay?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, just -- just a little shaky. Yeah.",
        "Nick: It's okay. It's all right.",
        "Brooke: It's just kind of strange, you know -- [Brooke sighs] Seeing my father after all this time.",
        "Nick: I'm sorry.",
        "Brooke: No, it's okay.",
        "Nick: Why would Forrester bring him here?",
        "Brooke: To heal me, I guess. To heal my issues -- my issues of abandonment. So that I don't resent him anymore.",
        "Nick: Resent who? Ridge or your father? He brings the one person who's let you down more than he has. And why though? So he looks good in comparison.",
        "Brooke: I know. But it did make it clear to me, that I'm really, really lucky to have you.",
        "Nick: Hey.",
        "Brooke: I told my father to go back to Paris.",
        "Nick: Well, I hope that was the right, then. Now, listen. You know that my old man and Ridge -- they're working together.",
        "Brooke: They're trying to keep us apart?",
        "Nick: I guess they don't know that's just not possible.",
        "Brooke: I guess not.",
        "Nick: I gotta go wrestle a bull. I feel a little funny about leaving you alone here in case Forrester comes back with your father.",
        "Brooke: No, that's all right, yeah. You go. Go -- wrestle that bull.",
        "Nick: Be strong.",
        "Brooke: I will.",

        "Megan: Sally, whatever happened to that phone call with Giorgio?",
        "Sally: I haven't been able to get through yet.",
        "Megan: Did you talk to his assistant Henri?",
        "Sally: Yes. You know I did.",
        "Megan: No, I mean, did you call back? Sally, Henri just wants to make sure your call's important.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well I told how important it was.",
        "Megan: Okay. Sally, I'm more than happy to make that phone call for you, if you want.",
        "Sally: Thank you, but I got it covered.",
        "Stephanie: Okay, Sal. Let's not be so touchy. Let's talk about the Jackie M. Boutique situation. What can you tell me?",
        "Megan: I'm sorry?",
        "Stephanie: Well, it's your department. What's our potential loss of sales if she goes under, you know, with this tax fraud situation?",
        "Megan: From my department standpoint?",
        "Stephanie: Sally, would you place that call to Henri again now, but this time, tell him I'm on the line. Okay?",
        "Sally: Right. I'm on it.",
        "Stephanie: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephan: I want to help my daughter, Ridge. [Door closes] But another confrontation might just make things worse.",
        "Ridge: She's planning a life with Nick. Things can't get any worse.",
        "Stephan: You're not concerned about her reaction yesterday?",
        "Ridge: She just wasn't ready to listen, that's all.",
        "Stephan: Well, she might not be ready to listen today either. I've hurt her so much.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's why this is necessary then. Look, just stay here. I'll go find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephan: You must be Hope.",
        "Hope: Who are you?",
        "Stephan: I'm your grandpa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Nick: I'm hoping to hear you got my mother out of jail.",
        "Massimo: Overnight? With the courts closed, the judges sleeping? You flatter me, Dominick.",
        "Nick: Flattery is not what I have in mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Megan: What do you mean, \"what's going on?\"",
        "Stephanie: You're not happy. Are you not happy with the promotion?",
        "Megan: Oh gosh, Stephanie. It's not that I'm not grateful. I am --",
        "Stephanie: This is not about gratitude. It's about best efforts. And I don't feel that's what I'm getting from you.",
        "Megan: You're not. I'm just not sure this position is right for me.",
        "Stephanie: You don't like the job?",
        "Megan: No, I'm not saying that. Look, I -- Stephanie, I am honored that you have acknowledged my dedication to this company, and you've given me so much more responsibility and more money --",
        "Stephanie: This isn't about rewarding you for longevity of service. I moved you up because I always thought that your talents and abilities went unappreciated.",
        "Megan: Thank you for that. My gosh, I'm sorry, it's just --",
        "Stephanie: Look, look -- let's be honest.",
        "Megan: Okay -- I appreciate the raise -- I really do -- and your confidence in me. But Stephanie, what I love is the creativity and the energy of this business, and even though my old position didn't have much growth potential, you know, I was right there in the middle of all the action.",
        "Stephanie: You miss the excitement of being up here on the executive level?",
        "Megan: Yes, I do. But you know the thing I miss the most? I miss being close to the Forrester family. That's what I really miss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Get her out.",
        "Massimo: Dominick, I am not the one standing in the way of her freedom.",
        "Nick: I'm not leaving Brooke.",
        "[Massimo sighs]",
        "Massimo: Well, then I see nothing but strife in the future for the Marones. That includes your mother.",
        "Nick: If this Marone family falls apart, that'll be on you. You and your obsessive need for control. I'm through with it.",
        "Massimo: Through with what? Me?",
        "Nick: No. You and me? I think we're just getting started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephan: I'm your mommy's daddy, and that makes me your grandpa.",
        "Hope: Mommy's daddy?",
        "Stephan: Yes, sweetheart. And I'm sorry that I haven't been to visit you -- but I live very far away, in Paris.",
        "Hope: Grandpa from France.",
        "Stephan: Your mommy's told you about me?",
        "Hope: She says you're very busy, that's why you miss Christmas and birthdays.",
        "Stephan: That's not a very good excuse, is it?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Stephan: No. Well, I'd like to make that up to you. Do you think I could do that?",
        "Hope: I don't know.",
        "Stephan: Well, what if I apologize to you? Would you forgive me?",
        "Hope: Okay. Want to see my picture?",
        "Stephan: Sure, I would love to. Wow, so you went to the beach.",
        "Hope: Yes, we went camping.",
        "Stephan: Your mommy loves camping.",
        "Hope: She used to go with you.",
        "Stephan: Yes, we went camping a lot.",
        "Hope: She was your night bird.",
        "Stephan: My night owl, yes. Yes she was.",
        "Hope: You let her stay up and look at the stars.",
        "Stephan: To tell you the truth, I would've let your mommy do just about anything she wanted. She was so smart. Even as a little girl, way smarter than me. She just soaked up everything around her. She had a sense of wonder and curiosity. And I see that in you, too.",
        "Hope: Can you come camping next time?",
        "Stephan: I would love to. Really, I would love to.",
        "Brooke: I'm afraid that's not going to be possible. I'm sorry, sweetheart. But your grandpa has to go back to Paris tonight. So, why don't you run along and find Catherine? Say good-bye. It's time for your snack. The grownups have to talk.",
        "Hope: Bye.",
        "Stephan: Bye, sweetheart. She's beautiful. And so much like you.",
        "Brooke: I'm glad you enjoyed meeting her, Dad. Because it's never going to happen again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Massimo: I don't want to fight with you, Dominick.",
        "Nick: I want my mother out of jail. I want Forrester to back off.",
        "Massimo: I don't want to fight with you -- but I will. If it means saving this family.",
        "Nick: \"Saving this family?\" You choose one son over the other, but it's my love life that's screwing this family up?",
        "Massimo: I keep saying it. You and ridge are equally --",
        "Nick: Ridge is not a Marone! Forget about blood. He's a Forrester at heart. Always has been and always will be. Me? I respected your name long before I knew it was mine. When I made captain, it was the second proudest day of my life. And when I found out I was your son, it was the first, because Marone meant something to me. It meant hard work and loyalty and honor. Now you tell me where the honor is in what you're doing to my mother, and what you're doing to my relationship with Brooke. And for what? What is the point? Tell me! This? This? Well, I don't buy it. I don't but any of it! Any of it! This! Tell me what this is. This. This. This is hollow. And empty. And these pictures, all of these things. What is this? This is for show! [Glass shatters] For show. All for show. Your Marone dynasty? It's garbage to me.",
        "Massimo: Enough!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephan: You told hope about our camping trips.",
        "Brooke: What did you expect me to tell her, dad? The truth?",
        "Stephan: You enjoyed them as much as I did.",
        "Brooke: It's too bad you didn't stick around to take us on a few more.",
        "Ridge: He's here now, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Well, he shouldn't be! Why did you bring him back here, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Because I thought you could use another chance to talk.",
        "Brooke: Nick warned me that you might try to do this.",
        "Ridge: I'm trying to help you, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: No. You are trying to help yourselves.",
        "Ridge: Look, this problem affects all of us. So why don't we just face it together?",
        "Brooke: Face it? I have faced it. I have faced it every single day of my life!",
        "Ridge: Okay, well then it's time to get past it.",
        "Brooke: Do you think this is just about me? A poor, scared little girl, wondering where her daddy went and when he was coming back. There's another little girl here, Ridge. And she looked at you as if you were her father. And you abandoned her the same way my father abandoned me. And now you want us both back? Well you can't. It happened. And I'll be damned if I let it happen again!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Megan: Stephanie, you can say a lot of things. But even you would have to admit that Brooke and Ridge do have great chemistry.",
        "Stephanie: Pardon me if I don't respond to that, right now. Let's just talk about you and your job and lack of satisfaction in it.",
        "Megan: Okay. You know, Stephanie, maybe -- I don't know -- maybe I'm at a point in my life where I just want to focus my energy somewhere else. All the time I've spent here -- there were days where I didn't know if I had a life outside of these walls.",
        "Stephanie: Are you thinking of leaving us?",
        "Megan: I'm just not sure if Forrester is the right place for me anymore. But then again, I couldn't even imagine being anywhere else, so --",
        "Stephanie: Gosh, Megan.",
        "Megan: I don't know what the future holds for me.",
        "Stephanie: Well, who does? But please don't rush into anything.",
        "Megan: Yeah, I know. Sometimes, you just have to take the lead.",
        "Stephanie: Are you seeing someone new?",
        "Megan: Well, I'm just -- I'm just trying to keep it between the two of us for now. It's all very new, and -- but yes. And I'm just really hoping everything works out.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I hope he's a nice guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I gave you a chance to save yourself. And you didn't take it. Remember that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I want you to leave.",
        "Stephan: Not like this.",
        "Brooke: Why not? What more do you want? You want time with Hope? You have family photos? Money? How 'bout some money?",
        "Stephan: Can't we just talk?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Ridge: Please, just hear him out.",
        "Brooke: I've heard enough already, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, I wouldn't have brought him here if I didn't believe this would help. Your father is the only person that can help you deal with all of these issues that are pulling our family apart. If we want the future that we want to have --",
        "Brooke: No, I have the future that I want! With Nick!",
        "Ridge: Look, if you won't give me another chance, at least give one to your father.",
        "Brooke: I can't.",
        "Stephan: I know you're scared, Brooke. I've let you down, so many times.",
        "Brooke: Just leave.",
        "Stephan: Okay. If that's what you want.",
        "Ridge: Oh come on, Stephan.",
        "Stephan: I have caused my daughter enough pain, Ridge. If she doesn't want me here, I can't stay.",
        "Ridge: She needs you.",
        "Stephan: Right now, she needs me to leave. Good-bye, Brooke. I am sorry. For everything.",
