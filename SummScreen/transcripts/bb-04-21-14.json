        "In her office, Brooke looks over the papers Bill had Katie sign. But she stuffs them in her purse when Hope walks in. Hope confides in her mother that for a short while she thought she might be pregnant. Brooke says she has to be very careful about contraception unless she is very sure she is ready to be a parent. Hope says she knows and that has really got her to thinking. Wyatt tells his mother the same thing. It was a scare but Hope is not pregnant. He admits he is having a little trouble figuring out how he feels about it. Quinn says an unplanned pregnancy doesn't have to be the end of the world. It could be the beginning of something wonderful. She says she was lucky. She had a little bit of money and a driving passion to make beautiful things ..and he certainly was the most beautiful thing she ever made. He admits he was terrified when Hope thought she was pregnant but then disappointed when she figured out she wasn't. He didn't know he'd want it so much as he does. She asks if he proposed or if they thought what would happen if she were pregnant. He says no Hope knows how he feels. Quinn says but a woman likes to hear it. He opines that you don't ask that question unless you are very sure the answer is going to be yes. She asks if he would like her to talk to Hope. He says no emphatically. She keeps pushing that she would not mention a baby but just have a casual conversation with Hope about other people's babies. Again he keeps telling her no and no means just that \u0096 no. She says then there is something she needs to tell him. She went to the beach the other day and ended up at Liam's. Wyatt says please don't tell him there is a body to dispose of. She says don't get dramatic. No, but she did physically assault him .not with a shovel but with her hands when she pushed him. Wyatt asks why just as Liam opens a closed door and says he'd like to hear the answer to that too. He asks Wyatt if he is okay with that with Quinn coming to his house and assaulting him on Wyatt's behalf for kidnapping Hope. Wyatt turns to his mother and says if there is any more physical assaulting to be done she can leave it to him.",
        "Maya and Carter listen to her secret recording of Oliver and she is sure he is just using Aly to keep his job at FC. Meanwhile Oliver kisses Aly and asks if he can change in the pool house so they can do some underwater shooting. She's a little nervous but tells him to stay when he says if she is afraid for them to be there alone that he will go. Brooke is not happy to hear about the kidnapping of Hope. Hope begs her not to make this into too much as Liam really was worried about the pregnancy. And she realizes she can lose him and she's not ready for that either. Wyatt said all the right things but she is not sure what she would have done if the tests came back positive. It just wouldn't have fit in with the way she and Wyatt are with so much fun and adventure. They'd have to change. She does want a baby in the future but just not right now. She thinks she was probably just too uptight when she was with Liam. Brooke admits she is much more carefree now, with Liam she was more cautious and careful. He's been steadfast and loyal now but it's up to her to decide if it is too late. Quinn asks Liam why is he here. He doesn't work at FC, has no friends there so why is he there. Wyatt asks his mother for a few minutes also with Liam. She doesn't want to leave. He says she is though. Wyatt tells Liam that he is not going to apologize for Quinn. Liam says of course not, that would be tacky since she does all of his dirty work. Wyatt tells him to feel free to go find Hope and grovel as she did not like being kidnapped. Liam says and she also did not like the idea of being tied to Wyatt for a lifetime either. Wyatt offers that Hope does have a sentimental attachment to Liam and she just doesn't want to hurt him. She's too soft hearted to just cut him off. Liam says all this time he just thought Wyatt was pushy but now he sees that he is scared. He has no doubt that Hope doesn't want to lose him and she is about to find out soon what it is going to take not to lose him. Wyatt says Liam is like year old gum stuck to the bottom of a shoe. Hope is trying to scrape him off. Liam says he'll see. He doesn't have a long list of demands; just one but it is non-negotiable \u0096 equal time. Wyatt scoffs, like he really is gonna share her. Liam says it is not up to Wyatt. He says Wyatt took about all he could take and it proved to be too much. Oliver and Aly enjoy their underwater shoot and continue kissing. Quinn stops at the desk to glance through the phone messages and overhears Hope and Brooke talking so she leans in closer to the door. She hears Hope say some changes will have to be made. There are feelings she has to accept. She loves Wyatt but there is always the element of fantasy when they are away from everything and everyone and she has to ask if that is real. And when she thinks about marriage and children, she thinks about Liam and he is thinking that way too. She doesn't know what she is going to do but she doesn't think Liam will put up with it much longer or that she can ask him too."

        "Hope: Mom, hey. I was looking for you. Sorry. Are you in the middle of something?",

        "Hope: Uh... no. I guess -- I guess I'm still just a little freaked out. Um... I thought that I was pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: But she's not. I assume that's what you mean by \"Scare.\"",
        "Wyatt: No, she's not.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] And how do you feel about this?",
        "Wyatt: I'm having a little trouble...figuring out how I feel about it.",
        "Quinn: Well, an unplanned pregnancy doesn't have to be the end of the world.",
        "Wyatt: True.",
        "Quinn: It could be the beginning of something wonderful.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I can always count on you for non-standard maternal advice.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Well, look, it does change everything. That's true. And [Sighs] Some girls lose themselves and never recover.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Quinn: But, you know, I was lucky. I had a little bit of money and a driving passion to make beautiful things. You are the most beautiful thing I ever made.",
        "Wyatt: Oh...",
        "Quinn: And I don't regret you for a minute.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] It's just -- I was terrified when she thought she was pregnant, and then I was disappointed when she figured out she wasn't.",
        "Quinn: Oh, Honey. It's only natural. Like the thrill of learning that you and Hope were gonna make me a grandmother.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I mean, it's -- the sudden idea of something you didn't know that you could want so much. And now I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: So, that sounds okay to you? Or \"Genuine,\" I think was your word.",
        "Carter: Oliver doesn't come off well.",
        "Maya: Thank you.",
        "Carter: But I have to say, neither do you. I love you, but recording the guy without his knowledge?",
        "Maya: Aly is a teenager and a sheltered one at that. Her father is out of the country. Her grandfather still treats her like she's 12.",
        "Carter: Babe, is that really any of our business? Or do you have some reason for thinking Oliver's trouble?",
        "Oliver: So, is it okay?",
        "Aly: Uh...yeah.",
        "Oliver: Is there somewhere I can change?",
        "Aly: Change?",
        "Oliver: For the underwater shoot. Or did you forget?",
        "Aly: [Chuckles]",
        "Oliver: Are you all right? If it's weird that I'm here with you together alone, I'll go.",
        "Aly: Stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I never said Oliver was trouble, but how sincere does he sound?",
        "Carter: Again, I have to wonder why that should be our call.",
        "Maya: So, it's nothing to you that a naive young girl is being taken advantage of?",
        "Carter: [Scoffs] What advantage has he taken?",
        "Maya: You heard him, Carter. It's obvious that the Forresters' wealth and position are the main attraction.",
        "Carter: I heard he was willing to let you think so. Might there be another reason for that?",
        "Maya: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: You can change in the pool house.",
        "Oliver: Is it locked?",
        "Aly: Inside the gates, there's really nothing locked.",
        "Oliver: All this is amazing.",
        "Aly: Mm, sometimes I get embarrassed.",
        "Oliver: Why?",
        "Aly: We have so much and some people have so little.",
        "Oliver: Your grandfather -- he worked hard for his success.",
        "Aly: I didn't.",
        "Oliver: But you're a part of it. You're so beautiful. You're at home here.",
        "Aly: I feel so strange when you say things like that to me.",
        "Oliver: You don't want me to?",
        "Aly: I...want you to say whatever you really mean.",
        "Quinn: Have you, you know, thought about it?",
        "Wyatt: What we would have done if it were true?",
        "Quinn: You must have discussed it.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, we seemed to be making the same assumptions -- that having a child would change everything.",
        "Quinn: And you'd be together.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, I think that's what we were saying.",
        "Quinn: Did you propose?",
        "Wyatt: [Clicks tongue] She knows how I feel.",
        "Quinn: Well, maybe she needs to hear how you feel.",
        "Wyatt: Look, you don't just ask that question if you're not very sure the answer's gonna be yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So, you're sure?",
        "Hope: Yes. Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Brooke: Okay. [Sighs] It was just a false alarm.",
        "Hope: Yeah. I just never thought that it would happen to me.",
        "Brooke: Honey, you have to be very careful about contraception to avoid a pregnancy... unless, of course, you're absolutely sure you're ready to be a parent.",
        "Hope: I know. And that has really got me thinking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: He notices you.",
        "Maya: Oliver? [Chuckles]",
        "Carter: Let's just say I noticed him noticing. Of course he does. You're amazing. I take no offense to that. But when a man is talking to a woman he's attracted to, everything he says is filtered through that.",
        "Maya: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Carter: I can explain. But first, you have to promise never to tell anyone I revealed to you the secrets of manhood.",
        "Maya: [Scoffs, groans]",
        "Carter: Now, when you see a man with his clothes off, you still haven't seen him naked.",
        "Maya: Okay. I swear. [Chuckles] This better be good.",
        "Carter: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: How good do you want to look, Miss F?",
        "Aly: I don't mind my looks. Really, I don't. It's just I don't recognize myself when you talk about them.",
        "Oliver: I know how to settle this. You want to look for this light.",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Oliver: That means it's powered-up and unlocked.",
        "Aly: Are there settings to set?",
        "Oliver: Leave something to the professionals. And...then you just press this, and the video comes on.",
        "Aly: Are we on?",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Oliver: See what I mean? Aw, come on. Hey. How about that swim?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Would you like me to talk to Hope?",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Quinn: Just to sound her out, you know?",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Quinn: I'll have, maybe, a few casual conversations with other pe--",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Quinn: Not Hope, other people. Just to see, maybe --",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Quinn: Well, what about Eric, because maybe he thinks that you and Hope would be a good match.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, no.",
        "Quinn: And then what about Aly? Because maybe Aly -- she heard of your intentions, and --",
        "Wyatt: Is there something indefinite sounding about the answer I'm giving you? No means no.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: So, no.",
        "Quinn: All right.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Well, then... there is something that... maybe -- well, that you need to know that I did -- I did do. I went to the beach.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: But I didn't go to your place. I went to Liam's, and --",
        "Wyatt: Please don't tell me there's a body to dispose of.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, don't be so dramatic. Liam is fine. It's just -- I may have -- well, I did. I... physically assaulted him.",
        "Wyatt: What do you mean physically assaulted him?",
        "Quinn: Not with a shovel. With -- with my hands.",
        "Wyatt: Why would you physically assault him?",
        "Quinn: I --",
        "Liam: You know, I'd like to hear the answer to that, too.",
        "Quinn: Because he deserved it for hijacking Hope.",
        "Liam: Is there a psychological term for people who accuse other people of crimes they, themselves, committed?",
        "Quinn: You know, I would ask a psychiatrist, but I don't know any.",
        "Liam: Why does that not surprise me? So, you're okay with this, right? Her coming to my house, getting physical with me on your behalf?",
        "Wyatt: Mom, if -- if there's any more physical assaulting that needs to be done, you can leave that to me.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I don't like the sound of this. What if there had been accident? And doesn't it require a special driver's license to drive one of those huge RVs?",
        "Hope: No, it doesn't. But don't make this all about physical safety, because Liam was responding to another kind of danger. [Sighs] Mom, I could have lost him for good. And I know that I'm not committed to him, and I know that I'm not ready to make a big commitment, but... the thought of a future he isn't in, where he's just gone... [Sighs] I'm not ready for that, either.",
        "Brooke: How did Wyatt react?",
        "Hope: He was freaked out just like I was, but...he said all the right things.",
        "Brooke: If the test came back positive, what would you have done?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] I don't know. I mean, it wouldn't really fit the way Wyatt and I are together. You know, I think that we'd have to change.",
        "Brooke: You two do enjoy being together.",
        "Hope: Yeah. We have adventures. We have fun. He loves to surprise me.",
        "Brooke: Having a child is quite a large adventure.",
        "Hope: And I do want that, just not right now. [Sighing] Oh, God. Sometimes I wish that...",
        "Brooke: You wish what? That you'd met Wyatt first.",
        "Hope: You always seem to know me much better than I think you do. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Oh, Honey. You know, you just seem so happy and carefree right now with Wyatt. It's just this crazy, unpredictable love that you have with him, and you're enjoying yourself. You're having fun. And with -- with Liam, it's just so careful and cautious.",
        "Hope: But, you know, I think a lot of that was -- it was me. Because I was always so uptight about...life in general. And, you know, maybe if I hadn't been that way, he wouldn't have turned to... or maybe that wouldn't have made any difference at all. I don't know.",
        "Brooke: Liam has been very steadfast and loyal. But it's up to you, Sweetheart, to decide if it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: What are you even doing here, Liam? You don't work here. You have no friends here. You have no business here at all.",
        "Liam: I don't know. Why do you like breaking into my house?",
        "Quinn: Oh, because you're smug, you're entitled, you're a menace, you think you're better than everyone else. In fact, you represent everything that is wrong in this country.",
        "Liam: So, I'm -- I'm the reason for the drought, unemployment?",
        "Wyatt: Mom, could I have a word with Liam, please?",
        "Quinn: Oh, Honey, I am not leaving you alone with this clown.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, you are.",
        "Quinn: I won't be far.",
        "Liam: Oh, you never are.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Look, I'm not gonna apologize for my mother.",
        "Liam: No. Nor should you. That would be tacky. She does all your dirty work for you.",
        "Wyatt: Well, you get the parents you get, our father being exhibit \"A.\"",
        "Liam: You wanted a word with me.",
        "Wyatt: I just wanted to give my mom a break. You're free to go look for Hope and grovel. She didn't like being kidnapped.",
        "Liam: Well, she seemed to like the idea of being tied to you for life even less.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. That's not what she said.",
        "Liam: You know, you only hear what you want to hear.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm?",
        "Liam: That's your fatal flaw.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Liam: Really. You -- you think that the stories you tell yourself inside your head are the real world -- that I'm clown, that nobody could possibly love me. Well, guess what, Wyatt? Hope does. And you just scared her into remembering that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: No man talking to a woman he's attracted to can let on that any other woman in the world is attractive.",
        "Maya: Why not?",
        "Carter: 'Cause he comes off insensitive.",
        "Maya: If women were that silly, we'd be extinct.",
        "Carter: [Laughs] What if I told you that sometimes I pretend to work out at sky lounge just so I can watch Madison do yoga?",
        "Maya: You do?",
        "Carter: You see? See that -- see that feeling right there? No man of average intelligence would risk making a woman feel that way. It's -- it's like chivalry. Instead, he'll say, \"Madison's a pain, but she knows how to stand on her head.\"",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Carter: And that's all Oliver was doing in what you recorded -- chivalry.",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",

        "Wyatt: Look, Hope does have a sentimental attachment to you, and it's that she doesn't want to hurt you. But it would be better for you, in the long run, if she just cut you off. She's just...too soft-hearted for that.",
        "Liam: You know, all this time I thought you were only pushy.",
        "Wyatt: And what am I now? I'm like pushy-plus?",
        "Liam: No. You're scared.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] I'm not scared.",
        "Liam: I don't know why I didn't see this before, but everything you do is whistling in the dark. You -- you keep telling yourself that the bad thing -- it couldn't possibly happen, not to you, not today, but Hope doesn't want to lose me, Wyatt. If I had any doubts about that before, I certainly don't now. And she's about to find out what it takes not to lose me.",
        "Wyatt: You're like year-old gum that's stuck to her shoe. Okay? She's given up trying to scrape you off.",
        "Liam: Yeah, we'll see.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] What, are you -- you're gonna issue a list of demands again?",
        "Liam: No, no. Just one. But it's non-negotiable -- equal time.",
        "Wyatt: Seriously? Like I'm gonna share her?",
        "Liam: You think it's up to you? Listen, you took about as much as you could take, and it turned out to be too much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: [Muffled] Nothing happened. It was a false alarm like you said, but... the truth is it changed everything.",
        "Brooke: [Muffled] Meaning what, Sweetheart?",
        "Hope: Meaning that I have to do things differently, and I-I think that all three of us do. There are facts that I have to accept. There are feelings I have to accept, like -- like I love Wyatt.",
        "Brooke: So you really are in love with Wyatt?",
        "Hope: I don't even know the distinction anymore. Wyatt is -- is sexy and impulsive, in good and bad ways. You know, I've -- I've had some of the most romantic moments of my life with him. But... when we're together, there's also this element of fantasy, because we're always on some kind of adventure with each other. We're away from everything, away from everyone. So I have to ask myself, \"Is it real?\" Thinking that I was pregnant -- that was very real. And when I think about marriage and children... I think about Liam. And I know that that's how he thinks of me, too.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] So what are you prepared to do about this?",
        "Hope: I don't know. I don't know. But I'm not sure that Liam will put up with it much longer, and I don't think that I can ask him to.",
