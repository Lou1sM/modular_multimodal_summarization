    "Recap": [
        "Liam questions Wyatt about the wedding. He says he now has a father-in-law, enough said although Brooke showed up with Hope .well on the tablet but they did not change Deacon's mind. Liam tells Wyatt to stay on Nicole for information. He has a feeling that she has the hots for him. Maya tells Nicole that she is leaving the office and going home. They discuss once again about Maya telling Rick, and Maya says again the timing is not right and she will tell Rick when he proposes. Wyatt finds Nicole about that time and says he has a proposal for her. He says she can call it a proposal or proposition. How would she like to be one of the jewelry models? She can't believe it and wonders if he means just for him and Ivy. He says no, for the media, the whole thing. She is surprised that he does not have to check in with Rick or Maya. He says he does not want to get in the middle of her and her sister but he would like her to be part of his team. She can't wait to agree. He comments that he has some things at his house that he will need. She suggests right now is a good time. Deacon sits and massages Quinn's feet. She says it was quite a day. She doesn't think Wyatt has ever seen her so happy even though there was a serious hiccup in the day with Brooke showing up to oust the wicked witch. It must have been hard for Deacon to have to stand up for her. He says he knew exactly what he had to do with no coaching.",
        "Maya and Rick are kissing at home while he stands in front of Maya's portrait over the fireplace. Ivy and Liam come in and Ivy says Rick has a guest, now she does too. Liam gets nosy and asks what does the future hold. When Rick starts to talk office, Liam says he means for the two of them .any wedding bells in the future. Liam says maybe and with her at his side he will be CEO for a very long time. Deacon and Quinn play lovey dovey and says it feels good to be husband and wife. Rick says there is a lot of planning to do, it doesn't just fall in place. He says he knows he has been pushing his employees a little hard but Ivy might try that too. Maya supports him and she is the key to his success. A man in his position needs someone like Maya. She is like no one else. Nicole is impressed with Wyatt's digs and that he wakes every day as a Spencer. She says she would be hitting the waves every day. He tells her maybe someday she will. He steers the conversation to Maya and them living in Illinois. She says Maya left before she knew her well. She turns on music while asking him to make some margaritas. Quinn asks how she can maintain Deacon now. Before it was just keeping her frig stocked with his disgusting beer. He wonders how long she will put up with him. She says ask her in 10 or 20 years. He says more like 50. She is chained to him now. She can't imagine feeling this way ..marriage used to be avoid at all costs for her. As they lay in bed she says he wants to be with him forever. Nicole is bopping around with lots of energy and offers to pour the drinks. Wyatt says he really is a scotch guy; Rick is the margarita type .he and Maya. Wyatt suggests they share a secret .he will start first. He says growing up he was told his father was dead and that was the last time they talked about it. Then came Bill Spencer, the big family secret. He is sure she can relate to that. She is getting to know Maya more but he is sure there were gaps she is unsure of .a guy like Rick has to have secrets and she can tell him. That family has to have a closet full of secrets. He keeps saying she can tell him."

        "Liam: So, they're married. And no drama?",
        "Wyatt: Liam, it's my mother and Deacon Sharpe.",
        "Liam: Yeah, stupid question.",
        "Ivy: So what happened?",
        "Wyatt: So, Brooke showed up and brought Hope with her.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Wyatt: On the tablet. She -- she was in Italy.",
        "Liam: Oh. [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Yeah, a-and then?",
        "Wyatt: Well, Hope tried to convince Deacon to bail, but that didn't happen. And now I have a stepdad, and I -- could we just talk about something else, please?",
        "Liam: Well, that's fair. Uh...I do have news.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Liam: Turns out, you were right. Rick, Maya, and her little sister, they all know something. I overheard Maya and Nicole talking.",
        "Wyatt: I knew it.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, just tell him what you heard.",
        "Liam: Well, I-it has to do with Rick, I assume, something he either did or -- or is doing. And it seems serious, like it could bring down the company.",
        "Wyatt: Dude, we got to get to the bottom of this. This could be Ricky boy's ticket out of Forrester.",
        "Ivy: I was actually gonna take Liam home.",
        "Liam: Uh, Rick's not gonna like that, but, uh, maybe we can get something out of him.",
        "Wyatt: Well, we'll meet up after I have a little chat with Nicole. I'm telling you, dude, she knows something.",
        "Liam: Well, listen. You got to stay on that, because, uh, I kind of get the feeling she's hot for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I'm heading home.",
        "Nicole: Oh, meeting Rick?",
        "Maya: Always.",
        "Nicole: Well, he's crazy in love, so at least you've got that going.",
        "Maya: And that's enough, Nicole. Rick's evolved. He loves me for me.",
        "Nicole: Then tell him.",
        "Maya: This is personal. A-and it's not that I'm ashamed, it's just... the timing has to be right. I will tell Rick I'm a transgender woman if and when he proposes.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nicole: Oh, Wyatt. [Chuckles] Hi.",
        "Wyatt: Hi. Uh, you busy?",
        "Maya: I was just leaving. See you at home.",
        "Nicole: So... is there something I can do for you?",
        "Wyatt: Actually, there is. I got a proposal for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Mm.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] When did you do all of this?",
        "Deacon: What are you talking about? It's our honeymoon. I know it's not Hawaii, but --",
        "Quinn: So much better than Hawaii.",
        "Deacon: Hey, I got some champagne on ice if you want some.",
        "Quinn: I don't want any champagne. I don't need anything but...",
        "Deacon: Come on. Say it. [Chuckling] Say it.",
        "Quinn: I don't need anything but you.",
        "Deacon: Oh, enough talk, woman. Got to get my hands on you.",
        "Quinn: Mm.",
        "Quinn: Mm. Whew!",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Great day, huh?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Like no other in my lifetime.",
        "Deacon: Blushing bride.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Please.",
        "Deacon: Baby, you looked beautiful.",
        "Quinn: It was so nice of Wyatt to lend us his house.",
        "Deacon: Got to say, the kid really came through.",
        "Quinn: Almost like he supports us.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I wonder if he's out celebrating.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: You have a proposal?",
        "Wyatt: Proposition, proposal, whatever's...most incorrect.",
        "Nicole: Why don't you tell me more?",
        "Wyatt: Okay. The truth is, um, I've been thinking a lot about you.",
        "Nicole: You have?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. I was just wondering... how would you like to be one of our jewelry models?",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Rick: Oops. Caught in the act.",
        "Maya: I love the way you look at that picture.",
        "Rick: I love the woman in that picture.",
        "Maya: You do, don't you?",
        "Rick: For everything she is.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Hi.",
        "Rick: Hi. What's this?",
        "Ivy: Uh, \"this\" is my guest for the evening. You have one of those. Why can't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Some sparkling water?",
        "Quinn: Mmm.",
        "Deacon: You know, baby, I don't think I'm ever gonna forget today. That -- that exact minute that I saw you walk out of the bedroom with that beautiful dress on, I just -- I mean, even Wyatt couldn't take his eyes off you.",
        "Quinn: I don't think he's ever seen his mother so happy before.",
        "Deacon: Neither have I.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. [Sighs] Not that there wasn't a significant hiccup in the day.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs] At least I took care of it.",
        "Quinn: You certainly did.",
        "Deacon: I really wish Brooke hadn't done that.",
        "Quinn: Mm. It didn't help her cause.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, right? Did she think it was going to?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] A daughter begging her father not to marry the wicked witch. [Scoffs] [Sighs] That must've been really hard for you.",
        "Deacon: I think Hope will come around in time.",
        "Quinn: It meant a lot to me, the way you stood up for me.",
        "Deacon: Hey, I never had any doubts. I knew exactly what I wanted to do, and no one or nothing was gonna stop that wedding.",
        "Quinn: I think that it is now time for me... to reward my husband.",
        "Deacon: Mm.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] \"My husband.\"",
        "Deacon: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: I have a real, live husband.",
        "Deacon: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I want to make sure I heard you right, okay? So, lay this one on me again?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I want you to model the jewelry.",
        "Nicole: You mean, like, for you and Ivy, right? Like, you know, to make sure it looks good?",
        "Wyatt: No! No, I mean for the media -- print, the internet, all that. But if you're uncomfortable --",
        "Nicole: No, I'm comfortable. I mean, I'm very comfortable. This is unreal.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] So, you'll consider it, then?",
        "Nicole: Already done, considered, and finished.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] That's good. I guess this might work out after all.",
        "Nicole: You don't have to check with Rick or Maya?",
        "Wyatt: Nicole, I'm the head of the jewelry line, all right? Ivy and my mother are a part of my team, and I was just wondering if you wanted to be a part of my team, too.",
        "Nicole: Well, I'm there. But, um, Maya's a little... [Inhales sharply]",
        "Wyatt: A little what?",
        "Nicole: Unsure of my ability.",
        "Wyatt: Ah, the modeling thing. That must be a bit annoying.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, you have no idea. She acts like it's nuclear physics.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Well, look. I-I don't want to get in the middle of you and your sister.",
        "Nicole: Oh, no, no, no. We're good. We're good. We've been talking a lot lately, so...",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Not arguing?",
        "Nicole: Nuh-unh. We just, uh -- we have a lot of things to work out.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Nicole: So, when do we get started?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, uh, well, I-I have some stuff at my house, uh, if you want to come by after work, uh, we can look at some --",
        "Nicole: Well, how about now?",
        "Wyatt: Now?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, I mean, unless you're busy. I mean, then, it's fine, but --",
        "Wyatt: No, no! We could do it now.",
        "Nicole: Okay, cool! Then let's head out.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: So... there it is.",
        "Ivy: Yep, in all her glory.",
        "Rick: Isn't she beautiful?",
        "Liam: Well, it seems like you're on a roll, Rick. I mean, you got the girl. You got the estate, the quarterly figures.",
        "Rick: You've seen the recent numbers? Ah, of course you have.",
        "Ivy: No one faults you on the bottom line, Rick.",
        "Rick: It's the other stuff, though, like my bedside manner.",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah. Yeah, all of that could use a little tweaking.",
        "Maya: I have no complaints about Rick's bedside manner.",
        "Rick: Oh, thank you. We're living the dream up here.",
        "Liam: Yeah, we can see that.",
        "Rick: And why not?",
        "Maya: You certainly earned it.",
        "Rick: My father seems to think so. One of the best quarters this company's ever seen. Even he didn't anticipate that. So I think it's safe to say that he made the right choice? What do you think, Liam?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] So, what's in the future?",
        "Rick: I expect more of the same, another big quarter.",
        "Liam: No, that -- that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about you two. Any wedding bells on the horizon, or...?",
        "Rick: Let's put it this way. She's the key to everything. With Maya by my side... well, I plan on staying C.E.O. for a very long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Husband.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] How's it feel?",
        "Quinn: Almost like we've just been introduced. Hello, I'm Quinn. Hello, husband.",
        "Deacon: Hello, wife.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] Are you married?",
        "Deacon: You bet.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] So am I.",
        "Deacon: Mm, lucky guy.",
        "Quinn: Yes, he is.",
        "Deacon: Oh, yeah.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Do you feel the difference?",
        "Deacon: Hmm.",
        "Quinn: You don't, do you? You've felt this way for a long time.",
        "Deacon: Disappointed?",
        "Quinn: Flattered. My God.",
        "Deacon: Mm. Can't imagine being loved this way?",
        "Quinn: I can now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Well, things sure seem to be falling into place.",
        "Ivy: For both of you.",
        "Rick: Things just don't fall into place. There's a lot of planning that's involved.",
        "Liam: Planning?",
        "Rick: Yeah, you think I got lucky with the profits?",
        "Liam: Well, you certainly received a big bump from Ridge and Caroline's collection, right?",
        "Rick: Well, that bump came from the pricing of the collection.",
        "Maya: Which everyone thought was a huge mistake.",
        "Liam: So, all that profit just came from one collection.",
        "Maya: No. Ivy's jewelry line helped.",
        "Rick: Yeah, you really should give your lady some credit. I know I've been pushing her a little bit too hard, but that's how I get the best out of my employees. Perhaps you should try it. It might make your daddy happy.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: Hey, I'm just -- I'm just curious. You seem to credit a lot of the success to Maya.",
        "Rick: The face of Forrester? Would you look at her? Could God possibly create a more beautiful woman than this one?",
        "Ivy: Uh, Rick, I think you're embarrassing her.",
        "Rick: Embarrassing her? That would be a first. Are you embarrassed, baby?",
        "Maya: Of course not.",
        "Rick: You ask me why Maya's the key to my success. Well, to put it simply, she's willing to do what nobody else in this organization has done -- support me. If half of my employees had half the integrity that she has, well, then, our profits would be that much higher. A man in my position needs someone like Maya. She's like no one else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: People actually live like this.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Well, this guy does.",
        "Nicole: I am definitely not in Illinois anymore.",
        "Wyatt: That's right. You're from the Midwest.",
        "Nicole: Born and raised.",
        "Wyatt: Just like your sister.",
        "Nicole: Well, she left way before I did.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, right. Yeah, you mentioned that.",
        "Nicole: I bet you wake up every morning thanking God that you're a Spencer.",
        "Wyatt: It has its advantages.",
        "Nicole: That is so rich-people talk.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] What?",
        "Nicole: If I lived here, I would be out on those waves every morning when the sun came up.",
        "Wyatt: Doing what?",
        "Nicole: Playing in the waves.",
        "Wyatt: Ah, all right. Well, maybe someday, you'll buy a place like this.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, if I hit the lottery.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Well, I mean, that's kind of what happened to me. I just woke up one morning and found out I was a Spencer.",
        "Nicole: That is so unreal.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. That's kind of what happened for Maya, right? One day, she's working at a coffeehouse, and then Rick shows up. And suddenly, she's woman of the year.",
        "Nicole: I know -- let's party.",
        "Wyatt: Oh.",
        "Nicole: Pull out some music, some margaritas --",
        "Wyatt: Margaritas?",
        "Nicole: Yeah. Let's see what kind of music you have on this phone.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, I mean, I-I --",
        "Nicole: Oh, no.",
        "Wyatt: I have some -- what?",
        "Nicole: No. This is so embarrassing.",
        "Wyatt: Embarrassing?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, so, here's what's gonna happen. I'm going to supply the music, and you are gonna make the margaritas.",
        "Wyatt: I have good music on here!",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Electronic dance music plays]",
        "Nicole: Ah. There. We can finally breathe.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I thought we were gonna get some work done here.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That, too. But first, you know, you got to move, get those creative juices flowing, you know?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, I mean...",
        "Nicole: Oh, you're not into it?",
        "Wyatt: Hey, my job was to go make margaritas, remember? That's my job, so I'm gonna go do my job.",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Guess it's official.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] No backing out now.",
        "Quinn: You trying to scare me?",
        "Deacon: No, I think I'm just trying to warn you.",
        "Quinn: Warn me about what?",
        "Deacon: Oh, a guy like me, uh -- I can be high-maintenance.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Okay, well, to maintain you before, I just had to keep my refrigerator stocked with your disgusting beer.",
        "Deacon: Those days are gone.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. So how do I maintain you now?",
        "Deacon: I would say that this is a pretty good start.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckling] No. No, no, no, no, no. This is you maintaining me.",
        "Deacon: Baby, it's not a chore, believe me.",
        "Quinn: Is there anything about me that's a chore?",
        "Deacon: I don't know. Ask me in a year or two.",
        "Quinn: A year or two?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, or 5 or 10.",
        "Quinn: Ooh. You're in it for the long haul, aren't you?",
        "Deacon: Till death, as they say.",
        "Quinn: Some would say that'll happen sooner rather than later.",
        "Deacon: Oh, my knees are shaking.",
        "Quinn: [Giggles]",
        "Deacon: I think the real question is how long are you gonna put up with me? Mm. Mm.",
        "Quinn: Ask me in a few years, or 10 or 20.",
        "Deacon: How about 50? Because I plan on growing ancient with you.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no. There's no way I'm slogging through my 80s.",
        "Deacon: Hey, don't say that, all right? I got one demand in this marriage, and that's that you outlive me.",
        "Quinn: I don't think the world wants to see that.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Okay. So we'll exit together.",
        "Quinn: Aww, you do have a morbid side. That's so sexy.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] Hey, I want to spend every moment of my life with you, woman. I mean, that's what the whole handfasting thing was about.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm, because you are tied to me now.",
        "Deacon: Or chained, if you prefer that.",
        "Quinn: Yes, I do.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I never imagined it would feel this way. You know, marriage to me always...seemed like something to be avoided at all costs, you know, for me. I mean, it's... it was so constraining. It's like admitting you -- you couldn't go it alone, that you needed someone. But now I know it's not about need. It's about want. I want to be with you, Deacon... forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Maya, you seem preoccupied.",
        "Maya: Hmm? Oh, no. I'm all right.",
        "Rick: You sure? You are a little quiet.",
        "Maya: No, I'm just wondering where Nicole is. I thought she'd be home by now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dance music playing]",
        "[Blender whirring]",
        "Nicole: Thing I love about this music?",
        "Wyatt: Huh?",
        "Nicole: It never ends.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Like your energy level.",
        "Nicole: May I?",
        "Wyatt: Sure. Yeah. By all means.",
        "Nicole: Hmm. Let's see, here. Hmm. That's good. Mmm.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Nicole: I took you for more of a martini man, though.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on. I'm a scotch man. Scotch.",
        "Nicole: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: Rick is a martini man.",
        "Nicole: Oh, is he ever. Him and Maya have one every night.",
        "Wyatt: Then what?",
        "Nicole: They stare at her picture above the mantle.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] Oh, my. That sounds exciting.",
        "Nicole: Oh, to them, it seems to be.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. The perfect couple.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] Well, I wouldn't go that far.",
        "Wyatt: Why not? They seem happy. They're in love.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, there's that.",
        "Wyatt: That's everything, isn't it?",
        "Nicole: What about you?",
        "Wyatt: What about me? I'm an open book. I got no secrets.",
        "Nicole: Mm, really?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Okay, I have one, maybe... two, three...",
        "Nicole: Oh, well, then, tell me.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] No. I'm not telling you -- you tell me one of yours, I'll tell you one of mine.",
        "Nicole: Okay!",
        "Wyatt: Okay!",
        "Nicole: But you go first.",
        "Wyatt: What?!",
        "Nicole: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Why do I have to go first? Fine. When I was growing up...",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm?",
        "Wyatt: ...Um, it was just my mother and me. Uh, the Fullers. One day, I asked her about my dad, and she said that he was dead. And that's the last we ever talked about it.",
        "Nicole: Wait a minute. You thought your dad was dead?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: Wow.",
        "Wyatt: I didn't know I was Bill Spencer's son until a couple years ago. And it's complicated. I-I... I know my mother had her reasons for keeping it from me all my life, but... that's it. That's the big Spencer family secret. I'm sure you can relate to that.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] Maya and I haven't always been close.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but you said you guys were starting to get along, right, getting to know each other better?",
        "Nicole: Now, yeah. But, um... she wasn't always like this.",
        "Wyatt: Like what? Like how she is with Rick?",
        "Nicole: Let's just say that, um... you know what? Never mind.",
        "Wyatt: What, because of Rick. I mean, 'cause a guy like that has got to have secrets.",
        "Nicole: I don't know. Maybe.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on! You can tell me one of the secrets, or three. How about three secrets? You can tell me three secrets. Well, a big, powerful family like that? They got to have a closet full of secrets. Rick and Maya? There's something going on there. I'm telling you, it's major, isn't it? You can tell me."
