        "Forrester's is going to welcome Liam back. Ridge tells all not to quiz Liam too harshly; he has a lot to catch up on. He asks Steffy how she feels now that she knows Quinn manipulated the situation with Liam. Rick asks his dad if he heard about this doctor that died. A friend told him that Ridge was seen with this doctor at a restaurant yet Ridge denied it. Something is up. He is taking these long lunches and not fulfilling his duties as CEO. Rick says he should be running the ship and he will again. Someday Ridge is going to do something so bad that even Eric cannot forgive him. Caroline pulls Ridge aside and says Rick keeps staring at him, wonder what is up. Ridge replies that Rick will always have his eye on Ridge, even where he has his lunch. She says maybe but what if he looks into it and figures out Ridge's medical history. It is all over the internet about the doctor's death. Maybe they will find out he was Ridge's doctor. He says they are fine, their secret is safe. Bill thanks Ridge for doing this for Liam. He will need all the support they can give. Wyatt pulls Steffy aside and says he knows this is hard for her but they will all be there for Liam and help her get through this so it won't ruin her life or marriage. Liam will have to accept that she is his wife now and just move on. Katie pops in on Brooke at the office. Brooke says she assumes she is there for the party. Katie says yes but she wanted to see Brooke first. She wants to apologize for the other day. She over-reacted and that is not fair and she cannot blame all her problems on Brooke. Liam walks in and is surprised. Bill hugs him first and says he cleaned up good. They are all here today, the Forresters and the Spencers. That is how much he means to all of them. Liam glares at Wyatt but thanks them. He says he is glad to be back. His MRI came out fine and little by little his memory is coming back. Eric assures him when Quinn is found charges will be filed. Wyatt agrees, this was crazy off the wall. Pam and Caroline say Quinn did come to the office, in all these bright colors, it was weird. It was like she was a whole different person. Liam says perhaps she had her own metamorphosis but doesn't change things that she is this sick, deranged person always manipulating everyone. He is back and better now. He looks right at Wyatt and states that he is going to get his life back. Bill publicly thanks Ridge and says this will honor Liam and it means a lot to Bill too. They have all been good to Liam and made him feel at home and he knows they are all grateful to have him back. He hugs Liam and says he loves him and is proud to call him son. He states that if Liam can survive Quinn then he can survive anything. Wyatt says he would like to say a word. He is sorry for what Quinn did to him. It was criminal and uncalled for. But like Bill said he is strong and he will survive this. And all of them will stand behind him and help him pick up those pieces and move on. Liam glares at him more.",
        "Brooke tells Katie that she never meant to disrespect her and she does not have to keep apologizing. She will always be there for her and nothing will ever happen between her and Bill. Katie tells Bill that Brooke says she does not need to apologize anymore and that she can sympathize. Bill says he is glad and now he just hopes his boys can do the same. Rick whines to his dad that Ridge hardly shows up at the office anymore and he'd like to be back as CEO. Ridge robbed him of the Forrester mansion just as he did the office. Eric says this is not the time or place to discuss it. Rick wants to speak with Katie. Bill leaves and Rick asks Katie if she saw Ridge the other day at this restaurant as his friend said he saw him talking to the doctor that got killed but Ridge denied it. Katie says she did see the doctor but not Ridge. Bill tells Liam that he knows it does not seem fair and is hard to accept but there is nothing he can do about it now. He has to respect Wyatt's marriage to Steffy. Liam catches Steffy hugging Wyatt. He gives Wyatt the stink eye and says they need to talk. Wyatt tells Liam that he looks good and he is glad he is better. They were all worried about him. Liam is silent, Finally Wyatt says okay, he gets it, get his dig in, he knows he is pissed. He tells Liam that he knows it is a shock that he came home and now he and Steffy are married. He probably wants to kill him but there is nothing they can do about it now, it is done. She loves him and he loves her and they are all going to have a find a way to move forward. Liam asks if this is his way of telling him to give up on Steffy. Wyatt says he does not want to fight with him about this. Liam says he does not either. Wyatt says he saw the way that Liam was looking at Steffy in the other room and all he is asking for is a little respect that she is Wyatt's wife now. Liam lays into him that the only reason he got Steffy in the first place was because Quinn manipulated it to keep him locked in the cabin and away from all of them. But he is home now and he is ready to take back what is his!"

        "Ridge: Let's hope so.",
        "Caroline: Hey. Did you see the news? 'Cause it was all over the internet.",
        "Ridge: Caroline, it was an accident. We had nothing to do with that man's death.",
        "Caroline: But what if somebody finds out that he was your doctor?",
        "Ridge: They won't. There's no way anyone's gonna find out our secret.",

        "Maya: Ahh.",

        "Thomas: Where's the little man?",
        "Caroline: Ah. He is in the photo studio, being doted on by models.",

        "Pam: Right? I never thought I'd be so eager to see him again. That guy has really been through the wringer.",

        "Pam: Yes, you did, my handsome detective.",
        "Charlie: Stop.",

        "Charlie: Oh, come on. It was all part of the job, you know?",
        "Pam: That was you. Oh, Bill! You're probably here for Liam's party. I'm just going in now. You can come in with us.",

        "Bill: Actually just texted me. He's on his way up. Thank you for doing this.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. It won't make up for what Quinn did to him, but at least he knows he has people thinking about him.",
        "Bill: He needs a support system right now, everyone coming together.",
        "Caroline: Is there any word on Quinn?",

        "Katie: Yeah. Yeah, I am. But I wanted to talk to you first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: So Quinn takes Liam, she kidnaps him, keeps him in a cabin somewhere, all this time. Why would she do that?",
        "Bill: Because she's out of her freakin' mind, Eric. As far as she's concerned, she was doing it for Wyatt -- so he could marry Steffy.",
        "Ridge: Hi.",
        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Ridge: How you doing?",
        "Steffy: I'm okay.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'd like to hear you out and listen to what you have to say, but now is not a good time. Everybody's gathered in Ridge's office, and I have to meet with a supplier.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry.",
        "Brooke: It's okay. We'll catch up later.",
        "Katie: No, no, I mean I'm sorry for...the other day. The way I treated you. I overreacted, and I wasn't fair, and...I can't blame all my problems on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Thanks, guys. I -- I, um... it's great to see you all. Uh, really, and you didn't have to do this.",
        "Maya: We were all so worried about you, Liam. Really.",
        "Charlie: So, uh, how's the old noggin?",
        "Liam: Better, yeah. Uh, not 100%, but the MRI's clear, and, uh, I'm... I'm remembering more and more.",
        "Zende: Two concussions back to back? I mean, no memory at all?",
        "Liam: Yeah, it's -- I know, it's -- it's, uh, crazy to me, too. But, uh... I didn't know who I was. I was living a made-up life.",
        "Pam: That Quinn, she really is some kind of monster.",
        "Charlie: Oh, she'll pay. The law will find her.",
        "Eric: He's right, Wyatt. Your mother will be found, and when she is, charges will be filed.",
        "Wyatt: Absolutely. I agree. I mean, this -- this was insane. Off-the-charts crazy.",
        "Zende: That entire time she had you, she kept coming into the office.",
        "Caroline: And she was acting all happy and wearing bright colors...",
        "Thomas: You know, it's like she became an entirely different person.",
        "Liam: I mean, I don't know. I -- I, uh -- I guess -- I guess she went through her own kind of metamorphosis thing, too. But at the end of the day, it's Quinn, you know? Deranged, sick Quinn trying to manipulate everyone. But I -- I'm back, and I'm better, and, uh... I'm gonna get my life back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I want to thank Ridge for putting this gathering together in honor of my son. Means a lot to him, and it means a lot to me. All of you have been good to Liam, made him feel at home here. We're grateful to have you back. And if you can survive Quinn, you can survive anything. I love you, Liam. Proud to call you my son.",
        "Liam: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, I'd like to say something, too, actually. I-I am so sorry about what my mother did to you. It was criminal and totally inexcusable, and I wish you never had to go through it. But what dad said was right. You're strong. You're a survivor. And all of us, we're gonna help you pick up those pieces... and move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I want the best for you, Katie. I never meant to offend you. I never meant to make you feel disrespected.",
        "Katie: I know, and I apologize for my behavior. I lost control of myself.",
        "Brooke: I'm here for you, whatever you need. I will always take care of you.",
        "Brooke: I'm seeing my therapist, and we're trying to work through everything, and... I realize that I'm... a little depressed. And it makes me feel inadequate and insecure.",
        "Brooke: You don't have to feel insecure. Nothing will ever happen between Bill and me, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I can't believe you thought I'd choose to miss out on Douglas' birth.",
        "Caroline: I know. I mean, it seemed very unlike you, but wait till you meet him. He is amazing, and he already has that Spencer charm.",
        "Thomas: Oh, please, come on. That boy is all Forrester. Takes after his big brother.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? Have you felt the grip on that kid? Clearly, he takes after his uncle.",
        "Caroline: You see what you've been missing?",
        "Liam: Uh-huh.",
        "Eric: So, how is it, living at your mother's place?",
        "Maya: Well, Brooke has been very welcoming.",
        "Eric: I'm sure she loves the company.",
        "Rick: Yeah, well, mom's been gracious, letting us crash there. But you know, dad, enough is enough. I want to move back to the Forrester estate, the home that Maya and I made. Only we can't because Ridge stole it from me, just like he took the company.",
        "Eric: This is not the time.",
        "Rick: Ridge has only been in the office three times in the past few weeks -- three times.",
        "Maya: And, of course, we understand that he just had a baby...",
        "Rick: Yes. But people are coming to me for guidance. Dad, I'm running international. Now I'm acting as if I'm C.E.O. because he's MIA.?",
        "Eric: All right, look, I get it -- you're frustrated, all right? He'll be back before you know it. He's enjoying being with his newborn son.",
        "Rick: You know, it's one thing to be an attentive father. But this is more than that. There's something else going on with Ridge.",
        "Ridge: So, um... I assume Liam knows about... you guys and the wedding?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. I, uh -- I told him last night.",
        "Ridge: How did that go?",
        "Steffy: He's not happy about it.",
        "Thomas: Gonna sneak by you right there.",
        "Bill: How you holding up, son?",
        "Liam: Oh, let's see. I wasn't gone that long, and she married my brother, so... you'd think they'd wait a minute, see if maybe I'd turn up.",
        "Bill: All right, Liam. I know it's hard to accept. It may not seem fair, but you have no choice. Listen to me. You have to respect their marriage.",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Ridge: You need something stronger than that? Maybe break in to my dad's bourbon collection.",
        "Steffy: I'm not quite there yet, but I'll let you know.",
        "Ridge: How are you? How's your head? It's just me. Talk to me.",
        "Steffy: I'm fine.",
        "Ridge: You are?",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: Liam's back. His disappearance, all those messages, was all a misunderstanding. It was Quinn manipulating the situation. So how do you feel about your marriage now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey, sugar, good to see you.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Zende: Hey, how are those?",
        "Caroline: Nicole just texted, and she's downstairs playing with Douglas.",
        "Maya: Aww, she's getting ready for her auntie duties once the baby's born.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: Dad, Ridge is always up to something.",
        "Eric: Come on, Rick. Don't talk about your brother that way.",
        "Rick: Did you happen to read about this doctor that got hit by the truck?",
        "Eric: What doctor? What does this have to do with Ridge?",
        "Rick: Well, a friend of mine saw him having a conversation the same day at Il Giardino.",
        "Eric: So?",
        "Rick: So I asked Ridge about it, and he denied being there.",
        "Eric: Well, then, obviously, your friend is wrong.",
        "Rick: Or Ridge is lying.",
        "Eric: What are you doing, Rick? You trying to imply that Ridge had something to do with this doctor being --",
        "Rick: What do you mean what am I doing? Ridge is mysterious like that. He's never where he's supposed to be or who he's supposed to be with. He takes these long lunches, and not fulfilling his duties as C.E.O.",
        "Eric: Look, Ridge is an artist.",
        "Rick: Dad, if he's such a great artist, maybe he shouldn't be C.E.O.",
        "Eric: Steffy's president. She's more than capable of pulling up the slack.",
        "Rick: With all due respect, Steffy's a little consumed with herself. Ridge just had a baby. Who's steering the ship here? It should be me. And it will be me. And someday, Ridge is gonna do something that even you can't forgive.",
        "Liam: I'm actually -- I'm gonna...",
        "Ridge: Welcome back, man.",
        "[Breathes deeply]",
        "Caroline: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Caroline: Uh...Rick keeps staring at you. What -- what did he talk to you about earlier?",
        "Ridge: He just asked if I went to Il Giardino.",
        "Caroline: The day when...?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: Why would he ask you that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Felt like you kind of needed to get away.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: Look... I know this is gonna be hard on you, with Liam coming back and having to tell him you're married and seeing him in that party. Look, and I know you feel bad about hurting him. Trust me -- I do, too. But we made a promise to each other that this wasn't gonna interfere in our life and our marriage, Steffy. Like... he's back now, and he's getting healthy, and we're all relieved about that, and we're all gonna help him get through it. But he's gonna have to move on, Steffy. He's got to accept that you're my wife now.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Liam: We need to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: You know, Charlie's the one who found the video of Liam and Quinn in the parking lot.",
        "Zende: You don't say. Wait. Why were you looking at the security footage?",
        "Charlie: Well, Rick asked me to find out who dinged his car.",
        "Rick: I still don't know who did that.",
        "Zende: It wasn't me.",
        "Rick: Mm.",
        "Thomas: Hey, come on. Don't look at me. I treat my car like I'd treat my baby.",
        "Pam: So you think maybe it was Ridge?",
        "Rick: I don't know. I wouldn't put anything past that guy.",
        "Ridge: [Clears throat]",
        "Caroline: Rick must be suspicious of something.",
        "Ridge: He always is when it comes to me.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, but why would he ask you about the restaurant? I mean, that doesn't make any sense.",
        "Ridge: Yes, it does. He's probably keeping tabs on me. He wants to weasel his way back into this office.",
        "Caroline: But that specific restaurant on that specific day?",
        "Ridge: He's just being nosy.",
        "Caroline: But what if it's more than that? What if he looks into things? What if he figures out your medical history?",
        "Ridge: Hey, hey. We're fine. Our secret is safe.",
        "Thomas: [Laughing] That's terrible.",
        "Ridge: Excuse me.",
        "Katie: So, Brooke said that I didn't need to apologize and that... she could sympathize.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm really glad the two of you are working things out.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Bill: I hope my boys can do the same.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Hey.",
        "Rick: Hey, aunt Katie, can I ask you a question?",
        "Katie: Uh, sure.",
        "Bill: Excuse me. I'm gonna get something to drink.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Rick: Were you at Il Giardino the other day?",
        "Katie: Um, yeah. Why?",
        "Rick: My friend saw you there, and he saw Ridge. Were you guys there together?",
        "Katie: No. [Chuckles] No, of course not. I mean, we were at different tables.",
        "Rick: Well, I asked Ridge about it, and he denied being there.",
        "Katie: Oh. I don't know why he would do that.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I don't know why he would do that, either. Did you happen to hear about that doctor that was killed by the truck?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Rick: Well, my friend saw Ridge talking to him at the restaurant.",
        "Katie: Ridge's doctor is dead?",
        "Rick: You knew him?",
        "Katie: Uh... uh, no, n-not really. I mean, I, um... I-I met him that day. I saw Ridge talking with him, and it... seemed kind of intense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Ridge: What are you doing out here?",
        "Steffy: Liam wanted a moment alone with Wyatt.",
        "Ridge: You never answered my question. Liam's here, so...",
        "Steffy: Does that change anything?",
        "Ridge: Steffy...",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: You're an incredible, capable young woman, and I would never suggest that you married someone that you're not in love with. But now that Liam is here, now that you know what happened to him... how do you feel?",
        "Steffy: I'm happy he's okay. I'm relieved.",
        "Ridge: I don't mean that. I-I mean, how do you feel... about him? You want him back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You look good, man. I'm glad you're starting to feel better. We were all worried about you, you know? [Sighs] Okay. I get it. Just stop staring at me and say it. You want to dig at me, go ahead. I know you're pissed.",
        "Liam: What makes you think that?",
        "Wyatt: Look, Liam, I know this is -- I know this has been a shock to you, coming home and finding out Steffy and I are married. I know you want to kill me. But guess what -- there is nothing that we can do about it now. It's done. She loves me, and I love her. And we're all gonna have to find a way to just move forward.",
        "Liam: Is this you telling me to back off? To give up on Steffy?",
        "Wyatt: I don't want to get into a fight with you right now.",
        "Liam: I don't want to get into a fight with you, either Wyatt. You're my brother. It's not fun for me.",
        "Wyatt: I saw the way you were looking at here in there. I'm just asking you for a little respect! That's all. Respect for the fact that she is my wife now.",
        "Liam: Your wife.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: [Breathes deeply] Wyatt, the only reason you got anywhere close to Steffy is because of your lunatic mother, because she held me captive and kept me from the world. That was the whole plan -- so you two could get together. Don't you understand? We were all manipulated by Quinn but nobody more than Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, what is that supposed to mean, huh?",
        "Liam: It means you were married under false pretenses. Steffy married you because she thought that I would never, ever, ever come home. Well, I'm home. And I'm here to take back what's mine."
