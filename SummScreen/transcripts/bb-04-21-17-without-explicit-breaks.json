        "Katie makes light that it sure is taking a long time for Quinn and Ridge to get some honey, maybe she should go help them. Eric talks her out of it. It's like a mystery novel and they should not split up and help the forces. Ridge agrees with Quinn that whatever they had is over and will not happen again. It's time to go back with the honey. Quinn says she still feels guilty. She still has her marriage and her life. Quinn explains their absence for so long as Ridge had a run-in with the jar of honey. She says all's well that ends well though. Katie tells Eric that his wife is keeping something from him. Quinn looks shocked until Katie pipes up and says Quinn offered her a job. Quinn explains that she has not talked it over with Eric yet but she wanted to think about it. As lovely as it would be to have Katie in the office every day she wanted to make sure the position was a good fit. Eric says they will discuss it soon. Right now he and Ridge need to get ready with more designs for their showing. Eric leaves and Katie says she knows this job is just an olive branch. Ridge says there is nothing between them. Brooke is the woman in his life and he is not giving up on her.",
        "Quinn says that she will tell Eric tonight so there is no reason to blackmail them. Ridge says no, there is no reason for anyone to tell Eric anything. Eric wants to settle down after all these years. And he wants to do the same. While Brooke is not answering his calls or texts he knows they can get their family back together and she is the only woman he wants. And Quinn wants Eric so that is the end of that. Brooke pours Bill his favorite Scotch and makes hors d'oeuvres with caviar for Bill and he feels like she is back home. Even after all has happened in Aspen and Du Bai and with her going to marry Ridge he always knew she would come back to him. She tells him to never doubt that, she will never leave him again. Enough of eating, he wants to get to the main course. He can tell by the look in her eyes she is ready too. She jokes that he can clean up while she goes and gets ready upstairs. He can count to 100 and then come up. When he does he is amused to find the bed strewn with money all over it. Then Brooke comes out of the bathroom with dollar bills pasted all over herself. He whinnies again as Brooke says she wants to spend the rest of her life as his wife. She opens a box and says she wants to see this ring back on her finger will he marry her? He answers he wants nothing more. He puts the ring on and says he loves her and will be honored to be her husband. They seal it with a kiss."

        "Katie: Yeah, I'm -- I'm starting to feel like we're characters in a horror movie.",
        "Eric: In a hor-- what? Why?",
        "Katie: People keep disappearing around us, never to be heard from again. I mean, first Quinn, now ridge. Do you think there's someone in the kitchen, just lurking, ready to pounce?",
        "Eric: \"Nightmare on willow hill road, part ii: Stephanie's revenge.\"",
        "Katie: [Laughing] Don't do that! I won't sleep tonight!",
        "Eric: I won't, either.",
        "Katie: Seriously, though, joking aside, it's taking them an awful long time to grab some honey. I should just go tell them it's not necessary.",
        "Eric: No, no, no, no. Don't do that. No. We can't split up. If we do that, then we'll be alone, and it's a sure sign that one of us will be the next victim.",
        "Katie: Oh. Right.",
        "Eric: Besides, I know how much you Logan girls like honey.",
        "Ridge: I'm with you. I agree with you. Whatever we had between us, whatever that was... that's -- that's done. My dad is happy. I haven't seen him this happy in a long time.",
        "Quinn: Good. Good. We understand each other. Well, poor Katie Logan has waited for her honey long enough. [Scoffs] I just wish you could have ended up happy, too.",
        "Ridge: I will be happy. Once I get Brooke back.",
        "Bill: Did I give you enough of a head start?",
        "Brooke: Bill! Close your eyes! I'm not done yet!",
        "Bill: Oh, you're so done.",
        "Brooke: [Laughing] No! No!",
        "Bill: You are so done.",
        "Brooke: Five minutes. That's all I need.",
        "Bill: I'm not giving you five minutes, I'm not giving you five seconds. We've waited long enough, and we're not waiting a moment more.",
        "Quinn: Still, I can't help but feel guilty. I still have my life. I still have my marriage. You and Brooke should be married, too.",
        "Ridge: We will be. It's just gonna -- it's just gonna take a little longer. You know, this is the toughest part right now, just giving her space and letting her think stuff through, but I -- I think we're gonna end up together. I have to believe that.",
        "Quinn: I'm gonna believe that, too.",
        "Brooke: Your favorite single-malt scotch.",
        "Bill: Thank you.",
        "Brooke: I just put dinner in the oven, so we're gonna start with appetizers. Care for some sushi?",
        "Bill: You made sushi?",
        "Brooke: Made. Ordered. Same difference.",
        "Bill: Don't mind if I do.",
        "Brooke: I hope you appreciate how rare it is.",
        "Bill: You mean raw?",
        "Brooke: No, I mean rare. The rarest in the world.",
        "Bill: Really?",
        "Brooke: With that bite, that species of fish is going to be extinct. [Gasps] I hope you knew I was kidding.",
        "Bill: I knew you were kidding.",
        "Brooke: [Giggles]",
        "Bill: Caviar, as well?",
        "Brooke: Only the finest.",
        "Bill: I'll be the judge of that.",
        "Brooke: Yeah? Here you go.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. Mmm.",
        "Brooke: So... rich?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: Too rich?",
        "Bill: You can never be too rich.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Katie: Well, how are you gonna tell the future?",
        "Quinn: Hi.",
        "Eric: There you are!",
        "Katie: We were just about to send out search and rescue.",
        "Ridge: Quinn had trouble finding the honey, and then I ended up spilling some on myself.",
        "Quinn: Misadventures all around, but all's well that ends well.",
        "Eric: I'm glad it wasn't more complicated than that.",
        "Bill: What's that look?",
        "Brooke: Just feeling thankful, I guess. Thankful to be here. With you. Back together.",
        "Bill: I would have waited for you forever.",
        "Brooke: You know, I've had a lot of disappointments in my life. When I give my love and my trust, it's just yanked away. But not with you. You were there. You never gave up.",
        "Bill: Of course not. How could I?",
        "Brooke: I don't know, I guess I just get used to that feeling of being let down.",
        "Bill: Not by me. Everything we've been through -- from aspen, the love that we share... to Dubai, the trust that we've created... there was never a possibility that I would give up on us. Even when you were going to marry ridge, and even when I'd accepted it, I knew that you would come back to me, that we would end up together.",
        "Brooke: You knew he'd let me down, and when he did, you were there for me. Just like you promised.",
        "Bill: That's because my promises mean something.",
        "Brooke: And now, here we are. Together again. And your necklace back where it belongs.",
        "Bill: Do you know what it meant to me, you putting this sword back around my neck, saying you love me?",
        "Brooke: I do. Don't you ever doubt that.",
        "Katie: All right. This looks delicious. Thank you very much. So, Quinn, are you gonna tell Eric, or am I?",
        "Eric: Tell me what?",
        "Katie: Oh, your wife has been keeping something from you. A job offer.",
        "Eric: Somebody offered Quinn a job?",
        "Katie: No, no, Quinn offered me a job at Forrester.",
        "Ridge: She did?",
        "Quinn: No, I -- I wasn't keeping it from any of you. I just haven't had the chance to discuss it with you yet. And, uh... and it wasn't really a job offer, I was -- I was just talking out loud.",
        "Eric: Well, I think you should talk out loud some more. I think it's a great idea.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Eric: Katie worked at the company before. You ran the company for a while, and very well! What exactly did you have in mind?",
        "Quinn: Well, that's why I haven't discussed it with you. As much fun as it would be to have Katie at the office every day, I just want to make sure we don't rush her into the wrong position. Wherever Katie lands needs to be a good fit.",
        "Eric: Agreed.",
        "Quinn: Mm.",
        "Eric: We should talk about this some more.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric: Let's reconvene at the office tomorrow. Meanwhile, you and I have to get back to it. Come on, ridge.",
        "Quinn: Wait! You're going back to the office tonight?",
        "Eric: Well, yes. As much as I would love to spend a lovely evening here with all of you, ridge and I have to come up with a whole new collection in record time. Katie, I'm glad I got to see you. If you start working at Forrester, I'll see you a lot more.",
        "Katie: Well, I hope that's the case, yes.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Don't stay out too late, okay?",
        "Eric: Okay. I'll do my best.",
        "Quinn: Mm.",
        "Eric: Come on, ridge.",
        "Ridge: Right behind you, dad. I'll see you at the office, okay? [Door opens] Explain. Now.",
        "Quinn: She's blackmailing me.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs] That is a lie. You're the one who brought up the job offer -- I suppose, to keep me quiet, but it doesn't make it blackmail.",
        "Ridge: And you're going along with it?",
        "Katie: Well, yeah. Why wouldn't I? I was C.E.O., The company did very well under me.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's what you want now? C.E.O. Position? Is that what you're looking for?",
        "Katie: How about marketing or P.R.? I mean, that's what I did before. I'm very good at it. I'm sure you'll think of something.",
        "Ridge: Why are you doing this?",
        "Katie: I've been wanting to go back to work.",
        "Ridge: There's a million places to work. Why Forrester? So you can keep an eye on us, hoping that we'll betray my dad?",
        "Katie: Why would I hope --",
        "Ridge: There's nothing going on here. There's nothing going on between us, and you know that.",
        "Bill: Thank you.",
        "Brooke: For dinner?",
        "Bill: For this. For being you.",
        "Brooke: You still hungry? I've got food.",
        "Bill: No! No, no, no! I'm not hungry. I can't wait any longer.",
        "Brooke: You're gonna have to.",
        "Bill: Unh-unh. No. I mean, if you're gonna say we're gonna do dishes, forget about it, no.",
        "Brooke: Yes! Excellent idea!",
        "Bill: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... unh-unh. I'm gonna get --",
        "Brooke: It'll give you something to do while I go upstairs.",
        "Bill: I've seen the way you've been looking at me. You're as ready as I am.",
        "Brooke: Yes, but I got to go upstairs and get ready, so you're gonna have to clean or count to 100, whichever you prefer.",
        "Bill: I'm not counting to 100!",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Bill: I'll count to 50.",
        "Brooke: Slowly. You promise? [Giggles]",
        "Bill: I promise.",
        "Brooke: Trust me. It'll be worth it.",
        "Bill: One...",
        "Brooke: Slowly!",
        "Bill: Two... ...three, four!",
        "Ridge: I have no interest in Quinn, and Quinn has no interest in me. Whatever this momentary lapse of reason was is behind us, it's in the past.",
        "Katie: Well, then what was the point of all this? What, just to satisfy your ego?",
        "Ridge: Some of it, probably, yeah.",
        "Katie: Some?",
        "Ridge: See, and that's why I don't want you in the office. 'Cause of that. Questioning us and threatening us.",
        "Katie: I'm not threatening you! How am I threatening you?",
        "Ridge: What are you doing? We used to care about each other. We were engaged. What is this? What are you doing?",
        "Katie: I still care about you, of course I do. I'm just accepting her olive branch. I mean, isn't that how you framed it, this job offer? I mean, anything else that you're imagining is just that. It's in your imagination.",
        "Quinn: Oh, no, no. He's not imagining the blackmail!",
        "Katie: This is not blackmail! You brought up the job offer. Not me! I mean, call it your insurance policy if you have to. You keep me happy, and I keep quiet about your dirty little secret.",
        "Quinn: I don't need an insurance policy! I will tell Eric tonight!",
        "Katie: Great! Do it. As soon as he walks through the door.",
        "Ridge: No, no, no one's telling anybody anything. You want a job at Forrester? Fine. We'll find you something. But before that, you're gonna have to accept there's nothing between us, nothing whatsoever.",
        "Katie: Then why are you not fighting for Brooke?",
        "Ridge: I am!",
        "Katie: Why aren't you with her right now?",
        "Ridge: Because she's not ready!",
        "Katie: So, what, so you're just gonna stand around and twiddle your thumbs and wait for her to change her mind? I mean, the ridge Forrester I know isn't super-patient, and the ridge Forrester I know doesn't ever not have a woman in his life.",
        "Ridge: Well, there is no woman in my life other than Brooke. She's the woman for me, and... I think she knows that I'm the man for her. And I know Spencer's sniffing around, he's trying to find a way back in there. I get it. But I'm not giving up on her.",
        "Bill: I counted to 50! I'm coming in! All right, I lied, I only counted to 40, but very slowly. Are you ready?",
        "Brooke: I'm ready! Open your eyes.",
        "Bill: [Laughing] What?! Wow.",
        "Brooke: What? You were expecting rose petals?",
        "Bill: My two favorite things combined into one hot, sexy package. Money... ...and you.",
        "Brooke: Ready to cash in, dollar bill?",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah.",
        "Katie: I really want to believe you. I don't want to see Eric get hurt.",
        "Quinn: We don't, either!",
        "Ridge: Could I have a moment with Katie?",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Of course. Good night, I will see you tomorrow at the office. Maybe both of you.",
        "Ridge: Why you doing this?",
        "Katie: I'm not doing anything. You're the one kissing your father's wife.",
        "Ridge: Kissed. Past tense. And I'm paying the price for that. I think you can see that. Now, with Brooke, we're supposed to be married, but we're not. Supposed to be settling down after all these years.",
        "Katie: You always do this. You always sabotage yourself.",
        "Ridge: I know. But I'm not giving up on her.",
        "Katie: Well, you might not having anything to say about that if she's already...",
        "Ridge: No, she's not. She can't. She can't. I know she's not answering my texts and my messages, but I know we can figure this out. We can put our family back together.",
        "Katie: And what about Quinn?",
        "Ridge: Not interested in Quinn. There's one woman in my life, and that's Brooke. And I'm gonna get her back.",
        "Brooke: Mm! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!",
        "Bill: [Laughing] What?",
        "Brooke: The gift!",
        "Bill: What gift? You're my gift! What -- where are you going? Where are you going? What is that?",
        "Brooke: See for yourself.",
        "Bill: [Laughs] He is beautiful. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: This is the life that I want. My stallion is his corral.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: You stood by me. You were loyal to me, and you were committed, and I want to spend the rest of my days rewarding you for that. What do you say, stallion?",
        "Bill: [Whinnies]",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Brooke: I really -- I really do mean it. I want to spend the rest of my life as your wife.",
        "Bill: Don't you mean my filly?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. That, too.",
        "Bill: Forever and a day.",
        "Brooke: Which reminds me... I'm hoping to see the ring back on my finger. Will you marry me?",
        "Bill: There's nothing I want more. I love you, Brooke Logan. And I would be honored to be your husband.",
        "Brooke: I love you, dollar bill Spencer.",
