        "Quinn listens at the door while Brooke and Hope discuss what just happened. She got scared of losing Liam in her life, but is she ready to move on with Wyatt. Quinn looks very concerned when Hope says she has no idea what she wants to do. Wyatt tells Liam those are fighting words. Nothing about an almost pregnancy changes things and Liam is only fooling himself if he thinks it does. Ollie kisses Aly several times by the pool. He calls the place ginorous and he is feeling pretty lucky himself thanks to Miss F. He takes her back to her room so they can be alone. She says they were alone in the pool, but he says her granddad could have come out .he meant really alone. He kisses her again. He says the more time he spends in her room, the more he likes it. And he is not talking about the decor; he believes in the message of HFTF too. They look at the underwater photo shoot and he says she looks fantastic. Liam comes out from seeing Wyatt and is amused that Pam is playing with a puppy \u0096 Joy. She has Joy say hello to Liam. He determines that she helps out at the animal shelter and he'd like to write a piece on it and will take her up on her offer for Liam to come by the shelter anytime. Pam says Hope will be at a photo shoot next. Hope continues but Rick bursts in to ask what is this he is hearing about her being kidnapped. She says she is fine and leaves him with Brooke who fills him in. He says he just saw Quinn around the corner and she did not look too happy. Quinn storms back to her office and tells Wyatt that he is losing Hope. That little stunt that Liam pulled by taking her to his place ..it's working. She just heard Hope talking to her mother. When he tells her that relationship is in the past now, she tells him do not dare become complacent ..not when anything that means anything to him could be slipping away. She says Hope is not as sure of their relationship as Wyatt seems to believe. All of this has stirred something up in Hope and it could upset her and their business arrangement with FC. Wyatt scoffs that she is over re- acting and holding their success in the company in the balance. She sternly warns him that she did not like Hope in the beginning but now she sees that she makes him happy and can give him something she never can. She does not want him to lose that. He says he isn't going to lose Hope. Quinn warns that he might feel differently if he heard what Hope told her mother about Liam. There is a long history there. He is Liam Spencer and Wyatt would be a Spencer too if he could. He says yes he supposes but why is she bringing it up now ..and what does it have to do with him and Hope. He warns her to jut let him handle this. He tries to convince her that if she involved and does her \"stuff\" that he really could lose Hope. He has faith in himself and Hope so Quinn should just chill.",
        "Rick asks Brooke about Ridge sightings. He doesn't want to turn his back too long without knowing where he is. She says she is keeping an eye on him. It's Katie she is worried about but she has the power to change it. She looks toward her purse and the papers. She tells him about meeting Karen but she still wouldn't re-instate Bill. But Brooke says she has proof that things aren't like what Karen and Katie think they are. It is undisputable but she is not sure she should use it as it might ruin her relationship with Katie forever. She took Katie's husband and Katie took hers but should she take her job too. Yet someone needs to stop her. It can't go on like this; it has to end. Liam finds Hope in the photo room. He grins that he keeps pretending that she is home packing to move in with him. She says they have already had that discussion. He isn't sure they finished before a certain someone interrupted them. She says yes a certain someone that he stole a pickup and trailer from. He days duly noted and next time she says there will be no next time. He said he did that because he had the scare of his life and had to do something. And that is the reason he is here now. They almost lost each other and they can not ignore that. She says she isn't. But she can not give him what he wants if it means walking away from Wyatt. He tells her she should before Wyatt and his mother .Hope won't hear any more. This has nothing to do with Quinn. He says okay then she needs to ask herself the question. Who does she want to spend the rest of her life with and have a family with. It's not Wyatt, it is him. Ollie finds a VHS tape in Aly's room as he is looking about. She says her mother made it for her on her 4th birthday to show how special she was. She's watched it a gazillion times. Ollie sympathizes that it must have been tough losing her mom so young. She says yes and the way she lost her was even rougher. Taylor was driving the car ..drinking and driving and never should have been behind the wheel that night. And she did not even get to go to the funeral as her dad couldn't tell her that she was gone. She never got to say goodbye. Maybe that is why she still talks to her now. Ollie doesn't think she is weird. They look through a photo album and she tells him that Taylor almost became her step-mother but thank God Thorne didn't marry her. She was four, Thorne was grieving and Taylor took advantage. Ollie holds her and says he can not take the place of her mother but she can talk to him about it or anything. He kisses her and she says no one makes her feel like a woman like he does. Hope tells Liam that she gets why he is pressing her but right now he just needs to back off. He wants answers that she truly can not give him. He says then give him something else instead. He opines that he can not just sit on the sidelines and watch her and Wyatt. He wants to be part of her life again and he's not talking about friendly chance encounters. He means spending time with her alone and dating. He knows Wyatt is not going to step aside. And it kills him to say this but ..would she consider dating both of them. She is not sure he is serious. In anguish she says her mother did that by dating two brothers, Ridge and Thorne and that is not what she wants for her life. He laughs not for him either but if she can not give up Wyatt, then just give him equal time. Here's what he will do. He will make dinner tomorrow night at his place. He will open the wine and set two place settings. He will expect her there but if she doesn't come, then he has to move on. So tomorrow night is the beginning or the end but it is up to Hope."

        "Brooke: Maybe you should talk to Liam again.",
        "Hope: What do I tell him?",
        "Brooke: I don't know. I mean, you were almost pregnant with Wyatt's child, and that scared both of you -- the thought of not having a chance at a life with Liam. So, is that okay with you? You want to move forward with Wyatt, or is that going to haunt you forever, the fact that you almost lost Liam?",
        "Hope: Honestly, Mom, I have no idea.",

        "Wyatt: What's not to understand? I mean, you'll use any situation to reconnect with Hope.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, do you -- [Laughs] Do you have any idea what an eye-opener this has been for Hope? Do you?",
        "Wyatt: What I get is that Hope is your past, and nothing about an almost pregnancy changes that, and you're only fooling yourself if you think that it does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: You want to go back in?",

        "Aly: So, um, why did you want to come back to my room?",
        "Oliver: Why do you think? So we could be alone.",
        "Aly: We were alone at the pool.",
        "Oliver: Your granddad could've come home.",
        "Aly: Grandpa likes you. He wouldn't mind us hanging out together.",

        "Pam: Yeah, she's in a meeting with her mother. [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Who is this little fella?",
        "Pam: This is Joy! Joy, say hello to Liam. \"Hello, Liam!\" My friend Brandon just brought her by. She's up for adoption at the local animal shelter.",
        "Liam: Is this the shelter you volunteer at?",
        "Pam: Yeah. You know you can come with me any time.",
        "Liam: I think I would love to.",
        "Pam: What are you saying? What? You want to say hello to Liam? Would you like to hold her?",
        "Liam: Would I? Is the Pope Catholic? Give her here. Oh, hi, Joy! Hi, little -- you! You know, it's so funny. I've actually been doing a lot of research on animal issues lately for this feature I want to do. Oh, you're so cute! Oh, hi.",
        "Pam: That's so great that you're doing that. Hey, baby. You know, I could help you if you want. I've got contacts at the shelter.",
        "Liam: Really? 'Cause I may take you up on that.",
        "Pam: Do. We both really want to thank you for doing what you're doing for animals, Liam. Right, Joy? [Smooches, chuckles] By the way, after the meeting, Hope's going to the photo studio. Both Joy and I are on your side, buddy. Yes, angel. [Laughs] Oh, my little angel. Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: When Steffy found out she was pregnant, it felt like the end of Liam and me.",
        "Brooke: Until Steffy lost her baby and then you and Liam had another chance.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Rick: What's this I keep hearing about you being kidnapped?",
        "Hope: Hey. What? Oh, God, no, no, no. It was nothing, really. I'm fine. Seriously. Thank you for listening.",
        "Brooke: Of course, honey. Any time.",
        "Hope: Love you.",
        "Brooke: Love you.",
        "Rick: I just saw Quinn rounding the corner. She didn't look too happy what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You're losing her.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: I just heard Hope talking to her mother. That little stunt that Liam pulled, taking her to his place, reminding her of what they shared there? Well, it's working.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, come on! That relationship is in the past now.",
        "Quinn: Don't! Don't you dare become complacent, not when everything that means anything to you could be slipping away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Oh. Here you are.",
        "Liam: I keep, uh... pretending you're at home, packing, getting ready to move in with me.",
        "Hope: Oh, well, we've had that discussion.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Do you feel like we got to finish it? A certain somebody did interrupt.",
        "Hope: A certain somebody whose trailer and truck you stole.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Liam: I thought you liked spontaneity.",
        "Hope: Not that kind.",
        "Liam: Ah. Duly noted. Next time, I will, uh --",
        "Hope: \"Next time\"? No, no, no. No. There will not be a \"next time.\" Liam, what you did was --",
        "Liam: What I did, I did because I had the scare of my life. I had to do something about it. And can you blame me? I still do. Actually, that's why I'm here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Sweetheart, you heard your sister. She is fine.",
        "Rick: That's all you're gonna tell me?",
        "Brooke: That's all I can tell you.",
        "Ric: Meaning Hope has sworn you to secrecy.",
        "Brooke: Not exactly. Look, can we talk about something else?",
        "Rick: [Groans] Sure. Has there been any Ridge sightings lately?",
        "Brooke: Why?",
        "Rick: Well, ever since his attempted coup, I don't like to have my back turned for too long without knowing where he is.",
        "Brooke: He's not gonna try that again.",
        "Rick: He knows that you're keeping an eye on him.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yes, I am co-vice president.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] Yeah, he's still stewing about that.",
        "Brooke: So is Katie. She really does hate this working arrangement.",
        "Rick: So dad said. Did she really tell him that she didn't want you working with Ridge?",
        "Brooke: More like demanded it.",
        "Rick: That so isn't Katie, or wasn't Katie.",
        "Brooke: I'm more concerned about what she's trying to do to somebody else. And I have the power to change it. Do you promise me that you won't say anything to anybody if I tell you, not even Caroline?",
        "Rick: I promise, Mom. What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: The more time I spend in your bedroom, the more I like it.",
        "Aly: Even though it looks like a kid's room with all this Hope for the Future stuff?",
        "Oliver: I wasn't talking about the decor. Besides, what's a little Hope for the Future memorabilia between friends? I told you, I believe in the message.",
        "Aly: About a girl respecting herself, you mean. Her decisions about her body?",
        "Oliver: And a guy respecting her for it. Let's check out the underwater shoot. There you go. Let's look at that one. Hey. You have nothing to be self- conscious about. You look fantastic, Miss F.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hope's not as sure of your relationship as you might want to believe.",
        "Wyatt: She said that to Brooke?",
        "Quinn: Not -- not in those exact words. But her almost being pregnant and the stunt that Liam pulled, it definitely stirred something up in her, something that could upset everything, including our business relationship with Forrester.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, Mom, calm down about that.",
        "Quinn: I can't! Not when your happiness with Hope and our company's success hangs in the balance.",
        "Wyatt: Look, I think you're overreacting here, okay --",
        "Quinn: Listen to me. I didn't like Hope at first. But seeing what she's brought out in you, how you flourished here, she's given you something I never can. I don't want you to lose her.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not going to.",
        "Quinn: See if you feel that way after you hear what she said to her mother about her and Liam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hope, I almost lost you. We almost lost each other. You can't expect us to ignore that.",
        "Hope: I'm not ignoring that. But I also -- I can't give you what you want, especially if it means walking away from Wyatt.",
        "Liam: You should... walk away... before he and his mother --",
        "Hope: No, no, no, no. Liam, this has absolutely nothing to do with Quinn.",
        "Liam: You're right. It doesn't. It's about you. It's about your future. It's about who you really see yourself raising a family with, creating a life with. I think you and I both know the answer to that question is not Wyatt. It's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So, you were trying to make peace between Bill and Karen?",
        "Brooke: Spencer Publications is Bill's life. He's been miserable ever since he's been banished, and I just thought bringing Bill and Karen together...",
        "Rick: That she would forgive him, reinstate him, even though it was her idea to oust him in favor of Katie?",
        "Brooke: Karen and Katie joined forces in order to get what they both wanted.",
        "Rick: She remains loyal to Katie, and Bill's hands are tied.",
        "Brooke: Bill's hands are tied, not mine. I have the power to change what happened. Bring Bill back as C.E.O.",
        "Rick: Doesn't Karen have 50%? Katie has 1%. You just said Karen was sticking by Katie, so unless you've got some sort of trick up your sleeve.",
        "Brooke: I have proof that things aren't the way Karen and Katie believe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What's this?",
        "Aly: What's what?",
        "Oliver: You don't see many of VHS cassettes these days.",
        "Aly: Oh, um... my mom made that for me... on my 4th birthday. So I'd always know how special I was to her. I've, um, probably watched it like a gazillion times.",
        "Oliver: Must have been tough losing her so -- so young.",
        "Aly: It's, um... it's how I lost her that's even rougher.",
        "Oliver: That -- that accident, you mean?",
        "Aly: Taylor was drinking and driving. And she never should've been behind the wheel that night. My mom would still be alive today. You know, I... I wasn't at my mom's funeral. My dad didn't know how to tell me she was... that she was gone.",
        "Oliver: He was trying to protect you.",
        "Aly: I know, I know. But I... I never got to say goodbye, you know? Maybe that's why I still talk to her. Oh, my God. You must think I'm so weird. I'm sorry.",
        "Oliver: I don't think that at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: And you're not concerned about the history between Hope and Liam? Because there's a lot of it.",
        "Wyatt: That's pointing out the obvious, isn't it?",
        "Quinn: He's Liam Spencer.",
        "Wyatt: And I am who I am. So?",
        "Quinn: So, you would be a Spencer, too, if you could.",
        "Wyatt: Where is this coming from?",
        "Quinn: You would, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I suppose. But why are you bringing this up now? What does this have to do with Hope and me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I don't want to do this, Liam. I get why you're pressing me, but right now, I really -- I just need you to back off, okay?",
        "Liam: Okay, here's the thing. If I do that, if I back off... then I'm denying something we both know is true.",
        "Hope: I'm not denying that what happened made me really stop and think, but I -- I feel like you want these answers from me that I truly cannot give you.",
        "Liam: Then give me something else instead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: This proof that you have -- I gather that it's indisputable?",
        "Brooke: Yes. But the question is... do I use it?",
        "Rick: Because Katie's your sister, and if you do...",
        "Brooke: It could damage our relationship forever.",
        "Rick: You need to think long and hard about this. There're so many dynamics at play. You share a child with Ridge, a man whose commitment to you has been...inconsistent, at best. You contrast that with Bill -- he's cared about you in ways that he never has for Katie.",
        "Brooke: I've taken her husband, and she's taken mine. So, do I also take her position as C.E.O.? Somebody has to stop her. It can't go on like this. It has to end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Losing my mom was hard enough. But my dad got involved with...her.",
        "Oliver: You mean romantically?",
        "Aly: He could never love her the way he loved my mom. But that didn't stop her. She targeted my dad -- almost became my stepmom. I remember tearing up her wedding gown when I found out what happened. Thank God my dad didn't marry her, but...",
        "Oliver: Still made you feel angry and confused.",
        "Aly: I was 4. My mom was gone, and dad was grieving. And she was taking advantage. I actually ran away. Sometimes, I still have nightmares about it. If I could just... feel my arms around me one more time.",
        "Oliver: You can never replace your mom. You can talk to me about this -- about anything. I'm just happy to be here for you.",
        "Aly: You're really sweet. You know that?",
        "Oliver: You're really pretty.",
        "Aly: No one has ever really said that to me before. Made me...feel like a woman the way you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Let me handle my own life. I mean it, Mom. If you start getting involved and you start doing your stuff, I really could lose Hope, so chill, okay? I have faith in myself and in Hope.",
        "Quinn: What if it's not good enough?",
        "Wyatt: Stop worrying. It will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I can't do this anymore. I can't keep sitting on the sidelines, watching you and Wyatt. I want to be a part of your life again.",
        "Hope: You are a part of my life.",
        "Liam: I'm not talking about friendly chance encounters. I mean dating, spending time alone with you, having fun with you.",
        "Hope: I know, I know. But what about Wyatt? What, you just expect him to step aside?",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] I wish he would. But since I know that's not gonna happen... and it kills me to say this... would you consider dating us both?",
        "Hope: Are you serious? My mom did that -- my mom dated two brothers -- Ridge and Thorne, and that's -- that's not something that I want for my life.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Trust me -- I don't want it, either. But... if Wyatt is something that you can't give up... just give me equal time. I'll tell you what. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make dinner tomorrow night at my place. I'm gonna open a bottle of wine, I'm gonna set two plates. And I will plan for you to be there. And if you're not... then I got to move on, for good. This -- this pregnancy thing... it was a huge reality check for me, and I hope it was for you, too. So, tomorrow night can either be a new beginning for us... or it'll be the end. But it's up to you."
