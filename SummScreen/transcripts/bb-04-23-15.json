        "Maya questions Nicole about the night before. Nicole says it was a fun date and not at a club but there was good dancing and drinks. She and Wyatt got caught up in the moment and Wyatt could not be any cuter and he is a Spencer. Wyatt tells Liam that he was just as surprised as Liam is but he just got caught up so who could blame him. His marriage has been over for quite a while. Liam tells him they need to get Rick's secret so do not lose sight in that. Perhaps Rick is cooking the books. They looked in his office last night but found nothing incriminating. Rick tells Brooke that it is good to have her back in the office. Eric joins in and says he wanted to surprise them. So he needs to find out what's been going on. Brooke says Rick has been doing smashingly well so Eric is happy. Eric looks at the books and tells Rick he has done exceptionally well. He has filled his shoes very well. He is the son he always wanted him to be. Nicole gushes on about Wyatt but Maya tells her to be careful and do not say anything she will regret. Liam offers the company jet as Mr. President. He wants Wyatt to scoot Nicole out of town and show her the sights in San Francisco, anywhere to impress her. Wyatt thinks he is capable of doing this on his own but finally says, gas up the jet, he will do it.",
        "Wyatt calls Nicole and asks can she get away tonight. He will send a car for her and it's a secret where they are going. Maya is standing there telling Nicole to play a little hard to get but Nicole gushes that she is in. Wyatt tells Liam that tonight Rick's secret will be in his hands. Liam assures him the jet will be waiting and whatever they do will be ok. He knows it has been a long long long time since he has been with a girl to court or impress her but keep his game face on and the eye on the prize. Wyatt says he knows what to do. Wyatt arrives at the jet and tells the pilot to say in the cockpit, a lot is riding on this trip. Nicole comes aboard and can not believe this is real but she is cool with it. She was only expecting a movie. Wyatt says if all goes well the night could be full of surprises. Caroline calls and says she thought things would be better now that the divorce papers had gone thru but Rick is really pushing her now. She can not take this anymore. Liam retorts they are trying to get Rick out as CEO so hang in. Eric presents Rick with a gold watch with EF inscribed on it. Eric said it was given to him at some big award and Rick deserves it now. He is so proud of him. Brooke beams. Rick tells him he has no idea how much this means to him. Rick tells them that he is thinking of proposing to Maya ..not now and not babies yet but in the near future. She has never let him down and he does not want to lose her. Maya thinks over those words that Rick has told her about honesty and integrity. She gets her pills and takes one. Nicole can not believe that Wyatt's family owns a jet. She pours drinks and asks where he is taking her. He does not want to spoil the surprise. She says she told her sister about him. He says he imagines she played the big sister role. He says he does not take this for granted and this is brand new. He wants her to be able to tell him anything. Tonight no games, no guessing what each other is thinking, no secrets, just feel comfortable in telling each other whatever is on their minds. She repeats \u0096 no secrets."

        "Wyatt: Have you seen Nicole? She's gorgeous. She knows how to have fun. She knows what she wants. I don't know. I just kind of got caught up in it. Can you blame me? My marriage has been over for quite a while.",
        "Liam: I know. You could obviously use some female attention. I get that part.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and I -- you know, I kind of dig her. She's fun.",

        "Brooke: Eric! You didn't tell us you were coming home!",
        "Eric: I wanted to surprise you. Come here, son.",

        "Brooke: [Chuckles] And Bridget said she got a postcard from you from Machu Picchu.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Oh, my gosh. The beach house was amazing. Right on the sand, ocean in the backyard. To die for.",
        "Maya: Someone enjoyed herself.",
        "Nicole: And Wyatt? Could he be any cuter? [Chuckles] And he's a Spencer.",
        "Maya: Ah. The magic word.",
        "Nicole: Everything about yesterday was magic.",
        "Maya: How did this happen? You and Wyatt, huh? Did he make the first move?",
        "Nicole: Can I help it if we got caught up in the moment? I wouldn't mind getting caught up again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: We both heard Maya and Nicole say that this secret could rock Forrester Creations, so it's -- it's got to be something monumental.",
        "Liam: I agree, but what? I mean, I-I spent all morning researching Rick's history online.",
        "Wyatt: Did you find anything?",
        "Liam: Not much. I mean, we -- we know that he shot a gun before, so who knows what else he's capable of.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. He's a full-on megalomaniac.",
        "Liam: You know what Ivy and I think?",
        "Wyatt: Huh?",
        "Liam: He's cooking the books.",
        "Wyatt: Really? Interesting.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, while you were, uh [Chuckles] entertaining Nicole last night, Ivy and I searched his office. We didn't find anything, so we'll keep you posted on that. But in the meantime, you have to see Nicole again, and it should be alone.",
        "Wyatt: Can do. No problem.",
        "Liam: Preferably to talk.",
        "Wyatt: I know!",

        "Wyatt: How?",
        "Liam: Spencer jet.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: What you've done with this company so far as CEO is very impressive.",
        "Rick: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure you've been keeping abreast of the numbers.",
        "Eric: Yes, I'm well-versed. Profits are up in every market.",
        "Rick: I think it's safe to say Forrester's on a roll.",
        "Eric: Because of your hard work. All of it.",
        "Rick: It's definitely a team effort.",
        "Brooke: It all starts at the top with you. And you've managed to bring more respectability to our family.",
        "Eric: To the Forresters and the Logans -- two great legacies.",
        "Brooke: Your father and I both are more than satisfied with how you're handling everything.",
        "Eric: You fill these shoes pretty well and seamlessly.",
        "Rick: Eh, there's been a few bumps along the way.",
        "Brooke: Everybody has challenges. Everybody makes mistakes.",
        "Eric: The important thing is that you land on your feet. You keep your head up. Like I said, I'm very proud, son.",
        "Rick: I just want to be the son you always hoped I'd be.",
        "Eric: You are.",
        "Rick: I could be better. I want to learn from you. There's no greater teacher for a man than his father.",

        "Wyatt: The jet?",
        "Liam: Listen, I'm the president. I can authorize it.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, Mr. President. Well, I can go through dad. I don't need to go through you.",
        "Liam: Oh, sure. No, I totally understand. If it makes you feel less inferior, then I get it.",
        "Wyatt: I'm gonna punch you so hard right now. What? You don't think I can do this on my own? You think I need a jet to impress Nicole?",
        "Liam: Wyatt, contrary to popular belief, you can be charming when you want to be.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Liam: You're welcome. But don't forget -- one of the reasons that Maya's sister is hanging out with you is because of your last name.",
        "Wyatt: I am a good-looking guy.",
        "Liam: Are you a good-looking guy? I really hadn't noticed that.",
        "Wyatt: That's strike two.",
        "Liam: You are a Spencer, Wyatt. You are a Spencer, and let's not forget you told me that Nicole likes to party, right? She likes to have a good time?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, does she ever.",
        "Liam: Okay, so get her on the jet! I mean, take her to San Francisco for dinner.",
        "Wyatt: Ooh.",
        "Liam: You open a bottle of champagne at 40,000 feet, that's gonna get her talking.",
        "Wyatt: That's actually kind of badass.",
        "Liam: Right? That's what I'm saying.",
        "Wyatt: All right. Do it. Gas up the jet, Mr. President. Nicole and I are going on an adventure. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Relax. Wyatt is a total gentleman.",
        "Maya: You don't really know him.",
        "Nicole: I know all I need to know. He's sweet, sexy, Bill Spencer's son, and he owns a beach house. Not that bad.",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: Would you just let me enjoy this, Maya?",
        "Maya: You just...need to play your cards right.",
        "Nicole: Okay, what does that mean?",
        "Maya: Don't be so available.",
        "Nicole: So, play it cool, a little hard-to-get?",
        "Maya: Just put the brakes on.",
        "Nicole: I'm not looking for a big commitment. But it will only be a matter of time before Wyatt will want to see me again.",
        "Maya: I just...wouldn't get my hopes up, if I were you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Nicole: Hey, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, uh, I was wondering if you were free tonight.",
        "Nicole: Tonight? Uh...sure, I'll cancel my plans. Where do you want me and when?",
        "Wyatt: I'll send a car for you.",
        "Nicole: Ooh, a car. How debonair.",
        "Wyatt: Are you at the Forrester house?",
        "Nicole: I am. What's the plan?",
        "Wyatt: It's a little bit of a mystery.",
        "Nicole: Ooh. I love a little mystery. Okay. See you soon, Mr. Spencer. Did you hear that? Your little sister is going on an official date with Wyatt Spencer! Me! Can you believe it? Oh, my gosh! And in a limo! Oh, my gosh. I think I'm going to hyperventilate.",
        "Maya: Just...be careful. Don't do or say anything you'll regret.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Liam: [Chuckles] What you've got is a job to do.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Think this will work?",
        "Maya: Uh, did you bring a sweater?",
        "Nicole: No, mom. Worried I'll get cold?",
        "Maya: I'm worried about a little more than that.",
        "Nicole: Don't be. This is fun. I'm about to get wined and dined, so chill. Got anything from that Brooke's Bedroom lying around here?",
        "Maya: Why?",
        "Nicole: Might need it later. You never know.",
        "Maya: Seriously, Nicole?",
        "Nicole: Lighten up, Maya. I'm just playing with you. I'm a big girl. I can handle it.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Nicole: Oh! My car's outside. Got to go. I'll call you later.",
        "Maya: Okay. Have fun.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Thank you very much. You're all set. Jet's gonna be waiting for you.",

        "Liam: You don't have time to shave.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? This okay to wear?",
        "Liam: Wyatt, Wyatt, you're good. You're good, all right? I know this is like a big date night for you and all. And since the last time you had one, it's been a really, really, really, really, really, really, really --",
        "Wyatt: I got it! I'll keep my eye on the prize.",
        "Liam: Okay, all right. And let me just say I am in no way advocating or endorsing you and Nicole doing -- I'm just saying whatever you guys do is your business and your business alone.",
        "Wyatt: I can't help it if I like her, okay? And yes, I might not know her very well, but there's just something special about her. Kind of reminds me of a bit of myself.",
        "Liam: You know that's kind of sick, right?",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Liam: I'm just saying stay focused, keep your game face on, and find out what Rick and Maya are hiding.",

        "Brooke: What? Really? That's incredible.",
        "Eric: Your stewardship of Forrester has been stunning.",
        "Rick: It means a lot that I've earned your respect.",
        "Eric: But brand image and integrity are imperative. They're even more vital now than they ever have been before in our business. I want you to make that a new priority. Now, in appreciation for everything you've done for this company and for this family, I want you to have this. It was given to me in Italy after I received the lifetime achievement award.",
        "Rick: I remember. It's beautiful, Dad. I-I really don't know what to say.",
        "Eric: You've done an incredible job for this company. I'm proud of you. [Chuckles] Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Wow. Flowers look nice, caviar and champagne, tequila for the margaritas.",
        "Michael: Catering provided everything you asked for.",
        "Wyatt: Nice. Thanks, Michael.",
        "Michael: I'm guessing this isn't a business trip.",
        "Wyatt: No, it is. Sort of in a way. It's probably best if you stay in the cockpit. It's -- there's a lot riding on this evening.",
        "Michael: Not a problem, sir.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks. Ooh. [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Wyatt: There you are.",
        "Nicole: Is this for real?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Welcome aboard Air Spencer.",
        "Nicole: So, wait. Are we -- are we actually flying somewhere?",
        "Wyatt: Well, if you're cool with it.",
        "Nicole: Of course I'm cool with it! Are you kidding me?! A private jet? I've only seen one of these in movies. Seriously, Wyatt, this is the best surprise I've ever had.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Well, if all goes well... tonight will be full of surprises.",

        "Caroline: Ugh! If I have to deal with one more of these \"additional note\" messages, I'm gonna...",
        "Liam: Oh, no. Rick. What's he saying now?",
        "Caroline: Oh, he's saying, he's writing, he's texting, he's smoke-signaling, he's carrier-pigeoning. He's making me insane. It's incessant! And none of the notes make any sense, by the way. I'm doing more work and revisions here than I've ever done in L.A. and I feel like it's just all for his amusement.",
        "Liam: I thought things had been better between you two since the divorce papers went through.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I did, too, believe me. Um, and he says that he is just pushing me to be my best, but it feels like he's just... pushing me.",
        "Liam: Hang in there. I got your back. Actually, um, I have a new lead that might, uh, part the skies a little bit, end Rick's reign of terror.",
        "Caroline: Good! Because I cannot take this anymore.",
        "Liam: Well, you sure are missed around here, cous.",
        "Caroline: Aww. You miss me? That's cute. [Chuckles] I miss you, too. I'm just spending time with my mamas.",
        "Liam: Okay, but I thought things were pretty hot and heavy between you and Ridge.",
        "Caroline: They are.",
        "Liam: Why are you away?",

        "Rick: You have no idea how much this means to me.",
        "Eric: I'm glad you like it.",
        "Rick: I'll cherish it, Dad. I'll have it forever.",
        "Eric: Pass it on to your son one day.",
        "Rick: Hopefully that's not too far off.",
        "Eric: You and Maya that serious?",
        "Rick: Well, we're not talking babies yet.",
        "Brooke: But you plan on spending your life with her?",
        "Rick: I'm thinking of proposing. I mean, not now, but in the near future.",
        "Brooke: You're technically still married to Caroline.",
        "Rick: Yeah, but there's no laws against proposal.",
        "Eric: That's true. But you're still in the middle of a divorce.",
        "Brooke: There's no harm in waiting, honey.",
        "Rick: Maya's wondering about our future. I can't say that I blame her. She's been through so much. She's always been there for me and never let me down. I just don't want to risk losing her.",

        "[Maya's flashbacks]",
        "Rick: You have nothing to be ashamed of. You've been honest and up front. You've been a woman of integrity.",

        "[Present time]",
        "Nicole: I can't believe your family owns a private jet.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: I've never even flown first class before.",
        "Wyatt: It's kind of crazy, right?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, well, when you said tonight was gonna be a mystery, you weren't kidding.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. I was just glad that you were into it.",
        "Nicole: Well, where are you taking me?",
        "Wyatt: It's a secret.",
        "Nicole: Oh, a secret, huh?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah!",
        "Nicole: Well, what do I have to do to get it out of you?",

        "Nicole: Okay. Wouldn't want to do that.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",

        "Wyatt: You did?",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm. Why not? I mean, we know everything about each other now.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I assume she played the older-sister role.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, she said you wouldn't call. But...you did.",
        "Wyatt: I just wanted to see you again.",
        "Nicole: Here I am.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I want to make a toast.",
        "Nicole: Go for it.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I just want you to know that I don't take any of this for granted.",
        "Nicole: Good to know.",
        "Wyatt: I know this is new, brand-new, but... I-I just want you to feel like you can share anything with me. 'Cause it's the only way to get close, see where this could lead. So, starting tonight, um, let's just -- let's be up front and honest. No games, no wondering what each other is thinking. [Chuckles] And no secrets.",
        "Nicole: Starting tonight.",
