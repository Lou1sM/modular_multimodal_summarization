        "Massimo: Bring a curse on this family. ",
        "Nick: You put my mother in jail. You're the curse. ",
        "Massimo: What kind of a man are you? Hmm? I wonder. You didn't see what she \r\ndid to me. While I was in my own personal hell. You were there. Groveling in \r\nfront of me with that pig! Deacon. And you talk to me -- look, I'm not doing \r\nthis to hurt you, son. I'm trying to get through to you. Don't you see how \r\nBrooke and Ridge are? They keep going back to each other, time and time again. \r\nShe's the mother of your brother's child. Dominick, let her go. Let her go, \r\nbefore it's too late. ",

        "Dante: My family wants to meet my son. ",
        "Felicia: I don't care if the prime minister wants to pay a visit. My son is \r\nnot going to Italy. ",
        "Dante: We'll cut the trip back to a week, okay? ",
        "Felicia: No. ",
        "Bridget: Felicia, it really might be a good opportunity for you to get some \r\nrest, and get some of your strength back. ",
        "Felicia: I am getting my strength from being with my son. ",
        "Bridget: Dino is a lot of -- ",
        "Felicia: Dominick! His name is Dominick! Look, it's cool that you want to \r\ntake him to Italy. Show the little guy the old country, I get it. It's just \r\ngonna have to wait. ",
        "Dante: Felicia, why? ",
        "Felicia: Because I don't know how much time I'm going to have with him. ",
        "Bridget: The cancer is in remission. Your body is accepting the new liver.\r\n",
        "Felicia: For how long, Bridget? Years? Weeks? Days? ",
        "Bridget: Felicia -- ",
        "Dante: My parents aren't getting any younger, you know? ",
        "Felicia: I am sure that they would love a nice, long vacation to Los Angeles, \r\nDante. ",
        "Bridget: Okay, wait -- Dante, you know the neck rests that we wanted to get \r\nfor the plane ride? Would you mind going to get those for us? The travel shop on \r\nsunset? ",
        "Dante: Sure. ",
        "Bridget: Felicia -- ",
        "Felicia: Good luck ever winning an argument against that guy. Bridget, take \r\nDominick to Italy after I die. But please don't take him away from me right now.\r\n",
        "***************************************************************",
        "Massimo: You can't fight what's between them. ",
        "Nick: What's between them is betrayal, suffering, disappointment. ",
        "Massimo: You see the way she behaves? From one man to the next? But she \r\nalways goes back to Ridge. ",
        "Nick: Well, not this time. ",
        "Massimo: Look, Dominick, I'm only trying to protect you. ",
        "Nick: Your strength is fading, like an old moon. And before long, it's going \r\nto disappear completely. ",
        "Massimo: You don't know what real power is. ",
        "Nick: Free my mother. ",
        "Massimo: Release her. ",
        "******************************************************",
        "Bridget: I do understand what we're asking, and I know that you'll miss Dino, \r\nbut we'll be back before you even realize we're gone. ",
        "Felicia: First of all, you're not asking me anything. You're telling me. And \r\nsecondly, a week will feel like a year without my son. ",
        "Bridget: Look, we both know how much you need Dominick, and we would never \r\nwant to deprive you of that -- of course not. But Dante is the father. And \r\nFelicia, he's a wonderful father. You should hear him on the phone talking about \r\nDominick with his family. He's like a kid at Christmas. He's so excited. He \r\nloves that little boy so much. We're just asking for a week. ",
        "Felicia: I'm sorry. ",
        "Bridget: Dante is Dino's father. If he needs to take Dino to Italy to meet \r\nhis family, that's exactly what he should do. ",
        "Felicia: You're not even going to give me a couple of days to think about it?\r\n",
        "Bridget: We're leaving tomorrow night. ",
        "*********************************************",
        "Jackie: Is it true? Am I being released? ",
        "Nick: You're coming home with me. ",
        "Jackie: Oh, I knew that you'd given your father an ultimatum, and that you \r\nwere determined to prove that I'd been framed, but I never thought you'd be able \r\nto do it. ",
        "Nick: It was Megan. She planted false information in your computer. ",
        "Jackie: Megan? ",
        "Nick: The FBI was just doing their job, Mom. ",
        "Jackie: Oh, he is an evil man for doing this to me. And he hasn't \r\naccomplished anything, because Ridge will never have Brooke. Never. ",
        "********************************************",
        "Brooke: What are you doing? ",
        "Ridge: Logan -- ",
        "Brooke: Ridge -- ",
        "Ridge: You need this. We need this. I love you so much. Our lives are going \r\nto fall into place again. Just let it happen. Let it happen. "
