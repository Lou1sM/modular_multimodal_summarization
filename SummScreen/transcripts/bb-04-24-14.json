        "Wyatt tells Hope that Liam must be losing it .first he steals his truck and RV and kidnaps Hope and now he is issuing ultimatums. She says well they were all sort of freaked out about Hope possibly being pregnant and Liam was affected by this. It just made him realize the finality of the situation that they'd never get back together. Wyatt says he was kind of hoping that is where things stood. He doesn't want to put her on the spot. He knows she has feelings for Liam and he doesn't need it spelled out for him. But to get back to the ultimatum he needs to be very clear .if she goes to Liam's tonight it means she is dating both of them. She says yes and if she doesn't show up, then Liam is done. She tells Wyatt that she is so sorry, the last thing she wants to do is hurt him. Wyatt says he is not hurt, but Liam needs to get a life of his own. He's constantly pushing her buttons. Hope says Liam doesn't see it that way. He's just fighting for what was originally his. He asks what is she gonna do and she doesn't know. He tells her if she keeps looking back in the past that she will miss the future. And it's right here in front of her. So go to Liam if she has to and tell him what he can do with his creepy ultimatum. And tell him once and for all that she is committed to Wyatt. Carter tells Maya that he can tell she is still bothered by Oliver and Aly. She says yes and she doesn't trust his motives especially after hearing him diss her on tape. She tells him not to go all legal on her when he reminds her it is illegal to tape someone without their knowledge. Caroline befriends Aly and asks her to spill. She'd like to know what has her bursting at the seams ..must be something major. She is all flushed and excited and sort of jittery she guesses it might be a guy. Aly admits there is something .someone a guy but Caroline can not tell anyone, even Rick. She would just die if anyone found out. Caroline says she is a good secret keeper. Aly tells her she has been kissed. Caroline realizes she means her very first kiss ..does she have a boyfriend. Aly says she thinks so. He's gorgeous and he has these eyes that just pins her to the wall. He's smart and funny and super talented and very protective. She finally comes out that it is Oliver. Maya drops in on Oliver and he is watching footage of his shoot with Aly in her pool. He says it took a while to loosen Aly up but she'd totally into it now. Maya asks if he has been doing a lot of that lately .easing Aly past her comfort zone. He chuckles that he prefers it as helping her reach her full potential. She says it is a thin line. He wonders if there is something Maya would like to say to him. She says as a matter of fact, there is. She opines that he surprised her today at the meeting by suggesting Aly as the model. Then she realized naturally that he would be the photographer. He says it is his job and Aly is super smoking. Maya says and maybe wanted to get her in some lingerie. He could think of worse things. She says when he speaks of her so casually it worries her. She asks him to please don't take advantage of her. He wonders what makes her think that he is. She says the way he talks about her like she is some means to an end. Like she is a way for him to keep his job and she doesn't want to see Aly used that way. He says it is coming across like he is being a manipulative jerk. She apologizes and says she is just worried about Aly. He says he will be totally honest. He does not hate that she is a Forrester. He likes it here. With the exception of a couple, he likes the family and he wants to be part of this for a long time. Maya interjects and being Aly's boyfriend sort of guarantees that. He admits it strengthens his position but that's not it. He really likes Aly, she is different and refreshing. Maya adds also young, inexperienced and vulnerable, so remember that when going forward. Wyatt is barely listening when Quinn goes on and on about Aly being the possible model. She finally gets him to spill. It's like a new disaster every hour. He says Liam is demanding equal time with Hope. She asks like in a debate. He ways no, Liam is insisting that Hope come over for dinner tonight which will constitute a real date and she will proceed to date both of them. Quinn says that is the most ridiculous thing she has ever heard. Please tell her that is not what Hope is going to do. Brooke asks Hope if Wyatt knows. He could not have been thrilled. Hope says all things considered he was pretty calm. He said it was her choice. But she hasn't made it yet. Something makes her recoil from dating two brothers. Brooke says that would make her like her. She could always call it off with Wyatt. Hope says that is not an option. And Liam knows that. That is partly why he is doing this. She can still see Wyatt but it gives Liam another chance as well. But if she doesn't do this then Liam will move on for good and she's not sure she is ready for that either.",
        "Caroline wants to hear more about Aly and Oliver. Aly says she doesn't know. Usually guys do not find her attractive. Caroline pooh poohs that; she is stunning. Aly says Oliver makes her feel pretty and desirable. Caroline hugs her and says good for Oliver. Look at her, her first kiss, her first boyfriend. But just a little friendly advice from painful experience. It sounds like she has fallen very hard. Just be careful and don't just hand over everything to just any guy. Always make sure there is enough love for herself. Aly thanks her for her advice and listening to her without laughing. Quinn listens but tells Wyatt that she is going to go have a talk with Liam. He stops her cold, saying do not go barreling over there fighting his battles. This is his life and he can handle it. She doesn't think he is doing that if he is just here with his thoughts while Liam is trying to romance the pants off of Hope. Wyatt says that is not going to happen. Quinn says she sees it now \u0096 candlelight, soft music, flowers, everything set up for a romantic recommitment which leaves Wyatt nowhere. Wyatt may be okay with that, but she's not, so who is it going to be, Wyatt sets Liam straight or she will. Brooke tells Hope that she knows how it feels to be torn between two fabulous men. But she has to make a choice and one will be hurt. She offers to talk to Liam and ask him to back off a little. Hope doesn't want her to be caught in the middle. Brooke says okay then she just needs to follow her instincts. When the time comes they will tell her where to be. Maya tells Carter that Oliver said all the right things. He genuinely likes Aly and she believes him. But she can't unhear what he said on the tape. Aly is so innocent and she can relate to that. She's the perfect target for a smooth older guy like Oliver. She just doesn't have a good feeling about it. Aly goes to Oliver's office and they look at the underwater shoot. She's nervous but says she can't stop thinking about him. He says that is what he likes to hear and he will show her really. He kisses her. Liam turns the soft music on, he has the fireplace going, lights a gazillion candles, rearranges the flowers several times, has a bouquet of flowers to give Hope and changes his mind about the white or red wine and puts both bottles out. He keeps looking at the clock then finally hears a knock at his door."

        "Wyatt: I didn't mean to put you on the spot.",
        "Hope: No, no, no, no. You had every right to ask.",
        "Wyatt: Well, pretend I didn't. I just -- I know you have feelings for Liam, for some inexplicable reason, and I don't need it spelled out for me. It just -- let's get back to the ultimatum here, 'cause I need to be completely sure about everything. Uh... so, if you go to Liam's tonight for dinner, that means that you're officially dating both of us.",
        "Hope: Yes. And if I don't show up, then Liam's done.",
        "Wyatt: Liam needs a life of his own.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Oh, God. I am so sorry. The last thing that I want to do is hurt you.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I'm not hurt. Okay? It's just -- I'm frustrated that Liam can't or won't leave you alone. He's constantly pushing your buttons.",
        "Hope: He doesn't see it that way. You know, he just sees it as fighting for what was originally his.",

        "Wyatt: Is it okay if I weigh in?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: If you keep looking back in the past, you will miss the future. And it's right here, Hope. Right in front of you. So, go to Liam if you have to. And tell him what he can do with his creepy ultimatum. And tell him once and for all that you're committed to me.",

        "Aly: No, you don't understand. That's never -- I mean, I haven't --",
        "Caroline: Oh! It's your first kiss! Oh! So, wait. Are you telling me that you have a boyfriend?",
        "Aly: I think so.",
        "Caroline: What is he like?",
        "Aly: Well... gorgeous, and he's got these eyes that just, like, pin me to the wall, and he's so smart and funny and super talented. And he's a little bit older, but not too much. The thing is -- actually, there are a lot of things, but one that makes me protective, I guess, of us -- whatever it is we're doing. I'm confusing you, aren't I?",
        "Caroline: No. Not at all. I'm right with you.",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Caroline: So, what's the big thing?",

        "Oliver: What? You don't think she's sexy enough? Trust me, that girl is smokin'.",
        "Maya: I love Aly. She's not a typical model.",
        "Oliver: That's what makes her special.",
        "Maya: I was wondering why you pitched it in the first place. And then I thought about it. You would naturally be the photographer.",
        "Oliver: It's my job.",
        "Maya: And maybe you wanted to get Aly in some lingerie.",
        "Oliver: I can think of worse things.",
        "Maya: Ugh! Okay, I am trying to be down with the guy-talk thing, but, honestly, when you speak so casually about her, that's what concerns me. Please don't take advantage of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hey, hey, hey! Was that unbelievable or what?! I almost fell out of my chair! Weren't you shocked? Oliver putting up Aly as the spokesmodel for Brooke's Bedroom? What was he thinking?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Huh? Hey. Are you even listening to me?",
        "Wyatt: What? Yeah, I'm listening to you. Yes.",
        "Quinn: You're not even listening to me at all. What happened now?",
        "Wyatt: Wow. You say that as if there's a new disaster every hour.",
        "Quinn: Conditioning. Spill it.",
        "Wyatt: It's nothing I can't handle.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: All right! It's Liam!",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Liam! What has he done now?",
        "Wyatt: He's demanding equal time.",
        "Quinn: What, like -- like in a debate?",
        "Wyatt: No, like the ongoing, endless competition for Hope. He's insisting that she go over to his house for dinner tonight, which, in his mind, will constitute an official date. After which, she'll proceed to date both of us equally.",
        "Quinn: That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.",
        "Wyatt: Ha ha!",
        "Quinn: Oh, please tell me she put a stop to that stupidity. She's not going over there, is she?",
        "Wyatt: Honestly? [Sighs] I don't know what she's gonna do.",

        "Hope: Yeah, I told him.",
        "Brooke: He can't be thrilled.",
        "Hope: No. Um... but, all things considered, he was pretty calm. He said it was my choice.",
        "Brooke: Which is?",
        "Hope: I haven't made it yet. But something in me instinctively recoils from dating two brothers.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. You don't want to be like me.",
        "Hope: No, it's -- it's just that it would be weird, I think.",
        "Brooke: I don't know. Okay. Uh, you could call it off with Wyatt.",
        "Hope: Not an option. I don't want to do that. And Liam knows that. That's partly why he's doing this. I can still see Wyatt, but at the same time give Liam another chance. But if I don't do this, then Liam moves on for good, and I'm not sure I'm ready for that, either. [Sighs]",

        "Caroline: Wow, so... you and Oliver?",
        "Aly: Well...sort of. I think. Look, I don't know. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. Guys just don't find me attractive.",
        "Caroline: Okay, well, that's not possible. You're stunning, so...",
        "Aly: Oliver makes me feel... pretty. Desirable.",
        "Caroline: Well, you know what I say? Good for Oliver!",
        "Aly: Listen, you don't think I'm, you know, reading too much into it?",
        "Caroline: I mean, that's really for you to say.",
        "Aly: No. No, I'm not making it up. He likes me.",
        "Caroline: And obviously the feeling's mutual.",
        "Aly: Oliver is... everything.",
        "Caroline: Look at you! First kiss, first boyfriend. You've been busy. [Gasps ] And you cleared up the mystery of the meeting.",
        "Aly: The what?",
        "Caroline: Why you didn't get offended when Oliver suggested you for the Bedroom line.",
        "Aly: No, I wasn't offended.",
        "Caroline: I'm really happy for you, Aly. But...just... a little friendly advice from painful experience.",
        "Aly: Please.",
        "Caroline: It sounds like you've fallen very hard. \"Oliver's everything.\" Just...be careful with that. You know, don't hand over everything to any guy. Always make sure that there's enough love left for you.",
        "Aly: Okay. Thank you for the advice, for listening. For not laughing at me.",
        "Caroline: No! What you're experiencing is beautiful, Aly. You should enjoy it. Okay? Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What makes you think I'm taking advantage of Aly?",
        "Maya: The way you talk about her sometimes, like she's a means to an end. Like she's a way to keep your job. I just don't want to see Aly used like that.",
        "Oliver: By a manipulative jerk like me?",
        "Maya: That's not what I said.",
        "Oliver: That's how it's coming across.",
        "Maya: Well, I apologize. Really. I'm just concerned for Aly.",
        "Oliver: You want honesty?",
        "Maya: Yes, please.",
        "Oliver: Do I hate that she's a Forrester? Hell, no! I like it here. I like the family, with an exception or two. I want to be a part of this for a very long time.",
        "Maya: And being Aly's boyfriend kind of guarantees that.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, it strengthens my position. But that's not it. I genuinely like Aly. I think she's -- she's different. She's refreshing.",
        "Maya: She's also young, inexperienced, and vulnerable. Just...remember that going forward.",
        "Oliver: Of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I'm gonna go have a little chat with Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Mom! Stay put. I mean it. You can't go barreling over there fighting my battles. This is my life. I can handle it.",
        "Quinn: By doing what? Sitting here and staring at your thoughts while Liam is -- oh, pardon my bluntness -- romancing the pants off of Hope?",
        "Wyatt: Hey, that's not gonna happen, okay?",
        "Quinn: Do you have any idea what she's walking into right now? Oh, let me tell you. Candlelight, soft music, flowers, everything setup for a romantic recommitment, and where does that leave you? Absolutely nowhere. You know what? You may be okay with that, but I'm not. Okay, Wyatt. It's your call. You want to go set Liam straight or shall I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I know what it's like to be between two fabulous, wonderful men, and you're gonna have to make a choice. I mean, from the outside, what woman wouldn't feel flattered, right? But the truth is somebody's heart is gonna get broken.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: I could talk to Liam.",
        "Hope: What? Why?",
        "Brooke: Tell him to back off a little bit, not put you under so much pressure.",
        "Hope: No, no. Really. Don't get in the middle.",
        "Brooke: Honey, I'm your mom. I am in the middle.",
        "Hope: Well, try to restrain yourself. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Okay. The best thing to do is to follow your instincts. When the time comes, they will tell you where to be.",

        "Carter: But you don't buy it.",
        "Maya: That's the thing. I believe him. But I can't un-hear what he said on that tape, how cavalier and disrespectful he was. Aly is so innocent. And I relate to that. She's the perfect target for an older, smooth guy like Oliver. I just don't have a good feeling about it.",
