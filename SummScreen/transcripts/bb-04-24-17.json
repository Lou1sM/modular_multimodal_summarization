{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7571 ~ Ridge attempts to heal his heartbreak by replacing the designs stolen by Spectra Fashions; Katie has a much different opinion than Quinn regarding a suitable position for her at Forrester Creations."], "Recap": ["Brooke wakes up and immediately smiles as she sees her ring back on her finger. Bill says it is not a dream. Wyatt and Liam are in discussion at Spencer's and Wyatt says their dad will still get his skyscraper but it will just take a little longer than he expected. Bill brushes past them without a hello but whistling and they notice he is wearing his sword necklace again. Bill says yes and so is Brooke ..not the necklace but her engagement ring. They are getting married. Quinn shows Katie around the office and even points out that Pam gets a little flustered but she does her best work when she shares her duties with someone. Katie quips that she is not coming back to FC to be a secretary. Maybe she will see Eric instead. She sees Eric is designing along with Ridge but says she is checking in to let him know she is ready and able to help in any way she can. Eric says they can always use some help and next thing you know Katie says she is not experienced but she knows good fashion and she will help in any way she can. Much to Quinn's chagrin Katie offers to help with the jewelry. Quinn tells her that she can do anything here she wants to but not work with her on the jewelry line.", "Bill tells his skyscraper it might not happen today but it will still happen someday. He tells his boys just say it often enough like he did with Brooke and it will happen. Bill would like to find out just what Brooke and Ridge broke up over. Liam and Wyatt say they are not worried but Bill should know Ridge is still pursuing Brooke. Bill says he is not worried. Ridge sees Brooke's ring and wishes she had not done that. He tells her to take it off. He screwed up but that is no excuse for her to do it too. She tells him it is in his DNA, he cannot be committed to any woman. It is a game to him and that is not what she wants with betrayal for her or for RJ. She says there will always be a place in her heart but she cannot be his anymore. They had dreams and they had visions and wanted to be happy for the rest of their lives but that is just not possible. Katie says she needs a job and Quinn needs help so why is it so bad. Together they can celebrate the sanctity of her marriage. Quinn will be true to that beautiful man who loves and trusts her. She will not tell Eric anything unless Quinn forces her too. Quinn says that will not be a problem. Katie says good but if working conditions are not tenable then she will be forced to tell Eric. She can't wait. With her back turned, Katie goes on and on how she appreciates Quinn seeing it her way and welcoming her to work with her. Quinn picks up a silver letter opener and it seems she knows exactly what to do with it."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: [Chuckles]", "Brooke: [Giggles]", "Bill: It's not a dream. Your ring is back where it belongs, and my sword is back around my neck.", "Brooke: All is right in the world. [Exhales deeply]", "Bill: Yeah, that's an understatement. I spent the night with you in my arms on top of a bed of cash.", "Brooke: [Gasps]", "Bill: How could it be more right than that?", "Brooke: [Laughing] Oh, my gosh. We have to save some of this! We have a wedding to plan for.", "Bill: Uh, I think we'll be okay. I can afford it. So, um... what do you say we get married in Monte Carlo?", "Brooke: Oh, that is a great idea.", "Bill: On the Stella Maris.", "Brooke: [Gasps] I love it! So many decisions to make.", "Bill: Yeah, too many decisions. But, you know what? They can all wait for after.", "Brooke: After?", "Bill: After this.", "Brooke: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Dad's big skyscraper, on hold again.", "Liam: I know. He was so excited about expanding downtown.", "Wyatt: Oh, he will. Just might not happen as quickly as he thought. The stolen designs might have bought spectra some time, but it can't sustain them for long, right?", "Liam: It's true.", "Wyatt: Steffy must be livid.", "Liam: Yeah, I mean, an entire collection wasted.", "Wyatt: No plans on releasing the designs anyway?", "Liam: Nope, it's back to the drawing board for Forrester.", "Wyatt: Literally.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: No, that's good work, Thomas.

I thought I just transferred you through.", "Katie: I am really curious to see what position you think I'm right for.", "Pam: Testing? 1, 2 -- [Groans]", "Quinn: Well, actually, one position does come to mind...", "Katie: Really?", "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you see, Pam is getting so flustered, and I heard that she actually does a better job when she shared her desk.", "Katie: Shared her desk?", "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "Katie: So you think I'm going to...", "Quinn: I mean...", "Pam: [Sighs] Is anybody hungry?", "Quinn: [Laughs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Have you heard from dad?", "Liam: Mnh-mnh.", "Wyatt: It's weird he's not here yet.", "Liam: Yeah, well... maybe he forgot we were having a meeting.", "Wyatt: Alison doesn't let him forget anything.", "Liam: Yeah.

I'm just trying to work you in, so...", "Katie: Let's see if Eric has any better ideas, shall we?", "Quinn: What? No! Wait!", "Katie: Good morning!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Katie, hi. Good to see you.", "Katie: You're hard at work, I see.", "Quinn: Yes, they are, which is why we ought to discuss this later.", "Eric: Discuss what?", "Quinn: Her possible employment.", "Eric: Oh! That! Of course. Well, I'm up for that. It's just, uh...", "Katie: Oh, no, no, no, no. I get it. I get it. You two are in crisis mode, the company. You need to be designing. That's where you energy should be focused. I just want you to know that I am ready and willing to help in any way I can.", "Eric: Well, it's no secret that we could use some extra hands around here.", "Katie: You're right about that. No secret at all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: So Jarrett's pushing for an extension, but I feel like if we can get this story in the very next issue, we'll be good.", "Bill: [Whistles]", "Wyatt: Yeah, I -- well, well, well.", "Liam: Look what the cat dragged in.", "Wyatt: About time, too! We were just about to leave.", "Liam: Meeting ended an hour ago, by the way, but we're happy to e-mail you the minutes.", "[Whistling continues]", "Liam: Yo! Oh, look!

We are getting married.", "Wyatt: What?!", "Liam: [Laughs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Listen, I know it's a terrible time for Forrester, with everything that happened with spectra, but if there is any way at all you can use me, please, please do.", "Brooke: Hi.", "Katie: Hi!", "Brooke: Katie, what are you doing here?", "Katie: Oh, uh, well, working, I hope.", "Brooke: What? Seriously?", "Katie: Yeah, it was Quinn's idea.", "Brooke: Oh. That's excellent.", "Katie: I think so. [Laughs]", "Brooke: Okay. Well, I heard your voice. I just wanted to see what was going on. I better get back to work.", "Katie: Okay. See you later.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: Um, Eric, line 2. It sounds important.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Eric Forrester. What?! Damn it!", "Quinn: What is it?", "Eric: Spectra not only stole from couture, they stole from the jewelry line, as well.", "Quinn: What?!", "Eric: We're gonna need all new pieces for this collection.", "Quinn: No! No, no, no, no! We can't! Ivy isn't here! She's in Australia. I told that she could take the time off. I mean, a whole new line?", "Eric: Yes. I'm afraid so.", "Quinn: Eric, I'm gonna need help. I mean, even -- even with ivy here, there's no way that we would have enough time to come up with a whole new collection that quickly.", "Eric: Katie. I think I just figured out where you can fit in.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Oh! The jewelry line!", "Quinn: No, no! Wait! Hold on one second!", "Katie: Oh, my gosh. That sounds amazing. I mean, obviously I've never designed before, but god knows I've worn my fair share of jewelry, and I think have a pretty good style.", "Quinn: Wait! Hold on a second, Eric! It doesn't matter about style. It takes more than...", "Katie: Oh, I know, I know. I'm sure it's really difficult, but you can walk me through it. I'm a really quick study. It sounds fascinating.", "Eric: Look, I think it's a pretty good idea, but of course, it's up to you, honey. But she's here and she can help.", "Katie: So, what do you say, Quinn? I mean, could you use my help? You said you couldn't do it all by yourself, so... sounds to me like working with me might be in your best interest.", "Quinn: Sounds like it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door closes]", "Brooke: What are you doing? You should be sketching right now.", "Ridge: Just taking a break.", "Brooke: Yeah? Well, I'm just catching up with a few things here.", "Ridge: I just want you to hear me. It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake. It was silly, but we --", "Brooke: Stop.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: All right, well, I think this is a great idea. Katie can help process designs, she can oversee production, and keep an eye on the budget. Anything that can make things easier for you.", "Katie: Absolutely. I can't wait to work side by side with you, Quinn.", "Eric: Wonderful. Congratulations.", "Katie: Thank you. Thank you so much!", "Eric: All right. I need to get this downstairs. I can't wait to see what you come up with.", "Katie: Bye.", "Eric: Bye.", "Katie: This is gonna be so much fun.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: You can do anything here -- anything you want -- except work with me on the jewelry line.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Engaged? You got engaged to Brooke?", "Bill: Hell yeah! I told you the big dog was gonna come out on top!", "Wyatt: Persistence really does pay off. Congratulations.", "Bill: Thank you, son.", "Liam: Finally wore her done. Happy for you.", "Bill: And thank you, son. You know, technically, she asked me.", "Wyatt: Whoa!", "Liam: Whoa!", "Wyatt: That's impressive!", "Liam: Yeah! When's the big day?", "Bill: I don't know, but soon. I don't want to wait. But wherever it is and whenever it is, I expect you both to be there.", "Liam: Wouldn't miss it.", "Wyatt: Well, as long as it doesn't take away from work. Making money. That's us Spencers, right? And, uh, you know, we're not gonna take a full day off 'cause, I mean, we do have this teeny-tiny skyscraper we're trying to build.", "Bill: I don't give a damn about the skyscraper.", "Liam: Huh?", "Bill: Well, that's not true. I -- no, I do give a damn. I care, but... don't worry, beautiful. Sometime, you will get built.", "Wyatt: There he is.", "Liam: Does he know it can't hear him?", "Wyatt: I honestly don't know what's happening right now.", "Bill: Oh, let me tell you something. If you haven't learned it yet, you should learn it now. You say it loud enough, you say it with conviction, and it'll happen.", "Wyatt: The same way you did with Brooke?", "Bill: Exactly. I told her that poser was gonna let her down and that I would be there for her when he did. And here we are.", "Liam: Yeah, what happened there, by the way? 'Cause they were this close to get married in Australia.", "Bill: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know, but I, uh... I do want to find out. I'm very curious about what he did to screw up again. And why's he given up.", "Liam: Has he? Has he given up?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Wow. That was fast. I know you're disappointed and I know you're hurt, but what are you doing?", "Brooke: What I should have done a long time ago.", "Ridge: Think about R.J. And think about our family.", "Brooke: I am thinking about R.J. I want him to see me finally being loved.", "Ridge: You are loved by me. I can do this.", "Brooke: No, you can't, ridge. You've never been able to.", "Ridge: I screwed up. But I don't have feelings for Quinn, you know that. Don't marry bill because I made a mistake. Please take off that ring and give me another chance.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I don't give a damn whether or not Forrester's given up on Brooke.", "Liam: Well, if he's pursuing her and causing problems, then...", "Bill: It doesn't matter! She's given up on him! You have nothing to worry about.", "Wyatt: Okay, we're not worried. We just -- we know how ridge is.", "Bill: I do, too. He's an idiot. Messes up every relationship. Even when it's \"destiny.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: How do I give you another chance? A man who I saw kissing another woman the day before we were supposed to get married. Your father's wife. Do you know how hurtful that was?", "Ridge: I can't imagine. I tried to explain...", "Brooke: Ridge, you can explain this. It's who you are. It's what you do. You have this need to conquer women, no matter how inappropriate it is. Forget about your commitments, forget about your loyalties...", "Ridge: I know --", "Brooke: You know what? You don't know. We were kids. That's what brought us together. We both didn't have any boundaries. But I've changed. I have grown and I have matured, and that is not the kind of life that I want for myself, full of heartbreak and full of betrayal...", "Ridge: I don't want that, either.", "Brooke: Well, your actions say something different. You'll end up with Quinn. You'll take her away from your father.", "Ridge: No, that's not gonna happen.", "Brooke: I don't know what's gonna happen, ridge, and I don't care because it's not my problem anymore. I am marrying bill. I'm gonna be Mrs. Bill Spencer.", "Ridge: Don't say that.", "Brooke: You have hurt me for the very last time. There will always be a place for you in my heart. But I can't let you access that anymore. I mean, hey, we had a good run, right? The boy from Beverly hills and the girl from the valley. We had these dreams, and we had this vision. We wanted a family, and we were gonna be married and happy for the rest of our lives. But that's just not possible.", "Ridge: Logan.", "Brooke: No.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I just really want you to try to have an open mind about this. I mean, I need a job, you need help.", "Quinn: Not from you! How am I supposed to design with you breathing down my neck, blackmailing me?", "Katie: Oh, for god's sake, I'm not blackmailing you.", "Quinn: Showing up at work every single day, looking over my shoulder -- I can't take that!", "Katie: I'm sure you'll figure out a way to deal with it. Eric offered me a position, and I accepted.", "Quinn: Katie, please --", "Katie: This is a good opportunity for both of us.", "Quinn: For me? How?", "Katie: You're going to design, I'm gonna handle the marketing and the P.R., And together, we are going to celebrate the sanctity of your marriage. See, I get it. You don't like this. You don't like not being in control. You like walking around and having everyone feel intimidated and afraid of what you're gonna do next and wondering what you're capable of. Well, times have changed. I'm in control now, and I know what you're capable of. You are gonna be true to that beautiful man who loves you, who trusts you. For some reason, you make him happy, and you're not gonna hurt him.", "Quinn: You're the one threatening to do that by threatening to tell him.", "Katie: Only if you force me to! I don't want have to do that! But you keep telling me that there's nothing to tell him, so let's keep it that way.", "Quinn: Oh, okay. So, then, that's the deal, right? You -- you keep your mouth shut if I show you that I'm loyal to Eric? Well, that's not gonna be a problem.", "Katie: Well...", "Quinn: What?", "Katie: I'm hoping that you'll be a decent co-worker. You know, a mentor. You can teach me everything you know about jewelry. I mean, if I feel like it's an unhealthy work environment, then I'm gonna have to tell Eric.", "Quinn: Welcome to the jewelry line.", "Katie: Thank you. See? Now, that wasn't so hard. Let's get to it. You are not gonna regret this. I am very good at what I do. I think what we need are copies of all the current couture designs, and you know what? Ridge and Eric and Thomas -- they all have such different sensibilities. I'm really curious as to how you're gonna pair things with each different couture design. And, you know, the models have to be taken into consideration. You might have somebody who has a really long neck, or really wide shoulders, you know, the fabrics of the gowns. This is so exciting. I cannot wait to learn how you deal with all this stuff.", "Quinn: Yeah, I, uh -- I can't wait to teach you.", "Katie: Yeah?", "Quinn: Yeah. Yeah, Katie, I will take really good care of you.", "Katie: Good. I do like these. Very unique."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCGlfsdo9aE"}
