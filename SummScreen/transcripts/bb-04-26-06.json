        "[Brooke remembering]",
        "Ridge: Brooke, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll make this right. I -- I promise you that.",

        "Nick: It was so hard last night I didn't want to leave you.",
        "Brooke: I didn't want to talk anymore.",
        "Nick: I know. Listen, I -- I called a doctor, and I told him what happened with his pills.",
        "Brooke: No, I threw them away.",
        "Nick: Brooke, you shouldn't have been taking these things at all. You were too stressed out. Forrester should not have brought your father here.",
        "Brooke: He was just trying to help.",
        "Nick: He was trying to help? Why was he here last night? What were you so upset about? What's going on? Why won't you tell me what happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Staring at the phone won't make it ring.",
        "Ridge: Taylor --",
        "Taylor: Well, I knew you were busy, so I just thought maybe I'd just go ahead and bring this by.",
        "Ridge: What is it?",
        "Taylor: Steffy's trip abroad. You know, the international studies class? I told you about it the other day that she needs both of our signatures on the permission form. Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Ridge: No, no, no. Not about the trip.",
        "Taylor: Ridge, is something wrong? You know, I -- I can always tell when something's troubling you. So what is it, something to do with Brooke? Let me guess, she's got you jumping through hoops.",
        "Ridge: No, it's not like that at all.",
        "Taylor: Then what else can it possibly be? Or is it something that's just so sordid that you can't even tell your own ex-wife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: I can't believe that Bridget would try to take my son to Italy.",
        "Christian: Felicia, they're only talking a week.",
        "Felicia: A week will be like a month when you're living on borrowed time.",
        "Christian: Hey, nothing is going to happen to you, okay?",
        "Felicia: You don't know that, not for certain. And I just can't risk being apart from my son.",
        "Stephanie: I faxed the guardianship papers over to the lawyers. They're gonna get back to me as soon as they can.",
        "Felicia: Did you tell her that it's an emergency, that they're gonna leave tonight unless we do something?",
        "Stephanie: Felicia -- it's not gonna happen, if I have to stop them myself. Honey, no one is going to take your little child out of this country, I promise you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Well, obviously, you don't want to talk about this.",
        "Brooke: I just wish I could forget the whole thing.",
        "Nick: Forget what? Forget what? What are we talking about? What happened?",
        "Brooke: It wasn't Ridge's fault, Nick. I know that now.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Nick: I'll -- I'll get it.",
        "Brooke: No, I don't want anything to happen --",
        "Nick: I'll get it. Who are you?",
        "Stephen: Stephen Logan, Brooke's father. Who are you?",
        "Nick: My name's Nick. What do you want?",
        "Stephen: I'd like to see my daughter.",
        "Nick: Well, get in line.",
        "Brooke: Nick. Nick!",
        "Nick: I love that woman. I know your history with her, so you convince me why I should let you in this room.",
        "Stephen: I admit I've made mistakes. I'm determined to make up for them, which I thought I was starting to do the last time I was here. Am I wrong?",
        "Nick: You don't have to do this. He can leave.",
        "Brooke: Actually, there is something that I'd like to talk to my father about. Would you mind?",
        "Nick: You sure?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Okay? I'll call you later. We'll talk about this later.",
        "Stephen: He's very -- direct. Quite a contrast from Ridge.",
        "Brooke: I don't want to talk about Nick, or Ridge. Just say what you came to say, and then go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Ooh, um, maybe I struck a nerve. What did Brooke do?",
        "Ridge: Not Brooke, me. I made a mess of things, doc. It started with bringing Stephen Logan back here.",
        "Taylor: You what? Ridge, come on, you of all people know how much Brooke resents her father for walking out on her. Why would you take a risk like that? Unless, I don't know, what were you trying to do, deal with her abandonment issues, thinking that's the reason she won't come back to you?",
        "Ridge: After last night, I screwed things up. I screwed things up worse than I can even tell you.",
        "Taylor: Well, maybe bringing her father back into the picture wasn't the best way to deal with your problems, but I seriously doubt you destroyed any trust she has. Maybe you two should just deal with each other the way that Brooke knows how to connect best -- in the bedroom. I mean, that seems to be where all of her problems fall away. You got your freedom. I don't know what you've been waiting for.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, if only I had waited.",
        "Taylor: Oh. So you two were together then last night. So what's the matter? Isn't that what you wanted? Isn't that what the two of you wanted, right? Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Stephanie: How's Felicia?",
        "Christian: Resting.",
        "Stephanie: Good. I was afraid she'd give you a hard time once she got you over to the guesthouse. But you seem to have a way with her that I don't.",
        "Christian: I gather your relationship has had its ups and downs.",
        "Stephanie: You could say that. Has she given you the gory details?",
        "Christian: I know she's very grateful to you.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, trust me, it could've gone either way.",
        "Christian: But it didn't. And now, the future looks really bright.",
        "Stephanie: And now, she deserves to enjoy the time that she's been given without going through all of this stress.",
        "Christian: You're upset with Bridget.",
        "Stephanie: Yes and no. I'm -- I'm upset 'cause I perceive this to be thoughtlessness on her part. I know she's been through a lot, but she only seems to see it through her point of view and not Felicia's, and I'm concerned it's at Felicia's expense.",
        "Christian: I think it's a little more complicated than that, given how much that little boy has come to mean to Bridget.",
        "Stephanie: Well, the document's pretty straightforward. Bridget only becomes a guardian when and if Felicia dies.",
        "Christian: Or if Felicia's no longer able to care for the child.",
        "Stephanie: But the point is, she is able to care for him, and she is alive. And that's pretty straightforward.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Whatever happened between you and Brooke last night, if it was something sexual happened, then obviously she doesn't love nick as much as she tries to make him believe she does. What is it? Am I missing something here?",
        "Ridge: You asked me if it was what we both wanted.",
        "Taylor: Obviously, it would be, since she, you know --",
        "Ridge: It wasn't exactly consensual.",
        "Taylor: What happened? What did you do, Ridge?",
        "Stephen: I -- I checked into that camping spot that we used to go to. I thought maybe we could take Hope and R.J. and spend a little time there together, just the four of us. Please, I'm not trying to pressure you in any way. I realize we need to take this very slowly, but it just seemed that the other night, you were beginning to let me back in a little. Was that just wishful thinking? Brooke?",
        "Brooke: I heard you. I just have a lot on my mind.",
        "Stephen: None of which has anything to do with us or our relationship.",
        "Brooke: Our what? Do you expect me to make time for you now that you finally have time for me?",
        "Stephen: I'm sorry. I -- I should've real -- you -- you said that you had something you wanted to talk to me about. Or was that just an excuse to get Nick to leave? I should've called before I stopped by. I will next time. Bye, sweetheart.",
        "Brooke: Dad, wait. This isn't about you. It's about Nick and Ridge. I haven't been more confused in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Brooke was on some kind of medication. I didn't know how out of it she was until after. Taylor, you know me. I would never force myself on any woman. It was all a terrible misunderstanding.",
        "Taylor: And you regret it?",
        "Ridge: Of course I regret it. I feel terrible. I wanted last night to be very different than it was. Look, I'm sorry, I've got to go to Brooke and somehow make this right. Whatever it takes, I've got to make this right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christian: Bridget may not have any legal claim, but as a father, Dante does.",
        "Stephanie: Let me worry about Dante.",
        "Christian: He loves that little boy, Mrs. Forrester. So does Bridget -- very much.",
        "Stephanie: I know that. I know that, Dr. Ramirez, and I appreciate it. But right now, my only concern is Felicia. She has to have that child with her as long as she's alive, and I have to make sure that he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: I know, Steffy. I'm excited for you, too. Mm-hmm. No, no, go ahead. All right. I'll talk to you later. Love you.",
        "Nick: Where's Forrester?",
        "Taylor: Nick?",
        "Nick: I want to talk to him. Where is he?",
        "Taylor: What's wrong?",
        "Nick: He was at Brooke's last night, and something happened. She's upset and not telling me. I want to know. This is his office. Did you talk to him? What'd he say? What did he say about what happened last night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: I realize I've been a lousy father, and that's why you're reluctant to open up to me. Not that I'd have all the answers even if you did, but I could listen.",
        "Brooke: And what good will that do? You're hardly objective. You came here to help Ridge win me back. You don't understand anything about my feeling for Nick, anymore than Ridge does.",
        "Stephen: I understand that you have loved Ridge most of your life. I understand he loves you, despite the mistakes he's made. That's why when he sought me out in Paris, I thought I'd be helping -- helping reunite you with the man that you used to refer to as \"your destiny.\" If I underestimated your feelings for Nick --",
        "Brooke: You don't know anything about my feelings for Nick. You don't know how much we love each other and what we've been through to be together, and what we still need to go through because of last night!",
        "Stephen: Last night?",
        "Brooke: On medication, and I wasn't thinking straight. And Ridge said he didn't mean to do that.",
        "Stephen: Ridge? Ridge is why you're this upset? My god, honey, what happened between you two last night? Did Ridge do something?",
        "Brooke: Ridge got in bed with me, and I didn't know what was happening. I told him to go.",
        "Stephen: Oh, baby. Honey, I am so sorry.",
        "Brooke: Could you please go get me some water?",
        "Stephen: Sure, sure.",
        "Ridge: I couldn't stay away. I have to know that you know that I never meant any harm. Brooke, if I had thought for one second it wasn't what you wanted -- I was so sure. I was so sure that this was our coming together. And it still could be, Brooke, if you just understand --",
        "Stephen: Take your hands off my daughter! Take your hands off her!",
        "Ridge: Stephen, what's going on?",
        "Stephen: I know what happened here last night, and I know what you did. I may have been a pathetic father most of my life, but no more. You do one more thing to harm my little girl, and I swear to god, Ridge, I will make you pay, in ways that you can't even begin to imagine."
