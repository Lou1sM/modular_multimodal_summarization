        "Liam sees the tattoo ring and asks if that is what he thinks it is. Steffy answers that it just happened this afternoon. He is sure that Wyatt pushed her into this. Caroline stops by and Wyatt shows her his manly ring. Deacon tells Quinn that she is mooning over Liam when they should be getting out of Dodge tonight. Adam I just some fantasy. She says he is not a fantasy. They had real feelings. He says Adam and Eve is over and she needs to concentrate on saving her own butt if there is even time for that. He barks that she tried to kill him and yet in his twisted head he still cares for her. This is not his first rodeo and he knows Bill is not going to stop until he sees them behind bars. She tells him to stop; she needs to think and she is not going anywhere until .Caroline cannot believe that Quinn has not been caught. Wyatt says even if his mother had not interfered he thinks it was over for Liam and Steffy. What is meant to be is meant to be. Quinn tells Deacon that she is not worried about herself. She is worried about Liam and she needs to go see him tonight. Liam tells Steffy that they cannot let Quinn win. They were robbed and manipulated. Quinn took that and gave it to her son. He says she settled and of all things she even got this tattoo after he came home and told her his feelings. Quinn is still doing this to them. He still loves her and he knows Steffy's eyes are screaming that she loves him too. All she says is that she does not want to hurt him. Caroline says it is good to see Wyatt like this and he deserves to be happy. She reminds him though that Liam has feelings for her too. Wyatt says he knows. He and his brother had a little talk and he wants to re-wind that clock and go back to the way it was. He sympathizes but only to a point. They had an on again and off again relationship and two marriages that did not stick. They need to let go and have some kind f happiness. She is there now and he cannot wait until she comes home.",
        "Quinn tells Deacon to please do not try to stop her. Liam does not despise her. He is angry at her and there are things she needs to explain to him. He tells her this is insane and she is going to end up in a jail cell. He begs her to stay but she runs out. Liam asks Steffy to tell him that this ring does not mean what Wyatt thinks it is. She made vows before she knew what was going on. He wants to hear the words that she still loves him. Finally she cries that she does and they shared so much. They had a baby together and she will never forget that. She is sorry but she has to leave. Instead of going home Steffy goes to the office where she has memories of her and Liam on the beach. Liam opens his door and there is Quinn. He does not invite her in. She says before he calls the police she wants him to listen to her. She knows she did things wrong but the old Quinn would not be standing here now asking him to understand. His love changed her and she wants him to know that."

        "Liam: What is that? Is that a wedding band?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: Forgot your key, Mrs. Spencer?",
        "Caroline: No, but would you settle for your favorite cousin, who brings presents?",
        "Wyatt: Of course! Come in!",
        "Caroline: Yay! It's another wedding gift from Ridge and me.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you. Where's Douglas?",
        "Caroline: It's past his bedtime.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. So, Dad is babysitting, then?",
        "Caroline: Yes. Ridge is with him.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Caroline: I guess I don't have to ask you how marriage is going. You got a big old dumb goofy smile on your face.",
        "Wyatt: That's not big, dumb, and goofy! This is rugged and manly. Check it. Pretty cool, huh? [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: You're delusional. You know that? I mean, here you are. You're mooning over Liam when we should be getting the hell out of LA tonight.",
        "Quinn: Stop pressuring me. I know what I'm doing.",
        "Deacon: You're letting your hormones get the best of you here, lady.",
        "Quinn: What I feel for Adam isn't hormones.",
        "Deacon: I'm sorry. Who? Adam? No, no. His name is Liam. Adam is some fantasy that you conjured up.",
        "Quinn: I didn't conjure up how we feel about each other.",
        "Deacon: Liam cannot stand you for what you did to him and what you did to his life. That's how he feels about you. Adam and Eve -- you and Liam -- honey, that's over. That is done. You need to come to grips with that, and you need to start focusing on saving your own butt, if there's still time.",
        "Quinn: I still have time.",
        "Deacon: See? That's why you're delusional. Spencer's already put the screws to me, and why the hell I didn't tell him that you're holed up in this dump, I don't know. I mean, I shouldn't have an ounce of loyalty toward you after you pushed me off the damn cliff.",
        "Quinn: How long are you going to hold that against me?",
        "Deacon: You tried to kill me, woman!",
        "Quinn: And you still care about me. And you call me the delusional one?",
        "Deacon: Fine. Fine. You know what? You are absolutely right, because there is some reason that I don't fully comprehend in my twisted head why I still care what happens to you, which is why we got to get the hell out of here. It's not safe here.",
        "Quinn: Are you sure that nobody followed you back here?",
        "Deacon: This isn't my first rodeo.",
        "Quinn: Then what's the problem?",
        "Deacon: Bill Spencer is spitting mad at you for screwing with his sons' lives. That guy is not gonna rest till he sees you behind bars.",
        "Quinn: He hasn't found me so far, and neither have the cops.",
        "Deacon: Come on, Quinn. He found me. It's a matter of time before he finds you.",
        "Quinn: Just stop, okay? Just stop. I don't want to listen to this anymore. I need to think.",
        "Deacon: What the hell is there to think about? Come on! You need to get out of here now! Otherwise, you're gonna be toast, and you know what? So am I for helping you.",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Deacon: No?",
        "Quinn: I'm not going anywhere, not until -- I'm staying put.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: We could have opted for traditional wedding bands, but who wants traditional? That's not who Steffy and I are.",
        "Caroline: I don't know. I mean, your wedding ceremony was kind of traditional.",
        "Wyatt: Well, because it wasn't just about us. It was about all the people who wanted to come down and share in our happiness. But this -- this is totally Steffy and me and our commitment to each other.",
        "Caroline: When did you get that?",
        "Wyatt: Today.",
        "Caroline: Whose idea was it?",
        "Wyatt: Mine, but Steffy wanted it, too.",
        "Caroline: That's quite a statement.",
        "Wyatt: Are you jealous?",
        "Caroline: No.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Caroline: Listen, I'm just happy that Ridge didn't tie a damn ribbon around my finger like he did with Katie.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, maybe something told him that it wasn't gonna last for long. That's -- that's not how it is with Steffy.",
        "Caroline: Even though Liam's back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: When did -- when did you do this? This wasn't here at the party earlier at Forrester.",
        "Steffy: No. No, no. It happened after.",
        "Liam: So, you and Wyatt just... it was his idea, wasn't it?",
        "Steffy: No.",
        "Liam: He pushed you into it, didn't he?",
        "Steffy: No. No. Wyatt did not push me.",
        "Liam: Then why, Steffy? Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I'm glad my brother's back. He went through hell because of my mother's demented scheme.",
        "Caroline: I still cannot believe that Quinn has not been caught yet.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Let's just hope the police find her before Dad does, 'cause you know he's gonna do something about it, and it ain't gonna be pretty.",
        "Caroline: Can you blame him? Uncle Bill loves his sons, and Quinn messed with both your life and Liam's. And who knows what would have happened if she hadn't?",
        "Wyatt: You mean if Liam was married to Steffy instead of me?",
        "Caroline: No. I'm -- I am not saying that, because Liam and Steffy had their own issues before Quinn did her number on him.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Liam called it off with her. Steffy didn't want to believe it, but even if my mother hadn't have interfered, I think it was over between them for good.",
        "Caroline: Yes. And then, ultimately, Steffy would have realized and things would have turned out the way that they have anyway.",
        "Wyatt: Exactly. What's the saying -- \"What's meant to be is meant to be?\"",
        "Caroline: Yes, and you and Steffy are clearly meant to be, hence the ink.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I mean, a tattoo's for life -- just like my marriage with Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Siren wailing]",
        "Deacon: Do you hear that? Now do you believe me? Look, that cop car didn't stop, but the next one probably will. You've got one chance. Your only chance is to make a break for it, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Why? What's the point? You said Bill already found you. It's just a matter of time before he finds me, too, whether I'm here in LA or I'm halfway around the world.",
        "Deacon: So, what, you're just -- you're just gonna give up, just wait around for the inevitable?",
        "Quinn: I'm not giving up. I'm reprioritizing.",
        "Deacon: What does that mean?",
        "Quinn: I am not worried about me. I'm worried about Liam.",
        "Deacon: What?",
        "Quinn: I need to see him. I need to go to Liam tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Quinn did this to us. That...band, that wedding band, is her ultimate triumph. Only we can't let her win, Steffy. We can't let what Quinn did change our lives forever, or she wins. I mean, you can't possibly want that, right? Even Wyatt can't want that -- to win you this way? Make no mistake. He was manipulated. But we were robbed. We were stolen from. She took my future with you and handed it to her son.",
        "Steffy: [Crying]",
        "Liam: Tell me you understand that. Then -- then why? Why get a permanent wedding band after I've come home, after I'm here?",
        "Steffy: I don't know what to say to you, Liam. I don't.",
        "Liam: I don't -- say you got caught up in something, Steffy. Say -- say you settled. Say that he's not the one. Say this hurts you as much as it hurts me.",
        "Steffy: Of course, it hurts! Of course, it hurts me! Of course, it does. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to.",
        "Liam: It's not you. It's what Quinn did to us. It's what she's still doing to us. Look, I love you. I never stopped loving you. I never will stop loving you. And I can see -- your eyes are screaming -- that you love me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: It's good to see you like this. You deserve to be happy.",
        "Wyatt: Well, Steffy gets all the credit. I mean, she's everything I've ever wanted, so...",
        "Caroline: Well, you sure didn't waste any time making her yours. That's for sure.",
        "Wyatt: Well, who needs long engagements when you know, right? I mean, that's how it was with you and Ridge, wasn't it?",
        "Caroline: Oh, Lord. Our situation was a little more complicated than that. That's --",
        "Wyatt: What, more complicated than mine and Steffy's? I don't think so.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: But, hey, it makes me appreciate her and what we found together that much more.",
        "Caroline: Unfortunately... Liam has feelings for her, too.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Kind of puts you in a weird predicament, right?",
        "Caroline: I would never choose sides. But...after what Quinn put Liam through, for him to them come home to this --",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Caroline: You know, it's just -- and I love you, and I know that she's your mom, but it is my sincerest hope that when they do find Quinn, that they put her behind bars for all the heartbreak that she's caused.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: You cannot be serious!",
        "Quinn: Don't try talking me out of this.",
        "Deacon: What happens when Liam sees you? Quinn, you're the woman who stole this guy's life and did everything possible to keep him remembering who he is. To say that -- to say that he despises you is the biggest understa--",
        "Quinn: Liam doesn't despise me. He is angry at me, yes. And there are things that I need to explain to him.",
        "Deacon: Explain? Honey, you can explain from now until the end of time. It's not gonna change this guy's feelings towards you.",
        "Quinn: We'll see about that.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, the only thing that you're gonna see is the inside of a jail cell.",
        "Quinn: I'll take my chances.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, this is insane. Quinn, you're not gonna change the way Liam feels about -- Quinn, come back here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Please try to understand. I thought you were gone. Wyatt was there. He was good for me.",
        "Liam: I get that, but it doesn't matter now. Just tell me this isn't the end for us. Tell me that -- tell me that this ring doesn't mean -- that it doesn't mean what Wyatt thinks it means.",
        "Steffy: Please do not blame Wyatt.",
        "Liam: I-I'm not. But I had plans for us -- a future, a life, a family -- and you did, too, Steffy, and you still do.",
        "Steffy: I made vows.",
        "Liam: You made vows? You made vows before you knew what was really going on, before you knew what Quinn did to us! This should be my ring on your finger. That is my future with you. I just want to hear you say it. Say that you still love me. Tell me that. Say it! I want to hear the words! Say that you still love me!",
        "Steffy: Yes! Yes, I still love you! I'm always gonna love you. We're always gonna be a part of each other. [Crying] And we shared so much. We made a baby together. Those are our memories. Those are ours, and I'm never gonna forget them. But, Liam, come on. Things are the way that they are. And it's killing me that I have to do this, but... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt you. I'm sorry.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You'll get no argument from me. My mother has to pay for what she did.",
        "Caroline: I'm sure that Liam would like Quinn behind bars, like, yesterday.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Well, Liam wants something else, too. My brother and I had a little talk. Apparently, he wants to pick up right where he left off with Steffy.",
        "Caroline: Before Quinn did he thing?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Just roll back the clock and ignore the fact that he left her and that Steffy and I are now husband and wife.",
        "Caroline: Something I'm sure you reminded him of.",
        "Wyatt: Repeatedly! But whether it got through or not, I don't know.",
        "Caroline: Listen, I think that...Liam just needs a little bit of time. You know, to come back to this, all of this -- that's a lot.",
        "Wyatt: I sympathize. But to a point. Liam has a reality that he's got to face. Steffy and him have been on again and off again, like, a gazillion times over the past few years. They even tried marriage twice, and it didn't stick. Like, Liam has to just -- he's got to let her go and just let her finally have some kind of a happiness.",
        "Caroline: That's all you're about now, huh -- just making her happy?",
        "Wyatt: Absolutely.",
        "Caroline: What did Uncle Bill say? Did -- did he take a side?",
        "Wyatt: He told Liam he had to respect my marriage, something I told him many times.",
        "Caroline: And Steffy? Does she know...",
        "Wyatt: That Liam wants her back?",
        "Caroline: You just -- you haven't said where she stands with all this.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not sure. I just -- I can't wait for Steffy to come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Singer: It's unusual as we travel through life out of all these paths, you cross mine yeah, you taught me to love that we change and we grow so let's take life on a journey down a long road you never know where life will take you you never know who you might find no one said we...",
        "Liam: Is that a wedding band?",
        "Singer: ...Forever every step I see you remember even if today is just one moment in time when you were mine when you were mine",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Singer: When you were mine",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Singer: When you were mine",
        "Liam: You.",
        "Quinn: Before you call the police, I just -- I just have to talk to you. I just want you to know how sorry I am. I did things I-I shouldn't have done... and I am ready to accept the consequences, something the old Quinn would never do. Because who I am... standing here in front of you, this woman -- our time together changed me. You need to know... the impact that you had on my life. I see the world so differently now, thanks to your goodness, your kindness, and your love. And I will never be the same again... because of you, Liam."
