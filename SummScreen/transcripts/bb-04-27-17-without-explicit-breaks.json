        "RJ tells Coco that he would not be asking her this but it is so important. She would only be telling the truth. She cannot fathom seeing Sally in jail. He says he understands her position but Sally put her in this position and she needs to look out for her own self ..her future .their future. She says this might be the best for her but not for her sister. It could be the end of any relationship with her. RJ says it is her choice but Sally could get off with just money damages. And Coco could come back to FC and they could be together. Her family took advantage of her and that is not fair. She says her sister took care of her all her life and now makes one lousy mistake and it will hurt her. This is too much pressure. She wants this job, she wants RJ but she also wants her sister and she can't have it all. He convinces her that he likes her just the way she is and does not want her to change.",
        "Ridge tells Brooke that Sally stole from them and now she needs to be punished. They can do this if they have a sworn statement from the inside. She sees that is why RJ is now involved. He mentions on the one hand that he screwed up and then Spencer and she says she needs a man who will be loyal to her. Wyatt hopes Bill has not hired a private investigator. Bill says if that is the only way. There has to be a woman involved and he might use that to his advantage sometimes. They rattle off the women in Ridge's life but agree it can't be Quinn; they hate each other. Wyatt says it could be a waitress at some hotel and they may never know. He should just forget this and focus on his own life. Bill says he knows Ridge has a dark secret that he wants no one to know and Bill needs that as leverage. Wyatt advises him to leave it alone. Ridge tells Brooke that he was reckless but now that is over. Brooke agrees that she knows Quinn really loves Eric so she won't do that again. Ridge says then if she understands all of this she should forgive him and give him another chance. She thinks back to when Ridge came back home from Europe and all the good times since. He says he loves her. He is not guilty of loving Quinn; it will always be Brooke. Bill tells Wyatt that Brooke will be his the rest of his life and he will not jerk her around like that Forrester bozo. He does not know what happened between then but he intends to find out. Wyatt tries to convince him to leave this alone. Brooke wanted it that way and she does not want to drag RJ into this. Bill says he would be crazy not to drag Ridge into this; it could be useful. He goes to Brooke's and walks in on her talking to Ridge saying look at him screwing up but here he is trying to convince her to leave Bill and come back. He knows something was involved and he is going to find out what it was. Ridge tells him what happens between them is not Bill's business. Bill tells him to make no mistake .he will find out and expose Ridge."

        "R.J.: I wouldn't be asking you this if it wasn't so important.",
        "Coco: Your family has every right to be upset, but what you're asking of me, to turn on my own sister...",
        "R.J.: They just want you to be honest.",
        "Coco: But if I am, sally goes to prison.",
        "R.J.: If she's convicted, which might not even happen.",
        "Coco: Still. Just the thought, the idea of sally in a jail cell...",
        "R.J.: I put a lot in your head. Just -- just think about it.",
        "Coco: R.J., I really want to do what I can, and I want to make things right, but -- but I don't know if I can do this.",
        "Ridge: Sally spectra stole from us, and now she needs to be punished.",
        "Brooke: I agree we should file a civil suit, but 15 years in prison, that is pretty extreme.",
        "Ridge: Thank you. That's the worst case. The judge is gonna decide how long she's gonna go away and how much they're gonna pay us.",
        "Brooke: So, lieutenant baker thinks there's enough there to press charges?",
        "Ridge: If we have a sworn statement from the inside, yes.",
        "Brooke: Oh... that's why you have R.J. Speaking with coco.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, to try to convince her to cooperate.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, your girlfriend here's looking a little neglected. You haven't forgotten about her, have you?",
        "Bill: Oh, never. One day she will be mine.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, don't forget about the other woman you're engaged to.",
        "Bill: Oh, don't worry. Brooke's got me all to herself, my full attention for the rest of her life.",
        "Wyatt: Mm. Lucky girl.",
        "Bill: She deserves a man that's gonna give her 110%, not jerk her around like that Forrester bozo.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I still want to know what he did.",
        "Wyatt: You're -- you're not gonna let this go, are you, dad?",
        "Bill: Well, think about it, Wyatt! I mean, whatever happened had to be pretty significant for Brooke to call off the wedding the day before. I mean, it's got to be something bad.",
        "Wyatt: Something happened.",
        "Bill: Yeah, you bet something happened. I want to find out what the hell it is.",
        "R.J.: I understand I'm putting you in an impossible situation.",
        "Coco: I -- I wish I knew how to handle this.",
        "R.J.: I understand, okay? But your sister committed a crime, and she's in a lot of trouble. Sally put you in this position, and there's no excuse.",
        "Coco: What would you do if you were me?",
        "R.J.: It'd be tough, but I'd tell the truth. Sign the statement. As hard as it is, you need to look out for yourself. For your future. For our future. I completely trust you, coco. But my family needs to know that you're loyal, too.",
        "Bill: You know, I might have to change my nickname from dollar Bill to the great spencerini because I predicted that that boneheaded clod would trip over his own feet.",
        "Wyatt: I know you're literally salivating over this, but if Brooke told you to leave it alone, it's probably for a good reason, dad.",
        "Bill: Yeah, she doesn't want me to knock him out.",
        "Wyatt: There is that, and they share a kid together. Maybe this is to protect R.J.",
        "Bill: Come on, Wyatt. I mean, I'm not gonna slap whatever it is all over the cover of my magazines and internet sites! I know how to be discreet.",
        "Wyatt: Ha! Since when?",
        "Bill: Since... since right now, all right? I'm not gonna run with it.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Bill: For the moment.",
        "Wyatt: There he is.",
        "Bill: What? Listen, I would be crazy not to use something like this. I mean, whatever it is that ridge pulled could be very useful.",
        "Brooke: I feel bad for coco. It's obvious that her sister is using her and her position at Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Are we really surprised by that?",
        "Brooke: Nothing the Spectras do surprises me.",
        "Ridge: Still wearing that thing, huh?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Ridge: Has R.J. seen it?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Ridge: Well, he's gonna have to find out eventually that you're engaged, so...",
        "Brooke: He has his own life now. I'm sure he'll understand.",
        "Ridge: Mm. Spencer? Really?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. It's about love and respect. I deserve to be treated better, to be honored.",
        "Ridge: You do. You're right. I messed up.",
        "Brooke: I am through playing these games, ridge, but you're not. I need a man who will be loyal to me.",
        "Ridge: And -- and that man is Bill Spencer?",
        "Brooke: Yes. pressure on you 's the best thing for you,",
        "Coco: No, I don't blame you,",
        "R.J.: This is tearing you up, and I'm sorry.",
        "Coco: No, I don't blame you, R.J. You're just doing what your family asked.",
        "R.J.: As hard as it is, I think it's the right call. It's the best thing for you, coco.",
        "Coco: Yeah, for me, maybe. But not my sister, our relationship. I'm basically signing her future away. Like, if I agree, if I sign an affidavit saying that she planted cameras on me and spied on Forrester, it will ruin sally's life. Spectra will go under and it will all be over.",
        "R.J.: We don't know that. She might just owe damages, have to pay a fine.",
        "Coco: With what money? And that's best-case scenario. It could be much, much worse.",
        "R.J.: I don't want to put pressure on you either way. It's your choice to do it or not. And I'll support you no matter what, but... if you do decide to do it, I'll be sure you can come back here.",
        "Coco: Back at Forrester?",
        "R.J.: You can work here and we can be together. There's nothing I want more than to be with you.",
        "Wyatt: I hate to say it, dad, but whatever happened between ridge and Brooke, could it be because of Caroline?",
        "Bill: Way ahead of you. Already called your cousin in new York. She hasn't talked to ridge in months.",
        "Wyatt: You are deep in this.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I'm determined to find out what the hell happened.",
        "Wyatt: Please tell me you didn't hire a private investigator.",
        "Bill: Not yet.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on, dad! You got to rein it in! Don't go to that dark place!",
        "Bill: I'm not going to any dark place. This is about ridge's dark track record. There's got to be another woman. There has to be.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so, could it be a work thing? There's always a lot of models. Maybe one of them flirted with him, or something.",
        "Bill: No, this isn't some casual flirtation. This hurt Brooke to her core.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so who else works at Forrester besides Steffy, Brooke, Pam? Maya is married. Ivy, that'd be weird. Nicole is newly married. And that's pretty much it. And then there's mom, but I mean, that's, you know...",
        "Bill: Quinn. No. They hate each other.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: I don't want to talk about Bill, not with you.",
        "Ridge: We're gonna have to talk about it. You're engaged to the guy.",
        "Brooke: [Scoffs] So, Katie really is working at Forrester, huh?",
        "Ridge: Yes, she is.",
        "Brooke: Well, how does that work? Isn't Eric curious why Quinn would hire her to work side by side with her on her beloved jewelry line?",
        "Ridge: Spectra copied the collection, and ivy is in Australia, so Quinn needed some help. Makes sense.",
        "Brooke: Look, don't get me wrong. I'm excited for Katie. I think this is a wonderful opportunity for her and for the company. [Sighs] I'm just not sure how I feel about everything else.",
        "Ridge: I appreciate you not saying anything to my father.",
        "Brooke: Tell me I made the right decision.",
        "Ridge: You did. There's no reason to hurt him.",
        "Brooke: I want to believe what you and Quinn said, that nothing further will happen between the two of you.",
        "Ridge: Definitely not.",
        "Brooke: I hope you mean that. That's the only reason why I'm not saying anything. And as crazy as this sounds, I really think that Quinn loves your father, that she's good for him.",
        "Ridge: She is, and she makes him happy. He's happier than he's ever been, and it's because of Quinn. And I was reckless and foolish, and it's over.",
        "Brooke: I believe you learned your lesson, that you won't go after your father's wife.",
        "Ridge: I won't. So, let me ask you something. If you believe me, why can't you forgive me? Just forget about Bill and just give me one more chance. day. I want you to",
        "R.J.: You could have a real future at Forrester.",
        "Coco: Working here has been the best experience of my life. And meeting you, it's made it even better.",
        "R.J.: I want to see you every day. I want you to be here. And there's no reason you shouldn't be. Why should you be punished for your family's crimes? You're innocent, coco. They took advantage of you. That's not fair.",
        "Coco: You're right, it's not. It's not, and what grams and sally did was wrong. But what your family's asking me to do... R.J., I don't know if I'd be able to live with myself. Because sally's not a terrible person. Like, she -- she looked out for me my whole life. And then she makes one bad mistake, one horrible mistake...",
        "R.J.: I know, I know. Sally loves you. She's your sister. But she lied to you, coco. She betrayed you.",
        "Coco: And I don't think that I'll ever be able to forgive her for that. But the thought of her in jail... look, it's -- it's just -- it's too much. It's too much pressure. And, like, because I want this and I want this job and I want you and I want my sister and I -- I want things to be back to the way they used to be, but if I testify against her, then it's like --",
        "R.J.: It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Bill: Whatever happened between Brooke and ridge went down in Sydney.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so, who are the single women there?",
        "Bill: Ivy and Katie!",
        "Wyatt: Maybe it was Katie.",
        "Bill: Oh, no! Come on!",
        "Wyatt: She was involved with ridge, you know, at some point.",
        "Bill: They read poetry in the park, and he put a little red string on her finger. I hardly call that \"involved.\" And, besides that, Brooke and Katie are in a really good place now. Katie would never do anything to jeopardize that.",
        "Wyatt: Then maybe it was, uh, you know, someone random, like a fan or something.",
        "Bill: A fan?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: They guys makes dresses. What do you mean, a fan?",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so then maybe it was a waitress or another guest at the hotel. The point is, you'll probably never know. So it's probably best to just let it go.",
        "Bill: It could have been someone at the hotel.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you're obsessed about this. All that matters is that Brooke didn't marry ridge. And for some inexplicable reason, she agreed to marry you, and that is a good thing. You have a chance now, to get your life the way you want it. That's what important, right?",
        "Bill: I heard the \"inexplicable reason, marrying me.\" I heard that whole thing.",
        "Wyatt: I tried to roll over that.",
        "Bill: And I get it. But I've got to have an ace in the hole, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: For what, dad?",
        "Bill: Leverage! Ridge has a dark secret, something they don't want anyone to know.",
        "Wyatt: Exactly. That's my point. So drop it. You're only gonna jeopardize things with Brooke if you pursue this. I'm serious, dad! Like, take it for what it is, but... I think you should leave it alone.",
        "Ridge: Think of all we've been through, all the years we spent together. Way before Spencer was around. Our love is a story a beautiful journey destinations unknown after all of these years, the laughs and the tears it's still you and me here making destiny appear after all of these years, the laughs and the tears it's still you and me here making destiny appear mmm mmm",
        "Ridge: And I'm guilty. Guilty of having an ego. Guilty of flirting with disaster. But I'm not guilty of loving Quinn. 'Cause I don't. I love you. Only you.",
        "Coco: It feels really good to be in your arms. Just to know you don't hate me.",
        "R.J.: I never could.",
        "Coco: Just -- I feel like an enemy walking in here. Like, everyone's nice, but I just -- I see them looking at me and just wondering what I'm doing.",
        "R.J.: They don't know you like I know you.",
        "Coco: I can't change who I am or where I came from. I'm a spectra. It's a part of me, and it always will be.",
        "R.J.: Coco, I -- I don't want you to change. I like you just the way you are.",
        "Coco: You may be the only person I have after this. 'Cause grams won't talk to me. And sally...",
        "R.J.: Okay, don't do anything you're not comfortable with. I don't know what's gonna happen to sally, but whatever happens, we're gonna go through it together. It's the right thing to do. I know you know that.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Give me one more chance. Just one more. Don't marry Spencer.",
        "Bill: Well, what do we have here? Oh, I know, the biggest screw-up on the planet. And the beat goes on. I mean, look at you. You're begging my fianc\u00e9e not to marry me? Well, beg all you want, Fido. My engagement ring's on her finger.",
        "Ridge: The ugliest ring I've ever seen, by the way. No offense.",
        "Bill: None taken. I've seen your dress designs. Do you have any self-respect at all? I mean, look at you. Pleading... what did you do? I mean, what did you do? Brooke was gonna marry you one day and not the next. I find that very interesting.",
        "Ridge: It's not your concern, is it?",
        "Bill: I warned Brooke. I told her you were gonna screw her over. Hell, I told you the same thing. It must have been something huge, and I'm gonna find out what it is.",
        "Brooke: Bill, stop.",
        "Bill: He hurt you! He did something, and I'm going to expose him for it. So, how about you save us all the trouble and just tell me what you did right now?",
        "Ridge: I'm not telling you anything.",
        "Bill: Look at you. At the pinnacle of your existence, on the verge of marrying your \"destiny\"... instead, you're begging and pleading on your knees for her to take you back. She must have been horrified.",
        "Brooke: All right, that's enough. Now, I have a very important business phone call that I need to make right now. Is it okay if I leave the two of you alone together? Actually, ridge, you better just go.",
        "Bill: No, no, no. We'll be fine. Won't we, slick?",
        "Ridge: You got some nerve.",
        "Bill: Me?",
        "Ridge: What happened between Brooke and me is none of your business.",
        "Bill: None of my business? She's my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Ridge: She's your fianc\u00e9e, but you're not gonna be married to her.",
        "Bill: Listen, I'm gonna find out what you did, all right? I am going to dig and dig until I get to the bottom of it.",
        "Ridge: You want to waste your time, go ahead.",
        "Bill: Make no mistake. I will find out, and I will expose your dirty secret."
