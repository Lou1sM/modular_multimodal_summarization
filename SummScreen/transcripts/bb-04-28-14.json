        "Aly continues to tell Oliver that Taylor Hayes destroyed her family. She killed her mother then tried to steal her father away from her. She swooped in and took advantage of her dad. Her mom and dad were so in love and would still be together if it were not for Taylor. He comforts her and says it is okay. That was a long time ago and she can't do anything to hurt her any more. She's a Forrester and shouldn't have a care in the world. She reminds him that he was in love with Hope once, she doesn't compare so she doesn't get his interest in her. He tells Miss F. that she is interesting and unique, original and authentic. He's a photographer and that is what drew him to her. She tells him that she was drawn to his eyes. She can tell that he is a very good person and she can trust him. She would like to tell everyone about them. He cautions her not to. She is the boss's granddaughter, he's only an employee. What they have is special but he would hate people judging their dating. They do not need people's permission or approval. It's fun to have secrets but she is worried about that. She would not be kissing him if she were not his girlfriend so she wants to know if she is his girl friend. He kisses her. Taylor and Thorne lay in bed in Paris. She says people are going to start to talk. His employees will want to know why the boss is late to work every day. He says they will also wonder why he is smiling all the time. She says when he first came to Paris and asked her out to dinner, it turned out differently than she expected. She thought it would be all about Ridge. Now it is starting to feel like old times. She says he has changed. There is a new energy about him, a new passion. He says he is enjoying his life more and he has to give some credit to her. She goes back to things are so different now. She was responsible for Darla's death yet he has never blamed her. He says it was an accident. He had forgiven her, fell in love and they were going to be married. Taylor says that is what she wanted too but Aly was so angry. Thorne says she still is about a lot of things. Taylor says and all the more reason that they keep things quiet, very discreet and cautious. He hopes she understands. He thought with years of therapy that Aly would be better, but he's not sure she is ready to hear about this yet. Hope tells Liam before this goes any further she has to talk to Wyatt about this. If she is going to be dating both of them then he needs to know. He agrees and it needs to be done right now.",
        "Hope shows up at Wyatt's door. He welcomes her to Casa de Wyatt. He has the place all spruced up and he will pretend she didn't just say he shouldn't have. He knows she has just come from Liam's but he is only interested in what is happening right now. He kisses her. She tells him that she made a decision. Liam asked for equal time and she agreed. Wyatt says then she is dating both of them. She says yes and she wants him to be part of this, but if he can't she will understand. She rattles on and says for him to say something. He says he better not. She says they have been through a lot and this relationship is really important to her but if this is what is going to happen then things are gonna have to change. He gets the drift \u0096 no sex. Liam is a genius. She says no, they won't be having that kind of relationship either. He says things have been so good lately that he doesn't know why she is stepping away. She says she is not. She actually needs this time to move forward. She knows he is disappointed and this is hard to see. She tried not to send mixed signals and that is why she wanted to take things slow and not move in with him. But if he can't then .He says he did not say that. But does she want to talk or hear his answer. He kisses her again. Then he says that she and Liam had a few marriages and lived together. Is he going to get that too? He says he is the right guy for her and what she needs. She says she does not like this either ..having two boyfriends. She grew up seeing her mother ping pong guys around and she never thought she would be guilty of that. She admits she is in love with two men and she apologizes for that but it's the truth. He heard her say she loved him and she admits yes she said that. He says that is all he needs to hear. She promises him that this won't drag out long. He says good, meantime since is their last night maybe they should make it one to remember. They can turn off the phones, open a bottle of wine and she can stay the night with him. She sighs and says he knows she can not do that. He needs a list to know what they can do and not do. One side at a time he kisses her on the neck and she says that is ok, then the mouth, again yes. He jokes that as long as there is no chance of pregnancy then they are okay. There is still a lot of fun things they can do. She says she needs him to understand why she is doing this. This is not the ideal situation for any of them, but she is thinking about the rest of her life and she needs time. Wyatt says that is exactly what she will have to decide the rest of her life it is him, so"

        "Liam: I did know that you'd show up tonight. I did. I knew that you weren't quite ready for this to be over.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Well, it's a little different now.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Yeah. But it's a step in the right direction, even if only a half a step. At least we're moving again, you know? We just had dinner. You're -- you're actually here. You're in my arms. I mean... I don't want anything else.",
        "[Back to present]",
        "Liam: Whoops. Lost you there.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I know what you're thinking. It's over. I was a little kid. I should just get over it.",
        "Oliver: That's not what I'm thinking. [Sighs] Your mom died. You grew up without her.",
        "Aly: And the woman who killed her -- she didn't have to pay for it -- we did. My parents were so in love, Oliver, and I know that if it wasn't for Taylor, they would still be together today.",

        "Taylor: When you asked me to dinner when you first arrived in Paris...",

        "Thorne: I had fallen in love with you, Taylor. We were getting married.",

        "Thorne: Yeah. She still is...about a lot of things.",
        "Taylor: Well, that's why we decided to keep things like they are -- very quiet, discreet, cautious. I think that's the right choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I've been thinking about my mom and dad a lot lately -- how they felt about each other, how they were with each other.",
        "Oliver: Now, why would you be thinking about that?",

        "Oliver: I know. I know.",
        "Aly: I'm sorry.",
        "Oliver: Don't be. I'm glad I can be here for you. Everybody thinks you and your family don't have any problems. You're a Forrester -- you shouldn't have a care in the world.",
        "Aly: Everybody says I worry way too much, especially about Hope and her line.",
        "Oliver: You won't get a lecture from me.",
        "Aly: You were so in love with her. How can you be interested in me? I don't compare.",
        "Oliver: Miss F., you are completely interesting and unique. You're original, authentic. I'm a photographer. That's what I do for a living. I see everything that's made you who you are. That's what drew me to you.",
        "Aly: I was drawn to your eyes. They're so honest. I can tell you're a really good person, Oliver. I have a pretty strong intuition about people. I know I can trust you.",

        "Hope: I was just at Liam's.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. I figured.",
        "Hope: Aren't you curious about what happened?",

        "Wyatt: So, you're -- you're gonna date both of us?",
        "Hope: Yeah. And I really want you to be a part of this, but if you can't, then I understand.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Hope: It's... it's just that when I thought that I was pregnant, it really freaked me out, and it made me think about Liam. It made me think about everything that we planned for -- marriage, kids, and -- say something.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I-I better not.",
        "Hope: Wyatt. We have been through a lot together, and -- and this relationship is really important to me...but if this is what's gonna happen, then some things need to change.",

        "Hope: Well, no, Liam and I won't have that kind of relationship either.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I-I would hope so. Um, look, I-I -- we have been so good together lately. Why are you stepping away?",
        "Hope: I know. And I'm not. I-I'm not stepping away. In fact, I actually -- I need this time to move forward.",
        "Wyatt: Ohh.",
        "Hope: I know that's hard to see, and I know that you're disappointed. I've tried really hard to not send you mixed signals, you know? That's why I didn't want to move in. That's why I wanted to take things slow, and... if you -- if you can't do this, then...",
        "Wyatt: Did I say that?",
        "Hope: You really haven't said much of anything.",
        "Wyatt: Look... do you want to talk... or do you want my answer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: You know, as happy as I am and as amazing as this is...",
        "Taylor: You don't want to hurt your daughter. Neither do I.",
        "Thorne: You know, I thought with time and all the counseling Aly's had...",
        "Taylor: But it's helped. It's helped. She's working at Forrester. She's making contributions. She's making friends.",
        "Thorne: But she's also acting out -- I mean, the issue with Wyatt. I'm just -- I'm not sure she's ready to hear about us yet.",
        "Taylor: There's no need to tell anybody anything.",
        "Thorne: So you understand?",
        "Taylor: You're just being a good father, just like you were back then.",
        "Thorne: I wanted to marry you, Taylor. I was ready.",
        "Taylor: But Aly wasn't. It doesn't mean she isn't ever going to forgive me, but... I just don't think we should push her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I want to tell everyone how I feel about you.",
        "Oliver: Not yet. You're the boss's granddaughter. I'm just an employee.",
        "Aly: Not to me.",
        "Oliver: But you could see how that might look to people. What we have is special. I don't want people judging it, you know?",
        "Aly: Me neither.",
        "Oliver: Besides, you don't need anyone's permission or approval. You can make your own decisions. You know what feels right to you.",
        "Aly: You do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Well, you and Liam have had a few weddings. You lived together. I mean, am I gonna get that, too?",
        "Hope: Oh, God.",
        "Wyatt: I just want to know. Look, I know I'm the right guy for you. What we have is what you need.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Look, I don't like this either, okay? Two boyfriends -- it's -- you know, I've watched my mom ping-pong men around, and I-I really never thought that I would be guilty of the same thing.",
        "Wyatt: Guilt is the last thing you should be feeling right now.",
        "Hope: I'm in love with two men, Wyatt. I'm sorry, but it's the truth.",
        "Wyatt: You know what? You love me.",
        "Hope: I do.",
        "Wyatt: That's all I need to hear.",
        "Hope: I promise that I won't drag this out, okay? It won't take long. I promise.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, good. Good. But if this is gonna be our last night together for a while, maybe we should make it one to remember. Let's just shut our phones off, open a bottle of wine. Stay with me tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: See? Secrets can be fun.",
        "Aly: Is that all I am to you -- your little secret?",
        "Oliver: No.",
        "Aly: Good, because I wouldn't be kissing you like this unless...",
        "Oliver: Unless -- unless what?",
        "Aly: Unless...you were my boyfriend. Are you my boyfriend, Oliver?",
        "Oliver: I certainly hope so, Miss F.",
        "Aly: I -- [Clears throat] I should get home.",
        "Oliver: You -- [Chuckles] You're just gonna leave me here all alone?",
        "Aly: Mm, Grandpa will wonder where I am. Besides, I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.",
        "Oliver: Sweet dreams.",

        "Hope: [Sighs] I can't spend the night with you.",
        "Wyatt: What -- that -- that's not allowed anymore?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so then let's make a list so I can be clear, then.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Can I do this?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: How about this?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Yes, that's fine.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: So as long as there's no risk of pregnancy, we're good -- that's the line? Oh, there's a lot we can do. There is a lot of fun that we can have.",
        "Hope: Oh, Wyatt. [Chuckles] I need you to understand why I'm doing this.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: I-I know that it's not an ideal situation for any of us, but I'm thinking about the rest of my life. I just need some time.",
        "Wyatt: And that's what you'll have -- the time to decide what you need for the rest of your life. And it's me, so..."
