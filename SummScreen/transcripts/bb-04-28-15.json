    ],
    "Recap": [
        "Pam is aghast but Charlie keeps repeating if those are Maya's pill then she is a transgender. Pam thinks that is ridiculous just because Charlie saw something similar on TV. There are other reasons a woman could be taking estrogen pills. Maya tells Nicole that she is not ashamed of who she is and if and when Rick proposes she will tell him her secret. Nicole is not so sure now that is a good idea. Rick tells Wyatt that it is like he does not know Maya at all. The jewelry Wyatt is proposing has too small gems and they need to be bigger, so start over. Bill and Liam discuss Wyatt taking Nicole on the plane and they needed to be alone but it did not work the way he expected. Wyatt finds Nicole and emphasizes again they had a good time last night. Maya says she has heard and she wonders if that is all they were doing and what his intentions are. Charlie and Pam are still arguing over the pills when Rick comes in and asks why they are in his office and arguing. They are busted but talk their way out of it and consider themselves lucky to get out of there. Bill tells Liam they need information so if Nicole told Wyatt anything about Rick they need to know. Liam says it is more like something with Maya, not Rick.",
        "Wyatt tells Maya he knows this has sort of come out of left field but that is the way it is. Nicole surprises him and he needs that in his life right now. He can not know where this is going right now but he's willing to find out. Maya tells Nicole that she can not compare her relationship with Rick with Nicole's with Wyatt. Nicole says it is what it is and right now it is awesome. Wyatt tells Maya that he does not like to play games or keep secrets and they agreed to be totally honest with each other as that always leads to trouble to keep secrets. Liam says he is disappointed as he thought Nicole knew something. But Wyatt dropped it when he heard it was not about Rick but about Maya. Bill is not surprised as he was suspicious about Maya from the start so Rick probably knows what it is and they need to find it. Pam tells Charlie to drop this right now. Maya is not transgender. She will not hear any more about it. She tells Charlie they can not follow this trail as they could lose their jobs. Charlie says no one has to know it was them. Pam says it just is not right and she won't do it. Rick would never forgive them as he loves Maya so much. Maya tells Rick that Charlie gave her a funny look so what is up about that. Rick shows her the sales reports and she says if he keeps this up his father may make him CEO as a permanent arrangement. He thinks that too and says he meant what he told his family the other day that Maya is the reason behind all of it, his strength. He hates to keep bringing up his past but the scandal with his mother over and over that made him a control freak. But he learned from her that not every relationship in this world has to end like Amber and Caroline. He loves Maya and he knows that she is wondering where their future is going. And he still does see them as a couple with wedding bells and kids, lots of kids. She would make a wonderful mother. She flinches and almost cries while saying she has never felt love like this before and she has so much faith in the two of them and does not want that to change. He tells her his love will never change and whatever it is she can tell him anything. Liam tells Bill that they are not giving up but he is afraid it is not that important or what they want. Wyatt joins in and tells them he just saw Maya and Nicole and Maya in particular was very uncomfortable when he mentioned family secrets."

        "Pam: Charlie! That is not funny.",
        "Charlie: Who's joking?",
        "Pam: Well, then you're insane.",
        "Charlie: Did -- did -- did those pills fall out of Maya's purse? Is her name on the label?",
        "Pam: Well, yes, but --",
        "Charlie: Maya is taking estrogen.",
        "Pam: So?! That does not mean that she's --",
        "Charlie: Maya is transgender.",
        "Pam: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Don't tell Rick?",
        "Nicole: He hasn't told you every little detail about his past.",
        "Maya: If Rick wants to get married and have children, he has to know.",
        "Nicole: No, he has to know that you can't get pregnant. He doesn't need to know why.",
        "Maya: I won't lie to him, Nicole. I'm not ashamed of who I am. I will tell Rick if and when he proposes.",
        "Nicole: See... I'm just not sure that's such a good idea anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So, the focus of the collection will be on Maya?",
        "Wyatt: Well, yeah. She's the inspiration -- her grace, her femininity. And the materials we're using are very delicate and refined. To increase quality, there had to be a slight adjustment in size.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Well, the gemstones are rather small. You just told me Maya's the focus of the collection, yet now you're telling me it's cheap.",
        "Wyatt: Cheap -- these are the highest-quality stones that we've ever used, Rick.",
        "Rick: Well, who cares if you can't see them? Start over.",
        "Wyatt: I -- start over?!",
        "Rick: It's no good. That's what I'm saying. It's not Maya. Maya is this powerful woman. She's not afraid to put herself out there. It's like you don't know her at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Well, Nicole was impressed.",
        "Bill: You think? He took her to dinner on a private plane.",
        "Liam: I know, and because of it, she started to open up to him.",
        "Katie: So, is Wyatt just using Nicole or what?",
        "Liam: No, I don't think so. I think he's into her. It's just with a secret of this magnitude, she's not gonna run her mouth with a bunch of people around. They needed to be alone.",
        "Bill: Well, did she talk?",
        "Liam: She did.",
        "Bill: Then it worked.",
        "Liam: Not the way we expected.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You have been on me to be honest with Rick, and how you don't want me to tell him at all?",
        "Nicole: Oh. There you are.",
        "Wyatt: Hi.",
        "Nicole: I've been looking for you.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. I had to give the keys back to my dad for the jet. [Clears throat] Hi, Maya.",
        "Maya: Someone's in a good mood.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Nicole and I had a good time last night.",
        "Maya: She said that, too.",
        "Wyatt: Oh.",
        "Maya: I guess I'm just wondering if that's all it is to you. Or is there something more going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Maya has been keeping a secret.",
        "Pam: Well, this is not it.",
        "Charlie: Pammy, Pammy, Pammy, this is the real deal. I've been watching this show that describes exactly what we've been talking about.",
        "Pam: You saw something on TV and that's why you think you know what these pills are for?",
        "Charlie: They're female hormones because Maya wasn't born with any.",
        "Pam: There's dozens of reasons that women could take estrogen!",
        "Charlie: Oh, really? Really? Name one she'd want to hide.",
        "Pam: No, because you're wrong, Charlie. She is a she. Don't look at me like that. Charlie, you can't just say things like this. It's not only ridiculous, it's dangerous!",
        "Rick: What's dangerous? What are you two up to?",
        "Charlie: Yes, security is a very dangerous job. In fact, it is so dangerous that Pam doesn't even like me to talk about how dangerous it is.",
        "Rick: Uh-huh.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. It's -- it's -- it's so dangerous that even to mention it can be very dangerous.",
        "Rick: Yeah. You do seem a little bit nervous, Pam.",
        "Pam: I do?",
        "Rick: What are you two up to? What are you doing in here?",
        "Pam: Well, you see, I thought that I heard a noise in here, so I asked Charlie if he'd just come and check it for me.",
        "Rick: What kind of noise?",
        "Pam: Thumping.",
        "Charlie: Squeaking.",
        "Pam: Well, you know, a squeaking and a thumping.",
        "Rick: You know I'm not buying this, right?",
        "Charlie: [Laughs] Okay. Okay. Good. You got us. We're busted.",
        "Pam: Charlie!",
        "Charlie: P-Pam is -- she's not -- she's not worried. She's mad at me. She's mad at me for dragging her in here for a little, uh, privacy, if you get my drift.",
        "Pam: Oh, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. See? See? See? Don't let her fool you. She only pretends to worry about the danger. The fact is she thrives on it. I mean, where's the fun if you can't get caught, right?",
        "Rick: Really?",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah, yeah. Pam -- Pam -- Pam -- Pammy is my real nymph-- adrenaline junkie.",
        "Pam: Charlie. Well, busted. That's me -- just a junkie.",
        "Charlie: Aha!",
        "Rick: Come on, now. That's just too much information.",
        "Pam: Okay. Let's go, Charlie.",
        "Rick: Is that Maya's purse? I hope she didn't need it.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, it didn't go as planned?",
        "Liam: Not quite. I-I mean, Nicole was relaxed. They we talking. Wyatt brought up family secrets, and then she sort of took it from there.",
        "Katie: Oh! So, he didn't even have to draw her out?",
        "Liam: No, because they agreed to be \"perfectly honest with each other.\"",
        "Bill: So, she did tell him!",
        "Katie: What, it just wasn't as bad as you thought it was gonna be?",
        "Liam: No. I don't know how bad it is. I'm just saying I don't think it's gonna be particularly helpful.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about?! We need information. If she gave Wyatt anything, it's something that we could potentially use to oust Rick as C.E.O.",
        "Liam: I know. Nicole admitted there is a secret, but it's not Rick's. It's Maya's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] Ignore her, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: You told Maya about her date?",
        "Nicole: I didn't tell her all the details.",
        "Maya: I'd like to know why.",
        "Nicole: Um, that judgmental look on your face. Look, you were the one who told me to have fun.",
        "Maya: You flew her to San Francisco for dinner?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, that was the plan, yeah.",
        "Nicole: We never made it.",
        "Maya: What happened?",
        "Nicole: I was having too much fun up there -- didn't want to come back down. Maya doesn't approve.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Maya: I think you're moving too fast.",
        "Wyatt: I got to be honest with you. My head is spinning a little bit from this, too, but that's part of what makes being with Nicole so exciting.",
        "Maya: So, you're a couple? You're dating?",
        "Nicole: Are you trying to scare him away?",
        "Maya: This is what you asked for when you said I should be a big sister to you.",
        "Wyatt: Look, I know this came out of left field, but that's kind of how it is when people meet and click. It doesn't have to get complicated.",
        "Maya: So, this is just a fling?",
        "Wyatt: No. No. No. I like your sister. I like spending time with her. She surprises me. And I kind of need that in my life right now -- that energy and that fun. But if you're asking me to tell you where I think this is going, I'm sorry, but I can't, 'cause I don't know. But, um... can't wait to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You are saying this isn't serious.",
        "Nicole: He's saying he doesn't know yet.",
        "Maya: Just don't get physical.",
        "Nicole: You're living with Rick, and he's not even divorced yet.",
        "Maya: You cannot compare my relationship with Rick to what you're doing with Wyatt.",
        "Nicole: I just think it's funny -- you telling me to slow down.",
        "Wyatt: It's good advice when you don't know where you stand with someone, but Nicole and I have agreed to be totally honest with each other, which you should appreciate, 'cause you're always talking about honesty and keeping it real, right?",
        "Nicole: And that's what we're doing. It is what it is. And right now, it is awesome.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Maya, I don't believe in playing games or holding back, and I really don't like secrets.",
        "Maya: Is that something the two of you talked about?",
        "Wyatt: We agreed not to hide anything -- just to be totally open and honest with each other. And I don't know about you, but in my experience, keeping secrets leads to trouble. Wouldn't you agree?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Maya's the one hiding something, not Rick.",
        "Bill: Well, what is it, Liam? I mean, any piece of information, no matter how innocuous it may seem, could be useful.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but if it's something personal about Maya, how is that gonna be useful to us?",
        "Liam: Yeah. I'm really disappointed, 'cause I thought we were on to something.",
        "Bill: We know they're hiding something. Nicole knows what it is.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, she didn't give any details and Wyatt didn't ask, 'cause the minute he found out it had nothing to do with Rick, he dropped the subject altogether.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Bill: One setback and he chucks the whole plan?!",
        "Liam: The plan was to get leverage on Rick. This -- this is -- this is like gossip between two sisters being blown out of proportion.",
        "Bill: The goal is to oust Rick as C.E.O. Look, I'm not exactly surprised that Maya's hiding something. I had that gold digger pegged the first time I laid eyes on her, and that was reinforced when I saw the portrait hanging above the Forrester fireplace.",
        "Liam: Oh, okay. Say what you want, but Maya's a whole lot closer to getting Rick than we are.",
        "Bill: Because she hasn't given up. You think Rick knows what it is?",
        "Liam: I don't know. I don't know what Rick knows because I don't know what she could possibly be hiding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Don't say it, Charlie. Drop it right now. Maya...is not...transgender. I don't want to hear another thing about it!",
        "Maya: Pam and Charlie gave me the weirdest look when I came in just now.",
        "Rick: I caught them in my office.",
        "Maya: What were they doing?",
        "Rick: I don't want to know.",
        "Maya: Ohhh! [Laughs] What has gotten in to everyone?!",
        "Rick: I don't know what's gotten in to them, but success has definitely had its effect on me.",
        "Maya: Wow! Does this mean the latest reports are in?",
        "Rick: Even better than I predicted.",
        "Maya: [Gasps] Rick, you keep this up, and your father might make this a permanent arrangement.",
        "Rick: I was thinking the same thing.",
        "Maya: [Exhales sharply]",
        "Rick: And I meant what I said to my parents earlier... about us, about what you've done for me. I mean, looking back... my life was always filled with so much scandal and deception and tabloid headlines. I spent all my energy just trying to find my balance, just getting caught up in one storm after the next. But I finally found my stability. And I owe a lot of that to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: We're not giving up. It just seems a lot less likely that this the secret is gonna help.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, good. You're all here.",
        "Bill: Liam was just filling us in about Nicole.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, yeah. I definitely think we should stay on this.",
        "Liam: Why? Did she tell you something else?",
        "Wyatt: No, but I was just with Maya and Nicole, and I thought I'd throw a rock into the pond to see what kind of ripples came up, you know? And, man, did I get a reaction.",
        "Katie: From whom?",
        "Wyatt: Both of them. You should have seen the way the were looking at each other.",
        "Liam: Well, what did you say?",
        "Wyatt: Well, I started talking about secrets, just in general, you know, and then Maya and Nicole got really uncomfortable -- Maya especially.",
        "Bill: Well, Nicole already told you Maya's hiding something.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but when I first read her, I didn't think anything of it -- you know, that it was just sister drama. But now...I think it could be as big as they were saying.",
        "Bill: Something that could affect the company?",
        "Wyatt: There's only one way to find out.",
        "Katie: What if it's just personal? What if it has nothing to do with Forrester?",
        "Wyatt: But what if it isn't?",
        "Liam: No, no, no. No, he's right. We need to stay on this. We have to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: As far as I'm concerned, this case is almost solved. We know what Maya's secret is.",
        "Pam: No, Charlie. We don't.",
        "Charlie: All we got to do is get a look at that pill bottle, get the name of the doctor --",
        "Pam: No! We will do no such thing. We are gonna act like we never saw those pills. Do you understand me? Charlie, we could lose our jobs. If it ever got back to Rick that you started a rumor like that, you would never work in security again. You know how vindictive he can be.",
        "Charlie: It was your idea to look at the purse!",
        "Pam: Well, that's what I get for snooping, then! I just can't help myself. I'm like an addict.",
        "Charlie: Look, look, look -- nobody has to know it was us. We can send an anonymous note to Wyatt.",
        "Pam: No. No. No.",
        "Charlie: I thought you wanted to help.",
        "Pam: Rick has made a lot of mistakes, and his attitude is awful. But he cares about Maya. Using something like this to hurt them -- Charlie, it just isn't right. I won't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You give me too much credit.",
        "Rick: I'm not.",
        "Maya: You always knew you could do this.",
        "Rick: With the right support.",
        "Maya: From your father.",
        "Rick: And you. Maya, you coming back into my life has changed everything for me.",
        "Maya: I feel the same way.",
        "Rick: You know I don't like talking about my past.",
        "Maya: It's painful.",
        "Rick: But it's also the reason I appreciate you so much. Growing up the way I did, my mother's scandals... [Sighs] The laughter and the whispers -- it was just all so humiliating for a boy, for her son. I mean, the shame of it all was just so terrible. It was a horrible feeling, and it made me angry. And it made me a control freak. I never had a sense of inner peace. I thought that maybe I could achieve that with Amber or Caroline, but... I was wrong. In fact, the entire idea of trusting somebody in a relationship seemed nearly impossible until I met you... because you taught me that there are still honest people out there in the world and that not every relationship is a risk. You embody everything that the Forrester name stands for. I love you, Maya.",
        "Maya: I love you, too.",
        "Rick: I know that you're wondering about the future or where we're going. And even though I'm still technically married to Caroline... I still see a future with us, sharing my life with you -- the business and having kids -- heck, having a lot of kids! You'd be a wonderful mother.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles softly]",
        "Rick: What? What is it? That's what you want, isn't it?",
        "Maya: It is.",
        "Rick: Then what's wrong?",
        "Maya: [Crying] Boy, when you say these things... it overwhelms me.",
        "Rick: That's good, right?",
        "Maya: Yeah. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: You're still happy?",
        "Maya: Oh, I am happy, Rick. I am happier than I ever imagined I could be. And I want to share everything with you, too. I do. But before we do that, I have to tell you something. I've never felt love like this before, and it amazes me, and I have so much faith in it, in us, and what we mean to each other, and I just don't want that to ever change. [Crying continues]",
        "Rick: Hey... it won't. And, Maya, just know that whatever it is... you can always tell me anything."
