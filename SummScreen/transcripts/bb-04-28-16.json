        "Liam tries to shut the door in Quinn's face but she blocks it. He tells her she ruined his life so he has nothing to say to her. Bill walks on into Wyatt's house who asks him to please knock next time. Bill says he is not much of a knocker. And he remarks to Wyatt that is a nice piece of art on his finger. Liam is determined not to give up but get Steffy back so Wyatt may want to rethink that he is not worried. Ridge finds Steffy at the office and wonders whys she is not home. She admits she probably made a mistake. She made a commitment to Wyatt but admits she loves Liam too. Quinn comes on in as Liam drinks. She says she was wrong to keep him away from Steffy and only to herself. She knew he would not forget Steffy even if he could not remember her. He gets angry while drinking and starts trashing the place \u0096 the candles, the flowers, the champagne, all things he did for Steffy but what was she doing .off getting a tattoo ring from Quinn's son, Wyatt. So it does not matter that he is still in love with Steffy. She is not coming back to him. Wyatt tells Bill that he is not naive, so Bill does not have to warn him about Liam. But Steffy is his wife now. Steffy says Quinn wanted her and Wyatt to be together so they will never know if it would have worked with Liam. Part of her wants to go back to Wyatt but part of her needs to go back to her ex. Every time she sees Liam she wants to help him and make it easier on him. There was something that broke down inside of him when she showed her the tattoo ring. She is afraid he will break down and do something. Liam tells Quinn that he knows exactly how all of this happened. Quinn did this to him. She says she is sorry, she only wanted to help and she is already paying for it. He says this is exactly what she wanted. She says she thought if Wyatt was happy it would all be worth it, but she is different now. None of it was an act, they were in love and it kills her to see him hurt this way. She begs if they can just get away tonight and all this unhappiness. She cares about him so much and Steffy is gone and it is all her fault but she will give her life for him, anything he wants, she just wants him to look at her like he did as Adam. Please give her another chance. She knows they can be happy. Bill tells Wyatt that the tattoo is not a commitment. It is strictly a symbol that might keep him happy for now but not forever. And his mamma is in cuckoo land and he will not stop until he finds her. Bill tells him he will look out for Quinn and Liam so Wyatt just needs to be there for Steffy wherever she is. Wyatt says he does not have to keep tabs on Steffy. But Bill insists so he calls her. She says she is at the office but she did stop and see Liam and showed him her tattoo. She will be home soon.",
        "Steffy repeats to her dad again that she saw the pain in Liam's eyes and she just wants to help him. He says she can't. She married Wyatt because she loved him so Liam will have to get over this on his own. Just keep her promise. She says yes she respects Wyatt and her vows but she knows none of this would have happened if it were not for Quinn. But she saw the pain and she is afraid she might have pushed him too far. Liam tells Quinn that every word that comes out of her life is a lie. He remembers much of his past now and he would go nowhere with her. Quinn says she came here tonight to make it all right. He can send her to prison if that is what he wants to do. That is how much she has changed. That woman in the cabin was the best part of her. She has walked thru this world with this coat of armor but he erased that. She asks if they can start over. He has no one now and she has no one. She begs ..another chance. She loves him. He says that is funny, she loves him but he hates her. She says she can spend the rest of her life in prison but she will always love him. He grabs her by the throat and throws her up against the wall but restrains himself from going further and tells her to go. He takes a good long look into the mirror."

        "Ridge: What am I doing in my own office? I thought maybe I'd get some work done. You know, a little peace and quiet. What about you? I thought you'd be home with your new husband. Oh, no. What is it?",
        "Steffy: I think I made a terrible mistake. I went to see Liam, and... he saw this. [Sighs]",

        "Bill: Everybody decent? Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Don't you knock? There's newlyweds that live here now.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I don't really knock, you know? I'm not much of a knocker, especially when I own the house.",
        "Wyatt: True.",
        "Bill: Anyway, I didn't see Steffy's car out front.",
        "Wyatt: Well, if you'd gotten here a few minutes earlier, you would have seen Caroline's.",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah? Was she bringing you a, uh, wedding gift?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and checking up on me.",
        "Bill: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: It's funny. Liam's back, and then all everybody wants to do is ask me how I'm doing.",
        "Bill: How are you doing, Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: I'm great. Amazing, actually.",
        "Bill: Why's that?",
        "Wyatt: Because I got this. Today. [Clears throat] Aah! Ow.",
        "Bill: Well, that's a, uh, nice piece of art, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Steffy's got one just like it.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. And you're telling me that so I don't worry?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, there's nothing to worry about, Dad.",
        "Bill: Your brother isn't giving up, Wyatt. He's determined to get Steffy back.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: You say there's nothing to worry about. Are you sure about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: The tattoo artist had an opening, so we took it.",
        "Ridge: You took it and you -- you did that. And then you went to see Liam?",
        "Steffy: No, no. He -- he called before I left the house. He said that he wanted to see me, so I told him that I would stop by. It was really beautiful. There was dinner and there was candles and it was just --",
        "Ridge: Okay. But he didn't know about the tattoo.",
        "Steffy: No. No, he saw it, and I tried to explain it to him, but --",
        "Ridge: But he did know that you're married to Wyatt.",
        "Steffy: I don't know. I-I -- [Sighs] He thought that he could change my mind. What am I supposed to do? I'm married to Wyatt. I made a commitment to him.",
        "Ridge: Yes, and you love him. But you love Liam, too, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: This is a bad time.",
        "Liam: Oh, no. You're not leaving.",
        "Quinn: What I did to you was wrong. Keeping you to myself, keeping you away from Steffy -- I should have known that it was never gonna work. You -- you never stopped loving her, even when you couldn't remember her.",
        "Liam: That doesn't really matter now.",
        "Quinn: What do you mean?",
        "Liam: You see this? You see that? What about that? You see that? You see this right here? You see that? I planned this for her! And do you want to know what Steffy was doing while I was putting all this together, lighting the candles, setting the table, chilling the champagne? You want to know what she was doing, Quinn? She was out getting a permanent wedding-band tattoo with your son. So, no, it doesn't really matter if I love her, 'cause she's not coming back to me. It doesn't matter. After all -- look, this is -- this is what she did to show her commitment is permanent!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You don't have to warn me about Liam, Dad. I'm not naive. I know Steffy still cares about him, and I do, too. But Steffy is my wife. For good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Maybe Liam's right. If Quinn hadn't kidnapped him, Wyatt and I -- we probably wouldn't have been together.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I-I think Liam probably has a point, but he also doesn't remember how things were between the two of you when he disappeared.",
        "Steffy: I know he loved me and I know he never stopped.",
        "Ridge: All right. And maybe you guys could have worked things out. Maybe not. Who knows?",
        "Steffy: Now I'll never know. And it's because of Quinn. She wanted Wyatt and me to be together, and it worked. And, look, there's a part of me that wants to go back to my husband. But there's this other part of me that just wants to run back to Liam, say I'm sorry, and just pick up where we left off. And I would never tell that to Wyatt, but it's just how I feel.",
        "Ridge: I understand that.",
        "Steffy: I just can't be thinking like this. I can't be thinking like -- I'm married. I'm married, and I'm thinking about my ex. Like, I shouldn't be --",
        "Ridge: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't be so hard on yourself. It's a new thing. You got to adjust to it.",
        "Steffy: I think I'm making it worse. Every time I see Liam, I just want to help him. Maybe if I say the right thing, maybe I can make things easier for him.",
        "Ridge: There's no right thing to say. It's never gonna be easy. He's going through a lot. It's a lot.",
        "Steffy: Yeah? What if it's too much? With me, with Quinn, with Wyatt -- what if he can't handle it?",
        "Ridge: What does that mean? Did he do something, say something, or...?",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. It's just I've never seen him like that before.",
        "Ridge: Seen him like what?",
        "Steffy: There's was just som-- Dad, there was just something in his eyes when I showed him this. When I showed him this tattoo, it was like something broke down inside of him. He was hurt and he was angry and... I'm just scared he's gonna do something crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Steffy knew I wanted to see her. All she had to do was hear me out. But instead, no, she went and made it permanent and then came here to explain it to me, you know, to make me -- make me understand. But I do understand. I know exactly how all this happened. You did this to me.",
        "Quinn: I'm so sorry. It was never my intention to hurt you. I-I was -- I was only trying to help.",
        "Liam: Oh, I know. And you're gonna pay for it.",
        "Quinn: I already am. The way you're looking at me, hearing the hate in your voice --",
        "Liam: This was your plan, Quinn! To keep me away so Wyatt could seduce Steffy, kind of like how you seduced me. This is exactly what you wanted, isn't it? Isn't this exactly what you wanted?!",
        "Quinn: I thought I could live with it. I did. I-I thought that -- that maybe, if Wyatt was happy and settled, that -- that it would all be worth it. But -- but I'm not that woman anymore. I'm different. Our time together changed me.",
        "Liam: Oh, ridiculous!",
        "Quinn: It -- it was real!",
        "Liam: Ridi--",
        "Quinn: Liam. It wasn't an act. We were in love. [Voice breaking] I miss you. I miss you, and...it kills me to see you hurting this way. I-I came here -- I came here to make things right. But what if we just ran away together, you know? You and me, tonight, and we got away from all of this unhappiness. I've never felt this way about anybody. I care about you. Oh, God. I care about you so much. And Steffy's gone. And it's all my fault, but -- but I can make it up to you. I can. I will give my life for you. I will do anything that -- that you say. I need your goodness in my life. I-I need you to -- to look at me the way you did when -- when it was just the two of us, so, please, please, Liam. Please give me another chance. I won't screw it up this time, I promise you. Please. We could be happy together. I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: A tattoo isn't a commitment, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Of course it is. It's my commitment to never taking it off.",
        "Bill: No. It's a symbol. It's a very nice symbol. But it isn't going to keep your wife happy, and it isn't going to solve every problem you ever have. That's up to you, doing the work, a lot of work, every day. That's a commitment.",
        "Wyatt: Wait, is my old man giving me advice right now?",
        "Bill: Well, who else is gonna do it? I mean, even if, uh, your mother didn't book out of here, what does she know about relationships? I mean, every one she's had is in, uh -- in cuckoo land.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, don't even remind me. I may never get over all of the things she said about Liam that day I walked in on them. Or what I saw. Seriously? I got to clean that up now.",
        "Bill: Can you imagine what he went through?",
        "Wyatt: You have no idea where she is right now, really?",
        "Bill: Not yet. But I will not stop until I find her.",
        "Wyatt: I honestly thought she was doing better, you know? She had this new guy in her life. She had a new attitude, new clothes. It was great. She even seemed happy.",
        "Bill: She has her own special brand of crazy, Wyatt. You can't blame yourself.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but it's hard not to, the way everything turned out.",
        "Bill: All right. Listen to me. I will worry about Liam and your mother. You just focus on Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Where is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Liam was completely torn up when he saw the tattoo.",
        "Ridge: You didn't think he was gonna be upset by it?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Upset, yes. It's just the way he reacted -- it was just like -- there was something in his eyes. I could just see the pain. I want to help him.",
        "Ridge: I know you do. And I'm sorry. Come here.",
        "Steffy: But there's nothing I can say, Dad. There's nothing I can...",
        "Ridge: No, there's not. There's nothing you can say. 'Cause Liam has got to go through this in his own time. It's gonna take whatever time it's gonna take. And even if you could help, you can't because you made a commitment to someone else. You married Wyatt because you love the man. And you meant your vows, right? Okay. Now, if you get overwhelmed or something just gets too much, I don't know, think about the promise you made.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah. I get what you're saying. And I do respect my marriage. I respect Wyatt and my vows, but [Sighs] I just keep thinking that none of this would have happened if it hadn't been for Quinn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: We were happy, Liam. And we could be again.",
        "Liam: It wasn't real. Every word out of your mouth was a lie.",
        "Quinn: No. It wasn't a lie. Everything I told you about my mother, about my feelings -- it was all real. I opened up to you.",
        "Liam: You opened up to me? You manipulated me! But it's not gonna work this time. Because I got my memory back, baby. I know who I am.",
        "Quinn: This isn't who you are -- this angry, bitter man Hell-bent on revenge.",
        "Liam: Oh, shut up! Shut up!",
        "Quinn: We were good together, and we could be again if we could just get away from all of this.",
        "Liam: Why would I go anywhere with you?",
        "Quinn: 'Cause there's nothing left for you here. Steffy is gone. She -- she didn't give you the benefit of the doubt, but I am. I came here tonight to -- to make this all right. Because I couldn't go on [Voice breaking] Knowing how much I hurt you and then just -- just disappear! And you can send me to prison if that's what you need to do, if that will prove to you how much I've changed. But that woman in the cabin -- she was real. She was the best part of me. You uncovered the best part of me. She was kinder and gentler than I have ever allowed myself to ever be. 'Cause I have walked through this world with this -- with this coat of armor on, but you -- you uncovered it with your goodness and your gentleness. [Crying] And I need you. I need you to look at me the way you used to look at me when it was -- when it was just the two of us. Please. Why can't we start over? 'Cause you have no one. I have no one. Please. Please give me another chance, Liam. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I don't have to keep tabs on Steffy, Dad.",
        "Bill: You don't know where she is.",
        "Wyatt: No. But I'm sure she'll be home soon.",
        "Bill: Did you expect her by now?",
        "Wyatt: She got hung up with something.",
        "Bill: Well, maybe you want to give her a call.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. Like, you -- you -- you are -- you're full of advice tonight. You know that? Really.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I just hate this feeling. I have so many questions.",
        "Ridge: And I'm sorry I can't give you the answers you want.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, uh, [Clears throat] Where are you? I'm at the house waiting for you.",
        "Steffy: I'm sorry. I-I stopped by Liam's. I-I showed him the tattoo. He's in pretty bad shape.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, are you with him right now?",
        "Steffy: No, no. I'm at the office with my dad.",
        "Wyatt: You okay?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I'll, uh -- I'll be home soon.",
        "Wyatt: All right. Well, be safe.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Wyatt: She's at work with her dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Wyatt's waiting for you.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Are you going home?",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm. Soon. I just can't shake this feeling, Dad. What if I pushed Liam too far? I'm just worried about what he might do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You love me?",
        "Quinn: I know I'm not worthy, but if you would just consider giving me a chance --",
        "Liam: You love me? I hate you. I hate you!",
        "Quinn: I understand. You're going to press charges. You're gonna -- you're gonna send me to prison. It's okay. [Sniffles] It's okay. Just -- you just need to know that it doesn't change anything. 'Cause you're the love of my life. And if I spend the rest of that life in prison, I'm going to think about you every minute. Give me another chance.",
        "Liam: Don't touch me!",
        "Quinn: Please.",
        "Liam: Don't touch me.",
        "Quinn: Liam, please, please, listen to me. You told me I was kind. You told me I was beautiful. Please!",
        "Liam: Go. Before... go.",
