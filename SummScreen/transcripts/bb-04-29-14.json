        "Hope stops by early at Liam's. He wanted to call her last night but restrained himself. Now he'd like to know how Wyatt took the news that she was dating both of them. He is sure that he didn't just roll over and accept this well. He knows that is what she needs. She just hopes Wyatt knows that too. And Wyatt knows there are ground rules and Liam is sure that didn't sit well with him with no sex. He kisses her and says she needs this time so she can figure out which one she can marry and start a family with. He quips maybe he will even buy his own RV, twice as big as Wyatt's. She says this is not a competition; just trying to figure out what she is going to do with her life. She tells Liam that she really cares for him, but she also cares for Wyatt too. She thinks he's hurting a lot more than he let on last night. Wyatt's looking at pix of Hope when his mother walks in and senses something is wrong and asks if it is Hope. In frustration he tells his mom that he was too complacent. He was too sure of himself to think that Liam would get inside her head. But that is exactly what he did with this whole pregnancy scare. And Quinn adds and now issuing ultimatums like the spoiled little brat that he is. Wyatt says she was right, they have a lot of history, proposals, engagements, almost weddings all which ended in Hope having her heart broken. Quinn knows he would never cause her that kind of pain. Finally she says he is beginning to think that Hope doesn't deserve him. He asks her to never say that again. He admits that Hope said she loved both he and Liam. Quinn can't believe this is the way she is going to decide which brother she wants. Wyatt says well it's true. She has to decide which of them she wants to have a kid with she has to decide on her own. If only her pregnancy test had come back positive, then the fate would be sealed. Quinn is concerned where this leaves Wyatt now or even their business if Liam should guilt Hope into coming back to him. Wyatt barks at her only one crisis at a time. She's glad he is admitting it finally that it is a crisis. He admits it is not the best case scenario. She says it is all Bill's fault. He spoiled that wimpy little wuss rotten. Wyatt says at least he is not taking sides. Quinn says as far as he knows. He might be giving his #1 son all his fatherly advice. Wyatt says he is not a kid anymore, he doesn't need for Bill to come rescue him any more than he needs Quinn to. He says yes his relationship with Hope has taken a hit but he still thinks he is the best person for her. She says of course he is. He is a true Spencer, strong willed and a fighter. She promises him that he will have the life he deserves.",
        "Brooke wakes up to a whinny sound that Bill has put on her phone .a new alarm clock. He asks if she wants to horse around bad pun. She'll settle for a kiss instead. Then he proposes that he can make breakfast in bed for her so she can stay just as she is. She pulls out the papers and looks them over. Bill tells her that it isn't fair that Katie is holding his company and his son as hostage. There are other ways to beat this and he thinks he may have to start his own company like his father did from the ground up. She says yes but can he have the same passion as he does for Spencer. It is practically in his DNA. She looks again toward the papers in her purse. Liam suggests that he and Hope could go sailing in this pretty weather. She assures him she will not drag this out. She is going to make a decision. She loves both of them and she could see herself in the future with either of them. But what she can't do is allow certain circumstances to make that decision for her. The decision is going to be right for her. He grabs her and says he knows how it is going to turn out ..she and him crazy in love. Quinn finds her way to Brooke's bedroom after she leaves for work. Bill is outraged that the maid would let her up. She says Wyatt is in trouble. Hope has let Liam back into her life. He barks this does not concern them. She says of course it does and she expects him to step up. Bill tells her to calm down. Wyatt is a tough kid. He will handle this. He does not need his mommy to fight his battles for him or his dad either. She shakes her finger at him and says no she will not be dismissed, she will be taken seriously. What if Brooke were to come back and find them together. Bill reminds her that she promised not to say anything about their previous meetings. She says he promised to, so he needs to step up and support Wyatt and Hope. He can not lose the only girl he has ever loved. Bill will not let Wyatt down."

        "Hope: [Sighs] Well, we were, you know, dating exclusively for months, and now we're not. I'm -- I'm seeing you, too.",
        "Liam: Yeah, something my brother obviously was not counting on.",

        "Bill: You want to horse around?",
        "Brooke: [Groans] No.",
        "Bill: All right. Okay. That's a bad pun. I'll admit it -- pretty bad.",
        "Brooke: It's the worst. Yeah. How about...",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: ...We just kiss instead?",
        "Bill: We could do that.",

        "Bill: That works for me.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Somebody's feeling quite amorous this morning.",
        "Bill: I'm just appreciating my good fortune.",
        "Brooke: Mm.",
        "Bill: I have to admit -- there were a couple of moments when I was concerned that we would never be like this again.",
        "Brooke: And now that we are?",
        "Bill: We'll spend the rest of our lives in this bed doing what we do best.",
        "Brooke: [Giggles] Yeah. But we do other things really good, too.",
        "Bill: Do we? Do we? All right. Let me hear it. Enlighten me.",
        "Brooke: Ah, make breakfast, me making my famous French toast, you watching me make my famous French toast.",
        "Bill: I do like watching you make that French toast. That's true. Other than that, I stay clear of the kitchen.",
        "Brooke: Mm.",
        "Bill: But I think that you are throwing a hint my way -- trying to tell me that you're hungry.",
        "Brooke: Where you going?",
        "Bill: [Sighs] I'm gonna do a little thing called breakfast in bed. I can do that, all right? So just stay exactly as you are.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Cute Stallion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You were right. I was too complacent, too sure of what Hope and I had to think that Liam would ever get inside her head.",
        "Quinn: But that's what he's done.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, the dude saw an opening, and then he took advantage of how vulnerable she's been with this whole pregnancy-scare thing.",
        "Quinn: And then he started issuing ultimatums like the spoiled little brat that he is.",
        "Wyatt: Well, you said it yourself -- they got a lot of history -- proposals, engagements, almost-weddings.",
        "Quinn: All of which ended in Hope getting her heart broken, and you would never cause her that kind of pain.",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Quinn: Frankly, honey, I'm beginning to think that Hope doesn't deserve you.",
        "Wyatt: Don't ever say that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Knowing Wyatt, I'm sure he didn't just roll over and take this.",
        "Hope: No. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: He wanted you to spend the night, right? I mean, even after you told him you're dating both of us.",
        "Hope: Well, he -- he knows that things are different now, okay? He gets that there are some things that are acceptable and some things that are not.",
        "Liam: Right, which he won't like one bit.",
        "Hope: But I think that Wyatt knows it's -- it's not really a step backwards. It's just -- ugh, I need this time to --",
        "Liam: To figure out which one of us you can really marry...",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: ...Which one of us you can start a family with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Well, off you go to the office, and I'm not.",
        "Brooke: I know. [Sighs] I know you're still frustrated. I'm sorry.",
        "Bill: You know, it's not just that Katie stole my company -- it's my son. He's -- he's my son. I deserve equal custody, and Katie won't budge.",
        "Brooke: Well, maybe if I talk to Karen again...",
        "Bill: No, no, no. You -- you went to the wall. You told Karen that I should be C.E.O. over your own sister, and I'll always love you and appreciate you for that, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I just wish Katie would come to her senses.",
        "Bill: I don't think she'll ever get past what she believes we did to her.",
        "Brooke: Maybe Ridge will help her do that.",
        "Bill: I doubt that. If anything, he's just going to egg her on. But you know what? I-I'm done with Katie holding my company hostage. There is another way to go at this. I've been reluctant to pursue it, but... I think it's time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You know, I was thinking, now that we're officially dating again, maybe I should buy my own RV -- like twice the size of what's-his-name.",
        "Hope: [Laughs] This is not a competition, okay? I am just trying to think things through. I am trying to figure out what I want for my life moving forward.",
        "Liam: I'm just playing. I know that.",
        "Hope: You know that I care about you...a lot. But I care about Wyatt, too. And, truthfully, I think that he's hurting a lot more than he let on last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Obviously, Hope stopped by here after her date with Liam, so tell me what she said.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] What? You want a play-by-play, mom?",
        "Quinn: I want to know how she could do this to you.",
        "Wyatt: She's not doing this to me. She said she needs to do something for herself.",
        "Quinn: By -- by letting Liam back into her life for the umpteenth time?",
        "Wyatt: Liam has never been out of her life.",
        "Quinn: Well, what does that mean? What? Does she still love him?",
        "Wyatt: She said she loves both of us.",
        "Quinn: And this is her way of deciding which brother she wants?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Having a kid -- who she wants to have that kid with -- how it fits into her life -- these are the things that she needs to decide on her own. I mean, if that pregnancy test was positive...",
        "Quinn: Then fate would have decided for her.",
        "Wyatt: Exactly.",
        "Quinn: Just like it did for me. Okay, honey, I get it now. I do. But where does this leave you, Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Huh? Where does it leave us and our company? Because if -- if Liam could guilt her into taking him back...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Got to get on with things. You know, since Karen won't budge, I'm gonna start my own business, from the ground up -- the same way my father did with Spencer.",
        "Brooke: What about Will? That's not gonna solve the problem of equal custody. And what about your passion for Spencer? I mean, can you really have that same kind of passion for a new business as you do for your company? That company's practically in your DNA.",
        "Bill: Well, I don't see what option I have, Brooke. Katie's firmly entrenched as C.E.O. Unless you know something I don't.",
        "Brooke: I love my sister, and I don't want her to be stripped of anything, but you shouldn't be marginalized at your company, the same way you shouldn't have to beg to have equal custody of Will. You're a good father... and you're a wonderful person. And your commitment to me says a lot. Ridge could never really do that. There was always some other woman. There was Taylor and Caroline. But with you...there is nobody else. I'm the only one. Just me. I like that.",
        "(Bill's flashback)",
        "Quinn: Naughty boy.",
        "Bill: You crazy bitch.",
        "[Glass shatters]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Mom, come on. One crisis at a time, okay?",
        "Quinn: Oh, thank you. At least you finally admit that this is a crisis.",
        "Wyatt: No, I'm just saying that it's not the -- it's not the best-case scenario.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Because of Liam -- thinking he can always get whatever he wants. And you know what? That's your father's fault. Bill spoiled that wimpy little wuss rotten.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, at least dad's not taking sides where Hope's concerned.",
        "Quinn: That you know of! He might be weighing in behind the scenes, giving his number-one son all of his fatherly advice. But where is he when you need help?",
        "Wyatt: I'm not a kid anymore! I don't need dad to come and rescue me any more than I need you to. Hope is everything to me, okay? And, yes, my relationship has taken a hit, but I still believe that I am the best person for Hope.",
        "Quinn: Of course you are. Baby, you and Liam may be half-brothers, but you're the true Spencer by far. You -- you are strong-willed and a fighter. You're gonna have the life that you deserve. I promise you that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: So, I was thinking, maybe we could go sailing. I mean, the weather's been amazing lately, and -- and, look, if it turns on us, and we get shipwrecked on a desert island for the rest of our lives, I'm not gonna complain.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Just so you know, as important as this decision is for me...I'm not gonna draw it out. I'm going to actually make a decision. Because the truth is, Liam... I love you both, and I could see a future with either of you. What I can't do is allow circumstances to make that decision for me, so whenever I do decide to get married or have kids, it's gonna be my choice. It's going to be because it's right for me, and however that turns out...",
        "Liam: Oh, I know how it's gonna turn out. With you and me together and crazy in love.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I waited until Brooke drove off.",
        "Bill: Quinn, what the hell? How did you get in here?",
        "Quinn: Oh, it wasn't easy. The maid didn't want to let me up.",
        "Bill: Then why did she?!",
        "Quinn: Because I told her that I was your son's mother and that he's in trouble, and he needs us.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about -- what do you mean Wyatt's in trouble? What is it?",
        "Quinn: Hope is backing away from him. She wants to date Liam, too. We have to do something.",
        "Bill: Are you kidding me? That's what this is about? This doesn't concern us!",
        "Quinn: Of course it does! He's your son! I expect you to step up.",
        "Bill: Look, you got to get --",
        "Quinn: No! You said you were going to do something, Bill. Liam gets all your perks. He gets all your attention. What have you done to help Wyatt?",
        "Bill: Calm yourself!",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Bill: Calm down!",
        "Quinn: You calm down! Do you have any idea what this means to our son? He loves Hope, and if Liam somehow manages to guilt her into having a future with him, Wyatt's gonna be heartbroken. He already is.",
        "Bill: Okay, listen. All right? Stay with me here. Take this in. Wyatt is a tough kid. He's gonna be fine. He does not need his mommy to fight his battles for him or his dad, for that matter.",
        "Quinn: No! No! No! I will not be pushed aside! I will be taken seriously by you.",
        "Bill: Wyatt can take care of his own life. You got to back off.",
        "Quinn: I am fighting for our son's happiness.",
        "Bill: By doing what? By -- by barging in Brooke's and my bedroom, going off half-cocked? No, no. This conversation is not happening.",
        "Quinn: What are you afraid of, Bill? Oh. Oh. Maybe Brooke forgot something, and she's gonna come back here, and then, oh -- oh, maybe she'll find us together -- you and me.",
        "Bill: You said that you would keep your mouth shut about that, and you better do it.",
        "Quinn: You said you would take care of our son.",
        "Bill: What do you want me to do?",
        "Quinn: Make Wyatt a Spencer. Stop propping up Liam. Support Wyatt and Hope. He cannot lose her, Bill. He cannot lose the only girl he has ever loved. You will not let that happen. Don't let Wyatt down.",
