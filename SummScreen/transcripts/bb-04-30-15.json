        "Nicole begs Maya not to rock the boat. Do not tell Rick that she is transgender just now. Things are going so well with her and Rick and Nicole with Wyatt .the Avant sisters are rocking it so why spoil all of that. Rick meets with a jeweler and picks out a huge diamond engagement ring.....flawless just like Maya and shines like her eyes. He then texts Brooke and she meets him to hear his good news. She is surprised and wonders why he is doing this so soon. He knows everything he needs to know about Maya and he is sure about this. This is the stability he has wanted all his life. He had issues with Amber and Caroline but Maya is not like that. She is straight forward and authentic, no surprises and secrets. She has all the qualities he needs. He loves her and wants Brooke to be happy for him. She hugs him and says she does want him to be happy and not hurt again. He says again that Maya will never let him down.",
        "Ridge comes into the office to find Eric. The father initiates a hug. Ridge says it is what it is around here with Rick and his power and he is at the end of his rope and so is everyone else. Eric defends Rick but then admits he has a ways to go to treat others fairly, but Ridge should not take it so personally that he is taking orders now from his little brother. Nicole tells Maya to encourage this ride for as long as she can. Maya says she is not ashamed of herself, in fact she is proud of herself, and this is not a game. This is who she is and she can not have children and Rick needs to know that. Her only concern is that she has now waited too long. Rick comes in and surprises Maya. He hopes they are through with their sisterly arguing .too nice a day for that. Nicole leaves and Rick says he knows they are always talking abut honesty but every now and then he thinks it is okay for him to have a little secret. Ridge tells his dad that Ricky boy is a problem and takes all the credit rather that what the creative team does for FC. Brooke barges in and want to defend Rick since he is not here. Ridge keeps mentioning Maya and that she is just a model. It's ridiculous and he can not take orders from her too. Brooke tells him to look at the books and he would not say this is ridiculous. Eric says Rick has asked for an extension and the way things are going he is considering it. Ridge says fine then Eric can find another designer as he quits."

        "Nicole: Well, I was wrong.",
        "Maya: What changed?",

        "Eric: I was hoping things had improved around here.",
        "Ridge: No, they've gotten worse.",
        "Eric: I'm disappointed to hear that.",
        "Ridge: So am I. And it's not just me, Dad. It's everyone. Morale is low. People are worried about getting fired. Rick is not the same when you're not here.",
        "Eric: I just spoke to Rick. He's in a good place.",
        "Ridge: Of course he's in a good place, Dad! He's running Forrester! He's throwing his power around, he and his girlfriend! And I'm tired of it! Your son, your -- your poor, neglected son, forgotten son -- I can't deal with him as C.E.O. anymore.",

        "Brooke: Rick. I got your text. What's going on?",
        "Rick: Hey, Mom.",
        "Brooke: You made it sound important.",
        "Rick: It is.",
        "Brooke: Good, I hope.",
        "Rick: It's better than good. In fact, it's gonna change my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Rick has to find out sooner or later.",
        "Nicole: How about later?",
        "Maya: How about it's not up to you?",
        "Nicole: I'm just saying. Why now when things are so good? Why not wait awhile?",
        "Maya: Are you thinking about me or you?",
        "Nicole: You. Mostly you. You and Rick are doing so well right now, and I'm just starting to get to know Wyatt, and why mess with that? You know what I'm saying? I mean, the Avant sisters are rocking it. Don't do anything to ruin it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Rick will have you believing that everything is just great, that he is running this company seamlessly. And you ask anyone, anyone but Maya, and they will tell you differently.",
        "Eric: It's hard for me to hear.",
        "Ridge: He rehired Quinn, Dad.",
        "Eric: I know. I know. I heard that. That was a surprise to me, as well.",
        "Ridge: A surprise? It's ridiculous. She's a nutcase. And Ivy's stuff was selling just fine.",
        "Eric: Look, he felt that, uh, we were missing Quinn's edge there. He wanted to give our customers some more choices.",
        "Ridge: He wasn't -- no, no, no! He wasn't doing any of that. He was trying to go after Ivy for whatever reason. It's his cousin! It's too much power in the wrong hands.",
        "Eric: Rick's gonna be CEO for the rest of this year. I suggest that you learn how to work with that.",
        "Ridge: I don't care about the contract. Can you please [Sighs] just look into terminating it?",
        "Eric: We've been over this, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: And I don't want to go over it again, Dad! Just open your eyes to what's going on around here. Put a stop to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Oh!",
        "Rick: What do you think?",
        "Brooke: Wow. It's beautiful. It's -- it's gorgeous. But a ring so soon?",
        "Rick: Well, why do you seem so surprised? I told you I was thinking about marrying Maya.",
        "Brooke: I know, honey. It's just you're technically still married to Caroline.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'm well aware, but there's no law that says that -- that I can't propose.",
        "Brooke: That's true. But why the rush?",
        "Rick: It just feels right.",
        "Brooke: You'll be going from one marriage to another, no time to process anything, no time for yourself.",
        "Rick: I've never been that great at being single anyway.",
        "Brooke: You're really sure that Maya's the one?",
        "Rick: Yeah. Maya's the woman for me. I've never been more sure about anything in my life. I know everything I need to know about Maya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Rick can't find out about you. He just...can't.",
        "Maya: I am shocked by your change of opinion.",
        "Nicole: I'm seeing things differently now.",
        "Maya: Now that you have a Spencer on the speed dial.",
        "Nicole: Look, I get why you've been so protective of your relationship with Rick. Living this life is pretty amazing.",
        "Maya: My relationship goes deeper than a limo and a private jet.",
        "Nicole: I'm not comparing Wyatt to Rick. My point is, why not enjoy this ride for as long as we possibly can?",
        "Maya: Because this isn't a ride. It's my life.",
        "Nicole: Okay. You, me, and Carter are the only ones who know about it.",
        "Maya: Last week you were practically forcing me to tell Rick, and now you never want me to say a word?",
        "Nicole: Like I said, it's not like you're lying to him.",
        "Maya: I'm not ashamed of myself, Nicole! In fact, I'm becoming proud of myself that I wasn't scared, that I stopped living somebody else's life and became who I'm meant to be -- a woman, a woman who loves Rick and the woman Rick loves.",
        "Nicole: Exactly. So why take any chances?",
        "Maya: Because it's a part of who I am! And I can't carry children! And he has to know why. My only concern... is that I've already waited too long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: My, my, this is a big adjustment for you, isn't it, having to answer to your little brother.",
        "Ridge: You think that's what it is? You think I worry if he's older or younger than me? I worry that he runs this company in a professional manner and not undermine everything that I do.",
        "Eric: Look, whether you believe it or not, and whether he admits it or not, he -- he gives your input a great deal of value. He -- he respects you as a designer.",
        "Ridge: Stop it! He doesn't respect anybody! He doesn't know what that means!",
        "Eric: All right, look, I admit he has a lot of work to do. He takes this all very, very seriously, though.",
        "Ridge: [Laughs]",
        "Eric: Running this company -- it's a big deal to him.",
        "Ridge: What he does is he hurts people. He messes with their head, and he gets a kick out of it. And he's gonna ruin our reputation -- he and Maya.",
        "Eric: Maya's been very good for him.",
        "Ridge: Wow, he just -- he can do no wrong in your eyes, huh?",
        "Eric: All right, I admit he has a lot to learn about how to handle his employees. I'll admit that.",
        "Ridge: Is that what I am now? An employee to Rick and Maya?",
        "Eric: Oh, for God's sake.",
        "Ridge: Is that what I am, Dad? 'Cause I'm not accepting that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Okay, let's bulletpoint this whole scenario. Say Rick proposes. You have a few days of engagement bliss, making plans, flashing new ring, floating around with your head in the clouds, until you decide to wake up one morning and ruin it. \"Hey, honey, funny story.\"",
        "Maya: I don't think I'd put it quite that way.",
        "Nicole: It doesn't matter how you say it or how you spin it. It's a fact. And there's a good chance Rick will wig out.",
        "Maya: Well, we don't know that, do we?",
        "Nicole: [Sighs]",
        "Maya: I just have to trust him and his faith in me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'm just concerned about Maya. I know she makes you very happy and you think you know her completely. But I'm just not so sure.",
        "Rick: Why? What do you mean?",
        "Brooke: When you look at Maya, do you really see her for who she is?",
        "Rick: I know who she is. She's that stability I've been craving my entire life. I'm not blaming anybody. You're a wonderful mother. But growing up, it killed me to watch Ridge walk in and out of your life. I mean, we're a family one minute, and the next minute, he's gone, and I'm left picking up the pieces and taking care of you.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry. That must have been a terrible burden as a young boy.",
        "Rick: I just wanted better for you than the headlines and the gossip and the whispering. And yeah, it was rough on me. But then I had all my own issues with Amber and Caroline, women that I thought were open and truthful, only to be let down by lies and betrayal. But Maya -- she's not like that. She's straightforward, she's authentic, even if it hurts. I never have to second- guess where she's coming from or what she's thinking, no surprises, no secrets. And after everything I've been through, I think I'm ready to commit to a woman who has all the qualities that I need. You know, goodness, integrity, beauty, honesty. I love her, Mom. I only hope that you can be supportive and -- and happy for me.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Yes, of course. I love you, honey. I just want to see you happy. I don't want to see you hurt again.",
        "Rick: Maya will never let me down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: So, let me get this straight. You're kind of sure but kind of not so sure as to how Rick will react?",
        "Maya: I hope he'll understand. I'll be surprised if he doesn't.",
        "Nicole: Oh, he won't think it's manipulative that you waited for the bling before coming clean about being transgender?",
        "Maya: Rick. Hi. I didn't realize your meeting was over already.",
        "Rick: Sneak attack.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Rick: How you doing, gorgeous?",
        "Maya: Hey. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: So, you two, uh, work this stuff out, your sister stuff?",
        "Nicole: No big deal. Just needed to talk to my big sis. I think she's finally starting to understand where I'm coming from.",
        "Rick: Good. So no more arguing. It's too beautiful of a day to be doing that. So, uh, could we perhaps have some alone time? [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: Oh, well, look at you smiling.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: Cute, little look on your face.",
        "Rick: Hmm.",
        "Maya: What's up?",
        "Rick: We're always talking about the importance of being open and honest. But sometimes I think it's good to have a secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm a good designer. Tell me you know that.",
        "Eric: You are a good designer. You're just about the best there is.",
        "Ridge: All right. Good. And that's what I want to do. I want to design. I want to create things. And he questions everything, every little thing, I do. And he doesn't know the first thing about design or aesthetics.",
        "Eric: But Rick's a terrific businessman.",
        "Ridge: So what? He keeps telling me how great the numbers are --",
        "Eric: The numbers are great, and you know it!",
        "Ridge: And the numbers are great why? Because of Ricky? Ricky did all this? Nobody else?",
        "Brooke: Is there a problem here?",
        "Ridge: I don't think so. We're just in the middle of a conversation.",
        "Brooke: I heard you mention my son's name. He's not here to defend himself, so I will.",
        "Ridge: Fine. [Sighs] Whatever. Forrester has been a very successful company for a very long time, but not because somebody's in the back room counting money. It's because of what we do as a company. We design things. We create things.",
        "Brooke: It's a combination of things.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Excuse me. Dad, you're an artist. You know this company started on a sketch pad. And that's still where everything comes from.",
        "Eric: Your designs are terrific! They've been wonderful. So have Caroline's. But we need strong management, and Rick provides that. And with Maya at his side, it's just the way it should be.",
        "Ridge: Maya, Maya. Maya's a model! [Sighs] And she's part of the problem, Dad, and what's gonna happen now? They're gonna get married and I got to listen to both of them? I can't do that! It's ridiculous!",
        "Brooke: Eric and I fully support our son. He's done an amazing job, and he's proven himself time and time again.",
        "Ridge: And how would you know that? You haven't been here.",
        "Brooke: Okay, why don't you downplay it, Ridge? I know the success of a company is because of its earnings and its growth. Take a look at the growth. Take a look at the earnings. That's far from ridiculous!",
        "Ridge: Okay, I'm not gonna argue with you because it is pointless.",
        "Eric: Look, Rick has asked for an extension to his CEO contract, and the way things are going, I have to tell you, I'm gonna consider giving it to him.",
        "Ridge: Are you kidding me right now? Rick is out of control. And I-I know. You haven't been here. You've been away chasing monkeys. But now you're here. Maybe you can see that he's degrading people. Caroline, Ivy, Wyatt, me. He -- he took down... he took down my mother's portrait and replaced it with Maya's picture. Is that what we're doing at Forrester Creations now?",
        "Eric: Look, there's a reality --",
        "Ridge: Wait! Is that what we're doing? Do I have to listen to Rick for the rest of my days?!",
        "Eric: There's a reality here, and you're just gonna have to accept it, Ridge! Come on!",
        "Ridge: Okay. Let's backtrack for a second. So, everything that happens here is because of Rick. The design doesn't matter. Everything is -- is meaningless. So maybe you should get someone else to design. I quit."
