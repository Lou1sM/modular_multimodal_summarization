Stephen, enchanted by Jackie says that he would like to get to know her son better. Back at Felicia's, Bridget accused Stephanie of undermining her and Dante from taking Dino to Italy by accusing them of kidnapping. Bridget begs Felicia to stand up to her mother, but to her disappointment, Felicia tells Bridget that she just doesn't want all this fighting around her son. When Felicia leaves the room Stephanie presents Dante with papers to sign that would give FULL custody to Felicia. Stephanie drops a bombshell when she hints that if Dante doesn't sign, she will fire him from Forrester and he will lose his visa and be deported !",
        "At the cabin, Nick tells Brooke, that Ridge implied that she only enjoyed sex with Ridge. Brooke is horrified and asks Ridge to leave. Nick rants and raves that she should press charges against Ridge, but Brooke tells him that for the sake of her children she can't. Nick tells her that she may be able to move past what Ridge did to her, but he can't. Brooke realizes that this may tear them apart and begs Nick not to let this come between them!"

        "Brooke: Nick --",
        "Nick: You're not getting away with this, Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Brooke --",
        "Nick: Don't you talk to her! Don't even look at her!",
        "Brooke: I know you want to protect me --",
        "Nick: He attacked you and he is not getting away with it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: The baby in that bedroom is Felicia's child.",
        "Dante: No one is denying that.",
        "Bridget: Felicia, just -- tell me what happened. I thought we had agreed on a solution, and now your mother is contesting my guardianship?",
        "Stephanie: Bridget --",
        "Felicia: I didn't --",
        "Stephanie: Bridget, we are contesting your guardianship on the fact that she's alive and capable of taking care of her own child.",
        "Dante: No one is denying that, either. We're not taking Dino away from Felicia. We're just taking him on vacation.",
        "Stephanie: Dante, you're not going to take him anywhere.",
        "Dante: Fine.",
        "Bridget: Felicia, this doesn't have to get ugly.",
        "Stephanie: No, it doesn't. If the two of you will just step aside.",
        "Dante: Dino is my son!",
        "Stephanie: Shh -- let's not -- let's not get out of control here. Let's talk about this rationally.",
        "Dante: There's nothing rational! Threatening to be arrested on kidnapping charges because we're leaving the country?",
        "Bridget: Look, Felicia, we understand that it's hard for you to be apart from Dino. I mean, of course it is, he's your baby. It's just a week. Not even a week. Dante and I saw how sad you were when we took Dino away and we decided to cut the trip short and come back a few days early.",
        "Stephanie: That's very, very generous of both of you. But you don't seem to understand, Bridget. You have no right to take the baby anywhere for any length of time, period.",
        "Felicia: All right, that's enough.",
        "Bridget: God, thank you. See, I told you that she wouldn't put up with this.",
        "Felicia: No, what I'm not gonna put up with is all this fighting and animosity around my son.",
        "Bridget: I agree. It's not good for Dino. But we are all good for him working together. And loving him. Looking after him. Sharing custody of him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: You never thought it would happen, but it did. You found her. Now you're both so in love. If only I could be so lucky --",
        "[Jackie daydreaming]",
        "Eric: Jackie?",
        "Jackie: Oh, Eric. If you're looking for Nicky, he's not here.",
        "Eric: No, no. I was hoping to see you. I've hurt you.",
        "Jackie: My feelings aren't your responsibility.",
        "Eric: I asked you to wait.",
        "Jackie: And I waited. But that was my choice. When you put this ring on my finger, all the mistakes of my past, they simply disappeared. Trusting too innocently. Giving myself too freely. You see, I always thought I wouldn't be alone. That was a man out there for me somewhere.",
        "Eric: There is. Jackie, I made a promise to you. It's a promise I want to keep.",
        "Jackie: What about your marriage to Stephanie?",
        "Eric: It's over. We're divorced.",
        "Jackie: Divorced?",
        "Eric: It's official. My marriage to Stephanie is finally over. Here.",
        "Jackie: What -- what are you doing? Oh, Eric -- Eric, I can't take another disappointment.",
        "Eric: And I can't take another day without you. It's finally happened. The man that you've been waiting for is here. Marry me, Jackie.",
        "Jackie: Who am I kidding? That man's never gonna walk into my life. [Knock at the door] May I help you?",
        "Stephen: I'm looking for Nick Marone.",
        "Jackie: Do you have an appointment?",
        "Stephen: I just dropped by to invite him to dinner or a drink.",
        "Jackie: Business associate or friend?",
        "Stephen: Actually, future father-in-law.",
        "Jackie: You're Stephen Logan?",
        "Stephen: Nick has mentioned me?",
        "Jackie: Yeah. Yes, he has. A few times.",
        "Stephen: I'm afraid we didn't get off on the right foot.",
        "Jackie: That's too bad.",
        "Stephen: But I'd like to try again. That man's gonna spend a life with my daughter, I figured we should get to know each other better.",
        "Jackie: Nick's an incredible man. He's kind. He's compassionate. He's devoted to Brooke and the children. Hope -- Hope adores him.",
        "Stephen: As do you, apparently.",
        "Jackie: I better. I'm his mother.",
        "Stephen: Now that's impossible. You're much too young.",
        "Jackie: And you're much too charming. I'm Jacqueline.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Brooke, you can't let him get away with this.",
        "Brooke: Nick, what happened last night was a mistake.",
        "Nick: A mistake? He said you wanted it.",
        "Ridge: That's not what I said.",
        "Nick: You said that she loves sex. You said that nobody satisfies her like you do.",
        "Brooke: Did you say that?",
        "Ridge: Well --",
        "Brooke: Damn it, Ridge. Nick, he was just trying to get a reaction out of you.",
        "Nick: Out of me? Well, what about you? When do his actions become unacceptable? You want me to back off? Fine. What are you gonna do about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Shared custody is not an option.",
        "Dante: Bridget was talking to Felicia.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, well, Felicia is recovering. I don't want her to have to handle this kind of stress.",
        "Bridget: Oh, well, you're the one causing it, Stephanie. Not us.",
        "Stephanie: Come on, I want you to go inside.",
        "Dante: Wait a damn minute here! Hold on.",
        "Stephanie: Do you want to make a settlement of some kind? Then you're gonna have to deal with me.",
        "Bridget: Please, Felicia, just sit back down. I'm sure we can work through a solution that will satisfy all of us.",
        "Stephanie: Not tonight.",
        "Felicia: You know, it's been such an emotional day. Maybe mom's right. We can discuss it tomorrow.",
        "Stephanie: Come on, honey.",
        "Bridget: Okay, obviously, you got to her. But, just -- what the hell did you say?",
        "Stephanie: The same thing that I'm going to say to you. Felicia is recovering. She capable of taking care of the baby, all right? Your guardianship is going to be revoked in a few days.",
        "Dante: You cannot revoke my rights as his father.",
        "Stephanie: Dante, please. One drunken night with my daughter does not make a father. It's the hard decisions that make good parents. I'm prepared to make that decision making process worth your while.",
        "Bridget: Excuse me? Did you just offer to buy Dante's son?",
        "Stephanie: No, I want to reward him for doing the right thing. Bridget, Felicia and I appreciate and will always appreciate the fact that the two of you were willing to stand up and raise this baby in the event that she died. But she didn't die, all right? You have to accept that. You have to get on with your lives. And I can make those lives much easier. Especially yours, Dante. All you have to do is sign these papers and give Felicia full custody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: What happened last night never should have happened.",
        "Nick: Don't make excuses for him.",
        "Ridge: Why don't you shut up and let her explain something to you?",
        "Nick: You wanted him to leave, did you or did you not?",
        "Brooke: Yes, but --",
        "Nick: Then there's nothing else to discuss.",
        "Ridge: I agree. Why don't you put a leash on him?",
        "Nick: You arrogant son of a bitch!",
        "Brooke: Nick, wait! Nick, stop it! Stop! Stop! Ridge, go. I want you to go. Please, just go home! Nick, let's talk about this. Let's just calm down, okay?",
        "Nick: I can't believe you're being so calm.",
        "Brooke: This situation isn't black and white like you think it is.",
        "Nick: It is. Either he violated you or you wanted to sleep with him. Which is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: I just don't know why you're doing this. You know how much we love that child, how much we love Felicia. Why would you need to draw the line in the sand like this?",
        "Stephanie: It's because there are no boundaries that this whole situation has gotten out of hand. I know you love this baby, I understand that, but you are not his mother. I understand that you need to hold on to him. I know there's a void in you that has to be filled because of the loss of your child. But you are not his mother, Felicia is, and you've got to let go.",
        "Bridget: Well, Dante doesn't. He's the biological father and he has a paternity test to prove it.",
        "Stephanie: I understand that, but he also needs to work.",
        "Dante: Excuse me?",
        "Stephanie: You work for me, remember?",
        "Bridget: You can't order him to sign anything.",
        "Dante: She could fire me if I don't.",
        "Bridget: So what? You don't need the money. And you have your art, it's fine.",
        "Dante: Bridget, I need my job at Forrester to keep my working visa.",
        "Bridget: Oh, my god. Are you threatening to deport him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: I hope I can repair your son's opinion of me.",
        "Jackie: Well, he'll think far better of you if you treat his mother kindly.",
        "Stephen: Is that so?",
        "Jackie: Yes. My son is very protective of me.",
        "Stephen: And of Brooke, I noticed.",
        "Jackie: He'd do anything for both of us.",
        "Stephen: Maybe I should ask you to put in a good word for me.",
        "[Jackie giggles]",
        "Jackie: We could be in-laws one day. It'd be nice if we could get along. Of course that's not always possible, is it?",
        "Stephen: Don't tell me. Brooke had Stephanie Forrester as a mother-in-law.",
        "Jackie: You two didn't jibe?",
        "Stephen: She and Massimo Marone pretty much ruined my life. I made my own mistakes -- and big ones -- but they played me perfectly.",
        "Jackie: The tag team of doom.",
        "Stephen: Then you know?",
        "Jackie: Oh yeah, better than anyone, Mr. Logan. I was married to the man.",
        "Stephen: Married to Massimo? I am sorry.",
        "Jackie: Related to Stephanie Forrester? I may actually be sorrier for you.",
        "Stephen: I think the one I'm sorriest for is my daughter.",
        "Jackie: You're right, Stephanie treated her really badly.",
        "Stephen: And I was encouraging her to go back to Ridge.",
        "Jackie: Really?",
        "Stephen: Well, I'm sure Nick told you. That's why I'm here. I'm Ridge Forrester's trump card.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You didn't want it. You said no and it happened anyway. What do you call that?",
        "Brooke: He thought that I was allowing it. But I wasn't. I wasn't even there. My body was completely numb. I don't know how else to explain it, Nick.",
        "Nick: Well, I do. The man violated you. I want you to press charges and get a restraining order against him.",
        "Brooke: I can't.",
        "Nick: Why not? What is gonna keep him from attacking you again?",
        "Brooke: He's not going to do that.",
        "Nick: Why? You can see he's completely lost touch with reality. He'd do anything to get you back. If you don't lock your bedroom door, it's basically an invitation for him to come back in. Maybe you need to answer that question then -- do you want him to come in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I'm not threatening anyone. I'm just trying to get you to understand, your position is untenable.",
        "Dante: Bridget, if I lose my job at Forrester, I'll have to leave the country.",
        "Bridget: Even if he does, it doesn't automatically mean Felicia will get custody of Dino.",
        "Stephanie: We'll get into an international custody battle -- it'll be protracted and probably very expensive.",
        "Bridget: So you're telling me that dante can't be a father because he's not a citizen?",
        "Stephanie: I'm not questioning his fitness. Bridget, you know what would make me really happy? If the two of you would fall in love, decide you want to be a family and start having children of your own.",
        "Dante: I already have a child!",
        "Stephanie: You didn't even know that baby existed until a couple of months ago.",
        "Dante: Okay, so I should be able to forget about my son because I haven't known him that long? That's absurd!",
        "Bridget: And incredibly insulting.",
        "Stephanie: I am not telling you or expecting you to walk away from that baby, to turn your back on him. I know you love him. I'm asking you, can you put his needs above your own?",
        "Bridget: This is not about Dino's needs. This is about Stephanie's needs. Her need to control anything and anyone around her. You know, ridge finally stopped you from interfering in his life, and now you've moved on to Felicia. I think she's just a little too afraid to lose Dino to actually stop you.",
        "Stephanie: She is not going to lose that baby, Bridget. I am damn well gonna make sure of that.",
        "Dante: You don't get it, do you? That thought never crossed our minds.",
        "Stephanie: Good, and it better never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Well, I know that Ridge has been trying to make inroads with Brooke.",
        "Stephen: And using me to do it.",
        "Jackie: Well, I guess Stephanie is not the only Forrester with a talent for manipulation.",
        "Stephen: I actually thought that Ridge was trying to help me put back together my relationship with Brooke. Now I have no idea what's going on in his head.",
        "Jackie: Have you had a change of heart?",
        "Stephen: Call it a crisis of conscience. He did something to my daughter and she's forgiven him for it. I'm not sure I can.",
        "Jackie: Well, there's no question as to what's going on in Nick's head. He is totally 100% committed to your daughter and her children.",
        "Stephen: I don't know him that well yet. But if he's half as charming as his mother, I don't see how Brooke can resist him.",
        "Brooke: I know you think I'm trying to protect Ridge, but I'm not. I'm trying to protect my children.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Good, they should be protected, from him. He violated their mother.",
        "Brooke: I don't want them to know that, nick. But if I press charges or file a restraining order, it all becomes a matter of public record.",
        "Nick: Well, so what? Are you worried about his reputation.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god. I am worried about the impact that this will have on my children. Please, let's just forget about this, okay? Let's just put it behind us and focus on our family -- you, me, the children.",
        "Nick: No, no. I can't do it. I can't -- I can't do it. I can't let him get away with this. I want you to press charges. I want this man out of your life forever.",
        "Brooke: He is R.J.'s father. I can't do that!",
        "Nick: Well, I can't let him do this and just think that it's okay and I'll forget it!",
        "Brooke: I know. I know. And I am sorry. I am really sorry. I didn't want this to happen, Nick. I told him to go. You have to believe me. I love you. I love you so much. And I'm looking forward to the life that we planned. I want that. So tell me. Tell me that we can put this whole thing behind us. Nick, tell me that. Tell me you won't let this come between us. Tell me."
