        "Liam and Hope walk into the animal shelter where they agree that shelters like these do so much good. Hope says Liam's story will help spread the news. Katie and Ridge share several kisses. She says if he keeps this up she will get nothing done. But who needs food when she has these lips. And although she has plenty to do, nothing is more important than he is. He likes the sound of that. She glances at her clock and says she does not like Will being gone even for a few hours but it is good that he is spending some time with Bill. Ridge reminds her that Bill made his bed. She knows but she doesn't want him to think she is punishing him. Ridge says she is not punishing Bill so she has no reason to feel bad. She should always feel good especially when she is with him. Liam meets Brandon and introduces Hope. Brandon says Pam told him about Liam's article and he's glad to be able to help. He shows them around the facility and talks about the under-funded and overcrowded kennels. Many pets are put down each year because they can't find homes. It's obviously a serious problem and one of the main reasons is because they are not spayed or neutered. Liam says he has been an advocate since a small kid as his mother used to foster dogs for a rescue organization. Hope tells Brandon that Liam has one of the biggest hearts that she knows. Brandon shows them around and says this is brand new and houses 600 animals. Brandon is on call and takes them to meet Leslie, the kennel supervisor and asks if she will take them to the medical area. She shows them the surgery room and kennels where they stay after surgery. And they are rehabilitated. Hope and Liam meet Dr. DiSanto, the vet who explains more why neutering and spaying is so important to prevent many medical problems later as they age. Liam takes notes from all that he interviews. They meet some of the furry friends and Hope thanks Liam for bringing her here. At Brooke's Bill is playing with Will. He tells Brooke that this just reminds him how quickly time flies by and how precious it is. He has to find some way to spend more time with Will. Brooke goes to her purse ad slips out the papers. She's deep in thought and seems to have made a decision. Bill continues to grouse that Katie is not being fair. She has a company .his company to run yet he still gets scraps, two hours here, one there. Will can not even spend the night. Katie will send someone over after him in about an hour. He wants his son to get to know him and trust him and not just be an every other Sunday dad. He wants him to light up when he sees Bill and not punch a hole in the wall like he did with his own father. Brooke tells him she has some place to go, she will see him later.",
        "Brooke walks into Katie's office and interrupts a kiss. She starts off by asking Ridge if he'd gotten a text from RJ about wanting to come home to school in Los Angeles. She says they will have to discuss that. She tells Katie that she needs to speak to her alone. Ridge says he was leaving anyway. He will bring Will back to Katie in a bit. Brooke is displeased and tells Katie that is not a good idea. That is so insensitive to Bill. If Katie has to work and can't go herself, then give Bill a little more time with Will. Brooke says she realizes there is still bad blood between she and Bill, but he is going through a very difficult time right now and she is only asking Katie to be fair. Just let him spend one night. Katie says no, he had him all afternoon. That was the deal and she's not letting him spend the night. Will is a toddler and he needs structure and consistency. They are on a schedule. Brooke accuses her of keeping Will away from Bill. Katie says that is not her intention. Brooke accuses her of keeping Bill away from his company too. Katie says he did that, not her. Brooke reminds her that they are all happy. She is with Ridge, Brooke is with Bill but Bill is the only one miserable. He sits home with nothing to do all day and yet he built this company to what it is today. Katie realizes it must be hard but they've all had to make adjustments. Brooke suggests that it is time for Katie to make an adjustment too. Give Bill back his business. He's done his penance. She knows he hurt Katie, but he's paid the price and it is killing him. Give Bill equal custody of Will and give him his company back. That is what is fair. Katie knows in her heart that is the right thing to do."

        "Liam: Shelters like these do so much good for animals.",
        "Hope: Oh, yeah. And your story's only gonna increase awareness.",
        "Liam: Well, right. I mean, that's -- yeah, that's the idea.",
        "Hope: Yeah. You know, I knew that you cared about this cause, but...",
        "Liam: Well, here's the thing -- I mean, animals don't have a voice, so who's gonna speak up for them? I mean, we should be doing everything we can to make sure they're treated with respect and kindness.",
        "Hope: Oh, that's for sure.",
        "Liam: So, you ready to do this?",
        "Hope: Let's go.",

        "Ridge: Well, this is your lunch break, isn't it?",
        "Katie: Yeah, you're right. Who needs food when I have these lips?",
        "Ridge: You know, if we wanted to, we'd really let this get out of control.",
        "Katie: Mm. We could.",
        "Ridge: Uh-huh.",
        "Katie: Adele's at lunch. Will is with Bill. Of course, I am C.E.O. I've got many, many important things to do.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I bet you do.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Nothing's more important than you, though.",
        "Ridge: I like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Where you going?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Where you going?",
        "Brooke: He's been so content since he's been here.",
        "Bill: I know, huh?",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Look at how big he -- look. Look, look, look. Look at that. Look how strong he is, huh? Look at that bicep right there. You're getting so strong and so big.",
        "[Will fusses]",
        "Bill: Makes me realize -- [Sighs] Makes me realize how quickly time goes -- how precious that time is. Come on. Come here. Come on. [Smooching]",
        "Brooke: Yeah, it's just not fair to you or to Will.",
        "Bill: No. No, it's not. Not at all. Listen, we got to do something about this. We have to spend more time together. [Growling playfully] [Barking playfully] Get the doggy. Get that doggy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Brandon, hey. This is, uh, Hope Logan.",
        "Brandon: Hi. Brandon. How are you?",
        "Hope: Hi. I'm Hope. It's so nice to meet you.",
        "Brandon: You, too.",
        "Liam: Listen, thank you so much for agreeing to show us around the place.",
        "Brandon: When Pam told me about the article, I was happy to help. Come on.",
        "[Dogs barking]",
        "Liam: Hey, you know, I don't think people realize just how underfunded and overcrowded these kennels really are.",
        "Brandon: Yeah, every year, dogs and cats are put down because they can't find homes. It's obviously a very serious issue, and one of the main reasons this is happening is because they're not spayed or neutered.",
        "Liam: Well, that's a big reason I wanted to write this piece. I want to educate people on how to be more responsible pet owners.",
        "Brandon: Sweet. You guys have a dog?",
        "Hope: Us? Oh, uh, no. Uh, we actually don't live together.",
        "Liam: Yeah, we, um -- we -- just started dating.",

        "Ridge: You must be enjoying yourself.",
        "Katie: Oh? How can you tell?",
        "Ridge: Well, you've only checked the clock twice since I've been here, and usually when Will is away...",
        "Katie: I'm counting the minutes until he gets back. I'm sorry.",
        "Ridge: I don't blame you. He's a good kid.",
        "Katie: I don't like being away from him even for a few hours. But it's good that he's spending time with Bill.",
        "Ridge: Bill is very lucky to be spending any time with him at all.",
        "Katie: Well, he wants more time with him, and he wants his job back.",
        "Ridge: I bet he does, but that's not gonna happen. This company is run by a very capable, incredibly sexy woman.",
        "Katie: Me?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Brooke, it is so wrong. Katie gets to spend all the time in the world with him, play at C.E.O., run my company into the ground while she's doing it, and there is nothing that I can do.",
        "Brooke: That's not true.",
        "Bill: That is true. There's nothing I can do. I just need to own that. I mean, I tried everything. I tried reasoning with Katie. I tried fighting back. She won't give me equal time with Will. Karen will not reinstate me as C.E.O. For the first time in my life... I feel completely powerless.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brandon: So, Liam, how long you been an animal advocate?",
        "Liam: Oh, since I was a little kid. My mom used to foster dogs for this rescue organization.",
        "Brandon: Oh, cool. Yeah, living with families helps animals socialize, and it makes them more adoptable.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, it was a great experience -- I'll tell you that. It was just hard to keep looking at those cute little faces, you know?",
        "Hope: Yeah, well, Liam has one of the biggest hearts of anyone I know.",
        "Liam: Well, I -- yeah, I'm -- I'm just glad to be able to do a story like this where I can make an impact, you know?",
        "Hope: Oh, of course you will. You're -- you're very good at opening people's eyes.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Brandon: You guys ready to check it out?",
        "Liam: Uh, you?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You know who inspires me?",
        "Katie: Who?",
        "Ridge: You.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Who you are and the way you run this company with a strong yet gentle hand.",
        "Katie: Mm. I lose my cool sometimes, especially when I shouldn't.",
        "Ridge: You mean with Bill?",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Yeah. I mean, I know that it's killing him not being here and not having enough time with Will.",
        "Ridge: He made his bed, Katie.",
        "Katie: I just don't want him to feel like I'm punishing him.",
        "Ridge: You're not punishing him, and you shouldn't feel bad. You should feel good. You should always feel good when you're with me.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: So what can I do?",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: What can I do to make you feel good?",
        "Katie: Um...well, just keep doing what you're doing.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Look at that. That's a pretty good book. All right, I read you this book, so here's -- here's what you can do for me. Give me, uh -- give me a \"dada.\" Say, \"dada.\" No dada? Maybe we go for -- how about \"daddy\"? You just have to whisper it. Come here. Whisper it.",
        "Brooke: Dada!",
        "Bill: Oh! I heard it.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: That -- was that -- that him? I think it was him.",
        "Brooke: No, I think I heard that.",
        "Bill: You're not messing with me?",
        "Brooke: Mm. [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: How much more time do I have with him?",
        "Brooke: Uh, about an hour or so.",
        "Bill: An hour or so till Katie sends someone over, tells me my time is up, and they take my son, and walk out the door. I mean, is this how it's gonna be for the rest of my life -- the rest of his life?",
        "Brooke: Well, it doesn't have to be.",
        "Bill: I don't see how anything's gonna change. And I've tried reasoning with Katie. I haven't gotten anywhere.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, she's just being stubborn. You know, you're a good father. She knows that.",
        "Bill: Well, maybe you should tell that to Katie. I mean, come on, Brooke, right? She's got everything she wants -- all the time in the world with Will, C.E.O. of my company. And then -- and what do I get? I get scraps -- two hours here and there. I mean, she won't even let him sleep over. When's the last time I tucked my son in, kissed him good night?",
        "Brooke: You're right. You're right. There's got to be a better way.",
        "Bill: I-I want my son to grow up knowing his father as more than just the guy who picks him up every other Saturday. I want him to know me -- to know I have his back, to be able to trust me and count on me. When he sees me, I want him to light up -- not want to punch a wall in like I felt about my own father.",
        "Brooke: You're nothing like him, Bill.",
        "Bill: No, I would never abandon my son under any circumstances.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I'm sorry, but there's somewhere I need to go. [Smooches] Mwah! I'll talk to you later.",
        "Bill: Come on. Come give Daddy a hug. Give me a hug. Ooh. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brandon: This is a brand-new facility. They can care for 600 animals here.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God. There are so many homeless animals.",
        "Brandon: Yeah, once again, the reason why it's so important for people to get their pets spayed or neutered.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Leslie: Hi, Brandon.",
        "Brandon: Hey.",
        "Leslie: I was wondering if you could speak with Dr. DiSanto. She'd like to see you in her office for a minute.",
        "Brandon: I can. Uh, Liam, Hope, this is Leslie. She's the kennel supervisor.",
        "Leslie: Nice to meet you.",
        "Liam: Nice to meet you.",
        "Brandon: Leslie, would you mind showing them the medical area?",
        "Leslie: Sure. No problem. Hi. Come on in.",
        "Liam: All right.",
        "[Indistinct P.A. chatter]",
        "Leslie: So, this is our medical area. This is where we house all the animals that are under medical treatment or they're recovering from surgery. We do spay and neuters here on a daily basis. That's our surgery room that we actually do all the surgeries in there.",
        "[Dog whimpering]",
        "Leslie: So, this is Shelly Gomez.",
        "Liam: Hi, Shelly.",
        "Leslie: These are her little critters. This is Bacon, Daredevil, and Wally.",
        "Hope: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Leslie: Yeah, and she actually gets all of her dogs from the shelters. The goodness of her heart, yeah. She -- whatever ailment they have -- this one obviously has minus a leg, so she's made him a little wheelchair.",
        "Hope: And you help rehabilitate them?",
        "Shelly: Yes, yes.",
        "Liam: And this is Bacon. Ohh!",
        "Hope: Oh, you are beautiful.",
        "Liam: Yeah, and what happened to -- what happened to Bacon?",
        "Shelly: Uh, Bacon was brought to the shelter by a breeder.",
        "Liam: Uh-huh.",
        "Shelly: And her leg, uh, was literally rotting off -- it was really bad.",
        "Liam: Oh, my.",
        "Shelly: And it must have been broken at some time but never had any medical attention. And, uh, they called us. The breeder wanted to euthanize her, but instead, luckily, the shelter called us, and we fixed her up.",
        "Liam: What happened with Daredevil here?",
        "Shelly: Daredevil was born without eyes. We believe he was abused. He did have some physical abuse that the vet took care of. And it took a lot of work. Every time I touched him before he would scream. I don't think he ever knew how to be touched without being hurt before. This is a long process and a lot of work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh, hi.",
        "Brooke: Hi, it, uh -- the assistant was out so I just let myself in.",
        "Ridge: We were just, um...",
        "Katie: Yeah, come on in.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] How are you?",
        "Brooke: Good. Great.",
        "Ridge: Did you get the text from R.J.?",
        "Brooke: \"Top 10 reasons why his parents should let him come to school in Los Angeles.\" Yes, I got that.",
        "Ridge: Well, he's trying.",
        "Brooke: We'll have to discuss it.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Brooke: Katie, I need to talk to you alone for a moment.",
        "Ridge: Oh. Uh, I-I was leaving anyway. So, I will see you around the office.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Uh, when I get Will, should I bring him back here?",
        "Katie: Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.",
        "Ridge: Excuse me.",
        "Brooke: Wait. He's picking up Will?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Why?",
        "Brooke: I don't think that's a really good idea. It's very insensitive to Bill.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] He's doing me a favor, Brooke, because I have to stay here and work.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, exactly. You have to stay here and work, so why not let Bill spend some more time with his son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Leslie: Hi. Hope and Liam, this is Dr. DiSanto, our vet here at the shelter.",
        "Liam: It's nice to meet you.",
        "Hope: It's nice to meet you.",
        "Dr. DiSanto: Nice to meet you, too.",
        "Liam: Do you mind if I ask you some questions?",
        "Dr. DiSanto: Sure.",
        "Liam: This is great. Um, so, what kinds of things do you do here?",
        "Dr. DiSanto: We treat 300 to 600 animals, depending on what time of the year it is.",
        "Liam: 300 to 600.",
        "Dr. DiSanto: We do vaccines and de-worming basics, but we also do all kinds of things. We have a lot of animals that get hit by cars, so we do a lot of x-rays, wound care.",
        "Liam: Oh, really?",
        "Dr. DiSanto: Pain medication.",
        "Liam: I think most people would not guess that you would go so far as to do x-rays and worry about car accidents and broken bones and things like that.",
        "Dr. DiSanto: Yes, absolutely.",
        "Liam: I imagine you can't do that for every animal all the time. I mean, that's got to get overwhelming at 300 to 600.",
        "Dr. DiSanto: Surgery is not every animal, but x-rays -- we do on animals that need it. We have so many animals coming in with fractures on a daily basis.",
        "Hope: When those animals come in, are they -- like, if they are hit by a car, is it because, like, an animal rescue has found this animal, or do the people say, \"oh, I just accidentally did this, and I'm bringing in this animal\"?",
        "Dr. DiSanto: It's usually that somebody found them injured on the street, or they call and have an officer bring them in and report an injured animal.",
        "Hope: That's sad to me.",
        "Liam: I don't think most people would know that happens that often.",
        "Hope: I would just hope that people would take responsibility.",
        "Liam: Okay, I want to ask you about this spaying and neutering thing, because I-I imagine that there's a lot of misconception about this out there. I don't think people quite understand just how important it is.",
        "Dr. DiSanto: In this part of Los Angeles and in other inner-city, like, metropolitan areas, there are a lot of stray dogs that still are not spayed and neutered, and a lot of people's pets aren't spayed and neutered. So, they're breeding. There's more and more animals coming into the shelter. It causes more euthanasia, which is what we don't want.",
        "Liam: Right.",
        "Dr. DiSanto: Um, and there's also health issues that can be prevented with spaying and neutering, like mammary cancer when the animals get older.",
        "Liam: Really?",
        "Dr. DiSanto: Male dogs could get prostate problems that could be prevented if they were neutered, rather than having to do it when they're older. People need to be educated at home on just the basics of taking care of their animals. They get overwhelmed. Um, there's not enough support out there for people in different areas and demographics, and then they turn their animal in when, if we could have got a little bit of prevention, we could have kept an animal out of the shelter.",
        "Woman: All right, come here, baby!",
        "Hope: Oh!",
        "Liam: Hello! You're so cute.",
        "Hope: Ohh. Hey.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Hope: Thank you so much for bringing me here.",
        "Liam: Of course.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You know what? I love you. I love you so much. I want you to always, always know that, and I will never stop fighting for you...ever. Ever, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I realize that there's still bad blood between you and Bill, and it's not easy for you to trust him.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: But Bill is going through a very difficult time right now.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Brooke: He desperately wants to spend more time with Will, so just give him one night. Let will stay there one night.",
        "Katie: No, Bill has had him all afternoon. That was the deal. I am not letting him spend the night.",
        "Brooke: Katie, you're not really being fair.",
        "Katie: Brooke, he's a toddler. He needs structure and consistency. We are on a schedule.",
        "Brooke: You're keeping Will away from his father.",
        "Katie: That is not my intention.",
        "Brooke: And you're keeping Bill away from this company.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Oh. Okay. That's not what happened. Bill created this situation, not me.",
        "Brooke: Do you even enjoy what you're doing here?",
        "Katie: Why would you ask me that question?",
        "Brooke: Because we all know there's one C.E.O. for Spencer Publications, and that's Bill. I even went to talk to Karen about it, but she seemed adamant to keep you in this position. So here I am. I've come to speak with you as your sister.",
        "Katie: Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Katie.",
        "Katie: Don't.",
        "Brooke: Please. You're happy. I'm happy. Ridge is happy. We're all happy with our jobs and what we're doing, but the only person that's miserable is Bill. He sits at home all day alone doing nothing. I mean, he built this company to what it is today.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Listen, I know that Bill lives for this company, and it must be very hard for him to sit at home all day long, but things have changed. We all have to make adjustments.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I think it's time for you to make an adjustment.",
        "Katie: Really? What would that be?",
        "Brooke: Bill has done his penance, and he did hurt you, but he's paid the price, and this is killing him. He wants to spend more time with his son. He wants to work. Katie, I'm just asking you to do what is fair. Give Bill equal custody to his son. Give him back his rightful place in this business. You know in your heart it's the right thing to do."
