{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7059 ~ Brooke & Eric disagree about Rick; Carter shares vital information with Ridge."], "Recap": ["Ridge tells Carter that he wants Rick and Maya out of here as much as anyone else, but this makes no sense and he does not believe it. Carter is saying Maya is transgender. Carter says he heard Maya herself and she admitted it. Nicole knows too so this is the truth and they have been sworn to secrecy as she does not want Rick to know. Rick tells Maya that Big Bear is so beautiful this time of year and they can celebrate he will find a reason if she needs one. She says he has been working so hard so she realizes he needs to get away. He tells her she is the one who is so elegant and has handled all the gossip and disgrace that she did not cause. His only obstacle is Ridge. Brooke and Eric discuss Rick proposing. She is a concerned mom and she wants him to be happy but he has not been divorced that long and this is happening so fast. Eric says Maya has had a tough life but that is no reason to reject her. Brooke surely has seen the change in Rick. Maya has helped there. They compliment each other and she has changed Rick from what he was before. She has been right by his side like others have not. He is on the fast track and he wants Maya with him. He needs her. Maya asks if Rick is okay with leaving Ridge alone here while they take their retreat. Rick mouths again how Ridge treated his mom when he was young and how many nights he saw his mom cry. He is pretty good on picking up on secrets until Maya came along .but she has integrity and honesty so none of that with Ridge bothers him now. His whole life has been building up to this and Ridge is not going to take the company from him.", "Carter states to Ridge this is the truth. And both of them know this is not the first transgender model .that doesn't matter to Ridge but this will come as quite a shock to Rick who places such a high value on honesty. Ridge says Ricky boy will be in for the shock of his life. Maya is hesitant but tells Rick that she wants to be everything he needs in a woman .and she is, so she is looking forward to Big Bear. Eric and Brooke agree they do not want Ridge to leave FC so they will sit down and talk to him. Rick has way too work to do so he has no time for a big wedding in the next few months but Eric will not stop the proposal. They can do that. Brooke says it won't be easy with the history of Rick and Ridge. Carter tells Ridge that is why he told him. They can not let Maya call all the shots. She let Rick fall for her and did not tell the truth. She kept much private and she is only going to tell him now after he proposes. He will have a meltdown and the company could be in trouble. Ridge admits he has already told his dad and Brooke he was leaving but he will take it from here. He will do what needs to be done. Maya walks in on Brooke and Eric and Eric tells her they put a lot of stock in her opinion and honesty. They hope she can give some good intake to Rick about Ridge and they can look out for each other and work together. Ridge gives it a good long time to think this over. Rick comes in while Ridge is looking at Rick's pictures. Ridge says he was just talking to Carter and it wasn't about business. Rick says he had to fight his way into this position but he is a happy man happier than he has ever been. But he admits that Ridge and Caroline have done an amazing job. Then there is Maya. She has given him something immeasurable she has been upfront and that means the world to him. Ridge says Rick will not like to hear this .Maya has not been open and upfront or honest about herself at all. He hesitates but finally says Maya is not who she says she is."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Rick: Carter, I-I'm, um...", "Carter: I know. It sounds crazy.", "Ridge: I-I want Rick and Maya out of here as -- as much as the next guy, but it's -- it's -- I don't -- that doesn't make any sense. I don't believe any of it. I'm sorry.", "Carter: I heard Maya and Nicole talking.", "Ridge: Well, you misinterpreted something.", "Carter: No, Ridge. I didn't misinterpret it. And when I confronted Maya, she admitted it was true. Maya is transgender.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: The sound of the wind through the trees, the fresh mountain air.", "Maya: Oh, it sounds lovely.", "Rick: It is. I want to share it with you.", "Maya: Big bear.", "Rick: Oh, and this time of year, it -- it's -- it is so beautiful. We'll celebrate.", "Maya: Celebrate what?", "Rick: [Smooches] I'll think of something.", "Maya: Oh, Rick. [Chuckles]", "Rick: Trust me when I say whatever you're going through, a trip to big bear will change everything. Everything, Maya.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Brooke, our son is in love. He's gonna propose. I mean, that's a good thing.", "Brooke: [Sighs] I hope so.", "Eric: Maya is totally committed to our son.", "Brooke: I don't doubt that. He's quite a catch for any young woman.", "Eric: [Chuckles] My, my, my. We've grown cynical, haven't we?", "Brooke: No, I'm not cynical, Eric. I just -- I'm a concerned mother. I want our son to be happy. And he and Maya -- they haven't been together that long. And his divorce to Caroline isn't even finalized yet.", "Eric: You've seen how he talks about her. He's totally in love with her.", "Brooke: Yes, yes. He adores her.", "Eric: She brings a great deal to his life, more than anyone he's ever been involved with.", "Brooke: It just seems kind of fast, doesn't it? I wonder if there's something about her.", "Eric: Maya's had a tough life, but that's no reason to reject her.", "Brooke: Oh, I'm not rejecting her. I just -- [Sighs] I wish Rick wasn't in such a rush.", "Eric: Rick needs stability now, and Maya brings that to him. You've seen the change in him, haven't you?", "Brooke: He is very confident, and Maya's been helpful. But you really brought the change in him.", "Eric: No, no, no. I don't take the credit for that. I've helped him, yes -- so has Maya and so have you. You know, whether you like it or not, the two of them are a formidable couple.", "Brooke: You obviously approve.", "Eric: Well, yes. I didn't at first. But they complement each other. I mean, she -- she brings a lot to him. She's -- she's changed him in a way that I've -- I've never seen before. You know, this is a very difficult position he's in -- a lot of responsibility, and she's been right by his side in a way that Ridge and the others have not been. He gives her a lot of credit for his success, and I have to say I agree.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: We so need this -- just to get away.", "Maya: You've been working so hard.", "Rick: Well, you've been under a lot of pressure, too.", "Maya: [Chuckles]", "Rick: You know, that cabin's been the setting for a lot of big events for my family.", "Maya: Really?", "Rick: Mm-hmm. Ask any Forrester. They all have their big bear story.", "Maya: What's yours?", "Rick: I'm thinking maybe we'll be creating one. Oh, but... you know, you've -- you've been through so much, and all the -- the accusations and the gossip -- and you've handled all of that with just so much grace. You're the quintessential woman, Maya -- so elegant, so nurturing, and...oh, so sensual.", "Maya: [Chuckles] You've been through a lot of obstacles, too, Rick.", "Rick: Yeah, but none that you've ever caused.", "Maya: Not yet.", "Rick: Not ever. The only obstacle that I have to deal with is Ridge.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Maya? Transgender? I-I don't -- what? I'm --", "Carter: Ridge, it's what she told me.", "Carter: Well...you guys were arguing, right?", "Carter: Arguing? What are you talking about? Arguing?", "Ridge: Well, she probably just blurted it out and -- and it was a-a zinger and it was a good one.", "Carter: What -- that -- that is not how it happened. Maya swore me to secrecy along with her sister. Ridge, I'm not making this up. Maya is freaking out because Rick doesn't know and Nicole has been pushing her to tell him. But now that things are looking good for Nicole, she doesn't want Rick to know either. It's the truth.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Well, I can see why he fell for Maya. But I still wonder if he should wait.", "Eric: Our son is not gonna wait for anything. And you can see what's going on at Forrester. Rick's on the fast track. He wants Maya with him.", "Brooke: Can't she be with him a while longer without wearing a wedding ring?", "Eric: [Sighs] That's not the way it's done in this family.", "Brooke: Oh, Eric, you're not that provincial.", "Eric: I'm not provincial. I'm traditional. A Forrester man needs a strong woman by his side. I had you. I had Stephanie. Rick needs Maya.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: You're okay? Leaving Forrester for this retreat?", "Rick: It'll still be here when we get back.", "Maya: Yeah, but you're comfortable leaving Ridge alone?", "Rick: Oh, he's been neutralized. Ridge is no longer a problem.", "Maya: Well, that must be a relief.", "Rick: [Sighs] You have no idea. For so many years, I picked up the pieces of our lives every time that -- that man walked out on us. It was not a happy time.", "Maya: You were young.", "Rick: Yeah. And he was Ridge, the pride of the pack, could do no wrong except to my mom and me. And I felt so helpless, you know? I so wanted to protect my mom. [Sighs] What could I do? I was just a kid. And he had this -- this ironclad hold on her heart. So many nights, I watched her cry. She tried to hide it, but she couldn't hide it from me -- not this kid, anyway. I'm pretty good at picking up, uh, on secrets. Until you came along.", "Maya: Rick... [Chuckles]", "Rick: No, I'm serious. Your integrity, your honesty -- I-I now finally have something to live for. I thought it was Caroline, but Ridge took her away from me.", "Maya: He's been taking from you your whole life. No more. He can't take me from you, Rick.", "Rick: And he's not gonna take Forrester away from me, because now I have everything. My whole life has been building up to this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: And you're positive about that? You're absolutely certain?", "Carter: Yes. She admitted it. And only because I overheard her talking to Nicole. She's not the first transgender model.", "Ridge: What? No, of course she's not. I know several. That's not -- that's not the point. [Sighs] Rick trusts her, and -- and he's -- man, he's gonna freak out when he finds out.", "Carter: Tell me about it.", "Ridge: No, you tell me about it. You were engaged to her, right? I-I -- and you didn't know this? This...must have been quite a shock.", "Carter: Yeah. Yeah, I was -- I was thrown, that's for sure. I'm still...wrapping my head around it, but... Maya's a woman -- emotionally, psychologically, physically. She's female. It just happens she arrived in a boy's body.", "Ridge: And Rick doesn't know?", "Carter: Nobody knows except me, Nicole, and now you.", "Ridge: I don't even know how he's gonna react. Oh, Ricky boy. You're in for the shock of your life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: I can't wait to get you up to that cabin.", "Maya: Never been to big bear.", "Rick: Well, not only is it beautiful, it's far from L.A. And all the drama.", "Maya: You're sure we can get away?", "Rick: Of course. I just have to clear the schedule. I mean, the pieces have to fall together. My dad's this close to making my position permanent. The company's stable, earnings are way up, and Ridge is where he's supposed to be -- in front of that drawing board and out of my hair. And...I have you. And we'll celebrate. And I know just how. You -- you are okay with this, right?", "Maya: Yeah. Of course I am. I just want to be everything that you need in a woman, Rick. And I am.", "Rick: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Rick has so much on his plate right now.", "Eric: All the more reason for him to have a strong woman by his side.", "Brooke: I don't disagree, but marriage? What we need to do is focus on Ridge and convince him not to quit.", "Eric: No, you're right. You're absolutely right. I don't want him quitting the company.", "Brooke: Neither do I.", "Eric: Well, I'll get him to reconsider. That's all. I'll talk to him. They -- they have to work together. We'll sit down, and we'll hash it out. He's not leaving the company.", "Brooke: So, you see my point, right?", "Eric: Yes.", "Brooke: Rick really needs to get his priorities straight. And getting engaged is not one of them. He has way too much work to do. He certainly can't be planning a wedding.", "Eric: No, no, he can't. There's months to go before that, but I'm not gonna discourage our son from getting engaged. He loves Maya, and she's 100% committed to him. I can't see any reason to talk him out of proposing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: Maya kept saying she'll tell him if and when Rick proposes, which can happen anytime now. Nicole was trying to convince her not to.", "Ridge: You know he's gonna lose his mind over this, right?", "Carter: He's not that stable to begin with. That's why I had to tell you. You can't quit. Rick leans on Maya. She's been propping him up ever since he took over. He depends on her.", "Ridge: I know he does. I know.", "Carter: Can you even begin to imagine what this will do to him? The fact that she didn't tell him, that she let him fall for her -- the guy's head over heels. I'm sure he bared his soul to her, but she didn't share everything. There is a very significant part of Maya's life she kept private, and he's only going to find out after he proposes.", "Ridge: He's not gonna be able to function.", "Carter: Function? [Chuckles] The guy could have a full-blown nervous breakdown. And if this ends up in the tabloids, Ridge... he won't be able to fulfill his responsibilities as CEO. The company could break. That is why this is not the time to think about leaving. You haven't told anyone, have you?", "Ridge: Yeah, I told my dad, Brooke, you.", "Carter: If word gets out, you know what could happen.", "Ridge: Lot of questions.", "Carter: It'll be a feeding frenzy. \"Ridge Forrester, the guy who gave this company its reputation, its head designer?\" That will hit us hard.", "Ridge: And then when Maya's story comes out, it's --", "Carter: Who knows? Once the thing starts unraveling, there may be no stopping it.", "Ridge: Okay. I'll take it from here.", "Carter: What are you gonna do?", "Ridge: What needs to be done.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door closes]", "Brooke: It's not going to be easy getting Rick and Ridge to see eye to eye.", "Eric: No. It never has been.", "Brooke: They have so much history.", "Eric: A shame, really. They're both so talented. Can you imagine if they were both pulling together?", "Brooke: I've imagined that for years. Part of the reason they haven't is because of me.", "Eric: No. Don't blame yourself. I'm a big reason for this mess.", "Brooke: I hate to see them at odds.", "Eric: I try to be supportive of both of them, which has gotten me into trouble with both of them.", "Brooke: If only they could --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Oh! Sorry. I left my notes in here.", "Eric: Maya, good. Uh, you know, we were just talking about Rick and Ridge.", "Maya: Oh. What about them?", "Brooke: Eric and I would like to see them working together again, and we know that you have influence over Rick.", "Eric: Mm-hmm.", "Maya: Not over Ridge.", "Eric: Rick values your input and -- and your honesty. You know, it would be a great service to the company if you could get Ridge and Rick onto the same page. Do you agree?", "Maya: I do. Yes.", "Eric: He puts a lot of stock in -- in your opinion and in your honesty.", "Maya: I know he does.", "Eric: If you were to help him work out his differences with Ridge, it would help the company immensely.", "Maya: Well, if I ever have the opportunity to do that, Mr. Forrester, I will.", "Eric: But you do have the opportunity now. I mean, you are the only person that Rick trusts implicitly.", "Brooke: They're brothers, Maya, family. They shouldn't be arguing and competing. They should be looking out for each other.", "Maya: I agree.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Rick: Handsome couple, aren't they?", "Ridge: Yeah. You look very happy.", "Rick: We were happy that day. Heck, we're happy a lot of the days. Something tells me you're not here to be looking at my pictures.", "Ridge: So, um... I was talking to Carter.", "Rick: Uh-huh. Something I should know about?", "Ridge: [Sighs] It wasn't about business.", "Rick: Disgusting, isn't it? All these pictures of Maya and me? I know that's what you're thinking. But I'm not gonna hide it, Ridge. I'm a happy man -- happier than I've been in, well, my entire life.", "Ridge: I can see that.", "Rick: But you know, it wasn't handed to me. I had to fight my way into this position. It's not easy getting to run the family business. And despite what you think, I am succeeding. But I do know that it's a team effort. You and Caroline -- you've done an amazing job. So has everyone else. And then there's this one. [Chuckles] You know, after amber and Caroline, I didn't think I could feel this way about a woman. Yeah, sure, she's beautiful, she's got a pretty smile, and she's sexy, but there's more to it than that. See, Maya's -- she's given me something that's immeasurable. She's given me her loyalty, her honesty. She's been up front with me, and that means more to me than anything, Ridge.", "Ridge: I'm, um...", "Rick: What?", "Ridge: [Sighs]", "Rick: What is it?", "Ridge: You're not gonna like what I have to say. Uh, Maya hasn't been...honest and open with you.", "Rick: Oh, please, Ridge.", "Ridge: She, uh -- she hasn't been truthful, not about herself. Maya's not who you think she is."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoqpa9ZlQ4"}
