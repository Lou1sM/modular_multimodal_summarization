    "Recap": [
        "Brooke tells Steffy that the Forrester men will pull this off. Steffy says yes even Zende wants to help. Zende tells Nicole that he wanted to prove that he could do more than take pictures. He wanted to design for them. They are in need of designers more than ever now and he was looking out for his future. He needs to know that he is not an afterthought to his family and that he can contribute. Nicole says he can talk to Eric but Zende says he does not want to count on him or his mom. She tells him he has overcome a lot already so she knows all his dreams will eventually come true. Bill confides in Wyatt that he is going to have that Spectra property one way or the other. Bill tells CJ that Sally will now be virtually broke so he can reclaim the property. When Katie and Brooke are together with Steffy she says she does not know what happened in Australia, maybe Brooke can fill her in. Bill tells Liam and Wyatt that Brooke's ring is on her finger and it will never come off again. She and Ridge are over for good.",
        "Brooke tells Katie they have had enough drama. There is no need for her to tell Eric or Bill anything. There is no need to give him something to hold over Ridge's head. Nicole is distracted and she tells Steffy her mind is on Zende. His meeting with her and Thomas did not go exactly as he planned. Steffy says she thinks it is great if he wants to design, but the timing right now is a little off. They just do not have the time to train him properly. At the outdoor restaurant Zende is having a drink when CJ walks up and introduces himself and sits down. CJ brings up the rivalry and Zende reminds him that his cousin did it again by stealing the designs. CJ says his cousin spent all she had by updating things and now she has nothing. He does not know any way to save it unless..... Zende knows someone who would want to take over an entire fashion place. Otherwise he has to turn the property over to this big shot. Brooke tells Katie that Ridge says he still loves her and will not give up and of course she has feelings for him too but not like with Bill. Bill walks in and says this time Brooke asked him to marry her not that it matters. Bill tells Brooke they have some wedding plans after his upcoming meeting. He wishes he could see the poser right now to see them so happy. He has waited on her forever and he never gave up. They are one step away from being husband and wife. He will always be there for her. She does not have to question that, forever and a day."

        "Brooke: Your father should sign off on this.",
        "Steffy: Oh, I will do it. He's busy sketching.",
        "Brooke: Eric and Thomas, too. It's pretty much their lives these days.",
        "Steffy: Spectra played dirty at Forrester's expense. Now we have to redo an entire collection. It's challenging, to say the least.",
        "Brooke: The Forrester men will pull it off.",
        "Steffy: Speaking of which, Zende offered to pitch in. Wanted to try his hand at design.",
        "Brooke: I thought his thing was photography.",
        "Steffy: He wants to expand his interest.",
        "Brooke: Does he show promise?",
        "Steffy: I mean, he's good, but he still needs to learn and grow. It can't just happen overnight.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure he understands that.",
        "Steffy: Actually, he was upset. He reacted in a way I never imagined Zende would.",
        "Zende: I wanted to prove to my family that I could do more than take pictures, that despite my lack of design experience that... we all got to start somewhere, right?",
        "Nicole: Maybe you should talk to your granddad or ridge. Steffy's not a designer.",
        "Zende: But Thomas is.",
        "Nicole: He didn't say you didn't have any talent, Zende.",
        "Zende: He also didn't provide a helping hand or any insight at all.",
        "Nicole: Look, we both know that everyone has been moving at warp speed to get the collection out.",
        "Zende: That's why I went to them! Look, Forrester is in need of designs more than ever! One chance! Look, I have dreams, too! For myself, for you, for us. We're trying to have a family, and I'm looking out for our future. But you know what? I'm starting to realize that it'll always be someone else, and I can't live that way, Nic. I need to know that I'm not an afterthought to my family.",
        "Bill: Sally's out on bail?",
        "C.J.: Yeah, Saul came up with the money.",
        "Bill: Who the hell's Saul?",
        "C.J.: Saul is --",
        "Bill: Oh, never mind. I don't give a damn.",
        "Wyatt: You don't give a damn about what?",
        "Bill: Oh, C.J. here tells me that Sally's been sprung. Some sap named Saul took pity on her.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so what does this mean for your... I mean, I'm sure you have a pet name for it now, but...",
        "Bill: Uh... don't ever refer to her as \"it.\" And as a matter of fact, I do have a pet name, and I'm not going to share that with you because it's just between us.",
        "Wyatt: What does this mean for your project downtown?",
        "Bill: Makes no difference one way or the other. I'm gonna have that property regardless of what happens with Sally.",
        "C.J.: You do realize that under the current contract I have with my cousin, if she comes up with the 100k, she can stay in the building.",
        "Bill: And what are the chances of that given the boatload of trouble she's in?",
        "C.J.: Well, she managed to pay shifty off before all that went down, so...",
        "Bill: That means she should be virtually broke and your contract will expire.",
        "Wyatt: And you'll finally get that land.",
        "Bill: Yes, I will. The only question is, which dignitaries will I invite to the groundbreaking ceremony? Or do I just hog all the limelight for myself... and her?",
        "Nicole: Maybe you should call your mom. Maybe she can talk with ridge or your granddad.",
        "Zende: I need to do this on my own.",
        "Nicole: I know. But ridge and Eric might feel differently about your work.",
        "Zende: Still, I don't want to involve my mom. Not that they would listen to her anyway.",
        "Nicole: Why?",
        "Zende: Come on. You know how sweet she is. Part of the reason she never had a chance at the company herself.",
        "Nicole: She felt overlooked, too?",
        "Zende: Probably. I mean, she never really expressed that to me. Still, she was all about me coming here and getting to know the rest of the family. Only I had expectations, you know.",
        "Nicole: Like what?",
        "Zende: Being fully accepted as a Forrester, even though I'm a Dominguez. How naive.",
        "Bill: Repeat after me. \"The second my contract with Sally expires, I will rush over to dollar bill's office and wrap this up.\"",
        "C.J.: Uh, the second my con--",
        "Bill: Perfect.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: Looks like everything's working out in your favor.",
        "Bill: Of course it is. And just think -- if yours truly hadn't written that review slamming Sally, I mean, that was the beginning of her demise.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Uh, does Liam know that it was you?",
        "Bill: No, and I don't want him to. You know Mr. Boy scout. He'll get his merit badge all bent out of shape.",
        "Liam: Merit what? What'd I miss?",
        "Wyatt: Actually, I was -- I was just about to ask dad about when he and Brooke are gonna do the deed.",
        "Liam: And by \"do the deed,\" you mean...",
        "Wyatt: Oh! Wedding day! What?",
        "Liam: Okay, just --",
        "Wyatt: Where you at?",
        "Liam: Just checking.",
        "Wyatt: So what's it gonna be? My brother and I have to, uh, plan you a bachelor party.",
        "Katie: Hey, Brooke. Uh, did you get my e-mail?",
        "Brooke: Me?",
        "Katie: No, no. Uh, Steffy. It was from Quinn, actually. She asked me to forward it.",
        "Steffy: She has Pam for that. Can't she find better uses for your time?",
        "Katie: Well, you know, we're still trying to figure things out, delineating duties and all that.",
        "Steffy: Uh, yeah, whatever. I still just think it's really weird.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Steffy: You and Quinn and ivy all working together. It's kind of like strange bedfellows.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, I guess you could say that. Where's ridge?",
        "Brooke: Sequestered somewhere designing furiously.",
        "Steffy: Which gives him an excuse to avoid my questions.",
        "Katie: What questions?",
        "Steffy: He said he's not giving up on Brooke. I just don't know what happened in Australia, what stopped you from marrying my dad. Care to clue me in?",
        "Nicole: I still think you should talk to your granddad.",
        "Zende: Why? So he can tell me I'm making a big deal over nothing?",
        "Nicole: So you can let him know how you feel. Eric's a good man.",
        "Zende: Which is why he would say all the right things, how I'm his grandson and how proud he is of me. But come on, Nicole. As much as we all want to say I'm a Forrester, I'm not like them.",
        "Nicole: But you are a Forrester.",
        "Zende: I just... I just wonder if I'll, uh, if I'll ever be fully accepted.",
        "Nicole: You're an amazing guy, Zende. And I'm not just saying that because I'm your wife and I love you. I'm saying it because it's true. You have overcome things that people can't even imagine. And it's only made you stronger and more determined, which is why I know that you're going to figure this out. I believe in you. And I believe that your dreams, our dreams, are gonna come true.",
        "Liam: So, don't take this the wrong way. Are you absolutely sure about this?",
        "Bill: Are you referring to marrying Brooke?",
        "Liam: No one's putting her down. I'm just saying there is a history there of her --",
        "Bill: Are you trying to -- is he trying to antagonize me?",
        "Wyatt: No, no, we both know that you never stopped loving Brooke.",
        "Bill: And Brooke never stopped loving me.",
        "Liam: Sure.",
        "Bill: She just got... \"lost in the past,\" as she puts it, and that pretty much explains the whole deal.",
        "Liam: So no more woman in the middle.",
        "Bill: No more woman in the middle. Brooke is wearing my engagement ring, and it will never come off her finger again. That poseur blew it. He and Brooke are done. For good.",
        "Katie: You're still wearing it.",
        "Brooke: My engagement ring from bill?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I mean, not that I thought you wouldn't be. It's just that things change so quickly around here.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, like you coming to work at Forrester creations.",
        "Katie: Please don't tell me that bothers you as much as it bothers Quinn.",
        "Brooke: It wouldn't bother Quinn anymore if you meant what you said.",
        "Katie: What was it I said?",
        "Brooke: Don't be coy, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hey, I guess if Quinn and ridge stay away from each other, there's no reason for me to tell anyone, especially not Eric. And don't worry about me telling bill. I'm sure he would love to hold that over ridge's head.",
        "Brooke: We've all had enough drama.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Is it really over, though? I mean, despite what happened in Australia, are you really ready to let ridge go? If not, it doesn't bode well for your drama-free future.",
        "Steffy: My followers keep asking about my wedding photos, which got me thinking. If we release them, maybe we can tie it into the new collection. We could show my wedding dress for hype. Hey. You okay?",
        "Nicole: Um... I just... I spoke with Zende. And I know that his meeting with you and Thomas didn't exactly go how he hoped it would. And I know he also may have said some things.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it definitely surprised us. I just... I thought he was happy here.",
        "Nicole: He is. He just...wants to tackle new things.",
        "Steffy: I get that. And I want you to know, I love you and I love Zende. You guys are family. And if he wants to design, that's great. It's just that the timing is a little off. You see that, right?",
        "C.J.: You know what? I got to go. Zende Forrester.",
        "Zende: Yeah.",
        "C.J.: C.J. Garrison. My cousin's Sally spectra. Mind if I sit? [Clears throat] Excuse me. Uh, I'll have whatever he's having. Lot of drama going on in the L.A. fashion scene lately, huh?",
        "Zende: What?",
        "C.J.: The Forrester/Spectra rivalry. After all these years, I never thought I'd see it again.",
        "Zende: Your cousin stole our entire collection.",
        "C.J.: Okay, but don't blame me, man. Look, I just own the building. Honestly, I didn't know, and I had nothing to do with it. Though I do kind of understand why Sally did it, you know. She spent a ton of money upgrading that building. It was her dream. Everything she had was on the line. It doesn't justify it, but now I have a full fashion house up and running, but it will probably have to close because I don't have a designer to run it.",
        "Wyatt: All right, sounds good. I'll run it by legal before we show the old man.",
        "Liam: Hey, speaking of which, that -- that meeting dad has outside the building.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm?",
        "Liam: That's Brooke, right?",
        "Wyatt: Of course.",
        "Liam: Okay, see, why wouldn't he just say that?",
        "Wyatt: I don't -- you know him! He's just keeping things under wraps.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] It's not like it's a secret that he loves her.",
        "Wyatt: This is true.",
        "Brooke: Can we please not do this?",
        "Katie: I'm just trying to give you someone to talk to. You know, this is a difficult situation.",
        "Brooke: Ridge and I share a child together, and we have a long history together, so yes, of course there are feelings there. He said he wasn't giving up and that he still loves me.",
        "Katie: And here you are again caught in the middle of two very desirable men.",
        "Brooke: I really thought that ridge and I had one last chance, and then Australia happened. There is no way I am going to overlook what Quinn and ridge did.",
        "Katie: Especially since you can't be sure that it won't happen again. Still, when bill proposed to you this time...",
        "Bill: Correction. Brooke proposed to me.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Bill: Your sister popped the question, and I said yes. Although it really doesn't matter who asked whom. Of course, having said that, uh, the dressmaker would certainly pop a gasket if he knew who did the asking. So, can I tell him, or do you want to do it?",
        "Steffy: I get what you're saying, and I get that Zende wants it all. But we're still recovering from the spectra hit. And we just don't have the time to train him properly. It's nothing against him. Can you, um, help him understand that?",
        "Zende: So, what's your take on spectra closing up shop?",
        "C.J.: Well, it's not what my mom wants. I mean, that's for sure. But there's this hotshot who's hungry to develop the property offered me a lot of money for it, and I don't know, man. I just don't think there's a way to save the place unless...",
        "Zende: Unless what?",
        "C.J.: Well, wouldn't happen to know someone who wants an entire fashion house ready to go, would you? All it needs is a designer and a dream. Plus a little bit of cash, pay the bills, keep the old gal afloat. You know, I got to say, I still think there's a lot of value in the spectra brand. [Sighs] But I guess you don't have to worry about stuff like that, right? Lucky to be a Forrester.",
        "Zende: Not too sure about that.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "C.J.: Uh, I got to go. But it was nice chatting with you, man. Take care.",
        "Wyatt: You know, got to admire dad.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Liam: Oh, you don't have to do that. He's not here.",
        "Wyatt: No, I'm serious. Just like the way that he never gives up.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that's true. I do really respect him for that.",
        "Wyatt: Like with Brooke, talk about proving your loyalty and commitment to her.",
        "Liam: It is nice seeing him happy again.",
        "Wyatt: And through all the obstacles they've had to overcome, it's their time to be together now. And dad will make sure of it.",
        "Katie: Okay, well, I'm gonna get back to work. Wouldn't want Quinn writing me up for goofing off. See you.",
        "Brooke: Bye.",
        "Bill: Hi, beautiful.",
        "Brooke: Hey.",
        "Bill: We got some wedding plans to make, don't we?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, we sure do.",
        "Bill: How about we meet up at Il Giardino later and we can lock down the details.",
        "Brooke: How about we do it right now?",
        "Bill: I would love to do it right now, but I have a meeting. Though I would like to see that poseur walk in here while we're planning our nuptials. You don't think he's planning to be my best man, do you?",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] No, I don't think so. I think that's the last thing.",
        "Bill: Yeah, you're probably right about that.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I love that smile. That little giggle. I would have waited for you forever. Never given up. Even when you were about to get married in Australia, deep down, I just believed, \"it ain't gonna happen. I won't let it happen.\" Now here we are. You're wearing my engagement ring. We are one step from being husband and wife, fulfilling our destiny, the life that we've waited so long for. Think back, gorgeous. All the incredible times we've shared. I'll always be here for you, Brooke. You'll never have to question my feelings. You'll never have to question my commitment. I'm yours. Forever and a day."
