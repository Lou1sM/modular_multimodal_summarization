        "Ridge: Logan, if you walk out that door -- if you leave this company now -- we may never get back what we had.",
        "Brooke: Your mother's never going to let us run Forrester.",
        "Stephanie: She's got a point.",
        "Ridge: Will you stay out of this?",
        "Brooke: She can't, Ridge. She's been trying to get rid of me for so long that it's become a compulsion for her. Well, I'm sick of it. I've had enough. It's finally here, Stephanie. The day that you've dreamed about ever since you've known me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: You know, Stephanie cannot get away with this.",
        "Bridget: She's not going to. She won't.",
        "Dante: Bridget, all she has to do is fire me. Then I'll lose my work visa and I'll have to go back to Italy.",
        "Bridget: You know what, I'm gonna call my dad.",
        "Dante: What's he going to do? She owns the business. She can do whatever she wants.",
        "Bridget: That's just it. This is all about what Stephanie wants. It's not about what Felicia wants. It's not what's best for Dino. And any judge on a bench is going to be able to see that.",
        "Dante: I need a lawyer.",
        "Bridget: And I'll make sure you get the best possible one.",
        "Dante: You know what, I want to thank you. You have no idea how much your support means to me.",
        "Bridget: Well, you're Dino's father. You deserve to play a huge part in his life. And I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure that happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I want those containers off the ship. My people have schedules to keep. Remember, time, money. Time, money. You understand me? Good, I was hoping you'd say that.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Taylor: Your assistant said I could come on in.",
        "Nick: When we talk, bad things happen.",
        "Taylor: Listen, I want to apologize. You know, I still think I did the right thing telling you that Ridge and Brooke slept together. But I never should have implied that she wasn't being completely honest --",
        "Nick: I never believed you anyway.",
        "Taylor: It's just that I know -- okay, listen -- as a psychiatrist and a woman, I am very ashamed, all right? When it comes to a woman's past, no matter how suspect it is, with the issue of rape, it's just not acceptable. So I'm sorry. How is she?",
        "Nick: Everybody's fine.",
        "Taylor: You're not going to let it affect your relationship?",
        "Nick: No. She just can't be around him anymore.",
        "Taylor: Well, I don't know how that's going to happen. They do work together at Forrester Creations.",
        "Nick: Well, she's over there dealing with that now.",
        "Taylor: And you're not the slightest bit worried that Ridge might try to persuade her to stay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Brooke, I don't care what my mother thinks or wants anymore. All I care about is you.",
        "Ridge: You forgave me.",
        "Brooke: But Nick never will. Not ever.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's between the two of you.",
        "Brooke: He doesn't want me working here.",
        "Ridge: What? He's telling you what to do now? Who the hell does he think he is?",
        "Brooke: He's my future.",
        "Ridge: Don't say that.",
        "Stephanie: Why don't you listen to what she's telling you?",
        "Ridge: Just back off, will you?",
        "Brooke: She can't, Ridge. That's impossible. I realize that now. What I dreamed of, my idea of having your mother respect me -- that was just a fantasy. That's something that's never going to happen. And you and I will never happen, either.",
        "Ridge: Because of her?",
        "Brooke: Nothing I ever did was good enough.",
        "Ridge: That's her problem, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: It made me miserable, Ridge. And I can't live that way anymore. You knew how much I loved your son. You knew how happy we were when we were together. And most mothers -- normal mothers -- would have been thrilled. But you weren't. And now, you don't have to be. I'm through fighting, Stephanie. You win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: I think we should call your dad and find a lawyer right now.",
        "Bridget: Wait, I -- I don't know that it's going to come to that. We know that Felicia doesn't want to be apart from her baby. We understand that. But I believe she's got to understand where we're coming from, too. We all love that child. I'm sure we can work something out. After all, Dino wouldn't be the only one that's heartbroken if you got deported.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Taylor, Ridge can do whatever he wants, but it won't do any good.",
        "Taylor: Brooke's been known to change her mind.",
        "Nick: She won't change her mind. Listen, I know you want to believe that Ridge left you because he and Brooke have some kind of -- call it what you like -- undeniable love.",
        "Taylor: So it can't be true if she's with you.",
        "Nick: And she will be forever and there's nothing anyone can say or do to change that now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Brooke, you said this wasn't about my mother. Why are you conceding to her?",
        "Stephanie: It makes her the victim.",
        "Ridge: Oh, Mother, stop it! Will you just leave her alone.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, you're talking to a woman who faked a heart attack to keep us apart. Who pretended to be my friend, and then turned her back on me the minute Taylor came back in town. She gave me a gun, told me to shoot myself!",
        "Ridge: We'll leave L.A. We'll move to Paris. We'll work out of the office there -- the international office.",
        "Brooke: My life is here, with Nick.",
        "Ridge: Logan, you wouldn't even be with him if my mother hadn't broken us up.",
        "Brooke: Maybe. Maybe we would still be married. We'd be running this company. We'd be raising our children.",
        "Ridge: This is their legacy. Come on, we have a duty to protect it.",
        "Brooke: That's not the only reason you want me to stay. This is where we began. This is where we click. Heads bent over the design table. Taking our bows at the end of the runway. This is where our love affair began, Ridge. And it only seems fitting that this is where it should end.",
        "Ridge: No, no, no, no, no, no!",
        "Brooke: I will never forget our accomplishments here. And part of me will always wonder what more we could have done together.",
        "Ridge: But you don't have to wonder, Brooke. You don't have to wonder. We can keep going. Come on.",
        "Brooke: A part of me will always, always love you. But I have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Hey. I thought we could both use something to unwind a little bit.",
        "Bridget: Oh, thank you.",
        "Dante: You're welcome.",
        "Bridget: You know what I was just thinking about?",
        "Dante: That we should be in Italy right now?",
        "Bridget: I was! I was just -- yeah, I was thinking about our trip.",
        "Dante: You know, I was so excited to introduce you to my family. You have no idea.",
        "Bridget: I was so looking forward to meeting them.",
        "Dante: And you will. I promise.",
        "Bridget: I was also really looking forward to spending some time with you -- alone. I know I don't say this very often, but I love being here with you. I love sharing this house with you. I love taking care of Dino with you. It's really healed me, I guess.",
        "Dante: That's all I could ask for.",
        "Bridget: I know that you want more, though. And I haven't really been here for you the way that you would like me to be. Because I wasn't ready.",
        "Dante: I'll wait as long as I have to.",
        "Bridget: I don't want to wait any longer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Organize an entirely new transport system. Equalize dock and load, both domestic and abroad. What happened?",
        "Brooke: Well, I did it. I walked away from Forrester Creations. Ridge begged me to stay, but I left anyway.",
        "Nick: Well, that's what you wanted.",
        "Brooke: I just didn't expect it to feel this way. He was so hurt. I told him that my future was with you. But I still care about him. I'm sorry, I -- I know that you want me to be relieved. And I am on one level. But on the other, I just don't think that --",
        "Nick: Brooke -- I want you to be happy. I've got a surprise for you.",
        "Brooke: Surprise?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I know this is hard. But I'll take care of you. I'll help you get past this. It's time to move on with your life, honey. You've got to find someone new. Someone who's really worthy of you.",
        "Ridge: Someone like you? Brooke said it was a compulsion. I think it's a lot worse. You're obsessed, Mother. And not with Brooke. You're obsessed with me.",
        "Stephanie: I love you.",
        "Ridge: You're suffocating me with your love. Your strangling me with it.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, all I've ever tried to do was protect you.",
        "Ridge: You tried to keep me all to yourself.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, that's Brooke's perspective. Please, when you were married to Taylor --",
        "Ridge: Taylor was your surrogate. Your best friend. She's the one that embodied everything you valued and admired.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, that's true.",
        "Ridge: It's always been about you.",
        "Stephanie: No. And do not let Brooke twist my concerns and my love for you into something that they're not.",
        "Ridge: What kind of mother makes it her life's purpose to deprive her son of the one thing in the world that he wants most? Introducing the new side sampler from pizza hut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: I hoped for so long.",
        "Bridget: I know. I know.",
        "Dante: You're so beautiful. I want you, Bridget.",
        "Bridget: And I want you, too. What? What?",
        "Dante: Hold on a second.",
        "Bridget: Oh. Did you need to get something out of the nightstand?",
        "Dante: Something I've been saving for a moment like this. Give me your hand.",
        "Bridget: Dante!",
        "Dante: Bridget, I want you now and forever. Will you marry me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Your bags are packed and onboard. My mother and Catherine are with both of the kids right now. Come, come, come, come, come. That means R.J. and Hope are tucked away under their little sheets, asleep. Hey, captain, lets get this bird in the air, shall we?",
        "Brooke: You still haven't told me where we're going.",
        "Nick: Where would you like to go?",
        "Brooke: Forward. With you.",
        "Nick: Oh. Guess what? We can do that.",
        "Brooke: And if there happens to be a gorgeous beach and a fruity drink somewhere along the way, that wouldn't be bad, either.",
        "Nick: Well, that would be my thoughts exactly.",
        "Brooke: You have no idea how much I need this.",
        "Nick: I do know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: The heart attack. The gun. Years of insults and abuse. I thought you'd finally stop. I thought you'd finally realize that Brooke made me happy. You always said you wanted me to be happy.",
        "Stephanie: I do.",
        "Ridge: If you did, Brooke wouldn't have left.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, she chose Nick.",
        "Ridge: Because she knew you wouldn't accept my choice. Even though I chose her over and over and over again!",
        "Stephanie: It was never going to work out.",
        "Ridge: Because of you! If you'd just given us your support --",
        "Stephanie: You do not need Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Yes, I do! Damn it, I do. That's the one thing you never understood, mother, is I do need her. I've always needed her. Brooke has given me more love and compassion than anyone in my life. You took her away from me.",
        "Stephanie: She was never good enough for you. Look what she's done.",
        "Ridge: Look what you've done. Disrespecting the woman I love, mother, for years. How many times did I plead with you to accept her? You just wouldn't accept her, no matter how much I asked you to.",
        "Stephanie: I do love you, baby.",
        "Ridge: I haven't been your baby for a very long time. Look at me. All these years that I've wasted. When I think what I've put myself through with Brooke, Taylor and my kids -- how I let myself be manipulated and controlled by you for so long. Brooke was my life. My life. And you couldn't accept her. Now she's gone. You've taken my life!",
