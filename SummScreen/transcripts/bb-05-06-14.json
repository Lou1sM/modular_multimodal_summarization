        "Bill holds Will sleeping in his lap and says this is the way it should be and he owes it all to Brooke. He will spend the rest of his life proving he is good enough to be with her. Quinn tells Liam to give it his best shot. All he has managed to do is stall the inevitable as Hope will go back to Wyatt. Liam tells her to get a life so she doesn't have to meddle in Wyatt's love life. It's creepy. He's a big ass man now. She's a rather fascinating woman in her own way so just find a man, any man except his dad. He knows all about that but she was just a distraction when he was drunk and meant nothing. Brooke is taking up all that space now. He even tells her that Brooke was responsible for Bill getting back his company so Quinn doesn't have to waste her time sleeping with Bill. Katie is shocked but Ridge repeats it. He wants Katie to marry him. He hasn't been able to take a breath for years and now he can take a breath with her. He doesn't have a speech or a ring but he's here. He takes a red ribbon and wraps it around her ring finger to remind her. And no matter what anybody else says they are meant to be together. She wants to make sure this is not just to make up for her bad day. Ridge Forrester trying to make his girl feel better by offering marriage. He says it is a leap of faith and good for both of them. He'll catch her if she jumps and falls. Brooke tells Bill that she wishes Katie had been more reasonable and she did not have to pull out the papers and betray her. Bill says he is sorry too as he know hard she worked to repair that relationship. All this time Brooke has been protecting him and he didn't even know it. Katie asks Ridge to repeat the question. He gets down on bended knee and asks her to marry him. She gets down with him and says yes she will. Nothing can stop her. She loves him and will gladly be his wife and she will be with him too if he should ever fall.",
        "Quinn drops in on Bill and quips that he is back on his throne. He says it was a good day until she walked in. She returns that Brooke sure must think a lot of Bill to do this. She really came through for him. But everybody has a breaking point like when someone lies to your face or cheats on you. Bill says first of all, Brooke was about to marry Ridge so he did not cheat on Brooke. And he's not going to fall for this blackmail. She says it is not blackmail. She just wants him to give Wyatt his name. He's not a thug. He's as good as his other son, Liam. Give him his name and support Wyatt in his quest for Hope. For that she will keep quiet to Brooke about their \"just sex\". And it is funny how men and women have a different view of the same events. Brooke goes to Katie's who asks why she is here now. Did she forget to take something else away from her? Then sweetly she says that is all in the past. She doesn't want to harbor grudges. Brooke is shocked when Katie tells her that Ridge proposed and she is going to be Mrs. Ridge Forrester."

        "Katie: You want me to marry you?",
        "Ridge: Yes. I want you. I want this. I want whatever comes next. I want you to be my wife. Say you'll marry me.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: It doesn't get any better than this. Rocking my son to sleep. This is how it's gonna be from now on. Hanging out with Daddy in his office, spending weeks at a time together. And all because of you. And you did this at great personal expense, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Katie was being punitive. And I was really concerned about what it was doing to you. I had the power to change it. So I did.",
        "Bill: You gave me my life. You took it back from Katie, damaging your relationship with her in the process. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life showing you that I'm worthy of what you've done for me.",
        "Brooke: You've already proven yourself. For the first time in my life, I have no doubts about the man that I'm with. I am a believer...in us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Here's my suggestion for you. Make the most out of the time you've bullied out of Hope. Savor it. Hell, give -- give forever your best shot.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I don't need your permission for that.",
        "Quinn: Well, I'm just saying don't be a sore loser when it all blows up in your face, and Hope goes back to Wyatt, because, you know, she will, Liam. I mean, all you've managed to do is stall the inevitable.",
        "Liam: Okay, well, if you're done, I have a suggestion for you now. Get a life. That's it. Get a life. That way you don't have to be so wrapped up in your son's. It's creepy. Find a man to focus on. Really. Any man. Anywhere. As long as it's not my dad.",
        "Quinn: Why would you bring up Bill? You know your father and I don't get along.",
        "Liam: Getting along isn't necessarily a requirement. Look, the point is you have a lot of misdirected energy. Wyatt's not your little baby boy anymore. He's a grown-ass man, capable of making grown-ass decisions. Or at least he should be able to.",
        "Quinn: I think Wyatt is doing just fine.",
        "Liam: Really? Then how come you can't stop meddling? I'm serious! I mean, look at you. You're -- you're a... weirdly interesting, vital woman. Get out there! You know? Find a man who's gonna give you all the things that you weren't getting from my father.",
        "Quinn: There's Bill again! Fascinating. Why -- why does he keep slipping into this conversation?",
        "Liam: Oh, for God's sake, Quinn, I know, okay?",
        "Quinn: Know?",
        "Liam: I know about you and my dad, about your little... [Groans] ...romp. He was drunk, it didn't mean anything, and he has no room for you in his life because Brooke is filling up all that space. Now more than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bill: Come in.",
        "Alison: It's time to take --",
        "Bill: Come on, big boy. [Grunts] Go put him down for his nap.",
        "Brooke: He doesn't like to leave without this.",
        "Alison: Oh. Okay.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] You okay?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah. It's just...strange, you know? I've been in this office so many times and that same scenario has played out, only with Katie and Adele. I can imagine my sister's not very happy with me right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I can't believe this.",
        "Ridge: We can start new, we can start fresh. Open and honest, just how we want our lives. And... [Sighs] ...I know I've said \"I love you\" to somebody else, and it didn't really work out. And I've made promises to somebody else and that didn't really work out, either, but I kind of feel this is different. It is different. You know it's different. I haven't been able to take a breath for years. God, that sounds silly.",
        "Katie: No, it doesn't. It doesn't.",
        "Ridge: I can finally breathe again with you. And I knew that when I came back from Europe and I saw you. I saw you... [Sighs] ...For maybe the first time. And... [Sighs] I didn't -- I don't want to ask you like this -- just -- [Sighs] I don't have a speech. Obviously, I don't have a ring. I'm just here. Do you remember -- when you were a kid, do you remember taking a string and tying it around your finger to remind you of something?",
        "Katie: [Chuckling] Yes.",
        "Ridge: I do, too. So that's what this is. This is to remind you that I'm here -- for you. And this is to remind you that sometimes your biggest heartache turns out to be your greatest blessing. And this is to remind you that no matter what anybody else says, we're meant to be together.",
        "Katie: [Sniffles] [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Because I love you, Katie Logan.",
        "Katie: [Sniffles]",
        "Ridge: More than life itself. And my greatest gift is that I know that you love me, too. Just say you'll marry me.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles, sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Something happened between Bill and Brooke?",
        "Liam: Yeah. [Chuckles] Brooke found a way to give my dad everything that he's been wanting lately -- his company back, equal custody of Will, and, finally, Brooke herself. Imagine -- just imagine -- how he feels about her now. So don't waste your time by sniffing around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I love my sister. You know how much. But she can be so obstinate.",
        "Bill: Oh, you're telling me.",
        "Brooke: I really tried to get her to see it from your point of view.",
        "Bill: I'll bet that floated like a lead balloon.",
        "Brooke: Oh, pretty much. So then I catered to her sense of fairness. \"How do you think if you have 1% of Spencer Publications that you're entitled to the C.E.O. position? And do you feel badly about that?\" And you know what? I think she does feel bad. But she's so stubborn, she wouldn't even budge. So I had to pull out the papers.",
        "Bill: Well, your timing couldn't have been better. This company needs me. You got me back here just in time to steer it away from the cliff. Katie was in way over her head, and too stubborn to take a way out.",
        "Brooke: Well, she is pretty serious with the business and the company.",
        "Bill: Listen, Katie has an aptitude for business and she belongs in the corporate world, but she does not belong in my office.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I wonder what she's gonna do now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: It's not much of a ring.",
        "Katie: It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.",
        "Ridge: Yeah? Well, you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Are you doing this to make me feel better?",
        "Ridge: What do you mean?",
        "Katie: It's just that I -- I -- I'm sorry. I believe you when you say that you love me. I just feel like I've been on a roller coaster ride. I'm up one minute and then I'm down and now I'm -- I'm up again, and I just -- I can't think straight.",
        "Ridge: What do you want me to say?",
        "Katie: Nothing. You've -- you've said it. [Chuckles] I just -- I want to be sure that -- that -- that this isn't just to make up for today. This really bad day. That this isn't Ridge Forrester trying to make his girl feel better by proposing marriage.",
        "Ridge: And you think I would do that?",
        "Katie: Maybe.",
        "Ridge: Well, then... this is up to you. It's a leap of faith. But if you jump, it's got to be with both feet.",
        "Katie: So that's what this is, a leap of faith?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Jump in with both feet. [Chuckles] What if I fall?",
        "Ridge: I'm here. I'll catch you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Katie must be reeling. In five minutes, everything she fought so hard to hang onto... was gone.",
        "Bill: You said yourself it was time. She stole my company, she took my son, and all because I fell in love with you. Well, Katie got a good, long run out of it, didn't she?",
        "Brooke: I just wish she had been more reasonable. I wish I didn't have to force the issue. I brought those papers out and Katie knew exactly what was going on. Not only did it change the dynamic with you, but she knew that I was betraying her once again. Choosing you over her.",
        "Bill: Thank you, Brooke. I know how hard you worked to repair your relationship.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. No, and it was progressing. But who knows now what's gonna happen.",
        "Brooke: Oh, you know, I -- I'm not going to be passive. I am going to go over there and I'm gonna talk to Katie. And I'm gonna get her to understand.",
        "Bill: I don't think she'll hear you. But I respect your need to try. In the meantime, you know what I'm going to be doing?",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Bill: Being Dollar Bill, running my company, waiting for Alison to come through that door with my son so I can -- I can take him home. And that's all because of you. All this time you've been protecting me and I didn't even know it.",
        "Brooke: I didn't even know it, either. And you never gave up on us. Because our bond is there, no matter how far apart we were. That connection never went away. And nothing or no one is ever gonna change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. That wasn't fair. I shouldn't have asked you now.",
        "Katie: I think you should just repeat the question.",
        "Ridge: Katie Logan...",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: ...Will you marry me?",
        "Katie: Yes. Yes, I will. Nothing could keep me from it. I love you. And I can't wait to be your wife. I will take that leap of faith. I will jump in with both feet. And I will be there to catch you if you ever fall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Look at you. Back on the throne!",
        "Bill: And my day was going so well.",
        "Quinn: Ruling your empire.",
        "Bill: As it should be.",
        "Quinn: But you couldn't make it happen. Brooke did. But, you know, you must be doing something right because Brooke is obviously crazy about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I'm not sure how she did it, but I heard Brooke really came through for you.",
        "Bill: She is remarkable.",
        "Quinn: Yes. She is. But, you know, everybody's got a breaking point, right? I mean, you know, when someone makes a huge sacrifice for someone and then they find out that that someone may not be worthy, like they were lying to your face or cheating on you.",
        "Bill: First of all... Brooke was about to marry that loser, so what happened between us can't be classified as cheating. We had sex. That's it. Second, I've had it with the blackmailing.",
        "Quinn: Blackmail? I'm not blackmailing you. I'm merely suggesting an even exchange. You give Wyatt your name, support his relationship with Hope, and I keep my lips permanently sealed about our little sexcapades. I don't even understand why this is even a discussion. Wyatt is as much your son as Liam is. He's not a thug, he's not undesirable. I mean, you would think that you'd want him to carry your name and be happy to see him with the woman he loves. I realize that my timing here kind of sucks, right? Because, I mean, you just got back everything you thought you had lost, because of Brooke. I mean, you must be so grateful to her.",
        "Bill: Stop talking about Brooke.",
        "Quinn: Why? I'm just -- I'm happy for you. I mean, it's a statement, right? That -- that Brooke trusts you and she believes in you, and, well, I mean, it would be a shame if anything were to happen to change that.",
        "Bill: I'm warning you, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: What? Okay. I mean, you have waited so long for this woman. I mean, it almost drove you nuts, right? And patience not being your strong suit, which I completely understand because it isn't my strong suit, either, and, honestly, this between us, this is going on way, way, way too long, too. So, you know, I'm just gonna ask you one more time, really super nice. Give Wyatt your name, support his personal goals, and I will not say a word about the \"just sex\" we had. It's interesting, right? How different men and women perceive things. I mean, according to you, what happened between us in your bedroom was meaningless. But...",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: ...I wonder if Brooke would see it the same way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: [Sighs] What are you doing here? Is there something else that you forgot to take from me?",
        "Brooke: That is a misconception that I would like to clear up. I restored Bill's rightful place in the company and in Will's life, but, Katie, really, it wasn't an action taken against you.",
        "Katie: Really?! Because it felt kind of personal.",
        "Brooke: Well, I have to say the way Bill got you to sign the papers, that was wrong. That was a mistake. He shouldn't have.",
        "Katie: A mistake? God, what is with you and that word? Bill slept with me, Brooke. He slept with me to get me to sign those papers. And now that he's sleeping with you, you're doing his dirty work for him. You made us all believe that you had destroyed those papers, only to whip them out when they served your interests.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] His interests.",
        "Katie: Which are yours now, right? [Chuckles] Whatever. It's okay. You're gonna realize soon enough the kind of man you're dealing with. Listen, [Sighs] since you're here, I packed a bag for Will. I was gonna send it over, but you can just take it. I outlined his schedule. I hope I don't have to express to you how important it is that he stick to it. It's gonna help with the transition. And... as for the company...",
        "Brooke: Is there something you would like me to tell Bill?",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I've decided to let go of my anger. I don't want to live like that anymore.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I'm fine with Bill having equal custody of Will. I just want to make sure that he's secure.",
        "Brooke: Oh. That's great.",
        "Katie: I'm starting over. [Chuckles] I'm embarking on a new adventure. And it's exciting. I just needed to be reminded of that.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Good. I'm -- I'm happy for you.",
        "Katie: I hope you will be. Because Ridge proposed to me. We're going to be married. I'm going to be Mrs. Ridge Forrester."
