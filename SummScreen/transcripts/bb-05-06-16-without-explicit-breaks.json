        "In a panic Caroline tells Katie to just forget what she said. Katie is aghast that Caroline said Thomas was the sperm donor. Caroline says this is not open for discussion with her or anyone else. Katie states Thomas has to know. Deacon quizzes Quinn and asks if she went to see Liam why she is not in prison or reunited with him. She reveals he was expecting Steffy when she saw him. Deacon says it is now Liam Spencer not Adam and she needs to get real. This is her son's half brother, he is a wuss and she does not need him. She says he is a gentleman and Deacon could learn from him; some respect. He tells her that gentleman will land her in prison. Rick shows up for a meeting and tells Ridge he certainly can take time off for paternity leave but Thomas says his dad can handle all of it at same time. Liam goes to see Bill and says as weird as it sounds he felt safe around Quinn. He loved her as a wife; she did not abuse him. Bill says rest assured she will go to prison for a long time and he will make it happen. Rick tells Ridge he can keep up his guard but his chokehold on the company will come around and he will be gone. Rick listens and says he hears footsteps and it is karma coming to get him. Katie comes in as Rick leaves and tells Ridge that he owes her an apology. She knows that Thomas is the father of Caroline's baby. He lied to her about that. Pushed against the wall with the truth Ridge says he and Caroline were broken up and that is when Thomas made his move. Now if she is happy they can continue on as Douglas is his son. She says no, he is his grandson. He has to tell Thomas the truth. As she walks out, he says he will do it.",
        "Quinn tells Deacon that Liam did not call the police so that speaks volumes. Bill is stunned that Quinn was at Liam's house and he let her go without calling the police. Liam says it is a blur now but all she wanted was Liam. Bill says they will call the police as Quinn surely will come back for him again. Liam says he does not care; his only focus is on Steffy. Thomas sees how upset Caroline seems to be and is trying to soothe it over when Ridge comes in and says he needs to see Thomas alone. He tells Thomas he needs to clear things up. One day he is going to run this whole company and he wants to mentor him and help him grow and succeed. Thomas is surprised since he has done a lot of unforgivable things but this is all he wanted was his love and support. He will do anything for him. Ridge says there is one thing he finds reprehensible. He knows about that night with Caroline in the hotel room. Thomas reveals that was the biggest mistake of his life and he has apologized to Caroline over and over. Ridge has a child with Caroline and they are lucky to have each other. Ridge says yes it was a terrible mistake and they had consequences. Astonished Thomas looks at his dad and guesses that Douglas is his son."

        "Caroline: We cannot be having this conversation.",
        "Katie: Ridge said that it was a sperm donor.",
        "Caroline: Then just leave it at that.",
        "Katie: But you just said --",
        "Caroline: Forget what I said!",
        "Katie: It's the truth. Thomas is the father of your baby.",
        "Thomas: Look, dad, I can do this. Frankly, you need me to do this -- take on more responsibility. Call it paternity leave. I-I would want the same thing if I were a new father.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Rick: Sorry I'm late.",
        "Ridge: I'm impressed you showed up at all.",
        "Rick: Well, fatherhood. You know all about that.",
        "Thomas: Actually, we were just talking about that.",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah?",
        "Thomas: I'm trying to convince dad to throttle back a little bit, take some time off.",
        "Rick: That's a great idea, Thomas. I can take care of C.E.O. You can run design. When do we start?",
        "Liam: Been a while.",
        "Bill: You still remember where the commissary is?",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Oh, you mean the tofu steaks you had them add to the menu? Yeah. I remember.",
        "Bill: Son, it's time to get back in the saddle. I need you here.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, you've got Wyatt now.",
        "Bill: But I want both of you here. It'll be good for you, Liam. It'll help you get your mind off everything that happened with Quinn.",
        "Deacon: You know, I've been worried about you.",
        "Quinn: I'm touched.",
        "Deacon: So, what happened? You went over to see Liam. I figured he'd call the cops.",
        "Quinn: That obviously wasn't the outcome.",
        "Deacon: Oh, so, you didn't -- you didn't go there?",
        "Quinn: Au contraire.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, if you're not in jail, what the hell did you do to Liam?",
        "Deacon: What did you do, push him off a cliff?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You are hilarious.",
        "Deacon: I mean, if you actually did go to see him, either you'd be in jail or Liam would be dead.",
        "Quinn: Well, there is a third alternative.",
        "Deacon: Wait a second. Are you telling me that he forgave you?",
        "Quinn: When I got there, there were candles lit, champagne.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, well, they sure as hell weren't for you.",
        "Quinn: Steffy had just been there. Liam was hoping for a reunion.",
        "Deacon: And you were hoping for the same thing with \"Adam.\"",
        "Quinn: Well, it didn't work out for either of us. Steffy got her wedding ring tattooed to her finger.",
        "Deacon: Well, that's a good thing, right? I mean, that's what you wanted for Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but poor Liam was crushed.",
        "Deacon: Please tell me that you're not starting to feel bad for this dude.",
        "Bill: I've got people watching the airports, the borders -- both Canada and Mexico. We will find her. You'll never have to see Quinn again, except when you testify against her in court. What is it, Liam? Something's bothering you.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Rick, but I'm not taking paternity leave.",
        "Rick: Are you not a new father? Because dads get to take paternity leave these days.",
        "Thomas: All right. All right. Ease off, Rick. The man knows his limitations. Which are pretty much zero, right, dad? I mean, you can run a company, you can design a collection, and he can be an amazing father to Douglas.",
        "Katie: Thomas is Douglas' father?",
        "Caroline: This can't be happening. This is not open for discussion, not between us or you and anyone else.",
        "Katie: Does he know? Caroline. He has got to be told.",
        "Quinn: I gave him every he's protected me.",
        "Deacon: Dodged another bullet, didn't you? I mean, it's a miracle that twerp didn't turn you in.",
        "Quinn: I gave him every opportunity. I even suggested he call the police.",
        "Deacon: Ah, he was probably too wigged out by his visit from Steffy.",
        "Quinn: Possibly. Or maybe it's more than that.",
        "Deacon: You know, Quinn, he can't give you what you want. I mean, Adam is gone. He's -- he's not there anymore. It's Liam -- Liam Spencer. And he doesn't want to touch you. But me -- I could touch you all night long. Just like I used to.",
        "Quinn: Stop it.",
        "Deacon: You know what? Will you get real? Okay? He's your son's half-brother.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] We're not related, not even close.",
        "Deacon: The guy is gutless. He's vanilla! He's a wuss!",
        "Quinn: What are you? Huh? Casanova? You could learn a thing or two from that wuss.",
        "Deacon: Oh, really? What could I learn?",
        "Quinn: How about being a gentleman for starters?",
        "Deacon: Honey, you tell me when you ever wanted a gentleman.",
        "Quinn: I do now. The way he looks at me, the way he treats me with respect.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, that was Adam. He's not real. He's -- he's a fantasy that you've concocted. It's a fantasy that's gonna land you in prison.",
        "Bill: I want to hear all of it, Liam -- everything she did to you. You don't have to hold back with me.",
        "Liam: I don't know. I don't even -- I don't know. I don't know what I think about her.",
        "Bill: Well, did she hurt you? Did she abuse you?",
        "Liam: She... she told me that we were married. And I believed her.",
        "Bill: Well, that's because you couldn't remember anything. You were vulnerable. Did she -- did she abuse you in the bedroom?",
        "Liam: No, no. No. Nothing like that. She -- she treated me like a husband. She took care of me. And, weird as it is, I felt safe around her. Dad, I-I loved her like a wife. And she loved me. I think she still does. God, it's so twisted.",
        "Bill: She's gonna pay for this, Liam. She's gonna pay big time. She's gonna go to prison for a very long time. Now, I know you want that, and rest assured, I will make it happen. What is it? There's something you're not telling me.",
        "Liam: Quinn paid me a visit.",
        "Bill: What?!",
        "Thomas: What's going on with you?",
        "Ridge: All right. Meeting's over.",
        "Rick: Maybe for Thomas.",
        "Ridge: What is it?",
        "Rick: What do you mean what is it? It's you! It's always been you.",
        "Ridge: Yes, it is me. Not putting you in charge.",
        "Rick: I never thought for a second you'd let go of that choke hold you have on this company, not for a second.",
        "Ridge: Good. We have an understanding.",
        "Rick: But you know what's gonna come tumbling down? The way you manipulate, the way you operate. You know, it's all gonna catch up with you, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Thank you, Rick. I'll keep up my guard.",
        "Rick: Oh, it's gonna take more than that after what you did to mom and Taylor -- this wide path of destruction. What do we call that again? What was that old saying? What goes around, comes around.",
        "Ridge: And this whole time, you've been innocent, all these years.",
        "Rick: Compared to what you've done. Gosh, when I think about Caroline -- that poor girl, what she's gonna have to go through.",
        "Ridge: We're done here.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. Did I hit a sore spot? 'Cause she's looking a little stressed-out these days.",
        "Ridge: Get out.",
        "Rick: Wait. What is that? You hear that? It's footsteps. It's karma. It's coming to get you. Hey, Katie. Hi. He's all yours. Oh, wait. That was a long time ago. Another one of your victims.",
        "Ridge: What can I do for you?",
        "Katie: You can start with an apology.",
        "Ridge: For what?",
        "Katie: For lying to me. I know the truth. Thomas is Douglas' father.",
        "Deacon: It's like you got this death wish thing happening.",
        "Quinn: Death wish? [Chuckles] It's quite the opposite. I've never felt more alive.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Why? All because of little boy Liam who wants to put you in prison? Which, by the way, I could have done myself for what you did to me.",
        "Quinn: But you won't. And neither will he. Liam didn't call the police, and that speaks volumes.",
        "Bill: Quinn came to your house?",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Bill: Well, you called the police, right? She's in custody? Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Liam: Because she's not.",
        "Bill: What do you mean she's not? Where the hell is she?",
        "Liam: I-I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Bill: You let her go?",
        "Liam: Well, it was either that or...",
        "Bill: Or what, Liam?",
        "Liam: Dad, I could have killed her.",
        "Bill: Tell me what happened.",
        "Liam: I don't know. I don't know. It's a blur now. She just -- I just -- I opened my front door. There she was.",
        "Bill: What did she want?",
        "Liam: Me. She wanted me. She said she still has feelings.",
        "Bill: She still has feelings? All right. All right. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna call the police. We'll report this. Do you think she'll be back?",
        "Liam: I-I doubt it. And frankly, I don't -- I don't care.",
        "Bill: Wh-what -- what do you mean you don't care? What are you saying?",
        "Liam: Because my focus is on Steffy. I want my life back, dad.",
        "Katie: Thomas is Douglas' father.",
        "Ridge: Who told you that?",
        "Katie: I saw Caroline after I spoke to you. I told her that I knew about Douglas' paternity, and she freaked out, of course, and assumed that you had told me everything. And she accidentally revealed the truth about Thomas.",
        "Ridge: Katie, you don't understand.",
        "Katie: Does he know about this? How could you keep this from him?",
        "Ridge: Because Thomas -- he...",
        "Katie: He what?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] [Chuckles] Before Caroline and I got married, we broke up. One night -- just one night, you know? That's when Thomas made his move. They were in a hotel room together, and -- and they were drinking. And she had taken an anti-anxiety pill, and -- and she was... and he took advantage of her. So, there you go and now you know everything. You happy? Good. Keep it to yourself. It's no one's business.",
        "Katie: Are you saying that --",
        "Ridge: It's no one's business. It's done now.",
        "Katie: If Douglas is Thomas' son, then it's kind of Thomas' business. He should be told.",
        "Ridge: No. You need to forget about this. He's -- he's my son.",
        "Katie: He's your grandson.",
        "Ridge: Think about the -- the repercussions of this. Think -- think about what would happen -- not to me, not to Caroline -- that poor little boy.",
        "Katie: I'm thinking about you. I am. Because I know better than anyone what secrets can do to someone. They will destroy you. And I can see it. I can see it happening already. I don't want that for you. You have to tell your son the truth. You have to tell Thomas the truth.",
        "Ridge: Katie. Okay. I'll tell him. I'll do it.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Thomas: Hey, what is it? Look, I-I don't mean to pry. Okay, but for weeks at a time, I-I see you, and it's like you're carrying this -- this burden. I-is it the marriage? Is -- is it something wrong with dad? Look, I-I know that he can be a handful at times.",
        "Caroline: No, it's not that.",
        "Thomas: Good. If there's one thing that I really know, it's that dad adores you. I mean, how could he not? You gave him a child. What is it? Is it Douglas? What's -- what's going on?",
        "Ridge: Thomas, I need to talk to you in my office. Alone.",
        "Caroline: You told Ridge.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I did.",
        "Caroline: I think he's telling Thomas right now.",
        "Katie: I'm really sorry. But how long did you expect to keep this a secret? All of Douglas' life? Ridge kind of told me what happened. Did Thomas take advantage of you?",
        "Caroline: No, he didn't. He...",
        "Katie: I didn't think so. I'm trying to understand how this could happen. I mean, I get it. It's -- alcohol was involved. You were in a bad place. There's no excuse not to tell Thomas. He has to know that he has a son.",
        "Thomas: So, you want to -- you want to clear some things up?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Okay, uh, wh-what things?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Well, I, uh -- I have plans for you, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Plans?",
        "Ridge: I think one day you're -- you're gonna run this whole company.",
        "Thomas: You do?",
        "Ridge: I do, and I-I want to mentor you. I want to -- I want to help you grow and succeed.",
        "Thomas: Wow. Sorry, I-I'm just a little confused, 'cause, you know, we've had this -- this rift between us. I-I didn't think that -- that you --",
        "Ridge: What? That I-I could forgive you? Of course I can forgive you. You're my son.",
        "Thomas: Dad, I've done a lot of unforgivable things.",
        "Ridge: Well, we're family, Thomas. Family forgives. Don't ever forget that.",
        "Thomas: You know, all that I've ever wanted was -- it was your love, your support.",
        "Ridge: Well, you have it. And I assume I have yours.",
        "Thomas: Well, yeah, dad. Absolutely. I mean -- I mean, I would do anything for you.",
        "Ridge: There is, um... there -- there is one thing you did that I find reprehensible.",
        "Thomas: What's that?",
        "Ridge: I know about that night with Caroline. I know what happened in that hotel room.",
        "Thomas: You, uh... you know?",
        "Thomas: Dad, look. Look, that -- that night -- that was the biggest mistake of my entire life. I'm sorry. I-I've apologized to Caroline over and over again.",
        "Ridge: Apologized? You apologized. Apologized. That's -- apology's good. When Caroline and I got married, in our vows, she said, \"Everything I am is yours.\" What do you think about that? You agree with that statement?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, Dad. Absolutely. I mean, you have a child with Caroline. He's -- he's lucky to have -- have you as a father.",
        "Ridge: Yes, he's very lucky. He's my son. He's mine. Nothing's ever gonna change that.",
        "Thomas: What are you saying? Dad, it's like I said. That -- that night -- that was a terrible mistake.",
        "Ridge: It was a terrible mistake. And mistakes have consequences.",
        "Thomas: Consequences? What kind of consequences are you...?",
        "Thomas: No. No, no. No, you can't -- you can't be saying that... that's -- that's, um... and Douglas -- he's, uh -- he's my s-- my son?"
