        "Brooke tells Ridge that she did go see Maya last night but she just couldn't do it could not bring herself to ask Maya if she was transgender. She wanted a chance for Maya to explain why she is going to let Rick propose, move her into his house and let it go on this long. Brooke says she has a new resolve today and Maya will listen to her. Nicole tells Maya again there is no good reason for Rick to ever know the secret so do not tell him. He walks in just as she says that and wonders what she is talking about. They blow it off that they were talking family business. Liam tells Wyatt that he doesn't want to pressure him or anything but he needs to get a move on to get this secret out of Nicole. Wyatt admits he has done all he knows how to do. Liam hands him the phone and insists that he call. Wyatt says he is taking a big risk here and he wants it all to be right. He calls and invites Nicole to come over to the house where he is working and they can go surfing or play beach volleyball. She asks Rick and Maya if she can borrow a bikini from downstairs. Brooke tells Ridge that Rick loves Maya and she should have told him a long time ago. She can symphathize her being transgender, being born in one body and feel like she should be another. But she can not forgive her for not telling Rick since he holds such a value on honesty. Rick is happy for Nicole and says she can throw a party and invite anybody she wants while he is gone. He just wants to slip away and have a good trip. Nicole tells Maya she is certain Rick is going to propose at Big Bear and she wants nothing to ruin that. She urges Maya not to tell Rick if she ever wants him to be her husband. Maya gushes that Brooke Logan will be her mother-in-law. Nicole says yes but only if Maya keeps quiet and doesn't ruin things. Nicole also doesn't want her relationship with Wyatt to be jeopardized. Maya says it won't. It should not matter to him what is on Maya's birth certificate. After more urging from Liam, Wyatt tells him to get out of there. He knows what is at stake and he will do all he can to get this secret out of Nicole by the end of the day. Maya shows up via Brooke's text and she says Brooke can feel good that Rick has all that love and support. She thinks they are a good match ..based on love with honesty and trust. Brooke says that is reassuring but looks right into her eyes and calls her Myron.",
        "Nicole shows up at Wyatt's and he is impressed with her swimsuit and her secret is safe with him that she borrowed it. Rick finds Ridge in his office and scoffs at the idea if they had an appointment. He is too busy otherwise as he is ready to go to Big Bear. Ridge says great, he can take care of the office. Rick says as tempting as that is he thinks he can run it remotely. He tells Ridge that he can start with calling Maya Mrs. Forrester as that is who she will be someday soon. She is a beautiful, honest, caring woman who deserves Ridge's respect so start giving it. Maya says she does not know what Brooke has heard. Brooke responds that Rick has been deceived. The woman who was so honest with him is not a woman after all. Maya counters with yes she has been. She is a woman and there is nothing Brooke can say to make her ashamed. Brooke answers that she is not trying to make Maya ashamed, but she cares about her son and this whole persona is a lie. He made her his lead model and moved her into his house. Does Maya think it would have gone this far if he knew the truth. Maya says yes she does. He loves her. Brooke says yes but a person he is building his future around a person that he does not even know. Brooke says she is sure Maya has a sweet little speech and is biding her time and planning everything perfectly and waiting until there is no way out for Rick. She has been dishonest with him just like all the others. Maya is shocked to find Ridge knows. Brooke says that Rick will know soon too and all the others. Maya declares no, she will tell him. That was always her intention. Brooke points her finger at Maya and says she should have told him when she first kissed him and started dating, when he invited her into his house to stay there and when he made her the lead model. She could have told him all those times and didn't. Maya stammers it is her decision when to tell him and no one else's and it isn't as easy as Brooke makes it sound. She says she is not pretending. She is not Myron and really never was. The only person that needs to know all of this is her doctor. She knows that Brooke would not have said these things to her yesterday but now Brooke thinks she is lower than life. Brooke responds that she is sure Maya has thought long and hard about this but Rick needs to know the truth now. Maya says and she will, that has always been the plan. She will not marry Rick without telling him so Brooke can forget that right now. If Rick proposes she will not accept until he accepts her. Brooke says the word IF. No Maya is not going to wait that long. She is going to tell him before he proposes. She shouts at Maya that she will not humiliate Rick like that, down on one knee with ring in his hand. She will not treat him like that. She shakes her finger at her again and says Maya will tell him the truth today that she is transgender. If she doesn't, then Brooke will."

        "Ridge: So, Rick still doesn't know?",
        "Brooke: No. I want to hear from Maya first. I want her to explain why she hasn't told my son. He's moved her into his house. He's going to propose to her. Why would she let it go on so long?",
        "Ridge: But I thought you were confronting her last night. Wasn't that the plan?",
        "Brooke: I was. I was. I went to the photo studio. She was there looking at pictures of herself, the beautiful lead Forrester model. [Sighs] I just couldn't bring myself to ask her why she hasn't told my son the truth that she is transgender.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: No ring, I see. I thought Rick was close to proposing. Guess it didn't happen last night. Unless... Maya, did you tell him?",
        "Maya: No. I didn't tell him. And, no, he didn't propose. But he's going to soon. I can feel it.",
        "Nicole: Well, when it does happen, please don't ruin it. There is no reason for him to ever know.",
        "Rick: No reason for who to ever know what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Well, whatever this secret is, it's got to be huge.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. We were so sure it was about Rick, but it's about Maya.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but apparently it's so big that it could still get Rick out of his C.E.O. job.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. We have to figure out what it is.",
        "Liam: I mean, I don't want to pressure you or anything, but... I would get a move on if I were you. Because how great would it be if we could get Rick out of there before Caroline even comes back from New York?",
        "Wyatt: I am trying my best here. I'm working my magic, okay?",
        "Liam: All right. When's the next time you're seeing Nicole?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. Maybe today. I'll text her later.",
        "Liam: Wyatt. This is working your magic?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: You call her. You call her, you get her down here, 'cause, Wyatt, there's only one way we're gonna find out Maya's secret, and it's through Nicole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Hi, honey.",
        "Rick: Hey. You okay?",
        "Maya: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rick: Nicole, you seemed upset.",
        "Nicole: I'm good.",
        "Rick: I thought you said something about not wanting somebody to know... hope you're not talking about me.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] You? No. Um, talking about our dad. It's not big deal.",
        "Rick: The Avant sisters keeping secrets from their parents?",
        "Nicole: Hey, you said you wanted us to bond.",
        "Rick: Yes, sure enough. And I'm glad that you two are getting along. But be careful. Parents always have a way of finding things out, speaking from personal experience. Somehow, my mom always knew my secrets even before I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Why aren't you more shocked about this? That's what I don't understand.",
        "Ridge: What? Shocked? I am shocked. I'm -- I'm trying to wrap my head around it. I mean, people do what they need to do to just...be at peace with themselves.",
        "Brooke: What do you mean? She hasn't told him. I mean, that's a pretty big omission when you're sharing your life with somebody. How could she lead him on this way? Rick keeps talking about her integrity.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's more about your son's compulsion to impress other people than it is about her.",
        "Brooke: Rick's the wronged party.",
        "Ridge: I don't know. Yes. This is a disaster in the making, and not because of Maya. No, maybe because of Maya, but not -- it's because of Rick, how he's gonna react. His head is gonna explode, and what's gonna happen to Forrester? What's gonna happen to us? We wouldn't be here if I were running the company.",
        "Brooke: Don't get ahead of yourself. This is on Maya. I was too upset to talk to her last night, but today, she will listen to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Here. Call.",
        "Wyatt: I will. I just --",
        "Liam: Dude, you just took her on a ride in your private jet. I think you can call to chitchat.",
        "Wyatt: Good point.",
        "Liam: You feeling guilty?",
        "Wyatt: No. I'm just -- I'm taking a big risk here. I got to make sure everything I do is right.",
        "Liam: Okay. So, do everything right. The whole date -- dinner, candles, flowers.",
        "Wyatt: She hasn't even spent the night yet. You -- you're worse than dad, you know that?",
        "Liam: Oh!",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "[Dialing]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Nicole: Hey, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: How soon can you get down here?",
        "Nicole: 30 seconds. I'm actually at Forrester right now. Are you in your office?",
        "Wyatt: Working from home, and by that, I mean I'm going surfing. Care to join?",
        "Nicole: Are you kidding? I don't go anywhere near sharks. But I will put on a bikini and watch you surf.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Uh, well, how about some beach volleyball, then?",
        "Nicole: Oh, that's cool. I mean, if you don't mind me kicking your butt. See you soon.",
        "Rick: Tell me I didn't hear that Wyatt was surfing right now.",
        "Nicole: Nope. He's hard at work. Work, work, work. Sorting jewelry or whatever he does. Anyway, can I borrow a swimsuit from downstairs?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Rick: Sure, sure. Go ahead. Yeah, I didn't realize that you and Wyatt were friends.",
        "Nicole: Getting to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: She coming over?",
        "Wyatt: Yep.",
        "Liam: Well, do whatever it takes. She knows something. Just find out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. That -- that just sounded like I was defending Maya. I'm not. I-I really don't care for Rick's little...attack dog, but if you need help talking to her, I'm here.",
        "Brooke: No. No, I don't need your help. You always have an agenda when it comes to Rick.",
        "Ridge: But it seems that you don't know what to say when it comes to Maya.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I'm not being judgmental. I can't say I fully understand her, but I do sympathize with her. I mean, it must be awful being uncomfortable in the body that you were born with, fighting to be the person that you really are. But Rick loves her, and she should have told him a long time ago. I'm just worried how he's going to react when he finds out.",
        "Ridge: Let me ask you something. Do you think there's any chance that Rick will not have a problem with any of this?",
        "Brooke: He's going to have a huge problem with the fact that she kept it from him. You know how he doesn't like secrets. And he always thought that Maya was honest with him. He has a ring. He's planning to propose. Maybe even tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: No parties tonight, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: What?",
        "Rick: On second thought, throw your party. Throw an epic party. Invite Wyatt. Invite all your friends. Just make sure there's no trace of it when Maya and I get home.",
        "Maya: Who are you?",
        "Rick: She tell you about our plans?",
        "Nicole: Oh, yeah. Big Bear, right? Your family owns a cabin up there?",
        "Rick: Yeah. You're welcome to use it anytime. Well, anytime but tonight.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Nicole: Don't worry. I wouldn't dream of crashing it. [Cell phone beeps] I don't want anything interfering with your romantic getaway.",
        "Rick: I've got a quick meeting in publicity. You all packed?",
        "Maya: I think so.",
        "Rick: Good. It's gonna be a trip to remember. [Smooches] Oh, and, uh, Nicole...",
        "Nicole: Hmm?",
        "Rick: I want to hear all about that party.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: [Laughs]",
        "Nicole: He's totally proposing tonight.",
        "Maya: It seems that way.",
        "Nicole: Don't ruin it.",
        "Maya: Nicole.",
        "Nicole: Don't tell him. Do you want to come back here with a ring on your finger or not? If you want to call Rick \"husband\" someday, you can't say a word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I'm telling Rick.",
        "Nicole: I just...don't see the urgency. Why does he need to know the minute he proposes?",
        "Maya: Because he does. [Cell phone beeps] Huh. That's strange.",
        "Nicole: What?",
        "Maya: A text from Brooke. She wants to see me. I wonder if she knows.",
        "Nicole: Knows...?",
        "Maya: That Rick's gonna propose. Who would have thought? Brooke Logan will be my mother-in-law. [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Maybe. If you keep quiet. You have a really great thing going here. Don't do anything to jeopardize it. Please, at -- [Sighs] at least not now.",
        "Maya: Nicole, I've been dating Rick for months.",
        "Nicole: But I only just got here. I'm enjoying it. Come on, Maya. Give me a chance to have some fun before things get complicated. I've just started this thing with Wyatt, and we like each other. What happens to that if your relationship with Rick goes kaboom?",
        "Maya: If Wyatt is the kind of guy you seem to think he is, it won't matter where you live, it won't matter if Rick leaves me or not, and it certainly won't matter what your sister's birth certificate used to say a long time ago. All right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Just remember the goal, right? The goal is to get her to spill the secret.",
        "Wyatt: The goal is to get her to trust me enough to spill the secret.",
        "Liam: All right. Well, we don't have months to figure this out, so keep on pushing and don't back down.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, Dad.",
        "Liam: I mean, she opened up to you before, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Liam: Okay. All right. So, you just -- you just keep on pushing. Practice with me. Give me your most sincere face.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Liam: Yeah, like, you know, look into my eyes. Look at me like I'm the most important woman in the world.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] No. This is stupid.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] All right. Call me when you know something.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you sure you don't want to hide around the corner?",
        "Liam: Do you think I could do that?",
        "Wyatt: No! Go. Get out of here. I got this.",
        "Liam: All right.",
        "Wyatt: But listen, okay? Today will be the day we find out Maya's secret.",
        "Liam: All right.",
        "Wyatt: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Hey. I got your text.",
        "Brooke: Hope I'm not pulling you away from anything.",
        "Maya: Rick's mother calls, I come running.",
        "Brooke: I was that way with Stephanie. I wanted to do everything that would please her, make sure she knew that I was the right woman for her son.",
        "Maya: If you're comparing me to you right now, that's the best compliment I've received all week.",
        "Brooke: What I didn't understand is why she was so fiercely protective over Ridge.",
        "Maya: But you get it now that you're a mother, right?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, I do understand that now. I am very intensely protective of my children, maybe even more so than Stephanie, because I made more mistakes than she did. I mean, maybe they didn't have the ideal childhood, but I'm gonna make sure that their very happy in their adult lives. And that means looking at their life partner is very important to me. I want to make sure that they're happy and that they're appreciated.",
        "Maya: You can feel good knowing that Rick has that.",
        "Brooke: Well, he's been fooled before. Amber, Caroline -- they would say things that he wanted to hear, but really, they were deceiving him. They were lying to him. Practically lied right through their teeth.",
        "Maya: That's why Rick and I are different, why we're such a good match.",
        "Brooke: Because you have a relationship built on honesty.",
        "Maya: Yes. Brooke, Rick has finally found a woman he can trust.",
        "Brooke: Well, that is very reassuring. Myron.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: Hi.",
        "Nicole: Hi. Okay. How do you ever get used to this?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] What? Living down at the beach?",
        "Nicole: Don't get me wrong. The Forrester mansion is amazing.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: But I wouldn't mind having the sand right at my doorstep.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: That view, the ocean, Malibu.",
        "Wyatt: Eh, can't complain.",
        "Nicole: Well, how do you like my swimsuit?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] It's very nice.",
        "Nicole: Can you keep a secret?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, of course. Yeah, what?",
        "Nicole: I kind of, sort of borrowed it from the Forrester vault.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Do we have an appointment?",
        "Ridge: You know what I like about you? Absolutely nothing.",
        "Rick: Look, I'm serious. I don't have a lot of time. I'm heading up to Big Bear with Maya.",
        "Ridge: Really? All right. I'll take care of things while you're gone.",
        "Rick: Uh, that's very tempting, but I think I'll run it remotely.",
        "Ridge: Big Bear, huh? I always thought of Maya as a... sitting by the pool sipping margaritas kind of chick.",
        "Rick: Chick? Is that how you refer to our lead model?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: The C.E.O.'s girlfriend?",
        "Ridge: I always thought of Maya as a sitting by the pool sipping margaritas kind of... lady. Grand diva. What do you want me to call your mistress?",
        "Rick: Well, you can start with calling her, um, Mrs. Forrester. Because that's who she'll be someday soon. Maya is honest, caring. She's a beautiful woman who deserves your respect. Start giving it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I don't know what you've heard.",
        "Brooke: That Rick's being deceived. That the woman he put his trust in, the woman who was so honest with him is not a woman after all.",
        "Maya: No. No. I am a woman. And there's nothing that you can say to make me feel ashamed.",
        "Brooke: I'm not trying to make you feel ashamed. I care about my son. And this whole persona is a lie.",
        "Maya: That's not true.",
        "Brooke: Lead model? Future matriarch? Do you really think Rick would have gone this far if he knew the truth?",
        "Maya: Yes. I believe so. Rick cares about me, how I support him and love him, and that has nothing to do with how I was born.",
        "Brooke: He's building his whole life around a person he doesn't even know!",
        "Maya: He knows me! And what he doesn't know, I will tell him.",
        "Brooke: When are you gonna tell him? When he's walking down the aisle? When he's in too far that he can't even get out?",
        "Maya: That is not what I'm doing.",
        "Brooke: No, I know what you're doing. I'm watching you. You're very patient. You're planning everything perfectly. You're waiting till he gets tied in, and then you will confide in him. And I'm sure you have your sweet little speech that it doesn't matter because you're still the same woman that he fell in love with, but you know what? It does matter, because you've been dishonest with Rick, just like the others.",
        "Maya: Who told you this?",
        "Brooke: Ridge.",
        "Maya: Ridge knows?",
        "Brooke: And my son's going to know very soon.",
        "Maya: No. No, Rick will hear this from me. That has always been my intention.",
        "Brooke: When? When are you gonna tell him? You should have told him when you first started dating him.",
        "Maya: I needed to be sure.",
        "Brooke: About what?",
        "Maya: About Rick and our relationship.",
        "Brooke: Rick deserves to know the truth. You should have told him when you first kissed him. You should have told him when he invited you into his house to stay there, when he hired you as the lead model at Forrester Creations. You could have told him all of those times.",
        "Maya: You know, that -- that -- that may even be true. But...that is for me to decide and no one else. And it's not as easy as you seem to think it is. I'm not pretending to be anyone. I am not Myron, and I never really was. Look, I'm single, I'm self-supporting, and who absolutely needs to know about the way that I was born besides my doctor? And you know what? [Voice breaking] This way that you're talking to me -- you wouldn't have said this stuff yesterday. But you find out and suddenly decide that I'm lower than life. Of course, I would have thought long and hard before deciding to bring this kind of treatment into my life.",
        "Brooke: To hear you rationalizing about this, I'm sure that you've thought long and hard about it. You need to tell my son the truth.",
        "Maya: And that has always been my plan. I will not marry Rick without telling him, so you can just get that out of your head. If he proposes, I will not accept until he accepts me, all of me.",
        "Brooke: You know he's going to propose to you very soon.",
        "Maya: I've been suspecting. And if he does, I will tell him.",
        "Brooke: If? No. No, you're going to tell him before he proposes. You're not going to humiliate him like that.",
        "Maya: Humiliate? What are you talking about?",
        "Brooke: Down on one knee with his ring in his hand? No! You are not gonna treat him like that, Maya. You're not gonna do that to him. You're gonna tell him the truth, and you're gonna tell him today. You're gonna tell him that you're transgender. And if you don't... I will."
