        "Dante: Bridget, I love you. I've always loved you from the first moment we met. I know you weren't ready in the past and that things were different between us. Now we're different. And tonight, you said that you were ready. That you wanted me, too. You are the only woman for me, Bridget Forrester. And you will always be. If you accept this ring. If you say yes.",

        "Stephanie: I think he's had a heart attack.",
        "Hector: Ridge! Ridge, can you hear me? Okay, let's hook him up to oxygen and run this EKG meter right now. Stephanie, was he complaining of any chest pain at all?",

        "Hector: Ridge, can you hear me? Ridge? Patient is non-responsive. Pupils are equal and reactive.",

        "Dante: Yeah, but we talked about being a family.",
        "Bridget: Being parents -- being parents to Dino.",
        "Dante: It's become more than that. I mean, since you moved in here, our relationship has changed, right?",
        "Bridget: I'm not even divorced from Nick yet, though.",
        "Dante: That doesn't mean we can't be engaged. Look, we can take our time. We can deal with these legal issues with Stephanie and Felicia. And we can plan the wedding. If you accept the proposal.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Intern: We need an emergency chest CT, Stat. CBC, Chem panel -- how long has he been unconscious?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Dante, I'm really, really sorry. I'm just -- I'm not ready to jump into another marriage. You know, when I said I didn't want to wait anymore, I meant that I really wanted to move forward -- to the next step of our relationship. But I didn't want to just jump to the end.",
        "Dante: Marriage is not the end. It's the beginning.",
        "Bridget: It's the beginning of a lifelong commitment. At least that's how it's supposed to be. It just really hasn't happened that way for me.",
        "Dante: But it could.",
        "Bridget: Maybe it will. But right now, I just need something a little less intense.",
        "Dante: I should have realized, you know -- I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood you.",
        "Bridget: No. No, you didn't. Not entirely. You really were right. Our relationship is changing. We're getting so much -- we're getting so much closer. And it's been great.",

        "Nick: I'm a little lightheaded here.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, my legs are shaking. You are the sexiest man I've ever made love to on an airplane.",
        "Nick: Well, it's an honor to have that title. We need a little mid-air.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Nick: Your hair fell.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I guess it did. What does it look like?",

        "Surgeon: Curve clamp. Another sponge, another sponge.",
        "Nurse: Yes, sir.",
        "Surgeon: Hold it right there. Vascular clamps. I need another one. Come on, come on, come on. Another sponge.",
        "Christian: How's his pressure?",
        "Nurse: It's holding steady.",
        "Surgeon: Did you talk to his family?",
        "Christian: Wasn't time.",
        "Surgeon: Someone should.",
        "Christian: It's worse than what we saw in the CT Scan?",
        "Surgeon: It's a miracle your friend even made it to the operating table.",
        "Christian: If you don't get another clamp in there, he's not going to make it off of it.",
        "Surgeon: Clamp.",
        "Christian: Come on, Ridge. You've got to hang in there. Your mother almost lost one child, she can't lose you now.",
        "Surgeon: How's his pressure?",
        "Nurse: Still holding steady.",
        "Surgeon: Good, open up fluids.",

        "Thorne: I can't locate Dad, but I left a message for him to call me --",
        "Stephanie: He's in surgery.",
        "Thorne: What? Why?",
        "Stephanie: The nurse said that after the CAT scan, they just -- all she told me was they took him into O.R. Some sort of emergency procedure.",
        "Thorne: Okay, Mother, listen to me. Ridge is a strong man, okay? He's gonna get through this.",
        "Stephanie: This is my fault. This is my fault.",
        "Thorne: No, it's not.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, we were arguing.",
        "Thorne: You argue all the time.",
        "Stephanie: I know that, but this was different. I was with Brooke, she was packing her stuff, he came in, he heard me say something to her. And he blames me. He said it's my fault, I've driven her away, and it's the only person in the world that he really loves -- he said I've ruined his life. That's the last words he said to me, I've ruined his life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christian: Good work.",
        "Surgeon: We'll see.",
        "Christian: Like you said, Ridge was lucky to have made it this far. Maybe his luck will hold out. For his family's sake, I hope it does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Here, have a seat. Look, you did not do this to Ridge.",
        "Stephanie: I never listen to him. If he said it to me once, he's told me a million times. She means everything in the world to him.",
        "Thorne: This is not your fault -- or Brooke's, okay? I promise you -- listen, Ridge is going to pull through this.",
        "Christian: Mrs. Forrester, Thorne --",
        "Stephanie: Is he all right?",
        "Christian: Ridge is out of surgery. He's in recovery.",
        "Thorne: Well, what happened? He was on his way to get a CAT scan.",
        "Christian: We had to act immediately on what we saw there. I'm sorry, I didn't have time to come out here and explain. But I thought you'd want me to stay with Ridge.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, absolutely. What did -- what did they see? I mean, it was a heart attack?",
        "Christian: Yes, but that was the symptom of a much more dangerous problem.",
        "Stephanie: What?",
        "Christian: Well, Ridge has a very serious cardiac defect. It's called an aortic dissection, and it could have killed him instantly.",
        "Stephanie: What's an aortic dissection?",
        "Christian: It's a tear in the inner aortic wall. In Ridge's case, the ascending aorta coming out of the left ventricle. The blood gets in behind the tear, between the layers of the aortic wall, and therefore causes further tearing.",
        "Stephanie: Is this a genetic defect or something?",
        "Christian: It's usually associated with a history of high blood pressure. But a sudden BP spike can also cause the initial dissection.",
        "Thorne: So it's like a chain reaction.",
        "Christian: A potentially lethal one. There's a lot of pressure in that area. If the aortic wall becomes weakened enough, it can rupture.",
        "Stephanie: Did it?",
        "Christian: No, we caught it in time. The surgeon was able to patch the tear with a Gortex graft.",
        "Stephanie: So he's going to be all right?",
        "Christian: We're going to be watching him very closely. The first 48 hours after a dissection are critical. Now I know this doesn't sound like very good news, Mrs. Forrester, but under the circumstances, it could have been a lot worse.",
        "Thorne: Thanks, Christian.",
        "Stephanie: I could have killed him.",
        "Thorne: That's not what he said.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, yes, I badgered him, I badgered her. It was too much for him. He just couldn't take it anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I just had this weird feeling that something was wrong. You're sure everything's okay? No, no, don't wake them up. But when they do get up, just give them a big hug and a kiss for me. Tell them their mommy misses them. Thanks, Catherine.",
        "Nick: Feel better?",
        "Brooke: No cream. Yeah, I do.",
        "Nick: You know, you gotta realize it's been an emotional day for you. You left Forrester, you got into it with Stephanie --",
        "Brooke: Maybe that's it.",
        "Nick: Every time you're happy, she's there to ruin it. And now she's not, so it might take you a little to get used to that.",
        "Brooke: I just have to keep reminding myself that everything's okay now. I have a great man who's completely devoted to me. No more looking over my shoulder. Our future's secure.",
        "Nick: You get a little extra added bonus, too. You got a mother-in-law who respects you and adores you.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Brooke: That's good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you. And I do know that you haven't been my baby for a very long time. I just -- I just want you to be happy. That's all I want for any of my kids, just to be happy. Please get better, please come back. Please, give me another chance to make this up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I am so relieved to finally have Stephanie Forrester out of my life, I can't tell you.",
        "Nick: I hate to say this, but she's probably saying the same thing about you right now.",
        "Brooke: Stubborn old woman.",
        "Nick: Do we have to talk about her?",
        "Brooke: I can't believe that I actually thought I could win her over. Today I finally realized I couldn't, and I never would. Nothing in this whole world could get Stephanie to accept me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I'm here. Whatever you need, I'm here for you. I need you to be okay, be happy and be healthy. I'll do whatever it takes.",
