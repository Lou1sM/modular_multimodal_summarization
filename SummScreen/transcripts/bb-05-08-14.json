        "Quinn tells Bill to go ahead and tell Wyatt the great news. He snarls at her if there is a conversation she is not part of it. Quinn says she is sorry but she was showing Bill this pix she has on her phone and out of nowhere he wants to give his name to Wyatt. Wyatt is taken aback but quips that there is no more William or any variation not in the family so he must be getting Bill's last name. Bill says it's not like he hasn't thought of it before, but he just wasn't sure. And don't compare this with his brother. It is a whole different set of circumstances. Liam lost his mother and had no one. Bill had never had a son and he certainly did not anticipate another one. Wyatt is different. He's made a name for himself that isn't Bill's. He's established a professional force to be reckoned with just like Bill did without his father and yet he wanted to take credit for it. Bill said he wished he had any name but his father's and he assumed Wyatt might feel the same. The door opens and it is Liam wondering if he is interrupting. Aly slips up to Oliver and he tells her they need to be careful. She says they can lock the door. He says she is so beautiful as she kisses him. She remembers her mother telling her that she'd always be loved, but then she was gone. If wishing was all it took to bring her back ..and then somebody else be gone. He wishes being happy didn't make her so sad. And he knows hr dad is great but he is not sure he'd like Oliver to whisk her away in Wyatt's trailer. Aly confides her dad doesn't even like her anywhere near a car. He wouldn't even let her cross the street by herself until she was twelve. But a person needs more than just to be safe all the time. He says in that case they don't have to lock the door. Taylor and Thorne fly back to L.A. on the jet. She says she is glad to be home although she does not know where home is now. It will be odd going back to L.A. now as a couple. He reminds her they are adults and not hurting anyone. She asks if he is sure about Aly. He says Aly is no longer than little girl that she remembers. She does know it was an accident that took Darla from them. Taylor says but that is because Thorne is being rational but Aly isn't. Thorne tells Taylor that he will never ask Aly to forget, but she is a young woman and he recounts that he is not a young man anymore. He's done his mourning. He raised his daughter and does not regret a minute of it. But this is a different time and he doesn't have to be alone. He doesn't have to walk away from love and Aly will have to understand that. He thanks Taylor for bringing all this joy back into his life. Those days were the darkest in his life and then he found her. She says Thorne showed her what love is all about ..absolute forgiveness but she could not expect that out of Aly. Thorne says he was heartbroken all over again when they had to call it off, but maybe it was for the best. His daughter needed his full attention and he probably needed hers. And it made him less ambitious. Life is simple when the goal is simply happiness. Aly confides in Oliver that sometimes she is worried that she will hold him back. She's been pretty sheltered. Her dad wasn't overprotective but she's not good at anything. She'll have to be patient and Oliver will have to teach her everything. He says she is good at being herself and that is the only skill that he is concerned with.",
        "Quinn tells Liam that the answer to his question is yes, so get out. Bill tells her she will not speak to his son that way. Wyatt tells his mom to ease up; Liam works here too. Quinn tells Liam that he has no part of this conversation as Bill is making Wyatt a Spencer and there is nothing Liam can do about that. Bill tells Quinn to shut up. Liam says so it is Wyatt Spencer now. Didn't Bill think he could tell him about this. Quinn speaks up and says he didn't make up his mind until today. Liam wonders why the rush all of a sudden. Wyatt tells Liam that Bill did not know how he'd feel .and he thanks him for that. He likes being his son. He'd be honored to be Wyatt Spencer. Justin comes in and Bill tells him his timing is perfect. He wants Justin to petition the court and give Wyatt his name and make him a legal heir. He advises Justin to take Wyatt with him as they will need some personal identification. Quinn reminds Bill that he didn't tell Wyatt that he would support him and Hope. Liam says oh, now he knows what is going on here. Quinn says that is what he gets for walking in when he is not invited. Never know what you might hear. Liam says he would call it blackmail. She says he can not stop this from happening. Liam says he doesn't care if Wyatt is a Spencer. Most people think he is anyway but he doesn't know why Bill is letting her walk all over him. Bill says that is not what is happening. He fully intended to talk to Wyatt at some point. Liam says yeah right but he's having it now because Quinn is threatening to tell Brooke about their sexcapades. He tells his dad to do what he wants about Wyatt but do not let Quinn lead him around by the nose. So she tells Brooke and Brooke will laugh in her face. Bill says all right but he doesn't need his son to tell him how to run his life. Quinn pulls out her phone. Both tell her to put it away. She calls them squeamish. Bill tells him to get the hell out of here and let him handle this. Liam says she will haunt him until the day he dies if he doesn't call her bluff right now. Quinn says she doesn't bluff. Liam tells her then go tell Brooke ..tell her all the gory details. Quinn says okay. Liam tells his dad the only reason that Quinn has a photo like this is because she is going to use it. The question is how much will he have to give up before she does. Quinn quips that she doesn't remember putting her hand on the Bible swearing her to secrecy. Liam tells his dad that Brooke will understand. She has spent her entire life being shamed for her sexual impropriety. She will not stand in judgment of Bill. He looks at Quinn and says but go ahead, crack the whip. He has a job to go to down the hall until she makes Bill give it to Wyatt. Thorne and Taylor surprise Pam but they swear her to secrecy until they see Aly. Suddenly Thorne is getting cold feet. Pam finds Aly and hands her a medieval axe. She said Charlie found it in an antique store. It's very heavy and very sharp. But she thought she'd bring it down here to Oliver and maybe he could use it in a photo shoot. Aly says yes he is very creative. So just leave it and she will leave him a note. Liam runs into Wyatt and asks him if he is all Spencerized. Wyatt wonders how he feels about that. Liam says he has considered him his brother all along. That's the reason he pisses him off so much. But if his dad goes crazy again and loses all his money then he's bunking with Wyatt this time. Wyatt says really, well he knows he has not treated him very well. And he's not about to start now. Liam says he would expect no less. Quinn asks Bill just how bad does he want to kiss her right now. He barks that she is so crazy that she doesn't even know she is crazy. She says some people look at things and ask why. She looks things as they should be and kicks butt until they are. She wants to know how he is going to help Wyatt get Hope. He says she did not back him into legitimizing Wyatt. He would have gotten there faster if she had not badgered him. She says whatever to save face. He tells her she will not tell Brooke. Forget about any repercussion from him. Quinn will suffer as Brooke will go to Hope and tell Hope to cut her off at FC .and the really painful part is she will tell Hope to run to the hills from Wyatt. Quinn smiles and says reward is so much more effective than punishment. She knows his heart is already spoken for but perhaps his body needs a girl on the side. He says he will never be that hard up. Oliver finds Thorne and says it looks like he and Taylor are together. If they are, then Aly must not find out. Aly sees her mother briefly and says Oliver is so gentle and does not judge her. She wishes Darla could meet him. She wishes her mom was here to tell her what to do. She turns around and there is Taylor."

        "Quinn: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I spoil the surprise? Oh, see, your father and I, we were chatting, and then I was showing him this picture that I have on my phone, and then, out of the blue, he says he wants to give you his name.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. Well, I can't think of another variation of William that you don't already have in the family, so I guess I'm taking your last name.",

        "Aly: How am I gonna adjust to being so happy?",
        "Oliver: You're so beautiful.",
        "Aly: Well, as long as you think so. I remember my mother telling me I'd always be loved. Then she was gone. You know, I would give anything in the world just to be able to tell her about... but if wishing was all it took, she'd be here in the world again. And somebody else wouldn't be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: You got some sleep. I told you you needed it.",
        "Thorne: How long was I out?",
        "Taylor: 2 1/2, almost 3 hours.",
        "Thorne: [Chuckles] What about you?",
        "Taylor: Oh, I like looking out the window, looking at the clouds. It's like the sun is standing still.",
        "Thorne: [Chuckles] We're chasing it.",
        "Taylor: I know. We're almost... I almost said \"home,\" but I don't really know where \"home\" is right now.",
        "Thorne: Well, won't L.A. always be home for us? I mean, we spent our youth there, started our careers there, raised our children.",
        "Taylor: But it will be a little different going back as a couple now.",
        "Thorne: Well, we're adults. We're not hurting anyone.",
        "Taylor: What about Aly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I wish being happy didn't make you so sad.",
        "Aly: I don't know why I said that.",
        "Oliver: Your dad's away, you miss your mom... you wish you could share your good news with them.",
        "Aly: I do.",
        "Oliver: I wish that for you, too... as long as your dad doesn't have a gun.",
        "Aly: He is the kindest, sweetest man in the world. Well, maybe it's a tie with you.",
        "Oliver: He's great. He is. Still, I don't think he'd be okay with my plan to whisk you away in Wyatt's trailer.",
        "Aly: Well, he doesn't really like the idea of me anywhere near a car. I couldn't even cross the street by myself until I was 12.",
        "Oliver: I guess that's understandable.",
        "Aly: But... a person needs more than to be safe all the time.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: You know, Aly's not the same little girl you remember.",
        "Taylor: Well, that's true. She hasn't really attended any of the family events that she's known that I'm going to.",
        "Thorne: She knows that it was an accident that Darla was taken from us.",
        "Taylor: Or does she know that that's what you believe and she doesn't want to argue with you? You're being rational. She isn't. I mean, really, Thorne, does anyone ever really get over losing their mother?",
        "Thorne: [Breathes deeply] You know, I'll never ask her to forget, but Aly is a young woman, and I'm not [Laughs] a young man anymore. I've done my mourning, and I raised my daughter, and I don't regret one minute of it. But this is a different time. And I don't have to be alone. I don't have to walk away from love. And she's gonna have to understand that.",

        "Wyatt: Whereas you were with Liam.",
        "Bill: No, no, no, look. Don't compare yourself to your brother, all right? It's -- it's a completely different set of circumstances, Wyatt. Liam lost his mother. He had nothing. I'd never had a son, and I certainly didn't anticipate having another one. You're different. You made a name for yourself that wasn't mine. At a young age, you established a professional reputation as a force to be reckoned with. I did that, with virtually no help from my father, and yet he wanted to take the credit for all of it. I wished I had any name but his. And I assumed you feel the same way.",

        "Liam: Sorry. Am I interrupting?",

        "Thorne: [Chuckles] You weren't asleep that long.",
        "Taylor: Ha. It felt like I was time-traveling... back to another time when we first fell in love.",
        "Thorne: Those were the darkest days of my life, and then I found you.",
        "Taylor: You taught me what love was really about. Absolute forgiveness. Of course, I knew I couldn't expect that from Aly.",
        "Thorne: You know, I was heartbroken all over again when we had to call it off. But I think maybe it was for the best. My daughter needed my full attention, and I probably needed hers.

        "Oliver: I could say the same about you.",
        "Aly: I've been pretty sheltered.",
        "Oliver: Are you saying that your dad was overprotective?",
        "Aly: I don't know. No, no, it's not him. I'm not good at anything. I will be, but... not yet. I have to be so patient. You'll have to teach me everything.",
        "Oliver: You're good at being you. That's really the only skill that matters to me.",

        "Quinn: \"Yes\" is the answer to your question. Get out.",
        "Bill: You're not gonna talk that way to my son.",

        "Quinn: You have no place in this conversation. Your father is making Wyatt a Spencer and there is nothing you can do about it.",

        "Wyatt: Can we all just calm down, please?",
        "Liam: So... \"Wyatt Spencer\"?",

        "Quinn: Well, your father didn't know he'd made up his mind until today.",
        "Liam: Okay. Why the rush, all of a sudden?",
        "Wyatt: He didn't know how I would feel about it is what he said. And I thank you for that. I -- I like being your son. And I'd be honored to be Wyatt Spencer.",

        "Justin: Uh, excuse me. I'll come back.",
        "Bill: Uh, no. No, no. Uh, actually, your timing couldn't be better. I need you to do something important for me.",
        "Justin: Okay.",
        "Bill: I want you to petition the court to give Wyatt my name. And to make him a legal heir.",
        "Justin: I'll get right on it.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, hang on a second. You better take him with you. They're gonna need some personal identification, social-security number, et cetera, and then get the notary up here, and we'll both sign off on it.",
        "Wyatt: All right. Thank you. And thank you again, Dad.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: You didn't tell him that you are going to support his relationship with Hope.",
        "Liam: Oh, oh, all right. Okay. I -- now I see what's going on here.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Well, show up where you're not invited and you never know what you're gonna walk into.",
        "Liam: No, I believe it's called blackmail.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Ow.",
        "Liam: Tell me I'm not right.",
        "Quinn: You're not right... in the head, if you think you can stop this from happening.",
        "Liam: Are you even listening to me? I just told you, I don't care what Wyatt's last name is. Everyone I know already thinks of him as a Spencer anyway. Why -- why are you -- why are you letting her walk all over you like this?",
        "Bill: That's not what's happening. I -- I fully intended to have this conversation with Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but... you're having it now, and you're having it now because you threatened to tell Brooke about your crazy sexcapades with him.",
        "Quinn: I'd like to know what's so crazy about that.",
        "Liam: The you part. Listen, Dad, do whatever you want about Wyatt, but don't let her lead you around by the nose. So she tells Brooke. So what? Brooke's gonna laugh in her face.",
        "Bill: All right, listen. I don't need you to tell me how to live my life, son.",
        "Liam: Would you rather she did?",
        "Bill: Will you put that thing away?",
        "Liam: Oh, God, yes! Please, put it away.",
        "Quinn: Oh, so squeamish.",
        "Bill: Do me a favor, will you? You just get the hell out of here and let me handle this.",
        "Liam: Dad, she's going to haunt you with this until the day you die unless you call her bluff right now.",
        "Quinn: I never bluff.",
        "Liam: Oh, really? You don't ever bluff? Okay, go tell Brooke.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Liam: Yeah, show her your nasty little photo. Tell her all the gory little details. Go ahead.",
        "Bill: Liam --",
        "Liam: Dad, the only reason she has a photo like this is because she intends on using it. The question -- the only question -- is how much you're gonna have to give up until she does.",
        "Quinn: You don't know me, and you don't know anything about me.",
        "Bill: I know you swore to keep your mouth shut about this to Brooke.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but, see, I don't remember putting my hand on a bible.",
        "Liam: Oh, please, shut up. Dad, Brooke will understand. She spent her entire life being shamed for sexual impropriety. She's not gonna stand in judgment of you. You know, fine. Go ahead. Crack your whip. I got a job to do down the hallway. That is, until she makes you give it to Wyatt.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Hey, Thorne! You're home! What a surprise. And Taylor.",
        "Taylor: I hitched a ride back with him on the jet.",
        "Pam: Well, you always were pushy. Aly is gonna be so happy to see you. You? Mm... [Telephone rings] Oops. Sorry.",
        "Thorne: Hey, and, Pam?",
        "Pam: Mm?",
        "Thorne: Is Aly here?",
        "Pam: Yeah. She's in the building somewhere. Oh. Why? Are you a surprise?",
        "Thorne: Kind of.",
        "Pam: My lips are sealed.",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Thorne: Damn it. I'm getting cold feet.",
        "Taylor: She'll be fine.",
        "Thorne: She wasn't before.",
        "Taylor: Thorne, you want to have a truthful relationship with your daughter. We tried to protect her in the past, but, to her, that felt like we were lying. You don't want to make that mistake again, do you?",
        "Thorne: No, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: [Gasps] Aly! Oh! Do I have a surprise for you. Except I'm not supposed to tell you.",
        "Aly: What is that behind your back, Aunt Pam?",
        "Pam: This. This is an axe that Charlie got at an antique store. That time that you couldn't come to medieval night with me, I brought Charlie instead, and he said it was life-changing. Want to hold it?",
        "Aly: Oh, it's heavy.",
        "Pam: Right? Be careful.",
        "Aly: It's really sharp.",
        "Pam: Yeah. People keep walking up to my desk and then walking away when they see it. I just thought I'd bring it down here and show it to Oliver. Maybe he can use it in a shoot or something?",
        "Aly: Yeah, he would probably love it. He's very creative.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Aly: Well, you can leave it, and I'll explain. I was just writing him a note anyway.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Liam: Well, that didn't take long. You all Spencerized, are you?",
        "Wyatt: Pretty much. Although I gather a judge will have to sign off on it.",
        "Liam: I'm glad it worked out for you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Um... I've been meaning to ask you about that.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] What, you mean if I meant it?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, I -- I've seen you as my brother all along. If I didn't, you wouldn't piss me off so damn much. In any case, if dad goes crazy again and loses all his money, he's bunking with you next time.",
        "Wyatt: Really? I know I haven't really treated you very well.",
        "Liam: That's accurate.",
        "Wyatt: And I'm not about to start now.",
        "Liam: Wouldn't expect any different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: How bad do you want to kiss me right now?",
        "Bill: You're so crazy, you don't even know you're crazy.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Some people look at things as they are and ask, \"why?\" I look at things as they should be and kick butt until they are. So, tell me, how are you going to support Wyatt's relationship with Hope?",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] If you think you've backed me into legitimizing Wyatt, you're wrong. The truth is, I would've gotten there faster and more genuinely without your badgering.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. Well, you know, say whatever it is you need to say to save face.",
        "Bill: You're not going to Brooke. Forget about the repercussions from me. You will suffer because she will go to Hope and tell Hope to cut you out at Forrester. And then the really painful part? She will tell Hope to run for the hills from Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: They say that reward is so much more effective than punishment. So, how am I gonna reward you? I mean, I know that your heart is already spoken for, but maybe your body needs a girl on the side.",
        "Bill: I will never be that hard up.",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. You know the day is gonna come when Brooke locks you out and... well, think about it. I don't need affection. And you know, I know what you like.",

        "Oliver: Mr. Forrester?",
        "Thorne: I'm here. How'd you know I was back?",

        "Thorne: Yeah, she flew back with me from Paris.",
        "Oliver: It looked like you're together.",
        "Thorne: And?",
        "Oliver: And I just want to say, if you are, your daughter cannot know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: So, he knows the worst things about me.",
        "Darla: Well, you were brave to tell him.",
        "Aly: He's so gentle. And he doesn't judge me. I really wish you could meet him.",
        "Darla: I know, honey.",
