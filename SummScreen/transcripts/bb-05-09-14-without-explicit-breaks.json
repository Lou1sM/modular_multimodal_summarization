        "Aly is startled. She looks at Taylor and asks why she is here. She says she left L.A. and she could finally breathe. Now she is back. Taylor says there are so many things she wants to say to Aly. She is there for her. Panting, Aly says Taylor has no idea what seeing her does to her. She needs to go back to Paris and not be anywhere near her. Oliver tells Thorne that he is lucky that it was him and not Aly who came in and saw Taylor in his arms. Thorne says he is not sure why any of this is Oliver's business. Oliver tells him he knows all about his wife, Darla's death, and how it affected Aly. He cares for Aly and doesn't want to see her hurt. Thorne admits that he and Taylor are a couple. He appreciates Oliver's concern and glad she has someone to confide in, but she is old enough now to know the truth and accept it. Oliver says not for this. Aly absolutely hates Taylor. Thorne says even that is not totally unexpected because he and Taylor had a history before he even married Darla but for some reason it never worked out. Aly was the last reason because of the accident. He says he put his life on hold to be the best damn father he could be. He says Aly is old enough now. They even live in different cities so he is allowed to do this. That's why they are here to tell the family and Aly. Wyatt questions Justin about the piece in the paper. Justin says it is weird but California law. They must run it once a week for four weeks, then he will be a Spencer. Justin quips that Bill gets all the credit while he does the grunt work. Wyatt says Wyatt Spencer, has a nice ring to it. Caroline walks up and gets in on the end of congratulations and thinks Hope has chosen Wyatt. He explains he has a new name. She tells her cousin that he just did Hope a favor. Imagine being Hope Fuller .like Hopeful, that would be awful. But now either way, she gets to be a Spencer. Charlie surprises Pam and asks if she is a damsel in distress. He's suited from head to foot in medieval armor. She tells him he looks good enough for her to eat. She says she is so glad he is so into this. It puts her bustle into a bunch. Hope adjusts the necklace on one of her models. Quinn walks in and says she is always right. Hope tells her she will trust her life with Quinn for picking her necklaces, but a man that is up to Hope. Quinn gloats that she needs to start picking as she won't want to wait any longer when she hears Quinn's news. No more Fuller; Wyatt is going to be a Spencer. Hope asks how Quinn feels about that. Quinn admits that the Spencer name made her furious for years. She swore then that she'd never let Wyatt know. But now that he does she sees the world isn't coming to an end and she has to admit the name brings a certain level of respect so she is happy for Wyatt. Hope is happy too but does not see how this changes a thing of who she chooses. Quinn points out that Hope has been dating two brothers but her fans might not realize that. Now it will be painfully obvious, so Quinn can't see this going on for too long. There doesn't have to be a scandal. She and Liam have tried for years and didn't make it so this dating both is just prolonging the obvious. Hope says yes there might be gossip about her but she will deal with it. She feels she is on the verge of making a life decision and she wants to get it right.",
        "Oliver asks Thorne how are they planning on telling Aly. Thorne says they will just sit her down and tell her the truth. Taylor is a psychiatrist and Aly will be fine. Oliver is still skeptical and says Aly still talks to her mother. He says they hang out and Aly confides in him. He knows what he is talking about and this will not end well. Thorne says Oliver is a little old to be hanging out with Aly anyway but he is glad she has someone to talk to. Oliver offers to be there when they tell Aly. Thorne declines that. Oliver says trust him. This is going to be a shock and Aly will need all the support she can get. Taylor tells Aly maybe they should call her father. Aly says he would tell her the same thing; just stay away from her. Aly says she will never forget what Taylor did. Taylor says she won't either. It haunts her every day. Aly says she can't be like other kids who have a party and go out with friends. Her birthday is nothing but the day that a person drank too much and got behind the wheel. And her mom ..she was helping Taylor's daughter, just a good person going out of her way to do the right thing. But Taylor is still alive. She pretends to be so moral but is the first person to stand in judgment of people like Brooke and Hope. She says Taylor pretends to be a saint but she isn't. Her mother was a saint; she earned her right in Heaven. Taylor is a murderer and will never get there. Taylor says Darla was a special woman and everyone loved her. Aly backs away and looks at the axe on the table. She gnashes her teeth at Taylor and says guess her dad needed an expert opinion, but she is not crazy and she is not to call her dad a friend. Taylor tries to tell her they have been friends for years and have gotten closer. Aly accuses her of trying to get Thorne to betray her mother's memory. Taylor says she wanted to marry Thorne because she loved him. Aly says thank God she stopped that. She was young but she could see right through Taylor and Thorne could never be happy with her. After all these years he has never remarried. That ought to tell Taylor something. And if the right woman came along, she would support that. She barks at Taylor to listen to her; stay away from her dad. He wants nothing to do with her. Taylor tries to convince her that this will change nothing for Aly. Aly will always be first in his life. He gave everything up for her, but now maybe it's time for him to have his own life and to decide who he wants to spend it with. Hope tells Wyatt that she's heard his big news. His mother was here and is glad that he is a Spencer. Wyatt says that makes two of them; Hope says three. He quips it will make it easier than having Fuller being on the embroidered pillowcases and have to change. She teases him about it and he says oh yeah, even if he has to make them himself. Mr. & Ms. Spencer with the wedding date. He might miss Fuller, but Spencer seems right, like he belongs. Things are just getting better and better and to think it all started when they met in the woods. Taylor tries to tell Aly that she is not taking her father away. She loves him and he never stopped loving her. Aly turns away in fear and says NO, stop it, she's lying. Taylor turns to get her phone and call Thorne. She knows they can sit down and work this out and all will be fine. Aly keeps looking at the axe nearby. Aly says Taylor took away her mother and now she wants Thorne too. Well she can not let that happen. It's time to cut her off. Taylor turns around and Aly is wielding the axe over her head heading toward Taylor who lets out a bloody scream."

        "Hope: Okay. Wow. Uh, how do you feel about that?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Oh, well, I mean, the Spencer name made me furious for years. I swore I'd never let Wyatt know, but, well, I mean, now that he does, the world hasn't come to an end, and even I have to admit that that name brings a certain level of respect, so I'm -- I'm happy for him.",

        "Thorne: Look, I appreciate your concern, but Aly's old enough now.",
        "Oliver: Not for this. Aly hates Taylor.",
        "Thorne: This is not entirely unexpected, okay? Because, through the years, Taylor and I started something. We had a history...before I even married Darla, but for some reason or another, we just couldn't make it work. Aly was one of the reasons... because of the accident. Look, I was willing to put my life on hold to be the best damn father I could be to my daughter because she lost her mother. But Aly is old enough now, and we live in different cities. I'm allowed to do this.",
        "Oliver: So it's true? You're together?",
        "Thorne: Yes, we are. And that's why we are here to tell everyone, especially Aly.",

        "Wyatt: I don't check it all that often.",

        "Wyatt: You're weird.",
        "Caroline: How could two cousins be so different?",
        "Wyatt: Even more different -- two brothers.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my god. You just did hope the biggest favor ever.",
        "Wyatt: How?",
        "Caroline: \"Hope fuller\"? Like \"hopeful\"? Ugh! God, that would have been so awful. I mean, could you imagine? But now, either way, she gets to be a Spencer.",
        "Wyatt: Huh.",
        "Quinn: You don't have to get involved in a scandal -- you know, \"which Spencer brother will she choose?\" I mean, you -- you and Liam have tried and tried to make it work, and it didn't happen, and, well, this attempt at dating both of them is just -- it's prolonging the obvious.",

        "Charlie: Yeah. Listen, uh, does this chain mail make me look fat?",
        "Pam: No. Charlie, you look delicious. I could just eat you up.",
        "Charlie: Well, you know, they say that armor is a good source of roughage. Now, we must be away, milady. My steed's double-parked, and, you know, we have to get there early. You know, we have to have front-row center.",
        "Pam: Oh, that's right, because you like to sit close enough so that you can see that spittle of fear on the jousters' quivering lips.",
        "Charlie: Aye.",
        "Pam: [Chuckling] Oh, Charlie. I love how into this you are. It's gets -- I don't know -- gets my bustle all in a bunch. [Chuckles]",
        "Charlie: Excellent turn of, uh, medieval phrase, milady. So, is Aly coming?",
        "Pam: No. And I don't understand why. I mean, she used to love this. She said it was our thing.",
        "Charlie: Well, my little 12th-century tart, now it's our thing.",
        "Oliver: How are you planning to tell Aly?",
        "Thorne: We're gonna sit her down, and we're gonna tell her the truth. Look, Taylor is a psychiatrist. It'll be fine.",
        "Oliver: You don't understand. You haven't been around. She still talks to her mom.",
        "Thorne: She told you that?",
        "Oliver: Yeah.",
        "Thorne: Well, it comforts her, and she knows that it's just her imagination.",
        "Oliver: Maybe, but when she finds out about you and Taylor...",
        "Thorne: Okay, you know what? Let's forget about Taylor and me for a minute, okay? What is going on with you and my daughter?",
        "Oliver: We hang out. We've gotten to be good friends. And, yes, she confides in me. That's why I know what I'm talking about. You have to believe me. This will not end well.",
        "Taylor: Maybe we should call your father.",
        "Aly: Why? He would tell you the same thing -- stay away from me.",
        "Taylor: I don't want to upset you, honey. I-I would like for us to talk.",
        "Aly: I won't forget what you did.",
        "Taylor: I won't either. [Voice breaking] It haunts me every day.",
        "Aly: Oh, so that makes it okay -- what you took from me? [Voice breaking] I was too young to lose my mom.",
        "Taylor: I know.",
        "Aly: I can't escape, and it's your fault.",
        "Taylor: Escape?",
        "Aly: The memory. My birthday -- other kids -- they -- they have parties and go out with friends. But me -- my birthday is nothing but the day a person drank too much and got behind the wheel.",
        "Taylor: Aly...",
        "Aly: And what was my mom doing? She was helping your daughter -- just a good person going out of her way to do the right thing.",
        "Taylor: That's who she was.",
        "Aly: But you are the one still alive. You pretend to be so moral, when you are the first person to stand in judgment of people -- Brooke and hope. Well, I have heard plenty. You pretend to be a saint. Well, you aren't. You...are a murderer. My mom -- she was a saint. She earned her place in heaven. But you -- you will never get there.",
        "Taylor: Darla was a special woman. Everyone loved --",
        "Aly: She was my mom! You took her from me.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Wyatt: Hello, beautiful.",
        "Hope: Hey. I just heard your big news.",
        "Wyatt: What? Is Caroline posting about it?",
        "Hope: [Chuckling] No, no, no. Uh, your mom was just here, and she seems very excited about you becoming a Spencer.",
        "Wyatt: That makes two of us.",
        "Hope: Three.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Pam: You're not gonna take the club with us, are you?",
        "Charlie: Oh, sure. We'll get better service.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Charlie: Looks authentic, huh?",
        "Pam: Yeah, it sure does. How do you think you're ever gonna get that past security?",
        "Charlie: I'm going to disguise it as a huge leg of lamb. No. Their head of security and I go way, way, way, way back. I mean, you know, actually, the thing is just -- is just kind of harmless. Although, uh, Quinn did, uh, lock herself in a bathroom when she saw me come in.",
        "Pam: Yeah, and the ax that you bought wasn't harmless. I could shave my legs with that thing.",
        "Charlie: Right you are, my dear. Oh, by the way, did you remember to take it to the photo studio?",
        "Pam: Oh, you bet your longbow I did.",
        "Charlie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Pam: Oliver is gonna love our pitch. You, me, medieval weapons. It's gonna be the best photo shoot ever.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Thorne: Now, I'm not sure about you and Aly. Don't you think you're a little old to be hanging out with my daughter?",
        "Oliver: There's a few years between us -- not many. Aly's fun. I don't even notice that she's younger.",
        "Thorne: Well, what is it, exactly that you two do?",
        "Oliver: We talk, mostly. She's opened up to me a lot about her past. You know, she's still in a lot of pain. She has a hard time even saying Taylor's name.",
        "Thorne: Well, I'm glad that she has someone to talk to about it.",
        "Oliver: If you want, I-I could be there when you tell her.",
        "Thorne: I don't think so.",
        "Oliver: Trust me -- a shock like this -- Aly's gonna need all the support she can get.",
        "Taylor: I know your childhood has been extremely difficult for you.",
        "Aly: How would you know that?",
        "Taylor: Your father's told me.",
        "Aly: Why would my dad talk to you about anything?",
        "Taylor: We're friends.",
        "Aly: Oh, he wanted your expert opinion -- is that it? Well, I'm not crazy, and don't you dare call my father your friend.",
        "Taylor: We have been for many years.",
        "Aly: Not after what you did. [Sighs]",
        "Taylor: [Sighs] Aly, your father and I -- we -- we've stayed fond of each other over the years, and while we've been in Paris --",
        "Aly: And I don't mean what you did to my mom. I mean what you did to him after.",
        "Taylor: What did I do to Thorne?",
        "Aly: You tried to make him betray my mother's memory.",
        "Taylor: Aly. Aly, I-I wanted to marry your father because I loved him.",
        "Aly: Well, he never felt that way about you. Thank god I stopped it. I was so young, but I knew. I could see right through you. He could never be happy with you.",
        "Taylor: Your father and I agreed not to get married for you because your wounds were too fresh, and it was too much for you.",
        "Aly: All these years, and he never got remarried. Tells you something, doesn't it? That my mom was his one and only.",
        "Taylor: I think it also tells me that he was being a responsible father because he wanted to see you grow up to be a wonderful young woman like you are, and now it's time for maybe him to have his own life and -- and maybe find someone.",
        "Aly: If the right woman came along, I would support it.",
        "Taylor: Well, Aly, as I was saying, we've been getting closer lately.",
        "Aly: No.",
        "Taylor: Don't you think he deserves some happiness?",
        "Aly: You can't. Not this.",
        "Taylor: Aly, we -- we were in Paris, and old feelings came back.",
        "Aly: You stay away from him! He wants nothing to do with you! You hear me?",
        "Taylor: This isn't going to change anything for you. You're always going to be first in his life. You'll always be first to him. Don't you see? He gave up everything for you. Look at the choices he made. He -- he -- he became mom, dad, coach -- everything for you because he wanted to see you grow up. Don't you think maybe it's time for him to -- to have his own life now and -- and decide maybe who he wants to spend it with?",
        "Aly: I have stopped you before, and I will stop you again. You may have taken my mother, but you will not take my father. You won't.",
        "Wyatt: You know, it's good that you've decided to do this dating both of us thing.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. What?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Yeah, imagine when we're married already. The embroidery on the pillowcases will say \"fuller.\"",
        "Hope: Embroidered pillowcases?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, yeah. No, we're getting them. I might even make them.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: \"Mr. And Mrs. Spencer\" with the wedding date.",
        "Hope: Oh, my god. Does that kind of take some getting used to -- being called \"Spencer\"? I mean, aren't you gonna miss \"fuller\"?",
        "Wyatt: No. I don't know. Feels right -- like I finally found where I belong. God. Things just keep getting better and better. And it all started with meeting you in the woods. It did.",
        "Thorne: By no means am I taking this lightly. Taylor and I have been very, very careful about keeping this secret until we were both ready. Well, now we're ready, and we're not gonna lie anymore. We're gonna tell the family, and we're gonna tell Aly. And when she gets over the shock, she's gonna be fine.",
        "Oliver: I don't think so.",
        "Thorne: Well, my daughter wants me to be happy.",
        "Oliver: Not with Taylor. Your wife died a long time ago. Of course, you're allowed to move on, but for Aly, that -- that pain is still very raw. She's not ready for this. She's not gonna react the way you're hoping. Telling her right now would be a huge mistake.",
        "Taylor: Aly, I'm not trying to take your father away. Please, listen to me, not just for his sake, but for yours...",
        "Aly: No.",
        "Taylor: ...So you can heal, and you can grow.",
        "Aly: No!",
        "Taylor: I love your father. He's never stopped loving me.",
        "Aly: You're lying.",
        "Taylor: Aly...",
        "Aly: Stop it!",
        "Taylor: Let's call your father, and we can all sit down and talk about this. I know we can work through this. It's gonna be okay.",
        "Aly: \"Okay\"? My mother is gone...forever. Now you want to take my dad, too? I can't let that happen. You keep taking from me and my family. It's time to cut you off.",
        "Taylor: Aly? Put that down. Aly! No-o-o-o! No-o-o-o!"
