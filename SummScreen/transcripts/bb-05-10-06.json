        "Nick and Brooke continue their honeymoon-like vacation. Her eyes shoot open the second that Ridge utters the name Brooke in his coma-like state. She wants to call home and she discovers Stephanie's message on her cell \u0096 Stephanie needs her, call home. Stephen stops by to see Brooke, but finds Jackie playing dress-up with Hope instead. He approves of Nick sweeping Brooke off to Cabo. He gladly accepts Jackie's invitation to stay for coffee. Brooke calls and Stephen reluctantly picks up the phone. Brooke is relieved to know all is okay. She relays to him that she quit her job at Forrester and Stephanie has been hounding her ever since. Stephanie shows up and surprises Stephen, who tells her that her days of harassing his daughter is over. Her son raped his daughter, so he doesn't give a damn what he wants. Taylor and Thomas rush to see Ridge. Stephanie takes the blame, but Taylor doesn't believe she caused his condition; it was probably genetic. Stephanie worries that if Brooke doesn't come, Ridge will die. Hector tells Thomas and his mother that Ridge's heart could have ruptured. It didn't, so they have to stay positive. Christian tells the family that medically they are doing everything they can for Ridge, but he's not responding as well as they had hoped for. All realize he needs Brooke. Stephen tells Stephanie she is crazy and it's too late. It ends now, or he will throw her out. She begs for him to just tell Brooke that Ridge is seriously ill and needs her, and let her decide."
