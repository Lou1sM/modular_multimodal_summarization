        "Thomas: You want me to deny my own son?",
        "Ridge: He's not your son. Caroline and I are the only parents that Douglas will ever know.",
        "Thomas: What does that make me? Dad, you don't know what you're asking.",
        "Ridge: I'm asking you to give Douglas what he needs, and if you're the man that I think you are, you're gonna let him have it.",
        "Thomas: [Scoffs] No. No, no, no, no. That's crazy.",
        "Ridge: Douglas is happy. He's secure. And I'm not gonna let anyone destroy the family that Caroline and I have made for him.",

        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Caroline: I thought you left.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, I just had to make a phone call.",
        "Caroline: Not to my uncle. Please tell me that you didn't call my uncle.",
        "Katie: No, of course not.",
        "Caroline: What am I saying? It doesn't matter. Because once Thomas knows, this --[Sighs] Oh, God. Oh, my God.",
        "Katie: Look, I know it seems bad right now, but in the long run, this is for the best. Thomas has a son and he deserves to know that. And he deserves to be a part of his son's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Steffy, I see it in your face every time I'm with you. You miss what we had.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Liam, I didn't know what happened to you. It was all so confusing.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, and you made a mistake. But you don't have to live with it. Tattoos can be removed, marriages can be dissolved. You can erase this entire chapter from our life. It'll be like I never left.",
        "Steffy: Liam. Too much has happened.",
        "Liam: If that's how you feel, then tell me no. Tell me to give up. Tell me to back off. Except that's not how you feel. Is it? I know you think I don't have the right to ask you this.",
        "Steffy: You know what I'm gonna say.",
        "Liam: I'm not asking about Wyatt. Just tell me how you feel. That's all I need to know.",
        "Steffy: Oh. That's all?",
        "Liam: It's the only thing that matters to me, Steffy.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Dude, really?",
        "Steffy: He didn't know I was coming over. You know your mom was here?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I heard.",
        "Liam: Wyatt stopped by a little earlier.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, did he happen to mention that?",
        "Liam: Did you forget something?",
        "Wyatt: I didn't like the way we left things.",
        "Steffy: No, you guys had an argument.",
        "Liam: I would call it a difference of perspective, but okay.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, we're gonna clear that up. Right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Ridge loves Douglas. He is our son.",
        "Katie: But Thomas is his father.",
        "Caroline: He has his DNA, but you and I both know that that is not what being a parent is about. Thomas -- he wasn't ready to take that on.",
        "Katie: You never gave him a chance.",
        "Caroline: But you weren't there, Katie. You don't know the circumstances of Douglas' conception. Ridge and I are happy. We have a good marriage, and Douglas is thriving. So to tell Thomas now, it's gonna -- it's gonna tear my family apart. Is that what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Every time I was with Douglas, I felt a connection to him. Even before he was born.",
        "[Flashback]",
        "Thomas: I felt that. That was amazing!",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: Oh, my goodness. That's -- that's a little Forrester in there. He is a game-changer.",
        "[Present time]",
        "Thomas: I-I didn't understand it. It didn't make sense. Now it does.",
        "Ridge: Hey. If you care about that little boy the way I know you do, you're not gonna throw him into this chaos. Everyone believes I'm his father. That's how we're gonna raise him. And you're gonna be part of his family, you're gonna be part of his life.",
        "Thomas: Dad, you can't honestly expect me to go along with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Steffy has a mind of her own, Wyatt. She doesn't need you coming here telling me to back off.",
        "Steffy: Okay, I don't want you guys fighting over me. I was here because Bill told me about Quinn.",
        "Wyatt: And you were concerned for Liam, right? We both are. That's why I came back.",
        "Liam: You sure? Not to take another crack at me, one more try, see if you can get through?",
        "Wyatt: What do you want me to say? Tell me. What do you need to hear? Look, I don't want to be the bad guy, like Dad coming down on you. But that's not what you need right now. I know. I was there. I know what my mom did to you was messed up. And it's gonna take a while for you to get over it, and I want to give you that time, but there are some facts that you need to face right about now. Steffy and I made a commitment to each other, and if you want to be in our lives, you are gonna need to respect that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: No one wants to harm your family, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: This complicates everything.",
        "Katie: For a while.",
        "Caroline: No. For the rest of my child's life.",
        "Katie: You and Ridge are a strong couple. You said so yourself. You'll work through it. It doesn't have to be a disaster.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Pam: Sorry, but do you mind if we hide out in here for a while? [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: Is everything okay?",
        "Pam: Oh, everything's fine. It's just nobody was getting any work done with him at my desk. [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: I'm sorry, Pam. I could have taken him.",
        "Pam: Oh, no, no, no. It's not him. It's not him. It's the models. There were so many of them swarming around my desk, I thought maybe I should call security or something and set up a rope line. You know, \"one at a time, ladies. One at a time!\" All that oohing and ahhing -- they woke him up. You know, it's hard to believe, but I think that little rascal is even more popular than his daddy. Aren't you? [Laughs]",
        "[Douglas cries]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You want what's best for Douglas, right? So don't throw him into this scandal.",
        "Thomas: And never tell anyone?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Thomas: Not even him.",
        "Ridge: Especially not him.",
        "Thomas: What if it comes out? A blood test. Like you with Massimo. If that little boy finds out that I knew, he's gonna think that I rejected him.",
        "Ridge: No. You've given him a family that he can be proud of. He's never gonna how he was conceived. And he won't hate you for what you did to his mother.",
        "Thomas: What I did --",
        "Ridge: You need me to say it? She was distraught. She wasn't herself that night, and you knew that. But you just had to get even with me.",
        "Thomas: No. No, no. No, no, no. Dad, I -- that's not what happened at all.",
        "Ridge: She was compromised.",
        "Thomas: We were both drinking. I had no idea that she had drugged herself.",
        "Ridge: You betrayed me and you betrayed her.",
        "Thomas: So you take my child away from me. That's why you've been so angry with me. That's why you've been punishing me. You -- you tried to ship me off to Paris. You could barely even look at me.",
        "Ridge: Oh, Thomas. I can barely look at you now.",
        "Thomas: [Scoffs] What happened to all of your talk about forgiveness?",
        "Ridge: If you were anybody else, you wouldn't be here right now. You wouldn't be part of this family. You wouldn't be part of this company. But you're not just anybody else, are you? You're my son. My son and my wife.",
        "Thomas: She wasn't your wife. You had broken up with her. You'd broke her heart.",
        "Ridge: Oh, that's right. We were broken up. That's right. How long? An hour? Maybe two hours before you moved in? Did you ever wonder why I broke up with her? She wanted a child. She wanted a family of her own, and I -- I couldn't give that to her because I had a vasectomy when I was in Paris. And when I tried to have it reversed, they told me there's really no point.",
        "Thomas: You were infertile? Dad, I had no idea.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, yeah. And that's how we know that Douglas came from that night with you. You were wrong. What you did was wrong. And there's a price to pay.",
        "Thomas: And that -- that price...is my son?",
        "Ridge: He's my son. Mine. My name on his birth certificate. That's never gonna change. Do you understand me?",
        "Thomas: Caroline and I -- we worked this out. I felt terrible, and so did she, and we --",
        "Ridge: This isn't about payback. We did what was right for the boy.",
        "Thomas: We? She knew the whole time. She knew that he was mine the entire time? [Groans] [Exhales sharply] [Sighs] I drove her to the hospital. And I -- I held Douglas in my arms, and... I felt so drawn to him, so connected to him. God, why didn't she say anything?",
        "Ridge: Because a mother does what's best for her child. Douglas has a mother and a father that love him very much, and the only thing you can add to that is turmoil.",
        "Thomas: No. I-I'm becoming a better person. I am determined to become a better person.",
        "Ridge: I know. I know that. So be one.",
        "Thomas: By lying. By deceiving everyone. [Sighing] Oh, God. Why did you tell me this?",
        "Ridge: Not to hurt you.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: But it had to be me. It had to be me, and I need you to understand something. Look at me. Caroline and I, we're married. We love each other. And we love that little boy. We're dedicated to him. I know this is hard. I get that.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: But you need to do what's best for him, all right? Bringing all this up, telling everybody -- what's that gonna do? The repercussions of that -- what's it gonna do to you, to me, to that little boy, and to Caroline? So, come on. Be the man you say you want to be. Do the right thing.",
        "Thomas: [Exhales sharply] It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel right at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Ugh, I don't have time for this right now. Um, I have to go downstairs to check on the silk that I ordered.",
        "Pam: Well, I can stay with Douglas.",
        "Caroline: Could you? I won't be gone that long.",
        "Pam: Caroline, I'd love it.",
        "Caroline: Thank you so much, Pam. Um, there is a bottle in the bag if he wakes up, but I will be back as soon as I can.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Caroline: Thank you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Are you trying to get back at me?",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Wyatt: Do you blame me for what my mother did to you or think that I had some part in it or something?",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Wyatt: So, then what you are doing? Like, why can't you just give it up?",
        "Liam: Because it's not about you.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] You want things to go back to the way they were, right? You think that you and Steffy belong together and that my marriage was a mistake, right? You got to stop doing that. What you're doing to me, to Steffy, to yourself. You need to heal. You need to put your life back together, man.",
        "Liam: That's what I'm trying to do, Wyatt, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry if that threatens you.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not. We're good, Liam, but if you keep doing this then there are gonna be problems between us, and I don't want that.",
        "Steffy: Neither do I, Liam.",
        "Wyatt: And nobody is more relieved to have you back than we are. And if there's anything we can do to make that easier for you, we'll do it, Liam. But you just -- you have to accept what has happened here. Steffy and I have moved on, and you have got to do that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Caroline. My boy. My beautiful boy.",
        "Pam: Can't lose this! [Laughs]",
        "Thomas: Pam, you can't leave him alone like this.",
        "Pam: Oh, he wasn't alone. A model just found Mr. Busy Bee out in the hall from earlier. I'm watching him till Caroline gets back. Are you looking for her?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I was.",
        "Pam: Yeah, well, she'll back any second. [Laughs] Adorable, right?",
        "Thomas: He's beautiful.",
        "Pam: Yeah. Thomas, is there something that I can help you with?",
        "Thomas: No. Dad wants me to bring Douglas to his office.",
        "Pam: Oh, yeah, but no, that's okay 'cause Caroline asked me to keep an eye on him, so --",
        "Thomas: It's fine. I've got him now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I told you this before. Steffy and I have been through too much, and I'm not giving up.",
        "Wyatt: Well, that's gonna make family dinners a little awkward.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] That's funny.",
        "Wyatt: Actually, it's not.",
        "Liam: Okay, then you are feeling threatened.",
        "Wyatt: No, I trust my wife. I just worry about what this whole thing is doing to her. Steffy doesn't want to hurt you, Liam, and what you said is true. Yes, you guys have been through a lot together. You have this amazing history. And that means a lot to her.",
        "Steffy: It always will, Liam.",
        "Wyatt: And I respect that. But you have to understand that her future is with me now. It's time to let go, man. Can you do that?",
        "Liam: I can try.",
        "Wyatt: It's better for everybody. We should probably go.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",

        "[Footsteps approaching]",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Thanks, Pam.",
        "Pam: Oh, good. I was just writing you a note.",
        "Caroline: Pam. Where's Douglas?",
        "Pam: Thomas took him.",
        "Caroline: Thomas?",
        "Pam: Yeah. He came in right after you left and he said Ridge wanted to see him. I told him that you were coming right back, but he left. Just like that.",
