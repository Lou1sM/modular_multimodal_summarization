        "Eric: Christian, I need you to be straight with me. The reason ridge isn't responding -- is there something you're not telling us about his condition?",
        "Stephanie: Stephen, he could die. I can't lose my son any more than you could lose one of yours.",
        "Stephen: Well, you took that option away from me, stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I did. Well now it's come full circle, hasn't it? It's not about you and me and beth. It's about our children and loving them. Truly, selflessly, loving them.",

        "Nick: I don't want to be the big boss right now.",

        "Stephanie: I have. What if she doesn't get the message in time? Look, he needs her. All right? And I'm going to go down and bring her back. It's the only decent thing that I can do right now. For the two of them.",

        "Bridget: That's just your sister's way of saying that -- we all love you. Oh come on ridge, you have to come back to us --",
        "Felicia: Or you're gonna have to answer to mom. I mean, look what she did for me, and I'm not even her favorite.",

        "Nick: This sailor feeds on stress.",
        "Brooke: But you're not a sailor anymore. You're the big, new boss.",
        "Nick: Mm-hmm. And that's gonna make the old boss very unhappy.",
        "Brooke: You think massimo's gonna come after you?",
        "Nick: Yep.",

        "[Brooke laughs]",
        "Brooke: No!",

        "Brooke: No, no!",
        "Nick: You've got your new boyfriend, rico. So let's forget about the old stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Brooke, please pick up. It seems like the tenth time I'm leaving you this message. Ridge has had a heart attack. He's at the university hospital. He's had emergency heart surgery. Look, I've done a lot of soul- searching. And I know you've heard this all before. He loves you. It's as simple as that. And I should have respected it. I didn't, and I -- I'm in the corporate plane. I'm flying down right now to cabo to come and get you. You have to come back with me. He needs you. I think the only way he's going to pull through is if -- if you come back with me and you're with him. If he makes it brooke, I promise things will be different between you and me. I promise.",
        "[Machines beeping]",

        "Massimo: Look, eric. Look, I don't give a damn, all right? You think of me what you will. But I still think I was right about brooke belonging to ridge. His heart condition proves it. I only wish dominick had -- had the good sense to realize it. Instead of doing this to his brother.",
        "Brooke: I can't tell you how excited I am not to have to deal with stephanie anymore.",
        "Nick: Good.",
        "Brooke: Though I have to admit, I am going to miss my fashion career.",
        "Nick: Well, you don't have to.",
        "Brooke: I thought you said you didn't want me to work at forrester?",

        "Brooke: My heart is at forrester. You know, there would be one good thing about working with your mother.",
        "Nick: She's not a bitch?",
        "Brooke: That's true. Stephanie never did appreciate my contribution there. She just wanted to get rid of me. Any way she could.",
        "Nick: Well, my mother wouldn't be that way. She's your number one fan. Actually, let me correct that. She's your number two fan.",
        "Brooke: Oh.",
        "Nick: You look really good. Well, so much for work today.",
        "Brooke: Oh, well.",
        "[Stephanie remembering]",

        "Bridget: To bring mom back?",
        "Eric: Yes. Look, stephanie blames herself for what's happened to ridge here. She feels that she should have accepted brooke in ridge's life a long time ago. And now, she's determined to make it all up to him.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Nick: Ignore it.",
