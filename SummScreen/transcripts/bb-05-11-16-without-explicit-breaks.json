        "Caroline panics; tells Ridge that Thomas just took their son and she cannot find him. Ridge calls security and finds out that Thomas just drove off with Douglas. Thomas remembers thinking that night was a mistake and now Ridge tells him that Douglas is his son. Rick tells Maya that he is glad his family does not keep secrets like Julius did \u0096 that Sasha is his love child. He reminds Maya that Ridge is not a Forrester but a Marone. He was a family secret that Stephanie did not tell until Ridge was in his 4o's. Now he is CEO and has the family home and he will not let him get away with it. Maya says he has a right to feel betrayed but he cannot let it consume him. Pam walks in and says they should steer clear of Ridge as he is in a foul mood. It has something to do with Ridge and Thomas. Ridge manages to get Thomas on the phone and tells him to bring Douglas back. Thomas says he will not talk with Ridge, only Caroline. She begs Thomas to bring Douglas home. He says he needs to talk to her alone, meet him at the cabin. Caroline loses it and demands that Ridge not follow. Thomas does not want him to come. She rants that Ridge is not to come. Do not call the police she will handle this and get their son.",
        "Thomas looks over a sleeping Douglas at the cabin. Katie comes in to Ridge's office. He asks if she feels better now after sticking her nose in other people's business. She defends by saying he knows she is right that Thomas has the right to know Douglas is his son. Ridge did the right thing by telling Thomas himself. He tells her that Thomas irrationally took off with his son now. Caroline rushes into the cabin and wants to see her son. Thomas says he would never hurt him since that is his son. He wishes she would have told him. He has apologized over and over and he never meant to hurt her. That night ended up being a huge mistake for both of them, but then it produced Douglas so it isn't so bad after all. They created something so beautiful. Katie yells at Ridge that it doesn't make it right but surely Ridge can understand why Thomas did this. His entire life was changed today so they need to give it some time and he will return. None of this is her fault. No one knew he would take Douglas. Caroline berates Thomas for taking Douglas. His only excuse was that he just found out and he wanted to be alone with his son. He could not believe she allowed him to think this was his little brother after both of them created him. No one can take that away from them. Ridge can say he is the father but Caroline cannot deny that he is the real father. He understands now why he has been so drawn to him and so fascinated by him. This has changed his life. He feels now like a parent does when they look at their child. You cannot describe it. He cannot push this love down and pretend it is his brother. He cannot live with that. She told the whole world that the child was Ridge's. He needs to know this is what she really wants. He pressures her to answer."

        "Ridge: Well, they got to be somewhere in the building.",
        "Caroline: He has our son! He took our son. Thomas took our baby!",
        "Ridge: Breathe. It's gonna be okay. We'll find him.",
        "Caroline: He's upset, and he knows that he's -- that we lied, and he feel betrayed. What if he just takes him away? What if we never see my baby? What if I can't find him?!",
        "Ridge: Charlie. Hey, uh, have you seen Thomas? Okay.",
        "Caroline: What did he say? Where is he? Where are they?",
        "Ridge: He just drove off with Douglas.",
        "Thomas: That night -- that was a terrible mistake.",
        "Ridge: It was a terrible mistake. And mistakes have consequences.",
        "Thomas: No, no, no. No, you ca-- you can't be saying that -- that Douglas -- he's, uh -- he's my s-- my son?",
        "Rick: It's a blow to the entire family.",
        "Maya: I just -- I feel awful for my mother. I mean, that he kept this secret for so many years.",
        "Rick: It takes a lot of energy to keep a secret like that.",
        "Maya: It must have been so painful for Sasha.",
        "Rick: Yeah. She's the real victim in all this.",
        "Maya: I'm just still processing it. My daddy's love child.",
        "Rick: I thought my family was the only one that keeps secrets like that. ?'Ly",
        "Maya: You are talking about Ridge, huh?",
        "Rick: Yeah, the great Forrester family secret. Stephanie kept it for years until she couldn't keep it anymore.",
        "Maya: It seems that Ridge never had a good relationship with his biological father.",
        "Rick: Yeah, Ridge conveniently forgets that he's a Marone, not a Forrester.",
        "Maya: But Eric always treated him like a son, even after he found out.",
        "Rick: Well, of course he treats him like he's one of his own, even though he's not. Ridge is a product of a scandalous affair, which tells you a lot about who he is as a man today. He's always keeping secrets. It's the only way he can control people's lives.",
        "Ridge: You pumped today, right? So, the bottle's in the bag, and Thomas will know what to do.",
        "Caroline: I want my son, Ridge! I want my baby back. I need him. I just -- I need my baby back.",
        "Ridge: Let me call him again.",
        "Caroline: We have to find out where he is.",
        "Ridge: Let me call him.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Thomas: It's Thomas.",
        "Ridge: Thomas, where's Douglas?",
        "Thomas: He's with me.",
        "Ridge: Bring him back here right now.",
        "Thomas: I'm done talking with you, dad. Put Caroline on the phone.",
        "Ridge: I understand you're upset. B-but you can't just kidnap our boy.",
        "Thomas: He's my son, not yours. Put her on.",
        "Caroline: Where's Douglas? Is he okay?",
        "Thomas: He's fine.",
        "Caroline: Where are you, Thomas? You tell me right now. I want my baby.",
        "Thomas: I'm on my way to the cabin. But come alone, Caroline. I need to see you.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Rick: I-I know that I'm supposed to drop it, accept that Ridge is C.E.O., That he's living in the Forrester family home.",
        "Maya: [Sighs] But you can't let it go.",
        "Rick: Well, if Ridge wasn't always manipulating every situation, trying to rule everybody's lives, maybe then it wouldn't bother me so much. But it's not right what he's done, and I'm not gonna let him get away with it.",
        "Maya: Well, I think our baby's gonna be a good distraction -- something wonderful to look forward to.",
        "Rick: Yeah. I can't wait. And he or she will be here before we know it. That's why I want to settle this. I want us to be back at the Forrester family home, raising our child there.",
        "Maya: I know you're upset that Ridge moved into the house and that he took over as C.E.O. You have every right to feel frustrated, to feel betrayed. But you can't let it consume you.",
        "Rick: I know. I just want my dad to see who Ridge really is. That's the only way things are ever gonna change.",
        "Pam: Oh. [Chuckles] Excuse me. You know, I-I wasn't eavesdropping or anything, but were you just talking about Ridge?",
        "Rick: Why?",
        "Pam: Well, um, I think you might want to steer clear of him for the rest of the afternoon. I just hear that he's in a foul mood.",
        "Rick: Oh, really? Someone mess up his lunch order again?",
        "Pam: [Chuckles] Well, it's a little more than that. It's something about Douglas and Thomas.",
        "Caroline: I knew something like this was gonna happen. I knew that keeping this secret was a terrible idea.",
        "Ridge: We did what we had to do.",
        "Caroline: This whole thing is backfiring on us. Now our son is in danger, and everybody's gonna find out that we lied.",
        "Ridge: No. No one's gonna know anything. Katie's gonna keep quiet, and we're just gonna keep doing --",
        "Caroline: I'm so furious with Thomas right now. Who just takes a baby -- a little baby -- and doesn't tell anyone anything?!",
        "Ridge: Okay, he's -- he's not thinking straight.",
        "Caroline: That's exactly what I'm afraid of.",
        "Ridge: Afraid of what? He's gonna hurt him?",
        "Caroline: No! I don't think that he's gonna hurt him, but what if something happens? Douglas is just a little baby and he needs his mama. He needs to be with me!",
        "Ridge: Take a breath. Everything's okay.",
        "Caroline: No. I have to go! I have to go get our son!",
        "Ridge: All right. I'm coming with you.",
        "Caroline: No, you are not coming with me. You are staying here.",
        "Ridge: You're doing this alone?",
        "Caroline: Thomas feels betrayed, and -- and we have to respect his wishes. He just wants me to come. He doesn't want you to come, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: All right. Just tell me where he is.",
        "Caroline: He wants me to come alone.",
        "Ridge: Okay. That's fine. Just tell me where he is, and I'll -- I'll -- I will stay here.",
        "Caroline: He's at the cabin. But please, please do not come. And please do not call the police. I will handle this. I'm gonna get our son.",
        "Thomas: My son. My beautiful boy.",
        "Rick: What about Thomas and Douglas?",
        "Maya: Is everything okay?",
        "Pam: Oh, yeah. I-I'm sure that everything's fine. It's just I was keeping an eye on the baby, and then Thomas comes in and says that he's supposed to take him to his father. And then Caroline came back, and she got all freaked out because the baby was gone.",
        "Rick: So, what? I mean, what's the big deal? Thomas is his brother.",
        "Pam: Well, I know, but apparently they never made it to Ridge. Because Ridge called Charlie asking him if he'd seen Thomas. And I don't know. He sounded really irritated.",
        "Maya: Well, where did Thomas take the baby?",
        "Pam: I don't know. You know Thomas. I mean, he probably took him to show him off to the models somewhere.",
        "Maya: Douglas is pretty popular with the ladies.",
        "Rick: Oh, well, it's typical Ridge -- overreacting for nothing. Why would he care if Thomas is spending time with his son?",
        "Maya: I thought they were getting along better lately.",
        "Pam: Well, they have their ups and downs.",
        "Rick: I feel sorry for Thomas. Imagine what it's like being Ridge's son. And now Douglas has to deal with Ridge being his father.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Katie: Caroline told me that you talked to Thomas.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I talked to him, told him everything. You feel better now?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry.",
        "Ridge: About what? About sticking your nose in other people's business?",
        "Katie: Thomas is Douglas' father.",
        "Ridge: [Scoffs] This didn't -- didn't concern you at all. You should have just stayed out of it.",
        "Katie: Thomas deserved to know the truth, Ridge. And deep down, you know that I'm right.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Katie: You couldn't have kept this from him forever.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Now he knows. Ten times worse than it was.",
        "Katie: I'm sure it was an incredibly difficult conversation to have.",
        "Ridge: You think? Really?",
        "Katie: You did the right thing. You know that. Thomas is overwhelmed right now. It's gonna take a minute for him to process this.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, he's overwhelmed. I-I thought he could handle it. I, uh, thought he understood.",
        "Katie: Well, what did he say? Is he gonna tell anyone?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. He's sensitive and irrational. He took off.",
        "Katie: Took off?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. He left with my son.",
        "Thomas: Who is the father?",
        "Caroline: Stop! Ridge is the father. I told you that. I just said that.",
        "Caroline: A boy? [Chuckles] I'm having a son.",
        "Thomas: He's perfect.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Caroline: Thomas! Thomas, are you in here? Where are you?",
        "Thomas: I'm in here. I'm in here. It's okay.",
        "Caroline: Where is he?",
        "Thomas: He's sleeping. He's sleeping. Shh.",
        "Caroline: [Crying] My baby. Oh, my goodness. Hi. Mommy was so scared. Are you okay? Hi.",
        "Thomas: Caroline, I would never hurt him. He's my son. Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Caroline: I couldn't.",
        "Thomas: You know, we've -- we've been such good friends. We've gotten so close. And I-I felt terrible about that night. I've apologized over and over again. I've been beating myself up. I never meant to hurt you.",
        "Caroline: I know.",
        "Thomas: You know, that night ended up being such a huge mistake, something we've both regretted. But it couldn't have been so bad after all. [Chuckles] We created something beautiful. Our little boy.",
        "Katie: What do you mean Thomas left?",
        "Ridge: I mean he left. He -- he's gone. He took our son.",
        "Katie: Where's Caroline?",
        "Ridge: She went up there to get our boy back.",
        "Katie: You let her go by herself?! You didn't go with her?!",
        "Ridge: Thomas asked me not to go.",
        "Katie: Have you called the police?",
        "Ridge: No, I -- no, I haven't. I've asked not to call the police, so here we are.",
        "Katie: Well, surely you can understand why he's acting out.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Doesn't make it right.",
        "Katie: No. Of course it doesn't. I'm sorry. This -- this must be very frightening for you and for Caroline.",
        "Ridge: If I don't hear from her soon, I'm gonna go up there.",
        "Katie: Okay. Good. Okay, good. Well, at least you know where they are. [Sighs] Listen... it's gonna take him a minute to process this, okay? His entire life was changed today. He found out that he has a child. You have to give it some time, and everything will work out.",
        "Ridge: Oh. Will it?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I hope so.",
        "Ridge: You hope so why? Because of your part in this fiasco?",
        "Katie: This is not my fault. None of us could have known that Thomas would take Douglas.",
        "Ridge: And none of this would have happened if it weren't for you. And now Thomas is out there running around with my kid.",
        "Katie: His kid.",
        "Ridge: My kid! Douglas is my son.",
        "Caroline: You shouldn't have done that, Thomas. [Sniffles] You shouldn't have just taken him without telling me. I was worried sick. You shouldn't have...",
        "Thomas: I'm sorry. I should have asked you first. After everything that my dad told me, I just -- I wanted to be alone with him.",
        "Caroline: [Sniffles] I know that this is a huge shock for you. And I apologize for not being honest with you. I'm -- I'm sorry, but that's the way that it had to be. Please. Please don't be angry.",
        "Thomas: How long did you know?",
        "Caroline: A while.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] You know, dad told me about his vasectomy, his infertility. You didn't say a word. How could you let me believe that he was my little brother?",
        "Caroline: Thomas...",
        "Thomas: We created him, Caroline, you and I -- this -- this perfect little boy. He is a part of you, and he is a part of me. And nobody can ever change that. Nobody can ever take that away from us, not even my dad. That man -- he can say I'm insignificant. He can say he's his father, but -- but you -- you cannot deny that I am his real father.",
        "Caroline: Ridge is his father. In every way that matters, he is. He's -- he's my husband. He's on the birth certificate. He's his father.",
        "Thomas: Biologically, he's mine. And he always will be. You know, it all makes so much sense -- why I've been so drawn to him, why I've been so fascinated by him. He's changed my life, Caroline. When you were pregnant with him, you brought him into this world, and, God, it had a profound impact on me. It was different than when R.J. Was born. It was -- it was emotional. It was powerful. I didn't understand it, but now I do. I didn't know what to say. I-I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to think. I only knew how I felt. And I felt the way that a parent does when they look at their child. And you can't describe it. You can't understand it. You can't even imagine it until it happens.",
        "Caroline: We all just need to sit down and have a discussion -- you and me and Ridge. We just need...",
        "Thomas: [Scoffs] Dad already told me what he wants, what he expects of me -- to keep this story, to push down all these feelings and all this -- this love that I have and just pretend like it's -- it's for my brother. But it's not. I'm supposed to go around and act like that's my dad's child.",
        "[Douglas fusses]",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. He's not my dad's son. He's mine. I don't know if I can live with that. Can you? You're his wife, Caroline. You love him. And you told the whole world that my boy was his. And he's obviously determined to keep it that way, but... is that what you really want?",
        "Caroline: [Crying]",
        "Thomas: King Ridge running around, declaring things, claiming my child as his own. Do you really feel that way? Do you?"
