        "Stephanie: Your daughter's \r\nhusband? ",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, shut \r\nup! ",
        "Stephanie: This is -- this \r\nis sick. ",
        "Deacon: Now, wait a \r\nsecond. Stephanie, whatever you think you saw -- ",
        "Stephanie: I know what I \r\nsaw! Is there no one in this world that's safe from you, that you can something \r\nlike this to your daughter and to the father of this baby -- this baby that \r\nisn't even born yet? Oh, my god. It isn't Whip's child, is it? Brooke -- you're \r\nthe father of this baby? You're the father of this baby?! ",
        "\r\n**************************************************************************************",

        "Erica: Fan magazines are \r\nas close as I'm going to get. ",
        "[ Erica sighs ] what \r\nhappened to you, Zende? I thought for sure you would call. ",
        "Kristen: Zende, you \r\nhaven't even changed. ",
        "Zende: I was going to call \r\nmy friend. ",
        "Tony: Later, after the \r\nparty. ",
        "Zende: But I was going to \r\ninvite her to the party -- as my date. ",
        "\r\n**********************************************************************************************",
        "Brooke: That is \r\ndisgusting, Stephanie. He is not the father. ",
        "Stephanie: I saw the way \r\nthe two of you looked at one another. ",
        "Brooke: That's a look I \r\nget when I'm really annoyed with you! Nobody was betrayed! ",
        "Stephanie: You're such a \r\nslut! Sleeping with your daughter's husband?! ",
        "Brooke: Tell her, Deacon. \r\nDeacon?! ",
        "Deacon: Wh -- what does it \r\nmatter. She's going to believe whatever she wants to. ",
        "Stephanie: I know what I \r\nbelieve -- the two of you rutting like pigs in the mud! Oh, my god! Bridget? \r\nGod! ",
        "Brooke: This is not \r\nDeacon's child! ",
        "Stephanie: Why didn't you \r\nterminate the pregnancy?! ",
        "Brooke: My god, Stephanie. \r\nI love this baby. ",
        "Stephanie: I hope that \r\nword burns a hole in your tongue. This is your daughter you're talking about. \r\nShe needed your protection. ",
        "Brooke: Yes, and I am \r\nprotecting her! ",
        "Stephanie: What, from the \r\ntruth, from the fact that you're carrying his baby?! ",
        "Brooke: Yes! ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, god. The -- \r\nthe one thing that's -- the one saving grace about you is that you loved those \r\nchildren you had. I always knew that. I always knew that and believed that.\r\n",
        "[ Stephanie sighs ] what \r\nthe hell happened?! Did she turn out to be too beautiful for you, too much \r\ncompetition for you?! ",
        "Brooke: Oh, Stephanie, \r\nthat's sick! ",
        "Deacon: Stephanie, please, \r\nyou don't understand what's going on. ",
        "Stephanie: Shut up! Shut \r\nup. That girl is more than you deserve in a million lifetimes. And what have you \r\ndone with her? What have you done with her?! You tossed her in the gutter for \r\nwhat? The whore of Beverly Hills! If you weren't pregnant, I think I'd kill you \r\nright now. ",
        "\r\n***************************************************************************************",
        "Kristen: A date, huh?\r\n",
        "Zende: Well, not like a \r\nreal date. A friendship date. ",
        "Tony: A friendship date?\r\n",
        "Kristen: Honey, that's \r\nreally sweet. But it's not really a party, party. It's more of a small family \r\nget-together. So I think your friend might feel a little uncomfortable. \n",
        "Zende: No, she wouldn't.\r\n",
        "Tony: Who is this? \n",
        "Zende: Erica -- you met \r\nher -- the teacher's aide. ",
        "Tony: I admire that -- you \r\nknow, an older woman. But -- ",
        "Zende: She's really nice.\r\n",
        "Kristen: Honey, I'm sure \r\nshe is. It's just I find it a little unsettling that she's so much older. \n",
        "Zende: I really want her \r\nto come. Please, Mom? Please, Dad? ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************************************************",
        "Erica: I guess I was lucky \r\nto meet Amber at all -- see where she lives. What an amazing life they must \r\nhave. ",
        "Rick: Let me help you.\r\n",
        "Erica: It's okay. I've got \r\nit. My favorite. ",
        "Rick: I know. You're so \r\nsweet to get me these. Always finding new ways to make me happy. ",
        "Rick: Well, I'm just \r\ntrying to return the favor. You do so much for me and little Eric. ",
        "Erica: I enjoy doing those \r\nthings. ",
        "Rick: And I enjoy thanking \r\noh, Erica. ",
        "Erica: Erica? Erica? Like \r\nI could ever make a man like Rick Forrester happy. He deserves someone like \r\nAmber. Brilliant and creative and passionate and totally, totally into him. It's \r\nso cool that they found each other. Two people from such completely different \r\nworlds. ",
        "[ Phone rings ] please be \r\nZende. Please be Zende. ",

        "Deacon: Stephanie, please,\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Put a sock in \r\nit? How eloquent. ",
        "Deacon: Stephanie, please, \r\nyou keep talking about how much you care about Bridget. Whether you believe it \r\nor not, so do we. We tried to stay apart. She ended up going to Paris. My god, \r\nshe's engaged to another man. ",
        "Stephanie: Whip knows this \r\nisn't his child? ",
        "Deacon: Yes, he knows! \r\nHe's been blackmailing her since the press conference. ",
        "Stephanie: That's why you \r\nagreed to marry him? ",
        "Brooke: Yes. That's why I \r\nagreed to marry him. I just don't think I can go through with it. ",
        "Deacon: Brooke -- Brooke, \r\nyou can't go through it. Look, it's not going to change anything, baby. It's not \r\ngoing to change how you and I feel about each other. Next time, it could be \r\nBridget who walks through that door. ",
        "Stephanie: Maybe that's \r\nwhat you want. ",
        "Brooke: No, I do not want \r\nBridget to find out about this. ",
        "Deacon: Look, we've tried \r\nit your way. It's not working. Brooke, you've got to see that, now. ",
        "Stephanie: I think that's \r\nfairly obvious. ",
        "Deacon: So then you agree? \r\nWe have to tell Bridget. We'll do it as gently as we can. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, god. \n",
        "Deacon: Brooke, I -- I \r\nhate this, too. But it's the only way. ",
        "Stephanie: Deacon, would \r\nyou leave me alone with Brooke just for a moment. I'd like to talk to her.\r\n",
        "Brooke: Wait -- \n",
        "Stephanie: It's all right. \r\nReally, it's all right. ",
        "Deacon: I'm not going to \r\nbe far. ",
        "Stephanie: He makes a very \r\nconvincing argument. Especially, if it's what you want to hear. ",
        "Brooke: My god, Stephanie, \r\nwhy do you keep saying that? I told you, I don't want Bridget to find out about \r\ndeacon and me. That is why I'm willing to marry Whip. ",
        "Stephanie: Good. Good to \r\nhear. Because you are going to marry Whip. ",

        "Megan: Deacon, what are \r\nyou doing? Shouldn't you be at the party by now? What's going on? What? \n",
        "Deacon: I don't think \r\nthere's going to be a party. ",
        "Megan: Why not? \n",
        "Deacon: Stephanie just \r\nfound about me and Brooke. Yeah. ",
        "Brooke: So, you want me to \r\ngo through with this wedding? ",
        "Stephanie: Do you really \r\nhave to be told not to ruin your daughter's life? Have you even thought about \r\nwhat this is going to do to her? ",
        "Brooke: Yes, I think about \r\nit, Stephanie. That's all I think about! My god, I have nightmares. Just the \r\nlook on her face -- I don't want to lose her. ",
        "Stephanie: We will all \r\nlose her, Brooke. My god, she ended up in the hospital almost dead the first \r\ntime the man lied to her. ",
        "Brooke: I know! I know.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you know, \r\nyou know. But you couldn't keep your hands off of him, could you? The only \r\nwonderful thing in your whole miserable existence that you brought into this \r\nworld are those two children. And you're prepared to throw her away just for a \r\ncheap roll in the hay. ",
        "Brooke: It isn't like \r\nthat, Stephanie! We're in love. We're having a baby. My god, if you think we \r\ncould just turn our feelings off like that -- ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you're \r\nalways in love. When are you ever not in love? I don't care about your feelings. \r\nAnd the only person who's important, as far as feelings go, is Bridget. I want \r\nyou to give that man up. You got to do that for her. If you don't, he'll leave \r\nyou eventually. They always do. And then you really will be alone. ",
        "Brooke: I have been alone.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: I'm not talking \r\nabout being alone without a man. I'm talking about being without everyone -- \r\nyour family. When they find out what you've done, you won't just lose Bridget, \r\nyou'll lose everyone. I love that girl. So I'm going to help you. ",
        "Brooke: Are you going to \r\nhelp me, or are you going to punish me? ",
        "Stephanie: Don't you think \r\nthat's what you deserve? ",
        "Brooke: I didn't want this \r\nto happen. In fact, I tried to stop it. I did everything I possibly could, \r\neverything I knew how. You know, it hasn't been easy making this sacrifice.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Did -- did I \r\nhear you correctly? Do you think that you're the victim here? ",
        "Brooke: No. ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, you do! \r\nOh, my god! You see yourself as some long-suffering heroine who's making this \r\ngreat sacrifice for her child. How noble you are. ",
        "Brooke: No, I am not going \r\nto listen to one more word that you have to say! ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yes, you \r\nare! Get over here and look in that mirror! Take a look, you bitch. That's no \r\nhalo. And you're no heroine. You have done the vilest, filthiest thing possible \r\n-- sleeping with your daughter's husband. Now, you're going to marry that man. \r\nYou're going to go to that party. And you're going to put a smile on your face. \r\nAnd that's just the way it's going to be. ",

        "Megan: Oh, my god! \r\nStephanie found out? What do you mean Stephanie found out? ",
        "Deacon: She walked in on \r\nus. ",
        "Megan: Doing what? You \r\nweren't -- ",
        "Deacon: No, no, no. We \r\nwere just kissing. ",
        "Megan: Just kissing?!\r\n",
        "Deacon: I know! I know.\r\n",
        "Megan: What did she do?\r\n",
        "Deacon: Well, what do you \r\nthink she did? She pretty much lost her mind. ",
        "Megan: No, I mean, is she \r\ngoing to tell Bridget? ",
        "Deacon: That's just it. I \r\ndon't know. I mean, I think she wants us to tell her. They're up there talking \r\nabout it right now. ",
        "Megan: You left them alone \r\ntogether? No, deacon, you don't understand. Stephanie hates Brooke with a \r\npassion. She literally thinks she's like the devil. And that is long before she \r\nfound about you. Seriously, you have no idea what Stephanie is capable of doing \r\nto Brooke. You need to get back up there, and you need to protect her. \n",

        "Brooke: Who the hell do \r\nyou think you are? What gives you the right? ",
        "Stephanie: I'll tell you \r\nwho gives me the right -- Caroline and Taylor and Macy! Most of all, Macy. She's \r\ndead because of you. And I'm not going to let you do that to Bridget. \n",
        "Brooke: And I'm not going \r\nto let you tell me how to run my life! ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yes, you \r\nare. 'Cause you don't have the sense god gave a goat! I'm going to save you from \r\nyourself, ms. Logan! I'm going to save you! You're going to go to that party. \r\nYou're going to be the belle of the ball. And you are going to get married.\r\n",
        "Brooke: No! ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yes. And \r\nyou're going to live a long, happy life as Mrs. Whip Jones! ",
        "Brooke: I can't! \n",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's \r\nyour problem. Listen to me. Listen carefully. This decision that you're going to \r\nmake is going to affect the rest of your life -- and not just your life. \r\nBridget's, the baby's. You going to get it right this time! You need me to help \r\nyou. And you need whip! ",
        "Brooke: I don't need to \r\nmarry whip. I mean, I could just keep this secret -- ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, who are you \r\nkidding?! You can't keep a secret. What this is really all about is you don't \r\nwant to give up deacon. Because you think this is his -- your last chance at \r\nhappiness. I'm going to tell you, if you choose deacon over Bridget, you're \r\ngoing to give up the only real, unselfish love you've ever had -- your \r\ndaughter's. When you walk into her house tonight, her face is going to light up. \r\nAnd do you know why? Because she loves you and you're the most important person \r\nin the world to her. Do you understand? So, you're going to go to that party. \r\nAnd you are going to give up deacon tonight. ",
        "Brooke: I've tried. \n",
        "Stephanie: No. The only \r\nthing that you have tried to do -- as usual -- is get away with everything. That \r\nlittle game is over. You're going. Now, get dressed. ",
        "Brooke: I just don't think \r\nI can do this. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yes you \r\ncan. And you will! You're going to go to that party. You're going to be the \r\nbelle of the ball. You're going to put on the best show of your life. Because \r\nthis is the performance of your life. For the rest your life. Do you understand? \r\nI mean that literally. This is going to be the first day of the rest of your \r\nlife. Do you understand me?! Mrs. Whip Jones? ",
