        "Ridge paces the floor with his phone. Eric walks in and says he was hoping to get some grandpa time. Ridge retorts that Caroline will be on her way soon. Wyatt drops in on Liam just to see how he is doing. He says he is trying to help him and be a brother. He does not want him to hope for something so unrealistic. He and Steffy are never going to happen. Steffy opens the door and tries to block Quinn from coming in but she gets past anyway. Quinn begs Steffy to help her talk to Wyatt. She does not want to lose him. She mentions that she is in love with Liam and does not want to lose him either. Thomas holds baby Douglas. Caroline tells him that Ridge just called and she needs to call him back and say she is on her way home. She does call Ridge and says she is with Thomas and they are all fine. He understands. Caroline returns to Thomas and thanks him for letting her and Ridge be the parents, the greatest gift of all. She thanks him for being Douglas's brother. Wyatt tells Liam that there is a woman out there for him, but it is not Steffy. Just call Hope or Ivy. Liam says he is not interested. Quinn states to Steffy that she will show everyone if they give her a chance to see how being with Liam has changed her.",
        "Eric tells Ridge that it is good to see him thriving at work, living in this house with Caroline and having a new baby. Stephanie smiling from above would be so happy. Wyatt laments to Liam that he is not an idiot and his mother might have pushed it along a little way but with time he thinks he and Steffy would have married. Steffy tells Quinn that she manipulated her into marrying Wyatt. She was waiting for Liam the whole time when Quinn took him. She would have never taken those vows with Wyatt if it had not been for Quinn. Ridge is so happy to have Caroline and Douglas home. Caroline says Thomas over-reacted but they should not be too hard on him. He was confused and upset and he just took him. Ridge wants to be sure that Thomas agreed that Douglas was their boy. Meanwhile that is all Thomas can think about, that Douglas is his son. Quinn tells Steffy that Liam is not right for her so it is no secret why she chose Wyatt and is staying with him now. Steffy says Liam hates her and does not want to be with her. She needs help. Quinn says Liam had the chance to turn her in but this was all it was meant to be. Sometimes things just turn out the way they are supposed to. Liam says he is not defending Quinn but he was in pain and Quinn as Eve took care of him. She had him in her clutches and she did not have to be that good to him. Suddenly they realize that Quinn is with Steffy and both rush out. Ridge tells Caroline that Thomas owes him this child. Someday he will marry and have one of his own, but he can't have this boy. Liam is on the phone and tells Wyatt that the police should be there any minute. Quinn says as her mother in law she knows Liam cares about her and Steffy and Wyatt can help. The police push in the door and grab both Quinn and Steffy. Quinn screams at Steffy to tell them she was wrong. Still they put the cuffs on Quinn and she falls to the floor just as Liam and Wyatt walk in. She begs Liam to tell them that she did no wrong. She loves him and wants another chance with him. He looks conflicted."

        "Thomas: I mean, look at those little hands.",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: They're so cute.",
        "Caroline: They're miniature versions of yours.",
        "Eric: Ridge? Ah. It's only you? I was hoping to get some grandpa time in with Douglas.",
        "Ridge: Caroline's on her way in. Douglas will be home soon.",
        "Wyatt: Hey. Uh...",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. Come on in. [Clears throat] So, what brings you here?",
        "Wyatt: Just checking in, seeing how you're doing.",
        "Liam: I've been better.",
        "Wyatt: I can imagine. You know? But you'll -- you'll get through it.",
        "Liam: Yeah. What you mean is I'll learn to live with it.",
        "Wyatt: What other choice is there? You have to accept what is, Liam. Steffy and I are married, period.",
        "Liam: Okay. Was it superimportant for you to come here and do your victory lap, or --",
        "Wyatt: Look, that's not -- that's not what I'm do-- I'm trying to help you and listen to you and be a brother to you. I just -- I don't want you to hope for something so... unrealistic... because you need to hear me. You and Steffy are never gonna happen.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Steffy: [Gasps] No. No. Get out. Get out! Get out!",
        "Quinn: I need your help. I need your help, please. Please, can you please convince Wyatt to forgive me? I don't want to lose him. I don't want to lose Liam, either.",
        "Steffy: Lose Liam?",
        "Quinn: I'm in love with him.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Caroline: Uh, it's Ridge. Um... I need to call him back and let him know that we're okay. We're okay, right? This really is...what's best. Ridge and I will be his parents, and... you can still be there for all of it, just... as his brother.",
        "Thomas: Douglas can always think of me as a father.",
        "Caroline: He will.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: Caroline.",
        "Caroline: Uh... I-I'm with Thomas. We're fine. He understands.",
        "Ridge: He does?",
        "Caroline: Douglas and I will be home soon, okay?",
        "Ridge: Good. I'll be waiting.",
        "Caroline: Thank you... for letting Ridge and me be his parents. It really is just the greatest gift.",
        "Liam: You act like your marriage is so solid, but then you come over here and you tell me to back off, so, like, what is it?",
        "Wyatt: That's not -- I'm -- I'm just -- I'm trying to tell you how it is... and save you from a little embarrassment, man. Look, Steffy is taken. That's the reality. But that doesn't mean you have to be alone. Call -- call ivy. Call hope.",
        "Liam: I'm not interested in --",
        "Wyatt: Call anybody! Trust me. There is a woman out there for you. But... it sure as hell isn't gonna be Steffy.",
        "Quinn: You have influence over Liam and over Wyatt, too. That's why I'm appealing to you. I'm begging you. Help them to understand.",
        "Steffy: Understand what?",
        "Quinn: That I've learned, that I've grown. Give me a chance, and I will show you. I'll show all of you how my time with Liam has changed me.",
        "Eric: She must love this.",
        "Ridge: Being back up on the wall, looking down on us?",
        "Eric: Yeah. Just not -- not just that. Everything else, everything that's going on in your life right now -- living in the house, married to Caroline, raising your own baby.",
        "Ridge: She would be smiling about that.",
        "Eric: And not the least of all, running the business -- the one thing that she and I trained you for all those years. It's great to see you thrive... becoming the, uh, C.E.O. And the father and the husband you were always meant to be.",
        "Ridge: And leaving the not-so-mature days behind me. That's what you mean?",
        "Eric: Yeah, and just in the nick of time. All right, all right. I'm not the one to talk, really. I've taken this family through my share of scandals, too.",
        "Ridge: Like father, like son.",
        "Eric: You can say that.",
        "Ridge: I have to say that... 'cause you are my father. I don't care what Rick says. You raised me, and I have always tried to emulate you, and you know what? I-I hope... that I teach my kids the same thing -- that it's not always about blood. Sometimes it's just about being there... for your child.",
        "Caroline: We need to get back. Hi. Ooh. This is what's best for everyone. You'll see. You'll get married one day, and you're gonna have a family. That's the way that you should have kids... not like this, not... not like a scandal. I want that for you. I want -- I want you to experience that. [Voice breaking] I'm gonna take Douglas home now, okay? Thank you. Thank you for understanding that this is the way it has to be. Thank you for being his brother.",
        "Liam: Do you honestly think that you and Steffy would be married right now if your mother hadn't taken me?",
        "Wyatt: I-I mean... probably not, but we would be well on our way.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Wyatt: Liam, you and Steffy weren't in a good place. And, look, I'm not an idiot. I know that it would have taken time and my mom might have pushed the process along a little bit, but I do hate what she did to you. It was demented. And I still do believe that this is exactly how everything would have worked out anyway.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Well, I guess we'll never know.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Well, it could have been worse. At least Quinn took care of me and she nursed me back to health.",
        "Wyatt: Wait. Are you actually defending her?",
        "Steffy: You think I would help you...with anything?",
        "Quinn: Maybe. For Wyatt's sake. I mean, we are family now.",
        "Steffy: You manipulated me into marrying Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: I allowed you the freedom to really see Wyatt, and if you want to call that \"manipulation,\" I --",
        "Steffy: I was waiting for Liam! The day you took him, I was waiting, knowing that we were gonna work things out!",
        "Quinn: No, but you wouldn't have! That's the whole point! You're only prolonging the inevitable! That's why you and Liam needed some distance, because you've been on this vicious cycle before. But it's okay now. Don't you see? You're with the man you're supposed to be with. Y-you have the tattoo. You said the vows.",
        "Steffy: I meant those vows. But I would never have said them if it weren't for you. How could you possibly think that this is okay?",
        "Ridge: I can't even tell you how happy I am to have you guys home. Hey. You all right? I was worried about you. What was Thomas thinking?",
        "Caroline: I don't know. He was shocked, and he reacted. But in the end, he did do the right thing, so I think that we have to not be so hard on him. This is his child that he's giving up. We have to try to be a little understanding of that.",
        "Ridge: We what? Understanding? He kidnaps our kid and I have to be understanding?",
        "Caroline: I think he was just confused and upset, and he -- and he took him. He knows what's at stake now. He knows what's best for Douglas, and...",
        "Ridge: It's okay.",
        "Caroline: ...I think he just -- I think he just wished that we would have told him sooner.",
        "Ridge: But he agrees? He's gonna keep our secret? Douglas is our boy?",
        "Douglas: [Coos]",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Thomas: My son. My son.",
        "Quinn: It's okay, Steffy. It's more than okay. And you know it. I mean, if you didn't like being married to Wyatt, you could have gone back to Liam.",
        "Steffy: It's not about whether or not I like being married to Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: You're right. It is more than that. It's also about how much you don't like being with Liam.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Quinn: He's not right for you! And you finally figured it out! You had the opportunity to go back to him. An annulment would have been easily justified. I mean, nobody would have faulted you. Even Wyatt would have understood. But you didn't. You know why you didn't? Because you followed your heart and you stayed with my son.",
        "Steffy: Okay. So, am I -- am I supposed to be thanking you or something?",
        "Quinn: No! No, of course not. I don't expect that. No. Just, I mean, well, if you want to maybe acknowledge how things have worked out for you, maybe you would, you know, lend me a little support.",
        "Steffy: To you?",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: And Liam?",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: He despises you.",
        "Quinn: Who I used to be.",
        "Steffy: He doesn't want to be with you, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: See, I think you're wrong, because he feels the same as I do.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Quinn... you need help.",
        "Quinn: He let me go, and he didn't have to. He could have called the police and turned me in, but he didn't. Do you want to know why? Because he cares about me, too.",
        "Steffy: I was afraid he might have killed you.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Come -- don't you see? I mean, look! This was all meant to be, right? You -- you and Wyatt, me and Liam. It's -- it's -- it's unexpected, but, I mean, I never would have believed it myself when he passed out in front of me that I'd be the one to nurse him back to health, but [Sighs] You know, sometimes -- sometimes things just turn out the way they're supposed to.",
        "Liam: Am I defending Quinn? No. What she did was unforgivable. But... the thing is... I was in pain and she could have let me die. But she didn't. She didn't have to care for me, confide in me... share with me.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Wyatt: Share what? She's with Steffy.",
        "Liam: Who?",
        "Wyatt: My mom.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Wyatt: Let's go! Come on!",
        "Liam: Okay! Okay!",
        "Ridge: How did you convince him?",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] I just...said what needed to be said. You should have seen him, though, holding our son. I told him that, you know, one day he'd get married and have a child of his own.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, he will... have his own family. This one's ours. He owes us his son after what he did to you.",
        "Caroline: Can we please not go back there?",
        "Ridge: I just want him to know his place.",
        "Caroline: He does. He's the brother. A very involved brother, but that's all he'll ever be.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. 'Cause you're my boy, huh? No one's ever gonna take you again. Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. I'm still here. Okay. Thanks. Cops should be there any minute.",
        "Steffy: You think Liam could ever return these feelings?",
        "Quinn: Definitely. He just needs to be reminded what it was like when it was just the two of us, alone in our own little world, away from everyone else.",
        "Steffy: And you think that you guys will go back to the way you were if he just forgives you?",
        "Quinn: Maybe. You know, and Wyatt, too, with your help. That's why I'm asking you this, as your mother-in-law, you know, if you can help them understand, 'cause if I have you on my side... Liam -- he cares about me.",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. I mean, I finally found a man who genuinely wants to know me, not use me like -- like Bill or deacon, and he was so kind.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Quinn: Is that Wyatt?",
        "Steffy: She's in here!",
        "Quinn: What?!",
        "Steffy: She's in here! Help me! Help me!",
        "Quinn: No! No! No! Don't! Wait! No, please! Tell them you were wrong! Tell them to go away!",
        "Steffy: You're going to jail!",
        "Quinn: No! No! She doesn't know what she's talking about!",
        "Officer Lopez: Quinn Fuller?",
        "Quinn: Yes.",
        "Officer Lopez: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...",
        "Quinn: No! Why are you doing this?! You have Wyatt!",
        "Steffy: You took Liam away from me! You wanted him for yourself!",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Steffy: You want my support?! You're never gonna get it!",
        "Quinn: No! Wait! Listen to me, please! [Gasps]",
        "Wyatt: Steffy?",
        "Liam: Are you okay?",
        "Quinn: Of course, she's okay! I was never gonna hurt her!",
        "Officer Harvey: Let's take her in. We'll be in touch for your official statement.",
        "Quinn: Please tell them to stop. You're the only one who can make them stop.",
        "Steffy: Liam wants you locked up just as much as I do.",
        "Quinn: I just wanted Steffy's help because I knew that she would know how I feel about you! I love you! I do! Don't let them take me away from you, please! Please! [Breathing heavily]"
