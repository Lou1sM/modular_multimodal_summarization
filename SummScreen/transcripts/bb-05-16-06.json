Outside of the room Eric tells Bridget that if anyone can get through to Ridge, Brooke can. Stephen tells Bridget that he is there to make amends to all of them. He tells Bridget that he doesn't trust Stephanie's sudden change of heart towards Brooke. Nick rages to Jackie that he will not allow Stephanie to reunite Brooke and Stephanie.

        "Jackie and Stephen continue to discuss Stephanie's sudden change of heart to Brooke. Across the waiting room, Nick tells Bridget that Stephanie is determined to reunite Brooke and Ridge. At Ridge's bedside, Stephanie and Brooke tell Ridge what has happened to them. Eric enters the room and is happily surprised to see Ridge is conscious. Christian rushes in to examine Ridge, who has no memory of his collapse. Nick confronts Stephanie and tells that he wants her to stay away from Brooke. Stephanie tells him that she will fight just as hard to get Brooke and Ridge back together as she did to keep them apart. Brooke tells Ridge that she was afraid that she was afraid she was going to lose him, and lays her head down on his chest. With Brooke out of the room, Nick tells his brother that Brooke has moved on with him. In the hallway, Stephanie again asks Brooke for a chance to make everything up to her. As Brooke stands listening to Stephanie asking her to become a part of their family, both women are shocked to see Nick standing there !"

        "Ridge: Logan?",
        "Brooke: Yes, sweetheart, I'm here. I'm right here.",
        "Stephanie: She's back here with you, and she ain't going to go anyplace, honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Have you talked to the press yet?",
        "Eric: No, nobody yet. Somebody's going to have to pretty soon, though. They've been calling the hospital nonstop.",
        "Bridget: What do you think's going on in there?",
        "Eric: I don't know. I'm not even sure what to hope for.",
        "Bridget: Nick is pretty skeptical, too.",
        "Eric: Yeah, of course he is. But if anybody can get through to Ridge, your mother can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: Bridget --",
        "Bridget: Hi.",
        "Stephen: Coffee?",
        "Bridget: No thanks.",
        "Stephen: Your mother in there?",
        "Bridget: Uh-huh.",
        "Stephen: Bridget, I know we haven't had a chance to talk much since I've come back to L.A.",
        "Bridget: I know why you're here, Grandpa.",
        "Stephen: Then you know it's more than just your mother that I need to make amends with. You have every right to doubt me. And so does she. But I am determined to show the two of you how much I've changed.",
        "Bridget: I think the family just needs to focus on Ridge right now.",
        "Stephen: All right. You do that. And in the meantime, I'll be watching out for your mother. [Bridget scoffs] I don't trust this change in attitude of Stephanie's. This sudden show of remorse.",
        "Bridget: Remorse for what?",
        "Stephen: The way she's treated your mother all these years.",
        "Bridget: Well, I think it's about time.",
        "Stephen: If it's real. Even if she's guilty as hell about what she's done to Brooke -- what if Ridge recovers? Do you really think Stephanie Forrester has completely accepted Brooke overnight? I don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I am not gonna let Stephanie do this to Brooke.",
        "Jackie: What is she doing, Nicky? I mean, now she wants Brooke in Ridge's life. She wants here in the family after decades of trying to drive her away? It doesn't make any sense.",
        "Nick: Well, I wish Brooke felt that way.",
        "Jackie: Stephen thought so, too, at first. But now he's having second thoughts. Maybe Brooke will, too.",
        "Nick: Well, Stephanie has just offered her everything she's always wanted - acceptance, approval and respect.",
        "Jackie: Yes, but at what price? She's got to go back to Ridge?",
        "Nick: Well, that's what that old lady's hopin'.",
        "Jackie: Well, that won't happen.",
        "Nick: Mother, she laid it on heavy. She pulled out all the stops. She pushed every button Brooke has.",
        "Jackie: Brooke loves you, Nicky. And there are no buttons to turn that off. So you just put that worry right out of your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I knew he'd hear you. I just knew it. Honey, you're going to pull through this. You're going to be all right. Because of Brooke. Thank you, Brooke. Thank you so much. Thank you.",
        "Brooke: How are you doing, sweetie?",
        "Ridge: Been better.",
        "Stephanie: Well, you had heart surgery.",
        "Brooke: You don't remember?",
        "Stephanie: We were arguing and you collapsed.",
        "Brooke: I knew you were upset when I left Forrester, but I had no idea it would come to this.",
        "Stephanie: Well, it wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault. It's all mine. I'm sorry, honey. I just -- I just wouldn't let myself see how much she meant to you. I'm sorry. I -- I just -- I won't stand in your way ever again. I give you my word of honor.",
        "Brooke: Can you believe she's saying this right now?",
        "Stephanie: I just couldn't accept the idea that she meant this much to you. And I'm sorry it took this to happen. When we were arguing, remember you said, \"you've taken my life from me, mother?\" Well, here she is. Here's your life, it's back. Here's your Logan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: Nick doesn't look very happy.",
        "Jackie: No. He's even more suspicious of Stephanie than we are.",
        "Stephen: Well, he has reason to be.",
        "Jackie: Her behavior's really got him worried, Stephen.",
        "Stephen: His relationship with Brooke isn't at risk?",
        "Jackie: No. No, it can't be. Not after everything that they've been through. But Stephanie's turnaround has certainly had an impact on Brooke.",
        "Stephen: Well, how could it not? The way that Stephanie was treating her just now -- I've never seen anything like it.",
        "Jackie: Well, I have. She's pretended to be Brooke's friend before.",
        "Stephen: But that's not the feeling you just got, was it? Me neither.",
        "Jackie: Oh, it is just unthinkable for Stephanie to be reaching out to Brooke and inviting her back into the family, encouraging her to be with Ridge, right now. When Nicky and Brooke are just starting their lives together. Haven't they been through enough?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Nick, I'm not saying that it will necessarily work. But -- she may be what he needs right now.",
        "Nick: She wants them together again. As a couple. The future of the Forrester family.",
        "Bridget: Mom and Ridge?",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Bridget: So Stephanie is completely ready to accept her.",
        "Nick: Well, she's given her the keys to the kingdom. Rolled the red carpet right out to the front gates.",
        "Bridget: My grandfather told me that Stephanie's attitude had changed.",
        "Nick: Well, I don't know what you want to call it. I just don't want any part of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Logan.",
        "Stephanie: You two belong together. I guess I finally understand that now. It's not the medication, honey. I'm actually admitting that I was wrong. Hard to believe, but true. I just hope -- I just hope you'll give me a chance to prove that I mean it to the both of you.",
        "Brooke: I think Ridge is our top priority right now.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, but your being here is the best thing for him.",
        "Brooke: I would've been here sooner --",
        "Ridge: Thought I lost you.",
        "Brooke: I came as soon as your mother told me what happened to you.",
        "Stephanie: She was in Mexico. But she's come back home to be with you.",
        "Eric: Stephanie, I think that -- Ridge? Oh, my god! I knew it. I knew you'd pull through.",
        "Stephanie: Because of Brooke.",
        "Christian: This is Dr. Ramirez. Page Dr. Plotnikov, stat.",
        "Bridget: What's going on?",
        "Eric: Stephanie was right. Ridge made it.",
        "Stephanie: He came to as soon as he heard your mother's voice.",
        "Christian: All right, everyone, let's give him a little room. Ridge, the cardiologist is on his way. But I'd like to examine you now, okay? Do you remember being brought here?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Stephanie: I told him everything that's happened.",
        "Christian: The surgery was a success. Your doctor will explain the procedure when he arrives. You don't remember how you got here?",
        "Bridget: Nothing since the collapse?",
        "Ridge: Just Logan.",
        "Stephanie: That's why I brought her home to you, honey. Because the two of you share a bond that's -- unbreakable.",
        "Nick: Let's us have a talk. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: I just can't believe that Stephanie is so determined to reunite Brooke and Ridge.",
        "Stephen: She is not going to succeed.",
        "Jackie: But she's trying, and that means trouble for Nicky.",
        "Stephen: Looks like the kind of man that can handle a little trouble.",
        "Jackie: It's just another hurdle. Like all the others that they've had to overcome. It's just that it's so many.",
        "Stephen: Hey, hey, hey, hey. They are going to be fine. And we're going to make sure.",
        "Jackie: Wherever you came from, Stephen Logan, don't you ever go back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: What would you like to talk about?",
        "Nick: Just one thing. Stay away from Brooke.",
        "Stephanie: No.",
        "Nick: She may be buying what you're selling. I'm not.",
        "Stephanie: I'm sorry, Nick, but your feelings on this matter are not my main concern.",
        "Nick: My feelings are not what we're talking about here. It's her feelings for me that you oughta be worried about.",
        "Stephanie: Well, that remains to be seen.",
        "Nick: So it's you, Ridge and Brooke -- one big happy family?",
        "Stephanie: If she is the woman that he wants? Yes.",
        "Nick: You're lying.",
        "Stephanie: No. But for your edification, let's just say my point of view has changed.",
        "Nick: Oh, has it? Your point of view has changed. So now you love Brooke?",
        "Stephanie: I love my son. I want him to be happy. My not accepting Brooke all these years has literally broken his heart.",
        "[Nick scoffs]",
        "Nick: Please. What the hell do you take me for? I know you. I have seen you operate. You hate Brooke. You always have and you always will.",
        "Stephanie: I want my son's happiness. And if that means he wants her in his life, then I will fight just as hard to put her back in it as I did to get her out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christian: I want you to try and get some rest, okay?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Christian: He's still improving, but he needs his rest. The cardiologist is on his way. He'll probably want to run some tests.",
        "Brooke: Great, thanks.",
        "Ridge: I scare you?",
        "Brooke: You scared all of us. But you needed me. And I knew it. I had the strangest feeling that something was wrong. And I called the kids. But they were fine. But after that, I still had that strange feeling. And it was you. You were in trouble.",
        "Ridge: You came back.",
        "Brooke: You came back to me. And I am so relieved. My mind kept spinning. Thinking of the possibilities of maybe never seeing you again. And then maybe having to tell R.J. that he lost a father. And I could never do that. I really can't imagine my life without you.",
        "Nick: I'm looking for Brooke. I see you're doing better. You know, Forrester, I was on my vacation and your mother came and interrupted it. She wanted Brooke to be here for you. Now, whether that helped or not, I'm not sure. But I know two things have definitely happened. One is, you are doing better. And that's a good thing. The second is she obviously cares for you because of your history and because you share a child together. But don't get confused. She's moved on. And she's moved on with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Have you seen Nick Marone?",
        "Stephanie: Brooke? Is he sleeping?",
        "Brooke: No, I just thought I'd give the rest of the family a chance to be with him.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, well, he needs you now.",
        "Brooke: Dr. Ramirez said he's doing quite well.",
        "Stephanie: Because of you.",
        "Brooke: And nobody's more relieved than I am about that.",
        "Stephanie: Except me. 'Cause it gives me a chance to -- to make things right. I'm sorry.",
        "Brooke: Oh, Stephanie --",
        "Stephanie: No, no. I'm sorry, I have -- I've never given you the credit you deserved. Personally or professionally.",
        "Brooke: I'm not looking for credit. Especially where Ridge is concerned.",
        "Stephanie: Look, all the medicine in the world can't cure someone if -- I don't think he wanted to live without you.",
        "Brooke: He has his children. He has his work.",
        "Stephanie: And they mean the world to him. But you've always been his motivation and his inspiration. You know, for years, I -- I degraded that and made little of it. And I tried to make it all about sex. And it's not what it is. It's a real, deep passion. And that's what brought him back -- his passion for you. You felt that. You felt the electricity in that room. He heard your voice. He opened his eyes. He looked at you.",
        "Brooke: It was incredible.",
        "Stephanie: It was a miracle. Give me a chance, Brooke. Let me show you that I really am committed -- committed to bringing you into the family. Give me one last chance to prove to you that I can make it all right. I won't let you down. I promise. I promise."
