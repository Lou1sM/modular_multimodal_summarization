{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Liam sits in Bill's office as Bill opens more welcome back gifts. Bill says they are just pouring in. Bill asks if he has the animal piece ready. Liam says it will be in a few days. Bill says no, it will be today. He doesn't want to be a hard-ass about it but he's leaving town in a few days and he wants to be sure he has time to read it. Liam says he will have it. He wants to know where Bill is going. Bill says about as far away from here as he can get. Liam doesn't understand since he just got his company back and Brooke, so why would he want to leave it all now. Bill says he is not going to be gone that long and besides he has Liam as his trusted VP. He hopes he can trust him. And as far as Brooke, he would not leave town without her. She is the one motivating this trip. She knows nothing about it so Liam has to keep this secret. Liam says his lips are sealed. Bill turns his laptop around and Liam sees it is Dubai. Liam is blown away and says it is one of those once in a lifetime trips. Bill says it is making memories. Brooke gave him his life back, all of it, so this is just his way to show her what she means to him. Liam says most guys would just have bought her flowers, but this is like only old Dollar Bill can. Bill says lucky for Brooke; he is not like most guys. He promised her the world and he's giving it to her. Brooke asks Hope if she has any updates in her personal life. Hope says she is still dating both Liam and Wyatt and it is good. She needs this time. Brooke tells her there is no need to rush if she has feelings for both. Hope says she does. She could see herself with either of them. So she has to be careful and make the right decision before she moves on with her life. She knows both guys are frustrated but they are trying to hide it as they both want a life with her. She's so lucky but she doesn't want to drag this on. Brooke tells her again just to take her time and get to know both of them better and then when she is ready to make her decision and settle down, she will be glad she gave it this time. There is no timetable. Hope says but people will talk and it's not fair to Wyatt or Liam. She does not want to put them through this much longer. Brooke says the guys are fine. She is sure it's not a problem for them to court her for a few weeks. Hope likes the old fashioned sound of that. She thinks she deserves to be courted. She thinks the guys see it as a challenge. Bill calls Brooke and says he has something to show her; he'd like her to come over as quickly as she can. Hope pretends to be upset as Brooke is canceling their luncheon. Brooke apologizes and says it sounds important. Hope says she has issues with Bill but look how happy he is making her mom. As long as he treats her like the most important person in this world and makes her feel good about herself then she will be thrilled. So go and be happy. Quinn yuks when she finds cat hair on Wyatt's shirt. She says at least it is proving he is spending time with Hope. He says Liam gained points when he took Hope to the animal shelter but he is getting points too. Play time with a kitten usually drives girls crazy. Quinn makes a face at cats. She tells Wyatt that when Hope picks him in the end, and he will, just make sure Liam gets custody of the cat. She says they have new pieces to show Hope and wonders if Wyatt has signed the order forms. No, he says, but he will do that right now. He hesitates and is not sure what name to put. She tells him to be proud and use his new name. She says good job, he is a full fledged Spencer now .. Liam may have thought he had an edge, but no more. Wyatt quips that yeah they are both Spencers and both like cats so it's a level playing field. But then you add in his charm and winning personality She laughs Hope's choice will be clear. Quinn misses Brooke on her way out when she wanted to show her the pieces for the new collection. Must be off to see Bill, ah young love. She tells Wyatt she doesn't want to get in the middle of that. Maybe he should just grab Hope and take off too. They could take a cue from Brooke and go frolic too. They can start downstairs and see the new pieces. Hope says okay, they will frolic. Wyatt whispers to his mom that she is not very subtle when it comes to matchmaking. She says she knows. When they leave, Hope's phone rings. Quinn hesitates only a moment and looks at it. It's Liam asking Hope to meet him in the steam room. She deletes it.", "Hope and Wyatt come back to get the phone. She says she missed nothing but she feels naked without it. He hears the word naked and says they can lock the door. Well at least he tried, they settle for a kiss. Liam calls out Hope's name as he enters the steam room and decides that he is a little early. Quinn sneaks around and puts the lead bar on the door and turns up the heat to 135 degrees. She smirks when Liam gets hot and pounds on the door trying to get someone's attention. Brooke arrives at Bill's and says it is good to see him back in his element working so hard. How will he ever thank her. He asks where has she been in the Middle East as he has only the most romantic trip of her life. She thought Monte Carlo was pretty spectacular so how could he top that. They were in front of the Prince's palace and on his fabulous yacht. He shows her the laptop with Abu Dhabi and Dubai. He pulls the jewel box out of his pocket and she opens it. She's surprised that he saved the ring. He says of course as he knew the day would come when she'd want it back on her finger. He tells her that she is the only woman that has ever accepted him completely .who he is, how he thinks and he hopes he is doing the same for her. So he planned this trip to make it official .who they are and what they mean to each other. It's time for them to move forward. She has given him back his life, his company, his son. All that is missing is her. He says so let them start this adventure together. Marry him and let them commit themselves to each other for the rest of their lives. She can't say yes fast enough. He kisses her, then takes the ring and puts it on her finger and kisses it. They kiss again."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: Very nice.", "Liam: Another \"welcome back\" gift?", "Bill: They're just, uh, pouring in here, aren't they?", "Liam: Well, what are you gonna do?

Just where I left it. Oh, it's fine. I didn't miss anything, though. It's weird how naked I feel without it.", "Wyatt: Naked? What? Right now? Okay. You know, we should probably lock the door, though.", "Hope: I feel like maybe you misheard what I said.", "Wyatt: Hmm. Did I?", "Hope: A little.", "Wyatt: I don't think so.", "Hope: Yep. Mm-hmm. [Both laugh] Cute, though.", "Wyatt: Can't blame me for trying.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Hope?

I wonder where my mom went.", "Hope: I don't know. But I'm gonna text her, let her know how much I love her jewelry. They really compliment Caroline's designs.", "Wyatt: Yeah, but she also has an eye for couples that should and shouldn't be together, too.", "Hope: She might be a little bit biased.", "Wyatt: Yes, yes. But we should probably do what she suggested.", "Hope: With the bracelets?", "Wyatt: No. [Chuckles] No. Let's get out of here. Let's go hit the beach. Let's go somewhere.", "Hope: Well, I have a meeting. Can we go after the meeting?", "Wyatt: Are you slotted in for some Liam time?", "Hope: No.", "Wyatt: Hmm?", "Hope: No, no. In fact, he -- he hasn't called me today. I'm kind of surprised he hasn't.", "Wyatt: Hmm.", "Hope: I don't know. He must be caught up in something.", "Wyatt: Poor guy. He must be sweating it out over some fashion article. Darn it. I guess that means you're stuck with me.", "Hope: Oh, no.", "Wyatt: No.", "Hope: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Steam hissing]", "Liam: [Sighs] Got to be...a thermostat in here, right? Too much. Too hot.", "[Doorknob jiggling]", "Liam: H-hello? Is somebody out there? I think you locked me in here. Hello? Uh, hello! It's -- it's really hot in here! Hello?!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: A trip? Now?", "Bill: Oh, not just any trip.", "Brooke: Oh, right. The most romantic trip of my life!", "Bill: You are being sarcastic. You don't believe me?", "Brooke: Yes, I believe you.
