    "Recap": [
        "Quinn begs Liam to tell them how he really feels. They want to arrest her because they think she will hurt him but that is not true. She knows she should have called Bill or taken Liam to the hospital but she just wanted to help him get out of Steffy's clutches who was a better match for Wyatt. She was vulnerable with Liam and she does not want to go to jail for her love for him but it will be worth it. Caroline runs into Sasha at the Forrester pool. She says she just wants a couple of laps as she does not want to be away from Douglas very long. Caroline gets a text that Nicole is in labor. Zende is on hand while Pam whirls around for the next thing to do. Nicole tells Zende that if he wants to say something he better say it quickly as the contractions are coming pretty close now. She just wanted Pam to call him and he be the first to know. Sasha says she will stay out of this as she cannot imagine giving birth and then stepping aside. Caroline says sometimes that is what it takes. Sasha says yes but this is Nicole's first child and it seems a bit much.",
        "Wyatt and Steffy return and he tells Quinn it is not fair for Quinn to expect Liam to help her now. She continues on her reasons for what she did. If Liam presses charges she will go to jail but it will not change the way she feels. Her time with Liam has changed her and she has so much hope for what is yet to come. Liam opens the door for the police to take Quinn away. Liam tells Wyatt and Steffy that he understands if they want to forgive Quinn but he is glad he does not have to. Det. Baker interviews Quinn. She says Liam wants her in jail, so be it. Caroline tells Zende that Sasha is out by the pool but she thinks Zende could be with Nicole now and supporting her; better use of his time. Zende does go check on Sasha and she hands him some trunks and retorts that she went through his drawers and hopes he does not mind. She thought they could use some fun and sun. He changes into his trunks but says he really is not in the mood. She says okay, no beer or martinis but how about some iced tea. He agrees to that. Steffy tells Wyatt that she has never seen Quinn like that, so affectionate and vulnerable. Her feelings for Liam seem real. Liam goes home and thinks it over, all of Quinn's pleadings. Quinn tells the detective that she only kept Liam safe and she hopes she does not have to go to jail for that. Maya and Rick accompany Nicole to the hospital where her labor continues. She wonders if she should have asked Zende to be there with her. He is thinking about her and she is thinking about him."

        "Quinn: Please, Liam. Don't let them do this to me. Come on. Stand up.",
        "Quinn: Please. They want to put me in jail because they think I hurt you. But we know the truth. Tell them. Please tell them how you feel.",

        "Caroline: Oh, hey, Sasha!",
        "Sasha: Oh, hey, Caroline. [Chuckles] Uh, going for a swim?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. Uh, trying to get back into it after the baby.",
        "Sasha: Girl, you look fabulous.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Thank you. And you look like you're waiting for someone, someone that's obviously not me.",
        "Sasha: Uh, well, I'm surprising Zende.",
        "Caroline: Zende's coming?!",
        "Sasha: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: Oh, that's great. Now we have enough people to play Marco polo.",
        "Sasha: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: I'm kidding. I'm kidding.",
        "Sasha: [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: No, I'm just gonna do a couple of laps, and then I'll be out of your hair. I don't like being away from Douglas for that long, although Patti is amazing. And, also, I've seen Zende's abs, and I'm not about to get in the way of any woman's fun in the sun with him, so...",
        "Sasha: Mm-hmm. [Laughs]",
        "Pam: Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through. [Chuckling] Sorry. Oh, great. Um, could you grab some hot washcloths? Well, no, maybe they should be cold. I don't know. Just get some washcloths. We'll figure it out later.",
        "Zende: Okay. Why?",
        "Pam: Nicole's in labor! [Laughs]",
        "Nicole: [Exhaling slowly]",
        "[Stopwatch beeps]",
        "Rick: 50 seconds.",
        "Maya: And how long since the last one?",
        "Rick: About six minutes.",
        "Maya: Okay, so we should go to the hospital soon.",
        "Pam: Oh. Here, sweetheart. Sit on this. My friend Julie in my baking club says it does wonders.",
        "Nicole: Thank you.",
        "Zende: You ready for this?",
        "Nicole: Guess I have to be.",
        "[Water splashing]",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] That felt good. [Chuckles]",
        "Sasha: Oh, well, don't feel like you have to rush off. I mean, this is -- this is your pool, not -- not mine.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] Actually, I may stay and dry off in the sun for a little, but I'll head out when Zende gets here.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] Actually, you may be the one that takes off.",
        "Sasha: Why?",
        "Caroline: Well, if y-you want to go to the hospital. Uh, Ridge just texted me that Nicole's in labor.",
        "Sasha: What?",
        "Caroline: [Chuckling] Yeah.",
        "Sasha: Actually, um, I-I think I'm gonna stay out of the way on this one. I think -- I think this is a moment for Nicole to share with Maya and Rick. I still can't believe she agreed to be their surrogate.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] It's amazing.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, amazing. Yes. Absolutely. Still... makes sense why it was a deal breaker for Zende.",
        "Nicole: [Inhales sharply] All right. No offense to Pam, but I got to get off this thing.",
        "Maya: Okay. Oh.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs]",
        "Maya: Should we bring it to the hospital?",
        "Nicole: No.",
        "Rick: I'll get the car. You want to take her to the main entrance?",
        "Maya: Sure.",
        "Zende: Actually, do you guys mind getting the car together? I just want a moment with Nicole.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, what are you doin you have no right to ask Liam to speak up on your behalf.",
        "Quinn: He -- he's the only one I can ask. He's the only one who knows what really happened. I didn't hurt you. It was just the opposite. I nursed you. I cared for you. Let's get her in the car. The lieutenant wants her for questioning.",
        "Quinn: No, wait. No, wait, please, just one minute. Please just let me say this. Please. Please? I should have told you who you were from the very beginning. I should have called your father. I should have called Steffy. I should've taken you to the hospital. There are so many things that I should have done. But I didn't think it was right to put you back in Steffy's orbit. Y-you both had your chance. And it didn't work out. And I knew if she just had a little bit of time to see how wonderful Wyatt was --",
        "Steffy: You're digging yourself into a hole here, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: I am just telling the truth. I wanted Steffy for my son. And now they're married, and they're committed. And they are a much better match. What I-I didn't expect, what -- what took me by complete surprise... was finding a better match for myself. I didn't know that taking care of you would change me. Opening up to you... allowing myself to be vulnerable with you... is the greatest thing that ever happened to me. And if I go to jail... because I fell for you... then it's worth it.",
        "Nicole: If you got something to say, you better say it quick, 'cause I am due for another contraction soon.",
        "Zende: They ht?",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] I've had more enjoyable experiences.",
        "Zende: Proud of you. Hope all goes well.",
        "Nicole: it will.",
        "Zende: I'll be thinking of you.",
        "Nicole: You could, um... ask Pam to call you. She'll probably be the first to know.",
        "Zende: Yeah. I'll do that good luck.",
        "Sasha: It is so crazy to think about. My best friend is in labor. Like, she's having a baby.",
        "Caroline: Well --",
        "Sasha: I-I mean, you know, she's giving birth to one.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Sasha: I can't imagine being in that position -- knowing you're the biological parent, and then having to step aside to let someone else raise your child?",
        "Caroline: Uh... well, in many cases, that's what's best for all involved. And anyway, that was the plan from the beginning. I mean, this was -- this was Nicole's gift to Rick and Maya.",
        "Sasha: Well, yeah, the world's most extreme gift. [Sighs] I love Nicole. I do. But sometime she just doesn't think things through. I mean, it's absurd to have a child for someone else. And your first child? It's no wonder Zende ran.",
        "Caroline: Well, he didn't have to run that far.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Sasha: Okay. Okay.",
        "Quinn: Before they take me away, please, I-I -- I need to apologize. To all of you. Wyatt. There's only one good thing that -- that came out of all of this, and that's -- that's the pain that I wake up with every morning, the emptiness... it's gone.",
        "Wyatt: What -- what pain?",
        "Quinn: Being me. Feeling like I'm not a good person. I have been a hard, bitter person ever since I can remember. And the only way that I was able to survive that is -- is to shut off my feelings and not care about anybody but myself. And later, my son. Till now. S-spending that time with you, a man with no memory, I didn't have to hide who I was anymore. I-I -- I could show you my feelings. I can let you see who I really am. And I-I know it started out as a deception. And I feel so badly about that. But I don't regret how it turned out. If you press charges, and I go to jail, I-I totally understand. But it doesn't change the way I feel. And I want you to know -- I-I want you all to know... how my time with Liam has changed me. 'Cause it healed all my old wounds. And it filled me with so much hope of what is still to come.",
        "Liam: Take her away.",
        "[Police radio chatter]",
        "[Car door opens]",
        "Liam: No, Quinn wanted my help.",
        "Wyatt: She didn't hurt you, did she? Threaten you?",
        "Steffy: No, no. No, Quinn wanted my help. She wanted me to try to convince you guys to forgive her. I don't know. She's -- she's delusional.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] She's used to it, because I always forgave her. But now, how? How can I do that? After what she did to you?",
        "Liam: Well, she's about to pay for it. [Sighs] But she's your mom, you know? She's your mom, and she's your mother-in-law. So I know this isn't easy for either of you. Forgive her if you want, you know, if it feels right. But... boy, I'm glad I don't have to.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Lt. Baker: Oh, ms. Fuller. Good to see you. Have a seat. Thank you. We'll take over from here. Now, if you'd care to wait for your lawyer --",
        "Quinn: No. There's no need to wait. If Liam wants me in jail, so be it.",
        "Caroline: Zende! Did you hear?",
        "Zende: About Nicole? Yeah, yeah. Uh, I was just with her.",
        "Caroline: Oh, at the hospital?",
        "Zende: No, at -- at Forrester, before she took off with Rick and Maya. You know, I don't need to be there, you know, interfering with the moment.",
        "Caroline: Mm, that's what Sasha was saying.",
        "Zende: Sasha. Is she here? She texted me.",
        "Caroline: Yes. She's, uh -- she's down at the pool waiting to surprise you.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: You didn't hear that from me.",
        "Zende: It's okay. I'll act surprised.",
        "Caroline: Are you sure that's what you want to be doing, though -- you know, hanging poolside with Sasha? I mean, I know that you and Nicole aren't together anymore, but it might be nice if she had some support.",
        "Zende: She's got support.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, but... Rick and Maya are the parents, so they're kind of gonna be more focused on the baby. How wonderful would it be if Nicole had someone that was just focused solely on her? Or you can, you know, go swimming with Sasha. I mean, she's sexy and hot. I totally get it. She's probably the distraction that you've been needing. Although, there is something more meaningful you could be doing with your time. Think about it.",
        "[Heartbeat on monitor]",
        "Dr. Farrell: It's a good thing you came in when you did. These contractions are getting closer.",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm. Actually -- yep, here we go. [Breathing sharply]",
        "Maya: You're doing great, Nicole. You're doing great.",
        "Zende: Sasha. Got your text.",
        "[Pop music playing]",
        "Zende: Wow. [Chuckles]",
        "Sasha: Are you surprised?",
        "Zende: What is all this? What's going on?",
        "Sasha: This is a little break for us. Yeah, I figured we could enjoy the sun, relax. Sorry I had to rifle through your drawers. Hope you don't mind. So what do you say? We just forget all our troubles, enjoy each other, and soak up this delicious southern California sun?",
        "Zende: Just what I need.",
        "Steffy: I've never seen your mom like that. Have you?",
        "Wyatt: Like what?",
        "Steffy: Affectionate and vulnerable. It's like her feelings towards Liam are -- are real.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, they seem to be, don't they? [Sighs] I don't know what the hell is going on around here.",
        "Quinn: I just wanted Steffy's help because I knew that she would know how I feel about you! I love you! I do. Don't let them take me away from you, please. Please.",
        "Liam: [Groans]",
        "Edwards: And then how did you get out of the closet?",
        "Quinn: Wasn't hard to push the door open. The lock was basically useless anyway.",
        "Lt. Baker: Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. I took care of Liam. I kept him safe. And if the state thinks that it's worth it to send me to jail, if Liam does, then fine. I hope it doesn't turn out that way.",
        "Lt. Baker: Thank you.",
        "Quinn: Can you love me?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Of course I love you.",
        "Quinn: Your eyes are so gentle.",
        "Sasha: Grab you a beer?",
        "Zende: No. No, thanks. It's kind of early, you know. Besides, I'm -- I, uh -- I'm not in the mood.",
        "Sasha: I'm assuming you heard about Nicole?",
        "Zende: Big day.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, for Rick and Maya. It's so crazy. She's giving birth to your cousin right now. How messed up is that? [Scoffs] Okay, listen. Look, no beer. No martinis. I should go up and grab something else. How about... soda? Iced tea?",
        "Zende: Iced tea. Sounds good.",
        "Sasha: Cool. Be right back.",
        "Nicole: [Exhaling, groaning] Oh, okay. Okay.",
        "Maya: Okay.",
        "Nicole: Oh, wow.",
        "Maya: All right. You hanging in there?",
        "Nicole: Uh, yeah, no problem.",
        "Maya: Okay, good. Okay. Hey, what happened with Zende earlier?",
        "Nicole: What do you mean?",
        "Maya: Back at the office.",
        "Nicole: He was just wishing me well. He said he'll be thinking of me.",
        "Rick: Do you want him to be here? I mean, we don't mind.",
        "Nicole: No, no, I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable.",
        "Maya: Okay, well, listen. He's here in spirit.",
        "Nicole: Hey, did that nurse say she was bringing ice chips?",
        "Rick: I'll go check.",
        "Maya: A-actually, I'll come with. I-I have some questions I want to ask that doctor. Are you okay? Yes. Okay. All right. Let's go.",
        "Nicole: [Breathing deeply] Should I have asked him to be here?",
        "Zende: If this is what I think it could be, if this is what it feels like, I have to be honest. Nicole, I want to be a part of every amazing thing in your life. I want it to happen for both of us."
