        "\nStephanie: I know I don't deserve another chance. I know that. But if you'll \r\ngive it to me, I promise you I'll make up for everything.  ",
        "\nNick: Come on. It's time to go.  ",
        "\nStephanie: I can drive you home. And if you're not too tired, we can have \r\ndinner.  ",
        "\nNick: We're done here. You hauled us back from Mexico. She's seen your son. He's \r\ndoing better. I'm going to take her home.  ",
        "\nStephanie: You know, Nick, I've always found that Brooke was quite capable of \r\nspeaking for herself.  ",
        "\nNick: Well, it's a little tough for anybody to get a word in with you around.\r\n\n",
        "\nBrooke: It's okay, Nick. Maybe Stephanie and I should finish our conversation. \r\nWe owe it to Ridge.  ",
        "\n",

        "\nJackie: I'd heard there's been an improvement.  ",
        "\nNurse: Yes. Yes, he's conscious, he's speaking. His vital signs are steady. But \r\nhe's still weak.  ",
        "\nJackie: May I?  ",
        "\nNurse: Oh, of course. But don't stay long. He needs his rest. \r\n ",
        "\nJackie: I'm glad that you're making a recovery, Ridge. Really, I believe that \r\nthere is a lot left for you to do here. You've got a lot to give. Your children \r\nand Forrester Creations. I want you to get better. As do Brooke. And Nick. \r\nRidge, Nick is your half-brother. I know that there have been some very serious \r\ndifferences between the two of you, but you can't doubt his concern for you. I \r\nmean, he brought Brooke home from Mexico because you needed her. I mean, not \r\nthat she didn't want to be here. Your mother wouldn't have taken \"no\" for an \r\nanswer, either. But the point is that you are making your recovery. And we are \r\nall pleased about that. No matter what the future brings.  ",

        "\nStephanie: You saved his life. And I will never be able to thank you enough. \r\n ",
        "\nNick: There may be a few doctors and surgeon, and the entire medical staff that \r\nmay have something to say about that.  ",
        "\nStephanie: You brought him back.  ",
        "\nNick: Oh, please. You don't believe that any more than I do. \r\n ",
        "\nStephanie: I saw it with my daughter when she was dying. I put her baby in her \r\narms, and I saw what happened. And I saw the same thing today, when you spoke to \r\nRidge.  ",
        "\nNick: No! No! This is not about Ridge. This is not about Felicia. It's not about \r\nBrooke. It's about you and your guilt, because your son keeled over, because you \r\nchased her away! Now you want to bring her back to make him happy. Why don't you \r\njust go on a cruise or something?  ",
        "\nBrooke: Nick, please. Stop.  ",
        "\nStephanie: You and Ridge are meant to be together.  ",
        "\nBrooke: Stephanie! How many times did I tell you that I wanted your support in \r\nour relationship? I begged you! I pleaded for that! And all you did was strip \r\naway my dignity and my self-respect piece by piece!  ",
        "\nStephanie: I was wrong.  ",
        "\nBrooke: Even if you are telling the truth, I'm not sure I could believe you. \r\nI've let my guard down so many times with you. And I've always lived to regret \r\nit.  ",
        "\nStephanie: I understand, I understand! I promise you, I will never do that \r\nagain.  ",
        "\nBrooke: That's because I'm not going to go there again. I love this man. I love \r\nNick and I am going to have a future with him. I am going to have a family with \r\nhim. Everything I have ever wanted, I found in Nick.  ",
        "\nStephanie: Your destiny is with my son.  ",
        "\nBrooke: And I could have had all of that with Ridge, if you never interfered! \r\nYou have a wonderful job. And you have your precious, precious son. And you're \r\ngoing to have a great life ahead of you. But it's going to be a life without me.\r\n\n",

        "\nRidge: Brooke?  ",
        "\n[Ridge remembering]  ",
        "\nStephanie: Honey, I was wrong to keep you and Brooke apart. To deny you the one \r\nthing that you wanted most in this world. You said I took your life from you. \r\nWell, now, I'm giving it back.  ",

        "",
        "\nStephanie: Yes, Sally. Yes, yes. He's going to pull through this. Thank you, \r\nSally. I need you to put a press conference together for tomorrow at the office. \r\nWell, I want to make a statement, actually, about his health. But more than \r\nthat, I want you to let them know something's going on. Something -- something \r\nbig is going to go on. All right? I can't go into it right now. Thanks, Sal. \r\nOkay. Just take care of everything for me. Thank you.  ",
        "\nJackie: The nurse told me I could find you in here. Is this your new office? \r\n ",
        "\nStephanie: Hello, Jacqueline. Something I can do for you? \r\n ",
        "\nJackie: I'm here to talk some sense into you, Stephanie. \r\n ",
        "\nStephanie: I didn't know you had any to spare.  ",
        "\nJackie: Look, Ridge is doing better. That's good. But he's not exactly out of \r\nthe woods yet.  ",
        "\nStephanie: Your point?  ",
        "\nJackie: You drug Nick and Brooke back from their Mexican vacation to convince \r\nRidge that Brooke still loves him. That she's going to go back to him. Well, \r\nshe's not. She's with Nicky. They're going to be married. And for you to let \r\nRidge think anything else, to give him false hopes -- I mean, who knows what \r\nkind of damage you're going to do to him?  ",
        "\nStephanie: Funny, about people. How they always think they're going to marry \r\ncertain people. And then it just doesn't work out. You and Eric, for instance. \r\nWhat happened there?  ",
        "\nJackie: You used your dying daughter to sink your teeth into Eric. But it's not \r\ngoing to work with Nicky.  ",
        "\nStephanie: Is that why you're standing in Ridge and Brooke's way? Is that why \r\nyou're interfering here?  ",
        "\nJackie: You don't even like Brooke! You've done everything in your power to \r\ndestroy her. I've seen the pain you've inflicted on her, year after year. Is \r\nthat why you want her back? Because you've lost your scapegoat. Well, poor \r\nStephanie. Well, she's not going to come back, Stephanie. She's not. She's safe \r\nwith Nicky. And you're not going to drag her back into your insanity, because I \r\nwon't let it. And neither will Brooke's father.  ",

        "\nBrooke: The kids like the souvenirs we got from the hospital gift shop? \r\n ",
        "\nNick: Yeah. They'll never know we didn't get 'em from Mexico. \r\n ",
        "\nBrooke: I'm glad we came back.  ",
        "\nNick: Yeah. I missed the kids a lot.  ",
        "\nBrooke: Yeah. But, I mean, I'm glad we came back for Ridge. I mean, if something \r\nhappened and he died --  ",

        "\nBrooke: I know, but if -- if I didn't do something and I could have -- \r\n ",
        "\nNick: No, no. Don't tell me I'm hearing this, please. Don't tell me that you're \r\nbuying into Stephanie's pitch like this. Please tell me that's not the case \r\nhere.  ",
        "\nBrooke: No, I know. I know it sounds crazy. But she was right about one thing. \r\nRidge did need me. He felt my presence in the room. And he woke up. I really \r\nmade a difference, Nick. I did.  ",
        "\nNick: Okay. I'm glad. I am. I'm glad that he's doing better. I'm glad Stephanie \r\nhas her son. I don't want you to be part of it. I don't. I don't trust this \r\nwoman. I don't know what she's after.  ",
        "\nBrooke: I don't know either. But she really did seem sincere. I mean, why would \r\nshe say those things? I never expected that to come out of her mouth, not in a \r\nbillion years. But did she really mean it? I mean, is she really sorry for what \r\nshe did to me, and she wants to make it right?  ",

        "\nStephanie: Brooke's father? What does he got to do with her decisions? She \r\ndoesn't even care about him, much less what he thinks. And nobody else cares \r\nabout what he thinks. So if you'll excuse me.  ",
        "\nJackie: I've misunderstood you, Stephanie. For years, I've thought that you \r\ndefined yourself by your children. No, actually, one child. Ridge. But I was \r\nwrong. You define yourself by Brooke. Yeah. For years, she's given you a reason \r\nto live, a purpose. I mean, what would you do if you didn't have Brooke to \r\ndemean and humiliate? Who would you be? A word of advice -- please stop fighting \r\nRidge's battles for him.  ",
        "\nStephanie: And you're not fighting little Nicky's battles for him? If you were \r\nso sure -- so sure that she was going to stay with your son, you wouldn't be in \r\nthis room, would you?  ",
        "\nJackie: You're right. Brooke is vulnerable. But not to Ridge. To you. She's \r\nalways wanted your love and your support and your acceptance. I mean, look at \r\nall the amazing things she's done for Forrester Creations. Did it ever occur to \r\nyou once, who she was trying to please? Did you ever stop and say, \"Brooke, \r\nthank you very much, you've really done some wonderful things here\"? I am \r\nworried that she's going to fall for your smarmy gratitude. But worried that \r\nshe's going to walk away from a man who loves her, from a mother-in-law who is \r\ngoing to support her and her father who wants only the best for her, to come \r\nback to you?

And when I finally gave up any hope \r\nof any acceptance from her, she comes to me and says that she wants me to be her \r\ndaughter. And she told me she was wrong. She looked at me with so much warmth, \r\nso much care. You have to understand, I've been craving that from the moment \r\nthat I met her. So you might see how intoxicating that would be, right? If she \r\njust said those things to me years ago, everything would different now.  ",

And all I ever did was push her away and push her away and push her \r\naway. If had accepted her, who knows how different our lives might have been? \r\nHoney, when we were arguing, you said to me, \"Mother, you have taken my life \r\nfrom me.\" I didn't realize that at the moment. But I do now. And you were right. \r\nBut I'm going to get it back. I'm going to get it back for you. I don't love \r\nher. I can't lie about that. I can't change my feelings overnight. But I do \r\nunderstand something. I understand now. You love her. And I'm going to support \r\nthat, Ridge. I should have supported it all of these years.
