        "Bill tells Liam, Justin and Wyatt that he had that skyscraper in his hand until his do-gooder son had to go and shoot his mouth off ..but he has more important things to do today. He is getting married. He wants them all to be there. Liam says they wouldn't miss it for the world. Brooke explains it to RJ who is cautious since she seems to be still in love with his dad and they have a history. He does not want her to marry Spencer and then realize she really wants his dad. Katie takes a phone call in front of Quinn and says she really has to go. Brooke is getting married today. Quinn assumes that means Bill. Katie asks if that is a problem. Quinn says no; it does not matter to her either way \u0096 Bill or Ridge. Ridge asks about Brooke and Katie answers probably at her house getting ready for her wedding. Quinn talks to Brooke and assures her she has not seen Ridge except at the office for a while. She is committed to her husband and wants him. Quinn just needs to know if she is marrying Bill today or considering going back to Ridge. She asks if Brooke still has feelings for him. Brooke is outraged Quinn would be asking this question. She was ready to marry Ridge in Australia and broke it off because she saw them kissing. They are both so alike; they have a dark side. Quinn keeps at her.",
        "Ridge tells Ivy and Katie that he made a mistake but there is no more Quinn and him. So he has to find a way to make it happen again with Brooke. This is more than just him and his family with RJ, so he wants them to let this go about anything with Quinn. Bill says that he knows it was more than his charming personality and good looks that he won Brooke back over. Brooke tells Quinn she is asking far too many questions. She wonders what Quinn would do in the same situation. Quinn says they do have a long history together and share a son. There is absolutely nothing between her and Ridge and it will never happen again. She does not want her to have second thoughts about Bill though. Ridge comes in as Quinn leaves and he asks Brooke to please do not marry Bill today. Bill orders things for his wedding and says Brooke is his Queen and that makes him the King so it is a royal wedding. Quinn reassures Ivy that she has no feelings for Ridge and only regrets that she could have hurt Eric. Ivy is not so sure that she is over Ridge. Ridge tells Brooke that he would love one more chance. He is not in any position to guilt trip anyone. He made a mistake and he wishes he could change it but he can't. In fact they have both made mistakes but they always get back together. He's going to go home and wait for her and she will be in his life like when he came home from Paris. He has to say his vows to her again. He loves her and wants to spend the rest of his life with her as his wife."

        "Bill: I had that property in the palm of my hand, but my son here, dougy do- gooder, had to run off at the mouth.",
        "Liam: What do you want, dad? I can't keep something like that from Steffy.",
        "Bill: Come on! Of course you could have. But you didn't. And as a result, you cost us the spectra property.",
        "Liam: I'm sorry. I get it, really. But what you did, writing that dubious article, I mean, that --",
        "Bill: Listen, I'm not gonna sit and debate this with the king of all hall monitors. And besides that, I'm -- I'm focused on bigger and better things.",
        "Wyatt: Bigger and better than building your precious skyscraper?",
        "Justin: You seem awfully eager to get our downtown expansion up and running.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, he's obsessed.",
        "Bill: All right, look, I was hoping to close the deal before Brooke and I got married. But you know what? I'm not waiting any longer. We're getting married today.",
        "R.J.: You're getting married today?",
        "Brooke: Bill and I made plans last night.",
        "R.J.: So you're gonna be wearing that tacky ring for all eternity? What happened with you and dad, anyway? There must be a reason you guys broke up.",
        "Brooke: R.J., I will always love your father.",
        "R.J.: But you're upset with him. Can't you make this work? So you're gonna marry Spencer knowing how you feel about dad?",
        "Quinn: No, I say go for it. You know, when it comes to big statement pieces, our clients like to be a little edgy.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, you know, I never thought of using labradorite and citrine together, but it's really beautiful.",
        "Katie: Did you have a chance to look at my designs last night?",
        "Quinn: Uh, yeah, yeah. Um...I did, and it...looks like you spent a lot of time with it.",
        "Katie: Well, I-I know I'm not a designer like you two, but you've been very inspiring, and I'd love to get your opinion, and maybe we make a few tweaks, and then we show it to Eric, see what he thinks? I mean, it'd be fun to be a part of the new collection. Oh, gosh! Look at the time. Morning's flying by.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Do you have someplace you need to be?",
        "Katie: Yeah, actually. Um...Brooke's getting married today.",
        "Quinn: Today? I'm assuming it's to Bill.",
        "Katie: Yeah, of course it's Bill.",
        "Quinn: Well, I mean, I know that Brooke and Bill recently got engaged, but I also know that ridge isn't giving up on her.",
        "Katie: No, apparently, he's not. How do you feel about that?",
        "Quinn: It doesn't matter to me either way.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Quinn: Yes, really. I just didn't know that Brooke was getting married today. You know what? I am gonna go talk to her before she leaves, so I want to...go over some of these new designs with her.",
        "Katie: Well, that was odd.",
        "Ivy: You mean the way she asked about who Brooke was marrying, like she might be marrying someone else?",
        "Katie: Yeah. You think she still has feelings for ridge?",
        "Ridge: Hey. You guys seen Brooke?",
        "Katie: Not yet, but I think she's headed over to my house, because I'm getting her ready for her, um...wedding.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, the wedding. That's right. Well, if I have things my way, she's gonna marry me, not Spencer.",
        "Bill: Brooke makes an honest man of me today.",
        "Wyatt: That's impossible! Even she couldn't do that.",
        "Bill: Zip it. I want all of you there.",
        "Justin: Well, of course. That would be an honor, wouldn't it?",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. I mean, I'll try to fit it in, I guess.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I'll have to rearrange my schedule.",
        "Bill: Why would you aggravate your own dad on his wedding day? What's wrong with you guys? I have feelings.",
        "Liam: Oh, sure, yeah, like anger and wrath.",
        "Wyatt: Intimidation.",
        "Liam: Vengeance.",
        "Bill: I think you've covered it.",
        "Liam: Of course we'll be there, dad. We wouldn't miss it for the world.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. We know you and Brooke have been through a lot to get here, and we're all very happy for you.",
        "Bill: Nobody's happier than I am. Today, I am marrying the woman of my dreams.",
        "Brooke: I know it's hard to hear, honey, but I do love Bill.",
        "R.J.: But you also love dad. I mean, all of your history... I don't want to make you feel bad. Okay? But I just don't want you to marry Spencer and then realize dad was the one you really wanted. He's the one you want to spend the rest of your life with. And a part of me knows that you know that already.",
        "Quinn: Oh! I'm so sorry. I'll come back.",
        "R.J.: No. No, it's okay. I got stuff to do. Remember what I said.",
        "Quinn: Is everything okay?",
        "Brooke: Oh. Yeah. How are things with Eric?",
        "Quinn: They're wonderful.",
        "Brooke: You know, I told Katie not to say anything to him about you and ridge.",
        "Quinn: Yes. I know, thank you.",
        "Brooke: So, is this -- this thing, it's...really over?",
        "Quinn: I haven't had any contact with ridge.",
        "Brooke: Really? I find that very hard to believe. Since you let ridge move in to the Forrester guest house.",
        "Quinn: It's his family's property. And to be honest with you, it was Eric's decision. It wasn't mine. Brooke... what happened in Australia... scared the life out of me.",
        "Brooke: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: I don't want to lose my husband. I'm committed to him and to our marriage. But I have to wonder, why are you asking me this question? Y-you're supposed to be marrying Bill today. Are you... are you reconsidering? Are you thinking about... going back with ridge?",
        "Coco: So, is there gonna be a band at your mom's wedding? Or like a deejay or something?",
        "R.J.: Doubt it. She and Bill just kind of threw it together last minute. Actually just found out about it this morning.",
        "Coco: Mm. It's kind of crazy, like, Bill Spencer being your stepdad.",
        "R.J.: Yeah. Tell me about it.",
        "Coco: Is he as intimidating as he seems?",
        "R.J.: You know, he has his whole macho routine, but he's not that scary once you get to know him.",
        "Coco: Okay, so you're cool with it?",
        "R.J.: Yeah. Whatever makes my mom happy.",
        "Coco: You don't sound so sure.",
        "R.J.: Let's just say I'd be surprised if she actually goes through with it, given how she feels about my dad.",
        "Katie: You seem confident.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, Brooke and I would be married already if it weren't...for my mistake.",
        "Ivy: You and Quinn.",
        "Ridge: There is no me and Quinn. There never was.",
        "Katie: Ridge...",
        "Ridge: What'd I just say? I made a mistake and it's over now, it's the past. It's time to move on.",
        "Ivy: With Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Yes.",
        "Katie: Well, unfortunately, I don't know if she's ready for that, and she might never be.",
        "Ridge: We've both made mistakes in the past, and we always found a way to forgive each other because... I know her better than anyone, and I don't think she's ready to give that up. Just got to find a way to make it happen.",
        "Ivy: Well, you're running out of time because the wedding's happening soon.",
        "Ridge: But it hasn't happened yet.",
        "Brooke: Ridge will always be a part of my life.",
        "Quinn: I know. Do you still have feelings for him?",
        "Brooke: How can you ask me that? That is a stupid question, Quinn. Yes, of course I still have feelings for him! I was going to marry him in Australia, until I found you and ridge kissing on the beach! You know, Katie was right. She knew something was going on.",
        "Quinn: It was nothing. Really. It was --",
        "Brooke: It wasn't nothing. It was enough for me to break off my wedding. To break off my engagement. Enough for you to risk your relationship with Eric! For ridge to risk his with me. [Sighs] I will never understand it. It will never make sense to me.",
        "Quinn: To me, either.",
        "Brooke: You know, you and ridge are more alike than I ever realized. You bring out this dark side. You both have this deep flaw. It's in both of you.",
        "Quinn: I can't argue with that. But I'm confused, Brooke. All of this talk about ridge... you still haven't answered my question. Are you having second thoughts about marrying Bill?",
        "Brooke: Let me ask you something, Quinn. What do you think I should do?",
        "Justin: When you say you're gonna do something, you do it.",
        "Liam: And you do it with everything you got.",
        "Wyatt: You don't mess around and you get things done.",
        "Bill: Because I'm a winner. And winners by definition win. I have the passion.",
        "Liam: That's right, and you sometimes go a little overboard, but you do.",
        "Bill: A man can't be too driven in life, Liam. You can't have too much passion!",
        "Liam: I mean, come on, dad. You're like a whole other level. Sometimes you're a little intense.",
        "Bill: Do you have a point?",
        "Justin: Hey, come on. It's not necessarily a bad thing.",
        "Wyatt: It worked out in Brooke's favor, you know? You didn't give up on her.",
        "Bill: Correct.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, you went after it, and you never lost hope.",
        "Liam: I mean, look. Listen. Dad, even when it looked like Brooke was about to marry ridge in Sydney, you charmed your way back into her life, right?",
        "Wyatt: If that's all it was.",
        "Bill: I'd like to think it was just my winning personality and exceptional good looks, but I know there was more to it. And I'm okay with that. Ridge did something to screw up. Question is... what?",
        "Ivy: Well, it seems like Brooke's made her mind up, ridge.",
        "Ridge: So what do I do? I just let her go? I can't lose her. I can't let that happen.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, it may not be up to you.",
        "Ridge: If I can just get her to see...",
        "Katie: I mean, how could you do something like that, ridge? Come on, with your father's wife...",
        "Ridge: I made a mistake! Whatever happened between me and Quinn, can we just not mention anymore? Come on, this is not just about me. It's about my family, it's about R.J. Now, give me a break.",
        "R.J.: You know, my dad is still madly in love with my mom.",
        "Coco: How does your mom feel?",
        "R.J.: She said she'll always love him.",
        "Coco: Okay, well, then maybe they'll find their way back to each other.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, well... never underestimate my father, okay? He can turn on that Forrester charm like nobody can.",
        "Coco: Oh! Okay, so, Forrester charm... does that run in the family?",
        "R.J.: You know, I think so.",
        "Coco: Yeah?",
        "R.J.: Mm-hmm.",
        "Coco: Okay.",
        "Brooke: You're just asking way too many questions, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: I'm just curious.",
        "Brooke: Well, let's see. I have two men that are interested in me, but they have a history with you. So I'm curious -- what would you do if you were in my position?",
        "Quinn: Well, that's a ridiculous question. I'm happily married to Eric, and Bill and I have never gotten along, and ridge, he...",
        "Brooke: What about ridge?",
        "Quinn: You two have a long history together. You share a son.",
        "Brooke: Ah! Yes. So, then, it wouldn't upset you if I were to marry ridge.",
        "Quinn: Brooke, why are you talking like this? I mean, I see Bill's very... interesting engagement ring on your finger, and you're marrying him today... there is absolutely nothing between me and ridge. Whatever it was, it's over. Nothing is gonna happen. Nothing will ever happen. Please. I need you to believe me. Please believe me. So, what is this? Are you having second thoughts about Bill?",
        "Ridge: Hey. There you are.",
        "Quinn: I should get back to work.",
        "Ridge: Don't do it. Don't marry Spencer. You're gonna regret it.",
        "Bill: Get that triple berry cake from, uh... what is that store? On Melrose. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the one. That's Brooke's favorite. And security. Beef up security. I want twice as many Dobermans. Yes, you heard me. I don't want any uninvited guests on my property. What else? Oh, flowers. Flowers. Uh... let's get, uh, roses and, uh... and peonies. Yeah, get every one you can find. Only the best for my bride. All right.",
        "Justin: Dobermans? Really, dude?",
        "Bill: I love Dobermans. They're killers.",
        "Liam: And peonies?",
        "Bill: Yeah. I happen to love peonies. They're, uh, beautiful.",
        "Wyatt: You're acting like this is some kind of royal wedding!",
        "Bill: Brooke's my queen, and I'm obviously the king. That makes it royal. This is going to be a monumental day. I want it to be perfect.",
        "Liam: Who else, uh -- who else did you invite?",
        "Bill: Well, I invited... well, actually just you guys, give or take a few. Yeah, too many people, it gets too complicated. And Brooke and I, we're about un-complicating our lives. Committing ourselves to each other. Spending the rest of our lives together.",
        "Ivy: Ridge isn't giving up on Brooke. He was just here talking to me and Katie.",
        "Quinn: So?",
        "Ivy: Quinn, you can be honest with me.",
        "Quinn: Honest with you about what?",
        "Ivy: About your feelings for ridge.",
        "Quinn: I don't have any feelings for ridge. Except regret and remorse for betraying Eric. That's all.",
        "Ivy: Okay, so, if Brooke changed her mind and she ended up marrying ridge today, you'd be totally fine with it.",
        "Quinn: Why does everyone keep asking me that question?",
        "Ivy: Did Brooke ask you the same thing?",
        "Quinn: Yes!",
        "Ivy: And what did you tell her?",
        "Quinn: I told her it wouldn't bother me at all if she and ridge got married. What ridge does with his life does not affect me. I'm Eric's wife! I'm committed to him!",
        "Ivy: But, Quinn, have you forgotten what you and ridge shared? Have you truly gotten over him?",
        "Brooke: I already spoke to R.J. He seems okay with it.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's R.J. He's not gonna guilt-trip anybody. Not his style. Not my style, either.",
        "Brooke: Good.",
        "Ridge: Plus, I'm in no position to guilt-trip anybody. I know that. I would just love one more chance.",
        "Brooke: Ridge...",
        "Ridge: I made a mistake. I made a huge mistake. And if -- if there were a way to go back in time and change it, I would, but I can't.",
        "Brooke: No, you can't.",
        "Ridge: But we've both made mistakes over the years. And we always found our way back to each other, so let's -- let's not make another mistake that we can't come back from. I know you want to get married today, and you should. But not to Spencer. You should marry me. So I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go to the house. And I'm gonna wait for you, and when you get there, we'll walk down to the fountain together. That's the place where this last chapter started, when I got back from Paris. You remember. I know you do. Come home to me. Come home to the place that's just...filled with so many memories, and we'll make more. You, me, and R.J., We'll just -- we'll make more right there, and this is where I want to commit to you. I want to say my vows to you. I have to. It's you. It's us. And it's always been you. Always. I want to spend the rest of my days with you because I love you. So marry me. Be my wife. ."
