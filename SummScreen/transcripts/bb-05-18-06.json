        "Dr. Plotinkov: You're doing remarkably well, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: You know why, don't you?",
        "Dr. Plotinkov: Your cardiologist is a genius?",
        "Ridge: Oh, no offense, doc, but what I needed, you couldn't give me.",
        "Brooke: Bad time?",
        "Ridge: Brooke, R.J. have you met Dr. Plotnikov?",
        "Brooke: No, but I've been wanting to thank you.",
        "Dr. Plotnikov: I've been wanting to thank you. Yours was the kiss that woke the sleeping beauty.",
        "Ridge: Okay, get out of here.",
        "Dr. Plotnikov: I'll check back in a little later.",
        "Ridge: How's my boy?",
        "Brooke: He couldn't wait to visit you.",
        "Ridge: He's growing so fast. I don't want to miss another minute.",
        "Brooke: You don't have to. Your son adores you.",
        "Ridge: I adore him. Yes, I do. I adore you, too. We're a family, Logan. It's a new beginning for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hello, beautiful.",
        "Jackie: Nicky, what a lovely surprise.",
        "Nick: Technically, you're not opened for business yet, are you?",
        "Jackie: No, not yet. Some sort of inventory arrived while I was detained.",
        "Nick: Well, I got your paperwork.",
        "Jackie: And?",
        "Nick: The attorneys went over everything -- divorce agreement, contracts, deeds, tight as a drum.",
        "Jackie: Massimo can't touch me?",
        "Nick: This business is 100% yours to do with as you please.",
        "Jackie: Oh, thank goodness. I had to be sure, you know?",
        "Nick: Nothing to worry about, Mother.",
        "Jackie: Where's Brooke?",
        "Nick: She took R.J. over to the hospital to see his father.",
        "Jackie: Is that wise?",
        "Nick: Well, what's he going to do?",
        "Jackie: She's very vulnerable, Nicky. I mean, Stephanie's convinced her she almost single-handedly saved Ridge.",
        "Nick: The Forresters are poison, Mother. Brooke knows that.",
        "Jackie: On one level, yes. But she would like nothing better than to belong. And Stephanie has offered her a place in the family --",
        "Nick: And she said \"No.\"",
        "Jackie: That isn't a word that Stephanie is used to hearing.",
        "Nick: Mother -- Brooke's with me, and there is nothing Stephanie can do to change that.",

        "Stephanie: Did you talk to the people at video?",
        "Sally: Casey is still editing, okay? But it will be ready in time for the press conference.",
        "Stephanie: Great, now flowers?",
        "Sally: Relax, I do know how to throw a party -- even Forrester style.",
        "Stephanie: It's just that it's a really important event, Sally.",
        "Sally: All right, all right. And when the press gets wind of what you've got planned, tongues are going to be wagging for weeks on end.",
        "Eric: Stephanie, what the hell is going on down there?",
        "Thorne: Why is Jarrett Maxwell calling, asking about a press conference?",
        "Stephanie: Let's go into the office just for a minute. Thanks, Sally. There's some things I need to discuss with you. And well, I'm going to make some changes.",
        "Eric: What kind of changes?",
        "Stephanie: This has been a very difficult time for both of you. You've handled it really gracefully and I want you to know, I appreciate it so much.",
        "Thorne: What changes, mother?",
        "Stephanie: I'm stepping aside as CEO.",
        "Eric: You're resigning?",
        "Thorne: Well, it's your company. Have you chosen your successor?",
        "Stephanie: It's our company, Thorne. And I know I took -- I took the company in a more conservative way than you wanted. You didn't necessarily agree, but you did support me 100%.",
        "Thorne: Well, sales aren't what they should be, mother, but we can turn it around.",
        "Stephanie: I agree with you.",
        "Eric: With the right leadership.",
        "Stephanie: Yes. I know you want to be CEO of your own company again. But I have chosen someone I think needs it more right now.",
        "Eric: I think that would make Ridge very, very happy.",
        "Stephanie: I hope so. It's something he's wanted for a long time. I'm bringing Brooke back. I'm making her CEO.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Forgive me for playing the devil's advocate, but when Stephanie wants something --",
        "Nick: What's she going to do, Mother? She offered her a seat at the head of the Forrester table. She's not interested.",
        "Jackie: She'll find another way.",
        "Nick: There is no other way.",
        "Jackie: Everything wants something, nNicky. They want fame or power or acceptance. Everyone has their price.",
        "Nick: Brooke has everything she needs. Except this purse, actually.",
        "Jackie: Stop playing. Of course she has everything she needs. She has you. She loves you with all her heart, but --",
        "[Nick sighs]",
        "Nick: But what?",
        "Jackie: Does she have everything she wants?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Brooke. You can't be serious.",
        "Stephanie: I've never been more serious in my life.",
        "Thorne: Have you forgotten what happened the last time she ran things?",
        "Stephanie: Yes, we made a lot of money.",
        "Eric: You hated everything she did.",
        "Stephanie: True, but the licensing fees from the belief formula put us over the top.",
        "Eric: And you were hell-bent on selling that to the highest bidder.",
        "Stephanie: I was wrong.",
        "Thorne: What about the \"bedroom\" line? You know she's going to want to bring that back.",
        "Stephanie: I'm counting on it. As a matter of fact, I think I'll bring it back. It was one of the most profitable lines we had.",
        "Eric: And you said it made us look cheap and tawdry.",
        "Stephanie: I was wrong.",
        "Eric: When were you planning on discussing this?",
        "Stephanie: Well, we're discussing it now.",
        "Eric: And Ridge and Brooke, shouldn't they be here for that?",
        "Stephanie: They don't know about it yet.",
        "Eric: Excuse me? Where the hell are you coming from, with all this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I am going to be out of here real soon. And I'm going to take you to the zoo. Just the two of us. Unless mommy wants to come with us. Help keep us out of trouble.",
        "Brooke: Maybe. Catherine, hi.",
        "Catherine: Hi. Ridge, how are you feeling?",
        "Ridge: Happy.",
        "Brooke: R.J. loves spending time with his daddy.",
        "Catherine: I can come back.",
        "Brooke: Actually, Ridge --",
        "Ridge: What, and miss play group?",
        "Brooke: He does need to rest. Sorry. Here you go. Say bye to daddy!",
        "Catherine: Say \"bye\"!",
        "R.J.: Bye!",
        "Ridge: Bye! See you guys later.",
        "Catherine: Bye.",
        "Ridge: Thanks for bringing him by.",
        "Brooke: I wasn't sure if all this would scare him.",
        "Ridge: His old man flat on his back?",
        "Brooke: Well, just the machines and all the medical stuff.",
        "Ridge: Did it scare you?",
        "Brooke: Stephanie did try to warn me, of course. But it wasn't until I came in here and I saw how fragile you were. That was the scariest time in my life.",
        "Ridge: Sorry.",
        "Brooke: Just don't ever do it again. I don't think my heart can take it.",
        "Ridge: No pun intended. I remember what you said.",
        "Brooke: When I left Forrester?",
        "Ridge: No, when mother brought you back from Cabo. You said you'd never walk away from me. You'd always -- we'd always be together.",
        "Brooke: We have a beautiful little boy together.",
        "Ridge: And you said you love me and you never stopped.",
        "Brooke: You heard that?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Just like you heard me needing you from a thousand miles away.",
        "Brooke: I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Ridge: Why are you here?",
        "Brooke: What kind of a question is that?",
        "Ridge: Hopefully a direct one.",
        "Brooke: I do love you, Ridge. I will always love you.",
        "Ridge: Because I'm R.J.'s father? Or because I almost died?",
        "Brooke: You think I'm here out of pity?",
        "Ridge: Are you?",
        "Brooke: I wish to god this hadn't happened. The thought of you in any kind of pain --",
        "Ridge: I don't want you feeling sorry for me. I'm going to be okay.",
        "Brooke: I know you are. You look 100% better already.",
        "Ridge: I've been given a second chance. I'm willing to make the most of it.",
        "Brooke: And you should.",
        "Ridge: Do you believe what my mother said? About her regretting all the things she did to you?",
        "Brooke: I believe that she believes it.",
        "Ridge: She begged my forgiveness.",
        "Brooke: Well, you're not the one that she tortured for so many years. I can't believe we're talking about Stephanie again.",
        "Ridge: You have no reason at all to trust her or me. But I swear to you, it's going to be different this time.",
        "Brooke: She took away my dignity. My self-respect. I let her. I was young, naive. I just wanted her acceptance.",
        "Ridge: I regret more than anything not standing up to her a number of times, not putting you first, always. I'm the reason that we're not together.",
        "Brooke: Let's not do this, okay?",
        "Ridge: What? Love you? I'm never going to stop loving you, Logan.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry. I came back here because you needed me. I just want you to know that you can always count on me.",
        "Ridge: I just can't have you?",
        "Brooke: I wish things had been different.",
        "Ridge: So do I. So do I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: The truth is, they're not together because of me.",
        "Thorne: That's never bothered you before.",
        "Stephanie: Well, my son's never collapsed at my feet before.",
        "Thorne: If only he had known.",
        "Stephanie: It's not too late.",
        "Eric: For whom? For Ridge? For Brooke? Or for you?",
        "Stephanie: For all of us. I mean, who knows what would have happened to all of our lives, if I'd just accepted the girl into the family? Maybe you and I would never have ended up divorced in the first place. Maybe he never would have had his heart broken.",
        "Eric: Look, this isn't going to take care of everything.",
        "Thorne: Brooke is with nick now, Mother.",
        "Stephanie: Because I drove her away. She's never believed -- she never believe that I could possibly accept her.",
        "Eric: Yeah, this is all coming just out of left field, here.",
        "Stephanie: I agree. Eric, when she ran the company, she did a really outstanding job. She belongs here. She deserves it. You're the one that's always wanted her here at Forrester. I need your support in this.",
        "Eric: All right. I'll support you in this.",
        "Stephanie: Thorne?",
        "Thorne: Are you sure about this? Well, if he's crazy enough to go along with it, I guess I can, too.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you. I love you.",
        "Thorne: I love you, too.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Mother, I am giving Brooke everything that she wants and needs. But I would like to talk to you about business.",
        "Jackie: My business?",
        "Nick: Yes, your business, because I think you need a little help around here. I think you need someone with -- with some experience. How many new stores do you open a year?",
        "Jackie: Two, three.",
        "Nick: Exactly my point. Do you know how big of an undertaking that is? I think Brooke could make \"Jackie M.\" A household word in every country in the world.",
        "Jackie: Do you think she'd consider working with me?",
        "Nick: Why don't you ask her?",
        "Jackie: Hi! Would you like some coffee, or -- ?",
        "Brooke: Oh, no. No, thank you.",
        "Nick: Are you okay? You look like you just had a root canal.",
        "Brooke: No, I'm fine. Ridge just wants something I can't give him. He's confusing caring with commitment.",
        "Nick: Well, how did you leave it?",
        "Brooke: I think he heard me this time.",
        "Jackie: Oh, Nicky and I, we were just talking about how well the boutiques are doing.",
        "Brooke: Oh, you should be very proud.",
        "Jackie: Yes, Brooke, I am. I've worked very, very hard. But I've taken them as far as I can go. Unless, of course, I expand. And then, to do that, I need some help. I need someone -- someone I could trust. I'd really like that person to be you, Brooke. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: You know, I have to admit, this \"change of heart\" of yours --",
        "Stephanie: I know, it's very difficult to believe. I've hated the girl since I laid eyes on her. It's the truth.",
        "Eric: And it's ruled this family for a lot of years.",
        "Stephanie: I know.",
        "Eric: You're doing this for Ridge?",
        "Jackie: Now of course, I do realize that running a chain of boutiques isn't going to be like running Forrester Creations.",
        "Nick: It could be. It could be anything you want. Hire your own designers, launch your own line. You could start this thing from the ground up.",
        "Jackie: You have complete freedom.",
        "Nick: Nobody breathing down your neck, nobody telling you what to do.",
        "Brooke: Sounds wonderful.",
        "Nick: It will be.",
        "Brooke: I just don't think I'm quite ready yet.",
        "Jackie: I understand. I mean, you helped build Forrester into one of the world's great fashion houses.",
        "Brooke: I think I invested too much of myself.",
        "Jackie: Well, your work was certainly noticed. You made your mark. Fashion is in your blood, Brooke. When you're ready to go back to work, you're going to be brilliant.",
        "Brooke: Thank you. Thank you so much for the offer.",
        "Jackie: The door is always open.",
        "[Brooke's cell phone rings]",
        "Brooke: Oh, gosh, it's probably Catherine. R.J.'s been having a hard time in his play group. Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Brooke. I hope I'm not getting you at a bad time.",
        "Brooke: No. What is it?",
        "Stephanie: The media has been asking me a lot of question about Ridge and his illness. And what I'd like to do is have a press conference and bring him out, let them see that he's fine. And I would really appreciate it if you would attend.",
        "Brooke: I don't think that's a very good idea.",
        "Stephanie: I understand you've left the company, but I --",
        "Eric: Brooke, Brooke, it's Eric. Now, listen, listen. The press is having a field day with this. They're trying to make it look as if Ridge is finished here.",
        "Brooke: What? That's outrageous!",
        "Eric: Yes, yes. I know it is. It would mean a lot to Ridge and to all of us if you would -- well, if you would show up and support him.",
        "Brooke: All right, fine. I'll be there.",
        "Eric: Wonderful. Thank you. She's coming.",
        "Stephanie: Oh! Thank you!",
        "Eric: Don't thank me. This is all you.",
        "Stephanie: I don't know if this is going to work or not. I'm hoping that when she walks back here into the building, Brooke is going to understand that this where she belongs.",
        "Eric: And we'll all live happily ever after?",
        "Stephanie: From your lips to God's ears.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Stephanie is holding a press conference.",
        "Nick: A press conference? That's what you just agreed to go to?",
        "Jackie: No, this is a trap. I don't like it.",
        "Nick: Brooke, no. I do not trust those people.",
        "Brooke: It's okay, really. If she's up to something, I want to know what it is. Don't worry. I can handle her. Stephanie Forrester's not going to get the best of me. I can promise you that."
