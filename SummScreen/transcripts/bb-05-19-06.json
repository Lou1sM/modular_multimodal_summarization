        "Stephanie: I see Jarrett's here a little early.",
        "Sally: I think he may be sensing there's something more afoot.",
        "Stephanie: You didn't tell him anything, did you?",
        "Sally: What, about your plan to anoint Brooke Logan as chief executive officer of Forrester Creations before the entire world? Never. You can relax, highness. Nothing is going to spoil this for you.",
        "Stephanie: Thanks, Sally.",
        "Felicia: Don't be too sure.",
        "Stephanie: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Felicia: Don't \"sweetheart\" me, Mom. I know what you did. Threatening Dante to deport him if he doesn't sign away his rights as Dominick's father.",
        "Stephanie: Sweetheart, that's the least of my worries. I was only doing that to protect you.",
        "Felicia: I know and I thank you. But stop. Dante and I have had a chance to talk and we're going to figure out together what's best for our son, okay?",
        "Stephanie: Fine. Excuse me.",
        "Felicia: Okay, Sally. What do you know that I don't know?",
        "Sally: Moi?",
        "Felicia: This press conference is about more than Ridge's health, isn't it? Something about Brooke, maybe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So that's why Stephanie wants me there today, to support Ridge. She wants to reassure the press that Forrester Creations isn't going to lose its top designer.",
        "Jackie: Yeah, well, I can't help wondering if this isn't more about Stephanie's desire to woo you back into the family.",
        "Brooke: Don't worry, that's not going to happen. My life is with nick. My future is with Nick. Even though it will be hard to walk in there, knowing that it's probably going to be the last time I'm in there. But hey, what better time than to announce my resignation at the press conference?",
        "Nick: Listen, I have a conference call with the Marone board. So if you want me to try to cancel that --",
        "Brooke: No, I'll be fine.",
        "Nick: Mother, we're going.",
        "Jackie: Oh, yeah, yeah, okay. Hi, it's me. I need to see you right away, and I'm at the boutique. Can you come by? Good, I'll be waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: A press conference? Mother's idea, right?",
        "Eric: Yes. But she has your best interests at heart.",
        "Ridge: Oh, yeah.",
        "Eric: And the company's too.",
        "Ridge: Right. Which is why she relegated you and me to the basement? Marginalized all of our efforts. Now that Brooke's gone -- well, dad, we've got to face it. Forrester Creations is just a shadow of its former self when Brooke and I were running the place.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well. Maybe Stephanie is about to fix that.",
        "Ridge: Ow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: No, I like it. I think we need to change, as long as it balances. It's good. [Taylor knocks] Hi. Let me get back to you.",
        "Taylor: Shelley said your conference call was delayed, to just come on in.",
        "Nick: Come in, then. So I guess you're here to pick my brain about the proposal I sent you.",
        "Taylor: Yeah. I read the idea and I really like it. And like you said, your employees are gone away from home for extended periods of time, and it causes a lot stress, not only for them, but for their families. And I really do think they could benefit from, you know, having professional counseling and discuss all those issues. So I'll give it serious consideration to help you get it off the ground.",
        "Nick: Excellent. Sit down. So while you're here, what do you say that I pick your brain for a little free advice?",
        "[Impersonating Sigmund Freud]",
        "Taylor: Vat seems to be ze problem?",
        "Nick: Well, it's Stephanie's fixation with Brooke. All of a sudden, she needs her after years of hoping she'd fall off a building. What's that all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: I'm glad that you called.",
        "Jackie: You don't think that I'm overreacting, then?",
        "Stephen: I think your instincts are dead on.",
        "Jackie: When it comes to Stephanie, believe me, I've had a lot of practice.",
        "Stephen: You said she specifically requested my daughter be present at the press conference?",
        "Jackie: She did, and I don't like that at all.",
        "Stephen: Neither do I.",
        "Jackie: You're thinking we should be at that press conference, aren't you? Even though we are the two people most likely not to be welcome?",
        "Stephen: Don't worry. I have ways of making sure that's not a problem. Get your keys.",
        "Jackie: Okay. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Christian: Your father thought it'd be a good idea if I tagged along today, be there in case, you know --",
        "Ridge: In case my ticker went \"kablooey\" again?",
        "Christian: Dr. Plotnikov wouldn't release you if he thought there was any chance of that. But you have had major surgery. You don't need to push yourself. Speaking of which, I'll go get a wheelchair and we can be on our way.",
        "Eric: Thank you. So you're okay with this press conference?",
        "Ridge: Do I have a choice?",
        "Eric: Well, what if I told you that Brooke was going to be there?",
        "Ridge: Brooke resigned from Forrester. Why would she want to come back?",
        "Eric: Trust me, Ridge. The feud between your mother and Brooke is finally over today. What's going to come of it, it's a little too soon to tell. But this family today needs to come together in a way that it never has before. And I think it will. In a way that'll make us all proud. And Brooke, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Brooke remembering]",
        "Ridge: How did you come up with this?",
        "Brooke: Believe it or not, it was something you said that put me onto it.",
        "Ridge: Oh yeah? What was that?",
        "Brooke: That great things can happen when you and I work together.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Stephanie: You love this",
        "Stephanie: You love this place, don't you?",
        "Brooke: Oh! Stephanie! How long have you been there?",
        "Stephanie: Long enough to see that this is a difficult day for you.",
        "Brooke: I've been here many, many years. I have a lot of good memories.",
        "Stephanie: Yes. Wonderful memories.",
        "Brooke: Good memories that you didn't manage to ruin. But then of course, you took over the company, and you squashed everything.",
        "Stephanie: Perhaps I overreacted.",
        "Brooke: You reacted the way you always reacted when it came to me. Look, I know I told I was going to be here to support Ridge. But I'm not really sure I can do that. It's just too painful.",
        "Stephanie: Because of me.",
        "Brooke: All I ever wanted your respect. And all I ever got was -- I have to go!",
        "Stephanie: No. Listen for a minute, please. Please stay. If you do, I promise you, you'll really be happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: What is going on here?",
        "Jackie: Well, we're about to find out.",
        "Thorne: Here's the envelope.",
        "Stephanie: Thanks.",
        "Thorne: Is something wrong?",
        "Stephanie: Well, Brooke was here a few minutes ago. But she's gone. I don't know --",
        "Thorne: Well, I'm sure she's here somewhere.",
        "Stephanie: Well, maybe I better go get her. I've got to talk to her before --",
        "Thorne: No. No, no, no. There's no time. We have to start now, with or without Brooke.",
        "Director: Quiet, please. We have speed. And we are live in 5 -- 4-- 3-- 2--",
        "Stephanie: Welcome, everyone. Thank you so much for coming today. First things first. A few of you -- well, I guess most of you have been asking questions about my son Ridge's recent illness. And let me just tell you, he's fine. The doctors have given him a clean bill of health. Naturally, the family is very thankful for that. And next -- despite the upheaval -- upheavals of recent months, I believe that Forrester Creations has turned a corner. And I think we have a very bright future. I think you will agree with me after I tell you the direction I want to take the company in. And the person who's going to head it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: I don't know what Stephanie's thinking. But clearly, whatever this change of heart is, it has to do with ridge nearly dying.",
        "Nick: Doesn't mean it's real. Definitely doesn't mean it's going to last.",
        "Taylor: True. But -- it's definitely better than the way it's been the last few years.",
        "Nick: That's not Brooke's fault.",
        "Taylor: Not that you're exactly objective.",
        "Nick: And I know you've had your differences with Brooke. I understand all of that.",
        "Taylor: But believe me when I tell you that nobody knows Brooke's vulnerabilities better than Stephanie.",
        "Nick: Well, Stephanie can know or think she knows anything she wants. That woman cannot say or do anything to change the way Brooke feels about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jarrett: Another new direction for Forrester?",
        "Stephanie: Well, I think you're going to be very pleasantly surprised.",
        "Eric: Forrester creations has never rested on its laurels. We're constantly looking for innovation and new paths to creativity. And no one more than this gentleman, right here.",
        "Stephanie: How're you feeling?",
        "Ridge: Ask me after I've been grilled by these characters.",
        "Jarrett: So what do the doctors say, Ridge?",
        "Reporter: Are you really out of the woods?",
        "Eric: As you can see, my son is well on his way to recovery.",
        "Danica: How soon will you return to work?",
        "Jarrett: And when you do return, what about Brooke Logan? Rumor has it she's no longer at Forrester.",
        "Sophie: Can you confirm that, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Unfortunately, Brooke cleaned out her desk shortly before I was hospitalized. To say that's a major disappointment to the company and to me personally would be a huge understatement.",
        "Jarret: Then it's official?",
        "[Both rRidge and Stephanie reply]",
        "Ridge: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: No. At least, I hope it isn't. I told you there were two reasons we were here today. One, to let you all see ridge and let you know that he is going to be absolutely fine. And the second is to thank Brooke Logan for her contribution to Forrester all these years. Brooke, would you come up on stage, please? Brooke, come up, please. We want to thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, Brooke Logan Forrester.",
        "[Audience applauds]",
        "Stephanie: Now I have another surprise for you -- something I'd like you all to view. I had publicity put this together. I think you're going to be very pleasantly surprised.",
        "[Camera shutters]",
        "Stephanie: Cut from a different cloth, Brooke Logan Forrester has always written her own rules of fashion. Without her, Forrester Creations would not be what it is today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: You know, there's always been this complex love-hate relationship between Stephanie and Brooke.",
        "Nick: Well, Brooke's finished with that. She's finished with Stephanie. And she's finished with Forrester Creations.",
        "Taylor: You're talking about Brooke leaving the company?",
        "Nick: Exactly. She's making a resignation speech right now. Press conference over at Forrester.",
        "[Phone rings] Nick: Yeah?",
        "Jackie: Nicky, it's me. I'm at the press conference. And I know that you're confident Brooke can take care of herself, but Stephanie is definitely up to something.",
        "Nick: Up to what?",
        "Jackie: Turn on Channel 31, the L.A. Fashion channel. And I think you're going to see why I am so concerned. And you should be too, honey.",
        "Stephanie: Brooke shocked the fashion world when she unveiled \"Brooke's bedroom,\" Forrester's controversial lingerie line. It would later become the most profitable and successful line in the company's history. Not only a trendsetter in business, but a pioneer in science, as well. It was her discovery of \"belief,\" a wrinkle-free fabric spray that revolutionized the fashion landscape.",
        "Eric: As far as I'm concerned, from this moment forward, she's the most important woman in our industry.",
        "Stephanie: When Brooke later took over the reins as chief executive officer, the company saw itself flourish. Her bold vision included the creation of the Forrester men's line and many international triumphs. Brooke's quintessential moment -- the Portofino challenge, in Italy -- where, like an angel, she sailed across the bay in a Forrester gown, dazzling the crowd. Through the years, it's been Brooke's ingenuity, passion and flair for fashion that has made the house of Forrester Creations what it is today. And for that, we proudly honor Brooke Logan Forrester.",
        "[Audience applauds]",
        "Stephanie: We admire and respect your talent and your passion for this industry. I have not acknowledged that publicly, so it's high time that I do. As of today, \"Brooke's bedroom\" and the men's line is back in production. Eric and I started this business quite a while ago. He had just finished college, I had a baby on the hip. And we were a success -- a big success. But the most significant success and the biggest profit margins came when we had a particular team running the show. It's a team that I want to see reinstated. Brooke and Ridge. You two are the future of Forrester Creations. No doubt about it in my mind. That's why today, I'm stepping aside as CEO and I'm offering you the position. Well, you can see that she didn't know this was coming. This company needs you more than ever. The family wants you here and I want you here. I hold 100% of the stock in Forrester Creations. And I'm going to give you, Brooke, 50% of it. Ridge needs you. The company needs you. It's yours to run, as you should have all these years. It's yours. Lock, stock and CEO on top. It's your legacy for the children. For all the grandchildren.",
        "Brooke: Is this real?",
        "Stephanie: Mm-hm.",
        "Brooke: Are you serious?",
        "Stephanie: I've never been more serious in my life. Forrester Creations is yours to run. Yours and Ridge's. Welcome to the family, Brooke.",
