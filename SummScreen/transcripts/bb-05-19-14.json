{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Bill tells Brooke that he had tonight planned, with champagne, candlelight and music, the whole bit but then she came in looking so beautiful .Brooke says and he's been so loyal and committed to her that the least she could do is say yes. She can't wait to see what he plans next. But they don't have to go on an extravagant trip; they could stay right here as long as they are together. He quips that when Bill Spencer says he is going to give her the world, he means it. Liam pounds on the door of the steam room and hollers for someone to let him out of there; he can't breathe. Quinn is nearby pretending not to notice. Donna passes out the balance sheets to Rick, Hope, Wyatt, Caroline and Maya at the meeting. Ridge rushes in and comments on another meeting. When he hears Eric is on a international phone call, he tells Rick he should be there too and he can handle this. Rick says actually no, he's learned the hard way not to turn his back on Ridge. Brooke had someplace else to be and Quinn is missing. Liam keeps pounding, getting hotter and hotter so finally Quinn removes the iron bar blocking the door and Liam flies out, all coughing and panting. He spots Quinn and knows it is her that locked him in. She says guilty. And he says she turned the temperature up. Guilty again. He tells her that she is insane. She says yeah and he had ground rules and getting naked in the steam room broke them. He realizes she also intercepted the text message to Hope. Quinn says she could not let him sabotage Hope and Wyatt's relationship. She calls him a little wuss and says he may have guilted Hope into dating both of them but she will end up with Wyatt. Liam shouts like hell she will. There is no woman on this planet that would accept her as a mother- in-law or her user of a son. He huffs and puffs and issues her a warning that next time he will press charges. He doesn't know if this is fun ad games to her or something more sinister but if she thinks she is going to intimidate him into walking always from the woman he loves, then she is wrong!", "Bill wants to have some champagne but Brooke has to decline. She says she is late for a meeting as they speak. And this way she will be able to tell everyone, including Ridge, about them being engaged. She knows after all Ridge has said to Bill that he would like to be the one to tell Ridge. Bill says damn right but in the spirit of peace and harmony between their almost families he will let her deliver the news. She says she had to say yes as there is no one that she trusts like him. Ridge makes a quick exit from the meeting and says he will be back. Wyatt is about to cover for Quinn when she comes in and apologizes for her tardiness. She says she had to attend to another matter that is taken care of but now she is raring to go. Liam flies through Bill's door and accuses his ex of being certifiable. He's talking loony-tunes crazy. She locked him in the FC steam room and turned up the heat. Bill is stunned; Katie locked him in the steam room. Liam says no; it was Quinn. Bill tells him to calm down and tell him what happened. Suddenly Liam says no; he is not going to let that psychopath inside his head. He has put her on notice of what will happen if she tries to pull that stunt again. So should Bill. He should make her hand over that selfie. Bill says he knows this is not funny but he's not going to let that nut job ruin his day. He's not going to let her inside his head. He tells Liam that he proposed to Brooke and she accepted. Liam gives Bill a big congratulatory hug. Brooke arrives at the meeting and it doesn't take long for Donna to realize she is flushed with excitement and she spots the ring. All congratulate her except Quinn. Wyatt has to goad her into saying something. She says usually you congratulate the groom and offer the bride best wishes, but since Brooke is not a bride yet she will just hope she will be happy and that her wedding will be picture perfect. Brooke tells Hope that Bill has been so wonderful and loyal, she can't imagine anything coming between them. Liam tells Bill finally some good news. He knows how much Bill loves Brooke so he's happy for them. Bill says it has been a long time coming but now nothing is standing in their way. Liam says especially Quinn and that infamous selfie. Bill says he made Wyatt a Spencer which he was going to do anyway. Quinn may be a lot off the beam but she knows better than to push Bill, but if she gets some squirrelly notion in her head then he will handle it. And this means that he and Forrester will be more involved in each other's lives. That doesn't thrill him but there are some things more important, RJ and Will not to mention Katie and Brooke. And if Mr. Sensitive is as supportive as he claims to be then he will deal with this too. Ridge comes back to the office and finds only Brooke. He asks if he missed much at the meeting and she says she just got there too. He accuses her of hearing from Spencer and rushing off again. He notices her ring. She says yes, Bill proposed and she accepted. Wyatt kisses Hope and they discuss their parents getting married. But he can't help but be worried abut his mom. It's the love/hate thing but she has said Bill is the only one she ever really cared for. He knows she was starting to feel that way again. Bill barks an order over the phone that he wants it by noon tomorrow. Quinn slips in. Bill tells her that he's already heard about Liam's extended steam room experience. She says she didn't come here for that. She says she did hear about his engagement to Brooke and thought she'd bring him an early wedding gift. She slips off her trench coat for a little something beneath. He says she has lost her mind. Ridge tells Brooke that she has lost her mind. She is making the biggest mistake of her life. She counters back that this is not a mistake. He must have known it would happen sooner or later. Ridge says Bill is not the right man for her; she deserves someone better. Brooke says again he's only been true and loyal and Ridge is now engaged to her sister. He thinks that is what this is about; her being upset over that. She says Bill is a wonderful person. He'll make a great husband and stepdad. Ridge says this has gone too far. He grabs her finger and takes off the ring and says she is not going to marry Bill Spencer."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: So, you know, I had this all planned for tonight -- champagne, candlelight, music -- the whole bit -- but then I-I saw you walk in here, looking all... [Purrs playfully]", "Brooke: [Chuckling] And then you just couldn't resist, could you?", "Bill: Oh, no. I said, \"If I don't propose to this woman right now, and if she doesn't say yes...\"", "Brooke: Was there ever any doubt?", "Bill: That you love me? No. That you would willingly say that you would commit the rest of your life to me?", "Brooke: I just did. You have remained so loyal and so committed that the least I could do was commit myself to you for the rest of our lives.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Hello?! Hey! Hey! Please, somebody get me out of here! Get me out of here! Now! No! No! Get me out! God, I-I can't breathe!

Great.", "Rick: Yes, actually, we've got some crucial decisions to make.", "Maya: Where's Eric?", "Donna: Oh, he's, uh, a conference call with international.", "Ridge: You should be in on that. I'll take care of this.", "Rick: Huh? No. No, thanks. Actually, uh, as far as you're concerned, I've had to learn the hard way -- never turn my back to you.", "Caroline: Okay, boys. Play nice.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: We have to get through this agenda ASAP.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Yeah, plus my mom and I have a few ideas we want to run by everyone, if she ever gets here.", "Rick: Any idea what's holding Quinn up?", "Wyatt: I'm gonna -- yeah, I'm gonna text her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: You know, we're still waiting on Brooke, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Uh, actually, nope, she got a call. She had to leave.", "Ridge: It's not R.J., Is it?", "Hope: No. No, it's not R.J.", "Ridge: So, what does Spencer want now?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Help! [Groaning] I...can't...breathe!

You're gonna lock me in a steam room where I could die?!", "Quinn: Oh, please. Listen to me, you little wuss. You may have been able to guilt hope into dating both you and Wyatt, but she will end up with him.", "Liam: Oh, like hell she will, Quinn. Like hell she will, because there isn't a woman on the planet who would take a mother-in-law like you or a user like your son.", "Quinn: Don't you dare talk about my son.", "Liam: Or what?! What are you gonna do, exactly, Quinn? What are you gonna do? Cause let me issue a warning to you. You pull another stunt like this, and I am pressing charges. I am not kidding. I don't know if this is fun and games for you, or if it's something more sinister than that, but if you think you are going to intimidate me into walking away from the woman I love, you are wrong, Quinn! You are wrong!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: All right, we should start. I'll fill mom in on anything she misses.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Assuming Spencer lets her come.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: Okay, well, I hardly think that my uncle is keeping Brooke hostage.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: Should we reschedule?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: We could take a break.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Donna: You know, you're really sweet to worry about Brooke, but I'm sure she's okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: She knows what she's doing.", "Ridge: When did you start singing his praises?", "Hope: Well, he did make Wyatt a Spencer, so...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Hey, we're all happy for Wyatt. And as far as mom's concerned, I'm, uh -- I'm sure that Ridge's co-vice president's in really good hands right now. But anyway, we need to start focusing on business, so shall we?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: [Sighs] You are just full of surprises, Mr. Spencer.", "Bill: Yeah.", "Brooke: One minute, you're talking about whisking me away on a romantic trip to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and the next, you're proposing. Makes a girl wonder what's gonna happen next.", "Bill: Your fianc\u00e9 doesn't fool around. When Bill Spencer says he's gonna give you the world...", "Brooke: I can hardly wait. But you know what?", "Bill: Hmm?", "Brooke: I mean, as amazing as it all sounds, we don't really need to go on this extravagant trip. We could stay here... as long as we're together.", "Brooke: Mm. [Chuckles] Mm.", "Bill: Hey, don't you move a muscle, okay? I'm gonna order some champagne to toast my beautiful bride.", "Brooke: Oh.", "Bill: What?", "Brooke: Uh, I have a meeting at Forrester, and I'm already kind of late.", "Bill: Blow it off.", "Brooke: That would be setting a bad example as Forrester's new co-VP. Besides, I got to go in there and show them who's boss. And then I could also tell everybody that you proposed and that we're engaged.", "Bill: Including Ridge?", "Brooke: I don't want him to hear it from somebody else.", "Bill: That somebody being me?", "Brooke: I know that you're tempted, especially after everything that he's said to you.", "Bill: Yeah, you're damn right. But in the spirit of peace and harmony between our soon-to-be new families, I will let you deliver the news.", "Brooke: Thank you.", "Bill: Thank you for saying yes. You know, a man is at his most vulnerable when he's proposing.", "Brooke: How could you ever doubt that I would say yes? I have never trusted anybody the way I trust you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Believe that we're all in agreement, unless, Ridge...", "[Cell phone beeps]", "Rick: ...You have something to add?", "Ridge: I'm sorry.", "Rick: You're leaving?", "Ridge: Yeah, I'll be right back.", "Rick: Well, moving right along. Wyatt, you're up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Uh, wow, uh, I thought my mom would have been here by now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Ohh! Oh, she is. She is. Forgive my tardiness.", "Caroline: Well, only if you have a good excuse.", "Quinn: Oh, well, I got distracted with another matter, but it is all taken care of now, and I'm raring to go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: That ex of yours is certifiable.", "Bill: Well, hello to you, too.", "Liam: I'm talking loony-tunes crazy, dad. Do you know what she did? You know what she did? She locked me in the Forrester steam room. She cranked the heat all the way up. I mean, a few more minutes --", "Bill: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you talking about? Katie locked you in a steam room?", "Liam: Katie -- what? Katie? No. Dad, I'm talking about Quinn. Oh, my God.", "Bill: Okay, Liam, calm down. Just tell me exactly what the hell happened. What?", "Liam: No. No.", "Bill: What do you mean, \"no\"?", "Liam: No. No. I'm not gonna let that psychopath inside my head. I put her on notice. I told her what's gonna happen if she tries a stunt like this again, and, by the way, you should, too. You tell her to hand over that selfie, or else.", "Bill: Well, you really don't like the woman, do you?", "Liam: Is this funny to you?", "Bill: No. But I am not gonna let that nut job ruin this day for me. All right? This is a very special day. I'm not gonna let her get inside my head.", "Liam: This special day we're talking about -- this doesn't have anything to do with that conversation you and I had yesterday?", "Bill: Uh, it has everything to do with that conversation. I told Brooke about the trip. She loved it, and she loved me for planning it. So I just couldn't leave it at that.", "Liam: Why? What did you do?", "Bill: I proposed. I asked her to marry me.", "Liam: [Chuckling] What?", "Bill: Yeah.", "Liam: And?", "Bill: And we're engaged.", "Liam: [Laughs] Oh, my God. Hey!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: The deposition went well. I feel confident it'll be dismissed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Oh, I know I'm late. Have I missed much?", "Rick: No. No. Just most of the meeting.", "Brooke: [Chuckles] Sorry. I got held up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: You okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.", "Caroline: Okay, 'cause you look a little flushed.", "Brooke: I do?", "Caroline: Yeah.", "Maya: Can I get you some water?", "Brooke: No. I just need to catch my breath for a second.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Uh, well, while you do, maybe Wyatt and I can start our presentation.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Actually, I think we should fill Brooke in on everything we've talked about, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Donna: Sis, are you sure you're okay?", "Brooke: Yeah. Why does everybody keep asking me that?", "Caroline: Maybe because something's different about you.", "Brooke: [Chuckles] Different how?", "Donna: Oh, my God.", "Hope: What?", "Donna: Oh, my God. Is that what I think it is? That -- you're -- you're --", "Brooke: Engaged to Bill.", "Donna: [Gasps]", "Brooke: Yes, I am.", "Donna: What? You're engaged?", "Hope: Oh, my God.", "Rick: When did this happen?", "Brooke: Oh, honey, it just happened.", "Donna: Do you s-- look at that.", "Hope: Yeah!", "Caroline: Congratulations. Amazing.", "Rick: Congratulations, Mom.", "Brooke: Thank you. [Clears throat]", "Hope: Is this why Bill wanted to see you?", "Brooke: Yes and no. He started out by telling me about this grand adventure that we're gonna have together, and then somewhere along the line, it just turned into a proposal.", "Caroline: Ooh. Molto romantico.", "Brooke: [Chuckling] Yes. Not to mention a complete surprise.", "Rick: So you didn't know anything about this?", "Brooke: No, nothing.", "Wyatt: That's my old man. Bill Spencer lives to surprise.", "Brooke: Mm-hmm.", "Donna: Is this the same ring that he...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Yes, this is the same.", "Maya: It's beautiful.", "Brooke: Thank you. [Chuckles]", "Maya: Wow.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Mom?", "Quinn: Hmm?", "Wyatt: You gonna congratulate Brooke?", "Quinn: No.", "Wyatt: Huh.", "Quinn: Well, usually, you would congratulate the groom and, uh, give the bride your best wishes, but since Brooke is not officially a bride yet, I-I hope that you'll be happy and that your wedding will be... picture perfect.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: Well, this calls for champagne.", "Donna: Yes, I will go get the bubbly in the kitchen. I'll be right back.", "Caroline: Well, we'll get the glasses. They're in the cabinet.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Wow.", "Brooke: Yeah.", "Hope: Okay. Are you happy? I mean -- I mean, is this what you want?", "Brooke: Of course. Bill has been wonderful, and he's so loyal. I can't imagine anything coming between us.", "Hope: Okay. Congratulations. [Chuckles]", "Brooke: Thank you. Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Finally, some good news today. I'm really happy for you. I know how much you love Brooke.", "Bill: Ah, it's been such a long time coming. And now there is nothing standing in our way.", "Liam: Yeah, especially not Quinn and the infamous selfie.", "Bill: I made Wyatt a Spencer, which I was gonna do anyway. All right, listen. We both know that Quinn's a little off the beam.", "Liam: Oh, a little? Really?", "Bill: Okay, a lot off the beam. But she's also smart enough to know not to push me on this. And if she does get some squirrelly notion going on in her head, I will handle it.", "Liam: Good. Good. So, what about Ridge?", "Bill: What about him?", "Liam: Well, didn't he tell Brooke to ditch you?", "Bill: Mm-hmm. Uh, but she's at Forrester now telling him that she's going to be my wife.", "Liam: I mean, dad, you got to know --", "Bill: I know. I know what you're gonna say. This means that -- that Forrester and I -- we're gonna be more involved in each other's life, which, uh, doesn't thrill me, but there's something more important to consider here -- R.J. And will, not to mention, uh, Katie and Brooke and everything they've been going through. Listen -- you know wt? If Forrester is really, uh, you know, the -- the Mr. Sensitive that he purports himself to be, then he's gonna deal with this and be happy for Brooke. If not...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Hi.", "Brooke: Hi.", "Ridge: Where is everyone?", "Brooke: Oh, the meeting just broke up. Where have you been?", "Ridge: I had to take care of something. What'd I miss?", "Brooke: Actually, I was late to the meeting, too, so...", "Ridge: Yeah. Spencer calls, and you go running, don't you?", "Brooke: He asked to see me... and I'm glad I did. So, here's the -- the notes from the meeting, and Donna can give you the rest.", "Ridge: What is this?", "Brooke: Bill asked me to marry him, and I accepted.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Wow. Big news, huh?", "Hope: Your dad proposing.", "Wyatt: Yeah. Your mom accepting.", "Hope: It's huge news.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] How do you feel about it?", "Hope: You mean, is your dad the person I'd choose for my mom?", "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, I know you've always had your differences.", "Hope: Yeah, but, um, there's no denying the way he treats her.", "Wyatt: It's kind of like how I treat you? No? Okay. Look, I just -- I'm worried about her, though.", "Hope: Hmm?", "Wyatt: My mom.", "Hope: Mm.", "Wyatt: She seemed to take the news okay, but she's always said dad was the only one she's ever really cared for.", "Hope: The love-hate thing?", "Wyatt: Yeah. I know she was starting to feel something for him again. But, I mean, I guess that's all over now. I don't know. Right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Well, no damn excuses. I want it done by noon tomorrow.", "[Door opens]", "Quinn: I slipped past your secretary.", "Bill: I heard about my son's extended steam.", "Quinn: Oh, I didn't come here to talk about that. I did hear about your engagement to Brooke, and I thought I'd bring you an early wedding present.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Is this some kind of sick joke?", "Brooke: Ridge.", "Ridge: What -- what happened? You lost your mind?", "Brooke: You had to know it was only a matter of time.", "Ridge: What was? That you're gonna make the biggest mistake of your life? I didn't know that.", "Brooke: This is not a mistake.", "Ridge: Well, not if you don't go through with it.", "Brooke: [Sighs] Bill asked me to marry him, and I intend to.", "Ridge: Bill is not the right man for you.", "Brooke: You keep saying that, and I keep telling you -- Bill has been nothing but true and loyal.", "Ridge: You deserve someone better than that.", "Brooke: You can't really tell me that. You're engaged to Katie.", "Ridge: And that -- that's what this is about? You upset because I'm marrying Katie?", "Brooke: So you think I accepted his proposal to get back at you?", "Ridge: No. No, I know. I'm -- I'm -- but you think you're doing the right thing? You think you're doing all the right things right now?", "Brooke: Yes, I am. Bill is a wonderful person. He's gonna be a great husband. He's gonna be a great stepdad.", "Ridge: Stop. This has gone far enough.", "Brooke: Ridge, what are you doing?", "Ridge: You're not gonna marry Bill Spencer."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1GqVrQvUtE"}
