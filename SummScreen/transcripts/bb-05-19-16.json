        "Zende is beyond words when Sasha tells him that she is pregnant. He wants to know how long has she known. She explains that just since last night when she took a pregnancy test and they are pretty accurate. She tried to tell him out by the pool but he had to run off to the office which they know now was to the hospital to be with Nicole. He keeps questioning her and she senses that he is almost saying she is lying .and she would not do that with something so important. He states they used protection every time and the condoms did not break, he checked. She says she knows this is a surprise but surely there must be some little part that he could be happy about, and not just thinking about Nicole. He stammers that he is not ready to be a father. He never said he loved her, just that they made love. They enjoyed each other but this was not something he wanted and she knew it. There was absolutely no commitment. She says she knows, this is not 1950 so she guesses he now is going to kick her to the curb the way he did Nicole. She tries to kiss him but he pulls away again. He wants to know if she has thought this through because a child is for the rest of their lives. She says they will get through this together. He says even though this is his room he needs to go and he does not want her to be there when he gets back. He promises they will talk later.",
        "Brooke slips into Katie's house and puts a note with her gown in the bedroom. Bill comes out all wet in a towel and scares her to death. She did not expect to see Bill here at this time of the day. She is simply there to try to help repair her relationship with her sister. He says probably not a good idea as he never knows what will set Katie off. Before they know it Katie comes in and Brooke has no place to go but hide under the bed. Katie proceeds to tell Bill they do not have to go to this charity function tonight. She peels off her clothes and shoes and drops them to the floor, right in front of Brooke's face she kisses Bill and proceeds to try to seduce him. Mindful that Brooke is so close by he tries to get out of her embraces, but she throws him to the bed and is still putting the moves on him. Brooke can't stand it any longer and she crawls out from under the bed. Katie is aghast. Rick and Maya discuss how they should be holding the baby. Viv speaks up and says there are only two key points \u0096 hold the baby by the head and do not drop the baby. Julius walks in with a bouquet of flowers. Viv cannot look at him. He goes directly to Nicole and says he heard she did good. He knows all of them do not care if grandfather is even alive but he had to come. When he hears it is a girl he beams that must be his destiny in life to furnish the world with female Avants. Without even looking at him Viv says he had nothing to do with this. Maya allows Julius to hold the baby. He coos that he may not have always been a good father but he will do this right. Later he tracks down Sasha back at Forrester while everyone else has gone home. He tells her if she has not heard, he is now a grandfather .it is a healthy, robust baby girl. He thinks Nicole will be okay with being more like a sister now that she knows the truth. And sisters often share things with their sisters but the loving ones always return what they borrowed. Zende returns to Nicole in the hospital and wants to know how she feels. She says good, this was a powerful experience for her. She loves him and she is glad he is there for her. His eyes dart about and he hardly knows what to say after what Sasha just told him."

        "Zende: You're pregnant?",
        "Sasha: [Laughs] I know! It's amazing how Nicole keeps coming through for me. You know, I was actually kind of afraid to tell you. But then once I heard how in awe you were at watching Nicole give birth, I just -- I figured --",
        "Zende: How long have you known?",
        "Sasha: Well, I just found out. I tried to tell you earlier --",
        "Zende: Sasha, how long have you known?",
        "Sasha: Just since last night. I -- I took a home pregnancy test.",
        "Zende: Wait, so this didn't come from a doctor?",
        "Sasha: Okay, well, no, not yet, but they say that those home pregnancy tests are very accurate. I tried to tell you earlier at the pool, but, you know, you said you had to run off to the office and...well, that I now know wasn't true.",
        "Zende: I'm sorry. No, it's not right. It's wrong to lie, even if you're trying to protect someone's feelings. Would you agree?",
        "Sasha: I understand.",
        "Zende: That it's wrong to lie?",
        "Sasha: Wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I know you think I'm holding her wrong.",
        "Vivienne: Did I say a word?",
        "Nicole: You better not be.",
        "Rick: I believe I can settle this.",
        "Maya: Oh.",
        "Vivienne: Oh. How to hold a baby?",
        "Nicole: Oh, okay.",
        "Vivienne: Do tell.",
        "Rick: Uh, well, first things first, wash your hands. Second of all, make sure there's no sharp objects on the upper body that will scratch the baby. What are they -- are they talking about, like, buttons?",
        "Maya: Well, I guess you're just gonna have to stay unbuttoned for the next two years.",
        "Nicole: What about rings and watches?",
        "Vivienne: Listen to your mother-in-law. Only two key points -- one, hold the baby's head up, two, don't drop the baby.",
        "Rick: I knew that. I was just looking that up for Maya.",
        "Vivienne: Okay. [Laughter] Ohh.",
        "Maya: Oh. Want to go to Daddy? Yeah?",
        "Rick: Aw. Can you say \"Daddy\"? Maybe tomorrow.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Julius: Somebody asking for Daddy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Oh! [Gasping] Oh, gosh, you scared me to death!",
        "Bill: You?! You're in my bedroom, Brooke!",
        "Brooke: You're a workaholic, remember? You're never home at this hour.",
        "Bill: I had to come home and get ready for this museum thing Katie wants to go to tonight.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, that's why I'm here to. I brought her this. It's a surprise. Now, just tell her that there's something for her in the closet.",
        "Bill: Not a good idea.",
        "Brooke: I'm just trying to repair my relationship with my sister.",
        "Bill: I never know what's gonna set her off.",
        "Brooke: I don't, either. But we just have to keep showing her that there's nothing to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: I, uh... brought you some flowers.",
        "Nicole: So I see.",
        "Maya: There's a vase over here.",
        "Julius: So, uh... I heard you did good.",
        "Nicole: Who did you hear that from?",
        "Julius: From the nurse out in the hall. Nobody in here. I...look, I understand I'm persona non grata, and nobody wants to know about Dad, even if I'm alive.",
        "Maya: I sent the text, okay? It's said, \"you're a grandfather,\" that's it.",
        "Julius: So, how you doing, baby girl?",
        "Nicole: Tired, but I'm good. I'm real good.",
        "Julius: What is it?",
        "Maya: She is not an \"it.\"",
        "Julius: Girl. [Chuckles] I guess it's my -- my destiny to fill the generation of Avants with females.",
        "Vivienne: You had nothing to do with it.",
        "Julius: How is she?",
        "Vivienne: She's beautiful.",
        "Maya: She's perfect.",
        "[Baby fussing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: You think I would lie to you about something like this?",
        "Zende: It's been known to happen.",
        "Sasha: Okay, this is not the 1950s, all right? A single girl can have a baby, and it's not the end of the world.",
        "Zende: Is that what you're gonna do?",
        "Sasha: I don't know. Zende, how can you ask me to think about something like that when I haven't even talked to you first?",
        "Zende: I'm not ready to be a father, Sasha.",
        "Sasha: Okay, after your trip to the hospital, you were just saying how making babies was such a beautiful thing. And now you're about to kick me to the curb, just like you did Nicole. [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Well, I... I'd better go.",
        "Bill: Brooke, you should have thought about coming in the first place. Next time, you have got to check with Katie beforehand.",
        "Brooke: What? Logans don't do that. Family can show up on the doorstep. Everybody else has to call. What, now you want me to treat my sister like a stranger?",
        "Bill: Brooke, don't. Come on. We -- we know how Katie feels, and that she's justified for feeling that way. We just know right from wrong.",
        "Katie: Bill, are you home?",
        "Bill: [Whispering] Like I said... I'm getting dressed!",
        "Brooke: I can't hide in here, the dress!",
        "Bill: Don't, don't, don't. Hiding is just gonna make it worse. Don't.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] Hey!",
        "Katie: Hey. That's what I call \"getting dressed.\"",
        "Bill: Getting. Right, I said I was getting dressed.",
        "Katie: Hmm, you smell good. [Laughs]",
        "Bill: Well, that's what a shower will do to -- to a guy.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but are you clean all over, or should I check?",
        "Bill: Careful, we -- we have this event to get to.",
        "Katie: It's a charity gala. So what if we miss a few speeches, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: What are you giving her?",
        "Maya: Food.",
        "Julius: Shouldn't your sister be doing that?",
        "Nicole: Butt out, Dad.",
        "Vivienne: You think they haven't discussed these things?",
        "Julius: Listen, if this is a polite way of asking me to leave, I need not be where I'm not wanted.",
        "Maya: You know what the trick is, Dad, to make yourself wanted, and you have always known how to do that.",
        "Vivienne: Yes, he does. You can make somebody love you, even though their inside is screaming \"run.\"",
        "Julius: I just wish you wouldn't run from me now, Viv. May I see her? My first and only grandchild. She make eight pounds?",
        "Maya: Eight pounds, two ounces.",
        "Julius: But healthy, right?",
        "Vivienne: Especially for a first child.",
        "Maya: Would you like to hold her? Well, I can't very much complain about you banishing me from the family, and then do the same thing to you.",
        "Julius: I never said you weren't a good person.",
        "Maya: Yeah, Dad, you did.",
        "Julius: Well, I don't remember meaning it.",
        "Rick: Case she spits up on you.",
        "Julius: Oh, no, she wouldn't. Never dare. No child has ever done that. But if there was gonna be one, it would be Maya's. [Laughs]",
        "Maya: You're right about that. [Laughs] Here. Aw.",
        "[Baby fussing]",
        "Julius: Hmm, come here, little precious. I may have done a lot of wrong things as a dad, but this grandfather thing... oh, I promise you... your papa got you.",
        "[Baby fussing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: This is not something we ever decided.",
        "Sasha: Okay, well, neither is being tall or from the Midwest, but --",
        "Zende: Okay, come on. You know what I'm saying. We did not have that kind of a relationship.",
        "Sasha: We had the kind of relationship where this was a possibility.",
        "Zende: We were enjoying each other, but there was no commitment. That's not something I wanted, and you knew it.",
        "Sasha: You said you loved me.",
        "Zende: Never. Look... I said we made love... because I don't like using the other term.",
        "Sasha: But we also made a baby. Babies don't ask if you're ready.",
        "Zende: What are we gonna do? Have you given this any thought?",
        "Sasha: Honestly, the only thing I've thought about is that we'll get through this. We will get through this together somehow.",
        "Zende: For the rest of our lives? Because you know that's what a child is, right? A lifetime.",
        "Sasha: I'm not asking you for anything.",
        "Zende: I am asking you for an explanation because we used protection every time. How could this even happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: You know, one of the many, many things that I love about you is that you like to walk around with nothing on.",
        "Bill: I take it your session went well?",
        "Katie: It went very well. But that has nothing to do with how attracted I am to my husband.",
        "Bill: Mm. You know what? Um... why don't you go say goodnight to Will and let Teresa know that we're leaving?",
        "Katie: I changed my mind. I don't want to go. I mean, we have given that museum so much money, and things have been strained between the two of us. Wouldn't you agree that a couple's love life is a measure of the health of their marriage?",
        "Bill: One measure.",
        "Katie: You look flush. Think you have a fever. I think we should stay home... work on our health.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Where they going with my grandbaby?",
        "Nicole: Wow. Look who's suddenly so possessive.",
        "Rick: All right, I -- I really want to hug all of you, but I can't touch anything.",
        "Nicole: [Laughs] You're giving her a bath, Rick. It's not surgery.",
        "Rick: Yeah, it's her first bath. It has to be flawless.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Maya: I want to go down to the nursery and wait for showtime -- I mean bath time.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Maya: Does anyone need anything?",
        "Vivienne: I want to go and watch.",
        "Julius: I think I'm making progress. What do you think?",
        "Nicole: With Mom or with me? It's tough to think of someone who's not mad at you right now.",
        "Julius: Listen. The one thing you've got to remember, is you've got to have faith that life can repair itself. I mean, look at you. I mean, you've just gone through a terrible ordeal --",
        "Nicole: I never said it was terrible.",
        "Julius: But you've got your life back, if not your innocence.",
        "Nicole: I did the right thing, Daddy.",
        "Julius: Yeah. We all like to think that we did.",
        "Nicole: I think that I'll be getting everything back. Even Zende. He was here. And after seeing the baby... seeing what it meant to Rick and Maya, he understands. I'm not sure, but... things look hopeful for us.",
        "Julius: Baby girl, that is music to your daddy's ears. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: I'm really trying to think of this as a blessing, but honestly, you're not helping.",
        "Zende: Sasha, a condom never broke. Not once. I know because I checked every time.",
        "Sasha: Okay, well, nothing is 100% guaranteed, obviously. Especially when it's dark and you're not in complete control of yourself.",
        "Zende: This cannot be happening.",
        "Sasha: Do you think this is easy for me? Isn't there a single, little part of you that's happy?",
        "Zende: Oh, I have feelings. But you don't want me to name them all.",
        "Sasha: This is about Nicole, isn't it? It is always about Nicole. Even me being pregnant, I'm sure is somehow about Nicole.",
        "Zende: Nicole has done a lot for you.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, I know.",
        "Zende: She let you down once, and then she fixed it. Can you say the same?",
        "Sasha: Look, maybe this is enough talk, all right? I had information to give and I gave it. I think it's just best if we don't say anything else that we're gonna regret. I just want to feel close to you.",
        "Zende: I need to go.",
        "Sasha: Where? This is your room.",
        "Zende: We'll talk later. I promise. [Sighs] Just please...don't be here when I get back.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Both sigh]",
        "Katie: You know, if you want to go to some boring gala and eat boring hors d'oeuvres and see boring exhibits, fine, you go ahead. I'm -- I'm gonna stay here.",
        "Bill: What's wrong?",
        "Katie: Do you smell alcohol on my breath, even when it's not there? Is that what the problem is?",
        "Bill: No. I'm just trying to follow marching orders, right? You said be ready by 7:00 sharp. It's after 7:00.",
        "Katie: Well, I just thought that we could go out and look dazzling together. But since there's nothing I can do or wear to make my husband attracted to me...",
        "Bill: Are you crazy? [Scoffs] Katie, I -- I think you're the hottest woman in the northern hemisphere.",
        "Katie: Prove it.",
        "Bill: All right, look, um... there is something wrong, but it's not in any way what you think it is.",
        "Katie: Well, then I don't need to hear about it.",
        "Bill: You do.",
        "Katie: No. I don't. All I need is to feel your arms around me...and this.",
        "Bill: Mm. Katie? [Sighs]",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: All right, Katie. No. No, no, Katie?",
        "Katie: [Laughing]",
        "Brooke: Wait! Wait!",
        "Katie: [Screams]",
        "Brooke: Wait, stop, please!",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brooke: Please!",
        "Katie: What the...?! [Gasping]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julian: Hey. I'm sorry. The bus was late.",
        "Sasha: What am I even doing here? I mean, everyone else has gone home.",
        "Julius: I wanted someplace that we could talk that was quiet, and I don't exactly have my own place anymore. Um, let's have a seat. I don't know if you've heard, but I'm a grandfather.",
        "Sasha: Yeah. Yeah, Zende told me.",
        "Julius: Hmm.",
        "Sasha: How's the baby?",
        "Julius: Oh, beautiful.",
        "Sasha: Healthy?",
        "Julius: Robust. [Laughs]",
        "Sasha: What did they name her?",
        "Julius: That's a good question. They didn't tell me.",
        "Sasha: You mean, they just didn't want to hear you complain about the name that they picked? [Laughs]",
        "Sasha: And Nic's good, too?",
        "Julius: She's great.",
        "Sasha: I'm glad.",
        "Julius: Are you really? Would you say that, uh... that Nicole has started to act more like a sister now that she knows that you share the same blood?",
        "Sasha: Yeah.",
        "Julius: So you're prepared to act like a sister? You know, sisters often borrow things from one another. But the loving ones always give back that which they've borrowed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I'm getting better at this dreaming thing.",
        "Zende: How you feeling?",
        "Nicole: Wonderful.",
        "Zende: You don't hurt?",
        "Nicole: More like... that feeling when something that hurt you before doesn't hurt you anymore.",
        "Zende: I was so wrong, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: Don't.",
        "Zende: Scoot over. What you gave up, you gave up for something amazing. A whole new life, a whole new family. What I gave up, I gave up for nothing. No good reason for this idea of what I thought life was supposed to be.",
        "Nicole: I don't know if... there is any right or wrong... just a right and a wrong for two different people. But anything that ends with me opening my eyes and seeing you here is good enough for me.",
        "Zende: Why don't you hate me?",
        "Nicole: Because I love you. I made my own choices. Things happen the way they had to, I guess.",
        "Zende: Why couldn't I see what I see now?",
        "Nicole: This whole experience...having a baby... is so powerful...that it -- it just changes the way you view life. What, Zende? Whatever you're thinking, it can't be that bad."
