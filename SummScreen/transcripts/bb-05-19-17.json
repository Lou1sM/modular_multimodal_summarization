All Bill can say is WOW. Ridge is expecting Brooke but Quinn shows up at his door. She says Brooke is with Bill getting married. Ridge argues that she cannot do that; there is still time for them. He will let RJ down. He wanted to put his family back together. But he's the idiot for playing these blame games. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with Brooke and now he ruined it. He laments that he is an insecure man who wants every woman to love him and now he screwed up with another failed relationship. Brooke heard him but she did not understand him. Quinn says she does. She reminds him they both screwed up but she got lucky. She could have lost Eric. Someday she knows the right woman is out there for him. Maybe she can look past the being perfect and love him the way he is. He tells her to go; he just wants to be alone. She strokes his hair lovingly before she goes.", "Bill says everyone is here so get the party started. Justin welcomes everyone and says he thinks he can speak for everyone that this moment has finally come.

Wow. Look at you.", "Brooke: Look at this! Sorry -- sorry I'm late.", "Bill: No apologies. Everything okay?", "Brooke: It is now.", "[Both chuckles]", "Bill: Tell me about it. We're finally here. Let's do this!", "Brooke: [Giggles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Quinn?", "Quinn: You're here.", "[Cell phone chimes]", "Ridge: Yeah, but you shouldn't be here because Brooke is coming.", "Quinn: Actually, she's not coming.", "[Door closes]", "Quinn: Wyatt just texted me. She's with Bill. They're getting married.", "Ridge: No, she can't do that.", "Quinn: Ridge, stop.", "Ridge: There's still time.", "Quinn: I think your time is up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: There's a lot of stuff in here.", "Nicole: [Laughs] Say goodbye to leaving the house with just your wallet and your phone.", "Zende: Someday soon. I can feel it. Don't get discouraged, okay? I know it hasn't happened yet, but it will.", "Nicole: [Chuckles] Being with Lizzy like this makes me realize just how much I want a family of our own.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: We were gonna put our family back together.", "Quinn: You're still a family.", "Ridge: I promised R.J., and I let him down.", "Quinn: R.J. is smart and mature. He'll be fine.", "Ridge: Yeah. The love of my life is marrying another man because I'm an idiot. Because I have to keep playing games.", "Quinn: We all have our faults, ridge.", "Ridge: Yeah. Have to keep playing games with my father's wife. I was gonna spend the rest of my life with Brooke, and now I've lost her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Does she look absolutely stunning? I am the luckiest man on the planet.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Justin: Amazing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: It's amazing how happy you guys are.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: And, seriously, we cannot thank you enough for what you've done for this guy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Oh, well, he's done even more for me.", "[Door opens]", "Maya: Hello! Hey!", "Brooke: Oh! Hi!", "Maya: Look at this! It's stunning!", "Brooke: Oh, thank you!", "Maya: Of course.", "Brooke: You look beautiful. Hi, sweetie. Mwah!", "Bill: All right, everybody's here! Let's get this party started!", "Maya: All right!", "Rick: This is it?", "Brooke: Uh, yes. We just wanted to keep it small and intimate.", "Maya: Well, we're just happy we could be here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Justin: If the bride and groom would be so kind in joining me...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: You don't have to say it twice. Yep! Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Hey, guys.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Hey, guys.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Justin: Thank you for being here to witness and to celebrate the union of Bill Spencer and Brooke Logan in marriage. I think I can speak for everyone in this room in saying it's about dang time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laughter]", "Zende: Still out.", "Nicole: I can't help it. I can't stop thinking about being parents... ...having a baby of our own... ...being pregnant again. I loved being pregnant.", "Zende: I know. Sorry I missed so much of it.", "Nicole: Well, this time, it will be different. I just want it to happen.", "Zende: It will. We haven't been trying that long.", "Nicole: Believe me, I'm not complaining. [Chuckles] I love our life the way it is. Being married, working at Forrester, being part of Lizzy's family... just having a baby would make it more wonderful.", "Zende: Some things can't be rushed.", "Nicole: Yeah, but we can keep checking. I bought another pregnancy test.", "Zende: Hmm? What?", "Nicole: I have it with me. I mean, there's no harm in checking.", "Zende: Okay.", "Nicole: This could be it.", "Zende: [Exhales sharply]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: I'm sorry, I -- I didn't mean for it to sound like this is your fault. I'm not -- I'm not blaming you. I'm disappointed in me.", "Quinn: No, you tried to fix it. Brooke just wouldn't give you another chance.", "Ridge: Bill has always been there for her. Logan never has to question his loyalty or who he is. I don't know who I am. I always thought I was this, uh, knight in shining armor, protecting women and helping them, and I'm not that at all. I'M...a deeply flawed human being. An insecure man who just needs every woman to love him and to adore him. Just love me, that's all I need. And you know what? Brooke used to be that way, but she grew up. And I'm stuck here. With yet another failed relationship.", "Quinn: She wouldn't listen. I tried to tell her what happened...", "Ridge: No, she listened. She heard me. She did. But she didn't understand me. And if Logan doesn't understand me, I don't think that there's a woman out there that can.", "Quinn: I do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Justin: We go back a long way. I've seen this guy at his best, and I've seen him at his worst. And when he's happy, oh, he's amazing to be around, but when he's not -- oooh! That's another story. On behalf of myself, as well as everyone at Spencer publications, I thank you, Brooke. I have never seen him happier than he is with you. I have also never seen him so eager to close a deal.", "Bill: Then let's close it already.", "Justin: You wanted me to do this, and I'm gonna do it right. Bill and Brooke, you have come here before these witnesses to commit yourselves to each other for the rest of your lives. Now, this is normally when I say, \"are there any objections?\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: I'd actually like to say something.", "Brooke: Please.", "Maya: It's not an objection. Don't worry. I have a wish for you both. Don't ever forget how hard you worked to get here. Declaring your devotion to the one you love is an incredible feeling. And to share it with family is wonderful. But I think we all know that every day of marriage is not so wonderful. So when things are not as perfect as they are today, remember how hard you worked and what you had to overcome. That is my wish for you, that you never stop trying to win each other's hearts.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Nobody's better at sabotaging themselves than I am. It's been the story of my life. Until Eric. And I almost screwed that up.", "Ridge: But you didn't. You're fine.", "Quinn: Thank god. That doesn't make us different. We both screwed up. I just got lucky. Your luck will change.", "Ridge: I was hoping it would change today.", "Quinn: [Sighs] Yeah, I know. I'm sorry that it didn't, but... someday... what I'm trying to say is, I think that right woman is out there for you. Maybe she has her own flaws or she's also frustrated and confused. Or maybe she can just see past your flaws. She can see the best in you. And she doesn't need you to be perfect. Or her knight in shining armor.", "Ridge: You should go. I want to be alone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door closes]", "Wyatt: Today's a big day. We know what it means to you. Because it means a lot to us, too. 'Cause we're the ones you've talked to, and we've seen it close up. Your devotion, your dedication, your sheer will and faith to get you to this moment. I'm happy and honored to witness it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Thank you, son.", "Liam: Oh, boy. Well, if we're -- if we're doing speeches, I, um... I prepared a little something. It's a sonnet called \"father.\" Kidding.", "[Laughter]", "Bill: Lucky for you.", "Liam: And I'm not gonna talk about how long you've both waited to get here. You're here now because you're ready now. Brooke, I cannot tell you how happy I am to see you standing next to my father. Look! Look at that stupid smile on his face, just look at it!", "[Laughter]", "Liam: I wish you both the very best, and I know you'll have a long and happy future together.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Whoa, no one can make my mom teary-eyed, unless it's gonna be me!", "[Laughter]", "Rick: Life's funny. Things happen that change your perspective. Things you never fully understood, you learn to value. Like my mom's heart. Because she always followed it. I didn't always appreciate how courageous of an act that was. But now I know. Because you taught me to lead with my heart. And I'll forever be thankful for that. You have my blessing and support.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Tick, tick goes the clock. Your auntie should be back any minute. You want to read this to me? Come on. You're so smart! What'd it say?", "Nicole: Negative. I'm not pregnant.", "Zende: Well, that's all right, that's okay.", "Nicole: I was hoping, you know?", "Zende: I know, babe. I know.", "Nicole: And then I walk in here and see you and Lizzy being so cute.", "Zende: Oh, no, that's all her! Not me.", "Nicole: You're going to be an amazing father, Zende.", "Zende: Our kid is gonna be so lucky to have you as his mom.", "Nicole: His?", "Zende: Or hers.", "Nicole: Or his and hers.", "Zende: Twins? Wouldn't that be nice?", "Nicole: We can have a whole houseful, or just one. All I know is I want to get our family started.", "Zende: I know.", "Nicole: Hey!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: This is our journey. But I don't know how it's gonna end. I don't care how it's gonna end. As long as I'm with you.", "Brooke: Stephanie's ring...", "Ridge: Will you marry me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Justin: Bill, do you take Brooke to be your wife? Do you promise to love, honor, and cherish her through every triumph and challenge, forsaking all others, for the rest of your life?", "Bill: I absolutely do.", "Justin: Brooke, do you take Bill to be your husband? Do you promise to love, honor, and cherish him through every triumph and challenge, forsaking all others, for the rest of your life?", "Brooke: I do. [Laughs] I -- I can't believe that we're actually here. I just love you so much.", "Bill: I love you.", "Brooke: You have given me so much strength and so much courage. A sense of stability. I really can't find the words to tell you how thankful I am. But you are the guy for me. You're the man that I can count on, the man that will be there for me, no matter what. That being said, I vow to love you as fearlessly and ferociously as you love me. For the rest of my life, I am yours.", "Bill: Brooke, we're not here because of me. We're here because of you and what you mean to me. I cannot imagine my life without you. You are the very air that I breathe. This is my greatest adventure. Loving you, sharing this life with you, taking on the world together, and I will love you and be there for you forever and a day.", "Justin: There is just one more thing. Bill and Brooke, give these rings to each other as a symbol of your unending love and commitment. Wear them, and remember the vows you made today.", "Bill: Brooke, you take this ring as a symbol of my unending love and commitment to you.", "Brooke: [Sighs] Bill... [Giggles] Take this ring as a symbol of my unending love and commitment to you.", "Justin: I am genuinely honored to pronounce you husband and wife. Bill, you may kiss the bride.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laughter]", "Maya: Whoo-hoo!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Yeah!", "Brooke: [Giggles]", "Justin: I present to you Mr. and Mrs. \"Dollar Bill\" Spencer!", "Liam: Yeah!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Ahh!"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFY3YxGWhto"}
