{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7071 ~ Maya makes a major decision about the future; Brooke makes a move she thinks is in Rick's best interest."], "Recap": ["Rick wakes up in bed and is desperate to find Maya. Eric thanks Scott for being near the crash and bringing him home. Rick rambles that he has to speak to Maya to explain. He can handle all the humiliation, mockery and scandal. He has been through it many times and he knows this may seem like a disaster in the short term but he swears to his dad that he will bring the company through this somehow untarnished. He keeps wanting to get out of bed and to find Maya. Eric tells him to please rest and do as the doctor says. He is lucky he did not have a head injury. Brooke too has to restrain him. Rick says he must explain, he remembers things he said to her. Brooke says she knows but Maya lied to him and kept things from him. Rick insists Maya did not lie to him so Brooke should quit saying that. Yes things took too long to tell him but he is very clear that she never lied to him even if Brooke is not clear about that. He says he still loves her and she needs to know that. Nicole finds Maya holed up in her old room. She says this is where she is living now. Pam tells Ridge the news is everywhere now, Maya is transgender. Even Charlie knew but she just thought he was joking. She gets a text from Eric that Rick was in an accident. She tells Ridge that Maya was not with him. Ridge says he knew it; Rick has totally freaked out. Maya is stunned when Nicole tells her that she told Wyatt, but he promised he would not say anything. Maya can't believe she did that when Wyatt's dad is the biggest media mogul on the planet. Nicole apologizes and says she never meant to hurt Maya nor wanted this to happen. Maya calms down and says it was not all Nicole's fault. Nicole asks if Rick proposed and Maya says yes; it was the most beautiful, romantic moment of her life. She wanted to say yes but not until she had told him everything. He was shocked and disappointed but he understood and he told her that he still loved her. She says she tried to explain but the phone kept buzzing and then Rick called Bill and his dad and the way he talked about shame and embarrassment, she would not stay and listen to that so she left. She says she can handle the fallout but Rick should not have to so that is why she left. He is better off without her. Jake hands Ridge an e-mail he should see \u0096 Maya has sent in her resignation. Several more times Rick tries to get up and leave and go find Maya. He must explain. He still loves her and accepts her as she is; he does not care about her past. He tells Brooke that he proposed. She asks if he is engaged and he says no, Maya would not accept until she told him about herself. Brooke says what Bill did was inexcusable but Maya is not blameless either. She should have told him a long time ago. Rick is enraged that most everyone but him knew about it and was talking behind his back. Brooke reminds him again to calm down. She and Eric will be downstairs if he needs anything.", "Nicole tells Maya that she can't quit. She made a life for herself at Forrester and she can not give that up. Maya said she wanted it and a life with Rick. They were a team and now this press and backlash. She says she tried to talk to him while they were in their cars and she gave him every opportunity to say he still loved her and wanted to get married, but he hung up. Ridge slips past Brooke and Eric in the living room and goes up to Rick's bedroom. Rick feels he is there to lord it over him that everyone knew but him. Ridge says they do need to take control of the situation and if Rick is too tied up with personal problems then he can take over. Brooke tells Eric that if Maya wanted to talk to Rick she would be here now. She is not going to judge Maya for the decision to be who she is now but she has been involved with Rick for a very long time now and should have told him before Bill publicized it. Rick trusted her but she turned out to be just like every other woman in Rick's life, Caroline and Amber .she let him down. Rick reminds Ridge that he is still CEO but Ridge counters that really as it looks right now that he is hiding under the covers. Rick says he does not have to tell Ridge anything. Ridge fires back that no he doesn't as he already knew. He knew before Rick did. But Rick always thinks he knows best and no one tells him what to do. That's just how arrogant he is .and now the portrait downstairs on the wall with the new matriarch .the woman behind the man. But Rick freaked out just like he did with Caroline and could not face it. His girlfriend told him she was transgender and he could not handle that and he snapped. He lost it just like he loses it with every woman in his life. He turns to leave and says Ricky boy brought this on himself. Rick gets up and lunges after him."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Eric: [Echoing] Thank you for bringing him home, Scott.", "Scott: [Echoing] Well, Rick insisted on getting back to L.A.

No more chasing after Maya. Rick, you could have been seriously hurt tonight.", "Rick: The only one who's hurting is Maya. The things I said to Bill and to dad... I should've known how it would sound.", "Brooke: Honey, stop, please. The doctor doesn't want you to get upset.", "Rick: Then let me call her. She needs to know that I still love her. I didn't get a chance to say that on the phone.", "Brooke: Maya can wait to hear what you have to say. She made you wait long enough. Didn't she?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I told Wyatt that it was a secret.", "Maya: Not anymore. It's everywhere.

And he told me he still loved me.", "Nicole: So...I don't get it. Why did you leave?", "Maya: I had to tell him the rest. About Brooke and Carter and Ridge. How they all knew and he didn't. And I tried to explain, but his phone kept buzzing with all these stories. And then he called Bill and his father and... [Sighs] The things he was saying... he said nothing had changed and that everything was okay. But the way he talked about it, about me... shame and embarrassment. I wasn't gonna sit there and listen to that. So I left.", "Nicole: Rick loves you. You said he understood.", "Maya: Before it all came out.", "Nicole: That's not your fault.", "Maya: I can handle the fallout. Rick shouldn't have to. He is better off without me. That's why I left.

Should I go ahead and do that?", "Ridge: No. I'll take care of it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Tell us what happened, son.", "Rick: Maya was in the room with me when I was on the phone with you, dad. I just didn't take into consideration how it would make her feel.", "Brooke: Honey, you have every right to be angry.", "Rick: With Bill. [Inhales sharply] For taking it public.", "Brooke: Yes, what Bill did was despicable, but Maya isn't blameless. She should've told you a long time ago.", "Rick: She didn't know how I would react.", "Brooke: All the more reason for her to get it out in the open before you developed feelings for her, before you made her the face of the company.", "Rick: No, I don't -- I don't regret that. I don't regret any of that. Yeah, I was in shock when she told me. I had just asked her to marry me.", "Brooke: She let you propose? Are you engaged?", "Rick: No. No, she wouldn't take the ring until she told me.", "Brooke: Good. Okay. So you have some time to think about it.", "Rick: No, I don't -- I don't care about Maya's past, mom. I just love her.", "Eric: You accept her.", "Rick: Yes. The thing that enrages me the most is how everybody was talking about it behind my back without telling me a word. You, and you, dad, and Ridge. All this time. [Scoffs] These cryptic warnings, this smug attitude, saying that I didn't know Maya... just waving your little secret in front of me, just -- just like you did with Caroline.", "Eric: Your brother was concerned about you.", "Rick: No, he was toying with me. He was trying to use this to his advantage.", "Brooke: Honey, please. You need to calm down.", "Rick: All right. All right.", "Eric: Good. Stay calm. You need to recover.", "Brooke: I want you to relax. We're gonna be downstairs if you need anything.", "Rick: What I need is to talk to Maya.", "Eric: We'll let you know if she calls or tries to get in touch with you, all right? In the meantime, you rest. Try to get some sleep.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: No. You can't quit. You earned your place at Forrester. You made a life for yourself. You can't just give that up.", "Maya: I wanted a life with Rick. I wanted to be someone he could trust and rely on. We were a team. We were good together until this. This press and backlash.", "Nicole: Like the Forresters have never caused a scandal before. Come on, Maya. If anybody can take a little bad press --", "Maya: I don't expect you to understand. You didn't hear what he said to his father. No, Rick...Rick is a good man. And he wants to accept me as I am. But this is bigger than us. This is his family and the business and his career. He's worked too hard to get to where he is.", "Nicole: You need to talk to him.", "Maya: I tried. In the car. I-I gave him the opportunity to tell me he loved me. I asked him if he still wanted to get married.", "Nicole: What did he say?", "Maya: He hung up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Rick still loves her. I have to believe Maya feels the same way about him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Then where is she, Eric? The truth is out. There's nothing keeping them apart. Why isn't she upstairs with our son?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: [Groans]", "Rick: How? How could you let this happen?", "Maya: I didn't let it happen. No one gave me a choice.", "Rick: Ridge has been laughing at me behind my back.", "Maya: I guess that makes me the office joke.", "Rick: I'm just -- I'm just saying, the last conversation I had with him, he knew. And I couldn't figure out for the life of me what he's been lording over me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Knock on door]", "Ridge: Well, at least you're in one piece.", "Rick: Who let you in?", "Ridge: I got something for you.", "Rick: Get out, Ridge.", "Ridge: You're gonna want to see this.", "Rick: Yeah, I already know.", "Ridge: Okay. So what are you gonna do about it?", "Rick: Forrester doesn't respond to tabloid rumors.", "Ridge: Rumors? Your girlfriend just confirmed them. Here's an e-mail. \"To whom it may concern, effective immediately, I resign from my position at Forrester Creations. Maya Avant.\"", "Rick: What? No. No, no, no. She can't do this.", "Ridge: Ricky, we have to take control of the situation. But if you're too tied up with personal problems, then I will take over.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Maybe we should call her.", "Brooke: If Maya wanted to talk to Rick, she would be here.", "Eric: Maybe she feels unwelcome. Would she be right?", "Brooke: I'm not going to judge Maya's decision to be who she is now.", "Eric: No, and neither is Rick.", "Brooke: Eric, I'm just worried. How he was chasing her down the mountain, how he crashed his car...", "Eric: I know. This turned out to be a very, very bad night.", "Brooke: Yes, it did. Maya's been involved in our son's life for a long time, and she never, ever said a word about this.", "Eric: I can't imagine a more private, personal thing.", "Brooke: Bill was wrong to publicize it, but Maya was wrong never to say anything. They were involved, Eric. They were planning a life together. They had a very serious relationship. He trusted her. She let him down. Just like Caroline. Just like amber. He thought that she was different. But Maya is just like every other woman in Rick's life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: [Sighs]", "Nicole: Rick loves you.", "Maya: Sometimes that's not enough, Nicole. He doesn't want to marry me.", "Nicole: He didn't say that.", "Maya: He didn't have to. Yeah, what he said to his father was enough.", "Nicole: Well, has he called? Has he texted?", "Maya: It's over.", "Nicole: Have you even checked?", "Maya: I turned it off. It was -- just kept ringing. I don't even know how the press got my number.", "Nicole: I feel so terrible. Do you want me to text Rick, let him know that I'm with you?", "Maya: No.", "Nicole: Does he even know where you are?", "Maya: No. I should've told him. I should've listened to you and -- and to Carter and told him before he proposed. He would've accepted all of me. I know it. I should've told him before anyone else found out. Especially Ridge.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: I told dad. I told him that you would try to use this against me.", "Ridge: I'm thinking about the company.", "Rick: I'm still C.E.O.", "Ridge: Really? 'Cause right now, it looks like you're hiding under the covers.", "Rick: Oh, come on, man. I was in a car accident.", "Ridge: That's right. You wrecked your car up in big bear. Was Maya with you? Were you guys fighting?", "Rick: She left the cabin, and I went after her.", "Ridge: Left why? Why? You scared her?", "Rick: No.", "Ridge: Then why'd she run away from you?", "Rick: I don't have to tell you anything.", "Ridge: No, you really don't. You know why? I already know everything. I knew before you did. Maya. I told you about her. Everybody told you about her. But you know best, don't you? You don't have to listen to anybody. That's how arrogant you are. Things have changed a little bit now, haven't they? Portrait downstairs, you got the Forrester matriarch -- the woman behind the man. You freaked, didn't you? Like you always do. Like you did with Caroline. Say something. Deny it. Say that you're the man who's gonna lead Forrester out of this crisis. You can't. Because your girlfriend told you that she's transgender and you couldn't deal with it. You snapped. And that's why she isn't here. Am I right? You lost it like you always lose it with every woman in your life, every challenge you ever had. You brought this on yourself.", "Rick: No!"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8R1NO8_WqE"}
