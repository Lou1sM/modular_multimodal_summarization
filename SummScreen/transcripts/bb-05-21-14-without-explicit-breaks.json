        "Katie thanks Donna for taking over while Will had an emergency diaper change. She says she probably will go back to work at Spencer someday but for now it feels good to be able to run some errands without worrying about Singapore calling. She is enjoying her free life. Donna is glad as she does not know how Katie will take it when she says Brooke and Bill are getting married. She is sorry to blurt it out this way. Katie says it is okay. She knew it was a possibility but it is a shock to hear it is actually happening. Donna says it is not retaliation. Bill persisted and Brooke resisted because of the two people she loves most in this world \u0096 Katie and Ridge. Katie asks if Brooke is now just writing her off. Donna says no but she probably thinks Katie doesn't care about her anymore. Brooke rushes in and literally pulls Ridge off of Bill and separates them. Bill threatens Ridge that if he ever does that again ..Ridge asks Brooke if she really wants to marry this clown. Bill tells Slick that he's the only one who lives up to his standards. That ought to tell him something. Brooke tells Ridge that yes she wants to marry Bill and she is going to. Ridge keeps saying she is better than this and calls her Logan. She asks him not to call her that. Ridge says there is only one reason she is rushing and forcing herself into this. Bill says yes, he is sure it is all about Ridge. Ridge says he has not forgotten their time together and what they meant to each other. And when she is angry she usually finds another man to hurt him and it usually works. Brooke says all memories are selective and she is sorry he is left with those. Bill puffs that he doesn't spend a lot of time on motives. He doesn't spend time sussing people out on their inner purity. He goes by what they say and do. And he knows Ridge gets some kind of twisted satisfaction out of bullying her. He tells Ridge to now get the hell out of his office. Ridge tells Brooke not to throw herself off a cliff to spite him. She tells him to see it the way he wants; it's her life. He asks about RJ, what will happen if she marries this buffoon. It's not too late to change her mind. Wyatt asks his mom what his dad said. She pretends that she barely paid attention. She says he is so stunted in terms of his mental age. He's really younger than Wyatt, all swagger and hormones. Wyatt asks if he came on to her. She scoffs about her fall for another Spencer line. It isn't love, it's foolish but not as foolish as that. She wonders if that is how Wyatt sees her, a lonely old mom trying to get close to a man who doesn't want her and never did. He says he does not think of her as a mom with milk ad cookies and strict curfew but as an artist. He doesn't think of her as lonely but a little too passionate sometimes and fierce. She says she will always be proud of the one good thing she produced and that was someone as perfect as Wyatt. She was not a nun; she had dates. Wyatt doesn't remember them and she says they were not important enough for him to meet. She was just hooking up, Wyatt doesn't want his ears to her anymore. He says this is the end of the line with TMI, time to get off. She tells him that he is more of a woman than she is. To a woman it's all about the couple. To a man you are attached or unattached. To women you are supposed to be wanted. And sometimes even after all these years it comes over her like an illness that wanting to be wanted, but she will despise herself for a few days and then it will pass. She says she knows Wyatt thinks she needs someone and that someone is his father. At one point she did too. But he didn't and he still doesn't. So really nothing has changed except Wyatt knows. Wyatt wants to ask his mom one question about his dad. There was a time when he was not with Brooke or Katie, so Quinn could have tested the waters with him then. She admits she may have gotten her toe wet.",
        "Katie tells Donna that Brooke throwing her under the bus and taking her job and sole custody of Will away hurt and marrying Bill won't help. Donna tells her to be careful as a very crass person could say Katie tried to even the score by being engaged to Ridge and now Brooke is one-upping it again. Katie wonders if she deserves that. Donna says she is sorry but she just hates this constant competition between her and Brooke. Katie says it does not matter what she wants. This is the situation they have. It is bizarre and it sucks but they will deal with it for the children. She wants them to be as unaffected by this mess as they can be. Ridge comes back to Katie's and she sees his disheveled look, missing a button on his jacket. He must know about the wedding. He calls it low comedy. He says but it doesn't matter, they are not getting married. Katie knows that he means he'd rather they not get married. Katie says Brooke's mantra is love conquers all so there is not much they can do about it. Ridge says he wants to make sure that she knows this has nothing to do with what he feels for Katie or even Brooke, it's all about Bill. She tells him he will drive himself crazy over this as Brooke and Bill are gonna do what they want to do and Ridge has no say in it. A bit disheveled himself Bill tells Brooke it could have been worse. She says this will never happen again. He tells her that is up to her ex but he's dead serious. She's going to put that ring on her finger and never take it off again. Ridge is going to have to accept it and this is never going to happen again. They agree that it is a great time to get away and go to Dubai. He says she can get whatever clothes she needs there. She says as long as she is sitting next to him, she will be fine. She's never had this before. With Ridge there was always another woman, Caroline, Taylor now Katie. But she is sure about Bill. He asks if she can be ready by tomorrow. She replies yes she has told Donna and she will know RJ's school activities. Bill says good and they won't have to deal with her ex's little temper tantrums any more or hear how he's not a good stepfather. Justin comes in to congratulate them. Bill has a little job for him. Justin smiles and says that he usually does. He says he helped him with one of these for Liam, now he'd like another replicated. Brooke is so excited to hear they are actually going to be married in Abu Dhabi."

        "Katie: It's all better now, right?",
        "Donna: Okay. Here you go.",
        "Katie: Here you go.",
        "[Will crying]",
        "Katie: Here you go.",
        "Donna: Honey, you're tired.",
        "Katie: What's that? Throw that in there.",
        "[Crying stops]",
        "Katie: Thank you so much for watching him. I love to work, I really do, and I know that's hard for some people to understand, but it's so nice to be able to run some errands and not worry about what's happening in Singapore or that conference call that I need to make.",
        "Donna: So, you're not missing Spencer, then?",
        "Katie: Oh. [Sighs] I probably will go back at some point. But for right now, I'm just enjoying my free time and enjoying my life.",
        "Donna: I am glad, because I really wasn't sure how you were gonna take Brooke's news. [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: What news?",
        "Donna: Oh.",
        "Katie: Well, we haven't spoken. I mean, it's kind of a special occasion when we do.",
        "Donna: Oh, yeah. I-I just figured maybe Bill mentioned something. Bill and Brooke are getting married.",
        "Wyatt: What did dad say?",
        "Quinn: I really can't remember the last time I paid attention.",
        "Wyatt: Was it something he did?",
        "Quinn: You know, he really is a very stunted person. You know, in terms of mental age, he's a lot younger than you -- all swagger and hormones.",
        "Wyatt: He didn't come on to you, did he?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Would I be desperate enough for -- to fall for yet another line from Bill Spencer?",
        "Wyatt: Come on, mom. It's me you're talking to, here, okay?",
        "Quinn: It isn't love. Nothing as foolish as that. It's foolish. Not as foolish as that.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I wondered if you two were getting closer.",
        "Quinn: Is that how you think of me? Lonely old mom trying to get close to a man who doesn't want me and never did?",
        "Wyatt: Will you stop? I don't think of you as a mom with milk and cookies and a strict curfew, okay? I think of you as an artist. I never think of you as lonely, but I think of you as fierce -- a bit too passionate, sometimes, but fierce.",
        "Quinn: I'll always be proud that at least one thing I made came out as perfectly as you.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Donna: I'm so sorry to just blurt it out like that.",
        "Katie: No, it's -- listen, I knew it was a possibility. I guess it just... [Sighs] It's kind of a shock to hear that it's actually happening.",
        "Donna: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Even though Brooke was so adamant that it never would.",
        "Donna: Things change.",
        "Katie: Yeah, they certainly do. And a lot of what Brooke says is very different from what she actually does.",
        "Donna: Well, you'd never actually been engaged to Ridge before.",
        "Katie: So, you think this is retaliation?",
        "Donna: No. Look, Bill persisted and -- and Brooke resisted because of the two people who are most important to her in the world -- Ridge and you.",
        "Katie: And you think she's just writing us off?",
        "Donna: No. I-I think she just...thinks that you don't care about her anymore.",
        "Brooke: Ridge. Ridge! Get off of him! Get off! Wait, Bill. No. No! Bill.",
        "Bill: You ever come at me like that again, and so help me...",
        "Ridge: [Breathing heavily] You really want to marry this clown?",
        "Bill: You ever notice you're the only one who lives up to your standards? Doesn't that tell you something, slick?",
        "Brooke: Yes, I want to marry Bill. And I'm going to.",
        "Ridge: You know yourself better than this, Logan.",
        "Brooke: Don't call me that.",
        "Ridge: There's only one reason why you're f-forcing yourself into this. You're rushing into this.",
        "Bill: Let me guess -- Brooke marrying me is all about you.",
        "Ridge: Do you really think I've forgotten our time together -- who we were to each other and what you do? When you're angry at me, you always try to find a man to hurt me, and it usually works.",
        "Brooke: All memories are selective, and I'm sorry you're left with those.",
        "Bill: The only difference between you and me -- I don't spend a lot of time on motives. Is Brooke using me? Well, the question itself is ridiculous. I also don't spend a lot of time sussing people out for their inner purity. I go by what they say and what they do. And that's how I know that Brooke wants to spend her life with me. And that's also how I know that you get some kind of twisted satisfaction out of bullying her. Now get the hell out of my office.",
        "Ridge: Don't throw yourself off a cliff to spite me.",
        "Brooke: See it the way you want to see it. It's my life.",
        "Ridge: What about our son's life? What's gonna happen to him if he has this buffoon as a stepfather? It's never too late to change your mind.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: I wasn't a nun, you know? I had dates.",
        "Wyatt: Well, why don't I remember them?",
        "Quinn: 'Cause none of them were important enough for you to meet. And you know, when I say, \"dates,\" it's like you kids these days, uh, \"hooking up.\" I was \"hooking up.\"",
        "Wyatt: Oh -- oh, wow. Okay. Okay, we've -- we've reached the TMI point. This is the -- the end of the line, you know? Everybody get off.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, you know what? You're really more of a woman than I am.",
        "Wyatt: Really? Is there any -- any guidance on how I should take that as a compliment? Huh?",
        "Quinn: You know, to a woman, it's all about the couple.",
        "Wyatt: Uh-huh.",
        "Quinn: You're never just you. You're either attached or you're unattached. And that label follows you wherever you go. Nobody cares if the boss is married until he shows up to the -- to the Christmas party with either a babe or a frump. But if that boss is a woman, the question always is, \"who's she married to?\" \"Who's she divorced from?\" \"Who did she sleep with to get in on this job?\" We are not supposed to want anything except to be wanted. And sometimes... sometimes, it comes over me, you know, like an illness, even after all these years -- that -- that wanting to be wanted. And I despise myself for it for a few days. And then it goes away.",
        "Katie: Listen, there was a time when I-I thought that we could mend the rift between us, but...",
        "Donna: So, her being engaged to Bill doesn't change that?",
        "Katie: Well... [Chuckles] Her throwing me under the bus and taking away my job and sole custody of my son kind of changes that, and...you know, her marrying Bill doesn't help. [Sighs]",
        "Donna: I'd be careful.",
        "Katie: Careful of what?",
        "Donna: Oh, I don't know. A very crass person might say that, um, you felt that you evened the score when Ridge proposed, and now she's one-upping you again.",
        "Katie: [Chuckling] Wow. Did I deserve that?",
        "Donna: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just -- I just feel like there's this constant competition between the two of you. I mean, do you really want it to be that way?",
        "Katie: It doesn't matter what I want, donna. I mean, this is the situation that we have. It -- it sucks, it's bizarre, but we're going to deal with it because we have children, and I want to make sure that they are as unaffected by this mess as possible.",
        "Donna: So...it doesn't bother you -- Bill getting married, again?",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Could have been worse.",
        "Brooke: This is never gonna happen again.",
        "Bill: That's up to your ex.",
        "Brooke: I'm dead serious.",
        "Bill: So am I. This ring is never coming off this finger again. Listen. It's gonna be what it's gonna be. He's going to accept it or he's not. But I can tell you this -- nothing like that is ever gonna happen again.",
        "Brooke: You know what?",
        "Bill: Hmm?",
        "Brooke: This is a great time to get away.",
        "Bill: All right, then let's get out of here.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Let's get out of here. Let's take that magical trip that you have planned to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Seven emirates, one country.",
        "Bill: Abu Dhabi and Dubai are its biggest cities.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. What's the weather like? What do I pack?",
        "Bill: Uh, well, actually, it's pretty much like it is here. As far as your packing goes, you know, it doesn't matter. Whatever you need, we'll get it there.",
        "Brooke: Okay. And the flight -- is it long?",
        "Bill: Uh, actually, yeah. You know, it is pretty long, but when we fly home, we get here fore we leave there, by the clock.",
        "Brooke: Interesting.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Well, as long as I'm sitting next to you, all's going to be just peachy keen. [Chuckles] I don't want to miss a minute with us. You know, it's interesting. I-I've never had this before. With Ridge, there was always another woman -- there was Caroline or Taylor or Katie. Do you mind if I feel sure about you?",
        "Bill: That's been my mission all along.",
        "Brooke: It's nice -- no competition. I don't have to try to be better than anybody else.",
        "Wyatt: Can I ask you a question without you getting mad?",
        "Quinn: We'll see.",
        "Wyatt: I know you think about dad.",
        "Quinn: I'm still waiting for the question.",
        "Wyatt: There was a time, and it wasn't just overnight, it lasted awhile, where both Brooke and Katie wanted nothing to do with him. Why didn't you test the waters then? Or did you?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I may have gotten a toe wet.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Hey.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Where's the boy?",
        "Katie: Uh, he's napping. Finally. [Chuckles] So...it looks like you know that Bill and Brooke are getting married.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I heard about that.",
        "Katie: Well, I guess we can't be surprised. You lost a button. What happened to you today?",
        "Ridge: Uh, I guess you could file that under \"low comedy.\"",
        "Katie: It's not what I think it is, is it?",
        "Ridge: If -- I don't know what you're thinking, but let's just let it go.",
        "Katie: Did you and Bill get into a fight?",
        "Ridge: Ah... Brooke was there to break it up.",
        "Katie: Oh, my god! How did this happen?",
        "Ridge: It doesn't matter how it happened. But they're not getting married.",
        "Katie: You mean that you would rather they not get married.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: So, you told that to Brooke, and what did she say?",
        "Ridge: \"Love conquers all.\"",
        "Katie: Right. Which is her mantra. I mean, I suppose there's nothing we can really do about it.",
        "Ridge: You understand this has nothing to do with the way I feel about you? Or even my feelings for Brooke, right?",
        "Katie: Right. Sure. Sure. They -- it's all about how you feel about Bill.",
        "Ridge: That's right.",
        "Katie: And your feelings about him are stronger than your feelings for just about... well, just about anybody. Am I right?",
        "Ridge: I don't know what to do.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Help me.",
        "Katie: You're gonna make yourself crazy trying to fight this. You can't control Brooke. You -- you can't control Bill. They're gonna do what they're gonna do, and we don't have a say in it.",
        "Ridge: She quit him once. She washed her hands of him. And there's a chance she'll do it again.",
        "Katie: Okay. How?",
        "Ridge: I don't know how. But I know he has no ethics.",
        "Katie: Brooke's a grown-up. All right? She knows all about Bill, she knows what he's capable of, and she doesn't care. Maybe she did once, but not anymore.",
        "Quinn: Have we had our little mother/son chat?",
        "Wyatt: Don't belittle it. Have you noticed that there is a constant theme with all of our conversations like this?",
        "Quinn: Yes. You ask a lot of questions.",
        "Wyatt: No, I want to know more about you, and you won't let me.",
        "Quinn: You realize you always claim, \"TMI! Mom, TMI!\"",
        "Wyatt: Try me. Try me.",
        "Quinn: I know you think I need someone. And I know you think that someone could be your father.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: And at one point, I did, too. But he didn't. And he still doesn't. And now, really, the situation hasn't changed except now you know.",
        "Bill: All right. So, we're gonna leave tomorrow. Can you manage that?",
        "Brooke: I'll make sure Donna's around in case R.J. Or his school has any questions.",
        "Bill: All right. Great. That's all the arranging you need to do?",
        "Brooke: Yep. That's it.",
        "Bill: Perfect. We're not gonna have to deal with your ex-husband and all of his little, uh, tantrums any longer. I mean, you know, what does he think? He -- he owns you? And this nonsense about me not being a good stepfather to R.J.? We'll see about that. Hey, Justin. Come on in.",
        "Justin: Hey. Word is congratulations are in order.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yes! [Chuckles]",
        "Justin: Nice!",
        "Bill: And we're getting married overseas and leaving tomorrow.",
        "Brooke: Wait, what?",
        "Bill: Listen, you know, I love you, but I got a little thing going with him, too, so I just need a few minutes, and what's a few minutes when we're gonna have a lifetime together?",
        "Brooke: Uh, okay. I have some questions.",
        "Bill: Well, and I have you. Life couldn't be better.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Brooke: Oh, it's donna.",
        "Bill: Oh, go ahead. Take it. Make the arrangements for R.J.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Hi, sweetie.",
        "Justin: Per your instructions.",
        "Bill: Perfect. I got another job for you.",
        "Justin: You usually do.",
        "Bill: All right. Remember how you got this replicated for me for -- for Liam?",
        "Justin: Yeah, sure. You need another one?",
        "Brooke: Yes, I will e-mail you all of the contact information to R.J.'S school, and you and I will touch base when I get there. [Chuckling] Okay. Thank you. You, too.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Justin: Hey. Have a great trip.",
        "Brooke: Thanks, Justin.",
        "Justin: You're welcome.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Are we there yet?",
        "Brooke: Oh. So, are you serious? Really? We're getting married in Abu Dhabi?",
        "Bill: Did I say that?",
        "Brooke: Didn't you?",
        "Bill: In a secret location... in a romantic, unique location, you will become my princess.",
        "Brooke: [Giggles] What if I don't know how to be a princess?",
        "Bill: Oh, princesses are born. They are not made.",
        "Brooke: And how do I know which one I am?",
        "Bill: You can always tell a true princess by her kiss.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yeah?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: That sounds intrusive.",
        "Bill: Oh, I'll show you intrusive. Stop talking and kiss me.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Abu Dhabi, here we come! [Laughs]",
        "Bill: We're out of here.",
        "Brooke: I'm so excited!",
