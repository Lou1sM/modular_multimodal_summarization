        "Ridge tells Katie it's beginning to look like a better morning. He can't believe he let Bill get him that way. Everything he says sends a message and it's not all right with him to be a step dad to RJ. It's driving him crazy. Liam slips into Hope's office while she is having a hard time making a decision over fabrics/designs/colors. He kisses her. Then says his dad is out of town today and her house is going to be empty so they could make plans. Hope is not following along until Liam says she must not know but Bill is taking Brooke out of the country and they are leaving for the Middle East today. Hope is stunned. Wyatt calls his Dad who answers the phone \u0096 Spencer. Wyatt quips this is Spencer also and it means so much to have his name. He's calling about his mom as she is having a hard time with Bill being engaged now. She doesn't want him to know but Wyatt thinks he should. Maybe Bill could talk to her. Bill says not now. He's is going out of town, in fact out of the country. He and Brooke are going it be married in Dubai. Hope wants to hear more from Liam about this Dubai trip. He says good they can discuss it at the pool at her house. Wyatt walks up about that time and says great, he'd love a pool party and his trunks are in the truck. Liam says he is not invited. Wyatt says then who will tell Hope the big news. Bill and her mom are getting married. Brooke walks up to Katie's bedroom and asks if Ridge is there. Katie says he just left. Brooke says that is good; best they talk alone. Katie says she knows already that she and Bill are getting married. Brooke says yes she and Bill are leaving town today and when they get back they will be married. She says she doesn't expect a congratulations and she doesn't want to get into it with Ridge but she wanted him and RJ to know where she'd be. Katie says Ridge has a problem with Bill being RJ's step dad. As a matter of fact he has a problem with Brooke even marrying Bill. Brooke says she has moved on just as Ridge has so he will have to get used to it. Katie tells her that she can't lie about it. Her marrying Bill is always going to bother her. So much has happened and she wishes she could get past it but she doesn't know how to do that. Maybe it can't be solved or maybe time will help this heal. Brooke says she hopes it will. Bill settles in his cabin on the jet. Michael tells him the flight plans are ready and just waiting for Brooke. Justin joins him for a moment and Bills wants to make sure that he gave the necklace to the intended party. Justin says yes and told him not to do anything until he heard from Bill. Brooke leaves Katie's and runs right into Ridge. He says he forgot something and was coming back for it. She tells him she just told Katie and wanted to tell him that she is going out of town. He asks if she is skipping town with Spencer .then realizes he is right. She's running off to get married. Brooke says she has to. She certainly can't do it here after how he acted yesterday. This is her life now. This is the way it's going to be. He asks about their life. They have a child together. She says Bill made mistakes with Katie but he is a devoted father. And he loves Brooke. Ridge blurts out that he loves her too. He says he will always love her and wants to do what is best for her. He says he is not the bad guy in this and he hopes once she realizes that it won't be too late.",
        "Hope listens to Wyatt and Liam jaw at each other and says it is a good thing she has two boyfriends .that's the only way she learns about what is happening with her mother. She feels like a third wheel. Wyatt says he'd like to cook for her tonight. Liam says no, she already has plans. Hope didn't know they had plans. Liam says yeah a late pool party or they could take a tip from his Dad and hop on a jet and make it a double wedding. She laughs; Wyatt doesn't. Hope tells Liam that as flattering as that is, she won't be leaving town to get married. Wyatt quips at least not to Liam ..she says not anyone. Wyatt says okay marriage is off the table but there has not been a verdict on out of town trips yet. Liam says he thinks Wyatt has already had his quota. If Hope is going anywhere, it is going to be with him. Hope speaks up and says she has too much work to do. He does not want to be whisked off her feet just yet. She wants to stay grounded and get her head together so she can make a decision soon. And when she does, she trusts that it will be the best for all of them. Liam and Wyatt look at each other and try to put on their happy face. Justin hands Bill a tablet and he speaks with RJ and asks if he got his package. RJ says yes with the necklace that is just like Wyatt's and Liam's. Bill says yes and it is very important and it means he is a member of a very exclusive club. There are only four of these in the world and RJ is the youngest to ever get one. RH says he is already wearing it. Bill likes that. He says he wants him to wear it with pride, Spencer pride. It is not just some trinket but a very expensive piece of jewelry but more important than that it is a symbol of strength. He'll see him soon as he returns. Bill tells Justin that Ridge does not want him involved with his son. That's too bad as he and Brooke are going to be married and RJ will be living with them. So Ridge will have to accept that and quit having these little hissy fits. Bill tells Justin by the way, he is coming with them for whatever might come up. Katie is surprised to see Ridge back home. He says he ran into Brooke outside. She seems to think that what happened to Katie won't happen to her. Katie says maybe it won't. Bill pursued her pretty hard. Ridge says she rejected Bill and he didn't like it. Katie says sometimes accepting things we don't like can be pretty difficult. He thinks she is talking about them. She says no, not really. She is glad he can talk to her about it. She'd be worried if he couldn't. But she is worried about him. He says and that is not what he wants for her. Katie says it is Brooke's life and she gets to make her own choices and she wants Bill. And now they get to make their own choices and lead their own lives. Maybe they should plan their own wedding right here with family and friends. He thinks they should do that."

        "Ridge: I can't believe I let Bill get to me like that, but he does. The thought of him marrying Brooke and being a stepfather to my son -- it just --",

        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Oh, it feels pretty good having your name, Dad, and it means a lot to me and to mom... uh, which is actually why I'm calling. Um, she's having a hard time with your engagement with Brooke, and -- and she doesn't want you to know, and I think that you should.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Maybe you could talk to her.",

        "Brooke: Oh, good. It's probably better for us to talk on our own.",
        "Katie: So, I hear you and Bill are getting married.",
        "Brooke: Bill and his surprises.",
        "Katie: When's the big day?",
        "Brooke: Soon. Bill and I are leaving town, and when we get back... we'll be married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: So, I really like both of these, but my only concern is the difference in price, but I also don't want that to affect sales.",
        "Chapman: I'll work up some projections, and then I'll get back to you.",

        "Liam: Ready to get out of here?",
        "Hope: No, I think I'm ready to hear more details about my mom's little trip to Dubai.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, we could talk about it poolside.",
        "Wyatt: What?! We're having a pool party? That's perfect, 'cause I have my trunks in my truck.",
        "Liam: Not invited, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Well, then who's gonna be the one to tell Hope dad's big news?",
        "Liam: I already told her.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but do you know why?",
        "Liam: Uh, well, I can think of at least one person I'd like to get away from right now. Maybe that's how they're feeling.",

        "Hope: What?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: On the -- they're getting married on the trip?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Dad has it all planned out. You know, it's funny. I wonder why dad didn't tell you about this, Liam. I guess he trusted me to be the one to tell Hope the news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Is Will okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, he's fine. [Sighs] Why are you still here? Are you hoping that I'm gonna say \"congratulations\"?",

        "Katie: You thought I might hear about this through the press?",

        "Katie: Dubai?",
        "Brooke: And Abu Dhabi.",
        "Katie: Wow, that's -- that's really far away.",
        "Brooke: Yes, it is far away. That's why I want Ridge and R.J. to know where I am.",
        "Katie: And you want me to tell them?",
        "Brooke: Donna's already on the school-contact list for R.J., and Bill is waiting for me at the jet, and I didn't want to get in a debate about this with Ridge, and I don't want to argue with you. I just want Ridge and R.J. to know where I'm gonna be.",

        "Katie: Yeah, let's just say he's not too thrilled about Bill being R.J.'s stepfather.",
        "Brooke: Well, he's going to have to get used to it.",
        "Katie: He doesn't trust him.",
        "Brooke: I do.",
        "Katie: He has a problem with that, too.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I'm moving on with my life, just the way that he did with you.",
        "Katie: He doesn't see it that way.",
        "Brooke: Do you?",
        "Katie: Your relationship with Bill is always gonna be hard for me, Brooke. I can't lie about that. It's so complicated, and so much has happened, and I wish that we could solve all the problems between us, but I don't know how to do that. Maybe they can't be solved. Or maybe time...will help us heal.",

        "Michael: Welcome back, Mr. Spencer.",

        "Justin: [Sighs] Hey. Hope I'm not holding you up.",
        "Bill: Cutting it a little close there, aren't you, slick? You're lucky Brooke's not here yet.",
        "Justin: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Did you do what I asked?",
        "Justin: Just like you asked.",

        "Wyatt: He had to meet Brooke at the airport.",
        "Hope: Maybe it is a good thing I have two boyfriends.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, do you need someone to keep you company while your mom's out of town? 'Cause I could be great.",
        "Hope: I would have no idea what's happening in her life if it weren't for the two of you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but, I mean, you know that you could have gotten all the information you needed from just me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, and if information were all she needed from a boyfriend, you'd be so perfect for her.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, well, that's not the only reason why I'm perfect for her, Liam, but, you know, it's really nice to hear you finally admit that I'm perfect for her.",
        "Hope: Why is it that whenever we all get together, I feel like the third wheel?",
        "Wyatt: Have dinner with me.",

        "Hope: I'm busy?",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, our day at the pool could run a little late. Or we could take a cue from my dad and Brooke and do something a little more inspired.",
        "Hope: Like what?",
        "Liam: Like hop on a jet and make it a double wedding.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: He's expecting to hear from you.",

        "Bill: Hey, did you get my package?",
        "R.J.: Yeah. It's cool.",
        "Bill: It's a necklace.",
        "R.J.: Like yours and Liam and Wyatt's.",
        "Bill: Exactly. Now, you know what this means? You're a member of a very exclusive club. There's only four of these things in the world, and you're the youngest to ever get one.",
        "R.J.: Whoa. Uh, thanks.",
        "Bill: Try it on.",
        "R.J.: I'm already wearing it.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Nice! Now, that's no little trinket you're wearing, there, R.J. It's a very expensive piece of jewelry. More important than that, it's a symbol of strength for men like us, and I want you to wear it with pride -- Spencer pride. We're gonna be family soon.",
        "R.J.: I will.",
        "Bill: Attaboy. All right, go back to doing whatever it was you were doing, and I'll see you as soon as we get back.",
        "[Tablet chimes]",
        "Justin: I know what that sword means to you -- sticking it to Ridge.",
        "Bill: That's part of it. But I think R.J. is a great kid, and I'm gonna be his stepfather. I don't want him to feel left out. Ridge doesn't want me involved with his son -- well, that's too bad. Brooke and I are getting married. R.J.'s gonna be living with us, so Ridge is gonna have to learn to accept it and stop having his little hissy fits. And by the way, you're coming with us.",
        "Justin: Really? For what?",
        "Bill: Whatever might come up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I don't want to argue -- Bill is waiting for me.",
        "Ridge: You're running off to get married?",
        "Brooke: I certainly can't do it here -- not after how you acted yesterday.",
        "Ridge: And who's going with you -- Hope and Donna?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: No? Nobody? You're getting married, and your family's not part of it?",
        "Brooke: Bill and I just need to get away. Donna and Katie know where I'm going to be in case there's an emergency.",
        "Ridge: Please stop. Stop.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, this is the way it's going to be. This is our life now.",
        "Ridge: What about our old life? We have a child together. That's never gonna change.",
        "Brooke: When I get back from this trip, I'm gonna be Mrs. Bill Spencer.",
        "Ridge: [Groans]",
        "Brooke: And R.J.'s going to be living with us.",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Brooke: Bill is a good guy. He's very loyal. He's very patient. He's very --",
        "Ridge: You know what he's capable of. You left him because of what he did to Katie. Was he faithful to her? Was he patient when he --",
        "Brooke: He would be the first to admit that he made mistakes with Katie, but he's devoted to me. He loves me.",
        "Ridge: I love you. I will always love you, and I will always want to do what's best for you. I'm not the bad guy in this, and once you realize it, I-I hope it's not too late.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Well, I'm really flattered by the offer, Liam, but I will not be running off and getting married.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, with you, anyway, I think she means.",
        "Hope: No. With anyone.",
        "Liam: Ooh.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so, uh, well, marriage is off the table, but, uh, there hasn't been a verdict on out-of-town trips yet.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I think you've already filled your quota on that one, Wyatt. If Hope's going anywhere, it's with me.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: I have too much work to do, and so do you.",
        "Liam: Hey, man. I'm the boss when my dad's out of town.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, careful. Someone might tell dad that you're slacking again.",
        "Liam: Uh, the guy just ditched work to take the woman he loves halfway around the world. I don't think he would object too strongly to me doing the same with Hope.",
        "Wyatt: All right.",
        "Hope: Okay. Look. Hello?",
        "Liam: Sorry.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] I find what Bill is doing very romantic -- I do -- but I don't want to be whisked away or swept off my feet right now, okay? I want to stay grounded. I want to be able to think about what I want for my future, and you two have been very, very patient. You have. But I am going to make a decision, and just trust that when I do, it will be the best thing for all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: [Exhales deeply]",
        "Katie: Hi. What -- what are you doing back?",
        "Ridge: I ran into Brooke outside.",
        "Katie: Oh. She's going on a trip.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, to marry Bill.",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] She thinks what happened to you won't happen to her.",
        "Katie: Well, maybe she's right. He pursued her pretty relentlessly.",
        "Ridge: She rejected him, and he couldn't accept it.",
        "Katie: Sometimes, accepting things that we don't like can be difficult.",
        "Ridge: You're tired of talking about this, aren't you?",
        "Katie: No. No. Um, I'm glad you can talk to me about it. I would be more concerned if you couldn't. But I am worried about you. I don't like seeing you so stressed out.",
        "Ridge: Well, I don't want that for you.",
        "Katie: I know you're having a really hard time letting this go.",
        "Ridge: My gut won't let me.",
        "Katie: Brooke has to live her own life. She has to make her own choices and her own decisions, and she chooses Bill.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: And I think that we need to live our lives, too, and we need to make our own decisions and our own choices. And maybe we should plan our own wedding -- right here with our family and our friends. What do you think?",
        "Ridge: I think we should do that.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: I'll be in the cockpit if you need anything.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Bill: Oh, at last, the future Mrs. Spencer has arrived.",
        "Brooke: Oh, sorry I'm late. I just got caught up.",
        "Bill: Well, don't worry about it. You're here now. I'm gonna go tell Michael to get this bird in the air.",
        "Brooke: Wait.",
        "Bill: What? What?",
        "Brooke: Wait. Okay. I know this trip was spur-of-the-moment. You know, I just want to -- I want to slow down. I don't want to rush things. I just want to savor every second. [Exhales deeply]",
        "Bill: I think I know what this is about. You want me to open the champagne.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Yes. Yes, actually, I do, but first, I just really want to thank you.",
        "Bill: I haven't done anything yet.",
        "Brooke: This is the happiest I've been in a long time.",
        "Bill: Oh, you're gonna be a lot happier when you see what I have planned.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure you have a lot of things planned, but I'm telling you -- just being with you every single day -- that is a new experience.",
        "Bill: Well, this is going to be a new experience for both of us -- an exotic start to our next big adventure.",
        "Brooke: Yes, for the rest of our lives.",
        "Bill: I can't promise you there's always gonna be camel races.",
        "Brooke: Camel? Did you say \"camel\"? So that's it? We're getting married in the middle of the desert, riding camels to the oasis.",
        "Bill: Um, more like a monorail out to one of the resorts on Palm Island.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Okay, so we're not gonna get married on Palm Island.",
