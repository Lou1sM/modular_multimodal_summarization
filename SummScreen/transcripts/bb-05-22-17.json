{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7590 ~ Maya and Rick embark on a business trip to Paris, and they ask Nicole and Zende for a big favor; Brooke is more than confident in her decision of whom she will spend the rest of her life with."], "Recap": ["Bill and Brooke get ready to take off on their honeymoon in Paris. Maya has a photo shoot so she and Rick tag along. They leave a very happy Nicole and Zende in charge of Lizzy for a few days. Zende tells RJ and Coco he cannot wait to start his own family. Nicole has a doctor's appointment and tells her doctor that she had no problems with her first pregnancy for her sister. She loved being pregnant so she cannot wait to start her own family. The first time she got pregnant right away but now they have been trying for a few months and she just wanted to make sure everything was okay.", "The doctor understands that she has missed a few periods but Nicole is not pregnant. She explains to Nicole that she has a condition with her pelvis. As they discuss it, she tells Nicole that it is not that simple. It can come from various things like contraception or medication but she might not be able to conceive. Nicole says that is unacceptable so do not tell her that. It is crazy. She is healthy and had a perfectly healthy child the first time. She knows it will be that way again. Bill states the obvious and asks Maya if it is a good idea to leave Nicole in charge of watching Lizzy, since she is the birth mother."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: Sparkling water for my wife. Wife.", "Brooke: That would be me.", "[Both chuckle]", "Bill: Finally. Can you believe it? We're here! We did it. We pulled it off.", "Brooke: Yeah, and the way I'm feeling now says it was worth the wait.", "Bill: Well, the way you're feeling now is just a preview. I'm gonna make you the happiest woman on the planet, and keep you that way.", "Brooke: Already done, sweetheart. Mmm. [Giggles]", "Bill: What a perfect day -- started off with our wedding, and ending with our honeymoon in Paris.", "Brooke: Speaking of Paris, Rick and Maya are going there, too. Business for Forrester.", "Bill: Mm-hmm.", "Brooke: So I told them they could hitch a ride.", "Bill: Hitch a ride? Like, with us, on my jet?", "Brooke: Yes, Bill.", "Bill: But this is our honeymoon flight.", "Brooke: Don't worry, honey. We're not gonna waste one more minute of our honeymoon. Rick and Maya aren't here yet.", "Bill: Yeah?", "Brooke: Oh, yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: So, the wedding actually happened?", "Zende: No interruptions. Pronounced husband and wife, huh?", "Maya: Yes.", "Rick: It was touching. I never thought I'd hear myself saying that about a Spencer, but it was nice to see my mom happy.", "Zende: Where's the honeymoon?", "Rick: Paris.", "Maya: We are flying with them.", "Nicole: What?", "Zende: You're going to Paris?", "Rick: Yeah, I have to put out some fires, reassure some clients that we're actually putting a collection together, especially after this whole spectra debacle.", "Maya: Mm-hmm, and I have to do a big Forrester photo shoot, so off we go.", "Nicole: Today?", "Maya: Yeah. Brooke was nice enough to offer us a ride on the Spencer jet, so...", "Nicole: What about Lizzy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I have waited a long time to call you my wife.", "Brooke: You never gave up.", "Bill: On you? I never will. When you stepped into that archway, I -- I'd never seen anything more beautiful. You absolutely took my breath away. You were glowing... I don't know, a serenity.", "Brooke: Because I was sure. No more doubts. No more wasted time. I belong to you, Bill. Forever.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Singer: Built an empire around me what I call my greatest win no one could ever reach me it's just the way it's always been it's lonely at the top with aching, empty needs but now that it's all stopped it's a deal I must concede 'cause holding on was a missing piece and this love we have will never cease it's true It's true I can't take my eyes off you and you can keep me in your destiny cause I just wanna give you the best of me it's true It's true I can never get enough of you", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: No, no, no. Please. Don't worry about it. We understand. Just keep us posted. Okay. Bye.", "Rick: What's going on?", "Maya: Theresa had a family emergency. Yeah, she had to leave town, but she said that she'll be back in a day or two. Maybe we should take Lizzy with us to Paris.", "Rick: Well, sure, we could do that, but I thought we agreed not to. It's such a quick trip, we're gonna be so busy, and you know, this whole schedule, the time zones are gonna be messing with Lizzy.", "Maya: I know, and we finally found a good rhythm.", "Nicole: Uh, hello? I'm right here.", "Maya: Oh, I know, I know, honey, but I don't want to put all that on you. Would you be willing to take care of Lizzy for a few days? We'll get a nanny so that you don't get too overwhelmed.", "Nicole: Yeah, sure. You know how much Zende and I love Lizzy. But who were you thinking of taking care of her, mom and dad?", "Maya: Maybe, but I don't want to put this on them, either. It's a lot to ask.", "Nicole: Oh, well, who, then?", "Rick: We'll figure it out. We got to hurry if we're gonna make the jet on time.", "Nicole: Oh, yeah, don't worry about it. You guys go, Lizzy's in good hands.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Have a safe trip.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Thank you. We so appreciate it. Look, I know you have a lot going on, and we don't expect you to put your lives on hold to take care of our little girl.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: How did you get this beautiful? I'm not even talking about your physical appearance. I mean, that certainly speaks for itself. I'm talking about here. Here. You have this -- this radiance inside, and it just flows out of you. There's this -- I don't know. It's a goodness and a sweetness, this glow that you have. And when you look at me with those beautiful green eyes, and I see the love you have for me, it almost makes me feel like a good person.", "Brooke: [Giggles] You don't need me for that.", "Bill: I need you for everything.", "Brooke: It's so amazing, making love to you as husband and wife.", "Bill: Makes me just want to stay in this bed all the way to Paris. But there's only one problem. Somebody invited a couple of extra passengers.", "Brooke: [Laughs] Oh! That's terrible! I should have thought about that twice, right?", "Bill: Yeah, you should have. [Chuckles] You know what, I'm just teasing you. Rick and Maya are family, and the least that we can do is let them hitch a ride. And, besides, once we land in Paris, we are officially on our honeymoon, and we will have all the alone time we could possibly want.", "Brooke: I can't wait.", "Bill: Me, either.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: So, it, uh, finally happened. My mom married Spencer.", "Nicole: How's Ridge taking it?", "R.J.: Let's just say he's had better days.", "Zende: Yeah, well, you know, your dad just has to understand that at some point, he has to let it go.", "Coco: How's it settling with you?", "R.J.: I'm disappointed. I'm not gonna lie. I just wanted us to be together. But we're still a family, and I want what makes them happy. Where's Rick and Maya?", "Nicole: Jetting off to Paris with Brooke and Bill.", "R.J.: Oh, so that means you're watching Lizzy.", "Nicole: Yeah, just until Maya finds someone. The nanny had a family emergency. Oh, no.", "Zende: What?", "Nicole: The doctor's appointment -- I forgot! I could reschedule.", "Zende: No. I can watch the baby.", "Nicole: Yeah, but you said you were gonna design, no distractions.", "Zende: Listen, I know what I said. I can manage, okay?", "Nicole: But I think you have a shot at the design team and --", "Coco: R.J. And I can help. Look, I -- look, maybe I shouldn't speak for you, but...", "R.J.: Um, yeah, no, I'm -- I'm happy to pitch in.", "Zende: See? We got this.", "R.J.: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: All right. It won't take long. Thanks, guys.", "Zende: You nervous?", "Nicole: A little. But an excited kind of nervous. We'll have the results of my fertility test soon.", "Zende: You sure you don't want me to come?", "Nicole: I'm sure. Now, let me go get this good news, and it'll inspire us to try some more tonight.", "Zende: I don't need any inspiration for that, I got you.", "Nicole: Okay. [Chuckles]", "Zende: Wait a second. Give me some sugar. That that. Good luck. I love you.", "Nicole: I love you, too.", "Zende: All right, girl. Love you!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: [Exhales sharply] The pause that refreshes.", "Brooke: Ahh. I think we should \"pause\" a lot in Paris.", "Bill: Hell, yeah! Assuming we ever get there. Where the hell's Rick and Maya?", "Brooke: Oh, relax! They're gonna be here. We're on our honeymoon. Time means nothing.", "Bill: You know what? You are right. You're right. I'm just gonna -- I'm just gonna chill. Gonna turn over a new leaf. Forget dollar Bill. You're looking at chill Bill. Huh?", "Brooke: I'm gonna remind you that you said that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Hey. I'm sorry we took so long.", "Bill: It's about time! Where were you guys -- uh, I mean, what is time? Time -- time means nothing.", "Rick: Yeah. Until it means money.", "Bill: Spoken like a true businessman. I like that.", "Rick: Thanks for letting us hitch a ride, Dad.", "[Laughter]", "Maya: I am sure you would have much rather been alone.", "Bill: Well -- no. No. Not at all. We're happy to have you. And I have a fully stocked bar. So, son, let me buy you a drink.", "Rick: Don't mind if I do. Give me that good stuff.", "Bill: Here it is!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: So, Theresa's all set up with Lizzy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: No, actually. She had a family emergency, and she said she'll be back today or tomorrow, so Nicole and Zende are watching Lizzy right now, but you know, I -- I think I'm gonna find someone else to do it. Rick and I don't want to impose on their lives any more than we already have.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: So, here we are.", "Dr. Caspary: How are you feeling?", "Nicole: Great. Marriage agrees with me.", "Dr. Caspary: It certainly does. You're radiant.", "Nicole: Oh, you think this is something? You should see me when I'm pregnant. My body was so happy, which is another reason why I want to do it again. I want the whole experience from conception to birth. And, this time, it'll be our baby. Zende will be with me every step of the way. Oh, I should mention that I'm still late. I took a pregnancy test because Zende and I thought it might be something, but it was negative, which kind of threw me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Aww.", "Brooke: Mm, somebody's missing their baby girl.", "Maya: It shows?", "Rick: No! Just the part where you've been looking at pictures of Lizzy since we took off.", "Maya: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: You know, even I have to admit -- babies, they are lethal, the way they grab onto your heart and don't let go. When will was Lizzy's age, I was just a fool for that kid.", "Brooke: You still are.", "Bill: You know what, you're right, I am.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laughter]", "Rick: Oh, I love that one. Her smile's as big as the universe. You know, that's you in Lizzy. That's your smile. You think she misses us?", "Rick: Yeah!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Don't worry. She'll be fine. She's in good hands.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: She's so beautiful.", "Zende: I can't wait to have my own.", "R.J.: For me, it's just such a long ways away.", "Coco: Me, too.", "Zende: Yeah, I used to be the same way. Until I met Nicole, and everything changed. Oh, are you okay, baby?", "R.J.: [Laughs]", "Zende: Everything changed, and then, you know, I just feel like now I can't wait to have a family. I want to have one as soon as possible.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: You know how a lot of women are miserable during their pregnancies? Well, of course you do. That's your job. [Laughs] But that didn't happen for me. I mean, yes, I had morning sickness, but after that, I felt amazing. I mean, I had tons of energy. And I really just couldn't get over the fact that there was a baby growing inside of me. I must have cradled my stomach non-stop for six months. You know, it just kept changing. Getting bigger, lots of movement. I loved being pregnant.", "Dr. Caspary: It's a transformative experience.", "Nicole: Yes. That's the word. And then Lizzy started coming. And I was afraid at first, but... it was more beautiful than anything else. I'll never forget laying eyes on her for the first time.", "Dr. Caspary: Was it difficult, giving her up?", "Nicole: Well, I had Lizzy for my sister and her husband. Lizzy was always their child.", "Dr. Caspary: And now, naturally, you want one of your own?", "Nicole: Very much. Zende and I have been trying since we got married. A lot. The first time I got pregnant right away with Lizzy. And it's been a couple of months, but so far, nothing. And I know every pregnancy's different, but we do want to get started on our family.", "Dr. Caspary: Well, taking the fertility test was a good idea.", "Nicole: Well, I just wanted to make sure I had all of my bases covered, everything's checking out, and I'm good with it taking time. Zende and I have our whole lives ahead of us. We can keep trying, no problem.", "Dr. Caspary: You said you haven't had a period since you were in last.", "Nicole: No.", "Dr. Caspary: So you've missed a few, then.", "Nicole: Yeah, but I've been working out a lot, and as happy as I am, work has been stressful. Oh, and, um, I guess I should mention that I have been experiencing a little pain, but...", "Dr. Caspary: Where? Your pelvis.", "Nicole: Why'd you say it like that?", "Dr. Caspary: It helps to pinpoint what's going on. Nicole, you have a condition called amenorrhea.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laughter]", "Coco: She is such a good baby. And you're so sweet with her.", "Zende: Hey, don't go telling people, now, ruining my rep out here.", "R.J.: Your rep?", "Coco: Oh!", "R.J.: Dude, your rep is a very nice guy who's really into Nicole.", "[Laughter]", "Zende: I'll take it.", "Coco: Hey, you probably won't care about this because you're happily off the market, right?", "R.J.: Uh-huh.", "Coco: But women like men who are good with babies.", "R.J.: Yeah?", "Coco: Yeah.", "R.J.: Oh, well, then hand me that kid.", "Zende: She is something special.", "Coco: You're gonna be an amazing dad, Zende.", "Zende: I hope so. I cannot wait till the day Nicole tells me she's pregnant. We are so ready.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: My granddaughter is so photogenic! [Gasps] Does Lizzy ever take a bad photo?", "Maya: Oh, it feels so weird being without her.", "Brooke: Oh, I'm sure it does. You have been without her for any length of time, now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Zende and Nicole will take really great care of her till we get back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: You sure that's a good idea? Your sister watching the kid?", "Maya: Why?", "Bill: The birth mother.", "Maya: Yes.", "Bill: Are you sure that's a good idea?", "Maya: Yeah, of course. Nicole loves Lizzy like she's her own.", "Bill: Well, Lizzy is Nicole's own. What? I'm just stating the obvious.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: That's my husband's unorthodox way of showing his concern.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Well, it's unwarranted. Nicole loves being Lizzy's aunt.", "Rick: Yeah, she's one in a million.", "Maya: And she will make an incredible mother one day. I think it'll be soon.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I'm sorry, you said I have...?", "Dr. Caspary: Amenorrhea, an abnormal absence of menstruation. You've missed a few periods, but there's no pregnancy. You've experience pelvic pain. Those are all symptoms.", "Nicole: Okay, so, what does this mean? What causes it?", "Dr. Caspary: Any number of things. Menopause, contraceptives, certain medications. In your case, it stems from your pregnancy.", "Nicole: Oh, okay. My pregnancy made me irregular. So what can I do to get back on track? Is there something I can take?", "Dr. Caspary: It's not that simple, Nicole. You have uterine scarring, also from your pregnancy, making it difficult for the egg to be picked up by the fallopian tubes and decreasing your chances of becoming pregnant.", "Nicole: What?", "Dr. Caspary: You might have a condition called secondary infertility.", "Nicole: Infertility? But that doesn't make any sense. I can have a baby. I had a baby.", "Dr. Caspary: Yes, but you may not be able to conceive again. Because of the scarring, there's a chance that you can't become pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term. Sometimes this happens after childbirth.", "Nicole: Can't conceive... like, ever? No. That's unacceptable. Zende and I are going to have a family. That's the plan. I had one baby. I can have another, and another after that. So don't tell me that it can't happen.", "Dr. Caspary: I know this is a lot for you to absorb.", "Nicole: It's crazy! I'm young. I'm healthy. I had Lizzy. She's healthy. No! There's nothing wrong with me. I can have another child. We will treat this...condition. It won't stop us from having our family. It can't."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s14EWVRm-fk"}
