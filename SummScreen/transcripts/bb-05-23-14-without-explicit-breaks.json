        "Bill and Brooke are on the jet and she can't wait to see what else he has planned for them. And he can not wait to get married. Donna and Hope discuss another Brooke wedding and they are missing it. Hope does understand though why they would want to elope. They wonder if Ridge knows. He walks in and says yes he knows that her mother is about to make the biggest mistake of her life. Both wonder why if he has moved on with Katie does he care that her mom is marrying Bill. He assures them he will always care for Brooke and her well being as well as his son. Donna reminds him that Brooke said RJ took the news well. Ridge says that is different. Katie is a positive influence in his son's life; Spencer is not. Hope admits that she doesn't really care for Bill either but you can't deny how loyal he is to her mother. Ridge says yes but he almost ruined Katie's life and given time he will do the same to Brooke. There has to be a way to stop this. Wyatt breaks the news to his mother that Bill is flying to Dubai to marry Brooke. Quinn says his dad sure moves fast. But to Brooke Logan, wonder if he thinks that will last. Look at her track record \u0096 Ridge, Thorne, Eric and Hope's jailbird dad, the list goes on. She is just going to end up embarrassing Wyatt's father. Wyatt wonders if she is worried about only Bill or she and his dad. Quinn scoffs that please, Brooke will have moved on by end of summer and moved on to her next victim. Bill will be humiliated. They have to stop this wedding. Wyatt says it is sort of out of their hands. There is no way to stop a wedding. He looks at her and hopes that she is not going to do something. He points out that Brooke is one of their bosses and Hope's mother. She says his father is walking into a trap. Wyatt thinks he will be fine; he's a big boy. Quinn agrees but she thinks he deserves better. Wyatt wonders if she means herself. She gloats that she is an independent woman and doesn't need anyone or anything. Wyatt says except for his dad. But if she wanted him then she should have dropped her guard and told him what she wanted. She laughs and says talking is not what she and Bill do best. He covers his ears and says he doesn't want to hear this. She says but if she has the power to stop him from making a mistake, the she probably should. She's a woman; she has powers. The list is endless. It would save Brooke the scandal of another failed marriage and his dad of his tiny broken heart. She acknowledges that it is tiny and undoubtedly cold but in there someplace. Wyatt says and it belongs to Brooke. Quinn smiles and says Brooke would like to think that but he can't be tamed. He can't be owned. Wyatt says he is being serious. It sounds like she has some ammunition and he is afraid she will use it. She says he knows her; her finger is always on the trigger. He says okay fine; just tell him if he should be worried. She cops out by saying they are late for a meeting with Ridge.",
        "Bill tells Brooke they are almost ready to land but he's still keeping his secret of where they are going to get married. But he will promise her this; it will be incredibly unique and beautiful, befitting his princess. They discuss the beautiful architecture, the turquoise water and beaches and places they can take a sunset stroll on the Gulf ..or a camel ride or go camping in the middle of the desert. He doesn't think they will want to do that. The hotel is one of the most luxurious. He points out the tallest building in the world with 163 floors. They are welcomed to Atlantis Palm. Donna tells Ridge that Bill and Brooke are going to get married and she doesn't think there is anything anyone can do about it. Ridge says she is right. So they just need to hope Brooke will come to her senses before that. Wyatt and Quinn come in with their wares. Ridge seems to be in a rush and wants to see what they have. He looks at it critically and asks if this is for the couture line; it seems a little chunky and dated. He thought they talked about elegant and polished. Hope says they are very on trend. Ridge grouses that he asked for elegance. He thinks Quinn can do better. He says he is disappointed in both of them. Quinn apologizes for being so far off base but she can make him more prototypes. He snaps that she will have to do something if she wants to continue to work here. Hope steps in and says he has given Quinn some valid points but she is sure Quinn won't mind redesigning something else. It's been a highly stressful day so maybe this is not the best time for a meeting. Ridge sighs and says she is right. It doesn't take a genius to know he isn't thrilled about this wedding. He tells Wyatt he's a good kid but his dad is not good enough for Brooke or to be around his son. Wyatt is sorry he feels that way. Ridge's tablet chimes and he says that is his son now so meeting is over. They talk a minute about school and then Ridge notices something around RJ's neck. He says is was a gift from Mr. Spencer. And now he is part of a club since there are only four in the world like this. And he's marrying his mom so they will be family. And he should wear it with pride; Spencer pride. Ridge seethes quietly and tells RJ he better get back to his studies. He loves him and will talk to him tomorrow. Wyatt tells Quinn that was interesting. Ridge didn't like her designs and now she will have to work another 100 hours to get it perfect for him. She says she is not worried about the collection. She can fix that in a New York minute, but just take a look on Ridge's face when talking about Bill and Brooke. Wyatt says news flash, they already knew that Ridge hated Bill. She says yes but for a man who has moved on he seems awfully invested in Brooke's happiness. Wyatt says they have been together for a long time so naturally he is protective. She says maybe it is more than that. Wonder what he would say if he found out about her and Bill. Wyatt tells her not to even go there. It would just be her word against Bill's and he would deny, deny, deny. She holds up her selfie and says Bill can deny all he wants but the cameras don't. Brooke says she loves Dubai!"

        "Brooke: We've been on the plane for hours. But somehow, it feels like only minutes.",
        "Bill: Well, time flies when you're in love, huh?",
        "Brooke: It certainly does. I can't wait to see what you have planned for us.",
        "Bill: And I can't wait to marry you.",

        "Hope: It's so romantic.",
        "Donna: Mm. An exciting beginning to what I hope is a very smooth ride.",
        "Hope: Yeah, you and me both. Do you think Ridge knows?",
        "Ridge: Ridge knows what? That your mother's about to make the biggest mistake of her life? Yes, he's aware of that.",
        "Quinn: What's the bad news?",
        "Wyatt: Well, uh, dad's on his way to Dubai.",
        "Quinn: Okay. For what, a business meeting?",
        "Wyatt: No. A wedding. He's marrying Brooke.",
        "Quinn: Wow, your father moves fast, doesn't he?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. You know him. When he gets his mind set on something...",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but Brooke Logan? Does he really think that's gonna last?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, apparently.",
        "Quinn: Look at her track record. Ridge, Thorne, Eric, hope's jailbird dad. I mean, the list goes on and on. Brooke's just gonna end up embarrassing your father.",
        "Wyatt: Are you worried about dad, or are you worried about you and dad?",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Please. Brooke's gonna be done with him by the end of the summer and move on to her next victim. Bill is going to be humiliated. We have to stop the wedding.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I think it's out of our hands, mom. It's not like there's anything we can do to stop the wedding.",
        "Hope: Why are you so against Bill marrying my mom?",
        "Donna: You've moved on. You're engaged to Katie.",
        "Ridge: That doesn't mean I stopped caring about Brooke or her well-being. Or my son's well-being.",
        "Donna: Brooke said that R.J. Took the news about you and Katie quite well.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's very different. Katie is a positive influence in my son's life. Spencer is not.",
        "Hope: I'll admit that I don't really care for Bill either, um, for good reason, but you -- you can't deny how loyal he's been to mom.",
        "Ridge: Mm. What about what he did to your aunt? What about that? What about what he did to your sister? You okay with that?",
        "Donna: Of course not, but that's different.",
        "Ridge: He almost destroyed her life. And you give him enough time, he's gonna do the same to Brooke. There's got to be a way to stop this.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, you're not planning on doing something, are you, mom? I-I mean, Brooke is one of our bosses, and more importantly, she's hope's mother.",
        "Quinn: And they couldn't be any different. I mean, hope has class and self- respect, and Brooke is just -- she's --",
        "Wyatt: Okay, okay. All right. You're obviously not a fan of hers. You've made that very clear.",
        "Quinn: Your father is walking into a trap.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I think he'll be fine. He's a big boy.",
        "Quinn: I didn't say he couldn't handle it, but he does deserve better.",
        "Wyatt: Someone like you?",
        "Quinn: I am an independent woman and I don't need anyone or anything.",
        "Wyatt: Except dad. Look, if you really have feelings for him, then you should have dropped your guard for once and told him what you wanted.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Wyatt, you're making assumptions. Besides, talking is not what your father and I do best.",
        "Wyatt: All right, I don't -- I don't want to hear that.",
        "Quinn: And you think I want something more from Bill. But we had our fun. We made you.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Quinn: But if I have the power to stop him from making a big mistake, why shouldn't I use it?",
        "Bill: Well, not long, we're gonna be landing in Dubai.",
        "Brooke: Can't think of a more magnificent place to get married.",
        "Bill: You are still trying to trick me into telling you where the wedding's taking place, aren't you?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Okay, well, just tell me this much -- am I warm?",
        "Bill: No, you're not warm. You're hot. And, lucky me, you're about to become my bride.",
        "Brooke: In Abu Dhabi? We're going there, too.",
        "Bill: Uh, well, Abu Dhabi is the second stop on our journey. Now, we could be married by then. Of course, we might not. It's a surprise, and you're going to have to wait. But I will promise you this -- it's going to be incredibly unique and beautiful, befitting my princess.",
        "Brooke: Our very own royal wedding.",
        "Wyatt: What are you talking about? What power do you have over dad?",
        "Quinn: I'm a woman, Wyatt. The list is endless.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Right. I know that. But I meant specifically. I mean, you make it sound like you -- you could stop him from marrying Brooke if you wanted to.",
        "Quinn: Well, I think it would be the best thing for everyone, don't you?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Why?",
        "Quinn: To save Brooke the scandal of yet another failed marriage. To save your father from having his tiny little heart broken.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, so you are acknowledging that he actually does have a heart.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I acknowledge that it's tiny and, undoubtedly, cold, and I'm sure that it is in there.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, yeah. And it belongs to Brooke.",
        "Quinn: Your father can't be owned. I'm sure Brooke would like that, but he's impossible to tame.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Mom, I'm being serious here, okay?",
        "Quinn: So am I.",
        "Wyatt: No! What are you up to, all right? It sounds like you've got some sort of ammunition, and I am really afraid that you might use it.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You know me, Wyatt. My finger is always on the trigger.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my god. Mom, you are being so vague right now. Okay, fine. Fine. Just tell me if I should be worried, okay? It's not like you haven't pulled some sketchy stuff in the past.",
        "Quinn: You know what? I think we are late for our meeting with Ridge.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no. Mom, no. I'm talking to you, okay? No, right --",
        "Quinn: Go cover that tray. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Wyatt: Ugh!",
        "Quinn: Let's do it.",
        "Bill: All right, Michael said we're gonna be on the ground soon.",
        "Brooke: Wonderful. You know, I am learning so much about our destination.",
        "Bill: Well, not too much, I hope. I want it to be a surprise.",
        "Brooke: The architecture is amazing. And who knew there were so many beautiful beaches there?",
        "Bill: Oh, miles and miles of turquoise water, white-sand beaches. Jet skiing, sky diving, shopping, snorkeling, weddings, people getting married, you know. You name it, Dubai has it.",
        "Brooke: We really have to take a sunset stroll on the gulf.",
        "Bill: Or a camel ride.",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: We could even go camping in the middle of the desert.",
        "Bill: Well, you might not want to do that once you see the hotel. It is one of the most luxurious in the world.",
        "Brooke: Oh, you really do spoil me. You know, there's this desert safari that takes you out to Tel Moreeb, which is this huge sand dune that they say is one of the biggest in the world. It's like 300 meters.",
        "Bill: Yeah, and you can ski straight down it.",
        "Brooke: Ski? Oh, my gosh. That'd be fun. Kind of scary, too.",
        "Bill: [Laughs]",
        "Brooke: And there's an Arabian-wildlife animal park. Look! How exotic.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Maybe that's where we're getting married.",
        "Bill: You, me, and a bunch of wild animals. [Purrs]",
        "Brooke: Well, it certainly would be memorable.",
        "Bill: This entire trip is going to be so memorable.",
        "Brooke: [Giggles]",
        "Donna: Bill and Brooke are getting married, Ridge. I-I don't think there's anything anyone can do about it.",
        "Ridge: Well, you're right. So let's just hope she comes to her senses before it's too late.",
        "Hope: I don't really see what's gonna change her mind at this point.",
        "Ridge: Where are Quinn and Wyatt? They're supposed to be here now.",
        "Donna: I'm sure they're on their way.",
        "Hope: I, uh -- I saw some of Quinn's preliminary designs. I think you'll be pleased. Hey.",
        "Quinn: Hi.",
        "Wyatt: Hey. Uh... sorry we're late.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. Where were you? We've been waiting.",
        "Quinn: Um, I apologize. We lost track of time.",
        "Ridge: Let's get started.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, just the five of us?",
        "Donna: Uh, yeah. Rick and Caroline are stuck in a meeting.",
        "Hope: Yeah, and my mom is... [Chuckling] Halfway around the world, so...",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Quite a trip.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, if you're gonna get married, you might as well go big.",
        "Hope: And far.",
        "Wyatt: Right? There's no turning back for dad and Brooke after a flight like that.",
        "Quinn: It's not that far.",
        "Wyatt: Well, it is a hike. I mean, that jet lag can be brutal.",
        "Ridge: All right. That's enough. What do you have for me?",
        "Quinn: Um, here. Voil\u00e0!",
        "Ridge: So... this is for the couture line?",
        "Wyatt: It is. Yeah. Why? Is -- do -- do you not like the collection?",
        "Ridge: Well, it's, uh... clunky and dated. I thought we talked about it being graceful and polished.",
        "Hope: Well, Ridge, these pieces are very on-trend.",
        "Ridge: What I asked for was elegance. You can do better, Quinn. And you know what? I'm disappointed in both of you.",
        "Quinn: Um...I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I was so off-base. Uh, I was trying something different, but, uh, I can make you some more prototypes.",
        "Ridge: Well, you're gonna have to come up with something if you want to keep working here.",
        "Hope: Okay. Um... Ridge, you've -- you've given some very valid points, but I'm sure that Quinn really has no problem reworking her designs. You know what? This has been a very...unusually stressful day for everyone, so maybe we shouldn't be having this meeting right now.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I'm sorry. Maybe you're right. It, uh, doesn't take a genius to figure out I'm not...well, thrilled about this wedding. And, uh, I know you're a good kid. I'm -- [Sighs] But your father isn't good enough for Brooke, and he's not good enough to be around my son.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I am sorry you feel that way.",
        "[Tablet chimes]",
        "Ridge: Oh, that's my son now. Excuse me.",
        "Hope: Okay. Let's reconvene.",
        "Donna: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Hey, son.",
        "R.J.: Hi, dad.",
        "Ridge: How was school today?",
        "R.J.: Good. I got an \"a\" on my math quiz.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles] That's my boy.",
        "R.J.: It was pretty easy.",
        "Ridge: Easy is good. Easy -- easy is real good. What -- what is that around your neck?",
        "R.J.: My new sword necklace. Mr. Spencer gave it to me.",
        "[Helicopter blades whirring]",
        "Brooke: Dubai. [Sighs] To think that this was once a tiny desert outpost.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Now it's the home of the burj khalifa. That's the tallest building in the world -- 163 floors plus.",
        "Brooke: It's gorgeous. Wow.",
        "Bill: I'm glad you like it. It's your wedding present.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Really? That's my wedding present? The tallest building in the world?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: That's just what I wanted.",
        "Bill: Yeah, look -- see, it -- oh, wait a minute. I-I told Justin to tie a bow around the top of it. You know, he's slacking off. Remind me to fire him, will you?",

        "Brooke: Gorgeous. [Chuckles] [Engine shuts off] Hello. Thank you.",
        "Bill: Thank you. Wonderful to be here.",
        "Brooke: Very nice to be here. This is great. How was the ride?",

        "Brooke: Wow.",
        "Bill: Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet.",
        "Wyatt: Well, that was interesting.",
        "Quinn: Did you see his face? Ridge was really upset.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, he really didn't like the jewelry, but I-I guess you'll have to rework it and tone it done, but that's okay! Because that's just -- that's only another hundred hours of work to do.",
        "Quinn: Oh, no, I'm not talking about the collection. I can fix that in a new York minute. I'm talking about Brooke and Bill.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, right. News flash -- Ridge can't stand dad. We already knew that.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. But for a man who's moved on, proposed to Katie Logan, he seems awfully invested in Brooke's happiness.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, they were together forever. I mean, it's obvious he's gonna be protective.",
        "Quinn: Maybe it's more than that.",
        "Wyatt: No. Maybe it's not.",
        "Quinn: I wonder what he would say if he found out about me and your father.",
        "Wyatt: What?! Mom, seriously?! No. Don't. Don't even go there.",
        "Quinn: Why not?",
        "Wyatt: Because it'll be your word against his, and he'll just deny, deny, deny.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Your father can deny all he wants... but the camera doesn't lie. Good afternoon.",
        "Bill: Good afternoon. Warm towel for you?",

        "R.J.: Pretty cool, huh? He said I'm part of the club now.",
        "Ridge: What club is that?",
        "R.J.: Dad, there are only four of these in the whole world. Mr. Spencer has one, Liam, and Wyatt, and now me. He said it's worth a lot of money.",
        "Ridge: I bet he did.",
