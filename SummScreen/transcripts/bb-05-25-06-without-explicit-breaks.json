        "Dante: Felicia's just posing for me.",
        "Felicia: Second choice is what I do best.",
        "Bridget: I just didn't realize that --",
        "Felicia: Oh, well, when an italian asks you to pose for him, you just figure your clothes are coming off. Why, did you change your mind? Because I think we've actually got a pretty good start here.",
        "Bridget: At what?",
        "Felicia: Oh, you mean, you want to know if he got to first base?",
        "Bridget: No. It just feels like there's something personal going on.",
        "Felicia: Why do you think he asked you to pose?",
        "Dante: Felicia --",
        "Felicia: What? You adore her. Since when is that a secret? But she's made it clear that she is not emotionally available. What? If I've got it wrong, say so.",
        "Jackie: So, what has brooke decided to do?",
        "Nick: If anybody deserves to run that company, she does. That really was the point anyway.",
        "Jackie: A big fat bribe to push her in ridge's direction, that's what it is.",
        "Nick: Mother, I am not afraid of losing her.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jackie: I know that. Just a minute. Hello?",
        "Stephen: Hey, hi. It's good to hear your voice. Listen, I know we talked about a late dinner tonight, but would you mind terribly if we postponed? I've gotten involved in something. A friend who really needs some company.",
        "Jackie: Actually, you've saved me a phone call. I'm with nicky -- in his office in much the same situation.",
        "Stephen: Okay, well -- I'll make it up to you, I promise. And by the way, tell nicky that I said things are looking up.",
        "Jackie: Will he know what that means?",
        "[Stephen chuckles]",
        "Stephen: I think -- listen, I've got to go. I got to run. Talk to you later. Bye.",
        "Taylor: Our table's ready.",
        "Stephen: Oh, I love a woman with clout.",
        "Taylor: Even if it's only 2%? Sorry. I really can't remember when the last time was anybody invited me to dinner. So, I may not be very good company.",
        "Stephen: Well, I happen to think that you can do something for my lousy mood that nobody else can do.",
        "Stephanie: Is that a reporter? How did they get the number?",
        "Ridge: Mother, I'm calling out.",
        "Stephanie: Oh.",
        "Ridge: Cookies and milk?",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it's one of those mommy things you do. Besides, you're not supposed to have scotch before bedtime. Was she home?",
        "Ridge: I left another message.",
        "Stephanie: She needs time. Nick isn't going to let go so easily.",
        "Ridge: Or maybe she just doesn't want me back.",
        "Stephen: I don't recognize any of the california labels anymore. I do know a little about the french bordeauxs, though.",
        "Taylor: Oh, none for me, thank you. Ridge always liked -- I don't really know what ridge ever really liked to tell you the truth. Apart from your daughter.",
        "Stephen: Taylor --",
        "Taylor: I told you this would be a bad idea.",
        "Stephen: Why? Because it hurts to have stephanie forrester tip you like you were a bellhop and it shows?",
        "Taylor: Well, she claims she was just trying to let me know I'm one of the family.",
        "Stephen: Then why didn't she support your marriage?",
        "Taylor: Oh, she did plenty of that. Because it wasn't really my marriage, it was really hers. But now she's betting on another horse. She's deathly afraid if she doesn't help ridge get brooke back, he'll never forgive her.",
        "Stephen: Well, ridge getting brooke back is what I'm deathly afraid of.",
        "Taylor: I don't blame brooke for any of this.",
        "Stephen: I know that -- I know. You were just chewed up and spit out by the forrester machinery, like so many of us before you. Taylor, what would you say if I were to tell you there is a way for you and my daughter to get what you want? For all of us to get back our own and be finally be rid of that greedy bunch?",
        "Dante: Look, this is about a piece I need to complete by a certain deadline, that's all, okay?",
        "[Bridget sighs]",
        "Bridget: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I really didn't mean to butt in, I --",
        "Felicia: No, that's what it used to be about. I need some clarity here.",
        "Bridget: Clarity about what?",
        "Felicia: Does it bother you that I'm posing for dante?",
        "[Bridget sighs]",
        "Bridget: Well, like that, felicia --",
        "Felicia: Does it make a difference?",
        "Bridget: Is it just posing?",
        "Felicia: What if we haven't decided?",
        "Bridget: Then yes, felicia, it would probably bother me.",
        "Felicia: Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Why?",
        "Bridget: Because. Because.",
        "Felicia: Is dante free or isn't he?",
        "Bridget: Well, of course he's free, felicia --",
        "Felicia: Just not to be around a naked women who think he's kind of hot.",
        "Bridget: He can do whatever he wants.",
        "Dante: Maybe I need some clarity, too.",
        "Felicia: Oh, no, I think we're pretty clear on you. You're crazy in love with bridget, and you have a child with me.",
        "Dante: But bridget is helping us raise him.",
        "Felicia: Because you and I never had a shot.",
        "Bridget: Okay, you know what, felicia if you're gonna make me an obstacle -- I've been there and done that and I'm not doing it again. I'm just --",
        "Felicia: No, no, no, no, you are my precious, wonderful sister and I love you --",
        "Bridget: Right, right.",
        "Felicia: And I wouldn't hurt you for anything in this world. And if I am, I'll stop.",
        "Bridget: We just have a certain relationship.",
        "Felicia: How certain is it? I can never tell.",
        "Bridget: I don't know. We had begun to think that someday, maybe --",
        "Felicia: Oh, I'm pretty sure he'd be ready in five seconds flat.",
        "Bridget: That maybe I have decided that someday I'll have a different kind of connection with him. Which is why I'm gonna move out.",
        "Felicia: You want to see if moving out brings you closer? Can I tell you how much sense that makes to me?",
        "Bridget: Well, can I tell you how different our views are on sex? I already knew that.",
        "Felicia: Okay, so, what's he supposed to do in the meantime? Be celibate?",
        "Bridget: That would be up to him.",
        "Felicia: Okay. And what is he waiting for?",
        "Bridget: You mean, why wait, when the express line is open?",
        "Felicia: Oh, no. No reason to get nasty. You're right but, no. What I mean is, what is he waiting to have happen? You guys are so close. You've been so close for a long time and you're practically inseparable now. What new ingredient are we thinking is gonna come along to change this friendship into something else?",
        "Dante: I've been waiting for it a long time.",
        "Felicia: And we know what it is, don't we? So, let's make a mental note in our notebooks, right now, okay? This is what I'm really good for. I'm willing to say what everybody else is thinking and they just can't spit it out. Bridget, he's waiting for you to get over nick. And that's not gonna happen when it looks like nick and brooke might split up and he could wind up at your door.",
        "Stephanie: She came back from mexico for you, didn't she? I mean she heard that you needed her and she didn't hesitate.",
        "Ridge: Well, that doesn't mean she'll want to be my wife though.",
        "Stephanie: Honey -- look, I think she's a little afraid. I mean, you waffled for years and how many times did I drive her away? She needs something concrete, which is why I gave her half the company. I hope -- I think she will now accept the idea that I will accept her as your wife. [Stephanie sighs] I hope she does because I haven't left myself very many outs.",
        "Stephen: Thank you.",
        "Taylor: You know what I should do? I should just rip those stock certificates into a million pieces.",
        "Stephen: The hell you should. The hell you should. You have been the dutiful mother, the long-suffering wife and where did that loyalty get you? Where's the family feeling? I certainly hope you don't expect to receive a forrester christmas card this year. You don't have the ice-cold forrester blood in your veins and that made you disposable. And this has breathed enough for me. And my daughter is no better off. Stephanie is gonna cut her loose as soon as she's scored enough points for ridge. And I can't let that happen. And it doesn't have to. Taylor, I -- I want to be completely open and honest with you. So I have a confession. I knew about your 2% when I came to see you tonight. I saw you were with stephanie and I just waited for her to leave.",
        "Taylor: Why?",
        "Stephen: Because I felt if she saw me there, she might realize that she has placed her own undoing right in our hands. Taylor, you have 2% of the company, brooke has 50% of the company. Separately, that leaves you both under the forrester thumb. But do you know what you have if you're together?",
        "Taylor: Control of forrester creations.",
        "Ridge: You fought like a tiger to take the company from dad.",
        "Stephanie: I always fight like a tiger. Sometimes I surprise myself. Sometimes I just wear myself out.",
        "Ridge: Oh, that I have yet to see.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, well, believe me, this old body gets tired.",
        "Ridge: This time you wore yourself out for me though -- fighting for me. For what I want, not what you want.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, I'm like everybody else in this world, if I could just go back and change --",
        "Ridge: Mother, I'm trying to thank you.",
        "Stephanie: Oh.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Stephanie: Oh.",
        "Taylor: I don't think you understand what you're asking me to do.",
        "Stephen: I'm not asking. I'm just pointing out possibilities.",
        "Taylor: Brooke and me joining forces so that we can give the forresters the boot?",
        "Stephen: It can be that easy.",
        "Taylor: It just don't even know if it's possible. What did brooke say?",
        "Stephen: I told you, I didn't -- would you stop doing that.",
        "Taylor: What?",
        "Stephen: Staring into your glass. Like it's a ten-story building and you're about to jump. All right, I will ask you something and what I'm asking for is for you to reconnect with who you really are. I remember you, taylor. Do you? Believe me, I understand this darkness you're living in. It can consume you if you let it. You're freefalling, taylor and i think you know that.",
        "Taylor: How do I stop?",
        "Stephen: Grab something. Want something. Want what is rightfully yours.",
        "Bridget: Like mother, like daughter. I don't know why you're charging into something that's just none of your business?",
        "Felicia: I'm not. Dante and I have son together.",
        "Bridget: Well, per your request, I thought that dino was my son, too.",
        "Felicia: He is. I know how much you adore him, okay? And I am painfully aware of the mess I made of your life by drafting you into motherhood because I thought I was checking out. I don't know how you can even look at me, really.",
        "Bridget: Oh, felicia, stop it. You know how much I love you. You're my sister.",
        "Felicia: I do. I do and that makes this whole thing even worse! I know what you did to make a family for my son. You might have even lost your marriage over it and you don't even hate me. You know, if I live to be 150, i don't think I can ever pay you back for that. And I would rather cut myself open and give back my liver than take one other single thing from you. But here we are -- you, me and this beautiful man over here. The cards have been dealt. So, what do we do next, huh? I mean, am I wrong to think that if you and dante were gonna happen, it would have happened by now?",
        "Bridget: No.",
        "Felicia: So, would it be so terrible if I took a crack at him? What if -- what if dino could be raised by his actual mom and dad? Wouldn't that be a kick in the pants? And bridget, if you and nick aren't done -- done done, then what are you free to offer him? You know the other good thing about me? When I've said what I need to say, I'm done. I'm out of here. I'm going home.",
        "Bridget: Are you two finished?",
        "Felicia: For tonight, oh yeah. And forever, if that's the way you want it. You two hash it out. And if you don't want me posing for dante, that'll be that. Just somebody let me know, at some point? I might want to get a tattoo.",
        "[Bridget sighs]",
        "Bridget: You know, she's wrong about one thing -- I really hate her sometimes. Because she can be just so incredibly right.",
        "Dante: You know the conversation we never had? Well, I guess we just had it. I feel like she ought to send me a bill.",
        "Bridget: I don't you open anything in the mail that she sends you -- not in front of dino. You're really interested in her, aren't you?",
        "Dante: Yeah. Should I not be? That's not the right question, is it?",
        "Bridget: I had to figure that your days of living like a monk are numbered.",
        "Dante: I'm not as good with words as she is.",
        "Bridget: No, that's not true, you are. You -- you just never would use them to hurt me, even when I totally deserved it.",
        "Dante: No, you deserve the best. From me. From life. From everything. And I wanted to be that for you. You know, I laid my cards on the table -- right from the beginning. Didn't I?",
        "Bridget: Yeah, you did. I know.",
        "Dante: Bridget, right now, right this minute, if you ask me to wait, I'll wait.",
        "Bridget: I've done that too many times though I -- I mean, don't you think if we were meant to happen we would've happened?",
        "Dante: Okay.",
        "Bridget: I wonder if we'll ever find out why it didn't work.",
        "Taylor: No -- what you're telling me would be very, very tempting -- if I were into revenge. Which I'm not.",
        "Stephen: Well, I'm sorry. Did you call it something else when stephanie grabbed the business from eric?",
        "Taylor: Oh, that experience taught me to have very little affinity for the fashion business. And I seriously doubt that would change if it were going back to it as brooke's lesser partner.",
        "Stephen: Forget about revenge. This is justice. We all gave a portion of our lives for that family. Wouldn't it be nice to have something to show for it, other than just making them richer? Taylor, I honestly believe that we're smarter than they are. That we're better people. That we could take forrester creations and make a difference. And not just in our own lives -- in the world.",
        "Taylor: I remember thinking like that once.",
        "Stephen: Don't -- don't chalk up what they did to you to experience. You don't have to excuse the inexcusable. You've got the power. You've got the power right in your hands, right now. All you have to do is decide to use it."
