        "Bill laments to Wyatt that his mother is crazy and she must pay for her crimes toward the family. Wyatt says she already has lost everything that matters to her. She lost her job and the only man, Liam, that she cared for. Bill says Liam needs closure and the only way he will get that is to press charges against Quinn and send her away for a long time. Lt. Baker tells Liam enough is enough, stop telling Quinn what she has done. If he is going to press charges, then just say so. Brooke stops by Katie's and finds her playing with Will. Katie has a better attitude and says she knows Brooke is concerned about her but she doesn't have to anymore. Brooke says she is glad Katie is not drinking anymore and she does sense a certain calmness and confidence in her. Katie says she realizes she was a hot mess and she does not want to add to that. She knows Bill is hurting because his two sons are at odds. She has not been there for him but now she wants to. Brooke says she is now and she has gotten her sister back. Bill tells Wyatt that he has compassion but he is looking at it from the big picture. Liam is pressing charges right now. Indeed Liam tells Lt. Baker that he will. Quinn is read her rights. Her attorney tells Liam that he is making a big mistake. He will never win this case in court. Even Justin, his own attorney, tells him he will go through hell and still may not win. He promised Bill that he would have Liam's best interest at heart and that is what he is doing now. Quinn tells Liam that she is sorry. She deserves everything he is doing and wishes she could make it up to him.",
        "Lt. Baker starts to take Quinn away and Liam calls out to hold up; he has changed his mind. He is not going to press charges. Liam tells Justin that everything he wanted is gone because of that woman. He did not know who he was in the cabin or even who Quinn was. Wyatt walks in and tells Liam that he knows Quinn was wrong but she is his mother and wishes Liam did not press charges. He is stunned when Liam tells him that he did not. Wyatt thanks him and says he will never forget that. He will personally make sure that his mother stays away from Liam. Quinn is free to go and her attorney and Lt. Baker strongly advise that she stay away from Liam. When all is done Liam asks to speak to her. Baker says she is a free woman so she can do what she wants. Liam sits down and bluntly asks Quinn who she is. Wyatt tells Justin that his mother's time with Liam changed her and he hopes she stays that way. Liam tells Quinn that his brother is now married to the woman he loved but he is not going to give up on that. But Quinn taught him one thing and after today he thinks she should stop thinking of him as they are done. She says no. He taught her goodness and sacrifice and how to love. She can work on that and make him proud of her. She realizes that he hates her now but she is not the Quinn he used to despise. His words were goodness and tenderness. He made her believe in herself, a remarkable lovable woman. She will make him believe that again, the woman he admired and respected."

        "Liam: How could you possibly think I'd have feelings for you after what you did to me?",
        "Quinn: I was hoping for a miracle, I guess. That you'd realize what we had.",
        "Lt. Baker: Enough of this. We need your answer, Liam. Are you pressing charges against Ms. Fuller or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I know this is hard for you to swallow, Wyatt. But your mother belongs behind bars.",
        "Wyatt: How is that gonna help anything, Dad?",
        "Bill: Well, for starters, it'll bring your brother some justice.",
        "Wyatt: No. No, all he wants to do is get back with Steffy. That's what he wants.",
        "Bill: And he holds Quinn responsible for that, and rightfully so.",
        "Wyatt: Dad.",
        "Bill: Uh...but Steffy's married to you now. Liam has to respect that. The bottom line is that Quinn interfered in our family. She's crazy, Wyatt, and dangerous. Quinn has to pay for her crimes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Are you gonna be an orange monster and eat an orange for me? Huh? Om! Oh, my gosh! You took a big bite of that orange! I think I'm gonna be a tickle monster and give you some tickles!",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Brooke: Hi. Oh, my gosh! Who is your favorite auntie? Ooh, you're gonna get me. Ooh! Oh, big hugs. Big hugs and -- oh! Oh, you got me! You got me! [Laughs]",
        "Will: Got you.",
        "Both: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my gosh. Your mom's feeding you oranges and doughnuts? Are you gonna share a doughnut with me, you little stinker?",
        "Katie: Are you gonna share? I've been trying to get him to eat the oranges, but I think he's more interested in Daddy's doughnut.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: What brings you by?",
        "Brooke: Oh, I was just...",
        "Katie: Checking up on me?",
        "Brooke: Well, I --",
        "Katie: I don't blame you. You know, especially after what happened the other night.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Katie, I just want you to be happy, the way you are right now with this little guy.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Brooke: Do you?",
        "Katie: Yeah, you and Bill have been really worried about me, and not without reason. But you don't have to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Mom has already paid a very steep price, Dad.",
        "Bill: Really?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. She's lost her job, her credibility, she's lost the only guy that I've ever seen her ever have feelings for.",
        "Bill: Wh-what guy is that?",
        "Wyatt: Liam.",
        "Bill: No! No. Not Liam. Imaginary Liam, right? This crazy scenario she created in her whacked-out head. That was Adam. That was Adam. You know what she put Liam through.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I saw it firsthand.",
        "Bill: So, you don't see your brother's point of view?",
        "Wyatt: No, I see that, too. I-I just -- I don't agree with it.",
        "Bill: Because she's your mother and you want to protect her. Which is completely understandable.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: But, Wyatt, Liam needs closure, and the only way he's going to get it is to put your mother away for a long time. Liam has to press charges.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ed: You know what you're up against, Liam, if you press this forward.",
        "Justin: He's well-aware of that, Counselor.",
        "Ed: Just a friendly reminder.",
        "Liam: I'm a non-violent man. You know that.",
        "Quinn: I admire that about you.",
        "Liam: You didn't used to.",
        "Quinn: I'm not that woman anymore. Because of you.",
        "Liam: See, now, why should I believe you? Why should I believe that this isn't just your typical strategy -- say whatever you got to say to get yourself off the hook? Not this time, Quinn. What you did to me will not go unpunished. Lieutenant, I want to press charges.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Such a beautiful child. It feels like just yesterday when R.J. was Will's age.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I was putting him down for a nap, and he just threw his arms around me and said, \"Mommy, I love you so much.\"",
        "Brooke: Oh! That'll really get to you.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Every time.",
        "Brooke: There's something different about you.",
        "Katie: Different?",
        "Brooke: I don't know. A calmness, and I'm really glad to hear that you didn't drink that night. And you know it was all a misunderstanding. I really wish you didn't have to go through that after you've... been through all that other stuff recently.",
        "Katie: Yeah. [Chuckles] Well, I'm -- I'm trying to see things, uh, more clearly, you know? I-I -- Bill's had to put up with my craziness, and I can be a bit of a hot mess. And I didn't want to play that role, you know, be another one of his problems, especially with everything he's dealing with his sons.",
        "Brooke: And Quinn.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, talk about a hot mess. [Chuckles] At least she's in custody. And it's long overdue, considering what she did.",
        "Brooke: You really think she's gonna go to prison?",
        "Katie: If Liam has anything to say about it, she will.",
        "Brooke: Oh, boy. This must be really hard on Wyatt.",
        "Katie: Yeah. He knows that she did terrible things, but it's still got to be tough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Wow. The-there's no room for compassion in your world view, is there, Dad?",
        "Bill: Compassion?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Really? I have plenty of freakin' compassion, Wyatt. She's still breathing, isn't she?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: And world view? It's not a world view. This is an isolated case, and I'm looking at it on its merit. You know what she did to your brother and to you, for that matter.",
        "Wyatt: She needed something, Dad. All her life, she just -- she really -- she needed to feel what it was like to share love with another man. She's never had that before. And apparently, she had it with Adam or Liam or... just his gentleness and sensitivity -- it made her complete. It made her whole again. That's what she said -- that he made her a better woman.",
        "Bill: You really think your brother did this for her?",
        "Wyatt: Who he was up at the cabin, yeah. I do. He's gonna press charges, isn't he?",
        "Bill: Probably as we speak.",
        "Wyatt: I got to get over there.",
        "Bill: Wyatt. Uh --",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "[Clatters]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I-I know my rights. Your officers already --",
        "Lt. Baker: Procedure, Ms. Fuller. You have the right to an attorney.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Lt. Baker: If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you. Now, do you understand these rights as I have explained them to you?",
        "Quinn: Yes.",
        "Ed: Does your client realize what he's doing here?",
        "Liam: Yes, Mr. De La Rosa. I realize --",
        "Ed: I don't believe that you do. The difficulty to win this case. Quinn didn't abduct you. She didn't force herself upon you. She didn't hold you against your will. She took care of you, Liam, even consulted a doctor, nursed you back to health.",
        "Liam: Okay, well, I made my decision, so why don't we let the court decide?",
        "Ed: Oh, the court of public opinion, Liam. What do you think? This is gonna be, like, a quick, two-day affair? [Sighs] You better talk to this young man.",
        "Justin: Liam, the man's words can't be ignored.",
        "Liam: Yeah, and neither can what Quinn did to me and the impact it had on my life.",
        "Justin: Believe me, Liam. She's gonna have more of an impact if you press charges, on you, your father, the company, Steffy, Wyatt. This case is gonna touch every one of you, and it will be high-profile.",
        "Liam: My dad doesn't care about that. I don't care about that. She screwed up my whole existence.",
        "Justin: I realize that. Look, I'm not saying that she isn't guilty.",
        "Liam: Then do your job and prove it.",
        "Justin: You know what? I'm gonna be honest. I don't think we're gonna be able to. This is a very difficult case with some unique circumstances. You're gonna go through hell, and it may well be for nothing.",
        "Liam: Okay, okay. So, what are you saying right now? Are you saying we don't have enough for a conviction?",
        "Justin: I know this attorney, and I know what he'll pull, so, no, I don't.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Justin: I told your father I would have your best interests at heart, and that's what I'm doing right now, Liam.",
        "Liam: So, what? We just -- we just let her walk away?",
        "Justin: Release yourself from this. She's done enough damage. Don't let her do any more. You have a life, Liam. But you won't if you get caught up in court with all of this.",
        "Quinn: Liam. I am so sorry. I deserve everything you're doing to me. My only regret is that I'm not gonna have a chance to make it up to you.",
        "Lt. Baker: Come on. We got to get you processed.",
        "Liam: Hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on. [Sighs] I changed my mind. I'm not pressing charges.",
        "Ed: He didn't prosecute you.",
        "Liam: Everything I ever wanted is gone because of that woman.",
        "Justin: Liam, if we went after her --",
        "Liam: I know. I hear you. I know. It'll be a circus and we probably won't even win.",
        "Justin: Her attorney had valid points. Okay, you weren't held against your will. You were grateful. You told her you loved her.",
        "Liam: I didn't know who I was, Justin. I didn't know who she was.",
        "Justin: Look, I know you want justice, Liam, but it is best just to let it go and move on, not reliving all that in court.",
        "Liam: What am I supposed to move on to, exactly? My entire life revolved around Steffy before any of this happened. You -- you realize how different things would look if Quinn hadn't gotten involved?",
        "Wyatt: What the hell is going on here? You pressed charges.",
        "Liam: You know something, Wyatt? Your mother deserves to pay for what she did to me and Steffy and you.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I was hoping for something else. I know what she did to you was wrong, but she's my mother. And the thought of her behind bars --",
        "Liam: She's not gonna -- she's not gonna be behind bars. I'm not pressing charges.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Justin says our case isn't strong enough 'cause of the whole he said/she said thing, despite what she actually did to me.",
        "Wyatt: Wait. So, she's free? Man... I mean, I can -- I can only imagine --",
        "Liam: Yeah, I don't think you can.",
        "Wyatt: Regardless... thank you. It wouldn't have been good for her, and you know it. And whether you did this for me or for whoever, I'll never forget it, all right? And I will make sure that my mother stays away from you. I will personally see to that.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Lt. Baker: Free to go.",
        "Quinn: I can't thank you enough.",
        "Ed: You can thank me by staying away from Liam Spencer.",
        "Quinn: Maybe he forgave me.",
        "Ed: He didn't prosecute you.",
        "Lt. Baker: I would strongly advise you to stay clear of him.",
        "Liam: Can I have a few minutes alone with Quinn?",
        "Lt. Baker: She's a free woman. She can do what she wants.",
        "Quinn: Leave us, please.",
        "Liam: Who are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I mean, being held all that time.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Poor Liam. He must have been so confused.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Poor Liam. He must have been so confused.",
        "Katie: Yeah. I suspect he still is. I mean, being held all that time and thinking that he and Quinn were married.",
        "Brooke: He must be so angry.",
        "Katie: Still, something happened between those two in that cabin.",
        "Brooke: Well, she did take care of him and she nursed him back to health, even though it was based on a lie.",
        "Katie: He was able to respond to her as a caregiver.",
        "Brooke: A wife.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] You know who's suffering as much as anyone because of this? Bill.",
        "Brooke: He's in the middle of his two sons.",
        "Katie: I -- he's hurting. I know he doesn't like to show it, but I can feel it.",
        "Brooke: He needs you, Katie.",
        "Katie: I know. And I haven't been there for him in a long time.",
        "Brooke: But you are there no and I am getting my sister back.",
        "Katie: It still hurts, you know, what you said -- that you love Bill and that you always will.",
        "Brooke: Katie --",
        "Katie: No, I-I have to be honest about this. But I'm not gonna use it as an excuse to...fall apart. I'm gonna keep it together... for my son, for my husband, and for my family. I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I feel bad a Liam. But I'm relieved that my mother's free.",
        "Justin: Yeah. Got to hope that your dad understands.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] She feels horrible about everything, something I have never seen in her before, ever.",
        "Justin: She does seem repentant.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] That's a new one.",
        "Justin: Yeah. I got to credit my brother. Their time together, as wrong as it was -- it changed her. It made her a better person, Justin. I just... I hope that she stays that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Who am I? [Chuckles] I have been asking myself that same question.",
        "Liam: You are... a master manipulator.",
        "Quinn: That was always my go-to. Yeah.",
        "Liam: I think it still is. The woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with is married to my brother because of you. And Steffy was everything to me. And I'm not gonna give up on her. But one thing you've taught me -- there are no guarantees in life, are there?",
        "Quinn: I have hurt you so much. [Chuckles] The only man that I have ever connected to, and I have made you suffer. But I am going to redeem myself. And you.",
        "Liam: I think you should forget about me. Because after today, Quinn, we're done.",
        "Quinn: For you. But not for me. 'Cause I owe you so much, not just for my freedom and giving me a second chance, but especially -- Liam, especially, you taught me goodness. You taught me the meaning of sacrifice and of giving. You taught me how to love. And that is not a lesson that I am gonna soon forget. I'll make you proud of me. I know you don't share these feelings. Quite the opposite. You hate me. But, see, that's gonna change, the same way that our time together changed me, 'cause I am not the Quinn that you used to despise. I-I-I'm that woman in the cabin who was full of goodness and tenderness, and those are your words. And -- and I -- and I used to fight that when I heard them, but the more you said them, the more I started to believe them. And you -- you made me believe in myself, that I could be this remarkable, loving woman. And I'm gonna continue to be her. I am. I'm gonna prove it to you. I promise. 'Cause this woman -- this woman standing before you right now that you are seeing -- I'm that woman who was in that cabin with you that you respected and you admired and you loved."
