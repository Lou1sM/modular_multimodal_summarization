        "Bill and Brooke enjoy the beauty of Dubai. He shows her they are at the tip of Palm Jumeirah and it is constructed entirely by the rock and sand from the ocean. And Brooke realizes it is in the shape of a palm tree. She rattles off all the hotels, places to see and shopping. She teases that she hopes he brought along all his credit cards. Muhammad welcomes them and relays if they are getting married he hopes they will stay a month. They do things big there or if they prefer it can be more private. Katie catches up with Ridge alone late at night in his office. Not in a very good mood, he says he heard from his son. She thinks that should have brightened his day until he says RJ showed him something .something Bill gave him, his shiny new necklace ..the sword, his parting shot. And RJ was very pleased with it and told to wear it with Spencer pride. Katie disagrees with him when he says Bill is trying to get to him through RJ. He's playing games and does not care about RJ but Ridge doesn't want Katie talking to Bill for him. He's just trying to brainwash RJ, that's why he sent him the necklace. He brainwashed Brooke and now he's doing it to RJ and Ridge has got to stop it. She says she hates to see him like this, so they will straighten it out. She just doesn't want him to obsess about this. He says he will try. Wyatt looks at Quinn's selfie and wants to know what that is. She says proof that Bill is not ready to marry Brooke Logan. Wyatt is flabbergasted and doesn't even want to know how she got that. He asks her to delete it please. When she makes light of it, he says enough, he will send her his therapy bill. She wonders what Brooke would think if she saw that. Wyatt tells her do not even go there. But she goes on that Brooke thinks Bill is so loyal and true. He takes the phone away from her and says Brooke is royalty around here and if Quinn does anything with that photo they will be out around here. He will lose Hope and they will lose their jobs. She says she knows; her hands are tied. He says good; now erase it. Ridge walks in before they can say more. He wants to get started. Katie fills Donna in on the necklace. Donna knows that must have set Ridge off. Katie says yes and beyond. She's discussed it with Ridge but he's not listening. He has a problem with Bill no matter how good a dad he is to Liam and Wyatt and Will. He hates Bill. He hates the way he walks, the way he talks, the way he dresses and of course he is all wrong for Brooke. Donna says well they are getting married so Ridge will just have to accept that. Ridge tells Quinn and Wyatt that perhaps they have noticed that he is not pleased with things that happened to the company while he was away ..the couture line took a backseat to HFTF and the Bedroom Line. Quinn doesn't see how that involves them. He tells her that her accessories are inadequate for those lines; they won't work. She says and that's the reason they are re-tooling them. He says he doesn't want to be rude but he's a little skeptical. He doesn't think the Blue Diamond or the Stephanie collection really helped the image of the company. Wyatt says with all due respect they did add to the company's bottom line. He says he is not blaming them; he blames himself for not paying attention ..to a lot of things. But he's getting his focus back so how does that involve their little company. She says there are still a number of pieces he has not seen yet and she is confident they will be to his liking. She says they were all at the meeting and she hopes he won't let these distractions color his decision. He is mad at Bill, not them. Quinn says his anger with Bill is justified. Ridge says he did vent a little too much but that is not why they are here now. This whole day, talking about the wedding has thrown him off balance. He wishes he could do something about it but he can't, so they don't need to talk about it anymore. She assures him they will get him the designs by the end of the day.",
        "Wyatt tells Quinn that anything she does now will reflect on them so she is to do nothing. He wants her to be happy but find another man. She says she does not need another man. He says good because Bill falls into that category. She says Bill is a dangerous, self-centered, egomaniacal bully and she loves it. Brooke is the wrong woman for him. She knows it and Ridge knows it. He leaves but comes back later as she is studying the selfie. He tells her it is the red button, delete it. He likes his job here and he hopes she does too. And he's battling for Hope and that is not a done deal and he doesn't want her ruining that. He tells her to stop, he knows that look. She holds up her fingers and says there will be no deliberate interference on her part. He asks her if there is room for interpretation there. She says Ridge is probably sitting in his office ready for her things now, so she will finish up what she has and send him to his laptop and then keeping working on the rest. He says he hopes he can trust her. She scrolls around on her laptop with pieces of jewelry and then inserts the pix of her and Bill. Katie tells Ridge that Donna was just there and they all agree that they all need little sword necklaces to ease the situation. She hates seeing him so miserable over this as it makes her miserable too."

        "Ridge: His shiny new necklace that Bill gave him.",

        "Katie: I-I-I don't want the two of you going at it again.",

        "Katie: I don't think that's entirely true.",
        "Ridge: He sent him a sword! Why else would he do that? He's brainwashing the kid.",
        "Katie: He can't. It's R.J. R.J. is your son. Brooke won't let him.",
        "Ridge: Brooke won't let him? Brooke isn't thinking straight. Look at her -- she used those papers to get that company back. That's not Brooke. He's brainwashed her, and he wants to do the same to my son, and I got to stop it.",
        "Katie: I hate seeing you like this.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I don't want to lay this all on you -- it's not fair.",

        "Brooke: [Sighs] Bill, you didn't have to spend this money for me.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] You don't have to worry about it. You just enjoy this incredible trip and this suite, which, by the way, is one of the largest in the world. It stretches all the way from the east tower to the west tower.",
        "Brooke: Wow.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: That is amazing. You are amazing.",
        "Bill: And you are my habibti.",

        "Brooke: Everything is spectacular. It's amazing. And the suite -- oh, it's so beautiful.",
        "Muhammad: Our mission is to exceed your expectations, which we hope are quite high.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yes, of course. They definitely are.",
        "Muhammad: You're here for a special occasion?",
        "Bill: Well, you could say that. We're getting married. But the bride-to-be doesn't know where or when.",
        "Muhammad: Excellent. Then you will be our guests for a month -- maybe longer.",
        "Bill: A month?",
        "Brooke: A month?",
        "Bill: You want to stay for a month? We'll see. Maybe.",
        "Muhammad: In our culture, weddings last for many weeks. Parties are held both before and after. Of course, if you want something more private, that can be arranged, as well.",

        "Muhammad: Arabian hospitality is legendary. I promise you a memory that you will forever treasure.",

        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Bill: Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I just wish Bill hadn't done that. I mean, he had to know how Ridge was gonna react.",
        "Donna: Oh, come on, Katie. That's why he did it -- to get to Ridge.",
        "Katie: I know, but it's so childish.",
        "Donna: Well, [Sighs] Come on -- a sword necklace? R.J. probably thought it was the coolest thing ever.",
        "Katie: Of course, he did. He's a kid. Oh, no, it gets better. Bill told R.J. that he needs to wear the necklace with \"Spencer pride.\"",
        "Donna: Ugh. God, that must have sent Ridge through the roof.",
        "Katie: And beyond. Although I'm sure he kept it in check for R.J.",
        "Donna: It's just so silly. I mean, he's marrying our sister in the Emirates, no less. Could he have picked a more exotic location?",
        "Katie: [Scoffs] Yeah, well, apparently, he found the time to play with Ridge right before he left town.",
        "Donna: Yeah, and Ridge took the bait.",
        "Katie: Ridge doesn't want Bill anywhere near R.J.",
        "Donna: You have talked to him about this, right?",
        "Katie: Yes, of course -- more than once.",
        "Donna: And?",
        "Katie: And nothing. He says he's worried about Brooke and R.J.",
        "Donna: See, that -- I-I don't get that. Bill has his faults -- he does -- but he's great with Will and, you know, lately, with Wyatt, Liam. I'm sure he's gonna be great with R.J., too.",
        "Katie: I've told Ridge that, but he's not listening to me.",
        "Donna: What's his problem?",
        "Katie: Everything. He hates Bill. He hates the way he walks. He hates the way he talks. He hates the way he dresses. He despises him, and, of course, he thinks he's all wrong for Brooke.",
        "Donna: Well, obviously, Brooke feels otherwise.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, that bugs him all the more.",
        "Donna: [Sighs] Your fianc\u00e9 needs to be realistic. I mean, Bill and Brooke are getting married, and he's just gonna have to accept that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: As you may have noticed, I'm not pleased with what happened to this company when I was gone.",
        "Wyatt: In what way?",
        "Ridge: Well, uh, Couture took a backseat to some of the other lines.",
        "Wyatt: You mean HFTF.",
        "Ridge: Yes. Hope for the Future and that bedroom line.",
        "Quinn: And that involves us how?",
        "Ridge: Well, your accessories, Quinn, are adequate for those lines. They're not gonna work for Couture.",
        "Quinn: Which is why we're retooling them.",
        "Ridge: And I think that's great. And without being completely rude, I just -- I'm, uh, a little skeptical.",
        "Quinn: Ridge, we've been given a lot of praise in the press.",
        "Ridge: I know. I read all about that -- the blue diamond promotion and using my mother's jewelry collection. But none of that helped the image of our company.",
        "Wyatt: With all due respect, those promotions added significantly to this company's bottom line.",
        "Ridge: Yes, we made a lot of money...",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: ...While losing the respect of our traditional clientele. Now, I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming myself for not paying attention -- not paying attention to a lot of things. But we're getting our focus back. The question is, how does that involve your little company?",
        "Quinn: Well, we have a lot of pieces that you still haven't seen yet, and I'm confident that they'll be more to your liking.",
        "Ridge: We'll see.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Uh, but, please, don't -- don't let these distractions color your decision.",
        "Ridge: Distractions?",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat]",
        "Quinn: We were all at the meeting earlier, Ridge. You're upset, understandably, at Bill -- not us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: There's so much to see.",
        "Bill: Exotic cars, skyscrapers, all the beautiful bling.",
        "Brooke: Dubai -- so you.",
        "Bill: Oh, you think so?",
        "Brooke: Mm-hmm. Exotic, sophisticated, bigger than life.",
        "Bill: Wow.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Thank you for bringing me here for our wedding...even though I don't know where it's going to be or when. Just give me a little hint. A girl's got to prepare.",
        "Bill: You trust me, right?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Bill: And I've never let you down, and I'm not going to start now. I promise you will love what I have in store for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: You are just gonna have to lay down the law -- that's it.",
        "Katie: And how would you suggest I do that?",
        "Donna: No, I mean it. Really, Ridge has got to get used to this. He has two families now. You're all just gonna have to get along.",
        "Katie: Well, I guess we'll do our best.",
        "Donna: You tell him enough is enough. You're engaged. Bill and Brooke are about to get married. You all just have to move on and live happily ever after.",
        "Katie: Maybe I should let you tell him. You sound like quite the authority.",
        "Donna: [Chuckles] Don't tempt me.",
        "Katie: I'd love to see that -- you in the room with Bill and Ridge growling at each other.",
        "Donna: I would slap them both down if they didn't listen to me.",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "Donna: [Sighs] Honey, seriously, this is crazy. Ridge loves you. Bill loves Brooke. This is actually a perfect ending to what could have been a disaster -- what -- what was a disaster just a few months ago.",
        "Katie: I don't think there's anything perfect about the situation, Donna. It just is what it is.",
        "Donna: Bill's happy. Brooke is happy. You're happy. Aren't you?",
        "Katie: I just -- I hate seeing Ridge like this. I want to be there for him, but he's obsessed with Bill and Brooke. I know he loves me, but he's not gonna let this go... and I don't know what I can do to get through to him.",
        "Donna: Oh, honey. Come here. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, wait till you see the beaches. I mean, the sand is soft as silk.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I love the sound of that.",
        "Bill: Oh, you know what we should do? We should, uh, go across Al Khor to the Deira side. That's Old Dubai. And we could take a bike ride along the gulf.",
        "Brooke: Yes. That sounds fun.",
        "Bill: Well, that's why we're here -- scuba diving, skydiving, shopping. Oh, we could even, uh, take a balloon ride over the desert.",
        "Brooke: Oh.",
        "Bill: Oh, that's right. And we do have to fit a wedding in somewhere along the way.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. That's right, habibi.",
        "Bill: I can't -- wow.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: I am impressed. Look at you -- getting your Arabic down.",
        "Brooke: Yes, habibi.",
        "Bill: My habibti.",
        "Brooke: My habibi.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Brooke: Habibi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I may have vented a little bit at that meeting earlier, but that's not why we're here now.",
        "Quinn: All I'm saying --",
        "Ridge: I know what you're saying. You don't want to be guilty by association.",
        "Wyatt: Look, that's not you, Ridge. We know that.",
        "Quinn: Of course, we do, and your frustration with Bill is completely justified.",
        "Wyatt: As is you being upset with us with the Couture accessories, which we will take care of.",
        "Ridge: Thank you. It's been a strange day for me. This whole wedding thing has just got me, um, off-balance. Wish I could do something about it, but I can't, so I won't. But let's not talk about it anymore -- not in the office or outside of the office. And your father is --",
        "Quinn: Point taken. We -- we'll get you the rest of the designs by the end of the day.",
        "Ridge: I'll look for them.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: Mom. No. You heard Ridge. You can't stop the wedding. There's nothing you can do, okay? This is Brooke. This is our work. That's Hope's mom. It's dangerous.",
        "Quinn: I won't do anything that will reflect on us.",
        "Wyatt: Anything that you do will reflect on us. Look, I want you to be happy, okay? I want you to -- to find someone else -- another man.",
        "Quinn: No. I don't need a man.",
        "Wyatt: Good, because Dad falls into that category.",
        "Quinn: Not really.",
        "Wyatt: Mom.",
        "Quinn: He is a dangerous, self-centered, egomaniacal bully, and I love it.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Quinn: Brooke is the wrong woman for him. I know it, and so does Ridge.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: Uh, it's the red button. Says \"Delete\" on it. I like my job. Do you?",
        "Quinn: Oh, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Look, it's not only that, okay? I'm battling for Hope here, and that is not a done deal, and I don't want you ruining that.",
        "Quinn: Brooke thinks he's so loyal, and he's not.",
        "Wyatt: Will you stop? I know that look.",
        "Quinn: There will be no deliberate interference on my part.",
        "Wyatt: \"Deliberate interference\"? Is there room for interpretation there?",
        "Quinn: You know what? I have work to do, okay? I-I'm sure Ridge is sitting in his office, staring at his inbox as we speak, so I'm just gonna send him what I already have and then keep on working on everything else. Okay?",
        "Wyatt: Fine. I'll leave you to it.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Can I trust you?",
        "Quinn: You know better than to ask me that. Go. Go.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Ridge: Hi.",
        "Katie: Feeling better?",
        "Ridge: I'm trying.",
        "Katie: Donna was here earlier.",
        "Ridge: Donna? Team Spencer cheerleader.",
        "Katie: I think she wants us all to try to get along.",
        "Ridge: Ah. Well, if that's what she wants, maybe she should give everyone a little sword, and we'd all be happy.",
        "Katie: I think we should have all little sword necklaces -- all of us. Listen, um, I know that Brooke is always going to be important to you -- I get it. But she wants to marry Bill... and that doesn't have to make you happy, and it doesn't have to make me happy, but I can't stand seeing it make you so miserable, because that kind of makes me miserable, too.",
        "Ridge: I don't want that.",
        "Katie: So I think we should try to deal with the situation the best way we can. Brooke and Bill are gonna get married, and there's really nothing that we can do about that. I do love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Thank you for bringing me here -- halfway around the world.",
        "Bill: You don't have to thank me. I would travel the universe for you.",
        "Brooke: Peace and serenity. [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: I don't trust anyone at home. People out to get us. I'm not taking any chances. I can't wait for the day that you become my bride.",
        "Brooke: Your habibti.",
        "Bill: You're getting it.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: That's right. You're my habibti forever."
