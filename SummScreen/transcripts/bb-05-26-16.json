        "The Forresters and Avants meet at Eric's manse to welcome the baby home. Julius tells Sasha he should be there too but he was not invited because of her. She doesn't think it is so much to ask for that she love someone and that he loves her back. Julius says they may have been broken up, but Zende never stopped loving Nicole. Sasha says she does not see many going to bat for Julius but she will if he supports her and Zende. She knows that Nicole wants to get back with him and he said yes. Thomas asks Ridge if he can have few uninterrupted hours with his son tonight. Ridge says no one gets to say my son except him. Maya tells the group they have picked out a name \u0096 Elizabeth Nicole ..Elizabeth after Rick's grandmother and they will call her Lizzy ... Nicole after her sweet selfless sister. Ridge tells Thomas that he wants to groom him for CEO but he needs more experience so he'd like to send him overseas to Asia. He has experience at Paris International, now he needs Asia. Thomas says he is sending him to Shanghai just to keep him away from his son. They both know that is the reason why.",
        "Maya overhears Nicole and Zende talking and she is so happy they are back together, but then confused when he tells her that Sasha is pregnant. Zende says he will never turn his back on his child. Maya says if there really is a child. They need to find out today. Julius tells Sasha that he is glad Zende came to his senses. He laments that he is still not convinced that Sasha is pregnant, the timing is too perfect. Maya and Nicole catch Sasha as she leaves from her photo shoot. Maya confronts her and says she understands Sasha is pregnant and of course Zende just happens to be the father. Sasha pretends to be hurt by them not believing her. Maya says okay sister to sister, take this pregnancy test and prove it. Thomas tells Ridge their circumstances are different. Ridge never knew that Massimo was his father until much later in life but Thomas does know now that Douglas is his. Ridge counterclaims it makes no difference they both need to get on with their lives. When Thomas bucks at the idea, Ridge hands him a ticket and says he is booked already. This is something he has to do."

        "Eric: I cannot wait to start spoiling this baby.",
        "Maya: Aww.",
        "Rick: I say that you and mom are doing a smash-up job. Vivienne, too.",
        "Vivienne: Oh.",
        "Maya: Yeah, all those stuffed animals you brought to the hospital?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, the nurse said she had never seen so many cuddly bunnies for one tiny baby.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Vivienne: Ohh, this is my first grandchild.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Vivienne: I'm allowed to go all out.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Zende: Yeah, but what's granddad's and Brooke's excuse?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Maya: You know you caused all this joy and happiness, right? I know we thank you over and over and over again, but it -- it just never seems like enough.",
        "Rick: Sweetie.",
        "[Chatter]",
        "Zende: You okay?",
        "Nicole: I'd be much better if Sasha wasn't pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: I should be at Eric's home right now with the rest of my family and my new grandbaby. But do I get invited? No. And do you know why? Because you decided you wanted revenge.",
        "Sasha: You know, I kept your secret for years. And what did that get me?",
        "Julius: I'm not arguing with you anymore.",
        "Sasha: Fine. But if it's any consolation, [Scoffs] I didn't get invited, either.",
        "Julius: Yeah, well, that doesn't surprise me, given what you've been up to.",
        "Sasha: I haven't been up to anything. I just want somebody who loves me who I can love back.",
        "Julius: [Scoffs]",
        "Sasha: Is that so much to ask for?",
        "Julius: Yeah, well, [Chuckles] Getting pregnant by your sister's boyfriend doesn't exactly garner you the kind of love that you're saying you want.",
        "Sasha: Dad, for the last time, Zende was not Nicole's boyfriend. They'd already broken up.",
        "Julius: Maybe, but he never stopped loving her.",
        "Sasha: Look, the point is, I think if you and I work together --",
        "Julius: Listen, I already told you. I want nothing to do with anything that puts me between you and Nicole.",
        "Sasha: Even if it means I'll help aunt Viv forgive you? Yeah. 'Cause, you know, I don't think a whole lot of people are going up to bat for you lately. But I will. If you support me and Zende's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: What about the, uh, architects from the Rodeo boutique remodel?",
        "Ridge: Uh, well, we're having lunch today, and I'm gonna see what they got.",
        "Thomas: You want me to sit in?",
        "Ridge: I think I can handle it.",
        "Thomas: I know. I'm just interested. That's all.",
        "Ridge: You know what I'll do? Uh, I'll send you all the notes after the meeting. How's that?",
        "Thomas: Thanks. [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Thomas: I was wondering about Douglas.",
        "Ridge: What were you wondering?",
        "Thomas: Well, I'd like to have him for the evening. A few uninterrupted hours with my son.",
        "Ridge: Don't say \"my son.\" The only person who gets to say \"my son\" is me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Boy, you are some operator.",
        "Sasha: Just offering a helping hand.",
        "Julius: Yeah. At a price.",
        "Sasha: Look, the way I see it, we need each other.",
        "Julius: The way I see it, if you're pregnant with Zende's baby, you don't have anything to worry about.",
        "Sasha: True. If Nicole is totally out of the picture.",
        "Julius: Wait a minute, listen, Zende is a principled young man, and I'm sure he's gonna do the right thing by his baby. And Nicole would never stand between a father and a child.",
        "Sasha: Even if the child's father reconnected with his ex?",
        "Julius: What are you talking about?",
        "Sasha: Zende. He told Nicole that he wanted to get back together with her. And guess what? She said yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: I didn't even know Sasha went to the hospital, let alone told you about the baby.",
        "Nicole: It would have been a huge shock if I hadn't heard it from you first. Not that I don't have my doubts.",
        "Rick: Hey, you two! Get on over here. We got a big announcement to make.",
        "Maya: Believe it or not, we finally have a name for our little one.",
        "Eric: Oh!",
        "Vivienne: Okay! [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: Tell us what you think.",
        "Nicole: Elizabeth Nicole Forrester.",
        "Maya: \"Elizabeth\" after Rick's grandmother, Beth.",
        "Vivienne: Ah!",
        "Rick: We're gonna call her Lizzy.",
        "Maya: \"Nicole\" after my sweet, selfless sister who made this beautiful miracle possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] These walls have ears. You got to be a little more careful.",
        "Thomas: Dad, look, he's --",
        "Ridge: No, no, no, no, no, no. You look. I'm the C.E.O. of this company. I don't care what Rick says. I'm in control. And you got to want that because you are tied -- your future is tied -- to this company.",
        "Thomas: It's no secret that it's been a dream of mine to lead Forrester one day, but --",
        "Ridge: All right. It doesn't have to be a dream.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: I know it's been tough between us, but I'm your dad. I see what you're capable of. I see your talent and your drive. [Sighs] I've thought about this a lot, and I want to groom you as CEO. But you need some experience, so I'm gonna send you overseas.",
        "Thomas: Overseas? Wher-- wher-- where? Paris?",
        "Ridge: Shanghai.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: There you go, my little sweetheart. Freshly changed and ready for your nap.",
        "Vivienne: Precious little angel.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Vivienne: Yeah.",
        "Eric: A Forrester Avant angel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: It's not that I don't love you.",
        "Zende: I know.",
        "Nicole: I've never stopped loving you. It's just --",
        "Zende: I want a future with you, to be back together.",
        "Maya: Oh, my God. It's true?",
        "Zende: Yeah. I never should have ended things.",
        "Maya: Oh, honey, this is so wonderful. I was so hoping you would come around, Zende.",
        "Zende: I can't imagine life without Nicole. You know, she -- she makes me happy. And we are so good together. And I never want to disappoint her in any way. Only I already have. Sasha. She's pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Well, I'm happy to hear that Zende has come to his senses and realized what he's leaving behind with Nicole, much to your disappointment, I'm sure.",
        "Sasha: Nope, 'cause things could still work out for us.",
        "Julius: How? Because you're having his baby?",
        "Sasha: Because I know Zende loves me, too.",
        "Julius: Is that what he told you? Or did you guys just make a baby together? If that's even what's happening here.",
        "Sasha: I'm sorry. What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Julius: It means that I'm not so sold on your pregnancy. See, your timing is suspect. Just as Zende realizes that he loves Nicole, all of a sudden, you announce your pregnancy. See, there's something fishy about that.",
        "Sasha: No, there's nothing fishy going on. Zende and I are about to be parents, and Nicole is just gonna have to deal with it.",
        "Jeremy: Hey. Ready to get started?",
        "Sasha: Hey, Jeremy. Sure am. All set.",
        "Julius: I thought, uh, you and Zende always worked together.",
        "Sasha: Obviously not. Oh, now, if you don't mind, you can kick rocks.",
        "Julius: [Scoffs] You're dismissing me?",
        "Sasha: Ooh, but, um, don't forget about my little offer. We help each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Shanghai?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: So, what? So Paris wasn't far enough away for you, or what?",
        "Ridge: This is -- no. We're doing well in Europe. We need some help in Asia.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, yeah, I agree with you, but what it seems like you're doing --",
        "Ridge: This is the greatest opportunity of your life! You're gonna gain knowledge and experience. And when you come back, I can tell dad that you're ready to take over.",
        "Thomas: No, no. That's still years away.",
        "Ridge: All right, maybe it is. But when it happens, I need you to be ready. That's why I'm doing this.",
        "Thomas: It's why you're doing this? You're doing this for me? You're sending me to Shanghai for -- for me?",
        "Ridge: All right. It's a long way away, but LAX -- there are flights every day in and out of that place, so, you know, you can be here whenever you need to be here.",
        "Thomas: To see my son?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Thomas, I --",
        "Thomas: He is my son whether you want to call him that or not.",
        "Ridge: What I want is for you to realize that if you want to be C.E.O. of this company, there are some sacrifices!",
        "Thomas: Sacrifices. Let's be honest, okay? This isn't just about business. You're doing this to get rid of me. And we both know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Look at this. That little baby is already the apple of her daddy's eye.",
        "Vivienne: It reminds me of Julius and Nicole. Oh, God, that man doted on that baby.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Easy to see why. Nicole is very special.",
        "Rick: You bet she is. Everything she sacrificed for Maya and me.",
        "Vivienne: I was afraid it might be the end for her and Zende, but seeing those two spend time together gives me hope.",
        "Rick: Hmm.",
        "Vivienne: Oh.",
        "Eric: Do we have any idea what's going on with Zende and Sasha?",
        "Rick: Not really. But Zende showing up at the hospital during the delivery, that -- that says a lot.",

        "[Camera shutter clicking]",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Jeremy: Hey, let's get some energy, okay? It feels like you're not really with me.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, sorry. Just used to working with --",
        "Jeremy: I know. Zende. Yeah. I know. You two more than just model and photographer?",
        "Sasha: Do you mean is he my boyfriend?",
        "Jeremy: Boyfriend, fianc\u00e9, father of your kids?",
        "Sasha: [Chuckles] I-I don't have any kids -- yet.",
        "Jeremy: But you'd love for them to be Zende's when you do?",
        "Sasha: Well -- [Laughs]",
        "Jeremy: There! That's the smile I'm after.",
        "[Camera shutter clicking]",
        "[Sasha's flashback]",
        "Nicole: This better not be another one of your lies, Sasha. If it is... we'll all find out. We'll know if you're really pregnant or if this is just a way to hold on to Zende.",
        "[Present time]",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Sasha: I can do this, I can do this, I can do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Okay, so let me get this straight. You were about to leave Sasha to go back to Nicole, and then she drops this bomb on you?",
        "Zende: I didn't want to hurt Sasha, but I had to be honest. I'll never love anyone the way that I love this girl.",
        "Maya: Well, Sasha must have realized. I mean, clearly you want to be with Nicole.",
        "Zende: More than anything. Not that I'd ever turn my back on my child.",
        "Maya: If there is a child. We only have Sasha's word on that.",
        "Nicole: You think she's making it up, too?",
        "Maya: I think she's desperate to hang on to Zende. And plus the timing.",
        "Nicole: Well, I told her at the hospital she better not be and that if she was, we'd all find out.",
        "Maya: Yeah, we will. But why wait several months to find out whether she's showing or not when we can find out today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I think a little separation would be good for you.",
        "Thomas: Oh, it seems like it's gonna be good for you, too, isn't it?",
        "Ridge: Well, uh, yeah, maybe. Emotions are raw, and, yeah, maybe it would be a good idea for everyone to have a little space. Thomas... men raise other men's babies all the time. Eric raised me, and I didn't know till much later in life that Massimo was my biological father.",
        "Thomas: A man that you are completely estranged from, even though you know the truth.",
        "Ridge: My situation with him is very different than the one you're gonna have with Douglas.",
        "Thomas: Because he didn't know until much later, but I know now. I do. And -- and you're asking me to do what?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: To -- to man up and forget that I have a son?",
        "Ridge: What I'm asking you is to do the right thing for Douglas. He's got a family. He's got Caroline, he's got me, and he's happy. He's gonna have a wonderful life. Now it's time for you to get on with yours. I want to help you with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Music turns off]",
        "Jeremy: That's a wrap. Uh, I think it'll work with what we got.",
        "Sasha: I'm sorry I wasn't my best today. I've just -- I've had a lot on my mind.",
        "Jeremy: No problem. Don't worry about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: There he is.",
        "Zende: Hey. Sorry. We lost track of time.",
        "Brooke: Is everything all right?",
        "Zende: With Nicole and me?",
        "Vivienne: Yeah. We were just saying it looks like you two are getting close again.",
        "Rick: Yeah, is there anything to report? Or should I pump Maya for details?",
        "Zende: Actually, um, she and Nicole went to go take care of something. That's all I can say. For now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Photo shoot over?",
        "Sasha: Uh, yeah. It just wrapped. Why?",
        "Maya: Right, okay, I didn't want to do this in front of other people.",
        "Sasha: Do what?",
        "Maya: You really didn't think I'd find out?",
        "Sasha: Maya, I'm sorry. It's not a biggie. Every model has an off day.",
        "Maya: I understand you're pregnant and that Zende is the father.",
        "Sasha: Yes, well, I mean, of course Zende is the father.",
        "Maya: It's awfully convenient, isn't it? He's about to leave you, go back to Nicole, and you trap him.",
        "Sasha: Is that what you told her? That I'm using this pregnancy to trap Zende?",
        "Maya: If you really are pregnant.",
        "Sasha: Oh, wow. So now you're questioning that, too?",
        "Maya: I think you might understand why I would -- why we might. After everything.",
        "Sasha: And I don't even get the benefit of the doubt?",
        "Maya: Oh, I'm just looking out for my sister.",
        "Sasha: Maya, I'm your sister, too. Or did you forget that part?",
        "Nicole: No. But that's not the issue here.",
        "Maya: No. Okay. Sisters to sister. Let's get it all out on the table. Take a pregnancy test. Show us you're telling the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Shanghai's gonna be good for you. You're gonna come back a better designer, a better businessman, a better person maybe, you know?",
        "Thomas: I'll also be on the other side of the world, which that's what this is about, right? Separating me from Douglas.",
        "Ridge: No. What this is about -- giving a good future, a great future, to this little boy and giving a good future to you. What are we gonna do if dad finds out? He's gonna give this company to Rick, and he's gonna run it in the ground. Is that what you want?",
        "Thomas: Of course it's not. Do you realize what you're asking me?",
        "Ridge: I'm asking you to do the right thing. That's all.",
        "Thomas: The right thing? By -- by shipping me off to Shanghai? That's the right thing? So you can -- you can sit here and enjoy your perfect, little life? I don't know what you think happened the night that Douglas was conceived, but it's not the way --",
        "Ridge: What I think happened that night? You want to have that conversation? Let's have it right now. You want to? Let's go. Go!",
        "Thomas: No, no, Dad, Dad, I don't! It's not -- [Sighs] This -- this -- I don't know if I can do this.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: I can't. I can't.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I love you, son. I know it doesn't always come across that way, but I do. I brought you into this world. Crazy world -- it's complicated, you know? And we make mistakes. We all make mistakes. \"Mistakes\" is not the right word. Mistakes -- [Sighs] Douglas is not a mistake to me. He's a great gift in my life, and I'm giving you a great gift, a gift of knowledge and experience. And you can take that and come back here and take the reins. That's what I need you to do, Thomas. That's what I'm asking you to do. [Sighs] So I booked you a ticket from Los Angeles to Shanghai. You're leaving today. This is something that you have to do."
