{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7594 ~ Steffy attempts to bring Ridge and Thomas together following their recent fall out; Nicole makes one last attempt to find out if her ultimate objective is attainable."], "Recap": ["Thomas wakes up and finds Sally in the kitchen wearing just his pajama shirt. She says she slept fine. They sip coffee while Thomas thinks about his getting a job. She just wishes he did not have to be at odds with his family. Steffy tells Ridge they cannot do this collection without Thomas. Ridge says Zende will step up. She says he still needs his son. Despite Ridge's objections she wants to call Thomas in and talk to him; this is her problem too. Darlita says Thomas is their hero. Shirley admits he did save the day with his money to oust Bill with his real estate stealing scheme. Saul still does not like accepting Thomas's money and does not want him around Spectra. Nicole, accompanied by Viv, visit an associate of Dr. Caspary who comes up with the same diagnosis. It is not 100% but there is a chance she will not be able to carry a child. Thomas takes a call from Steffy and she asks if he is free today. He asks if Ridge is going to be there. She says yes but she is trying to work a few things out so please come.", "Nicole and Viv come back to Forrester and Nicole is concerned when she finds Pam and Charlie babysitting Lizzy for a minute while Coco and RJ take a break. She insists that she hold her instead. She cuddles her close. Sally shows up and Shirley says it is nice for her to finally show up. Saul reminds them it is a work place so enough of the talk. Sally tells them that Thomas was fired at FC so she does not know what he will be doing now. Eric tells Ridge that Thomas was wrong but it does not warrant firing him and they especially need him now. Steffy says firing Thomas will only push him toward Spectra more. Thomas walks into the meeting with Ridge glaring at him. Steffy welcomes him and says they have missed him and they want him back at FC. Nicole says she does not know why this is happening ..having Lizzy was so easy. Viv reminds her they can still get another opinion. Shirley tells Saul that without Thomas they would be out on the streets. At least now they have a roof over their heads and a job. Saul says Sally was fine before Thomas came along and she will be again without him. Eric tells Thomas that Sally stole from them and she is very lucky he kept her from prison, but they need his talent here at FC where he belongs. Steffy says he is a Forrester so please say he will come back."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Thomas: Morning.", "Sally: Morning.", "Thomas: You sleep okay?", "Sally: No complaints from me.", "Thomas: Ah.", "Sally: [Giggles]", "Thomas: Ooh, coffee.", "Sally: Yes, another thing I am very good at.", "Thomas: Mm.", "Sally: Mm.", "Thomas: Mm.", "Sally: [Chuckles] Hm.", "Thomas: Mm-hmm.", "Sally: [Giggles]", "Thomas: I could order us some breakfast, if you want.", "Sally: Mmm. I wish. Pancakes sound absolutely amazing.", "Thomas: Yes.", "Sally: But I should probably get to work. [Sighs]", "Thomas: That's right. Yeah. It's a workday. I forgot. I don't have a job.", "Sally: Yeah, I still can't believe that your father fired you.", "Thomas: That was his ultimatum, though -- I pull my funding from spectra or I'm finished at Forrester.", "Sally: Well, thank you for not giving up on my little band of misfits. I just wish you didn't have to be at odds with your family.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Your brother is in bed with the enemy.", "Steffy: Dad, we're running out of time. We need help finishing the lineup.", "Ridge: We have help. Zende's stepping up. He's learning the ropes.", "Steffy: We can't do this without Thomas.", "Ridge: We're gonna have to.", "Steffy: You know, you are so stubborn.", "Ridge: I'm stubborn? That's coming from you?", "Steffy: Oh, okay. I wonder where I got that from? Hmm. I just can't believe it's come to this.", "Ridge: He gave money to spectra. He crossed the line. What do you want me to do?", "Steffy: Thomas risked everything for sally, which means he really cares about her. I don't know. It seems like something a young ridge Forrester would do.", "Ridge: I wouldn't have betrayed this company.", "Steffy: Fine. But he didn't deserve to be fired.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: Zende doesn't know we're here. I don't want him to worry. He already has a lot of pressure at work.", "Vivienne: Well, fine. But hopefully we'll have some good news for him. [Clicks tongue]", "Nicole: I hope so.", "Vivienne: [Chuckles]", "Dr. March: Nicole. It's good to see you.", "Nicole: Thank you for fitting us in.", "Dr. March: Well, dr. Caspary brought me up to speed on the issues you're having.", "Nicole: Yeah, she thinks it's some type of secondary infertility. But it can't be. I'm hoping you have better news for me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Darlita: We could send them one of those fruit baskets as a thank-you.", "Saul: Thomas? Yeah, like he needs anything else in his perfect little life.", "Shirley: He did write a check. Bailed us out. Exposed bill Spencer's sneaky real-estate scheme.", "Darlita: Thomas saved the day. He's our hero.", "Saul: Well, I don't like it. I don't want his money here. I mean, I-I do, you know, but I don't.", "Shirley: Looks like someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.", "Darlita: Mm-hmm.", "Saul: Look, who cares if he's tall or rich or handsome, or lift -- he lift -- he lifts weights? But he's not that great! He's just using his money to move in on sally.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: [Sighs] I really like lying here with you. So much that I am going to call in sick to work.", "Thomas: You don't have to do that.", "Sally: I am the reason that you're in this mess. It's the least I can do. We can lounge around, maybe watch some TV.", "Thomas: Mm.", "Sally: Take a few naps.", "Thomas: I would love nothing more than to lay around with miss go-getter all day, but I cannot let you do that. I know how much you want to get the business up off the ground. Although I do appreciate your willingness to mope around with me all day. It means a lot.", "Sally: Fine. But we do, some day, have to just be sloths and do nothing.", "Thomas: Mm. Mm-hmm.", "Sally: I'm willing to try it at least once.", "Thomas: Well, any time. My schedule is free and clear, unfortunately. I don't like fighting with my family. I really don't like getting fired by my own father.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: You shouldn't have fired Thomas. We need him. He's your son. You can't let that destroy your relationship.", "Ridge: [Sighs] I had it with him. Maybe I went too far. I don't know.", "Steffy: Yeah, you did go too far. I'm not gonna let it go further. I'm calling him for a meeting.", "Ridge: Mnh-mnh. Let me handle it.", "Steffy: No. Part of the problem is me. My position here as C.E.O. But we need to come together as a family, okay? Forrester family.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dr. March: I'm going to start the ultrasound now. See what we're dealing with. You ready?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: It's okay, sweetheart. Whatever happens, you and Zende will get through this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!", "Coco: Where'd he go? [Gasps] Where'd Charlie go?", "Charlie: Uh, I'm right here. I just...", "Coco: Oh, no. No, I know.", "Charlie: Oh, well. Of course. Forget it. It's okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: He doesn't get things.", "Charlie: No, I...", "Coco: Yeah. [Laughs]", "Pam: You know what, I can take her now.", "R.J.: Oh, no. It's okay. Nicole's down at an appointment. She asked us to babysit. So...", "Pam: Oh, no. I know that. But Maya called and asked if I'd look after Lizzy while he and rick are in Paris.", "Coco: Oh, okay.", "R.J.: Are -- are -- are you sure? I mean...", "Pam: Yeah. ...We don't mind. Oh, she's the cutest. We've been having so much fun.", "Charlie: Yeah, well, I think -- I think Pammy needs her Lizzy fix.", "Pam: Yeah. I kind of adore babies. Especially since tiny died. Oh, tiny? Her Doberman.", "Pam: Yeah. Oh, okay.", "Pam: I just miss sort of having someone to love on. Right?", "Charlie: Excuse me. What about -- what about me?", "Pam: Well, other than you, sweetheart.", "Charlie: Oh. Thanks. Awww. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've been hogging her all day. Here, you can take her.", "Pam: All right! Come here. There you go. There you go.", "[Lizzy cries] Uh-oh!", "R.J.: Oh, it's all right. Here.", "Coco: She was a little fussy in the car.", "Pam: I think it's me. It's me. [Laughs]", "R.J.: I'll take her back, how about that? We've also got some diapers and baby wipes in the bag.", "Coco: Yeah.", "Pam: All right.", "R.J.: Look at that. Aw, there we go.", "Coco: There she is!", "Pam: [Gasps] Look at that. Cheerio for you.", "R.J.: Here. Here.", "Coco: Here, you little peach. Not.", "R.J.: Oh, there we go.", "Coco: Ohh! [Chuckles] Well, it really makes me excited to be a mom someday.", "Charlie: Excuse me, do I -- do I have to have a talk with you guys?", "Coco: Oh, no. [Laughs] No, no, no. I'm talking like 10 or 20 years down the...", "R.J.: Yeah.", "[Lizzy crying]", "Pam: Don't wait too long.", "R.J.: Oh, look at this. Look at this. It's a -- oh. Cheerio. No, I think it's -- I think it's Zende and Nicole's turn to have a kid, right? I mean, it's gonna happen someday.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: Was there anything on the ultrasound?", "Dr. March: Unfortunately, there are quite a few adhesions. Evidence of scarring inside your uterus. Most likely as a result of your previous pregnancy.", "Nicole: So, dr. Caspary was right.", "Vivienne: How -- how do we fix it?", "Dr. March: Well, there's no guarantee that we can.", "Nicole: Dr. March, I will do anything. I will do whatever I have to.", "Dr. March: Nicole, I need to be honest with you. These adhesions appear to be rather severe. Areas of your uterine wall are sticking together, which can make it very difficult to treat.", "Vivienne: What about surgery?", "Dr. March: Well, that is an option, but when these fibroids -- or adhesions -- are removed, they do sometimes come back. Now, your ovaries do appear to be healthy, which means that IVF and surrogacy could still be possibilities. But there is a strong chance you won't be able to carry another child. I'm sorry, Nicole. I know this is difficult. I wish I had better news.", "Vivienne: Thank you, doctor.", "Vivienne: I am so sorry, sweetheart.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: Bad news, Saul. Now that Thomas has invested mucho dinero in the company, he's gonna be hanging around a lot more. So buck it up, buttercup.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Saul: No. Shirley, I-I don't trust that guy. I don't want him around.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Darlita: I wouldn't mind seeing him on the regular. Those eyes... those biceps... sally has got herself one hot guy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: I bet your dad will chill out. Come to his senses.", "Thomas: You don't really know my dad. There is nothing chill about him.", "Sally: Yeah, but I know you, and you are way too talented to get fired.", "[Cell phone rings]", "Thomas: Hmm. Sister. Hey.", "Steffy: Are you free today?", "Thomas: I just got fired. What do you think?", "Steffy: I'm calling granddad for a meeting to discuss that very topic. How soon can you be at the office?", "Thomas: Is dad gonna be there?", "Steffy: Of course. [Sighs]", "Thomas: Then forget it.", "Steffy: Thomas, please. I'm trying to work some things out, okay? Please say you'll come.", "Thomas: Fine.", "Sally: What'd she say?", "Thomas: They're calling a family meeting.", "Sally: They probably want you to come back.", "Thomas: We'll see about that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Lizzy yells, Charlie growls]", "Pam: Uh-oh. You want the phone, too?", "[Laughter]", "Pam: I think we got a receptionist on our hands. Thank you!", "Charlie: An adorable receptionist.", "Pam: You like that nose?", "Charlie: Ohh! Honk! Honk!", "Pam: Maybe it's for you. [Laughs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Charlie honking]", "Nicole: What's going on?", "Coco: Oh, Nicole! Hey. Uh, how was your appointment?", "Nicole: I thought you were watching Lizzy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: Yeah, we were. But I guess Maya called and, uh, wanted Pam to watch her.", "Pam: [Laughs] See? Lizzy's helping me answer the phones. Too cool. Watch. [Baby voice] Hello, this is Forrester creations. This is Lizzy Forrester speaking. How can I help you?\"", "[Pam and Charlie laugh]", "Charlie: Hello, Lizzy. This is Lola the lion.", "Pam: [Gasps]", "Charlie: Uh, listen, I would like to place an order for some Forrester \"cat- ture.\" [Laughs] Get it? \"Cat-ture,\" it's --", "Pam: [Normal voice] That's pretty good.", "R.J.: Yeah. Yeah, I got it.", "Pam: [Baby voice] He didn't mean that, really. [Smooches] I love you. [Normal voice] She is such a hoot. I could play with her all day.", "R.J.: You should've seen her this morning. Coco had her cracking up.", "Coco: Oh, my god. There's nothing better than baby giggles. Nothing.", "Charlie: Hey, hey, hey. Why don't we take her to the zoo? She could see some real lions! [Growling, roaring]", "Pam: Would you like to go to the zoo? Whoa!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: Come here, sweetie. Heh. Excuse me. Yeah. Hi. Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: [Scoffs] Nice of you to join us.", "Sally: Have any of the new machines arrived?", "Saul: Not yet.", "Shirley: Sal, weren't you wearing that outfit yesterday?", "Sally: No.", "Darlita: Did you, uh, get my text messages last night?", "Sally: Oh, I did. I did. I'm sorry. I didn't have a chance to text you back.", "Shirley: Oh. Were your hands too busy?", "Sally: Seriously, grams?", "Darlita: Well, was it fun? Did you get any sleep? I hope not.", "Saul: Okay, this is a workplace, people. Hello.", "Sally: Yes, Saul. Thank you. I could not agree more.", "Shirley: So, uh... how is Tommy-boy?", "Sally: Well, uh, his dad fired him.", "Shirley: From Forrester?", "Sally: No, from the deli down the street.", "Saul: Uh...wait. So, what does that mean?", "Darlita: Ooh, he'll be coming by more often?", "Saul: Or maybe he'll want to open up his own shop in Paris or Milan.", "Sally: I don't know what's happening. They just called him in for a meeting.", "Shirley: But what happens if they talk him into it? What happens to us?", "Sally: Well, uh, it means we're done. Spectra's finished, and so are me and Thomas, and I probably will never see him again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Thanks for coming on such short notice.", "Eric: I'm glad we're doing this. I don't want you to ruin your relationship with your son.", "Ridge: Spectra stole from us, and Thomas gave them money. It's unacceptable.", "Eric: You're right. What Thomas did was wrong. But it doesn't warrant firing him, especially at a time like this.", "Ridge: I was angry.", "Eric: Yeah. An all-too-common occurrence with you these days.", "Steffy: It's obvious there's a lot of tension and resentment right now. I-I thought Thomas' involvement with sally was because of me -- me being C.E.O., But it's not. Their feelings are real. They've been dating for months. And it's not just gonna go away.", "Eric: You can't fire Thomas because he fell in love with sally spectra.", "Ridge: That's not why I fired him. You can't defend what he did.", "Steffy: We need to get him back. Firing Thomas is only gonna push him toward spectra even more. We can't allow that to happen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: Oh, no! It says babies shouldn't eat lemon bars till they're age 2.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: Oh, poor Lizzy. Two years is a long time to wait for your lemon bars.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laughter]", "Coco: Thomas, hey!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: Hey.", "R.J.: Hey.", "Thomas: Hey, bud.", "R.J.: Good to see you, man. It's not the same around here without you.", "Thomas: Steffy called a meeting.", "R.J.: Yeah. Granddad's already inside.", "Pam: Yeah, they're inside waiting for you.", "R.J.: Good luck, man.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Thomas.", "Thomas: Hey, granddad. Stef.", "Eric: You look good.", "Thomas: Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Missed you. We all have.", "Ridge: Hello, son. Good to see you.", "Thomas: You took my job, dad. I don't know what you want me to say.", "Steffy: He made a mistake. We want you back here at Forrester creations.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: Both doctors said the same thing.", "Vivienne: Yeah, well, we'll get another opinion.", "Nicole: [Scoffs] How can this be happening? My pregnancy with Lizzy was so easy. There were no complications.", "Vivienne: None that we were aware of.", "Nicole: I can't believe it. Zende was trying to hard to be supportive of this whole thing. He knows how much I want to get pregnant. But you heard dr. March. I may never be able to carry a child.", "Vivienne: But you already have a child. She might be your sister's, but she'll always be your little girl, too.", "Nicole: My little girl. My sweet little girl.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: I'm sure they're trying to convince Thomas to change his mind.", "Darlita: About helping us?", "Sally: Yeah. They'll probably ask him to pull his money out of spectra and stop seeing me for good.", "Shirley: They can't do that. Thomas is our life raft. If they pull him, we'll go under.", "Saul: He doesn't own us, Shirley.", "Shirley: Saul, he is the reason we have jobs, we have a roof over our head. Without him, we'll be... out on the streets.", "Saul: Maybe we don't need him. Any of us.", "Sally: Look, I don't know for sure what the meeting's about, okay, and I'm hoping I'm wrong and it doesn't come to that.", "Darlita: I can't believe his own dad gave him the boot.", "Saul: [Scoffs] Yeah, well, Thomas is a Forrester, you know. They always end up sticking with their own. So don't be surprised when he leaves us high and dry.", "Sally: Then we'll figure something else out. We'll find another way to survive.", "Shirley: How? Thomas is our only hope. [Scoffs] And don't forget, you've already spent some of that dough on sewing machines. How are you fixin' to pay that back?", "Darlita: What about you, sally? You and Thomas?", "Saul: She was fine before he came along. She will be fine after he's gone.", "Darlita: You love him, don't you? Then you -- you can't lose him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: I don't condone what sally did. She stole from us. She's very lucky that we spared her from prison. But I think you've made a questionable decision here. There's a lot of that going around these days. I'm head of this family, Thomas, and I want you back here at work with us. We need your talent and your expertise now more than ever.", "Steffy: I'm with granddad. Thomas, this has gone on for way too long. And part of me is responsible. You know, I'm the one who told you that bill was after sally. And I should've kept my mouth shut. But you know me. I can't keep secrets from you.", "Thomas: No, I appreciate you being honest with me, Stef.", "Steffy: Bill used sally as a pawn in his real-estate deal. And I know that you were trying to help out. I know that you wanted to step in. And I really do admire that. But granddad's right -- there's no excuse for what sally did. And I know you two care about each other, but we care about you, and we want you here.", "Thomas: You sure about that? Dad?", "Steffy: Yes, even dad. [Sighs]", "Eric: Look, we understand there's a strong connection between you and sally. But we need you here, where you belong.", "Steffy: You're a Forrester, Thomas. And this is your home. Say you'll come back to Forrester creations."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjAAIdTPXag"}
