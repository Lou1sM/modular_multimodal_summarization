        "Bill and Brooke revel in their trip and all this adventure and fine dining in Dubai. He says an intimate setting is exceptional and he has a surprise for her. He explains all the dishes before they partake. He tells her that he likes her sense of wonderment and the look on her face and he likes putting it there. She finds a jewelry box under their dessert. She urges her to open it. It's a little something to commemorate their time here and would not forget. Wyatt tells Quinn that they need to talk. When that fevered brain of hers goes into overdrive the next thing they are in a big mess and he can't afford a big mess right now. He says he can see those wheels turning every time she looks at Ridge. He knows she is planning something, something devious and she needs to tell him right now so he can stop her. Quinn says she likes to observe human behavior; he knows that. And Ridge's reaction to Brooke marrying Bill is fascinating. He dumped Brooke and stayed away for a year and is now engaged to Katie yet he is still dictating her personal choices. She thinks Ridge and Bill should be getting married \u0096 two massive egos collide. She admits she does not want the marriage any more than Ridge does. Wyatt's father and her are not typical. The same things that repels them attracts them. It's kind of hard to wrap your head around it, but it happens every time they are together. And Bill should not be marrying anyone until they play that out to its natural conclusion. Marrying Brooke will be the biggest mistake of his life and she told him that. Wyatt says he is starting to worry about her. She is practical not delusional. She usually sees things very clearly except when it comes to his dad. She says she told him; they are not the norm so Wyatt can not judge them by ordinary criteria. Wyatt says she may feel that pull but it is not reciprocated and he hates to see her get hurt. She says he is sweet, but she can take care of herself. He warns her again and his dad and Brooke are getting married; may be already, so just let them be and do not interfere. She says maybe they will; maybe not. But even if Bill pulls it off, it won't last. She says she likes Brooke. She is no dumb blonde, but she is a romance junky with no staying power. And Wyatt's father is a different kind of animal and Brooke is not woman enough for him.",
        "Ridge joins Eric and Eric says he knows that look. It usually has Brooke on the other end of it. Ridge grouses that she is the most stubborn woman he knows. Eric wonders if this has anything to do with her marrying Bill Spencer. Ridge says she will not listen to him or anyone. And he declares he needs to find a way to stop this before she marries this clown. Eric says for someone engaged himself, he sure is invested in Brooke's marriage. Ridge says no, just Bill. He and Katie are solid. Eric says he doesn't want Brooke to marry Bill either but it's not his place to approve or disapprove and for Ridge either. Ridge says it is his place. His son is involved so he does have a say. Eric says he thinks Ridge just doesn't want Brooke married to anyone but him. Ridge reminds him that his son is involved, a young developing mind and he can't have him around that idiot. Brooke can find another man, a man of substance and integrity and that is not Spencer. He points out the way Bill manipulated Katie and how he's ready to do that again with Brooke and he will not let him slither his way back into his family. Eric says he is no fan of Bill's, but he doesn't think he has bad intent to Brooke or RJ. Ridge says there must be some way he can prove what a fraud Bill is. Brooke opens her present and finds a lovely large gold medallion necklace. She's speechless, a truly authentic Arabian piece. She's never seen anything like it. She thanks him as he slips it around her neck. He says he can't wait to put the most important piece of jewelry on her finger and that is her wedding ring. Wyatt warns his mother that she is setting herself up for a fall if she thinks Bill will leave Brooke now after months of pursuing her. She says she knows and it is unfortunate as she could have saved himself a lot of grief. Brooke is never going to be faithful to him; it is not in her genes. And Bill's ego is way too big to put up with the humiliation. She could have spared him the shame, humiliation and alimony. But maybe it's not too late. Eric asks Ridge if that is how the fight started. Ridge says Bill started talking about his position in his son's life and in Brooke's bed and somewhere in there everything went black and he hit him in the mouth. He realizes it was not the most mature time in his adult life and Brooke did get her ring back. But that shows Eric just how he feels. Eric says he knows how he feels. He still loves Brooke and she loves him. They may be with other people for a while, even marry them, but it's only temporary. He and Brooke belong together. Ridge says Eric is killing him. This is not about him and Brooke. This is about getting her away from Bill. Brooke keeps talking about how faithful Bill is, how patient and how he has proven he doesn't need other women, but inside he knows there is dirt on this guy. He just needs to figure out how to pin him down. Eric says maybe there is no dirt and he should just let this go. He honestly doesn't see any way he can stop this. He offers to do anything he can to help. Ridge gives him a hug and a quick kiss on the cheek and thanks him for listening. Ridge goes back to his laptop. Quinn tells Wyatt that he wants his parents back together, admit it. He says he always wondered why she had no boyfriends but now he knows she was holding out for his dad. She denies that; it's ridiculous. He says no, it's obvious she was reserving himself for Bill and she may have hated him for abandoning him but she cared for him deeply and still does. She scoffs that Hope has made a romantic out of him. She says the truth is Wyatt is the only guy she has ever loved. He says good because maybe it will dissuade her away from Bill. He is committed to Brooke and there is nothing Quinn can do to change that. Bill tells Brooke that he wants to give her the world. She says he has by chasing her around the world. She says but the greatest gift is his commitment to her. She doesn't have to worry about some woman lurking in the shadows trying to take him away. It's a new experience for her, to be secure in her man's love. Ridge opens the e-mail with Quinn's jewelry then spies the photo of her and Bill."

        "Bill: Trip working for you so far?",
        "Brooke: Well, this isn't just a trip. This is a different culture, another world. This is an adventure. [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: That's the idea.",
        "Brooke: Did I ever mention to you how much I love your ideas?",
        "Bill: Credit yourself for being my inspiration.",
        "Brooke: Well, this was a great idea, too. Our last meal of fine dining in Dubai before we head off to Abu Dhabi.",
        "Bill: Well, I hope you're hungry. It's exceptional.",
        "Brooke: You know what's exceptional?",
        "Bill: Hmm?",
        "Brooke: Being able to be here with you and spend some time alone.",
        "Bill: An intimate setting is perfect. I've got a little surprise for my lady.",
        "Brooke: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Okay. Oops.",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat]",
        "Quinn: Hey, sweetie.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, we need to talk.",
        "Quinn: I'm right here.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. When that fevered brain of yours goes into overdrive, you know, the next thing I know, we're in a big mess, and I can't have a big mess right now 'cause I got a lot to deal with.",
        "Quinn: It sounds like you're the one with brain fever. What do you think I'm going to do?",
        "Wyatt: I can hear those wheels turning in the meeting every time you looked at Ridge. You're planning something, something devious, and you need to tell me what it is right now so I can stop you from doing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I know this look. Usually Brooke is at the other end of it.",
        "Ridge: She is the most stubborn woman I've ever met.",
        "Eric: This wouldn't have anything to do with her plans to marry Bill Spencer, would it?",
        "Ridge: She won't listen to me, Dad. She won't listen to anyone. She's decided to live in this alternate universe where Bill is the romantic hero instead of the egomaniac that he truly is. And I got to tell you, I got to find a way to stop this before she marries this clown.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I like to observe human behavior. You know that about me.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, is that supposed to tell me something relevant?",
        "Quinn: Ridge's reaction to Brooke getting married is fascinating, don't you think? I mean, here he is, engaged to Katie after dumping Brooke in a foreign country, and then staying away for over a year, yet he still feels free to dictate her personal choices -- forbid her from Bill. You know who I think should really be getting married?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Quinn: Bill and Ridge. When two massive egos collide -- puh-pckk!",
        "Wyatt: You don't want that marriage to happen any more than Ridge does.",
        "Quinn: Yes, but I have the right to object.",
        "Wyatt: Mm. How would that work?",
        "Quinn: Well... your father and me... we aren't typical.",
        "Wyatt: No kidding.",
        "Quinn: The same thing that repels us attracts us. It's kind of hard to wrap your mind around, but it happens every single time we're together.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Quinn: And, see, Bill shouldn't be marrying anyone until we can play that out to its natural conclusion.",
        "Wyatt: I think you feel a pull that is not being reciprocated from dad, and I just want you to be careful because I don't want you to get hurt.",
        "Quinn: You're so sweet to worry. But I can take care of myself.",
        "Wyatt: Dad and Brooke are getting married. And as far as we know, they already have. Let them just be. Okay? Don't... just don't interfere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: For a man who's engaged, himself, you're awfully invested in who Brooke marries.",
        "Ridge: No, I'm not. I just don't want her to marry Spencer. Katie and I are fine. We're solid.",
        "Eric: Well, then why don't you just let Brooke do what she wants?",
        "Ridge: What are you saying? You want Bill and Brooke together? Is that what you want?",
        "Eric: No, I don't. But it's not my place to approve or disapprove, and it's not yours, either.",
        "Ridge: It is my place. My son is involved, so I do have a say.",
        "Eric: You know what I think? I think you can't stand the idea of Brooke being married to anybody but you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Oh.",
        "Bill: Mmm.",
        "Brooke: This all looks so delicious.",
        "Bill: Nice. Shukran. Want an explanation?",
        "Brooke: Oh, yes, of course.",
        "Bill: Well, I wanted you -- you know, I wanted a full spectrum here, give you a sampling of everything. This is shawarma, and that's meat roasted on a spit for up to a day. You can put it in a pita, eat it like a sandwich. Um... this is called kabsa. It's also known as machbus, and that's a combination of meat, spices, vegetables, and rice.",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Bill: This is fattoush, and it's basically salad. And, well... there's gonna be a test. I hope you're really paying attention.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: And that is ...",
        "Brooke: Kebab.",
        "Bill: Kebab!",
        "Brooke: I know that's a kebab! I recognized that, and I am so hungry! I'm just really hungry after everything we did today. Can I have a bite of something?",
        "Bill: You don't know what it is, do you?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Bill: All right. I'm gonna give you a taste. Anyway, of the shawarma...",
        "Brooke: Shawarma, yes. I want to taste the shawarma.",
        "Bill: Good?",
        "Brooke: Mmm. Fantastic.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, let's have a little taste of the kebab. Gonna use my fingers here. I know you don't mind.",
        "Brooke: Mmm. [Giggles] Wow!",
        "Bill: So good? All right.",
        "Brooke: Mm-mmm! That is amazing. You've got to try it.",
        "Bill: Use my fingers again. Oh, this so good.",
        "Brooke: Mmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: This tea is heaven. I love the mint. What?",
        "Bill: You get this look on your face when you experience something for the first time. It's like...I don't know. Wonder followed by delight. I like putting it there.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] I'm on sensory overload here. There's just so much to take in. Dubai is breathtaking. It's incredible. The architecture. And the people here, they're so warm and welcoming.",
        "Bill: Astounding beauty, unabashed luxury, detailed attention to service. And the gentleness of the people. I knew you'd love it here.",
        "Brooke: And best of all, I get to share it with you. Thank you for bringing me here.",
        "Bill: First stop on a lifelong journey. Want to try some dessert?",
        "Brooke: Oh, I want to, but I'm just so full.",
        "Bill: All right, I'm gonna bring it right over here. Mm-mmm.",
        "Brooke: Bill?",
        "Bill: Mmm! You have got to try some of this. It's so good.",
        "Brooke: What is this?",
        "Bill: Oh. That. You found that?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: That's just a -- a gift I got you, to commemorate our time here, so you would never forget.",
        "Brooke: As if I could.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Oh, Dad, come on. You got to stop that. I'm not with Brooke. I don't want to be with Brooke. I will always be her friend. I will look out for her, which is kind of what I'm doing now, but I'm with Katie.",
        "Eric: You know your own mind.",
        "Ridge: Yes, I do, thank you.",
        "Eric: Stopping Brooke from marrying Bill is strictly for her own good.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm, and for my son. That's a young, developing mind. You can't have that around an idiot.",
        "Eric: No argument there.",
        "Ridge: You see it. Why can't Brooke see it? She'll find a man. She -- she will find someone with substance and integrity, and that's not Spencer. The way he treated Katie... he's manipulating her, and now he wants to do the same to Brooke, wants to do the same to my son, and I'm not gonna let him. I'm not just gonna stand there and have him slither his way into my family.",
        "Eric: Look, Ridge, I'm no fan of Bill, but I don't believe he has any bad intent towards Brooke or R.J.",
        "Ridge: Really? That's not reassuring. We had a fight. And Brooke walked in.",
        "Eric: And she was upset with you.",
        "Ridge: Of course she was. Once again, somebody was picking on poor little Bill. Man, there's got to be something, some way I can show Brooke what a fraud Bill really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Marrying Brooke is the biggest mistake Bill could ever make, and I told him that myself.",
        "Wyatt: Wonderful.",
        "Quinn: Any friend would.",
        "Wyatt: You and dad are not friends.",
        "Quinn: You're right.",
        "Wyatt: I'm serious, Mom. I'm starting to worry about you. It's not like you to be... delusional. You're practical. You see things very clearly, except, somehow, when it comes to dad.",
        "Quinn: I told you, we're not the norm. You can't -- you can't judge us by ordinary criteria.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, dad is going to marry Brooke.",
        "Quinn: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: Even if he does pull it off, it's not going to last. I mean, look -- don't get me wrong. I like Brooke. She's no dumb blonde, but she's a romance junky. She doesn't have the staying power. And your father -- well, he's a different kind of animal, and... Brooke isn't enough woman for him.",
        "Wyatt: Mm. And you are?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Go ahead -- open it.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my gosh, Bill, that is stunning.",
        "Bill: Authentic Arabic jewelry. How could I resist?",
        "Brooke: Oh, I-I'm speechless. I've never seen anything like it.",
        "Bill: Try it on?",
        "Brooke: Yes, please.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Wow. Beautiful.",
        "Brooke: I love it. Thank you.",
        "Bill: You're welcome. I can't wait to put the really important piece of jewelry on you. A wedding ring... right here.",
        "Brooke: I can't wait to be your wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, you're setting yourself up for the fall if you think dad's gonna leave Brooke for any reason. Getting her to say yes was his sole motivation for months.",
        "Quinn: I know. I tried to talk Bill out of marrying Brooke, but... he was determined, which is unfortunate, because I could've saved him a ton of grief.",
        "Wyatt: Right. 'Cause it's so awful to be with the woman that you're crazy about.",
        "Quinn: No. Brooke is never going to stay faithful to him. She doesn't have the gene.",
        "Wyatt: Ah.",
        "Quinn: And Bill's ego is way too big to put up with the humiliation. I mean... could've spared him a lot -- shame, heartache, the alimony.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Maybe it's not too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I need something, Dad, something that will convince Brooke away from Bill. I've tried everything. Nothing's sticking. I even... took her engagement ring and brought it over to Bill's office.",
        "Eric: So that's what started the fight.",
        "Ridge: Uh, no. No, he started talking about his position in my son's life and his position in Brooke's bed, and somewhere in there, everything went black. And I hit him in the mouth.",
        "Eric: So, did she get her ring back?",
        "Ridge: Yes. Unfortunately, she did. And I'm aware that that was not the most mature moment in my adult life, but at least it tells you how I feel about all this, right?",
        "Eric: You know what it tells me? It tells me that you and Brooke still love each other, both of you. You love her. She loves you. You may be with other people for a while, you might even marry them, but it's temporary. You and Brooke belong together.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Dad, I love you, but you're killing me. This is not about me and Brooke getting back together. This is about Brooke getting away from Bill. I want what's best for her, and Spencer is not that. But now Brooke keeps talking about how faithful he is, how patient he is, how he doesn't need other women, and he's proven himself, but... inside, I know that there's dirt on this guy. I just don't know how to pin him down.",
        "Eric: Eh, maybe there isn't any dirt. Maybe you should take him at face value when it comes to Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Really? You too, huh? That's what Katie says. Says I should just let it go, that I can't stop this. Well, maybe she's right.",
        "Eric: Maybe she is. Honestly, Ridge, I don't see any way you're gonna be able to stop this. Look, uh... do anything I can do to help.",
        "Ridge: I appreciate it.",
        "Eric: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Thanks for listening.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: [Breathes deeply] Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Come on. Tell the truth -- you want to see your parents together again.",
        "Wyatt: Doesn't matter. Not gonna happen.",
        "Quinn: We'll see.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I always wondered why you didn't have any boyfriends when I was growing up, and now I know. You've been holding out for dad.",
        "Quinn: That's ridiculous.",
        "Wyatt: No. No, it's obvious. All right, you have -- you've reserved yourself for him, and you might have hated him for abandoning you, which is why you told me he was dead all those years, but you cared very deeply for him. And that never stopped.",
        "Quinn: Wow. Hope has made a romantic out of you.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: But the truth is... you're the only guy I've ever loved.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] You keep telling yourself that. You know what? You probably should. Anything that dissuades you from putting it all out there for dad, because he would just throw it right back in your face. He is committed to Brooke, and she feels the same way, and I'm sorry, but there's nothing that you can do to change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: This has been the most incredible day.",
        "Bill: Until tomorrow. You ready for Abu Dhabi?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Absolutely.",
        "Bill: I want to give you the world, Brooke. I want to be responsible for that look of wonder and delight over and over again.",
        "Brooke: You've already given me so much. Chasing me to Monte Carlo and taking me mountain climbing, bringing me to this amazing country with so much culture, a country that I really didn't know much about, this incredible piece of jewelry. But the greatest gift of all is your commitment to me. I don't have to worry about some woman lurking in the shadows, trying to take you away from me. It's a new experience, to be secure in my man's love.",
        "Bill: Even when we were apart, when you said you wanted nothing to do with me... there wasn't one day I didn't want you back, planning how to make that happen. There will never be another woman for me, Brooke. Believe that.",
        "Brooke: I do.",
        "Bill: I like the way you say that.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Just practicing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You got to be kidding me."
