    "Recap": [
        "Brooke tells Rick that he has always had a strong work ethic and she is glad his dad has been so supportive. He says he can't stay home anymore; he has to get back to work. All of this is Bill's fault for exposing Maya but he has not given up on her yet. But for the accident of him running off the road and then Ridge trying to take his position, he would still be with Maya. Brooke says she is sorry that Ridge took this opportunity to try to take Rick's job away from him. Rick says it is typical Ridge .take what he wants from anybody else no matter what they want. But this time his dad is on his side more than ever and there is nothing Ridge can do about it. Bill and Katie walk in on Liam and Ivy's frisky time. Bill wishes he had not seen that. Ivy says there is a chance that Ridge might be the next CEO. But first she would like to tell Bill that she goes on record that he should not have done what he did. He tells her jump on the bandwagon as Liam and Katie are mad at him too. In fact the whole world is. Liam says this is a case of the ends not justifying the means. Bill tells them to chill out; this is not his first rodeo. Katie reminds him that she is worried about the Spencer image and he should be too. Liam tells him about the morality clause but that Eric refuses to believe that Rick violated that.",
        "Ridge tells Steffy that he is tired of waiting for Eric to come to his senses. She agrees that he may never where Rick is concerned. Ridge says he and Caroline can design and she can help run the company. They can call the shots and put some dignity back into this company. He wants her to stay and not let Liam be a distraction to her. Rick tells Brooke that Ridge is still in the 90's and thinks his designs are the Holy Grail but he has no idea how business is run nowadays. Rick grouses all the bad things Ridge has done over the years, even taking Brooke away from Eric. She says she had some blame in that too. They hug as he says he is not forgetting Maya but he needs to get back to work and in the swing of things to keep busy. He appreciates her and Eric as they are all he has now. Steffy finally tells Ridge that she will sign on. This is what she needs. First time she had expectations but Liam is with Ivy so she can get over him and throw all her efforts into this. Ridge tells her this won't be easy but it will be worth it in the end. He calls Liam. Steffy says this time is different and they just need to keep their eye on the prize at the end. Rick comes in and is surprised to see Steffy but wishes they would not hang out in the CEO's office, his office. And it will remain as such no matter how many times Ridge goes crying to his dad. Rick even accuses him of not being a Forrester. He is a Marone and throws people away just like his bio dad did. He tells them to get out of his office and quit whining. And Ridge better check with him before continuing his artistic activities with Caroline. Bill says he wants to be there when Rick gets kicked out but Katie tells him not to get ahead of himself. Liam is surprised to see Steffy but says he is glad she is here. They explain that the talking to Eric did not work out. He is still on Team Rick and Ridge does not want to do this but he can not take it any longer. He wants to pull his resources. Steffy is in and now Liam but without Bill, he wants just Liam. He realizes he is jeopardizing his relationship with his father but he has no other options so he needs to know if Liam is in or out."

        "Ridge: I've had it. I can't deal with Rick anymore.",
        "Steffy: Well, why does Granddad keep siding with him after everything he's done?",
        "Ridge: It's complicated.",
        "Steffy: Rick doesn't deserve his loyalty.",
        "Ridge: He doesn't deserve half the things he has. My dad's house, being CEO of this company while he's running around screaming at people, treating them like garbage. [Sighs] If Dad doesn't want to do anything about it, I will. It's time, Steffy. Time to get Rick out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Are you sure you want to go to work? You're still recovering from that accident.",
        "Rick: I can't stay in this house any longer. I got to get back to the office.",
        "Brooke: You've always had such a strong work ethic.",
        "Rick: I get that from you and Dad.",
        "Brooke: I'm glad that he's being very supportive.",
        "Rick: Yeah. I'm lucky to have him on my side.",
        "Brooke: Well, he does love you. And he's very, very proud of you.",
        "Rick: You know, it could have gone either way.",
        "Brooke: Why do you say that?",
        "Rick: Ridge asked Dad to fire me so he could make him CEO.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Do you know, Miss Forrester, that when I'm with you, I can't even think of anything else?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: I can't even remember my name.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Liam: What is my name?",
        "Ivy: It's, uh, it's Chris.",
        "Liam: Chris?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. Chris from South Dakota.",
        "Liam: From -- are we role-playing right now? Is that what's happening? Should I, like, get a cowboy hat?",
        "Ivy: Do you have one of those?",
        "Liam: No, not on me. No.",
        "Ivy: Damn it. It's okay. I'll just -- I'll shut my eyes and I'll pretend that you're a cowboy with a 10-gallon hat and a sheriff's badge. A sheriff's badge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Yes. Hmm. Mm-hmm. You better watch it, little lady, or I'm gonna have to lasso you --",
        "Bill: Whoa, whoa! Easy there, cowboy!",
        "Liam: Come on! Knock, will you?!",
        "Bill: I cannot unsee that.",
        "Katie: Sorry to interrupt, but we got your text.",
        "Liam: Yeah, um... Ivy has a-a -- has news.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Good news, I hope?",
        "Ivy: I don't know. It's... there's a chance that Ridge could be the next CEO of Forrester. Actually, before we get into that, can -- can I go on the record for a second and just voice my disapproval with you?",
        "Bill: Sure. Jump on the band wagon. You're mad at me. He's mad at me. She's mad at me.",
        "Katie: The whole world's mad at you.",
        "Bill: What else is new?",
        "Liam: I'm gonna say it again. I am. You were wrong, and we never should have exposed Maya's story.",
        "Bill: Hmm. Really? So, uh, I guess if Rick is tossed out and Ridge replaces him, I was still wrong? Nah, I don't think so. End of story.",
        "Liam: Ugh! No! This is a classic case of the end not justifying the means.",
        "Katie: Really, Bill, this is serious. Spencer's getting a lot of backlash.",
        "Bill: Will you all relax?! This is not my first rodeo! If you're not shaking it up, obviously you ain't getting it done.",
        "Katie: Bill, I'm worried about Spencer's image, and you should be, too.",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Bill Spencer's the root to all of it. If he wouldn't have exposed Maya's past, I would have never gotten in a car accident, Ridge would have never made a play for my position, and Maya and I would still be together.",
        "Brooke: You can't say that for sure.",
        "Rick: The way it went down at the cabin, Maya getting upset, storming out of there, not returning any of my phone calls.",
        "Brooke: Still nothing?",
        "Rick: No. But I'm not giving up on her.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry about Ridge. Using this opportunity to take your job away from you -- that is inexcusable.",
        "Rick: Ah, it's typical Ridge. Take whatever he wants, do whatever he wants with no regard for anybody else. But this time it backfired. Dad's on my side more than ever, and there's nothing that Ridge can do about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm through waiting for Dad to come to his senses.",
        "Steffy: Doesn't sound like he ever will, at least not where Rick's concerned.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] We got to try to get some dignity back in this company. And if I don't stand up to Rick, who will?",
        "Steffy: It's got to be you.",
        "Ridge: No, it's -- it's got to be us. Caroline and I will be doing the designing, and you can help run the company. It's time. We got to take Forrester back. From here on in, we call the shots.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, if you're done bashing me, tell us why you think Ridge will be CEO.",
        "Liam: After what you did, we'll never be done bashing you.",
        "Bill: How about you just accept that you were wrong and tell me why you think Ridge will be CEO?",
        "Katie: I mean, what can he do? Rick's contract is irrevocable.",
        "Liam: Well, turns out not exactly.",
        "Bill: Since when?",
        "Liam: Since the behavioral clause. There is a morality addendum in Rick's contract. The only thing is, Eric needs to believe that Rick violated it.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, which he did about 100 times over.",
        "Bill: So, let's suppose Ridge is CEO. Where does that leave us?",
        "Liam: Uh, in a pretty damn good position.",
        "Katie: How so?",
        "Liam: Well, I still want to partner with Steffy and Ridge.",
        "Bill: What makes you think they're going to want to work with us?",
        "Liam: Because they need us. I mean, even if Ridge gets the title of CEO, he still needs Spencer shares in order to be able to have any kind of control over Eric and Rick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Ridge has got to stop trying to control everyone around him. I'm telling you, Mom, he undermines every decision I make.",
        "Brooke: He thinks he knows what's best for the company.",
        "Rick: He's still stuck in the '90s. He thinks his designs were the holy grail. He has no idea how businesses are run these days.",
        "Brooke: Well, thank God you're still the man in charge.",
        "Rick: I reminded Dad of how many bad things Ridge has done to him over the years. And worst of all, breaking up the family, taking Dad away from you.",
        "Brooke: I will always feel responsible.",
        "Rick: You shouldn't. Ridge is devious. He's -- he's manipulative. He moved right in on his father's wife, just like he did mine.",
        "Brooke: I know that must have been hurtful.",
        "Rick: He took my relationship with Caroline and he smashed it into a million pieces. He wrecked our future. And do you think he ever felt any remorse for that? Thought about me once? Do you think he'll ever feel bad about what he did to Dad? No. Because he got what he wanted.",
        "Brooke: Eric has made it very clear. He wants you in charge, not Ridge.",
        "Rick: You know, I have to admit, I kind of like the idea that Ridge has to answer to me for the rest of his career at Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Will you be able to do it?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. I just don't think I have a choice.",
        "Steffy: You had issues going behind Granddad's back before.",
        "Ridge: I still have issues with that. I don't want to be here. I don't want to be doing this. Dad's made this impossible. I don't...I don't see another solution.",
        "Steffy: Well, getting Rick out is right for all of us, and Granddad's gonna realize that someday.",
        "Ridge: You see it, right?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: I can't answer to Rick for the rest of my days just because Dad wants to punish me for what happened with Brooke years ago.",
        "Steffy: Why'd you bring that up?",
        "Ridge: I don't -- he can't get past it. He says I broke up his family then, and now I did the same to Caroline and Rick.",
        "Steffy: But, regardless, none of that justifies Rick's behavior.",
        "Ridge: I want you to be here.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Hey. I get it. I understand. You got a thing for Liam. But if you can put that on hold for a little while, because we need to focus on this, and it can't interfere. Please. I need you to be here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Well, I really should get going. I don't want anybody accusing me of slacking off.",
        "Brooke: Gee, who would say that?",
        "Rick: Well, Ridge, Ivy. Actually, a lot of people now that I think about it.",
        "Brooke: Promise me you'll take it easy. You don't need anything stressing you out.",
        "Rick: Oh, I'm sure it'll be uneventful. No big surprises.",
        "Brooke: You certainly don't need any more of those.",
        "Rick: No, but it will be nice to get back in the swing of things. I'm not forgetting about Maya. I just... I really do need to pick up the pieces and just keep on going.",
        "Brooke: I'm here for you if you need anything.",
        "Rick: You always have my back. You and Dad. You have no idea what that means to me after everything I've been going through. You're all I got. I don't know what I would do without you.",
        "Brooke: We love you. And we're very proud of you. And we believe in you. So don't you ever forget that. And don't stop believing in yourself, either.",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Ricky's got to go. And I'm sorry to do this to you. But I need your help.",
        "Steffy: You need my shares.",
        "Ridge: Yes. And your help. I want you on my team. I need your guidance.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Well, when you put it that way, how could I possibly say no?",
        "Ridge: You mean it?",
        "Steffy: You know, look, the first time I came back, I-I admit I had expectations. I thought Liam and I were gonna get back together, but now he's with Ivy, and yeah, it hurts, but I won't let that prevent me from being here, doing what's right. And you know what? I miss L.A., And this is a really good reason for me to stay. So... you got me. Where do I sign?",
        "Ridge: Thank you. I know it's not gonna be easy, but it's gonna be worth it in the end.",
        "Steffy: Who are you calling?",
        "Ridge: Liam. Hey, it's Ridge.",
        "Liam: Hi. Uh... how's it going?",
        "Ridge: I would love to talk to you. Can you come over to Forrester, please?",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll -- I'll -- I'll be right there.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Bill: Who was that?",
        "Liam: Ridge.",
        "Ivy: What did he say?",
        "Liam: He wants to see me.",
        "Bill: He's ready to talk.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I guess we'll find out.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Bill: Go get him.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Do you think he's gonna make a deal?",
        "Bill: Why else would Ridge be calling?",
        "Katie: Let's not jump to conclusions.",
        "Bill: Let's suppose he is. You cool with that?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Bill: Because last time, Steffy wouldn't agree to a deal unless she and Liam were together.",
        "Ivy: Well, that was last time. And it didn't really work out for her then, and it won't this time, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Yeah, it sure would be something, wouldn't it, working side by side with you every day. You know how much you mean to me, right? You know how grateful I would be to run this company with you. You're one of the smartest people I've ever met, Steffy. Put you in charge, and damn!",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: And to live with you on top of it, to be your husband... to touch you again... it'd be really, really good. And I think we would make it work this time.",
        "Steffy: We would.",
        "Liam: But...",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Ivy. You're really that committed to her?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: What'd Liam say?",
        "Ridge: He's on his way.",
        "Steffy: He doesn't know I'm in town.",
        "Ridge: He'll know soon enough. You gonna be able to handle it?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, of course. Whatever it takes.",
        "Ridge: You know I wouldn't have asked if I didn't think it was gonna work.",
        "Steffy: No, don't. You don't -- you don't have to worry about me. I'm -- I'm good. We just got to keep our eye on the endgame.",
        "Ridge: The endgame. That's what we'll do.",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Rick: Steffy. I didn't realize you were back in LA.",
        "Steffy: Oh, are you bummed?",
        "Rick: It's always a pleasure. I just wish you two weren't hanging out in here.",
        "Ridge: Come on, Ricky. Everyone uses this office every now and then.",
        "Rick: Excuse me? Try to have a little respect, Ridge. This is the CEO office. This is my office. And no matter how many times you go crying to Dad, it's always gonna stay that way.",
        "Rick: I didn't think you'd go so low, kick a man while he's down.",
        "Ridge: I went to Dad on behalf of the company.",
        "Rick: That's funny. You're still -- you're still referring to him as \"Dad.\"",
        "Ridge: Oh, boy, here we go.",
        "Rick: You're all Marone, buddy. Just like Massimo, the way you use people and just throw them away. You're no Forrester. There's nothing, uh, particularly sophisticated about you.",
        "Ridge: No, you're right. I'm not like you at all. I didn't go shooting up the office or go crashing my car in a fit of road rage.",
        "Steffy: Or conning your own father into making you CEO.",
        "Rick: What do you know about it, Steffy? You haven't even been around.",
        "Steffy: Well, I'm here now!",
        "Rick: Me, too! For years to come! Right here behind this desk running this company! Oh, and if, uh, you want to continue your artistic passions with Caroline, you'll have to go through me. There's no other way around it. Dad gave me his full endorsement. So do me a favor. Drop it, quit your whining, and accept reality. That goes for you, too, Steffy. Now, please... get out of my office.",
        "Ridge: I'm not gonna talk to Dad about this anymore. I thought we could handle this differently, but it's obviously a lost cause.",
        "Rick: Dad's always gonna have my back, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I know. I can -- I can see that now. I didn't see it before, but I definitely see it now. So I'll just do what I can to help move this company forward.",
        "Rick: Bravo. Good for you. Someone's finally learning how to man up.",
        "Ridge: Enjoy that desk. Did a lot to get it.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I really want to be there when Rick gets blindsided, watch his little pin head explode.",
        "Katie: All right, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's just wait until we hear from Liam.",
        "Bill: Nephew or not, you know Rick's got to go. Now, obviously Ridge has had a change of heart. Let's just hope that Steffy doesn't put the brakes on it.",
        "Katie: Well, last I heard, she was still in Paris.",
        "Ivy: Well, as far as I know, she's not in LA, and that is fine by me. As secure as I am in my relationship with Liam, I'm not gonna stand for someone making moves on him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: God, he is so arrogant!",
        "Ridge: Yes, he is. And it's all about the change.",
        "Steffy: As far as I'm concerned, Rick deserves what's coming to him.",
        "Liam: Hey, Pam said I -- hi.",
        "Steffy: Hi.",
        "Liam: It's, uh... what a surprise. Good to see you.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, you -- you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Well, thanks for coming.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. N-no problem. Uh, Ivy filled me in. She said that you might have made some headway with Eric with the morality clause.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, no, no, that didn't, uh, didn't work out the way I planned.",
        "Liam: You're kidding me.",
        "Steffy: Granddad's still on team Rick.",
        "Liam: Sorry to hear that.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, me, too. Put me in a tough spot.",
        "Liam: I can imagine.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I don't want to hurt my dad. I don't want to let him down. But I-I can't deal with Rick anymore, so I think this is the time...to pool our resources. Your shares and ours.",
        "Liam: Well, yeah. That -- that's what I was gunning for all along, but you --",
        "Steffy: I'm in. No conditions this time. I want to do what's best for this company.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Before we go any further, I got to say something. I like you. But I don't want Bill anywhere near this thing, all right? You and you alone. No exceptions. I'm about to jeopardize my relationship with my father, because I don't have any other options. So this is it, Liam. This is our chance to take over Forrester. What do you say? Yes or no?"
