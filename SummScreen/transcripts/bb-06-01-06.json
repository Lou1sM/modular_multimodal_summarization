        "In the morning, Taylor watches as Stephen sleeps in her bed. At home Brooke prepares to leave for the office when Nick comes in. At Forrester, Stephanie, Ridge, Eric and Thorne are gathered in Brooke's office talking excitedly about Brooke's first day. Taylor quietly sits a cup of coffee on the nightstand as he wakes up and tells her that it's perfect. Brooke tells Nick that she thought all night about what he said, but she cannot go through with firing the Forrester's. Nick is surprised, because she had agreed with him the night before. Thorne voices concern over what could be keeping Brooke. Eric wonders if she has changed her mind, but Ridge is confident that she will be there.",
        "Taylor questions Stephen about the reasons that they made love the night before. Taylor fears that he was just feeling sorry for her, but Stephen assures her that it was more than that and that it's all about new beginnings for both of them. They kiss and ignore the ringing phone, not realizing it's Stephanie. Ridge finally calls Brooke to ask her where she is. Brooke tells him that she will be there shortly. When she hangs up she continues to list the reasons why she can't fire the Forresters. Nick counters her reasoning by reminding her of how many times she has been manipulated by them. Stephen comes in and asks if Brooke knows about her control of Forrester. Nick tells him that she cannot go through with the firing. Stephen reminds Brooke of all the trouble the Forresters have caused all of them over the years. Brooke reluctantly leaves for the office. Taylor is surprised to find a delivery of flowers for her from Stephen and card telling her that he looks forward to seeing him again. When Brooke arrives, Stephanie, Ridge and Eric welcome her warmly. But, Brooke tells them to sit at the conference table because she has to tell them something. Brooke explains that Taylor has sold her shares of stock to her. Horrified, Stephanie slowly realizes what this means as Brooke tells them that they are FIRED !!!"

        "Stephen: Good morning.",
        "Taylor: I wasn't sure how you like your coffee.",
        "Stephen: Oh -- it's perfect.",
        "Taylor: Stephen -- about last night -- I -- I can't believe what happened.",
        "Stephen: Well, it definitely was unexpected.",
        "Taylor: But definitely wonderful.",
        "Stephen: Uh, yeah.",
        "Taylor: But it's -- it's not like me.",
        "Stephen: You're not usually wonderful?",
        "Taylor: We hardly know each other. And you're Brooke's dad.",
        "Stephen: And you're Ridge's ex-wife.",
        "Taylor: I mean, if two people weren't meant to end up in bed together --",
        "Stephen: But we did.",
        "Taylor: It's just that -- you know, I was -- I've just been at this really vulnerable place in my life. And I have felt really alone and you were here -- I mean, you were here for me.",
        "Stephen: Taylor, we shared something last night. We didn't expect it. But I, for one, don't regret it.",
        "Taylor: Oh, I'm not saying that.",
        "Stephen: But you're trying to explain it. And some things just can't be explained.",
        "Taylor: Don't try to tell me it was fate, or something that just happened.",
        "Stephen: Well, it just did.",
        "Taylor: Well, that's something like Brooke would say. It must be in the DNA.",
        "Stephen: Now, don't do that.",
        "Taylor: What?",
        "Stephen: Cover your nerves with sarcasm. And don't write off what happened last night to some errant impulse, either. I'm renewing my relationship with my daughter. You're cutting all your ties with the Forrester family. We're putting our pasts behind us, we're getting on with our lives. And when you do that -- Taylor, when you do that, good things can happen. They can. The right things can come into your life. Convinced, them I'm happy to oblige.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Hey, thanks, Tom.",
        "Eric: She's not here yet?",
        "Ridge: No, not yet.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, good. Then we're not too late to welcome her.",
        "Ridge: Okay, let's all not jump on her about her plans, okay? She needs time to get settled. Brooke's not going to be making any major decisions today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Fire the Forresters. Fire the Forresters?",
        "Nick: Hey. Just -- you look great.",
        "Brooke: Thanks.",
        "Nick: I just wanted to touch base with you before you headed into the office.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, I'm not sure I'm going.",
        "Nick: Brooke -- now, listen. You have got to get these people out of that company and out of your life.",
        "Brooke: Ridge is R.J.'s father. And Eric and Stephanie, they're R.J.'s grandparents.",
        "Nick: Well, that's -- that's fine. They can see him whenever they want. You just don't have to see them every day.",
        "Brooke: Eric founded the company. It's his company.",
        "Nick: No, Brooke, it's your company. You hold controlling interest.",
        "Brooke: His name's above the door!",
        "Nick: Oh, for -- it's a brand name! A brand that you helped make successful. You're the one who came up with the belief line, right? And all of the other successful lines. You have every right to fire them.",
        "Brooke: But I can't. I can't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: Remember, I told you that things would get better.",
        "Taylor: I just didn't expect them to get better so quickly -- and fast -- I mean, soon.",
        "Stephen: Are you trying to tell me something?",
        "Taylor: It's just that \"quickly\" is not exactly the adverb I would use to describe what happened last night.",
        "Stephen: So how would you describe what happened last night?",
        "Taylor: Extremely -- impressive.",
        "Stephen: Oh. Well, now I don't know whether I'm encouraged or insulted.",
        "Taylor: Insulted?",
        "Stephen: Well, if you were that impressed, it means you weren't expecting all that much.",
        "Taylor: No. No. It's just that I -- I am very well aware of the Logan's seductive powers. I just -- I never really expected to fall prey to it myself. It's just strange -- it's just -- it's really strange. You and me? I mean, I would have never thought. I mean, who would possibly --",
        "Stephen: You know -- maybe -- maybe you think too much. Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Stephanie: Taylor is so obviously ignoring my phone calls.",
        "Ridge: Maybe she needs time to cool down.",
        "Stephanie: She believes I abandoned her. And I think what I have to do is not keep my distance. Thank you.",
        "Eric: Taylor will come around. We'll keep calling her. Somebody will get through to her.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, keeping up the pressure definitely worked on Brooke.",
        "Stephanie: Shouldn't she be here by now?",
        "Ridge: She's running a little late, that's all.",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, but on the first day that she's CEO?",
        "Ridge: Mother, relax. She'll be here. She'll show up. You'll get in touch with Taylor, too. Just relax.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I can't fire Stephanie and Eric from a company that they created.",
        "Nick: And what about Ridge?",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry. I can't fire anybody.",
        "Nick: Brooke, we talked about this. We agreed on this.",
        "Brooke: I know, I know. I just don't feel good about it. I was up all night.",
        "Nick: Well, I'm gonna be up every night until I know that not one of those Forresters can manipulate you or hurt you. Look, I know that you want to believe that -- [Nick laughs] -- That Stephanie's changed. That she's gonna give you all of this love and respect that you so desperately want.",
        "Brooke: She already has.",
        "Nick: But how long? How long, Brooke? Do you think she's gonna be nice to you once she realizes that you are not going back to her son? It's going to be a battle everyday in that office. Now, is that what you want?",
        "Brooke: No. But if I launch a preemptive strike, I could start world war iii. And I don't want that either. Nick, I don't want to disappoint you.",
        "Nick: Honey, this isn't about me, or what I want. This is about protecting you and having you move forward. Now, I know you're scared, I know you are scared to death, but you don't have to be afraid of them because you control their destiny, they don't control yours.",
        "Brooke: But if I fire them, I will give them a really good reason to hurt me.",
        "Nick: I will be beside you every step of the way.",
        "Brooke: This company isn't just a business to them, nick. It's who they are. I mean, Forrester Creations without the Forresters, that just doesn't make sense.",
        "Nick: It will.",
        "Brooke: They were my family.",
        "Nick: Brooke, they abused you every step of the way. And it's going to happen again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Brooke: Hello?",
        "Ridge: Logan. Late for work on your first day, huh?",
        "Brooke: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: You know, I'd threaten to dock your pay, but you're the boss.",
        "Brooke: Sorry. I'll be there soon.",
        "Nick: I love you, and I'm sorry you're in this spot. But you got to end it. You got to end it now.",
        "Ridge: Brooke'll be here soon.",
        "Thorne: You think she's having second thoughts?",
        "Stephanie: About her dream job? No.",
        "Thorne: Well, if Nick is giving her a hard time with it.",
        "Eric: You know, Thorne might be right about that. He's had a night to think on it. He may not be feeling as supportive today.",
        "Ridge: Oh, he wasn't being supportive. He's just trying to do whatever he could to keep his hand in the game.",
        "Thorne: Do you think she would leave him for this job?",
        "Ridge: If he threatens her dream, tries to take away the one thing in the world that matters most to her? What do you think?",
        "Stephanie: Maybe that's the realization he had yesterday. It accounts for that sudden change of heart.",
        "Ridge: Poor sap doesn't realize he's gonna lose her anyway. Brooke and I start working here again, get back to that old creative rhythm, we'll connect again. We always do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Nick, it's not that easy.",
        "Nick: I never said that it was gonna be.",
        "Stephen: Good morning. So, did you tell her?",
        "Nick: We're still talking.",
        "Brooke: Nick says that this was your idea.",
        "Stephen: Congratulations, sweetheart. Forrester Creations is your company again. You are in charge. You can do whatever you want.",
        "Brooke: Or whatever you want me to do.",
        "Stephen: All I want is for you to be happy. I finally found a way to start making up for all the pain that I've caused my little girl.",
        "Nick: She's against firing the Forresters.",
        "Stephen: I thought you'd be jumping for joy.",
        "Brooke: Why? Because I have the means to make Ridge and his family miserable?",
        "Stephen: No, because you have the ability to set yourself free. You can't even imagine that, can you? Finally being free of the family and all unhappiness that they brought you.",
        "Brooke: Dad, they gave me half their company.",
        "Stephen: Yes, and there is a way seeing that as something that they done that's decent for once. But it doesn't make up for all the horrible things they have done in the past. It's the same with you and me. I don't expect this to magically renew our relationship. Getting you Taylor's stock is just the first small step.",
        "Brooke: Well, maybe it's the same for Stephanie.",
        "Stephen: What does your gut tell you?",
        "Brooke: That's it's still going to take some time for me to be able to trust them again.",
        "Stephen: You don't trust them because you know their goodwill won't last.",
        "Nick: Brooke, you can't trust them, you can't work with them.",
        "Stephen: And at the end, all you are going to find is more heartbreak and betrayal. And I don't want that for you, honey.",
        "Nick: Neither do I.",
        "Stephen: But you're the only one that can keep it from happening. Brooke, look at our history with that family. With you and the children, and your mother and me. It's time to stand up, Brooke, for yourself and for everyone else that family has victimized.",
        "Brooke: I don't want to punish them.",
        "Stephen: If you don't get them out of your life, you're going to be punishing yourself. And setting yourself up for more disappointment.",
        "Nick: Tell me you see that Brooke? Tell me you see why you can't work with them.",
        "Stephen: Honey, I know this seems harsh, but you've got to understand.",
        "Nick: It may seem like we're ganging up on you.",
        "Brooke: No, you're just trying to protect me.",
        "Nick: You need to protect yourself here. It's the only way to do it.",
        "Stephen: Brooke, don't get sucked into a debate. You tell them that you own 52% and drop the ax.",
        "Brooke: Fire the Forresters from Forrester Creations.",
        "Stephen: You can do this.",
        "Nick: I love you.",
        "Brooke: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delivery man: Flowers for Dr. Taylor Hayes.",
        "Taylor: Oh. Hold on, let me just get some change.",
        "Delivery man: It's all been taken care of, ma'am. Have a nice day.",
        "Taylor: Thank you.",
        "Taylor: \"Looking forward to seeing you again, Stephen.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Hey, welcome back, Logan.",
        "Eric: Did the press give you a bad time on the way into the building?",
        "Stephanie: I think they're as excited as we are that you're back.",
        "Brooke: Wow, the office.",
        "Ridge: Your office.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my things.",
        "Eric: Yeah, and ridge brought all this stuff from the basement.",
        "Stephanie: We wanted you to get back to work as fast as possible. Does this bring back old memories? Remember when you did these scandal photographs I was so angry about them? What a waste of time and energy on my part. I'm saying it again, whatever you want to do, I'm behind you 100%.",
        "Ridge: So, what do you think?",
        "Brooke: You really didn't need to go all this trouble.",
        "Ridge: Well, I thought it would be a good idea just to suck up to the boss a little bit.",
        "Eric: Thorne is busy fielding all the international calls from the press, but he made me promise to give you this.",
        "Ridge: They would have asked you for a quote, but I think we gave far too many as it was.",
        "Stephanie: Look that's just window dressing. The real story is this. We have gotten so many phone calls from our major retailers. They want to know when we are going to launch the shows, when we are going to launch the product --",
        "[Brooke remembering]",
        "Stephen: Don't get sucked into a debate. You tell them that you own 52% and drop the ax.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, hang on a minute. Could we all sit down at the conference table? There is something we need to discuss.",
        "Stephanie: Sure.",
        "Eric: Sure. You haven't changed your mind, have you?",
        "Brooke: No! There is just something that I need to explain. Last night, my father and nick -- my father, he met with Taylor. Taylor signed over her shares of Forrester Creations to me. Nick transferred the money into her account. The transaction is complete.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my God.",
        "Brooke: Believe me, this is really one of the hardest things that I've ever had to do. But I have to do it.",
        "Ridge: Logan, what are you talking about?",
        "Brooke: As CEO of this company and majority stockholder of this company, I am officially terminating your contracts. You're fired."
