    "Recap": [
        "Eric is getting the message, Ridge and Liam are going to take him down. He is ashamed of Ridge and his infantile fascination and jealousy of his little brother for that big old desk out there. Eric says it is some fantasy as neither of them can remove Eric. He has the loyalty of all the employees out there. One word from him and they will all walk and Ridge will have nothing to sell. Steffy says this does not have to be this big .no one has to leave. She can not stand this battle of the male egos. Eric says he guesses they want him to clean out his office. Ridge says he does not have one ..he gave it to Rick. Eric grouses that as long as he has a breath in his body Rick will keep it. Rick tells Maya this is worth fighting for if she still wants to. He says he may not always say the right things but he feels the right thing. Carter tells Nicole not to take this on. It was not her fault. It was for Maya to tell and she didn't. He gives her an envelope full of money and says Maya is leaving Los Angeles so Nicole needs to start a bank account if she does not have one. She gives the money back and says she only wants her sister. Carter tells her it is probably too late.",
        "Rick tells Maya that it makes him scared too in knowing people are talking about them and the most intimate parts of their body. She says she knows and that is why she could not tell him before now as there is no book how to tell people you are trans. She is hurt when he tells her that he did not turn her down .he ran off the road and was pretty banged up but has been trying to reach her ever since. Bill is happy to hear that Liam set things in motion. Katie tells Ivy not to worry about Steffy being back in town. Everyone knows how she operates. Katie fields questions over the phone about the transgender community. Eric calls Rick and says Ridge has made his move and wants them both to leave. He is in the CEO office and has locked the doors. Rick tells Maya that he loves her and this is not over but he needs to go be with his dad in this time of trouble. But he needs her promise that she will stay here and be there when he returns. Steffy tells Ridge that she feels bad for her granddad but he must realize this is not about him but about Rick. Ridge says this goes back way further, back to his mother. It was never discussed around the dinner table but he knew he was not Eric's son yet her favorite. Eric tells Rick what difference does it make; the other side has all the votes. They discuss Bill who would like his foot in the door. Eric asks what is he thinking. Bill breaks out the champagne for Liam doing something the rest of them couldn't. Liam says he needs to have a conversation with Ivy now that Steffy is back. Rick looks up on line and sees no certificates have been traded so they need to suck it up to Bill not to side with Ridge. Ridge tells Steffy that this is their legacy .hers tomorrow and his today finally."

        "Eric: My time is over -- are those the words you just said to me?",
        "Ridge: You brought this on yourself. You do know that, right?",
        "Eric: So, I'm doing this?",
        "Liam: I should own that I am the one who started all this the last time Steffy came to town.",
        "Eric: So, the two of you and Spencer here have been planning to take me down ever since then?",
        "Liam: No, no, no. Mr. Forrester, this was never about you. It's that you're protecting Rick.",
        "Eric: This is not about me? It's not about me?! No, you're absolutely right. It's not about me. It's not about you. It's about you and this infantile insecurity you have about your little brother and the success he's had behind the big desk out there. I'm ashamed of you. What would your mother say about this?",
        "Ridge: I think she would jump for joy.",
        "Maya: Baby sister strikes again, huh?",
        "Rick: Don't blame Nicole. You know how stubborn I can be. Maya... were you ever gonna tell me?",
        "Maya: Rick, someone will see us.",
        "Rick: There's not all that much left to be curious about.",
        "Maya: Sometimes you have to step back.",
        "Rick: I understand. You never used to hide. You've always been so proud. Your eyes would say, \"look all you want, world.\" That's your birthright. It's mine, too. Hell, it's everybody's. But it's also something worth fighting for. [Voice breaking] Please don't go.",
        "Nicole: Since I'm the one who started all of this, I just --",
        "Carter: No. No. Don't take this on. Bill Spencer did the damage, not you.",
        "Nicole: I was mad at Rick. I was thinking of devastating things to say to him. But when he told me that he never wanted to break up with Maya, I mean, didn't I have to tell him where she is?",
        "Carter: If she's still there. Your sister gave me this for you. If you don't have a bank account, start one.",
        "Nicole: But what is this for?",
        "Carter: To make sure you're okay. She's leaving los Angeles.",
        "Rick: How many messages did I leave?",
        "Maya: I turned my phone off, so... too much press.",
        "Rick: You handed in your resignation. Do you remember that first day here -- our first day -- when you thought that I was a waiter?",
        "Maya: Yes.",
        "Rick: Remember how upset you were when you found out I wasn't what you thought? Can't I be allowed a reaction, too?",
        "Maya: Rick... it's just not the same thing. You assumed I was a woman, and I am.",
        "Rick: You're right. You're right. And probably buried somewhere in my head are these hand-me-down ideas of how things are supposed to be. But can you be patient with me? I may not say... or do all the right things, but I feel the right things.",
        "Maya: You did... until the whole world knew.",
        "Katie: Yes. I agree. Whoever wrote that headline should be fired, and we are. We are in communication with the transgender community. Or at least we should be.",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Katie: Oh, hi. Liam's not back yet.",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah. I know. I thought I'd wait for him in his office. But, hey, he could have a new office at Forrester.",
        "Katie: So...it's done -- the takeover?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Apparently so... all thanks to guess who's back from Paris again.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: This -- this is a pipe dream... some kind of revenge fantasy of yours. You can't remove me.",
        "Ridge: This... is about ownership. I own 20%... Steffy has 25%... we have Thomas' proxy for 5%... and Liam controls his father's 12.5%. So, we are revoking your power to name the next C.E.O. Of this company.",
        "Eric: The hell you are. I have the loyalty of all those employees out there. You know what they think of you? They think of you as some kind of entitled egomaniac. One word from me, and they all walk. I hope the three of you can sew.",
        "Ridge: You're right, dad. The employees worship you. And if you ask them to leave, 8 out of 10 would. And we would replace them.",
        "Liam: This is getting too hypothetical.",
        "Ridge: And this is really how you want to reward them for their loyalty? You want to leave them jobless?",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. No one is walking out. This doesn't have to be a catastrophe or some big change. Rick is out, and that's all.",
        "Eric: Rick's contract is ironclad.",
        "Ridge: Yes, it is, except for one thing -- morality clause.",
        "Eric: What about your morality?!",
        "Steffy: Granddad, I know you're gonna be angry with us for a while, all right?",
        "Eric: You know, it just occurred to me... I wish you were more like your mother.",
        "Nicole: I don't want money. I want my sister.",
        "Carter: This has got nothing to do with me, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: We have to tell Maya not to leave.",
        "Carter: Either she already left or Rick's with her. If he can't change her mind, you and I can't.",
        "Rick: I've got to be real honest with you, and it's probably gonna come out badly.",
        "Maya: I'm not policing you.",
        "Rick: The same thing that happens to you happened to me. You said that you were afraid that I would think about you differently.",
        "Maya: When people find out that I'm trans, they get this look. They stop looking me in my eyes.",
        "Rick: See, the same thing happened to me when I found out what Spencer had done and that everybody knew and they were thinking about it and they were talking about us and our bodies and all our most intimate moments. And, Maya, it made me scared.",
        "Maya: It's demeaning.",
        "Rick: Is that why it took you so long -- 'cause you didn't want me looking at you that way?",
        "Maya: That doesn't matter. I owed it to you anyway.",
        "Rick: Yeah. I think you did.",
        "Maya: You know, Rick, when -- when I moved to L.A., Everyone knew all of the basic facts about me, and then when Dayzee left, almost no one knew and no one asked any questions, and I thought it was a good thing. And then I fell in love. And now there's no rulebook that tells you when you're supposed to say things and how much. And I just didn't see how much I was cutting myself off from you and how I couldn't tell you about my childhood and my teenage years and the time I climbed up onto the railing of a bridge, and it took a long time to come down.",
        "Rick: You see, I want to know these things. I don't like feeling cheated.",
        "Maya: We can keep in touch if that's something you'd like.",
        "Rick: Maya. Maya, why do you think I'm here?",
        "Maya: I don't know -- closure? [Crying]",
        "Rick: I never heard the question. When you were on the phone and you were leaving big bear, you asked me something. What was that?",
        "Maya: [Crying] If you still -- if you still love me, if you wanted to marry me.",
        "Rick: [Crying] You see, I never heard that. My car went off the road. I got -- I got pretty banged up.",
        "Maya: What? I-I thought --",
        "Rick: Do you want to ask me again?",
        "Ivy: I don't think Eric knows what's going on yet.",
        "Bill: That's my boy! But Liam better get something in writing. I mean, when Ridge actually makes a decision, it always has a short shelf life. Now, I'm assuming that Steffy dropped a certain precondition or we wouldn't be hearing about this from you.",
        "Ivy: Well, as far as I know, it was just a change of strategy.",
        "Katie: Don't let Steffy worry you. Everyone knows how she operates.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but I don't think she does. I mean, in her mind, she's just on the up and up -- you know, blazingly honest and all that.",
        "Bill: So, Rick finally learned that he can't treat a niece of mine like garbage.",
        "Katie: When are you gonna stop using Caroline to justify what you did to Maya?",
        "Bill: That head case? She's a fraud. Me? What you see is what you get.",
        "Steffy: We can finish this conversation later.",
        "Eric: I think any conversation that you and your father want to have with me is pretty much over.",
        "Liam: Mr. Forrester, if I'm not mistaken, everyone here tried to tell you how bad things were under Rick, and you didn't believe them.",
        "Eric: I'm disappointed in you.",
        "Ridge: Oh, God.",
        "Eric: No surprise here.",
        "Ridge: Enough! Stop! That's enough! Call it karma. Call it whatever you will. But any vote that you took, any decision that you made about Rick, all led you to right here!",
        "Liam: Hold on a second. Wait. This is not retributive.",
        "Steffy: Okay! I can't take this battle of male egos, all right?! Nobody died.",
        "Eric: I suppose you want me to clear out my office.",
        "Ridge: You don't have an office! You gave it to Rick.",
        "Eric: And as long as I have breath in my body, he's gonna keep it.",
        "Ridge: No, I'm sorry. That experiment is over.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: So, you're okay?",
        "Rick: It depends.",
        "Maya: I am so sorry. I honestly thought that you--",
        "Rick: No, no, no. I get it. And maybe you think that the future doesn't hold anything good for you. But we're gonna have to unconvince you of that.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rick: Don't leave.",
        "Maya: It could be work.",
        "Rick: No. You know what? Work can wait.",
        "Maya: They'll just call you back.",
        "Rick: Dad?",
        "Eric: Well, Ridge has done it, or at least he thinks he has.",
        "Rick: Done what?",
        "Eric: He found a way to get you out of the company, and me, too.",
        "Rick: Ridge is obviously bluffing. Where are you?",
        "Eric: I'm in the C.E.O. office, but the door's locked.",
        "Rick: I'll be there as soon as I can.",
        "Maya: What about Ridge?",
        "Rick: Apparently, he's come up with some way to fire my dad and replace me.",
        "Maya: You can't let him do that. You've worked too hard for this.",
        "Rick: Yeah. We're not finished here.",
        "Maya: I'm fine. You go. This is more than a job. I know how much this means to you. So, you go back there, and you do whatever you have to do to stop Ridge.",
        "Rick: Promise me that you'll still be here.",
        "Maya: I'll take my pack and I'll go upstairs and I'll wait to hear from you. You take care of business first. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Rick: And to answer that question... the one that I didn't hear... I love you, Maya.",
        "Steffy: Well, that wasn't easy.",
        "Ridge: You thought it was gonna be easy?",
        "Steffy: I feel for granddad. But he has to realize this isn't about him. This is about Rick.",
        "Ridge: Ah, it goes further back than that.",
        "Steffy: You mean Brooke? Mom?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I think that had something to do with it. But it goes further back than that... all the way to my mom and who she loved most.",
        "Ridge: That question was always around but never asked around the dinner table. But it was always there. But my mom -- she knew something that dad and I did not... that I was her biological son but not his. And that colored everything -- the way she treated us, the way we treated each other. And you know what, Stef? Looking back, I-I think my dad and I -- we never had a chance.",
        "Steffy: Well, if you're not his son... I'm not his granddaughter. I suppose we're disowned after today.",
        "Eric: Ridge is probably having Carter draw it up as we speak.",
        "Rick: Ridge controls the legal department through him. Still, we'll have to have a formal meeting, all the shareholders represented, voting on the record. I mean, we have till then.",
        "Eric: What difference would it make? They have the votes.",
        "Rick: Thomas is irrelevant. His holdings aren't enough for Ridge and Steffy to take controlling interest. Why was Liam there? What, Bill couldn't make time in his busy schedule?",
        "Eric: Ridge isn't gonna want to do business with Bill. They hate each other.",
        "Rick: So, what -- Liam bought all his dad's shares? Where'd he get that kind of cash?",
        "Eric: I don't know. I didn't ask. I doubt it was an outright purchase.",
        "Rick: Bill likes having his foot in the door here. He wouldn't just give that away.",
        "Eric: What? What are you thinking?",
        "[Cork pops]",
        "Bill: There we go. So, how'd Eric take it?",
        "Liam: Uh, I'm not gonna lie. It was -- it was bad.",
        "Bill: Well, he'll get over it. You're a genius.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, well, I'm also vice president, or I will be when it's official. How are we gonna deal with that?",
        "Bill: Listen, what you can't cover, Katie will handle. She loves being overworked. To you. Rick is out. You accomplished what the rest of us could not.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Including you outing Maya, by the way.",
        "Bill: Mm. Well, that gave it a little nudge. And listen -- when you publish the truth, there's always a certain amount of outrage. It goes with the territory. Uh, speaking of outrage, Ivy was here.",
        "Liam: Oh, God. I got to have a conversation with her now that Steffy's back. But you know what? You know, I did it. I told her I would get her and Caroline out of harm's way, out of Rick's way, and I did it.",
        "Bill: Feels good, doesn't it -- winning and winning big?",
        "Liam: Yeah, it kind of does.",
        "Bill: There may be hope for you yet.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: You see, look here, dad. There's been no sales. Now, if certificates changed hands, we would be seeing Liam's name on it.",
        "Eric: And it still has Bill's.",
        "Rick: I knew he wouldn't give up those shares out of the kindness of his heart. You know what he's doing. He's laying low because he knows that Ridge won't play if he's on his team. And Ridge is so darn arrogant, he didn't bother double-checking.",
        "Eric: You can't be thinking what I think you are.",
        "Rick: What other choice do we have but to suck it up and negotiate with Bill not to vote with Ridge?",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Ridge: You're next -- next C.E.O. of Forrester.",
        "Steffy: I am... assuming you will ever give me the reins.",
        "Ridge: I will. I'm not gonna do what my dad did -- throw himself a retirement party and then show up at work the next day.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Hey... this is it. This is our legacy... yours tomorrow... mine today.",
        "Steffy: Finally.",
        "Ridge: Finally."
