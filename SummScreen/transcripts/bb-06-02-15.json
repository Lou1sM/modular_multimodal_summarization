    "Recap": [
        "Ridge watches Caroline sleep and gently wakes her up. She said she had physical therapy and fell asleep. Rick tells Eric that he did more research last night and he found nothing to back that Ridge has control of Bill's shares. So that is their long shot, the only one they have. Katie walks in on Liam being measured for a new suit since Bill thinks he needs one with his new title. Ivy confronts Steffy about the takeover and her staying in L.A. Liam asks Katie what does she know about Steffy that they don't. She knows Steffy had a big assist in helping Ridge and she is used to getting her way. And she thinks Ivy is pretty gutsy herself so how is Liam going to feel working with Steffy and being involved with Ivy too. Liam tries to explain Steffy is not going to be a problem, none of those old feelings re-surfacing .and Bill adds sarcastically that Ivy will not be bothered by that. Ivy tells Steffy that she did not need rescuing and Rick will not go down without a fight. Eric says he knows Rick wants to remain CEO but he does not want to depend on Bill for any reason. Ivy tells Steffy that she does not have a problem with her working with Liam but she does have a problem of her making an open play for him every chance she can get. Steffy rationalizes it that she will always love Liam and he loves her too. Ivy questions her if that means even if Liam has moved on. What will it take for Steffy to realize that.",
        "Rick states he does hate Bill and he did Maya wrong, but he will overlook it for this. He and Maya still have a lot to work on but there is hope. And the last thing Ridge will expect is for them to go to Bill and that be the knockout punch but he thinks he can land it. Bill tells Liam he gave him the shares but they both are going to have to keep an eye on Ridge. Just because he can make a dress does not mean he is good CEO material. Ridge tells Caroline she is going to be his design partner, the woman in his life. Caroline says she does not want Ridge to lose his father over this .so let things settle down. Rick marches into Bill's office and chides him for taking something extremely private about Maya and publishing it. He had no right. Bill says look around and see his publishing company without his binky and he will see he had every right. Rick shuts up and says that is not the reason he came anyway. He has a proposal he thinks Bill can not turn down. Rick says he hates coming to Bill but they are both shrewd business men and he hopes his shares are still in place so if he sides with him and his father they will have 50% and Ridge can not win. And Bill could name the next President, even himself ..and Ridge would answer to him. Liam walks in on Ivy's convo with Steffy and she asks him if it is true that he is still in love with Steffy. Rick tells Bill this is his chance to team up with who he wants \u0096 he and Eric or Ridge?"

        "Caroline: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Good morning.",
        "Caroline: Wait, what? [Sighs] I laid down after physical. I must have fallen asleep.",
        "Ridge: I didn't want to wake you when I came in last night.",
        "Caroline: Mm. Well, hey, how'd everything go at Forrester?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: This has to be it, Dad. I did more research last night. There's no sign that -- that Spencer transferred those shares over to Liam.",
        "Eric: But Liam says he has control of those shares.",
        "Rick: Right, so Ridge assumes that Bill just handed them over to him free and clear. Otherwise, he wouldn't be going into business with a man that he hates -- who hates so what I gather is Bill still has control of those share. We just got to get him to confirm it. And, uh, maybe find a way to make it worth his while so he'll side with us and not Ridge. Yes, it's a long shot. But as far as I'm concerned, it's the only shot we got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh, my! What's going on here?",
        "Bill: My son has a new title, so, uh, dad's buying him a new suit. I mean, for me, suits are a little uptight. What? Will you just measure, Bernie?!",
        "Liam: D-Dad, stop picking on Bernie. Thank you.",
        "Bernie: Pleasure. I'll have it for you in three days Mr. Spencer.",
        "Liam: Great.",
        "Bernie: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Don't you think you're getting a little ahead of yourself? I mean, nothing's official.",
        "Bill: Who needs official? That coup is as good as done. Thanks to my brilliant progeny over here.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, I think Ridge deserves some credit for initiating.",
        "Bill: Are you kidding me? You went to that clown months ago with the idea of pooling the shares to get Rick out. I mean, if anyone deserves the credit... look, Forrester is in much better hands being out from under Rick's little thumb. So are Caroline and Ivy.",
        "Katie: Oh, oh, you might want to ask Ivy about that... especially since Steffy's part of the bargain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Heard you made the move. And uncle Eric knows everything now.",
        "Steffy: Yep.",
        "Ivy: And?",
        "Steffy: My granddad backed the wrong son, and my dad did the only thing he could.",
        "Ivy: Well, I'm sure you're pleased about that.",
        "Steffy: I'm pleased about a lot of things these days.",
        "Ivy: Well, I gather this means you're staying in L.A.",
        "Steffy: And how do you feel about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: What do you know that we don't?",
        "Katie: Nothing. It's just, you know, this has been difficult for me because Rick is my nephew, but I realize that Forrester needs to move in a new direction.",
        "Bill: Exactly. Something had to be done. Liam did it. Bold leadership.",
        "Liam: Again, Ridge was the one who put things in motion.",
        "Katie: With a critical assist from his lovely daughter.",
        "Bill: Steffy's a player -- gutsy, smart, not afraid to take anyone on.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, that's worked well for her so far.",
        "Liam: What do you mean \"so far\"?",
        "Katie: Just that she's used to getting her way. About most things, anyway.",
        "Bill: Moving on.",
        "Katie: You know, it's interesting because I was talking to Ivy earlier and she's pretty gutsy herself, especially when it comes to the man she loves. So, I'm just curious. How do you feel about working so closely with Steffy and being involved with Ivy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I've always supported Liam's plan with this.",
        "Steffy: Even if it means having me back for the foreseeable future?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] Steffy, we're family. Forrester Creations is important to both of us.",
        "Steffy: To Liam, as well.",
        "Ivy: You do know why he's doing this, right?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, because Rick was mean to his girlfriend and Liam felt the need to rescue you.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, I-I didn't need rescuing. Liam did all this to create a better working environment at Forrester Creations for myself and for Caroline.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, something that could never happen without me. But, hey, as they say, it is not over until the fat lady sings. Something tells me Rick won't go down without a fight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Rick, slow down, all right?",
        "Rick: We can't slow down. We have to go to Spencer. We have to appeal to him.",
        "Eric: Just listen to me for a second. Look, even if -- even if Bill still has control of those stocks, he's the last person on earth I want to do business with. And I know you want to keep your position of CEO here. I respect that. [Sighs] But I have to think about the whole business and the family. Letting Bill in the door is dangerous.",
        "Rick: More dangerous than what Ridge is doing to you? Stabbing you in the back, kicking you to the curb along with me? We can't capitulate, Dad. I won't! Not to Ridge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So, how was your therapy?",
        "Caroline: Oh. [Sighs] Excruciating, but...it's good. They say, um [Grunts] Yeah -- uh, that at the rate that I'm going, I should be able to put pressure on these bad boys pretty soon.",
        "Ridge: Proving everybody wrong.",
        "Caroline: Yes, it's what I do best. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: That's wonderful.",
        "Caroline: No, what is wonderful is you and the way that you've been taking care of me. You know, you're helping with my physical therapy and...pampering me, especially with everything that you're dealing with.",
        "Ridge: There's nothing more important than you, and I should have been here for this session.",
        "Caroline: I'm sure you had a good excuse.",
        "Ridge: Do I ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: So, what options does Rick have?",
        "Steffy: He doesn't. [Sighs] My dad's got this pretty much sewn up.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Okay, then. So, all we have to do is, uh, stay focused on our objective.",
        "Steffy: Oh! It's \"our\" objective now, is it? Huh.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, I -- I think you're gonna make a great president.",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm. And with Liam as my VP, how can I fail?",
        "Ivy: Your VP?",
        "Steffy: Oh. It's just a figure of speech.",
        "Ivy: Can I just get something clear? I don't have a problem with you and Liam working together. In fact, I think the company could really use it. What I do have a problem with is you making a play for my boyfriend at any opportunity you get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Wait a second. Y-you've been talking to Ivy?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I guess she walked in on you and Steffy at Forrester?",
        "Bill: That's my boy! Right there in the office?",
        "Liam: Oh, we weren't doing anything.",
        "Katie: Apparently, Steffy hasn't given up on getting you back, even though she dropped it as a condition for --",
        "Liam: Wait, are you saying -- did Ivy overhear Steffy --",
        "Katie: Oh, oh, Steffy declaring that she will always love you? Yeah, she heard all that.",
        "Bill: Uh-oh!",
        "Liam: No \"uh-oh.\"",
        "Bill: Uh-oh!",
        "Liam: No \"uh-oh!\" That is not what she -- listen, Steffy understands that this is purely business.",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Monkey business.",
        "Liam: It's not monkey business! It's different this time. There's no conditions or stipulations.",
        "Bill: Dump the Aussie, or else?",
        "Liam: Okay, I understand why Ivy might think that, given -- [Stammering] Steffy knows.",
        "Katie: Steffy knows that what the two of you had, you can never have again?",
        "Bill: Think I said those exact words about Katie and me after we divorced. But look at my baby and me today, huh?",
        "Liam: Damn it. I'm -- I'm trying to explain something to you, okay?",
        "Bill: Uh-huh. Yeah.",
        "Liam: I'm trying to explain --",
        "Bill: Go ahead. Explain. Go. Okay, let me help you out. You're trying to explain why you and Steffy can work together with none of those old feelings resurfacing and that Ivy is going to buy it. Good luck with that.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I like that.",
        "Caroline: Ugh. I can't wait to get back to the office full-time. Oh, did I really just say that, after how Rick and I are?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, they were giving you a hard time.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Well, now Maya's gone, and Rick --",
        "Ridge: And Rick is on his way out, too.",
        "Caroline: Is that what you meant?",
        "Ridge: Yep, something huge is happening at Forrester, something...that Rick wasn't expecting. Or my dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I can't believe you're even considering this after everything that Bill did to Maya.",
        "Rick: Which I hate him for.",
        "Eric: But you'll overlook it if it means you might keep your seat as CEO.",
        "Rick: No, I can't overlook it. I will make Spencer pay...when the time is right.",
        "Eric: But not now.",
        "Rick: What you don't know is Nicole told me where Maya was hiding out. I went to see her, had a long talk.",
        "Eric: That's great.",
        "Rick: Well, it was all a big misunderstanding. We still have a lot to work through, but when Maya heard what was going on, the one thing she made very clear is for me to do whatever it takes to stop Ridge.",
        "Eric: Even if it means getting into bed with the devil?",
        "Rick: The last thing Ridge expects us to do is -- is go to Spencer, and if he still has those shares and we can pull this off, we'll blindside Ridge. It'll be a knockout punch. And it's up to me to convince Spencer to help us land it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. What are you talking about?",
        "Ivy: Yesterday, you were in here talking to Liam.",
        "Steffy: Oh. So, you were eavesdropping?",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "Steffy: Oh.",
        "Ivy: What I did hear was you telling him that you're in love with him and that you're always gonna be in love with him. It's like you can't let an opportunity go by.",
        "Steffy: Without reminding Liam how I feel?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: Okay, Ivy, I'm always going to love Liam. We've shared a lot.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, and I --",
        "Steffy: And I believe that he'll always love me.",
        "Ivy: And you honestly believe that, even though he's clearly moved on?",
        "Steffy: Has he?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Don't pay any attention to him. He's just trying to get a rise out of you.",
        "Bill: Hey, if Ivy's okay with Liam and Steffy doing their thing over at Forrester --",
        "Liam: A-and if by \"doing your thing,\" you mean \"working with Ridge as professionals to get the company back on track\" --",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah, working as professionals. Blah, blah, blah. I'm sure Steffy is completely over you.",
        "Katie: Oh, uh, Liam didn't say that. But, you know, we both know Liam very well, and he's committed to Ivy.",
        "Bill: Well, uh, what Liam better be committed to is making sure that Spencer Publications reaps the benefit of that takeover because that's why I gave Liam control of my shares in the first place.",
        "Liam: Listen, man, I'm very grateful. I know how hard it is for you to give up control...",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: ...Of anything. And -- and to have my back not only with your support, but with your 12.5%, that really means a lot --",
        "Bill: All right, yeah, save all the mushy stuff, okay? Especially when things are not a fait accompli until they are. Especially if that something involves Ridge. I mean, so, the guy can make a dress. That doesn't qualify him to be CEO. But you're gonna have to keep an eye on him. In fact, we are both going to have to keep an eye on him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So, that's it. All the same combined shares without Steffy's stipulation.",
        "Caroline: Wow. It's a...whole new era at Forrester Creations.",
        "Ridge: It's a whole new power structure. Steffy's gonna be president, Liam vice president, and I will be pulling double-duty.",
        "Caroline: As CEO and head designer...which means that you're gonna be twice as busy.",
        "Ridge: Which means I won't be here. And neither will you...'cause you're gonna be right by my side. My design partner. The woman in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I don't give a damn. You get back to me with what I wanted A.S.A.P. you got it? Good.",
        "Rick: Well, I see you're hiding out in your office.",
        "Bill: Oh, boy. All right, look, uh, yeah, I'm gonna have to give you a binky if you're gonna have a little temper tantrum right in my office.",
        "Rick: How the Hell could you do that to Maya? That was her story to tell, if and when she wanted to tell it. You had no right.",
        "Bill: I had every right. Take a look around. I'm the king of a publishing empire. And my loyal subjects -- I.E. the public -- had every right to know they were being played like suckers.",
        "Rick: No, that's not how it was. You took something extremely private and you exposed it, which is -- is cruel and it's ruthless.",
        "Bill: [High-pitched] Cruel and ruthless. [Normal voice] You want a box of tissues? All right, get over yourself. This is my business, and I made a sound business decision.",
        "Rick: Only that's not what's happening, because I've already seen the backlash that's happening to your company.",
        "Bill: I'll you what, slick. I'll worry about my company, and you just worry about Milton, Myron, or Maya -- whatever.",
        "Rick: All right, enough! I'm here for another reason, anyway. I have a proposal for you. One that I'm quite sure that you're not gonna want to turn down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: What is it going to take to convince you?",
        "Steffy: Oh, that you're Liam's future and I'm his past?",
        "Ivy: Steffy, he's been completely straight with you, no mixed signals, and yet you continuously believe that there's a chance for you both!",
        "Steffy: What? That -- that he still loves me? Look, we've shared a lot, Ivy. And we're always gonna love each other. And that's something that I don't think you'll ever understand.",
        "Ivy: I don't want to have what you had with Liam. We're two completely different people. We're in a brand-new relationship, but what we do have is something so special.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, and -- and I get that. But Liam and I will always have -- always have a connection, you know? A certain je ne sais quoi.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Ivy: You just --",
        "Liam: Hey! Oh. Hi. Uh, I didn't realize --",
        "Ivy: Actually, no, this is perfect timing. Steffy was just about to tell me how much you're in love with her. So, I'm just wondering -- is that true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I'm really happy for you, the company. I mean, you've been working for this for a really, really long time, and I think that you're gonna make an amazing CEO",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I'm not sure my dad agrees. He thinks I betrayed him.",
        "Caroline: Well, maybe he just can't admit it because of the guilt that Rick's put on him.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, maybe that's part of it. I never wanted it to get to this, you know?",
        "Caroline: You're not thinking of yourself. You're thinking of -- of the company, you know? And your children's legacy, Eric's legacy. I think -- I think when things settle down a bit, he'll -- he'll see that, and -- and the hurt feelings will subside. I mean, you're not -- you're not gonna lose your father over this.",
        "Ridge: It's ironic, isn't it?",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Ridge: I'm going against the man I love using the shares of a man I detest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I despise you, Spencer. But I can be cutthroat, too.",
        "Bill: Sure you can.",
        "Rick: Which is why we need to team up.",
        "Bill: Team up?",
        "Rick: Yeah, you see, uh -- see, Ridge is showing his hands, which, uh, circumstances are shifting.",
        "Bill: At Forrester.",
        "Rick: Circumstances that would give you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I've been offered more once-in-a-lifetime opportunities than I can shake a stick at, but...do go on.",
        "Rick: You see, you and I, we speak the same language. Uh, we're both shrewd businessmen, which is why I hate coming to you with this, but...",
        "Bill: You want my shares.",
        "Rick: You've obviously given Liam control of them. They're still yours, which I'm hoping that means that they're still in play.",
        "Bill: Why would you think that?",
        "Rick: Well, if you combine your shares with Ridge and his kids, Ridge will be in control. But if you vote your shares with my dad and me, it will be 50/50, an even split.",
        "Bill: Thereby defeating Ridge's attempt to oust you as CEO or so you hope.",
        "Rick: You do realize if, uh,Ridge becomes CEO, you won't have any say in the company.",
        "Bill: Well, I have virtually no say now.",
        "Rick: You will if you join forces with my dad and me.",
        "Bill: How's that?",
        "Rick: Well, for starters, you won't have any persona non grata every time you walk in the building the way you would with Ridge.",
        "Bill: Whoopee.",
        "Rick: And there's one other little detail. My dad and I discussed, uh, the idea of you being able to choose Forrester's next president.",
        "Bill: Who would have to answer to you, the CEO.",
        "Rick: Anybody you would want as president.",
        "Bill: Hmm! Even me?",
        "Rick: Even you. And Ridge would have to answer to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: How does a girl get in good with the new CEO?",
        "Ridge: I'm not CEO yet. Let's not jump the gun.",
        "Caroline: Okay, fine, but it's still a really big deal for you and for those of us who love you.",
        "Ridge: I'm just glad that Liam has his father's shares. Otherwise, none of this would be happening.",
        "Caroline: No. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: This is your chance, Spencer. Who would you rather team up with? Us...or Ridge?"
