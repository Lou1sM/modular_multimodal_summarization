{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7081 ~ The takeover at Forrester Creations turns violent; Ivy & Steffy await Liam's answer."], "Recap": ["Bill knows that Rick is desperate. His 12.5 percent of stock can keep Rick in the driver's seat. Rick thinks it is a no brainer as Bill would get to pick the President. Rick guesses that Bill despises him less than Rick does his own brother. Bill is tempted and says this will go down easier now that Maya is out of Rick's life. Rick has to tell him that he is still in her love with her and technically she is not out of his life. Rick continues to ride Bill of which side he is on. Ridge rubs Caroline's shoulders and they share some fun time. She knows he has a lot on his mind and wants him to get to work. She knows Ridge has been waiting for this a long time and all it will take is one formal vote and Ridge is in and Rick is out. Liam looks scared when Ivy asks him to explain why Steffy thinks he is still in love with her. Steffy says that is not how it happened. She simply said that she loved Liam and always would but that he had lots of love for Ivy. She does not know what will happen in future. Ivy says neither does she but there is no guessing game in their relationship now.", "Nicole catches Maya as she is folding clothes and Nicole thinks she is packing to leave town. But she sees what a good mood she is in and thinks she has talked to Rick. Maya says yeah they talked, she can not say they are back together but she is not mad at Nicole for telling Rick where she was. And she understands everything after hearing his side of the story. She told Rick to fight Ridge with everything he can. Rick walks into Eric's office and tells him it was not easy but he talked to Bill and Eric was right that Bill still has ownership of his shares, not Liam. He would give no answer as he likes to see Rick squirm. Eric joins in on the Liam, Steffy, Ivy convo and asks if Ivy has told them about the proposed changes around here. Liam recognizes this must be very difficult for Eric. He says Ridge has called and is on his way and this will be settled by end of day. Ridge walks in and wants to get this done right away, sign the papers. Bill is not far behind and all wonder why he is there. Gloating Bill says he was paid a nice visit by Rick and wants to tell them that Liam does not have control of his stock. So now he has a choice of whether to throw in with his sons, Rick and Eric or with Ridge who does not talk to him and constantly hurts his feelings. So smirking again he says it comes down to old Dollar Bill and his measly 12.5 percent held in his jeweled hands that holds the future of Forrester Creations."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: You're desperate.", "Rick: It's to your advantage.", "Bill: I vote my shares with you and Eric, and in return, I get more influence there. Get to choose the president. Even if that choice is me.", "Rick: Whoever you appoint, Ridge has to answer to. But we both get to stick it to him. That's the deal if you close it.", "Bill: How much do you hate coming to me right now for this?", "Rick: There's definitely other places I'd rather be.", "Bill: But I hold the golden ticket. Me and my measly 12.5% of your company. Not much. But enough to keep you in the driver's seat... if I choose to jump on board.", "Rick: What's it gonna be? You gonna side with us, or are you gonna let Liam back Ridge, the guy who's sleeping with your niece? I mean, is there really a choice?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: Oh, my gosh. You have no idea how good that feels.", "Ridge: I'm sure it does.", "Caroline: You're so good to me.", "Ridge: [Smooches] Get you back on your feet.", "Caroline: Why? I'm very okay right here. I'm gonna take full advantage of this. [Chuckles]", "Ridge: Don't let me stop you.", "Caroline: I'm stopping you. I'm stopping you! You have to go back to the office.", "Ridge: I'm right where I want to be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Liam, I'm sorry to put you on the spot. That's -- that's not even how it happened.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Well, it's a very simple question. Steffy thinks you're still in love with her, so do you want to set her straight?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: So, you're not leaving town.", "Maya: I take it you spoke to Carter.", "Nicole: Yeah. He told me you were splitting.", "Maya: Well, obviously, I'm not. Any other questions?", "Nicole: You're in a pretty good mood.", "Maya: That's not a question.", "Nicole: Oh, okay. Well, why are you in a pretty good mood? You talked to Rick, didn't you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: If you ally with me and my dad, we control 50% of the company.", "Bill: And you stay on as C.E.O.", "Rick: Well, it takes a majority to get rid of me.", "Bill: Which Ridge has now.", "Rick: With your stock, yes. But if you side with me --", "Bill: You get to keep your post, and I get to choose the president. Wow. You must despise me less than you despise your own brother.", "Rick: [Chuckles] Not much, but yeah. So, who's giving you the bigger, better deal? Us or your, uh, buddy Ridge?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: You're awfully quiet. Am I losing you?", "Ridge: Hmm? No. No way. No.", "Caroline: Wow. Can lie, too.", "Ridge: [Chuckles]", "Caroline: You're thinking about work.", "Ridge: A little.", "Caroline: And another lie. It's all right. I forgive you. You've only been waiting for this your whole, entire life. So, that's okay.", "Ridge: It's big. One formal vote, and Rick is out and I'm in.", "Caroline: With Steffy as president and Liam as V.P. I wonder how Ivy will feel about that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Oh, my God, guys!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: This -- this is just getting ridiculous. Ivy, Liam obviously has lots of love for you. I simply said that I will always love Liam. We shared a lot. I'm not afraid to express my feelings.", "Ivy: Just because you're not demanding he love you in return for your stock, you're still convinced, somehow, that there's gonna be more than just business between you two.", "Steffy: Honey, I live in the present. What happens in the future is anyone's guess.", "Ivy: Well, that's -- that's great for you, but when it comes to our relationship, there is no guessing game.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: It is tempting.", "Rick: It's a no-brainer to me.", "Bill: Yeah, well, if I do this, I'm gonna have more influence at Forrester. I will be more active.", "Rick: That won't be a problem. The bottom line is I'm all about business. I'm about making money, period.", "Bill: Right. And you would do whatever necessary in that pursuit, wouldn't you?", "Rick: Everything legal.", "Bill: Like say, for example, publishing information that was both truthful and provocative, would create viral interest, sell a ton of magazines.", "Rick: I think it's best we stay on topic. No need to be nasty.", "Bill: Well, you know, at least the good news is she's out of your life, and down the road, I'm sure we'll have a good chuckle over this.", "Rick: Yeah, not likely. She's still in my life.", "Bill: Really?", "Rick: I'm still in love with her, bill.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: So, Rick dressed up like a waiter, just like when we first met.", "Nicole: Aww. That's so sweet. And you're not mad that I told him where you were?", "Maya: No. After hearing his side of the story, I get why you did. Thanks.", "Nicole: So, you guys worked things out?", "Maya: I wouldn't go that far.", "Nicole: But it was all just a big misunderstanding.", "Maya: I know. He told me about the accident. I-I can't believe that that's the reason he didn't answer when I asked if he still wanted to marry me.", "Nicole: Yeah, so what's the problem?", "Maya: It's complicated.", "Nicole: Complicated? Maya, life is complicated. Love uncomplicates it.", "Maya: That's a little naive, Nicole. I'm transgender, and I think that I should have told Rick earlier. But I didn't, and so he's parading me around town, online, in the trades, and I just -- I just felt like it was too late to tell him. And so I convinced myself to wait until he proposed.", "Nicole: But then I told Wyatt and Wyatt told his dad and pretty soon, the whole world knew.", "Maya: Yeah. Everyone but Rick.", "Nicole: You're right. I am naive to have trusted Wyatt. And I am so sorry. I don't know what I was thinking.", "Maya: I think we both have trust issues. You trust everyone, and I don't trust anyone... even the man I love.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: All right. I got water for you, food. Here's a phone. Whoa!", "Caroline: [Laughs]", "Ridge: Take it easy.", "Caroline: I'm getting really good with this thing. [Laughs]", "Ridge: I missed you.", "Caroline: I couldn't wait to get back home.", "Ridge: Why didn't you tell me?", "Caroline: 'Cause there was nothing you could have done, and I knew that you'd -- you were busy.", "Ridge: Tell me now.", "Caroline: I don't know. You know, you're just -- one minute, you're walking on the sidewalk, and... I don't know. The next minute, there's a car on top of you. Kind of just changes -- you know, changes your perspective pretty quickly.", "Ridge: I imagine it would.", "Caroline: And at first, um... I victimized myself. You know, I kept thinking, like... like, \"why me? Why did this happen to me? What -- what did I do to deserve it?\" And then I just, um... then, like, a bell went off in my head, and I was just kind of like, \"everything happens for a reason,\" and it wasn't particularly something that I believed in before, but now I do. I also believe that it allowed me to feel all the love that was surrounding me, you know, especially yours.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Well, to answer your question --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Oh, this isn't high school, Liam. You have a girlfriend. Big deal. We have a job to do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Uh, yeah, that I apparently will have to remind you of from time to time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Liam, Steffy. Ivy, these two have been filling you in on the proposed changes around here? Ridge's proposed hostile takeover of the company? We can talk about it openly. I was just on the phone with him, and he wants to meet with us.", "Liam: Uh, yeah, well, I-I'm sure he wants to call for the vote and make it official.", "Eric: I wouldn't get too far ahead of myself on that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Maya really isn't the issue.", "Bill: I would sure as hell hope not.", "Rick: I need an answer, bill. Who are you siding with? Me or Ridge? I mean, you're a business man. Who would you rather prefer, a marginalized position under Ridge or a position of, uh, authority and influence? I mean, come on. Who's giving you more power?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Uh, uh, Mr. Forrester, we recognize that this is difficult for you.", "Steffy: But it shouldn't be. Dad's more than capable of running this company.", "Eric: It's the way he's going about it, Steffy.", "Steffy: Yes, and -- and that is unfortunate.", "Liam: It is unfortunate, and it's not the way that Ridge would have --", "Eric: It's wrong. It's wrong.", "Steffy: With all due respect, granddad, Rick wrote the book on wrong -- the way he's treated people, manipulated them, put them in danger. And let's not forget taking down grandma's portrait off the living room wall. I'm sorry. And I know he's your son, and I know you want to believe in him, but how can you approve some of the things he's done?", "Eric: I don't. And he knows that. And he's learned it. Now it's all about the issue of the stock, who has what, who controls what. We'll settle all this very soon.", "[Cell phones beeping]", "Eric: Ridge is on his way in. This will all be settled by the end of the day.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: I still haven't forgiven myself.", "Nicole: For what?", "Maya: Nicole, look at what I did. Rick was at the top of his game, the company was thriving, the whole world was praising him, and now he's a laughingstock. He's the man who fell in love with the woman who didn't tell him she was transgender.", "Nicole: That shouldn't be an issue.", "Maya: No, of course it shouldn't, but it is. It's the reality, and Rick is paying the price. If only I had told him from the beginning.", "Nicole: You said so yourself. There is no timeline for when to disclose. What difference would it have made?", "Nicole: He would have had a choice.", "Nicole: What choice?", "Maya: Whether or not to get involved with me.", "Nicole: Maya, he has that same choice. And he still wants you. He's always wanted you. The way that the world is reacting doesn't matter to him because he loves you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Have you really thought this through?", "Rick: I'm doing what's best for the company. Um, for your company.", "Bill: Yeah, don't oversell.", "Rick: [Chuckles]", "Bill: Yeah, you did a pretty good job... up until Maya came along.", "Rick: Actually, she's a major part of my success story.", "Bill: You have no idea what you're up against.", "Rick: Oh, I'm well aware of it, thanks to you.", "Bill: Yeah, it is thanks to me. I did you a favor publishing that information. Now it's out in the public, where it should be. Can you imagine the flack you would have gotten if you had gotten married and then this all came out?", "Rick: Come on. We're wasting time. What's it gonna be? You in or out?", "Bill: [Chuckles] Oh, I'm in either way. I either throw my lot in with your idiot brother or his idiot brother.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Cell phone rings]", "Rick: It's Ridge. What?", "Ridge: Hey, Ricky. Show time. I'm calling a meeting.", "Rick: When?", "Ridge: I'm leaving for the office now. I suggest you do the same.", "[Beeps]", "Rick: Ridge is making his move. But you need to make a choice. Is it gonna be me or Ridge?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. You know the rest, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: You both have come so far, and you've moved past all of that. You're beautiful together.", "Maya: Oh, God. I just want him so badly. And every moment that we're away from each other gets worse. I've gone online, and I see what everyone's saying.", "Nicole: No, wait. Stay away from the internet, Maya.", "Maya: I can't help it. It's my only connection to Rick. And I see the pictures of us together. I just -- I would give anything to have another chance.", "Nicole: You do have another chance.", "Maya: No. I mean a chance to relive the past and tell him sooner, protect him from everything he's going through right now.", "Nicole: He is stronger than you think. All of this nasty publicity -- he can handle it.", "Maya: It's more than that. He's fighting for his company.", "Nicole: What?", "Maya: Ridge is trying to take control.", "Nicole: How?", "Maya: I don't know. Some kind of hostile takeover. I told Rick to fight him with everything he's got.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Rick, you -- you saw bill?", "Rick: I was right. Bill still has control of his shares of Forrester. And he can do what he wants.", "Eric: And...?", "Rick: And I made my pitch, but it wasn't easy. That bastard likes to watch me squirm.", "Eric: So, what's the bottom line? Is he with us or --", "Rick: I don't know, dad.", "Eric: [Sighs] Look, Rick, you know there's absolutely nothing I can do if Ridge retains controlling interest. All right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Okay. Let's wrap this up. Carter drew up the papers, and I would like to do this with the least amount of fanfare.", "Eric: We're doing nothing, Ridge.", "Ridge: I hope we can work through this. No matter how ashamed you are of me, you're still my father and I'm still your son.", "Eric: And he's still your brother.", "Ridge: And who knows? Maybe all this will help us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: I'm sure that's one of your highest priorities.", "Ridge: You had your moment in the spotlight, Rick. Now it's my turn. Liam, tell him what the numbers are.", "Liam: Okay.", "Eric: We know all that. We've been over all that.", "Ridge: He's been working on this for months. Just give him a break.", "Rick: Really?", "Liam: Uh, it didn't happen overnight. It took some...negotiating. But the, uh, bottom line is that Steffy's, Ridge's, and Thomas' shares, along with my father's, which I control, give us majority interest in the company. Steffy, you're up.", "Steffy: Dad will be the new C.E.O. He's appointing me president and Liam vice president.", "Rick: How disgustingly cozy.", "Ridge: And we'll have a job for you, depending on your attitude. Let's sign some papers.", "Liam: Dad. What are you doing here?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: You want to tell him, Rick?", "Ridge: Tell him what?", "Bill: Your brother paid me a visit earlier. We had a nice chat. And he made me a very interesting offer.", "Ridge: What offer?", "Rick: Turns out that you've been misinformed, Ridge. You see, Liam -- he doesn't have control of his -- of his father's stock. I went ahead and made bill the offer to choose the next president for Forrester. We'll have 50% of the shares and putting a stop to this, uh, well, clever little maneuver of yours, Ridge.", "Bill: Brooke. Son of a Brooke. He's Brooke's son. Get it? It's funny. Oh, come on. Where's everybody's senses of humor? You see, the world needs more levity and less rudeness and nastiness, Ridge. See, I still have a decision to make. Do I throw in with my boys, Rick and Eric, who extended a olive branch and made me a very attractive proposal, or, conversely, do I throw in with you, Ridge, who doesn't talk to me and, quite frankly, hurts my feelings. It's crazy, isn't it? I mean, it all comes down to little ol' dollar bill and his measly 12.5%. I hold in my well-jeweled hands the very future of Forrester Creations."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afj2iylh_s8"}
