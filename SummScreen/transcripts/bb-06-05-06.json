        "Nick: You can't fire them -- the Forrester family? You \r\nreally want to be a part of that? A part of this? ",
        "Brooke: I know you have your concerns. But I'm the only \r\none who can decide what I have to do. ",
        "Nick: You have complete control of Forrester Creations. \r\nYou've got it. It's your life-long dream. You can have it all. You just can't \r\nhave me and be a Forrester. ",
        "",
        "",
        "Christian: Look, I think we have a little \r\nmisunderstanding here. ",
        "Dante: No, I'll throw you out myself if I have to.\r\n",
        "Christian: I'll leave when Felicia asks me to. \n",
        "Dante: This is my studio. ",
        "Christian: And your woman? ",
        "Felicia: I'll call you. Wow, and here I thought the \r\ncaveman was extinct. ",
        "Dante: Don't make a joke, okay? ",
        "Felicia: What do you expect me to do? You swagger in \r\nhere like a cheap, Italian John Wayne and throw a perfectly nice guy out of the \r\nroom -- a guy who might actually be interested in me. Which you've made very \r\nclear is not the case with you and then you say that I shouldn't mention that \r\nyour behavior is freakin' bizarre? ",
        "Dante: Why do you make it so damn hard for people to \r\ncare about you? ",
        "Felicia: When you say \"people,\" do you mean you care \r\nabout me? ",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, I apologize. Look, this is all my \r\nfault. When Ridge left you, I just, I didn't realize how vulnerable you were. \r\nOtherwise, I know you would never have said the things that you did to me if you \r\nhadn't been in so much pain yourself. ",
        "Stephen: Wait -- wait a minute! Now, you're the victim?\r\n",
        "Stephanie: You are responsible for all of this bile, you \r\nloser! You come back here and you think that you're going to get back at me and \r\nmy family? You've poisoned her against me. ",
        "Taylor: No! He didn't betray me! ",
        "[Stephanie scoffs] ",
        "Stephanie: He's used you! Why can't you -- you're \r\nRidge's wife, you're his daughter's enemy. Can't you figure out what he's done \r\nhere? ",
        "Stephen: Taylor's life is no longer any of your \r\nbusiness. ",
        "",
        "",
        "[Bridget remembering] ",
        "Ridge: You know if Nick and your mother are having \r\nproblems now, that relationship isn't gonna last. ",
        "",
        "",
        "Nick: I know how hard this is for you. Your history with \r\nthis family, with this business. But you cannot have a life with him and have a \r\nlife with me. Unless you've changed your mind about us. ",
        "Brooke: No, never. I want to make things work for us, \r\nNick -- for you and me. But I also want to make things work for Ridge's family. \r\nI know you don't want me working close to Ridge, I understand that. But, you \r\nknow, I've been thinking about this, and I really believe I found a way to make \r\nthis work. I can still be CEO and I can never see him. ",
        "Nick: How? ",
        "Brooke: I'll be running Forrester Creations from Marone \r\nIndustries. I'll have an office right next to yours. Don't you see? This could \r\nwork out for everybody. ",

        "",
        "Dante: I'm gone two minutes and you throw yourself at \r\nanother guy. ",
        "Felicia: I was just having a little fun. ",
        "Dante: Fun? If I hadn't shown up, you would have had \r\nthis guy right there. What are you thinking? ",
        "Felicia: Excuse me, grandma Damiano, but you didn't have \r\na problem with my thinking when I took you home, had sex with you and couldn't \r\neven remember your name. ",
        "Dante: Who says I didn't have a problem with that?\r\n",
        "Felicia: What? ",
        "Dante: Why do you always have to act like a slut? \n",
        "Felicia: Nice -- really nice thing to call the mother of \r\nyour son. ",
        "Dante: You know, Felicia, don't you get it? You are \r\nbetter than that. ",
        "",
        "",
        "Stephanie: Don't be a fool. He came after you for one \r\nreason and one reason only -- the stock. Oh, and a little sex. Which is like \r\nsticking it to ridge twice! ",
        "Taylor: That is so wrong! ",
        "Stephanie: Never in my wildest dreams did I think that \r\nyou would be so stupid to fall for something so obvious. Taylor, save what \r\nlittle self respect you have and give me back the stock. ",
        "",
        "",
        "Brooke: I don't have to be here to run Forrester. \n",
        "Nick: He's still gonna be in your life. ",
        "Brooke: Ridge and Eric are Forrester creations. It would \r\nbe morally wrong to fire them, not to mention bad business. Losing our two lead \r\ndesigners -- that would send the clients into a panic and this company into a \r\ntailspin. ",
        "Ridge: That's why you're CEO, Logan. You're ability to \r\nsee past all the garbage and do what's best for the company. ",
        "Brooke: Can you, Ridge? Can you do what's best for the \r\ncompany? Respect me and my future with Nick? Because I'm doing what's best for \r\nyour family. But I could change my mind in a second. Don't think I won't. If you \r\ndon't mind, I'd like some privacy while I pack up my things. ",
        "Ridge: As you wish. ",
        "Nick: I don't like it. ",
        "Brooke: It has to be this way. I love you. I really do. \r\nAnd I want to have a life with you. But I can't do something that I don't \r\nbelieve in, even for you. ",
        "Nick: Well, I guess you wouldn't be the woman I loved if \r\nyou did. In my opinion, happiness is having...",

        "",
        "Dante: You know, Felicia, you are a walking \r\ncontradiction, you know that? You want people to care about you. You want people \r\nto come close to you and then you do something like this to push them away, to \r\nscare them away. Why? ",
        "Dante: No, of course you do! You're a grown woman. You \r\nknow exactly what you're doing. ",
        "Felicia: Maybe it's just who I am. ",
        "Dante: Do you even know who you are? Because I don't \r\nthink you're this hurtful, dangerous person you pretend to be. I think you are \r\nsmart, intelligent, loving, caring woman. ",
        "Felicia: I never meant to hurt you. ",
        "Dante: You know what, you hurt yourself most of all. \r\nThis has got to stop, Felicia. You can't keep throwing yourself away. You got to \r\nstart seeing yourself for who you are, you know? You got to start seeing \r\nyourself the way I see you. The way our son sees you. Can you do that? Can you \r\nlook at yourself with new eyes? ",
        "",
        "",
        "Stephen: Stephanie, I'm afraid what you're asking is no \r\nlonger possible. I've already signed those stock certificates over to nick.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, the lawyers can fix everything, all \r\nright? Just tell them that, tell them you were drinking. Or tell them you got \r\ncaught up in something. But believe me, they can fix everything just -- please \r\nget rid of him. I don't want to be in the same house as him. ",
        "Taylor: You know what? You are absolutely right. I don't \r\nthink the two of you should be in the same room. I'm asking you to leave. \n",
        "Stephanie: You're going to side with this bum? \n",
        "Taylor: Is that how you see everybody? Everybody who's \r\nnot a Forrester? People who you have nothing to gain from? ",
        "Stephanie: You know that's not true. ",
        "Taylor: No, I know that I fought like hell to live. To \r\ncome home, back to my family who I knew would walk through fire with me. People \r\nI knew who would protect me and look after me. That is the family I thought I \r\nhad, Stephanie! You know what? I only sold 2% of the stock because apparently, \r\nthat's all you thought I was worth. Why don't you go talk to the person you \r\nthink is worth half of everything you own. I mean, you respect Brooke. You \r\nadmire her. You're sorry that you deprived Ridge of her love all these years. \r\nAnd then you think by telling me that you understand everything because I was \r\nprobably just drunk -- that that's the way to get back into my heart? You're \r\nselfish and you're narcissistic and you're dangerous. And I am a fool because I \r\ndidn't see it way a long time ago! Well, I don't want to see you anymore! I \r\ndon't ever want to look at you again! ",

        "Nick: Hey. ",
        "Bridget: Are you all right? You seemed really upset on \r\nthe phone. ",
        "Nick: Yeah, well, things have changed. I guess I want to \r\nbe the first one to talk to you about it. ",
        "Bridget: Oh, okay. What is it? ",
        "Nick: You're mother now owns 52% of Forrester. \n",
        "Bridget: It's 50%. Stephanie only gave her half. \n",
        "Nick: It's 52%, you're grandfather secured the other 2%.\r\n",
        "Bridget: What? Really? How did he do that? ",
        "Nick: Taylor sold me her shares. And the reason we did \r\nthis is because we wanted to protect your mother. ",
        "Bridget: Wow, I thought it was actually really brave of \r\nyou to let her work at Forrester Creations. It seems totally wrong to me but --\r\n",
        "Nick: It's insane! The reason I did this -- Eric, Ridge, \r\nStephanie, I asked you're mother to fire them, all of them! ",
        "Bridget: I mean, Nick, that would've worked in theory \r\nbut my mom would never do something like that. ",
        "Nick: Well, there you go. You certainly do know her \r\nbetter than anyone else. ",
        "[Nick sighs] She decided she wants to run Forrester \r\nfrom the Marone offices but those people will still be in her life! ",
        "Bridget: Yeah, well, how do you feel about that? \n",

        "Brooke: Ridge -- ",
        "Ridge: No, I mean it. You found a way to let Nick down \r\neasy. I wish you were gonna be working here but, I take what I can get when I \r\ncan get it these days. Lots of things can be done by phone -- fabric approval, \r\nlast minute fittings. As far as the bedroom line goes, I know your body pretty \r\nwell but -- ",
        "Brooke: Stop. I meant what I said. If you can't respect \r\nmy relationship with Nick -- ",
        "Ridge: What you did for this company today and for our \r\nfamily, that's the woman I love. That's why you'll always be my Logan. You've \r\nalready determined our future, Logan. All that's left is playing it out. \n",

        "Dante: Look, I don't need much. I just, would like some \r\ntime to get to know you better without complications like this. You know, \r\nfinding every stray doctor in the neighborhood in bed with you. I mean, look, \r\nsleeping around is not gonna make you feel any better. ",
        "Felicia: You think? ",

        "Taylor: No, no. It would be nice if we could -- it's \r\njust that you're brooke's father and given the history I -- ",

        "[Nick sighs] Sorry, I don't mean to come here and dump \r\non you like this. I guess I didn't know where else to turn. Why did you ever put \r\nup with me anyway? ",

        "Brooke: Them? ",
        "Stephanie: Your father and Nick. Brooke, I have placed \r\nmyself in a vulnerable position here because I've done what I believed was the \r\nright thing and they are trying to seize this opportunity and to destroy us. \r\nNow, look, I think they've made a miscalculation. I believe they underestimated \r\nyou. If you stand with me, we can stop this. I believe my trust in you is not \r\nmistaken. Are you with me or against me? What's it going to be? "
