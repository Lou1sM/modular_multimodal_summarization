    "Recap": [
        "Rick tells Maya that nothing is more important than her and no one will shame her. He does not need that job or that title. She says she does not want him to do this for her. He says that is the way love works. She says she is starting to understand what she means to him. He tells her to get used to idiots that he has to punch out that go after her. She is not on her own anymore. No one will ever hurt her. Aly, Wyatt and Ivy come in and asks Ridge if all turned out okay and Steffy said it did. Aly rushes to Oliver and tells him Rick is out and Ridge is in so he might have to do some re-shoots. Steffy pours the champagne and says they have paperwork to do. She gushes to Liam that they did it! Ridge goes home to Caroline who is disappointed at first then elated when she hears despite Bill's interference that Ridge is the new CEO. She says he deserves it and she is happy for him. She wishes she could do an Irish jig for him. He says they are a team and he knows she is by his side.",
        "Wyatt and Ivy chat and she says she is not worried about Steffy being back. She knows Liam is committed to her. Wyatt says Steffy is a force and sometimes men can not say no to that. She turns the tables on him and asks if he could resist Steffy and would he ask her out. Steffy pours more champagne and giggles at everything Liam says as they sign papers. They both are on a high and he even allows her (as if he could stop) to kiss him as Aly walks in and sees them. Liam leaves and Aly charges in and says she saw her throwing herself at Liam. He is committed and she has no right to do this. Ivy is more suitable. Steffy says excuse her but this is not up to Aly. Liam goes straight to Ivy and says she has no reason to worry. He is committed to Ivy and eventually the right guy will come along and she will back off. Ivy tells him that they may have found the right guy right here in Wyatt. Steffy tells Aly that just because she has been a member of Hope Logan's fan club all her life does not mean she can hate on Steffy or what she does or does not do with Liam. Aly talks about morals and values that once was. Steffy says one kiss with Liam won't corrupt FC. Aly says she is sure Steffy has some great memories but that is all it will ever be for Liam. Rick tells Maya they have both made mistakes they can not change but they can move forward and things can be improved. He does not care what the tabloids say. How can he be accepting and loving and that hurt him in the public eye."

        "Maya: You really mean that?",
        "Rick: Yeah. I'll defend you to bill. I'll defend you to anyone.",
        "Maya: But your job, Rick -- being CEO --",
        "Rick: I could have had it. Bill would have sided with me. But without you, why would I want it? I'm never gonna let anyone shame you. Nothing is more important than you -- not a job, not a title. And none of it matters without you.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles softly]",
        "Ivy: So, how long are you planning on keeping us in suspense?",
        "Wyatt: Did it work? Are you CEO now?",
        "Steffy: He is.",
        "[All chuckle]",
        "Ivy: Yay! Yay!",
        "Aly: [Giggles] Wait. Wait. So, Rick and Maya are really gone?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Maya: Being CEO has been important to you for so long. It's defined you.",
        "Rick: Not anymore. See, I'm looking for new definitions. I'm looking for better ones.",
        "Maya: I hate to see you give up because of me, Rick.",
        "Rick: That's how it works.",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Rick: Love! It makes you do crazy things -- walk away from jobs, punch magazine moguls.",
        "Maya: Oh, I wish I could have seen you punch bill Spencer.",
        "Rick: Oh, you'll get the opportunity to, because he's gonna say horrible things because that guy can't help himself.",
        "Maya: Not that we need to punch him every time.",
        "Rick: Well...",
        "Maya: Well, okay -- maybe just until he learns. Do you know how good this feels?",
        "Rick: Yes, I do.",
        "Maya: I think I might be starting to understand what I mean to you.",
        "Rick: It's about time.",
        "Oliver: That's fantastic. Okay. Look over here.",
        "[Camera shutter clicking]",
        "Oliver: All right. We're gonna do close-ups on the bracelets first thing tomorrow morning. Don't break a nail. That manicure was expensive.",
        "Aly: Oh, my gosh! Oh -- oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!",
        "Oliver: What? What's going on?",
        "Aly: Um, you might need to reschedule that bracelet shoot.",
        "Oliver: Why?",
        "Aly: Um, well, because the new CEO will need photos for a press release, and that'll probably take priority.",
        "Oliver: New CEO? What are you talking about?",
        "Aly: Rick is out. Ridge is in. Working at Forrester will finally be something to be proud of again.",
        "Maya: I have spent my entire life doing this alone, and I learned early how to defend myself -- when to ignore stupid comments and when I had to fight. It's a whole new experience, being with someone who protects me, who'll walk away from his dream job for me.",
        "Rick: It doesn't bother you, does it?",
        "Maya: No.",
        "Rick: Good, because get used to me punching out the idiots who think they can go after you.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: You're a beautiful, strong, capable woman. I know you've been able to deal with the insults from people. I know you've done just fine on your own, but you're not on your own anymore. I'm here. And I'm gonna make sure that no one ever hurts you again.",
        "Steffy: To a new era.",
        "Wyatt: I'll drink to that.",
        "Liam: Cheers.",
        "Ivy: Cheers.",
        "Steffy: Look at us -- the new leaders of Forrester right here.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: Well, actually, Ridge is the new leader of Forrester.",
        "Steffy: My father wouldn't be CEO without our shares. Oh, which reminds me -- we have paperwork to do.",
        "Liam: Ah. Right.",
        "Wyatt: All right. Well, let's let the bigwigs do their thing, huh?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: I will catch up with you later.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles softly] We did it. We did it! [Laughing] Cheers! Ahh.",
        "Liam: Ahh.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Caroline: So, did everything go according to plan?",
        "Ridge: Nope.",
        "Caroline: Because...?",
        "Ridge: Because your uncle tried pulling a fast one.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] No. Ridge...",
        "Ridge: But it didn't matter. You're looking at the new CEO of Forrester.",
        "Caroline: Come here!",
        "Caroline: So, it's -- it's done? Rick's contract was overturned?",
        "Ridge: It's done.",
        "Caroline: Are you drinking my tea?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: I'm really happy for you. You deserve it. And in my imagination, these guys are doing, like, this really awesome, like, Irish jig for you, so if you could picture that, it's going -- it's going well.",
        "Ridge: Uh-oh.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Ridge: I just saw something else. There it is.",
        "Caroline: Yeah?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: Yeah? Well, that -- that could definitely happen, once I'M... better. And I really --",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Caroline: I really can't wait to be fully healed so that I can -- I can be by your side all the time.",
        "Ridge: I'm planning on that. We're a team.",
        "Oliver: This is great.",
        "Aly: Beyond great. This is like pressing the \"restart\" button for Forrester, and I-I couldn't be happier -- mostly.",
        "Oliver: Mostly?",
        "Aly: As long as everyone knows their place.",
        "Oliver: You mean Rick?",
        "Aly: No. I mean Steffy.",
        "Oliver: Uh, I don't get it.",
        "Aly: You know, I think I'm going to track down my cousin and have a little chat.",
        "Oliver: Aly...",
        "Aly: Just to thank her. She's helped make Forrester a better place for us all... including Ivy.",
        "Rick: I saw your friend downstairs.",
        "Maya: Nick? Did you say hello?",
        "Rick: He was ordering coffee. I didn't want to interrupt.",
        "Maya: Plus it might have been a little awkward?",
        "Rick: When you first told me, I had no idea. But, no, no, it's not awkward. I know there's people in your life that knew about your transition before I ever did. I can't change that. Did you have a nice visit?",
        "Maya: Yeah, we did. I was soul-searching, I guess.",
        "Rick: Sounds deep. [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: I was just... wondering why it took me so long to tell you... and what it would have been like if I told you from the beginning.",
        "Wyatt: You think it'll all work out all right?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I mean, we got what we wanted. Rick is out, and Ridge is in control.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and then Liam gets to be the hero of Forrester Creations. Whoo- hoo! Great for him.",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I'm sorry. I just... you know... about you and Liam... uh... I wouldn't be... surprised if you were a little bit concerned, I mean, now that Rick is gone, yeah, but Steffy is back, and she kind of just adds a whole new set of problems to the mix, you know?",
        "Ivy: I mean, yeah, look -- I'm not overly thrilled about them working together every day, but... you know, I-I trust Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Ivy: See, why would you do that? Just a minute ago, you were telling me all of your money was on me.",
        "Wyatt: I'm s-- I was trying to make you feel better about the situation. I don't know! I just --",
        "Ivy: Well, thanks -- thanks very much. But I'm pretty sure Liam's proven his commitment to me, so...",
        "Wyatt: It might be easy for him to prove when Steffy's not around him all day and every day, but now... Steffy's a force. She's extremely intelligent, insanely beautiful, and she knows it. Guys just don't say no to that.",
        "Liam: Looks like one... last...signature.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oww!",
        "Liam: That's it. We're done. We're done.",
        "Steffy: We're done.",
        "Liam: That's it.",
        "Steffy: More importantly, my dear... Rick is done.",
        "Liam: Ahh. Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: You know, I never thought -- I never thought we would do this.",
        "Steffy: You never thought?",
        "Liam: I never thought we would finally be rid of him.",
        "Steffy: And, ta-da, darling! Steffy to the rescue!",
        "Liam: Yeah, as usual.",
        "Steffy: Mm.",
        "Liam: Ahh.",
        "Steffy: Don't you forget it.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I'm grateful to you. This whole building...",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: ...Should be grateful to you!",
        "Steffy: [Laughing] Stop! Oh, my God. Including Caroline and Ivy.",
        "Liam: Mm. Yeah.",
        "Steffy: You know, they were the girls that inspired you in the first place to go after Rick.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: You know what? I get that.",
        "Liam: Really?",
        "Steffy: I do.",
        "Liam: You really do?",
        "Steffy: I do. Honestly, I'm -- I am so happy to be back here, and to have actually done this -- like, this stock is ours.",
        "Liam: I know! We did it! It -- it happened!",
        "Steffy: We're gonna kick butt at this!",
        "Liam: Yeah, we are.",
        "Steffy: Yes, we are! Oh, my gosh! Congratulations!",
        "Liam: Congratulations.",
        "Steffy: Welcome to Forrester.",
        "Liam: [Chuckling] Yeah.",
        "Caroline: Oh, okay. Well, it's almost time for my doctor's appointment, so...",
        "Ridge: All right. I'll grab a couple of things, and we'll go.",
        "Caroline: No. I'm just -- I'm just gonna call a car. You have way too many important things to do.",
        "Ridge: Remember this?",
        "Caroline: What are you... [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: You held my hand. We drew this together when I couldn't. Now it's my turn. There's nothing more important than you. Don't ever doubt that.",
        "Ivy: So, would you?",
        "Wyatt: Would I what?",
        "Ivy: Would you be able to say no to Steffy?",
        "Wyatt: Of course not. That's my point. No guy would. And Liam can try and resist for a while, but --",
        "Ivy: Okay, but she's -- she's this siren, this temptress, that's just out there luring men?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, something like that.",
        "Ivy: Okay. Well, she's out there singing her song, but, by the sounds of it, it's you she's luring in, not Liam.",
        "Wyatt: What?! No. No. Unh-unh.",
        "Ivy: We, yeah. Wyatt, listen to what you just said. \"She's so beautiful. She's so intelligent.\" I mean, why don't you just ask her out?",
        "Liam: Hey! There you are.",
        "Ivy: Hey!",
        "Liam: Hi. Am I interrupting?",
        "Ivy: Uh, no. We were just talking, um...",
        "Liam: About what?",
        "Ivy: ...About Steffy.",
        "Liam: Ah.",
        "Aly: I saw you... throwing yourself at Liam.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Aly: You kissed him.",
        "Steffy: Oh, Aly.",
        "Aly: Don't start this. You'll just be wasting your time. Liam is loyal and committed.",
        "Steffy: I know better than anyone.",
        "Aly: And yet you still think it's okay to kiss him?",
        "Steffy: I don't feel like I need to explain anything to you.",
        "Aly: You are not his wife anymore, Steffy. You are not his girlfriend. You just work together. That's it. He is with someone else now -- someone so much more suitable.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Excuse me?",
        "Aly: Ivy is the kind of woman Liam should be with, not you.",
        "Liam: You were talking about Steffy?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: Listen, I know it was a little awkward earlier, but I promise you you have no reason to worry.",
        "Ivy: Well, Liam, I think I probably should be. I mean, she's made her feelings for you extremely available, and she clearly has no respect for me or our relationship.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know, but that's not the point. The point is I'm committed to you, and you know that.",
        "Ivy: That's not gonna stop her from coming on to you.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I just -- I think she needs...time.",
        "Ivy: No. What she needs is to open her eyes and look around her and realize that there are available men everywhere.",
        "Liam: There are, and she will. Eventually, the right guy is gonna come along.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Maybe -- maybe he's actually right here. [Chuckles] I mean, that's what we were -- that's what Wyatt and I were just talking about. I was encouraging him to, you know, ask out Steffy.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Wh-what? Really?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Why? Would you have a problem with that?",
        "Liam: No. Why would I?",
        "Steffy: Liam and I just pulled off something pretty major. We were celebrating. It's really not a big deal.",
        "Aly: Yeah, right. Look, I-I-I know all the signs, okay?",
        "Steffy: The signs?",
        "Aly: The way you used to behave every single time Liam was with hope?",
        "Steffy: Shh. Shh. Shh. Just because you've been a member of the hope Logan fan club your entire life doesn't mean you have to hate on me. What I do with Liam or what I don't do with him is really none of your business.",
        "Aly: That is so not true. Ivy is my friend, and this company is my -- my legacy, too.",
        "Steffy: What does that even have to do with a friendly congratulatory kiss, hmm?",
        "Aly: It's just we have this opportunity with Forrester right now... thanks, in big part, to you. And now that Rick and Maya are gone, we can restore this company back to the way it was when grandma was still alive... the values Forrester used to have and...the morals.",
        "Steffy: Ohh. Okay. Get it. And...I have none. Wow. You really embraced the hope for the future propaganda, didn't you? One kiss with Liam doesn't make me morally corrupt, and it certainly won't interfere with the company's image.",
        "Aly: Just like you won't interfere with Liam and Ivy. I mean it, Steffy. Have just a little bit of respect. Those two are an example of what Forrester should be showing to the world. Ivy is traditional and understated and classy.",
        "Steffy: As opposed to me?",
        "Aly: I'm sure that you were a lot of fun, that Liam has some great memories, but that's all you'll ever be -- just a memory. You need to accept that.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: Look, we've both made mistakes. And if we could go back and do things differently, we would. But the only thing that matters is that we're here and we're together and that we're moving forward.",
        "Maya: I'm ready if you are. But I don't blame you if this is too much to give up, Rick -- your job, your reputation.",
        "Rick: Reputation? If anything, it's improved by being with you.",
        "Maya: Come on. The tabloids are all over this.",
        "Rick: Oh, tabloids, schmabloids. They've been after my entire family ever since I was a boy. I don't even care what they have to say. And all that hate and stupidity has only improved my reputation, so what does that say about me? That I'm accepting, that I'm loving. How could any of that hurt me in the public eye?",
        "Maya: So, you're really accepting of this... of me?",
        "Rick: I hope I've proven that to you.",
        "Maya: And I'm not losing you?",
        "Rick: Never."
