        "Stephanie: So, tell me. Are you with me or not? Tell me now, so we both know where we stand, and then, I'll tell you what I'm going to do about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Stephen, hello. Come in.",
        "Stephen: I'm sorry that I didn't call. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.",
        "Jackie: If you're worried that I have a man in the bedroom --",
        "Stephen: I'm hardly in the position to pass judgment.",
        "Jackie: You do know that I'm joking?",
        "Stephen: All I know, is Eric Forrester was a fool not to marry you.",
        "Jackie: Yeah, well -- relationships don't always work out, do they? No matter how much you want them to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Listen -- sorry to come by and -- I should probably get going.",
        "Bridget: Yeah. Yeah, you should go and work out all this stuff with mom.",
        "Nick: Right. Right.",
        "Bridget: Listen, Nick. For the record, I do think that mom was starting to let go of Ridge for good, before he had the heart attack. That just brought her back into the thick of things, you know?",
        "Nick: That's why I want her to fire them. Fire them, and just never look back.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, you were trying to protect her.",
        "Nick: Bridget, I know they have a child together. They're going to be connected the rest of their lives, but she's got to find a way to put some kind of distance between her and this family. Otherwise, the same stuff keeps happening.",
        "Bridget: And she thinks working from Marone is the solution?",
        "Nick: She does. And I don't trust it. I think she's going to get sucked right back in. What do you think?",
        "Bridget: I don't think it matters what I think. It's what Ridge and Stephanie do to use this to their advantage. And they will -- especially Stephanie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: That almost sounds like a threat.",
        "Stephanie: No. I just want you to be honest with me, and yourself.",
        "Brooke: Now you're calling me a liar.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I -- what do I have to do to prove myself? I've welcomed you into the company, I've welcomed you into the family. My god, I put my money where my mouth is when I gave you the stock. It seems to me that your father and Nick are just trying to get back at the people that you claim to care about.",
        "Bridget: I do care about you.",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, but in the same breathe, you fire us. You can't feel good about that.",
        "Brooke: No, I don't feel good about that. I was wrong to suggest firing you and Eric and Ridge. I don't know why I did that.",
        "Stephanie: Well, what exactly does that mean?",
        "Brooke: Well, it means that we'll continue working at Forrester as a team. I certainly don't want to tamper with success.",
        "Stephanie: So the situation is then resolved?",
        "Brooke: More or less.",
        "Stephanie: Well, it is or it isn't.",
        "Brooke: Nick still has a problem with me working alongside Ridge.",
        "Stephanie: It's not up to Nick. It's up to you. How can we possibly, as a company, work together, if you can't work with Ridge?",
        "Brooke: Well, I'm going to open up an office at Marone, and I'm going to work as CEO from there, and the rest of you are going to work from here.",
        "Stephanie: You can't be serious.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I am serious. I think it's the best solution for everybody.",
        "Stephanie: You know what this seems to me? It's just -- it just appears to me that this is Nick and your father pulling the strings, and you are letting them. I don't understand. I thought you wanted to be part of this family. Don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Shall I guess the real reason that you stopped by?",
        "Stephen: You think I have a hidden agenda?",
        "Jackie: I think that you don't like celebrating alone, and now that Brooke has controlling interest in Forrester, thanks to you.",
        "Stephen: Well, and Nick. He did put up the money.",
        "Jackie: It was your idea, and a brilliant one, might I add. Just how exactly did you get Taylor to part with her stock?",
        "Nick: I get it, Bridget. I get it. I know she has a connection to that family and the business, and I understand that change isn't going to happen overnight. Nicole's blanket. I thought that all these things were over at Dante's house.",
        "Bridget: They were, up until a few days ago.",
        "Nick: Oh. He living here now?",
        "Bridget: Yeah. Yeah, that's why I asked you to meet me here, and not at his house.",
        "Nick: Sorry. You want to tell me what happened?",
        "Bridget: Well, I mean, we -- we'd lost our little girl, and I fell in love with his son. He was a godsend. I moved in with Dante because of Dominick. I shouldn't have. I know that Dante wanted more, so -- you know. Who knows what could happen in the future.",
        "Nick: Yeah. Well, one thing you need is a balance. You have to feel for him what he feels for you.",
        "Bridget: He's a really good man. He's very caring and loving.",
        "Nick: He was there when you needed him. He was there for you, when I should've been.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You know that's what I want. Your family's never been more important to me.",
        "Stephanie: Then why are you letting them manipulate you?",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry you see it that way.",
        "Stephanie: Brooke, please. Please, we have a chance for a real friendship here, based on mutual respect for one another. That's what you've always wanted from me. That's what I'm offering to you. Don't let your father and Nick screw this up, because they have some -- some crazy need for revenge.",
        "Brooke: That's not what's going on here.",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's how it seems. They talked you into firing the three of us. They know that's not what you would've wanted, but they don't care. They're angry, the both of them. Nick is angry because you slept with Ridge, and your father, he's just plain angry about everything. It goes all the way back to college when we were all kids together and Eric slept with your mother. He wants to get back at us. He wants to hurt us. And he will do anything to accomplish that, including -- sleeping with Taylor to get control of the stock.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Do you ever wonder what it would've been like for us -- if Nicole had lived?",
        "Nick: I keep her picture in my wallet. I talk to it a lot. I sound like I'm crazy to you?",
        "Bridget: No, it sounds like you. Sounds like a warm, very funny man. An amazing man that fell in love with this little girl, the moment he found out he was going to be a father. A man who still loves her very much.",
        "Nick: And her mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: Taylor wanted to sever all her ties with the Forresters.",
        "Jackie: And you were happy to oblige her by purchasing her 2% of their company.",
        "Stephen: The point is, Stephanie humiliated her publicly and in private. Taylor deserved to get something out of it.",
        "Jackie: I mean, I couldn't agree with you more. I don't know the good doctor very well, but she was given a raw deal.",
        "Stephen: Exactly. Taylor is the mother of Stephanie's grandchildren, for god's sake. She's been nothing but loyal to her, and then, to just get shoved to the side like that --",
        "Jackie: You feel very strongly about this, don't you?",
        "Stephen: I just don't like to see someone that special get hurt. So, if you happen to have a bottle of bubbly chilling somewhere, maybe we could kick- start something.",
        "Jackie: So you did come by to celebrate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Well, I mean, your son, my daughter, finally getting married -- Stephanie, finally realizing what it's like not to be on the winning side for a change. I'd say we have a couple of things we could celebrate, don't you?",
        "Jackie: I'll get the champagne.",
        "Brooke: What did you say?",
        "Stephanie: I was just at Taylor's. They didn't deny it.",
        "Brooke: My father and Taylor admitted sleeping together?",
        "Stephanie: He did not admit that he slept with her to get control of the stock, and she doesn't want to believe that that's what happened. But that's what happened.",
        "Brooke: Oh my god. I don't believe this.",
        "Stephanie: What, you can't believe that the man who abandoned his family, the father who walked out on his daughter, isn't capable of doing something as reprehensible as this is, now? He wants you to think that he's changed. He's desperate for you to believe that. But he hasn't. That's why he struggled so hard to get control of the company for you. It's about so much more than that. It's about getting back at us and really hurting us. And Nick, it seems to me, has bought into it. What I'm afraid is, that you have, too.",
        "Brooke: No! No, I never wanted this, Stephanie. Never. Look, I can't explain what happened with my father and Taylor. I don't know. But like I said, I want to run this company with you, Eric and Ridge.",
        "Stephanie: Good, good, good. Then, it'll be okay just to sign the 2% back over to me.",
        "Brooke: If you really, truly trust me, you would trust me to keep that 2%, knowing that I would do what's best for the family.",
        "Stephanie: Well, it has nothing -- I don't have any problem trusting you. It's your father. It's Nick. And if you're going to be over there running this company from Marone --",
        "Brooke: Well, like I told you, Nick just has a problem with me working alongside ridge.",
        "Stephanie: I don't care if he has a problem or doesn't have a problem. This is -- you have to make the decision. You have to make the choice. I'm going to ask you again, are you with this family, or are you not? You have to choose and you have to choose now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Traffic sounds]",
        "Stephen: Here you go.",
        "Jackie: Thank you. I love moonlight.",
        "Stephen: You would look beautiful in any light. But you don't need me to tell you that.",
        "Jackie: What I need is what you're providing. A lovely, albeit, impromptu evening -- with a very handsome gentleman who just happens to be my son's future father-in-law.",
        "Stephen: Well, if that's your way of saying you're glad I stopped by, then so am I.",
        "Jackie: I'd like to tell you something. Something that I probably shouldn't, but -- oh, what the hell? We're both adults, right? Been around the block a couple of times -- or at least, I have. And I loathe playing games. So here goes. Stephen Logan, I think that you are a very sexy and captivating man --",
        "Stephen: Don't --",
        "Jackie: Yes, yes you are. And you can't argue, because I've got great taste. And you're a man that I'd like to get to know -- better. Much better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to totally fall apart like this.",
        "Nick: You're not falling apart. Actually, you're one of the toughest broads I ever met.",
        "Bridget: Really? Well, you better not let my mother hear you say that.",
        "Nick: Your mother knows we love each other and we always will.",
        "Bridget: Well, don't think that just because I'm alone here, and a little vulnerable, that I would come running back to you if anything didn't work out with my mom.",
        "Nick: That's your way of saying I'm a fool, isn't it?",
        "Bridget: Nick. You are many, many things, but a fool, you are not. You should go. Run back to the woman of your dreams. I got a lot of work to do, and a lot of reading here.",
        "Nick: Oh, \"Wuthering Heights.\"",
        "Bridget: Oh, yeah.",
        "Nick: If I were to guess, I would say this is the same copy Rick read from at our wedding -- wedding part one.",
        "Bridget: Part one. Took us many times, but, we did actually, finally say, \"I do.\"",
        "Nick: On the Marlin.",
        "Bridget: I remember.",
        "Nick: I really did want it to work.",
        "Bridget: Well, when it did, it was everything I had ever imagined, and so much more. Maybe it'll happen for me again like that someday. If I'm really lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Nick and my father don't control my life.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, he's been controlling your life since the day he walked out on you, and the rest of the family. And you've spent your whole life looking for love and approval. Brooke, please. Sweetheart, I can give you what your father never did. I can give you love and protection, just like you're my own daughter. But you cannot go along with this man. He'll only disappoint you in the end all over again.",
        "Brooke: Unlike you, who have always been on my side.",
        "Stephanie: You're right, and you have every right to say it. Almost losing ridge really changed my perspective. You have to believe that. If you go along with Nick and your father, it will undo everything. You'll lose the one chance that you have for my love and my respect. Please -- don't do that. Don't do that.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, stop.",
        "Stephanie: Call Nick. Just call him and tell him that you'll give me back the 2% of the stock. Tell him that you want to be here at Forrester, that this is where you belong. That you're going to run the company from here.",
        "Brooke: It's not that simple.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it is. Yes, it is.",
        "Brooke: I can't.",
        "Stephanie: You can.",
        "Brooke: I can't, Stephanie. I can't do this for you!",
        "Stephanie: You can't do this for me? Think of what I have done for you. Brooke, I've given you half of this company. Are you going to stand here and throw it back in my face? You're going to tell me that you're going to run this company from somewhere across town? I'm not going to let that happen. I have offered you every single thing that you've ever wanted. Everything! And what have you offered me in return? A knife in the back! You betrayed me. You've hurt me and betrayed me, and you've hurt this family over and over again. I'm not going to let you do it again! I'm not!"
