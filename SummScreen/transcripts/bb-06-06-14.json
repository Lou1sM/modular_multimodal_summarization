{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Hope walks in to find Liam lying on the floor with his mouth oozing blood. She sees Wyatt and it's obvious that he has sucker punched Liam. She bends down over Liam to check on him. Quinn says Hope should have heard the garbage that Liam was saying. Hope says she doesn't care what he was saying. She looks at Wyatt and asks if he hit him. Is this who he is? Wyatt tries to explain that he is not a violent person, she knows that. Quinn says Wyatt was pushed to his limits. Even Hope would have smacked Liam if she had heard what he said about Quinn. Liam tries to get up and says everything he said was true. Yes he laid into Quinn and it is not a lie to call someone who manipulates manipulative. He declares that Quinn needs to accept the consequences of her actions instead of justifying everything so innocent .not with Ridge possibly being dead and it being her fault. Eric tells Katie they will be landing soon and Ridge is gonna be okay. She says good, he will be there to meet them in Abu Dhabi and he can explain how all of this happened. Hassan and his men are all huddled in Bill's suite looking at maps and discussing the case. He tells Bill there is no body yet. Bill grouses there is no body as Ridge is alive somewhere. Hassan tells Bill that his money and manpower is not the problem. He has enough men but at some point it won't matter. They will have to cut off the search. Brooke says they can't. If he's not in the water, he's somewhere. She knows they are doing all they can but this is insane. Hassan also tells them it is harder and harder to hold off the press. Bill tells them to please not say a word. Brook also says keep it at bay at least until they find Ridge. They have a son together and he does not know yet. Hassan says maybe she needs to prepare him. Brooke says she knows they will find Ridge; he could not have just disappeared. Katie and Eric arrive at Bill's suite just as he is barking orders to hire ten more divers. Brooke tells Katie they are not going to give up but they've no good news to report. Maybe a boat picked him up or maybe he's in the hospital. He's out there somewhere and they will find him. Wyatt tells Liam that perhaps he over-reacted but he was attacking his mom and he couldn't let that go. He was verbally attacking her and they are all upset about what might have happened to Ridge but it is not Liam's job to go blaming people. Liam says punching him is not going to stop what is going to happen to them. He says he can not tell Hope what to do or who to include in her personal life but he does know what will happen to them professionally. They are gone. He will talk to Eric and to Rick. He'll talk to whoever it takes but they are gone from FC. Quinn counters that she did not push Ridge out of the chopper so how dare Liam use this to his advantage. Hope says he isn't. Quinn says that Brooke and Bill should not be getting married. She did what she could to keep that from happening. She provided Ridge with a better picture of Bill, that's all. Liam says yeah and now Ridge might be dead. He says she is an accomplice so face it. She may as well have pulled a gun out and shot Ridge. He says she killed Ridge Forrester. Quinn rants that Liam is losing it. They don't even know if Ridge is dead, but God forbid if he is she only gave him a picture; that is not murder. Hope says she doesn't know why Quinn even had to do that. Quinn says surely she did not want her mother to marry Bill without knowing. Hope says that was not her business and it certainly isn't Quinn's. she knows Quinn has a thing for Bill but he proposed and wanted to marry her mother. Quinn says that some people should not be getting married. She knows her mother likes to have one or two ceremonies a year, but people like Bill and Quinn don't need to be tied down with that kind of ceremony. Everybody has been talking about how true and loyal Bill is throughout all of this ..but guess what, he wasn't faithful. He slept with her and enjoyed every minute of it. Wyatt says they are getting into too many details. Quinn says she is not ashamed. Liam says but she is jealous. Quinn says all the cards need to be on the table so Brooke knows who she is marrying. Her mother should be thanking her for doing her the favor. Liam asks about Ridge; if he should be thanking her right about now. Wyatt says all of his could have been handled differently but his mother has a point in thinking everyone should know before they marry. Hope says that is true but why does Quinn have to be so shady.", "Hope thinks back on everything Quinn has done .sending her the video Liam made for Steffy and then brought Steffy to LA. on their wedding day and then trapping Liam in the elevator. Liam says and not to forget the steam room. Hope says when she thinks of these things separately maybe she could explain it away but not now with what has happened to Ridge. He might be dead. Quinn says and that is the last thing she wants. Hope isn't sure that Quinn gets the severity of what has happened. Quinn says she does and if Hope needs to blame her all right but just remember one thing that Wyatt had nothing to do with this. Hope thanks Quinn and says she has given her a lot to think about. Katie tells Bill this is all his fault. Brooke says no, he doesn't even like Quinn. It was Ridge who came and punched Bill and kidnapped her. Katie says she is so confused. She has not slept. But there is no body so Ridge must be alive. Eric says they need him and he will return to them. He has missed phone calls from Thorne and needs to try and call Felicia and Kristen again. Quinn tells Wyatt they have a minor problem. Wyatt says it is more like major. She says that Hope has left with Liam and he's using this to his advantage. She confesses this whole Ridge situation is her mistake but she will not let it cost him Hope. Hope cleans up the mess of Liam's face and says she is sorry that Wyatt hit him. She says she has been ignoring what she needs in her life. She says she brought Quinn and Wyatt into the company and she was very adamant that they stay so she feels some responsibility and now that all these really bad things have happened she feels guilty, like it's her fault. There have been so many lies, not just from Quinn who had her fair share but from Wyatt too with the stupid diamond heist that will always be in the back of her mind. Liam says maybe it should as neither are terribly honest people. She says and Ridge could be dead so how can she accept what Quinn did and then be with Wyatt knowing what his mother did. Quinn has caused so much pain and it's really opened her eyes. She thinks she can see very clearly now what she needs for her life. There are so many things that are not in their control but this decision to be with Liam after all that has happened .she knows what she wants. She wants to be with him. Liam is not sure he heard her correctly or if she means what he thinks she said. She kisses him. Brooke sits alone on the beach staring out at the sea and reliving Ridge's fall. She whispers that he is out there someplace. If he was gone she would feel it."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Hope: What happened?", "Wyatt: Hope.", "Hope: Oh, my God. Liam, are you okay?", "Quinn: You should have heard the garbage Liam was saying.", "Hope: Well, I don't care what he was saying. Oh, my God. Did you hit him? That's how you react? That's who you are?", "Wyatt: I...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: I've learned a lot about myself. Number one, turns out I can't control the future.", "Katie: [Chuckles]", "Ridge: And, number two, I can't live in the past.", "Katie: Sometimes, the past is hard to let go of.", "Ridge: But the future can be a lot of fun if you have no expectations and just let things happen.", "Katie: Is that what you're doing now -- letting things happen?", "Ridge: All I want right now is this moment with you. I really don't care what happens next.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: You're awake.", "Katie: Yeah.", "Eric: Ridge will be okay. He has to be.", "Katie: [Sighs] How much longer?", "Eric: The pilot said we'll be landing soon.", "Katie: Oh, good. Ridge will be waiting for us in Abu Dhabi.", "Eric: Yes, he will. He'll be there...with an explanation. Somebody has to explain how this this could happen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[All speaking native language]", "Bill: Could he have drifted that far?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Swam. Don't say drift. He could be anywhere in this vicinity.", "Brooke: I don't understand. We weren't that far off shore. How come he's not even found yet?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Hassan. Any news?", "Hassan: I'm sorry. No body yet.", "Bill: Because there is no body. Ridge is alive.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Bell chimes]", "Eric: Katie. We're gonna bring him home. All right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Is it the size of your crew? I mean, is that the problem? If it's a matter of money...", "Hassan: There's nothing wrong with my crew, Mr. Spencer. I've got more than enough men for this, but at some point, man power won't matter. We'll have to cut off the search eventually.", "Brooke: No. No. Ridge is out there. If he's not in the water, he is somewhere. Did you check the hospitals? I mean, you must have had your men --", "Hassan: We are taking care of it -- investigating all options.", "Brooke: I know you're doing your best, but this is insane.", "Hassan: I hate to bring this up, but we are fielding a lot of calls from the press.", "Bill: Don't say a word.", "Brooke: Please, keep it quiet -- at least until Ridge is found. We have a son together, and... he doesn't know what's happened yet.", "Hassan: You might want to prepare him.", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "Hassan: I'm not sure how long we can keep the press away, especially if we don't find --", "Brooke: You're going to find him. Ridge didn't just disappear.", "Bill: Just please get back out there. Find him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Hope, I'm not a violent person. You know that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: He was pushed to his limit. You would have smacked Liam, too, if you heard the horrible things he said about me.", "Liam: Yeah, well, all of it was true.", "Hope: No, Liam, you -- you don't have to get up.", "Liam: Did I lay into Quinn? Yeah, I laid into Quinn. I stand by every word. It's not a lie to call somebody who manipulates manipulative.", "Quinn: Oh, please. Manipulates?", "Liam: You need to understand the consequences of your actions. You go around justifying everything, making everything seem so innocent. Well, it's not. I mean, not with what happened in Dubai. Not with Ridge possibly being dead, and it being your fault. Ugh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Add another diver. Add 10 divers! Of course I mean it. I told you I'd pay for it. Fine. I'll wait for your call.", "Brooke: Nothing yet?", "Bill: No.", "[Knock on door]", "Brooke: Oh, Katie!", "Katie: Oh, Brooke.", "Eric: Is there any news?", "Bill: Still searching.", "Katie: He's still missing. He's been missing this whole time?", "Brooke: We're not going to give up.", "Katie: Well, why hasn't anyone found him?", "Brooke: I don't know. It could be a number of reasons. Depending on which way he was swimming, maybe a boat picked him up.", "Eric: What are they saying? What are they saying?", "Bill: Nothing. No answers yet.", "Brooke: The search leader said that they're doing the best that they can.", "Katie: Well, that's not good enough because they haven't found him.", "Brooke: We have to have faith. We're not giving up. Bill's making sure of that. They're searching everywhere -- land, sea. They're checking all of the hospitals. Ridge is out there somewhere. We're going to find him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You see? This is what they bring to our lives.", "Quinn: Okay, enough.", "Liam: Lies, manipulations, and look what it's come to. Ridge is missing, it's your fault, and what -- somehow I'm getting punched?", "Wyatt: Okay, maybe I overreacted, but you were attacking my mom, and I couldn't let it go.", "Liam: Attacking? What attacking? What are you talking about?", "Wyatt: Verbally, yeah. Look, we are all upset about what happened to Ridge, but it's not your job to go blaming people.", "Quinn: Yeah, this is a place of business.", "Liam: Yeah -- yeah, it is a place of business. It's Eric's business, and you may be responsible for the death of his son.", "Quinn: Ugh.", "Liam: Look, [Sighs] Punching me is not gonna stop what's about to happen to you people. I-I can't speak for hope, and I can't tell her what to choose in her personal life, but I'll tell you what's gonna happen to you two professionally. You're gone. I'll talk to Eric. I'll talk to Rick. I'll talk to whoever it takes, but you two are gone from Forrester creations.", "Quinn: Why? Because Ridge took it upon himself to fly halfway across the world?", "Liam: Yeah, Quinn, and you knew exactly what that would lead to.", "Quinn: I didn't push him out of that helicopter. How dare you use this horrible tragedy to your advantage?", "Liam: What?", "Quinn: Well, you know, that's exactly what he's doing, hope, right?", "Hope: No.", "Quinn: A man you care about is missing -- a man who's been a father figure to you for most of your life -- and he's trying to turn this around like it's my responsibility, and you call me manipulative?", "Liam: That's not what I'm doing at all.", "Quinn: Brooke and Bill shouldn't be getting married. I did what I could to stop them from making a big mistake, and I did. I provided Ridge with a clearer picture of who Bill really is. That's all.", "Liam: Yeah, Quinn, and now Ridge may be dead.", "Quinn: Oh, says who?", "Liam: Says who? How long has he been in the water, Quinn?! You really think he'd survive something like that?", "Hope: Oh, God.", "Liam: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, but we need to be realistic about this. You are an accomplice. You may as well have pulled a gun out and shot Ridge. Let's face it. You killed Ridge Forrester.", "Quinn: You're starting to lose it, Liam. You don't even know if Ridge is dead, but God forbid that he is, all I did was give him a picture. That isn't murder!", "Hope: Why did you even have to do that?", "Quinn: You don't want your mother marrying the wrong person, do you?", "Hope: It is none of my business. It certainly isn't any of yours.", "Quinn: Well, according to the content of that picture, I'd argue it is my business.", "Hope: So you have a thing for Bill. Well, guess what. He proposed to my mom. He wants to marry her.", "Quinn: Look, hope, some people shouldn't be getting married. I know your mom likes to have one or two ceremonies a year, but people like Bill and me -- we don't need to be tied down to that kind of a ceremony. We don't! You know, I think Brooke should have known what she was getting into. Everybody's been talking about how true and loyal Bill is -- how faithful that he has been to her through her whole ordeal. Well, u know what? Sorry. He wasn't faithful. He slept with me, and he enjoyed every second of it.", "Wyatt: Okay, before we start getting into details --", "Quinn: I am not ashamed.", "Liam: No, but you are jealous.", "Quinn: Of Brooke?", "Liam: Yeah. You tried to stop her wedding, didn't you?", "Quinn: Don't you think all the cards should be on the table before you enter into a marriage? I mean, seriously, your mother deserved to know! I did her a favor! You should all be thanking me.", "Liam: Oh, really? We should all be thanking you? What about Ridge? Should he be thanking you?", "Wyatt: Okay, obviously, this could have been handled differently, all right? But my mother has a point. I mean, shouldn't the truth have come out before they get married?", "Hope: Yes. Yes, that's true, but why does it have to be so shady with you?! I look back -- I think about everything that you've done. You -- you sent me the video that Liam made for Steffy, and then you brought Steffy to L.A. On our wedding day. You trapped Liam in an elevator.", "Liam: Yeah, don't forget the steam room.", "Hope: When I think about all of these things separately, I could maybe, you know, explain them away, but now, knowing what Ridge is going through, he could be dead.", "Quinn: [Sighs] And that is the last thing that I could want.", "Hope: Oh, my God. Quinn, do you even understand the severity of this situation? Do you understand what this could mean for my mom, for my aunt, for this entire company?!", "Quinn: Yes. Yes, it would be so devastating. I get it. And, listen, if you need to blame me for some reason, if all of this ends up badly, I just want you to remember one thing. Wyatt had nothing to do with this.", "Hope: [Sighs] Thank you, Quinn. You've really given me a lot to think about.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: I don't understand how this could have happened.", "Brooke: I don't either. [Sighs] Out of nowhere, the helicopter tipped. It was awful.", "Katie: I don't understand why he wasn't buckled in. I mean, aren't there safety precautions before you take off?", "Eric: This pilot should be arrested.", "Brooke: No, it just happened so fast.", "Bill: Ridge was determined to take Brooke away.", "Katie: Yeah, well, we all know why, don't we?", "Brooke: Ridge came in, and he wanted to interrupt the wedding, and he wanted to take me back to los Angeles. But he ran in like a madman, and he punched Bill, and then he grabbed me and dragged me down the beach and pushed me in the helicopter. We took off, and he fell out.", "Katie: This is all your fault. I mean, Quinn? You don't even like her.", "Brooke: Wait, wait. Wait a minute. This is not Bill's fault. It was Ridge who came in and punched him, and he practically kidnapped me. Bill was not at fault.", "Katie: I'm sorry. I'm just -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm confused. I haven't slept, and I just -- I just want him back.", "Brooke: Yeah, me, too.", "Eric: Have you told R.J.? Did you say anything to him?", "Brooke: No. No, not yet. We just -- I want to know one way or the other.", "Katie: He's alive.", "Brooke: Yes. Yes. Of course. I want to believe that, too.", "Katie: They haven't found his body. He's alive.", "Brooke: And we can't lose him. R.J.'S too young.", "Katie: I need him, Brooke.", "Brooke: I know you do. I know, Katie. I'm sorry. [Sighs]", "Katie: [Crying] [Sniffles]", "Eric: We all need him. Ridge will come back to us.", "Brooke: Yes, he will. He will come back. Okay? We're gonna make sure of that.", "Katie: [Sniffles]", "Eric: Two missed calls from Thorne. I got to call Kristen and Felicia, as well.", "Katie: No, no, no. Wait until you have good news.", "Brooke: One second, Ridge was there, and the next, he was gone.", "Katie: How high was the helicopter?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Not very. He would have survived. There's no way...", "Brooke: [Sighs] I've got to get some air.", "Bill: You want some company?", "Brooke: No.", "Bill: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Cell phone rings]", "Eric: Yeah? Hello? No, no news yet. No. Well...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: He's gonna be okay.", "Katie: You better hope so.", "Bill: Katie.", "Katie: No, no, no, no. I know this wasn't entirely your fault. Quinn sent that photo to Ridge. She knew what he would do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: We've got a minor problem.", "Wyatt: More like a major one. Mom, you've got to stop.", "Quinn: Me?", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Quinn: No, no, no. It's not me. It's Liam. Hope just left with him. He is using this to his advantage.", "Wyatt: You think?", "Quinn: This whole Ridge situation is my mistake. I'm not going to let it cost you hope.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: [Groans]", "Hope: Oh, God, does that hurt?", "Liam: Uh, no, that's fine.", "Hope: It's okay?", "Liam: Yeah.", "Hope: All right. I'm so sorry that he hit you.", "Liam: Ah.", "Hope: You know, Aly has been saying a lot of really wonderful things about you lately.", "Liam: I'll take it.", "Hope: Okay. All of which I know, of course. I just -- you know, I don't know.", "Liam: What?", "Hope: I think I've been ignoring what I need in my life. I brought Wyatt and Quinn into the company. I was very adamant that they stay, and so I feel a sense of responsibility, and now all these really bad things have happened, and I'm -- I'm feeling very guilty. I'm feeling like it's -- it's kind of my fault.", "Liam: Why? It's not your fault.", "Hope: There have just been so many lies, and not only from Quinn, who, you know, has had her fair share, but...from Wyatt, too. I-I think that that stupid diamond heist is always gonna be in the back of my mind.", "Liam: Well, I mean, you know, maybe it should. Neither of them are terribly honest people.", "Hope: And now Ridge could be dead. Liam, Ridge could be dead. And if he is, then Quinn is responsible, and how -- [Inhales deeply] How could I be with Wyatt knowing what his mother has done? She's caused so much pain, Liam. I'm thinking about what my mom is going through, what Katie is going through, and it's -- it's really opened my eyes. I feel -- I feel like I can see very clearly what it is that I need for my life. Liam, there are so many things that are beyond our control, but this -- the decision to be with you after everything that has happened... I know what I want. I want to be with you.", "Liam: Hope, are you -- are you saying what I think you're saying?", "Hope: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: [Thinking] You're out there, Ridge. If you were gone, I'd feel it."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzbW79kufVg"}
