        "Stephanie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Brooke: Old habits die hard.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, and that's all it is. I just want him to be happy. And I see that you make him happy, so -- I just need to believe that you want to be here with us. Don't walk away. Don't turn your back on us. It's not too late. Really, it isn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: I'm really happy for you, Nick. Love can be tricky, especially when it comes to my mom, but you seem like you're up for the challenge.",
        "Nick: I think I am.",
        "Bridget: Good. Then you should go and be with her. Why are you hanging out here with me?",
        "Nick: Bridget -- don't -- wait.",
        "Bridget: For what?",
        "Nick: I love you, I want you to be happy.",
        "Bridget: Oh, I want you to be happy, too.",
        "Nick: But you think I'm not.",
        "[Bridget sighs]",
        "Bridget: Nick, I'm just saying that when it comes to my mother, sometimes things just -- it's hard to see things for what they really are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dante growling]",
        "Felicia: Dante?",
        "Dante: Yeah?",
        "Felicia: I want to be the kind of person you see me as. For our son.",
        "Dante: You are.",
        "Felicia: You don't even remember what you said to me.",
        "Dante: Of course I remember. I remember everything. That you're sensitive and loving, and a really good mommy.",
        "Felicia: Good memory.",
        "Dante: Yep.",
        "Felicia: I think I can be a little less impetuous and impulsive -- crazy, even.",
        "Dante: That's the best thing about you.",
        "Felicia: I'm being serious.",
        "Dante: Me, too.",
        "Felicia: There's that whole role model thing.",
        "Dante: That's right. Look, Felicia, you and I are cut from a different cloth than most people. I mean, look, you care about our son, you show him love. What better role model?",
        "Felicia: I guess it doesn't hurt to be a little impulsive, huh?",
        "Dante: What kind of life would it be otherwise?",
        "Felicia: Boring!",
        "Dante: That's right.",
        "Felicia: This little guy is the best thing that ever happened to me.",
        "Dante: Me, too.",
        "Felicia: I think I better go get him down to bed.",
        "Dante: Asleep already?",
        "Felicia: Mm-hmm. I think he likes us all being together. I think it makes him feel good.",
        "Dante: Like nothing's missing.",
        "Felicia: Exactly like that.",
        "Dante: You know, family is important.",
        "Felicia: Your family's probably ticked off. At me.",
        "Dante: Why?",
        "Felicia: Because I wouldn't let him go on that trip to Italy that you planned. That couldn't have been the most endearing behavior on my part.",
        "Dante: They understand.",
        "Felicia: Just so you know, I smoothed that whole mess over with my mother. No more talk of deportation.",
        "Dante: Thank you.",
        "Felicia: Well, I couldn't let the father of my son be known as a criminal. I really want our son to know your family.",
        "Dante: You know, my family -- they're amazing people.",
        "Felicia: How could they not be? They're responsible for making \"Mr. Nice guy.\"",
        "Dante: You know, they ask about you all the time. They say, \"what is wrong with her? What is she thinking? Why aren't they married yet?\"",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Felicia: Did you tell them everything, which you so eloquently pointed out to me earlier?",
        "Dante: Not very tactful.",
        "Felicia: No, no -- I think you had the perfect touch. Lead glove. Seriously, I think it's really good to know you care.",
        "Dante: Of course I care. You're the mother of my son. You know -- why don't you come to Italy with me and Dino?",
        "Felicia: Italy?",
        "Dante: Yeah, it's that country surrounded by the Mediterranean sea -- it looks like a boot.",
        "Felicia: I know what it looks like. Are you sure about this invite?",
        "Dante: I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't sure. Say yes.",
        "Felicia: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I've tried so hard to embrace you and accept you. Why won't you let me in?",
        "Brooke: I've been down this road before, remember?",
        "Stephanie: I know, but we're here, we're here at this moment, and you keep letting other people influence you.",
        "Brooke: Oh, stop -- please! If I keep hearing you say that over and over again, my head's going to explode.",
        "Stephanie: Look, ridge is a proud man. He's begged you and begged -- but for gosh sakes Brooke, he's the father of your baby!",
        "Brooke: Oh, so humility's too much to ask for? After everything he's put me through? What you've put me through?",
        "Stephanie: I have been humbled. I've gone on public record -- what do you want me to do -- grovel?",
        "Brooke: Yes! No, no -- I just want you to accept the fact that I made a decision to work out of Marone Industries.",
        "Stephanie: Okay, fine. But just don't close the door on what I'm asking.",
        "Brooke: And what about the 2% that gave me controlling interest?",
        "Stephanie: If you don't make a problem of it, I won't make a problem of it. But, I just have to know that you're going to come back here, to ridge and to the family.",
        "Brooke: Can I really trust you?",
        "Stephanie: Yes. You belong here. You belong to us. We're your home. Don't you see that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: We really did have something beautiful, didn't we?",
        "Nick: Yes we did. And we always will. Maybe I'm the stupid one here.",
        "Bridget: No, you're not stupid.",
        "Nick: Pig-headed?",
        "Bridget: Maybe a little bit. It's time to let go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: I'm going to tell you something --",
        "Dante: Mm-hmm?",
        "Felicia: But I don't want it to go to your head. That night in Nice --",
        "Dante: Yeah?",
        "Felicia: The way we were together? I remember how you kissed me.",
        "Dante: I remember how you kissed me.",
        "Felicia: Yeah?",
        "Dante: Yeah, you left me with a hickey.",
        "Felicia: No, I didn't!",
        "Dante: Yeah, you did.",
        "Felicia: Did I?",
        "Dante: Yeah. Well, listen. Don't worry, because you put it in a place that wasn't so hard for me to conceal.",
        "Felicia: I'm so sorry.",
        "Dante: Don't be. Should we be impetuous now?",
        "Felicia: Sounds good. What's that? Bridget's ring.",
        "Dante: She didn't want it. Look, this is going to sound crazy --",
        "Felicia: You want me to wear it to Italy. Your family's old fashioned, and it would be easier if we were engaged. Yeah, I can go along with that.",
        "Dante: I don't want to pretend anymore. I want this to be real. Will you marry me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You and Brooke hugging. If I hadn't seen it for myself --",
        "Stephanie: I don't know what she's going to do.",
        "Ridge: You're trying. I see that. And I very much appreciate it.",
        "Stephanie: I just want you to be happy.",
        "Ridge: I know. You can't be too happy knowing Brooke has controlling interest in Forrester Creations.",
        "Stephanie: No, I'm not, but -- well, there was a moment when I didn't know whether I wanted to hug her or kill her. But, I just want her to believe that I'm sincere and that I want her back here with us.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well that's not going to happen overnight.",
        "Stephanie: I don't care how long it takes. We just have to convince her that she belongs here with us. With the family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hi.",
        "Brooke: Hi.",
        "Nick: I went to talk to Bridget, because I needed to try to make sense of all of this for myself. I don't want you working with that family.",
        "Brooke: And I don't want to kick them out of their own company. Nick, I reached a compromise. I will work out of Marone Industries -- out of an office there, running Forrester Creations. Don't worry, I can handle this. You can trust me.",
        "Nick: It's Forrester who I don't trust.",
        "Brooke: I understand that you're sensitive to Ridge.",
        "Nick: That's not the word I'd use.",
        "Brooke: He can't do Brooke. He already has!",
        "Brooke: In time he will see how committed I am to you.",
        "Nick: Brooke, he is not going to back off. He will do anything to have you. Now, you have chosen to let them stay -- so I guess we'll see what you really want.",

        "Felicia: Marry you?",
        "Dante: Yes.",
        "Felicia: Talk about being impulsive.",
        "Dante: Look, the best thing that happened to the both of us was from an impulse -- our son, Dino.",
        "Felicia: Do you love me?",
        "Dante: You've fascinated me from the moment we met. You are the mother of my son. Of course I love you. And you know what? When I see you together with my son, my life feels complete. Maybe I'm not doing this right.",
        "Felicia: You're crazier than I am, you know that?",
        "Dante: If you say so.",
        "Felicia: Oh, god. What a pair we'll make.",
        "Dante: We'll make a family. It'll be perfecto. Please, say yes.",

        "Ridge: The marriage is never gonna happen.",
        "Stephanie: I don't know, he's so determined.",
        "Ridge: You know, I'm very proud of your new found acceptance of Brooke. But please, please, please don't let all that frustration and anger come back again.",
        "Stephanie: And don't you just take this sitting down.",
        "Ridge: I don't intend to. It's gonna be months before Nick's divorce to Bridget is final. And now, \"Brooke's bedroom.\" Our most profitable line -- and very close to Brooke's and my heart. She's my model -- and my muse. We'll be spending a lot of time together. By the time this new line shows, I guarantee you, we're gonna be back together.",

        "Brooke: I know what I want.",
        "Nick: You're sure about that?",

        "Nick: I know what this company means to you. I get it. You built it.",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Nick: I do trust you. But I also want to protect you.",
        "Brooke: And you do.",

        "Brooke: And now I have you.",
        "Nick: You do have me. Oh, I almost forgot. I picked something up for you on the way over here. Just something to match your eyes.",
        "Brooke: Nick?",
        "Nick: Open it. Just one thing.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Nick: At least say that you'll love and honor. 'Cause I know you're not going to obey.",
