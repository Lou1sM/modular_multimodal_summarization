    "Recap": [
        "Quinn explains to Eric and Wyatt that she was shot at and she thinks it might have been Katie. Eric is shocked that she would suspect Katie. Ridge says she did pull a gun on her at the office earlier. Lt. Baker goes next door and questions Katie. He says he has no answers yet but he does have questions. She says she is sure Quinn fingered her but surely he does not think that she would shoot at Quinn. She has a young son in the house and is worried that the shooter may pick her house next. Lt. Baker tells her the shot came from her direction and she did pull a gun on Quinn at the office earlier. He would like her to come to headquarters and answer a few more questions. Steffy tells Liam that she has a date with Thomas that includes all of them going to Il Giardino \u0096 including Sally. She says she wants Thomas to do well at Spectra. He has good intentions. Thomas tells Sally that he likes her designs. They are new and improved and she is making a statement. Eric is stunned to hear that Katie would even consider pulling a gun on Quinn. He says he has some questions of his own so he'd like to find out from Lt. Baker what is going on. He asks Ridge to stay with Quinn just for a little while. At the station Lt. Baker asks Katie if Quinn is right. Does she have a right to expect that Katie shot at her? She says that is the most ridiculous thing she has ever heard. He calls in the fingerprinting expert to take a few samples. Lt. Baker asks if she has changed her clothes and she answer no. So the technician checks the sleeves of her clothes. She says it will not show a thing as she did not shoot a gun. Lt. Baker says the evidence will determine that.",
        "Thomas and Sally meet up with Steffy and Liam. Thomas thanks them for inviting them. She says that is the only way to see her brother now is to make a date. Ridge leads Wyatt the way to show him where Quinn was standing and from what direction the gunshot came. Quinn pulls out her own spy glasses and looks toward Katie's. Sally says again that she is sorry that she stole from her business and why Steffy does not trust her. But she has so much respect for Thomas as a designer and as a man and she is lucky to have him in her life. Wyatt asks Ridge if Katie really could be the shooter. Lt. Baker gets a call and tells them to let Eric in. Katie is surprised but says she has nothing to hide so whatever he wants to say he can say it in front of Lt. Baker. Eric tells her that he has known her for a long time and he loves and respects her and all of this is a huge surprise. Katie admits she does not like Quinn but she would never do anything like that. She just pulled the gun in the office to scare Quinn like she does to other people. Someone is still out there gunning for Quinn. Quinn goes over to Katie's and is looking around when a mysterious figure approaches. Quinn asks who she is and she answers Sheila."

        "Liam: So you still stressed?",
        "Steffy: What stress?",
        "Liam: Hmm. No, really. How are you?",
        "Steffy: I'm okay. How you doing? I know your dad isn't happy about the whole Spectra situation, either.",
        "Liam: Uh...yeah. Well, he doesn't get to have his building at the moment, but he does get to have Brooke, so he's less grumpy than he could be.",
        "Steffy: Good.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Well, I got you. So now I can have lunch with my brother today.",
        "Liam: Ah. That's good you're trying to get along.",
        "Steffy: Well, you'll be there to help.",
        "Liam: I will?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. The four of us are going to lunch at Il Giardino.",
        "Liam: Four?",
        "Steffy: Sally will be there, too.",
        "Liam: Huh.",
        "Thomas: What do you think?",
        "Sally: Beautiful. Are they yours?",
        "Thomas: They're yours if you want them.",
        "Sally: For me?",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm. They're not your usual style, I know, but it's a little restrained.",
        "Sally: Yeah, and a little pricier. Look at this fabric.",
        "Thomas: Think of it as marketing. You are projecting a new image for Spectra. You're making a statement. You are a high-powered fashion executive with the most talked-about brand in the industry. When you walk into Il Giardino wearing this, everybody will know that you are a force to be reckoned with.",
        "Sally: Il Giardino? Are we going to lunch?",
        "Thomas: With my sister.",
        "Wyatt: Someone shot at you?",
        "Quinn: I'm okay.",
        "Eric: Quinn, you're not.",
        "Wyatt: Who would do this?",
        "Ridge: Lieutenant baker's checking into it.",
        "Eric: Where is he?",
        "Ridge: He's next door talking to Katie.",
        "Wyatt: She saw something?",
        "Quinn: I think she pulled the trigger.",
        "Katie: So I, uh, I know why you're here.",
        "Lt. Baker: I'm investigating a shooting.",
        "Katie: Right, at the Forrester estate.",
        "Lt. Baker: Oh, you heard the gunshot?",
        "Katie: Well, Quinn was here earlier, and she, um, she told me about it. So I'm -- I'm very concerned.",
        "Lt. Baker: I see that.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, I-I am. I mean, I-I live right next door. I have a child. I have a son. I mean, what if -- what if he starts shooting at my house next?",
        "Lt. Baker: Why do you say \"he\"?",
        "Katie: Well, I suppose it could be a woman. I mean, were there any witnesses? Do you have any clues?",
        "Lt. Baker: For right now, all I have are a lot of questions. Care to answer a few?",
        "Katie: Right. I get it. Quinn -- she told you that she thinks it was me. I mean, you can't possibly believe that. You can't believe that I would shoot at Quinn.",
        "Liam: Well, my day just got more interesting. Lunch with you and Sally Spectra.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Thomas insisted that she come along. You know, you're the only one that's gonna stop me from strangling her.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: You think I'm joking? My brother left his family company because of her. He gave up on his legacy and his -- and his credibility all to run Spectra fashions. Sally totally worked him over.",
        "Sally: Breaking bread with the princess. Should be fun.",
        "Thomas: One step at a time.",
        "Sally: Well, I would love it if we could all get along. I don't want to get in between you and your family.",
        "Thomas: You're not going to, and Steff is gonna see that today.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, Rome wasn't built over appetizers, bucko.",
        "Thomas: I love your style, and I'm not trying to change you. It's just that...",
        "Sally: Thomas, look, you don't have to explain self-promotion to a Spectra. Okay? People need to see that we're reinventing the brand. I will be right back. Unless you want me to change right here.",
        "Thomas: We would never make it to the restaurant in time.",
        "Eric: You think Katie did this?",
        "Quinn: She hates me, Eric. I fired her like you wanted me to, and she didn't take it well.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so, what? Did she threaten you or something?",
        "Ridge: She pointed a gun at Quinn.",
        "Katie: Quinn made it very clear that she thinks that I tried to kill her. I mean, is that -- is that why you're here?",
        "Lt. Baker: I understand Quinn fired you.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs] Right. So I'm a disgruntled employee looking for revenge.",
        "Lt. Baker: Well, there was also an incident at Forrester creations. You pulled a gun on her?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I-I know. That was -- it was a stupid impulse. It wasn't my gun. It was just -- it was sitting in a chair, and...",
        "Lt. Baker: We examined the trajectory of the bullet that struck the Forrester home. It came from this direction.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs]",
        "Lt. Baker: I'd like you to come downtown with me. You can answer a couple of questions. We could run a few tests. Is that a problem for you?",
        "Katie: No. No, if that's what it takes to clear my name, fine.",
        "Lt. Baker: Good.",
        "Steffy: We should get going.",
        "Liam: I'm proud of you.",
        "Steffy: Please don't tell me I'm doing the right thing, because the last time I did that, I sent Thomas right back into Sally's arms.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Do you think he'll do well at Spectra?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. He's an amazing designer. He knows the business. Could have done great things here at Forrester, but now he's not gonna get the chance.",
        "Liam: Because he's working with Sally.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I mean, he has good intentions. But I just don't know how much he can change things over there.",
        "Sally: What do you think? What would you call this? Kind of like a make-under?",
        "Thomas: It's still you.",
        "Sally: Yes, just new and improved.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] You're making a statement.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, I'm glad you like it.",
        "Thomas: Very much.",
        "Sally: Well, wait till the princess gets a load of this. How do you think she'll react?",
        "Thomas: To be honest, I have no idea what to expect, but... I have one request.",
        "Sally: What is that?",
        "Thomas: Would you skip the tiramisu?",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Wyatt: She really pulled Charlie's gun on you?",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Eric: Wait, Katie with a gun in her hand? I can't even see that!",
        "Quinn: It was terrifying.",
        "Eric: Oh, god, Quinn. Thank god you're all right.",
        "Ridge: She was trying to intimidate Quinn.",
        "Eric: Why? Why would Katie want to do that? Doesn't even sound like her.",
        "Wyatt: Mom thinks it's Katie. We should take this seriously.",
        "Eric: [Sighs] Lieutenant baker is questioning Katie? Yeah, I got a few questions myself.",
        "Ridge: Take it easy, dad.",
        "Eric: Look, look. Quinn, thank god you're all right. I'm gonna leave you for a while. Just a short while. Wyatt, Ridge, stay here with her. I'll be back soon.",
        "Ridge: Let the police handle this.",
        "Eric: Ridge, Quinn is my wife. She has every right to feel safe in this home. I'm gonna find out what's going on here.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Don't worry, Mom.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: If it was Katie, Eric's gonna find out.",
        "Lt. Baker: You seem a little on edge.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, I'm sitting in a police station.",
        "Lt. Baker: You're helping me with my investigation. You haven't been arrested or charged with any crime, Katie. We're just having a conversation.",
        "Katie: Really? That's it? Even though Quinn has accused me of shooting at her?",
        "Lt. Baker: Given recent events, she might have reason to think that. So, is Quinn right? Did you shoot that gun? Did you try to kill Quinn?",
        "Liam: So, do you want to order some wine?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Get a bottle of ros\u00e9.",
        "Liam: A-a bottle? Well, we don't know what Sally and Thomas are having, so...",
        "Steffy: Oh, no. The bottle is for me.",
        "Liam: Uh...",
        "Steffy: Fine, fine. We'll wait. We'll wait.",
        "Liam: Steffy, hey.",
        "Steffy: What? What?",
        "Liam: Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's not gonna be that bad.",
        "Steffy: We're having lunch with my brother and the thief that stole him and our entire collection.",
        "Liam: Bottle sounds good.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: There they are. What's wrong?",
        "Sally: Princess didn't accept the invitation to spend time with me.",
        "Thomas: Okay, you are going to be fine. Trust me. Hey, hey.",
        "Liam: Hey. Thomas, good to see you.",
        "Thomas: You, too, man.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: New look?",
        "Sally: Uh, yeah. I'm, uh, trying something different. Thank you for noticing.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] Thank you, guys, for coming to meet us. And I appreciate that.",
        "Steffy: Well, if it's the only way I can see my brother, I'll take it. I'd rather have you back at the office. That's where you belong.",
        "Lt. Baker: It's a simple question, Katie. Did you shoot at Quinn?",
        "Katie: I-I just -- I can't believe that you think that I did.",
        "Lt. Baker: You haven't denied it.",
        "Katie: I didn't think it was something I had to deny! It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!",
        "LT. Baker: Then you won't mind taking a gunshot residue test.",
        "Katie: No. Sure. That's -- that's why I'm here.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Lt. Baker: Send him in. This won't take long. We'll just take some samples and then rush them to the lab. Right-handed?",
        "Katie: Uh, yeah. Yes.",
        "Lt. Baker: Have you changed your clothes?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Lt. Baker: Uh, check her sleeve, too, please. Yes, sir.",
        "Katie: [Clears throat] It's not gonna show anything. I didn't -- I didn't shoot a gun. Quinn is wrong. We -- we don't -- we don't like each other, that's true, but I did not try and shoot her. I-I didn't.",
        "Lt. Baker: We'll let the evidence determine that.",
        "Wyatt: I just can't picture Katie shooting at anyone. So what am I missing here? You gave her a job. You were working together.",
        "Quinn: I thought it would make things better. She just got more aggressive and demanding. And then when I let her go, she snapped.",
        "Wyatt: And the police think that the shot came from her house?",
        "Ridge: That direction, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Show me.",
        "Quinn: No, you two go. I don't want to see it again.",
        "Ridge: We'll be right back.",
        "Quinn: Katie, why aren't you at the police station?",
        "Liam: So, everyone's busy, yeah?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah, lots of work, big changes. But it's been fun.",
        "Steffy: Working at Forrester wasn't?",
        "Thomas: I'm not comparing the two.",
        "Steffy: I don't really think there's a comparison.",
        "Thomas: Okay, we're just getting started, and yes, there are a lot of changes, but it's been really exciting. New stuff is happening.",
        "Sally: Thomas has brought a whole new energy and attitude to Spectra.",
        "Steffy: Oh, wasn't that the point, luring him into the fold? I mean, it gives you credibility. It repairs your reputation.",
        "Sally: Thomas has done a lot more than that. He's changed my life.",
        "Steffy: And you certainly changed his.",
        "Liam: Hey, did anybody catch the risotto special? Wasn't, um...",
        "Thomas: Yeah, it's right there.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, Steff, she did change mine.",
        "Sally: Steffy, I'm sorry that I stole from your family and I harmed your company. I understand why you don't trust me after all of the stunts I pulled. I'm trying to make amends, but you should never, ever question how I feel about your brother, how grateful I am for his love and his generosity and his unbelievable forgiveness. I have so much respect for him as a designer, as a person, and as a man. We're damn lucky to have him over at Spectra, and I am extremely lucky to have him in my life.",
        "Wyatt: Like inches. Seriously? Mom was shaken up.",
        "Ridge: Of course she was shaken up.",
        "Wyatt: Could Katie really be the shooter?",
        "Lt. Baker: GSR results won't take long. So, tell me some more about your relationship with Quinn. You said you two don't like each other?",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Lt. Baker: Baker. Send him in.",
        "Katie: Eric.",
        "Eric: I've been told what happened.",
        "Lt. Baker: How's your wife doing?",
        "Eric: She's upset. May I speak to Katie alone, please?",
        "Katie: You know, um, whatever you have to say, you can say in front of lieutenant baker, because I don't have anything to hide from him.",
        "Eric: Okay. Katie, um... you and I are friends for a long time. I admire you, and I respect you, and I --",
        "Katie: And -- and I feel the same way about you.",
        "Eric: The things I've been told --",
        "Katie: Well, whatever you've been told, it's not true!",
        "Eric: Did you hold a gun on Quinn?",
        "Katie: Oh, god. Okay, that was -- that was really stupid. It was. But I was just trying to make her feel the way she makes us feel -- intimidated and... [Sighs] You know what she's done, but I don't think you realize the kind of woman you're married to!",
        "Eric: Did you try to kill my wife?",
        "Katie: No! [Chuckles] I mean, this is -- this is totally insane! I cannot believe I'm here! I mean, I don't like Quinn, all right? Yeah, I don't like her, and I don't trust her, but my god, I would never -- I would never kill anyone! I would never do anything like that, and... [Sighs] Someone is out there who tried to kill your wife, okay? Not me. Someone is out there who wants Quinn dead.",
        "Quinn: Katie? Are you here?",
        "[Floor creaks]",
        "Quinn: Hey! Uh, who are you?",
        "Sheila: Sheila."
