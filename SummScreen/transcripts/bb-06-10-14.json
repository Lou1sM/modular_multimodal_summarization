        "At Big Bear Wyatt takes Hope's hand and says his mother's actions do not define him so she should not matter. She says but her actions do influence him. She says he is Quinn's whole world and she does not think she can be part of that anymore. He says he is not going to lose her because of his mother. At Liam's, Quinn gloats that Hope is with Wyatt right now and if he thinks she is coming back to him tonight then he is cuckoo crazy. He takes that as a compliment coming from her. Quinn says he can be delusional if he wants, she just thought he ought to know. Liam says that is not why she came. She is going to ambush Hope the minute she walks through that door. Quinn say again, she is not coming back here. Liam says Hope has re-committed herself to him ..and everybody is on to Quinn now ..Brooke, Eric, everyone who matters at FC, and when they find out her true involvement in what happened to Ridge, she and Wyatt will be out at FC and more importantly out of Hope's life. She counters with that she is known for her expertise in jewelry, not her sparkling personality. She doubts they will fire her over a photo accidentally sent to Ridge, but even if they do it will not change Hope's feelings for Wyatt. Maybe Hope said a few words in anger but they have real passion and Liam has seen it and after spending some alone time with Wyatt she will not leave a real man and come back to a boy like Liam. He tells her there are a millions things she ought to be doing now, like praying, groveling, fleeing the country but instead she is over here harassing him. And she only has one thing on her mind, - Wyatt must have Hope. But her one track mind is about to bite her in the butt. Aly tells Ollie and the group that whatever happens to Ridge, Quinn is responsible. He hugs her and says The Forrester's are tough and if he is anything like her, he will be fine. Pam tells Rick not to wait for his parents to get back. As President, he should fire Quinn right now tonight. Maya spies Ollie kissing Aly and is concerned.",
        "Wyatt tells Hope that he feels like he is losing her and he can't let that happen. She reminds him that he knew she was not going to drag this out and would make her decision. He says this is all about Ridge. Just forget their parents, look him in the eye and tell him that she does not love him. He says she is simply not ready to walk away from them. Hope answers that it is not that she wants to walk away; she doesn't want to give it up but she has to. All because of what his mother has done to them and it does matter to her. Wyatt says he will prove her wrong. He can distance himself from his mother. She says she forgave him for the diamond heist and she meant that and it's not just him or his mother. She has changed and she thinks she justified a lot of things that she shouldn't have. She says all she knows is that she has had enough and now Ridge may be dead. She will always care about Wyatt but she can not do this anymore. He says he does not believe she means what she is saying. Yes he knew she was dating both but he always knew she would chose him and get Liam out of her system and she still can. She is just settling. She says she made the only decision she could live with and she is not settling. He asks her not to sacrifice everything they have over a punch or because of his mother. She admits she loves Wyatt but she trusts Liam. He lashes out that he can't believe she had rather spend her life with a guy who writes fashion articles in between yoga classes and rescues puppies and saves kittens. She says those things are important to her and she is glad she is with a man who thinks of those things and not just of himself. And when she is with Liam, she knows exactly what she is going to get and that is what she wants. That's her future. He says just to focus on them. He has changed since being with Hope. There is a reason he brought her here to Big Bear. Just take a step back and spend the night and in the morning it will all make sense. She says no she can't do that. He says she can stay in the cabin and he'll stay in a tent in the back yard. In the morning she can snap a picture of him and he can chase her through the woods and he will kiss her and they can start over. She cries that she can't do that. He says maybe he made a mistake but he wanted to be different than Liam with no pressure, no ultimatums, and he is offering her complete devotion here not insecurities. He says he loves her with everything that he is and always will. Yes he has made mistakes and he has a crazy mom. She agrees that she does not regret a thing they have done. He opens his hand and holds up a ring and sincerely asks her to say yes, be his wife."

        "Wyatt: I am not my mom, okay?",
        "Hope: I know.",
        "Wyatt: So, then why does she matter? Her actions, her words -- they don't define me.",
        "Hope: They influence you. You are Quinn's world.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Hope: And I don't think that I can be part of it anymore.",
        "Wyatt: I'm -- I'm -- I'm not losing you because of my mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hope is with Wyatt right now. If you think she's coming back to you tonight, you're cuckoo crazy.",
        "Liam: Aw, cuckoo crazy? That's such a compliment coming from you.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Fine. Be delusional if you want. I just thought you should be prepared.",
        "Liam: Well, that's sweet. Is that why you came by? Come on, Quinn. The reason you showed up is 'cause you plan on ambushing Hope the minute she walks through my front door.",
        "Quinn: Mm. She's not coming.",
        "Liam: Quinn, Hope all but committed herself to me tonight. She's finally seeing you and Wyatt clearly, and, by the way, she's not the only one. Brooke, Eric, everyone over at Forrester who matters is on to you now, and as soon as the word gets out about what happened to Ridge and your involvement, you and Wyatt are out at Forrester, and, more importantly, you're out of Hope's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Quinn set this whole thing up?",
        "Pam: Yeah, and all because she wants Bill Spencer. I mean, who in their right mind would want -- excuse me, Caroline -- who would want to interrupt such a beautiful wedding between two such obviously happy people?",
        "Caroline: Well, clearly, Quinn has unresolved feelings from back in the day.",
        "Maya: Crazy...how one picture can cause so much damage.",
        "Rick: She knew it, too. That's what's so disgusting about this whole thing. She knew exactly how Ridge would react.",
        "Carter: Used him.",
        "Aly: Whatever happens to uncle Ridge, she is responsible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Don't get ahead of yourself. I work at Forrester because of the quality of my jewelry, not because of my sparkling personality, and I'd be very surprised if they fired me because I accidentally e-mailed a photo to Ridge.",
        "Liam: Well, Human Resources might think differently.",
        "Quinn: But even if they do, it's not gonna change Hope's feelings for Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Quinn, why would Hope want anything to do with him now?",
        "Quinn: Oh. Why would she want a man who treats her with respect, who doesn't waffle and bounce from one girl to the other? Yes, why would she want a guy like that?!",
        "Liam: You -- you -- you have a very narrow view of me.",
        "Quinn: Oh. I'm sure you have many fascinating sides, from rescuing kittens to deep-frying tofu in a wok. I mean, I'm sure the party at this house never ends.",
        "Liam: It doesn't! You can leave anytime you want.",
        "Quinn: Yeah? Well, you've seen their connection. You've seen their passion. Hope may have led you to believe that she will be coming back here tonight, words said in anger because of something I did, but after spending some alone time with Wyatt, I'm sorry -- she's never going to leave a real man to come back here to a boy like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I feel like I'm losing you, and I can't let that happen.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, you knew that I was gonna make a decision. You knew I wouldn't drag this out forever.",
        "Wyatt: So, this is decision day, right after my mom did something horrible? Look, you have waited all this time, you dated both of us, and now you're making a decision based on a reaction.",
        "Hope: No. That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Wyatt: Yes -- yes -- yes, it is!",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Ridge might be dead because of my mother, not me.",
        "Hope: This is about more than Ridge.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so forget about our parents. Forget about everyone else. Look me in the eye and tell me you don't love me. You are not ready to walk away from us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Carter: It's an alert I set the other day before Ridge took off.",
        "Maya: \"Racquetball, 7:30 tomorrow.\"",
        "Carter: So I'd remember to pack my gym bag. I swear, Ridge and I got more business done there than at the office.",
        "Maya: They will find him.",
        "Carter: They'd better.",
        "Maya: Did you notice Aly and Oliver?",
        "Carter: What about them?",
        "Maya: The way he touched her.",
        "Carter: Her uncle might be dead.",
        "Maya: Which might make her very vulnerable. You heard the recording on my phone -- Oliver saying he's just putting up with her? I remember being her age -- young and naive -- and I was taken advantage of more than once. I don't want to see that happen to Aly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Okay, Dad. You, too.",
        "Oliver: How's Thorne?",
        "Aly: Worried. He's on his way to Abu Dhabi now, joining the search effort. Is uncle Ridge really gone?",
        "Oliver: You Forresters are made tough. If he's anything like you, he's gonna be just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I just wish that there was something that we could do, some way we could help.",
        "Rick: Yeah. I asked my mom if I should head out there, but I'm needed here more, she said.",
        "Caroline: Well, with Brooke and Eric gone, you are.",
        "Pam: Don't wait, Rick.",
        "Rick: Wait?",
        "Pam: For your parents to get back. You're president. You can do it yourself.",
        "Rick: Do what?",
        "Pam: Fire Quinn -- tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You know what's so strange to me, Quinn? Ridge is missing right now. He could be dead because of you. And I can think of a million things that you should be doing -- you know, praying, groveling, fleeing the country, to name a few -- but instead, you choose to spend your time coming over here and harassing me, trying to make me doubt my relationship with Hope. You got some messed-up priorities, lady.",
        "Quinn: Just because I'm not weeping or gnashing my teeth doesn't mean I'm not concerned about Ridge.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah? Do you feel guilty? Do you feel guilty? No, of course not. People are suffering right now, but you don't care. You have one thing on your mind -- Wyatt must have Hope. So, go ahead. No, please -- belittle me. Try to make me think that Hope is staying elsewhere tonight. I know better. I know that your lies are finally catching up to you. I know that this one-track mind of yours is about to bite you in the butt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: It's not that I want to walk away from this.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. That should tell you something.",
        "Hope: Yeah. It tells me how much you've meant to me.",
        "Wyatt: Don't. Don't do that. Don't with the past tense.",
        "Hope: I don't want to give it up, but I have to, because I really can't take it any longer. Everything that your mom has done --",
        "Wyatt: Doesn't even matter to us! That's what I'm trying to get you to understand!",
        "Hope: But it does matter! It really matters, because she is such a huge influence on you.",
        "Wyatt: Then I'll distance myself. I'll prove you wrong.",
        "Hope: I think that maybe you could do that if it were just about her.",
        "Wyatt: So, it isn't, then?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Wyatt: So, then, it's me?",
        "Hope: No, it's -- it's me. It's -- it's the way that I've changed, the things that I'm justifying. I-I convinced myself that the diamond heist wasn't a big deal.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my g-- okay. This -- this is Aly, then. Aly's gotten to you. This is what this is.",
        "Hope: No, Wyatt. This has nothing to do with Aly.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, it is. She's been harping at you and getting inside your head about the diamond heist.",
        "Hope: No, Wyatt. Look...I'm not mad. I'm not. I forgave you, and I meant it. I meant that. It's -- you know, it's not about the diamond. It's --",
        "Wyatt: I don't understand.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] We had a lot of fun together. And I think that you came into my life at exactly the right time, really when I needed you. But when it comes to settling down and starting a future, you know, when lying comes so easy to you, when punching Liam is your answer --",
        "Wyatt: Like he hasn't hit me before?",
        "Hope: No, it was different. You were kissing me while he and I were engaged.",
        "Wyatt: But you didn't want to be. Otherwise, you would have been the one to hit me yourself.",
        "Hope: All I know... is that I've had enough. So much has happened... and now Ridge could be dead. What am I supposed to do with that? Wyatt... I am always gonna care about you. But I just can't do this anymore. [Crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: How do you do that?",
        "Oliver: What?",
        "Aly: Make me feel like it'll be all right?",
        "Oliver: It will. Ridge will come home.",
        "Aly: And Quinn and Wyatt will go away?",
        "Oliver: And all will be well for the lovely Miss F.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I want Quinn gone as much as you do, Pam, but my father's C.E.O., and I have to talk to him first.",
        "Pam: Do you really think that he'd object?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I mean, especially if Ridge is, you know...",
        "Rick: Even if everything is fine with Ridge, Quinn needs to be held accountable. You know, I was finally starting to think that there was finally a man that she could trust.",
        "Caroline: Well, it sounds like it's less of what uncle Bill did and more of what Quinn did.",
        "Pam: I'm telling you, Rick, she's evil. She needs to be out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Somebody's feeling all high and mighty.",
        "Liam: Well, you know, I got the girl, you and Wyatt are done for, so... yeah, pretty much.",
        "Quinn: This is all your fault.",
        "Liam: Excuse me? How do you figure that?",
        "Quinn: You couldn't just go away -- move to Paris, be with Steffy, find somebody new. No, you had to stay here, pining away for Hope, persecuting Wyatt every chance you got. She was happy. She moved on. Stop getting in the way!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You say these things, but I know you don't mean them -- not by the way that you're looking at me right now.",
        "Hope: I was dating both of you, and you knew that it could go either way.",
        "Wyatt: I knew that it was me and only me. I knew you'd finally get Liam out of your system. You still can.",
        "Hope: I had to make a decision, Wyatt, and I made the one that I can live with.",
        "Wyatt: No. You're settling.",
        "Hope: No, that's not what I'm saying.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. My mother made an insanely stupid mistake, unforgivable, but that doesn't mean go running off with Liam. Don't lump everything that I have done in the past with everything my mom has done. We are different people.",
        "Hope: The past?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, you just punched Liam a couple hours ago.",
        "Wyatt: I know, and I'm sorry about that. I lashed out. But you should have heard the things that he was saying!",
        "Hope: And I'm saying that I've had enough!",
        "Wyatt: Of me?",
        "Hope: Of my... reactions to you.",
        "Wyatt: What are your reactions now? And now? Don't sacrifice everything that we have built because of a punch or because of my mother.",
        "Hope: I'm not.",
        "Wyatt: I don't believe you.",
        "Hope: I was confused, okay? Liam had just let me down so many times.",
        "Wyatt: And then I came along -- a different kind of guy, someone who only focused on you, someone who means what he says. What is it about me that scares you, huh? It can't be a diamond. It can't be a punch or my mother. You love me.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I do.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Hope: But I can trust Liam.",
        "Wyatt: And not me? Because of my mother? You know, I confided in you on that trip about us, about everything that we did to survive, to make ends meet.",
        "Hope: Sending Ridge to stop my mother's wedding has absolutely nothing to do with making ends meet. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know it sounds like I'm blaming you for things that your mother has done, but it's more. It really is more than that.",
        "Wyatt: What is it that you think that we have in common -- that we both make things happen? Yeah, but is that such a bad thing? You'd rather spend the rest of your life with a guy like Liam, who writes fashion articles in between yoga classes and rescues puppies and, and saves kittens and --",
        "Hope: Those are things that are important to me, Wyatt! Those are things that I enjoy, and I'm glad that I'm with a man who thinks about something other than himself! When I am with Liam, I know exactly what I'm gonna get. That's what I want. That's my future. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Thank you.",
        "Oliver: I haven't done anything.",
        "Aly: Are you kidding? You have been so supportive, helping me deal with my issues with Taylor and my mom, and now uncle Ridge is missing, and you are right by my side. You make me feel safe.",
        "Oliver: It's all part of the job, ma'am. Seriously, though, I'm glad you said that. You are always gonna be safe with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You don't get it.",
        "Quinn: What -- you and Hope?",
        "Liam: Yeah, and you never will get it because you don't understand who Hope is or what she stands for.",
        "Quinn: I've seen all the \u0091Hope for the Future' billboards -- values and principles, blah, blah, blah. It's not difficult to grasp.",
        "Liam: And yet you don't, and neither does your son. Morality, Quinn, is very important to Hope. Yes, she was seduced by Wyatt, manipulated by you, but with the kind of integrity she has, I knew it wouldn't be long before she saw you and Wyatt for who you are, and now it's done. She's ending it right now, freeing herself from Wyatt, and we're gonna be married and we're gonna have a life together, and this time, Quinn -- this time -- I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure you can't do a damn thing about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You are angry, frustrated, confused, scared about Ridge. You blame my mom, and rightfully so, but I can't let you give up on us because of her.",
        "Hope: I...warned her. She's trouble. She's crazy, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: I-I-I agree!",
        "Hope: I-I-I've been looking the other way, and I never should have.",
        "Wyatt: Because you care about me. Focus on that, on us. I have changed since being with you. Look where we are, hmm? There's a reason why I brought you here, up to Big Bear, where it all started. Just take a step back, spend the night here, and in the morning, it'll all -- it'll all make sense and be clear.",
        "Hope: No. No, no. No, no.",
        "Wyatt: So, then, you stay in the cabin, then. I'll stay in a tent in the backyard. And in the morning, you can get up. You can snap a picture of me. I can chase you through the woods again.",
        "Hope: [Crying] Wyatt...",
        "Wyatt: And you'd fall. Like, you know, you fall, 'cause, you know, let's face it -- you're kind of a klutz like that. And I'd kiss you. And we could start over.",
        "Hope: I can't do that.",
        "Wyatt: You know, maybe -- maybe I made a mistake trying to play it cool with you, not to rush in to anything and not to make a commitment. I wanted to be different than Liam -- no pressure, no ultimatums. You know, you needed to see that there was someone out there who could bring out a different side in you.",
        "Hope: And you did make me see that, and, Wyatt, I wouldn't trade anything that we had.",
        "Wyatt: Then don't! Don't! You know, what would it mean if you end up with Liam right now? Why would you want to go back to that insecurity? I am offering you complete devotion here, and I know I've made mistakes along the way -- mistakes that I have owned up to. And, yeah, I got a crazy mom. But have you ever doubted that I couldn't handle her?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Wyatt: Have you ever wondered if you were my top priority or not?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Wyatt: Because I love you -- I do -- with everything that I am. And I always will. Which... is the reason... why I brought you here today.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Say yes.",
        "Hope: Wyatt...",
        "Wyatt: Be my wife."
