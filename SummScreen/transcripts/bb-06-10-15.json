{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7086 ~ Bill pushes Liam in the same direction Quinn pushes Wyatt; Ivy opens up to Quinn."], "Recap": ["Bill follows Liam into his cliff house, still dogging him about selecting and still saying he is committed to Ivy when Steffy is back. Bill reminds him that she still loves him. Liam gives him lip service of course and tells him to drop this. Bill tells him that he can't as Liam may have waited too late already and let someone else snag Steffy as they speak. Steffy is surprised that Wyatt says he will not play second fiddle to his brother and then he kisses her. He says they both spend too much time looking back instead of what is right in front of them. And Ivy is not going anywhere. Ivy is visited by an Immigration officer who basically tells her she only has an Australian passport and not American so she is in the states illegally. Her dad had been wrong when she wrote down dual citizenship. She thinks it is as simple as making it right but the man says it won't be that easy now after the fact. Every day she works here she is breaking the law. She will have to return to Australia to fill out the proper papers and even then she may not return to the states. He tells her to book a flight and send him proof that she is leaving the country or he will be back with a court order. She calls Carter who rushes to her and can not believe she is being deported. Ivy is worried this will mean the end of her and Liam.", "Quinn finds Wyatt working at his desk and she is all giddy and declares love can do that to her. She wants to see Ivy as they are design partners and despite past differences Quinn thinks Ivy has let that go and they are okay. Wyatt admits that love can do that for you, even he has let Hope go for all intents and purposes they are divorced. Quinn picks up on the hint there might be another woman on the horizon for Wyatt and begins to question him. Good naturedly Wyatt tells her she is an overly inquisitive mother and he prefers to keep his private life private. She knows it is not Hope nor Nicole and is excited when Wyatt turns around a picture on the desk of Steffy. He explains they are both ready to move on and find happiness. Quinn finds Ivy in a down mood and picks up the papers saying she will be deported. Steffy walks into Liam's house and senses tension but tells Bill and Liam this is official FC business. She takes out a sexy red lacy teddy and holds it up to herself and says she is thinking of rebooting the lingerie line .do they need to see it on? Liam screams for Bill to leave. Liam tells her that he thought she was going to have sketches first. She doesn't want to waste time and asks if it is too risque. He says no, for once he agrees with Bill. It is hot as hell. They end up on the subject that Bill still thinks Steffy is the right woman for him ..except for Ivy is in the way now. But if Liam doesn't make his move, someone else might. Steffy states that it is not Carter or Charlie but someone with Liam's same last name. He blows a gasket when he realizes it is his brother, Wyatt ..anybody but Wyatt! She explains that Wyatt kissed her. Liam hopes she slapped his face and walked away. Steffy tells Liam that she put her feelings out there more than once and was told every time that Liam was committed to Ivy so she is simply moving on. She did not get over him in Paris. She kept thinking he'd get over Ivy but he might not be honest with himself. If Liam wants her he needs to show her now."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: Go ahead. Try to run. But I'm serious about this, Liam.", "Liam: Yeah, so am I. Stay out of my love life.", "Bill: Your life with the Aussie.", "Liam: Yeah.", "Bill: That's not going anywhere now that Steffy's back to stay.", "Liam: Would you please stop? Please stop. Please.", "Bill: I'll stop. As soon as you stop denying that we both know what I'm saying is true.", "Liam: Okay, how many times do I have to say this? I'm committed to Ivy.", "Bill: How committed? How committed and for how long now that Steffy is back in your orbit? All that history you share, all that --", "Bill: There's still all that chemistry, Liam. Come on. I mean, are you gonna deny that Steffy excites you in a way that...no other woman can? You went to Ivy because Steffy was gone. But now Steffy is back, and she is still in love with you. But you better make a move before some other guy does. Hell, that could be happening right now. Is that what you want?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: You won't play second string to Liam. But who do you kiss? Me.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Yeah, and I meant it. You and I have spent so much time looking back... instead of...to what's standing right in front of us.", "Steffy: Which is...?", "Wyatt: Well, that's what we need to be open to finding out, especially you. Because like it or not, Liam is committed to Ivy. [Australian accent] The girl from down under? [Normal voice] She's not going anywhere.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Okay, so -- so you're from...?", "Agent McCaffrey: Immigration and customs enforcement. You are Ivy Forrester?", "Ivy: Yes.", "Agent McCaffrey: The same Ivy Forrester that applied for a work permit from the U.S. Government to work in, uh, Paris a few months ago?", "Ivy: Yeah, mm-hmm.", "Agent McCaffrey: Did you go to Paris, do the work?", "Ivy: Yeah, I did. Why?", "Agent McCaffrey: Well, at the time, you represented yourself as having dual citizenship, Australian and U.S.", "Ivy: Well, that's because I have dual citizenship. My dad's American, my mom's Australian, so...I'm a citizen of both.", "Agent McCaffrey: Technically you could have been if you would have filed the proper paperwork.", "Ivy: I don't understand.", "Agent McCaffrey: Your passport's Australian. Your U.S. Passport?", "Ivy: Well, I've never had one.", "Agent McCaffrey: Why not?", "Ivy: I -- because my dad's always just told me that I'm a citizen of this country.", "Agent McCaffrey: Well, your father was wrong.", "Ivy: Look, if this is just a matter of getting a U.S. Passport, I can go down to the passport office and do it now.", "Agent McCaffrey: I'm afraid it -- it's not that simple.", "Ivy: Why not?", "Agent McCaffrey: Well, as I said, your father was incorrect about your dual citizenship.", "Ivy: Okay, but I --", "Agent McCaffrey: There are specific procedures that need to be followed, forms that need filling in. None of which you or your father did.", "Ivy: [Sighs] [Scoffs] Okay, so -- so what you're saying to me is that I shouldn't have gone to Paris.", "Agent McCaffrey: That's exactly what I'm saying. And much more.", "Ivy: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Quinn: Hi, honey! What a surprise.", "Wyatt: Why? We both work here now.", "Quinn: [Sighs] That's not what I meant. Is, um -- is Ridge around?", "Wyatt: In the building or around in general?", "Quinn: Okay. What about Ivy?", "Wyatt: What about her?", "Quinn: She wanted some feedback on these designs.", "Wyatt: From you?", "Quinn: I'm her design partner.", "Wyatt: See, I don't know if partner would be the best way to describe what you are to Ivy.", "Quinn: Okay, okay, all right. Okay. You know, I may have done some not-so-nice things to her in the past, but we've made it through all of that.", "Wyatt: Wow.", "Quinn: Yeah.", "Wyatt: Marriage really has changed you.", "Quinn: I know, I know, I know. But of course, when you're in love...", "Wyatt: Yeah. A feeling that...oh, I used to know back in the day.", "Quinn: Oh, honey. Still no word from hope, huh?", "Wyatt: Mom, for all intents and purposes, hope and I are divorced.", "Quinn: And where does that leave you?", "Wyatt: Well, I'm looking in another direction now.", "Quinn: Oh, my God. Is there a new woman?", "Wyatt: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: I thought you liked Ivy, dad.", "Bill: Ivy's great. I like Ivy -- beautiful, hot... but what I feel about Ivy is beside the point.", "Liam: Well, apparently not, otherwise you wouldn't be pushing Steffy at me.", "Bill: I don't have to push Steffy at you, not after everything you've meant to each other.", "Liam: [Chuckles] Okay. Really, this is none of your business.", "Bill: Sure it is. You're my son. You're my business. Your happiness is my business. So that means I have to get in your face and force you to look at a situation honestly.", "Liam: What situation, dad? There is no situation.", "Bill: Okay. Pretend like what you're feeling for Steffy isn't scaring the hell out of you. Let some other guy ride in there and sweep her off her feet. See how you feel then.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Steffy: Hello! Oh. Hey, you two. What am I interrupting?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Agent McCaffrey: Not only shouldn't you have gone to Paris, you should not be working in this country, either. In fact, every day that you're in this office, you're breaking the law.", "Ivy: Well, I mean, how can that be? This is -- this is my family's business. It's owned by Forresters. My last name is Forrester.", "Agent McCaffrey: Unfortunately that doesn't change your citizenship status. You're an Australian citizen, which means -- which means --", "Ivy: Okay, okay. There has clearly been a huge misunderstanding. I'm sure there's something we can do to figure this out.", "Agent McCaffrey: Yes, there is. You go back to Australia, ma'am.", "Ivy: Okay. Okay, well, I-I'll book a flight home, and I'll apply for the right working permit, and then I'll return.", "Agent McCaffrey: No. I'm afraid you won't be coming back anytime soon.", "Ivy: Why not?", "Agent McCaffrey: You broke the law, ms. Forrester. Now, I've seen these things drag on for years, if you're ever allowed to come back. Look, I-I could bring you in right now, but I'm gonna give you this opportunity.", "Ivy: Wait. Are you saying I may never be allowed to return to the states?", "Agent McCaffrey: Given this violation, there certainly is a chance of that, yes.", "Ivy: I need to talk to a lawyer.", "Agent McCaffrey: That's your prerogative, but I can assure you these deportation papers -- they're in order. Now, you need to obtain proof of travel -- a ticket, anything indicating that you are leaving the country -- and it needs to be delivered to me. Otherwise, I'll be back here, and with a court order. Either way, you're leaving the country.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: What? Who said anything about a new woman?", "Quinn: [Chuckles] Don't even, Wyatt Spencer. I know you too well.", "Wyatt: Apparently not as well as you think.", "Quinn: What is her name?", "Wyatt: I'm not saying. Because I prefer to keep the details of my private life private, especially from my way-too-inquisitive mother.", "Quinn: No, no. What you call inquisitive, I call making sure the young woman is worthy of my son.", "Wyatt: Oh. Oh, you got anyone special in mind?", "Quinn: Well, let's see. Hope is out, so is Maya's little sister.", "Wyatt: Yeah, I kind of blew it with Nicole. But I got to admit -- it feels pretty good, getting back in the game.", "Quinn: Okay. So, who is this woman? Is she somebody that I know? Come on! [Gasps] No!", "Wyatt: Shh.", "Quinn: Oh! No!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Well, well, well. Look who's here. Perfect timing.", "Liam: Ignore my dad, Steffy. I do. What's up?", "Steffy: I'm here on official Forrester business. All right, boys. Yes or no?", "Liam: What am I looking at?", "Bill: If you have to ask, you really are clueless.", "Liam: Dad, get out. Get out!", "Bill: Uh...okay. One condition. You better take to heart what we were talking about.", "Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Deal. Get out.", "Bill: And as for you and your lingerie line, I got three words. Hot as hell.", "Steffy: Thank you.", "[Door opens, closes]", "Steffy: Well...", "Liam: [Sighs]", "Steffy: [Laughs] Now that I have your father's critique, I'd like my V.P.'S. I'm thinking about rebooting the line. Is it a winner? Or do you need to see it on before deciding?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Ivy: Carter, thank God.", "Carter: Your text said it was urgent. What's going on?", "Ivy: An immigration officer just came and delivered me this.", "Carter: You're being deported?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Steffy Forrester.", "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.", "Quinn: Wow. [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: As I was saying... she's gorgeous, smart...", "Quinn: Mm-hmm.", "Wyatt: ...And we got a lot in common from our past relationships.", "Quinn: Right.", "Wyatt: And we're both looking to move on, find some happiness, excitement.", "Quinn: Of course you are.", "Wyatt: And I told her to give us a chance.", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: Right after I kissed her.", "Quinn: [Gasps] You kissed Steffy?", "Wyatt: Yes.", "Quinn: Oh, my God. She's so hot.", "Wyatt: Okay, I know. And you know me. And when something feels right, I go for it. And this definitely feels right.", "Quinn: I am so happy for you. I mean, she is a strong, independent young woman. I can see this going so far!", "Wyatt: Whoa, whoa, whoa, cupid. Okay. It's not like I've fallen in love with her by any means. We barely even know each other.", "Quinn: [Sighs] I just -- I just want my baby to have what I have.", "Wyatt: Your baby's doing just fine, mom.", "Quinn: Still... I have to ask.", "Wyatt: Mm-hmm?", "Quinn: What about Liam and their history together?", "Wyatt: Well, thankfully, my brother's committed to someone else. And like I told Steffy, Ivy's not going anywhere.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: What did your dad say?", "Ivy: There's no cell service where he is right now. [Sighs] Please tell me there's something you can do.", "Carter: Immigration law is not my expertise.", "Ivy: Well, what should I start doing? Should I go home and pack my bags, never to return? I mean, come on. This is my home. I'm here. I'm working for the family business.", "Carter: The company would hate to lose you -- all of us would, especially...", "Ivy: No, don't. Pl-- ugh. Just don't even say it. I can't -- I can't even imagine leaving Liam right now and being separated from him. I mean, no, not everything is perfect, but... oh, my gosh! How is this happening?", "Carter: Ivy, I'm sorry. I really am. But based off these deportation papers and what you've told me, I...", "Ivy: [Sighs] How am I gonna tell Liam? What if this is goodbye forever?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: [Chuckles] Whatever happened to doing sketches first?", "Steffy: Why waste time? I told one of our top sewers my idea, and she whipped up this prototype. What's wrong? Is it too risqu\u00e9 for your taste", "Liam: [Chuckles] No, no, for once in my life, I actually agree with my father. It's hot as hell.", "Steffy: Speaking of bill, what was that all about you giving deep thought to his advice? Advice about what?", "Liam: [Sighs] You know. You -- you know how my dad feels about our relationship.", "Steffy: Oh, that he thinks I'm perfect for you because I am?", "Liam: Yeah, and he thinks I should make a move now before somebody else snatches you up. [Sighs]", "Steffy: He does have a point.", "Liam: What does -- what does that mean?", "Steffy: What do you think it means?", "Liam: Are you dating someone?", "Steffy: Too soon to tell.", "Liam: Who? Someone at work?", "Steffy: Yeah.", "Liam: Uh...Charlie?", "Steffy: He's too old.", "Liam: [Chuckles] Carter?", "Steffy: Too tall.", "Liam: Oliver.", "Steffy: [Inhales sharply] Already taken.", "Liam: Okay, give me a hint.", "Steffy: He has the same last name as you.", "Liam: No, no, no! Not Wyatt, Steffy.", "Steffy: We're not talking, like, seeing each other.", "Liam: [Sighs]", "Steffy: Actually, not talking much at all... with him kissing me and all.", "Liam: You -- you kissed my brother?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Oh, hey, Ivy. There you are. I thought we could go over these sketches. Ivy? Is everything okay?", "Ivy: This is really not a good time, Quinn.", "Quinn: Why? What's the matter?", "Ivy: [Sighs] Who said something's wrong?", "Quinn: Oh, okay. All right. Well, then there's nothing wrong. It's not the vibe I'm getting. Um, well, can we talk about these sketches?", "Ivy: No, I-I-I actually -- I can't deal with those right now.", "Quinn: Okay. When do you want to deal with them, 'cause Ridge wants them on his desk by --", "Ivy: Quinn, I said not now, okay?", "Quinn: Okay, look, I realize that there may be some residual resentment towards me, but, you know, since I've been back at Forrester, I feel like we've been working pretty well together. So if I've done something to offend you --", "Ivy: Honestly, this is not about you.", "Quinn: Well, then is it about these papers?", "Ivy: Quinn, just --", "Quinn: Well, I mean, if it's about the jewelry line --", "Ivy: No, Quinn, please d--", "Quinn: You're being deported?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Look, neither one of us should be anyone's second choice.", "Steffy: Speak for yourself, hot shot.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Okay. Blame it on timing, circumstance, but the point is we're both unattached.", "Steffy: Maybe I want to be single for a little longer.", "Wyatt: Yeah, maybe I do, too. And maybe you might have just a little bit more fun with me.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Wyatt kissed me.", "Liam: Yeah, and then you slapped him, and you were like, \"never touch me again!\" [Sighs] You -- did you kiss him back?", "Steffy: Uh, it was more like --", "Liam: Never mind. I don't want to know. I don't want to know. Ugh.", "Steffy: Fine. I'll drop it.", "Liam: No, we are not dropping this.", "Steffy: You're jealous.", "Liam: I'm -- I'm... why does it have to be Wyatt, Steffy? Seriously, it's --", "Steffy: Liam, I have been completely honest with you. I put myself and my feelings out on the line more than I probably should have. I was hoping that you and I would get back together, but you said you are committed to Ivy. So I'm moving on. I'm living my life. Even though...", "Liam: What?", "Steffy: From the way you're reacting right now... but if Ivy's the one you truly want... you know, I spent all this time in Paris trying to get over you, and I did try, but it didn't happen. Maybe that's because no one understood what I was feeling.", "Liam: And Wyatt does?", "Steffy: I can't keep doing this, Liam -- thinking things are gonna change between you and Ivy. You made it very clear about your feelings for her, okay? But something tells me that you're not being honest with yourself. If you want me... I need to know. Now. Show me, Liam."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DyVXT_11As"}
