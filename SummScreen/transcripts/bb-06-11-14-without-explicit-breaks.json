        "Wyatt holds the ring up for Hope and asks her to marry him. She shakes her head and says she does not know what to say. He says yes will work. He gets down on his knees and says just be his wife. He's known for a long time since they met that this moment was going to come. She says the ring is really lovely ..he says at least he has good taste in jewelry. She says he has a lot more than that going for him. Quinn tells Liam just look at him, he looks so cocky and confident that just a little bit of him reminds her of his father. And that is a good thing as women love confidence and that will help him further down the line when he is looking for someone new. Liam smiles and says well Hope has told him to his face that she wants to be with him. Quinn says things change so let's see how it looks after she has spent a romantic evening with Wyatt. Liam says Hope is breaking up with him but maybe Quinn finds that romantic. She says she is not going to take the blame even if Ridge is dead and they are all idiots to even suggest it. If Ridge is dead, it's his own damn fault. And so ridiculous that she has to defend herself and more so that Wyatt has to suffer any consequences. He says she has done a lot of dirty things but this one is finally going to get her son out of their lives. Maya snoops and sees Ollie kissing Aly. She tells him that she wants to freak out because of Ridge but she's not and that is all due to Ollie and how much he has helped her with her problems. But she thinks she needs to go tell Liam to make his move now since Quinn's interference will affect Wyatt too. Ollie calls her a cute matchmaker. She says they do not need a matchmaker but Hope does need to come to her senses. As soon as she leaves Maya marches in and slams the door. Ollie gets her to spill what is wrong. She tells him that they both know that he is taking advantage of Aly so stop using that poor girl. Ollie says it is not what she thinks; he really likes Aly. He says he is not going to argue with her about this. Aly has had a tough time and now with Ridge, so he is not backing off. He says their feelings have grown and he deeply cares about Aly. Rick calls Carter in to draw up some documents. It might be premature but he's all but certain they will be firing Quinn. Caroline says maybe Quinn will just quit since everybody there hates her now. Charlie says he thinks Miss Permafrost enjoys that sort of environment. Quinn walks in and asks what they are all talking about. Wyatt says his knees are hurting and Hope tells him to get up. He says he really wants an answer first. But the phone rings and Hope has to get it. It's her mother. Brooke tells her there is no news but she warns her about Quinn's involvement. She says Quinn better pray that Ridge is alive or Brooke does not know what she will do. Hope says Ridge is alive. They have to keep believing that. Hope tells Wyatt that her mom blames his mother; she absolutely hates her. Wyatt is concerned but says Ridge could still be alive. Aly finds Liam alone and he said she just missed Quinn; she's in full panic mode because of Ridge and how this might affect Wyatt. She notices his face and realizes Wyatt did that to him. Liam says it is okay, one of the reasons that Hope is with Wyatt now ending it between the two of them. Hope tells Wyatt they have had a beautiful story until now but she feels like there is more. It might also have gotten Ridge killed. She hired Quinn and let her into the company and now Ridge is gone. And this is the man that stepped up and became her dad when her own dad wanted nothing to do with her. He takes her hand to explain but she pulls away. She tells him she thinks it might be best if he and Quinn were gone by time her mom gets back. Quinn says this little pow wow must not be too important otherwise Pam would be passing out her lemon bars. Pam says actually she is going to make a big batch as soon as she gets home. They do have a lot to celebrate. Quinn thinks that means Ridge is alive. Rick says no but Quinn is still gone. She says if it is because of the selfie she does not think he has a leg to stand on. But go ahead, he will be spending a lot of money on court fees. And she warns him that she is pretty good with the jury. Her phone rings and it is Brooke. Quinn says that she hopes Brooke is not too mad at Ridge for sharing a private moment between her and Bill. Brooke is appalled that Quinn is blaming Ridge for all of this. She says this was all Quinn's fault; she sent him here and she is not losing Ridge because of Quinn.",
        "Wyatt repeats what Hope said \u0096 she wants them out of FC. She says Quinn has crossed too many lines so using her jewelry now seems almost impossible. Wyatt says they can send Quinn back to the warehouse and he can be Hope's contact. She says that is not going to be the answer. They have to be done. She just lost track of HFTF. Her line stands for honesty and decency and she is sorry but his mother does not have a decent bone in her body. He counters with Quinn's integrity but that is not his. He knows Hope is struggling with the mistakes Wyatt has made but she has to admit he is different from his mother. She acknowledges that. She says she is very proud of Wyatt to come from a mother like that with his only influence. It makes her excited to see what he is going to do and what he can become and can accomplish. He says yes and with a gorgeous wife at his side. She says yes and maybe one day she will meet her. Before he can say more she tells him that she made a decision. She is going back to Liam. They have had a really amazing journey but this is where it ends. He asks if this is the bad boy affair in her life. She admits that he brings out something different than Liam. It's powerful and sexy but that is now who she is. He says she's wrong. That is who she is now and there is nothing wrong with that. She says maybe that is not who she wants to be. He gets it, she wants to be the sweet, innocent Hope for the rest of her life. She stepped out of her comfort zone and had fun with him. She had her freedom finally and she can not just go back. He starts to kiss her but their lips barely touch when she pulls away. She grabs her purse and leaves even with him calling after her. Quinn tells the group that Brooke has some misplaced doubts but she won't hold that against her. Ridge will be found and back here before they know it. Rick says but Quinn won't. He wants her and Wyatt to be as far away with their costume jewelry as they can be. FC was fine without them and they will be again. They are taking out the trash. Slowly Wyatt blows out the candles and sits and reflects on Hope's beauty wearing the diamond, their time in Hawaii, on a HOTT road trip to Emerald Bay and making love in the tent on the beach. Liam is waiting and is relieved when she walks into his arms. She says she told Wyatt and it was painful as he even proposed. Obviously she turned him down and she even felt relieved on the way home that she was coming home now to where she belonged to the man she is supposed to be with .no doubts in her mind, none at all. She thanks him for not losing faith in her when she lost track of that. She thinks she just needed to step away so she could see themselves clearly. She says she loves him and they kiss with her clinging to him."

        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] \"Yes\" works. Say you'll be my wife.",
        "Quinn: Oh, look at you -- so cocky and confident. You know, sometimes, you actually do remind me just a-a little bit of your father, which is good. You know, women like confident. It'll help you down the line when you're looking for somebody new.",
        "Liam: Quinn, hope told me to my face that she wants to be with me.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, you know, things change. Let's see how she feels after her romantic evening with Wyatt.",
        "Liam: She's breaking up with him. How -- never mind. Look who I'm talking to. Maybe you do find that romantic.",
        "Aly: You know what's weird?",
        "Oliver: What?",
        "Aly: I'm away from my father for the first time in, well, ever. He's always taken care of me. But, look, I'm -- I'm fine -- stronger than before. And it's all because of you. Even in a time like this -- uncle Ridge is missing -- part of me just wants to freak out. But I'm not. Your support really makes all the difference.",
        "Oliver: I don't have anything to do with it. It's all you, miss F. You're growing up.",
        "Aly: You know what I just thought of?",
        "Oliver: What?",
        "Aly: Liam needs to know.",
        "Oliver: About us?",
        "Aly: No, about Quinn -- what she did. If she's being held responsible for uncle Ridge's disappearance, that affects Wyatt, too. I've got to go.",
        "Oliver: To see Liam?",
        "Aly: This is the time for him to make a move.",
        "Oliver: You are such a cute matchmaker.",
        "Aly: They don't need a matchmaker. Hope just needs to come to her senses.",
        "Oliver: Call me later?",
        "Aly: You know I will.",
        "Oliver: [Exhales deeply]",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Oliver: Whoa. What's going on?",
        "Maya: You have got to stop this.",
        "Oliver: Stop what?",
        "Maya: Aly thinks you really like her.",
        "Oliver: I do.",
        "Maya: No. You're taking advantage, and we both know it. Stop using that poor girl.",
        "Carter: Hey. I got your message. Any news?",
        "Rick: Not yet. [Sighs] Carter, I need you to prepare some documents for me. It might be a bit premature --",
        "Pam: No. More like a long time coming.",
        "Rick: Maybe so.",
        "Carter: What kind of documents?",
        "Rick: Termination. I'm all but certain we'll be firing Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Hope has some misguided ideas about me -- having absolutely nothing to do with Wyatt -- but he'll calm her down and make her see what a huge overreaction she's making.",
        "Liam: Overreaction? Quinn, where's Ridge? Where is he?",
        "Quinn: Uh, well, he's not dead, and even if he is, I'm not going to take the blame. You're all a bunch of idiots for even suggesting it. Was I flying the helicopter? Did I push him out? Did I even ask him to go and stop that wedding? No. If Ridge is dead, it's his own damn fault, and it's ridiculous that I have to defend myself and even more ridiculous for Wyatt to suffer any consequences.",
        "Liam: Oh, no, you both will. Of course, your mind is the only one warped enough not to understand your involvement, but hope, Brooke, everyone else blames you. Now, Quinn, you've -- you've done a lot of evil things in your life, but this one -- this is the one that's gonna finally get you and your son out of our lives.",
        "Wyatt: From the moment that we first met here in big bear, I-I knew this moment was gonna happen. And you knew, too. And how we feel about each other and the time we've shared and all the fun we've had...",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: I mean, how could this not happen?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: You know, marriage and family -- it's ours. Just marry me. If you don't like the ring, I-I-I can --",
        "Hope: No. No, no, no. It's -- Wyatt, it's beautiful.",
        "Wyatt: That's one thing I got going for me -- good taste in jewelry.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] You have a lot more than that going for you. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: So, is -- is that a yes?",
        "Wyatt: Um, my knee is getting a little sore down here.",
        "Hope: Oh, I'm sorry. Get up. Stand up.",
        "Wyatt: No, I-I'm kind of waiting for my answer first.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on.",
        "Hope: I...",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: Can -- thank you.",
        "Wyatt: Go ahead...unless it's Liam. Please don't answer.",
        "Hope: No, I don't -- I don't know who it is. Hello?",
        "Brooke: Hope.",
        "Hope: Mom, hi. Hi. Is -- is there any news?",
        "Brooke: I don't know. I-I don't know what to think.",
        "Hope: Well, we're gonna find him.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I know. I know. I just can't believe she would do this.",
        "Hope: Who?",
        "Brooke: Quinn. She did this. She set this in motion. And I'm not gonna be able to forgive her. She just better pray that Ridge is alive, because if he's not... I don't know what I'll do.",
        "Hope: He's alive, mom. He is alive, and we have to keep believing that. We have to.",
        "Brooke: Yes, of course. Yes. Uh, honey, I got to go. Bill is with the search- team leader right now, and I need to find out what's happening.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. Just, you know, let me know if you hear anything.",
        "Brooke: Okay. I will.",
        "Hope: She blames your mom.",
        "Wyatt: Understandably.",
        "Hope: She hates her. I can hear it in her voice.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but once Ridge is found... he still could be alive.",
        "Caroline: Maybe she'll just quit on her own. I can't imagine her wanting to work here now. Everybody hates her.",
        "Charlie: Well, I get the feeling that ms. Permafrost thrives in that kind of environment.",
        "Quinn: Who are we all talking about?",
        "Oliver: It's not what you think.",
        "Maya: Back off. I'm telling you.",
        "Oliver: \"Back off\"? I'm dating Aly. I'm not gonna argue with you about this. Aly's had a tough couple months here, and now this stuff with Ridge -- she needs me, and I'm not backing off. And, okay, maybe it kind of started out the way you were thinking, but, Maya, it's grown into so much more. I care about Aly.",
        "Aly: I'm sorry if I'm interrupting.",
        "Liam: Oh, no, not at all. It's, uh, too bad you didn't stop by earlier. You would have run into one of your favorite people. Quinn. I'm kidding.",
        "Aly: She was here?",
        "Liam: Yeah, she's in, like, full-on panic mode right now because of Ridge.",
        "Aly: So you know? That -- that's why I'm here.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm so sorry, by the way. Are you okay?",
        "Aly: It's hard not knowing.",
        "Liam: Yeah, how's your dad holding up?",
        "Aly: He's, uh, on his way there -- join the search. He pretends to be so strong when I talk to him, but I know it's not easy. I mean, the thought of losing your brother -- whoa, Liam. What happened to your face?",
        "Liam: Oh. Yeah. Yeah, speaking of brothers...",
        "Aly: Wyatt did that to you? D-does hope know?",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's one of the many reasons she's ending things with him.",
        "Aly: Wait. What?",
        "Liam: As we speak.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] You talk about the day we met like it was fated, you know, to lead up to this beautiful moment, and -- and that's really nice, but I don't think that's the whole story. I think there's more, because meeting you might have also gotten Ridge killed.",
        "Wyatt: What? No.",
        "Hope: I allowed your mom in. I let her into the company, and -- and -- and now Ridge is gone. He's gone, and this is a man who stepped up to be my father when my own dad wanted nothing to do with me. Do you -- do you understand why I can't just forget about that right now?",
        "Wyatt: Of course I do.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: I do.",
        "Hope: Okay. Um... I think that it might be best if you and Quinn were both gone by the time my mom gets back.",
        "Quinn: So, what's this little powwow about? It must not be too important. Otherwise, Pam would be passing out her famous lemon bars.",
        "Pam: Actually, um, I'm gonna be baking up a storm the minute I get home. Turns out we've got a lot to celebrate.",
        "Quinn: Oh, Ridge is alive?",
        "Caroline: We don't know yet.",
        "Rick: Either way, you're gone.",
        "Quinn: Because of a selfie? I don't think you have a legal leg to stand on, but, I mean, go ahead. You're gonna be spending an awful lot of money in court fees. Well, I have to say I am pretty good with a jury.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'm sure they'll be impressed with how good you are with your mouth.",
        "Quinn: Hello?",
        "Brooke: Quinn.",
        "Quinn: I-I've been meaning to call you. It's your mom. Listen, I wanted to tell you how sorry I am about Ridge. I wish he hadn't gotten so upset about a private moment between me and Bill.",
        "Brooke: You are blaming Ridge?",
        "Quinn: Well, I hope you're not too mad at him.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God. You did this, Quinn. You sent him here. I am not losing Ridge because of you.",
        "Wyatt: You want us gone?",
        "Hope: [Inhales sharply] Well, using your -- your mom's jewelry now kind of seems impossible. She's crossed too many lines, and you know that Liam and I would be married right now if it weren't for her manipulations.",
        "Wyatt: So we send her off to the warehouse. I'll be your contact at work.",
        "Hope: That's not gonna work.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Hope: Wyatt, that won't work, and you know it. We have to be done.",
        "Wyatt: Why?",
        "Hope: I got lost, you know? I-I lost track of Hope for the Future. I stand for honesty and decency, and I'm sorry, but your mom just doesn't have that. There's not a decent bone in her body. Her lack of integrity is astounding.",
        "Wyatt: Her integrity -- we're not talking about mine here. All right, and I know you're struggling with the mistakes that I made, but you have to recognize how different I am from her.",
        "Hope: And I do. I really do.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Hope: I'm very proud of you. To come from a mother like that, to have her as your only influence -- you know, to be the man you've turned out to be, that's impressive.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Hope: It really is, and...it makes me excited to see what you're gonna do and the things you're going to accomplish.",
        "Wyatt: With -- with a gorgeous wife by my side.",
        "Hope: Yeah, maybe one day, I'll meet her.",
        "Wyatt: Hope.",
        "Hope: I know. I-I made a decision, okay? I'm going back to Liam. Wyatt, we've had a really amazing journey, but this is where it ends.",
        "Wyatt: I refuse to be the bad-boy affair in your life.",
        "Hope: You do bring out something different that -- that he doesn't, and it's powerful, and it's sexy, but that's -- I mean, come on -- that's not who I am. I've never been that girl.",
        "Wyatt: What are you talking about? That is who you are. There's nothing wrong with that.",
        "Hope: Well, maybe that's not the person that I want to be.",
        "Wyatt: You want to be the sweet, innocent hope for the rest of your life? Fine. But you stepped out of your comfort zone. You had fun with me. You had a freedom finally. You can't just go back.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Oh, God. I'm sorry.",
        "Wyatt: Hope. Hope.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Quinn: Well, that was awkward.",
        "Rick: What did she say?",
        "Quinn: Oh, it -- it must be the stress. She didn't sound herself.",
        "Charlie: This is one stone-cold bitch.",
        "Quinn: What's that, upchuck?",
        "Carter: I'll get started on that paperwork.",
        "Pam: So, uh, Brooke really laid into you, didn't she?",
        "Quinn: Well, Brooke has some misplaced anger, but I am not going to hold it against her.",
        "Caroline: \"Misplaced\"? Quinn, you do understand what's going on, right?",
        "Quinn: Yes. Something terrible has happened to Ridge, and I am the scapegoat, but I'm fine with that. Everybody is upset, not thinking clearly. You need somebody to blame. It's okay. But Ridge will be found soon enough. He'll be fine, and he will be back to work before you know it.",
        "Rick: But you won't. You and your son's lack of judgment has been an absolute travesty, not to mention the liability. We were doing just fine here before you brought on your little costume jewelry. And we're gonna be doing better after. You see, my mom's on board. I know my dad will be, too. We're taking out the trash. I want you gone. In fact, I want you and Wyatt as far away from Forrester as humanly possible.",
        "Singer: She's locked in this love wishing she could get out I wanted her on the way up maybe catch her on the way, on the way, on the way down she's shining like a diamond even when things get dark light a spark cut the lock and get out she shines like a diamond even when things get dark you're in her sights she found her mark it's two-time love",
        "[Both sigh]",
        "Hope: I told him. [Sighs] It was painful.",
        "Liam: How did he take it?",
        "Hope: He proposed.",
        "Liam: Oh.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Are you...okay? It took a really long time.",
        "Hope: Yeah, well, we were up at the cabin in big bear. He had this whole romantic scene. I turned him down, obviously. It's over. [Sighs] On the drive back, I-I felt this enormous sense of relief to know that I was coming home -- the place where I belong, the man that I'm supposed to be with. No question in my mind. No doubts at all. I lost sight of that. I lost sight of -- of us. And you were so patient, and you knew that I was gonna come back to you. Thank you. I think that I-I just needed to step away to be able to see us clearly, you know? Thank you so much for not giving up.",
        "Liam: Never. [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: God, I love you.",
        "Liam: Love you, too."
