        "Brooke: I know that my father was just trying to help when I got Taylor's 2%. He meant well. He just stirred up a lot of feelings from the past. Reminded me of the times when he wasn't there, when I needed him the most.",
        "Bridget: Well, where do things stand right now?",
        "Brooke: Well, I told him to leave.",
        "Bridget: Los Angeles?",
        "Brooke: I don't want him anywhere near me.",
        "Bridget: Wait, Mom. Come on. Is this -- is this what you really want?",
        "Brooke: If I can't count on him, Bridget, I can't trust my own father --",
        "Bridget: Well, he says that he's changing.",
        "Brooke: He slept with Taylor.",
        "Bridget: What?",
        "Brooke: He took advantage of Taylor to get revenge against the Forresters.",
        "Bridget: Wow.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. I know. I mean, he says it wasn't just sex, but he had some kind of connection with Taylor.",
        "Bridget: God. I'm just stunned. I don't even know what to say. Are you sure it was for revenge?",
        "Brooke: I don't know. I gladly would've given Stephanie back her 50%. But my father and Nick, they think that I deserve to be running Forrester Creations, that I've earned it.",
        "Bridget: Well you have.",
        "Brooke: Yes, and now that I am running Forrester Creations, I need to do it right. They want me to fire your father, Stephanie and Ridge. Can you imagine me firing your father?",
        "Bridget: No.",
        "Brooke: And Stephanie, she gave me 50% of the company. And Ridge, he's our lead designer.",
        "Bridget: Well Mom, he's also your ex-husband, and he doesn't make a big secret about wanting to win you back.",
        "Brooke: Honey, I can't fire them.",
        "Bridget: So clearly, this doesn't make Nick happy.",
        "Brooke: No, it doesn't. That's working out of Ridge's old office here at Marone Industries. That's what all this video conferencing equipment is for.",
        "Bridget: Is that going to be enough?",
        "Brooke: Well, it certainly better be, because Ridge is just too important to Forrester.",
        "Bridget: Mom, no. Ridge is just too important to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Model #1: Well aren't you all smiles today?",
        "Ridge: Yes, I guess I am.",
        "Model #1: Must feel good working with lingerie again.",
        "Ridge: It does.",
        "Model #2: So, Brooke's really committed to this?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, she kinda has to be. She's the key to a success.",
        "Model #1: Well, it feels better than ever.",
        "Dante: What do you think?",
        "Ridge: Let me see. I like it. I like it a lot.",
        "Dante: So much of my art is meant to be touched. Now that it's out on lingerie, beautiful woman --",
        "Ridge: Perfect combination. Thank you girls, that's all for now. Bea-u-ti-ful. So I understand you're going to be a member of the family. We're going to be brothers in law?",
        "Dante: Is that going to be a problem?",
        "Ridge: The way I remember it, Bridget was the reason you moved halfway across the world. Not Felicia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Stephen.",
        "Stephen: We need to talk.",
        "Jackie: Do we?",
        "Stephen: I should've explained this earlier, and I'm hoping you'll give me a chance to explain it now.",
        "Jackie: Are you talking about the fact that you slept with me the night after you had a romp with Taylor? Thought so. Come in. Let me fix you a drink. You naughty, naughty boy.",
        "Jackie: Cheers. So, what should we talk about? Taylor, perhaps?",
        "Stephen: News travels fast.",
        "Jackie: Hmm. Not as fast as you.",
        "Stephen: Jackie -- it was not my intention to --",
        "Jackie: The word of your exploits to hit the gossip mill? It's all right, stephen. But really, you want to help brooke. What better way than to give her the company that she loves, and if finding yourself in taylor's bed helped you achieve that goal, then --",
        "Stephen: Not exactly the way it happened. She sisied over her 2% before. Well before.",
        "Jackie: Before?",
        "Stephen: Yes.",
        "Jackie: Well, Taylor's a very attractive woman who obviously made herself very available to you, and if I were in your shoes, who knows, I might have done the same thing. Actually, it's quite James Bond of you, really.",
        "Stephen: You're not angry?",
        "Jackie: Who doesn't find James Bond alluring?",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: There's a lot of dubious motivations flying around lately.",
        "Dante: And me asking Felicia to marry me?",
        "Ridge: Nobody could've predicted that one.",
        "Dante: When did you know your sister to do anything predictable? That's one of her most appealing traits.",
        "Ridge: Look, a shared sense of spontaneity is not the bedrock of a good marriage.",
        "Dante: But we have a child together.",
        "Ridge: A better reason, but still not the only one.",
        "Dante: Your family's very important to me. More than you realize.",
        "Ridge: Look, I've watched my little sister go through hell and back this year. She deserves to be loved for who she is, not just because she gave birth to some guy's child. Now if this little son of yours is the only reason you're proposing to her, I think you owe it to Felicia to tell her that now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Mom, you and Ridge share more than a son.",
        "Brooke: Yes, we have a history.",
        "Bridget: Exactly. And do you believe you can limit your relationship with him to just work? And we know that Nick's not going to put up with his ego, especially now that Ridge violated you.",
        "Brooke: I forgave him.",
        "Bridget: Well, I know -- but you can't expect Nick to understand that.",
        "Brooke: That is why I made this compromise. I'm working here out of this office, instead of at Forrester. That way, I'm still working with Ridge, but not directly.",
        "Bridget: Oh Mother, come on! By not doing what Nick wants, you're just fueling Ridge's desire to win you back. And what is going on with re-launching the bedroom line?",
        "Brooke: Honey, that's all about business.",
        "Bridget: Well, from Ridge's perspective, it's all about you.",
        "Brooke: Well, Ridge is going to have to accept the fact that I am committed to Nick.",
        "Bridget: Oh wow. It's official.",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Bridget: Well, congratulations.",
        "Brooke: Does that bother you?",
        "Bridget: No. No, no -- and Dante asked Felicia to marry him.",
        "Brooke: Felicia? I thought he proposed to you.",
        "Bridget: He did, but I turned him down. So, he just took my ring and asked Felicia instead. She said yes. I think I made a mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: My proposal to Felicia is a bit on the impulsive side.",
        "Ridge: Just a bit?",
        "Dante: Look, I appreciate the fact that you're concerned.",
        "Ridge: I am, because you have feelings for Bridget.",
        "Dante: Look, I want to have a life with Felicia and our son.",
        "Ridge: All her life, Felicia's always hated anything as traditional as marriage, weddings. But you'd never know it from the way she's been acting lately. I've never seen her happier.",
        "Dante: Isn't that what you want?",
        "Ridge: Yes, and I'd like her to stay that way.",
        "Dante: That makes the two of us.",
        "Ridge: Good. Because if you make this commitment, you better make damn sure you honor it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Dante is this amazing, sweet, wonderful --",
        "Brooke: Handsome --",
        "Bridget: Sexy. Mom, what was I thinking?",
        "Brooke: I don't know.",
        "Bridget: Why does it take losing something before you can really appreciate what you have? I've never had someone who went halfway across the world just to see me smile, or hold my hand. God, I -- why didn't I appreciate that when I had it?",
        "Brooke: You've been through a lot this past year.",
        "Bridget: I know that, but it doesn't change anything. Now it's just, really, too late.",
        "Brooke: Only if you let it be.",
        "Bridget: He's engaged to be married.",
        "Brooke: He doesn't love Felicia!",
        "Bridget: That's your family and they have Dino to think about.",
        "Brooke: Honey, they will think about Dino. But it doesn't mean they need to be together.",
        "Bridget: Mom, you didn't see her. She's on top of the world. How am I supposed to take that away from her?",
        "Brooke: Dante is in love with you.",
        "Bridget: Mom, it's just that --",
        "Brooke: Bridget, please don't think about this so much. If this is the way you feel, you have to tell Dante. Now, before it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: You are a dangerously complicated man. And yet, I can't help but find myself attracted to you.",
        "Stephen: I'm not as dangerous as I might appear.",
        "Jackie: No, I don't think you are. And we shall be in-laws soon. So I see absolutely no reason not to concentrate on your positive traits.",
        "Stephen: You think I have some?",
        "Jackie: I can recall one or two.",
        "Stephen: I think you might be more dangerously complicated than I am.",
        "Jackie: You have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I come bearing gifts.",
        "Brooke: Ridge! You shouldn't be here.",
        "Ridge: Oh, but Logan, we've got work to do.",
        "[Bridget remembering]",
        "Dante: You're the only girl for me. You have been, from the first moment we met. When we were in Rome I fell for you. I fell in love with you. And you know what? It kills me, it hurts me, to see you like this, because I would never -- I would never treat you like this. You need a man who loves you for who you are. Bridget, I want you now and forever. Will you marry me? Let me love you. I love you.",
        "Bridget: Thanks for coming by.",
        "Dante: What is this about?",
        "Bridget: I think you know.",
        "Dante: I should've never proposed to Felicia. Because I want you. Do you want me? Damn it, tell me.",
        "Bridget: I -- oh, god -- I can't do this. I can't.",
        "Dante: Look, I promised Felicia a life and a marriage. But it will be a lie.",
        "Bridget: My -- my mom said --",
        "Dante: Tell me.",
        "Bridget: Well, she said that I should listen to my heart.",
        "Dante: What does it say? Your heart, what does it say?",
        "Bridget: That I love you. I love you. I love you. I want you. I want you so badly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Come on Logan. We gotta ride the momentum here. Lay it all out on the table. Show the world we're stronger than ever.",
        "Brooke: It's too soon. A fashion show? We'll never have the new line ready quick enough.",
        "Ridge: Fresh designs are already finished. They're ready for your approval.",
        "Brooke: Well, the video equipment's installed at Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Oh come on, Logan. That's a bunch of nonsense. You know I'm much more tactful than that. I like to touch and feel things. Okay, what are you afraid of sailor boy? What's he going to do, try to kick me out of here like he did Massimo? Let's talk about something more important. What do you think of these?",
        "Brooke: I can't talk with you about panties.",
        "Ridge: Want to try them on instead?",
        "Brooke: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Come on, Logan. Take a look at 'em. Look at the cut, fabric, detailing. Just take a look at this stuff. Tell me I haven't lost my touch, huh? Come on.",
        "Brooke: Okay, you haven't lost your touch.",
        "Ridge: Well, you are my muse. And this one -- this one's for you.",
        "Brooke: Wow, it's beautiful.",
        "Ridge: It's the show stopper. And you're going to model it. You like?",
        "Brooke: Yes, I like. It's stunning.",
        "Ridge: Then you'll wear it?",
        "Brooke: All right. For the good of the company.",
        "Ridge: Back on top, that's where we're going to be. Forrester Creations -- cutting edge, controversial, and you, Brooke Logan, will be front and center of it all. You're not going to marry Nick. I can't believe you're accepting that.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, I can't talk to you about this.",
        "Ridge: Why, because you know it's not right? Brooke, you love me, not that control freak. I can't believe you're so committed to him. We have a son, a family. I want to get back to that life we had, Brooke. I want to get back to it. I have paid for everything I've done to you, Brooke, many times over. Now it's time for you to step up and tell nick it's not going to happen. Come on, all those years, all that history -- the magic dies if you do this, Brooke. Please, just follow your heart. Follow your heart one more time. I swear to you, I'm not going to let you down. Believe me! You've got to believe me here."
