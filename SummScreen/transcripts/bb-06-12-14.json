        "Hope and Liam snuggle on the couch and he says it feels so surreal and has been a long time coming. Both can hardly believe it. He says he would wait for her like forever, which is the way it sort of felt. It just makes him appreciate this moment even more. And he knows they will find Ridge; he is Ridge after all. Hope considers him her father. And just for the record, she doesn't think Wyatt thinks this is all over between them. He says she has that affect on guys. And Wyatt does have something to offer, just not for Hope and he never will. Working late, Wyatt interrupts Quinn as she is working at FC. She is surprised and asks why he's not still at Big Bear with Hope. He tells her those designs are never going into production, the Forrester's do not like her anymore. He tries to break it to her that she is done there; they both are. Hope is through with him. Quinn says he has thought that before. Wyatt barks that this time it is different, thanks to her. He says he has listened to her, her rationalizations, her excuses, he even defended her when he should have known better. But no more; she is on her own and so is he. Quinn tells him to go ahead and think the worst but she doesn't think it is as grim as he is making it out to be. He wonders what part of the Forrester's want nothing to do with her that she doesn't understand. Quinn retorts that the Forrester's are worried; Ridge has not been found and they need someone to blame it on so she is okay with that. He says she put everything in motion with that damn photo when she could have just stayed out of it. Bill was never going to leave Brooke for Quinn, but Hope has left him. And if Ridge was alive, they would have found him by now. It's been too long. He says Eric has lost his son and after what she did, she deserves to too. Aly comes in as Oliver is looking over some Ridge pix on his laptop. He says no news is good news. Carter is fielding phone calls and tells Maya that they have to make it seem like business as usual until they find Ridge. She says he is a very good friend to Ridge. She just wishes she felt that strongly about Oliver's friendship with Aly. They have more words over how sincere Ollie really is. She says Aly would be skeptical if she heard what Ollie said on her phone. Aly tells Oliver that she is just glad that Wyatt and his mom can not worm their way back into FC now that Hope is back with Liam for good. It happened when Ridge went missing and Wyatt went all Neanderthal on Liam. That's what bullies do when they don't get their way. Ollie says guess it was the last straw for Hope. He hopes others do not see him that way. They hug and she says she knows everything she needs to know about him. He says and it's good that Wyatt and Quinn are gone and not him. She says that would never happen as he is too important to this company and to her. He says he may have thought her too young and naive in the beginning but she truly blows him away. Liam tells Hope she will never guess who kept him company while she was at Big Bear \u0096 Mama Grizzly herself. Quinn was pretty confident that Hope would change her mind again after being there with her son. Hope say she also told Wyatt that he and his mom needed to be gone by time her mom got back. Must have seemed like a one/two punch.",
        "Quinn tells Wyatt that he doesn't mean that. She loves him and will always be her son. He backs off and won't let her touch him. She says she is not perfect, far from it, and she knows she does not make it easy. He chokes when he says he proposed to Hope tonight, he said everything he could to keep her from going back to Liam. But she can not be with Wyatt anymore because of what happened. And Quinn knew by sending that e-mail it would send off a chain of events and she would get the last laugh. But guess what, no one is laughing. Three kids may have lost their father and he may have lost Hope. She says no, this is just what is Hope's predictable flight to safety, what is already known. Quinn says Wyatt did not mess up. It was all her so she will go to Hope and ..he blurts out for her not to do that. She is to stay away from Hope and from him too. He says he does not need her help. He doesn't want her help or for her to be near him anymore. He asks him not to be so cruel. He rants that he doesn't like feeling this way about his own mother. But she can not hug him like a five year old. It's an obsession and unhealthy. He tells her that Hope wants them gone by time Brooke gets back. So Quinn needs to go back to the factory and stay there. He says from this point on he wants nothing to do with her. She walks out crying. Aly catches her and asks why she is still here in the building. Quinn says she was just leaving. Aly says she won't need her security pass so hand it over. Quinn steals herself and tells Aly, little girl, she may be a Forrester but she is not CEO and when Eric asks for it, she will give it to him. Aly says she was right about them all along. She is sorry that Ridge may have to pay the price, but at least Hope won't. She is back with Liam where she belongs and Wyatt is too, the loser .just like his mommy. Liam tells Hope that when the time is right he will clean out a few drawers for her things and some space for her kitty adoptee since they are a package deal. And he thinks she is on board with this but he thinks they should wait until they are married before she moves in. She says absolutely, she wants to do it right this time and be the one that finally sticks. He says their happily ever after is finally here."

        "Hope: [Chuckles] Yes.",
        "Liam: It -- it feels surreal, like I -- I just can't believe you're here.",
        "Hope: Well, that is if you still want me after everything I've put you through.",
        "Liam: I would wait for you forever.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Which is kind of how it felt.",
        "Hope: [Laughing] Oh-oh-oh! I'm sorry.",
        "Liam: No. No, that's not -- that's not what I meant. It just, um... it just makes me appreciate this moment so much more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You're wasting your time.",
        "Quinn: Honey, why aren't you in Big Bear with Hope?",
        "Wyatt: Those will never go into production.",
        "Quinn: You don't like them?",
        "Wyatt: The point is, Mom, the Forresters don't like you. You're done here. We both are. And Hope's done with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Aly: I wasn't sure you'd still be here.",
        "Oliver: Any word on Ridge?",
        "Aly: I was hoping you might have heard something while I was with Liam.",
        "Oliver: Let's go with \"no news is good news,\" okay?",
        "Aly: Under other circumstances, maybe, but the longer uncle Ridge is... you -- you put this together?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, just a few pictures I've taken over the years. Thought you might like it.",
        "Aly: I especially like that one. Thank you for doing this for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: I'll let Ridge know as soon as I can. Of cour-- okay. All right. Now I have to go. All right. Thank you.",
        "Maya: How long can you and the Forresters keep this up?",
        "Carter: We have to make it seem like business as usual, for the Forresters' sake and for...",
        "Maya: Mostly for R.J.'s.",
        "Carter: If he heard about his dad before we learned something definite -- but, still, you know the press.",
        "Maya: And they know you. You're not just Ridge's right hand. You're his friend -- a very loyal friend. I just wish I felt as sure about Oliver's loyalty to Aly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Your dad in Abu Dhabi?",
        "Aly: Yeah, he's -- well, he's on his way there. Still no sign of uncle Ridge. Ohh.",
        "Oliver: What?",
        "Aly: He's worried about me, like he doesn't have enough to worry about. [Sighs] I told him you're taking good care of me.",
        "Oliver: Ridge and I have butted heads more than once. Can't wait to pick it up where we left off.",
        "Aly: Well, I can't wait till he's back home and in Quinn's face like uncle Rick was, not that it really matters. There is no way Quinn and her son can worm their way back in here at Forrester, especially now that Hope has ended things with Wyatt -- for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: What happened at the cabin?",
        "Wyatt: I just told you. It's over between Hope and me.",
        "Quinn: Well, you've thought that before.",
        "Wyatt: This time, it's different, thanks to you.",
        "Quinn: Honey, listen to me.",
        "Wyatt: I have! I have listened to your excuses, your rationalizations, and I have defended you when I should have known better. But no more, 'cause you're on your own, and so am I, for the first time in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Inhales sharply]",
        "Hope: Mm.",
        "Liam: No, it only hurts when I laugh.",
        "Hope: [Laughs] Sounds like something Ridge would say.",
        "Liam: Have you, um, talked to your mom?",
        "Hope: Yeah. She called while I was with Wyatt. There's still no sign of him.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: She blames Quinn.",
        "Liam: We all do. But they will find him -- a little worse for wear, maybe, but alive. It's Ridge, you know?",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: He has too much to live for for it to end any other way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You want to believe the worst, go ahead, but I don't think things are as grim as you're making them out to be.",
        "Wyatt: What part of \"the Forresters want nothing to do with you\" do you not understand?",
        "Quinn: Well, the Forresters are worried. Ridge is missing. Hopefully, he'll be found. In the meantime, they need somebody to blame, and I'm the perfect target.",
        "Wyatt: Because you set this all in motion with that damn photo! Why couldn't you have just -- why couldn't you have just stayed out of it?! Dad was never gonna dump Brooke for you, but Hope has dumped me.",
        "Quinn: Yes, maybe for now, but once Ridge is rescued --",
        "Wyatt: What about that do you not understand?! It's been way too long! If he was alive, they would have found him by now! But Eric has lost a son, and after what you've done, you deserve to lose yours, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You know, what hurts the most about this is Ridge and I were not on good terms when he left... and now I have all these regrets when he really was like a father to me growing up.",
        "Liam: He will be again.",
        "Hope: Yeah, no thanks to Quinn.",
        "Liam: I can't imagine Wyatt is too pleased with his mom right now.",
        "Hope: God. I did not expect him to propose tonight. I mean, he said some things that were -- I-I mean, you should know that I don't think he thinks it's over.",
        "Liam: Of course he doesn't. I didn't. You kind of have that effect, Hope.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Liam: But it is over. I mean, you're here, you know what you want, and Wyatt has something to offer, but whatever it is, it's not enough for you, and it never will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: What's wrong with Oliver being there for Aly, especially with Ridge?",
        "Maya: That's exactly my point! Her uncle is missing. It's been a very difficult time for her. It might make her even more vulnerable to Oliver.",
        "Carter: Or she's responding to a guy who genuinely cares for her.",
        "Maya: Right. The same guy who started flirting with her to save his job? Even though he claims that it's now grown into something more.",
        "Carter: Oh, my God. You're still skeptical.",
        "Maya: And Aly would be, too, if she heard what Oliver said about her on that recording on my phone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What you said about Hope cutting Wyatt loose for good -- did Liam tell you that?",
        "Aly: Yeah. It's what he's been waiting for.",
        "Oliver: And what she hasn't been able to do...until now.",
        "Aly: Well, everything's changed -- the situation with uncle Ridge, Wyatt going all Neanderthal on Liam.",
        "Oliver: There was a fight?",
        "Aly: That's what bullies like Wyatt do when they don't get what they want.",
        "Oliver: Must have been the last straw for Hope.",
        "Aly: He was so good at making her believe he was something he wasn't.",
        "Oliver: People might say the same thing about me.",
        "Aly: They -- they don't know you like I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: You're not going to use that tape. Aly's been through enough.",
        "Maya: And I don't want to add anything else. But I also can't take Oliver's word that he's not using her when that's how it all started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I know everything I need to know about you, and you definitely know everything about me.",
        "Oliver: I know you have great instincts about people -- the Fullers, especially. You had their number from the start.",
        "Aly: But in some ways, I wish I'd been wrong about them -- that they weren't the liars and manipulators everyone knows them to be. That way uncle Ridge never would have gone off to Brooke.",
        "Oliver: And Hope would be with Wyatt instead of Liam.",
        "Aly: Okay. Okay. There is one good thing to come from this.",
        "Oliver: Two good things. Two good things. Ridge is gonna be found, and Quinn and Wyatt are gone instead of me.",
        "Aly: Like I would ever let that happen. You are too important to this company...and me.",
        "Oliver: It's crazy, huh, how this relationship started? You, a Forrester, totally different background than mine -- inexperienced, younger.",
        "Aly: Naive?",
        "Oliver: Uh, I might have thought that once, but not anymore. You have just blown me away, Miss F. You truly amaze me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Oh. So, um, this isn't gonna come as too much of a shock, but, uh, you want to guess who kept me company while you were in Big Bear? Mama grizzly.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God. No.",
        "Liam: She was, um -- wow. She was pretty confident that you would change your mind about choosing me after a romantic evening with her son.",
        "Hope: You told her why I went, right?",
        "Liam: To break things off with Wyatt? Yeah.",
        "Hope: Yeah. I also told him that he and his mom needed to be gone from Forrester by the time my mom got back. Must have felt like a one-two punch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You don't mean that, sweetheart. I love you. You will always be my son. I know I don't make it easy sometimes.",
        "Wyatt: Try most of the time.",
        "Quinn: I'm not perfect -- far from it.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I proposed to Hope tonight. I said everything... I did everything that I knew would keep her from going back to Liam. I know she still loves me.",
        "Quinn: Of course she does.",
        "Wyatt: But she can't be with me anymore... because of what happened. You knew by sending that e-mail, you'd set off a chain of events and that you would get the last laugh. Well, guess what -- no one is laughing. Three kids may have lost their father, and I may have lost Hope.",
        "Quinn: No. No. This is just Hope's predictable flight to safety, running to what is familiar and unthreatening.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, it is more than that! Don't you understand? Liam is who she sees her future with. She wants to have children with him. I mean, maybe if I hadn't messed up --",
        "Quinn: No. No, it's me. It's me. It's me, okay? The thought of having me as a mother-in-law scared her away. But I'm gonna go to Hope. I am gonna talk to Hope, and I will tell her that you're not --",
        "Wyatt: Mom, stop! No! You are not going to Hope. Stay away from Hope. Stay away from me, okay? I don't need your help, I don't want your help, and I don't want you anywhere near me anymore, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Don't be intentionally cruel.",
        "Wyatt: You think I like feeling this way about my own mother? No, no, no. You can't hug me like I'm a 5-year-old with a scraped knee.",
        "Quinn: I know you're a grown man with your own life.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Yeah. [Sniffles]",
        "Quinn: But you -- but you are so precious to me. You are my life.",
        "Wyatt: You see that? That is the problem. I shouldn't be your life. Do you understand? It's an obsession. It's unhealthy.",
        "Quinn: I just want you to have the best of everything.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and you'll do anything that you can to keep that -- to make that happen, right?",
        "Quinn: Why is that so wrong? Why are you making this out to be worse than it is?",
        "Wyatt: Wow. The fact that you can even ask me that right now is just so... Hope wants us gone before Brooke gets back. Go back to the factory, Mom. Stay there. From this point on, I don't want anything to do with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Why are you still in the building?",
        "Quinn: I was just leaving.",
        "Aly: Well, I'm gonna need your security pass. You won't be needing it anymore, so hand it over.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You know what, little girl? You may be a Forrester, but you are not C.E.O. of this company. So, when Eric asks me for my security pass, I will give it to him.",
        "Aly: You know, I was right about you and your son all along. I'm just sorry that uncle Ridge may have to pay the price. But Hope won't have to, thank God. She's back with Liam, where she always belonged. And Wyatt -- well, he winds up a loser, just like his mommy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: When the time is right, I'll clear out some drawers in the bedroom, and you can try your best to find a place to put a kitty-litter box.",
        "Hope: Me?",
        "Liam: Yeah, for your little adoptee friend from the shelter.",
        "Hope: My Bu?",
        "Liam: And it's short for \"Malibu.\" I'm telling you, it's written in the stars.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Is he, uh -- whenever you move in, he's coming with you, right?",
        "Hope: Oh, we're a package deal. Take us our leave us.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Yeah. I think I'll take you. I'm just as big a pet lover as you are.",
        "Hope: Well, duh. You wrote that whole article about animal shelters and pet adoptions.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm kind of a softy.",
        "Hope: Yeah, you are. But you're more than that. You're so...honest and... decent, and you're just -- Liam, you're a good person. You are. I really admire you. I love you even more.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Hey, um... I think you're on board with this, but... I don't think you and Bu should move in until after we're married.",
        "Hope: I love that you know me so well.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Hope: No, I -- you're right. It's important to me. I want to do things right. When we do get married, I want that to be the wedding, you know, that sticks, you know? And then that way, we can look back on -- we can tell our future children that --",
        "Liam: How we overcame every single possible obstacle on the planet?",
        "Hope: In the history of ever. Yes, exactly.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Wow. This is really it. You know that -- that \"happily ever after\" we always wanted? We're here... at long last.",
        "Hope: Yeah. [Chuckles]"
