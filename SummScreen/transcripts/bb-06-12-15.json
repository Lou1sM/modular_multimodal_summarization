    "Recap": [
        "Ivy tells Quinn don't. Whatever she is thinking do not do it. She has to face the facts that she is being deported. She does tell her that she slipped into Liam's house and overheard him and Steffy and she is still in love with him and wants him. Quinn tells her that Liam is hers to lose but she can do something about it. She can ask him to marry her. Quinn says it would solve her problems to get a green card. And Liam is just confused. He does not want Steffy. Wyatt walks on in at Liam's and said he knocked but Liam ignored him. Liam hammers at Wyatt that he kissed Steffy. Wyatt asks if he is done with her. He's like a Golden Retriever with too many tennis balls in his mouth and so possessive of an ex-wife when he has moved on with Ivy. Give Steffy a chance to move on too. He says Liam has said repeatedly that he is committed to Ivy and she is not moving back to Australia. Liam suddenly hugs Wyatt and tells him that it will take time but there will be someone else for Wyatt. Wyatt stands back but says Liam is not transparent and certainly not as good a guy as everyone things he is. Quinn gives Steffy some papers and says she is going over to see Ivy. Then she sings Wyatt's praises.",
        "Ivy goes to see Liam and he welcomes her home. She says she wishes it were. She declines wine saying if she starts she might not stop. And it is not Quinn this time. He tells her it is not a big deal but he has something to tell her about Steffy who was here earlier. He starts with that he has been careless with his emotions although he has tried to be honest. She jumps to the conclusion that he might be trying to break up with her. He assures her no, but Steffy keeps reminding him how good they are together and he keeps trying to forget it. But he is having a hard time holding them off like he used to. But he is not making any big announcements and he is not going anywhere. She tells him straight out that she is being deported. Wyatt breaks up the meeting with Steffy and Quinn. Steffy chastises him for talking about her to Liam. Out of curiosity she asks Wyatt what Liam said. Quinn jumps in and says she sees wedding bells in their very near future for Liam and Ivy. Ivy explains this is all true as an Immigration officer found her and explained she does not have dual citizenship and her work visa has expired. She was told to do that. She follows the rules and acted accordingly. Now she has to be in Australia within a week or she is breaking the rules. He tells her they will find a way; there has to be a way. She pours herself a drink after all and says there might be. Steffy throws Quinn out and Wyatt says she does not have to explain. Steffy says he had no right to talk about her. Wyatt said Liam was just being coy today. He and Ivy are inseparable. And he knows Steffy hurt him. Quinn tells Carter that she has an emergency. She did not hurt anybody this time, but Ivy needs to be here and can not go back to Australia. She and Liam belong together and they need to get married if he can marry them today. Ivy tells Liam that she can not tackle one immigration page at a time. There will not be time. He asks her what did she mean by a solution. She tells him her job is here, her family is here and the love of her life is here. She plays by the rules but that is not working. She wants them to be in charge of their future, not because of Steffy. They can do that by getting married now."

        "Ivy: Don't. Quinn, whatever you're about to suggest, please don't.",
        "Quinn: So, you would rather be deported?",
        "Ivy: I have to face reality.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Come on! There's no such thing. Look at you. You're panicking inside, you're trying not to seem desperate all of because of what some lowly functionary said to you? I mean, does that seem like reality? Look, what did you tell Liam exactly?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] I said nothing because Steffy was there. What I heard was him thinking about breaking up with me for her.",
        "Quinn: No. No, did he say that?",
        "Ivy: Well, I mean, no, not in so many words, but I was hiding. They didn't see me.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Well, you know, you don't have to worry about it then. I mean, one of Liam's superpowers is that he can say something that sounds like what the other person wants to hear but, when you break it down, it's not really the case. You know what I'm talking about. So... Liam is yours to lose. But you don't want that, do you?",
        "Ivy: That might not be up to me.",
        "Quinn: Ah! But it can be... if you ask Liam to marry you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Do I get to sign checks?",
        "Carter: Do you know how many checks we cut every month?",
        "Steffy: But then how do I express my presidential powerfulness?",
        "Carter: [Chuckles] Well, as I said, you're empowered to execute employee contracts, domestic suppliers, catering services -- basically, this list here.",
        "Steffy: Do I sign the vice president's contract?",
        "Carter: Liam? No.",
        "Steffy: Can I sign his underwear?",
        "Carter: [Laughs] It's been a while since it was fun around here.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] Bye, Carter.",
        "Carter: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I knocked and you ignored me. Luckily, I'm adept at bouncing back from rejection.",
        "Liam: You kissed Steffy. What are you doing?",
        "Wyatt: Okay. We'll skip the small talk. Are you done with her or aren't you?",
        "Liam: You know something? I'm never gonna be done with Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: What does that even mean? That you're not ready to think of her as your ex-wife?",
        "Liam: You -- you're -- you're transparent.",
        "Wyatt: I'm transparent?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: You are like a golden retriever trying to hold too many tennis balls in his mouth. I mean, don't you have enough, Liam? Ivy, you're the president of dad's company, VP of Forrester, and you still have an appetite after all that?",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, you know what? Your way of lashing out is to lip-lock the closest female that has any connection to me whatsoever. Isn't that what you do? Isn't that right?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my -- are you serious?! I have been working closely with Ivy for a while now. You don't see me putting the moves on her, do you?",
        "Liam: Well, I haven't asked.",
        "Wyatt: And yet here you are acting all possessive over a woman who's not the woman who you say that you're in love with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I'm crazy for coming back here and listening to you.",
        "Quinn: You can't tell me that you've never thought about a happily ever after with Liam.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Quinn, I'm not gonna marry Liam for a green card. That is something that people do in bad rom-coms.",
        "Quinn: I'm just saying you get a lot of bang for your buck out of this. One, you don't get deported, and two, you get to clear up your little Steffy problem.",
        "Ivy: Liam and I are dating. We're good right now. I-I don't want to rush things.",
        "Quinn: Liam doesn't need Steffy. He's confused. That's his natural state. What he wants, what he loves is a damsel in distress.",
        "Ivy: Can you please not patronize me?",
        "Quinn: I'm not patronizing you. I'm just saying if he was willing to jump into a dirty river in Paris for you, he wouldn't hesitate to jump into a wedding ring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Listen, so, Ivy's - Ivy's, uh, on her way over here. She probably should have been here by now. And, um...you know, I'm sure you have work to catch up on.",
        "Wyatt: What, you're shutting me down?",
        "Liam: What do you want me to say, Wyatt? You come over declaring your interest in Steffy. I-I-I appreciate you being open and all, but Steffy makes her own decisions. What does it even matter what I think she should do?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, what you have consistently said, and not today, is that you're unavailable, not single, that you're with Ivy now.",
        "Liam: Life is change.",
        "Wyatt: Wh-what?",
        "Liam: You never know, man. I mean, Ivy might, um...choose to move back to Australia tomorrow.",
        "Wyatt: That is never going to happen. What are you doing?",
        "Liam: I can't give my brother a hug?",
        "Wyatt: No, why? Did I do something nice? I don't know what you're doing.",
        "Liam: Just... be careful.",
        "Wyatt: What? Driving? I don't -- I don't understand.",
        "Liam: You are really raw, and you are not good at hiding it. It's gonna take time. But there will be somebody else for you.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, okay. Wow. Thank you for always reminding me that you're not as good of a guy that everyone thinks you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Keys jangle]",
        "Steffy: Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Hey.",
        "Steffy: Is everyone taking a half day?",
        "Quinn: Uh, uh, well, Ivy decided to head on over to Liam's 'cause they wanted to start their evening early, and so I was elected to show you our latest and greatest.",
        "Steffy: You and Ivy seem to be working well together. I thought you two had issues.",
        "Quinn: Well, that's just all water under the bridge.",
        "Steffy: Ah, so to speak.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I have to give the credit to -- to Wyatt, really. I mean, he's such a great person. He's got -- he's got great interpersonal skills.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Is that what he calls them?",
        "Quinn: Well, I mean, he was working here with Ivy before I came back to Forrester, so he was really the peacemaker between us. You know, he was manly but gentle, really...",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I get it. Your son's a good guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You're home.",
        "Ivy: I wish this was my home.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Liam: How was work?",
        "Ivy: Uh, let's not even go there. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: You want a glass of wine or something?",
        "Ivy: Actually, no. I feel like if I start drinking tonight, I might never stop. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] It can't be that bad. Quinn?",
        "Ivy: She's acting like my best friend, actually.",
        "Liam: Promise me you won't trust that. Rick?",
        "Ivy: No. He hasn't shown his face.",
        "Liam: Steffy.",
        "Ivy: Nope. She hasn't been around either.",
        "Liam: Um...Steffy was here, by the way. It's, um, something I wanted to bring up with you.",
        "Ivy: All right.",
        "Liam: But first, uh, you should -- why don't you wind down from work? Um, settle in. I have some dinner --",
        "Ivy: Liam, I'm not gonna be able to relax if you have something to tell me about Steffy.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, uh, it's not a big deal. Um... maybe it's a big deal. Why don't -- why don't -- why don't we sit down? I've, uh -- I've been careless, emotionally, I mean, with -- with the women I've loved before you. [Sighs] I-I try to be loving, I try to be honest, and I just fail at both, and... I don't want to do that with you.",
        "Ivy: Are you -- are you breaking up with me right now? Is that --",
        "Liam: No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Ivy: Okay, so what are you saying?",
        "Liam: I'm saying -- I'm saying there's...something. I -- [Chuckles] I-I don't -- I don't know if I can put it into words exactly, but I can feel it. And, um...Steffy keeps on reminding me about how -- how good we were together, and I've been resisting, and I suspect that the reason I've been able to do that is because when she left me, I had to wall off a lot of those feelings. I just -- I couldn't afford them. But...I'm having a -- I'm having a hard time holding them off like I used to.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: I'm not -- I'm not going anywhere, okay? I'm not making any big declarations. I just... damn it, I just don't want to -- I don't want to keep anything from you.",
        "Ivy: Uh, I know, I know. I know, and I love you and I respect you for that. I mean, I can't say I'm surprised. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: That's -- whatever. Whatever. Say it. Whatever you need to say, just -- you can say it.",
        "Ivy: Liam, I'm -- I'm getting deported.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I'm not sure what this is supposed to be.",
        "Quinn: Well, it's a star ruby.",
        "Steffy: But shouldn't it be, like, an old ruby ruby? Like, a plain ruby?",
        "Quinn: Well, this is a star ruby. See?",
        "Steffy: Oh, okay. Wyatt gave it to me.",
        "Steffy: Seriously? Your son buys you jewelry?",
        "Quinn: Oh, yeah, yeah. He's very, very generous. Actually, he's dabbled in making jewelry, and he actually made this for me.",
        "Wyatt: I didn't make that. What kind of stories is she telling you?",
        "Quinn: Oh, you didn't make this for me. I-I must have been mistaken.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, Mom. Aren't you, uh, leaving?",
        "Quinn: I-I will if you want me to.",
        "Steffy: I thought we have a meeting.",
        "Wyatt: What the hell, Mom can stay. I declared my intentions to explore an interest in you.",
        "Steffy: Huh. You had a man-to-man with my father?",
        "Wyatt: With Liam.",
        "Quinn: Good for you, Wyatt.",
        "Steffy: That was out of line. You don't talk to other people about me, what I want, who I want. You talk to me.",
        "Quinn: Well, I'm sure that Liam took that as a courtesy, you know? I mean, he's so committed to Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: I didn't do this for you. I did this for me. We don't even know what this is. We don't even know if we have a \"this\" between us. But my brother does complain about me being wily and underhanded and undermining him behind his back. And this time, he can't say that.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] What did Liam say, out of curiosity?",
        "Wyatt: He didn't say one way or the other whether it was more than just nostalgia between you two.",
        "Quinn: I really think there could be wedding bells in their future. Ivy and Liam's, you know. I mean, in the very near future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: How is that even possible? Your dad's American.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but my passport is not.",
        "Liam: What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Ivy: Because I thought I was a dual citizen, Liam.",
        "Liam: Okay, well, then wouldn't you have two passports?",
        "Ivy: All I know is that I have a handful of documents that he handed me that make my brain freeze when I stare at them.",
        "Liam: Who? Who, Ivy?",
        "Ivy: The -- the immigration officer who came and found me in my office.",
        "Liam: Why is anybody coming to find you?",
        "Ivy: I don't know.",
        "Liam: You didn't ask?",
        "Ivy: No, I was kind of in a little bit of shock.",
        "Liam: Okay. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Look, the only thing I can think of is that my -- is that my work visa expired.",
        "Liam: Wait a second. You have a work visa?",
        "Ivy: Well, yeah. I-I had to apply for one before I came to L.A.",
        "Liam: Ivy, if you thought you were a U.S. citizen, why would you get a visa?",
        "Ivy: Because my company in Australia is not a citizen, so I spoke to the consulate, and they said I should apply. So I applied.",
        "Liam: Okay, but you -- you have to understand. It -- here you are thinking you're a U.S. citizen but acting like somebody who's not.",
        "Ivy: Liam, you know me. I follow the rules. I went and spoke to somebody about what I should do, and I believed them. So then I acted accordingly.",
        "Liam: O-okay. Well, your -- your father must have some -- some connection, right?",
        "Ivy: Really? Have you met the guy? He's not really into authority figures, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be in this mess right now if it wasn't for him.",
        "Liam: Fine. Eric, then. You're a Forrester, for God's sake. You have resources.",
        "Ivy: I can't marshal up these papers quick enough. Basically, I have to be in Australia within a week and reapply for a visa that I may not even get.",
        "Liam: What?!",
        "Ivy: Because right now, I'm breaking the law, Liam. I'm -- I'm -- I'm breaking immigration law.",
        "Liam: Well, li-listen. We're gonna find you a lawyer.",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "Liam: Okay?",
        "Ivy: I've spoken to Carter, and he said I have to do exactly what this agent says.",
        "Liam: Well, God! They -- what are they -- what, they just get to -- to come and strip you of your home and your livelihood overnight without just cause? There's -- Ivy, there's got to be a way to undo this.",
        "Ivy: There might be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] I sent your mother out because --",
        "Wyatt: No one ever needs to explain why they threw my mother out.",
        "Steffy: I want you to hear this, really hear this. Never do that again -- bargaining with Liam for me like I'm a used car.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Steffy: I don't get all flushed and giddy when guys compete for me or show me attention. I haven't been like that since the seventh grade.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. As I said, it wasn't about you, but fine. I don't need to go through that exercise again. Liam was just being coy today. I know that he would never take you back.",
        "Steffy: Huh. And how do you know that?",
        "Wyatt: For one reason he told you and one I imagine he didn't.",
        "Steffy: Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: That's the one he told you. Individually, they might be a bore to someone else, but... together, they're inseparable.",
        "Steffy: What's the other one I don't know?",
        "Wyatt: The way you hurt him.",
        "Steffy: Did Liam say that?",
        "Wyatt: No. I just know. Because what you did to him, Hope did to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Thank you for getting here so quickly.",
        "Carter: Just tell me you didn't stab somebody.",
        "Quinn: No! Of course not.",
        "Carter: So, what? Simple assault? You said it was an emergency.",
        "Quinn: Right. No, it's not my emergency. Poor Ivy.",
        "Carter: Wait, what did you do to Ivy?",
        "Quinn: No! I didn't do anything to Ivy. Her getting deported -- it's -- it's preposterous.",
        "Carter: Oh, yeah. You can't mess with these people. What they say to do, you've got to do. Once she goes back, I'll find --",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no! She can't go back. It'll ruin her life, and I-I need Ivy here.",
        "Carter: I never thought you liked her that much.",
        "Quinn: Well, we're co-workers. You know, we -- we respect each other's talents. [Sighs] Look, Ivy is with Liam right now, and it's just -- come on. It's so sad. They belong together.",
        "Carter: Legally, there's one option.",
        "Quinn: Yes! Marriage. And if that's what they decide, and I think that they might, could you marry them today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: What do they say you need to do?",
        "Ivy: Some procedure that needs to be followed before I can establish dual citizenship, and there are pages and pages on it.",
        "Liam: Okay. Then that's what we do. We just tackle that one page at a time.",
        "Ivy: Liam, I-I can't do that from here.",
        "Liam: Okay, fine. Then, you know, you go back and you reapply.",
        "Ivy: I reapply for a visa that I may not get. That's what the agent said.",
        "Liam: What? Okay, well, all right. Well, what did -- what did you mean when you said there might be a solution?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] I mean, can you blame me for not wanting to lose everything? My work here has gotten worldwide recognition. I became a semi-famous face in Amsterdam. My friends are here, my family's here, the man of my dreams.",
        "Liam: Ivy, listen. If you're saying that you want a-a team of lawyers, I don't know. Maybe we can get a judge to order a stay.",
        "Ivy: Look, you know that I'm not a risk taker. I play by the rules. But right now, I feel like playing by the rules is a real gamble.",
        "Liam: Okay, so what do you have in mind?",
        "Ivy: Look, I know it's not the way either of us would want to do this. I mean, we're probably 12 months away from making any big future decisions together, even without the reappearance of Steffy.",
        "Liam: I-I don't think we should include her in this conversation.",
        "Ivy: Really? Do you think that's realistic? What if one day we do break up and she's the reason? I mean, it could be a dozen other reasons. But don't you think it should be our decision if we're together or not, not because I'm being forced to leave the country? We should be able to choose our future. And we can do that... if we get married now."
