    "Recap": [
        "Katie cannot believe she is standing here trying to defend herself to Eric. He says he understands but they need to get to the bottom of this. Sally says again for the hundredth time that Steffy has every right to be skeptical and she is sorry that she stole from Forrester and that will not happen again. Thomas is irked that Steffy said Sally is taking advantage and is using him for his money to bail out Spectra. Katie says Quinn has done terrible things to so many people but she swears that she did not do this. But someone did and that person is still out there and the police should be looking for them. Quinn talks only a few minutes with Sheila and says she needs to get home. Sheila says they need to talk and get to know each other better or not. Eric tells Lt. Baker that he is convinced that Katie had nothing to do with this shooting and surely her questioning is over. Lt. Baker tells Eric and Katie that it is probably a good idea to hire additional security as that guilty person is still out there and could try again.",
        "Steffy tries to make amends and says she just does not want Thomas's heart broke again. He says he is carving out a new life for himself, not only with Spectra instead of Forrester but with this woman right here. Sheila looks through the telescope aiming at the spot where Quinn had been standing. Meanwhile Eric comes home and tells Quinn that he will not let anything happen to her. He relays that the forensics came back and there was no residue on Katie so she was not the shooter. Quinn fills Eric in that she used the binoculars and then went next door to Katie's and met a woman who said she was a friend of the Logan's. She says she just now remembers that he was married to a woman named Sheila yet she knows nothing about her and there are no pictures. Eric says for a reason; Sheila was very bad news. Katie returns home and is beyond shocked to find Sheila there. She wants to know why Sheila is there. Sheila replies in a matter of fact manner that she has a beautiful home, a great looking son by Bill Spencer .Katie interrupts and asks what is she doing there and what does she want? Liam tells Steffy that he is so proud of her. He knows how worried she is about her brother but she handled Sally well and on point. He thinks Sally wants to be better and what better way than have Thomas as her influence. She hopes he is right but she is a Spectra and they rarely change their spots. Thomas tells Sally he has something to show her and he wants her to keep an open mind. On a design pad he shows her the new improved Spectra logo .slightly quirky but always in good taste. This time next year they will be on everyone's minds. Quinn asks if Sheila is trouble like Quinn. Eric says no, she is good trouble, but Sheila Carter is bad trouble. They did have some good times and he did fall in love and asked her to marry him. But she is dangerous and he is not sure she is even alive anymore, but she is bad, very bad. Sheila tells Katie that she has done her time and all is well. Katie accuses her of being there and looking through the telescope which Sheila knows is looking right onto the Forrester balcony at Katie's. She accuses her of coming back to finish off her aim. She grabs the fireplace poker and holds Sheila off from coming any closer. Sheila tells her emphatically to put that down."

        "Katie: I just can't believe that I'm having to defend myself to you. You -- you've known me my whole life. I'm not -- I'm not violent, no matter how frustrated or upset I get.",
        "Lt. Baker: Everybody's got a breaking point. Maybe this was yours.",
        "Katie: So, I guess you think I'm guilty, too, then?",
        "Lt. Baker: We'll have the GSR report back soon.",
        "Katie: I didn't shoot at Quinn, but I guess if you're determined to point the finger at me, maybe I should call my lawyer.",
        "Eric: Katie, Quinn is frightened, and I'm frightened for her. Now, we have to get to the bottom of this.",
        "Katie: I agree. I want that as much as anyone. I-I want the person who shot at -- at Quinn to be found and prosecuted and locked up, but that person is not me. Someone else pulled the trigger. The question is, \"who?\"",
        "Quinn: You said your name is Sheila?",
        "Sheila: Yes.",
        "Quinn: Are you here to babysit will?",
        "Sheila: Will?",
        "Quinn: Katie's little boy. I assume you're waiting here for him to come back from --",
        "Sheila: Oh. Oh, no. No, no, no. I-I'm not the sitter. I was a nanny once, but that -- that was a long time ago.",
        "Quinn: Look, uh... Sheila...",
        "Sheila: I-I know. I know. You're wondering, \"why is there a stranger in Katie's house when she's not home?\" But, you see, I'm not really a stranger. I'm an old family friend of the Logans.",
        "Quinn: I see.",
        "Sheila: I'd ask who you are, but I-I already know. You're Quinn Fuller... the woman lucky enough to be married to Eric Forrester.",
        "Sally: And I'm embarrassing myself, going on like that.",
        "Thomas: No, no. I like it. It was -- it was great 'cause it was mostly about me and very true.",
        "Sally: Steffy, I understand why you're skeptical. I stole from your family and from you. I cost Forrester creations a boatload of money. If there was an award for the biggest screw-up, I would din. But that was the old sally. The new sally is all about learning from her mistakes and never making them again.",
        "Steffy: Nice speech... if it's true.",
        "Thomas: Steff.",
        "Steffy: I --",
        "Sally: It wasn't a speech. Like I said, I've made mistakes. But I am bound and determined not to make another one with your brother. He means too much to me.",
        "Steffy: To you and to spectra fashions.",
        "Liam: You know, we could discuss something safer, like... politics.",
        "Thomas: Nice try. But, Steffy, you can't make an accusation like that and expect me not to respond.",
        "Steffy: It's not an accusation. I just feel that --",
        "Thomas: You're saying sally's using me. That's an accusation. Steff, you're wrong. I decided to invest in spectra fashions on my own. I decided to design for spectra on my own. I'm excited about that. I'm having better ideas than I've ever had because of this, because of this woman right here.",
        "Sally: It's true. Thomas plans to take spectra to places that I never dreamed we could go.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] My point exactly. You need Thomas' talent and money to keep spectra afloat. Does this mean this is the only reason you're into him? Jury's still out.",
        "Liam: Okay. Well, this is good. This is healthy. We're all...airing our concerns. How 'bout that check, huh?",
        "Thomas: I think before we get the check, we should order some tiramisu, right, Steff?",
        "Eric: Katie, I don't want to believe that you have anything to do with this. I don't. But these circumstances -- you were fired. You took it badly. I blame myself for that. I should have spoken to you personally. But for you to pull a gun on Quinn?!",
        "Katie: Look, that was stupid. That was -- that was so stupid, I know, but I just -- she has done terrible things to so many people that I care about, and -- and do I regret taking it that far? Yes! My god, I regret it. I should never have done that. But -- but for anyone to believe that I could kill someone -- I mean, that's just -- that's insane! I swear to god, I didn't do this! But someone did, and that means that there is a very dangerous person out there, and -- and the police are wasting time questioning me. They need to find out who really did this.",
        "Quinn: How do you know my husband?",
        "Sheila: Oh. Who doesn't know Eric Forrester? I mean, his reputation is legendary.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Sheila: Sh-should I tell Katie that you stopped by?",
        "Quinn: Oh. You tell her whatever you want. I couldn't care less.",
        "Sheila: The two of you don't get along?",
        "Quinn: Uh, it's -- it's a long story, and, uh... I'd better get going.",
        "Sheila: Well, perhaps I'll get another shot.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Sheila: To get to know you better. Or not.",
        "Eric: Katie's right, lieutenant. Continuing to question her is a total waste of time. I understand there's circumstantial evidence and your investigation has to be carried through to the end.",
        "[Buzzer sounds]",
        "Eric: But I'm convinced she had nothing to do with this.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Lt. Baker: Ah. Is that the, uh... Just got them back, lieutenant. The GSR test came back negative.",
        "Katie: Of course it did. I mean, I-I-I would never have a gun in the house, much less fire one. They're gonna find out who did this, okay?",
        "Lt. Baker: Absolutely. We'll do everything we can to find the shooter. But until we do, I would recommend that you hire some additional security. This shooter, whoever he or she may be -- they could be long gone, but... they also could just be close by... waiting to try it again.",
        "Thomas: Well, what do you know? We made it through a meal -- no food fights, no ugly scenes, and I think we're making progress.",
        "Liam: This is good. This is good. I mean, maybe we can try it again, next time at our place, and do a little grilling out in the back, right?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Like you said, Thomas... we made it through a meal. But my guard is still up. And it's -- it's not for me. It's for you. She's your girlfriend and your business partner. I just don't want to see your heart broken again.",
        "Sally: I'm not gonna do that.",
        "Steffy: You say that now, sally, but I don't --",
        "Liam: I-I think Steffy's just fiercely protective of her family.",
        "Thomas: No, I get it. Steff, I appreciate that about you. And I appreciate that both of you joined us for lunch. And, yes, it is going to be weird going to spectra instead of Forrester when I go back, but I am carving out a new life for myself. Not only did I make an investment in spectra, but I made an investment in this woman right here.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: Quinn?",
        "Quinn: I'm here.",
        "Eric: Quinn, where are ridge and Wyatt? I told them not to leave you alone.",
        "Quinn: I'm fine. I'm fine now that you're here. Tell me what happened at the police station. Did lieutenant baker question Katie?",
        "Eric: Yes, yes, and the forensic people did a test on her clothing, looking for gunshot residue. It came back negative. She did not fire a gun.",
        "Quinn: So, they cleared her?",
        "Eric: Yes. Now, you know what that means.",
        "Quinn: It means that there's still somebody out there who wants me dead.",
        "Eric: Quinn, nothing's gonna happen to you. I'm not gonna let anything happen. I promise you that.",
        "Quinn: I need to tell you something. I, uh... I used...these to look into Katie's house, and, um, well, I saw somebody inside, and I thought it was Katie avoiding the police or something, but... I went up there.",
        "Eric: Oh, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: And it wasn't. It wasn't her. It -- it was -- it was a woman. She said she was a friend of the Logans.",
        "Sheila: Hello, Katie.",
        "Katie: [Gasps] [Gasps] Oh, my god.",
        "Steffy: What was that for?",
        "Liam: I'm just really proud of you. I mean, I know -- I know how worried you are about your brother, but the way you handled lunch with Thomas and sally -- that was, like, on point.",
        "Steffy: Well, I put my game face on, and I got through it.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you did.",
        "Steffy: My feelings for sally -- they haven't changed... even though yours might.",
        "Liam: No, I just -- I just believe that she wants to be better, and I think Thomas is largely responsible for that. The way that he loves her, the way he believes in her -- how could that not have a positive effect on sally?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Seriously? You feel it went well?",
        "Thomas: Yes, I do. I think it's impressive the way you handled yourself, and I really appreciate the things that you said to Steffy.",
        "Sheila: Well, I meant it, you know... everything I said, especially about you -- how important you've become in my life. It's not just words, Thomas. I really do love you.",
        "Thomas: I really do, too.",
        "Eric: There you are... after the day you've had today.",
        "Quinn: I really thought it was Katie. I know you had your doubts.",
        "Eric: I did. I couldn't imagine her pulling a gun on you, in spite of what she's done recently. [Sighs] Well, I hope she's okay.",
        "Quinn: Hmm.",
        "Eric: Maybe I should call and check on her.",
        "Quinn: Oh, no. Her friend Sheila is with her. It's not like Katie's alone.",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Quinn: You were married to a woman named Sheila, weren't you?",
        "Eric: Yeah -- Sheila Carter.",
        "Quinn: It just occurred to me that you never talk about her -- no pictures of her, no trace that she even existed.",
        "Eric: There's a good reason for that. Sheila Carter was trouble.",
        "Sheila: I didn't mean to startle you.",
        "Katie: What are you doing in my house?",
        "Sheila: It's beautiful. Did you decorate it yourself?",
        "Katie: What are you doing here, Sheila?!",
        "Sheila: In L.A., you mean?",
        "Katie: We all thought...",
        "Sheila: That I was dead? But you know what? I'm not. Clearly, I'm not. There are all these crazy stories out there about my whereabouts and my identity. They're just crazy stories. I'm -- I'm here. I'm here in the flesh.",
        "Katie: Okay. That still doesn't explain what you're doing in my home.",
        "Sheila: I see you have a son. Will, is it?",
        "Katie: What do you know about my son?",
        "Sheila: I-I know that he's a lucky boy. He's got a beautiful mom, and Bill Spencer is his father.",
        "Katie: Oh, okay. Okay. Enough. Enough. What the hell do you want from me, Sheila?",
        "Steffy: Believe it or not, I hope you're right... that sally changed because of my brother.",
        "Liam: But...?",
        "Steffy: But... she's a spectra, and Spectras never change their spots.",
        "Liam: Please. You're a romantic at heart. You know what loving someone can do.",
        "Steffy: I know what loving you has done for me. I have never been this happy in my life.",
        "Liam: Well, apparently, neither has Thomas. That's got to be a good thing, right?",
        "Thomas: I have something to show you.",
        "Sally: Well, lock the door first. You never know when Darlita might --",
        "Thomas: No, not that. Uh...this.",
        "Sally: What is that?",
        "Thomas: Just promise you'll keep an open mind.",
        "Sally: Why?",
        "Thomas: Promise.",
        "Sally: Okay. I cross my heart. Now show me. [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: It is the new, improved spectra logo.",
        "Sally: You designed this?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Well, it's part of my vision for spectra. We're innovating. We're giving a whole new, slightly edgy, slightly quirky take on fashion, but always in good taste. Sally... by this time next year, we will be the comeback story of all comeback stories, and best of all... we will have done it together, you and me, side by side... laughing...loving. What do you say? Are you with me?",
        "Sally: Am I with you?",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: [Chuckles] I am so with you, bucko...",
        "Thomas: Good.",
        "Sally: ...In every way. [Laughs]",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Sally: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: Trouble, huh? Like me?",
        "Eric: No, no, not like you. You're good trouble. Sheila was dangerous.",
        "Quinn: Well, still, you must have loved her if you married her.",
        "Eric: I didn't know the real Sheila Carter. She was pretending to be somebody she wasn't.",
        "Quinn: What about the family? Did they support the marriage?",
        "Eric: [Laughing] No. No, they didn't -- not at all, ridge least of all, and, as it turns out, for very good reason.",
        "Quinn: Well, there must have been some good times.",
        "Eric: Sure, sure, at first.",
        "Eric: Be with you in a moment, ms. Carter. Come in. Sit down.",
        "Sheila: Are you asking me --",
        "Eric: I'm asking you to be my wife, Sheila. I'm asking you to marry me.",
        "Sheila: Yes, I'll be [Laughing] Your wife. I'll be your wife and your companion and your helpmate. I'm going to be everything you have ever wanted or needed in a woman, Eric. Oh, you want to know what goes on inside of me? Is that what you want? You want to know what goes on inside? Fear. That's what goes on inside of me, Eric -- fear of the world and fear of every person in it... but most of all, the fear of losing you.",
        "Eric: Like I said... she was dangerous. I'm not even sure if she's alive anymore. But Sheila Carter was bad -- very bad.",
        "Sheila: You seem frightened. Yeah, I just -- I shouldn't have come here like this.",
        "Katie: No. No, you shouldn't have, not after everything you've done to people I love.",
        "Sheila: Wait a minute. Where do you think I've been? I did my time. Katie, you know what? Your -- your telescope... it's pointing at Eric's house.",
        "Katie: Shots were fired at the Forrester estate earlier. Someone tried to kill Quinn.",
        "Sheila: His new wife.",
        "Katie: They said they came from this direction, and now here you are in my house.",
        "Sheila: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Katie: You did it, didn't you?! That's why you're here! You're back to finish what you started!",
        "Sheila: No! Katie, just listen to me. Look, I'm not here to hurt you!",
        "Katie: You stay away!",
        "Sheila: Put it down!",
        "Katie: Don't come any closer!",
        "Sheila: I said... \"put...it...down.\""
