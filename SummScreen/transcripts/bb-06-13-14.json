She pushes him away and says she is not talking to him. She is talking to Hope. She is making Wyatt pay for something he hasn't done. She says they don't have to worry about her.

He says it is as bad as it can get and he sees nothing positive in it. She says no one is giving up on Ridge yet so he could still be alive. Wyatt hopes that he is. He explains that he has spent most of his life trying to protect his mom from these impulses, but it's time he started thinking of himself. She's really not selfish, just reckless. She does whatever she wants when she wants it without seeing consequences. He says Hope changed him. He saw the value in honesty and for doing right for the right reasons. He did not grow up with that. Hope doesn't just see the best in people; she brings it out of them. But his mother is still his mother. But she knew about Ridge and Wyatt with Hope, but that didn't seem to matter. And now she wants to go to Hope and fix it. He tried to stop her but he doubts it could get any worse if she did. Wyatt tells Caroline that Hope still loves him but she does not see herself in a life with him ..at least not the one she wants. Life with his mom would be too much, for anyone, not just Hope. He says he is not defending her anymore and this has to stop. There is no getting Hope back with his mom in his life. But there is no going back or hanging his head down as if none of this ever happened. It's a long shot but there is only hope. Quinn leaves and Hope and Liam discuss how hurt she is. She's lost her job and now probably her son. But Wyatt is out of Hope's life and that is a good thing. She's the strongest person that he knows. Look how they have grown together. Quinn did say one good thing tonight. This crisis will end. She says she thinks she will go back to the office and just stay behind a closed door for a while. He promises her that there is nothing absolutely nothing that will interfere with their happiness now. Quinn goes to the Bikini Bar and plops down, asks for a whiskey and to leave the bottle. The bartender says he will give her a refill but nothing more than that. She argues that he surely doesn't think she wants to get drunk. Someone is watching all of this go down. He finally comes over and starts to sit beside the lady at the bar. She says she is no lady and he does not want to sit there. She says she can buy her own drinks, so maybe he can try his pickup lines down at the end of the bar. She quips that she's had a really bad day and he does not want to hear about it. But if he will go away she will tell him. She just got fired and she is about to lose her son too. He has been her whole life since he was born. He's not sick but he fell in love. He found the perfect woman and she has never seen him so in love until she screwed it up for him. The guy says well there are lots of other women out there. Quinn says not like this one. She even grew to love her. She had that affect on people. He might even know her if she mentioned the name ..Hope Logan. She realizes he does recognize the name. Deacon Sharpe says, \"Honey, I'm her daddy.\""], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Liam: It's okay.

I'm talking to hope.", "Liam: No, you're wasting your breath.", "Hope: Quinn, I've made my decision.", "Quinn: Yes, but you're making Wyatt pay for something he hasn't done.", "Liam: I'm sure you think you haven't done anything, either.", "Quinn: I am not the issue. That's why I'm here to tell you. You don't have to worry about me. I won't be a problem for you. You don't have to worry about me interfering in Wyatt's life anymore.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: Shouldn't your mom be helping you with this?", "Wyatt: She's helped me enough.", "Caroline: She told you about the meeting?", "Wyatt: No.", "Caroline: You're packing.", "Wyatt: Mm. Rick probably said the same things that hope told me. Look, I better get this done before security shows up to escort me out of the building. Unless you're here to give me a reprieve. Pep talk? Yeah, I can't see any positives in this, either. [Sighs]", "Caroline: You talk to hope about it? Really? That bad?", "Wyatt: As bad as it gets.", "Caroline: I'm sorry. 'Cause of Ridge? Nobody's given up yet. He could still be all right.", "Wyatt: I hope he is. For his family. But it's not gonna help mine. My mom made sure of that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Your brother fired us. Forrester creations and Quinn artisan jewelers are finished.", "Liam: So are hope and Wyatt.", "Quinn: You know how much that contract meant to us.", "Hope: I do.", "Quinn: Well, it's nothing compared to what you mean to my son. What he means to me, his happiness, what he has with you.", "Liam: Had!", "Quinn: I know you're scared to have me as a mother-in-law. I seem like a liability right now.", "Hope: Quinn, please. I understand that Wyatt is hurting right now, but --", "Quinn: Yes, because of me! Because of me. I'm the one you should be upset with.", "Liam: Oh, she is. We all are.", "Quinn: So is Wyatt. More upset than I have ever seen him. You should have seen the way he looked at me. The things he said, things a mother never wants to hear. I have ruined his life, and he wants me out of it. I'll back off, hope. But please, please don't turn your back on my son.", "Hope: I've made my choice, Quinn.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: [Sighs] All right, that's it.", "Caroline: Is this a pattern with your mom?", "Wyatt: One that I've had to put up with for a very long time.", "Wyatt: You know, I spent most of my life trying to protect her from these impulses. I guess it's time to start looking out for myself.", "Caroline: That's just how she operates, right?", "Wyatt: Yeah, that's how she operates, but she's not selfish. She's reckless. She doesn't see the consequences, you know? She did what she wants, whenever he wants it and how she's gonna get it.", "Caroline: Gee, I wonder what a woman like that would see in uncle Bill.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] She told me once that they're more alike than they wanted to admit.", "Caroline: Yeah, but you're nothing like that.", "Wyatt: Hope changed me, Caroline. She showed me the value in honesty. The beauty in a thing done right for a right reasons. You know, those are -- those are lessons that I never really grew up with. Hope just -- she doesn't just see the best in people. She brings it out in them. She brought it out in me. My mother is still my mother. And hope's had enough of the both of us.", "Caroline: That doesn't seem fair.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I told her. I told her that this thing with dad would be dangerous.", "Caroline: You knew?", "Wyatt: About her feelings for dad? Yeah. I told her to be careful, that someone could get hurt. Like Ridge. And his family. And she knew what was at stake. Our work with Forrester, my relationship with hope. But it didn't matter. 'Cause there's no such thing as enough in her vocabulary. And then I told her about what happened with hope and she was like, \"no, don't worry, baby. I'll fix it.\"", "Caroline: You told her no.", "Wyatt: I doubt she listened.", "Caroline: You don't seem that concerned.", "Wyatt: I would be, but, honestly... I can't possibly see how this could get any worse.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You know you don't have to listen to this, right?", "Hope: Do we think she's telling the truth?", "Quinn: You know I am!", "Liam: Oh, yeah. That's you. Beacon of honesty.", "Quinn: All right, so, what about you, hope? Are you being truly honest with yourself? You say you're not punishing Wyatt for being my son, but think about it. Would you be here right now if Ridge had come home with your mother?", "Hope: But he didn't. He didn't come home, and he might never come home. My entire family is devastated. We're all dreading the day that we might have to tell R.J. That his father is gone, and you have the audacity to walk in here and try to get me to fix your relationship with Wyatt?", "Quinn: No!", "Hope: That's what it sounds like you're doing.", "Quinn: Okay, well, then, don't listen to me. Listen to the voice inside of your head, the one that is telling you that this is wrong. It's a reaction. Your family is in crisis and Liam is a security blanket. He seems all warm and comforting now, but this crisis is gonna pass.", "Hope: And I'm gonna get through it with Liam's support.", "Quinn: Yes, but Wyatt supports you. Your work, your goals -- that's what made you two such a great team. He sparked something inside of you.", "Hope: And I am always gonna be grateful to Wyatt for the things that he's done for the collection and for me. I only wish good things for him, but my future is with Liam. I'm sure that stability and security sound very boring to you, but they're essential to me. Some day Liam and I are gonna get married, and we're gonna have kids, and when that day comes... Wyatt will be a part of the family. He's gonna be an uncle to our kids. He's always gonna have a place with us, but, you know, as far as our relationship goes, it's over. I'm back to being the woman that I really am. I'm focused on my family, in charge of my life. And I'm in love with Liam.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: You know, it might not hurt for your mom to apologize, admit her part in all this.", "Wyatt: It's too late.", "Caroline: Oh, at Forrester? Absolutely. But... hope is different. You two are in love.", "Wyatt: She still loves me, Caroline. She just doesn't see herself making a life with me anymore, not one that she wants, anyway. And I don't blame her. Life with my mom? The things she does? [Scoffs] It's too much. For anyone, not just for hope.", "Caroline: She's done too much damage.", "Wyatt: Yeah. And it's got to stop. I'm not defending her anymore. That's only made things worse. There is no getting hope back with mom in my life.", "Caroline: You haven't given up?", "Wyatt: It's a long shot. I know. What's the alternative? Walk out of here with my head down, defeated? Go back to the way my life was? Forget everything that happened here? No. There is no going back. There's only hope.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Wow! Talk about delusional.", "Hope: Yeah. Quinn was pretty upset.", "Liam: Yeah, well, Wyatt blames her for your decision. I think neither one of them is taking much responsibility.", "Hope: He really doesn't want her to be a part of his life.", "Liam: Yeah, he's not the only one.", "Hope: You know, this really didn't surprise me.", "Liam: What, that Quinn wants you to feel sorry for Wyatt?", "Hope: Yeah. But, I mean, I've never seen her like that.", "Liam: Well, I mean, we've never seen her in this much trouble, you know? She lost her job, she lost her family's respect, she might be losing her son.", "Hope: [Sighs] I mean, I knew that Wyatt was upset with her, but... to cut her out of his life, that's --", "Liam: I don't know, hope. I mean, that could be the best thing that ever happened to him. I know cutting her out of our lives is gonna be good for us.", "Hope: I'm not questioning my decision. I want you to know that.", "Liam: Well, I'm sure after that you're -- [Laughs] You're relieved.", "Hope: I -- I feel bad. I really hurt him.", "Liam: You had a choice to make. It couldn't have been easy after everything that happened. Quinn, Ridge. And Wyatt, you know, he knew. He knew what was coming. That's why he summoned you up to big bear, and you went because you wanted to end things with him in person because you treat people the way you want to be treated -- with compassion and respect, and I love that about you. Although there are some people who think that's, I don't know, weakness? Something to exploit? I mean, that's what Quinn was trying to do. She was playing on your sympathy and your concerns. You're not weak. You're the strongest person I know.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Tropical music plays]", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "Bartender: Hi. Can I get you something to drink?", "Quinn: Whiskey. Best you've got.", "Bartender: Absolutely.", "Quinn: May be the last time I can afford it. Thanks.", "Bartender: There you go.", "Quinn: You may want to leave the bottle.", "Bartender: Oh, uh, sorry. I'd love to get you a refill, but any more than that, I'm gonna have to call a taxi.", "Quinn: Do I look like somebody who wants to get drunk?", "Bartender: You just seem a little upset at the moment.", "Quinn: Do you have kids?", "Bartender: No.", "Quinn: Then you wouldn't understand. [Sighs]", "Bartender: You all right, lady?", "Quinn: I'm no lady, and you don't want to sit there.", "Bartender: I'll take my chances.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Singer: She's locked in this love wishing she could get out I wanted her on the way up maybe catch her on the way, on the way, on the way down she's shining like a diamond even when things get dark light a spark, cut the lock, and get out she shines like a diamond even when things get dark you're in her sights she found her mark it's two-time love", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: It's gonna be weird. No, Quinn, no Wyatt. My mom and Eric are in Abu Dhabi looking for Ridge.", "Liam: You know, you don't have to go in. You could stay here.", "Hope: I think we have to kind of pretend that it's business as usual. You know, we don't want anybody else knowing that Ridge is missing.", "Liam: Yeah. I could go with you. I mean, I could just pretend like I'm doing a new piece. \"Behind the scenes with Forrester's hot, new, young fashion guru\" or something.", "Hope: Thanks, honey. I think I'm just gonna hide out in an office with the door shut.", "Liam: Yeah, that works, too.", "[Both laugh]", "Liam: Hey, um... I would -- would like to be there with you, if you... hear anything.", "Hope: Mm.", "Liam: You know, there was something that Quinn said tonight that made sense. She said this crisis will end. And it will. I mean, hopefully with Ridge safe at home, giving Rick a hard time, playing soccer with R.J.", "Hope: [Chuckles]", "Liam: In the meantime, you know you can lean on me, right?", "Hope: Of course.", "Liam: Times are tough, yeah, but we've been through -- [Laughs] We've been through our share of tough times.", "Hope: Yeah. [Laughs] But if Quinn can't accept what's happened, I think she could make them even tougher. On everyone.", "Liam: I know, but we don't have to let that affect us.", "Hope: Quinn can be pretty determined.", "Liam: Yeah, so can we. I mean, think about everything we've been through, you know? All the obstacles we've overcome. Quinn tried to do everything she could to keep us apart. So did Wyatt. But... here we are. And look how much stronger we are, and look at all the lessons we learned, you know? About ourselves, about each other. I promise you nothing -- nothing -- is going to interfere with our happiness now. Okay?", "Hope: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: No. No. I can buy my own drinks. Thank you.", "Deacon: Suit yourself.", "Quinn: [Sighs] Look, you know, I'm not really in the mood for company, so why don't you try your pick-up lines down at the other end of the bar, okay? I had a really bad day and you don't want to hear about it.", "Deacon: Try me.", "Quinn: Will it make you go away? Fine. Want to hear my sad tale? Well... my life is falling apart. I got fired. I'm about to lose my son. He has been my whole life since the day he was born.", "Deacon: Is he sick?", "Quinn: No. [Chuckles] He fell in love.", "Deacon: [Laughs]", "Quinn: Found the perfect woman. I've never seen him so happy until I screwed it up.", "Deacon: Yeah, well, there's a lot of women out there.", "Quinn: Mm. No. No, not like her. No. She's different. She -- she brought something special out in my son. Made him think about the future, you know? He wanted to make something out of himself for her. She has that effect on people. Even I really grew to love her. It's an amazing girl. What? You don't believe me? You would if I told you her name. You'd recognize it. [Chuckles] Hope Logan. Ah. You know who she is?", "Deacon: Know her? Honey, I'm her daddy."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1WhC8bQ5Jc"}
