        "Ivy tells Liam that she thought all her papers were in check so all of this deportation is hitting her very hard. Her whole life is here. Liam tells her deportation is not an option. She says the only way is for him to marry her. Quinn begs Carter to try and get some help and go over and marry Liam and Ivy tonight. She does not want to go back to Australia. Quinn says she thinks she is offended when Carter says he is not buying her concern for her partner. He thinks there is more to it than that and wonders what she is up to. She says maybe she is being a little selfish. She has a second chance here and she and Ivy have been making beautiful pieces but she has to convince Ridge who is not her biggest fan. She laments that she has changed since pushing Ivy in the Seine and Carter can be a helper if he will. She pushes him out the door and tells him to go marry the couple. Wyatt tells Steffy that Liam is committed to Ivy so Steffy should accept that and move on. She wonders if he means with him. Wyatt tells her that she deserves better than to work for Liam's attention and she would not have to do that with him. She says she will never give up on Liam.",
        "Ivy tells Liam that she will lose her job and him if she goes back to Australia so she can not do that. But if he will marry her it will give her time to get her citizenship. She begs him to help her. Ridge comes home and Caroline shows him her charts with pins and plates holding her legs together. Steffy stops by her dad's and tells Caroline that she is sorry she made assumptions about them as a couple and she is still a work in progress but she is trying. Wyatt walks into his mom's office while she is humming Here Comes The Bride. He wants to know what she is plotting now. She lets him know that Ivy and Liam may be getting married tonight as they speak. Ivy tells Liam that she does not even have to move in with him .just take some stuff so it looks like they are really married. She asks again if he can marry her. Quinn fills Wyatt in that Ivy might be deported but Liam can ride in and save the damsel in distress. Carter is on his way right now so Ivy just needs Liam to agree. Wyatt can not believe Quinn is so happy for Ivy and Liam. And he warns her sternly not to interfere with any relationship with Steffy. Liam tells Ivy that marriage is a leap but if they do this, it is legal but not a real marriage in that they are still dating and only together for a specific purpose. She agrees and can handle that. Carter comes over and says Quinn sent him over with this, a bridal gown in a garment bag, so are they gonna do this? Liam says it is only a piece of paper but an important one to keep her in the country and he does not want her to go. Ivy thanks him and goes to get dressed. Carter wants to make sure Liam wants to do this. He doesn't think he sounds so sure. Liam says Ivy is in trouble and he can help. Liam tells Ivy that she looks great. Liam says before they do this he needs to clear his conscious about Steffy. This is not a real good time. Ivy says she is good with that. She realizes this is just for Immigration purposes."

        "Ivy: I know that this is out of the blue. It is for me, too. The last thing I expected today was an immigration agent in my office threatening to deport me. I swear, I thought all of my paperwork was in check and that I did have dual citizenship.",
        "Liam: Yeah, of course, you did. That's -- that's what your father told you.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but none of the paperwork was filed correctly. [Sighs] Liam, I-I've built my life here. I don't want it to be ripped away.",
        "Liam: Listen, I get it. Deportation is not an option.",
        "Ivy: There is a way we can stop it. Please, Liam. Say you'll marry me.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Carter: Okay, back up. You want me to do what?",
        "Quinn: Help save Ivy from being deported.",
        "Carter: That's between two governments. She needs to go back to Australia and file the necessary documentation.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no, no. That can take months, maybe years, and I need Ivy here now!",
        "Carter: You do?",
        "Quinn: I mean, we're working so well together. We've got this really great creative flow going, you know? I don't want to interrupt that. Besides, Ivy doesn't want to go back to Australia. She wants to stay right here in the good, ol' U.S. Of A. So, go get your officiant's cap, go put that on, and get on over to Liam's and get those two married tonight!",
        "Steffy: Ivy, Ivy, Ivy. Whose idea was it to plant herself in los Angeles anyway?",
        "Wyatt: You wishing she'd never shown up?",
        "Steffy: It would be a lot less crowded.",
        "Wyatt: I've wanted to wish some people away, too. Liam sometimes. Doesn't seem to be going anywhere, though. He's here to stay.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: And Ivy -- so is she. But she's committed to Liam. And you should accept that and move on.",
        "Steffy: With you?",
        "Wyatt: Did I say that? I never said that. But now that you mention it...",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Ridge: She's working away.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] Sort of.",
        "Ridge: What are you doing? That's you, isn't it?",
        "Caroline: As soon as possible.",
        "Ridge: I like this one 'cause it looks like they're about to kiss or something.",
        "Caroline: Are they?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. You sure about this?",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to explain, so I would rather just show you, if you want to see.",
        "Ridge: I do, I think.",
        "Caroline: Okay, um, so, I have two broken and dislocated ankles, and then, um, my tibia and fibula on my left, uh, leg was also broken. So, um, these pins and, um, this plate just kind of holds it all together. You get sick of the doctors and the rehab and... you just want to feel like yourself again sometimes. It's just best to imagine it.",
        "Carter: No, I'm not buying it, this sudden concern for Ivy, her relationship with Liam. You couldn't care less about those people.",
        "Quinn: Wow. I think I'm offended.",
        "Carter: What are you up to, Quinn? What's your stake in this marriage?",
        "Quinn: I want to save Ivy from being deported, and that makes me a terrible person? Okay. All right, I-I also -- I don't want to lose my new partner.",
        "Carter: Hmm. The jewelry line.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Like I said, we have a really great flow going. I was out of work for a really long time. I don't really want to go back to that.",
        "Carter: Maybe. Partially. But there's more to it. What are you up to?",
        "Steffy: Seriously, you don't have to remind me every five minutes about Liam's commitment to Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. I sort of think I do. I'm just trying to keep you away from the dark side.",
        "Steffy: Hmm. And you think that's what Liam is?",
        "Wyatt: I think he's deeply committed to someone else. Just like he was with hope. And you deserve better than competing for his attention. You wouldn't have to do that with me.",
        "Steffy: I get that it's hard for you to understand our relationship.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: How all it takes is proximity to spark back up again.",
        "Wyatt: So you're hopeful.",
        "Steffy: I never give up on Liam and me.",
        "Wyatt: And where does that leave Ivy?",
        "Steffy: Back in Australia.",
        "Liam: Hmm.",
        "Ivy: Li-Liam, I can't go back to Australia. Not for that amount of time. If I do, I'm gonna lose everything. I'm gonna lose my career, my job... I'm gonna lose you.",
        "Liam: I mean, that's -- that's not necessarily what would happen. [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: If you marry me, you'd buy me the time I need to get my citizenship in order. You would literally be saving my life. Please. Please help me.",
        "Quinn: Maybe I'm being a little bit selfish. I mean, I feel like I have this -- this second lease on life. I married Deacon, I'm back here at Forrester. Everything is going so well.",
        "Carter: But?",
        "Quinn: But Rick is the one who hired me. He's the one who likes my designs. And our new C.E.O., Well... well, let's just say Ridge is not my biggest fan.",
        "Carter: Can you blame him?",
        "Quinn: Yes. But all he cares about is design, and Ivy and I have been making really, really beautiful pieces together. We -- we work so great. I mean, she looks up to me.",
        "Carter: And having a Forrester in your corner, that works in your favor.",
        "Quinn: Can you blame me for not wanting her to be deported? Besides that, Ivy's a really sweet girl.",
        "Carter: [Laughing] You didn't think so when you pushed her into the seine!",
        "Quinn: Well, people can change. And people can help. Do you want to be one of those people who can help?",
        "Carter: [Sighs] They're really getting married?",
        "Quinn: Well, that all depends on you. And oh, oh, oh! Bring this to Ivy. This is her wedding dress. Okay, go. Go. Get there. Marry them! Marry them! Thank you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Quinn: Oh, please work, please work, please work, please work, please work.",
        "Ridge: That's Steffy. I forgot to tell you she's coming by to drop off some paperwork.",
        "Caroline: Okay, um, thanks for the warning. In case you haven't noticed, Steffy's not the most gigantic fan of ours.",
        "Ridge: I don't care if she is or not, but we're not on the radar right now. She's thinking about Liam.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ridge: And speak of the devil.",
        "Steffy: Uh-oh.",
        "Ridge: Nothing bad. Hi.",
        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Caroline: Hey. Oh, what's this?",
        "Steffy: These are just, uh, peanut butter double chocolate cupcakes.",
        "Caroline: Wow! Thank you.",
        "Steffy: It's just my way of saying, um, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being harsh and judgmental, you know, making assumptions based on stereotypes. The fact is, you make my father happy. I mean, look at this big, dopey grin. How could I possibly have a problem with that, huh?",
        "Ridge: [Laughs] Here.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Caroline: That's really gracious of you.",
        "Steffy: I'm -- I'm not saying I'm gonna be perfect. I'm still getting used to the idea of you guys being a couple, so...",
        "Ridge: Well, you're making an effort, and we appreciate it.",
        "Caroline: Would you want to stay? I mean, Ridge just got Chinese.",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah. Chinese? Sure. Yes.",
        "Ridge: Cool.",
        "Steffy: I want some of those, too.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: [Humming \"here comes the bride\"]",
        "Wyatt: You're humming.",
        "Quinn: Hmm? Was I?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. Yeah. You only hum when you're plotting something.",
        "Quinn: Oh, well... hey, what's up with you? You look down.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I was just with Steffy.",
        "Quinn: Oh! Then you should be smiling.",
        "Wyatt: Except for the fact that she's still hung up on Liam.",
        "Quinn: Oh, well... that might not be the case moving forward.",
        "Wyatt: What did you do? Did you do something?",
        "Quinn: Why does everyone always think I'm working some agenda?",
        "Wyatt: Gee. Let me think.",
        "Quinn: Maybe it's just that I don't underestimate Liam's commitment to Ivy. And maybe, just maybe, he's reinforcing that commitment as we speak.",
        "[Hums \"Here Comes the Bride\"]",
        "Wyatt: Wait, that's what you were humming?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Ivy and Liam are getting married tonight. You just wait and see.",
        "Ivy: I'm mortified that I'm even having to ask you this. Look, I understand the pressure you must be feeling. But, Liam, I can't see another way. The immigration lawyer was so clear. He said I had to leave this country within the week voluntarily or I'm deported. There isn't time to do anything else.",
        "Liam: I know.",
        "Ivy: And I -- it's not real. I mean, I wouldn't even have to move in. I could just bring some of my stuff over so that it looks like I live here. You know, just -- just in case.",
        "Liam: Marriage. [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: On paper. You'd be saving my life. L.A. Is my life now. My job is here. My family is here. You are here. And I know that this is the biggest favor I could be asking from anyone. Please, can you grant it? Can you marry me?",
        "Ridge: You should see her with a walker. She took to it like she always used it.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] Yeah, it was amazing just to be upright again and mobile. [Chuckles] So, Steffy, what have you been up to since you've been back?",
        "Steffy: I had some of this.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Um, the takeover. And, well, I, uh, now that it's over, I'm actually talking to Wyatt.",
        "Caroline: Wyatt?",
        "Steffy: Not -- not talking. Like, he's doing most of the talking. I just listen.",
        "Caroline: Girl, what is it with you and all the Spencer guys?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. It's -- it's my curse. I don't -- [Sighs] I don't know. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: What about Liam?",
        "Caroline: You know, I hate to point this out, but I don't think that Ivy is going anywhere anytime soon.",
        "Steffy: Unfortunately. But hey, that's life. And Wyatt's a nice guy.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy's being deported?",
        "Quinn: Or maybe not.",
        "Wyatt: Right, if Liam marries Ivy, but --",
        "Quinn: Yeah, why shouldn't he? I mean, she's already he's girlfriend. And come on! This is so right up Liam's hero alley -- rushing in to save the damsel in distress.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I am gonna be so sorry saying this. I don't hate it.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] Yay! And Carter is on his way to Liam's right now all prepared to marry them. All Ivy has to do is get Liam to agree.",
        "Liam: I care so much about you, Ivy, but we're just dating. I mean, marriage -- that's... that's a leap.",
        "Ivy: Liam, marriage is the last thing on my mind, too.",
        "Liam: Well, you shouldn't be deported. Okay, if we do this... if we do this, we're legally married, but it's not a real marriage, not really. I mean, we're still two people who are dating and -- and we care about each other. We're just entering into an agreement, right? That's what it is. It's a limited partnership for a specific purpose.",
        "Ivy: Right. An agreement.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Still dating. Nothing more.",
        "Liam: Uh-huh.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, good, I can -- I can handle that.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ivy: Could that be immigration? Maybe don't get that.",
        "Liam: Don't worry. I'm not gonna let anything happen. I promise.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Carter: Either I'm the magical solution or you have no idea why I'm here.",
        "Liam: The latter.",
        "Carter: Mm-hmm. Quinn sent me to deliver this to you and to officiate a wedding. You two getting hitched?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Whether or not we're getting married is yet to be decided. Please, Liam. Can we just do it? I mean, Carter's here. Quinn's given me a dress.",
        "Liam: Wait a second. Quinn knows?",
        "Ivy: She only knows because she was at Forrester when the immigration officer was there. Look, I'm really sorry to be putting you on the spot like this, but... look, you're my only hope.",
        "Liam: It's just a piece of paper, but... it's a valuable one if it keeps you in the country. I think we need it.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] You have no idea how much this means to me.",
        "Liam: Well, I'm no hero. I have my own reasons. I-I don't want you to go.",
        "Ivy: Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh! Well, I'm gonna go get changed.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: So, that's a convenient solution to the immigration problem.",
        "Quinn: Uh, no, it's the only solution. Either Ivy marries Liam or she's back living with koala bears, and I don't think Liam's gonna let that happen.",
        "Wyatt: Wait. Why are you so pleased by all this?",
        "Quinn: Because I am so happy for Liam! Yeah, no, I couldn't even fake that, even for myself.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: No, I am so happy for you, because if Ivy and Liam get married, it clears the way for you and Steffy, and I happen to think that that woman is the perfect woman for you.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, mom.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Wyatt: You're not gonna do that again.",
        "Carter: You sure you want to do this?",
        "Liam: Hmm?",
        "Carter: Liam.",
        "Liam: What? Yeah. Yes.",
        "Carter: Don't sound sure.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Um... [Sighs] I care about Ivy. I-I think we're good together. I mean, did I plan on marrying her tonight? No, but she's in trouble. This is how I can help.",
        "Carter: Understood. But marriage is a big step.",
        "Liam: Yeah, believe me. I know. We've been discussing this, and both parties agree. You know, we go on as we have been. Uh, we're in a relationship. We're dating. We're just -- we're just not really... whoa.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: You look beautiful.",
        "Ivy: It's not too much, is it? You know, the ceremony and this dress?",
        "Carter: No, the ceremony's good. I mean, you already have one strike against you -- suspicious timing. Don't think immigration won't look into that, so whatever you can do to make this wedding look spontaneous but authentic works in your favor.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that's a good point. Hey, listen. Before we do this, I just want to make sure that...",
        "Ivy: Your feelings for Steffy. I know.",
        "Liam: It's the worst timing. I know that. But I can't -- I can't do this in good conscience unless I tell you that.",
        "Ivy: I respect your honesty. And you don't have to worry. I'm very clear, okay? This is just a wedding for immigration purposes, and it'll end as soon as my citizenship is safe.",
        "Liam: And you're good with that?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Absolutely.",
        "Carter: Shall we?",
        "Liam: Yeah, we're ready. Let's get married. [Chuckles]"
