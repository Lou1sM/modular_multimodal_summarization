        "Out on the balcony again Quinn looks toward Katie's and suddenly she is in the crosshairs again when shots, more than one, ring out in her direction. Sheila is at the police station and says she is not guilty in this .the evidence will speak for itself. Quinn crawls around on the floor trying to reach her phone. As she picks it up the door opens and it is Deacon. She is glad to see him and says someone is trying to kill her. He says that was not exactly the reception he was expecting. He can't imagine who would be trying to kill her. But she begs him to call the police and get down; there is still a shooter out there. He says he has never seen her so scared but he will take care of her. Ridge goes to the office and sees Brooke. He says he came back for some sketches. He fills her in on Sheila being on hand when Quinn was shot. Eric tells Sheila that he is not interested in her feeling good and making amends for what she has done to his family over the years. Just do not shoot at his wife now. Lt. Baker informs Sheila that her restraining order is still viable and she is under arrest. Sheila begs Eric to do something; she did not do this.",
        "While Quinn is still on the floor and wanting Deacon to be careful he pours himself a drink and says not to worry the sharpshooter is not after him. And he knows she does not care about him at all; she only wanted a Forrester to marry. He got pushed in the ocean for trying to help her before. She sold her soul for a shot at the good life. She says she can understand he is upset but right now her life is at stake and that is all she can worry about. He wonders who might want to see her dead ..well there is Hope and Liam and there are probably a lot more. And right at the top is him. He pulls a gun on her and says he faked that call to police. They are not coming. Sheila is booked and fingerprinted and mug shots taken. As they take her away she begs Eric again to stop this. She is a different person and has not bothered his family in years. Quinn tells Deacon to put the gun down. He could spend the rest of his life for this. He says he tried the true and narrow but it never worked. This time he is not going to miss. He wants better than he got. He continues to drink. Quinn says if he will just stop and sober up she will forget all about this and never mention it again. Katie is still looking through the telescope and sees something. She runs to the phone and calls Ridge and tells him to get to Quinn quickly; she has a gun pulled on her. Quickly Ridge slips in the door and knocks out Deacon. Quinn rushes into his arms."

        "Sheila: I didn't shoot at your wife.",
        "Eric: History would suggest otherwise.",
        "Sheila: I understand it's hard for you to believe me. I don't even expect you to. You don't have to listen to anything that I say because the evidence -- it's gonna speak for itself.",
        "Quinn: [Breathing heavily]",
        "[Bang] Aah! Deacon! [Breathing heavily] Thank God you're here! Oh!",
        "Deacon: That's not exactly the reception I was expecting, but I'll take it.",
        "Quinn: You got to help me.",
        "Deacon: Help you what -- off the floor? What are you doing crawling around down there?",
        "Quinn: Get down now! I'm serious! Somebody's trying to kill me!",
        "Brooke: Great. Thank you, sawyer.",
        "Sawyer: Absolutely. Thank you for signing.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Hi.",
        "Brooke: Oh. I thought you went home.",
        "Ridge: Uh, I forgot... my sketches. Um...there's something you should know.",
        "Brooke: Mm-hmm?",
        "Ridge: We found out who shot at Quinn.",
        "Brooke: Who?",
        "Ridge: You're not gonna believe this. Sheila carter.",
        "Eric: You just happened to be innocently walking by when Quinn was shot at? You expect anyone to believe that?",
        "[Buzzer sounds]",
        "Sheila: I told you... I'm here to make amends, Eric. You know, spending time in jail might have made things right with the state, but I've got a ways to go -- with you, all the people that I hurt.",
        "Eric: I'm not interested in helping you feel good about the things you've done to my family over the years, or anyone.",
        "Sheila: I don't even dream that anyone will ever forgive me for all of the horrible things that I've done. But if one person could... I'd want that to be you.",
        "Eric: Here's a friendly tip on how to ask someone's forgiveness. Don't shoot at his wife.",
        "Katie: Winners and losers -- that's the kind of world we live in, a world where people like me are alone and people like you go home to a beautiful man who loves her. You have no idea what it's like to lose. Maybe I should just do it and get rid of you once and for all.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Are you deaf?! Get down!",
        "Deacon: Someone's trying to kill you how?",
        "Quinn: They've been shooting at me -- second time -- out on the terrace. I need to call the police.",
        "Deacon: All right. All right. Hold on. I got it. I got it. You're in no shape to call. Turns out life on the hill is a little more dangerous than you thought, huh?",
        "Quinn: Are you seriously making a joke right now?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. We need the police over here at the Forrester estate. Someone's using it for target practice. It's, uh, something something willow hill roa--",
        "Quinn: 369!",
        "Deacon: 369 willow hill road. Yeah. Yeah, as soon as you can. Yeah, lady's pretty upset. Apparently, she don't like being shot at, if you know what I mean.",
        "Quinn: Are you drunk?",
        "Deacon: No. I don't get drunk -- not anymore. I mean, I may have a few drinks every now and then.",
        "Quinn: Oh, for heaven's sakes, you fool, just get down! There's a shooter out there! If you want to die, that's fine by me, but not in my living room.",
        "Deacon: I don't think I've ever seen you so scared.",
        "Quinn: I don't usually have bullets flying by my head, do I?",
        "Deacon: Don't you worry. I'm here now. I'll take care of you.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: It makes sense, doesn't it? Quinn is being shot at, and then...",
        "Brooke: And then we find out that Sheila's here. Yes, it makes sense. It explains everything.",
        "Ridge: Thankfully, she's in custody, so...we don't have to worry about her going after Quinn anymore.",
        "Sheila: I thought it might be this way, that you'd only focus on the bad times.",
        "Eric: What was good between us doesn't matter.",
        "Sheila: I was hoping for some kind of acknowledgement, Eric. It'd be so good to hear you admit that there was a part of you that did care for me once.",
        "Eric: I married you, Sheila.",
        "Sheila: You know why I've been working on myself so hard, on my rehabilitation? It's because in my darkest times, there's a small part of me that remembered the way you looked at me, how it felt to be your wife, the woman that I was before everything went so bad, violent. I paid my dues. I did. I sat in my cell, and I remembered every horrible thing I have ever said, the hideous things that I had done, and some of those, I'm the only one that knew what they were. I'm coming out of it. I'm coming out on the other side of it. I'm becoming the woman that deserved to be with you.",
        "Eric: I'm a happily married man, Sheila.",
        "Sheila: No, no, no, no. No. A woman that is capable of being loved by a man like you, Eric -- that's what I meant... because of my actions, my words, my kindness. And whether you're receptive to it or not is beside the point.",
        "Eric: What about the restraining order? Is it still in effect? I know it's been years, but is it still there?",
        "Lt. Baker: It was permanent. Showing up at Katie Logan's house was a big mistake, ms. Carter. Its proximity to the Forrester estate means that you were in violation of the restraining order.",
        "Sheila: Eric... I apologize. I didn't think that it would matter. I didn't even know it was still in effect.",
        "Lt. Baker: Well, it does matter. Sheila carter... you are under arrest.",
        "Quinn: Did the 911 operator say when?",
        "Deacon: Soon, I think.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: Shh, shh, shh.",
        "Quinn: What? What?",
        "Deacon: I -- no, I guess not.",
        "Quinn: What? No, no, no, no. You could have heard something. I mean... the shooter could be out there. They could be on the property. They could be in the house.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, they could be. What makes you so sure that the shooter's on the property, anyway?",
        "Quinn: Because the first shot sounded like it came from really far away, but the second one, it sounded -- it sounded closer. I mean, we just -- we have to be grateful that whoever it is a really bad shot.",
        "Deacon: I mean, it could be a sharpshooter. You know, I mean, wind conditions -- they can affect your aim. Tell you what -- let's have ourselves a drink, huh? Where's that husband of yours? He's always walking around, mixing martinis.",
        "Quinn: Be careful, deacon!",
        "Deacon: I'm not the one getting shot at, now, am I? Hey, you know who it might be?",
        "Quinn: Who?",
        "Deacon: Could be Mr. Martini himself -- Eric.",
        "Quinn: That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.",
        "Deacon: Oh, Quinn, come on. It's the husband. It's always the husband. Tell you what... let's have ourselves a little drink to the good old days.",
        "Quinn: With you?",
        "Deacon: Mmm. You never cared about me at all, did you? You never wanted me. You wanted a Forrester.",
        "Brooke: Keep me posted, okay? I want to know if she ends up getting released, so if she ends up on my doorstep, I'm gonna do something about it.",
        "Ridge: Well, don't worry about that. After what Sheila has done, she's not gonna get released anytime soon.",
        "Sheila: I'm under arrest?",
        "Lt. Baker: For violating the restraining order and for the attempted murder of Quinn Forrester.",
        "Sheila: Oh, no, but I didn't. Eric, you must believe me. I swear I never tried to kill your wife. I didn't even know I was violating a restraining order.",
        "Lt. Baker: You have the right to remain silent.",
        "Sheila: No. Eric.",
        "Lt. Baker: Anything you say can and will be used...",
        "Sheila: Eric, please say something. I didn't try to kill anyone. I swear.",
        "Lt. Baker: If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you.",
        "Sheila: Please say something.",
        "Lt. Baker: Do you understand these rights as I have explained them to you?",
        "Sheila: Eric.",
        "Lt. Baker: Sheila carter, do you understand your rights?",
        "Sheila: Yes. Yes, I do.",
        "Quinn: I don't know what stories you've been telling yourself, but I kicked you to the curb long before I got together with Eric.",
        "Deacon: See, that's 'cause you're smart. I give you credit for that. See, you were thinking ahead. You knew you could never con a Forrester into marrying you -- I mean, you know, not with me by your side.",
        "Quinn: That's just stupid.",
        "Deacon: You know what's stupid? Stupid was me trying to help you when you're playing make-believe with Liam. I tried to be your friend. What did I get for it? I got pushed into the ocean...",
        "Quinn: Why are you bringing that up right now?",
        "Deacon: ...Left for dead. You know why? 'Cause you don't give a damn -- not about anyone but yourself.",
        "Quinn: That's not true!",
        "Deacon: You know what? You're right. You're right. Actually, you do give a damn about Wyatt. There's nothing you wouldn't do for baby boy, as long as it got the two of you further ahead, right? You know, you leave me and sell your soul for a shot at the good life. My whole life, I've been treated like I was nothing, and I thought maybe, just maybe, you were different. But I was wrong. You just wanted me to disappear like all the others.",
        "Quinn: Look... I understand that you're upset, and I can see how I could be partly to blame for that, but, quite frankly, I'm having a really hard time finding any sympathy for you right now because my life is in danger, okay?",
        "Deacon: I don't even know if I believe your little story about a shooter, hmm?",
        "Quinn: Excuse me?",
        "Deacon: I mean, it is kind of hard to believe. Couple months ago, maybe not. It seemed like everybody in L.A. Hated you. But now -- now you got the Forresters accepting you. And why wouldn't they? You're a-a sweet lady and a wonderful mother.",
        "Quinn: You said yourself that you've never seen me look so scared.",
        "Deacon: I don't know. Maybe you're playing a game with everyone. You know, maybe you're just trying to get some sympathy. I mean, really, Quinn, who would want to see you dead, except for hope? She probably wants to see you dead. And then there's Liam. Now, Liam definitely wants to rid the planet of you. And bill, he -- he just plain hates your guts. So, when you think about it, actually, there are a lot of -- a lot of people. I mean, you've done a lot of awful things... to a lot of people... most of all to me... the man who trusted you... the man who loved you.",
        "Deacon: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!",
        "Deacon: So, I'd say I've got more reason than anyone to want to see you dead.",
        "Quinn: Can I see your phone?",
        "Deacon: Why?",
        "Quinn: I want to see how long it's been since you called the police for help. They should be here by now.",
        "Deacon: Oh, come on, Quinn. Please. We both know I faked that call.",
        "Katie: Quinn?",
        "[Camera shutter clicks] Turn to your right, please. [Camera shutter clicks] Face me.",
        "Sheila: Well, Eric, please. You can put a stop to this. Just have the restraining order lifted. I haven't done anything. I haven't come near you and your family in years!",
        "Lt. Baker: It was made permanent for a reason.",
        "Sheila: No, but I'm different now. I'm a different person. Can't you see that? I didn't shoot at your wife. Look at me. Look at my eyes. I didn't.",
        "Eric: Take her away.",
        "Sheila: No. No. No, Eric, please. Please! Please, I -- please, Eric! I didn't do anything! Please, Eric!",
        "Quinn: You -- you don't have to do this, deacon. You kill me, you spend the rest of your life in prison.",
        "Deacon: Oh, what a shame. Yeah, this wonderful life of mine -- I got so much going well for me, don't I? Yeah. I got this fantastic job, got money flowing in, surrounded by my adoring family. Gosh, I'd really hate to throw all that away.",
        "Quinn: Maybe they didn't turn out the way you imagined, but --",
        "Deacon: What? What, maybe I'm gonna fall for somebody? Get married? Live happily ever after? I don't think so. I tried that. Didn't work out so well. You know, I suppose maybe I ought to give you a last word -- you know, let you make peace with your maker. I think you should know something. This time I'm not gonna miss.",
        "Quinn: Think about hope. She needs her father.",
        "Deacon: I think about her a lot. I think about how she tried to convince me not to marry you. But, hey, I knew best!",
        "Quinn: No. Come on. You weren't wrong. We were -- we were good for each other, but sometimes people, they just -- they grow apart.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, they do, especially when one person wants something better than what they got. You're not gonna drink that? I will.",
        "Quinn: Come on, deacon. You don't -- you don't need another drink. You just -- you need to sober up. You need to get help and get back on the program. If you do that, then we never need to talk about this ever again.",
        "Deacon: I'm not worried about that. I'm not gonna say a word to anybody. Why would I? Nobody knows I'm here.",
        "Katie: What's going on? [Gasps] Oh, my God. Oh.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Katie: Where are you?",
        "Ridge: Just got back home.",
        "Katie: Go to the main house! Quinn needs you!",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Katie: Just go! I can see from my window she's in danger!",
        "Ridge: You can see what?",
        "Katie: She's got a gun pointed at her! Go! Hurry!",
        "Quinn: Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Think about it. Think about our wedding day. Remember? Think about how -- how beautiful that was.",
        "Deacon: You never even cared about me, did you?",
        "Quinn: That's not true. I did. I swear I did. We -- we were happy once. Please.",
        "Deacon: You know what they say about all good things.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] Deacon, no!",
        "Ridge: You okay?",
        "Quinn: [Breathing heavily] I am now. [Crying]",
        "Ridge: It's okay.",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: It's okay.",
        "Quinn: Oh, thank you! He would have killed me! You saved me! [Breathing heavily] You saved my life. I don't -- don't let me go. Just hold me, please. Hold me.",
        "Ridge: I got you.",
        "Quinn: [Crying]",
        "Ridge: It's okay. It's okay."
