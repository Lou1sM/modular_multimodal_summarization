{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["The search team has done all they can and tell Brooke, Eric and Katie they have called off their search. Bill offers three tines the money they were paid but the captain says that won't do any good. They have covered all the bases and Ridge is not out there. Katie wants to find the chopper pilot as he surely would know where he dropped Ridge. Eric says and yes be faced with a criminal suit. Bill looks worried. Brooke calls home and speaks with Hope and tells her no good news but she will try to call RJ tomorrow morning. She has a good feeling about today. Hope tells Aly that she'd like to be friends with her again. Aly says she always was. Hope says that she was confused for a time about her values and she does not feel she has that right to tell other people how to lead their lives. There is a balance there and carefree doesn't mean being reckless. Quinn does not believe this man sitting beside her is Hope's daddy, Deacon Sharpe, but finally comes around and thinks they can help each other. She fills him in on Liam who is leading Hope around by the nose, and her own son who is in love with her and better for her. And yes they both are Spencer's. She gives Deacon her cell phone number and suggests he go see Hope since she just lost her surrogate father who fell out over the gulf and has not returned.", "Wyatt shows up at Liam's who is actually friendly to him. He offers him some ice cream with nutty toppings. Wyatt says it still has freezer burn on it. Liam laughs that he still has it since Wyatt moved out. Wyatt apologizes for hitting Liam and asks Liam not to marry Hope. He's still not right for her. He doesn't think it is over between them. Liam says he knows Wyatt wants to believe that, but things are good between the two of them and nothing will ever change that. Deacon shows up while Hope is alone at home and she is stunned to see him at her door. Brooke needs fresh air and walks the beach. There in the distance she sees a figure all in white with his back turned but it looks like Ridge."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["[Mid-tempo music plays]", "Quinn: You're lying. You're not hope's father. Hope's father's in jail. Deacon... Sharpe.", "Deacon: Bingo.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Knock on door]", "Wyatt: Hey.", "Liam: Hey. [Clears throat] She's, um -- she's not here. She left. I don't think it's a good idea for you to go after her.", "Wyatt: Hope said to tell me that?", "Liam: Oh, no. I figured whatever hope needed to tell you she told you. I'm talking about Quinn. You had to know she'd show up here.", "Wyatt: Still envy me that I have a mother?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: It's morning in Abu Dhabi. They have to be up.", "Caroline: Didn't Brooke say that she was meeting with the rescue-team captain?", "Hope: Uh, yeah, someone from the directorate of ports, I think she said.", "Rick: I think it's safe to assume if they found Ridge, they wouldn't be waiting for some meeting to call.", "Caroline: Isn't the question that we should be asking ourselves is, should we be planning a memorial service, or should we keep pretending that Ridge could still be okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Speaking native language]", "Brooke: What did you find out?", "Bill: Hassan's on his way.", "Eric: You talked to him?", "Bill: No, some desk person.", "Brooke: I don't think he'd keep us waiting like this unless there's some kind of news.", "Eric: Well, time works differently here, apparently.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thorne: Well, if I was them, I wouldn't want to talk to us either.", "Katie: Why not?", "Thorne: I mean, they've been as tactful and considerate as they possibly could be, and we're just not getting the message.", "Katie: Well, what's the message, Thorne? That -- that he's vanished? That he's dead? What -- what -- we should just say, \"thank you,\" and be on our way?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: No, no, no. I have a feeling today's going to be different.", "Hassan: As you see, each quadrant is divided in six sections. The time and date each section was searched is here, followed by the number of divers and diving attempts.", "Katie: So, you're saying that there's no news?", "Hassan: I'm here to explain to you that there is news. It is my duty to report that our search is done.", "Eric: Are you saying that you've found something? Somebody saw him?", "Hassan: I am sorry, no.", "Brooke: Wait. Wait. How can you say that the search is complete when you haven't even found Ridge yet?", "Bill: You can't give up. I will triple whatever you and your men are being paid.", "Hassan: Sir, we are professionals. In no sense are we giving up.", "Katie: You think he's dead. That's what you're saying. You think he's dead.", "Hassan: I'm not saying that. I'm only saying that there is no more work for us to do. Everything that could be done was done.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: What if the news is so bad, mom can't bring herself to call?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Uh -- uh, maybe I should call Liam -- you know, see if Bill has talked to him. We all know Bill's not gonna call me, so...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: He hasn't. Liam doesn't know any more than we do.", "Hope: How do you know that?", "Aly: Well, if he had, he'd be here...for you.", "Caroline: She's right.", "Aly: So, it's true? You and Liam are back together now?", "Hope: Yeah.", "Aly: Well, that's something. Out of all this awfulness, that's something.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Oh, wait. A little angrier.", "Deacon: Seriously?", "Quinn: Oh, my -- it is you, deacon Sharpe.", "Deacon: You know, sometimes, I swear I've got a higher power looking out for me.", "Quinn: Well, amen to that.", "Deacon: Mm. Saved me from taking you back to my motel.", "Quinn: [Chuckles] No, occasionally, in the past, I have slept with a man on the first date, but you got lucky in a whole different way.", "Deacon: [Chuckles] Is that what this is? A date? You, uh -- you looking for a little action at the bar?", "Quinn: [Chuckling] Dude, you have no idea how much action you just walked into.", "Quinn: So, how long have you been back in L.A.?", "Deacon: Who says I am back?", "Quinn: Have you seen hope?", "Deacon: Why? Is she okay?", "Quinn: Physically. She's got a sociopath leading her around by the nose -- Liam. Lame. Ugh. He's alienated her from most of the people who love her.", "Deacon: Well, that is the Spencer way.", "Quinn: [Sighs] My son and I are heartbroken. Why do you think I'm even sitting here?", "Deacon: So, you're friends with hope?", "Quinn: I told you I knew her before I even knew who you were. I had every reason to believe that I was going to be her mother-in-law.", "Deacon: Wait a second. Wait a minute.", "Quinn: Hmm?", "Deacon: Is he the kid that caught those jewel thieves?", "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Wyatt. That's my boy. She dumped Liam for him. Of course, what woman wouldn't?", "Deacon: Wyatt who?", "Quinn: Spencer -- fuller. Spencer.", "Deacon: Fuller-Spencer?", "Quinn: No. Spencer.", "Deacon: Wait. Wait a second. Not the same Spencer.", "Quinn: Oh, the one and the same.", "Deacon: So, you're married to --", "Quinn: No, no. No. It was a youthful indiscretion.", "Deacon: So, dollar Bill Spencer has another bastard son with you.", "Quinn: Yeah. Pretty much.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Ice cream -- nuts and brandy on top. You used to make it all the time when you lived here.", "Wyatt: You even noticed? This ice cream has freezer burn on it. It's like ice leather.", "Liam: [Chuckles] Yeah, well, it would. You left it here.", "Wyatt: Look...I'm sorry I hit you.", "Liam: Okay.", "Wyatt: That's what ripped it for hope.", "Liam: Yeah, I mean, whatever you want to think.", "Wyatt: Will you tell her I apologized?", "Liam: I mean, yeah, but pretty sure she knows at this point you'll say whatever.", "Wyatt: How is that different from you, again?", "Liam: Ah -- oh, I don't know. [Sighs] I mean, would you make me stale ice cream with brandy on top if I showed up at your door?", "Wyatt: You never have. I always came to you. You know, you might think that I'm the bad brother and that you're the good one, but I'm the brotherly brother. You're the \"I was here first\" brother, the \"I have it all so buzz off\" brother.", "Liam: Yeah, well, [Scoffs] Being nice to you got me where, exactly?", "Wyatt: It's hard to be nice to someone when you're so insanely jealous of them.", "Liam: Wait, which one of us are we talking about now?", "Wyatt: Why would you be jealous of me?", "Liam: Uh, I'm not aggressive like you. I'm not as charming as you. I don't make everyone fall in love with me.", "Wyatt: You think you're not aggressive?", "Liam: [Chuckles] Yeah, you know, there were times where I-I wished I was more like you. I just got over it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Telephone rings]", "Rick: It's your turn.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Hello?", "Brooke: Hi, honey. Sorry I'm calling so late.", "Hope: No, no. That's fine. I hope that means that you're calling with good news.", "Brooke: They've officially called off the search.", "Hope: Oh, God.", "Brooke: It's not gonna change anything. We're just gonna get a new search team. Just don't say anything to R.J.", "Hope: That's -- yeah, of course. Um, I just -- you know, I don't know how long aunt donna can keep him oblivious.", "Brooke: I'll figure something out. I'll call there first thing in the morning before R.J. Goes to school.", "Hope: Yeah, I'll make a point to be there.", "Brooke: Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I still don't understand why no one has questioned the pilot. If anyone knows where he dropped in, it's him.", "Eric: This pilot's in for a big lawsuit, not to mention criminal charges.", "[Speaking native language]", "Thorne: I'm not sure how much sense it makes to stay on here.", "Katie: Well, I'm not leaving without Ridge, without answers.", "Bill: There's always a-a next thing that can be done.", "Eric: Such as what, Spencer?", "Bill: Where are you going?", "Brooke: [Sighs] I'm just going out for some air.", "Bill: Want me to come with you?", "Brooke: No, it's fine.", "Katie: Can't say you weren't warned. Doesn't matter who Brooke says she's in love with. Ridge will always come first.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Hey, Aly, do you think that I could talk to you for a minute?", "Aly: Sure.", "Hope: Yeah?", "Rick: With that, we are leaving you.", "Hope: Okay. Bye. I love you.", "Rick: Love you, too.", "Hope: Um...Aly, I would really like it if we could be friends again.", "Aly: Hope, I-I was never not your friend.", "Hope: Well, you were worried about me, and, um, when I look back on it now, I think I understand why. You know, when I decided to take a public stance on my values, I was very young, and I didn't really know what they were, and nobody stopped me.", "Aly: There was nothing wrong with the public statements you made.", "Hope: I just don't think that I have any right to tell other people how to live their lives. Everyone wants to feel free, everyone wants to feel safe, and that could look different to any two people.", "Aly: I think you're safer now with Liam.", "Hope: I do feel safe.", "Aly: And just as free, right?", "Hope: Yeah. I mean, there's a balance there that you have to find, and I think being careless isn't the same as being free, and I may have taken it too far in that direction.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: That was disgusting.", "Liam: Yeah, that's why you like it.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] [Sighs] Is Hope coming back tonight?", "Liam: No. I'm sorry.", "Wyatt: She's not moving in here, is she?", "Liam: [Chuckles] I doubt it.", "Wyatt: You know, she feels she has to be a certain way with you.", "Liam: Meaning what?", "Wyatt: [Sighs] I mean, you're not gonna listen to my advice, anyway.", "Liam: Yeah, probably not, but, you know...", "Wyatt: Don't marry her. It'll be a mistake.", "Liam: I'm shocked you think so.", "Wyatt: She'll want it -- or at least she'll say that she does.", "Liam: [Sighs] And what she really wants is...?", "Wyatt: It's a matter of needs, Liam. She discovered something about herself.", "Liam: With you.", "Wyatt: Passion can't be manufactured. People who find it once will always be drawn back to it.", "Liam: [Chuckles] What -- what do you think -- what do you think my life with hope was like, Wyatt? We were both happy, and we were both satisfied.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: Can I get the check, please?", "Quinn: Why are you running of", "Deacon: Why don't you go ask your boyfriend?", "Quinn: No. No, no, no. I have never had, nor have I ever wanted a boyfriend. Bill was just a donor who fathered my son. But don't go. Don't go. I, uh -- I think we could be good for each other.", "Deacon: [Scoffs] Yeah, well, as, uh, enticing as that is, I don't share women with Bill Spencer.", "Quinn: [Chuckles] Oh, well, yeah, you already have. Brooke Logan. Oh, see? I'm a wealth of information.", "Deacon: Brooke -- Brooke would never --", "Quinn: Yes, no, Brooke and Bill went off to some Mideast desert country to go get married. But -- oh, don't worry because I stopped them...with this. Mm. See? My little selfie.", "Deacon: Charming.", "Quinn: [Chuckles] Yeah. Well, now they're about as fond of me as they are of you. So, any more questions? I can see you're dying to ask.", "Deacon: Okay. I hear Ridge came back from Europe.", "Quinn: That is true.", "Deacon: Mm. But what I didn't hear is that the two of them got married.", "Quinn: [Gasps] That's why you came back. Was opportunity knocking? [Knocks on bar] Oh, man, I don't know what men see in her and, apparently, never stop seeing it. Ridge -- thank you -- is shark bait. He didn't want Brooke, but he didn't want Brooke to be with Bill so he chased after them, staged this daring rescue in a helicopter, which he promptly fell out of into the deep blue sea.", "Deacon: Well, is he dead?", "Quinn: Um, I don't know. He's no longer with us. The young ones are pretty broken up.", "Deacon: [Sighs] I mean, he practically -- he practically raised hope.", "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Which is why you should go and see her.", "Deacon: [Scoffs] I-I think that's about the last thing in the world hope wants.", "Quinn: She just lost her surrogate father. Who's she gonna turn to? You know what? This...is my cell phone. Call me or text me. Tell me what happens. You've got questions. I've got answers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: We have got to find a better way.", "Wyatt: Than what?", "Liam: Than this -- than you angling for my sympathy and then sucker-punching me with an insult.", "Wyatt: I'm just pointing out that my relationship with hope was different than yours.", "Liam: Yeah, I know that, Wyatt. Biggest difference is yours is over.", "Wyatt: And I'm trying to convey to you that I don't think that it is.", "Liam: Yeah, well, I-I guess I got to give you a pass on that one. I've had my heart broken, too. I know how that feels. You open your mouth -- words come out -- excuses, threats. It's like putting a blanket on somebody who's in shock. I'm saying you're in shock, and I think it's the best possible thing that could have happened because you and hope were living in -- in a fantasy, and I know it doesn't feel that way to you -- not now, not yet.", "Wyatt: You -- you are -- you are so condescending that it makes me wonder if you remind her of Ridge. Maybe that's the attraction.", "Liam: You still have, um, the key to my place?", "Wyatt: You want it back?", "Liam: No. And if you lose it, I'm gonna give you another one. I-I don't -- I don't know how to do this, Wyatt. I don't know how to come at you any other way than by leading by my chin. You're gonna be in my life. You're gonna be in hope's life. You're gonna be an uncle to our children. I... [Sighs] And I -- that's what I'm driving toward here, and I can't make that happen until you accept that -- that the book is closed. The story is over. Hope and I are good, and... nothing is gonna change that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Knock on door]", "Hope: Uh, who is it?", "[Knock on door]", "Hope: Uh, hello. Who's there?", "Deacon: It's probably the last person you want to see.", "Hope: [Gasps]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Katie, where are you going?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I just -- I-I got to get out of this room. I can't listen to this \"is he or isn't he dead\" conversation any longer. I just have to get out of this room.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thorne: I'll make sure she's okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Ridge?"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKr4_JWx_bQ"}
