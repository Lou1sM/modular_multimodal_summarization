    "Recap": [
        "Steffy knows that Ridge feels that she should give up on Liam. Caroline realizes that Liam has been with Ivy for a good while now yet Steffy even says after tonight she thinks things will be different. She acts like this is just another little bump in the road to her getting back with Liam. When Steffy starts talking about making a surprise for Liam with all their good memories, Ridge just feels she is setting herself up for more hurt. Liam is probably talking to Ivy right now about the situation. Ivy tells Liam that everything will be all right. They are doing what they have to do for her to stay in the United States. She promises Liam that they are just dating and this is just paperwork. From all his questions, Quinn thinks Wyatt is missing the point. She assures him that she had nothing to do with this wedding other than perhaps giving Ivy a little push .not like the one in the Seine, but of reassurance. She is glad Ivy can come to her now in moments of advice or need. And she points out that if Ivy and Liam are married that leaves an opening for him and Steffy.",
        "Carter wants to keep this legal but asks if they can just skip to the I do's or perhaps they should touch upon their relationship and what makes it unique. They do not even need rings; just their intent to get married and then making their vows. Ivy thanks Liam. They follow Carter's lead. Liam is nervous and stammers a bit at times. Ivy asks if there is a problem. Carter finally pronounces them husband and wife and Liam kisses the bride. They all sign the certificate and Carter even takes a picture for more proof. Ridge thinks it is nice that Steffy and Caroline got along. At work Wyatt looks at a picture of Steffy and thinks back on their kiss. Steffy sits at her desk and looks lovingly at a picture of Liam. Ivy and Liam hug and kiss as they are now Mr. and Mrs. Liam Spencer. But Liam looks a little worried."

        "Liam: You okay?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I-I will be.",
        "Liam: Listen, we're gonna do this, okay? We're gonna get everything in order, and you're gonna be all right.",
        "Ivy: I just -- I can't believe how terrifying one word could be. Deportation? I mean, I don't want to leave my job. I don't want to leave my family and you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, I mean, a marriage certificate keeps you in the country. Nothing else has to change. This is good.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, Liam, we're still dating. And yes, okay, this is just paperwork.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Everybody told me to give up, let Liam go.",
        "Ridge: That's not exactly what I said.",
        "Caroline: He doesn't want you to get your hopes up. I mean, Liam and Ivy have been together for a while.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, they've had a good run. But I'm back now.",
        "Ridge: [Groans]",
        "Steffy: And Liam and I are working together.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, and that -- and that complicates things.",
        "Steffy: Not for me. And after tonight, it could be a lot less complicated for Liam, as well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: So, Ivy told you about her top-secret wedding plans?",
        "Quinn: It's not top secret. It was just last-minute.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, is she being deported tonight or not?",
        "Quinn: You know what, honey? All these questions and you're missing the point!",
        "Wyatt: What is the point?!",
        "Quinn: Liam is about to be a married man, so it doesn't matter what Steffy's feelings are for him because he's about to be off the market!",
        "Wyatt: Okay, that's great. But what I want to know... what do you have to do with all of this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: What'd you do, Mom?",
        "Quinn: I may have given Ivy a little push.",
        "Wyatt: Ugh.",
        "Quinn: Not in the Seine this time.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Into marriage.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] The girl was desperate.",
        "Wyatt: Well, she must have been if she was gonna discuss it with you.",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on! Ivy and I have built a really nice working relationship.",
        "Wyatt: Oh!",
        "Quinn: You know, she comes to me for advice.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, about jewelry.",
        "Quinn: I was just looking out for the girl, and I was looking out for you, too, because if Ivy and Liam are married --",
        "Wyatt: Oh, please don't say it.",
        "Quinn: ...Then you can have your chance with Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Liam's gonna talk to Ivy.",
        "Ridge: About you?",
        "Steffy: Yes. We had a very straightforward conversation. This isn't a feeling. It's not an interpretation. It's happening.",
        "Caroline: Well, I thought Liam was committed to Ivy.",
        "Steffy: Oh, that commitment could be changing tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Should we jump to the \"I dos\"?",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah, we can, I guess.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, the point is to get married, so...",
        "Ivy: Well, you know what? We shouldn't skip over anything because this does have to be legal.",
        "Carter: Well, normally I would say a few words about the couple, their relationship, what makes their marriage unique. Would you mind?",
        "Liam: Oh, you -- you want to say stuff about us?",
        "Carter: Yeah. I know how much you care about each other. I mean, you wouldn't be standing here if you didn't. Yes, it's a legal arrangement to help keep Ivy in the country, but it's also a testament to your connection, the trust you have in each other. Ivy knew she could come to you for help.",
        "Ivy: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I wish I knew what was going on!",
        "Wyatt: You really think Ivy's gonna text you?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] She might.",
        "Wyatt: Because this wedding was your idea?",
        "Quinn: You know what? It's probably a good idea that I haven't heard from her, because Ivy and Liam are getting married and they're too busy to tell anyone about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: This is a great time for Liam and me.",
        "Caroline: It's a great time for everyone at Forrester.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I know it's not gonna be all champagne and confetti. We have a lot of issues, a lot of history, and... you know, why I left.",
        "Ridge: That's what you needed at the time. Here you go.",
        "Steffy: Dad, I felt responsible.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] It was an accident.",
        "Steffy: I, uh... I was pregnant, and Liam told me not to get on my motorcycle, and I didn't listen. I lost our baby.",
        "Caroline: Liam would not want you to feel guilty about that.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. I know. He didn't. He didn't want me to leave. He felt burned that I did. And then time went on, and -- and he moved on to Ivy, but I can't blame him for that. I just -- I shouldn't have let anything come between us. Adversity shouldn't have split us up. It should have brought us together. I mean, look at you guys. Adversity brought you guys together. You helped my father draw, and -- and you're helping Caroline. It could have been the same with us. If I handled things differently, I really believe Liam and I would be married right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here... we can skip all of this.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Okay, yeah, that's true. I mean, there's no guests, so no point in asking if anyone objects.",
        "Carter: No readings, no exchanging of rings.",
        "Ivy: Uh, will that be a problem?",
        "Carter: No, no, a lot of people choose not to wear rings. Look, all you need to do is state your intent and make your vows.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, no, that's good. That's -- that's -- that sounds good, right?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carter: Okay.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Carter: Please join hands and make your statement of intent to one another. Do you, Ivy, take this man to be your husband?",
        "Ivy: I do.",
        "Carter: Do you, Liam, take this woman to be your wife?",
        "Liam: I do.",
        "Carter: Since your intention is to be joined in matrimony, you will now make your vows. Ivy, repeat after me. \"I, Ivy, take thee, Liam, to be my lawfully wedded husband.\"",
        "Ivy: I, Ivy, take thee, Liam, to be my lawfully wedded husband.",
        "Carter: \"To have and to hold from this day forward.\"",
        "Ivy: To have and to hold from this day forward.",
        "Carter: \"For better or for worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health.\"",

        "Carter: \"For richer.\"",
        "Liam: Right. Right. For --",
        "Ivy: Uh, L-Liam, is there a problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Ivy's just another bump in the road.",
        "Ridge: That's not what Liam was saying a few weeks ago.",
        "Steffy: Dad, I wasn't living here. We weren't running Forrester together. A lot has changed. And a lot hasn't.",
        "Caroline: So it's like old times between you two?",
        "Steffy: When I'm with Liam, it feels like -- it feels like I never left Los Angeles. And I think he feels the same. But just to be sure, I have a little surprise for him.",
        "Ridge: What? A surprise? What surprise?",
        "Steffy: Just a reminder of what we meant to each other.",
        "Ridge: Don't do that.",
        "Caroline: That's sweet.",
        "Steffy: Dad, please, stop.",
        "Ridge: No, I just -- I don't want to see you set yourself up and get hurt.",
        "Steffy: I just want him to remember the good times, okay?",
        "Ridge: I'm sure he does.",
        "Caroline: He must if he's thinking about getting back together.",
        "Steffy: And that can't happen unless he ends it with Ivy. And I think he's doing that right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Sorry.",
        "Carter: You want to keep going?",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Liam?",
        "Liam: Ivy... I know you're scared. You have a good life here. You're happy. We're -- we're both -- we're both happy. And I don't want you to be deported. I said that I would do whatever I could to help, and I meant that.",
        "Ivy: Liam, you are helping me. I wasn't just being dramatic before when I was saying you're saving my life. Everything I've worked for, everything I care about is right here, and I don't want to lose it.",
        "Carter: We can take a break if you need to talk.",
        "Liam: No. Let's keep going.",
        "Carter: You sure?",
        "Liam: I, Liam, take thee, Ivy, to be my lawfully wedded wife. For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health...",
        "Carter: \"To love and to cherish.\"",
        "Liam: To love and to cherish as long as we both shall live.",
        "Carter: Liam, Ivy, you've pledged yourselves to each other in marriage. And with these vows, you sealed your commitment to each other. It's my honor to pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Now I just need you to sign the certificate, and I'll take care of it right away.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Carter: Ladies first.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Carter: And there it is. It's done. Mr. and Mrs. Liam Spencer.",
        "Liam: Ooh!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Carter: Now, take a step back and let me take a picture of you. We need all the proof we can get.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Okay. Good?",
        "Carter: Yes. Yes.",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Carter: And one more, see the dress.",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Carter: Beautiful. I'll text this to you.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Carter: You are very welcome. Congratulations.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: So...",
        "Ivy: So... we're married.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? You have worked too hard to build a life for yourself to have it all ripped away by a stupid technicality. You don't have to go back to Australia. You can live your life here.",
        "Ivy: Thanks to you. It's like that day at the Seine again.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: You've rescued me, Liam. I can never thank you enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: So, what do you think Steffy's planning?",
        "Ridge: Nothing too crazy, I hope.",
        "Caroline: Are you not sure about Liam?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I'm not, but it's not about Liam. It's about Steffy, always full speed ahead.",
        "Caroline: I wonder where she gets that from, 'cause I don't know anybody that's like that.",
        "Ridge: Do you want to try the walker again?",
        "Caroline: You see what I mean?",
        "Ridge: I don't -- I don't see. What are you -- what are you talking about?",
        "Caroline: I love the way that you encourage me. But I am fine just where I am.",
        "Ridge: It was nice seeing you guys get along. It was good.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. That might take a little getting used to.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, it's a little awkward, right? A little strange?",
        "Caroline: No, no, no. It's great. It is. What Steffy had to say about us was interesting.",
        "Ridge: Interesting, but not right. Half-right. I want to help you get better. Of course. I want to see you back on your feet. But that's -- that's not why I'm with you. It's not adversity. It's not what brought us together. I didn't fall in love with you because I didn't know how to draw. I fell in love with you because you are the most complete person I know. And I don't want to live without that.",
        "Caroline: See, when you say stuff like that, it makes me fall in love with you all over again.",

        "Liam: Hey. Thought you were gonna change.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, I was going to, but this dress is just so pretty.",
        "Liam: Well, you made a beautiful bride.",
        "Ivy: Thank you. I felt like one. You know, the ceremony was actually a really good idea just in case immigration does check this kind of thing.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: I can't believe how emotional I got, you know? It was just when you were saying those words, \"for better or for worse,\" I just kind of got swept up in the moment.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know.",
        "Ivy: Look, I know that I have to stop thanking you eventually. But, Liam, when -- when that immigration agent came to me and said that I might have to leave, that I could be arrested, that I may never come to America --",
        "Liam: Hey, we took care of it. You're not going anywhere.",
        "Ivy: Now that I'm Mrs. Liam Spencer.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: Look... I know what this is. I was just emotional. It has been a really crazy day.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Yeah, I sure didn't think I'd be getting married when I woke up this morning.",
        "Ivy: You know, I really wasn't sure that you were gonna say yes. I mean, I had no backup plan if you said no. I know that things are really complicated between us right now, and I know that getting married probably hasn't helped. But you have helped me. I love you, Liam. My husband. [Chuckles]",
