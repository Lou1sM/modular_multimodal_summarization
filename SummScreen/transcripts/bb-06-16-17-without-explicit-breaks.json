        "With Deacon on the floor, Quinn clings to Ridge and says she is safe because of him. When Deacon comes to he wants to know what happened. Quinn says he was an idiot and tried to kill her. Ridge tells him to stay down, the police are on the way. Deacon says he needs to talk to Quinn. She broke his heart and pushed him off the cliff but he's not a snitch like she is. Katie comes rushing in and is surprised to see it is Deacon. He says he needed money. He was desperate and messed up. Eric tells Lt. Baker that he hasn't seen Sheila in years; in fact he thought she was dead. Lt. Baker says they will do their part by keeping Sheila locked up for a long time. Eric retorts that finally his wife will be safe. Eric and the police then show up at his house. Ridge speaks up and says it was not Sheila; it was Deacon. Deacon declares that all he wanted was a couple of bucks. He did not mean it to come to this. He tried to text Quinn but she would not answer. He tells Eric that she started it first by pushing him off the cliff. Deacon assures Katie that he was not setting her up. She's always been nice and treated him great. Despite his denial, the police arrest Deacon and take him away. Eric tells him he has always been pathetic and trouble around here.",
        "Wyatt, Brooke and Bill rush in as they heard news on the radio. Eric says he has never been so grateful to his son, Ridge, in his life. Bill surmises that Sheila had nothing to do with any of this. It was Deacon all this time. Quinn says if it were not for Katie and Ridge that she would be dead. Eric thanks them for saving his wife's life. He tells Ridge that he is a hero to him and he gives Katie and Ridge a hug. Eric confides to Quinn that Sheila was at the police station so he thought Quinn was perfectly safe otherwise he would not have left her there alone. Lt. Baker calls Eric and says they are in the process of booking Mr. Sharpe now. So Sheila is not involved in this but there is still the restraining order so it is up to Eric what to do next. Katie is glad that Will was with someone else and was not home for this. Brooke realizes this will be another bond between Quinn and Ridge now that he saved her life. Alone Quinn thanks Ridge again for what he did for her. She puts her hand on his shoulder and admits that she loves him."

        "Eric: This is unbelievable that this has happened. I haven't thought of Sheila carter, not for a minute. I haven't thought of her for years, and now here she is? I have no idea why she's here. And then she shoots at my wife?",
        "Lt. Baker: Yeah, your wife was really lucky. That bullet could have been the end of her.",
        "Eric: [Sighs] God, I can't... I can't bear to even imagine that. Well, the important thing is that she's here. She's caught, and she's behind bars.",

        "Bill: I thought Sheila carter was in custody.",
        "Eric: Quinn's still at the house. I should get home to her right away.",

        "Eric: She won't admit it.",
        "Lt. Baker: Yeah, not surprising considering her history.",
        "Eric: [Sighs] I'm just glad she's away from my family. I want to keep her away from my family, from -- from everyone.",
        "Lt. Baker: Well, we'll do our best to keep her behind bars.",
        "Eric: [Sighs]",
        "Lt. Baker: Any good judge would see she's a flight risk. And with an attempted murder charge, she's not getting out on bail.",

        "Ridge: Take it easy. Police are on their way.",
        "Deacon: Hey, look, I'm not stupid, all right? I'm not gonna try anything. I just want to talk to Quinn alone for a minute.",
        "Quinn: You are such a fool! You're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison!",
        "Deacon: Quinn, please. What do you want from me? I'm broke! I-I just need a little help!",
        "Quinn: By shooting at me?",
        "Deacon: I tried reaching out to you! I got nothing!",
        "Ridge: She doesn't owe you anything, deacon.",
        "Deacon: Oh, that's easy for you to say, Forrester. I loved her. She dumped me. You broke my heart.",
        "Quinn: You are so selfish. Things are always all about you. You are a worthless drunk! I should have known you would do something like this! I don't want you near me ever again!",
        "Deacon: All right. Calm down, all right? You're fine. You're as beautiful as ever.",
        "Quinn: Are -- are you serious? You're hitting on me right now? Really?",
        "Deacon: Quinn, please. Just call off the cops, all right? Let me walk out of here! I don't want to rot for the rest of my life in a jail cell!",

        "Quinn: No, it was just a little shove! That's all!",
        "Deacon: A little shove off a cliff into the ocean! You know, thank god there was high tide, otherwise I would have been a goner! Yeah! Did I go to the cops?! No! Why? 'Cause I'm not a snitch! I gave you a second chance! I'm just -- I'm just asking for you to do the same!",

        "Ridge: All right, that's enough.",
        "Deacon: You know, for a dressmaker, you got a pretty good right hook.",
        "Ridge: You're lucky that's all you got. I said don't move.",

        "Eric: It was you?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, it was me. But she did it first! Oh, yeah. She pushed me off a cliff. What? Your blushing bride didn't tell you that one?",
        "Quinn: You're crazy.",
        "Deacon: See what I mean?! You see what I mean?! Crazy! Nice attitude! You know, now that you're Mrs. Eric Forrester living up here in this big estate, loaded with gold cards and cash! What about me? What do I get? Nothing! Nada! I helped you build your business! And you just left me high and dry. Quinn, all I wanted was a couple of bucks.",
        "Eric: Son of a bitch.",
        "Lt. Baker: Lopez, cuff him.",
        "Deacon: W-wait a second! Wait! Just hang on! Quinn, look, I wasn't trying to be greedy! I didn't mean for it to come to this! I-I kept reaching out to you! You wouldn't answer my texts!",
        "Quinn: You just tried to end my life, and you're complaining that I wouldn't answer your texts? I was right to cut you out of my life! You're insane!",
        "Deacon: Oh, yeah, I'm insane, right? Ha! That's rich coming from you!",
        "Katie: You were on my property, weren't you?",
        "Deacon: Wait, you own that big house over there? Wow. You seeing anyone these days?",
        "Katie: My god. Did you do this to set me up so I would take the fall?",
        "Deacon: No. Come on, Katie. You've always been really cool with me. No, I would never do that to you. What kind of guy you think I am?",
        "Quinn: No, he wouldn't do that. He would just try and kill me. He's a real standup guy.",
        "Lt. Baker: Okay, enough of this nonsense. Were you working with Sheila?",
        "Deacon: Sheila who?",
        "Eric: Sheila carter.",
        "Deacon: Pfft. That's a blast from the past.",
        "Lt. Baker: So you've had no contact with her?",
        "Deacon: No, the last time I heard, she was six feet under.",
        "[Radio chatter]",
        "Deacon: Wait. She's not?",

        "Deacon: Wait, come on, guys. I said I was sorry!",
        "Eric: Sorry doesn't cut it, all right? You're gonna pay for everything you've done to this family!",
        "Deacon: Quinn, please. Come on. Come on, baby. You know me! I-I wasn't never gonna hurt you! I just wanted some attention. Let's go.",
        "Deacon: Ow! Look, all right. All right, look, I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry I messed everything up. Eric, I'm -- I'm sorry to you, too. Come on. No -- no hard feelings, right? Look, I've always respected you. Actually, I think you guys make a nice-looking couple. I mean it. I hope you're happy.",
        "Eric: You're pathetic. You've never been anything but trouble around here.",
        "Deacon: Eric, please. Let me make this up to you, all right? Look, I'll do anything! I'm practically begging! Quinn, I just wanted a reaction!",

        "Brooke: Eric!",

        "Quinn: It's a long story.",
        "Eric: Look, everybody was --",
        "Wyatt: Are you okay?",
        "Quinn: Oh, sweetheart, I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "Wyatt: What happened? I-I thought that -- I thought Sheila was in jail.",
        "Ridge: Oh, she is.",
        "Wyatt: But I heard there were gunshots.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: That was deacon.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: They're taking him down to the police station.",
        "Wyatt: Wait, why would deacon -- what the hell happened here?",
        "Katie: I saw that Quinn was in trouble, and I called ridge immediately, and -- and he saved her life.",
        "Eric: Thank god for that. I've never been more grateful to my son in my life.",
        "Ridge: As long as everyone's okay.",
        "Quinn: I don't know how I'm ever gonna be able to thank you.",
        "Bill: So Sheila Carter really had nothing to do with this? Deacon was the shooter the whole time?",
        "Eric: Apparently.",
        "Brooke: This is crazy. He's had his issues before, but nothing like this.",
        "Quinn: He's been hounding me for money. He's been making veiled threats for months.",
        "Eric: Why didn't you tell me about that?",
        "Quinn: I didn't bother responding. I just kept ignoring him. I figured he'd just give up and go away.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, you should have said something. We could have gotten a restraining order or more security around here, something.",
        "Quinn: I honestly didn't think he would take it this far. He shot at me. He -- he came into my house. I-I was -- I was terrified. I thought that was the end. If it wasn't for Katie and ridge, I'd be dead.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you both. I mean, I don't know what to say.",
        "Eric: Katie. Thank you. If you hadn't been so fast on your feet, I don't know what would have happened. I'm so grateful you got down here in time. You saved my wife's life.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: Ridge, you're the hero today. Thank you. Quinn, I'm sorry. I left you here. I-I thought you were safe. Sheila was at the police station. She was being booked and fingerprinted, and I-I thought you were perfectly safe here. I never would have left you alone otherwise. I'm sorry.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: It's okay.",
        "Lt. Baker: Ah, thanks. Great.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Eric: Excuse me, everyone.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: Yes, hello?",
        "Lt. Baker: I just wanted to let you know that deacon Sharpe's in the process of being booked right now.",
        "Eric: Good.",
        "Lt. Baker: I also spoke to miss carter. Apparently she was telling the truth. She wasn't involved in either shooting. But she did violate the restraining order, which gives us cause to hold her in custody, so what do you want to do?",
        "Wyatt: Deacon's lucky that he wasn't here when I got here, 'cause I swear to god --",
        "Bill: All right, take it easy, son. Look, I'm all for a good ass-kicking, but the police have it under control.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure he's gonna be locked up for many, many years.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, he better be.",
        "Bill: Where's will?",
        "Katie: Will is with Nina. She took him to Donna's house this morning. He was not around for any of this.",
        "Bill: Good.",
        "Brooke: This is awful what Quinn's been through.",
        "Bill: Yeah, it's terrible. Uh, most importantly, uh, Katie, you've been vindicated.",
        "Wyatt: Well, nobody actually thought Katie shot at anyone.",
        "Katie: Yeah, except for the police officer who was testing my hands for gunshot residue.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure Eric and Quinn feel terrible about accusing you.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, I, um... I kind of lost it when Quinn fired me, and I-I picked up Charlie's gun, and I-I aimed it at her.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, we kind of heard about that.",
        "Katie: I feel terrible about it.",
        "Bill: You had a moment, Katie. We've all had them.",
        "Brooke: The important thing is that you're okay and you were able to call ridge, and then he was able to rescue Quinn.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Quinn owes her life to ridge.",
        "Brooke: This will connect them forever.",
        "Quinn: Sends shivers down my spine to think about what he tried to do to me.",
        "Ridge: Deacon is in custody. He can't hurt you anymore.",
        "Quinn: I almost died today. And when I needed someone... more than I've ever needed anyone in my life... you risked yours to protect me.",
        "Ridge: And I would do it again.",
        "Quinn: Look at this house. My family and my husband. I have this renewed sense of gratitude.",
        "Ridge: So something good came out of all this.",
        "Quinn: Because of you. Because of what you did for me. I'm sorry. I have to say this. I love you. [Sighs]"
