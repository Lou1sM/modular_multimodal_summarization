        "Brooke is walking the beach and suddenly in the distant she sees a figure all in white that looks just like Ridge from the back. She runs toward him and when he turns around, it is Ridge. Gasping with tears in her eyes, she runs into his arms but he doesn't say a word nor does he act like he really knows her. Hope is surprised to open her door and find Deacon there. He said he just rolled into town and it's been far too long. And he wasn't even sure she'd want to see him. He asks if Brooke is home and Hope says no and lets him in. Hope fills him in quickly on what happened to Ridge and why Brooke is away. He tries to convince her that he has a good feeling about this and Ridge will be fine. She says she hopes he is right as losing Ridge is not an option. Too many people are counting on him. Deacon says he knows that Ridge was more of a father to her than he ever was. He ruined her wedding in Italy. Hope says she has had a lot of time to think about that and it wasn't all Deacon's fault. Bill Spencer put him up to it. She hasn't forgotten but all she can think of now is Ridge. Deacon is surprised to hear about Ridge and Katie as that came out of left field. Then he asks about the man in Hope's life. She tells him it is still Liam. Deacon wants to know if he is good to her, and she replies that he is wonderful. That's all Deacon wants to hear. He says she deserves the best. He is going to stay n town this time. There is not a day that goes by that he doesn't think of her and wants to build a relationship with her. He knows he has to earn that but he wants to be her dad.",
        "Thorne and Katie have lunch and she says she just has to keep thinking that Ridge is out there alive and someone will find him. Thorne says he can't go through this again, first losing Darla and his mother and now Ridge. He knows they have had their differences but he is his big brother and always there for him. Brooke rushes into Eric's room and shows him Ridge who is behind her. Stunned, Eric grabs Ridge and gives him a big bear hug. Ridge just holds on. He finally says he is not sure what all the fuss is about. Eric wants to know everything that has happened to him and what he needs now. Ridge says just to go home. Eric says Ridge is going to go home to the best homecoming ever seen. He tells Ridge that both Thorne and Katie are here and will be so glad to see him. Ridge says that's nice. Eric looks to the sky and tells Stephanie their boy is here. Ridge wants to know how long before they can get out of here. Eric tells him he needs to take a moment and catch his breath. Ridge says he feels fine. Eric says he will go tell the search team and Brooke says she will call Hope. Of course Hope is ecstatic and even hugs Deacon. He is so happy for her. She says with him coming and now Ridge this might be the most epic day of her life. She's got to let everyone know. Deacon says he will leave her with that. He knows they have a lot of celebrating to do. Brooke tells Ridge that Hope was so happy they all are. They knew he was out there. She knew it in her gut and in her heart. They have been connected for so many years, spiritually, emotionally, physically. And that is a bond that goes on forever. She will always feel that and knows he will too. She says she will always love him and he is her best friend. They will run to the end of the earth for each other and that is what he did to come here to save her. Ridge says it didn't quite turn out the way he planned. She says he is still her hero and it turned out all right as he is standing here. She gets to look into his eyes and know RJ still has his father. She adds that she doesn't know what she would have done if she had lost him. He says he is not going anywhere. She says she wants to hear every little detail but right now she just wants to hold onto him and never let go. As she is hugging him Katie walks in."

        "Hope: Well, you -- you got here at a very strange time. Uh, things are pretty intense right now. Uh, Ridge is missing. He -- he fell out of a helicopter, actually, over the Persian Gulf, and they can't find him. Nobody knows where he is.",

        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Yeah, well, if you ask me, I think it's the smartest thing she ever did. If you think about it, last time I-I was around, what did I do? I helped ruin your wedding in Italy. I -- [Scoffs]",
        "Hope: Yeah. And I've had a lot of time to think about that, and I know that it wasn't entirely your fault. I mean, Bill Spencer had a lot to do with that. He's the one who put you up to it.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, well, that's still not an excuse.",
        "Hope: Trust me. I haven't forgotten. But it's in the past. It is, and -- and so much has happened since then. And, honestly, the only thing that I can think about right now is Ridge.",

        "Katie: I just keep telling myself that I have to keep the faith. I have to keep believing that someone is gonna find him alive. But maybe I'm just fooling myself. Maybe I should be preparing for... [Sniffles] I just keep thinking that I would know, that I would feel it if -- if he were dead. But I... I don't know what to feel. I'm just gonna keep believing that he's out there somewhere, and someone is gonna find him. I'm just gonna keep believing that he's still alive.",

        "Deacon: Yeah. So, who's the lucky guy in your life?",

        "Deacon: Is he good to you?",
        "Hope: He's wonderful.",
        "Deacon: That's all I wanted to hear. You deserve the best.",
        "Hope: Yeah, he and I have been through a lot. [Chuckles] Um, there was this other guy I was seeing. Um, his name is Wyatt. And he and I had a lot of fun together, but after everything that's happened with Ridge... I've realized what it is that I want and need for my life, and that's Liam.",
        "Deacon: As long as he makes you happy.",
        "Hope: He really does.",

I mean, I-I know -- I know I'm gonna have to earn it, but I want to be there for you. I-I-I want to be there, 'cause you're going through so much right now. I love you, and I-I know that I don't deserve this. I just -- I want... I want the chance to be your dad.",

        "Katie: Then where is he? When are we gonna find him?",
        "Thorne: It's got to be soon. [Sighs] I don't -- [Sighs] I don't think I can go through this again, Katie. I mean, with mother, Darla -- there's been too much loss already. I know that Ridge and I have had our differences, but... [Sighs] ...I could always count on him. And when I needed my big brother, he, uh... he'd be there.",

        "Katie: My engagement string. [Chuckles]",
        "Thorne: Leave it to Ridge to get creative, huh? He better upgrade that ring as soon as he gets back to L.A. Better be the first thing he does, actually. [Chuckles] [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Before all this happened, we were planning our wedding. We were gonna get married and raise our boys together, and... never look back. And we had our whole future ahead of us.",
        "Thorne: Hey, it can still happen. You know, I keep looking at that door, thinking that... [Chuckles] ...He's gonna walk through it at any minute.",
        "[Both sigh]",
        "Katie: If only it were that easy. He just appears out of nowhere.",

        "Brooke: Uh...you know what? I think you just need to take a moment and -- and catch your breath.",
        "Eric: I think Brooke's right. Just try to relax, all right? You -- are you hungry? You want some food?",
        "Ridge: No, thank you.",
        "Brooke: I think he's feeling a little out of sorts. It might take you a little while to feel like yourself again.",
        "Ridge: I feel fine.",
        "Eric: You didn't tell me how you found this guy. I mean, he doesn't look any worse for wear. Where was he?",
        "Brooke: He was by the beach. He was down by the water. And his back was to me, so I didn't know it was Ridge. But I started walking to him, and then I just got this... this feeling. And I knew. I knew it was Ridge, so I ran. I ran to him, and he turned around, and yes. [Chuckles] Yes, it was -- it was Ridge.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] I'll bet you couldn't believe your eyes. I can't.",

        "Deacon: Okay. I'm happy for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You should've heard her voice. She's ecstatic. We all are. Ridge, I knew you were out there. I knew it in my gut... in my heart.

And I know you will, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Deacon: Listen, this is great news, and I'm gonna leave you with this, because just seeing you smile makes your dad happy.",
        "Hope: Thank you. I -- [Sighs] I'm glad that you're here.",
        "Deacon: I want you to plan on seeing a lot more of me.",
        "Hope: I will.",
        "Deacon: Good.",
        "Hope: I got to say -- I'm going on record and saying that this is probably the most epic day that has ever happened.",
        "Deacon: You know what? I think it just might be.",
        "Hope: [Laughing] Oh, my God. I have to tell everybody! I have to tell everyone that Ridge Forrester is alive and well!",
        "Deacon: Well, you get on with your celebrating, all right?",
        "Hope: Oh, I will. We're gonna be celebrating all night long. Oh, my gosh. I wish that I could be in Abu Dhabi right now with everybody to -- to be with my mom and -- and -- and Ridge, to hug him and to see the look on Katie's face when she sees him. I -- can you imagine?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I know.",
        "Brooke: I will always love you. And you will always be my best friend. And no matter what we're doing in our lives or who we're with, we will run to the ends of the earth for each other. That's what you did. You came here to save me... just like you have so many times in the past.",
        "Ridge: Well, it didn't exactly turn out the way I planned.",
        "Brooke: You're still my hero. And yet it turned out pretty good, because you're here, and I get to look into your eyes and know that our son still has his father. I don't know what I would've done if I'd lost you.",
        "Ridge: I'm not going anywhere, Logan.",
        "Brooke: I know. [Chuckles, sniffles] I'm just so happy that I found you. And I want to hear everything. I want to hear all the details. I want to hear what happened. But right now, I just... [Sighs] I'm just so happy that you're alive. [Chuckles, sniffles] Ohh. [Sighs] I just... want to hold on to you... and never let go. [Chuckles]"
