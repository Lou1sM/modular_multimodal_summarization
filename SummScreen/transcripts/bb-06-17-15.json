{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7091 ~ Steffy hopes the surprise she has for Liam will convince him they are meant to be together; Ridge discourages Wyatt from his pursuit."], "Recap": ["Ivy walks out of the kitchen thinking she has that glow about her like an old married woman. But she is embarrassed that she fell asleep so early last night. They will have to make up for it tonight. Liam reminds her again they only married to keep her in the country so nothing has really changed. She will bring some clothes over to make it look real. Ridge is designing but can't get Steffy's attention. She is knee deep in thought looking at Liam's picture and finally tells her dad that she does not want to joke about it and hopes it will last the rest of their lives. She will see Liam later today since he is not at the office. Ridge tells her that he wants her to be happy but last he looked Liam was with Ivy. Steffy thinks perhaps last night may have been a game changer. This is now their time and she wants to remember every single detail they shared before.", "Likewise Quinn is distracted and Wyatt can not get her attention that they need more rings to be designed. That is what customers are asking for. He is not interested in what Quinn is thinking if Liam and Ivy got married. If they did then he knows Liam feels pressured as he is not ready to get married. Quinn thinks it would be great as that would free Steffy up for Wyatt. He laments that he's been there done that before and he doesn't want another girl who is hung up on Liam. He would welcome Steffy with open arms if it was him that she really wanted.", "Ivy and Liam decide to take separate cars to work and he will come later. The first thing he does is to call Steffy when Ivy leaves for the office. Ivy walks into Quinn's office and Quinn knows immediately something good happened and jumps up to greet her. She wants all the details. Ivy tells her that in time she will give Liam an annulment or divorce but Quinn says no. Liam will want them to stay married so do not give up on that. It was a real legitimate wedding whether it started out that way or not. Steffy walks into Liam's house holding a bag, several in fact. He asks how she is and she says now that she is back here she is terrific. And she is not moving in so for him not to worry. She just wants to take him down memory lane of what they once shared and could have again. Wyatt goes to see Ridge and tells him that he thinks he will like Quinn's new designs. Then he asks about Steffy and Ridge says he knows they have been spending some time together but she is off to see Liam now and Wyatt should not get his hopes up with her. When she puts her mind to something she usually gets it, so he is going to stay out of this and he thinks Wyatt should do the same. Steffy drags out a slide show of pictures, then a snow globe and even some truffle fries and Bob Hope movies. She has thought of everything. She'd like to take him paragliding but settles for toy army men on a parachute and they horse around inside. She kisses him passionately and he responds. Then she pulls out two mood rings, the ones they used to get married in Aspen. She tells him that she knows if it were not for her they would still be married. So she is sorry that she left him, but she loves him and is ready to start up again. Liam tries to tell her that before she goes on he has something to tell her, and it is about Ivy. Steffy sloughs it off and says she knows it had to be difficult last night. He says yes it was and he does not want Steffy to over-react. He and Ivy got married last night. Then she laughs and says no, it sounded like he said he married Ivy last night. That can not be. Tell her that is not true."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Ivy: So, do I look any different?", "Liam: [Chuckles] You're still beautiful.", "Ivy: Oh. Thought I might have a new glow or something now that I'm a married woman. You know, I can't believe we fell asleep so early last night. It's the most boring wedding night ever.", "Liam: Yeah. Well, it was a stressful day. We were both exhausted.", "Ivy: Yeah. We'll just make up for that later. Hey, uh, I was thinking I should bring over some of my stuff on the weekend because Carter said we have to make this marriage look as believable as possible.", "Liam: Uh, yeah. No, that's -- that's okay. I'm good with that, as long as we're still on the same page about the...", "Ivy: I get it, okay? It's an agreement. It's just a piece of paper that allows me to stay in this country.", "Liam: Yeah. Right. Exactly. I-I married you so you wouldn't be deported. I'm really glad I did...", "Ivy: Yeah, Liam --", "Liam: ...But that's all it was, you know? We're still dating. I'm sorry.", "Ivy: Nothing's changed.", "Liam: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Hey, what do you think? Would you wear this?", "Steffy: Huh?", "Ridge: A dinner party or something? I'm not sure about it.", "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah.", "Ridge: Steffy.", "Steffy: What? What?", "Ridge: You're fired.", "Steffy: Don't even joke, okay? You'd be lost without me.", "Ridge: I --", "Steffy: Mm-hmm.", "Ridge: Yeah, you're not wrong about that. Where's the V.P.?", "Steffy: I haven't seen him today, but I'm gonna stop by his house later. I have a little surprise for him.", "Ridge: When are you gonna be done with that project?", "Steffy: I'm hoping never. That Liam and I will keep making memories for the rest of our lives.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: We've tried that before, and it didn't work, remember? Rose quartz does not do well in 90% of our markets.", "Quinn: Too hippie dippie.", "Wyatt: Okay, rings. Ivy agrees the customers want more. Stackable, cocktail, whatever you can come up with. Oh, I'm sorry! Am I keeping you from something?", "Quinn: What? What? What about rings?", "Wyatt: Make more of them.", "Quinn: Who says?", "Wyatt: Oh, my God. Where are you right now? What is your deal?", "Quinn: I am really sorry, okay? I am so sorry. I'm just -- I-I-I'm dying to find out. It's making me a little distracted.", "Wyatt: Dying to find out what?", "Quinn: About Ivy and Liam. Don't you want to know if they got married?", "Wyatt: I haven't really thought about it.", "Quinn: If Liam marries Ivy, Steffy has no choice but to move on, and think about what that could mean for you.", "Wyatt: Mom, stop! For once in your life, can you just please stay out of it?", "Quinn: Oh, but if you had to take a guess!", "Wyatt: If he went through with it, it's because he felt pressured, obligated. But he's not ready to be married again.", "Quinn: Yes, but then Ivy could stay in America, and it would open the door for you and Steffy. And don't act like that's not a good thing for everybody!", "Wyatt: That would be great. I would love that. Steffy is gorgeous. She's dynamic, she's a hell of a lot of fun. But I don't want anyone who's still hung up on Liam. I've been there and done that with hope. I'm not doing it again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: What are you trying to accomplish?", "Steffy: I told you. I'm getting Liam back.", "Ridge: Mm-hmm. You sound pretty sure of yourself.", "Steffy: No reason not to be.", "Ridge: And Ivy? She's out of the picture, then, or...?", "Steffy: Last night was a game changer. Definitely a big shift in their relationship and for Liam and me.", "Ridge: Whatever makes you happy.", "Steffy: Liam, dad. Liam makes me happy. I mean, come on. Come on. Take a look at this. How cute are we?", "Ridge: Where was that? Aspen?", "Steffy: I have a few things in store for Liam. I just want to remind him how good we are together.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Are you sure you don't want to just take the one car to work today? It'd be fun. We could, uh, we could walk in there with our own, little secret.", "Liam: [Chuckles] It won't be a secret for long.", "Ivy: Why? You mean once Pam finds out?", "Liam: Uh, you know, I think I'm gonna come in a little later. I-I have some stuff to take care of.", "Ivy: Okay. Hey, don't -- don't cook tonight. I want to make dinner.", "Liam: Oh, you don't have to do that.", "Ivy: Well, I know. But I want to. See you later. Have a good day.", "Liam: You, too.", "[Door opens]", "[Door closes]", "Liam: [Sighs] Hey, uh, are you coming over here later still? 'Cause I-I really need to talk to you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Of course. I'll be there in a bit. It's happening. Liam and I are getting our life back.", "Ridge: I don't know, Steffy. The more I think about that, the more it's just -- it's a bad idea.", "Steffy: You don't know Liam like I do.", "Ridge: No, I -- and I'm glad I don't. Too much history is a bad thing. That's why your mom and I, we could never work it out. Every time we'd try, we'd just fall into the same pattern.", "Steffy: Okay, my relationship with Liam is completely different than your...", "Ridge: It's completely different until it isn't. The only thing different in this is that -- that Ivy's right in the middle of it.", "Steffy: You think I'm setting myself up to fall.", "Ridge: Yeah. No. Maybe. I don't know. I just don't want you coming back here crying, wanting me to defend your honor.", "Steffy: Does that sound like me? Compromising my integrity? I'm not begging for Liam. I just believe that we need to have another chance. I remember everything. I wanted to remember every moment, you know, every laugh, every look, every song. I want to relive it again with him. And I want to do it over and over and over again. Our future starts today.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: I like your optimism. It's very impressive.", "Quinn: Got to keep a positive attitude. You can't let all the negativity bring you down.", "Wyatt: Right. Have you been reading too many self-help books or something?", "Quinn: This is what happiness looks like!", "Wyatt: Right. No, I agree. I just liked you better when you were alone and miserable. You're kind of annoying now.", "Quinn: If Ivy and Liam have gotten married, be prepared for Steffy to come knocking on your door.", "Wyatt: I would welcome that opportunity with open arms -- if that's what she wanted, if I was the one that she wanted and not because Liam is off the market. I won't do that again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "[Door closes]", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "[Door opens]", "Quinn: Ivy! I've been waiting to hear from you. What happened? [Gasps] You did it. You did it! You and Liam got married?!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Steffy: Liam?", "Liam: Yeah, uh, in here.", "Steffy: Hi.", "Liam: How are you?", "Steffy: I'm good. Now that I'm back here. You by yourself?", "Liam: Uh, yeah. Just me.", "Steffy: Oh, I'm not moving in if that's what you're thinking. [Chuckles] At least not yet, anyway. I have a surprise for you. A few surprises, actually. I know you've had a lot on your mind and you've had to make some big decisions. I know you talked to Ivy last night. Whatever happened between you two, it must have been pretty intense. But I don't want to talk about that right now. I want to put a big smile on your face and take you on a little stroll down memory lane. Remind you of all the incredible times we shared and the many more to come.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Give me all the details.", "Ivy: Okay, well, at first I was nervous because I didn't know what Liam was gonna say.", "Quinn: Right, 'cause you were worried he might say no.", "Ivy: Yeah, which I wouldn't have blamed him. I mean, what I was asking of him was huge. I've never asked a favor of this from anyone before. But I just -- I explained to him that immigration was breathing down my neck --", "Quinn: And that marrying you was the only way to keep you in the country, your life, your job.", "Ivy: Oh! I'm just -- I'm so grateful.", "Quinn: Ivy, I am so thrilled for you.", "Ivy: And I told him that once enough time passes and my citizenship is secure, well, then, I could give him an annulment or a divorce.", "Quinn: No. That's not going to happen. Liam is gonna want to stay married to you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Hey, Ridge. You, uh, working on some new designs?", "Ridge: I'm trying.", "Wyatt: Oh. Well, my mom and I were just -- had a meeting about the, uh, the new collection, and -- and I think you're really gonna like it.", "Ridge: Yeah, I hope so.", "Wyatt: [Sighs] Have you seen Steffy around?", "Ridge: She was here earlier.", "Wyatt: Any idea where she is now?", "Ridge: She went to see Liam.", "Wyatt: Hmm.", "Ridge: You really thought it was gonna be that easy, huh?", "Wyatt: No. I, uh, I know it's not easy when Liam's involved.", "Ridge: I know you and Steffy have been spending time together.", "Wyatt: A little bit around the office. I mean, it's, you know, it is what it is. But for what it's worth, I do think she's phenomenal.", "Ridge: I don't want to interrupt you. I'm sorry, man. But I should give you advice. I just don't want you to get your hopes up. Steffy's trying to work it out with your brother.", "Wyatt: Hmm.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Rock music playing]", "Liam: [Chuckles]", "Steffy: I spent too many nights alone reminiscing about all our great moments together.", "Liam: Hmm.", "Steffy: It was one thing to think about them, to talk about them. But it's another to relive them. One place in particular stands out far --", "Liam: Don't even play with me. Aspen. Are you kidding?", "Steffy: [Laughs] You remembered. Of course. Our special place.", "Liam: Yeah.", "Steffy: Hold that thought.", "Liam: Okay. [Laughs] Yeah.", "Steffy: We took a carriage ride through town.", "Liam: Yeah, we did.", "Steffy: See?", "[Birds chirping]", "Liam: [Chuckles]", "Steffy: Just wait. I have something else.", "Liam: There's more?", "Steffy: Mm-hmm. Remember what we used to eat?", "Liam: What is that?", "Steffy: Oh, I don't know. Just a little bit of -- a little bit of --", "Liam: Oh, my God.", "Steffy: Truffle fries.", "Liam: No.", "Steffy: [Laughs] Remember we used to eat them.", "Liam: Yeah, every single day. Are you kidding me? Oh.", "Steffy: I know.", "Liam: Oh, yes. Oh!", "Steffy: They're so good.", "Liam: Mmm! It's so good. It's so good.", "Steffy: And what goes with truffle fries?", "Liam: What goes with truffle fries?", "Steffy: Oh, I don't know. A little bob hope.", "Liam: Bob hope. Yep.", "Steffy: [Laughs]", "Liam: Oh, that's amazing.", "Steffy: You see? All of our favorites.", "Liam: Awesome.", "Steffy: So, after we finish watching movies and being couch potatoes and we got to burn off the truffle, so... I was thinking...", "Liam: Here it comes.", "Steffy: We could go outside and get some fresh air and go paragliding.", "Liam: [Laughs]", "Steffy: [Laughs]", "Liam: Oh, sure. Yeah, just right over the beach. Right, we'll jump off a cliff.", "Steffy: I mean, I'd be totally down. But we can't do that, so in the meantime, we'll have to... ah... these will have to do!", "Liam: Oh, come on.", "Steffy: How great are these?", "Liam: Wow.", "Steffy: Okay, ready? I'm gonna count to three.", "Liam: And then we go?", "Steffy: Yeah, we go.", "Liam: Okay.", "Steffy: One... two... three.", "Liam: Oh! Man down. Man down.", "Steffy: I have more, I have more.", "Liam: You have more? Give me one. I want another one. Okay.", "Steffy: Oh, mine are gonna be tangled.", "Liam: I don't care. I don't care. I'm gonna win.", "Steffy: Go.", "Liam: One, two, three. We're going. We're going.", "Steffy: Oh, I am so bad.", "Liam: He stuck the landing. I think I just won a medal for that. Okay, hold on. No, no. I think my guy landed on your guy.", "Steffy: No, it didn't!", "Liam: Yes, I'm getting this one.", "Steffy: [Laughs]", "Liam: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: That dress was a nice touch. Thanks for sending that over.", "Quinn: Oh, I can be helpful when I want to be.", "Ivy: Actually, it was really -- it was a great photo opportunity. It made the ceremony look a lot more legitimate.", "Quinn: I bet you looked stunning.", "Ivy: Well, I'm not gonna lie. I mean, it felt cool wearing that gown. It was very easy to get caught up in that fantasy.", "Quinn: Well, it was no fantasy. You got hitched last night.", "Ivy: Technically.", "Quinn: Well, was the ceremony able to be romantic in any way? Could you exchange vows?", "Ivy: Vaguely. The ceremony was so rushed. I mean, it's not like we're married on a spiritual level.", "Quinn: Yeah, but you're legally married, and that's all that matters.", "Ivy: I'm just trying to keep perspective.", "Quinn: Yeah, but you can have a little fun, you know. Enjoy it.", "Ivy: It's just -- Liam and I have a very clear understanding. We're dating. That's it. Nothing more.", "Quinn: As husband and wife.", "Ivy: On paper, yes. It's a necessity. It's not because we want to be.", "Quinn: Are you sure about that?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: It's pretty clear that Liam wants to be with Ivy.", "Ridge: Well, Steffy doesn't buy it. That's why she's over there.", "Wyatt: How many chances is Steffy gonna give that guy?", "Ridge: If she sees there's something left, she's gonna keep fighting for it. She's not gonna let it go.", "Wyatt: Yeah, but she might not have a choice.", "Ridge: I'm gonna leave it alone. And maybe you should do the same.", "Wyatt: It's easier said than done, Ridge.", "Ridge: I got to ask you something. What about Nicole? You had a thing for her, didn't you? What happened?", "Wyatt: Didn't end up going anywhere.", "Ridge: And why is that? Because you spilled the beans on Maya?", "Wyatt: Something like that, yeah.", "Ridge: You know what I'll do? I'll talk to Caroline. She can set you up with one of her friends.", "Wyatt: Oh, I don't think you're gonna need to do that.", "Ridge: You know something I don't?", "Wyatt: Just a vibe I'm getting.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Don't deny it. You liked it as much as I did.", "Liam: [Sighs] You have no idea.", "Steffy: No, I think I do.", "Liam: I have to say something.", "Steffy: Wait! Hold that thought. I have another memento for our journey through time. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Okay.", "Liam: [Chuckles] Our mood rings.", "Steffy: Yeah. The rings we used to get married in aspen.", "Liam: Yeah.", "Steffy: The surprise ceremony that caught us both off guard. [Sighs] If it weren't for me, we'd probably still be married right now. I'm sorry I left you. I'm sorry we lost our child and we were both going through so much pain. And I should have stayed here with you.", "Liam: It's okay.", "Steffy: I love you. I do love you. And now I'm back here. And we can start back up, keep the adventures rolling. I mean, I have so many things planned --", "Liam: Okay, all right, wait, wait. [Chuckles] Before we get ahead of ourselves, I have to tell you something. And, um...", "Steffy: Liam --", "Liam: It has to do with Ivy.", "Steffy: Whatever happened last night, I mean, I know it was hard for you, but you had to do the right thing.", "Liam: Can you just listen to me for a second? Something happened last night.", "Steffy: Okay, I'm a big girl. Like I said, whatever happened, as long as it was the last time, okay?", "Liam: That's not -- it's not that. Ivy and I -- oh, this is hard to explain. Um... and it's not -- it's not how it's gonna sound.", "Steffy: Not like what sounds?", "Liam: Just promise me you won't overreact to this.", "Steffy: Okay, Liam, when do I overreact? Come on.", "Liam: Yeah, you're right. You don't. Okay. Um... [Chuckles] Ivy and I, we -- we g-- we, um...", "Steffy: Just say it. What? Just say --", "Liam: We got married.", "Steffy: [Chuckles] Wait, it -- it just sounded like you said you got married. No. No way. That's ridiculous. There's -- you and Ivy?! Married?!"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j_ay06haPU"}
