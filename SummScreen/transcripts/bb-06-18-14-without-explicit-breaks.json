        "Amid her tears, Katie holds Ridge and says he is alive. He admits yes he is alive. He pats her back. She sighs that he has been gone like forever and for him never to do that to her again. He says he is sorry, and he won't. Katie tells him not to apologize. He's here, he's alive and well and he's beautiful. She has been so worried. Eric asks if Ridge can tell them where he has been. Slowly he says someone found him, took him in and now he is here. He is sorry he put them through this. Katie says again not to apologize. He has been in a freak accident and they will investigate it as soon as they get home as she knows he wants to get home. He says yes. Eric tells Brooke there is something a little off about Ridge. He's not really present and they perhaps should be worried. But they are going to find out. He's called a doctor and he's on the way. Aly asks Rick if they know why Hope called this emergency meeting. No one knows. Pam says the suspense is killing her and it must be about Ridge. Finally Hope comes in and says she has news. Ridge has been found alive. They all cheer that Ridge is okay. Carter tells Maya that she has to stop eyeballing Oliver. She asks if it is obvious. He says yes. She says she can't help it; alarm bells are going off. Carter says with Ridge's situation this is not the time. Justin meets with Bill and asks if there is any word. Bill says no. Justin says this is not good. Every minute that goes by his chances of survival gets worse. Bill replies that he doesn't know how in the hell this could go so wrong. He just wanted to teach Ridge a lesson, let him go for a little swim. Justin says something that he forgot to tell Bill, and he's not going to like it. Bill says great, let's hear it. Justin says just before he got word from Bill to cool Ridge off, he thinks Ridge saw him. Bill tells Justin to never protect him at his own expense. He should have told him sooner. Justin says originally he was there just to pick up Bill and Brooke. He had no idea what was happening on the ground. Ridge had his own chopper there and he had no idea this chopper wasn't his. Then Justin got the call to cool Ridge. He was surprised to see it was Ridge but he thinks he saw the SP emblem when he boarded. He might have put it all together. Bill is not happy but he says if Ridge is dead, it might be a moot point. Ridge keeps saying he is fine and wants to go home. Eric tells him they will wait and see what the doctor says. The doctor says from what he has been able to find out, Ridge hit the water pretty hard. The fall alone could have killed him, but he survived with a severe concussion. Brooke says they deserve some answers. They have been worried for days and the hospitals were on alert. The doctor says a family found him, that father was a doctor and took care of Ridge. Eric wants to know if there will be any after affects. The doctor says some memory loss and confusion. The brain can be tricky so only time will tell. Ridge should be monitored back in the states and he will be in touch with them. He tells Ridge that he has a lot of healing to do and for him not to be under any kind of stress. Ridge says that's it, they should go home now. Katie asks if she can speak with Ridge alone. She asks if he remembers them. Hope and Liam hug that Ridge is alive when it was looking like they'd never find him. She says she was really scared and what she realized during all of this that she never told Ridge enough how grateful she was to have him in her life and how much he meant to her. Liam says yes almost losing one really opens your blinders what it would be like without them. She says she is sorry if that is how Liam felt about her, but she appreciates him even more now and will never stop telling him.",
        "Aly thanks Oliver for his support and says she would have been a basket case without him. He says if she needs him, he'll be there. It's a given. Pam says thank goodness all of this hateful waiting is over. Rick says as furious as Ridge makes him, he did not want to learn to live without him. And he will tell him that now. Pam tells Donna she knows it is corny but she feels Stephanie had something to do with Ridge being found and bringing him back to them. She'd want him to experience what he is with Katie. Bill tells Justin that no one can find out he was piloting the chopper or that he dumped Ridge out. Justin says \"we\". Just then Brooke comes in and informs them the best possible news; Ridge is alive and well. He is a little fuzzy and will have some memory loss but she is sure that will pass. Katie tells Ridge that she is sorry. That is the sort of thing he has probably been asked to avoid. He will have some confusion so all she really cares about is that he is standing there before her and that she can reach out and touch him. They had so little time together but now they will have plenty of time to pick back up where they left off. Hope tells the group to gather around. She says they are all her family and when a family goes through what they have they make vows. They make promises to be more aware and be more grateful to the people that mean the most to them. But people do fight and when that happens she hopes they will remember how they feel right now. She gushes that she feels so blessed to have them in her life. And she is so happy to have another chance to tell Ridge how much she loves him and all of them. Ridge pulls away from Katie and says he has a little boy at home that needs his dad. So he just wants to get home. Katie holds up her hand with the red ribbon and says he can not possibly know how much strength that ring gave her. She remembers when he put it on her finger .how romantic and unexpected it had been. And she's going to take a leap of faith that he will remember every minute they have shared and how they fell in love and how they have planned on spending the rest of their lives together. She hopes he will remember that too."

        "Bill: No, nothing.",
        "Justin: Man, this isn't good. You know, the time that's gone by -- got to start wondering about his chances for survival.",
        "Bill: How the hell did this go so wrong? I just wanted to teach Ridge a lesson, let him go for a little swim. And what was I supposed to do? The guy crashes my wedding, shows Brooke the picture of me and Quinn, cheap-shots me in the face, grabs Brooke, and runs off. Man, I wasn't just gonna wave goodbye. And Ridge knew that. He deliberately provoked a reaction. And he got one. What -- what -- what's on your mind?",
        "Justin: Something I didn't mention. You're not gonna like it.",
        "Bill: Great. Let's hear it.",
        "[Both sigh]",
        "Justin: Before I got the word from you to dump Ridge in the gulf and cool him off, I-I think he might've seen me.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] It seems like you've been gone forever. I just -- don't you ever, ever, ever do that to me again! [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. I-I'm, uh --",
        "Katie: No, no. Don't apologize. Don't. You're here. You're here. You're alive. You're well. You're...you're beautiful, and I have just been so worried.",
        "Eric: Ridge, can you tell us where you've been and what happened?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, s-- uh, someone found me and took me in, and -- and now I'm here.",

        "Eric: Brooke, come here. I want to ask you something.",

        "Ridge: I'm s-- I'm sorry I put you through something --",
        "Katie: Don't apologize. Don't. You've been in a freak accident, and we are gonna investigate it. We are gonna find out exactly what happened just as soon as we're home. You want to go home, don't you?",
        "Ridge: I do.",
        "Katie: Okay. Let's go home.",

        "Brooke: Yeah. Something's off with Ridge. He's not fully present. Should we be worried?",
        "Eric: Oh, we're about to find out. I called a doctor. He's on his way.",
        "Hope: Can you guys just imagine my mom's reaction when they found him? I mean, they've had search parties out for so long, land and sea and --",
        "Pam: I know.",
        "Rick: It's pretty harrowing, not knowing whether or not my brother was dead or alive.",
        "Carter: Every day that went by, our chance of seeing him again getting slimmer and slimmer.",
        "Maya: I don't even want to think about it -- this family, this company without Ridge.",
        "Donna: And my sisters. Hello? I mean, Brooke and Ridge have a family, and Katie's now engaged to him.",
        "Aly: It must've been awful for them. All I kept praying was, \"please, God, don't take him.\"",
        "Oliver: And it worked.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Carter: [Quietly] You got to stop eyeballing Oliver.",
        "Maya: Is it obvious?",
        "Carter: Yeah.",
        "Maya: Well, I can't help it. It's just... alarm bells are going off.",

        "Bill: What the hell, Justin?!",
        "Justin: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Ridge might've seen that you were the one piloting the chopper, and you're just telling me this now?",
        "Justin: I figured you had enough on your plate, heading up the search.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] Do me a favor. In the future, don't protect me at my own expense.",
        "Justin: You have to understand. Originally, I was there to pick up you and Brooke, bring you home. I had no idea what was happening on the ground.",
        "Bill: I know that, Justin. You also had no idea that Ridge had his own chopper standing by to whisk Brooke away.",
        "Justin: He assumed that our helicopter was the one that he hired -- hustled Brooke aboard. Then I got the call from you to cool him off.",
        "Bill: So, when do you think he saw it was you?",
        "Justin: I was surprised when they boarded. I was wearing the Spencer publications flight jacket.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] The logo.",
        "Justin: [Sighs] Just as I banked, I saw Ridge staring. He could've been putting it all together.",
        "Bill: Well, if, uh...Ridge is... dead... it's a moot point. [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Now can I go home, please? Thank you very much. I'll be in touch.",
        "Eric: Let's hear what the doctor has to say.",
        "Ridge: I'm fine.",
        "Eric: Ridge, you took a huge fall. Now, did this have any effect on him at all? Any -- any permanent injuries?",
        "Katie: I mean, it would be helpful to know what to look for.",
        "Eric: Doctor?",
        "Doctor: Well, from what I've been able to find out, Ridge hit the water very hard. The fall itself could've killed him, so it's lucky that he survived with only a concussion. But it was severe.",
        "Brooke: Who took him in? A family. The father was a doctor.",
        "Katie: Why didn't they tell anyone?",
        "Brooke: We deserve some answers.",
        "Eric: Look, we've had search and rescue teams out. All the hospitals have been on alert.",
        "Katie: We've been worried sick! They're being questioned right now. I assure you, I'll find all the answers.",
        "Eric: What is his condition? Are there any after-effects?",
        "Doctor: Memory loss, confusion.",
        "Brooke: Is that permanent?",
        "Doctor: The brain can be tricky. Only time will tell. Right now, we don't know the full extent of his injuries. But, uh, obviously, Ridge should be monitored back in the states. Now, I assure you, I will find out everything, and I'll be in touch.",
        "Eric: We want these answers.",
        "Ridge: Well, thank you, Doctor. I'm -- I'm good now.",
        "Doctor: I sincerely hope so. But, look, in the meantime, you must take pains to assure yourself that you don't have any stress at all, all right? You have a lot of healing to do. You have my number. Please keep in touch.",
        "Eric: Yes, Doctor. Thank you very much. I appreciate your coming.",
        "Doctor: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's it, then. [Sighs] Let's go home.",
        "Brooke: R.J.'s been dying to see you.",
        "[Waves crashing]",
        "Ridge: R.J. Yeah, sure.",
        "Katie: Um, could I get, um, a moment alone with Ridge, please?",
        "Brooke: Um, yes, of course.",
        "Eric: Sure. We'll, um -- we'll meet you downstairs.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] [Sighs]",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Katie: So, the doctor said that you... you hit your head pretty bad. And you might have some memory loss.",
        "Ridge: Is that what he said? I don't remember.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles softly] That's not funny. [Sighs] Do you remember us?",
        "Hope: I am still wrapping my head around this. I mean, Ridge is alive!",
        "Liam: He's alive.",
        "Hope: I know!",
        "Liam: He's alive. It really was looking like they weren't gonna find him, you know?",
        "Hope: I was scared. I was really scared, Liam.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: And you know what I realized? I-I really realized that I did not tell Ridge enough how grateful I am to have him in my life, how much he means to me.",
        "Liam: Yeah. And I think almost losing someone really opens the blinders, you know -- shows you what kind of impact they have, what it -- what it would mean for them not to be in your life.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. You know, you never really lost me, right?",
        "Liam: Kind of felt like it for a minute, there.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I appreciate you even more now, and I'm never gonna stop telling you.",
        "Liam: Good plan. Good plan.",
        "Hope: Yeah. [Chuckles]",
        "Aly: I want to thank you.",
        "Oliver: For what?",
        "Aly: For your support. I would've been a basket case all this time, not knowing what happened to uncle Ridge, if I hadn't had you.",
        "Oliver: You need me, I'm there. That's a given.",
        "Aly: I was so terrified, for Brooke and Katie, grandpa, and dad. The thought of losing uncle Ridge -- he's at the center of us all, you know?",
        "Oliver: For this company, too. Ridge and I have had our differences, but I can't imagine Forrester creations without him.",
        "Aly: Well, thank God we don't have to.",
        "Oliver: [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: I am so glad that all this hateful waiting is over.",
        "Rick: Mm.",
        "Pam: And we've got a happy end.",
        "Rick: You know, as furious as he makes me... I didn't want to have to learn to live without him.",
        "Pam: [Sighs] Do you think maybe you should tell him that?",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] You better believe I will. [Chuckles]",
        "Justin: If anyone ever finds out I was piloting that helicopter --",
        "Bill: No, th-they can't, Justin. No one can ever know that you dumped Ridge out of that chopper.",
        "Justin: We.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: What happened?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] The best thing possible. [Sighs, chuckles] Ridge is alive.",
        "Bill: [Exhales deeply] [Sighs deeply]",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. That probably sounds like the pressure that you're -- you're supposed to avoid.",
        "Ridge: It's okay.",
        "Katie: I-I'm not gonna bombard you with a lot of questions. I... the doctor said that a side-effect of the concussion is some confusion. And, really... the only thing I care about, the only thing that matters to me is that you're standing here in front of me, and that I... and that I can reach out and touch you -- that... because, to be honest, I don't really know what I would do without you. I've been thinking that it's -- it's not fair, because we've had so little time together, but now... [Sniffles] Now we have all the time in the world. And we can pick up right where we left off. [Sighs]",
        "Donna: Yeah, sure thing. I'll let him know you called. Thanks a lot.",
        "Pam: If I tell you something, do you promise not to make fun of me?",
        "Donna: Uh... I promise. [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: I believe that Stephanie had something to do with finding Ridge and bringing him back to us. Is that really corny?",
        "Donna: No, Pammy. Oh, it's beautiful.",
        "Pam: I mean, she loved him so much. And he's really happy now to be starting this life with Katie. I-I just think that Steph would've wanted him to be here to experience all that.",
        "Donna: [Chuckles] And we both know that if anyone can boss around the universe, it's Stephanie.",
        "Hope: Hey, could I get everybody in here for a minute? I feel like I just want to have a moment for something. [Chuckles] Um, we are so lucky to have each other, to have Ridge back. You guys are my family, all of you. And I think that when family goes through something really hard and -- and really terrifying like what we all experienced, we make vows, you know? We make promises to be more aware, to be more grateful to the people that we count on. We're nicer, and we're more forgiving. But we all know that things happen. Life happens. People fight. Whenever that does happen, I would really, really love if we could all just remember how we're feeling right now in this moment. I feel so blessed to have you in my life -- all of you... and my mom and Eric and -- and Thorne and aunt Katie and Ridge! I -- I can't tell you how happy I am that -- that I get another chance to tell Ridge how much he means to me, just how important he really is to me, and how much I love him... and all of you. That's all. That's all!",
        "Liam: Hear, hear!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Rick: We love you.",
        "Bill: Ridge is alive? Are you sure?",
        "Brooke: Yes. I found him on the beach. Can you believe that?",
        "Bill: What do you mean on the beach? What -- just standing there?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckling] Yes! It was crazy!",
        "Justin: He's all right?",
        "Brooke: Yes, for the most part.",
        "Bill: What does that mean?",
        "Brooke: He suffered a concussion. He's a bit compromised.",
        "Bill: Compromised how?",
        "Brooke: He's a little foggy, and he has some memory loss. But I'm sure that'll pass. I mean, the important thing is that I found him and that he's alive.",
        "Bill: This is wonderful news, Brooke.",
        "Justin: Best in a long time.",
        "Ridge: I'm making you sad, and I don't want that.",
        "Katie: No. No, don't. Uh, it -- [Sighs] You've been through a traumatic experience, and you're overwhelmed.",
        "Ridge: I just want to go home. I-I have a-a little boy, and that boy needs his dad, so, uh... [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Yes. R.J., your son.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Everyone's gonna be so happy to have you back...",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: ...To know you're okay. No one's happier than me. I can't tell you how much strength I've gotten from this. My \"ring\"? [Chuckles] I remember when you tied it on my finger. It was so romantic and... unexpected and beautiful. You said that we had to take a leap of faith. And I'm gonna have faith that you're gonna remember every moment that we've shared... how we fell in love... and how we've been planning to spend the rest of our lives together. [Sniffles] Tell me you remember, Ridge. [Sniffles] Tell me you remember us. [Sighs]"
