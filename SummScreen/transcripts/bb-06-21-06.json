        "Stephen takes Brooke to task for her behavior at the fashion show. He tells her she is going to listen to him whether she likes it or not. He states why he got her the stock in the first place. And chastises her to say no to Ridge like she means it. He tells her she is being poisoned by Ridge, and this is not an vendetta against the Forrester's. He thinks she is in danger and is drowning and doesn't even know it. He asks if she has feelings for the company or the man and he's scared when she informs him it is both. She lashes out that she will not help him fight his battles with the Forrester's. He tells her this is not a tug-of-war. After more lecturing, he tells her she is throwing her life away and that she deserves better. But, she won't have that with Nick if she doesn't give it up with Ridge. Keep pushing and she was going to lose Nick and Stephen says he knows what it's like living with someone who doesn't love you back. He tells her he originally came back to make amends, but he realizes he is hurting her more than helping so he's leaving town. He advises her to marry Nick, be happy and to remember that he loves her. Before he walks out, she tells him she loves him too.",
        "It's Felicia's wedding day and Thorne and Darla have helped get preparations ready. She has flashbacks of Dante and Bridget. She loves her black wedding dress and tells Bridget she knows Dante loved her first and she needs to know if they still have feelings for each other? Dante also has flashbacks. His sour expression shows and his father notices. He confesses to his dad that he's in love with Bridget, but she doesn't want to hurt Felicia. Despite some fatherly advice, Dante rushes out to talk to Bridget. Meanwhile, Bridget fibs to Felicia and says she does not want Dante to be more than a friend. It's her sister's day and they hug. Later she tells Dante she will not hurt her sister and she wants him to leave her alone. She does reveal that Felicia knows they have or had feelings though she did not confirm it. And she means it, they are over! Dante still confesses his love and kisses Bridget just as Felicia walks in on them with the Maid of Honor's bouquet (black, very appropriate)."

        "Felicia: Because we share a son together? Bridget, Dante loved you first. So I need to know -- if you're having second thoughts. If you have feelings for him -- or if Dante still has feelings for you.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I asked you to leave me alone.",
        "Stephen: I've thought about what you've said. About me turning your life upside down.",
        "Brooke: Which time?",
        "Stephen: I got you that stock because I thought it would protect you.",
        "Brooke: The way you never did?",
        "Stephen: I wanted you to have something you've wanted all your life. I wanted to make damn sure nobody could take it away from you. I wanted you to be in control of Forrester Creations.",
        "Brooke: I am.",
        "Stephen: Well then act like it. Say no to Ridge like you mean it.",
        "Brooke: Did Nick send you here?",
        "Stephen: This is me talking.",
        "Brooke: Well then I'll tell you the same thing I told him. Forrester is a very big part of who I am.",
        "Stephen: The company or the man?",
        "Brooke: Both.",
        "Stephen: Well then you're scaring me, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: You think I'm weak.",

        "Brooke: And I am not you.",
        "Stephen: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Brooke: Mom married you on the rebound because she couldn't have Eric and it's been eating you alive ever since. You want me to fight your battles for you dad, but I can't -- I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aldo: You fall in love with Felicia's sister?",
        "Dante: Remember when I told you that I moved to this country because I fell in love with someone?",
        "Aldo: That was Bridget? I thought that it didn't work out.",
        "Dante: I asked her to marry me but she turned me down.",
        "Aldo: Felicia, she's a wonderful, wonderful woman.",
        "Dante: Bridget loves me very much. But she just realized that after I proposed to Felicia. I told Bridget, you know, that we have some time and that we could make it happen but she doesn't want to hurt Felicia. I understand that.",
        "Aldo: She doesn't have any idea?",
        "Dante: Remember the other night when she told me that I changed her life?",
        "Aldo: Felicia, she's the mother of your son.",
        "Dante: I know, Papa, and I would do anything for my son. But what about me? What about what I want?",
        "Aldo: I'm gonna tell you something, Dante. You're my son. I love you more than my life. Something happened a long time ago, before I married your mother. You know, I was traveling a lot for my business and I met a girl. We fell in love. What am I supposed to do? I promised my heart and my love to your mother and you are here.",
        "Dante: What happened?",
        "Aldo: What happened? Love, family. Some time, you don't know what is the best to do and that's why a father like me, that loves you dearly -- you should listen to me. What about your son?",
        "Dante: These are different times, though.",
        "Aldo: Different time.",
        "Dante: You ever thought about it, what had might've happened if you were to stay with that girl? I thought so.",
        "Aldo: Where are you going?",
        "Dante: I got to talk to Bridget.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: Speak now or forever hold your peace.",
        "Bridget: Where is this coming from?",
        "Felicia: Bridget, when Dante's family arrived the other night and I surprised everybody with my impromptu wedding plans, you looked like you lost your best friend.",
        "Bridget: No -- no.",
        "Felicia: So then, where did you go?",
        "Bridget: When?",
        "Felicia: When Dante went \"looking for the champagne.\" Please don't think I'm an idiot.",
        "Bridget: I don't.",
        "Felicia: I just need you to be honest with me.",
        "Bridget: I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Felicia: That Dante moved to this country to be with you. That he loved you.",
        "Bridget: Well, I was in love with nick. I'm telling you the truth, Felicia. I was in love with another man and Dante helped me get through one of the hardest times of my life. I will always be grateful to him for that. So yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe I did act like I lost my best friend but that is just plain selfish. You're my sister. And you love him, and he loves you. And you both have such a beautiful baby boy together.",
        "Felicia: It's not too late, you know. I am tough, practically indestructible. So, if you've changed your mind. If you want Dante as more than a friend.",
        "Bridget: No.",
        "Felicia: I'm not a charity case.",
        "Bridget: I don't think you are and I'll never treat you like one. You're an amazing woman and I am very proud that you are my sister. I don't want anything to come between us. No man. Nothing. Ever. I love you.",
        "Felicia: I love you, too, Bridget.",
        "Bridget: This is your day.",
        "Felicia: And I am so damn --",
        "Bridget: Happy.",
        "Felicia: Yeah.",
        "Bridget: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: I am not asking you to fight my battles.",
        "Brooke: You hate the Forresters.",
        "Stephen: Because of the way they treated you.",
        "Brooke: So the fact that mom married you by default and the fact that you felt that you could never measure up and that your daughter married Eric Forrester and had two children with him. I mean, all of that, does that factor into this obsession you have with trying to get me away from the Forresters?",
        "Stephen: No.",
        "Brooke: Now look who's not being honest?",
        "Stephen: Brooke, this is not a tug of war.",
        "Brooke: Well, why does it feel that way?",
        "Stephen: Because you won't get off the fence. You were going to fire the lot of them, and run Forrester yourself.",
        "Brooke: You know why I couldn't do that.",
        "Stephen: No, no, don't tell me you were thinking about what's best for the business because you were thinking about a future without Ridge.",
        "Brooke: I'm marrying Nick.",
        "Stephen: After that stunt you pulled yesterday, are you sure?",
        "Brooke: Get out.",
        "Stephen: When you told Nick that you were gonna model, he went along with it because he trusted you. When you said you were gonna try on lingerie for Ridge, he trusted you.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god! You're lecturing me about trust?",
        "Stephen: And then you make him sit there and watch while Ridge puts his hands on you!",
        "Brooke: It was a kiss.",
        "Stephen: It was a kick in the teeth, to the man you said you loved! You could've slapped Ridge's face. You could've shown clearly once and for all that you don't belong to that. But you kissed him back.",
        "Brooke: And you jumped from Taylor's bed to Jackie's bed, practically in the same day!",
        "Stephen: You are better than I am, Brooke. You deserve a better life. You're not gonna have it if -- if you stay addicted to Ridge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Hey, I need to talk to you.",
        "Bridget: I think we've said everything that there is to say about it.",
        "Dante: Wait a second! You still want me to marry Felicia when you know I'm in love with you?",
        "Bridget: You loved her enough to propose to her.",
        "Dante: Bridget, I never loved anyone the way I love you.",
        "Bridget: I am not going to do this.",
        "Dante: You want me as much as I want you.",
        "Bridget: Yes, Dante! Yes, I want you! But you're about to marry my sister. That's the way it has to be. If you love me as much as you say you love me then please leave me alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I am not addicted to Ridge.",
        "Stephen: Then why can't you move forward without him?",
        "Brooke: Forrester is a family company.",
        "Stephen: What about your family? The family you could have with Nick? You keep pushing, you're gonna lose him, honey. And believe me, I know about being with a woman who has feelings for someone else.",
        "Brooke: Mom didn't lose you. You walked out.",
        "Stephen: Leaving you children was the biggest mistake of my life. But had I stayed, you would've hated me more than you do now.",
        "Brooke: Oh, that's how you sleep at night? You were doing us a favor?",
        "Stephen: I loved your mother knowing I wasn't the one she wanted to be with. Knowing I wasn't the one she dreamt about at night. Is that the kind of hell you want for Nick? Ridge is under your skin. He's in your blood. You're poisoned by him.",
        "Brooke: Enough!",
        "Stephen: Listen, if you hear one thing I say, you are gonna think about it. This is not a vendetta against the Forresters for me. This is about you -- you! My beautiful, brilliant daughter that I love. You're in danger. You're drowning and you don't even know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: You want me to leave you alone after you told me you loved me?",
        "Bridget: I should have never said that.",
        "Dante: Just stop! Please! Bridget, I can't lose you! I don't want to lose you!",
        "Bridget: Felicia asked me if I was having second thoughts. If I had feelings for you or you had feelings for me.",
        "Dante: When?",
        "Bridget: Just now when I took her the dress. She asked me to be honest with her.",
        "Dante: Then she knows.",
        "Bridget: No, she doesn't know. I wouldn't tell her anything.",
        "Dante: So as long as we don't talk about it, it's not there? That's insane!",
        "Bridget: I told her that nothing would come between us. I meant it, Dante. You and I are over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephen: I wanted so much for you because I've given you so little. Nick loves you. You have more chance now of being happy than you've ever had in your life. You're throwing it away and I can't stop you. I just hope that you think about what I've said after I'm gone. I'm leaving town.",
        "Brooke: When?",
        "Stephen: As soon as possible. I came here to make amends. It's obvious I'm hurting more than I'm helping. And you mean more to me than -- well, maybe -- maybe you and Nick will honeymoon in Paris.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, maybe.",
        "Stephen: Marry him. Be happy. And never forget, sweetheart, I love you.",
        "Brooke: Dad! I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Everyone, this is our minister, Jill.",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Felicia: Thanks for coming.",
        "Christian: Still laughing at death, I see.",
        "Felicia: Finally, somebody who gets my sense of humor. Come here.",
        "Darla: Felicia? I have your bouquets. Would you like me take this one up to Bridget for you?",
        "Felicia: No, you know, I'll take them. I need to make sure she has tissues anyway. Something tells me I'm going to be crying like a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: I didn't make any promises.",
        "Bridget: Well, you made a commitment.",
        "Dante: I made a mistake! Do I have to pay for this for the rest of my life?",
        "Bridget: Well, Felicia almost died.",
        "Dante: That's not your fault. Okay, you don't have nothing to feel guilty about.",
        "Bridget: Well, even if that was true, even if I didn't have anything to feel guilty about, how could we ever be happy knowing that what we had done this to her?",
        "Dante: What was your reaction when you found out that I proposed to Felicia? That it was too sudden, that it was out of the blue, right?",
        "Bridget: What's your point?",
        "Dante: Don't you think Felicia feels the same way? Maybe I proposed to Felicia because I couldn't be with you. Maybe I was trying to be a family for Dino's sake.",
        "Bridget: If she felt that way before, she doesn't anymore. She really believes that you love her.",
        "Dante: I do love her, she's the mother of my son, but you are my life. You're the one I want to wake up to every day. You're the one that I want to go to sleep next to every night.",
        "Bridget: Please don't do this.",
        "Dante: Bridget, I love you. I love you."
