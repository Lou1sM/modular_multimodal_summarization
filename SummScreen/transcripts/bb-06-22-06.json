        "Eric: Did you two do all this? ",

        "Dante: Bridget? ",
        "Bridget: No, please, stop. Your son needs both of his \r\nparents. You have a family to be responsible for now. And you know me, I can't \r\ndo this to my sister. So, please, just -- love Felicia. Give her everything that \r\nyou have. And let your son know that his parents love each other, and they love \r\nhim. You'll find your happiness. You'll have every -- everything that you want. \r\nThey're all waiting for you downstairs. You have to go. ",
        "Dante: Felicia -- I'm not supposed to see the bride \r\nbefore the ceremony. It's bad luck. You look beautiful. Black dress. No one is \r\ngoing to forget this day. Look -- don't take too long. I'll be waiting for you \r\nat the altar. ",
        "Bridget: I can't seem to get through a single wedding \r\nwithout crying. Gosh, this lace that Filomena gave you -- it's just -- it's \r\nexquisite. You're so lucky, you know? His family already loves you so much.\r\n",
        "Felicia: And Dante? ",
        "Bridget: Well, no one more than Dante, of course. It's \r\nwritten all over his face. The way he looks at you. ",

        "Bridget: Saying goodbye. ",

        "Stephanie: What's wrong? ",
        "Felicia: What's wrong? What could possibly be wrong? I'm \r\ngetting married to the most talented, most handsome man. When I'm around him, I \r\ncan barely breathe. And he's the father of my son. And as if that isn't enough, \r\nI'm surrounded by family who loves me and who wants the best for me. What could \r\npossibly be wrong? ",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, I can't read your mind, honey. \r\nYou're going to have to talk to me. Tell me. ",
        "Felicia: My dear little sister, little maid of honor.\r\n",
        "[Knocking at door] ",
        "Eric: Felicia? Oh, you look wonderful. Every father \r\ndreams of his daughter finding this kind of happiness -- and for me, to have \r\nalmost lost you, makes this day very, very special. Are you ready? My two \r\ndaughters -- bride and the maid of honor. I will never forget this day. \n",

        "Taylor: Stephen -- ",
        "Stephen: Bad timing? ",
        "Taylor: No, actually, I was just thinking of you. \n",
        "Stephen: Well, me, too. I wanted yours to be the last \r\nface I see before I leave town. ",
        "Taylor: You're leaving? You're going away? ",
        "Stephen: Yeah, I'm on my way to the airport. But I \r\ncouldn't leave without seeing you one more time. ",
        "Taylor: You're going back to Paris? ",
        "Stephen: I wanted it to work out for Brooke and me, but \r\nshe's not ready. ",
        "Taylor: Well, the healing process takes time. \n",
        "Stephen: You're right. So now, I just hope that someday \r\nshe'll call me. But for now, I'm not going to intrude on her life anymore. Which \r\nis pretty much what I wanted to say to you. Taylor, the time we were together \r\nwas important to me. And I feel badly that's it's caused you some regret. \n",
        "Taylor: Oh, Stephen -- ",
        "Stephen: No, no, no, I understand. You said you and I \r\ncan't be together, and I respect that. ",
        "Taylor: It's just that, you came into my life at a \r\nreally difficult and a very confusing time. ",
        "Stephen: I realize that. But if you ever need help, of \r\nany kind, or if you just need a friend, I'll be here in an instant. Well, \r\nactually, I'll be here after about a ten-hour plane ride, but you get the \r\npicture, I hope. ",

        "Minister: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to \r\nwitness the joining together in holy matrimony of Felicia Forrester and Dante \r\nDamiano. ",
        "[Speaking Italian] Before we begin, I'd like to ask \r\neveryone to stand and repeat after me the vows of support that we as a community \r\noffer this couple. I, as witness for Dante and Felicia -- ",
        "Congregation: I, as witness for Dante and Felicia --\r\n",
        "Minister: Do hereby vow -- ",
        "Congregation: Do hereby vow -- ",
        "Minister: To respect and honor this union -- ",
        "Congregation: To respect and honor this union -- \n",
        "Minister: To support Dante and Felicia in times of \r\nhardship -- ",
        "Congregation: To support Dante and Felicia in times of \r\nhardship -- ",
        "Minister: And to always do my best to keep this marriage \r\nstrong. ",
        "Congregation: And to always do my best to keep this \r\nmarriage strong. ",
        "Minister: Felicia? Your vows? ",
        "Felicia: Dante, do you promise to be spontaneous, to \r\nsurprise me every day, to avoid the obvious and celebrate the unexpected? \n",
        "Dante: I do. ",
        "Felicia: Good by me. Your turn. ",
        "Dante: Felicia, do you promise to follow -- always \r\nfollow your creative spirit, to bring joy and delight in our home, to be the \r\nbest mother for our children, and depend on me for love and support so you \r\nrightly deserve? ",
        "Felicia: I do. ",
        "Dante: I also have to say, all of my life, I only \r\nthought of myself. But you have changed that for me. By bringing our son into \r\nthis world. Our son, Dino, has brought me a happiness I never thought existed. \r\nAnd so, I pledge to you, I give myself to you and our son and your well-being \r\nfrom this day forward. ",
        "Felicia: I know this might seem unconventional, but Jill \r\ndoesn't mind, do you? If I address my family? ",
        "Minister: It's your day. ",
        "Felicia: It is our wedding day. And it's proof that \r\nmiracles can happen. My doctors told me that Dino would never be born alive. And \r\nthen more doctors told me that I was days away from death. And at that point, \r\nDante and I barely knew each other, much less loved each other. And yet, in \r\nspite of everything that's gotten in the way, here we are. I never thought I \r\ndeserved a man like Dante. But I am going to be the kind of wife and mother that \r\na man like Dante deserves. Because you love me for who I am. He loves me for me. \r\nDino, Dante -- thank you for making my dreams come true. ",
        "Minister: May I have the rings, please? The rings?\r\n",
        "Dante: With this ring, I thee wed. ",
        "Dante: Felicia? ",
        "Bridget: Are you all right? ",
        "Felicia: I'm sorry. I can't do this. ",
        "Dante: What? ",
        "Bridget: Honey, listen -- ",
        "Felicia: Will you stop acting like the supportive \r\nsister? You are supposed to be my maid of honor. Do you even know what that \r\nmeans? You are supposed to support me on the most important day of my life. \r\nInstead you're making eyes at my husband behind my back. What is it with you? \r\nCan you not stand to see anybody else be happy? ",
        "Stephanie: Felicia! ",
        "Felicia: I planned this very special day to celebrate my \r\nlove for this man, and for bringing my family together. And I wanted it to be \r\nperfect. And it was. Except for one minor detail. You're ruining it! Your \r\nbehavior today is appalling. Okay, look, I'm sorry, but I can't continue with \r\nthis. This cannot be the day that I have to remember for the rest of my life as \r\nmy wedding day. This will not be the day that I tell my grandchildren about. \r\nDante is my fianc\u00e9. He loves me. And the day we get married, you will not be the \r\ncenter of attention. You were my sister. You should be ashamed of yourself.\r\n"
