{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Liam tells Quinn this conversation is over. She has lost her employment and Wyatt and Hope are over. Ridge may be home but that doesn't absolve Quinn's doings. Quinn says it might if he would let Hope think for herself. He would not even let Hope talk to Wyatt and she wants to forgive him. Liam tells her to get this into her head. There is no way left for her and her son to get into Hope's life. Quinn doesn't know what Hope sees in him. He's been given everything \u0096 his name, his job. He hasn't had to work for one thing like Wyatt who has been by Hope's side working toward her success. Wyatt gave her a priceless diamond and Liam gave her a kitten, oh and he wrote an article about puppies. Liam says Hope is not about the dollar sign; she has a different set of values Quinn would not understand. Quinn says Wyatt doesn't have dollar signs either. He did not meet her on Rodeo Drive or in his father's high-rise; it was in the woods. She wants to know if he has thought at all how this is going to affect his brother. Liam says if Hope was concerned at all about her line, she would not have fired Wyatt. Quinn quips maybe she did it to protect Liam's fragile ego She does not believe that Hope wants to ruin Wyatt's life or that Liam really wants to either. So just let Wyatt come back to FC. Her son did nothing wrong so it's not right to punish him for something that she did. And if he and Hope are so happy then there should be no harm in them working together. Liam admits he could do that, but he's not. He's not that crazy. He doesn't want Wyatt anywhere near Hope. Quinn says his insecurities is showing. Liam says yes because he doesn't trust Wyatt or her either. And his only regret is that he did not throw her ass out sooner. So he motions for her to shoo, get on and leave. He doesn't care what she thinks. The only thing he cares about is Hope and his future with her. As they sit around in a quick meeting, Aly says it is a relief. Hope says it's like a gigantic lift off of their shoulders and Rick says now they can get back to work. The press and RJ never knew that Ridge was missing so they need to keep this low-key. For now couture is on hold and HFTF their sole priority. Rick turns to Caroline and Hope and says they need to turn up the volume. Aly chimes in that Oliver can help as he has a photo shoot today with Maya. Aly says now that Wyatt and Quinn are gone they can put the focus back on Hope's message where it belongs. Hope says Caroline's collection is showcasing that; it's light and youthful and full of movement. She thinks the photo shoot should be the same. She intimates that perhaps Maya was distracted when Ridge was missing but he's back now so unless there is something else she expects to see that trademark smile again in the photos. Maya keeps eyeballing Caroline and Rick and pays attention when Caroline says Rick has reserved the steam room for this afternoon. The girls all agree that a big hat, sunscreen and glasses are essential summer accessories. Aly asks if Wyatt and Quinn are truly gone. Hope says well they haven't left the city but they aren't at FC. She hopes they are not out of the business. Aly says she hopes not either. She's happy that Hope is with Liam, so Wyatt has his own problems now. Caroline says that is a big change in attitude. Aly smiles that her attitude has changed about a lot of things. By some prompting Aly reveals it is Oliver. Oliver sets up for the shoot but Maya keeps mouthing off about Caroline and Rick; how she is always pawing over him. She even says she is sick of watching Caroline leading her life \u0096 the Crown Princess of the Forrester dynasty. Oliver says if anyone deserves that title it is Aly. She says he needs to be careful, playing her like that in front of everyone. Oliver says he is not playing Aly. Her dad knows he is sincere and gave him his blessing. Maya says she is sorry. She knows she needs to be happy for him and all the Forrester's. They have so much \u0096 mansions, fancy cars and jets that can whisk them off to Paris any time they want. Most of all they have each other's backs and she could have had all of that. Oliver tells her not to screw this up. She is the spokesmodel for FC and that is a primo gig. Maya grouses that she could work her whole life and never be on the inside here. Just like Hope was grilling her a few minutes ago .there is only one way she and Oliver will get to the top of this company. Oliver senses that she is jealous when she keeps talking about Rick and how he opened up her life. Oliver reminds her of just what she has compared to where she came from. She knows but says she can't help but still dream about private chefs and assistants, houses all over the world, Beverly Hills, Palm Springs, the Riviera. Carter is a wonderful man but he will never be Rick. They will never be on the inside. But when Oliver gets with Aly he will be one of them.", "Rick is enjoying the steam room when someone else enters. He thinks it is Caroline but is surprised when he turns around from a neck massage and it is Maya. Aly offers to help Oliver when she sees Maya's shoot is over for now. Oliver wants to shoot Aly since she would make a beautiful model. She is flattered. Quinn tells Liam that he has no idea who he is fooling with. He can not shoo her away like some pest. He can not just dismiss her. He says that is just it. He doesn't have to deal with her anymore. She says it is too late for that. He doesn't like threats and she doesn't respond to bravado. She walks up close to him and says she won't let him stand in the way of her son's happiness. That necklace \u0096 symbol of family pride .his connection and bond to his father and to his brother. Yet he is willing to sabotage his life. She takes the sword and holds it in her hand and says remember her words \u0096 you live by the sword and you die by the sword. She takes it and gives Liam a poke in the neck. His eyes bulge out of his sockets."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Liam: You know empty threats don't scare me.", "Quinn: Try me, Liam.

He and Maya have a photo shoot today.", "Hope: Oh, yeah. I want to talk about that.", "Aly: And now that Wyatt and Quinn are gone, we can put the focus back on your message, where it belongs.", "Hope: And I-I think that Caroline's new collection is really going to showcase that.

Is there something wrong with my work?", "Hope: Oh, you know... this whole family has gone through a huge crisis, and you and carter have been really, really great, and the concern that you showed for Ridge was... really touching. I just want you to know that, you know, Ridge is back and he's okay, and so we can all breathe again. You know?", "Maya: Um, I-I'm not sure that I do.", "Hope: Well, I-I just feel like maybe in the last couple of photo shoots, you were, you know, understandably a little distracted. But Hope for the Future misses your trademark smile. I want to see it back. Is it -- is it just Ridge that g you, or -- or is it something else?", "Rick: Hey, there.

Is everything all right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Please. More excuses. I've heard them also has hope, and she's sick of them. That's why she ended things with you. Do you think it's just you? It's not just you. It's everything, Quinn. It's you.", "Liam: Oh, yeah. It's me. She chose me.", "Quinn: No. Because you poisoned her. All your whining about Ridge, blaming me for what happened, making it look like a pattern like there was some sort of problem with my family.", "Liam: Again, Ridge almost died because of you.", "Quinn: He's home. He's fine.", "Liam: Oh, you think that absolves you? That doesn't", "Quinn: Yeah, well, maybe it might if you would let hope think for herself. You wouldn't even let her talk to Wyatt. See, she wants to forgive him. She -- she realizes how t this is, how -- how good he was for her, and how valuable we are to the company.", "Liam: Oh, st-- oh, oh, please get this into your head. There is no way left for you and get into hope's life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: So, I always wear a hat when I go to the beach.", "Hope: Oh, yeah. So do I.", "Caroline: What about you, Aly? Do you always protect your skin?", "Aly: Always. Hat, glasses, sunscreen.", "Caroline: Essential summer accessories.", "Hope: I don't know. I mean, we just finished with the jesoso...", "Aly: So, it's true. Quinn and Wyatt gone?", "Hope: I mean, they haven't, like, , but, uh, yeah. Yeah, they are done at Forrester.", "Aly: You don't think they'll go out of business?", "Hope: I really hope not.", "Aly: Me, too. Don't get me wrong. I-I'm really happy you and Liam I just think Wyatt's got enough problems.", "Caroline: Well, that's a big change in attitude.", "Aly: My attitude's changed about a lot of things.", "Hope: Yeah, I've noticed that. What brought on all this good energy?", "Aly: Well, I've been kind of seeing somebody.", "Hope: Oh. You're dating.", "Aly: We kept it quiet. He -- I mean, he works here. Carols s a problem at Forrester.", "Aly: And he's older. Not a lot, but enough to make my dad nervous, but, you know, once he talked to Oliver, it was --", "Hope: Wait.", "Aly: ...Okay.", "Hope: Sorry. Uh... Oliver?", "Aly: Yeah.", "Hope: Wow. I mean -- I mean, how that been going on?", "Aly: We got coffee to celebrate getting his job back.", "Hope: Great. I mean, he's -- sweet guy. And -- and you're so sweet, and I guess that perfect for each other. Congratulations. .", "Hope: You're welcome.", "Aly: Well, now that you know, maybe we can all go out sometime or something.", "Caroline: Yes. You and Liam can invite us all to the beach. A lot. I mean, that sounds like an excellent summer to me.", "Hope: [Chuckles] Okay, deal.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: You know, I don't -- I don't know how he stands it -- her pawing at him all the time.", "Oliver: Who?", "Maya: Caroline. And how she was teasing Rick about the steam room like we're all working so hard and he's slacking off.", "Oliver: Are you okay?", "Maya: No. I'm not. I'm sick of watching Caroline Spencer live my life -- the crown princess of the Forrester dynasty.", "Oliver: Hey, if anyone should have that title, it should be Aly.", "Maya: Yeah, I saw you two looking at each other during the meeting. You need to be careful, Oliver -- playing her like that in front of everybody.", "Oliver: I'm not playing her. Her dad knows I'm sincere. Thorne gave us his blessing.", "Maya: That's just great. [Sighs] Sorry. I know I am supposed to be happy for you, for -- for everybody -- for Ridge and his family.", "Oliver: But...?", "Maya: The Forresters have so much -- mansions, fancy cars, jets that whisk them off to Paris whenever they want it. But most of all, they have each other's backs. And I could have had that.", "Oliver: You are a spokesmodel for Forrester creations. That's a primo gig. Don't screw it up, Maya.", "Maya: I could work my whole life and never be on the inside here. You heard the way that hope was grilling me at the meeting. There is only one way for people like you and me to make it to the top in this company.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Everybody gets their fair share of chances.", "Quinn: How many times did hope take you back?", "Liam: Yeah, I'm not playing that game with you.", "Quinn: I'm just saying -- we all know how understanding and forgiving she can be.", "Liam: Yes, and hope's forgiveness has to be earned.", "Quinn: Oh, okay. So what did you do? I-I want to know what you did to earn her admiration and her respect, because you've been given everything -- your name, your job. You haven't had to work for one single thing. But not Wyatt. Wyatt has been by her side every day at the office, working with her towards her success. He -- he gave her a priceless diamond. You -- you gave her a kitten and you wrote an article about puppies.", "Liam: Yeah, I did. And you still don't get it.", "Quinn: You're right. I don't get what she sees in you.", "Liam: It's because she has different values from you, Quinn. Everything's about dollar signs for you. Well, guess what -- hope doesn't think that way.", "Quinn: Neither does Wyatt. Wyatt didn't meet her in his father's high-rise office building or on rodeo drive. It was in the woods. Oh, yes, that's right. You remember the woods and why hope was there. I believe you left her there. You left hope alone, and Wyatt was there for her.", "Liam: Well, I guess I won't do that again.", "Quinn: Have you thought about how this will affect her line? Have you thought about how this is going to impact your brother?", "Liam: [Chuckles] Quinn, I assure you, if hope were concerned about her line, she wouldn't have fired him.", "Quinn: Maybe she did it to protect your fragile little ego. You know what? Hope doesn't want to ruin Wyatt's life. And you know what? I don't believe you want to, either. But that's exactly what's gonna happen if you take away his business and his family. Just talk to hope. Let Wyatt come back to Forrester.", "Liam: Not you, just him, huh?", "Quinn: My son didn't do anything wrong. It's not right that he's being punished, and if you and hope are so happy, what's the harm in letting them work together?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: Man, it's nice to see everybody in a good mood again.", "Rick: Hey, carter, have you seen these?", "Carter: Maya's last photo shoot?", "Rick: I don't know. There's something different about her. She used to exude that -- that Hope for the Future quality. Now it's like -- I don't know. It just looks like she's more intense.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Camera shutter clicking]", "Oliver: Maya. Do you need a break?", "Maya: No. No, let's just get this over with.", "Oliver: Hey, come on. We're supposed to be inspiring people.", "Maya: Girls like Aly?", "Oliver: Yes.", "Maya: And you're sure her dad's okay with you two dating?", "Oliver: I've been good for her.", "Maya: She's been good for you, too. I saw your new car in the lot.", "Oliver: Maya, I've needed that for a while.", "Maya: Yeah, but before you hooked up with Aly, you didn't feel you had enough job security to do it. That's changed now. Lucky you.", "Oliver: You're lucky, too, you know... compared to where you were.", "Maya: You know, when I came out of prison, all I wanted was my daughter. And she was already gone. And then I met Rick. He gave me something else to dream about. And he opened me up to a whole new world of things -- love and -- and family -- their wealth and their power, yes. You know, I can't help but still dream about that -- what it would be like. Private chef and an assistant, houses all over the world, and Beverly hills and palm springs, the French Riviera. I mean, Rick and I sure as heck wouldn't be living in Eric's guest house.", "Oliver: You're with carter now.", "Maya: Yes, and carter is a wonderful man. But he'll never be Rick. We will never be on the inside. You could be, Oliver. When everyone finds out that you're dating Aly, you'll be one of them.", "Oliver: Are you angry about me and Aly? Are you jealous?", "Maya: I am tired of watching people like Caroline get whatever they want. She was horrible to me. And she wins? I play by the rules, I follow my conscience, and look where that got me.", "Oliver: Your situation's not that bad.", "Maya: It could be a heck of a lot better.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Hope still cares about my son.", "Liam: And therefore, I should tell her to bring him back to the company?", "Quinn: She'll thank you for it.", "Liam: [Sighs] I can do that, Quinn. But I'm not going to. What, are you crazy?! [Chuckles]", "Quinn: Wyatt is your brother.", "Liam: Yes. Yes. He's my brother, Quinn, and someday, he'll be a part of our lives once he can accept my relationship with hope. But until then, I don't want him anywhere near her. Why would I?", "Quinn: Be careful, Liam. 'Cause your insecurities are showing.", "Liam: Yeah, it should. I don't trust him. You either.", "Quinn: I am not asking for myself.", "Liam: Yes, you are. You think -- you think that if you can get Wyatt back into Forrester, then he'll forgive you. That's why you're here. That's why you're so obsessed with getting Wyatt and hope back together. There's always an ulterior motive with you.", "Quinn: Not this time.", "Liam: You are crazy if you think I would do this for you. I let Wyatt move in with me. What happened? He hit on my fianc\u00e9e, he destroyed my relationship. I'm not gonna make that mistake again.", "Quinn: Oh, you're making an even bigger one this time.", "Liam: Let me -- let me tell you something. The only thing I'm gonna regret about today is that I didn't throw your ass out of here a whole lot sooner. Now, please, get on. Go. Shoo. I don't care. I don't care what you think. I don't care how unfair this feels to you. The only thing that I am concerned about is hope and my future with her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: [Sighs] [Exhales deeply] Changed your meeting? I was hoping that you'd show up because, oh, I could use a massage right now. [Sighs] Mm. Ooh, I like that. Maya!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: Where's Maya?", "Oliver: She left.", "Aly: In the middle of the shoot?", "Oliver: We just started.", "Aly: What happened?", "Oliver: Her mind was somewhere else.", "Aly: Well, I know how she feels.", "Oliver: Do you?", "Aly: I wasn't getting any work done upstairs.", "Oliver: Do you want to help me with mine?", "Aly: Sure. How? Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no.", "Oliver: It's all set up.", "Aly: Oliver, I'm not a model.", "Oliver: You're beautiful. Come on. It'll be fun.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: It didn't really suit you, you know? Dating two guys at the same time.", "Hope: Yeah. But I love them both.", "Caroline: Well, my cousins are pretty incredible men.", "Hope: They are. They really are, and, you know, I'm always gonna care about Wyatt, but I'm committed to Liam.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: You selfish coward.", "Liam: I thought I told you to go.", "Quinn: You are not getting away with this.", "Liam: Leave.", "Quinn: You can't shoo me away like a pest, just dismiss me. You have no idea who you're dealing with.", "Liam: No, that's the thing, Quinn. I don't have to deal with you.", "Quinn: It's too late for that. You don't like threats? I don't respond to bravado.", "Liam: It's my house.", "Quinn: It's my son. And I won't let you stand in the way of his happiness. That necklace -- it's a symbol of family, isn't it? Spencer pride. Your connection, your bond to your father, to your brother. Yet you are willing to sabotage his life. You remember my words. You live by the sword, you die by the sword.", "Liam: [Gasps, gurgles]"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjs357o41U"}
