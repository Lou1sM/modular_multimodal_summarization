        "Wyatt welcomes Caroline back to work. Caroline is surprised to hear that Ivy and Liam are married. Maya drives a hard bargain but tells Ridge that she will be glad to come back as his lead model at FC but she and Rick are a team and he has to accept him back too. Begrudgingly Ridge shakes Rick's hand and says he is in too, just not as CEO, that position is filled. Liam has to go when Quinn comes in and says she has work for Ivy. Quinn tries to give her advice how to treat her husband. Ivy says she has dual citizenship so she does not have to have Liam to stay in this country. They did not have to get married and she needs to tell him that. He did this to help her but if he doesn't love her like he does Steffy then it isn't enough. Rick tells Maya that she handled Ridge well. She was incredible and FC needs her. They can never find another lead model like her. He is blown away that Ridge came to see her but she stood up for Rick and got him back in too. Wyatt tells Steffy that he knows it is not the jewelry that is putting that look on her face. She says she still can not believe that Liam married Ivy. Right on cue, Liam comes in and says he needs to talk to Steffy. She asks Wyatt to give her a moment. Ridge returns and Caroline says he was gone a long time. He fills her in that Maya would only accept it as a package deal, Rick comes back too. Rick tells Maya that Ridge hates him so he could have rescinded the deal. No one is going to disrespect her. She says he made his choice and so did she. He says she did not have to do this for him. She says Ridge gave her a second chance and she thinks he deserves one too. He wants to take this upstairs.",
        "Ivy tells Quinn that her marriage was a huge mistake. She only wants Liam to be happy. He loves Steffy. Quinn tries to talk her out of this that Liam did marry her without asking too many questions so he wanted to regardless of Steffy. Wyatt comes in and Quinn dismisses Ivy to go get some work started for production. Steffy is cool towards Liam. She asks if he has some work concerns to discuss. He asks her not to shut him out. He still loves her and he knows she still loves him. Ivy is listening outside the door when Liam says he does not want to lose Steffy. She says he can kick himself as long as he wants. How dare he ask her for anything. He married Ivy for as long as they live. He says no, only long enough until she got her citizenship. She reminds him she came running over to take a trip down memory lane so why didn't he tell her the minute she came through the door but waited until he told her that he married Ivy. She says again she can not do this. Ivy returns and tells Quinn that she just overheard Liam says he loved Steffy. He does not want this marriage and she is not going to trap him. Quinn tries to convince him that her love and commitment for Liam is real and she was desperate at the time. Ivy still says she can not do this. This is not who she is. She has to tell Liam that he does not have to be married to her. Upstairs Rick and Maya continue to kiss and he guides her to the bed. They say how much they missed each other."

        "Ridge: I came here to offer you your job back.",
        "Maya: I am happy to help you, Ridge. I'll return to Forrester and explain to everyone that I wasn't fired for being a transgender woman.",
        "Ridge: Because you weren't.",
        "Maya: And I'll make that clear... if Rick comes, too. Do we have a deal?",

        "Caroline: Well, this isn't anything you would expect from Ivy.",
        "Steffy: Wow. She's just been full of surprises lately.",
        "Quinn: Actually, Ivy and I worked on that together. We were inspired by your courage and strength.",

        "Caroline: Aw, thank you!",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: So, where is Miss Ivy? I haven't seen her today.",
        "Quinn: She's around here somewhere, probably with her husband.",
        "Caroline: I'm sorry. Her what? Husband? Are we talking about my cousin? Liam and Ivy are married?",
        "Steffy: Hard to believe, I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Well, I think it's going to surprise a few people.",
        "Liam: Yeah, are you, um -- are you worried that immigration might question them?",
        "Ivy: No. No, immigration won't be a problem anymore.",
        "Liam: Oh. Well, yeah, right. 'Cause the wedding worked, and you can't be deported now.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Nope, can't be deported.",
        "Liam: All right, well... you can relax, right? Nothing to worry about.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Well, Rick can't have his old job back. It's occupied.",
        "Maya: He's earned a place in the company.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Can I tell you? I... I get it. I do. And when you knocked down Spencer... happiest day of my life. So, yes, I think we can use you in Paris.",
        "Maya: [Scoffs] No, not in Paris.",
        "Rick: I think I can oversee international from here.",
        "Maya: Yeah, you see, Rick and I are a team. He took the company to heights its never seen before. You want to take it higher, you need him on board.",
        "Ridge: Fine. It's a deal.",
        "Rick: Let's hope all your decisions as C.E.O. are as good as this one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Why would he do that?",
        "Quinn: Liam cares about Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: And he didn't want her to be deported.",
        "Caroline: Okay, yeah, but they're gonna have to live together. I mean, immigration's gonna check in on them.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, for years.",
        "Quinn: You know what? Maybe we shouldn't tire Caroline out on her first day back, and we should just focus on the work.",
        "Steffy: That's a good idea.",
        "Quinn: I'm gonna go find Ivy, and, um... we'll get started on these suggestions, okay?",
        "Steffy: Great. Wonderful. Thank you.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Caroline: Steffy... I am -- I am so sorry. I mean, you have to be so upset. You must be --",
        "Wyatt: She's been through this before with my brother.",
        "Steffy: It's fine, guys. I just won't put myself through that again.",
        "Wyatt: Pick the right guy and you won't have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I don't want our wedding to be a distraction. You know, Caroline is back, and Steffy is president.",
        "Liam: Yeah, there's a lot going on, huh?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Actually, I just got a memo from Steffy.",
        "Liam: What did she want?",
        "Quinn: Hey. Oh, there you are.",
        "Ivy: Oh! I totally lost track of time.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, don't worry about it. I took notes. Liam.",
        "Liam: Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Well, I hope you don't mind, but I have some work to go over with your wife.",
        "Liam: Oh, I mind. But, hey, it's work, so, I'll see you later.",
        "Quinn: No kiss goodbye for your husband? Come on! You can't miss these opportunities. If you want to make this marriage work, you have to reel him back in.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, this marriage shouldn't have happened. I have dual citizenship. I don't need to be married to stay in this country.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: You were gone a long time.",
        "Ridge: Longer than I wanted. Hi.",
        "Caroline: Unh-unh! Sneaky. You've been keeping stuff from me. You didn't tell me that Liam and Ivy are married.",
        "Ridge: Kind of figured Liam would tell you himself. There is some breaking news, though, if you're interested.",
        "Caroline: You convinced Maya to come back to work.",
        "Ridge: Made an offer.",
        "Caroline: And she took it?",
        "Ridge: And she countered.",
        "Caroline: But she does want her job back.",
        "Ridge: Under one condition.",

        "Ridge: No boyfriend, no deal.",
        "Caroline: What'd you say?",
        "Ridge: Ricky's coming back.",
        "Caroline: Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Modeling might just be the first step for you in this business. You handled Ridge like a seasoned executive.",
        "Maya: I just... hope he doesn't think I was ungrateful.",
        "Rick: Are you kidding me? You were -- you were incredible.",
        "Maya: Never in a million years did I think he would want me back.",
        "Rick: Forrester needs you.",
        "Maya: People were calling the office?",
        "Rick: Yeah, they've been posting their support online. I saw hashtags -- you have hashtags!",
        "Maya: But he could've asked me to write a statement explaining why I left.",
        "Rick: No, no, no, that's not good enough.",
        "Maya: You don't think people would've believed him.",
        "Rick: Forrester could never find another lead model like you.",
        "Maya: Or an executive like you.",
        "Rick: You know, you didn't have to do that for me.",
        "Maya: Are you upset I did?",
        "Rick: No. No, I'm blown away. Ridge came to see you. That was your moment. You didn't have to share that with anyone.",
        "Maya: You would still be C.E.O. if it weren't for me.",
        "Rick: I wouldn't want to be C.E.O. without you.",
        "Maya: And I wouldn't want to be at Forrester, or anywhere else, without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hey, we need to get these changes done.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, I can't -- I can't concentrate. I have to tell Liam the truth.",
        "Quinn: He made his own decisions.",
        "Ivy: He did it to save me, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Which should show you how much he cares about you.",
        "Ivy: I didn't need saving, because I can't be deported.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Look, honey, there was an error.",
        "Ivy: It's nothing for you to feel guilty about.",
        "Ivy: Okay. Well, Liam deserves to know that.",
        "Quinn: Would he want to?",
        "Ivy: We didn't have to get married.",
        "Quinn: So, he torpedoed any chance he has to be with Steffy. How is that gonna make him feel?",
        "Ivy: I can't keep lying to him.",
        "Quinn: It might be the most compassionate thing you can do.",
        "Ivy: No, he did this to help me, but if he doesn't love me, well, then --",
        "Quinn: He does love you.",
        "Ivy: No. Not like he loves Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Thinking about Liam.",
        "Steffy: You could at least make it sound like a question.",
        "Wyatt: I know our jewelry didn't put that look on your face.",
        "Steffy: No, the jewelry is very impressive...",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Steffy: ...As much as I hate to say it.",
        "Wyatt: Hate to say what?",
        "Steffy: Oh, God. Complimenting Ivy's gonna be pretty hard for a while.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. So compliment me, and I'll relay the message.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] I still can't believe Liam married her. How could he do that?",
        "Wyatt: You know how.",
        "Liam: Just give me the chance. I'll explain it again.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, great. You got anything new to say?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Kind of need to speak to Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Surprise, surprise.",
        "Steffy: Give us a minute.",
        "Wyatt: Just go give these notes to my mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: The four of us back together again. How much fun.",
        "Ridge: Give me that. Maya made it a package deal -- take it or leave it.",
        "Caroline: See, you never underestimate Maya Avant. If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times.",
        "Ridge: Yeah -- hey! Wouldn't want to play poker with her, that's for sure.",
        "Caroline: You think she's bluffing?",
        "Ridge: No, I think she's all-in with that guy.",
        "Caroline: She would've turned down the job.",
        "Ridge: Yes, I think she would. And can I tell you something else? I'm impressed. Just the loyalty she has for that man.",
        "Caroline: Do you think they're back together?",
        "Ridge: If they weren't, they will be tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: What you did for me, how you stood up for me, I --",
        "Maya: You did the same for me.",
        "Rick: No, no, Ridge hates me. He could've rescinded his offer.",
        "Maya: But he didn't. He wouldn't.",
        "Rick: I know how much modeling means to you.",
        "Maya: Not nearly as much as Forrester means to you.",
        "Rick: Yeah, it was something different, though. Bill disrespected you. I reacted. I wasn't even thinking about my job when I punched him.",
        "Maya: I know. You were thinking about me.",
        "Liam: And all the other jerks who disrespected you or bullied you in your life.",
        "Maya: You made a choice. So did I.",
        "Rick: Ridge almost seemed as surprised as Bill.",
        "Maya: You seemed pretty surprised yourself.",
        "Rick: What I'm saying is, you didn't have to do that for me.",
        "Maya: And that's exactly why I had to do it. Ridge was willing to give me a second chance. I think you deserve one, too.",
        "Rick: I guess we have all that much more to celebrate.",
        "Maya: Let the party continue.",
        "Rick: Actually, I was thinking about taking it upstairs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You love Liam.",
        "Ivy: Yes, and I want him to be happy.",
        "Quinn: Then make that your mission as his wife.",
        "Ivy: Our wedding was a huge mistake, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: See, I think everything happens for a reason.",
        "Ivy: Liam and I agreed -- this marriage wasn't real and nothing would change between us.",
        "Quinn: Nothing has to change if you let it be.",
        "Ivy: But he doesn't love me. He loves Steffy.",
        "Quinn: Not enough to keep from marrying you. He knew you guys were gonna have to live together.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, he didn't know how long.",
        "Quinn: He didn't know. He didn't care. He said yes without asking, and that was very significant to Steffy. That's why she broke things off with him. It's not because he married you. It's because he did it without thinking. Her feelings didn't come into his equation at all.",
        "Ivy: But it's because I didn't give him time to do that.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: Hey.",
        "Quinn: Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Everything all right? What's going on?",
        "Quinn: No, everything is fine. It's fine. I was, um -- I was complimenting Ivy here on the changes she made to this piece. You know what? You should bring this to Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, she just gave me some notes on these pieces, too.",
        "Quinn: All right. Well, bring the notes, as well, and then have her clarify anything that isn't clear.",
        "Ivy: You want me to do that right now?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. We need to get this collection into production as soon as possible.",
        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: She seemed upset.",
        "Quinn: She and Steffy are gonna have to learn to work together at some point.",
        "Wyatt: Mm. Let me guess. Liam's not the only one having second thoughts about this marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I don't want to talk about this.",
        "Liam: You were talking to Wyatt.",
        "Steffy: Not with you.",
        "Liam: You wanted to know why I did it. Right?",
        "Steffy: No, it's obvious. And I guess when I think about it, the rest of it is, too.",
        "Liam: Ivy was in trouble, Steffy. I had to do something.",
        "Steffy: Okay. So you hire a lawyer. You get your father to pull some strings. You don't get married. Now, do you have something work-related to discuss?",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Steffy: Work. That is my main focus.",
        "Liam: Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't shut me out completely, okay? Yes, we have to work together, but I still love you, Steffy, and I know you love me. I need you to know something. I don't want to lose you.",
        "Steffy: What do you mean you don't want to lose me?",
        "Liam: It doesn't have to be over between us.",
        "Steffy: You can kick yourself for as long as you want, but I am done. I have wasted too much time obsessing over what might have been, and I'm not gonna do it anymore.",
        "Liam: That is not what I'm asking you for.",
        "Steffy: How dare you ask me for anything! I have opened myself up to you, Liam.",
        "Liam: Yes, Steffy, I opened myself up to you, too. I meant every word of what I said.",
        "Steffy: Oh, how about the words you said to Ivy -- \"For better or worse, for as long as you both shall live\"?",
        "Liam: No, no, not for as long as we both shall live. It's until she gets her citizenship.",
        "Steffy: Which could take years.",
        "Liam: Or it could not.",
        "Steffy: It's too late. You said that you were gonna go talk to her and tell her how you felt about me. I waited for you all day, Liam -- waited for you to text me. And then you finally did, and you ask me to come over, and I was so excited. Oh, my God. I spent hours putting those photos together, going shopping, trying to get parachute men and French fries, putting together this ridiculous walk down memory lane.",
        "Liam: It wasn't ridiculous. I loved it.",
        "Steffy: Why didn't you just say something right when I walked in? That's why you asked me over -- to tell me what happened, that you and Ivy got married.",
        "Liam: I -- I wanted to. I tried. I...couldn't.",
        "Steffy: That makes two of us, 'cause I can't do this, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hey. Did you see Steffy?",
        "Ivy: Yep. She was with Liam. He was telling her how much he's in love with her again.",
        "Quinn: I hope you dragged him out of there by his ear.",
        "Ivy: I didn't. They didn't even see me.",
        "Quinn: Ivy, Liam is your husband. You have every right to feel territorial.",
        "Ivy: He doesn't want this, Quinn. He doesn't want this. I'm not gonna trap a man in a relationship.",
        "Quinn: You asked Liam to help you.",
        "Ivy: Which I really didn't need.",
        "Quinn: Which you didn't know at the time. You were desperate. Honey, I was there. I saw it. I mean, you were at your wit's end. That wasn't an act, and this isn't an act right now. Your feelings for Liam are real. Your devotion to him, your commitment to him, the future you want with him can still happen.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, as long as I never tell him the truth.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: I -- I can't do this, Quinn. This isn't who I am. It's not gonna make either of us happy. I have to tell Liam that he doesn't have to be married to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: You are so sneaky.",
        "Ridge: You enjoy your party?",
        "Caroline: I did.",
        "Ridge: Sorry we had to cut it short.",
        "Caroline: That's okay. You had things to do.",
        "Ridge: Rather would've been here with you.",
        "Caroline: I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. You know, you helping me in my recovery and encouraging me to get back to work.",
        "Ridge: It's being selfish. It's no fun without you here.",
        "Caroline: I know.",
        "Ridge: Yeah? Do you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Feels like another lifetime ago... before everything went wrong.",
        "Rick: It's all right now.",
        "Maya: I missed you so much, Rick.",
