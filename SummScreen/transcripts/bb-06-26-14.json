        "Wyatt knocks on the door and Liam tells him to come on in. He needs to talk to him about his mother. Wyatt grumbles that he called him all the way over here for that. Liam says he always knew his charming mother was unhinged but today took it up a notch. Liam says Quinn is certifiably crazy. Wyatt asks what can he do; she is his mother. She is overbearing at times and protective but she is not crazy. That's going a little too far. Liam shows him a spot on his neck and says no, this is too far. Wyatt asks if that is a freckle or a pimple. He doesn't know what he is looking at. Liam grouses that Wyatt's lunatic mother did that. She took his necklace and stabbed him like she did Bill. He says she looked him right in the eye and said live by the sword, die by the sword. That's a death threat. Wyatt tells him to come on, man, he's overreacting now. Liam says he does not know any other way to take it. He doesn't now that much about his mom but what he does is not good. Wyatt doesn't know what Liam expects him to do. If Liam expects him to talk to her, well he's not exactly talking to her at the moment. Liam says he is not asking Wyatt to fight his battles but just let him know just how dangerous she is. Wyatt says that is ridiculous. She interferes and does go to extremes and does walk a line but she is not a danger to anyone. Liam says she is a total liability to everyone he knows. While Quinn is working away at her factory with head shield and eye goggles, Deacon slips in and gets her attention. He tells her not to stop. He knows better than to get between a woman and her blowtorch. She asks him if he always walks into a place uninvited. He says he lives here. She says crashing here only temporarily. Then she says it is a welder, not a blowtorch because it can take a lot of heat. She says she went to see Liam today to get him to back off of Wyatt, but nope, he's going to be a bad boy. Deacon asks if she gave him a hard time. She says it took a little extra poking and prodding but she tried to be gentle. Deacon says he went to see Hope again and Wyatt called while he was there. She definitely cares about him. Quinn says of course she does; she is in love with him. Deacon says maybe but she is committed to Liam. She's a grown woman so what can Deacon do to change her mind. Quinn says all he has to do is convince Hope that Quinn was the one who screwed up, not Wyatt. They belong to together. It is what Wyatt wants, even Hope too. And it means more than life itself to Quinn. She says all she ever wanted to be was a good mother. Deacon says same with him ..just a good father. So what is wrong with them? He says his list is too damn long but he can tell her that she needs to loosen that leash from sonny boy. She scoffs that at least she was around and he says point well taken. She says there is only one thing standing in her way and that is that nasty little gnat named Liam. She hates people like that, a do gooder, holier than thou. He drives her nuts. Deacon says short drive. She says she is going to kill Liam. He chuckles and she accuses him of not believing her. He gets serious and asks how she is going to do it \u0096 drive over him, poison him, or shoot him. They both ask each other that question \u0096 have they ever killed anyone. She says do not underestimate a mother's love .the sacrifices she makes for her children no matter the cost. Oliver tries to talk Aly into modeling; she has what it takes. She says he is very sweet but Maya is the model around here, not her. He says her face should be on the cover of all the magazines. And Maya is not exactly working out now so Aly should take her place. Hope walks in and asks about Maya and they tell her that she bolted. Hope thinks she has been acting a little weird lately.",
        "Rick is very surprised to turn around and see it is Maya in the steam room. She tells him it is okay. It is not like it is their first time together like this. He chuckles nervously and says that was a long time ago. She says not so much. She still remembers what they had and maybe it is still there. It's not such a crazy idea. He reminds her that he is married to Caroline and she is engaged to Carter. She admits that Carter is a wonderful man but she keeps postponing the wedding because her feelings for Rick never went away. She did not appreciate what they had at the time But she is realizing it now. She knows he is married and she has Carter but it's not too late for either of them. Rick says he did enjoy his time with Maya. She reminds him they were in love and that scared her at first, coming from two different worlds. Then she realized his strength was his family and it felt good when she saw them all rally around Ridge celebrating him coming home. That love and that loyalty and she could have been part of that. She almost had it and let it slip away. Then Caroline fought hard and wasn't always fair and she won. But she can't blame her for everything. Maya says she gave up too easily but now she wants a second chance. Caroline can not make him happy for a lifetime like she can. Rick tells her again what a great man Carter is and dying to marry Maya. He loves her and Rick loves Caroline. Hope interrupts Liam and Wyatt and wants to know what they are talking about. Liam shows her his little boo boo by Quinn. Wyatt says it was just a little poke but he will apologize for what his mother did. Hope says that is not necessary as he did nothing wrong. Wyatt says but he is paying the price. He lost his job, he lost Hope and there is no greater punishment than that. He leaves them alone where Liam plays it up big time and Hope kisses his neck making it all better. He says Quinn needs to be locked up somewhere. Hope says at least now they know what she is capable of and she is sorry she did not see it sooner. Liam says at least it is now officially over and they don't have to have her in their lives anymore. Hope says Quinn's final show is over. That was her finale. Meanwhile Quinn is still working on something in the factory. Wyatt goes home and is barely there when Deacon shows up. Wyatt does not know him and tries to blow off this salesman or whoever he is. Deacon says he thinks he will want to think twice before slamming that door in his face. He will want to talk to him once he knows who he is."

        "Rick: [Chuckles nervously] That was, uh -- that was a long time ago.",
        "Maya: Mm, hasn't been that long. I still remember what we had together. Maybe it's still there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: How about, instead, I take some pictures of you?",
        "Oliver: No. No. Give me that. Give me that.",
        "Aly: Give it to me. Give it to me.",
        "Oliver: [Chuckling] Stop. There's only enough room in this relationship for one model, and that's you.",
        "Hope: Oh. Sorry. God, I'm sorry.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles] It's okay.",
        "Hope: Uh, where's Maya? I heard the shoot didn't go well.",
        "Oliver: She took off.",
        "Hope: Oh, my -- ugh! Okay, is it just me, or has she been acting kind of weird lately?",

        "Maya: And Carter is a wonderful man...but why do you think I keep postponing the wedding, Rick? Because my feelings for you never went away. I didn't appreciate what we had at the time, but I'm realizing it now. Look, I know you're married, but you haven't started a family yet, and I'm not married to Carter. It's not too late for us.",

        "Quinn: Do you always walk into places uninvited?",
        "Deacon: I live here.",
        "Quinn: Crashing here -- temporarily.",
        "Deacon: You, uh, always make jewelry using a blowtorch?",
        "Quinn: It's a welder, not a blowtorch, and, uh, how do you think we melt metal? It takes a lot of heat.",
        "Deacon: I bet it does.",
        "Quinn: How old are you? Anyway, I, uh -- I-I went to go see Liam, tried to convince him to back off of Wyatt. Nope, not gonna happen. Liam is being a very, very bad boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Your mom is certifiably crazy.",
        "Wyatt: What do you want me to do, Liam? She's my mother. Is she protective? Yes. Is she overbearing at times? Absolutely. I'll be the first one to admit that. But she's not crazy, okay? That's going a little too far.",
        "Liam: No, no, no. No. No. This -- this is going too far.",
        "Wyatt: A freckle?",
        "Liam: Look.",
        "Wyatt: Is that a pimple? I don't know what I'm looking at here.",
        "Liam: This is your mom, dude. Your lunatic mother just did this to me.",
        "Wyatt: How?",
        "Liam: How? She took my sword, and she stabbed me with it like she did with dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Maybe Maya's just having a bad day. I'm sure she'll come back and do a great job.",
        "Hope: Yeah, it's -- it's just she knows we're in a time crunch. The Hope for the Future billboards have to go up in less than a month.",
        "Oliver: We'll get it done.",
        "Hope: Not if Maya keeps storming out of photo shoots.",
        "Aly: It was just this one time.",
        "Hope: I just feel like she's been off her game lately.",
        "Aly: So Maya has an off day here and there -- we all do. But she's committed to this company. I mean, nothing is more important to Maya than being part of Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I enjoyed our time together. I really did.",
        "Maya: We were in love, Rick. We were -- two people from completely different worlds, and your world scared me at first, but then I came to really know who you are, to love everything about you -- your strength, your family, that Forrester pride.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: It was amazing to watch everyone come home and rally around Ridge, celebrate him coming home.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Yeah, you know, we really get together when we need each other. You know, we -- we stick together.",
        "Maya: That love -- that loyalty -- it was an honor to be a part of it, and it made me realize how much I miss you and how badly I want to be a part of a family like yours. I almost had it, and I let it slip away.",
        "Rick: So many things happened back then, Maya.",
        "Maya: I wasn't the only one who wanted you. Caroline fought hard, and she didn't always play fair.",
        "Rick: Mm. I remember.",
        "Maya: She did her manipulations, and she got the best of me. But I can't blame her for everything. I gave up too easily, and I regret that. I want another chance, Rick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: So, uh, you went to go see Liam. Did you give him a hard time?",
        "Quinn: Oh, well, it takes a little extra poking and prodding to get through to Liam, but, um, I tried to be gentle.",
        "Deacon: I went to go see Hope again.",
        "Quinn: You're just telling me this now? What did she say?",
        "Deacon: Wyatt called while I was there.",
        "Quinn: And...?",
        "Deacon: She definitely cares about him.",
        "Quinn: Of course she does. She is in love with him.",
        "Deacon: I don't know about that. Hope says that she's committed to Liam.",
        "Quinn: Ugh. Ugh! I don't know what she sees in that guy. You have to do something.",
        "Deacon: What do you want me to do? She's a grown woman.",
        "Quinn: You agreed to help her realize that I'm the one who screwed up -- that she's angry with me, not Wyatt.",
        "Deacon: Honey, there's only so much that even I can do.",
        "Quinn: Listen to me. Hope and Wyatt belong together. It's what Wyatt wants. Deep down, it's what Hope wants.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: And, more importantly, it's what I want more than life itself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Gift from your mother right here.",
        "Wyatt: Well, yeah, she does that.",
        "Liam: \"She does that\"?! What?!",
        "Wyatt: It's kind of her thing, clearly. I mean, she's never done it to me.",
        "Liam: Oh, my God, you are just as crazy as she is.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I'm crazy? Oh, okay. Thanks.",
        "Liam: She stabbed me, dude. She looked me in the eye, she said, \"live by the sword, die by the sword,\" and then she stabbed me. If that's not a death threat --",
        "Wyatt: A death threat? Come on, man. Now you're overreacting here.",
        "Liam: How else am I supposed to take that? I don't know much about your mom, but what I do know is not good.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so what do you want me to do? You want me to talk to her? Well, guess what -- I'm not exactly talking to her right now.",
        "Liam: I'm not asking you to fight my battles for me, okay?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God.",
        "Liam: Listen. Listen. I just need you to answer a question. And, for God's sake, be honest. How dangerous is your mom, really?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: It's cool of you to stick up for Maya.",
        "Aly: I like Maya. I hope she doesn't get into trouble.",
        "Oliver: I think she already is.",
        "Aly: By the way, thanks for not putting me on the spot with Hope.",
        "Oliver: No problem. Now, about that modeling career...",
        "Aly: Very funny.",
        "Oliver: I'm serious, Aly. I know a good model when I see her. If anyone should be the face of Hope for the Future, it should be you.",
        "Aly: Me?",
        "Oliver: Why not?",
        "Aly: Because I'm not a model.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. You are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Look, Maya --",
        "Maya: I-I'm sure that this is coming as a little bit of a shock to you.",
        "Rick: [Scoffs]",
        "Maya: But I have to tell you how I feel. I still want you, Rick. And Caroline -- I mean, she's Caroline. She's not gonna make you happy -- not for a lifetime -- not the way I can.",
        "Rick: Maya, you are an incredible woman. You are stunning and intelligent, but I am committed to Caroline. I can't see my life without her.",
        "Maya: You don't have any feelings for me?",
        "Rick: Of course I have feelings for you. I-I care about you. I care about you as a friend and as a co-worker.",
        "Maya: Rick, we could be so good together. I mean, we would be different. We would take this company to the next level -- have the kind of success that you've only dreamed about.",
        "Rick: Look, I think we've all been a little bit emotional -- almost losing Ridge, all of us coming together. You know, I think it could mess with your head. Don't you think that this is probably where that's coming from?",
        "Maya: No, Rick. I mean it.",
        "Rick: Carter is a great man, and he can't wait to marry you. He loves you so much. And I love Caroline.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: All I've ever wanted was to be a good mother.",
        "Deacon: I hear you. Wanted to be a good father.",
        "Quinn: What the hell is wrong with us?",
        "Deacon: Well, with me, the list is just too damn long, but I can tell you what's wrong with you. You need to loosen up on the leash with sonny boy.",
        "Quinn: Is that so?",
        "Deacon: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: Well, at least I was around.",
        "Deacon: Point well taken.",
        "Quinn: Only one thing standing in my way -- one thing impeding my son's joy. It's a nasty little gnat named Liam -- do-gooder, holier-than-thou. I hate people like that. Drives me nuts!",
        "Deacon: Short drive.",
        "Quinn: I'm gonna kill him.",
        "Deacon: Who? Liam? [Chuckles] Yeah, right.",
        "Quinn: Why do you assume I'm joking?",
        "Deacon: Okay, all right, you know what? Let's do this. Let's -- let's plot Liam's murder. So, how you gonna do it, tough guy? What are you gonna do? You gonna drive -- drive over him? You gonna poison him? Maybe you want to shoot him. Bam!",
        "Quinn: Have you ever killed anyone, Deacon?",
        "Deacon: Have you?",
        "Quinn: Never underestimate a mother's love...the sacrifices that she's willing to make for her children... no matter the cost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Is my mother dangerous?",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: No. That's ridiculous. Yes, she interferes and goes to extremes, but --",
        "Liam: Last time, she almost got Ridge killed.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, she walks a line sometimes, but she's not a danger to anyone.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, she's a total liability to you and everyone you know.",

        "Wyatt: Great.",
        "Hope: Um, is everything okay here?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, he's -- he's fine. It's nothing. It's --",
        "Liam: Quinn came to visit me.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: Yeah?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Hey, you know, um -- you know that one time that she stabbed my dad in the neck with his own sword? Next victim.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God! What?",
        "Liam: Aah!",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. Are you okay?",
        "Wyatt: It was more of a poke, really, but she didn't... look, fine. I apologize. My mother crossed a line again, and I wish she hadn't.",
        "Hope: You shouldn't be the one apologizing. You didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Wyatt: No, but I'm definitely paying the price for it. I've lost my job, and I've lost you, and there's -- there's no greater punishment than that.",

        "Oliver: For someone who's not a model, you look like you're having fun in those pictures.",
        "Aly: I always have fun when I'm with you.",
        "Oliver: Modeling. You're into it. So relaxed, carefree.",
        "Aly: Well, that's because you're an amazing photographer and because this was just for kicks. I mean, if I thought that any of these pictures would end up in a magazine, I'd be freaking out right now.",
        "Oliver: Why couldn't that pretty face be in magazines all over the world?",
        "Aly: There you go, getting ahead of yourself again.",
        "Oliver: Aly, you are the Hope for the Future message. You represent everything the line stands for. You're a young, beautiful woman always true to who you are. But Maya's not working out. You -- you should take her place.",

        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Can I help you?",
        "Deacon: You got a minute?",
        "Wyatt: Look, whatever you're selling, I'm not interested, all right?",
        "Deacon: Do I look like I'm selling anything?",
        "Wyatt: Dude, you are trespassing, and I am not in the mood, so goodbye and good luck.",
        "Deacon: I'll tell you what -- I think you're gonna want to think twice before slamming that door in my face. As a matter of fact, I think you're gonna want to meet with me.",
        "Wyatt: Why? Who are you?",
        "Deacon: Name's Deacon. Yeah, that Deacon. Hope's dad. Nice to meet you, too.",

        "Quinn: Don't you ever pull something like that again.",
        "Liam: Whoa! Hey! Listen to me. Wyatt will never end up with Hope. Do you understand me? Never.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt and I may not be squeaky-clean, but when you have had to work as long and as hard as we have, it is hard to be. But I'm not gonna apologize for that, and I'm not gonna let you judge us for it, either.",
        "Quinn: I did it for me. I did it for your father. Do you know Brooke's history with men?",
        "Liam: Brooke's? Are you freaking kidding me right now? I would take Brooke over you any day of the week, Quinn. I would take any woman over you. You are a vile, manipulative, evil bitch! Aah!",

        "Quinn: Liam.",

        "Hope: [Chuckles] I'm sorry. I can't believe she did this to you. This is ridiculous. Liam, she -- she literally stabbed you. She's out of control.",
        "Liam: I know. She needs to be locked up somewhere.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] I mean, at least now we know what she's capable of, and I-I'm so sorry that I didn't see it sooner.",
        "Liam: Whatever. At least she's officially out of our lives, and we don't have to deal with her any longer.",
        "Hope: Mm. Hopefully, the show is over, and this was Quinn's grand finale.",
