        "Maya asks Rick if he is sure this is what he wants. Most definitely he replies. Caroline thanks Ridge for taking such good care of her and helping her at work. She is going to have to think of a way to thank him. Steffy tells Liam that Immigration is going to be watching him and Ivy for weeks or months .and she knows he is trying to help her but he destroyed everything they had going in the process. She reminds him that she loves him but he is married and they have to accept that. Nothing is going to happen between them. Ivy tells Quinn that she can not do this. She does not need Liam's help. She had dual citizenship although Liam does not know this yet. She is tired of talking, it is time for honest action now. She walks in on Steffy talking to Liam and tells him she has to talk to him now. When Steffy walks away, Ivy tells Liam there is a way he and Steffy can be together. Wyatt walks in and sees his mother all snippy and riled up. Liam tells Ivy that all they did kept her from being deported. She says that was not necessary. She will always love him for saving her life and being willing to help her. He's that kind of guy willing to help others. He says he will never regret that. She knows he and Steffy have history together and he loves her. She is a part of him. He says he will not leave her until she has dual citizenship. She says that is just it; she already does and can not be deported.",
        "Caroline tells Ridge that she can design at home but it does not feel right here at the office. He stands before her just far enough away and asks her to come to him. With one boot on and without the walker she does, twice and then gives him a big hug. When they kiss she pushes him even further back and hobbles to him unassisted again. She attempts one more time to do some designing. He tells her one line at a time and he stands near to guide her. He says it will take some time but she will get it again. Rick tells Maya that he is grateful. He loves her and it is their journey. Slowly he undresses her and they lie on the bed and make love like old times. She says she could not be more in love with him than right now. He says there is no one like her. He is one lucky guy. Liam is shocked when Ivy tells her that she can not be deported. It was a huge mistake. She is legal and it means he is free. He did not have to marry her. One day she wanted to be but not like this with his constant desire to be with someone else. He realizes she did not have to tell him this but did. She says he deserved to know the truth and now he does. She can draw up annulment papers. She will not stop him from having a life with Steffy if that is what he wants. He hugs her. Wyatt tells his mom that Liam is out of the picture so what could be so bad. Ivy comes in and explains that Liam is now free to be with Steffy since he does not have to be married to her now. Liam finds Steffy on the Roof Top and she asks if he is stalking her. She doesn't want to hear anything from him. He asks if he can say something. She says no as it will only make it worse. She can not handle it every time she sees him and Ivy. He stops her from going and says this might make a difference. He says the damsel in distress needed help but she is the other woman. He tells her the marriage is over. There was a mistake and Ivy had dual citizenship and they did not have to get married. Can she ever forgive him? They hug."

        "Liam: Yeah, well, it's temporary.",
        "Steffy: I know you want to believe that, but you're not the first person to help someone dodge deportation. It isn't that easy.",
        "Liam: You think -- you think we didn't take precautions?",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. They're gonna be watching you, Liam -- you and Ivy -- every move that you make. It could take months, maybe years, to find your way out of this. Look, I know you were trying to help her... but you destroyed anything we had in the process.",

        "Ivy: But it turns out I didn't need his help. I have dual citizenship. He just doesn't know that yet. All that's gonna change. I have to tell him.",
        "Quinn: Ivy -- Ivy, please! Just wait. Just...think about this.",

        "Liam: I know. I was just...trying to make sure we both understood.",
        "Ivy: We did. It was no strings attached. Just two signatures on a piece of paper. It was a marriage license.",
        "Liam: And it kept you from being deported.",
        "Ivy: It just -- it wasn't necessary.",
        "Liam: Yes, it was. Ivy -- Ivy, yes, it was! I wasn't gonna let them do that to you. Your -- your family, your life, your career -- everything is here.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Yeah, everything. And you were willing to help me. I'm always gonna love you for that, Liam. I am so grateful. You've literally -- you've saved my life. I mean, no one's done anything like that for me.",
        "Liam: Well, I don't regret it.",
        "Ivy: Well, I-I know. I know you don't. I guess that's just the kind of man that you are. You know, you're -- you're loyal, and you're -- you're strong, and you're someone that everyone can depend on. But these feelings you have for Steffy -- it just really complicates things.",
        "Liam: I know, but it's not -- it's not really her fault.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] I know that. I know that. I know. You -- you guys have a history together. But you love her, Liam. I mean, when you love someone, they become a part of who you are.",
        "Liam: Hey, you were there for me, and I'm gonna be there for you, okay? So we stay married until you have your citizenship. I'm not -- I'm not gonna leave you out to dry.",

        "Liam: Hold -- wait a second. Who -- who told -- why do you think this?",
        "Ivy: An immigration officer visited me and confirmed everything. I'm legal, which means you're free. I'm in love with you. I love you, and, yeah, one day I was hoping maybe I would be your wife, but not like this. Not like this, with this -- this constant need and desire for someone else. It's...",
        "Liam: You didn't have to tell me this.",
        "Ivy: Of course, I had to tell you. I'm not gonna trap you in this relationship, Liam. It's not fair on you. It's not fair on either of us. You deserve to know the truth. And now you do. Look, I -- I'm sure -- I'm sure Carter can draw up the annulment papers. It should be easy enough.",
        "Liam: Oh, my God. Wait, Ivy. Ivy, hold on.",
        "Ivy: Liam, I-I know that you care about you. I know that. Otherwise, you wouldn't have made the sacrifice and married me in the first place. I love you, and I want a future with you. But I'm not gonna stop you from being with Steffy if that's the life you want.",

        "Maya: You know, every time we make love, it's the same.",
        "Rick: Gee. Thanks.",
        "Maya: No. I mean, I have the same thought. That I couldn't be more in love with you than I am right now. I never expected to find someone who could feel the way you do about someone like me.",
        "Rick: Someone like you? Let me tell you something, Maya. There's no one like you.",
        "Maya: I'm just a woman... trying to bring as much as I can into your life.",
        "Rick: Oh, you do. You do.",

        "Wyatt: I don't know why you're wearing out the rug. Liam's gone nuptial. Steffy's upset. How's this -- this isn't a bad scenario for me. What? Mom, what? Liam's out of the picture. It's a good thing for me, right?",
        "Quinn: You told him?",
        "Wyatt: Told who what? What the hell's going on?",
        "Ivy: I don't have to be married to Liam. He's free to be with Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Are you stalking me?",
        "Liam: Well, it wouldn't be the first time.",
        "Steffy: Well, it needs to be the last. Did you talk to your wife?",
        "Liam: Yeah. About that, um --",
        "Steffy: There's nothing more to be said.",
        "Liam: This time you're wrong.",
        "Steffy: No, Liam, this isn't easy for me.",
        "Liam: I know that, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: I don't want to hear it, okay? Your undying love for me -- well, it did die the moment when you married that woman. And I already know her tragic story, but do you even think about us? Do you think about our tragedy?",
        "Liam: Okay, can I say something?",
        "Steffy: No, because you'll just make it worse.",
        "Liam: All right.",
        "Steffy: God. [Sighs] Look, I came back for you, because I love you. And if don't see that, either you just don't care or you don't want to. And I'm gonna have to see you two together, so I just -- I can't handle it. I just got to go. I'm sorry.",
        "Liam: Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Hold on. You're right. Yes, I made a mistake. I should have thought about you -- about us -- when I made that decis--",
        "Steffy: Why didn't you? Why am I even doing this again? Why am I asking these questions? Now just get on your white horse and be on your way. I'm sure your damsel in distress is waiting for you.",
        "Liam: Okay, the damsel needed help, and I was in a position to deliver. That's all there is to that.",
        "Steffy: Liam, again, you married her. Ivy is your wife, and I'm the other woman. I'm not playing that role.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, you don't have to.",
        "Steffy: I know that, all right?",
        "Liam: No, you really don't have to. Steffy, the marriage is over.",
        "Steffy: What? It's over? You're letting her be deported?",
        "Liam: No, she won't be deported. There was a mistake. She had dual citizenship the entire time. She didn't know. We just found out.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: We didn't have to get married. And -- and even if we did, I shouldn't have done it, because I am still totally nuts about you. So can you forgive me? Can you forgive me now? Please?",
