Quinn tells Eric that she is glad he found a place for Katie ..she can do most anything except design jewelry. Wyatt tells Katie that he is flattered that she thinks he can help. She says he is a genius and she needs to find out how things are trending. He says he doesn't mind her reminding him how sexy his ex-wife is. She asks if he is over Steffy yet. He answers truthfully .probably not but he is not dwelling on it. Katie says she wants to do her best and he says he thinks he may have something for her that she will like. He says two words \u0096 Spencer Summit. Everybody will be there and she could make her splash. She thanks him and he says he just wants to help. Liam springs a day at the spa on Steffy for the two of them. He wants to make her the most pampered woman in the world and she says mission accomplished.",
        "When Ridge comes in the office, Eric leaves Quinn as she says she has a few more things to take care of. She thanks him again for being there and saving her from Deacon. He wants to know what Deacon meant by pushing him off the cliff. Quinn calls it Deacon's ravings. She gives him a present for saving her life and says all their craziness of the past is over. It is a bottle of Tequila with no bad memories attached. Charlie tells Sheila that he knows FC like the back of his hand and he would do anything for Eric. Sheila asks if Quinn met Eric by modeling for him. He says no, he could have married any model he wanted to but he chose Quinn. She asks if there is any concern. He says perhaps if she is such a good friend that she should know. Sheila surprises Eric by showing up at his door. She says she is still leaving Los Angeles but she can't without talking to him again. She asks if they are alone and he replies yes. He says he is more than fine so there is no reason for her to be concerned. She says good as she could not stand it if anyone did him harm.

        "Sheila: You're worrying me.",
        "Charlie: About Eric? There's, uh, no need to worry. By the way, you never said what your connection to him is.",
        "Sheila: I told you. We're old friends.",
        "Charlie: But you didn't recognize Pammy.",
        "Sheila: She wasn't around. It was a long time ago. But Stephanie and I, we were very close.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Old drinking buddies?",
        "Sheila: [Chuckles] Stephanie was the kind of friend that would take a bullet for me. And for Eric, too. And if something were wrong, she'd be the first person to step in and help, especially if it involved a new wife. Now, look, I don't know Quinn, but from what I've seen and heard, I'd like to think that she's good for him. Am I wrong?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: Hmm. There's only one problem with working with you here in this office.",
        "Quinn: Ah, is it too distracting?",
        "Eric: Distracting?",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric: What could possibly distract me about you?",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] You know, I could just get an office across town.",
        "Eric: No, no, no. Don't you dare. I love having you close like this. My wife, my children, my grandchildren. It's what I dreamed of when I formed this company years ago, working with my friends and my family.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. And your neighbor. Hmm. I'm glad you were able to find a place here for Katie.",
        "Eric: I am, too. I think she's gonna work out really well.",
        "Quinn: She's capable. I think she can do just about anything.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: Except design jewelry.",
        "Eric: Mnh, mnh, mnh. No.",
        "Quinn: No, she can't.",
        "Eric: No. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: I'm flattered you think I could help.",
        "Katie: Well, of course you can help. I mean, you had the job, and you were amazing at it.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Okay, well, uh, I don't know. I'd say probably follow Nicole's lead. That's -- that's my best advice.",
        "Katie: Well, sure. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'm gonna do that. But I want to make my own mark, as well, and I, you know, I guess I need to figure out how she knows how all these things are trending and need to put more importance on all those hashtags and followers.",
        "Wyatt: That's a big part of the job.",
        "Katie: And I have to keep Steffy in the public eye. You know, our \"sexy C.E.O.\"",
        "Wyatt: Right, yeah. That's gonna -- that'll take up a lot of your time.",
        "Katie: Wow. I just really said the wrong thing.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no. Uh, I absolutely love talking about how sexy my ex-wife is.",
        "[Seagulls calling]",
        "Steffy: I got to say, I fell for it.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you did.",
        "Steffy: Hmm. You and your romantic surprises.",
        "Liam: I genuinely can't tell if that's a compliment or a complaint.",
        "Steffy: Oh, okay. Let's see. A day of boring meetings or a day relaxing with my handsome husband. I'll try to make do with this horrible spa situation.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I-I know it's difficult for you to talk about Steffy. I shouldn't have brought her up. It was stupid.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no. It -- it's fine. It's fine, seriously. I, uh, I mean, it's probably wise I'm not still over there trying to promote her.",
        "Katie: Well, I'll try to keep her in the spotlight as well as you did.",
        "Wyatt: Her followers do love the behind-the-scenes at Forrester, and they are very interested in her personal life, so the occasional posting with Liam couldn't hurt.",
        "Katie: You still haven't gotten over her, have you?",
        "Liam: Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, if you need anything else, please don't hesitate.",
        "Liam: Uh, uh, we need, we need. We're very needy people. Um...[Chuckles] Uh, these -- these bento boxes look amazing. Could we have two of those? Uh, one vegetarian, please? And then what's -- what is better? The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e or the tart? Uh, the tart's more popular, but I like the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.",
        "Liam: I want both.",
        "Steffy: Liam!",
        "Liam: What? What? It's a spa day! We're supposed to be terrible. Both it is.",
        "Liam: Thank you. See? He gets it. This guy gets it. I am just trying to make you the most pampered woman in all of L.A. Is that so wrong?",
        "Steffy: Mission accomplished.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckling]",
        "Ridge: Oh! I can come back.",
        "Quinn: Oh.",
        "Eric: No, no. It's all right. It's all right, ridge. I was just leaving.",
        "Quinn: Hmm.",
        "Eric: You, um, you coming soon?",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I just have a few things I need to finish up here.",
        "Eric: Text me when you're on your way. I'll have a martini waiting for you.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Hey, hey, hey. You know what you mean to me, right?",
        "Eric: I'm getting a good idea.",
        "Charlie: Look, lady, I'm no gossip. This case is confidential.",
        "Sheila: A case? Something serious must be going on if you've been assigned to investigate.",
        "Charlie: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm -- I'm head of security over at Forrester.",
        "Sheila: Really?",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah. I know that place like the back of my hand.",
        "Sheila: Well, then I feel much better knowing that Eric has someone like you protecting him.",
        "Charlie: I'd do anything for that guy, you know. Except maybe modeling, but, uh... and he never asked, so I guess it's still on the table. [Chuckles]",
        "Sheila: [Chuckles] Is -- is that how he met Quinn? Did she model for him?",
        "Charlie: Well, that would make more sense, but no. I mean, a guy like Eric -- you know, talented, handsome, as nice as they come -- he could have married a model if he wanted to. He could have married any woman he wanted to, but he -- he ends up with, uh, with, uh...",
        "Sheila: Ends up with someone you don't approve of.",
        "Charlie: I didn't say that.",
        "Sheila: Do I need to talk to him about her?",
        "Charlie: Well... I mean, if you're such a good, old friend... maybe you should.",
        "Liam: So are we doing couple's massage? We doing, uh, deep tissue or relaxation or what?",
        "Steffy: No, deep tissue.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. You know, on second thought, maybe we should just cancel the massages.",
        "Liam: Like no massage? I thought you were looking forward to that.",
        "Steffy: Oh, no, like, I mean, I want a massage, but, like, I have this handsome man with really strong hands in the cabana, so maybe...",
        "Liam: Ohhh. I like where your head's at. Just remember, gratuity not included.",
        "Steffy: Oh. [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Have I gotten over Steffy? Probably not. But I'm not gonna dwell on it. There's a lot of other things I could be focused on, positive things, like -- like your new job.",
        "Katie: Like my new job!",
        "Wyatt: Yes!",
        "Katie: Right! Important things, like me!",
        "Wyatt: Exactly! I-I am really excited for you.",
        "Katie: Thank you. It's a great opportunity, and I want to make an immediate impact. You know, I-I want to start off with some kind of promotional event.",
        "Wyatt: Like what?",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I don't know yet. But I want it to be big. You know, not just some meet-and-greet in the showroom. I'm hoping to, like, bounce some ideas off someone, so if you have some ideas that need bouncing.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I-I might actually have something.",
        "Katie: Yeah? What?",
        "Wyatt: I-I think you're really gonna like it.",
        "Ridge: You hanging in there?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Doing a lot better now that I don't have someone shooting at me.",
        "Ridge: Deacon. I can't believe he was that stupid. No, you know what? I can believe that. What was he talking about when he said you pushed him off a cliff or something?",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. You're gonna listen to deacon's crazy rantings? I don't know. I-I'm just -- I'm just glad that -- that you were home and Katie called you, because it could have ended so differently.",
        "Ridge: Well, it -- it's fine. Everything's fine. He's in jail.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. When you almost lose your life, you look at things differently.",
        "Ridge: Differently how?",
        "Quinn: Well, I mean, in every way. You know, you think about what you still want to do and how you want to live and who you want to be.",
        "Ridge: And who do you want to be, Quinn?",
        "Quinn: I want to be the woman that Eric thinks I am.",
        "Ridge: I think you are that woman. I believe that. Do you?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Eric: Sheila?",
        "Sheila: I-I know. I told you that I was leaving los Angeles, and I-I am. But I just needed to see you again, Eric. May I?",
        "Eric: Yeah. Is something wrong?",
        "Sheila: Are we alone?",
        "Eric: Yes. What is it?",
        "Sheila: Well, that's what I'm wondering.",
        "Eric: I don't understand.",
        "Sheila: I can't leave los Angeles, Eric, not until I know you're okay.",
        "Steffy: [Moans]",
        "Liam: Too hard?",
        "Steffy: It's just right. Hmm, you were born to do this.",
        "Liam: What? Be a masseur?",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Not a masseur. My masseur.",
        "Liam: Well... can't very well do my job with this bathing suit in the way, now can I?",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] I think my masseur has ulterior motives.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, that's how you know it's good.",
        "Katie: Out with it. I'm all ears.",
        "Wyatt: Two words. Spencer summit.",
        "Katie: Interesting.",
        "Wyatt: Think about it. Everybody who's anybody's gonna be there. We're talking the top people from finance, business, art, fashion, everything.",
        "Katie: Right. They all gather once a year in Monte Carlo.",
        "Wyatt: Exactly. Now, if you want to make a splash, that is the place to do it. Last year, Eric's speech was a huge success for Forrester.",
        "Katie: But I want to do something bigger than a speech, something more like, um...",
        "Wyatt: Fashion show.",
        "Katie: A fashion show. That's good.",
        "Wyatt: I can picture it right there. I mean, Forrester couture right on the beaches of Monaco.",
        "Katie: But what if we don't do couture? I mean, it's the French Riviera. Why don't we debut something new, like a swimwear line?",
        "Wyatt: Yes! That could be exactly what Forrester needs to get past this whole spectra debacle.",
        "Katie: Yeah. That's for sure.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Thanks, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: I'm just -- I'm happy to help.",
        "Ridge: Hey. That wife you want to be, you're already there. You got to believe that.",
        "Quinn: I do. I do. I just... honestly, I don't know what got into us, right? 'Cause, I mean, we went from hating each other to, what, we were flirting? We weren't really flirting.",
        "Ridge: It doesn't matter. It's over now.",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: We're friends, and I'm happy.",
        "Quinn: Me, too. And I bought you a present.",
        "Ridge: A present? Why?",
        "Quinn: Oh, I don't know. Maybe 'cause you saved my life, friend? I don't know. It's right there. It's in the top drawer. Come on.",
        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Tequila.",
        "Quinn: Tequila.",
        "Ridge: Seriously?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Well, now that everything is behind us, tequila's kind of what got us into a bit of a mess in the first place. I think tequila should just be tequila. No bad memories attached.",
        "Ridge: I like that. Thank you.",
        "Quinn: You're welcome.",
        "Eric: Sheila, I'm fine. I'm better than fine. Did something happen to convince you otherwise?",
        "Sheila: I'm just starting to wonder what you got yourself mixed up in.",
        "Eric: Sheila, I appreciate that you still care after all these years.",
        "Sheila: No, I'll always care. I'll always have your back. I always will, because you're important to me. I can't even think of someone causing you harm.",
        "Katie: I'm gonna do it.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Katie: A fashion show at the Spencer summit.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Thanks for the idea.",
        "Wyatt: It's my gift to you. You're the one who came up with the swimwear concept, though. So come on. But if you need any help, anything at all, I would be happy to.",
        "Katie: You sure?",
        "Wyatt: Of course. I'm serious. Being a bachelor now, it means I got a lot of time on my hands, so I would welcome the opportunity to take my mind off of things.",
        "Katie: Just might take you up on that.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: Please tell me you rented this cabana for the entire month.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I tried, believe me. But management here is terrible. Apparently they have to close down every night and go home to their families?",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Liam: I know.",
        "Steffy: That's awful.",
        "Liam: I know. What are you gonna do?",
        "Steffy: Hey. Thank you for doing this, forcing us to keep the craziness out of our lives and taking time out for each other.",
        "Liam: Nothing is more important, okay?",
        "Steffy: And nothing ever will be.",
        "Sheila: Just want to make sure that you're all right.",
        "Eric: I am. I promise. I'm happy, Sheila. I'm happier than I've ever been in my life.",
        "Sheila: Well, I hope that Quinn understands how lucky she is, understands what an honor it is to be in your life, 'cause I had that once. And I just wasted it.",
        "Eric: I appreciate your concern. I'm very happy that you're making progress -- I really am -- and that you're reaching out and you're trying to make amends. That's as far as it goes, Sheila. I think it's inappropriate that you should question my marriage.",
        "Sheila: Oh, Eric, I-I understand. I-I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. Really, if -- if you're happy, then I'm -- I'm happy.",
        "Eric: Good. I wish you well. Good luck.",
        "Sheila: You know, if anything should change and you just want someone to talk to...",
        "Eric: I'll keep that in mind.",
        "Sheila: Oh! Hello.",
        "Quinn: Can I help you, Sheila?",
        "Sheila: I was just leaving.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but what were you doing here?",
        "Sheila: I was visiting Eric.",
        "Quinn: No. You don't get to do that, not when I'm not home.",
        "Sheila: Excuse me?",
        "Quinn: I don't want my husband's ex-wife coming by unannounced.",
        "Sheila: Do you say that to Brooke, as well?",
        "Quinn: No. Just to the ex-con ex-wives. See, I know Brooke isn't going to poison him or try to shoot him. Yeah, I heard all the stories about you.",
        "Sheila: You don't need to be intimidated by me.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I'm not.",
        "Sheila: Hmm. Seems that way. Interesting. Be a good wife, Quinn. Appreciate him. Know how lucky you are.",
        "Quinn: You need to go now.",
        "Sheila: Don't touch me. You do that again, and I will snap you in two."
