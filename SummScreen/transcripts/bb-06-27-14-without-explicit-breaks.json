        "Rick tells Caroline that he was not the only one in the steam room. She guesses Myrna so no wonder she is putting off her marriage to Carter. Maya comes in and starts chatting about Aly and Oliver. Caroline doesn't know what this has to do with her being in the steam room with Rick. Maya says she did not know that Rick would be telling her that. They had a thing once and it ended so quickly that they never got a chance to process it. Rick was on the rebound. Caroline points out Rick was with her first so Maya had no claim on him. Aly tells Oliver that she is more comfortable behind the scenes. Quinn is in her factory finishing up on some welding. Wyatt invites Deacon in and wonders if Hope knows he is in town. Deacon says he used to live in this very house; he likes what he has done with it. Deacon says Wyatt is involved with his daughter so he doesn't have to ask why he is here. Wyatt says was as in the past. But he does admit he would like to have Hope back. She is fun and relaxed when she is with him, not uptight like with Liam. He knows she also wants him back. Deacon says he doesn't know Liam but he seems like a likeable guy. But they have tried to get married for so long that something must be wrong. Wyatt says he is glad Deacon came by and he'd like to get to know him too. Deacon suggests they open up one of those bottles of scotch as he is parched. Hope and Liam kiss and she is protective of his boo-boo. He scoffs it off as just a little flesh wound and he was glad to get it if it meant showing Hope how crazy Quinn really is and that she is better off with Quinn and Wyatt out of their lives.",
        "Maya tells Rick and Caroline that she is no gold digger but she had to be sure that Rick was happy before she moved on to marry Carter. It's Oliver that she is worried about with his coming on and hanging all over Aly to move himself up in the company. Caroline says no way about Oliver. Maya came on to her boss and now she is feeling guilty. Maya plays them the phone message by Oliver. Charlie and Pam in costume convince Aly and Oliver to attend the Medieval Nights with them. Wyatt tells Deacon that he does not know his mother, but she is the cause of his not being with Hope right now. She likes to cross lines and meddles as long as she gets what she wants. But sometimes she goes a little too far. The wind is howling and there is a thunderstorm brewing. Liam comes home and locks the doors, turns all the lights out, and flops on his bed. Liam hears a loud noise and jumps up and starts searching with his flashlight. Suddenly he sees Quinn's face in the lights."

        "[Liam & Hope chuckle]",
        "Liam: What? What?",
        "Hope: You just seem awfully happy for a man who got stabbed in the neck with a sword today.",
        "Liam: [As the black knight] Well, it's just a flesh wound.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: [Normal voice] No, it's fine. It's not a big deal.",
        "Hope: Oh, my big, strong man.",
        "Liam: Hey, hey, hey. Don't you forget it.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Big, strong.",
        "Hope: Well, you know that when Quinn is involved, even the bravest of men have to be careful.",
        "Liam: I'm so happy about this future that I do not care.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: No more interferences. No one to stand in our way.",
        "Deacon: Believe it or not, I used to live here. Love what you've done with the place.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. So, hope's dad, huh?",
        "Deacon: In the flesh.",
        "Wyatt: She know you're around?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I've seen her.",
        "Wyatt: Does she know you're here?",
        "Deacon: Nah.",
        "Wyatt: Why are you here?",
        "Caroline: And I didn't want to be the bad guy, so I just told him that, you know, I'm the designer, and he could expect a phone call from you, so I hope you don't mind. Rick.",
        "Rick: Hmm?",
        "Caroline: My meeting -- I was telling you about it.",
        "Rick: [Sighs] Yeah, right. I'm -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Caroline: How long were you in that steam room? It's one thing to be relaxed, but you are completely checking out here. What's the matter?",
        "Rick: [Sighs] I wasn't alone in the steam room. Somebody joined me.",
        "Caroline: Okay. Is that a problem?",
        "Rick: Well, she tried to put her hands all over me, so, yeah.",
        "Caroline: Who? [Sighs] Myrna.",
        "Aly: I've never modeled before, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: You're a natural.",
        "Aly: But -- but Maya's excellent at it. I just -- I don't see hope wanting to replace her.",
        "Oliver: You're younger. You're a Forrester. You are the embodiment of the Hope for the Future message. You are the perfect spokesmodel.",
        "Caroline: Well, this explains a lot. Maya's been avoiding setting a wedding date with carter. She still thinks she has a chance with you.",
        "Rick: No, no, I-I told her that she doesn't. Look, I married the right woman.",
        "Caroline: Obviously.",
        "Maya: We need to talk.",
        "Aly: World's best boyfriend.",
        "Oliver: Me?",
        "Aly: Thinking I could model for a living.",
        "Oliver: I know you could.",
        "Aly: Maybe, but that's not who I am. I'm more comfortable behind the scenes. And besides, Maya looks out for me. She's a good friend, and I wouldn't want to put her out of a job, you know?",
        "Oliver: No. We wouldn't want that.",
        "[Grinder buzzing]",
        "[Buzzing stops]",
        "Hope: Mm. Did it hurt?",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Well, ye, a little.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: I'm still glad she did it.",
        "Hope: Seriously?",
        "Liam: Yeah, seriously, 'cause she's just digging herself in deeper. I mean, she's showing us all how crazy she is. She thinks she's scaring me, right? What she's really doing is making me even more protective of you. And she's just clarifying for you how much better off you are without her and Wyatt in your life.",
        "Deacon: You're involved with my daughter. Now, you really need to ask why I'm here?",
        "Wyatt: Used to be involved, so I guess you're not up to date.",
        "Deacon: I think I am. She's with Liam...for now.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Deacon: Can't imagine that sits well. You know, I used to see pictures of you two in the press every now and again. You'd have your arms around each other. Kind of hard to miss with that whole diamond heist.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Yeah, that was insane.",
        "Deacon: I actually remember thinking to myself maybe y two are meant to be, but, you know, then again, what do I know?",
        "Wyatt: She's a different person when she's with me. She's --he's relaxed. She's happy. She's fun. And, yes, I want her back. And she might not be ready to admit it yet, but... I know she wants me back, too.",
        "Maya: There's something going on. I should have told you from the beginning.",
        "Caroline: This is a conversation that you need to be having with carter, not us.",
        "Maya: Carter knows. He wasn't worried. He thought I was overreacting, but I'm not.",
        "Rick: You told carter?",
        "Maya: He thinks Oliver is harmless -- that maybe he's genuinely interested, but --",
        "Caroline: I'm sorry. What does Oliver have to do with you hitting on my husband in the steam room?",
        "Maya: Okay, I-I didn't think you'd be telling her about that.",
        "Rick: [Clears throat] Maya, she's my wife. I don't keep anything from her.",
        "Caroline: Have you been pining after him this whole time, leading carter on?",
        "Maya: Rick and I had something great together, and it ended quickly. The truth is, we never had time to process it. We both rebounded.",
        "Caroline: Hardly a rebound, seeing as he was with me first, but whatever.",
        "Maya: Carter is a great guy, and I know we would have a wonderful life together, but I-I couldn't walk around thinking, \"what if?\" Maybe I shouldn't have done it, but I had to tell Rick the way I felt... in case maybe he was feeling that way, too.",
        "Pam: [Chuckles] Oh!",
        "Oliver: [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: Oh, Aly, thank goodness you are here.",
        "Aly: [Chuckling] What's going on, guys?",
        "Oliver: Looks like a big night out.",
        "Pam: Well, it was supposed to be. I finally convinced donna to come with us to the castle. I even helped her pick out this amazing outfit. It's this wench thing that, you know --",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and then, suddenly, she gets a case of the 24-hour plague.",
        "Pam: Right. Now, I know you haven't been coming with us recently, but we have an extra ticket. So, what do you say?",
        "Liam: There isn't a woman on the planet who would take a mother-in-law like you.",
        "Liam: I am holding your feet to the fire. You can't threaten me. You have zero power over me. You are a vile, manipulative, evil bitch!",
        "Liam: Okay, you know what goes around comes around, right? You and Wyatt are out.",
        "Liam: Hey, um -- uh, favor?",
        "Hope: Mm.",
        "Liam: Uh, I know you're gonna, uh, head home now, and I got that meeting in the morning, but --",
        "Hope: Well, I wish I could stay.",
        "Liam: No, no, no. It's -- stay the course. You stay at your mom's until we're married.",
        "Hope: Okay, well, since I know you're not gonna ask me to stay the night, what's the favor?",
        "Liam: Ah, yes. Uh, hold on. Hold on.",
        "Hope: I'm holding.",
        "Liam: This -- this will work.",
        "Hope: For what?",
        "Liam: For fundraising -- honeymoon fundraising.",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, it's a swear jar. See? Damn.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Wait, a swear jar? For you or for me?",
        "Liam: For both of us.",
        "Hope: I was not aware that we were having that problem.",
        "Liam: Oh, but we are, especially with the \"q\" word.",
        "Hope: Oh. Oh, all right. Okay. Gotcha.",
        "Liam: Also, I think we should throw in the \"w\" word. They should both cost a quarter, I say.",
        "Hope: All right, then, in that case, I'll watch myself.",
        "Liam: Good.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. Mm, but hold on. If this money's going to our honeymoon --",
        "Liam: No, no, no. I-I know what you're thinking. I know what you're thinking, but our time is our time. Frankly, I don't want to talk about either of them.",
        "Hope: Who?",
        "Liam: Exactly.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "[Wind gusting] [Thudding] Mm. God!",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: I'm sorry, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm almost glad that I'm not staying here tonight because sometimes this house scares me.",
        "Liam: Aw. Oh, what, you don't think I protect you?",
        "Hope: Oh, no, honey. You always do.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Deacon: I'm not trying to butt in, but I will if I think hope's making a mistake. You know, I want what's best for her.",
        "Wyatt: I hope you see the signs, because what's best for hope is standing right in front of you, and it ain't Liam.",
        "Deacon: Hey, look, don't get me wrong -- I mean, I got nothing against the guy. Frankly, he seems likable enough to me, but it does seem strange -- you know, two people trying to get together for so long. I mean, something must not be working.",
        "Wyatt: Something stopped working a long time ago. I mean, they were -- they're both so used to trying to get married, they didn't notice. And then I came along, gave hope a better option. Showed her that there was someone out there who actually made an effort for her. I'm glad you came by -- getting to know me and everything.",
        "Deacon: I don't want to give you the wrong idea here. I just thought I'd introduce myself to the odd man out. That's all.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I know, and I'm not asking anything of you. I just -- keep an open mind when it comes to me.",
        "Deacon: you mind if I ask you something?",
        "Wyatt: Anything.",
        "Deacon: What say you and I open up one of these bottles of scotch? 'Cause, u I'm damn-near parched.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: Things could have been very different for me. I could have been the one calling myself \"Forrester,\" not you. Can you blame me for taking a moment to make sure that Rick is happy before I commit myself to carter?",
        "Caroline: Oh, I see what this is. You want a bigger paycheck.",
        "Maya: I am no gold digger. Someone else in the company is, and I am here trying to warn you.",
        "Rick: You said something about Oliver.",
        "Maya: He's using Aly.",
        "Rick: What? What are you talking about?",
        "Maya: He's flirting with her, leading her on.",
        "Rick: He's hanging out with her.",
        "Maya: It all started when Ridge tried to fire Oliver. He was worried about his job, but Aly had a crush on him. So he got to thinking. If he ties himself to a Forrester, he has job security. Oliver is using Aly, and you have to put a stop to it before she gets hurt.",
        "Pam: Oh, Aly, please, come. It's been ages since you've been, and you know you love it.",
        "Aly: Maybe another time, okay?",
        "Pam: We're gonna miss you.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Oliver: Stop. She's going.",
        "Aly: What?",
        "Oliver: We both are. Pam, come with us down to the storage room. Aly and I need costumes.",
        "Pam: What? Yes!",
        "Aly: Seriously, do you know what you're getting yourself into?",
        "Oliver: No idea, but if it's something you like, I want to experience it, too. Whatever you're into, I want to be into it, too.",
        "Wyatt: Welcome back to L.A.",
        "Deacon: Cheers.",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "Deacon: Mmm.",
        "Wyatt: Mmm.",
        "Deacon: Ahh. So, um, I'm curious. If hope's happier with you, why is she with Liam?",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] We're not together anymore because of my mother. I know that sounds ridiculous, but you don't know my mother. She's overly involved in my life -- was overly involved, I should say. I don't really want anything to do with her right now.",
        "Deacon: That sounds kind of harsh.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, I'm trying to show hope that I can separate myself from her, you know? I mean, my mother's not exactly the kind of person hope respects.",
        "Deacon: Why?",
        "Wyatt: She doesn't care how much she has to interfere, what lines she has to cross. If people get hurt, it doesn't matter...as long as she gets what she wants.",

        "[Crashing]",
        "Rick: Are you sure about this?",
        "Caroline: There is no way. You're just trying to cause drama to divert attention. You hit on your boss, and now you're panicking.",
        "Maya: You want proof? I've got proof.",
        "Oliver: I need to hold on to this job. If that means dating the redheaded Forrester for a bit, I'm willing to do it.",

        "[Laughter]",
        "Charlie: Come on -- let's get inside. Let's go!",
        "Pam: Wait till you see the seats we got.",
        "Oliver: Uh, how come other people aren't dressed up?",
        "Pam: Oh, tourists don't usually, but there's lots of regulars like us.",
        "Aly: You look great, by the way.",
        "Oliver: So do you.",
        "Pam: [Chuckles]",
        "Charlie: You are about to go back in time. Do not be frightened. Why, it's not real. Or is it?",
        "Pam: Two hours of epic battle.",
        "Aly: Pageantry.",
        "Charlie: Jousting.",
        "Aly: The horses.",
        "Oliver: Milady.",
        "Aly: Mm.",
        "Wyatt: I know what you're thinking. I ought to be thrilled to have a mom like that on my side, and for most of my life, I was. You know, there was something cool having a mother that was different than the rest -- didn't mind bending the rules now and then. But sometimes...she just goes a little too far.",
