He leaves her alone with Steffy. Maya and Rick explain to Viv about Nicole signing the papers. Viv says she is going through a rough time and just needs more time. Maya retorts that it is Julius who is getting to her. Nicole and Julius go home and Nicole says the papers are in her bag but she has not signed them yet. Julius laments he hopes she never will. This is not an accident; it is a gift from heaven. The baby should be with its real mother. Coco and RJ take a selfie and declare it official for the social media. Liam and Wyatt discuss Katie taking over his old job. He is not jealous. He thinks she will be a real asset to FC. They both agree she deserves a medal for even putting up with their father over the years. Steffy likes Katie's ideas. Katie tells Steffy she thinks they need to catch the public's eye, so somewhere with national appeal. She suggests the Spencer Summit.", "Julius tells Nicole that Maya has been selfish all her life and Nicole is now paying for it. If Maya was supposed to have a child then she would have come equipped for it. Nicole is making a tremendous sacrifice for Maya and it is just wrong. Katie calls Wyatt and says she cannot thank him enough. He says it is an amazing opportunity for her and he is more than willing to help. Julius tells Nicole this is a chance to right things. That child is of her flesh and blood. She carried her for nine months and this child is hers, not Maya's. Viv walks in and says she does not want to hear those words coming out of his mouth anymore. Zende says they may not get a family the way they imagined but they will get through this. What Julius is suggesting is not fair to Maya or Lizzy. Nicole made a promise and she needs to keep it. Just sign the adoption papers and get this behind them."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Steffy: I still feel so relaxed from the spa yesterday.", "Liam: Yeah?", "Steffy: Mm-hmm.", "Liam: I'm glad you liked the surprise.", "Steffy: Oh, it's exactly what I needed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Elevator bell dings]", "Wyatt: Two words. Spencer summit. Now, if you want to make a splash, that is the place to do it. Last year, Eric's speech was a huge success for Forrester.", "Katie: But I want to do something bigger than a speech, something more like, um...", "Wyatt: Fashion show.", "Katie: A fashion show. That's good.", "Wyatt: I mean, Forrester couture right on the beaches of Monaco.", "Katie: But what if we don't do couture? I mean, it's the French Riviera. Why don't we debut something new, like a swimwear line?", "Wyatt: Yes! Yes, exactly.", "Katie: Thanks, Wyatt.", "Wyatt: I'm happy to help.", "Katie: Oh! [Chuckles] Sorry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Oh, no, no, it's -- it's okay. We're just being annoying newlyweds. Come on in.", "Liam: Yeah, yeah, our bad. Hey, I heard you got Wyatt's old job.", "Katie: Yeah!", "Liam: That's pretty cool.", "Katie: Yeah, I'm really excited about it. In fact, I already have an idea I'd like to run by you.", "Liam: Uh, that's my cue. Um, I got to go to my office. I will see you later.", "Steffy: Okay.", "Liam: Okay. Congratulations. Good choice.", "Katie: [Chuckles]", "Steffy: What's your idea? I'd -- I'd love to hear it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Camera shutter clicks]", "R.J.: And got it.", "Coco: Wait, let me see. Oh, wait, that's cute. Wait, that's really cute. I like that.", "R.J.: Well, I'm gonna post it.", "Coco: Really?", "R.J.: Yeah.", "Coco: Okay. Well, we're officially official, then.", "R.J.: I guess we are.", "Coco: [Chuckles]", "Zende: Hey, guys.", "R.J.: Hey, um, Zende. Uh, actually, I was gonna look for you. My dad's been asking about a red dress?", "Zende: Red dress. Yeah. Um, I'll have it finished soon. It's just most of my focus has been on Nicole.", "R.J.: Yeah, I'm sure my dad will be cool. No rush.", "Coco: How is she doing?", "Zende: You know what? I think I figured out part of the problem, why she's been so attached to Lizzy. It's her father. He needs to stop messing with her head.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Nicole won't sign the adoption papers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: She's going through something, Maya. The doctors told her she might not be able to have another child. I mean, maybe she just needs a little time.", "Rick: I'm sorry. Nothing's changed. Maya and I are Lizzy's parents. All we're asking her is for a signature.", "Vivienne: I'm sure Nicole understands that, rick.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Then why is she doing this?", "[Lizzy whines]", "Maya: Why doesn't she understand that I'm Lizzy's mother?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I don't want to talk about it.", "Julius: Sweetheart, you cannot sweep these things under the rug. It's weighing on you, and I can tell!", "Nicole: Look, I came to pick up some papers for the office. You shouldn't have followed me.", "Julius: Do you still have the adoption papers?", "Nicole: They're in my bag. And I have not signed them yet.", "Julius: And I hope you never will.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: All right. Let's see here.", "Liam: Do you ever work in your own office?", "Wyatt: What? The view's better up here.", "Liam: Hey, guess what?", "Wyatt: Hmm? You're not really my brother and this has all been a cruel hoax on me?", "Liam: No.", "Wyatt: [Laughs]", "Liam: But Katie got your old job at Forrester.", "Wyatt: And? You're assuming I'm gonna be upset by this?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Katie, you just started. I don't want you putting pressure on yourself.", "Katie: Yeah, no, no. I've -- I've been having fun, you know, brainstorming.", "Steffy: Yeah, but, you know, Wyatt -- he's the king of promotion and marketing. It's some pretty big shoes to fill.", "Katie: Oh, yeah, I'm -- I'm well aware of Wyatt's P.R. Prowess. In fact, uh, this is an idea that I think he might have come up with himself.", "Steffy: Oh, okay. Now I'm curious.", "Katie: One word for you. Swimwear.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: Nicole confided in me about her fertility issues.", "Zende: Yeah, yeah, it's been a struggle. On top of that, her father thinks that she should keep Lizzy.", "Coco: Well, maybe you should talk to Nicole's mom about this.", "R.J.: That's a good idea.", "Zende: Yeah. If I have any chance of helping my wife, I need to speak to her mother.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: [Chuckling] Aww! Mmm!", "Vivienne: [Laughs]", "Maya: I love you, my Lizzy. [Chuckles] All right. Mommy will be right here, okay? There you go.", "Vivienne: I don't know what to make of this. Nicole's heart is broken. She wants a child so badly.", "Rick: I know she does. But to hang this over our head?", "Vivienne: That's not Nicole. I mean, something else is getting to her.", "Maya: Oh, no. Not something. Someone. Daddy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: Can I see those papers? Hmm. Yeah, see, they thought this was all signed and sealed, a done deal. But it's not. You think this is an accident? It's not an accident. This is a gift from the heavens. This is a sign that Lizzy should be with her real mother. You, Nicole.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Katie and I talk all the time. She told me she was taking over my old job, and I was like, \"yeah, go ahead. Big deal.\"", "Liam: What? Well, forgive me if I'm a little surprised you're not jealous.", "Wyatt: Wh-- why would I be? She's a friend, and I'm happy for her.", "Liam: Yeah, sure, till she shows you up.", "Wyatt: Well, more power if she does.", "Liam: Well, she's already pitching ideas to Steffy, so there's that.", "Wyatt: Really?", "Liam: Yep. She came in just as I was leaving. She seemed really enthusiastic about whatever it is she's got in mind.", "Wyatt: Well, she should be. I predict people will be pleasantly surprised by what she's capable of, and I think she's gonna be a real asset to Forrester.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Swimwear?", "Katie: Yeah. So, hear me out. We need to step it up a notch, catch the public's eye, especially after spectra stole our designs.", "Steffy: Oh, yeah, that was totally humiliating. I mean, we're still suffering the consequences.", "Katie: So let's give ourselves a new venue. Let's get our customers out of the showroom, take them on an adventure somewhere luxurious, somewhere with international appeal to create buzz.", "Steffy: What exactly do you have in mind?", "Katie: Specifically, the Spencer summit.", "Steffy: Monte Carlo?", "Katie: Mm-hmm.", "Steffy: What does that have to do with swimwear?", "Katie: Everything. It's the ideal place for a Forrester fashion show.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: I feel for Nicole and all the emotion she must be feeling. I-I can't even imagine.", "R.J.: Yeah, yeah, it's got to be hard.", "Coco: I think it's sweet the way Zende's protecting her, though, like fighting for her.", "R.J.: Well, that's what a guy does when he cares about a woman.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Dad said that I am not Lizzy's real mother, that legally and genetically she is Nicole's.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: Baby, I am so sorry. We're gonna figure this out as a family.", "[Door opens]", "Zende: Hey.", "Vivienne: Hey.", "Rick: You heard from Nicole?", "Zende: Not yet. Look, I know you're all concerned. Nicole's taken this infertility news pretty hard. But that's not all that's going on here.", "Vivienne: Maya was just filling me in.", "Zende: So you know what Julius is up to?", "Vivienne: Unfortunately, yes.", "Zende: Look, he's leading Nicole in the wrong direction. He's all in her head right now. It is not his place to try to convince her not to sign those papers. It needs to stop.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: You can't keep saying things like this, daddy.", "Julius: Nicole, I have always been straightforward with you. And if nobody else has the guts to be honest with you, I always will. Now, Lizzy is your baby. You gave birth to her. You! Nobody else.", "Nicole: I know. And this is really hard for me. I love her so much. But I don't want to have these feelings. I don't want to have these doubts. It's not right. But I can't help it.", "Julius: Listen, you gave up what might be the only child you'll ever have for your sister. Why? Because she couldn't have one. It was never intended, and that's not your fault! We're talking about your life, your family! And it's time that you stop thinking about making everybody else happy and take care of your damn self. I want you to take care of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: I have always had nothing but respect for Katie. I mean, talk about strength. Think about everything she's been through.", "Liam: Yeah, and she deserves a medal for putting up with our dad.", "Wyatt: Yeah. Right? And she's, you know, single mom, full time career.", "Liam: Makes it all look easy.", "Wyatt: I think it's pretty remarkable. She basically ran this place. She was C.E.O. Of Forrester. Now she's in charge of -- of defining Forrester's brand. It's, I don't know, it's cool.", "Liam: I wonder what that's gonna look like. Like, what kind of changes is she gonna make?", "Wyatt: I don't know. Time will tell. But you know what? Whatever she does end up doing, I don't know, I think it's gonna be pretty exciting and provocative.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Okay, imagine a beach in Monte Carlo. The cocktails are flowing. Ros\u00e9 for days. It's hot, it's sultry. The air is thick with anticipation, and we reveal our new collection, Forrester swimwear -- bikinis, sarongs, elegant caftans. What do you think of the concept so far?", "Steffy: It's sexy and glamorous. Really edgy. I like it. Logistically, it might be challenging, but it has a lot of potential. I'll think about it.", "Katie: Okay, well, that's all I can ask.", "Steffy: Katie, I have to say, I'm really impressed. You had, what, a day and a half, and you came up with this on your own. Not bad.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: I guess our problems don't seem too important compared to what Zende and Nicole are going through.", "Coco: We're having problems?", "R.J.: Well, you liking techno music, that's a real problem.", "Coco: It's the best! Stop!", "R.J.: I don't know how much longer I could take of this.", "Coco: Aww. Poor guy. That's horrible. Is there any way I could make it up to you?", "R.J.: Huh. I don't know. But you could try. Yeah?", "Coco: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Nicole is vulnerable, and Julius is taking advantage.", "Maya: It's not fair that she's having trouble conceiving, but it is not okay for dad to be putting ideas in her head like this.", "Zende: He's telling her that the adoption not being official is a sign.", "Maya: He said I should be grateful that I had one good year with Lizzy, that that was enough because it was something that I thought was unimaginable, that I should just hand Lizzy over to Nicole!", "Vivienne: Julius! I swear, that's crazy. He can't really mean that.", "Zende: He does.", "Vivienne: Well, no. Well, then we have to put a stop to it. We need to speak to Nicole right away.", "Zende: Right. She went over to Eric's. I'm assuming she's still there.", "Rick: All right, well, then let's go.", "Maya: [Gasps] Come here, Lizzy bear. Rick, what if we can't get through to her?", "Zende: We will. We have to. We have to stop Julius.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: Maya has been selfish her whole life, and our family has suffered because of it. If Maya was meant to have a child, then she would have had the means.", "Nicole: I can't have a baby, either. You could say the same about me. Am I being punished?", "Julius: No. The only person that's punishing you is Maya by making you her surrogate.", "Nicole: I made the choice to do it.", "Julius: Yes! But you were too young to make that decision! You should have never been put in that position! And look at what's happened because of it! You've got a broken heart. I mean, you're yearning for your daughter. You can't have another child because of that birth! You're the one that's suffering, Nicole, and I'm only saying this because I'm your father and I love you, and I only want the best for you! Listen, you have made a tremendous sacrifice for Maya, and what she is doing to you, it is just wrong.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I'll give your idea some serious consideration. I'll pitch it to my father, run the numbers. But you're onto something.", "Katie: Great. I'm -- I'm glad you like it.", "Steffy: I just can't believe I didn't even think of it myself.", "Katie: [Chuckles]", "Steffy: We'll talk later.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Okay. Thank you.", "[Dialing]", "[Ringtone plays]", "Wyatt: Is this the Katie Logan?", "Katie: [Chuckles] Yeah, it is. Um, do you have a second?", "Wyatt: I do, yeah. But did you pitch Steffy on the idea?", "Katie: I did.", "Wyatt: Yeah? What she say?", "Katie: She said it was sexy and glamorous with a little bit of an edge.", "Wyatt: Glamorous, sexy, edgy. Wow. You know, those were my trademarks when I worked there at Forrester.", "Katie: Well, I guess they're my trademarks now.", "Wyatt: [Chuckling] Yeah, I guess so.", "Katie: Seriously, um, I can't thank you enough.", "Wyatt: Come on. We came up with the idea together.", "Katie: I feel bad taking all of the credit.", "Wyatt: Would you stop? This is a good thing, Katie. It's an amazing opportunity for you, and I couldn't be happier. And like I said before, if you need anything, anything at all, I am more than willing to help.", "Katie: Well, I appreciate that, and thank you for letting me run with it. So I'll keep you posted. Bye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Birds chirping]", "Julius: You have been given a second chance, a chance to do the right thing for Lizzy, to raise her in a traditional family home and give you and Zende the -- the baby that you so both desperately desired. Nicole, don't sign these papers. That child is made of your flesh and blood. You carried her in your womb for nine months! You created her! You brought her into this world, not Maya!", "Vivienne: Julius Avant! What the hell do you think you're doing?! What kind of nonsense are you putting in this child's head?!", "Julius: Oh, come on, Viv. You know that what I'm saying is the truth.", "Vivienne: I don't want to hear it! I don't want to hear it!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: You know, Julius, every day I lose more and more respect for you. How can you say something like that to your daughter?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Honestly, dad, nothing you say hurts or surprises me anymore, but I will not let you come between me and my sister.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: That is your sister's child, not yours!", "Zende: Don't listen to him, Nicole. You're going through a lot right now. I know what you're feeling. You're feeling afraid, and you feel helpless, but I am right here, and I ain't going nowhere. You know what? We may not have a family the way we imagined, but we'll get through this together. This is our battle, you and me, husband and wife. You have to stop listening to him.", "Julius: Excuse me? But do you realize that's my daughter you're talking to?", "Zende: Look, I know you were raised to respect your father, and I want you to honor that, but listen to what he is saying to Maya and what he's saying to you. What he's encouraging you to do is not fair to you! It's not fair to Maya, and it's not fair to Lizzy! You cannot let him get in your ear! Baby, I got you. I'm your husband. I always will. Look, you made a promise to them. And you have to keep it. You'll be a mother someday, but not to Lizzy. That man standing right there is Lizzy's father, not me. And the woman standing next to him is Lizzy's mother, your sister, the woman who has been raising her since birth. Now, look, your father, he's wrong. But you can do what's right. Let this go so we can move on with our lives. Sign those adoption papers. Put this behind us."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxMXhZigaoI"}
