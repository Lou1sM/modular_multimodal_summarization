{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7099 ~ John gives Ivy advice about the situation with Liam; Zende & Nicole meet while applying for internships."], "Recap": ["Liam explains to Steffy again that Ivy has dual citizenship so they really are no longer married or have reason to be. He hopes this will make Steffy a little less mad at him. John surprises Ivy by walking in and he is shocked to hear her say that she probably will not be Mrs. Liam Spencer much longer. John says first a quickie wedding and now a quickie divorce. All of this makes no sense. Ridge welcomes Zende with open arms to the office. He is anxious to interview for the Internship his mom, Kristen, told him about. Ridge is glad to have him. He tells Caroline it is so cool that this adopted kid wants to come here and learn the family business. And he wants no favoritism. Nicole waits in line for same internship. She would like a fresh start. She meets and talks to Zende and he says he is lucky to be here. She says she has a few connections around here and she will be happy to help him out and learn about the prestigious Forrester's.", "Ivy tells John that she knows Liam loves Steffy but he loves her too. John tells her that he and her mother never gave up on themselves in all the years so Ivy needs to keep on keeping on. She says she is not giving up and she will not be blindfolded about Steffy. She knows why Liam is drawn to her. John says Steffy has got nothing on her. Liam tells Steffy that he does love Ivy but he does not want to be married so he and Ivy will get an annulment. She wants to know what happens between them. It happened that he is married and he has to own it. He says he will but he sees now just how much he wants to be with her. He is still trying to figure all of this out without hurting anyone in the process. Ivy listens at the door when Steffy asks how he really feels abut Ivy. She walks in and says she'd like to hear that too. Ridge welcomes the four prospective interns in and he introduces them and their qualifications. He is not expecting Nicole and she apologizes for coming at last minute but she does have her resume. She wants to apologize for coming on too strong in her beginnings but she really wants to work hard and be a part of FC. After questioning each of them, Ridge tells them they are all chosen. Nicole finds out that Zende is a Forrester too and was just having fun with them. He tells Nicole he will still need her help and she says it will be her pleasure. Ivy asks Liam if she needs to give him an annulment. He shrugs and says yes that would be for the best. Ivy says she knew his feelings for Steffy and their history and she can not compete with that. But she does know what they have and that he still love her. She will not get down and fight for him. She has more dignity than that and no man is worth that pride so it is up to Liam how they proceed."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Steffy: Say it again. I need to hear it one more time. Say it again.", "Liam: Ivy doesn't need me in order to stay in America.", "Steffy: Wh-- but she's not a citizen. I thought that she would have to go back to --", "Liam: Steffy, there was a mistake. She has dual citizenship. She never could be deported.", "Steffy: So, your marriage is --", "Liam: My marriage to Ivy is over.", "Steffy: It's over?", "Liam: Yes.", "Steffy: Oh, my God.", "Liam: [Chuckles]", "Liam: What did you just say?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: I'm a citizen of the united states.", "Liam: Right. Because we're married.", "Ivy: No. I've always been a citizen. Someone made a huge mistake. I was just informed.", "John: There's my koala bear.", "Ivy: Dad?!", "John: [Laughs]", "Ivy: I didn't even know you were in town.", "John: Surprise! Come on. Give your old padre a squeeze. [Laughs] Oh, my little dumpling! Joined in holy matrimony with young Liam Spencer, huh? [Chuckles] I would have enjoyed walking my only daughter down the aisle, but...boy, you saved me a bundle with that marriage -- that whole wedding thing, huh? So, tell me -- what's it like being Mrs. Spencer? Pumpkin, what's wrong?", "Ivy: I doubt Liam and I are gonna be married for much longer.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: [Gasps]", "Ridge: I like this -- you and me here every minute, every day.", "Caroline: Oh, yeah?", "Ridge: [Chuckles]", "Caroline: You better get used to it.", "Ridge: Yeah?", "Caroline: Yeah. Oh, crap. Uh, we have all those interns coming in today.", "Ridge: Let them wait.", "Caroline: Okay.", "Pam: [Sighs] [Clears throat] Oopsie.", "Ridge: Is that Pam? Really? What are -- do you knock? Can you please --", "Pam: You have a special visitor, Ridge. And I didn't think you'd want to keep a Forrester waiting.", "Ridge: Ah! [Laughs] There he is! Oh, hi! It is so good to see you. [Sighs] This is Zende, Kristen and Tony's kid.", "Caroline: Oh!", "Ridge: This is Caroline.", "Caroline: Hi! So nice to meet you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: You, too.", "Ridge: I'm so glad you're here.", "Ridge: So, this is great. You're interested about learning the family business.", "Zende: Yeah, my mom told me you were interviewing perspective interns, so I flew right out.", "Caroline: Well, something tells me he's a shoo-in.", "Ridge: Now, I told Pam it might be kind of fun if we didn't tell the other interns that you're family. So, you okay with that?", "Zende: I'm game.", "Ridge: Okay. Go get out here. I'll see you in a little bit.", "Zende: Wait. Thanks again for the opportunity, uncle Ridge.", "Ridge: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: Young man. Please take a seat. Would you care for a lemon bar?", "Tobias: No, thank you.", "Pam: Oh, how about you, sweetheart?", "Charlotte: Oh, they look wonderful, but I'm okay.", "Pam: Okay. How about you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kristina: That is really delicious.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: You're hired. Okay. Oh, hey Nicole. You looking for Maya?", "Nicole: No. I'm interviewing for the internship.", "Pam: What? I didn't see your name on the list.", "Nicole: I was hoping for a chance to prove myself, start fresh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "John: I came to congratulate the bride, pop open a bottle of bubbly...", "Ivy: Yeah, well, you might want to hold off.", "John: Well, [Chuckles] First a quickie marriage and now a quickie divorce. Did you and Liam have an argument?", "Ivy: No. No, no. Liam is wonderful.", "John: Then what happened, sugarplum?", "Ivy: Steffy's living back in L.A. She's made it pretty clear that she wants to get back together with Liam, and I think he wants that, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Ivy told you herself, volunteered the information knowing what it can mean for you, for me, and for her?", "Liam: Yeah, that's one thing about Ivy. She's got a lot of integrity. She didn't have to say anything, Steffy, but she did.", "Steffy: Okay, so she gave you an out?", "Liam: 'Cause she knows how I feel about you.", "Steffy: Which is how, exactly?", "Liam: That a trick question?", "Steffy: You married Ivy, Liam. You can't expect me not to be upset.", "Liam: I know. But I won't be married for long. And I am standing in front of you, telling you that I want you in my life. Now, does that make you a little bit less mad at me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: So, Kristen and tony -- they were on their honeymoon when they met Zende, and they adopted him very soon after that.", "Caroline: What a lucky guy.", "Ridge: Lucky for them. He's brought them a lot of joy.", "Caroline: Well, I can only imagine. He seems very determined but also very laid-back.", "Ridge: But how cool is it that he wants to be here and learn about the family business?", "Caroline: No, it's very refreshing that he wants to pave his own path and he doesn't want to take any handouts. It says a lot about his character. I mean, he could very easily take advantage of his big ol' softy uncle Ridge and get a nice salary and a corner office if he wanted.", "Ridge: That -- you -- uh, no, you're right. It probably would happen. But, no, that's not what he wants. He doesn't want favoritism.", "Caroline: Yeah, you don't see that very often, especially not around here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: You got to start somewhere.", "Zende: Hey, I'm Zende, by the way.", "Nicole: Nicole.", "Zende: Nice to meet you.", "Nicole: You, too. So, you nervous?", "Zende: No, not really. I'm more excited than anything.", "Nicole: You do know where you are, right? I mean, this is one of the top fashion houses in the world.", "Zende: Feeling lucky to be here.", "Pam: Nicole, maybe the young man would like to concentrate a little before going in.", "Nicole: Know much about the family, the famous Forrester dynasty?", "Zende: A bit.", "Nicole: Well, believe me, it doesn't get any more prestigious than the Forresters.", "Zende: You know, I hear they're good people.", "Nicole: Do you know how many boutiques they have? Are you familiar with their business model?", "Zende: I like to think I'm pretty well versed.", "Nicole: Zende, Ridge will be asking you a ton of questions, so there's a lot that you need to know. I have a few connections around here, so I'd be happy to help you out.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "John: So, there was a goof? You don't have to be married, but you want to be.", "Ivy: Yeah, I just don't think Liam does. Quinn told me not to say anything, but I-I couldn't have lived with myself, not with that kind of lie.", "John: Handled yourself with grace and virtue... just the way I raised you.", "Ivy: Thanks. I just wish all this Steffy stuff wasn't an issue. I wish Liam just wanted me and only me, but that doesn't seem to be the case.", "John: Well, Prince William has to make up his mind. And if he is as smart as I think, there's no way he's gonna let you slip away.", "Ivy: I'm not counting myself out of this, not by a long shot. Dad, I-I love Liam. I do, and... you know, no matter what he's feeling for Steffy, I know that deep down, he loves me, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: You're saying all this to me -- that you care and you want me back. What about Ivy? She's not here illegally. You don't have to play her husband. But do you have feelings for her?", "Liam: Of course I care about Ivy.", "Steffy: Well, that's what I thought.", "Liam: Well, but I don't want to be married.", "Steffy: [Sighs] Liam, what do you want? What happens next?", "Liam: Well, Ivy and I get an annulment.", "Steffy: It isn't that easy.", "Liam: Uh, yeah, it is, basically. I mean, we have Carter draw up the paperwork, and we just go through and we sign it. That's all we do.", "Steffy: No, no, no. I'm not talking about logistics. What happens with us? Okay, great, great. You get an annulment. But that doesn't change the fact that you married Ivy in the first place.", "Liam: I know. I wish it never had to happen.", "Steffy: Well, it did happen.", "Liam: [Sighs]", "Steffy: And you just have to own it.", "Liam: I own it. I do. I-I made the wrong decision for us. I get that, but you have to realize that all this has just made me see how much I want to be with you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I mean it. If you need any advice, any help whatsoever, I'm available.", "Zende: You seem to know a lot about this place.", "Nicole: Well, it's been like a second home for the last couple months.", "Zende: Nice. So, what have you been doing?", "Nicole: Oh, you know, a little bit of this, little bit of that. Okay, mostly observing, [Chuckles] Soaking up the atmosphere, but nothing official, per se. But I feel like I've got my foot in the door. Built some solid relationships.", "Zende: That's awesome. Good for you.", "Nicole: Well, truth be told, Maya Avant is my sister.", "Zende: The supermodel?", "Nicole: Mm-hmm. She worked her way up here, and I'm determined to do the same. Oh, one thing you should know -- Pam, she might be the receptionist, but she basically runs this joint.", "Zende: Really?", "Nicole: Yep. Knows everything that's going on at all times.", "[Intercom beeps]", "Zende: Thanks for the tip.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: Oh, okay, will do. All right, everybody. Mr. Forrester will see you now. Follow me.", "Nicole: Don't worry. You'll do great.", "Pam: Okay. Come on in. Okay, and now we are all here, Ridge.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Hey, guys. I'm Ridge. This is Caroline. Welcome.", "Caroline: Hi.", "Ridge: Hey, Nicole. We're having a meeting with potential interns.", "Nicole: Yeah, I was hoping that you might consider me.", "Ridge: Uh...well, okay. Well, they've already gone through the application process, so this is not the --", "Nicole: Here's mine with my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and my references. I don't have much experience, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes.", "Ridge: Okay. Well, you're Kristina? Kristina is in her third year of design school. And this must be charlotte. Second year at USC. And Tobias -- he is doing his master's at Berkeley. And...is it Ze--Ze-- tell me your name again. I'm sorry.", "Zende: Zende.", "Ridge: Zende has got a business degree. It's a lot of competition.", "Nicole: I know that my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 isn't as good as theirs, but I wanted to apologize for coming on a little too strong in the past. I not only embarrassed myself, I embarrassed my sister, acting like a big shot, prancing around like I own the place. Ridge, I want to be a part of Forrester, pay my dues, and work my way up. I'm asking you for another chance.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "John: You still believe in Liam? Then, doggone it, don't wave the white flag. Keep on keeping on. How do you think your mother and I managed to stay together all these years?", "Ivy: Uh, well, that's because you two are never in the same city.", "John: No. It's because we never give up on each other, no matter how rough it gets. Now, I'm not saying she hasn't wanted to smother me with a pillow once or twice, but --", "Ivy: But you always find your way back into her good books. I get it.", "John: Exact-a-mundo, my dear. I'm no nincompoop. I'm not gonna let a good woman go. And neither will Liam.", "Ivy: I'm not saying I'm giving up. I'm not. But I can't be blind to all of this, as well. Dad, they have history together. They -- they were married. They lost a child. Look, I understand why Liam is drawn towards her.", "John: Look, kiddo. Either way, you're gonna be okay. You're a strong, intelligent, beautiful young woman. Steffy's got nothing on you.", "Ivy: Dad... thanks.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: You know where I stand. I want us to be together, but I don't see that happening.", "Liam: Okay, so, what are you saying right now? You saying it's too late? You saying I already married Ivy so the damage is done? Just tell me what you need, Steffy. I want you to feel safe. I don't want you questioning this -- what we have together.", "Steffy: I know that you want us to be together. I believe you, but... this open-endedness -- it just -- I don't know. It makes me feel uneasy, Liam.", "Liam: I know. I know that. And I'm doing the best I can. I'm -- I'm just -- I'm trying to figure all this out without hurting everyone in the process.", "Steffy: You're still sorting through your feelings for Ivy. You said there's no reason to be married anymore, but I haven't heard you say the relationship is over. I need to know. Right now. How do you really feel about Ivy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: I'm wondering the same thing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: I'm impressed with", "Ridge: I'm impressed with the credentials, I really am, but I got a few questions to ask. Let's, uh -- Tobias. What's your primary interest, really?", "Tobias: Public relations is my passion, sir.", "Ridge: Okay, what about you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kristina: I've been a fan of Forrester ever since I was a little girl shopping with my mother. Your designs have been my inspiration.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlotte: I agree. Working for you and ms. Spencer -- it'd be a dream of a lifetime.", "Caroline: I-I like her. Sign her up.", "Charlotte: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Zende -- am I saying it right? Am I saying it right?", "Zende: Yes, sir.", "Ridge: Okay. Why are you here?", "Zende: I-I think I dress pretty well, so...", "Ridge: Well, I would have worn a suit, but you're here. But what do you -- what do you know about fashion? What do you know about Forrester?", "Zende: I hear it's a very powerful, very big family.", "Nicole: Um, I think he means what do you know about the company. Uh, Zende and I were talking while we were waiting. He doesn't know much about Forrester, but I can tell he's a good guy, and I think he'd be a great fit.", "Ridge: I'll have to agree. I think all you guys would be a great fit for the company.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tobias: All of us?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Kristina: We all got the internship?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Sure. Why not?", "Caroline: Welcome to Forrester!", "Ridge: Pam, show them around, would you, please?", "Pam: Okay. Come on, newbies. I'll give you the lay of the land.", "Ridge: Hey, not you guys. Come here.", "Caroline: Are you excited?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: You have no idea. I appreciate this so much.", "Ridge: I expect you to work very hard.", "Zende: You got it. And maybe now your mom will visit now that you're here.", "Caroline: Oh, that'd be so nice. We haven't seen her in a really long time.", "Zende: Yeah, she sends her best. My dad, too.", "Nicole: Uh, how do you -- you know his mom?", "Ridge: Yeah, it's my sister.", "Nicole: Wait, you're a Forrester?", "Caroline: Come on.", "Zende: Kristen's my mom.", "Nicole: [Chuckles] No way. And I thought I had connections.", "Zende: Yeah. [Chuckles] Uncle Ridge and I wanted to have a little fun.", "Nicole: [Chuckles] Yeah. Had me fooled. \"Oh, I think I dress pretty well.\" I thought you were done after that answer.", "Zende: [Chuckles] Yeah. Um, it was cool for you to have my back. You know, I still might need your help showing me what's up around here.", "Nicole: It'd be my pleasure.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: So? You told her we don't have to be husband and wife?", "Liam: Yes, I-I told her that the reason we got married was so that you wouldn't be deported, and there's never been any confusion about that, right? Right?", "Ivy: Oh, it's true. I've told you. I don't want you to feel trapped or obliged to be with me. It's not what I'm about.", "Liam: And I appreciate how honest you've been with me.", "Ivy: So, I figure you want to annul the marriage.", "Liam: Yeah, I-I think that would probably be best.", "Steffy: It's only fair to Liam.", "Ivy: Can we -- can we not forget that we were in a relationship long before you came back? And you've tried to get Liam back in the past and been very unsuccessful.", "Steffy: Well, it's different this time, Ivy.", "Ivy: Yeah, I know. I know. I'm not naive. I knew that you marrying me was a huge wake-up call for you, and you're not ready to let go of her yet.", "Liam: O-okay. Maybe -- [Chuckles] Maybe -- maybe we shouldn't have this conversation right now.", "Ivy: No, it's fine.", "Liam: Okay.", "Ivy: I don't like it, but I understand it. You two have history. You have memories and experiences together that I can't compete with. But what I do know is what's between us. And I know that you still love me. I'm not gonna get down and fight with you. No man is worth my dignity. I'm confident in myself enough to know that I deserve more than that. I deserve a man who is 100% committed to me and me only.", "Steffy: We both do.", "Ivy: Liam, I believe in us, the future we can have together, but it all depends on you."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgPYjnJQwuM"}
