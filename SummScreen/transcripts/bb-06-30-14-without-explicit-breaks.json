        "Pam and Charlie brings Oliver and Aly to the Castle for Medieval Knights. With wind howling, thunderstorm brewing, all lights out with only his flashlight, Liam hears a loud noise and checks out the place in and out. When he returns, he falls over something and has a nasty sprain. Enough that he calls Hope and tells her that it's probably not that serious but he's going to healthcare. Quinn comes in late and is questioned by Deacon as to where she has been this late on such a horrible night. She says she let him stay here a while but it does not mean they are going to be BFFs and share all their secrets. She is happy to hear that he went to see Wyatt and gives him a favorable review.",
        "Maya plays the phone message for Rick and Caroline where Oliver says his job is in jeopardy and if he has to date a Forrester, then he's willing to do it. Rick says no way will he stand for this. Caroline is concerned why Maya even taped the convo in the first place. It's not like she is Aly's best friend. And she warns Maya that her husband is not her best friend either so leave him alone. Liam is put on the boot and crutches by his doctor. Hope shows up and he tells her he can not prove it but he thinks Quinn had something to do with this. Hope says he is objective so just tell her what happened. He explains and says he is so sure he saw Quinn's face but now he's not sure he just conjured her up or she is that fast. When he looked around, no one was there. She goes to see Quinn and while Deacon is hiding and listening, Hope asks Quinn pointblank if she was back at Liam's tonight. Quinn denies it. Maya tells Rick that it is better to err on the side of caution and Aly should hear that recording. He agrees. He will not let someone stay on his payroll just to further their career. Maya tells Rick that Oliver monopolizes Aly's time at work. Caroline says they can not throw Oliver under the bus just on Maya's word who secretly recorded this without Oliver's knowing. And as far as Maya she should move on. She is not representing Hope's line by hitting on a married man. Rick says it is best for Aly to know before she gets in any deeper. He will be careful and Oliver will never see this coming. He will be able to tell by a glance or body language, something that will tip him off. Oliver kisses Aly's hand and says he loves everything about this night."

        "Charlie: Good one, dear.",
        "Oliver: So, what does it mean to be blue?",
        "Aly: That's the knight we'll be rooting for. They come in colors.",
        "Pam: Yeah, and he is definitely the best.",
        "Charlie: You just think he's cute.",
        "Pam: Well, I have an appreciation for his cuteness, yes, but don't worry. No knight compares to my Charlie.",
        "Charlie: Oh, stop.",
        "Aly: I can't wait to get to our seats. You're gonna love this... I hope.",
        "Oliver: I already do.",
        "Rick: Did we really just... play that back again.",
        "Oliver: I need to hold on to this job. If that means dating the redheaded Forrester for a bit, I'm willing to do it.",
        "Rick: Aly is crazy about this guy, and Oliver's been encouraging it.",
        "Caroline: Maybe he's sincere.",
        "Rick: Not from what we just heard.",
        "Caroline: Well, why are you up in Oliver's business, anyway?",
        "Maya: It was right after Ridge fired Oliver.",
        "Rick: No, he scared him, and now he's trying to shore up his position by attaching himself to a Forrester, and the most innocent one. No. I will not stand for that.",
        "Charlie: Thank you, wench. [Chuckles]",
        "Oliver: Charlie!",
        "Aly: That's what they're called here.",
        "Oliver: Oh. Uh, where's the silverware, miss...wench?",
        "Aly: [Chuckles] Attached to your wrists, milord.",
        "Oliver: Sorry?",
        "Aly: You're supposed to eat with your hands.",
        "Oliver: For real?",
        "Aly: Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]",
        "Charlie: The entrance there is a portal. You come through, you're in the 11th century.",
        "Aly: No eating utensils back then. The first time you dig in is a little weird, but it's fun. Go ahead.",
        "Pam: Come on.",
        "Oliver: Argh!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Pam: And now that his initiation's over...",
        "Charlie: Let us feast! Yeah!",
        "Aly: Mmm.",
        "Oliver: Mmm.",
        "Liam: [Grunts] [Panting]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Hope: Hey. I was just about to call you.",
        "Liam: Hey, um, I think I sprained my ankle.",
        "Hope: Wh-- how? What happened?",
        "Liam: Ah, it's a stupid, stupid story. I'll fill you in later, but, um [Sighs] I think I'm gonna go to urgent care, okay?",
        "Hope: No, no, don't do that. Let me come get you.",
        "Liam: No, no, no. It's -- it's faster if I just drive myself.",
        "Hope: Okay. Well, I'll -- I'll meet you there, then. Liam, what happened?",
        "Liam: In a word? Quinn.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Deacon: Now, where you coming from?",
        "Deacon: I asked you a question. Was it, uh, another one you're not gonna answer?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] What would you like to know?",
        "Deacon: I wondered where you were. I mean, it is kind of late for, uh, an attractive woman to be walking around alone at night.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] What, are you -- you worried about my virtue?",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Oh, that is so sweet. Don't -- don't worry, though. I have been navigating my own life all by myself for quite some time now.",
        "Deacon: So that's a no.",
        "Quinn: You know, I said you could stay here because I'm nice like that. Doesn't mean we're gonna be BFFs and share all our little secrets.",
        "Deacon: I suppose you're not interested where I was tonight.",
        "Quinn: Any reason I should be?",
        "Deacon: I went to go pay a little visit to Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: And what brought that on?",
        "Deacon: Well, I just figured I'd check the guy out myself. You know, I wanted to surprise him, take measure of him when he wasn't on guard.",
        "Quinn: Did he pass your little test?",
        "Deacon: And then some. He is a very impressive young man.",
        "Quinn: See? I told you.",
        "Deacon: And he's clearly very in love with hope.",
        "Quinn: Yep, and she is in love with him.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, well, that's what you might think. But hope doesn't.",
        "Quinn: That's because Liam's got her brainwashed. What? Okay, I'm sorry. Wrong word. He knows how to control her, emotionally manipulate her. He's always there. He's always in her face, slinging cheap memories and playing on her guilt.",
        "Deacon: You know, you make her sound like she's a puppet.",
        "Quinn: No. That's not what I mean. She's a caring and sensitive young woman, and Liam knows how to manipulate that. He's a spoiled little brat. He's pouty, whiny, likes to hold his breath until he gets what he wants. He doesn't deserve hope. He's just a -- he's a little puppy. He's afraid of his own shadow.",
        "[Footsteps approaching]",
        "Liam: Hey. What's, uh, the verdict? Well, you got yourself a bad sprain.",
        "Liam: Define \"bad.\" Have to wear a boot.",
        "Liam: No. Yeah, use crutches for a while.",
        "Liam: This sucks. Uh, so once you're back home, foot elevated, ice the ankle -- 20 minutes on, 20 off.",
        "Hope: Hi. Hey.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Hope: Are you okay?",
        "Liam: Well, it could be worse. I'll, uh, set you up with the boot and crutches. Be back soon.",
        "Liam: All right. Thank you, doctor. It's a sprain.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Hope: My poor baby.",
        "Liam: Ah.",
        "Hope: Tell me what happened. Did you say it had something to do with Quinn?",
        "Liam: You know, I think so, but I'm not sure.",
        "Caroline: What's your stake in all of this? Why are you secretly recording Oliver, anyway? I'm assuming he doesn't know. That's pretty sneaky.",
        "Maya: I knew how shaken Oliver was after Ridge fired him, and then suddenly, he's all about \"miss F.\" Alarm bells went off. I was concerned.",
        "Caroline: Uh-huh. Because you're so close to Aly.",
        "Maya: I like to think I'm close to all the Forresters.",
        "Caroline: Well, not my husband. He's close to me. You need to understand that.",
        "Rick: It wouldn't be that hard for Oliver to put one over on Aly. He's older than her. He's got more experience, and let's face it -- she's never even had a boyfriend before.",
        "Maya: That's why I'm worried. If Aly had tons of experience with men, she might be able to read a con, but being so innocent and -- and a romantic to boot?",
        "Rick: It allows Oliver to move right in.",
        "Maya: I think concern is appropriate.",
        "[Fanfare plays]",
        "Pam: Prepare to be transported.",
        "Oliver: Bring it on!",
        "Pam: [Chuckles]",
        "Charlie: It really does feel like we're stepping back in time.",
        "Pam: Yes.",
        "Aly: You are being such a good sport.",
        "Oliver: It's not like that. I am having a blast.",
        "Aly: You really mean it?",
        "Oliver: This is awesome.",
        "Pam: Well, just wait till things kick off.",
        "Charlie: Should happen any second now.",
        "Oliver: What am I about to see?",
        "Pam: [Gasps] Here we go!",
        "[Applause]",
        "[Dramatic music plays]",
        "Both: Go, blue!",
        "Charlie: Go, blue! Welcome -- welcome once again ruler of this land and lord of this castle, his majesty the king!",
        "Pam: The king!",
        "Charlie: The king!",
        "[Cheers and applause] My friends, it is now my honor to present to you the fairest lady in the realm. All hail her royal highness Princess Catalina.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Charlie: Ooh.",
        "Pam: [Talking indistinctly] As well you know, your majesty, nobility gathers at your tables this eve for your celebration. Yet many arrive in celebrations of their own. I speak, of course, of birthdays, of anniversaries. Why, some of your guests this very eve have been raised to knight and lady of the realm, and so we honor them.",
        "[Spectators murmur] Welcome, troop 3371 from rancho Cucamonga.",
        "[Applause] Tom and Ellen white are here on their honeymoon!",
        "[Applause] Why?",
        "[Laughter] And welcome to rd Oliver Jones on your very first visit to the castle.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[Fanfare plays]",
        "Liam: I'm trying really hard not to be, like, paranoid.",
        "Hope: Okay, well, I'm objective. Tell me what happened.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Okay. Well, I -- you know, I was already kind of unsettled. Quinn had been by with her weirdness, and, uh, I'm hearing coyotes howling outside. The Santa Anas are blowing.",
        "Hope: Ugh, those winds freak me out.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, you know, and the house is making noises. You know, it's old. It -- it creaks. Um, anyway, so I'm doing my nightly ritual. I'm going around. I'm -- I'm checking all the windows and doors, making sure they're locked, and I'm sure about this, by the way. They were locked. I get into bed, and all of a sudden, I hear a noise like it's coming from inside the house.",
        "Hope: You're freaking me out right now. You're giving me chills.",
        "Liam: Well, right? I -- so, I grab a flashlight. I go -- I check all the windows and doors again. Sure enough, you know the sliding glass by the kitchen?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: It's open, and, um, I shine my light...I-I swear right into Quinn's face. It was Quinn.",
        "Hope: So she was there.",
        "Liam: Well, that's the thing. I-I mean, I got startled, right? So I dropped the flashlight, and by the time I picked it up and was shining it in the door again, there was nothing. Nobody. You -- you see what I mean? I-I can't be sure. I don't know if I just -- I had Quinn on the brain, and I, like, conjured her... or if -- if she's just that fast.",
        "[Grinder buzzing]",
        "Caroline: How do you want to handle this?",
        "Rick: In a way that best protects Aly. She's my niece. You know, life hasn't dealt her a great hand, and I'm not gonna let someone on our payroll, no less, play her to secure a position here, no matter how much I like the guy.",
        "Maya: I think that's smart. When you're dealing with someone as fragile as Aly, it's better to err on the side of caution.",
        "Rick: Which is why you brought that recording to me.",
        "Maya: I'm glad you understand.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Will you send it to me?",
        "Maya: Right away.",
        "Caroline: Who are you calling?",
        "Rick: Aly. I want to see if she's with Oliver. It went straight to voicemail.",
        "Maya: They're probably together...as we speak.",
        "[Dramatic music plays]",
        "[Spectators groan] Another lance, another pass, my lords.",
        "Pam: Ohh!",
        "[Spectators groan] Well-struck, my lord dismounts.",
        "Charlie: He's so dead. He's so dead.",
        "[Fanfare plays]",
        "[Dramatic music plays]",
        "Pam: Oh, no! No, no, no, no! Ohh!",
        "Oliver: Aah! [Chuckles]",
        "Aly: Intense, right?",
        "Oliver: Awesome.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Both: Whoo!",
        "[Grinder buzzing]",
        "Deacon: What are you making?!",
        "Quinn: Whoa! Man, you have got to stop creeping up on me like that. Stop. Don't touch --",
        "Deacon: Pretty handy with this thing, aren't you?",
        "Quinn: It's one of the essential tools of my trade. What do you want?",
        "Deacon: I was just --",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Hope: Quinn? Quinn, are you here?",
        "Quinn: Go. Go, go. Uh, yeah. Yeah -- yeah, hope. Come on in. Hey. Hey. It's a welcome surprise, but, you know, Wyatt isn't here.",
        "Hope: Came to see you.",
        "Quinn: Yeah? Oh, well, you want to sit down? I can...",
        "Hope: No, no, I'm not gonna be here that long. I just have a question.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Shoot.",
        "Hope: Did you go back to Liam's tonight?",
        "Quinn: Mm, no. I said everything that I wanted to say earlier. There was no reason to go back.",
        "Hope: Really? Okay, well, uh, he says he saw you.",
        "Quinn: Where?",
        "Hope: Lurking around outside in the dark...",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: ...For what reason, I really can't imagine, but, uh, I've got to wonder. Is it true, Quinn? Were you at Liam's tonight?",
        "Maya: Oliver and Aly have been spending a lot of time together lately. You guys don't see it, but he basically monopolizes her time at work. I can't tell you the number of times I've walked in on them, heads together, touching.",
        "Caroline: Okay, look, I am not defending Oliver. If he really is using Aly, then he needs to be stopped. It's unforgivable. But what I am saying is that we can't just throw him under the bus based on Maya's say-so. Clearly, she can't be trusted, which I called from the beginning.",
        "Maya: I did not make up what's on that recording.",
        "Rick: Oliver's voice. Oliver's words.",
        "Caroline: Nicely coached by Maya, pretending to be his friend, while secretly recording him. Who does that?",
        "Maya: I was looking out for Aly.",
        "Caroline: And why should we believe you? You're obviously not trustworthy. You just hit on my husband while engaged to carter!",
        "Maya: I know. It was totally wrong.",
        "Caroline: Then why did you do it?",
        "Maya: I made a mistake.",
        "Caroline: More like a miscalculation.",
        "Maya: It won't happen again.",
        "Caroline: No, it won't, especially if you're not here. That's right, Maya. I think you should go. You are so far off message, you are anti-message. Hope for the Future encourages girls to have values and principles, not to hit on married men in a public place.",
        "Rick: The steam room was ill-advised, okay? But it's not a fireable offense. Just don't let it happen again. I'm just more concerned whether or not Oliver's actually using Aly or not.",
        "Caroline: It's entirely possible that he could be genuinely into her.",
        "Rick: Speculation's not good enough for me. I want answers.",
        "Caroline: Are you gonna go talk to him?",
        "Rick: Yeah, as soon as possible. And do me a favor, Maya. Don't talk to Aly. Don't play that recording. We don't want to be triggering any bad reaction. We know how vulnerable she can be.",
        "Maya: Understood.",
        "Caroline: Okay, if Oliver really is playing Aly, what makes you think that he would tell you?",
        "Rick: I mean, come on. People have tells. Shift in a glance, body language. Oliver's not gonna see me coming, and, trust me, I will be paying attention.",
        "Caroline: I just hate thinking of Oliver as that calculating.",
        "Rick: I know. Me, too. But it's better to know before Aly gets in any deeper, right?",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Charlie: Whoo-hoo!",
        "Pam: Whoo! Go, blue! Blue!",
        "Charlie: Go, blue!",
        "Pam: Blue!",
        "Charlie: Blue, blue!",

        "Aly: Carnation. How romantic. Someday.",
        "Both: Whoo-hoo!",
        "Pam: What did we tell you?",
        "Charlie: I mean, were we right, or were we right?",
        "Oliver: Crazy fun.",
        "Aly: You really like it?",
        "Oliver: You didn't think I would?",
        "Aly: No.",
        "Oliver: Aly. I love everything about this night."
