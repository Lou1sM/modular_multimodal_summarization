    "Recap": [
        "Nicole shows Zende around. He hasn't been in the building for a long time so it's all pretty new to him and he's impressed with the Roof Top Lounge and all. He teases her but finally says he was adopted and he's a Forrester. She is sorry to hear the back story with his parents dying of AIDS. But Tony and Kristen visited his orphanage and adopted him. Aly wishes Ivy had told her so she could have been at the wedding. Ivy tells her no big deal as the marriage is going to be annulled. Aly can not believe Liam would marry her if he had feelings for Steffy. Ivy tells Aly that Liam stepped up and kept her from being deported. Then she found out she could not be deported after all. She wanted to be married to Liam someday but not like this. She is not giving up and she will not just hand him over to Steffy. Caroline stops in to see Maya and both welcome each other back in the office. Then they get honest about being back and how it feels seeing each other. She reminds Caroline that she was kissing Ridge and covering it up. Maya says her childhood was a lie and she is a woman and this is the truth. Rick has always known her as a woman, the real \"me\". Steffy jokes with Liam about his marriage. Carter married them and now he is drawing up the annulment papers, he should get some sort of discount. Liam asks that she not joke about this. So then she starts that Ivy needs to dye her hair blonde so he could tell them apart and her vie for his attention. She repeats again that she is not going to fight Ivy for him but as long as there is an annulment that is another story. Aly tells Ivy that she is too nice but she is not. Deep down Liam is a good man and there is no way he will pick slutty Steffy over her. Steffy models some lingerie for Liam who thinks she looks hot and it will sell out immediately. Aly walks in and sees the closeness and barks at Steffy to take her hands off of Liam. She tells Liam that he should see what Steffy is doing in trying to take him away from Ivy. She harasses Steffy for parading around in her underwear although Steffy reminds her they are working and this is her lingerie line.",
        "Maya tells Caroline that Rick knows about her past and he chose her anyway, so let that be the answer. Caroline says now he does but she kept the truth from him for a long time. Maya says she left the job and the man she loved because at that time she thought it was for the best so Caroline can call her any names she wants to .take her best shot and go ahead and hurt her if she can. She tells Caroline to tell her how horrible she is. Caroline won't but she says she does know how painful that was at that time in her life. She was judged by both her and Rick and now it brings up very bitter feelings for her. She does not agree how Maya handled things. But she is happy now and she only wants Rick to be happy too and if he found that in her, then even though she thinks Maya is a hypocrite she does respect her that she has become the woman she wanted to be. She opines that Maya is one kick-ass woman and they hug."

        "Maya: Yeah, I'm looking at the schedule. Uh, yeah. It's a huge first day back. No, no. It's fine. I'm thrilled, actually, and I'm ready to jump in with both feet. [Chuckles] Oh, thank you. That's so sweet. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I'll see you soon.",
        "Caroline: Welcome back.",
        "Maya: Same to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: Whoa. This is new. [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: It is? [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: Yeah, keep in mind I haven't been in this building since I was a kid.",
        "Nicole: Oh, right. Well, people come up here sometimes with their work to get some fresh air, eat, work out, whatever.",
        "Zende: Wait, didn't I see a gym on the first floor?",
        "Nicole: It's a big building. I guess they need two gyms. [Chuckles] Especially in Los Angeles. Everybody's working on their beach body. [Chuckles] Just like Miami.",
        "Nicole: Oh, is that where you're from?",
        "Zende: Yep. You're looking at me funny. Judging whether or not I'm ready for the beach? Because I'll hit those weights.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] Um, no. I'm just trying to figure out the family ties. Your mom's really a Forrester? [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I still can't believe you didn't call me. I would have thrown on a dress and grabbed some flowers from the garden. Instant bridesmaid.",
        "Ivy: Look, it really was very sudden, Aly. I wasn't really thinking about things like that.",
        "Aly: Well, best idea ever -- have another ceremony.",
        "Ivy: What? No.",
        "Aly: Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on. Think about the rest of us. We just want to celebrate with you and Liam.",
        "Ivy: Aly, there really isn't anything to celebrate. The marriage is being annulled.",
        "Aly: Why?",
        "Ivy: Because Liam still has feelings for Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You think the world's ready?",
        "Liam: For what?",
        "Steffy: We keep going back and forth on it. Another Forrester lingerie line.",
        "Liam: Uh. Yeah. Well, trust me, the world is always ready to see Steffy Forrester in more lingerie.",
        "Steffy: Unh-unh. Be careful.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Be careful?",
        "Steffy: An old married man like you -- can you handle it? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Come on.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Steffy...",
        "Steffy: You're getting an annulment. You can joke about it now, right?",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I...don't understand. He married you. He wouldn't do that if he had feelings for Steffy.",
        "Ivy: Oh, my gosh. There's so much to catch you up on. Um... I was getting deported, Aly.",
        "Aly: Deported?! Ivy --",
        "Ivy: No. Aly, it's fine. It's all fine now. I mean, it was pretty scary for a little while.",
        "Aly: So, Liam stepped up. He married you so you could stay.",
        "Ivy: That's the only reason, though. He never would have married me otherwise.",
        "Aly: Because of Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: So, how's the annulment?",
        "Liam: Well, I spoke to Carter. He's -- he's drawing up the paperwork.",
        "Steffy: Handy having Carter around. He should give you a two-for-one discount. You booked him for your wedding. He should give you half-off on the divorce.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Hey, could we, um, not joke about my marriage anymore? I just -- I... I wanted to help Ivy.",
        "Steffy: I know. And I know you don't like the idea of hurting her. But don't kid yourself. You jumped at the chance to annul the marriage.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Yeah, I did.",
        "Steffy: Here's the thing -- if you're planning to carry a teeny tiny torch for Ivy, I suggest she dyes her hair blond.",
        "Liam: Why?",
        "Steffy: I prefer battling blondes for your attention. It's easy to tell us apart.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I think I've seen a picture of your mom. Short black hair?",
        "Zende: Uh, that's my Aunt Felicia. My mom's the blonde.",
        "Nicole: Oh. Okay. So, then you obviously take after your dad?",
        "Zende: Well, maybe a little. Uh, I never really saw the resemblance. You know, maybe in the eyes? You know, there was a -- there were whispers about an affair with the mailman. Makes me wonder if... well, you know. [Laughs] I'm kidding. I'm adopted.",
        "Nicole: What?!",
        "Zende: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: So, uh...man, I-I just couldn't believe it when I heard. You were just walking along and...",
        "Caroline: Wham! Yeah, just out of nowhere.",
        "Maya: That's horrible. I can't imagine. But you're up and about.",
        "Caroline: Well, yeah. Uh, you know, a little bit more every single day, and it's a huge thanks to Ridge, really. I mean...",
        "Maya: Oh, you can say it.",
        "Caroline: Say what?",
        "Maya: That I wasn't honest with Rick. That I was using him and manipulating him.",
        "Caroline: Were you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: After I found out I have dual citizenship, I realized I didn't have to be married to Liam. Part of me didn't want to tell him.",
        "Aly: And Quinn encouraged that. I still can't believe you talked to her.",
        "Ivy: It just -- it just -- it all felt wrong, you know? I actually really want to be married to Liam someday, but not -- not like this.",
        "Aly: So, you're not giving up.",
        "Ivy: No. [Chuckles] No, of course not. I-I love Liam, and I know that he cares about me. I'm not gonna just hand him over to Steffy.",
        "Aly: Good. Don't give up. Keep fighting for him. There is no way that Liam would choose Taylor's slutty daughter over you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Just to be clear, there's no battle going on.",
        "Steffy: You must not have heard Ivy earlier. She still believes you guys have a future. You might not think there's a battle brewing, but she certainly does. I'm not happy about it. When I first found out you married Ivy, I told you I'm not gonna wait around for you to decide who you want. But now that you're getting an annulment... we'll see. Now, let's get back to work.",
        "Liam: Is that not what we've been doing?",
        "Steffy: Oh, budgets and all this? No, no, no. That's boring. I have a much better use of our time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: Okay, the look on your face -- I mean...",
        "Nicole: Look, I'm not usually that gullible, I swear. The mailman? [Chuckles] Anyway. You ever try tracking down your birth parents?",
        "Zende: They, uh -- they're gone.",
        "Nicole: Oh, my gosh. Me and my big mouth. I'm really sorry I --",
        "Zende: It's fine. You know, I don't mind talking about it. Both of my parents died of AIDS, my little brother, too.",
        "Nicole: I am so sorry. How old were you?",
        "Zende: Six. And you're probably too polite to ask, so I'll just tell you. No, I'm not HIV-positive. But my dad is. Tony, I mean. I think that helped him feel a connection to me when we met. They were on their honeymoon. And I saw her drop a roll of film.",
        "[Zende's flashback]",
        "Kristen: My film. My gosh, but I dropped that all the way in town.",
        "Zende: I brought it back for you.",
        "Tony: What's your name, little man?",
        "Zende: Zende.",
        "Tony: Zende. I'm Tony.",
        "Zende: It's very nice to meet you.",
        "[Present time]",
        "Zende: They visited me the next day at the orphanage.",
        "[Zende's flashback]",
        "Zende: Welcome. Please come in.",
        "Kristen: Thank you.",
        "Zende: This is my home.",
        "Kristen: Wow. Got a full house.",
        "Zende: These are just the babies. The older ones are outside.",
        "[Present time]",
        "Zende: I thought that would be the last I saw of them. Lucky for me, I was wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I don't expect you to understand. But I didn't feel like I was lying.",
        "Caroline: That's interesting, you know, because... you were so involved with Ridge and -- and with me and the innocent kisses. You were obsessed, even, you know? And -- and I suffered because of your accusations.",
        "Maya: But you did lie. And the kisses weren't that innocent, were they? You were cheating, and you were doing everything you could to cover it up.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, but... what you were trying to cover up was a-a little more intense.",
        "Maya: No. No, I -- you know, I'm a woman. And I've always felt like a woman in my heart. My childhood was lie. Being raised a boy was a lie, but this -- the woman Rick fell in love with? This is truth. This is me. Rick has only ever known the real me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Aly, there is no need for name calling.",
        "Aly: Maybe you're too nice to say the truth, but I'm not. Steffy uses her body to get what she wants. Liam doesn't want to be with someone like that. He'll make the right choice, the decent choice, because deep down, Liam is a good man. He proved that by marrying you when you needed help. He'll prove it again. At least, he better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Note number one -- takes too long to change into.",
        "Steffy: Uh, excuse me?",
        "Liam: Yeah, how long have you been back there?",
        "Steffy: Somebody's eager to see me in lingerie. Geez. So?",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, note number two -- it'll sell out fast.",
        "Steffy: Really? You think?",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah. It's beautiful.",
        "Steffy: Okay, note number three -- the underwire is a little uncomfortable, but other than that, I think -- yeah.",
        "Liam: Other than that, I think it's a winner.",
        "Steffy: Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: So, Tony and Kristen go to Africa on a honeymoon and come back with a kid?",
        "Zende: Not quite. They flew home. They realized they couldn't possibly live without me, you know?",
        "Nicole: Oh, right. [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: I don't know. I guess them seeing the orphanage really affected them.",
        "Nicole: They flew all the way back.",
        "Zende: Yeah.",
        "[Zende's flashback]",
        "Tony: We came back for something we left behind.",
        "Kristen: We got back to Los Angeles, and we missed you. We missed you so much. And we figured since you're living here without any parents and we're living there without any children, it made us sad. So, we decided that, um -- that you could come live with us and be our son.",
        "[Present time]",
        "Zende: [Chuckles] Got my first passport that day with my new name on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Rick knows about my past, and he chose to stay with me. So, let that answer whether or not you think I was lying.",
        "Caroline: He knows about it now, but you kept it from him for so long.",
        "Maya: And I regret that. He was upset that so many people knew before him. But when your uncle was trying to do his worst, I did what I thought was best. I left the company, I severed all ties, I left the job and the man that I love because that's what I thought was best for Rick, the man I love. So, go ahead. Say whatever you want to say, whatever names -- Myrna, Myra, whatever else you've thought up since you've learned about my past. Take your best shot, Caroline. Go ahead and hurt me, if you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: So, what do you think about the fabric?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I think there's not much to think about.",
        "Steffy: No, you -- you have to feel it.",
        "Liam: All right. What little there is of it.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah...",
        "Aly: Take your hands off of him!",
        "Liam: Aly, don't worry. This is just work.",
        "Aly: [Scoffing] Oh, you call this work? Steffy prancing around in her underwear?",
        "Steffy: Actually, it's for the lingerie line, and I was hardly prancing.",
        "Aly: Can't you -- can't you see what she's doing? She's trying to take Ivy away from you.",
        "Liam: No, no, no, no, no. This has nothing to do with Ivy.",
        "Aly: You care about her. I know you do. How can you just push her aside now that Steffy's back jiggling around the office?",
        "Steffy: Ooh, Aly, you are way out of line.",
        "Aly: No, you're out of line, Steffy. You know, I thought things would change around here with you and Ridge in charge, but I was wrong. All we did was exchange a tyrant for a slut.",
        "Steffy: Oh, sit down, Aly.",
        "Aly: I will not let you do this. I will not let you ruin Liam and Ivy's lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I have no right to complain about my childhood ever again. What you what through -- I can't even -- [Sighs] There's no comparison.",
        "Zende: Hey, we all got to do what we got to do. And I'm guessing you haven't had the easiest time, either... related to Maya.",
        "Nicole: What do you mean? You have a problem with Maya?",
        "Zende: I just can't believe you're her sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Go ahead. Tell me how horrible I am and how wrong I was to keep this part of my past from Rick.",
        "Caroline: I mean, I don't need to do that, Maya. [Sniffles] You already know those things. You do. If you don't want to call it lying, that's fine. I-I disagree. [Sniffles] Because you let a man fall in love with you without knowing the full truth, and that's lying -- it is.",
        "Maya: I don't think you understand how complicated it is.",
        "Caroline: No, I don't think that you understand [Voice breaking] how painful that time in my life was for me. My marriage was falling apart and I was humiliated... and judged by you and by Rick. So to find all this out now?! It brings up some very bitter feelings for me. I don't approve of how you handled things. I don't. But I moved on now. And I'm happy. I am. I'm happy with Ridge. And I'm realizing that I -- I want Rick to be happy, too, and... I want Rick to find a woman that makes him happy. And he found that in you. Because you are -- you are a beautiful and courageous woman. I have two moms. I was ridiculed growing up, too. I mean, kids are mean. They're terrible. You -- I don't have to tell you that. They're awful. I never felt like I fit in. I always -- I always was an outsider looking in, and... I can't even begin to compare that to what you must have been through. I can't even begin to know what that must have been like for you. I can't. So, yeah, I think you lied. Yes, and -- [Sighs] I think you're a hypocrite, but I respect you. And I admire you because you had the strength and the courage to become the person that you are today -- someone that Rick is proud of. Because you persevered, Maya. You did that, and I have to tell you -- you are one kick-ass woman. I like you just the way you are."
