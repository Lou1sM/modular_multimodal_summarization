Liam says Jarrett is thrilled and Wyatt adds that he is not going to be writing a bad review. Thomas reminds Sally they need to work hard as they need to really compete with FC. Steffy calls Thomas and asks if he knows about the Monte Carlo shooting. He says yes but he's not going to make that. He tells Sally again they need to get going on this. They have to do something huge and he will take a page from her book. Eric tells Ridge that Quinn is the reason for the spring in his steps nowadays. And he started to offer to model some of the swimwear but he did not want to show up the boys. He remarks they got so far behind when Spectra stole everything but it has thrown them together again to design and that is a good thing. Quinn asks again why Sheila is there in her home. Sheila asks if is she feeling guilty and does she have anything to feel guilty about. Sheila remarks she only wants Eric's happiness. Quinn says they are very happy so Sheila has no worry. Sheila says okay, it is Eric and Ridge. Quinn wonders what she is getting at. Sheila says likewise that Quinn has nothing to worry about. Charlie is shocked when he asks about Sheila and Pam shows him the picture and he sees it is the woman he has been speaking with about Eric. Quinn calls Ridge and tells him she needs to see him right away; they have a huge problem. Sheila searches the internet and says \u0096 Quinn and Ridge, how could she betray him.", "Quinn fills Ridge in about Sheila and how she is asking so many questions about Ridge living in the guest house. She is afraid she knows about them and their secret. Jarrett tells Steffy she is a genius for this swimsuit in Monte Carlo showing. Steffy says she wishes she could take credit but it was Katie's idea. Sheila corners Charlie and says they need to talk. He wants no part of her but she keeps hounding that she only wants what is best for Eric and Quinn is acting guilty as hell. They need to get back to the Forrester Estate right now. Thomas laments to Sally they need to get in there and make a splash at FC. Katie says they still have a lot to pull off and she asks Wyatt for his help. She tells him that she feels badly for taking all the credit. He tells her to stop it; it was her idea. Charlie drives up to Eric's but stops and says he is very uncomfortable with this situation. This is Sheila's worry, not his and he does not want to lose his job over this. She says if something is going on with Quinn then Eric has a right to know especially if it also involves his son. Ridge tells Quinn that she needs to get a grip on herself. Stop imagining all of this. Sheila has not been here long enough to know anything. Quinn says she is dangerous and there is no telling what she might do. Sheila keeps after Charlie while looking thru her binoculars at the house. She badgers Charlie if he knows anything then he better tell her ..something is going on between Quinn and Ridge and Charlie knows and needs to tell her."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Steffy: We, uh, almost ready?", "Katie: Yeah, uh, just doing a little tech and setting some lighting. We're good to go.", "Liam: Yeah, and Jarrett should be here soon with his crew.", "Steffy: Okay.", "Wyatt: Don't worry, dad's not gonna write a false review or anything...", "Liam: Dude.", "Wyatt: What? Is it too soon? I thought it was kind of funny.", "Steffy: Are the reps from the charity here?", "Katie: Yes, and they're very excited.", "Liam: And appreciative, apparently.", "Wyatt: They should do well in Monte Carlo.", "Steffy: Well, keep up the good work. I know this calendar shoot is kind of a test run, but I want everyone to give it their all. I bet Thomas is regretting his decision to try to save spectra right about now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: I can't get over it. This is me and my company with class written all over it.", "Thomas: That's the idea.", "Sally: Well, you did a beautiful job. Thank you for making me feel so successful.", "Thomas: It's just a logo. But with these, our designs -- you will absolutely be successful.", "Sally: Well, how can we miss with my stud designer?", "Thomas: There are plenty of ways that we can miss this. We've got to be able to compete realistically with Forrester creations and Steffy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Sounds like everything's going great up there. The photo shoot's about to start.", "Eric: You know, they asked me to model some of the swimwear, but I passed. I didn't want to upstage the boys, you know, rick or carter...", "Ridge: I think you look great in a bathing suit. I'd buy a calendar with you on the cover.", "Eric: I'm not so sure that the charity we represent would, uh, actually appreciate that.", "Ridge: I know someone who would appreciate it.", "Eric: I appreciate her, too. Quinn is the reason for the spring in my step these days.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: So, what are you doing here, Sheila? Besides your obvious attempt to intimidate me.", "Sheila: Intimidate you? Is that how you're feeling? Because that's not my intention.", "Quinn: [Laughs] Okay, then what exactly is your intention?", "Sheila: I'm just a friend of Eric's. Do I need more of a reason?", "Quinn: Well, he's my husband, and this is inappropriate. I shouldn't have to point that out to you.", "Sheila: I'm not here to hit on him. I just want Eric's happiness.", "Quinn: Which is exactly what I want.", "Sheila: Really? Then why do you seem so uncomfortable? Nervous. I mean, dare I say guilty? Is there something you should feel guilty about?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: Hey, everybody.", "Maya: Hi!", "Carter: Where's Zende? I thought he was part of this.", "Rick: Oh, he's busy designing for the fashion show in Monte Carlo.", "Ivy: Yeah, they'll shoot his setup later.", "Maya: Yeah, no free pass for Zende.", "Rick: Nope.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: Yeah, not with that body.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laughter]", "Liam: Yes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Cell phone rings]", "Thomas: Yeah?", "Steffy: How's it going?", "Thomas: Oh, creative freedom, dreams coming true, everything I've ever wanted? Fantastic.", "Steffy: You heard about the Monte Carlo showing?", "Thomas: Yeah, no, I'm not gonna be able to make that.", "Steffy: Did I say you were invited?", "Thomas: Didn't say I wanted to come.", "Steffy: [Scoffs] Where's spectra holding theirs? In the middle of nowhere?", "Thomas: Hmm. Funny.", "Steffy: Well, uh, we're doing a shoot for charity. Jarrett's streaming it live if you want to check it out, see what you're missing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: The princess?", "Thomas: Only and only.", "Sally: What?", "Thomas: We have to get buzz going about this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: Don't get me wrong, Charlie. I respect Eric so much for his willingness to forgive and, you know, think that people can change, but to invite her back in the house... look, it's all right here on the internet. I mean, she has been in prison more than once. And she has done so much to hurt my family.", "Charlie: So, you got a picture of this, uh, black widow?", "Pam: Um... right there.", "Charlie: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, god. That's Sheila carter?", "Pam: Yeah. Why?", "Charlie: Oh! Remember I was telling you that woman at the restaurant asking all the questions about the Forresters and Eric?", "Pam: Y-you mean... that was Sheila? Well, you didn't tell her anything, did you, Charlie? What did she ask you?", "Charlie: I don't know...", "Pam: Charlie! Tell me. What have you done?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I want you to leave.", "Sheila: You're upset.", "Quinn: Of course I'm upset. My husband's ex-wife shows up at my house and tells me how much she cares about my husband.", "Sheila: As I said, I just want Eric's happiness.", "Quinn: Well, that's my job. I'm his wife, and we are very happy.", "Sheila: You and Eric... and ridge.", "Quinn: What are you getting at, Sheila?", "Sheila: Nothing. As long as you are a loving, devoted wife, you have nothing to worry about, Quinn. Goodbye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: You know, things got pretty rough there, even before the shootings. Spectra stole our whole line. You and I had to bounce back. We worked our tails off, didn't we? And now Katie's heading up this whole new swimwear concept, and you and I are still designing together. Quinn is by my side.", "Ridge: Not too bad, huh?", "Eric: Not bad at all.", "[Cell phone rings]", "Quinn: Are you at the office with your father?", "Ridge: Yes.", "Quinn: I need to see you. Now.", "Ridge: Is there a problem?", "Quinn: Huge. I'm at the house. Can you just please get here as quickly as you can?", "Ridge: I'll be right there.", "Eric: Another fire to put out?", "Ridge: Something like that.", "Eric: Want some help?", "Ridge: Not on this one.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: That call from Steffy.", "Thomas: Yeah.", "Sally: Have you guys always been competitive in that way?", "Thomas: I mean, I could swim the entire length of a pool holding my breath before she could.", "Sally: Whoo! My hero.", "Thomas: Yes, I am twice her size and her older brother, so it doesn't really mean anything, but yeah, we are competitive. And it brings out the best in us. For instance, Forrester's on top right now. And we have to compete with them, but how? I mean, we have to do something that is complete spectra and completely unique. I've got an idea. And it's a page right out of your book.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jarrett: That was wonderful! I loved it. Just give me that one one more time.", "Steffy: Okay. We've got swimsuits, sun, and a whole lot of fun coming up on \"eye on fashion.\"", "Jarrett: Wonderful! Thank you!", "Steffy: Great. That was it?", "Jarrett: Yes. Thank you. Okay, uh, go grab some b-roll and behind-the-scenes shots, please. Thank you. Great. So, um, the, uh, Spencer brothers tell me that this calendar shoot is a teaser, an exclusive for us, but that's it. So, uh, a teaser for what, exactly?", "Steffy: Well, it's, uh... it's kind of a party on the beach in Monte Carlo.", "Jarrett: Really?", "Steffy: Well, yeah. It's a beach party and it's a fashion show and charity event all rolled into one.", "Katie: We're collaborating with Spencer publications at the upcoming summit.", "Jarrett: Steffy, you are a genius.", "Steffy: Oh, I -- I wish I could take the credit, but actually that goes to Katie Logan, our new head of pr. It was her brainchild.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: I can tell you one person that likes Quinn just fine. Ridge. Quinn is a-okay with ridge.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sheila: No... ridge and Quinn? How could do they betray Eric like that?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Sheila carter came here?", "Quinn: She barged in like she was part of the family. The woman is horrible!", "Ridge: If my dad doesn't put an end to her coming over...", "Quinn: No, no, no, no, no. You cannot bring your father into this.", "Ridge: Why? She's coming here to see him.", "Quinn: No! She came here to see me.", "Ridge: No, she barely knows you.", "Quinn: She thinks she does. You should have heard the things she was saying.", "Ridge: Like what?", "Quinn: She was...probing. About the house -- who lives here and who doesn't. And then she was asking questions about you.", "Ridge: About me?", "Quinn: About you. Living in the guest house. [Sighs] I know -- I know you're gonna think this sounds crazy, but the way she was talking makes me think she knows about us, about our secret.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sheila: Charlie, we need to talk.", "Charlie: How'd you get on the premises?", "Sheila: I told you. I'm a friend of the family.", "Charlie: You're no friend of the family, and you're certainly no friend of mine. Come on. Let me escort you --", "Sheila: No, no, no! Stop! This is important.", "Charlie: I'll bet it is, Sheila carter.", "Sheila: You know my name. Well, of course you would. I mean, you're a security expert.", "Charlie: What do you want?", "Sheila: I think you're right. I think you're onto something, Charlie.", "Charlie: I never said I was onto anything.", "Sheila: No, no. It's okay. I'm on your side. It's about ridge and Quinn. I think something might be going on behind Eric's back involving his wife and his son.", "Charlie: What do you want?", "Sheila: I want what's best for Eric. He's too good. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't do something to try and help him.", "Charlie: Like what?", "Sheila: You know, I had an interesting conversation earlier with Quinn, and I want to tell you what, she was acting like a woman who was guilty as hell. I want to talk to ridge.", "Charlie: He's not here. He left a little while ago.", "Sheila: [Scoffs] Well, Quinn probably called him right after our talk! Come on, Charlie. Let's go!", "Charlie: Go where?", "Sheila: Your car. I want you to take me to the Forrester estate.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Wait, you're serious about this? I thought we agreed, no more underhand.", "Thomas: Oh, no, no, no. It's not underhanded. Chalk it up to some friendly competition.", "Sally: Well, I'm always up for friendly competition, but Steffy, not so much.", "Thomas: Mm-hmm. Well, it is a swimwear shoot, so why don't we go in there and make a splash?", "Sally: [Giggles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Nice addition to the company, isn't she, Jarrett?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jarrett: It's brilliant, Katie. Elegance, fashion, and a beach party to boot? It's the embodiment of Forrester. How did you come up with it?", "Katie: Well, um...", "Wyatt: She's a Logan. Need I say more?", "Katie: I'm honored that Eric asked me to head up pr. I actually started in public relations, so it's nice to get back to my roots. But we have a lot to pull off, so, um, could you give me a hand, Wyatt?", "Wyatt: I'll give you both if you ask nicely.", "Jarrett: So, um -- the Spencer summit.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Ah, yes, only the largest gathering of the greatest minds in the world. What about it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: [Chuckles] Spoken like a true Spencer.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: Add to that some of the greatest fashions in the world.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: And the fattest wallets. We're ready when you are.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I feel bad taking all the credit for this.", "Wyatt: What are you talking about? This was your idea.", "Katie: Not all of it.", "Wyatt: Stop.", "Katie: It wouldn't be happening without you, Wyatt. Thank you.", "Wyatt: You're welcome.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: All right, party people! We're up! Okay!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: Okay, look. I am very uncomfortable in this situation.", "Sheila: You know something, Charlie. More than you've told me.", "Charlie: Well, of course I know. I mean, it's my job to know, you know, and not to tell.", "Sheila: So you have seen them together, ridge and Quinn.", "Charlie: Those are you words, not mine.", "Sheila: You know, Eric is your boss, your friend. I thought you'd be more loyal than this.", "Charlie: I am! Look, I drove you here. What else do you want from me?", "Sheila: If something is going on with Quinn, Eric has a right to know. Especially if it's between his son and his wife.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: That's impossible. Sheila doesn't know about us.", "Quinn: I don't know where she could have heard it or how, but she was asking all these veiled questions about you and me. What if she knows? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it's a beautiful night A beautiful life Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it's a beautiful night a beautiful life yeah, yeah feels so good I'm taking over now oh, watch me move and I will show you how just live your life live it to the fullest I live it to the fullest fullest I'm so dedicated and you're so fascinated life is what you make it you can fake it fake it, fake it oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it's a beautiful night A beautiful life Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh it's a beautiful night a beautiful life yeah, yeah, yeah", "Ridge: Hey. You got to get ahold of yourself. Sheila hasn't been here long enough to know anything about anything.", "Quinn: She didn't come here to chit-chat. That woman is on the hunt, and someone must have given her a hint!", "Ridge: Who? Brooke doesn't want this secret to come out, Katie just saved your life, and ivy, she's not gonna say anything. So stop. Please stop imagining things.", "Quinn: I am not imagining this. It was easy to keep Brooke and Katie and even ivy quiet, but Sheila carter is dangerous. Who knows what she'll do?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: Okay, time's up.", "Sheila: No, no, no, no, no! I want to see this with my own eyes.", "Charlie: Look, there's nothing to see. I mean, just forget I said anything.", "Sheila: I can't. I care too much about Eric, and so should you!", "Charlie: You know, we both could be wrong.", "Sheila: Not a chance. Quinn was -- was nervous. I -- the minute I mentioned ridge... I wasn't even accusing her. I was just asking innocent questions.", "Charlie: Oh, \"innocent questions\" -- yeah, I'll bet!", "Sheila: You're in law enforcement, you have instincts. If you'd been in that room with Quinn and me, you would have known she was hiding something. Ah, but you already know that, don't you?", "Charlie: I got no proof of anything.", "Sheila: You're not hiding something from me, are you? That would be a mistake -- a very big mistake. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Is something going on between Eric's wife and son? Answer me, Charlie. Answer me!"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwC-iCSMKl0"}
