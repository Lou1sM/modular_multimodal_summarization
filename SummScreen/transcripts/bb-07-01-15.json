    "Recap": [
        "Steffy asks Aly if she needs some water or a sedative or something. Aly glares at her and tells her not to patronize her. What kind of woman is Steffy, parading around in her underwear in front of a man she knows is taken. Steffy says she does not have to explain herself, she and Liam were working. Aly chastises Liam for betraying Ivy when she has been so loving and trusting and been nothing but good to him. Wyatt walks in while Ivy is talking to Carter about the papers and tells Wyatt she is officially ending her marriage. Zende tells Nicole that he really likes his family not for the money and power but they are really good people. She says she only knows Rick well and pretty much the entire world knows her sister is a transgender. She hopes Zende doesn't have anything against that. She tells him she barely knew her sister at home but she is very proud of her now.",
        "Maya tells Caroline that she really blew her away by expressing herself. Caroline says she could not judge Maya as she herself has two moms. She knows the courage and strength of character it takes. Maya says coming from Caroline that means so much. Caroline also apologizes for what her Uncle Bill did to out Maya. She handled that with grace and dignity and she has been an example for everyone. Rick walks in and is happy that they are getting along so well. Maya says no matter what else happens, she will always remember this moment and how much it means to her.",
        "Ivy tells Carter that she wants to finalize this as soon as possible. She tells Wyatt the only reason they married was to keep her from being deported. He says sure, but this did not have to happen. She says she knows and trust her, she is not just handing Liam back over to Steffy. He realizes it is turning her world upside down though. She says the hard part is she believed Liam when he said that he was over Steffy. Wyatt says he believes Liam thought that too. He reminds her that she is beautiful and smart and very unique and Liam knows she is a good person so he won't give up on her so easily. Aly snarls at Steffy and asks why she came back anyway, no one needed her here. Steffy counters with that is not true. Her dad would not be CEO if not for her. And Aly would still be making crab dip and massaging Maya's feet so a little gratitude wouldn't be out of order. Then she suggests they drop all of this and change the subject. Carter brings the papers in and Aly jumps all over Liam and asks him not to sign the papers. He can not simply give up on Ivy. He loves her so do not throw her away. Caroline asks Rick if they can address the elephant in the room. There is a new reigning couple now and the staff is much happier. Can Maya and Rick be okay with that. Both agree they can. He says he thought he might never get a chance to set foot in this building again. So while he is not CEO he is happy to be at FC again and it's all because of this beautiful woman. Maya gloats there is no FC without Rick. Zende tells Nicole that he knew abut Maya as he tries to keep up with things around here. Bill Spencer was wrong and should have given her a chance to disclose herself. Nicole admits it was mainly her fault. She trusted the wrong person, Wyatt, by telling him. She looks at Zende and says something tells her this is going to be a great summer. Ivy tells Wyatt that Steffy needs her own man so she will stop sniffing around hers. Wyatt says he is willing and able and standing right here. He likes Steffy, even kissed her and she kissed him back. So if he and Ivy play their cards right maybe Steffy and Liam won't be a couple after all. Liam tells Aly that she needs to dial it back. This is between him and Ivy. Aly tells Steffy that she knows she is used to getting any man but she blew it this time. And she will not stand by and watch her take Liam away from Ivy. Steffy tells her not to even think about it. She knows she has issues but she will not let her talk to her this way. Aly snarls that yes she has issues, Steffy's mom killed her mom. She mowed her down with a car. Steffy can't believe she is bringing that up now after all these years. She reminds her it was an accident. Aly says Taylor was a lush and a slut just like Steffy, using their sexuality to get whatever they want and now dismantling good people like Ivy and Liam. Aly even suggests that Steffy go back to Paris. Steffy says they are family and they need to get along. Aly glares at her again and says Ivy is her family too but she did not cut her any slack by taking her man. Her family tree has poisonous branches members who use people even hurt and kill them and she will not let that happen again on her watch. Steffy turns her back and tells Aly to redirect her focus, maybe on her shoe line. Darla appears before Aly and tells her that she has to be the one. She could not save Darla from Steffy's drunk mom but she can save the family from Steffy now. Get rid of her! Steffy catches her and asks what is up with her. Aly says she was just talking to her mom, she's a saint. She may not be here on this earth but she is always with her. She knows Steffy thinks that is weird but it's true. Steffy tells her just stay away from her and all will be fine. Darla appears again and tells Aly to get rid of Steffy."

        "Carter: You two breaking up?",
        "Ivy: No. No, we were -- we were a couple going into this marriage, and we still are.",

        "[Door opens, knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Hey. Uh, private meeting?",
        "Ivy: No, it's fine. It's nothing you don't already know. I'm officially ending my marriage to Liam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: You can't believe I'm Maya's sister? I can't believe you're a Forrester. Must be nice.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles] It is, you know. Uh, not because of all the money and stuff, you know. My family's really good people.",
        "Nicole: Oh, well, I don't really know them except for Rick.",
        "Zende: Because he's dating your sister, right?",
        "Nicole: Pretty much the entire world knows that Maya's a trans woman. You got some kind of feeling about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Well, I think it's safe to say you just blew me away.",
        "Caroline: Did you think I would judge you?",
        "Maya: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: How could I? I have two moms. I know what it means to -- to live your authentic life and not care what the world thinks. Who... I know the -- the strength of character that takes, the courage that takes.",
        "Maya: [Voice breaking] Coming from you... that means so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Sorry. I didn't mean to be abrupt. I'm protective over my sister.",
        "Zende: Old habit?",
        "Nicole: All new. Maya left home when I was little. Barely ever saw her again till I decided to look her up.",
        "Zende: So, did you know Maya was transgender before you came here?",
        "Nicole: Found her birth certificate back home. Said Myron.",
        "Zende: So, the idea was to confront her?",
        "Nicole: No, n-not confront her. But on second thought, I guess that's what I did. Not because I was mad or ashamed or anything. I'm proud of Maya. I am proud to be her little sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: This is weird, isn't it, to be in the same room and not be taking shots at each other?",
        "Maya: Yeah. You're telling me.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Maya, I am... I am so sorry for what my uncle did to you. I am -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Maya: It was pretty awful. He took my story and my pain and... it -- it was -- it was a hard time.",
        "Caroline: I can't even imagine what that must have been like for you, but I have to tell you that you [Sniffles] -- You handled that with such grace and dignity. And you're -- you're an example for everyone.",
        "Maya: I'm gonna remind you, you said that.",
        "Caroline: Oh, God. You're gonna have to because it's me and I -- oh!",
        "Maya: [Laughs] I know, I know. But this is nice.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Maya: Oh.",
        "Rick: Pam told me you two were in here together. Is everything all right?",
        "Maya: Yes. Caroline was just expressing her support.",
        "Rick: That makes me happy to hear.",
        "Maya: No matter what happens going forward, I will always remember this moment and how much it's meant to me. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: For Liam's sake, I want this annulment over as quick as possible.",
        "Carter: There are channels to go through, but I'll see what I can do.",
        "Ivy: Thanks, Carter. Thanks.",
        "Carter: Hang in there, okay?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] [Sighs]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ivy: I don't even know why I'm so sad. I mean, it's not like I didn't realize this was a possibility.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but it didn't have to happen.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, the only reason we got married is so I didn't get shipped out of the United States.",
        "Wyatt: Still, you're only human. You love the guy. It's okay if you were hoping for a different outcome.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I know. I just -- I feel really silly.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy, you weren't being unrealistic. Liam has genuine feelings for you.",
        "Ivy: No, I know. I know, and trust me, me signing these annulment papers, that's not me just handing him back to Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Look, I get that Ivy's your friend. You care about her. But you are way out of line here.",
        "Aly: I am? Steffy's the one, all trashed out, flaunting herself in front of you!",
        "Liam: Aly, seriously, you need to dial it back.",
        "Aly: Look, I know that you're used to having everything you want, every man. One look and they're supposed to fall at your feet. Well, not this time. You had your chance with Liam, and you blew it. Liam is with Ivy now. And I will not let you take him away from her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: Must have been something, first time you came face to face with your long-lost sister.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, I felt this jilt of recognition, like I'd found home. Unfortunately, Maya didn't feel the same.",
        "Zende: Suspicious?",
        "Nicole: Yeah. She was guarded. And then, of course, I did everything possible to reinforce her doubts.",
        "Zende: Like what?",
        "Nicole: Um, I didn't know how to ask for love, so I demanded things, like a place to stay, some type of function at Forrester. See, in my mind, Maya had abandoned me. I mean, knowing what it was like growing up in that cold house, and here she was living it up. Famous model, rich boyfriend, like I didn't even exist.",
        "Zende: I can see how you would be resentful.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, but I had it all wrong. Maya didn't leave me. She left to save her own life. So, you must have an opinion. Everyone does. What do you think about my sister?",
        "Zende: Well, from what I've read and what you've told me, I think Maya Avant is pretty badass.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Is it crazy that I wish that that woman had just stayed in Paris?",
        "Wyatt: No. Steffy coming back turned your whole life upside down. I get it.",
        "Ivy: And you know what? I believed him. I believed him when he told me that he was over her.",
        "Wyatt: See, that's the thing. I-I think he believed it, too.",
        "Ivy: What is it? What is it this hold that she has of him? I mean, I get it. I get it. I know all about their history. She takes every single opportunity she gets to remind me of it. But when does it become -- when does it become just that, you know? When does it become the past?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: I mean, you're over Hope, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, Ivy, she was over me pretty quickly. But Liam and Steffy, they're -- they're unresolved, you know?",
        "Ivy: Oh, great. Great.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, you. Look at you. You -- you are beautiful, you're smart, you're, you know, you're unique.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: You're Australian. Can't understand what the hell you're saying half the time, but...",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: But Liam knows you're a good person, you know? He won't be so quick to give that up. Trust me.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Wow. Much better. Thank you.",
        "Steffy: Oh, you're still here. That's awesome.",
        "Aly: I have as much right to be anywhere in this building as you do.",
        "Steffy: I didn't mean to imply otherwise.",
        "Aly: Why did you come back, anyway? No one needed you here.",
        "Liam: Aly.",
        "Steffy: Not true. Without me on board, my father wouldn't be CEO. You'd still be making crab dip and massaging Maya's feet. A little gratitude wouldn't be out of order.",
        "Aly: Oh, oh, oh, okay. So, I'm supposed to be grateful for you upsetting Ivy's life, waltzing in here all entitled to Liam.",
        "Liam: Okay, Aly, you have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, seriously, can we just drop the subject?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Carter: Liam, I've got the...",
        "Liam: Oh, the annulment papers. Right.",
        "Carter: Yeah. They're ready for your signature.",
        "Liam: Thanks.",
        "Aly: No, no, no, no, no. You -- you -- Liam, you can't. You can't just sign your marriage away!",
        "Steffy: This isn't happening.",
        "Aly: No one is talking to you! Ivy is your wife.",
        "Liam: Aly, you know why I married her. It was to keep her from getting deported.",
        "Aly: But you wouldn't have taken that step unless you love her.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Aly: You do. I know you do. I-I've seen it. Don't do this, Liam. Don't throw Ivy away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: While we're all here and getting along, could we address the elephant in the room?",
        "Rick: And what's that?",
        "Caroline: There have been some changes here.",
        "Rick: Yes, uh, you and Ridge are the ruling couple now.",
        "Caroline: Yes, and the staff is a lot happier.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] Rub that in, why don't you?",
        "Caroline: What? [Chuckles] So, my question to you guys is, is that gonna be a problem for you?",
        "Maya: I'm fine.",
        "Rick: Yeah, yeah. Me, too. I'm happy to be back. Never thought I'd be running International again. Being CEO was -- you know, actually, you know what? There is one thing that's bothering me.",
        "Caroline: Okay. Let's hear it.",
        "Rick: I thought there would be, I don't know, more. You know, \"Welcome back\" sign, my minions nipping at my heels, maybe an apology letter from Ridge.",
        "Caroline: Like that would ever happen!",
        "Rick: Oh, fine, fine. That's fine. Just stomp on my dreams while you're at it. No, I knew there was a chance I'd never step foot in this-- this building again. And that was fine with me. I just... This is my life, being a Forrester, and the only reason that I'm back is because of this beautiful woman right here.",
        "Caroline: I heard. Maya wouldn't come back unless you were part of the package.",
        "Maya: There is no Forrester without Rick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I take it you knew about Maya?",
        "Zende: Yeah. I like to keep up with what's going on around here.",
        "Nicole: Well, would have been hard to miss, thanks to Bill Spencer and his publicity machine.",
        "Zende: That was so wrong. I mean, Maya should have been able to, uh, what's the word?",
        "Nicole: Disclose.",
        "Zende: On her own terms.",
        "Nicole: Glad you see it that way. It was mostly my fault, though, how her story came out.",
        "Zende: How?",
        "Nicole: I made a mistake. Trusted the wrong person.",
        "Zende: Anybody I know?",
        "Nicole: Wyatt Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You know what Steffy needs?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Ivy: She needs a man of her own so she can stop sniffing around mine.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Well, you know, I'm here, right here waiting, so...",
        "Ivy: Wait. Wha-- what? What was that? You and Steffy?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, I don't know. We're spending a little time together, like, around the office.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: I, uh, I kissed her twice.",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Ivy: No! Get out!",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: Wait, did she kiss you back?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, no. Yes, she kissed me back! Yes, and it was great, okay?",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I got a good feeling. If you and I play our cards right... maybe Liam and Steffy aren't as inevitable after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: It looks like I walked in on a tense moment, but, um, I called in a favor and fast-tracked the annulment, okay? I just need you to go over the paperwork.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, go. Just get it done.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles] Of course, you'd say that. Signing those papers is a huge mistake. Ivy's your wife because she's supposed to be. Don't throw your marriage away on some fickle person who bailed on you when you needed her most. Stay with the woman you can count on. The woman you belong with.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Steffy: Don't even think about it, Aly. I'm trying to be patient, respect your issues, but I'm not gonna stand here and let you talk to me like that.",
        "Aly: Issues? Exactly what issue do you think that I have? Maybe the fact that your mother killed my mother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: So, you're a Midwesterner.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] No, not in my heart. I always had dreams of getting out, you know? I wanted what my sister had -- an exciting life in a big city. My head never even went to fashion. That's just a bonus.",
        "Zende: Well, if glam and unpredictable are what you're looking for, Forrester Creations is definitely the place to be.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] I can't believe that I'm actually going to be working here.",
        "Zende: We are.",
        "Nicole: Looking forward to that, too. Something tells me this is going to be a fantastic summer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: What? Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Ivy: Because just when I think I have you all figured out, Wyatt, you go and say something like, \"I kissed Steffy.\"",
        "Wyatt: Okay. In all fairness, I initiated it.",
        "Ivy: Do you like her?",
        "Wyatt: Why does everybody keep saying that? No, I don't like her.",
        "Ivy: Well, you kissed her.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, fine. I like her. Geez. But I don't know her, you know? She's feisty and fun to be around. But, you know, there is one thing that I-I-I do like. I like how this whole thing rolled out, all of us working here together. Gives me a chance to get to know Steffy. You know, and I just -- I really want to know her well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Really, Aly? You're bringing that back up?",
        "Aly: Your mother mowed mine down with a car!",
        "Steffy: That was an accident, okay?",
        "Aly: Taylor was a lush!",
        "Steffy: It was a horrible, horrible accident.",
        "Aly: And a slut. Just like you.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "Aly: Using your sexuality to get what you want, dismantling people's lives -- good people like Liam and Ivy!",
        "Steffy: I thought we moved on from this, okay?",
        "Aly: From -- from my mother's murder?! Never. Every single time I look at you, I will remember. Maybe you should go back to Paris.",
        "Steffy: Well, obviously that's not happening. So, for the sake of our family, maybe we should just get along.",
        "Aly: Family? You don't care about family. Ivy's your family, but that doesn't stop you from flaunting yourself in front of her man while you just get rewarded. President of the company, Liam on your arm. Another reign of terror. Well, I learned my lesson from Rick. I have to stand guard, protect the future of this -- of this family and of its company.",
        "Steffy: Whoa, what are you even talking about?",
        "Aly: Our family tree has poisonous branches. Members who would use people.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Aly: And hurt people and kill people. And I won't let that happen again, not on my watch.",
        "Steffy: All right. Aly, um... you have to redirect your thoughts.",
        "Aly: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: Start thinking more positively, you know, forget the past. Maybe, um, focus on your shoe line.",
        "Darla: You're right, sweetheart. You have to be the one. You couldn't save me from her drunk mother. But you can save this family from her. Get rid of her, Aly.",
        "Steffy: [Snaps fingers] Hello. Are you okay?",
        "Aly: I was listening to my mother. She's a saint.",
        "Steffy: Okay, okay, so... this is -- this is still happening. You -- you still see Darla.",
        "Aly: She may not be here on this earth. But she's always with me. You think that's weird, don't you? You think I'm weird.",
        "Steffy: Okay, you should stay away from me, hmm? And we'll be just fine.",
        "Darla: Get rid of her."
