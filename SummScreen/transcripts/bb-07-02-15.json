    "Recap": [
        "Liam presents Ivy with annulment papers. Wyatt agrees this is not a good time and he leaves. Ivy asks who should sign first. She says that Liam was kind enough to marry her so the least she can do is not drag this out. Liam signs first and then Ivy. Steffy tells Aly that she is really trying here. Aly says she can not say any more. The things that happened that night Darla was killed changed her life forever. She had that bond with her mother but no more. Steffy still has that with her mother. She is not a nut job and this is all on her now. Ridge pops in and reminds Steffy about the meeting. Aly asks if she can come. Without being rude, he says sure. Brooke and Pam tell Rick that they are glad he is back. He says he knows it is a package deal, one Ridge would not have made otherwise. Zende and Nicole come in and he meets Maya, all good things he has heard about her. Pam tells them Ridge wants all of them at the meeting so do not forget. Zende tells Nicole that his grandfather was married to Brooke .and both brothers. It is one big dysfunctional family but it works. Both look at each other and agree they are looking for Mr. and Mrs. Right.",
        "Ivy makes the first announcement and says she is no longer Ivy Spencer and back to Ivy Forrester as she just signed the annulment papers. Ridge welcomes his lead model back to work and Rick as well..... props to tackling the International office from here. He is sure he can do it. Steffy introduces a new hope for woman with liberty \u0096 California Freedom, a new campaign, a new spirit .the life they were meant to have every day. Aly can not contain herself any more and opens her mouth that the trashy lingerie and swimwear is wrong and especially with Steffy modeling it. She would expect that out of her but not from a father wanting to parade his daughter out like that. Pam tries to calm her down but Aly yells that it is not okay. This is not what her sister would want for this company and it cheapens them all. She tells Steffy that the only thing she was working on in the lingerie was her body. Maya tries also to ask her not to be so judgmental and Aly goes off on her that it is rich that Maya is now lecturing her .her of all people. Aly tells Steffy that is it her fault that her mother is gone and she is not worthy to even speak her name. Steffy tells her that everyone is gone so let her help her. Aly shouts again that she does not want HER help, so do not look at her like she is crazy. Caroline tells Ridge that if anyone can get through to Aly it is Steffy so at least she has to try. Aly tells Steffy that she knows a bully when she sees one. She has been around them all her life. And now she is doing that to Ivy over Liam. Steffy keeps repeating that Darla's death was an accident. Aly says she was persuaded to forgive Taylor but they were just words. She cries that she will NEVER forgive her. Steffy says their fathers are brothers and they have to get along. She is sorry that night keeps haunting her but it will ruin her, the anger will if she lets it. Do not give in to it."

        "Ivy: Annulment papers?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Carter, uh...had them fast-tracked. Hey, you know, if this is not a good time --",
        "Wyatt: Like it's ever a good time, Liam.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, maybe a little privacy?",
        "Ivy: So, uh, who should sign first?",
        "Liam: I don't know. I mean, do you think it even matters?",
        "Ivy: Probably not, just as long as we both do.",
        "Liam: Hey, you know, if you need a minute or...",
        "Ivy: No. Mnh-mnh. I mean, you were kind enough to marry me when I thought I was gonna be deported, so the least I can do is not drag this out. Liam, I never meant for you to feel trapped.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I'm really trying here, Aly, but you're not making it easy. Again... I am sorry.",
        "Aly: \"I'm sorry\" can't undo that night. What Taylor took from me... changed my whole life forever. Dad's, too.",
        "Steffy: Thorne's forgiven my mom. They were even involved briefly.",
        "Aly: No, no, no, no, no. No, he hasn't. How could he, after everything she's put us through?",
        "Steffy: I know about loss, too. My sister, Phoebe -- we were twins... as close as two people could ever be.",
        "Aly: Not the same.",
        "Steffy: No?",
        "Aly: Mothers and daughters -- there is a bond like no other. And you still have that with Taylor.",
        "Steffy: And you still talk to Darla.",
        "Aly: Don't look at me like I'm some kind of nut job. But even if I were, that's all on Taylor, just like what happened with Liam and Ivy is on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: We're so glad you're back, sweetheart.",
        "Pam: Both of you.",
        "Rick: Thanks to Maya, we're a package deal. Ridge would have never brought me back if it wasn't for her.",
        "Maya: Sweetie...",
        "Rick: You're right. You're right. We're putting our best foot forward. This is the beginning of a new chapter -- a less contentious one -- in Forrester Creations' history.",
        "Pam: Good.",
        "Zende: Are two of Forrester's newest interns allowed to crash the party?",
        "Brooke: Oh, my goodness! Are you...?",
        "Nicole: That's Zende, Kristen's son.",
        "Pam: She knows who he is.",
        "Brooke: Wow!",
        "Rick: So, you're interning here for the summer?",
        "Zende: Know a better way to learn the family fashion biz?",
        "Rick: Not really.",
        "Zende: You must be Maya.",
        "Maya: Yes.",
        "Zende: Heard a lot about you.",
        "Maya: That can't be good.",
        "Zende: From Nicole -- all of it good. She's really proud of her big sister.",
        "Rick: We all are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'm trying to figure out the last time we saw you.",
        "Zende: A few Christmases ago, I think. Mom and Dad send their love, by the way.",
        "Brooke: Oh, that's nice.",
        "Rick: That would be Kristen and Tony.",
        "Nicole: Mm. Yeah. I'm never gonna live this down now.",
        "Maya: So, you're interning, too, Sis?",
        "Nicole: Well, I didn't exactly cut it as a model, so...",
        "Zende: Wait. You were a model here at Forrester?",
        "Nicole: My sister's the model. I had no idea how much talent it takes.",
        "Pam: That's Nicole's diplomatic way of saying that she sucked.",
        "Brooke: Pam!",
        "Nicole: No, she's right. I sucked. But, thanks to Ridge, I get another chance with this internship.",
        "Rick: So are Maya and I. Thanks to Ridge, we're getting another chance.",
        "Pam: Oh, speaking of which, Ridge wants you at the meeting -- all of you -- so don't forget it.",
        "Nicole: Oh, Zende and me, too?",
        "Pam: No, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: I'm just kidding.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: What is the meeting about?",
        "Pam: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not telling. I've been sworn to secrecy. But I'll see you all there. Don't be late.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: I forgot how much fun Pam can be.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Oh, yeah.",
        "Rick: Well, now that Ridge is CEO, merriment and light has once again returned to the hallowed halls of Forrester Creations. What? I'm kidding.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm. I'll explain later. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Aly, you are blaming me for something that I didn't do.",
        "Aly: Oh, God! You are so your mother's daughter. You and Taylor never take responsibility for anything!",
        "Steffy: Okay. I want you to listen carefully. Liam and Ivy have --",
        "Aly: No, stop it! Stop it. I am not a child. I see things. I know things. If it weren't for you, Ivy and Liam would be blissfully happy, and they deserve to be blissfully happy, the way my mother and father do.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ridge: Hey. Hey, you two. Everything all right?",
        "Steffy: Uh... yeah. Yeah. We're -- we're fine.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Meeting's in 10.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. I'll see you there.",
        "Aly: First I've heard of a meeting. Can I come?",
        "Ridge: Sure. We've got a lot to cover, so we need to...figure it out.",
        "Aly: Don't worry, uncle Ridge. I won't be a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Do you think we win a prize for the shortest marriage on record?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I'm not sure what that prize would be.",
        "Ivy: Well, I guess it's my turn. You're free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Does anybody know what this big meeting's about?",
        "Brooke: Ridge is being very secretive.",
        "Maya: Well, whatever it is, we shouldn't be late, especially our first day back.",
        "Rick: We can trust you two kids to be alone? Behave.",
        "Zende: We'll try to restrain ourselves. [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Rick and Brooke are really happy that you're back.",
        "Zende: Have to be. They're family.",
        "Nicole: Brooke was married to your granddad, right?",
        "Zende: Both my uncles, too.",
        "Nicole: And they're still speaking to each other? Wow.",
        "Zende: Yeah, I know. It's one mixed-up, dysfunctional bunch, but somehow it all works.",
        "Nicole: Well, speaking of work, we should probably get back to it. Or not.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Okay. Brooke, Maya, Rick. Okay. We're all here. Might as well get started.",
        "Liam: Uh, uh, wait a second. Before we do, there's something you all should probably know. Do you -- should I tell them? Do you want to tell them?",
        "Ivy: Uh, no. I'll do it.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Ivy: Uh, I'm just gonna keep this short and sweet -- well, bittersweet, I guess. Good news is I'm no longer getting deported. [Chuckles] Um...that means my quickie marriage to Liam is over. We just signed annulment papers. So, I am back to being Ivy Forrester, and I am no longer Ivy Spencer.",
        "Steffy: Okay. So... Dad, take it away.",
        "Ridge: Uh... okay. Well, uh... first, I would like to welcome back our beautiful lead model.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Ridge: Starting tomorrow, you're gonna be busier than ever. And, Rick... props to you for deciding to run Forrester International from here. We're in good hands. Okay. Well, the meeting -- uh, Steffy and I have been working very hard trying to find a new direction for Forrester, and I think we both agree that Hope for the Future is done. We need something new.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. So, we started with a basic premise -- using fashion as a broader social message.",
        "Ridge: And that may not sound exactly new to everybody. It may sound like what Hope for the Future was. Well, we want to expand on the ideas of self- empowerment and self-respect in women and address something that Americans take for granted -- life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. We're talking about freedom -- being able to be your own woman, your own man, because you're free -- free-spirited... which Californians are known for, right?",
        "Ridge: Thus the name of this new campaign -- California Freedom. Please open your packet. This campaign is about the incredible female spirit, with bold new designs that say, \"yes, I value my freedom, and, yes, I will live the life I was meant to have every day.\"",
        "Steffy: \"And to express that freedom in a myriad of ways, including what I wear.\" Naturally, we'll use all facets of Forrester designs -- lingerie, swimwear.",
        "Aly: Whoa, whoa. Wait. Let me get this straight. Bikinis and underwear -- that's your idea of making women feel free?",
        "Liam: No, Aly. That's not what they're saying. It's about having a --",
        "Aly: And I'm assuming that you'll be the one modeling.",
        "Steffy: Yep.",
        "Aly: And you're okay with this? A father putting his daughter in underwear for the world to see? It was bad enough having to deal with Rick and Maya running this company, and I had hoped that you would restore Forrester back to its traditional and classy roots. But instead, we're selling sex camouflaged as freedom. You can't do this, Ridge. It's -- it's -- it's wrong. It's -- it's disgusting. It's -- it's -- it's exactly what I would have expected from Steffy... not you.",
        "Pam: Aly, honey, it's okay.",
        "Aly: No. No! No! It is not okay! This is not what your sister, my grandmother, wanted for this company! This is not what Grandpa wants for this company!",
        "Steffy: Actually, it is. Dad and I ran this by him earlier. He's all-in.",
        "Aly: I don't believe you.",
        "Ridge: It's true, Aly. I talked to my dad about it.",
        "Aly: Oh he is not your dad! Massimo Marone is.",
        "Ridge: I talked to my dad about it, and he wants all of us to pull together behind this and help us heal.",
        "Aly: Not if it cheapens the Forrester brand.",
        "Ivy: No. I don't think Steffy and Ridge are gonna let that happen.",
        "Aly: You're defending her?! After all Steffy has put you and Liam through?!",
        "Liam: This is so not the time for this, Aly.",
        "Aly: No. I walked in on you earlier. I walked in on you -- Steffy sashaying around in her underwear.",
        "Steffy: Aly, we were working on the lingerie line.",
        "Aly: The only thing you were working was your body.",
        "Rick: Aly, sweetheart, I realize I don't have a lot of credibility as far as you're concerned, and that's understandable. I do know a few things about anger and letting it take control of your life. And I'm pretty sure that nobody wants that for you here.",
        "Maya: He's right, honey. I think we all have to learn to live and let live.",
        "Aly: Oh. Great. Now Maya's lecturing me.",
        "Wyatt: No one's lecturing, Aly. We're just saying don't be so judgmental.",
        "Ridge: Everyone has a right to their opinion. This is just not the time.",
        "Aly: Except every time I try to give my opinion, you all look at me like I'm from another planet, as if I am totally out of touch... all because I feel Forrester's image is -- is veering away from the values that my grandparents instilled in this company... the same values that my father and my mother, God bless her soul, instilled in me.",
        "Steffy: Aly... uncle Thorne is a good man, and he is a great father. He and Darla --",
        "Aly: Don't...you...dare! You are not worthy to speak my mother's name! You are the reason that she's gone!",
        "Ridge: I think that's enough for now.",
        "Pam: Do you want me to go talk to her?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. No. Let me.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlotte: Kristina mentioned setting up an intern karaoke night sometime.",
        "Nicole: Oh, that sounds fun.",
        "Zende: Yeah.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Charlotte: Oh. Okay. I've got to go observe in the sewing room and then get back to stocking.",
        "Nicole: Oh. All right.",
        "Charlotte: See ya.",
        "Nicole: Bye.",
        "Zende: Bye.",
        "Nicole: Want to hand me those? Thank you.",
        "Zende: I wonder how the big powwow's going.",
        "Nicole: I mean, since you're family, I'm sure they'd let you sit in.",
        "Zende: I don't want any special favors.",
        "Nicole: Oh.",
        "Zende: What?",
        "Nicole: You're just not like most guys.",
        "Zende: Why -- because I want to make it on my own? There are a lot of guys who think the same way.",
        "Nicole: I know. It's just, um... anyway...",
        "Zende: By the way, I dig your sister. She's totally cool.",
        "Nicole: And she's totally taken.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles] What about you? You taken?",
        "Nicole: Anything wrong with waiting for Mr. Right?",
        "Zende: No. Kind of waiting for Ms. Right myself. I don't know. Am I looking in the right place?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Everyone's gone. It's just you and me.",
        "Aly: I have nothing more to say to you!",
        "Steffy: Aly, we have to deal with this. Let me help you.",
        "Aly: I don't want your help!",
        "Steffy: No, wait. Can you just...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I think that if anyone can get through to Aly, it's got to be Steffy. I mean, I know it's a long shot, but she has to try, right?",
        "Ridge: Have you always been like this -- this annoyingly optimistic? I never noticed.",
        "Caroline: Oh, wow. Excuse me, sir. I'm just the happiest I've ever been in my life, so forgive me if I want everyone else to feel that way.",
        "Ridge: We creative types -- we have to be brooders, intense, and tormented.",
        "Caroline: Oh, okay. Like this? [Muttering]",
        "Ridge: Are you doing me right now? Is that me? Is it? I liked you better when you're doing the optimistic thing.",
        "Caroline: Do you? Well, I like it better when you're kissing me.",
        "Ridge: Yeah? I like that better, too.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] You have lipstick.",
        "Ridge: I don't care.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I know a bully when I see one. I have been bullied my whole life.",
        "Steffy: Not by me. That's not who I am.",
        "Aly: Oh, right, 'cause you're more into wrecking relationships, like Liam and Ivy's.",
        "Steffy: Not this again.",
        "Aly: You -- you tainted what they had, and now you're trying to taint this company. It's just sex, sex, sex with you! That's all it's about!",
        "Steffy: Aly, just stop! Stop working yourself up.",
        "Aly: Like you even care.",
        "Steffy: I do care. Only you won't let yourself believe it because Taylor's my mom. It was an accident, Aly -- a terrible, unfortunate accident -- and I only wish you could just --",
        "Aly: Oh, just get past my mother's death? Get past Taylor taking away a little girl's mother?!",
        "Steffy: You've forgiven her. I remember that.",
        "Aly: No, no, no, no. I was persuaded to. I said the words, maybe, but I will never be able to forgive her. [Crying] You have no idea what it's been like!",
        "Steffy: No, I don't.",
        "Aly: [Sniffles]",
        "Steffy: We may never see eye to eye, but we are family, Aly. Our dads are brothers! Come on! I want us to get along. Please.",
        "[Aly's flashback]",
        "[Tires screech]",
        "[Present time]",
        "Steffy: I'm sorry... that night keeps haunting you... that pain that won't let go. But it will... if you let it. The anger that's consuming you -- don't give in to it, Aly."
