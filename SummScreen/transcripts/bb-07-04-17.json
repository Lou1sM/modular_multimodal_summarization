She is sorry she has to tell this to a very loving, trusting man but his wife and his son are having an affair. Quinn tells Ridge that they owe his father the truth and it will hurt less if it comes from them and not Sheila. He says Sheila is delusional and she can do no harm. Eric is livid. He says how dare Sheila come in his house and say such things about his wife and son. Coco tells RJ that Thomas really forgave Sally for what she did and now Spectra will flourish with him there. Thomas tells Sally that he thinks the ice is melting with Steffy and she is finally accepting his choice. And Sally will not embarrass them in Monte Carlo. They will be meeting all the greeters and shakers, it will be fabulous. Sally laments she is only worried about one thing as she can see that Coco is still not crazy that she has pulled another stunt on his family. Quinn tells Ridge that she was a pariah and Eric turned all of that around. She sees a new life that she has never experienced before. She cannot lose him the way he lost Brooke. Eric rants at Sheila that she dares to come into his house telling these lies. His wife and son would never betray him like that. He wants her to leave. He does not ever want to see her again.", "RJ gives Coco a teeny bikini, all red, white and blue with stars and stripes for the 4th. She says not on his life will she wear that. Quinn keeps at it that Sheila is dangerous and they do not know what she is going to do. It will haunt them the rest of their lives and they will never know when it might come out. She wants to be the woman Eric thinks she is and the son he wants Ridge to be. They need to tell him now and he is the one man on this planet that might forgive them.

They do not want to betray him but they have no choice. He laments she has not changed. She is evil and deceitful as she always has been. She says no, he is being played by the two people he loves the most. He roars that only in her mind, as sick and twisted as it is, would she come up with something like this. She keeps on and he stops her again and says Quinn is completely devoted to him and Sheila has not changed a bit. She is still the lying psychopath she has always been. He grabs her and is about to put her out when Quinn and Ridge come in and wonder why Sheila is there. Eric says she is leaving right now. Only Sheila speaks up and says there is nothing that get her to leave now. She wouldn't miss this for the world."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Sheila: I'd give anything to not be here, to have to tell you this, but I care about you, Eric, and the thought of Ridge and Quinn deceiving such a good, trusting man... look, I am so sorry, but your son and your wife are having an affair.", "Quinn: I can't keep living like this. We've been lying to your father for months. It's got to stop.", "Ridge: You're gonna have to think very clearly about the consequences.", "Quinn: I understand the consequences! I could lose my husband, you could lose your father!", "Ridge: And for what? Because Sheila carter may know something?", "Quinn: What if she does? I can't have Eric hear it from her first. He needs to hear it from me, from us! And I don't even know if we can get him to understand, but he's not going to understand if he hears it from Sheila first! Come on, Ridge. We owe your father the truth.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Birds cawing]", "Thomas: We did it. We got the challenge in Monte Carlo. It's amazing. This is -- ahh, this is great!", "Sally: Yes! Spectra fashions in one corner, and in the other...", "Thomas: What's with all the independence day decorations? Somebody got really festive.", "Sally: Yeah, it's grams. It's her favorite holiday.", "Thomas: Huh.", "Sally: She always throws a big bash, complete with fireworks.", "Thomas: Oh?", "Sally: Mm-hmm. Mm! \"Sally girl, I gave all the employees the day off. Party's at my place. You and Tommy boy get over here pronto! We've got lots to celebrate.\"", "Thomas: Mm.", "Sally: Grams.", "Thomas: We do have a lot to celebrate.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: [Chuckles] I'm serious. You should have been in the calendar shoot.", "Coco: Um, no. No!", "R.J.: Yes! Come on, the camera loves you.", "[Cell phone chimes]", "Coco: Oh! It's grams. Uh, oh, she's just checking to make sure that we're still going to the cookout.", "R.J.: [Laughs] Wait. You were serious? And she actually dresses up like the statue of liberty?", "Coco: Every year since I can remember. Yeah. It's -- it's insane.", "R.J.: Yeah... [Laughs] Hey, you okay?", "Coco: Yeah. Yeah, I'm just -- I'm still thinking about earlier. I can't get over what Thomas and sally pulled. Especially my sister.", "R.J.: I'm pretty sure it was Thomas' idea, not sally's.", "Coco: Yeah, but she didn't have to go along with it. I don't think she realizes how lucky she is. Like, your family could have put her in jail. But Spectra is alive and well because of Thomas. Like, he really forgave her for what she did.", "R.J.: You have, too, right? I mean, after that spy-camera thing?", "Coco: Yeah. Yeah. But I would have hoped that she learned from that experience.", "R.J.: You don't think she has?", "Coco: Well, she didn't have to be a part of what Thomas did. But she was, and call me naive, but I guess I just would have expected more from my sister.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Well, that was some kiss.", "Thomas: Well, it's some day. I mean, it's the birthday of our country and a really big win for Spectra.", "Sally: Yes, you did get the best of the princess.", "Thomas: That was not my goal. I was just challenging her, but that was a fringe benefit. Absolutely. I have to say, though, I'm really impressed with the way that Steffy handled herself. You know, once the cameras were rolling and she was live with Jarrett, it was great. She was a little annoyed once everything stopped, but, uh... I think the ice is thawing between us, and she's beginning to accept my choice. My choice being you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: The truth? Well, the truth is we kissed a few times.", "Quinn: And Sheila could make Eric believe otherwise.", "Ridge: Sheila doesn't know anything!", "Quinn: What if she knows more than what we think she does? She could go to Eric and she could --", "Ridge: Did she say she was gonna do that?", "Quinn: The point is, she thinks she's doing what's best for him. She obviously still cares about him. She probably even wants him back!", "Ridge: Well, he wants nothing to do with her because she is delusional.", "Quinn: Maybe she is. Step one in her delusion -- get rid of the current wife. [Sighs] Ridge... how -- how could we have put ourselves in this position?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sheila: I can only imagine how much this hurts, Eric, to believe that a woman that you thought was loyal, isn't, and that your son could do this you again! My heart is breaking for you. You have always been such a special man to me.", "Eric: So special that you couldn't wait to come in here and tell me this.", "Sheila: I knew it would be upsetting --", "Eric: You come into my house like this?! You come into my house and you say these things about my son and my wife?! How dare you, Sheila! How dare you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: I could be mad at you.", "Thomas: Oh, darling, how could you ever be mad at a face like this?", "Sally: Well, I promised that I was gonna turn over a new leaf, but crashing that calendar shoot was very vintage Spectra.", "Thomas: Okay, that was -- that was me that did that. She's my sister. I'm allowed to do things like that. You were just my trusty sidekick.", "Sally: Uh, yeah, but I'm not sure princess Steffy saw it that way.", "Thomas: Doesn't matter which was she saw it. She accepted the challenge.", "Sally: Reluctantly.", "Thomas: But she's a good sport about it. This is exactly what Spectra needs right now. This is exactly the pr that we need right now.", "Sally: Yes, but now, we need to create a swimwear line for Monte Carlo.", "Thomas: We will. We will absolutely do that. And when we are there at the summit, we are going to be sitting next to all the international movers and shakers. Do you know what that means for us?", "Sally: Yes, that I should not embarrass us or Spectra.", "Thomas: Babe. You are not going to embarrass anyone. You are going to wow them. And so will that.", "Sally: Wait, are we gonna unveil our new logo in Monte Carlo?", "Thomas: Well, yeah, I mean, it's work in progress. That's why nobody else outside of Spectra has seen it yet, but it gives us a chance to debut the new brand and where we're going with our designs and everything that we're doing.", "Sally: You know, I will say this again. None of this would be possible without you. I am just concerned about one thing.", "Thomas: Yeah?", "Sally: The way coco was looking at me. I could tell that she was not happy with me pulling another fast one on your family.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: Steffy accepted the challenge, right?", "Coco: Yeah.", "R.J.: And it was all in good fun, so what's the harm?", "Coco: Meaning I shouldn't worry about sally, and everything will be all right...", "R.J.: Feel better? You good? Good. 'Cause we got a barbecue to get to. But first, I want you to do me a favor.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: We got caught up in something. I'm not sure what it was, but what matters now...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: What matters is Eric! Eric is all that matters. All I think about is what my life would be like without him, without him seeing something in me that no one else did. Something that I couldn't even see in myself. I was a pariah. My own son lost Faith in me. Not Eric. Eric believes in redemption. He believes in second chances. He knew that I could turn my life around even though I did all of those horrible things, and I have never -- I have never experienced that kind of Faith from someone before. I've never experienced that kind of unconditional love! I can't lose Eric. I can't lose him the way you lost Brooke.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sheila: You're hurt! You're lashing out. I understand that, but --", "Eric: Not another word, Sheila! Not another word. You come back, you're saying you want to make amends... you want to work your way back into our family and back -- back into my life. And then you dare to come into my house, saying these hateful things!", "Sheila: I've got proof, Eric.", "Eric: No, you have nothing! It's lies, Sheila! My son and my wife would never betray me like that. I want you to go. I never want to see you again. I never want to hear about you again. I want you out of here. I want you gone. For good!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: What kind of favor?", "R.J.: It's the fourth, right? First as boyfriend and girlfriend.", "Coco: Mm-hmm.", "R.J.: I was thinking maybe we could do something to mark the occasion.", "Coco: Okay. What were you thinking?", "R.J.: I don't know, maybe a photo shoot. Take some shots of you being in something patriotic. You game?", "Coco: Not on your life.", "R.J.: [Laughing] Okay.", "Coco: No! What?", "R.J.: I tried. I tried.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: Babe, don't worry about your sister. I will tell coco the whole challenge was my idea, okay? We have to focus on following through with Monte Carlo. This is Spectra's first test. Not to mention our premiere as designers together. We have to impress everybody that's showing up to this thing.", "Sally: Yes, and show the entire fashion world that we are a design duo to be reckoned with.", "Thomas: Because we are. Or will be, once we're going toe-to-toe with Forrester.", "Sally: Say it again.", "Thomas: I don't know which part I'm saying again.", "Sally: [Giggles] How we are going to kick princess Steffy's butt in Monte Carlo.", "Thomas: We are absolutely going to kick her ass.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Both laugh]", "Ridge: Listen to me. Everything's gonna be fine.", "Quinn: Stop! Stop! Sheila is dangerous. She's unpredictable. We don't know what she's going to do. But even if she doesn't have anything on us, we're never gonna be free of this secret. Brooke, Katie, ivy at some point could decide that Eric needs to know the truth and --", "Ridge: They're not gonna say anything.", "Quinn: Maybe! But it is going to haunt us for the rest of our lives. We are never gonna know how, where, why, or when it's ever going to come out! It's always gonna be between me and my husband. It's always gonna be between you and your father! Eric deserves better than that. He deserves better from us. I told you the other day -- I want to be the woman that Eric thinks I am. I know that you want to be the son that your father thinks you are. He has to hear this. From us. Before anyone else. Yeah, it's possible he could shut both of us out of his life. But knowing your father's goodness, if there is a man on this planet who's capable of forgiving us, it's Eric. It's time we're honest with him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sheila: Eric, please. I'm just thinking of you.", "Eric: You're telling me lies about people I love, Sheila.", "Sheila: No, I'm not telling you lies.", "Eric: I want you to get out.", "Sheila: No, you've got to believe me when I say that your wife is having --", "Eric: You know nothing about my wife!", "Sheila: You're right. You're right. When I first came to los Angeles, I knew nothing about Quinn. But I want to believe that she's everything that you believe she is. I started seeing things, small things. Still enough to make me concerned about you, and I'm not the only one, Eric. I talked to some people. They were concerned. They let some things slip.", "Eric: Oh, come on, Sheila! Come on!", "Sheila: Don't you remember when Brooke and Ridge were supposed to be married in Australia, and Brooke called the wedding off the day before? I believe that she found out that Ridge and Quinn were having an affair!", "Eric: All right, come on! You've got to stop this, Sheila! Please!", "Sheila: No! Stop! I saw it. I saw it today with my own two eyes -- the two of them -- and they looked guilty, Eric. They don't want to betray you, but they -- they have no choice! They are! They're not trying to.", "Eric: My god, look at you. You haven't changed, not one bit. You're just as evil and deceitful as you ever were.", "Sheila: No. No, it's Ridge and Quinn that are being deceitful. God, Eric, you are being played by the two people you love the most.", "Eric: My wife and my son love me. They would never do something like this to me. Something this sick and twisted could only come from a mind as sick and twisted as yours!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: So, too revealing?", "Coco: Why don't you try it on? You tell me.", "R.J.: Okay, yeah, no, it might be a little snug, but...", "Coco: R.J., Stop. Stop.", "R.J.: [Laughs] All right, all right. I still think you'd look hot in it, though.", "Coco: Thanks.", "R.J.: Before we head over to your gram's, I actually do have a surprise.", "Coco: If it's another bathing suit, I'm...", "R.J.: No. No, it's not. I swear, it's cool. All right? Something totally L.A. You trust me?", "Coco: Always. Always.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Spectra fashions in Monaco at Spencer summit? Is this my life? Like, when I think about my first fashion preview, in this office with Jarrett and what a disaster it was, and now here I am, with Thomas Forrester of all people, and we are sharing this office together and revamping the company. Like, it could not get any better. [Giggles]", "Thomas: You want to bet?", "Sally: Okay, you're right. No, it is just the beginning, but we have got to make the most out of Monte Carlo.", "Thomas: And we are going to ride all that pr out straight to success.", "Sally: This is happening. We're on our way, and it is all thanks to you. Never in my wildest dreams could I ever have imagined anything like this. Or anyone like you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sheila: It's understandable. This is too painful to consider. But Ridge is the one you should be angry with, given his history with the women that you love in your life. You were married to Brooke --", "Eric: Sheila, stop! Stop!", "Sheila: No, no, you need to listen to this, it's for your own good!", "Eric: Look, you can't -- you can't shake my Faith in my son and my wife. You can't do it!", "Sheila: Do you think I wanted to come here with this? I agonized over this until I saw the two of them --", "Eric: You saw nothing! My wife is completely devoted to me.", "Sheila: No, you know what? I see what this is doing to you, and it's killing me. You deserve the truth, Eric!", "Eric: The truth? You don't know anything about the truth. You have no relationship with the truth at all! You haven't changed a bit! You're still the same psychopathic liar that you always were. I want you out of my house right now. Come on! Come on! Out of here. Go! Go!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: What is she doing here?", "Eric: She's leaving. She's leaving the house right now.", "Ridge: Good. Dad, we need to talk.", "Quinn: Sheila, get out!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sheila: Oh, no. I wouldn't miss this for anything in the world."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzQRho9S-us"}
