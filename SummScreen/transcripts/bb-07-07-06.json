        "Nick: I'd never ask you to be a person that you're not. You want to be respected. And that's really all I want, too.",
        "Brooke: Well, I've tried to respect your feelings. But why do I always feel like I'm apologizing for things I don't think are wrong? Nick, if all I can be is a wife that you're ashamed of, maybe I shouldn't be your wife at all.",

        "[Bridget scoffs]",
        "Bridget: Must you?",
        "Corky: I was looking for a baseball score.",
        "Bridget: I am really trying to stay optimistic here, but what was my mother thinking?",
        "Jackie: This is Stephanie's doing, I'm absolutely positive. And Nicky is bound to realize it, too.",
        "Bridget: Stephanie didn't pose for this. Mom should know that Nick of all people -- he's not gonna put up stuff like this.",
        "Jackie: Bridget, you've been their biggest cheerleader. Have a little faith. That they're together at all is more your doing than anybody else's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Brooke's gonna blame me.",
        "Stephanie: No, she'll know it was me. I'll take responsibility. Why aren't you happy? At least the wedding's off.",
        "Ridge: You sure about that?",
        "Stephanie: Look, don't get me wrong, I don't take any delight in hurting nick or anyone. But I mean, a showdown like this was inevitable.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Stephanie: Mass, yes.",
        "Massimo: After I dropped you off, I doubled back to the marina. I had my driver ask some questions. And it seems that Dominick and Brooke are still below deck.",
        "Stephanie: Good.",
        "Massimo: Is it? No one's run off. Nothing's been canceled. The wedding seems to be on hold.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Is it really so wrong to want to keep private things private?",
        "Brooke: Nick, I have a public persona. People know my face, my name, my history at Forrester.",
        "Nick: They know you with your clothes on, though, Brooke. Don't you see that Stephanie and the dressmaker are using you? Do you see that?",
        "Brooke: Sex sells, Nick. Besides, that slogan was just tongue-in-cheek anyway.",
        "Nick: Screw the slogan! It's not about the slogan. You really don't get why any man in this world would object to his wife being exposed like this?",
        "Brooke: You're not just any man. You're the man that's supposed to love me and trust me and understand me. And if you can't do that, then what are we doing? I've been disapproved of most of my life, but I don't want that in the man that I marry. I just don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Maybe you should go down to the marina.",
        "Ridge: No, no, no, no.",
        "Stephanie: I think she's gonna need you after he walks out on her.",
        "Ridge: Mother, she made one request of me, and that was to let her go. I'm gonna honor that. If she comes back to me of her own free will, then there's no hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Something doesn't sound right here. Since when did I become this anti- sex freak that wants to keep you under his thumb?",
        "Brooke: Nick, I didn't say that.",
        "Nick: Well, that's what it sounds like to me. You know, I've always enjoyed you thumbing your nose up to the world, remember that? It's Forrester. He likes to call the shots in your life. That is the problem.",
        "Brooke: He doesn't tell me what to do.",
        "Nick: Well, it's okay for him to plaster your naked butt all over Los Angeles, but not okay for me to object about it?",
        "Brooke: No, I told you, he didn't do that.",
        "Nick: Don't defend him. You're always defending him. I hate that.",
        "Brooke: What if it was my idea? Would you have had a problem with it then?",
        "Nick: But it wasn't your idea, Brooke. Don't you see that? It wasn't. God, I love your unpredictability. I love it! But when things like this happen, it makes me crazy. I want to pick up anchor and I want to go to Fiji -- alone!",
        "Brooke: You can still do that.",
        "Nick: That's right, 'cause we can't go on like this. I can't be the guy who's always saying no. I don't like that guy. And you can't be the woman who never says no. So we have to draw a line here somewhere. What's it gonna be? What are you willing to give up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Now we've screwed up documents, he can't leave.",
        "Dante: I think we can count on Jackie to keep the guy here.",
        "Rick: He says he's got another wedding to get to. Come on, let's go over there.",
        "Walter: I'm sorry, I really can't stay.",
        "Dante: We appreciate you being a good sport.",
        "Bridget: And we went ahead and signed the document for you.",
        "Walter: No, that says you witnessed the wedding.",
        "Rick: Oops.",
        "Walter: No matter, since there wasn't one. Nice to have met you all.",
        "Bridget: Oh --",
        "Jackie: Walter, Walter, if you could just do me one --",
        "Rick: Look, I should probably get back to the airport.",
        "Bridget: Rick, no! Mom and Nick still might get married today.",
        "Rick: Well, you're the only one who still thinks that there might be a wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Ridge: I can't get any work done like this.",
        "Stephanie: Any news?",
        "Massimo: I just say the justice of the peace leave, and so am I. There's not gonna be any wedding today. End of story. We can leave now.",
        "Stephanie: It's official. The wedding's off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: It shouldn't be about drawing lines and making sacrifices. I want you to feel free to do what makes you happy, and I want to feel free to do the same.",
        "Nick: And I want that, too. I want to make you happy. I just don't want those people messing with our lives.",
        "Brooke: Those people are very important to me. And that's not going to change. I may not be brilliant in the way that I handle them, but nobody really is. I don't want to lose my career at Forrester. I'm back on top and it feels really good.",
        "Nick: And I'm glad for you.",
        "Brooke: Are you really? Because I'm not gonna stop pushing the envelope in what we sell and how we sell it. And I don't want to come home to a barrage of threats.",
        "Nick: Depends on how much dancing in the nude you'll be doing with your ex.",
        "Brooke: None. There'll be none of that. Ridge knows he has no chance with me. Now Stephanie, she may be a little bit more stubborn, but",
        "Nick: A little stubborn? When that woman dies, she will put her hands up, stop the coffin from coming down and yell out more instructions to you. You just want to keep me on my toes. You just don't want me to be too sure, is that it?",
        "Brooke: No, I do. I do. I want you to be sure that I love you. I just don't want to have to do everything your way.",
        "Nick: My way? [Nick laughs] My way? Oh, my God. The curveballs that you throw me on things that I believe are settled. Is that how it's gonna be? You tell me. We discuss things, we have agreements, and then you go off and do whatever they want.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie and ridge don't run my life. And I don't understand why we have to come up with all these agreements about what I can and what I cannot do. I can be respectful of you and still have a different opinion. Isn't that enough?",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Walter: I'm sorry to interrupt. Your mother thought I should mention to you that I have to be leaving.",
        "Brooke: Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry about all this, Mr. Bynum.",
        "Walter: If there's anything else I can do --",
        "Nick: You may not want to leave just yet.",
        "Nick: Not quite the way I planned this, you know.",
        "Brooke: Are you sure you want to do this?",
        "Nick: Not really. Go ahead.",
        "Walter: The contract of marriage is most solemn and not to be entered into lightly.",
        "Nick: Can we just skip ahead, please? To the meat and potatoes? Is there a problem?",
        "Brooke: I don't know. We haven't really resolved anything.",
        "Nick: Really? Well, I love you. And I'm not gonna let you go. And if we're still having this argument when we're old and helping each other glue our teeth in, well then so be it.",
        "Brooke: So we're going to argue till death do us part?",
        "Nick: No. You're gonna be you and I'm going to be me and mostly, we're gonna get along. You are it for me. That's all I know. And that's all I need to know. You got anything you want to add to that?",
        "Brooke: No. No.",
        "Nick: Continue, please.",
        "Walter: Do you, Brooke, take this man, Dominick, to be your lawful wedded husband? To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish as long as you both shall live?",
        "Brooke: I do love you. I never imagined loving anybody this way. And I never imagined anyone loving me the way that you do. It is kind of scary, though, because you see me so clearly, and you've taken me seriously like nobody ever has. But you understand my sense of humor, too. I want to make you happy. I want to make you really happy. And I know you're gonna be a great father to my kids. So, yeah. Yeah. You're it for me, too, buster. Nothing in this world could make me happier than marrying you right now.",
        "Nick: Sounds like she does.",
        "Walter: And do you, Dominick, take this woman, Brooke, to be your lawful wedded wife? To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish for as long as you both shall live?",
        "Nick: Did you know I fell in love with you the first day I met you? You know, I always think I have all the answers, but you -- you challenge me. You make me wiser, freer, more giving and forgiving. No day is the same with you. And I like that. I've been looking for you my whole life. And I'm never gonna let you go.",
        "Brooke: Sounds like he does.",
        "Walter: Are there rings?",
        "Nick: Yes.",
        "Brooke: Oh, rings, yeah.",
        "Nick: Right here. What about the big one?",
        "Nick: All right. You want to get that?",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Nick: Okay. There. You put mine on, or do I?",
        "Brooke: Oh, I put yours on.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Walter: Dominick, Brooke, you have joined yourselves in solemn matrimony. By virtue of the authority vested in me by the state of California, I now pronounce you husband and wife.",
        "Nick: We did it!",
        "[Brooke giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Jackie, there you are. What's going on? Mom and Nick aren't at the Marlin. I can't find them.",
        "Jackie: Look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: There's no one in this world for Brooke but you, and she knows it. [Phone rings] Yes?",
        "Jackie: So, you did your worst. It was no use. Brooke and my son are married. What's the matter, Stephanie? Cat got your tongue?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Something seems to have happened.",
        "Ridge: Happened like --",
        "Stephanie: It's only a matter of time, honey. You'll get her back.",
        "Ridge: So the wedding --",
        "Stephanie: She'll never be happy with him. He can't make her happy.",
