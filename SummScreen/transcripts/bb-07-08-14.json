        "Eric tells Brooke it is almost like Christmas morning. They could have lost Ridge but he is coming back to FC today just like it used to be. He would have given Ridge more time but he says he is ready and they have to trust him. Ridge is getting dressed and can't wait, although Katie tells him that he doesn't have to rush if he needs more time. He wants to get on with his life .their life. Brooke checks with Katie and tells the group that they are on their way so they need to take their positions. Eric thanks her for pulling this all together. They all wait outside as Ridge drives up, leaves the car with the valet and starts to enter the building. They have a big Welcome Back sign and one by one Rick, Caroline, Carter, Maya, Pam and her lemon bars, Carter, Thorne and Aly hug him. Inside he says he knows it is going to take time to put the pieces of the puzzle together but he knows he can with the help of this beautiful woman by his side and their support. Bill, Hope and Liam visit Liam the next morning after his attack. Wyatt fixes Liam's necklace and puts it back on him .the least he could do. Bill can not believe they let that lunatic go. Hope says live by the sword, die by the sword so a restraining order is the least he can do. They joke about Wyatt stabbing the chair, that was not Quinn. He quips well she was not playing nice so he had to take her toys away from her. Bill says he is sorry, this is Wyatt's mother but she is a lunatic. There is a knock at the door and Wyatt says he called someone who might shed some light on this. They are all surprised to see Deacon. Bill is non too happy and says he made it clear before that Deacon is not welcome so he needs to quit popping up. Deacon says he came back to be close to his daughter and has nothing to do with Bill. Bill says okay just so he knows there is no reward in this but what did happen and what can he tell them. He scoffs when Deacon says he was at a bar ..and met Quinn who paid him no attention until she found out he was Hope's dad. She was nice enough to offer him a place to stay and while he was there he kept seeing her working on this very secretive project and it involved a blowtorch. But she finally let him see it but was still evasive. Then she left with it and he knew it was not good. Wyatt says that is when he showed up and he found out about the sword and came straight to Liam's. Liam says it's kind of funny. He is alive right now because of Hope's father, his brother and a chance encounter in a bar. He thanks them both. Bill says hugs and kisses all round but he hopes they are not all buying into Deacon's BS. He is just trying to worm his way back into Hope's life. She can make her own decisions but she knows how her own mother feels and she does not need this street trash back into her life trash. Trouble follows him everywhere he goes and this hookup with Quinn is just the latest example. Deacon starts to object; this was not a hookup with Quinn. Hope adds that she is glad as Liam would not be standing here today if Deacon had not known. Wyatt adds they did not see Quinn or look into her eyes. He got through to her and knows she will not be back. And Liam says he is the proud owner of a large sword that he will be taking with him everywhere. Bill says let that be a reminder to all of them just how crazy Quinn really is.",
        "Wyatt gets a phone call from a Doctor who tells him not to worry but Quinn checked herself into a mental health facility last night. She loves Wyatt and will be in touch when she can. He relays the message to the others and Liam says he is glad as he would not want Wyatt to lose his mother. Bill comes over and puts his arms around them and says they are beginning to sound like brothers and everything is okay. Later Liam asks Wyatt if his mother has ever done anything like his before. Wyatt says not to this extreme and when it happens he does not know what to do or how to help her. Liam admits that he spent a lot of time lumping the two of them together and that was a mistake. Hope goes to Wyatt and says he has proven that. He wishes them both the best. As he leaves, Liam stops him and hobbles over and gives him a big hug. Ollie kisses Aly just before she gets a call and has to go. He is left with Maya who says she thought he was avoiding her earlier. He says yes he was. He knows about the recording. Caroline tells Eric that she is glad Ridge is back but it was kind of fun being the great Eric Forrester's go to gal with his couture line and she could get used to that. Ridge enters his office and looks around at the sketches and designs. He grabs a drawing pad and pen and starts first with left hand, then right hand. He makes a few circles. A tear falls as he realizes he doesn't have a clue what he is doing."

        "Wyatt: You know, it's the least I could do. You know, I can't repair a lot of what my mom has done, but when it comes to jewelry, I think I can handle it.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you did a lot more than fix a necklace.",
        "Hope: I still can't believe this.",
        "Bill: She actually had this at your throat?",
        "Liam: Yeah I mean, I thought... well, you can imagine.",
        "Bill: I should have come over. Hope told us about the threats, but...I never could have imagined she'd go this far.",
        "Liam: It's okay. It's not your fault. I mean, Wyatt knew all about it.",
        "Hope: So, this is where -- how did you get away from her? You're on crutches.",
        "Liam: Well, Wyatt was the one who stabbed the chair, not Quinn.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Wyatt: Well, she wasn't playing nice with her toy, so I had to take it away.",

        "Rick: When does he get here?",
        "Brooke: I don't know. I mean, I-I told Katie to call when they're getting close, so...",

        "Katie: You sure about this?",

        "Bill: Quinn cooperated with the police?",
        "Liam: Uh, we didn't call the police.",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Bill: You let that lunatic go?",
        "Liam: Yeah, it seemed like the right thing to do.",
        "Bill: We need to press charges, Liam.",
        "Liam: Well, a restraining order, for sure, and I'm -- and I'm looking into it.",
        "Hope: \"Live by the sword, die by the sword.\" I think that the least you need is a restraining order.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I don't mean to minimize this or anything, but she won't do it again. I mean, everything just kind of hit her at once -- Hope ending things with me, losing the Forrester contract, getting dumped by you again.",
        "Bill: Wait. What? Look, I know she's your mother, and I'm sorry, but she's a lunatic.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, he's here.",
        "Liam: What -- what? You invited someone?",
        "Wyatt: I did. Someone who played a key part in saving you. Hey.",

        "Eric: Thanks for pulling this together.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] You don't think it's too much?",
        "Eric: No, I don't think so. I think he'll be very, very pleased and very surprised. And he'll see how much he's loved.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Why do you keep popping up? Didn't I make myself clear when I saw you at Brooke's? You are not welcome.",
        "Deacon: I came back to L.A. to be close to my daughter. Now, you might find this hard to believe, Bill, but it's got nothing to do with you.",
        "Hope: You two getting along?",
        "Deacon: Swimmingly.",
        "Hope: Great.",
        "Deacon: Thanks, honey.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Bill: So, Deacon, what did you have to do with this? And should I mention there's no reward involved?",
        "Wyatt: Dad. Please.",
        "Deacon: No, it's all right. Um...okay, so, I was at this bar, right?",
        "Bill: Surprising.",
        "Deacon: Who do I run into but Wyatt's mother, Quinn? So, we start talking, and, uh, she's not really that interested in me until she finds out that I'm Hope's father. All right, so she -- she's nice enough to offer me a place to stay at the warehouse, and, uh, I'm a little low on funds, so I took her up on the offer. And while I'm there, she's -- she's working on this project, right? I mean, she's very secretive about it. You know, she won't show it to me. But I get kind of curious. I mean, I'm thinking to myself, \"why is she working with a blowtorch,\" right?",
        "Liam: Oh, the sword?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. So I finally see it, and, uh, I ask her about it. She's -- she's pretty evasive. And then she leaves with it. And I think to myself... [Clicks tongue] ...\"That can't be good.\"",
        "Wyatt: And that's when I showed up, ready to confront her about threatening you guys. Then Deacon told me about the sword, and that's how I knew to come straight here.",
        "Hope: Talk about being in the right place at the right time.",
        "Liam: It's kind of funny, isn't it? I mean, I'm alive right now because of my brother, your father, and a chance encounter at a bar.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Thank you. Thank you both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: A little nervous about coming here today.",
        "Katie: Don't be. Everyone's excited to have you back.",
        "Ridge: Well, just promise me they won't make a big deal out of it.",
        "Katie: Sure. Yeah. Whatever you say.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",

        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: ...Me with a bigger ego than I already have, so, uh...",
        "[Light laughter]",
        "Ridge: Thank you for that. That was -- that was a day I'll never forget. That's, uh -- that was amazing -- you guys cheering for me. I don't even know what to say, and I guess that's what we are, right? We're the Forrester family, and we support each other. And I'm not kidding myself. I know it's gonna take a little while to put all the pieces of the puzzles back together, but I-I know I can, with this beautiful woman by my side and with your support.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: I'm gonna have to. Just look at this room. Look at all the memories we made in here -- all the things we created together. I mean, that's who we are. Made me who I am. Anyway, enough said. Thank you. Get back to work.",

        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: I'm just glad I was able to -- to tip Wyatt off and that everything worked out.",
        "Bill: Gee, that's beautiful. Hugs and kisses all around. But please tell me that none of you are buying into his B.S. He's just using this to worm his way into your life, Hope, yet again. I mean, you do realize that, don't you? You heard the \"low on funds\" part, right?",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: It has nothing to do with that.",
        "Bill: You're old enough to make your own decisions, hope. Your mother realizes that. But you know how she feels. You don't need this street trash back in your life.",
        "Deacon: \"Street trash.\"",
        "Bill: Trouble follows him wherever he goes, and, uh, this hookup with Quinn is just the latest example.",
        "Deacon: Excuse me. Wait a minute. Nobody said anything about hooking up with Quinn.",
        "Hope: Look... I'm thrilled that Deacon ran into Quinn. Liam is alive because of it.",
        "Deacon: As far as trouble goes, Quinn never came back to the warehouse last night. Now, does that disturb anyone else besides me?",
        "Bill: You should have called the police -- I'm telling you.",
        "Wyatt: Look, you weren't there. You didn't see the look in her eyes when she left. No, I got through to her. She won't be coming back.",
        "Liam: Besides, I'm the proud owner of a new weapon, which I will be taking with me everywhere now.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, let that sword be a reminder to all of you of exactly how crazy she is.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Wyatt: Maybe that's her. Excuse me for a second. Hello?",
        "Dr. Fellin: Hello. Is this Wyatt Spencer?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Dr. Fellin: This is Dr. Fellin. I'm calling on behalf of your mother.",
        "Wyatt: What happened?",
        "Dr. Fellin: Please don't worry. She's safe here at our facility.",
        "Wyatt: I'm -- I'm sorry. Facility?",
        "Dr. Fellin: She'd prefer to keep the details confidential for now, but I can tell you that we have a wonderful meal-health program. She voluntarily checked herself in last night.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Uh, okay.",
        "Dr. Fellin: She wants you to know she loves you, and she will reach out as soon as she's able.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you. And tell her I'm -- I'm glad she's getting help.",
        "Dr. Fellin: Oh. I will. Take care.",
        "Hope: Was that about Quinn?",
        "Wyatt: She checked herself in last night.",
        "Bill: Loony bin?",
        "Liam: Well, you know what? I hope she gets the help she deserves, 'cause I don't want you losing your mom in all this.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Thank you. I mean, after all she's put you through...",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Bill: Wow. Look at you two. Sounding like brothers.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: Well, we did go through a lot last night, Dad.",
        "Liam: Yeah, a little bit.",
        "Bill: Yeah. But you're okay. Everyone's okay.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Well, I-I think that went relatively well.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] What -- our dads?",
        "Hope: Yeah. They were...mostly pleasant.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] I think our dad was just happy we weren't fighting.",
        "Liam: Well, it's nice, you know? It's a nice change.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I wish it was under different circumstances.",
        "Liam: Has your mom done... this before?",
        "Wyatt: Not to this extreme, but... and I see it happening. It's just I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help her.",
        "Hope: Well, she's getting help now.",
        "Wyatt: I hope so.",
        "Liam: You know, I wasted a lot of time lumping you two together, and that was a mistake.",
        "Hope: You've really proven that.",
        "Wyatt: I wish you all the best.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, wait. [Clears throat]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: How cool was that -- seeing the look on uncle Ridge's face?",
        "Oliver: I mean, not as cool as \"going out dressed in medieval clothing\" cool, but still...",
        "Aly: My knight in shining armor. You really enjoyed that, didn't you?",
        "Oliver: It was awesome.",
        "Aly: We'll have to go again soon.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Aly: Oh, I've got to deal with this. Lunch later?",
        "Oliver: Sure.",
        "Aly: Okay. See you later, Maya.",
        "Maya: Bye, Aly.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Oliver: Something on your mind?",
        "Maya: [Sighs] Just seemed like you were going out of your way to avoid me earlier.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, I was. I didn't want to ruin the festive mood.",
        "Maya: Okay.",
        "Oliver: I know about the recording.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Caroline, these are stunning. Really beautiful. You know, when I think of how you've come since you started with us...",
        "Caroline: God, was I that awful?",
        "Eric: Well...",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] No, of course not. We hired you for very good reasons. Your designs for Hope for the Future were stunning from the very beginning. But Couture -- it's a whole different animal.",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric: And you haven't been intimidated by it. You've proven that you can handle it.",
        "Caroline: Well, I was kind of forced into it with Ridge being gone.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: But now he's back, and Couture is back in his hands. But it was kind of fun, being your right hand. I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm -- I'm thrilled that Ridge is back, but it was kind of special getting to work with my father- in-law, the great Eric Forrester. [Chuckles] Being your go-to designer... I could get used to it.",
