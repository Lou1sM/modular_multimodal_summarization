        "Wyatt and Ivy work together in dressing a model with her jewelry. Wyatt even wants Ivy to wear one not just sell it. She likes the stone. Katie walks in and wonders if she is interrupting anything. She comments that she sees how Wyatt is acting and how Ivy is smiling around him. Ivy says yes Wyatt makes her laugh and that is good since Liam is spending nearly all his time with Steffy. Katie says at some point Liam is going to have to make a choice yet they both know Steffy is not going to leave Liam out of her sight. And if Liam is going to date Steffy then Ivy should date others too. There might be someone right here in the building good for her. Ivy says she does appreciate Wyatt. He's good to her and somewhere she has to draw the line with Liam. She does not know what she would do without Wyatt but he is interested in Steffy too. Steffy thinks about the massage the day before and Liam says it was good and as President she should be able to do whatever she wants. She explains she did not get much done as at the meeting Aly went off the rails again. They both thought that behavior was past but clearly it is not and they worry abut her. Aly walks around her bedroom and goes to the closet and kneels down to the I Hate Steffy board where she has Xed out many pictures of her and Maya. Dark Darla tells her that they are evil and not to listen to them. She is the only one who can stop them and that is her mission. At the Sky Lounge Maya talks to Nick how her mother came to town, the same mother who gave birth to her and she is sure her father sent her to town to take Nicole away. Nicole was the one who spilled the information but she really meant no harm and Maya will not hold that against her and thinks she deserves a second chance.",
        "Nicole is putting some papers on Rick's desk when Wyatt walks in and Nicole ignores him even when he tries to be nice and talk to her. He congratulates her for being an intern now and he wanted to talk to her at the party. She asks if it is a secret as he used her. He admits it was unfair but Rick was so terrible they had to do something to get rid of him. He did not know Bill would use that information to out Maya. Wyatt says he was not pretending, he really did like Nicole. Zende walks in and she perks up. Wyatt is friendly with him too but leaves to find Rick. Nicole finds it amusing that Zende might be jealous and she teases him when he asks if she would go out with him sometimes. She plays coy and asks if he is asking. Maya interrupts and Nicole tells her she likes Zende but Wyatt apologized. Maya wonders if Nicole is still into him. Nicole says she probably could never trust Wyatt again. Maya is glad Nicole stayed in town and did not go back with their mother. She felt rejected all over again. Aly walks into Steffy's office with Steffy and Liam all cozy and looking over designs. Aly says she knows they are busy but she wants her to know that she knows what to do now and will do anything for FC. They will see a new side to her. Both are glad and Steffy says she does not want Aly to feel left out. Aly says they can not change the future but they can change the future. Steffy and Liam are impressed with the new and improved Aly. But the new and improved Aly is in her closet looking at the Steffy collage and thinking back to when Darla was hit by the car and died."

        "Ivy: We're set. Oh, can you mark this one? Thank you so much, ladies. [Sighs] Actually, I'll take that.",
        "Wyatt: So, I got to keep this one, because I saw you eyeing it earlier.",
        "Ivy: Oh. [Laughs] Wyatt, no! I'm supposed to be selling my pieces, not hoarding them.",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Ivy: [Gasps] [Sighs] This stone, though.",
        "Wyatt: It's one of a kind.",
        "Ivy: It's beautiful.",
        "Wyatt: Looks great.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean... hi!",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Wyatt: If it isn't my lovely stepm--",
        "Katie: Don't, don't. Don't ever say that 'cause I'll have to hurt you. I'll have to hurt you real bad.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: On that note...",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: I'm gonna go find Rick. Uh, Ivy and I have a really great idea for international. So... hmm?",
        "Ivy: [Clears throat]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Katie: I-I'm -- I wasn't interrupting anything, was I?",
        "Ivy: No. [Chuckles] Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Ooh. You know what? I'm still feeling it.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: Ooh.",
        "Liam: I'm not gonna lie. It was a good massage.",
        "Steffy: We should totally convert the gym into a spa.",
        "Liam: You know what I think?",
        "Steffy: Huh?",
        "Liam: I think you're the president, and you can do whatever the hell you want.",
        "Steffy: Oh, that's good. You haven't forgotten.",
        "Liam: Mnh-mnh. So, uh, what happened in the meeting?",
        "Steffy: Oh, that. Yeah. We didn't get much accomplished. Aly went off the rails again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I just wish she could accept me as I am. She's my mother. She gave birth to me. So I look different than I used to. It shouldn't matter. We should be able to have a relationship, but she wants nothing to do with me.",
        "Nick: What I don't understand is why she shows up now. After you're all settled and comfortable in your skin, she just pops up out of nowhere?",
        "Maya: I'm sure my father ordered her to come to LA to take Nicole home, keep her far away from me.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, uh... was looking for Rick.",
        "Nicole: Not here.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, we never got a chance to talk at the party. I hear you're a full- time intern now. That's awesome. Congratulations.",
        "Nicole: Thanks.",
        "Wyatt: Look, Nicole, I know you've been avoiding me. But we're gonna be working here now, and I just -- I want to clear the air. Will you hear me out?",
        "Nicole: Oh, I don't know. Is it a secret? You used me, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: I -- it wasn't fair to you. But we had to get Rick out as CEO. He was a tyrant to everyone.",
        "Nicole: You manipulated me! You got me to open up to you, tell you my sister's secret, then you told your father. And then he told the entire world.",
        "Wyatt: I-I know, and I'm sorry, but I didn't know he was gonna do that behind my back! We thought it was about Rick extorting money or --",
        "Nicole: You pretended to be interested in me just to get information! What kind of guy does that?!",
        "Wyatt: I wasn't pretending, Nicole. I really did like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Wyatt obviously likes you.",
        "Ivy: Oh. [Laughs] I don't know.",
        "Katie: I do. I think I noticed some drool right here on his chin. And if I hadn't been here, I think he would have really gone in for that neck massage.",
        "Ivy: Hey, we are just friends. We're working together. There is nothing going on.",
        "Katie: Of course. No. Nothing at all. I'm just glad that somebody can make you smile.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. He's actually been really sweet. I mean, he knows exactly how to make me laugh, which has been great, seeing as Liam has decided to go and spend all of his spare time with Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You know, it really seemed like she stabilized for a while there.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah, I thought so, too. You know she still talks to her mom?",
        "Liam: [Sighs] I think -- I think she's isolating herself. I think she's cutting herself off from the real world.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, and she always gets involved where she shouldn't. She has these extreme opinions and reactions.",
        "Liam: It's getting way out of hand.",
        "Steffy: And with everything Aly's gone through and... her mom dying... my mom's involvement... I can't help worrying about her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darla: They're evil. Don't listen to them. They have taken everything from you. Me, the company your father and your grandparents built. This is your mission, Aly. You must stop them. No one else can save the goodness of Forrester. It's got to be you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You're a very forgiving woman, Maya.",
        "Maya: I haven't completely forgiven my parents. I don't know if I'll ever be able to.",
        "Nick: I'm not talking about your mom and dad. I'm talking about Nicole, your sister. She's the reason you got outed to the press.",
        "Maya: It wasn't her fault. She trusted the wrong person.",
        "Nick: That's big of you. I might think differently.",
        "Maya: Nicole wasn't trying to hurt me. You know, Wyatt used her. And I think she deserves a second chance. My parents are hard enough on her already. I don't need to be mad at her, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: There's no excuse for what I did, and I can't defend it. But I was under a lot of pressure from my brother and my dad to get the story, so I did. Whether you believe me or not, I really did enjoy hanging out with you. And when we kissed, I-I did feel something.",
        "Nicole: It's fine. I don't really care anymore. You can stop apologizing. [Sniffs]",
        "Wyatt: I won't bug you anymore. I just thought you should know that I do think you're pretty special.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I think you're right to consider Steffy a threat. I mean, she is a threat. At a certain point, Liam is going to have to make a decision. He can't keep stringing you along. It's not fair.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, and I don't know how much longer I can share him. I just want him and I to spend time together, you know. I've made myself so clear about that. You know, where is he? Where is he right now? He's with Steffy.",
        "Katie: Why should you share him? Why should you accept this?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Especially since we both know that Steffy is not going to let him out of her sight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Do you think this would be good as a cover-up or should we do it with sleeves?",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, sure. Sleeves.",
        "Steffy: Ooh, this would be so hot for Coachella next year. Yes. Yeah.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Liam: Nothing.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Liam: I'm -- I'm just -- nothing. I-I-I never thought that I would be vice president of a fashion house, working with my hipster, rocker, music-festival- loving ex-wife. That's all. I'm just saying.",
        "Steffy: You're just saying? Oh, I don't see you complaining.",
        "Liam: This is not me complaining. I'm loving it. I'm having fun.",
        "Steffy: Really?",
        "Liam: I am.",
        "Steffy: Yeah?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: That makes two of us.",
        "Liam: Okay, then.",
        "Aly: Do you have a minute?",
        "Steffy: Uh, Aly, um, I don't -- I don't think I have the energy for this right now.",
        "Aly: I just came by to tell you that... I heard you. I know what I need to do now. I'll do anything for Forrester Creations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: Sounds like some pretty heavy talk to me.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, Nicole and I were just having a conversation.",
        "Nicole: But we're done. Nothing more to discuss.",
        "Zende: You sure? Because I'm picking up a weird vibe here, like maybe you two need couples counseling or something.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] No, uh, I think we're good. So, Zende, enjoying your internship so far?",
        "Zende: Yeah. Met some really cool people.",
        "Wyatt: You're a Forrester. I think you're used to all this, huh?",
        "Zende: Life's different in Miami.",
        "Wyatt: Lot of beautiful people down there.",
        "Zende: Yeah. Lot of beautiful women here, too.",
        "Wyatt: That is true. Um, well, I'm gonna go find Rick. So, uh... I hope you believe what I said earlier. I really did enjoy my time with you.",
        "Zende: Wow. Didn't know you and Spencer had a thing.",
        "Nicole: Somebody jealous?",
        "Zende: No. Not me. I mean, out of curiosity, how many dates we talking? I mean, did you -- did you kiss him?",
        "Nicole: Oh, wouldn't you like to know?",
        "Zende: [Chuckles] [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I mean it. I am willing to do whatever it takes.",
        "Steffy: No, that -- that's -- that's great, Aly.",
        "Liam: Yeah, we just -- we just want to do good work, you know, make an impact, promote a brand we can be proud of.",
        "Aly: There is no one prouder of this company than me.",
        "Liam: That's -- that's great. See? That's great.",
        "Aly: You'll be seeing a new side to me. I think you'll be surprised.",
        "Steffy: That's good. Good. You know, um... I know you've been through a lot. And I don't want you to feel left out. I really want the best for you.",
        "Aly: We can't change the past. But we can change the future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: It's cute that you're jealous.",
        "Zende: So, now you think I'm cute?",
        "Nicole: That wasn't what I said.",
        "Zende: That smile you just gave me said something otherwise.",
        "Nicole: You're pretty sure of yourself.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles] You gonna let me take you out sometime?",
        "Nicole: You gonna ask?",
        "Zende: I don't know. Should I? I mean, maybe you'll be too busy hanging out with Wyatt.",
        "Nicole: Ha! Cute and funny.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Maya: Hi, Zende. Did you have fun at the Fourth of July party?",
        "Zende: Great time.",
        "Maya: Well, I know Nicole enjoyed having you there.",
        "Zende: Uh, I should probably get back to work. I'll let you two have some girl time. I'll talk to you later, yeah?",
        "Nicole: Sure.",
        "Maya: Bye!",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Maya: Um, you two are adorable.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] He's sweet. And incredibly hot. We have a good time together.",
        "Maya: Okay, so what's the problem?",
        "Nicole: Wyatt was here earlier apologizing for what happened.",
        "Maya: You're not still into him, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I think if Liam is going to date, then you should, too.",
        "Ivy: No, I mean, I could. I just don't know if I want to.",
        "Katie: Ivy, have you seen you? You're gorgeous, you're successful, you're smart. You shouldn't be waiting around for any man, no matter who he is.",
        "Ivy: If you're trying to point me in the direction of a dating site, I don't want it. I don't know how I feel about being swiped left or right.",
        "Katie: I'm not talking about swiping. I'm just saying you should keep your options open. You know, there might be someone maybe even right here in this building who could be right for you. Someone other than Liam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: So, what do you think about the new and improved Aly?",
        "Liam: Frankly, I'm shocked. I'm shocked.",
        "Steffy: I'm impressed. I was beginning to think she'd never come around.",
        "Liam: I-I know. Me, too. I guess -- I guess she proved us wrong.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Well, now that she's cool with the new line... maybe I won't get yelled at for wearing a bikini.",
        "Liam: You know, I wouldn't yell at you if you wanted to put on a bikini right now.",
        "Steffy: I know.",
        "Liam: Like, right now.",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on!",
        "Liam: [Clears throat]",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: What exactly is this president/vice president arrangement you guys got going on here?",
        "Liam: Oh, Aly! I-I didn't recognize you in flannel.",
        "Wyatt: Ha ha ha! No!",
        "Steffy: It's fun watching you guys get into it. You guys are like an old married couple.",
        "Wyatt: Wow.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Just have a little respect, okay?",
        "Liam: For you?",
        "Wyatt: For Ivy. You think she wants to come in here and see you guys getting all giddy and cozy with each other?",
        "Liam: Okay, all right. Are you sure this isn't about you? Because you haven't exactly been subtle about pursuing this one.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, nothing about me is subtle. Hi. Listen, if you two are thinking about taking this to the next level, fine. So be it. Just be honest with Ivy. I mean, are you even thinking about a future with her anymore? Or are you just stringing Ivy along?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Well, Wyatt is also interested in Steffy. And, I mean, like I said, him and I are very happy just being friends.",
        "Katie: Hmm. Steffy has tunnel vision, all right? She is only focused on Liam. Trust me.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, Liam seems pretty focused on her, too. Look, I want to be in a relationship with him. I do. But where do I draw the line?",
        "Katie: I am not going to let you be a doormat! You are too good for that! I'm just saying that you and Wyatt are kind of in similar situations and you should think about it.",
        "Ivy: Look, I'm really grateful that Wyatt's in my life. He's actually helped me through a lot over the last few weeks. I don't even know where I'd be without him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: When I think about Wyatt, I think about how I hurt you. I don't think I could ever trust him again.",
        "Maya: I don't blame you. If you ask me, I think you'd be better off with a nice guy like Zende.",
        "Nicole: Don't get ahead of yourself.",
        "Maya: I'm just -- I'm glad you're still here. I know you could have gone back home with Mom.",
        "Nicole: I'm just starting to get to know you, Maya. There's no way I'm leaving you now. Still can't believe she came to LA, though.",
        "Maya: Honestly, I was wondering when it would happen. Mom and Dad coming to whisk you away from your shameful sister.",
        "Nicole: I'm sorry for the way she treated you.",
        "Maya: Yeah. I kind of felt rejected all over again.",
        "Nicole: And I thought I had it bad, but I can't imagine how awful they were to you as a kid.",
        "Maya: I just never felt like I belonged. Like I was -- I was completely alone in the world. Vulnerable. And that can be dangerous. I kept isolating, pushing people away, living a secret life. I was depressed. I was resentful. And I kept fixating on all of the injustice around me. It's like you become consumed by your own thoughts. Obsessed with the negativity.",
        "Nicole: You made it through, though.",
        "Maya: Yeah, I did. I was lucky. You know, I had a counselor who I could confide in and trust. We hear all of these things about kids who do bad things and make bad choices, but I think it's 'cause we're not reaching out to them, you know? Like we're so connected with texting and social media, but the truth is, when you're that depressed, you can hide behind all of that. And you're actually not having any real human interaction. You feel abandoned by your friends and your family. Your past wounds just grow and grow. The bad thoughts take over. And the trouble begins.",
