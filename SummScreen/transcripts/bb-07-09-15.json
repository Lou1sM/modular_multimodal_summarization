    ],
    "Recap": [
        "Nicole thinks back when she first came to L.A. and looked Maya up ..and her attitude toward her sister. And she used information about her that was uncalled for. She is sorry about that now but Maya refuses to blame her. Nicole sees now why Maya had no choice but to leave her parent's household, and Nicole vows not to go back either. She thinks her mother knows that. And it is amazing how she can seem to love Maya and touch her yet walk away. Vivienne sits at an outside restaurant and a Julius walks up and kisses her on the cheek. He says he came as quickly as he could. Nicole will not spend one more day under Maya's influence. He does not want her corrupted. Katie understands how annoying it must be for Ivy to see Steffy and Liam spending so much time alone behind closed doors saying it is work. She hopes Ivy will be realistic about this as when Steffy wants something she will not give up. She will fight and if Ivy does move on, then Wyatt is not a bad place to land. Ivy agrees that Wyatt may come off as cocky and sarcastic but underneath he has a real warmth. It is like he knows what she is thinking without her having to say it and that is a great quality in a man. She knows too that Steffy is a massive bump in the road but she is not ready to just hand Liam over to Steffy. Katie understands but says Wyatt is another option and Ivy would not be settling as he is quite the catch.",
        "Wyatt does interrupt Liam and Steffy and gets in a dig how exceptional Ivy is and if Liam is stringing her along. Steffy seems interested in that answer too. Liam asks if Wyatt is suddenly Ivy's protector. He claims he has been 100% honest with Ivy from the time that Steffy came back. That was a wakeup call that he might lose her and he was not ready for that. Wyatt respects that but says it is not fair for him to make goo goo eyes at Steffy when Ivy is just down the hall waiting her turn. She is better than second best. Nicole can not believe Vivienne came all the way here to drag her back home. Maya agrees and says when she first saw her mother she was hoping she had come to see her and show some motherly instinct. She is just glad Nicole is there now and she can count on her sister. Vivienne calls and tells Nicole that she is still in town and wants to see her right away. Nicole says she will meet her. Maya tells Rick that her mother did not go home and her guess is she is going to try one more time to get her to come home. But she really does not want Nicole's relationship with her parents to suffer because of Maya. Nicole is shocked when she sees her father with her mother. He gets right to the point that she can go get her bags as he is taking her home. She replies no, she likes it here in L.A. and is old enough to make her own decisions. She says FC is a really great fashion place and she has even met a young man there she likes a lot. She wants to learn and even learn more about her sister in the process. Julius calls Maya a freak and says that is all Nicole needs to know. Vivienne looks offended. Maya tells Rick that she thought she would be over it by now but it was very uplifting to see her mother again and the truth is she never stopped hoping for a reconciliation. It is probably not likely but it would mean so much. Nicole tells her dad that Maya is not a freak and he never gave himself a chance to know her. He says that child is lost to both him and her mother. He will not lose Nicole too so she is coming home with them. She will have to accept that."

        "Nicole: I think back to when I first came here, and my attitude towards you was just uncalled for. I get embarrassed about it.",
        "Maya: Why?",
        "Nicole: Well, I was so selfish about everything. I had this piece of information on you that I could use, so I did, like all of the pain that you want through was some type of bargaining chip. And I'm really sorry about that.",
        "Maya: I appreciate that, but I don't blame you. You didn't know.",
        "Nicole: I didn't think. I was so caught up in my own stuff, how abandoned I felt, but I never stopped to consider what it took for you to claim your true identity -- without any support, going against our parents, leaving everything you knew.",
        "Maya: I couldn't wait to get out of that home, the constant disapproval.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] I'm not going back either. I don't care what mom says.",
        "Maya: I think she got that loud and clear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waitress: What can I get for you?",
        "Vivienne: Some green tea for now.",
        "Waitress: Okay.",
        "Vivienne: Oh. [Chuckles] I thought I'd be waiting longer.",
        "Julius: I willed that plane through the sky.",
        "Vivienne: [Laughs]",
        "Julius: This nonsense stops today. Nicole will not spend one more night under Maya's influence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You know, I have to admit -- it's a little unnerving the amount of time that Liam and Steffy can legitimately spend alone together behind closed doors.",
        "Katie: I understand why that would concern you.",
        "Ivy: Thanks.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I just want you to be realistic about the situation. I mean, when Steffy lasers in on something that she wants, she doesn't give up. Trust me. Look at the situation when Liam was with Hope. I mean, she certainly didn't let up then.",
        "Ivy: Why is he so vulnerable to her?",
        "Katie: Because she pushes people's buttons, and she's been pushing Liam's buttons for a very long time. I just want you to be careful. She has a way of pulling you into the mud, and you either choose to fight like that or you choose to move on. And if you choose to move on, then Wyatt's not a bad place to land.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Did you come here with something work related? Because we're kind of busy.",
        "Wyatt: I can see that.",
        "Liam: There it is. There's that tone. Something on your mind, buddy?",
        "Wyatt: I was reminding you of what an exceptional woman Ivy is, and it's kind of concerning to me that I even need to remind you. So, I ask you again -- are you or are you not stringing Ivy along?",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Dad must have been furious when mom came home without me.",
        "Maya: I don't even want to think about it. My very existence offends him. That's why he doesn't want you here -- my evil influence.",
        "Nicole: It just blows me away how they can judge without knowing. I mean, neither mom or dad have reached out to you to try and see who you really are. I just don't understand how she could touch you with so much love and then walk away like that.",
        "Maya: People fear what they don't know. But at least she did touch me. I mean, maybe it's her way of inching toward accepting me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivienne: I love Maya, but I don't know how to be around her, how to wrap my brain around what she expects me to understand.",
        "Julius: [Scoffs] How could you? It's unnatural. I don't want the one child we have left to be around that. She's an innocent. I won't have her corrupted.",
        "Vivienne: Well, Nicole doesn't seem that different since she's been around Maya.",
        "Julius: She defied you. Does that sound like our baby girl? We're getting Nicole out of here today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Wyatt's a good guy.",
        "Ivy: He is, and he comes across all sarcastic and cocky, but...there's a warmth to him. You know, it's like -- it's empathy. It's like he understands exactly how I'm feeling without me really having to say it.",
        "Katie: That's a pretty rare quality, I mean, especially in a man. That's attractive.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, he's been a really good friend, actually. You know, Hope was crazy to let him go.",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "Ivy: Although, she let go of Liam, as well. Let's just hope Steffy follows suit.",
        "Katie: Yeah, let's. But she tends to be a bit... tenacious.",
        "Ivy: I mean, Liam and I don't share what he shares with Steffy, obviously, but I'm important, too.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: I don't want to be replaced so easily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: What is this, Wyatt? What are you doing right now? Are you Ivy's protector all of a sudden?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, if she needs one. Yeah, why not?",
        "Liam: Well, she doesn't, okay, not from me.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, really? Okay, well, I'll decide that after you answer my question.",
        "Liam: Fine. You want me to answer your question? No, I am not stringing Ivy along. I've been 100% up-front with her since the beginning.",
        "Wyatt: Is that including now?",
        "Steffy: Do you guys want the room? Do you want me to leave.",
        "Liam: No, no, you don't have to go anywhere. Listen, I don't know what it is that you're trying to scope out here, but Ivy's not casual to me.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Liam: I care for her. Yes, the immigration thing was a wake-up call. Suddenly being married made me realize that I could lose Steffy forever. And, no, I wasn't quite ready for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm just saying that Wyatt is another option. And you wouldn't be settling. I mean, he's a catch.",
        "Ivy: Katie...",
        "Katie: Yes?",
        "Ivy: ...Are you playing matchmaker?",
        "Katie: I cannot believe that you would accuse me of that. I'm just -- I want you to be happy because I like you.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, Liam does that.",
        "Katie: You sure? Because it's hard to tell through all this concern over Steffy.",
        "Ivy: Look, she is a massive bump in the road, but let me tell you one thing -- I'm not just gonna hand Liam over to her.",
        "Katie: And I respect that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Why do you have to have all the women, Liam? You're in here making googly eyes with Steffy while Ivy's waiting down the hall for her turn. Pick a lane, dude.",
        "Liam: Why are you in this?",
        "Wyatt: Ivy is good people. Ivy's smart, she's funny, she's talented --",
        "Liam: What are you doing right now?! You don't need to sell me on Ivy, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: So, then treat her better! What? I mean, okay, I get it. You and Steffy have this amazing history that connects you in a way that no one can ever understand. Fine. Then go be together. Go do what you got to do. Just, for the love of God, stop dragging Ivy around. She deserves to be treated better than second best.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I still can't believe mom came all the way to L.A. to drag me home.",
        "Maya: I got to admit -- when I first saw her at the door, I was kind of hoping she came for me. Like, maybe with all the publicity, she had a change of attitude, or, I don't know, it touched some motherly instinct.",
        "Nicole: That's amazing -- that after all the ways they've ditched you, you still want their acceptance.",
        "Maya: They're my parents. They're the first people I loved. Why wouldn't I want them to love me back, as I am?",
        "Nicole: I just wish they could see how wrong they are. You're not some evil influence.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: You're -- you're an inspiration, Maya.",
        "Maya: I don't know about all that.",
        "Nicole: No, I'm so proud of you. And it just -- I just don't like the fact that they can still make you feel bad.",
        "Maya: Only for a second. Because you're here. Thank you so much for being on my side. It means -- it means a lot.",
        "Nicole: Always count on me.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Nicole: It's Mom.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Nicole: Hey, Mama.",
        "Vivienne: Hey. I'd like to see you, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: I thought we settled this. I'm not coming back home.",
        "Vivienne: No, I'm still in L.A.",
        "Nicole: You're still here?",
        "Vivienne: Yeah, at a coffee shop. Write down the address.",
        "Nicole: Okay, but...",
        "Julius: Tell her to come now.",
        "Vivienne: Um, I don't have much time, so could you come right away?",
        "Nicole: Right this minute?",
        "Vivienne: Yes, please.",
        "Nicole: Okay. Be right there.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Julius: Good job. You've just put us one step closer to getting our little girl home.",
        "Nicole: Why is she still here?",
        "Maya: Probably some last-ditch effort to get you to leave.",
        "Nicole: Well, that's not happening.",
        "Maya: Then you stick to that. You know, I don't want you to alienate our parents because you're defending me. You shouldn't have to live without them the way that I did. They're not perfect, and they might not be as open-minded and embracing as we want them to be, but like me, they are who they are. And they deserve acceptance, too.",
        "Nicole: Okay.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You Spencer boys sure do like Ivy Forrester, huh?",
        "Liam: Yeah, I mean, what's not to like?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, maybe I should get to know her better.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Steffy and Ivy, best friends -- that's, uh -- that's scary.",
        "Steffy: Oh, really? It's scary, huh?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: For you.",
        "Liam: That's exactly what I'm saying.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] Okay. What do you think about this? This one.",
        "Liam: Right, um...",
        "Steffy: Work, work, work.",
        "Liam: Yeah, work. Uh...I like it. It's, uh -- it's sexy, um, but it's kind of toned down from the other stuff. It's -- it's like, uh, casual in a movie popcorn sort of way.",
        "Steffy: Yeah?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: I was just thinking it's one of those, like, \"I woke up like this, uh, uh.\"",
        "Liam: Well, no, it's --",
        "Steffy: Like a pow, you know what I mean?",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, it's good for, like, a funkier line. It's, um, targeted towards women that don't necessarily want to be in lace all the time.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Hmm?",
        "Steffy: Nothing. I, um... I just knew this would happen.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Steffy: Us.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Oh.",
        "Steffy: Working together, bouncing ideas off each other. You're a lot of fun, Liam.",
        "Liam: And you're the most fun I've ever had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: Caught me. Sorry.",
        "Ivy: [Laughs] Caught you doing what?",
        "Wyatt: Just appreciating you. And thinking about how you deserve to be treated better right about now by Liam, but...",
        "Ivy: Hey. There it is. This is this protective streak that Katie and I were just talking about.",
        "Wyatt: You and Katie were talking about me?",
        "Ivy: Uh-huh.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Ivy: We were. Well, Spencer men in general, actually. Hey, can I show you this?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: Ta-da.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, you showed me this one before.",
        "Ivy: Yes, I-I know. It's just -- I can't figure out what it is about it that's not hitting me.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, sit down. Step away from the easel. Step away from the easel. Sit.",
        "Ivy: [Groans]",
        "Wyatt: It'll come to you. Okay? Don't worry about it.",
        "Ivy: I know you're right. I probably - I need the distraction.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, from Liam?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Yeah, Katie pretty much just told me, without really having to say it, but she thinks I've already lost Liam to Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I thought your mother went back to Illinois.",
        "Maya: So did we. I guess she's not done trying to persuade Nicole to go back home.",
        "Rick: Do you think that she will?",
        "Maya: I don't think so. She's pretty adamant. And she likes her life here, and she's old enough to make that decision. Not that my father will respect any of that.",
        "Rick: I don't see how it's his choice. It's not like he can force Nicole to go back home.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] You don't know my dad. I just hope that Nicole and my mom don't get into a big fight over it, you know? I don't want my sister's relationship with our parents to suffer because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivienne: Hey, honey. Thanks for coming so quickly.",
        "Nicole: I'm surprised you're still in town. I thought you were headed back.",
        "Vivienne: Plans changed.",
        "Nicole: Okay. So, what's going on?",
        "Julius: You're coming home. Today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Most fun you ever had, huh?",
        "Liam: Don't expect that to change.",
        "Steffy: I know it wasn't always rainbows and butterflies. After we lost our baby, I --",
        "Liam: Uh, you know, we don't -- we don't' have to -- we don't have to go there.",
        "Steffy: No, I... you know what? I can talk about it now. I can reflect on the past. I never considered myself a quitter. I really didn't. I quit on you. And I ran away. And I left you to deal with the pain on your own.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but you know what? You did what you had to do.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I know.",
        "Liam: You did.",
        "Steffy: And we talked about this, but it... I can't help it. I... I hurt you along the way. But it had to have some lingering effect. It's like you -- you don't trust if I'll stay, hmm? Yeah, yeah. I thought so.",
        "Liam: Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop. Look at me. Look at me. I don't blame you for anything. Okay?",
        "Steffy: I know. I know that now. I really do. But I want you to know something. I'm not running away. Honestly, I'm not gonna run away. I'm not avoiding this. I'm here now. I'm here where I belong -- with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I was looking forward to a ridiculous summer, you know? I thought I'd be spending it getting to know Steffy.",
        "Ivy: Well, you still can.",
        "Wyatt: No, I can't.",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Wyatt: Not as long as Liam's in the picture. No. She can't see me through him.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, you do realize there are other women in this town, not just Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: I know that. I do. Would have been fun, though.",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. Mm. I mean, where am I gonna find a total package like that? She's sexy, beautiful, talented, sophisticated.",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah. Same thing here. I mean, Liam is one of a kind, you know? He -- he's sweet and he's sensitive and he's -- he's charming and romantic and --",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] I just -- I wish someone would tell me where another guy exactly like him hung out.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: We have a car. We can take you to that place you're staying, and you can pick up your things.",
        "Nicole: Daddy, no. I'm not leaving.",
        "Julius: Don't argue, Nicole. You're a young and impressionable girl.",
        "Nicole: I am a woman. Old enough to make my own decisions.",
        "Julius: You are in way over your head. L.A. is not the place for you.",
        "Nicole: I like it here. I'm making my life, got a job with a future.",
        "Julius: [Scoffs] In fashion? Where is your head, girl?",
        "Nicole: It's a great opportunity.",
        "Julius: For you to land in a world of trouble, and I won't have it.",
        "Nicole: All due respect, Daddy, it's not your call.",
        "Julius: You are my daughter.",
        "Nicole: Your grown daughter.",
        "Julius: Not as grown as you'd like to think. Somebody's got to look out for your best interest. And as long as I am the head of this family, that's gonna be me.",
        "Nicole: You're not listening. You never listen. I am building a life. I've even met a really nice guy. We're interning together, and you know, I think you'd like him. But you're wrong, Daddy. Forrester Creations is not some shady place. It's corporate, just like any other business, and I want to learn it and get to know my sister in the process.",
        "Julius: Your sister is a freak, and that's all you ever need to know.",
        "Nicole: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: What was it like seeing your mother after all this time?",
        "Maya: It was uplifting for a minute. And then I saw that same old look in her eyes.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry.",
        "Maya: You'd think I'd be over it by now. But the truth is that I have never stopped hoping for a reconciliation with my parents, for my dad to look at me and not see the ghost of the son that I never was, and my mom not to be so disappointed and confused. I know it's not likely, but it would mean everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Maya is not a freak. You don't even know her. You never even tried to.",
        "Julius: And I never will. Your brother, sister, whatever he's become, whatever he's done, I don't even recognize my own son.",
        "Nicole: Because that's what you're looking for. And Maya is a woman.",
        "Julius: Don't talk to me about it. That child is lost to his mother and to me. And damn if we're gonna lose you, too. You are coming home now. Accept it."
