        "The doctor tells RJ that his shoulder will be sore for a while but it was a mild concussion so he is a lucky young man. He will be fine. Brooke wants to talk to him alone. She thanks God that he is okay. But she wants to know how Coco crashed the car. Coco talks to Sally and Sally says they all missed her at her grandmother's party. Coco says all is okay but she is at the hospital with RJ. there was a little accident. Thomas takes the phone and wants details. Coco admits that she was driving one of Ridge Forrester's cars. Sally asks if someone hit her and again Coco has to admit no and the accident should not have happened but she hit a tree. RJ tells his mom that Coco is not a bad driver but stuff happens. Lt. Baker shows up and says RJ is lucky but he needs a few details. Coco speaks up again that she was driving, not RJ. Thomas speaks with the doctor and tells Sally that RJ is going to be okay. She asks if they need to go there as she'd like to give Coco a good talking to. Thomas says no they have had a rough day and no need to add to it now. Sally hugs Thomas and says she is over protective but nothing must happen to Coco. That is not even an option.",
        "Between the two of them, RJ and Coco try to explain what happened; how Coco lost control of the car. Lt. Baker asked if she were drinking and she replies no. He asks if she were distracted and Brooke adds something must have happened as you don't just drive down the street and run into a tree. Lt. Baker says RJ is doing all the talking as if he is trying to protect Coco. Brooke suddenly asks if she was texting .that could cause the accident. Sally cannot concentrate and tells Thomas that she cannot think about what might have happened and something like this can really screw up your life forever .everything can change. He says yes sometimes things happen in amazing ways to change your life. She certainly has changed his in way he did not expect. Coco finally answers that yes she was texting. RJ immediately says she admitted it so can they leave it at that. Lt. Baker gives her a small lecture of how many people are killed each year because of texting. He will have to file a report. When he leaves, Brooke points her finger at RJ and says when he is driving again, which will be a long time from now, no phone and neither for Coco. Thomas laments to Sally that she is always talking about endings and him beginnings and he wants her to know that he is not going anywhere. Except now; Saul calls and needs him in the sewing room. Sally gets a call for Thomas. It is Caroline, the mother of his son so says Caroline. She's in town and needs to talk to Thomas so please tell him that she called. Coco cries to RJ that she could have been responsible for something stupid that could have been avoided. It is not over and maybe there is more for her to learn from this. She is so sorry. He says whatever the consequences she will not be in this alone."

        "Sally: Did someone hit you?",
        "Coco: No, no. I, um... I ran into a tree. [Sighs] Thank god R.J.'S all right.",
        "Sally: Look, coco, I'm sure it wasn't your fault. These things happen.",
        "Coco: It shouldn't have.",
        "Brooke: I still don't understand why coco was driving your father's car.",
        "R.J.: I wanted to impress her. I knew she'd never driven a car like that. I knew it would give her a rush.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "R.J.: Coco is not a bad driver, mom. Just...stuff happened, you know?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Okay, so just tell me exactly what happened.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Lt. Baker: Mrs. Spencer, R.J. Well, you look pretty good, all things considered. I just came from the crash site. Could have been a lot more serious.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, well, I'm lucky. I should get a lottery ticket.",
        "Brooke: R.J., This isn't funny.",
        "Lt. Baker: No, it's not. An accident like that could have landed you in the morgue. You were driving?",
        "Coco: No, I-I was driving, lieutenant. It was my fault.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, thank you, doc. No, that's -- that's great news. Okay, yeah. Yeah, thank you again. I appreciate that. Coco was right. R.J.'S okay.",
        "Sally: [Sighs] Okay, well, uh, do you want to go down to the hospital and give my little sister and her boyfriend a talking-to?",
        "Thomas: No. It's okay. They've had a rough day as it is. Doc said that they will release him sometime later today.",
        "Sally: Okay, well, I'm not waiting. Next time I see coco, I am going to give it to her.",
        "Thomas: You sound like her mother.",
        "Sally: Well, I practically was her mother and her sister rolled into one.",
        "Thomas: It's a very attractive package.",
        "Sally: Seriously, though, if anything happened to coco even when we were kids, I felt totally responsible.",
        "Thomas: What about Shirley?",
        "Sally: Okay, yes, we had grams, but she was busy with the bakery, so I was on coco duty.",
        "Thomas: That seems really tough.",
        "Sally: No, I loved it. She looked up to me. I taught her the ropes. Or I tried to. That's why it hurt her so much when I betrayed her.",
        "Thomas: Babe, that only lasted for a minute.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, it was a minute too long. I love coco, and I am always in her corner, no matter what, and she knows that.",
        "Thomas: You know what? You are going to be an amazing mother someday.",
        "Sally: [Sighs] Well, I pity that kid.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] You did a really good job with coco. Come on. Give yourself some credit.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, I just happen to be very overprotective of the people close to me.",
        "Thomas: Oh, I've noticed.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, you and coco -- if anything happened to you guys, I, uh, I would be a case. And you don't want to see that. [Sighs] I'm just glad she's okay. Nothing is allowed to happen to my sister. It is not an option.",
        "Lt. Baker: You were driving?",
        "Coco: Yes.",
        "Lt. Baker: You're, uh, sally spectra's sister, right? Uh, name again?",
        "Coco: Coco.",
        "Lt. Baker: Coco. Right. So, care to tell me what happened?",
        "Coco: I was driving, and I lost control, and I ran into a tree.",
        "Lt. Baker: Well, what caused you to lose control of the car, coco?",
        "R.J.: She'd never driven a classic car like that before.",
        "Lt. Baker: Your car?",
        "R.J.: My dad's.",
        "Lt. Baker: And you let her drive it to, uh, impress her?",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Lt. Baker: And then what happened?",
        "Coco: Uh, like I said, I just -- I lost control.",
        "R.J.: Power steering has come a long way since then. I mean, as cool as it is, even it gets away from me sometimes.",
        "Lt. Baker: So you've been driving recklessly, too, then, huh?",
        "R.J.: No, sir.",
        "Lt. Baker: Were you drinking, coco?",
        "Coco: No. No.",
        "Lt. Baker: Nothing at all? Not even a little earlier?",
        "Coco: Nothing. Nothing. I-I swear.",
        "Brooke: I believe you.",
        "Coco: Thank you.",
        "R.J.: This could have happened to anyone.",
        "Lt. Baker: In the middle of a clear day with no wind, no weather conditions? It seems kind of odd, doesn't it?",
        "Brooke: Something must have happened to cause this accident.",
        "Lt. Baker: Were you distracted?",
        "R.J.: Okay, can we please not do this? Look at her. She's shaking. Here. Come here. Come on, coco. It was scary. We've never been in a car wreck before. We promise to be more careful next time.",
        "Brooke: Sorry, but that's not good enough, R.J. Lieutenant baker wants to know the answer, and so do I. You don't just drive down the street and hit a tree.",
        "R.J.: What do you want me to tell you, mom? We weren't drinking, we weren't doing drugs. We were just having a good time, and things went bad.",
        "Lt. Baker: Well, the question is why did they go bad, R.J.? Seems you're answering all the questions. It's like you're trying to protect your girlfriend.",
        "R.J.: Coco doesn't need protection.",
        "Brooke: Lieutenant baker wants to get to the bottom of this. What was going on? Were you two goofing off? Were you texting, coco? Is that what happened? Is that what caused this accident?",
        "Sally: Ugh! [Sighs]",
        "[Paper clatters]",
        "Thomas: Been a day, huh?",
        "Sally: I just can't stop thinking about what might have happened.",
        "Thomas: But it didn't. So...don't think about it.",
        "Sally: Always Mr. Positive.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Sally: It's just crazy, isn't it, like, how quickly things can change? You leave your house one morning, and you never know what's out there that could just screw up the rest of your day or your entire life.",
        "Thomas: That's exactly what R.J. And coco were thinking. They were just going for a drive on a nice day.",
        "Sally: Yeah, and then bam. Everything changed.",
        "Thomas: But life can sometimes change in amazing ways.",
        "Sally: Like the way you changed mine? It's just amazing when you think about it. It was not that long ago that I was back home working at the bakery.",
        "Thomas: Look at her now. Professional, epic.",
        "Sally: I know. Lucky me.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: And what about you?",
        "Thomas: You changed my life in ways that I never expected, and I never want it to end.",
        "Sally: Sometimes scares me whenever you say things like that.",
        "Thomas: Wow. It's not the way that I intended that to be taken.",
        "Sally: Look, I'm not trying to think negatively, Thomas. I just don't want the bottom to fall out, like it always has before.",
        "Brooke: Were you, coco? Texting and driving?",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Lt. Baker: Answer the question, miss spectra.",
        "Coco: Yes.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Coco: I was texting.",
        "R.J.: She made a mistake, okay? And she learned her lesson. Can we leave it at that?",
        "Lt. Baker: First of all, texting and driving is illegal in this state. Over 3,000 people a year are killed because of distracted driving. This is serious.",
        "Brooke: You knew this, R.J.! Your father and I have had numerous discussions with you about this!",
        "Coco: So has my grams.",
        "Brooke: Well, then why did you do it?! You could have killed my son!",
        "R.J.: Mom. I'm sorry. We're sorry. It won't happen again.",
        "Coco: [Voice breaking] I didn't -- I didn't think that it --",
        "Lt. Baker: That it could happen to you? That's what everybody says. But it only takes a second from taking your eyes off the road.",
        "Coco: So, um, what happens now?",
        "Lt. Baker: There are consequences for your actions, miss spectra. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured. But I will file a report. I'll get back to you.",
        "Brooke: Next time you're driving, which isn't going to be for a very long time, you're not going to be on your phone. Either one of you.",
        "Coco: Your mom is right. I could have killed you, R.J. And all because of a stupid text. I am so, so sorry.",
        "Thomas: The bottom is not about to drop out, except for maybe Steffy when we drop our swimwear collection in Monaco and the whole world sees it. That will be amazing. But that's not gonna happen to us.",
        "Sally: It's just that I have a pattern. Good things always come to an end for me. And you're the best thing that's happened to me in... since forever.",
        "Thomas: See, you keep talking about endings, and I'm always talking about beginnings. And I am not going anywhere unless you are with me.",
        "[Intercom buzzes]",
        "[Intercom buzzes]",
        "Thomas: Mnh-mnh. Just ignore it. Ignore it.",
        "Sally: Mmm.",
        "[Intercom buzzes]",
        "Thomas: Ugh! Okay, okay. Business. We're in a place of business. I should... yeah, mm-hmm. Hello? Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, you just -- you -- it's -- it's sim-- all right. Yeah. I'll come down. Yeah. God, it is like Saul knows when we're making out even when he's down in the cutting room. It's insane.",
        "Sally: [Laughs] Hmm.",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Sally: Darlita! Telephone! That's your job!",
        "[Ringing continues] Spectra fashions. Sally spectra, please.",
        "Sally: You've got her. Who's this?",
        "Caroline: Caroline Spencer.",
        "Sally: The mother of Thomas' son?",
        "Caroline: Oh. So he has told you about Douglas.",
        "Sally: Of course.",
        "Caroline: May I speak with him?",
        "Sally: He's actually not here right now. Uh, why don't you try his cell phone?",
        "Caroline: I have.",
        "Sally: Okay, well, would you like me to take a message?",
        "Caroline: Actually, yeah, I would. Um, look, I realize that you two are in a relationship, but he and I do have a son to think about.",
        "Sally: O...kay.",
        "Caroline: So, um, just please have Thomas call me and I'll take it from there.",
        "Sally: [Sighs]",
        "Coco: So what happens now?",
        "R.J.: It was an accident, okay? Nothing's gonna happen to you.",
        "Coco: No, it was totally my fault, R.J. It's all on me.",
        "R.J.: I don't want you blaming yourself for this.",
        "Coco: Well, your mom certainly does. And just wait till your dad finds out. Texting while driving. What was I thinking? And it only took a second, and look at what happened. [Voice breaking] When I saw you unconscious --",
        "R.J.: No, no, don't go there.",
        "Coco: No, but I could have been responsible for something [Sniffles] Really, really, really terrible. And lieutenant baker was right. There are consequences for what I did, and I deserve them. I did something stupid and foolish, and it could have been so, so tragic.",
        "R.J.: But it wasn't.",
        "Coco: I know. And thank god. But it's not over, and maybe it shouldn't be. Maybe there's something more than I need to learn.",
        "R.J.: Coco. Let me just tell you this. Whatever lieutenant baker has in store, whatever the consequences, you're not doing this alone. I'm gonna be there right by your side, and we're gonna get through this together.",
        "Coco: You mean so much to me, R.J. So much. I'm so sorry."
