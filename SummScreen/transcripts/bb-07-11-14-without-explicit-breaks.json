He doesn't want to hide in her bedroom so they decide to go back to FC. Wyatt reads Hope and Liam a text from his mom to apologize to Liam. She is getting needed help and this will never happen again.

        "Wyatt: \"I'm getting treatment. It may take a while, but I'm determined to conquer my demons. Please tell Liam how grateful I am for his understanding and for not pressing charges. Also, let hope know how truly sorry I am. Nothing like this will ever happen again.\"",

        "Liam: Wyatt, if she had gone this far before, you would have.",

        "Liam: You kind of saved the day, bro. I mean, if it weren't for you --",
        "Wyatt: Well, I mean, if it wasn't for hope's dad alerting me -- we kind of owe him, too. But... mostly I owe you guys for not pressing charges.",

        "Wyatt: What am I thinking? Your -- your ankle. Elevated, right?",
        "Liam: Well, I --",

        "Bill: Quinn could escape from the nut house and sabotage our wedding.",
        "Brooke: No. No. That's not gonna happen -- unless, of course, there are still some of those selfies floating around of you and Quinn.",
        "Bill: Thankfully, no.",
        "Brooke: Good, because Ridge has paid the price, and he still is.",
        "Bill: Yeah, his memory -- or lack thereof.",
        "Brooke: It's only a matter of time before it all comes back. But in the meantime, he's very frustrated. There are still so many missing pieces.",

        "Brooke: Well, maybe not one. But then how were you to know that Quinn was gonna set all that in motion?",
        "Bill: Quinn is the last thing I want to talk about. Let's talk about where we're going on our honeymoon.",
        "Brooke: Every morning waking up next to you is a honeymoon.",

        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: When do you get the boot off, anyway?",
        "Liam: Soon, actually, but you know what's funny? I'm starting to get used to it. These stupid crutches, though, not so much.",
        "Wyatt: The crutches?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Maybe I should get a pair of these bad boys, huh? We can have a crutch- off, like a crutch race, around the living room here.",
        "Hope: [Laughing] It is always a competition. It will always be that with you guys.",
        "Wyatt: That's how we relate. That's -- we're brothers. That's what we do, right?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Actually, you know what? Um... I was kind of thinking maybe we could change that, 'cause if not now, when?",
        "Wyatt: Uh [Chuckles] I don't quite follow.",
        "Liam: I know.",
        "Hope: Um...",

        "Wyatt: Aww. You got me a present?",
        "Hope: Liam did. It's from Liam.",

        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: Uh... it's a bow tie.",
        "Liam: It is.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you. [Chuckles] I-I don't -- I don't wear a lot of these things.",
        "Liam: Yeah. About that. Um...I'm hoping you'll make an exception at our wedding. Wyatt, would you be my best man?",
        "Wyatt: I got to say... this is one ugly bow tie. This is. This is pretty bad.",
        "Liam: It I-- it is. It's -- it is. It's very ugly. Um... but I'm hoping you'll wear it anyway [Grunts] 'Cause of what it means.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: I want there to be a new appreciation between us. I want to start treating each other with honesty and respect. And we're all gonna be Spencers, you know? We should get along. We should start acting like it, and what better time than now? Of course, if you're gonna start dissing my wardrobe choices, then, you know --",
        "Wyatt: No. I -- listen. That -- okay. Do I have to wear a cummerbund? Because I don't -- I feel like they're restricting.",
        "Liam: Are you saying yes? Are you saying you'll stand up for me? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Wyatt: I -- don't you think that dad is gonna expect you to ask him?",

        "Hope: I heard! I heard!",
        "Bill: So, you think we'll beat hope and Liam to the altar?",
        "Brooke: Maybe we should have a double wedding.",
        "Bill: I got a better idea. How 'bout a double elopement?",
        "Brooke: Mm.",
        "Katie: So, uh, Eric is in a meeting. You have the whole place to yourself. You know, there's no pressure. You can take your time.",
        "Wyatt: It's valentine's day. This is the day where a guy really has to step up his game. I mean, we're finally together, and you think I want to botch the most romantic day of the year? Unh-unh.",
        "Hope: I didn't get you anything.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, you did!",

        "Wyatt: Who -- who are you? We have news.",
        "Wyatt: About? Ricardo Montemayor.",
        "Wyatt: What about him? Se\u00f1or Montemayor is dead.",
        "Wyatt: Dead? How -- what? When? How? May we come in?",
        "Wyatt: Uh...yeah. I-I just -- I can't believe it. Was he ill or in an accident or...? Se\u00f1or Montemayor left something for you. He knew of your love of this special piece. He had no children, no family. It was important the piece be left with someone who appreciated it as much as he did. A diamond that captured your fascination and the world's is now yours.",
        "Hope: I am.",
        "Liam: Yeah? Back at Wyatt's, the way I reached out to him.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Hope: You're welcome.",
        "Liam: You're such a gentleman.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: So, admit it -- you're super impressed with me right now.",
        "Hope: I am.",
        "Liam: Yeah? Back at Wyatt's, the way I reached out to him?",
        "Hope: I think you did a lot more than reach out. You asked him to be the best man at our wedding. That's -- that's quite the gesture.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I think it's more than a gesture. I mean, I really did mean it, you know? I want this to be a new chapter for all of us.",
        "Hope: And so do I. So does he.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: I mean, he agreed to wear the bow tie.",
        "Liam: That hideous bow tie.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: I mean, I've -- I've been burned by the guy before, unfortunately, but I'm not thinking about that. I'm thinking about the positive. You know, I wouldn't be alive right now if it weren't for Wyatt. Quinn is not even in the picture. I can't imagine a bigger game-changer than that. Can you?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Wyatt: This -- I mean, this can't be happening. Uh...are you sure that there isn't, like, a mistake that was made here? Se\u00f1or Montemayor made his wishes very clear. The diamond belongs to you. You're a very lucky young man, Mr. Spencer, but with great fortune comes great responsibility.",
        "Wyatt: What -- what is this? It's from Se\u00f1or Montemayor. The flash drive should answer all of your questions. Se\u00f1or Montemayor's attorney will be contacting you to formalize the transfer, but he left strict instructions that upon his death the diamond be brought immediately to you. He trusted you would guard it with your life.",
        "Wyatt: Y-yeah, and -- and I will. It's just I -- Good luck, Mr. Spencer. We'll see ourselves out.",
        "Brooke: A double elopement with my daughter and your son?",
        "Bill: Yeah, I think we could twist their arms, make it happen.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yeah. That'll really put you on hope's good side.",
        "Bill: Ah. Good point. Okay. We will nix that. They can do their thing, and we'll do ours. Now that I think about it...",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Bill: Well, maybe getting married in front of Ridge and company isn't such a bad idea, given the fact that that loser let you slip through his fingers. It would give me an opportunity to rub it in.",
        "Brooke: Which is what our wedding should not be about.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on. How 'bout a little victory dance?",
        "Brooke: I just want us all to get along. When Ridge is feeling better, he and Katie can start moving forward just the way you and I are doing, and then we can all do the victory dance.",
        "Bill: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Brooke: I'm not sure that this is the best thing to do.",
        "[Helicopter blades whirring]",
        "Justin: Hey, Katie. Have you seen Rick? Uh, n-n-never mind. I'll check his office.",
        "Ridge: Hey, you!",
        "Bill: You flew all the way here to make a jerk out of yourself?! Typical!",
        "Brooke: What are you doing?!",
        "[Helicopter blades whirring]",
        "Brooke: Ridge!",
        "Katie: Ridge."
