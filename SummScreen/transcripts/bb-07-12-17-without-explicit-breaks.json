    "Recap": [
        "Quinn tells Brooke and Ivy that Eric did not spend the night at home last night and even some clothes are gone. She has no idea where he is. They both tell her they think he just wants to be away for a while and think. Meanwhile Eric tells Sheila it seems more than a coincidence that she shows up in the same motel and on the same floor. Some people would call that stalking. Bill listens to his sons and Steffy and says he has no problem with Katie being at the Summit but he draws the line with Spectra. He does not want them near there. Steffy disagrees and says it is time to put them out of their misery. Liam even throws it in that it will be great publicity and for a good cause. Bill chides him for his good causes. Quinn tells them she understands Eric wanting to be away but the least he could do is call and let them know he is all right. Sheila says she would not have been above stalking Eric in the past but that is not who is she now. He wants to be alone and rest and starts to go in his room. She politely asks if she can come in for a minute. His brains must be lost as he allows her to. She says this is a great place to get lost. She cares about him and cannot imagine what he is going through being betrayed by his own wife and son. She does not want to cause him any more pain. She laments that he is such a kind, loving, trusting man but he deserves to know the truth so she had to tell him. Katie says it does not matter who told Eric, the damage has been done. Bill says he is a pretty good judge of character and he does not like Sally. How did he know that nitwit Jarrett would write his own great review and give her hope. Quinn calls Eric again and leaves a voice mail to please call and let his whole family knows he is okay. She tells Ridge that she broke his heart. She broke her vows and he may not look at her again but she just needs to know he is okay.",
        "Sheila asks Eric if he has his medications. He says no, he left too soon and he does not want to go back home and get them. He bragged about Quinn and then he defended her and now this. He rails that even Brooke knew. She should have told him. So there is no one he can trust now. Sheila says yes; he can trust her. He needs his meds and she will go to the house and get them. She will be very discreet and try not to see anyone. He finally agrees. She bends down to where he is sitting and tells him that he is not alone. Bill says he trusts Steffy but not her father, the dressmaker. He is a wild card. He is hoping he can count on Spectra being a huge belly flop and he can topple that building for his own beautiful skyscraper. Brooke tells Ridge that Sheila is Eric's ex- wife and now she blows into town and he is relying on her. Ridge says all for a few kisses he may lose his dad. Eric remembers his wedding vows to Quinn. He starts drinking and kicking his suitcase of clothes around. Sheila sneaks in the Forrester manse and makes her way upstairs. She is caught when she comes down. She tells Quinn that she came for Eric's medicine and he does not want to see anyone. Quinn grabs her by the arm to restrain her from leaving. Sheila gives her that cold stare and tells her to never touch her again."

        "Quinn: Eric didn't come home last night. How can I not be concerned?",
        "Ivy: So, he hasn't let anyone know where he is? He didn't say when he might be back?",
        "Quinn: There are clothes missing from his closet. I have no idea where he is!",
        "Katie: He just found out about you and ridge. Clearly he was upset. Maybe he just needs some space.",
        "Quinn: I know, I have been texting him and calling him, though, and I thought maybe one of you had heard from him.",
        "Brooke: I tried again on the way over, but he didn't pick up.",
        "Ivy: See, this isn't like uncle Eric. He at least calls and tells someone that he's okay.",
        "Quinn: I -- I've been calling all of the hotels that I can think of, thinking that maybe he just wanted to check in for the night, but... he's just -- he's nowhere to be found.",
        "Ridge: Maybe that's the idea.",
        "Eric: I'm surprised to see you here, Sheila.",
        "Sheila: Me, too. What are the odds of us being at the same hotel?",
        "Eric: Yeah. Same floor. Rooms right next to each other. What are the odds?",
        "Sheila: The two of us here, together... I guess some might call that fate.",
        "Eric: Some might call that stalking.",
        "Sheila: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: What are you up to, Sheila?",
        "Wyatt: How long she in town?",
        "Steffy: Uh, Caroline? Long enough for Thomas to regain his senses and leave sally spectra -- at least, that's what I'm hoping.",
        "Bill: Sally can't hold a candle to my niece. But I wouldn't get my hopes up just yet.",
        "Liam: Well, they share a kid. I mean, it'd be nice if they got back together.",
        "Bill: Caroline brought Douglas by my office earlier today. Gave me a chance to work on some vocab. Stock market, hedge fund, et cetera.",
        "Liam: Aww, important terms every toddler should learn.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Caroline also said she spent some time with Tommy boy.",
        "Steffy: I think it's good for Thomas to be with his son, reminds of his obligations and it keeps him away from sally spectra.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm not so sure Caroline should be stuck with Thomas -- no offense. However, as far as spectra is concerned, we totally agree. That clown show should be obliterated from the planet.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah. So you can build that thing.",
        "Bill: Don't listen to him. He dresses like a grammar school teacher. He can't appreciate your sensual beauty.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, yeah, he occasionally talks to it.",
        "Bill: Speaking of spectra, I have no problem with Katie's idea for the summit. However, I have a big problem with Thomas and spectra trying to ride our coattails.",
        "Liam: Well, Jarrett was live-streaming. Steffy couldn't very well say no.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, he really put her on the spot.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I saw it, and it pissed me off. I don't want spectra anywhere near my event.",
        "Steffy: I don't like how Thomas manipulated his way in, either, but a swimwear fashion competition in Monte Carlo against spectra? I mean, we can't lose.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, an old rivalry re-emerged. I mean, Spencer and the other outlets are gonna cover it like crazy.",
        "Bill: Which means more buzz for spectra. Which we will minimize on our end.",
        "Steffy: I don't think so. I think it's the perfect setting to finally put them out of their misery.",
        "Quinn: Maybe we should call lieutenant baker. Maybe he can help.",
        "Brooke: Look, Quinn, we're all as concerned as you are, but let's face it -- Eric isn't missing. He left of his own accord. And we all know why.",
        "Quinn: I understand, I know. I-I don't blame him for wanting to get away from me. I just wish he would call, let us know that he's okay.",
        "Ivy: He's been missing one night. I'm sure he's gonna walk through this door any minute.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, he's gonna check in eventually. There's no need to panic.",
        "Quinn: This is what I was afraid of. Telling him about these meaningless kisses, and he's gone. This is why we didn't want to tell him in the first place!",
        "Ridge: Well, we decided to tell him, but Sheila beat us to it.",
        "Sheila: I understand that you don't trust me, that you might think that I was stalking you. And in the past, you're right, that's exactly what I would have been doing, but... that's not the case anymore. And the fact that you're just right down the hall from me and in the same hotel, that's... a remarkable coincidence.",
        "Eric: Yeah. Look, Sheila, I'm exhausted. I really need to get some rest.",
        "Sheila: Hey, Eric, I -- I can see that you're upset. And finding out what you did about your wife and your son, I just really don't want to leave you alone right now. May -- may I come in? Just for a moment.",
        "Wyatt: I thought you said you were onboard, that you liked Katie's idea.",
        "Bill: A swimwear competition at the Spencer summit, it makes perfect sense.",
        "Liam: Actually is pretty genius.",
        "Steffy: Considering it was Katie's first pitch as head of pr.",
        "Bill: Like I said, I was all for it until your brother invited himself along for the ride. Now I don't feel so hot about it.",
        "Liam: It's a fashion duel. It's fun, it's entertainment. You raise some money for good causes...",
        "Bill: Oh, Mr. Causes! Here we go.",
        "Wyatt: All right, look, I'm sure this isn't exactly what Katie wanted, but we'll work with it. This is some great publicity for everyone.",
        "Steffy: And a chance to put an end to spectra fashions fair and square.",
        "Brooke: We're the only ones who know about this secret, so how could Sheila have found out?",
        "Quinn: I still don't know!",
        "Ridge: None of you said anything, right?",
        "Ivy: No, well, I mean, not me. I've never even met Sheila and from what I've heard, I don't want to.",
        "Brooke: No, you don't. Trust me. Nothing good happens when she's around.",
        "Quinn: Katie?",
        "Katie: No, I already told you. I gave no indication as to what was going on between the two of you.",
        "Ivy: Well, maybe somebody saw you -- paparazzi in Australia?",
        "Brooke: No! We would have heard something, we would have seen pictures.",
        "Katie: Well, it doesn't really matter who told Eric. The fact is, the damage is done!",
        "Quinn: Well, of course it matters! Sheila is highly unstable! I can't imagine anyone trusting in her or confiding in her. She's crazy! God help Eric if he's with her!",
        "Sheila: I still can't believe that I ran into you. I've been staying here for a while, and this -- this just doesn't seem like your cup of tea.",
        "Eric: It's not. That's why I chose it. I don't want anyone to find me.",
        "Sheila: I don't blame you. This is a good place to get lost, be by yourself. Unless you run into someone you used to be married to, and she doesn't leave you alone. Eric... I care about you. I can't even imagine what you're going through. The hurt, the deception, knowing that Quinn and ridge... I -- I debated on whether or not I should even tell you, but I didn't want to hurt you. I've done so much of that in the past already, and I just -- I don't want to cause you any more pain. You're such a good, honest, loving man. You deserved to know the truth.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my -- you are so obsessed with that building!",
        "Bill: She'd be halfway done by now if it wasn't for sally spectra.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] It sucks not getting what you want, doesn't it?",
        "Bill: Well, you should know, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Not cool. Not funny. Not cool.",
        "Liam: Oh, too soon.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? Oh, you can dish it out, but you can't take it, huh?",
        "Steffy: Okay, why is it every time I'm with you guys, it feels like I'm in a fraternity? Every time.",
        "Bill: Phi beta Spencer. I'm gonna make you an honorary member.",
        "Steffy: Ooh! I'm honored.",
        "Bill: You should be.",
        "Liam: It's the best compliment you can get from this guy.",
        "Steffy: \"Oh, I think I'm gonna cry.\"",
        "Bill: I'm a pretty good judge of character. And I don't like sally spectra.",
        "Wyatt: Because she's keeping you from your pet project over there?",
        "Bill: Not for long.",
        "Liam: Mm, careful. Remember what happened last time you tried to intervene to eliminate spectra?",
        "Steffy: Uh, yeah, the bad review you wrote is the reason why my brother works there and not at the family business.",
        "Bill: All right, how was I supposed to know that nitwit would write a big, fat check and become an investor?",
        "Steffy: Don't worry about it. It's all gonna work out. Just let Forrester handle it. We can take care of Thomas and spectra on our own, bill.",
        "Quinn: Eric, honey, can you just please call me? Just let me know that you're okay. Everybody here is so worried about you, and... I -- I love you so much. Please. Okay. Bye.",
        "Ivy: Why don't we try calling Pam or one of his other friends?",
        "Quinn: No, he's so private. He wouldn't have told anybody else.",
        "Ridge: I've talked to the pilot. He hasn't taken the jet anywhere.",
        "Quinn: And I called all the credit card companies. He hasn't used any of those, either.",
        "Brooke: It might take Eric some time before he's ready to reach out.",
        "Ridge: What are we gonna do, just sit around here all day? Is that what we're doing?",
        "Quinn: No, I'm not leaving here until he comes home!",
        "Katie: I think you have to be a little bit patient. I'm sure he's not in any danger.",
        "Quinn: How can you say that? We don't even know where he is!",
        "Ivy: Eric's not gonna do anything stupid. He's smart. I mean, he might be angry right now, but...",
        "Quinn: He's heartbroken! I broke his heart! I betrayed him. I was disloyal.",
        "Ridge: We both were.",
        "Quinn: No, I am his wife. I made promises, I made vows to him, and I broke them. With his own son! And I don't know that he's ever gonna be able to look me in the face ever again, but I just want him to call me and tell me that he's okay!",
        "Sheila: Do you have everything you need? I... did you get your medications?",
        "Eric: No. No, I didn't. I got -- I left the house so quickly, I didn't, no.",
        "Sheila: Eric, you need your medications.",
        "Eric: I know, I know. Always a nurse, aren't you? I don't want to go to the house. I don't want to see that -- I don't want to see her.",
        "Sheila: Of course. I understand.",
        "Eric: I believed in her, I defended her, I... I bragged -- I bragged to everyone how loyal she was and how much... how faithful she -- and ridge! Time and time again, I forgave him, and I gave him so many chances. I forgave him over and over again, and this -- and this, I just can't.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Eric: [Scoffs] It's her, again. I can't talk to her. Not now. And Brooke -- Brooke knew! She didn't tell me! Somebody should have told me! Who can I trust now? Who am I gonna trust now?",
        "Sheila: You can trust me. Have you taken any of your meds today at all?",
        "Eric: No. No, no. I'll be fine.",
        "Sheila: No, Eric, it's important that you take them in your condition. Look, why don't -- why don't you just let me go to the house and pick them up for you?",
        "Eric: Uh... why -- what if she's there?",
        "Sheila: No one -- no one is gonna see me. I'll be very discreet. They won't even notice that I've been there.",
        "Eric: All right.",
        "[Keys jingle]",
        "Eric: Get my, uh -- get my electric razor while you're there, okay? Will you? Thanks. [Groans]",
        "Sheila: Of course. Eric, look at me. You're not alone. I will defend you. I will look out for you. I will be here for you.",
        "Bill: I'm not saying you can't get the job done.",
        "Steffy: What are you saying?",
        "Liam: Yeah, what's with the skepticism?",
        "Wyatt: Have you met him? This is his typical 24/7 \"doomsday's upon us\" attitude.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? I'm Mr. Optimist. But I'm also Mr. Realist. And while I have total faith in you as co-C.E.O., The dressmaker's another story.",
        "Steffy: Okay, can you please not call him that?",
        "Bill: Fine. The poser. Okay! Your father! Ridge! The co-C.E.O.! He's a wild card!",
        "Liam: Oh, so that's what this is about.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: No. Not entirely. I have to protect my reputation and my investments. I can't let the, uh, demise of spectra and the future of the Spencer empire rest solely in the hands of... Forrester creations. I'm sorry, but that would be a rookie move.",
        "Steffy: You're not planning something, are you?",
        "Bill: Well, be prepared for them to have a huge belly-flop.",
        "Liam: [Groans] Dad! How bad are we talking here?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, we don't to humiliate anyone here, dad.",
        "Bill: Spectra will take care of that all by themselves. Then, finally -- finally I can level that dump of a building and build my beautiful baby.",
        "Ridge: [Exhales sharply] I just had to get out of there.",
        "Brooke: Quinn seemed concerned.",
        "Ridge: We're all concerned, right?",
        "Brooke: Yes. Of course we are. I'm sure your father is furious and very hurt. Still nothing. He usually gets back to me right away.",
        "Ridge: Well, he's disappointed in all of us. None of us told him the truth. He had to hear it from a virtual stranger.",
        "Brooke: Sheila is his ex-wife.",
        "Ridge: She hasn't been here in years, and then she comes into town and just blows everything up.",
        "Brooke: My heart breaks for what Eric's going through right now.",
        "Ridge: I just wish I could tell him how sorry I am.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I'm sure you'll get your chance.",
        "Ridge: I don't know about that. He trusted me, and I betrayed him. I betrayed you. I lost you over some stupid little thing, kisses with someone I didn't even care about. And now I may lose my dad.",
        "Quinn: I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and endless devotion to you. [Sobbing] Eric, please don't make me leave like this.",
        "Eric: Go, Quinn! Go!",
        "Eric: This thing that, uh, Sheila's been saying -- you deny it, right?",
        "Quinn: We want to make it very clear -- there was never any affair.",
        "[Keys jingling]",
        "Quinn: Eric? Eric, is that you? What are you doing here?",
        "Sheila: I was just leaving.",
        "Quinn: Wait a second. What the hell were you doing in my house?",
        "Sheila: I was getting Eric his medication.",
        "Quinn: You know where he is?",
        "Sheila: Yes.",
        "Quinn: Tell me! I've been worried sick!",
        "Sheila: He doesn't want to talk to you or ridge or anyone else in the family.",
        "Quinn: I am his wife. I need to know where he is.",
        "Sheila: I can't. I won't. Sorry.",
        "Quinn: Hey --",
        "Sheila: Don't you ever touch me like that."
