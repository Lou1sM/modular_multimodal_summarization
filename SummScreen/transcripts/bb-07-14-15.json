        "Liam has Bill and Katie to stop by. He really needs more of a woman's advice but Bill says he knows the score. Steffy always has been, always will be the woman for Liam, so his love life should be okay now. Liam says no offense but he does not think he has to have Bill tell him once again how perfect Steffy is. Katie tells him that he has two women now that he is stringing along and he has to make a choice. Bill says again that Ivy was only a substitute til Steffy came back, there is no choice now. Maya says she is happy to have her parents in her life. They say they will be in touch. When they leave Vivienne asks Julius why he said those things to Maya, so unlike him. He does not answer right away. In fact he says just leave it alone. She says she knows he does not accept Maya so why would he do that. He says he is going to try but he does not know if he can accept what she has become. There is no more to talk about. He adds that his parents raised him with solid values and he hoped that for his own children. He had a job and good people in his life but when Maya became Maya all of that changed .a child he gave everything to. This is how he gets repaid.",
        "Nicole goes home and is surprised when she is not the one to tell Maya that their dad is in town. Maya says her parents were here and just left. Nicole rants that he had no right to turn on his child and should not have come. Maya defends him. She says it used to be that way but her dad called her his girl today and she thinks his view has now changed. Bill tells Katie that Steffy's first choice has always been Mr. Wishy-Washy. And now with Hope out of the way his feelings for Steffy is stronger. Katie says she thinks another Spencer man has a good ring \u0096 Ivy and Wyatt. They could make fantastic babies so maybe fate will intervene. She has a champion in Wyatt and maybe they do not realize it yet but Ivy now has a choice. Liam is aghast. Even Steffy agrees that the other's choice are okay with Maya being lead model for the fashion show. Only Aly has that look on her face and she wishes things were as they were. But she says whatever she has to do now for her family's company she is in ..whatever it takes. Even Rick is in a good mood and admits his ego used to be in the way but he's on board with all of this. Aly almost hurls but makes a quick exit to get away from the others. Maya says she can not believe it that her dad who could not accept her now is holding her in his arms and wants to spend time with her and see her in a different light. He is trying to accept her. Nicole leaves and calls her mom and is told they are at the coffee shop. Nicole tells them not to leave; she is on her way. Ivy says she has not seen Forrester pull together like this in a very long time. They are all surprised they are seeing a new side of Aly too. Aly goes home and starts cringing as she looks at the hatred collage. Dark Darla tells her only she can stop them. Julius tells Nicole to sit down and not make a scene. He says he made Maya no promises. He only said he would try. Nicole says somewhere between him leaving home and coming here he had a change of heart and she is finding that hard to believe. She says she does not want to think the worse but this is a sudden turnaround. Is he lying or does he mean what he said to Maya. Rick listens as Maya tells Rick the good news about her dad's new view."

        "Bill: A dilemma?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Something you can only talk to your dear, old Dad about?",
        "Liam: Uh, n-- actu-- well, I-I was kind of hoping for more of a feminine perspective.",
        "Katie: Oh, imagine that.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Liam: It's -- list-- it's not that I don't value yours. It's just that sometimes you're a little --",
        "Bill: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This about your love life, isn't it? A choice between Ivy and Steffy. Liam, it's a no-brainer. Steffy was, is, and will always be the woman for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: All right, everyone, let's get started.",
        "Ridge: California Freedom is about to launch. We need to hype it in a provocative way.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, something that speaks to the message that California Freedom conveys.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but it's about more than that.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, it is, because we're capturing a mood, a spirit, a-a sense of acceptance and -- and tolerance.",
        "Carter: That sounds great, but how do we go about it?",
        "Steffy: Translate it from the concept to the runway, you mean?",
        "Rick: I am sensing our CEO has an idea.",
        "Ridge: I have an inspiration. I do, yep. Maya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: [Sighs] This feels like a huge first step, Dad. It means so much to know that you're gonna try to accept me.",
        "Vivienne: Your father and I should be going.",
        "Maya: Oh, yeah. You must be worried about missing your flight.",
        "Julius: We're not leaving LA today. Not after everything that's happened.",
        "Maya: Thank you. Again. To have my parents... my father... back in life...",
        "Vivienne: We'll be in touch.",
        "Maya: Okay.",
        "Vivienne: [Chuckles]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Vivienne: Why did you say those things to our girl?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: All due respect, Dad, I don't think I need you to tell me again how perfect Steffy is for me.",
        "Bill: I'm glad you realize it. Then slip a ring on her finger and get thee to a minister ASAP.",
        "Liam: Not that simple.",
        "Katie: Because Ivy has feelings for Liam, and Liam has feelings for Ivy.",
        "Liam: See? This -- right there, that's what I'm talking about. She gets it. Thank you.",
        "Katie: Yeah, maybe more so now that Ivy's kind of opened up to me.",
        "Liam: What does that mean? You -- you had a heart-to-heart?",
        "Katie: You could say that.",
        "Liam: What did she say?",
        "Katie: Liam, you just have to make a choice, okay? You've got these two women in your life.",
        "Liam: I know! I have two fantastic women that I don't want to hurt, I don't want to string along, and I'm already \u0096 [indistinctive as Bill interrupts]",
        "Bill: Then cut the Aussie loose.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: She was a stand-in for Steffy, anyway, right? You know I'm right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Don't look so surprised. Maya's our lead model. Of course she's gonna be front and center.",
        "Aly: You're saying she's gonna be the face of California Freedom.",
        "Ridge: She's much more than that. Her story's more than that.",
        "Wyatt: And you want to capitalize on it.",
        "Ridge: Not the right word and not what you mean, but yes.",
        "Ivy: I think I see what you're getting at. It's not so much about transgender as it's about acceptance, you know? Just letting people live their lives as long as they're not hurting anyone else.",
        "Caroline: Exactly. And -- and that is what the Freedom line is all about. It's being free to be your true self.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, and what woman doesn't want to be her true self?",
        "Ridge: You're not saying much. You don't like the idea?",
        "Rick: I don't like it. I love it. And so will Maya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Nicole: You won't believe what happened.",
        "Maya: That was gonna be my line.",
        "Nicole: You okay?",
        "Maya: Did you know our father was in town?",
        "Nicole: Who told you? Rick?",
        "Maya: How would Rick know?",
        "Nicole: I went to Forrester looking for you after I was ambushed by our parents. Rick was there, so --",
        "Maya: So while you were there with him, I was here...with our parents. They just left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivienne: Why won't you answer me?",
        "Julius: [Sighs] Leave it alone, Viv.",
        "Vivienne: Do you really intend to try to accept Maya? Huh? You don't. Why did you tell her that? Why would you do that to our daughter?",
        "Julius: We have one daughter. Our other child... look, Viv, I'm trying really hard here. But I don't know if I can accept Maya because of what she's become.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I am so sorry, Maya. Our dad, he'll just never change.",
        "Maya: Nicole --",
        "Nicole: I wish he hadn't come. I wish they would have just left us alone.",
        "Maya: Just listen to me.",
        "Nicole: No! I see what you're doing. You don't want me to turn against our dad no matter what horrible things he said to you, so you're pretending that it doesn't matter.",
        "Maya: It doesn't matter.",
        "Nicole: Of course, it does! He has no right to treat you this way! You are his child! You are not supposed to turn your back on your kid no matter what!",
        "Maya: Okay, but it's not that way anymore.",
        "Nicole: What?",
        "Maya: At least I don't think it is.",
        "Nicole: What do you mean?",
        "Maya: Nicole, something happened today that I thought would never happen. Our father called me his girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Don't look at me like that. You know what this did to me, losing my son like this years ago. It was like a death.",
        "Vivienne: I know you feel that way.",
        "Julius: My parents raised me with solid, traditional values. I wanted to give the same to my children.",
        "Vivienne: You gave it to them. Both Nicole and Maya are good girls.",
        "Julius: Nicole used to be. You heard how she back-talked me.",
        "Vivienne: She was defending her sister. Julius, what you did back at that house --",
        "Julius: Look, you know what our lives were like before all of this happened. I had a good job. We were well-respected in the community. But when Myron became Maya, our whole world turned upside down. And it's only gotten worse. I don't have a good job anymore. Our friends aren't our friends anymore. Why? Because of a child that we gave everything to. This is how I get repaid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: FYI -- Ivy is not a stand-in for anybody.",
        "Bill: Right. Look, she's smart, fun, cute. Hell, she could be the second coming of Elizabeth Taylor. But she ain't Steffy.",
        "Katie: All right, enough about Steffy, Bill.",
        "Bill: What, Katie? Come on. You're not as tired of Mr. Wishy Washy over here as I am? Steffy has always been his first choice.",
        "Katie: Except when Hope was his first choice.",
        "Bill: Forget Hope. She's out of the picture. And Ivy will be, as well, as soon as Liam admits that his quickie marriage to her was a wake-up call.",
        "Liam: What are you -- what are you talking about, Dad? I have admitted that. I have also admitted that I'm not rushing into any decisions because I want to take my time and I want to think this through and...[Sighs] Yeah, if -- if I'm being honest with myself, my feelings for Steffy are stronger.",
        "Bill: Hallelujah!",
        "Katie: All right, all right.",
        "Liam: Come on.",
        "Katie: We all understand that you're struggling, and Ivy and Steffy understand that, too, because you've been open and honest with them, which I suppose is a decent thing to do. But after listening to you and talking with Ivy, I'm just wondering if maybe Ivy's with the wrong Spencer brother.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Katie: Well, Ivy and Wyatt -- it kind of has a nice ring to it, don't you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So, in addition to Maya, I think we should add some other transgender models to the show.",
        "Caroline: Not that trans models are new to the fashion world.",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Ivy: No, but we are pushing the envelope.",
        "Rick: Or are we?",
        "Carter: What do you mean?",
        "Rick: Well, we're not shoving it down people's throats. We're just acknowledging that people should feel free to contribute their talents and not be judged for who they are or who they were born to be. Maya certainly feels that way.",
        "Caroline: Which is exactly why there's just a ground swell of support for her out there.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a brilliant idea. Live and let live.",
        "Carter: [Sing-songy] Somebody's bucking for a raise. [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: Okay, now that Maya's taken the lead, I want to step back from modeling. I mean, I loved the shoot, but this is something I wanted to do now that I'm president.",
        "Wyatt: Which she never lets us forget.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Ivy: [Clears throat]",
        "Ridge: So, are we all okay with this?",
        "Aly: Well... I know you're all wondering. \"Is she going to climb up on her soapbox again and lash out?\" But like I told Liam and Steffy, I get it. Things aren't like they were when my grandparents founded Forrester. I wish they were, but... it's okay. Whatever I have to do for my family's company, I'm in. Whatever it takes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Where's that coming from?",
        "Katie: Well, you have to admit that Ivy and Wyatt would make beautiful babies.",
        "Bill: You've already got them making babies?",
        "Katie: I'm just saying that Liam is trying to choose between two fantastic women, and maybe fate will intervene and make the choice for him.",
        "Liam: Hol-- hold on a second. Is this -- did you say this to Ivy?",
        "Katie: Well, not in so many words.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: But, listen, if Ivy wants to fight for you and not just hand you over to Steffy, that's her choice. But she has a champion in Wyatt. Maybe they don't even realize what's happening yet. And maybe nothing's happening. But the possibility is there. How would you feel about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: That's got to be a first. Everyone's in agreement.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Rick: New era of cooperation rolls on.",
        "Ridge: Thanks in part to you.",
        "Wyatt: Almost sounds like a compliment, boss.",
        "Ridge: It's an acknowledgment of the past year.",
        "Rick: You mean my ignominious rise and fall from power? What? I'm the first to admit I let my ego get in the way.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Ridge: You made the company a lot of money, so you must be good for something.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: Okay, on that Kumbaya moment, let's get back to work and make this the best fashion show ever.",
        "Carter: Yeah.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You could imagine my surprise, walking in here and seeing our father. I think my face looked about like yours does right now.",
        "Nicole: What did Dad say?",
        "Maya: Well, of course I thought it would be more of the same, how I was no child of his and what an embarrassment I was or worse.",
        "Nicole: And obviously that's not what happened?",
        "Maya: \"I had to see my girl.\" For the first time, our father called me his girl. To finally hear those words, it was --",
        "Nicole: Too good to be true?",
        "Maya: And that's what I thought at first, too. How could he change? This man who turned his back on me years ago, who -- who couldn't acknowledge who I was is suddenly standing here in my home and he's holding me in his arms and not pushing me away. Nicole, can you imagine how that felt that he's finally trying to understand who I am?",
        "Nicole: What else did Dad say?",
        "Maya: He said he wants to spend time with me and -- and get to know me and this life that I'm living.",
        "Nicole: It's like he's seeing you in a different light?",
        "Maya: I think he's changed, sis. Or at least he's trying to.",
        "Nicole: Look, I've got to go. We'll talk later.",
        "Maya: Okay.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Where are you and Dad?",
        "Vivienne: At the coffee shop where you met us before.",
        "Nicole: Don't leave. I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Your designs, your ideas -- in fact, the only thing that you're more amazing at...",
        "Ridge: Is that and picking the perfect woman.",
        "Caroline: I mean, yeah. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: It sounds like Ridge is really on to something.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, I haven't seen Forrester pull together like this in a very, very long time.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, even the four of us are getting along.",
        "Liam: [Gasps]",
        "Wyatt: [Gasps]",
        "Ivy: Hey, you know what's even weirder is how cooperative Rick is being.",
        "Wyatt: You know what's scary in a good way?",
        "Liam: Hmm?",
        "Wyatt: Aly. How she's going along with everything.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know, right? Well, she did say that we would be seeing a new side to her.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah, and we are. Just in the nick of time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: You are Ridge inspiration? Where's the decency?",
        "Darla: You have to stop them, Aly. Only you can stop them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I was on my way home, and I was gonna tell you about Ridge idea, but then I got your text. Something major happened.",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: What is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Why didn't you tell me you were going to see Maya?",
        "Julius: Sit down, little girl. Don't make a scene.",
        "Nicole: What were you thinking, saying those things to her?",
        "Vivienne: Well, your father was just trying to --",
        "Nicole: Make her believe that he's a different man? That he wants a relationship with her?",
        "Julius: I made no promises. Just that I would try.",
        "Nicole: Which means everything to Maya. But she didn't hear you earlier going on and on about how you are still disgusted with her, blaming her for everything that's wrong in our family. Come on, Dad. Are you telling me that between then and when you showed up at the Forrester mansion, you've had a change of heart? That's what you're asking me to believe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You have the same look on your face that Nicole did when I told her. I think she had a hard time believing it, too. But I guess people can change, or at least it seems that way. I mean, I'm sure he's not fully in acceptance of me, but he's trying. And for now, that's enough. It's more than enough. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I don't want to think the worst, but how can I reconcile what you said to me and then this sudden turnaround? Were you lying to her, Daddy? Did you honestly mean everything that you said to her?"
