        "Steffy takes a call from Quinn who tells her that Eric is gone. He took off and has not been home. She thinks he is with Sheila Carter. Sheila finds Eric in bed and tells him that she brought back his medications. And if he needs anything else she can always go back. He asks how it went when she ran into Quinn. Sheila says not well. Sheila says Quinn begged her to say where Eric was but she would never betray him. Steffy and Liam rush over to talk to Quinn who fills them in on all she knows. All that matters now is how to get Eric back as he is surely in the clutches of Sheila. Thomas and Caroline share some play time with Douglas. She says it was not that long ago that he cared about her and wanted a family with her and Douglas, he needs that. She did not mean to leave for so long but she needed to see her moms. Thomas says he understands but he thought they were going somewhere. She says she cared about him but it was confusing and she did not want to be with him just because they had a child together. And then he started dating someone and that hurt. Sally walks in and sees Caroline flirting with Thomas and offers to come back another time. Sally asks Caroline if she has her flight plan with her; surely she must be wanting to get back to the Big Apple. Sheila tells Eric that she had to fight off a confrontation with Quinn but everything ended okay.",
        "Quinn tells Liam that Sheila is so territorial that it is scary. Sheila will not leave Eric's side if she has anything to do with it. She cannot just stand here; she has to go do something. She is not sure but she felt Sheila's purse and she thinks she may have a gun in it. Liam tells Quinn she can go and they will stay and try to track Eric by his phone. With Quinn gone, Steffy comes back and has a gun in her hands which shocks and scares Liam. Steffy says they may need it with Sheila involved. Liam has a lead on Eric's phone so they take off. Eric tells Sheila that he needs time to wrap his brain over what happened between Ridge and Quinn but Sheila has to know there will never be anything between them. Sheila replies that she knows and she will keep him away from his family and he never has to see any of them again. She offers to get him something to eat and drink; just let her fuss over him for a little while. Suddenly there is a knock on the door and it is Steffy and Liam. Sheila answers the door and they push past her to find her grandfather. Alone Thomas tells Sally that he loves being around Douglas. She admits he is adorable and Caroline wasn't terrible. Thomas says he is glad she feels that way because she is the mother of his child and she will always be in his life. Sally says she knows Caroline has more on her mind than that. Thomas says maybe but like it not it is Sally he is with now. Steffy and Sheila get into a shouting match. Sheila says they are not shacking up together. She has a room down the hall and is only here to take care of Eric and bring him his medicine. She is not going anywhere and Steffy says Sheila has no right to tell her she cannot see her grandfather. Sheila goes to her purse to retrieve Eric's razor and Liam alerts Steffy who thinks Sheila is going after a gun. She pulls her own gun and shoots Sheila."

        "Steffy: I should take it. Hey.",
        "Quinn: Have you heard from your grandfather?",
        "Steffy: Uh, not recently. Why?",
        "Quinn: Your father didn't tell you?",
        "Steffy: Tell me what? What's wrong?",
        "Quinn: Eric's gone. He took off. With Sheila carter.",
        "Eric: [Groans] [Sighs]",
        "Sheila: Hey, sleepyhead.",
        "Eric: [Gasps] Sheila. [Exhales sharply]",
        "Sheila: I picked up your medications and your razor.",
        "Eric: [Grunts] Thank you.",
        "Sheila: You need anything else, just let me know because I can always go back to the house and pick it up.",
        "Eric: Any run-ins with ridge?",
        "Sheila: With ridge? No.",
        "Quinn: Quinn, then. How did that go?",
        "Sheila: Let's just say your, uh... your cheating wife doesn't like me too much.",
        "Caroline: I missed this.",
        "Thomas: Me, too.",
        "Caroline: And it's good for Douglas, you know, having us this way -- together.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Douglas: [Whispers] Yeah!",
        "Thomas: It's important for him to see us like this. Even though we're not together, we're not married... he needs to know that we're a family.",
        "Caroline: We always will be.",
        "Caroline: Is he asleep?",
        "Thomas: Before I even put him down.",
        "Caroline: Always with you! With me, he fights the nap every single time!",
        "Thomas: I don't know what to say, I've just got that magic touch.",
        "Caroline: Well, that settles it. We got to move back to L.A.",
        "Thomas: I would love it if you came back.",
        "Caroline: To los Angeles, or...something more?",
        "Thomas: Caroline, I...",
        "Caroline: I know, I know. You've -- you've got sally now, and you've got a whole new life over at spectra. And I'm sure that's really fun and exciting, but... it wasn't that long ago that you were excited about me and wanting to raise Douglas together. I just remember how bad you wanted that. How much you cared about me.",
        "Thomas: I still care.",
        "Caroline: It's not too late. I mean, we could make it work, we can give Douglas the family that he needs.",
        "Eric: What did Quinn say?",
        "Sheila: Just more lies. How it was meaningless, the kiss with ridge, and it was just a flirtation.",
        "Eric: Geez...",
        "Sheila: It's disgusting, isn't it? She begged me to tell her where you were.",
        "Eric: Sheila, you didn't -- you didn't tell her!",
        "Sheila: No! I would never betray you. You're safe with me.",
        "Liam: How long have they been gone?",
        "Quinn: I'm not sure. I -- I wasn't here when they left.",
        "Steffy: Then how do you he's with Sheila?",
        "Quinn: Well, she was with us when we were -- Eric and I had a fight, which Sheila was all-too-happy to witness, and... and then I left them alone, and when I came back, he was gone.",
        "Liam: Okay, but how long are we talking, like, minutes, hours?",
        "Quinn: No! He didn't come home last night.",
        "Steffy: What? Oh, my god!",
        "Quinn: Well, she came here this morning to pick up his medication, and she just -- she wouldn't let on at all about where he is!",
        "Steffy: What were you fighting about?",
        "Quinn: It doesn't matter! What matters is getting Eric back.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, away from that psychopath.",
        "Caroline: You know, this doesn't have to be just a visit. I mean, aren't you tired of only seeing Douglas on a screen? I know he wants more.",
        "Thomas: I mean, I fly out when I can.",
        "Caroline: Well, you used to. But now you're always so busy at spectra. And, look, I -- I realize it's my fault. I'm the one who left. I moved to new York, but I just hope that you understand that I needed time with my moms.",
        "Thomas: I do understand. And I hope that you know that I never tried to make you feel guilty for any of that. But that was hard for me. You know, I thought we -- I thought we were going somewhere.",
        "Caroline: We still are, from my perspective.",
        "Thomas: What changed? Because when I was in new York, you were not this confident about us.",
        "Caroline: Well, yeah, I wasn't confident. I mean, we'd only just started being parents together, and... and I cared about you, but it was confusing. I didn't want us just to be together because we have a child, you know? And then you stopped visiting, and... I felt empty. I missed you. And not just because I missed a father for Douglas, I -- I missed you and the man that you are, I missed spending time with you and hearing you laugh, and just -- I missed watching you read a magazine from across the room. And then I started hearing rumors that you're moving on, and...",
        "Thomas: We agreed that if something came along, we wouldn't wait.",
        "Caroline: I -- I know, I know, and that was fine, in theory, but... but then to have it actually happen, for you to start dating someone... it hurt. But like in a really good way, in a \"go fight for what's yours\" kind of a way, like, \"go fight for Thomas. He belongs with you and your son\" kind of a way.",
        "Thomas: You always were a fighter.",
        "Caroline: I always win, too.",
        "Sally: [Clears throat] I can come back another time.",
        "Eric: Thanks for handling this with Quinn. I don't want to see her.",
        "Sheila: You don't have to. Not until you're ready. She didn't make it easy, though. She kept insisting. I had to fight off a confrontation with her. Now, come on, finish your water. Your medication says that you have to drink that with a full glass. [Laughs] What can I say, right? Once a nurse, always a nurse.",
        "Liam: And you're sure he's with Sheila?",
        "Quinn: She was here, Liam, rubbing it in my face when she was picking up his prescriptions.",
        "Liam: Well, it kind of sounds like he means to stay away.",
        "Quinn: Or -- or she means him to! You should see the way she looks him, so territorial. It's scary!",
        "Steffy: Everything about that woman is scary.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but she wouldn't... she wouldn't, like, physically hurt him, right?",
        "Quinn: I -- I don't know. I'm pretty sure she's armed.",
        "Steffy: What? She has a gun?",
        "Quinn: I -- I don't know that for sure, but I put my hand in her purse because I was trying to get his medications back, and I felt something, and I -- I can't be sure, but it felt like a gun.",
        "Steffy: Of course she has -- of course.",
        "Liam: Great. Yeah.",
        "Quinn: Look, I can't just stand around here wondering. I -- I have to do something.",
        "Liam: Well, go! We can stay here. You want to go, go. Get some air, or whatever.",
        "Quinn: I don't want air! I want my husband back.",
        "Steffy: Okay, Quinn, just go to Forrester. Maybe my father has talked to granddad.",
        "Quinn: He hasn't. Not since the last time...",
        "Steffy: Or maybe Pam! Someone must have heard from him!",
        "Quinn: You sure? You'll -- you'll stay here in case he shows up?",
        "Steffy: Of course. Of course.",
        "Liam: And, who knows? Maybe I can track him down in the meantime. Can I -- can I use your...",
        "Quinn: Yes! Use my computer! Yes, of course! I -- thank you both. You know I don't like asking for help, but...",
        "Steffy: No, no, it's -- it's fine. We want him home safe, and soon. Call us if hear anything, okay?",
        "Quinn: Okay. All right.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] What are you doing?",
        "Liam: Uh, I'm gonna track his phone.",
        "Steffy: Don't you need an app for that?",
        "Liam: No. Not necessarily. There are other ways to do it. You forget, I used to do this for a living.",
        "Steffy: Okay, just find him, Liam. Before Sheila takes him away for good.",
        "Steffy: Anything?",
        "Liam: No, not yet. Where did you run off to?",
        "Steffy: I remembered something of my grandmother's I thought we might need.",
        "Liam: Whoa! What the hell?",
        "Steffy: I'm not planning on using it, but we can't take chances, Liam. That woman is evil, and I think about all the things that she's done to my family. I'm not gonna let it happen again.",
        "Liam: I know that hurt, but your mom is okay.",
        "Steffy: I'm not. Thomas isn't, phoebe wasn't. We lost all this time with our mom, and that's on Sheila. I'm not gonna let her take away my grandfather.",
        "[Computer chimes]",
        "Liam: That's it! That's it! I got it.",
        "Steffy: What, what, what, what, what?",
        "Liam: Eric's location, or well, location of his phone.",
        "Steffy: Okay, come on. Let's go! Let's go, let's go!",
        "Liam: Okay. All right.",
        "Eric: Sheila, thank you. Thanks for getting my meds. I appreciate that.",
        "Steffy: Of course. I'd do anything for you.",
        "Eric: Sheila, you know that I'm not... you and I are not ever...",
        "Sheila: I know. I know.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Sheila: No ulterior motives, Eric. I just want to live differently than I did before. I want to do things that matter with kindness and help people that are in need, and you are in need.",
        "Eric: No, what I need -- I need time. I need some time to wrap my brain around what's happened here, what -- what ridge and Quinn -- what ridge and Quinn have done to me.",
        "Sheila: Those two are the two that are supposed to have loved you the most. I'm gonna do whatever it necessary to get you the time that you need right now. I'll keep them all away from you -- Quinn, the entire family. You don't have to see any of them ever again.",
        "Sally: I'm not scaring Caroline away, am I?",
        "Thomas: No. Not at all. She doesn't exactly get scared.",
        "Caroline: Okay, I guess we should be on our way.",
        "Sally: No! You should stay! Come on! Hey! Thomas, do you have any board games, maybe some cards? We could make a night out of it. I did hear you say something about winning. I would love to see you try and beat me at rummy.",
        "Caroline: I mean, I don't really spend any time playing games, what, with being a mom and all, responsibilities. Hey! Do you want to say goodbye to daddy!",
        "Thomas: [Gasps]",
        "Caroline: Yeah?",
        "Thomas: Bye! See ya.",
        "Douglas: I love you, daddy.",
        "Thomas: I love you, too.",
        "Sally: So, you got your flight booked?",
        "Caroline: My flight?",
        "Sally: Yeah, I figured you would be itching to get back to the big apple. An east coast girl like you probably hates how fake everyone is out here.",
        "Caroline: I'm in no rush. I mean, look how happy my son is with his dad. I don't want to take him away anytime soon. So I guess you'll be seeing a lot more of me.",
        "Thomas: Mom has some treats!",
        "Caroline: Oh!",
        "Thomas: Those are so tasty!",
        "Sheila: Here. Let me get that for you. There you go.",
        "Eric: Yeah, I'm okay. I'll all right. Thanks.",
        "Sheila: You've been through a lot. Would you just let me fuss over you a little bit? Can I get you some tea? Well, are you hungry? I saw a pizza place down the street.",
        "Eric: [Sighs]",
        "Sheila: I can just go back to my room if you'd like some time alone.",
        "Eric: Either way, Sheila.",
        "Sheila: Then I'll check on you later.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Steffy: Granddad, are you in there?",
        "Sheila: I'll get rid of her for you.",
        "[Knocking continues]",
        "Steffy: Hello? Open up!",
        "Sheila: Steffy, can I help you?",
        "Steffy: Oh, my god, you really are back.",
        "Sheila: Your grandfather's trying to take a nap right now.",
        "Steffy: Granddad!",
        "Sheila: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Steffy: Are you all right? Granddad!",
        "Sheila: He doesn't want to see you. He doesn't want a single thing to do with anyone in your family, so leave. Now! Now!",
        "Sally: So, good visit?",
        "Thomas: Yes. Absolutely. I love seeing Douglas. He's so cute. And I'm really glad that you got to meet him, as well.",
        "Sally: Yeah. Yeah. Me, too. He's adorable, but I mean, why wouldn't he be? His father's handsome, his mother is gorgeous.",
        "Thomas: You think Caroline's gorgeous?",
        "Sally: In a privileged girl-who-has-it-all kind of way, yeah. I mean, some people are into that.",
        "Thomas: That was really hard for you, wasn't it, meeting her?",
        "Sally: I've had better days. Like when I tripped off the pier. Oh! Uh, or when I got arrested.",
        "Thomas: Right.",
        "Sally: Okay, she wasn't terrible.",
        "Thomas: Give her a chance. Okay? You're going to be seeing a lot more of her.",
        "Sally: Funny, she said the same thing.",
        "Thomas: She is the mother of my child. She is going to be in my life.",
        "Sally: I get that.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: I do, I just -- \"mother of your child\" is not the only thing that Caroline is after. She wants more.",
        "Thomas: Despite her girl-who-has-it-all attitude, she doesn't always get what she wants. I said, yeah, that she will be in my life. But you should expect to see a lot more of her because, like it or not, you are stuck with me.",
        "Steffy: I'm not the one leaving, you are!",
        "Sheila: No, you know what? We're all leaving because Eric wants...",
        "Steffy: Granddad, what's going on? Can you just tell me what's going on?",
        "Sheila: He wants to stay away from you, your entire family!",
        "Steffy: He can speak for himself! Granddad, please tell me what's going on.",
        "Eric: Steffy, it's personal.",
        "Steffy: It's personal? So you can't tell me, but you can tell Sheila? You can stay in a hotel room with her?",
        "Eric: That's not what's going on here.",
        "Sheila: Oh, my god, my room is down the hall. It's pure coincidence...",
        "Steffy: Oh, like hell it is.",
        "Sheila: It's true! I ran into Eric in the hallway.",
        "Steffy: Granddad, can you just tell me what's going? Please -- can you please tell me what's going on?",
        "Eric: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Eric, hey. Hey. Is it Quinn? Did something happen between you two?",
        "Eric: It's not for me to tell.",
        "Steffy: It must be bad if you're staying here.",
        "Eric: Ask your father.",
        "Steffy: My father? Why?",
        "Sheila: You're upsetting him. You need to leave.",
        "Steffy: I'm not leaving until I get answers.",
        "Sheila: You just need to leave. He doesn't want to see you!",
        "Steffy: Why are you doing this? Why are you hovering over him like a bodyguard?",
        "Sheila: I'm not! I'm helping him! I'm taking care of him, making sure he's all right.",
        "Steffy: Well, your job is done. It's my turn now.",
        "Sheila: You know what --",
        "Liam: Let go, let go, let go!",
        "Steffy: Step aside.",
        "Sheila: No!",
        "Steffy: Now!",
        "Sheila: No!",
        "Steffy: You have no right to tell me when I can visit my grandfather.",
        "Sheila: True! Only Eric can say that, and he made it perfectly clear to me he didn't want his family here!",
        "Steffy: Granddad, we could help you get through this.",
        "Sheila: No, I'm helping him! I'm helping him! Just leave!",
        "Steffy: What are doing, exactly?",
        "Sheila: You want to know what I'm doing?",
        "Steffy: Yes!",
        "Sheila: How I'm helping...",
        "Liam: Whoa, whoa, whoa! She's got a gun!",
        "Eric: Oh! Sheila!",
        "[Glass shatters]",
        "Eric: Oh, god! Oh! Here! Oh, Sheila!"
