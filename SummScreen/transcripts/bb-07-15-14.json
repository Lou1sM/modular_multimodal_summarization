        "Carter heard it from Rick but he confronts Maya and asks if she came on to Rick in the steam room. She admits that yes she did. He doesn't want to hear that it didn't mean anything. She says nothing happened. Carter says only because he is happily married to Caroline. So Oliver's plan worked and he's in. He doesn't deserve all of this and she did. Carter sees that she is jealous, pea green. And that she settled for him. Carter tells her the wedding is off. She says they can work through this. He says Rick turned her down, now he is too. Oliver tries to explain to Aly of why he was talking and Maya was recording without his knowledge. That was stupid but everything he ever told Aly was real. She tells him never to call her Miss F again. She told him things about herself and her family and he was just playing games with her. He tells her again that being with her makes him happier than with anyone else. He tells her to trust him. She tells him to stop. He says he doesn't want to. He wants them to put this behind them and move on. Wyatt wants to be sure that Hope wants him back at work and that she doesn't feel like she owes him. She admits both. It is just a job and he would be perfect for it, but at same time they do owe him for him saving Liam's life. Liam says they spent so much time not trusting each other so imagine how much easier it is going to be all working for the same cause. Wyatt says Liam is putting a lot of faith in him. Liam answers that is what brothers do. Wyatt says he can not believe this miracle. Seems like only yesterday that he was cleaning out his office and now he is coming back. And his good luck all started with the diamond but what she is giving him is even more priceless than that. He said he would give it to her someday but she deserves better than that.",
        "Aly wants to believe Oliver but she can not tell if what he is aying now is true. He as her first love; her first kiss but there won't be any more. They can be friends but nothing more. She can not trust him. He declares she can. He is sorry that she is upset but give him another chance and he can prove that it is real. Aly says that he has to be her knight in shining armor or she can't be his Miss F anymore. Liam tells Wyatt that times change and now he is putting his trust in Wyatt to be around Hope and that he is not going to be hitting on Hope and trying to come between them. Getting along will take some getting used to but it feels right. Just don't let him down. They hug."

        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: This is, uh -- this is --",
        "Hope: This is not a gift. It's a job, okay? And I think it's one that you're perfect for.",
        "Wyatt: I just don't want you to feel like you owe me.",
        "Hope: But I do. I owe you a lot. [Chuckles]",

        "Carter: Be straight with me.",
        "Maya: Carter, I --",
        "Carter: Yes or no? All I want is the truth.",
        "Maya: Rick told you?",
        "Carter: Yeah, I heard his side of it. I want to hear yours. Did you come on to him in the steam room?",
        "Maya: Yes. I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: This is gonna sound bad.",
        "Aly: Worse than the things I said about Taylor?",
        "Oliver: You said those things 'cause you were upset. What I said to Maya, it wasn't like that.",
        "Aly: You can tell me.",
        "Oliver: I didn't know she was recording me, and she was asking me all these really pointed questions.",
        "Aly: So, she made you say something you didn't mean?",
        "Oliver: I wasn't thinking about what it might sound like to someone else. But you know me. You know, that day at the pool, what you said about my eyes -- that you can definitely trust me.",
        "Aly: Oliver, what did you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Don't tell me it didn't mean anything.",
        "Maya: What did Rick say?",
        "Carter: I'm asking you.",
        "Maya: Sounds like more of an accusation to me.",
        "Carter: You didn't deny it.",
        "Maya: Because nothing happened.",
        "Carter: So you -- so you -- you didn't hit on Rick?",
        "Maya: It didn't go anywhere.",
        "Carter: Because he's happily married to Caroline. Maya, what is this? What's going on with you?",
        "Maya: I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Carter: I want you to explain to me why my fianc\u00e9e was hitting on another man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: It was wrong. I shouldn't have said it, but you have to understand what was going on at the time.",
        "Aly: Were you and Maya arguing?",
        "Carter: Ridge had fired me, and I had just gotten my job back, but things were very uncertain for me.",
        "Aly: I remember.",
        "Oliver: Of course, you do. You were my biggest supporter. You were so great, which makes me feel even worse about this.",
        "Aly: So, you said something about me.",
        "Oliver: I was telling Maya how much I liked hanging out with you... and how cute you are... and how dating you might help my job security.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I'm not saying this out of guilt.",
        "Wyatt: I know. You need me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, to help Ivy with her line.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hope: I mean, you know more about the jewelry business than anyone I know.",
        "Wyatt: I grew up in it.",
        "Hope: So, do you -- do you think that maybe you'd be ready to try something else?",
        "Wyatt: Ah, I'm sure once you've seen one priceless diamond, you've seen them all.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: No. This is where I want to be. And the fact that you guys asked me like this... I know that you wouldn't have offered this if Liam didn't support it. So... you really do trust me.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Why? Can you think of a reason I shouldn't? [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] No. I'm just...",
        "Hope: How are you feeling?",
        "Wyatt: Wow. Crazy day.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Yeah, I know. I bet you were not expecting this when you woke up this morning.",
        "Wyatt: No. You have no idea. But it's like everything's suddenly falling into place.",
        "Liam: Yeah, it's funny how that happens when you stop making everything so difficult. I mean, we spent so much time fighting each other. Just imagine how much easier things are gonna get if we... rely on each other.",
        "Wyatt: Look, you're feeling kind of warm and fuzzy toward me right now, but saving your life doesn't make me a saint. I mean, I didn't come rushing over to your place 'cause I was overwhelmed with brotherly feelings.",
        "Liam: What, you think I don't know that? You were trying to keep your mom out of jail. Still...",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I just -- and I knew Hope wouldn't forgive me if anything happened to you.",
        "Liam: Well, there's that.",
        "Wyatt: Look, jealousy and envy made my mom do crazy things. You know, and I've done things, too.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, no.",
        "Wyatt: But we're not the same. We're not.",
        "Hope: I know that. So does Liam.",
        "Wyatt: You sure about this? I mean, you're putting a lot of faith in me.",
        "Liam: Well, I hear that's what brothers do. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You were pushing me to set a date. I had to be sure.",
        "Carter: Sure about what?",
        "Maya: I'm the one who broke it off with Rick. That's the reason he ended up with Caroline. I-I basically gave him to her.",
        "Carter: And now you want him back.",
        "Maya: I'm sorry. I had to know if there was a chance. Carter, you asked me to tell you the truth. I respect you enough to do that. Now please respect me enough to listen and try to understand. This isn't something I was planning. But I have been thinking about us... about Rick and Caroline, Oliver and Aly.",
        "Carter: What does Oliver have to do with this?",
        "Maya: Everything is coming together for him. Thorne knows about his relationship with Aly. He's given him his blessing.",
        "Carter: So?",
        "Maya: So Oliver's plan worked. He's in.",
        "Carter: And you're jealous. Maya, you think Oliver's a gold digger. You say you made that recording because you wanted to protect Aly from him.",
        "Maya: Because he's using her. And he doesn't deserve that life, to have all of these things. Their relationship isn't real! But what I had with Rick was. His family loved me. And I loved being a part of it. I mean, sure, it was hard to get used to at first -- the way they live, all of their money, so much they don't even think about it. They don't have to. There is nothing that they cannot afford. Can you even imagine that -- being so rich that nothing costs too much, never having to settle for anything less than the absolute best.",
        "Carter: Like you settled for me.",
        "Maya: I-I didn't say that.",
        "Carter: You didn't have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: So, that's what happened. I was shooting my mouth off, trying to sound cool.",
        "Aly: To impress Maya?",
        "Oliver: No. No, to cover up how scared I was. Almost losing my job really shook me up, and I know that's not an excuse, but you got to believe me, Miss F. Just -- just -- just know that I'm sorry.",
        "Aly: So... asking me to coffee and hanging out at the pool -- you were just protecting your job.",
        "Oliver: No. No, what I said to Maya was stupid. Everything I've said to you is real.",
        "Aly: You told me I was beautiful.",
        "Oliver: You are.",
        "Aly: I thought you liked me.",
        "Oliver: I do.",
        "Aly: I let you see my room. I let you kiss me.",
        "Oliver: And I want to kiss you right now. I want to hold you right now.",
        "Aly: Just --",
        "Oliver: I just need you to understand so that we can move on from this.",
        "Aly: I-I am such an idiot.",
        "Oliver: No, you're not. I am the idiot. I messed up. I am so lucky to be with someone like you.",
        "Aly: You just wanted to be with me because of my last name.",
        "Oliver: That -- that is not true. Just -- just listen to what I have to say, Miss F.",
        "Aly: Don't call me that. Don't you ever call me that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I am talking about the Forresters, their lifestyle.",
        "Carter: I'm not rich enough for you.",
        "Maya: Carter, you've seen the way they live, everything they have. You can't blame me for wondering.",
        "Carter: You weren't daydreaming. You cornered Rick in the steam room.",
        "Maya: I got the answers I needed.",
        "Carter: Yeah? Yeah, well, it cleared some things up for me, too.",
        "Maya: Ca-carter, Ridge and you are friends. You like spending time in his world. I was actually in it, a part of it. I was dating the heir to the Forrester throne. I was almost one of them.",
        "Carter: No. The Forresters have class and integrity.",
        "Maya: You're angry with me.",
        "Carter: I'm also relieved. You know, I'm glad I'm finding this out before the wedding. I didn't understand why you kept pushing it back, but thank God you did.",
        "Maya: Well, it's -- it's like I said -- we couldn't get married until I knew.",
        "Carter: [Scoffs] Maya, we're not getting married.",
        "Maya: What do you mean?",
        "Carter: The wedding's off.",
        "Maya: Carter...",
        "Carter: It's done, Maya. We are done.",
        "Maya: I made a mistake.",
        "Carter: A big one.",
        "Maya: Wait a minute.",
        "Carter: Maya, it's not happening.",
        "Maya: We can work through this.",
        "Carter: You're only saying that because Rick turned you down. Well, guess what. I'm turning you down, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Don't act like you don't know me. You do. Better than anyone.",
        "Aly: You were just pretending.",
        "Oliver: No, I wasn't.",
        "Aly: I told you things, private things about my family and my feelings. I let you see the real me.",
        "Oliver: I loved everything you showed me. I love everything about you. I think it's cool that you have a dollhouse in your room and that you have a little goldfish named Wally and that you're still able to talk to your mom.",
        "Aly: Yeah, you'll put up with it as long as you can keep your job.",
        "Oliver: None of those things are weird, not to me. They make you special.",
        "Aly: I've heard that before.",
        "Oliver: And I meant it. Being with you has made me happier than I've ever been in my entire life, 'cause being with you isn't like being with anyone else. You know, I never would have thought about dressing up and going to a medieval night, but that was a blast. I want to do more stuff like that together.",
        "Aly: Yeah? And how do I know you're not just playing me?",
        "Oliver: Aly, you just have to trust me. You got to know that I care about you. [Chuckles] I love that you just do what you want and you don't care what other people think. You've given me a whole new way to live my life.",
        "Aly: Just stop.",
        "Oliver: I don't want to stop. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I need you to forgive me so that we can put this behind us and just move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: So, all I have to do is say \"yes\" and things will go back to the way they were?",
        "Hope: Well, not exactly.",
        "Liam: I mean, you have to work out the details with Rick and Eric.",
        "Wyatt: But I'll be here, in the building, part of the team?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] Ah, it's just my luck. I mean, it just seems like I was here, packing up, and that I was wracking my brain trying to figure out how to get back. I thought it would take a miracle.",
        "Hope: Um, you showing up at Liam's when you did -- that was a miracle.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but this feels like one, too. You know? Another shot at my future. All I wanted, everything that I planned, and it all started with the diamond. Remember? I told you I was gonna give it to you.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: That's crazy. [Chuckles] Um, but you've given me something that's just even more priceless than that -- your understanding and your forgiveness, and thank you is not enough, Hope, and you deserve so much more. And I'm gonna make sure that you get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I really want to believe you.",
        "Oliver: Then believe me.",
        "Aly: I can't. I can't tell if what you're saying is true.",
        "Oliver: It's not an act, Aly.",
        "Aly: Maya thought it was. That's why she recorded you, right? I mean, why else would she do that? Did she feel sorry for me? \"Poor little Aly. She thinks she's really in love.\"",
        "Oliver: Don't say that.",
        "Aly: Well, I was in love, Oliver. You were my first love and my first kiss. And it was really nice. But there won't be any more kissing.",
        "Oliver: If you want me to prove myself, I will.",
        "Aly: You know, we can still be friends. But that's all.",
        "Oliver: No. No, no, no. We're not breaking up over this.",
        "Aly: I can't trust you.",
        "Oliver: Yes, you can.",
        "Aly: You helped me deal with my issues with Taylor. And I will always be grateful for that.",
        "Oliver: No, hold on. You're upset. What I said was terrible, and I am so sorry. But, Aly, so much has happened since then.",
        "Aly: I don't know if any of it was real.",
        "Oliver: Do you want me to show you that it was? Just give me another chance.",
        "Aly: Look, I've never done this before. You're my first boyfriend, [Chuckles] If you were even my boyfriend. I don't know, because I can't tell if you're lying, and I... I just can't be with someone like that. I thought you were my knight in shining armor... but you're not. And I'm not your Miss F anymore.",
        "Oliver: Aly! Aly!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You all right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. [Laughs] It's just been one hell of a day.",
        "Liam: This means a lot to you, huh?",
        "Wyatt: I can't tell you how much, man.",
        "Liam: Well, don't get all sappy on me. I mean, it was -- it was Hope's idea.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but you didn't have to support it. You could have said \"no.\"",
        "Liam: Two days ago, I probably would have, but times change, man. You saved my life, and now...I'm trusting you with the most precious part of it. This is a big deal for me, too, you know? Putting my faith in you around Hope, working with her...",
        "Wyatt: Look, Liam, if you have your doubts --",
        "Liam: No, I don't. Look, if I had doubts, we wouldn't be having this conversation. The thing is I do trust you. I-I do believe that you're not going to let me down, that you're not gonna be hitting on Hope, trying to come between us. 'Cause the thing is, you're not the competition anymore, Wyatt. You're my best man.",
        "Wyatt: I got the bow tie to prove it. I can't promise I'm gonna wear it.",
        "Liam: I knew you were gonna say that! You with the bow tie!",
        "Wyatt: Really?!",
        "Liam: What's the matter with the bow tie? It's a good-looking tie.",
        "Wyatt: Bow ties? Come on. That is not my style.",
        "Liam: Fine. [Laughs] Man, you and I -- we -- we've been at each other's throats for a long time.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: I think -- I think getting along is gonna take some getting used to, but, you know, this feels right to me. Just don't let me down.",
        "Wyatt: I won't.",
        "Liam: All right.",
