        "Try as he might, Ridge can't put a sketch to paper. Katie tells him to take his time; it will come back. All he can think of is the SP logo and a tiny part of a man's face piloting the chopper. Ridge tells Katie that he and his dad built this company and if he can't design then he is nothing. Justin hands Bill some contracts concerning FC and says something odd happened over there today. He ran into Ridge and he can't describe it, but he gave him a look. Bill says so he gave him a weird look. The dude is weird so that is par for the course. Justin says he said nothing but hey you and then he left. Bill scoffs and says Ridge had been groggy for weeks so this means nothing. Justin says as long as he does not remember he was piloting the chopper and dumped him for a drink. Oliver chases after Aly to catch up with her. She runs into an empty office and starts talking to her mother. She says Oliver is not who he appears to be. He was just using her to keep his job. He denies it so she doesn't know what to do. He was her knight in shining armor. But she can not just forget what he did. Darla says but she also can not forget her heart either. Pam finds Aly. Pam is all dressed for the Medieval Knights. Charlie comes in and temps Aly with getting some succulent chicken and some jousting that will make her feel better. Oliver runs into Carter in the hallway asking if he has seen Aly. Carter asks if he knows about the recording. Oliver says yes and it means nothing. Carter says for the record he is sorry Maya is messing with him too. Maya looks at some of Oliver's shootings when he comes back and asks if she has seen Aly. Maya says no but she is looking for her too. Oliver says its too late. He's already told Aly everything about the tape ..how it started, who started it, how he really feels, she knows it all. So that hammer that Maya has been holding over his head has just gone poof. Maya says so has his relationship with Aly. He says not yet. He is going to find her and make it right. Maya says Aly may be young but she is not foolish. She will never believe him again. Maya says she guesses they both lost their shot at a Forrester. Justin says they are not out of the woods yet so does Bill have a plan. Bill pours his drink and says they do not need a plan. They just need to be cautious. Justin answers there are only two possibilities \u0096 either Ridge gets his memory back or he doesn't .and the way he looked at him today he thinks he is getting it back. Bill tells him he is being unrealistic. Ridge isn't likely to remember every little detail and certainly not the SP logo. Justin says if it happened to Bill that he knows he'd be like a pit bull trying to find all the answers. So will Ridge ..his worst enemy. And if he starts to put the pieces of the puzzle together it will lead to Bill and to him and they need to do something about that. Bill says it was a surprise for Brooke so there never was a flight plan so therefore there was no helicopter therefore Justin could not have been in it. And the only ones who know about this is the two of them. And it's going to stay that way.",
        "Ridge tells Katie that it is a waste of time; he can't come up with anything. He bemoans chasing half way around the world like some comic book hero all for nothing. He should have buckled up. He remembers that is what he was doing helping Brooke buckle up when the helicopter banked. He grabs his phone and says he is going to get some answers. He calls Kyle and asks about the helicopter. Kyle explains that there was no helicopter to pick him up. That pilot never left the helipad. Ridge tells Katie he's getting closer. It wasn't his helicopter that picked him and Brooke up. Charlie is trying to whisk Aly and Pam out of the office when he runs into Oliver who wants Charlie to help him find Aly. Charlie bumbles and fumbles and says he and Pam are late and he can't. Pam tells Aly that she has to go with them as she needs this. And if she stays Oliver is sure to find her. But just as they get on the elevator Oliver sees them in costume and knows where they are going. Carter tells Maya that he hopes she did not ruin it for Aly and Oliver like she did for them. Charlie, Pam and Aly settle into their seats although Charlie has to keep telling a very down Aly to cheer up and get into it. Oliver pulls back the curtain and sees them. Ridge tells Katie what he was just told. There had to be another helicopter, and he keeps seeing the logo SP and wonders if Bill is somehow behind all of this."

        "Ridge: I had a gift -- have a gift. I don't know. I can't connect my thoughts and my hands again.",
        "Katie: You're recovering from a concussion. You're making progress.",

        "Aly: He led me on.",

        "Aly: He pretended like he liked me when all he wanted was to just keep his job.",
        "Pam: Oh, now, come on, Aly. Who -- who told you that?",
        "Aly: Oliver admitted it. But he said as he got to know me, everything changed -- that he really did like me.",
        "Pam: Well, okay, then. Do you believe him?",
        "Aly: I want to. I want to so badly, but how do I know he's just not stringing me along?",

        "Pam: Come on.",
        "Charlie: Ladies, let's storm the castle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I can never trust you again! Instead of confronting me directly, you make some surreptitious tape, bide your time, and then just play it for Rick and Caroline?!",
        "Maya: You and Aly were getting close.",
        "Oliver: That's exactly my point! I've gotten to know her -- how sweet and fresh, how special, she is. I'm crazy about her. I love her.",
        "Oliver: Have you seen Aly?",
        "Maya: You seem a little desperate.",
        "Oliver: Have you seen her or haven't you?",
        "Maya: No, I haven't. I am, like you, looking for her. Certain something I want to talk to her about.",
        "Oliver: Well, it's too late. I already told her.",
        "Maya: About what I recorded you saying?",
        "Oliver: Everything -- how it started, where I was coming from, and how I really feel. She knows it all, Maya. So, that hammer that you've been holding over my head -- poof! It just disappeared.",
        "Maya: Like your relationship with Aly, I take it, which is why you're so desperate to find her?",
        "Oliver: Oh, I'm gonna find her, and I'm gonna make this right.",
        "Maya: I doubt that. Aly's young, but she's not foolish. She will never believe you again. I guess we both lost our shot at a Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: All right. We need to play this smart, just in case.",
        "Justin: So, we're not out of the woods?",
        "Bill: Almost.",
        "Justin: You got a plan?",
        "Bill: We don't need a plan. We just need to be cautious.",
        "Justin: \"Dollar\" Bill, there are only two possibilities here. Either Ridge gets his memory back or he doesn't, and the way he looked at me today, I think he's getting it back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm getting nowhere.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Falling out of a helicopter -- how random is that?",
        "Katie: Well, I blame Quinn Fuller for all of this. She never should have showed you that picture of her and Bill doing whatever it was they were doing.",
        "Ridge: And off I went. How stupid of me.",
        "Katie: Do you regret it?",
        "Ridge: I don't -- I don't know. Um, I wanted your sister to know the truth, and I guess it didn't really make a difference. She's still with him. What a waste.",
        "Katie: It wasn't a waste.",
        "Ridge: Yes, it was a waste. I thought I pulled it off... like some comic-book superhero running across the beach, grabbing your sister, and pulling her into a helicopter I had waiting. I -- always buckle up. Should have buckled up.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, it was confusing and rushed. Brooke didn't even want to get in the helicopter.",
        "Ridge: No, she didn't. That's what I was doing. I was doing her seat belt. And all of a sudden, the helicopter banked.",
        "Katie: What are you doing?",
        "Ridge: I'm getting some answers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: All clear. Come on, come on, come on. No, wait, wait, wait.",
        "Oliver: Charlie, you got to help me. You got to help me.",
        "Charlie: Listen, what's up?",
        "Oliver: I need to find Aly. Maybe you could look downstairs. I'm gonna look through the offices.",
        "Charlie: Well, you know, we can't. We got -- I got stuff. Stuff, you know?",
        "Oliver: Stuff?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, stuff.",
        "Oliver: Dude, I'm desperate.",
        "Charlie: Uh, listen, uh, Pam -- we're so late. We got to -- sorry.",
        "Oliver: Really?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Sorry.",
        "Oliver: [Sighs]",
        "Charlie: Okay, let's go. Come on, come on, come on.",
        "Pam: You sure?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, come on, come on.",
        "Aly: You know what? Why don't you two just go ahead? I-- I'm uncomfortable with this.",
        "Pam: No. Aly, you are coming with.",
        "Aly: I'm really not in the mood.",
        "Pam: Well, get yourself in the mood. Come on, honey. You need this.",
        "Charlie: Come on, it'll get your mind off Ollie. Hmm!",
        "Pam: And besides, if you stay here, he's probably gonna find you.",
        "Charlie: That's right. I mean, that guy is a pit bull on a pant leg.",
        "Pam: Right.",
        "Charlie: Hmm?",
        "Aly: Right. Okay.",
        "Pam: Okay, come on. Ready?",
        "Charlie: Pammy, you take point. I got our backs.",
        "Pam: Okay. Shh. Stop. What?",
        "Charlie: Go, go, go.",
        "Pam: Okay. Okay, he's not here.",
        "[Elevator bell dings]",
        "Pam: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So Ridge gets his memory back. Eventually.",
        "Justin: He saw the Spencer Publications logo.",
        "Bill: You think he saw it.",
        "Justin: I know he saw it. He was lookin' right at it.",
        "Bill: And then he fell out of the helicopter, the most traumatic event of his life. You think he's gonna remember that little detail?",
        "Justin: He might, Bill, okay?",
        "Bill: You're not being realistic. The guy has been walkin' around in a fog, and when he comes out of it, if he comes out of it, the last thing he's gonna want to remember is fallin' out of that chopper. In fact, he's gonna want to forget it.",
        "Justin: Really? Would you? Would you blow it off, pretend it never happened? Hell, no. You would want to know why, how. You would be like a mad dog looking for answers. And believe me, Forrester's gonna do the same, if he hasn't already.",
        "Bill: Look, calm down, all right? He's got a job, a family, a relationship with Katie. This is not a priority.",
        "Justin: Really? Who's not being realistic? Who is your worst enemy, Bill? Huh? Who hates you more than anyone in the world?",
        "Bill: There's a lot of people who hate me. But, yeah, you know, he's at the top of the list.",
        "Justin: Yeah, and then he went all the way over there to keep his beloved Brooke from you.",
        "Bill: It didn't work, though, did it?",
        "Justin: No. And he also has a concussion. Don't tell me he's not in a cold sweat to get comeuppance. If he starts to put the pieces of the puzzle together, it leads to you, and it leads to me, and we have to do something about that.",
        "Bill: All right. We will.",
        "Justin: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Let's go get some air, all right - let's get something to eat.",
        "Ridge: I'm moving in on it, Katie, starting to remember things.",
        "Katie: What things?",
        "Ridge: Little things. More and more every day.",
        "Katie: Listen, you've been so consumed with this. I'm worried about you.",
        "Ridge: I don't want you to worry about me. Don't be worried.",
        "Katie: I've been doing some reading about post-traumatic stress disorder, and I--",
        "Ridge: I probably have that. That's why I've got to find out the truth.",
        "Katie: The truth about what?",
        "Ridge: About what happened to me.",
        "Katie: It was an accident.",
        "Ridge: If it was an accident, then I'll let it go.",
        "Katie: But you don't think that it was.",
        "Ridge: Oh, no, I don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Kyle: Mr. Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Hey, Kyle.",
        "Kyle: How are you, sir?",
        "Ridge: I'm, uh, feeling better, thank you.",
        "Kyle: Good to hear. Where are we going this time?",
        "Ridge: We're not going anywhere. I want to ask you a couple of questions. That helicopter we chartered in Abu Dhabi -- find out who the pilot was.",
        "Kyle: The helicopter?",
        "Ridge: The helicopter I fell out of.",
        "Kyle: Mr. Forrester, your helicopter never left.",
        "Ridge: What do you mean, never left?",
        "Kyle: Our pilot never picked you up.",
        "Ridge: Of course he did.",
        "Kyle: I'm afraid not, sir.",
        "Ridge: Kyle, the helicopter picked up Brooke and me. I'm not that far gone.",
        "Kyle: Not the one we chartered, sir. The pilot never left the helipad.",
        "Ridge: Then whose helicopter did I get into? I'll call you back.",
        "Katie: What? What is it?",
        "Ridge: The chopper - that's the answer. Who was flying it, and where did it come from?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: I can't find Aly anywhere.",
        "Maya: Me, neither.",
        "Carter: I hope she's with Oliver.",
        "Maya: I doubt that.",
        "Carter: And why's that?",
        "Maya: I didn't tell her, Carter. Oliver did.",
        "Carter: And now he's being penalized for coming clean. I hope you didn't ruin it for him like you did for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Look! There's Irene and betty. Hi, Irene, bet.",
        "Charlie: There's excitement in the castle -- the feast before us. And what is that manly aroma? I love the smell of testosterone in the morning. It smells like...victory.",
        "Pam: It smells like manure, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: A little bit.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Aly: Last time we were here, Oliver was with us.",
        "Pam: Yeah, and how you're with us, just like the first time.",
        "Aly: I'm not sure I can do this.",
        "Charlie: Oh, come on, Aly! Relax! Get into it!",
        "Pam: Come on. I am so excited!",
        "Charlie: Yeah!",
        "Pam: [Chuckles] [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: The helicopter? Who filed the flight plan?",
        "Justin: I did.",
        "Bill: With who?",
        "Justin: Communications.",
        "Bill: Then delete the flight plan. The helicopter never took off.",
        "Justin: [Sighs] Wait. Wait. Wait a second. Okay. So, what about Brooke?",
        "Bill: What about her?",
        "Justin: Didn't you tell her you were gonna pick her up with the helicopter after the wedding?",
        "Bill: No. It was a surprise.",
        "Justin: Okay. That covers us on that end. But what about me?",
        "Bill: What about you?",
        "Justin: Are you kidding me?! I was flying the damn thing!",
        "Bill: No, Justin, you weren't! There was no flight plan. Therefore, there was no helicopter, and, therefore, you couldn't be in it. Now, the only ones who know about this are you and me, and that's how it's going to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So, according to Kyle, it never took off.",
        "Katie: So, the helicopter that you and Brooke got into was not the one that you chartered?",
        "Ridge: No. And who was flying it, and where did it come from? Why do I keep seeing \"sp,\" the Spencer logo?",
        "Katie: What about it?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. I keep flashing back to it -- and to Justin.",
        "Katie: You think they're connected?",
        "Ridge: I don't know, but, obviously, I got into the wrong helicopter.",
        "Katie: Well, it obviously was there for somebody else.",
        "Ridge: Well, then, why did it pick up Brooke and me? This is all part of it, a part of all of --",
        "Katie: Part of what?",
        "Ridge: Part of someone's plan.",
        "Katie: Whose plan?",
        "Ridge: Do you think Spencer could have done this to me?",
