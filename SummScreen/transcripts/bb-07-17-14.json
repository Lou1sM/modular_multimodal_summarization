        "Ridge tells Katie that he doesn't want to take a break. He keeps seeing things like Justin's face and the SP logo; he knows Bill and Justin have something to do with his accident. There was a second helicopter and somehow Bill did this to him. And he can not let him get away with that. Katie says Bill has done some terrible things but this she can not believe as it would be attempted murder. He wants to go confront him now and she wants to be sure and sleep on it. He says he is going with or without her. Bill and Brooke cuddle and he says he'd do it all over again if he had to just to be with her. He goes on and on about an impromptu wedding and she won't even have to leave the couch. She's flattered but says he has nothing to worry about. She has no doubts and is not going to change her mind and has never been more sure about him. Aly is in a sullen mood at Medieval Nights and even Pam can't bring her out of her funk. Oliver goes backstage and ends up in the knight's dressing room. He hears that one of the knights, Travis, is late and they will have to go on without him. Oliver is able to slip into the clothes and onto his steed and enters the ring where the jousting is going on. As the Yellow Knight he heads straight to the front row where Pam, Charlie and Ally are sitting. Even GhostDarla has shown up for the event and tells Aly just to enjoy herself and all will be fine. Oliver comes forward and takes off his helmet and Aly sees who it is as he throws her a carnation and she catches it. She perks up but suddenly is replaced by a frown on her face as the real Yellow Knight tries to pull Oliver off the horse. Oliver finds himself in the middle of a joust yet has little besides his sword to defend himself and finds himself quickly on the ground with a sword at his throat. Aly flies out of the stands and into the ring and begs the King to spare this knight \u0096 out of love. This is not an actor but her boyfriend. The King declares that the Yellow Knight be saved. Oliver takes a bow to a rousing applause by the entire audience as Aly beams at him. Katie and Ridge come right into Brooke's home and says Ridge needed to see them. Bill says it is a good time as they were just discussing the wedding plans. Ridge wastes no time. He says he has been struggling with some ideas and there is one thing he knows for sure what Bill did. Justin was flying that helicopter and it was no accident. Bill made that happen."

        "Ridge: I don't want to take a break. I'm getting close. I keep seeing things. Justin's face, why do I keep seeing that?",
        "Katie: I don't know.",

        "Bill: We deserve it.",
        "Brooke: When I think of everything we went through to get here...",
        "Bill: It was worth it. I've got my boy, I've got my company... I've got you. I'd do it all again if I had to.",

        "Bill: I'm thinking Vegas.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Not again.",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah. We're gonna roll up on an [As Elvis] Elvis chapel. We're gonna be there about midnight, out of there about 12:05. What do you think?",
        "Brooke: Uh...",
        "Bill: [Normal voice] Huh?",
        "Brooke: I'm just so cozy here. Nice, quiet little evening. I don't think I could get up off this couch.",
        "Bill: You don't have to get up. We're gonna go to a drive-through. I'll pick you up, put you over my shoulder, put you in the car. We say our \"I do's,\" bam! You're my wife. You like it?",
        "Brooke: Wow. That is so romantic.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] I can't believe Forrester let you get away. That's never going to happen with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Bill. How is Bill responsible for your accident?",
        "Ridge: Well, we should go see what he has to say for himself.",
        "Katie: Let's just take a moment and think this through.",
        "Ridge: I am thinking. You're right here. You heard me talk to Kyle. And Kyle said that my helicopter never left. So whose chopper was I on?",
        "Katie: I don't know. It must have been some kind of mix-up.",
        "Ridge: And -- and what? It just came out of nowhere? Where'd it come from? Who was flying it?",
        "Katie: Well, Bill wasn't flying it. He was on the ground.",
        "Ridge: And where was Justin?",
        "Katie: I don't know.",

        "Brooke: Oh, that has a nice ring to it.",
        "Bill: All right, done. Bouquet's right there. Champagne in the fridge. I'll change my jeans. You look beautiful just the way you are -- a magnificent bride. I'll call Liam, he'll hobble over here with Hope. They'll be our witnesses -- done. We get in bed tonight as a married couple. What do you think? I like it.",
        "Brooke: It is very tempting.",
        "Bill: I'm just giving you options, right? You said you didn't want to get off the couch.",
        "Brooke: You're just in such a hurry. I mean, I'm flattered that you want to marry me so badly. But if I didn't know any better, I would think that you were worried that I might be changing my mind about you. But that would be impossible. I've never been more sure about anything than I am about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Bill didn't even know that you were going to be in Abu Dhabi.",
        "Ridge: Well, maybe somebody told him I was coming.",
        "Katie: Who would have told him?",
        "Ridge: Katie, I... Quinn gave him the heads up. I-I'm not sure.",
        "Katie: Okay. Why would she do that? She wanted you to stop the wedding. I'm just saying that we should think about this. I mean, Bill didn't know you were gonna be there. The accident happened moments after you arrived. I mean, did he really have time to get a helicopter in the air?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. I-I know it sounds implausible, but I know he did it.",
        "Katie: And I'm not doubting you. I just think that you've been through a lot and you're under a lot of stress, and you're trying to remember, but I don't think that you should force it. I think you should be sure.",
        "Ridge: I am sure. These flashes, the -- the -- the -- the logo and Justin's face, the Spencer logo. It's -- it's a real thing. Those are real memories. Those are things that I've seen. And every time it happens, it gets clearer and clearer. And I know Bill was involved in it, and I can't let him get away with it.",

        "Oliver: Aly... I love everything about this night.",
        "(Present time)",
        "Charlie: I love this bit. The clash of sword and shield, impending death or dismemberment. Run him through!",
        "Pam: Yeah! Look at the size of that guy's sword.",
        "Charlie: Yea-- Aunt Pam...",
        "Aly: Mom?",

        "Bill: Yeah. Too bad that had to happen.",
        "Brooke: But I know you and I are gonna get married sooner than later. I'm not worried about that. I'm just happy that Ridge is okay. And he's back here with Katie, and they're moving on with their life together. He's not 100% yet, but I'm sure he will be very soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: It's finally all making sense. Why'd it take me so long to figure out that Bill was behind this?",
        "Katie: Maybe it was just a freak accident.",
        "Ridge: It was not a freak accident. Justin was flying that plane, and Bill gave the order.",
        "Katie: It was a helicopter, not a plane.",
        "Ridge: I know what it was. It just -- it -- it -- he was the mastermind.",
        "Katie: Listen, I'm not gonna deny that Bill has done some horrible things -- he has. But...we're talking about attempted murder, here.",
        "Ridge: I punched him in the mouth. I humiliated him in front of his bride, and I dragged her away. You don't think he'd want revenge for that? I'm gonna confront the guy. If I look at him, I'll know if he's lying.",
        "Katie: I just -- I want us to be careful.",
        "Ridge: Okay. I'm going over to Brooke's.",
        "Katie: No, it's late. Let's just wait. We'll go in the morning. Let's sleep on this.",
        "Ridge: You can sleep on it, or you can come with me.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] All right, let's go.",

        "Pam: Charlie, he's gonna have to do the jousting.",
        "Oliver: Oh! No, no!",
        "Announcer: [Inaudible]",
        "Oliver: [Grunts] No, no, no!",
        "[Crowd gasps]",
        "Pam: Ooh, no! Charlie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: All right, so, it doesn't have to be Vegas, but I want to marry you and I want to do it soon.",
        "Brooke: Okay, okay. Yes, we will. We will do it. We're gonna get married even if we have to run off somewhere and do it just the two of us.",
        "Bill: Sounds good to me.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Bill: People don't really get us anyway. But you get me.",
        "Brooke: Yes. You're just misunderstood. You're not the greedy tyrant that they make you out to be in the newspapers. You are my gentle, sweet Bill. You are my protector, and I love that. And there's nothing I want more than to get married to you. It's gonna be wonderful. We're gonna have our families and our children and Ridge and Katie. We're all gonna get along.",
        "Bill: [Whistles] Wow, you are ambitious.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Well, you know, if there's one thing we learned from Ridge's accident, it's acceptance, understanding, getting along.",

        "Katie: Hey, um...",
        "Brooke: Hi.",
        "Katie: Sorry to just barge in.",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Bill: Uh, that's okay. Actually, uh, your timing's pretty good. We were just discussing wedding plans.",
        "Brooke: Yes. We want to make it official as soon as possible.",
        "Bill: And we're hoping that, uh, the two of you will find it in your hearts to be supportive.",
        "Ridge: Hey, Bill. I've been struggling, trying to remember, you know. After the accident, it's been a real long and complicated road, but, um... there's one thing I know for sure -- I know what you did. Justin was flying that helicopter. And me falling out of it, that was no accident. You made that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Pam: No, honey, don't!",
        "Aly: Wait! Halt, your majesty, I beg of you! Please! Please, I beg of you. Spare this knight's life.",
        "King: What pretense do you beg of this request, child?",
        "Aly: The noblest cause of all -- love. And, um...your majesty, he's not an actor. He's my boyfriend.",
