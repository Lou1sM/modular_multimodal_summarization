    "Recap": [
        "All is coming together backstage at the Fashion Shoot. Carter tells Rick that they are above capacity as no one declined the invitation. Rick says that is great but not his problem since he runs International now. Brooke joins and tells him how proud she is of him although she knows he would still like to be CEO. He says yes but that does not matter now. No one can take this day away from him and it will be greater especially after today. He tells Maya that she is beautiful and knows she is anxious because her parents are in the audience. She says yes she just wants to get out there and stand proud. This is the first time she has been before the public since she has been outed by the press and she just wants to get her power back. Julius and Vivienne walk around the presentation room and she seems impressed. Nicole introduces them to Zende and the other interns. Julius is surprised to learn that Zende is a Forrester. While Ridge and Caroline and Steffy and Liam seem very happy, Aly has a look of disgust on her face. Bill and Katie sip champagne and he even tells Jarrett to do his job and get him a good story tonight. Deacon surprises Quinn with a kiss. She is delighted until she sees him talking later with Brooke ever how innocently it is. Rick tells the DJ Othello that he wants things to be perfect. Vivienne feels underdressed but Julius says she looks fine. He comments that the gift bags out front must have cost half a million dollars. Ivy seems slightly miffed that Steffy and Liam are cuddled together talking intimately. Wyatt takes her away and says there is nothing important to see out there. Liam drags Steffy out to the Sky Lounge and tells her this is their future. They are going to be running Forrester Creations together. He thanks her for being so patient with him. He finally sees the obvious. He is right where he wants to be. They kiss passionately. Aly gives them the stink eye. Ridge thanks everyone backstage for their hard work and to Caroline his co-designer who has proven herself more and more times that she is more talented than he. Ivy thanks Liam and he wishes her well too. He says he knows now is not the time but they really should talk after the show.",
        "Ridge stands on stage and welcomes the audience. They are here to introduce California Freedom, about empowerment and acceptance. He calls out Steffy and Maya. Vivienne looks proud but Julius looks annoyed. He tells Vivienne this is so wrong, their son waltzing down the aisle dressed as a woman. Steffy announces they once had Hope For The Future but it is no longer needed. Maya adds that they are not looking for sameness or the same old thing. Steffy does not want guilt, society is full of free believers and California embodies that diversity and beauty. The models come out, two being transgender. The audience seems to like it but again Aly is sullen. In her head she listens to dark Darla who says this is not about freedom, but sex. This is pornography not romance. Aly has to put an end to this once and for all."

        "Steffy: Really?",
        "Liam: But it's also -- it's also standing right before me. This inevitable certainty, this force of nature that came barreling into my life yet again, strong and beautiful and determined. But you always fight for what you believe in -- the right to express yourself freely, Forrester, family... us. And I just want you to know you don't have to do that. You don't have to fight anymore.

It's -- it's almost showtime, and I would like to say thank you to all of you for putting so much of yourself, so much of your time, into this, because without that, we wouldn't be here. And to my...co-designer, proving once again that she is so much more talented than I will ever be.",
        "Caroline: Oh, thank you for admitting it.",
        "Ridge: You can disagree if you want. But, hey, uh, to my models -- all you guys, yes, we make the gowns, but... you make them wonderful. California freedom -- it's about equality for everyone. It's about celebrating what makes us unique and what makes us special, without judgment and without fear. Look at us, right? We're redefining Forrester -- move in to the future together. And that's pretty cool. So, let's go. Let's get started.",

        "Julius: I'm trying here. But it's wrong, Viv. Our son -- my firstborn, traipsing up and down a runway, wearing women's clothing -- how humiliating! [Sighs]",

        "Steffy: No. No. We live in a society filled with free people, free believers.",
        "Maya: Free to love one another, free to love ourselves.",
        "Steffy: From the ocean to the redwoods, California embodies diversity in its beauty and its people.",
        "Maya: So, let's make an impact. Let's get creative. Let's -- let's be kind.",
        "Steffy: Yes. Yes -- no condemnation, no shame, and no guilt.",
