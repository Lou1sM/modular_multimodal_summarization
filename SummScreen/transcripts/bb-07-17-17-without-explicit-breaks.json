    "Recap": [
        "Eric yells at Steffy for what she has done. Steffy says Sheila had a gun in her bag. Liam wants to call someone but needs to know what to say. He shows them the bullet hole in the door, the bullet could not have hurt Sheila. Then Sheila shows them her purse and they find the razor. It was not a gun but a razor in her purse. Eric says it is not Steffy's judgment if they call the police or not. He asks Sheila what she wants to do. Quinn questions Ridge if his dad has returned to work. He says no and there is no way of knowing if he is with Sheila or not. But if she shows up again just give her what she wants. The police knock on the door and all quickly hide Sheila and make up a quick story that nothing happened here. The police want to look around. The bathroom door is locked but one policeman sees the bullet hole in the door. Sheila comes out dressed in a robe and explains she was ready to take a shower, so the police apologize and leave.",
        "Steffy thanks Sheila for not reporting her. She tells Eric none of this makes sense. He should not be here shacking up with Sheila. She had to force her way in the door and then ended up shooting another human being because she thought Eric was in danger. He ought to be home. In a foul mood, Ridge dumps Quinn's designs on the desk and says they have a deadline and these are not good enough \u0096 back to the drawing board. She says she knows he is not feeling good right now but she is not the enemy. Sheila tells Steffy that she knows she has no credibility with her but Eric would not lie to her. This is where he chooses to stay. Steffy asks him to come home but Eric refuses again; this is where he chooses to stay. He appreciates her concern but this is the way he wants it. Sometimes it is just space one needs. Steffy says how do they know that Sheila is not holding him hostage. He says she is not and no one must know where he is staying. Steffy gives Eric one last hug before she goes. Eric apologizes to Sheila and says this never should have happened but he has come out the better for it. Eric tends to the graze on her arm and she says she is okay and can handle a little pain. She knows it was Quinn's idea who put the idea in Steffy's head that the razor was a gun. He says Quinn has a history of being a little erratic. Sheila retorts that she cannot judge as she has her own past history. She fantasized while she was in prison of being alone with him like this. But she does judge Ridge and Quinn and he deserves better than that. He quips good guys always finish last. She says he is not finished yet. Ridge tells Steffy that his Jedi tricks are still working. She is the one person he wanted to see and here she is. His dad is not here and is not at home either. Steffy informs him that Eric is with Sheila after a disagreement with Quinn. It must have been a bad one to take off with Sheila. She wants to know what is going on. She feels like it involves him .but with Quinn. She does not want to think they had an affair."

        "Eric: Steffy, what the hell? What have you done?",
        "Steffy: She has a gun in her bag.",
        "Eric: Sheila. Sheila. Sheila!",
        "Steffy: Liam, she has a gun. She has a gun.",
        "Liam: Listen, somebody's gonna call the police.",
        "Eric: Call 911!",
        "Liam: Look! Wait, wait.",
        "Sheila: No, I'm -- I'm okay.",
        "Eric: No, no, no. Don't try to get up.",
        "Sheila: No. I'm fine. I'm not hurt.",
        "Eric: Look, I'll call -- I'll call 911 myself.",
        "Liam: Look! Look, look! The bullet hole. See? See? It's right here. Steffy, you missed!",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Liam: Eric, don't make the call. I mean, somebody's probably already called it in anyway, so the question is -- what are we gonna say? I mean, she says she's fine, right?",
        "Sheila: I just -- I just want to go.",
        "Eric: Where? You're in shock.",
        "Steffy: Liam, get the gun. Liam, get her gun.",
        "Liam: The gun! Yes.",
        "Eric: You all right?",
        "Eric: [Sighs] That's my razor! It's from the house.",
        "Sheila: Eric asked me to pick up a few things for him. You asked how I was helping. I was gonna show you...",
        "Steffy: Quinn said you had a gun!",
        "Liam: I'll take that. Give me that.",
        "Eric: What the hell, Steffy? You come running in here -- you burst in here, you start shooting at people!",
        "Liam: It was Quinn! Quinn told us that she was armed.",
        "Eric: Quinn? Quinn? You of all people believe anything that Quinn says?",
        "Liam: Hey. Look.",
        "Steffy: You're not all right.",
        "Eric: Look, we -- we have to call 911!",
        "Liam: Eric. You sure you want to do that?",
        "Steffy: Liam, go in the bathroom, get something to disinfect it with, okay?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Eric: There some alcohol swabs in there.",
        "Steffy: And something to wrap it!",
        "Sheila: You know, it's just a flesh wound, you know? It doesn't even hurt. I hardly feel it.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] You're gonna feel it tonight.",
        "Eric: You don't get to judge how bad this is. And you don't get to judge whether to call the police or not.",
        "Steffy: Uh, my entire life, I was told that Sheila is dangerous!",
        "Eric: Sheila, what do you want to do? It's up to you.",
        "Quinn: Have you heard from him?",
        "Ridge: From my dad? No.",
        "Quinn: Neither has Steffy.",
        "Ridge: What did you say to Steffy?",
        "Quinn: What? I didn't say anything to her. I told her that Eric and I had a fight.",
        "Ridge: [Groans]",
        "Quinn: I would never say anything to her or to anyone about what happened between you and me.",
        "Ridge: I guess it doesn't matter. It's all gonna come out. My dad is not good at keeping secrets. The last one he kept, and not for very long, was you.",
        "Ridge: I've been sitting here calling dad's oldest friends, trying to ask without asking, and no one knows where he is.",
        "Quinn: Do you think she's gonna hurt him?",
        "Ridge: Sheila? She hurts anyone that says no to her.",
        "Quinn: I said worse than that.",
        "Quinn: Well, then you're one of the lucky ones. If she shows up again, just give her what she wants. Don't argue with her.",
        "Steffy: That should do it till we get you to a doctor.",
        "Liam: We can take my car, too.",
        "Eric: Well, that gun of Stephanie's stays here.",
        "Sheila: What are -- what are you gonna tell the doctor when he asks what happened? I'm a nurse, remember? This is not a critical injury. I'm gonna be fine.",
        "Steffy: Look, I never thought I'd be apologizing to the woman who shot my mom, but, um... I'm sorry.",
        "Sheila: You had every right to mistrust me. I only hope that one of these days...",
        "[Knocking on door] Hotel security!",
        "[Knocking continues]",
        "Eric: All right, give me -- give me the gun. I'll say it was me!",
        "Steffy: No! No! No!",
        "Sheila: Let me handle this. I can do this.",
        "[Knocking continues]",
        "Liam: Hey! Thank god you guys are here. We -- we, uh, heard a gunshot. We were gonna call the police. We thought it was a gunshot. Yeah, well, so did everyone else. From which direction?",
        "Steffy: Uh, we couldn't tell.",
        "Eric: It sounded close.",
        "Liam: We thought maybe we heard someone, like, running? We're doing a sweep of the building.",
        "Liam: Ah. Mind if we look in the bathroom? We're gonna need to clear this room. Who's in there?",
        "Liam: Um...",
        "Sheila: What's going -- my god, it was a gunshot. Sorry, ma'am. Are you all right?",
        "Sheila: I'm fine. I was just getting ready to take a shower when we heard it go off. You didn't find out who it was? We're going to. Let's check the emergency exits. Sorry to disturb you folks.",
        "Eric: Thank you. Thanks very much.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Sheila: It's lovely, but it's not quite my size.",
        "Steffy: You didn't have to do that. I was gonna explain.",
        "Sheila: Yeah, and we'd all be at the police department right now.",
        "Liam: This was a lot simpler.",
        "Eric: That's putting it mildly. Thank you. I mean it.",
        "Quinn: Should we call the police, file a missing persons report?",
        "Ridge: Call the police and make sure that everybody knows? Come on, this is not a conversation I want to have with my kids. I want to try to avoid it.",
        "Quinn: Conversation that we failed at having -- miserably! \"Just a few meaningless kisses?\" Are you kidding me? That was the best we could come up with?",
        "Ridge: Maybe.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Ridge: I don't -- I can't explain what I don't understand myself. What I see in you. What -- what you see in me.",
        "Quinn: It doesn't matter now.",
        "Ridge: No. Steffy knows that dad moved out, and before too long, she's gonna put it all together.",
        "Liam: I kind of think we should go.",
        "Steffy: Look, uh... I'm sorry I shot you, and thank you for covering me with security, but I really don't know any more than when I walked in this door.",
        "Eric: Sheila is not living here, all right?",
        "Steffy: Then why did she stop me from coming in?",
        "Sheila: Because your grandfather said he wanted to be left alone. He told you that.",
        "Steffy: What, alone with you?",
        "Eric: Look, Sheila brought me some things that I asked her to bring. That's all.",
        "Steffy: It just doesn't make any sense.",
        "Eric: We are not shacking up! How many times do I have to tell you this?",
        "Steffy: It doesn't make sense, granddad! Why aren't you home?",
        "Eric: Because I choose not to be.",
        "Steffy: Did you and Quinn have an argument?",
        "Eric: I didn't say that.",
        "Steffy: She did.",
        "Eric: Well, then, you have your answer, don't you?",
        "Steffy: Granddad, I shot another human being because I thought you were in trouble, and I still think you're in trouble. And you're acting like this is the most normal thing in the world. It's -- it's crazy! Someone better tell me what is going on.",
        "Ridge: So, about these pairings you came up with...",
        "Quinn: How can you even work at a time like this?",
        "Ridge: I don't like them -- any of them.",
        "Quinn: What do you suggest I do?",
        "Ridge: I suggest you do something better.",
        "Quinn: Fine, I'll work on it.",
        "Ridge: Good.",
        "Quinn: Your heart's not in it, is it?",
        "Ridge: In what?",
        "Quinn: In hurting me! I know what it feels like when you give it your all.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm sorry I'm not giving you my worst today.",
        "Quinn: And I'm sorry that this is not my best work.",
        "Ridge: Okay, but we -- we have a deadline to meet. Whatever this personal crisis is, we're gonna have to put it on hold for a minute.",
        "Quinn: Good luck with that!",
        "Ridge: What am I gonna do? What am I gonna say to Steffy when she comes in and she says, \"hey, I heard about you and granddad's wife,\" and I'm gonna say, \"well, it was a few meaningless kisses.\" Is that gonna be enough? 'Cause it hasn't worked so far.",
        "Quinn: I know you're freaked out, Ridge, but I am not your enemy.",
        "Ridge: Things were a lot easier when you were.",
        "Steffy: You expect me to believe you just happen to be staying down the hall?",
        "Sheila: Yes. Not because I said so. I know I have no credibility with you, but Eric does, and he wouldn't lie to you. He just didn't want to give you an answer, Steffy.",
        "Eric: How did it go?",
        "Liam: Uh, two cops in the lobby talking to the security guy, but honestly, they don't look that interested, so... saline, ointment, paper tape, gauze... you okay?",
        "Sheila: Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna be fine. I'm -- I'm just gonna change the dressing.",
        "Steffy: Granddad, I want you to come home.",
        "Eric: No.",
        "Steffy: When, then?",
        "Eric: I choose not to.",
        "Steffy: Look, I know that you are a father and that you are a husband and you have a world-famous face. Everybody knows you.",
        "Eric: Not here, they don't.",
        "Steffy: So you just want to be under the radar?",
        "Eric: Yeah. That's right.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Eric: For a while.",
        "Steffy: Then why don't you stay at the guest house with dad?",
        "Eric: I doubt very much he's still there.",
        "Steffy: Since when?",
        "Eric: Look, I appreciate your concern, but this is the way I want it, all right?",
        "Steffy: Did you and Quinn have an argument?",
        "Eric: That's private.",
        "Steffy: She's frantic about you.",
        "Eric: Not my problem.",
        "Steffy: Then why didn't you just kick her out? Why -- why aren't you staying at the house instead?",
        "Eric: You know, sometimes, it's not about who's right or who gets the spoils. Sometime it's just about needing some space between each other. I'm sure Liam understands about that.",
        "Liam: I take it she revealed her true colors somehow.",
        "Steffy: Sheila, I know you know what's going on, why granddad's staying here with you, all of people. Tell me. Answer me.",
        "Eric: Or what?",
        "Steffy: When I think about this situation, you say that you're not in trouble. This looks like trouble. How do I not know she's holding you hostage?",
        "Eric: You're just gonna have to trust me. And I'm gonna have to trust you. And you. Nobody can know where I'm staying.",
        "Steffy: Okay, except dad, yeah. Fine.",
        "Eric: No. Especially not your father.",
        "Steffy: Why? When -- when I asked you what was going on, you said ask my dad.",
        "Eric: Oh, you can ask him anything you want. But you may not tell him where I am.",
        "Steffy: Why?",
        "Eric: Because that's the way I want it.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] I need answers.",
        "Eric: Because you're more trustworthy than he is. Promise. Or you won't find me here again. You won't find me at all.",
        "Steffy: I -- all right.",
        "Liam: Yes, sir.",
        "Steffy: Okay, I, um... I'm, uh, gonna head out. I need some air. Come here.",
        "Sheila: She loves you.",
        "Eric: Yeah. Yeah, she does. If she knew anything about any of this, it would just -- [Sighs] Anyway, thank you.",
        "Sheila: You know, it just -- it wasn't my story to tell.",
        "Eric: Well, her next stop will be Ridge, of course. He'll have a story to tell. I'm sorry. This -- this never should have happened.",
        "Sheila: [Laughing] Well, a lot of people probably thought this should have happened a long time ago. I've been through a lot worse since you and I parted ways.",
        "Eric: And come out the better for it somehow.",
        "Sheila: I hope so. It's not for me to say.",
        "Sheila: [Inhales sharply]",
        "Eric: Wow. You're lucky it just grazed you. Does it sting?",
        "Sheila: Not when you do it.",
        "Eric: Oh, you've always been quite the flatterer, haven't you? Give me this. So, this tape over the gauze will be enough, right?",
        "Sheila: Yep. That'll protect it. You're good at this.",
        "Eric: Yeah. Well, I got a lot of practice.",
        "Sheila: You never could take a compliment.",
        "Eric: I never forget one, either.",
        "Sheila: Well, I can handle a little pain. You might remember that.",
        "Eric: Mm, I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Sheila: Are you gonna shave your beard?",
        "Eric: No, I don't think I am. I might trim it up a little, but that's all.",
        "Sheila: [Laughs] Good. Because you look so handsome and worldly with that.",
        "Eric: Thank you.",
        "Sheila: But you better shave something because that razor almost was the death of me.",
        "Eric: I feel pretty bad about that. I know Steffy does, too.",
        "Sheila: Well, I was making a joke. No, Quinn is the one who put the idea in Steffy's mind that I was carrying.",
        "Eric: I'm sure.",
        "Sheila: Well, I'm not sure it was all entirely her fault, though, because I didn't let her believe otherwise.",
        "Eric: Well, I hope there are no further confrontations between you two.",
        "Sheila: I understand that feelings don't go away overnight.",
        "Eric: Quinn has a history of being...erratic. Clearly, she hasn't gotten over that -- not yet.",
        "Sheila: Well, far be it from me to judge her on her past history. You know, when I was in prison, serving my time, I -- I fantasized about moments like this, just being alone with you. Of course, in my fantasies, I didn't have blood running down my arm. Although, in your fantasies, maybe I did.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] No.",
        "Sheila: It's good to see you smile. But I do judge her -- Quinn -- and Ridge for what they did behind your back. You deserve so much better than that.",
        "Eric: Nice guys finish last, eh?",
        "Sheila: What makes you think you're finished?",
        "Ridge: Perfect. My Jedi knight tricks are working.",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I think of the one person I would actually like to see today, and here she is.",
        "Steffy: How did I rise to that elevated status?",
        "Ridge: What are you doing?",
        "Steffy: What? Everybody does it.",
        "Ridge: You don't.",
        "Steffy: Well, I had a rough day. Fortunately, we didn't have to bury any bodies. You know granddad disappeared, right? I can see that you do.",
        "Ridge: Well, he's not here and he's not at home, so...",
        "Steffy: Mm. Why wouldn't we call the police, file a missing persons report? What if Quinn offed him?",
        "Ridge: You think she did?",
        "Steffy: Granddad left with Sheila.",
        "Ridge: Well, then he's not missing, he's just lost his mind.",
        "Steffy: Quinn's not blaming Sheila. Quinn and granddad had a disagreement.",
        "Ridge: That explains it, then.",
        "Steffy: A disagreement about what, though? It must have been pretty bad for granddad to take off with Sheila, don't you think?",
        "Ridge: If Quinn didn't want to explain it to you, there's probably -- I don't know...",
        "Steffy: It just seems like your intent is to match stories with Quinn.",
        "Ridge: I'm not telling you a story.",
        "Steffy: Okay, then, I think you should tell me what's going on. Are Quinn and Granddad breaking up? I know you know something, Dad. It's something about you, isn't it? Come on, just tell me. I don't want to think the unthinkable -- what, you and Quinn?",
        "Ridge: It's -- it's not...",
        "Steffy: No, I know you and Quinn didn't have an affair. Right, Dad?"
