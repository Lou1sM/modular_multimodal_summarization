    "Recap": [
        "Steffy tells Ridge to tell her that she is crazy .it couldn't be him and Quinn. He says he will not lie to her. It was not an affair, just a few kisses. She is outraged. A few kisses with his father's wife is enough. Ridge says it is over. She says still he betrayed his dad and she does not know how he did that. Caroline drops in on her Uncle Bill. He says he is never too busy for her or her son. He says he knows his last name is Forrester but he has Spencer blood and that is what counts. Bill says he knows Douglas is not the only one missing Thomas. He knows she is still in love with the guy. Caroline admits she blew it. Thomas came to New York and she had a chance to get her family back together but she stayed with her moms. Now she thinks she made a mistake and Thomas is now with Sally and they seem serious. Thomas and Sally confer on the fashion show in Monte Carlo. She says she knows they can go toe to toe in a fair fight but with Bill Spencer on the other side, she is not so sure. He says nothing gets more attention that competition with Forrester Creations. Now they will see a whole new Sally Spectra as he will be right there all the way. Quinn walks into her home and is scared to death by Liam walking around. She asks if he knows where Sheila is. She knows Sheila will be with Eric and if he knows something he has to tell her.",
        "Bill laments to Caroline that if she needs his help then she has it. Caroline says she does not want her only involvement to be over a computer screen. She and Douglas need Thomas in their lives daily. But it will not be easy as there is Sally. Bill says Sally does not stand a freaking chance when it comes to her. Sally reminds Thomas that Douglas will always be his son so Caroline will always be there in his life. He says yes he knows, she is an awesome mom and woman but not the woman that he wants now. Quinn begs Liam to tell her anything, she has to find her husband. She knows Liam thinks she caused so many pain and does not deserve Eric but she cannot just stand there and do nothing. She has to do something. Steffy is in distress and says it has been this way all her life with Ridge screwing up. He says he has no more excuses for being stupid with so much on the line. He lost Brooke. And now he has lost his father. He hurts the people they love the most. Bill saunters into Spectra. Thomas states he will have to wait for an exclusive like everyone else. Bill says no he is just checking out his building to which Thomas says it is not his yet. Bill retorts that he is small time and he cannot think otherwise. Thomas says he is not going to let Sally down. Bill says that is what he does, sketching and disappointing. He is trying to show the world how big he is instead of being a good dad. Now it must be in the genes but this little walk with Sally will not cut it. He has responsibility and it is about time he shucks Sally and put it where it belongs, in the garbage. Steffy tells Ridge she does not understand. She thought he hated Quinn as much as she does. He says it started that way but he misjudged her. She loves Eric and does not want to lose him. Steffy says she does not blame Eric for taking off. It's the way Ridge treated her mother her whole life. He is a great dad and designer but his love life sucks. She laments she fought against that relationship between Eric and Quinn but she never thought Ridge would be the cause of Eric's pain."

        "Steffy: Tell me I'm wrong, Dad. You and Quinn? You would never do that. No, tell me I'm crazy! Dad...",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Oh, Eric... please be home.",
        "[Keys jingling]",
        "[Door unlocks]",
        "Bill: Do we love this one? Look at this one? You like this ride?",
        "Douglas: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Yeah!",
        "Caroline: I wasn't sure if we should just, like, drop in...",
        "Bill: You can drop in. I can't get enough of my niece and this good-looking boy right here when you're in town!",
        "Caroline: Are you sure you're not too busy?",
        "Bill: I'm never too busy. You know that your uncle bill's the ultimate multitasker. I always have time. I can do everything. Unlike, uh, you know, your Spectra-loving father who has no work ethic. All right, listen, I got to talk to you about something. This is very important. Now, I know your last name is Forrester, but you have Spencer blood. Spencer blood! So that means you're always gonna be a Spencer man.",
        "Caroline: [Giggles]",
        "Bill: Right? You feel me on that? Let's high-five it.",
        "Bill: Hoo! Low five.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] I would love to see Forrester try and compete with this.",
        "Sally: They're gonna do more than try.",
        "Thomas: Well, they better, or they won't stand a chance in Monte Carlo.",
        "Sally: Mm. That's my confident, sexy man.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: I just have to wonder, are we sure about this?",
        "Thomas: About what?",
        "Sally: About doing a fashion duel with Forrester at Spencer summit?",
        "Thomas: You don't think we're up to the challenge?",
        "Sally: No, we are. Spectra can go toe-to-toe with anybody in a fair fight. But bill Spencer sabotaged Spectra before. And now we're gonna show our swimwear line at Spencer summit? It's like going into enemy territory.",
        "Bill: Can you say \"uncle bill has a bad ride?\"",
        "Douglas: Uncle bill has a bad ride.",
        "Bill: Oh! That was perfect. You are a smart kid. So, something tells me, uh, I'm not the only reason you came to L.A.",
        "Caroline: Well, Douglas missed his daddy, so...",
        "Bill: Hmm.",
        "Alison: Well, we missed you, too. May I?",
        "Caroline: Oh, yeah!",
        "Bill: You want to get some ice cream?",
        "Douglas: Yeah.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Alison: I bet you love ice cream!",
        "Caroline: He does.",
        "Alison: Our cafeteria has six flavors. Let's see which one you like best, huh?",
        "Caroline: [Gasps] Have fun, baby.",
        "Bill: Take care of my motorcycle!",
        "Caroline: Bye-bye, baby. [Giggles]",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] So... Douglas isn't the only one missing Thomas, is he? You're still hung up on the guy.",
        "[Door unlocks]",
        "Quinn: Eric? [Screams]",
        "Liam: Wait, wait, wait, wait! It's not -- it's not mine. I'm -- I'm putting it back for Steffy.",
        "Quinn: [Panting]",
        "Steffy: What the hell is going on with this family?",
        "Ridge: Everything's gonna be fine.",
        "Steffy: No, Thomas is working at Spectra. Granddad takes off, Quinn is losing it...",
        "Ridge: Because she hasn't heard from him.",
        "Steffy: And I gather he's not speaking to you, either, and I want to know why. Just be honest with me, dad! A simple \"yes\" or \"no\" will do. Did granddad leave Quinn because of you?",
        "Ridge: That's not a simple question.",
        "Steffy: Well, it should be! Are you the reason granddad left? Did something happen between you and Quinn?",
        "Ridge: Yes.",
        "Steffy: Yes?",
        "Ridge: I shouldn't have lied to your grandfather. I'm not gonna lie to you.",
        "Sally: I am a Spectra. I'm not afraid of a little trouble.",
        "Thomas: I know. That is why I'm here, to keep you out of it.",
        "Sally: By crashing the Spencer summit?",
        "Thomas: Nothing gets more attention than a competition with Forrester creations. Babe, I know this seems like a risk. But that is why I came to Spectra. I don't want to play it safe. Not in our work or in our lives.",
        "Sally: Neither do I.",
        "Thomas: And they are going to see a whole new Sally Spectra. Because I will be right there with you.",
        "Caroline: Douglas needs his father.",
        "Bill: That he does. But I'm not talking about Douglas. I'm asking about you, and I'm gonna keep asking until I get a straight answer!",
        "Caroline: What -- what do you want me to say? I feel like an idiot, okay? I had a chance to put my son's family back together, and I blew it. Thomas came to new York, and he was ready to start our lives together, but I wasn't ready. And now that I am, it might be too late.",
        "Bill: Why? 'Cause he's seeing that loony tune ginger?",
        "Caroline: They seem pretty serious, uncle bill.",
        "Bill: Sally Spectra is a punch line.",
        "Caroline: Well, Thomas obviously cares about her because he saved her company.",
        "Bill: That's a flashy distraction. Just like this -- this idiotic fashion showdown. Thomas can't think for himself. You have to think for him.",
        "Caroline: Well, what if his mind is already made up?",
        "Bill: What mind? He's a Forrester! He could hardly make up a bed, let alone make up his mind. That's up to you! Now, I have one very good reason for wanting Sally Spectra out of the picture. Now that you want her gone, I have one more.",
        "Caroline: Are you offering to help me, uncle bill?",
        "Liam: Hey, listen, you're the one who told Steffy Sheila might have a gun.",
        "Quinn: So Steffy got a gun of her own?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, that was a mistake, which we now know.",
        "Quinn: Did you find Sheila? Do you know where she is? Come on, Liam, I know that she's with Eric. She went to get his medication! Has -- has Steffy spoken to her grandfather? I just want to know if he's okay. Liam, if you know something, you have to tell me!",
        "Steffy: You had an affair with Quinn?",
        "Ridge: No. It didn't go that far.",
        "Steffy: Granddad left her.",
        "Ridge: We tried to explain it to him, and he wouldn't listen, and of course he didn't listen, but it was reckless and stupid. It was just a few kisses.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] A few kisses? A few kisses with your father's wife! I thought you despised this woman! How long has this been going on?",
        "Ridge: It's not going on. It's over, but we -- we kept that secret for so long, it only made it worse.",
        "Steffy: I can't believe this. I can't believe this! Granddad loves you both so much, and you betrayed him. How could you do that?",
        "Bill: You want my help? You've got it.",
        "Caroline: You don't even like Thomas.",
        "Bill: Well, I'd like him a lot more if he wasn't playing champion and savior to Spectra fashions. He's got to put his focus back on his family, where it belongs.",
        "Caroline: I mean, I'd like that. My child's only interaction with his father shouldn't be over a computer screen. I want Thomas in our lives. As a father, as a partner, in our home.",
        "Bill: Then you can't let Sally stand in the way of that.",
        "Caroline: Like how she's standing in the way of your skyscraper?",
        "Bill: She's gotten lucky so far.",
        "Caroline: Well, it's got to be a lot more than luck because Thomas left Forrester for her.",
        "Bill: That's because a man's not gonna stick around if he's just spinning his wheels! He's got to know that he's going somewhere.",
        "Caroline: I mean, that's why it didn't work out for us in new York.",
        "Bill: Well, now you're gonna right that wrong.",
        "Caroline: I just wish I would have realized it sooner. You know? But I told myself that I needed to wait and be sure, but I knew. I just wish I would have listened to my heart because now I see him with Sally, and all I can think is after everything that she's done to him and his family, how could he be with somebody like that?",
        "Bill: He won't be for much longer. Now that you're back in town, that changes everything.",
        "Caroline: You think so?",
        "Bill: Up against real competition, a Spencer... Sally doesn't stand a freakin' chance.",
        "Caroline: Thanks, uncle bill.",
        "Sally: I wasn't sure what to think when Caroline showed up.",
        "Thomas: I would have warned you if I had known.",
        "Sally: I still wouldn't have been prepared. Seeing her with your son, to be honest with you, just -- it kind of threw me.",
        "Thomas: Well, he is kind of a ladies' man, so I get it.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, he's definitely more handsome than his father.",
        "Thomas: Ow. Ow.",
        "Sally: No, that's not what I mean. You're always going to have a relationship with Douglas. So Caroline will always be in your life.",
        "Thomas: Is that a problem?",
        "Sally: No. No, it's just gonna take some getting used to.",
        "Thomas: It's gonna take some getting used to for all of us.",
        "Sally: But I know we can do it. There's no reason for me to be nervous or jealous.",
        "Thomas: No. Not at all. She is an awesome mom, and she's an awesome woman, but... she is not the woman that I want to go home to at night.",
        "Quinn: I need to find my husband.",
        "Liam: I don't know what to tell you, Quinn. Maybe if I knew what happened...",
        "Quinn: No, he -- he won't answer my calls, he won't respond to my texts. He's out there somewhere and he's -- he's angry and he's upset and there's nothing I can do!",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, angry about what? You said you got into an argument, right?",
        "Quinn: Yeah, and I would fix it if he were just here.",
        "Liam: Okay, but if -- if he doesn't want to see you, then...",
        "Quinn: I know, I know, you probably think I deserve this.",
        "Liam: I'm not --",
        "Quinn: That why should I be happy when I've caused so many people so much pain? Maybe you're right! Maybe I brought this on myself, you know? I -- I messed up, and... and maybe my marriage won't survive this, but I can't do nothing. I have to try, you know? I can just let Eric disappear from my life!",
        "Liam: He didn't disappear. But obviously you did something to drive him away.",
        "Ridge: Your grandfather's very angry right now -- he has every right to be -- but that doesn't mean that his marriage is over.",
        "Steffy: Quinn betrayed him with his son.",
        "Ridge: I know, his son. I -- I do things...",
        "Steffy: Oh, what? Oh, you -- you \"lost control?\" You \"couldn't help it?\" Damn it, dad! My whole life, it's just the same excuse.",
        "Ridge: Quinn loves your grandfather very much. That hasn't changed. And my love for him hasn't changed, either.",
        "Steffy: Oh, god, how can you say that?",
        "Ridge: I know, I know, it's difficult, but it's the truth. It's true.",
        "Steffy: Does Brooke know? Is that why she called off the wedding? After everything you guys have been through to be together...",
        "Ridge: I have no explanation. No excuse. You have two people with so much on the line. You do something like that, you do something so stupid... but, you know, the worst thing about all this, Steffy? We hurt the people we love the most.",
        "Thomas: Bill, if you're looking for an exclusive, you're gonna have to wait till the showdown like everyone else.",
        "Bill: No, I'm just checking out my property, not your...designs.",
        "Thomas: Not your property.",
        "Bill: Yet.",
        "Thomas: Not if this challenge goes the way I think it will.",
        "Bill: That's what you're thinking about? Bathing suits?",
        "Thomas: Bill, if you'll excuse me, I have a challenge to win.",
        "Bill: Thomas, come on, pull your head out! The Spencer summit is an exclusive event! You're talking about a forum for the most powerful leaders in the international business community! You think Spectra fits the bill?",
        "Thomas: That's exactly why we're going to Monte Carlo, bill, so we can change that impression.",
        "Bill: You ought to stick to changing your underwear, 'cause you ain't gonna change any impression. Come on, what, you think a logo and a new pencil-pusher changes something for Spectra? It doesn't. You're small-time. You can't compete with the likes of Forrester creations! And to try to convince Sally otherwise is doing her a disservice.",
        "Thomas: I'm not gonna be letting Sally down.",
        "Bill: You mean like you let everyone else down? I mean, come on, Thomas. That's what you're good at. Right? Sketching and disappointing people. Like your family. And mine. Caroline is the mother of your son, but she's also my niece, and Douglas is my grand-nephew, and, unlike you, I take care of my family.",
        "Thomas: All right, bill. Listen up. Caroline left me. That's how it happened. I am a good provider, and I am good father to my son!",
        "Bill: Well, I'm sure that Caroline had her good reasons, but that was then, and this is now. And now she's trying to make it right. But you're busy trying to show the world what a big man you are instead of actually being one. The mother of your child is back in L.A., and what are you doing? Hmm? You're running off to Monte Carlo so you can show the world and make headlines with your latest conquest! Must be in the genes. Now, look, this -- this little romp with Sally is a distraction and a disappointment. You have left your son's legacy at Forrester creations in the dust! Every decision you've made is for yourself. Poor Tommy! \"I've got to have some control!\" What you got to have are some stones, some responsibility, because that's what you have -- you have responsibility -- and it's about damn time you live up to it! So put this nonsense with Sally and Spectra where it belongs -- in the garbage.",
        "Liam: Listen, Steffy's concerned, too. She's talking to Ridge right now. Okay, you don't have to tell me what happened, but Steffy's gonna find out why Eric's not here.",
        "Steffy: I don't understand. You and Quinn hated each other. You wanted Quinn out of my granddad's life just like I did!",
        "Ridge: I misjudged her.",
        "Steffy: Did you do this because you were mad at granddad for making me CEO? Were you just trying to get back at him?",
        "Ridge: No. No, I -- I was trying to help dad. I was trying to show him what a horrible woman she is, how she can't be trusted.",
        "Steffy: Is that how it started?",
        "Ridge: With my arrogance. That's how it started.",
        "Steffy: But when Quinn made you co-CEO, you told everyone to accept her. Were you guys involved then?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Steffy: Oh, okay, so that wasn't the beginning.",
        "Ridge: No. It was, but it --",
        "Steffy: You know, granddad was so proud of you, he was so happy that his son and his wife could finally get along.",
        "Ridge: Well, that was real.",
        "Steffy: So you have feelings for her?",
        "Ridge: She loves your grandfather and she doesn't want to lose him.",
        "Steffy: You know what? I don't blame granddad for taking off, not one bit. [Scoffs] I can barely look at you right now. I can't even imagine what granddad feels... ...what my mom felt every time you betrayed her, dad. 'Cause that's what you do. You hurt everyone in your life. You're a great father and you're a great designer, but when it comes to your love life... how many mistakes can you make? How many people can you really hurt?",
        "Ridge: I don't expect forgiveness from anyone. But I would love a chance to make this right.",
        "Steffy: Well, I don't know if that's possible. [Scoffs] I warned granddad. I fought so hard for that relationship not to happen. I knew Quinn was gonna hurt him. But I never thought in a million years you would help her do it. You are my father, you are my mentor, and I love you so much. But I don't know what to think of you right now."
