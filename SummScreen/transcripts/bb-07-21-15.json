        "Nicole beams that man sure knows how to chose a ring. It was the hit of the photo shoot. Rick says he should have asked Julius first. Julius says times have changed now, but he does approve. This has his blessing. All backstage drink champagne to California Freedom. Steffy tries to include Aly but she snarls that she can not be part of it. She is not yet 21 years old. She tells dark Darla that she can change this. She can do something so bad. Darla tells her to do it tonight. Brooke tells Maya that she is very happy for her and Rick. Maya says she understands it was not easy for her. Rick asks about Julius' flight. He assumes Rick wants to get rid of him. Rick says far from it, he just would hate him to go home and then have to return for the wedding. Julius mentions the cost and Rick says he will take care of all of that. That suits Julius just fine and he thanks Rick for all he is doing. Steffy does not want anything to ruin this celebration and tells Liam that he can wait one more day to let Ivy down gently as she seems to still think she has a chance with Liam. Wyatt says they need to put away some jewelry and then they will join them in a bigger celebration. Rick drags Maya into an empty room and says finally. He kisses her and says they are going to be married. Aly tinkers with one of Steffy's tires just before Steffy gets into the car and takes off. Not far behind, Aly follows.",
        "Most are meeting at the Forrester house. Steffy calls Liam and he says she better not be skipping this party. She says she never skips a party. She will be there soon. Ivy goes up to check on Aly. Meanwhile Steffy has to pull over and finds she has a flat tire because of a nail. She looks at it but is not sure what to do. Ivy finds Aly's room bare with all her stuffed animals covered in her bed to make it look like she is sleeping there. Ivy looks around and finds the HATE board. Aly is barreling down the highway and hears dark Darla say to take Steffy out, the same way her mother took her life. Julius tells Vivienne that this Rick is really some man. He could have had any woman he wanted and he wanted Maya. Now they can all enjoy the benefits, maybe even to move to L. A. and be closer to Nicole. He is doing the best he can. Maybe if he sticks around these crazy people he can become one of them and accept Maya. Steffy tries her best to get the lug nuts off and lays her phone down. Ivy shows Wyatt and Liam the HATE board in closet. Liam is afraid since they do not know where Aly is or exactly where Steffy is and he needs to call her and tell her this. Dark Darla tells Aly this is her chance. Steffy is just ahead stalled on the highway. This is her opportunity to snuff her out just like her mother did her years ago. Aly starts the engine and guns the car and steers it right into the lights with Steffy's scared face."

        "[Laughter]",
        "Brooke: You never shy away from a moment.",
        "Julius: Risky to do it in public. I mean, what if the answer was no?",
        "Vivienne: Oh, stop.",
        "Rick: Well, I felt confident",
        "Nicole: Dad, how did you propose?",
        "Julius: I asked your grandfather, of course.",
        "Vivienne: Uh, don't make it sound so old fashion. We were out to dinner when he asked me to marry him. It was very sweet and somewhat public.",
        "Julius: I asked your father first.",
        "Rick: Um... I didn't even...I...should I have?",
        "Julius: Oh, no, no, no, listen. Times have changed. I wouldn't have expected... it's not my place to say what Maya should or should not do with her life. But for the record... I can't believe I'm saying this. I approve. This union absolutely has my blessing.",

        "Aly: And now I have to go to some stupid after-party where they'll all be celebrating. \"Oh, we're so wonderful and talented. Yay for California Freedom, the clothing line that frees you from morals and responsibility.\"",
        "Darla: You and Ivy are the only two Forresters left with any sense of what's right.",
        "Aly: But it doesn't have to be that way. I could change things. I could do something so big to turn this family around.",
        "Darla: Do that, Aly. Do it tonight.",

        "Brooke: I just want you to understand that I am very happy for the two of you. Really. And those intense words about you disclosing --",

        "[Laughter]",

        "Nicole: Wait. How soon is the wedding?",
        "Rick: As soon as we can have it. I don't want to wait.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Just Aly has been so dark lately, you know? And it's not just at work, either. Soon as she gets home, she goes straight to her room. I think she really needs professional help.",
        "Steffy: No, I-I just don't think any of us should give up on her. Let's engage, okay, and show her that we care. So tonight, let's all try to connect with her at the party.",
        "Ivy: Well, that's if she even comes to the party. And if she does come home, she's just gonna go straight to her room.",

        "Liam: Are you kidding me? Did you see the looks on the buyers' faces? Steffy, that is not gonna be a problem.",
        "Ivy: You want to know my fantasy? This quarter, Forrester makes a bazillion dollars.",
        "Steffy: A bazillion? I like the way you fantasize.",
        "Ivy: Oh, hey, you were in Paris, and we all had to suffer through Rick bragging about Forrester's highest quarterly profit. You could not walk around any office without overhearing it.",
        "Wyatt: She's not exaggerating, either.",
        "Liam: God, I would love to beat that record.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",

        "Steffy: She still thinks there's a chance.",
        "Liam: I know. But I did mean what I said. I'm committed to you now. I just... I have to find a way to explain it to her. I don't know. Maybe -- maybe I can, like, pull her aside at the party or something.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no, no, no. Not tonight. This is our first showing as leaders together. No, I-I just want everyone to enjoy it. Ivy, too. I don't want anything to ruin the celebration.",

        "Vivienne: Oh, suddenly you can say \"our daughter\" without rolling your eyes?",
        "Julius: Oh, I'm rolling my eyes. I'm just doing a better job of hiding it. We've got a future son-in-law to impress.",
        "Vivienne: We don't have to impress Rick. He's marrying Maya, not us.",

        "Zende: Yeah, the music they're playing is pretty bad.",
        "Nicole: Yeah. Othello may have a gig tonight, but no worries. Nicole to the rescue.",
        "Zende: Oh. Part-time deejay.",

        "Rick: Why not?",
        "Maya: That seems like a lot to plan.",
        "Rick: Oh, no, no, no. We are not gonna drag this thing on and on. I have learned from Carter's mistake.",
        "Maya: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't -- don't even go there.",
        "Rick: It's true.",
        "Maya: All that time pining away for you, not being able to say a word.",
        "Rick: I'm glad you did.",
        "Maya: I was so scared. Feels like a lifetime ago.",
        "Rick: You have never, ever been scared.",
        "Maya: To tell you how I felt? Of course I was. Because saying something meant that I'd have to tell you everything eventually. But I'm glad that I took the chance.",

        "Steffy: [Grunts] [Sighs] Okay.",
        "Darla: Do it. Take her out! Same way her mother took me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: You know, this Rick guy is really something else. I mean, he could have any woman he wants, an actual woman. He chose Maya.",
        "Vivienne: She is a woman. We just have to accept it.",
        "Julius: Man, woman, whatever. All I know is that she's not our problem anymore. We get her married off to Rick, becomes Rick's problem. Instead of having to be embarrassed about what our son has done to himself, we can sit back finally and -- and enjoy the benefits, maybe even move to L.A., spend more time with Nicole, get us a nice, little house on the hill.",
        "Vivienne: Oh, so this is about the money, huh? You've been lying. You never intended to accept Maya.",
        "Julius: I've not been lying. I made it very clear that I would try to accept it.",
        "Vivienne: You're not trying hard enough.",
        "Julius: I am. I'm here, aren't I? Huh? I'm here at her little fashion show. I'm calling her \"daughter,\" I'm saying \"her.\" I am doing the best I can. And maybe -- maybe if I -- if I stay around these crazy L.A. people long enough, maybe I'll become like them. And then I'll be able to accept it.",
        "Vivienne: You really believe that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Yes, it's going to be a celebration. You, too. Louis said you looked radiant accepting my proposal.",
        "Maya: Oh. Merci, Louis.",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "Maya: And there it is, all the calls pouring in, people wanting to congratulate you.",
        "Rick: The most beautiful woman in the world agreed to be my wife. Of course the phone's gonna be ringing off the hook.",
        "[Ringing stops]",
        "Rick: Oops. Voicemail.",
        "Maya: The whole world, huh?",
        "Rick: Well, I do run International. I know these things.",

        "Wyatt: What the hell?",
        "Liam: Okay. Okay, because we don't know where Aly is or what she's up to, I want to make sure Steffy knows about this.",

        "[Cell phone vibrates]",
        "Steffy: [Grunts] Come on!",
        "Aly: [Sighs] This is for you, Mom.",
        "Darla: For the whole family. Put an end to her.",
        "Aly: Not my company. Not my family. She is just like her mother, taking everything from me! California Freedom. This isn't freedom. It's perversion! It's wrong! It's wrong!",
        "Darla: Get rid of her. Make her pay, Aly! For what her mother did to me, strike now!",
        "[Engine revs]",
        "[Tires screech]",
