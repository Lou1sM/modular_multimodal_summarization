        "After sleeping on it, Ridge tells Katie that he is more convinced than ever that Bill was behind the helicopter dump. She says he knows what he is saying, potential attempted murder. She says Bill has many character flaws and being a jerk is one of them. But she wants him to be 100% sure that he saw Justin and the SP jacket on while he was piloting the helicopter. Ridge says he is not making this up and he realizes the consequences of it as Bill will go away for a very long time. So he has been struggling with it, but yes he is sure that Justin was piloting and Bill gave him orders to dump him in the ocean. She says okay then they just have to prove that Bill chartered a helicopter in Abu Dhabi. He has a lot of money and he is usually willing to spend that money to cover his tracks. So she will help him prove it. Brooke has breakfast with Bill and says she can't believe that Ridge is still accusing him of masterminding this horrible accident. Bill says Ridge has never been objective when it comes to him. They are getting married and what does Ridge get \u0096 his bell rung. She says she never expected them to be friends but to accuse him of this is going way too far. Bill says he is going to keep good thoughts and perhaps this cloud will lift before Ridge goes further with any more slander. He checks with someone on the phone and Brooke manages to get it out of him that it is Catalina and he'd like to make arrangements to get married there today. Alison gives explicit orders to Adele to keep Bill's liquor cabinet fresh each day; no half filled bottles. Just be creative. Deacon surprises Alison by showing up. He calls her beautiful still and ends up charming everything out of her that he wants. He asks if she will give him a hug and she does. While looking around Deacon is amused by a large model of a helicopter, Bill's helicopter. He proposes to Alison that they take the chopper and fly over for a romantic view of the city. She says as much as she would like that, they can't as the chopper isn't here. Next thing you know she is telling him that it is on Bill's yacht and still in the Middle East.",
        "Adele brings a briefcase full of papers for Katie to look at but nothing proves that Bill ordered a helicopter. Katie tells Ridge to sit and not be so nervous. He says it is just too darn frustrating not finding the answers they hoped for. He hates to see that smirk on Bill's face, but he's going to find the answers and bury him. No one makes a perfect crime so they just need to find the mistake. Deacon arrives and tells Ridge that he has something he might find very interesting. He can look all he wants but he will not find any records. They don't exist but there is a reason why. Ridge tells him to spit it out. Deacon says Bill has his own helicopter. He keeps it on the back of his yacht. So there never was a record of a flight plan. That's the helicopter that Ridge was dumped from. Brooke tells Bill that she likes fun and she trusts him explicitly so just lead the way to their wedding and she will follow. People just do not know him like she does. He is an amazing man, so thoughtful, gentle and so generous. He's a lot more than people give him credit for. He says he does not need the world's validation; just hers. She says he has it till death they do part. He confesses that he is a flawed man and still makes mistakes and errors in judgment but he wants her to know that he's working on it to be worthy of her. He never wants to lose her. Deacon tells Ridge now all he has to do is find out where this yacht is docked. ..winner, winner, chicken dinner. Ridge thanks Deacon and says this is the proof they need. Katie admits Bill has been lying to them all this while. Ridge says Bill Spencer is now officially out of business."

        "Katie: So, you've had a chance to sleep on it.",
        "Ridge: I'm more convinced than ever.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Ridge: You know Spencer better than anybody. He has no moral compass. He's ruthless.",
        "Katie: Yes. In business, he is, and -- [Sighs] And in his personal life sometimes. But, Ridge, we're talking about attempted murder.",
        "Ridge: Exactly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I still can't believe Ridge is accusing you of masterminding this horrible accident.",
        "Bill: Well... you've never been, uh, rational or objective where I'm concerned. I mean, come on. He flies all the way to Abu Dhabi instead of just picking up the phone? And how'd that turn out? We're still getting married. And what did he get for all his trouble? His bell rung.",
        "Brooke: I just feel horrible -- so compromised. I mean, everybody knows the two of you are never gonna be friends, but for him to actually blame you for trying to kill him -- that's going way too far.",
        "Bill: It's very sad. And we're going to keep good thoughts for him. Hopefully, this cloud will lift before he takes his potential slander any further.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Mr. Spencer's bar is to be fully stocked at all times -- fully stocked. No half-empty bottles.",
        "Adele: And what am I supposed to do -- pour them out? He'd hate that even more, wasting his precious liquor.",
        "Alison: Find somewhere to put the bottles -- a designated cabinet, an empty drawer. Be creative.",
        "Adele: Those days are long gone.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I didn't get that.",
        "Adele: I said I'll figure it out.",
        "Alison: Lovely. That'll be all.",
        "Deacon: Tu sei veramente una bella donna. Beautiful still.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Mm. No, I like that. Yeah. Great attention to detail. All right. You just, uh, wait for my -- wait for my call. I look forward to it.",
        "Brooke: To what?",
        "Bill: To our brilliant future.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: I missed you.",
        "Brooke: I was only gone a few minutes.",
        "Bill: Yeah, a few minutes too long.",
        "Brooke: You're so sweet. So what are you looking forward to?",
        "Bill: Well, if you must know, I was on the phone with my contact in Catalina, and, well, it's a beautiful day, so I was making some arrangements.",
        "Brooke: So, you want to spend the night there?",
        "Bill: Mm, well, yeah, there is that, but what I really want to do is get married there -- today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: It's the arrogance. That's what gets me more than anything else. Bill Spencer -- poor, misunderstood, wrongly accused Bill Spencer. [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Well, he has many character flaws, and being a jerk is one of them.",
        "Ridge: He tried to kill me, and I will prove it.",
        "Katie: All right. So, you are 100% sure that you saw Justin flying that helicopter and you saw the \"SP\" logo on his jacket?",
        "Ridge: Yes.",
        "Katie: Not a doubt in your mind?",
        "Ridge: No. I'm -- I've been -- I'm struggling with it because [Sighs] this is a very serious accusation. If it sticks, he's gonna go away for a very, very long time. But I'm not making this up just to get rid of Bill. And, yes, I am 100% sure that Justin was flying the helicopter and that Bill gave the order to dump me out of it.",
        "Katie: Okay. Then we just have to prove that Bill chartered a helicopter in Abu Dhabi.",
        "Ridge: I tried that. I can't get anywhere.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, Bill has a lot of money, and he's usually willing to spend that money to cover his tracks.",
        "Ridge: So, you believe me?",
        "Katie: Of course I believe you.",
        "Ridge: And you're gonna help me prove it?",
        "Katie: That was never in question.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles] [Knock on door] Oh. In fact, here she is. Hello, Adele.",
        "Adele: Hello!",
        "Katie: Do you have what I need?",
        "Adele: Right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Now, you didn't really think I'd come back to Los Angeles and not track you down, did you?",
        "Alison: Actually, I was surprised to get your call. You haven't exactly been communicative.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Well, I haven't exactly been able to call. Your boss did run me out of town.",
        "Alison: But you're back?",
        "Deacon: Oh, honey, I'm back. Are you glad to see me?",
        "Alison: Of course. But you shouldn't be here. Bill could come in any minute.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] I got to tell you... I really like it. I like -- I like this. I've always been a sucker for brunettes. But, then again, with a face like this, hair color's kind of irrelevant, isn't it?",
        "Alison: Still the charmer, I see.",
        "Deacon: What can I say? I call 'em like I see 'em. What, no hug?",
        "Alison: I'm not sure that you deserve one.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So, you want us to get married today, as in a few hours, husband and wife?",
        "Bill: Don't you?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Yes! Yes! Of course I do!",
        "Bill: Okay! Well, that's what I've been waiting to hear! That's it right there! That's what I wanted to hear!",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] So, what should I expect?",
        "Bill: Why would I tell you?",
        "Brooke: Because I'm the bride and I need to know what's going on. I know nothing.",
        "Bill: Well, it's not the first time. You know, I pulled things off pretty well in Abu Dhabi, didn't I?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. You did.",
        "Bill: Okay. I got this, girl.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Bill is meticulous about all of the expenses at Spencer. He wants to know what comes in and what goes out. He is almost obsessive about it.",
        "Ridge: Thank you, Adele. This might be the paper trail we need.",
        "Adele: You asked for my loyalty the day you hired me.",
        "Katie: And you have come through every single time, especially today. Thank you. This could be what we need. Let's see what we've got.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Here we go. We've got flower deliveries, limousines. A Lamborghini. Very nice. This must have cost the company a fortune.",
        "Katie: What we need is the day of the wedding.",
        "Adele: I organized chronologically. Um, here. Let me.",
        "Katie: Double massage. High-end boutique.",
        "Ridge: Oh. We can see what they had for breakfast. Nothing about a helicopter. [Sighs]",
        "Katie: There's nothing here.",
        "Ridge: There is something here. We just got to find it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You don't seem worried about Bill finding you here.",
        "Deacon: He knows I'm here.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. Dollar Bill's in a better mood these days. He's about to marry the love of his life, and then there is that inconvenient fact that I happen to be Hope's father, which does afford me certain rights.",
        "Alison: Have you seen her?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, a few times.",
        "Alison: And?",
        "Deacon: Things are good between us. I know my daughter is a very compassionate woman with a forgiving heart, which is a good thing for her old man.",
        "Alison: I'm glad you and Hope were able to come back from Italy.",
        "Deacon: Yeah. You know, I've thought a lot about our time in Italy, too.",
        "Alison: Ours?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. All those hours we spent alone in the farmhouse? I mean, I know I wasn't really fit for public consumption. I was just out of prison, still kind of locked in that mind-set, and I was very angry and defensive. But I'm not that guy anymore. And I'd really like the chance to prove that to certain people. [Laughs] Look at this. This guy -- you got to love him. I mean, he not only has his own helicopter, he made himself a little model, too. [Chuckles] Man, that must be something else just to have a chopper at your disposal like that, huh?",
        "Alison: It comes in handy.",
        "Deacon: I got an idea. Hey. What if we hijack it?",
        "Alison: [Laughs]",
        "Deacon: No, no. I'm serious. We could do this.",
        "Alison: You can't possibly be serious.",
        "Deacon: I'm totally seri-- look, you have access to it, right? I mean, you know, we'll just take the thing, right? We'll go for a nice, romantic flight over the city. Come on. Come on. What airport should be go from? We'll go from, uh, what, Santa Monica?",
        "Alison: Even if I could take the time, the chopper's not here.",
        "Deacon: Well, if the chopper's not in the hangar, then where is it?",
        "Alison: It's on the yacht, and it's still in the Middle East.",
        "Deacon: Ah. What's it like being on a yacht -- and with a helipad, nonetheless?",
        "Alison: I really shouldn't talk about it.",
        "Deacon: Oh, come on. It's just us here.",
        "Alison: Nothing short of glorious.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Alison: No crowded airports.",
        "Deacon: Yeah. You got to hand it to 'em, right? I mean, rich people -- they do know how to do life.",
        "Alison: Indeed.",
        "Deacon: Yeah. It kind of doesn't seem fair, does it? I mean, it never seems to trickle down. People like you and me -- we get to rub our shoulders with luxury, but we never get to take it home.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Alison: I have to take this. Yes, Bill?",
        "Bill: Hey, where is he?",
        "Alison: Justin? I'm not sure, but I can find him.",
        "Bill: Well, I'd appreciate that. I need to talk to him A.S.A.P.",
        "Alison: On it. I must say, you sound rather chipper.",
        "Bill: Well, you are talking to a very happy man, Alison.",
        "Deacon: I got to tell you, it just blows me away, the kind of money these people have -- the yachts, private jets, and helicopters. I mean, the Bill for caviar and champagne alone probably makes your head swirl. And you got a private pilot on retainer. I guess that's why Bill has what's-his-name -- uh, Justin.",
        "Alison: What about him?",
        "Deacon: No, nothing. I think I just heard somewhere that Justin's a pilot, so it makes sense that he'd fly for Bill.",
        "Alison: Why would that concern you?",
        "Deacon: It doesn't.",
        "Alison: Look, I don't mean to rush you off.",
        "Deacon: Can we see each other again?",
        "Alison: Possible.",
        "Deacon: Then we can go somewhere quiet. We can be alone, relax, catch up.",
        "Alison: You have my number.",
        "Deacon: You'll be hearing from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thank you so much, Adele, for pulling everything together.",
        "Adele: I'm sorry it didn't work, but anything else I can do, don't hesitate.",
        "Katie: All right.",
        "Katie: All right. Come here. Come here. Sit down.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Katie: Just sit.",
        "Ridge: Okay. [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Just take a breath, okay?",
        "Ridge: It's frustrating.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Ridge: His lackey dumps me out of a helicopter to almost die, and he's just standing there with that look on his face, just that smirk. He's convinced that no one's ever gonna find out the truth. But I will find out. I will. I'm gonna find what I need, and I'm gonna bury him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Come on. Give me one tiny hint.",
        "Bill: Mm, uh, we'll be crossing the water.",
        "Brooke: Duh. We're going to Catalina. That much I know.",
        "Bill: Be happy. That's all you're getting.",
        "Brooke: Are you sure?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: I have my ways.",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah. I'm well aware.",
        "Brooke: And I will use them to bring you down.",
        "Bill: Mm. Oh, go on, now. Wait. This is not fair! It's like a weapon of mass destruction!",
        "Brooke: All is fair.",
        "Bill: You will not break me.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I hear a challenge.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on. Let me surprise you. It'll be fun.",
        "Brooke: I like fun. And I trust you implicitly. So, lead the way to our wedding, and I shall follow.",
        "Bill: Mm. Music to my ears. That's what every control freak wants to hear.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: There's no such thing as a perfect crime. He made a mistake somewhere. We got to find it. What do you call -- the digital imprint, right? Maybe on his computer or Alison's computer -- how 'bout that?",
        "Katie: You're thinking of breaking and entering?",
        "Ridge: He did this to me, and I'm gonna prove it.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Katie: Hello, Deacon.",
        "Deacon: Hello, Katie. Mind if I come in for a second? I need to speak to you and Ridge.",
        "Katie: Sure. Come on in.",
        "Deacon: All right.",
        "Ridge: What are you doing here?",
        "Deacon: You remember when I told you and Brooke that I might be able to get some information about the, uh, accident?",
        "Ridge: Have you?",
        "Deacon: Oh, I got something I think you're gonna find very interesting.",
        "Katie: All right. Tell us.",
        "Deacon: You can keep looking till you're old. You're not gonna find any records linking Spencer to any helicopter charter. They don't exist. But there's a reason why.",
        "Ridge: Spit it out!",
        "Deacon: Spencer has his own helicopter in Abu Dhabi. Keeps it on the back of his yacht. That's why no one could find any records. There was never any charter. Guys, he used his own helicopter! That's what you were dumped from!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: It's hard to believe it's finally happening.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: After everything we've been through, we're finally getting married.",
        "Bill: Long time coming.",
        "Brooke: A lot of ups and downs.",
        "Bill: Crashed and burned a couple of times.",
        "Brooke: But we loved each other through it all.",
        "Bill: Never stopped.",
        "Brooke: Not even when I thought I had. Thank you for being so persistent.",
        "Bill: There's no way I'd ever give up on us.",
        "Brooke: Isn't that strange? People are so quick to point a finger at you, to blame you for everything that goes wrong. But they don't know you like I do. You're an amazing man. You're so thoughtful and gentle and generous. You're a stallion.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: I mean, really, you're a lot deeper than most people give you credit for.",
        "Bill: I don't need the world's validation -- just yours.",
        "Brooke: You got it, till death do us part.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles softly] I'm a flawed man, Brooke. I still make mistakes, errors in judgment.",
        "Brooke: We all make mistakes.",
        "Bill: I just want you to know that... I'm trying to be better -- I'm working on it -- so I'm worthy of you. It might not be a straight shot to perfection... but I'm really trying to do the best I can. I never want to lose you.",
        "Brooke: You won't. I'm gonna be your wife. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: All right. So, I'm wandering around Liam's office, and I happen to see that model of the Spencer helicopter. So, I start pretending that I'm all fascinated with the way that rich people live their lives. Alison and I -- we kind of have that in common. You know what I'm talking abou-- of course you don't. You know, so close, yet so far.",
        "Katie: Okay. So, you have this little conversation with Alison, and she just spills everything? I find that hard to believe. She's very loyal to Bill.",
        "Deacon: Gosh, Katie. I'd like to think I was a little more artful than that. All right, look -- she was kind of cagey, and then she got cagier, but, in between all this, she lets it slip that the helicopter -- when it's not in the hangar, they keep it on the yacht. Now, Ridge, for the bonus rounds, see if you can figure out where the yacht is docked.",
        "Ridge: Abu Dhabi.",
        "Deacon: Winner, winner, chicken dinner.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. The yacht has a helipad. Of course.",
        "Deacon: Hmm?",
        "Ridge: So, I was right. Bill's helicopter was there the whole time, and Justin was flying it. He picked them up and brought them to the yacht for the honeymoon.",
        "Katie: He's been lying to Brooke. He's been lying to all of us.",
        "Ridge: That's the proof we need. Thank you, Deacon. Bill Spencer is officially out of business."
