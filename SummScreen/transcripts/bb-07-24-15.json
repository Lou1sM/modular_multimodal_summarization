        "Steffy staggers into the house in shambles and Liam sees her startled face and asks what is wrong. She thinks back to the accident off the side of the road and with Ivy being there. She remembers telling Ivy she does not know what happened but that Aly attacked her. She thinks she is dead. Likewise Ivy is at work and is crying when Wyatt comes in and she can not look at him. She tells him that Aly is dead. She fills him in on what happened on PCH. Aly died because of Steffy. She would still be alive if it were not for Steffy. He needs more information. She says she was looking for Aly and saw the two cars on the side of the road. Whatever happened Steffy did not have to kill her.",
        "Steffy cries and tells Liam that she was changing a tire and looked into the lights of a car barreling down on her at the side of the road. It was Aly. It was at the spot where Aly's mother died and Aly must have been re-enacting that moment. Steffy had to defend herself as Aly was out to kill her. Nicole and Zende are cleaning up the showroom when he encourages her to get on the runway and strut it. Thorne comes downstairs and starts to apologize to Steffy that he knows Aly had her ups and downs and he knows she needs at least one parent so he is taking her back to Paris and get her back in therapy. Someday she will get better and can come back to L.A. Steffy tells him she won't. Thorne refuses to believe her version of what happened. His little girl would never try to hurt anyone. He keeps telling Steffy to tell him where Aly is right now. He thinks gone means she has run away and Steffy can not bring herself to stay she is dead. Steffy says she is sorry, she did not mean to do it. It was an accident. Ivy shows Wyatt the video and asks why would Steffy lie to the police if she was not guilty. Aly did not trip. Steffy hit her with the tire iron and she fell down dead. She does not want to believe this. This was not an accident. It was murder. Steffy is shell shocked and falls into Liam's arms."

I mean, all those X'ed out photos of Steffy and Maya, I'd be worried, too. Hey. What -- look, Thorne will get her the help she needs, okay? She'll be okay.",

        "Liam: What?",
        "Steffy: [Voice breaking] I thought I was gonna die. And then the car just stopped inches -- inches away from me.",

        "Ivy: Aly would still be alive if it wasn't for Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Look, let's just -- let's start from the beginning, okay? Can you do that? What happened?",
        "Ivy: [Sniffles] Okay, so I was -- I was driving down PCH. I was -- I was looking -- I was looking for Aly, and then... and I see her, and I see Steffy on the side of the road. I had no idea what was about to happen. [Sniffles] Even -- even if Aly was growing unstable, Steffy didn't have to kill her.",

        "Steffy: The car that tried to run me down, it was Aly. Aly was driving.",

        "Steffy: No, it's -- it's where her mom died. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Steffy: Where I pulled over is exactly where my mom accidentally killed Darla.",
        "Liam: W-what are you -- what are you saying?",
        "Steffy: She was trying to reenact the scene with me. That's what happened. I don't know. I don't know. She -- she was arguing with me, and then I tried to calm her down, and then out of the blue, she just -- she attacked me.",
        "Steffy: [Grunts] And I-I had to defend myself. I thought she was gonna kill me. And then something happened. She's dead. [Sniffles] Aly's dead.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: I thought I heard voices. I was hoping it was Aly. I'm starting to get a little worried about her. She's still not answering her cell. Have you seen her?",

        "Zende: Why does that surprise you?",
        "Nicole: I don't know. I guess I've always been pretty cynical about things working out for me. Like, what's the point of having dreams if that's all they'll ever be, you know? But I think all of that's changing. [Chuckles]",

        "Thorne: I've heard about Aly's behavior. I know that she's been making things unpleasant for you, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: [Sniffles] It's okay.",
        "Thorne: No. No, it's not okay. But that you can find it in your heart to understand --",
        "Steffy: Thorne, I need to tell you something.",
        "Thorne: Please. Let me say this, okay? Aly has had a lot of ups and downs, and being her parent, her only parent, I've tried to fix what's hurting inside of her like I did when she was a little girl and scraped her knee. But this is not a scraped knee. This wound runs much deeper, and, yes, I've got her therapy, but she always seems to regress. And when she came back to LA, I was hoping that this was going to be a new beginning for her. She was gonna be around family and working in the family business, but now that I heard that she's in a dark place again, I...well, I know that I need to be there for her more than ever now. So, I'm taking Aly back to Paris with me in the morning. We can spend all kinds of time together. I can get her back into therapy, and that way when she comes back to LA one day, she'll be whole and healthy and with an exciting, happy future ahead of her. I just wish she would answer her damn cell phone.",
        "Steffy: She won't.",
        "Thorne: What do you mean, she won't? Do you know where Aly is?",
        "Steffy: Aly lost it earlier tonight. She tried to hit me with her car on PCH.",
        "Thorne: What?!",
        "Steffy: She -- she made me get a flat tire, so she could -- she could attack me.",
        "Thorne: No, no, Steffy, Aly would not do that.",
        "Steffy: She was very, very unstable. We should have called you.",
        "Thorne: No, you listen to me. Aly is a lot of things, but she is not dangerous. And I want to talk to her.",
        "Steffy: I told you, you can't.",
        "Thorne: What do you mean, I can't? Where's my little girl?",

        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Wyatt: Do you even hear what you're saying right now?",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, things just got so out of control. Aly was not herself, but Steffy didn't have to go and --",
        "Wyatt: Ivy, stop! Stop! This is crazy. This is beyond crazy. Like, we're talking about Steffy here.",
        "Ivy: I don't like saying this any more than you like hearing it!",
        "Wyatt: So then stop saying it, because it can't be true! Like, what you think happened, it -- it -- that's not how it happened, okay? It's not what it seems.",
        "Ivy: Why are you defending her? Aly's the one who's dead!",
        "Wyatt: I'm not defending her! But you're hurting, and understandably so, but accusing Steffy?!",
        "Ivy: No, no, I'm -- I'm not. I'm not accusing her. I have the proof.",
        "Wyatt: What kind of proof do you have?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Look, I-I don't -- I don't know why I did this. I... I don't know if I just got a bad feeling. [Sighs] Look... as bad as this sounds, as horrific as this sounds, I caught everything that happened on video.",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Wyatt: You have a video of what happened?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] I don't know what made me press record, but I'm -- I'm glad that I did. Just... now do you believe me?",
        "Wyatt: It's not that I didn't believe you. It's just -- I...",
        "Ivy: Look, Wyatt, you just -- you saw what I saw, right? Steffy hits Aly with a tire iron. She falls to the ground. Wyatt, when I ran over to her, she wasn't breathing.",
        "Wyatt: I-I know. But why? That's what I don't understand. Why -- why would Steffy do this?",
        "Ivy: Steffy told police -- Steffy told police that Aly tried to hit her with her car.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: I don't know. Clearly she tried to attack her or something.",
        "Wyatt: Which is where the tire iron comes in, like --",
        "Ivy: Aly was obviously very disturbed, and she needed help, but she didn't deserve to die.",
        "Wyatt: Of course not. I mean, she had her -- she had her whole life ahead of her.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, now she doesn't. [Sighs] Gosh, my cousin... my best friend is gone. I mean, if that's not tragic enough... why -- why would Steffy choose to lie to the police?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Thorne, Steffy's not your enemy. She's trying to tell you something.",
        "Thorne: I don't care what she's trying to do. I want her to tell me where Aly is right now.",
        "Steffy: After Aly tried to hit me with a car --",
        "Thorne: I don't believe you, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: ...I was trying to calm her down. She wanted to kill me.",
        "Thorne: Stop it! Stop! I said stop it! Now, you tell me where Aly is right now!",
        "Liam: Thorne.",
        "Thorne: Tell me!",
        "Steffy: She's...",
        "Thorne: She's what?!",
        "Steffy: [Sobbing] She's gone.",
        "Thorne: Gone? Gone? What? Like, she's run away, gone? Like she's done before?",
        "Steffy: She's gone.",
        "Thorne: Wh-- no.",
        "Steffy: It was an accident.",
        "Thorne: No. No.",
        "Steffy: It was an accident. I didn't mean to do -- I didn't mean -- [Sobs] I'm sorry. No, I'm sorr-- Thorne, it was an accident! Thorne, it was an acc-- [Sobbing] Oh, my God! [Sobbing] It was an --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You can rewatch that a thousand times. It's not gonna change anything.",
        "Wyatt: I know. Only what's on this video isn't what Steffy said to the police.",
        "Ivy: Why would she lie if she wasn't guilty?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. Let's just -- let's start from the beginning. What exactly did Steffy say? Did she mention nothing about the tire iron?",
        "Ivy: No. All she said was that Aly came towards her and then she tripped, and she hit her head hard on a rock.",
        "Wyatt: Which is how she said that Aly died?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, except it's not how she died, not according to this. Steffy hits Aly, and then she falls down. She didn't trip, just like she told authorities. This doesn't make sense, Wyatt. It doesn't add up.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I agree. But there has to be another explanation other than the obvious.",
        "Ivy: Does there? Why?",
        "Wyatt: I-I don't know.",
        "Ivy: Look, you know -- you know how I feel about Steffy. I think she's one of the most manipulative people I've ever met.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, manipulation is one thing, but killing someone? Her cousin? And then lying about it? I can't -- I can't even begin to wrap my head around that.",
        "Ivy: Well, then maybe we should start to. Maybe we should start to, because unless you convince me of a reason why not to believe this -- I mean, can you?",
        "Wyatt: I...",
        "Ivy: No. See, neither can I. Wyatt, Aly is dead, and it's because of Steffy. I can't pretend that I don't have this footage. Aly deserves justice, and she's gonna get it. This wasn't an accident. This was murder.",
