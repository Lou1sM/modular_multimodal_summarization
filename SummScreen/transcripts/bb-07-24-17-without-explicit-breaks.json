    "Recap": [
        "Caroline visits Bill and takes blame for her taking off to NY and leaving Thomas and now he is playing house with little Orphan Sally as Bill calls her. Thomas tells Sally that Spencer Summit is just around the corner. There is no doubt in his mind that they are gonna kill it. Wyatt says he is enjoying every minute of working with all of them almost as much as he does at Spectra. Katie is doing a bang up job. Zende says he is just thankful to be part of it and Nicole can't wait to strut her stuff on the runway. Wyatt says he is looking at a victory for Forrester hands down. Grams tells Sally that she is heading to Monaco and needs to spruce things up, make a splash. Bill promises Caroline that if it is Thomas she wants then he will do everything he can to get that for her. He tells Steffy that is it. He will forget that building for a moment and concentrate on her brother's life. Nicole tells Ivy that Zende is modest but he is very excited about his designs for the showing. Katie tells Brooke that it is not easy but she is enjoying all of this. She won't answer that question about anybody in her love life. Sally tells Grams that Monaco speaks mainly French and even English so she thinks she has it covered. Thomas tells them that presentation is everything. They need high quality as this is Spectra's comeback. They are here to stay. Bill tells Steffy that Sally needs to be fumigated. He wants that building razed and done. How is Caroline going to put her family together with that red-headed wannabe around? Thomas seems happy to be traveling with this circus. They need a plan to drive Sally and Thomas apart.",
        "Katie tells Wyatt that she cannot take all the credit for this as it was his idea. He corrects her and says they did it together and she is taking the ball and running with it. Bill tells Steffy that Sally is the kind that eats chumps for breakfast. She will use the elevator to get to the top and then kick Thomas to the curb. He cannot have that. There has to be a plan. Bill calls Thomas and says this really is important and he is begging Thomas to come by his office. Thomas thinks he is too busy with his designs but agrees finally and tells Sally not to worry. There is nothing Bill can say to get out of the challenge. Bill concocts a plan. Steffy tells Caroline that she wishes she would have come home months ago and she'd be with Thomas. Bill welcomes Thomas and says he appreciates him coming. But he cannot help but say that he has abandoned his sister and now taken up with this Sally. There is something he should know. Thomas says if this is about Caroline and her son then he knows Caroline abandoned him not the other way around. Bill says hear him out. Bill says he too was the playboy of the day but he's learned from that. He has responsibility now. There is something he has discovered recently something Caroline does not want anyone else to know. He will always help Caroline but this time he cannot help her. Caroline told him something and does not want Thomas to know. But considering he is the father of her son Bill feels he has the right to know she is dying from cancer."

        "Bill: What are you talking about? Look at the jaw line on this kid. He is all Spencer. Look at that.",
        "Steffy: I don't think so. All I see is Forrester.",
        "Bill: Look harder.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, well, he's a handsome boy with incredible genes from both sides of the family. And he's a perfect blend of his mommy and his daddy.",
        "Bill: Speaking of which, where is daddy?",
        "Caroline: At work.",
        "Steffy: Spectra.",
        "Caroline: I still can't believe that.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, none of us are happy about it.",
        "Bill: He isn't just pushing polyester with the enemy. He's playing house with little orphan sally.",
        "Caroline: I kind of feel like it's my fault.",
        "Steffy: You? Why?",
        "Caroline: I should have made more of an effort to reunite my family. But I didn't. I ran off to new York without Thomas, and then now that I'm back in L.A., He's in the arms of sally spectra.",
        "Thomas: Mm, okay, okay. We keep doing this, and -- and we are going to get nothing done.",
        "Sally: Well, I'm just looking for more inspiration.",
        "Thomas: Oh. I'm your inspiration, am I?",
        "Sally: You're my everything. Mm! Okay, all right. Pump the brakes.",
        "Thomas: Come on.",
        "Sally: Pump the brakes! No! We have to be good. We have to be good. We have to -- we have to focus on work.",
        "Thomas: Okay. You're right. You're right. You need to stop distracting me, though. That's the problem.",
        "Sally: You're right. You're right. Eyes on the prize.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm. Monaco, Spencer summit, all of it just around the corner.",
        "Sally: Mm-hmm. Our debut on the world stage.",
        "Thomas: Ooh, spectra fashions versus Forrester creations.",
        "Sally: We have bikinis, we have swim trunks, we have sun dresses, and a killer showstopper.",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Sally: I think we're gonna win this sucker.",
        "Thomas: There is no doubt in my mind that we are going to kill it.",
        "Wyatt: I am loving what I'm seeing. It's elegant, provocative. I'm telling you, dad is gonna be very impressed.",
        "Zende: Good. That's the idea.",
        "Ivy: Look, Forrester is destined to make a historic impact at the Spencer summit. We're gonna beat the pants off spectra.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, we are. I don't doubt that you will.",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Brooke: You've been spending a lot of time here lately, Wyatt.",
        "Nicole: Aww. He misses us.",
        "Katie: Aww.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, I enjoyed almost every moment working with most of you. I'm kidding, I'm kidding! No, I'm doing my own thing at Spencer publications now.",
        "R.J.: And Katie's doing awesome at your old job.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "R.J.: It's like you never even existed.",
        "Katie: Aww, he doesn't mean it.",
        "Wyatt: I can see that, all right?",
        "Coco: Are you jealous she's filling your shoes so well?",
        "Wyatt: No, of course not. I-I always knew she was gonna do a wonderful job.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Thank you very much.",
        "Brooke: Zende, these designs are beautiful.",
        "Zende: Thank you, all of you, really. It was a collective effort of the entire design team. I am just happy to be a part of it.",
        "Nicole: And I can't wait to do my thing on the runway.",
        "Katie: Ohh!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Ivy: Whoo!",
        "R.J.: Mom, you're modeling, too, right?",
        "Brooke: As a matter of fact, I am.",
        "R.J.: Well, keeping with the swimsuit theme, I was thinking of having a pool party since coco and I aren't invited to Monaco.",
        "Nicole: Hey, where's Quinn and ridge? I thought they'd be here.",
        "Brooke: Uh, I think they're working from home today.",
        "Katie: Well, it doesn't matter. Uh, we are making great progress, and I think we are only days away from the spectra showdown.",
        "Wyatt: And I hate to be biased, but I think you guys got this.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: I think we're looking at a Forrester victory hands down.",
        "Katie: That's right!",
        "[Cheering]",
        "Katie: They can't touch us!",
        "Wyatt: Definitely!",
        "Shirley: Hmm. How about we add a few feathers and a cluster of rhinestones?",
        "Sally: We're featuring swimwear, grams.",
        "Shirley: I know.",
        "Thomas: We are trying to keep it classic and chic and simple.",
        "Darlita: Competing with Forrester is challenging.",
        "Saul: And we all know that Forrester equals boring.",
        "Shirley: You are heading to Europe! You've got to spice it up! Add a splash to everything!",
        "Thomas: Oh, don't worry. We will. And I cannot wait to compete with my sister and our entire family.",
        "Caroline: Staying on the east coast was a mistake.",
        "Bill: No regrets. You needed to be with your moms.",
        "Caroline: Hey, I just didn't know what I wanted. And I didn't know what was best for him yet, either, but now I do. I want my family together, and I want to be with Thomas.",
        "Bill: And you will be. It'll happen. I promised you I'd do everything I could to help you, and I meant it.",
        "Caroline: Thank you, both of you, for your support.",
        "Steffy: We love you, and we want things to work out.",
        "Caroline: Me, too. All right, come on, baby. Let's let uncle bill get back to work so he can make us some money.",
        "Bill: Yeah, hey. Don't be a stranger, okay? 'Cause if you are, I'll disinherit you.",
        "Caroline: Ha ha. That's very funny.",
        "Bill: I'm not joking.",
        "Caroline: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: Oh, wait, do you need -- do you need help with all this stuff downstairs?",
        "Caroline: I'm okay.",

        "Caroline: Yes, I promise.",
        "Steffy: Bye!",
        "Caroline: Bye! [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: That settles it. Kicking sally out of that building and your brother's life.",
        "Katie: So I reached out to Eva, and she's gonna handle some pre-publicity on their end.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, great. Yeah. Oh, have her set up that interview with the prince before the whole shindig.",
        "Katie: Already done.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, nice.",
        "Charlotte: Wait, the prince. Like, the prince?",
        "Nicole: Forrester's fancy like that, charlotte. Didn't you know?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Charlotte: That is so cool!",
        "R.J.: And I am done. I'm gonna take a break.",
        "Coco: No, you don't. No, here. Um, you can file these.",
        "R.J.: No.",
        "Coco: Go for it.",
        "R.J.: Fine, all right. Okay?",
        "Ivy: So, Zende, your first showing as a designer. You excited? You nervous?",
        "Nicole: He's very modest.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nicole: He's really excited. And so are rick and Maya. This is gonna be a very special trip.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, wait till you see the hotel.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Brooke: I'm so impressed with you, Katie.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: The swimwear, Monaco -- this was all your idea.",
        "Katie: Well, um, thank you, but I-I had a little help.",
        "Brooke: You've done a lot in a short period of time. You must be drowning yourself in work.",
        "Katie: It's busy, but I'm enjoying it.",
        "Brooke: It can't all be about your job, you know. You need to do other things sometimes.",
        "Katie: Uh, is -- is this about a love life, Brooke?",
        "Brooke: Are you seeing anybody special these days?",
        "Katie: Um... hmm.",
        "Shirley: Sally girl, this is going to be a memorable trip.",
        "Saul: And I booked your hotel rooms, so that's one for you and one for --",
        "Darlita: Rooms? Saul, I'm pretty sure Thomas and sally are gonna want to stay together.",
        "Thomas: She's right. I had somebody book our suite already. Thank you, though, for doing that. I appreciate it.",
        "Darlita: See?",
        "Shirley: Sally girl, I hope you're brushing up on your Monaco.",
        "Sally: My what?",
        "Shirley: The language. You're going to a foreign country. You've got to be able to say a few words, you know, by the pool ordering a stiff drink. \"Excuse-moi, wait-or.\" That kind of thing.",
        "Thomas: They, um -- well, they mostly speak French and English, actually.",
        "Sally: Yeah. Look, don't worry, grams. I think we'll get by.",
        "Shirley: Okay.",
        "Thomas: Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on, hold on. What is that? This is frayed.",
        "Saul: No.",
        "Thomas: No, it's frayed right there. Look at that. Guys, we can't have this. Every inch of every piece of fabric has to be flawless. If we're gonna compete with Forrester at their own game, we have to bring our \"a\" game. Do you understand? Look, fabric has to be high quality. Our designs have to be perfect. Presentation is paramount. We cannot be going with this mediocre quality stuff anymore.",
        "Saul: I didn't realize that we were.",
        "Thomas: This is spectra's comeback to prove to the world that we are worthy of being on that runway, to show them that spectra is here to stay.",
        "Shirley: Oh! That was wonderful! Yes, we're gonna do it.",
        "Sally: Yes.",
        "Shirley: It's gonna be spectacular.",
        "Steffy: I'll never understand what Thomas sees in sally.",
        "Bill: She's like a termite, the worst kind of destructive pest. She needs to be fumigated.",
        "Steffy: Tell me how you really feel.",
        "Bill: I want that building demolished, and I want sally gone!",
        "Steffy: Easier said than done.",
        "Bill: Have I ever failed at anything in life?",
        "Steffy: I'm afraid sally's here to stay.",
        "Bill: Well, that's the wrong attitude, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Think about it. He's dating sally. He's the only investor at spectra. They're running the company together.",
        "Bill: She's no good for him.",
        "Steffy: Preaching to the choir.",
        "Bill: And she's no good for me, either.",
        "Steffy: Oh, right. Yeah, your, uh, beloved, uh, skyscraper.",
        "Bill: And my beloved niece. How is Caroline supposed to put her family back together with sally hanging around? A family, a company, money all in jeopardy because of that red-headed wannabe. And she's leeching on to my summit, putting my reputation at risk!",
        "Steffy: Not to mention riding Forrester's coattails all the way to Monte Carlo.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and Thomas is all too happy to be one of the clowns in the traveling circus.",
        "Steffy: I don't know what's gotten into Thomas. It's like he's turned into one of them overnight.",
        "Bill: We have to get rid of sally before the summit. We need a plan, a way to drive sally and Thomas apart.",
        "Katie: You should really take a look at these numbers when you get a chance.",
        "Wyatt: How are things going over here?",
        "Brooke: Oh, good. I've got to mail some parcels with R.J.",
        "Katie: All right, thanks.",
        "Wyatt: So things are shaping up.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Yeah, we're making some headway.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. You're really good at this, Katie, almost too good.",
        "Katie: Well, again, I-I can't take all of the credit. You came up with the initial idea.",
        "Wyatt: We did it together. And, you know, I really enjoyed working with you on everything. You okay?",
        "Steffy: I didn't realize how hard this has been on Caroline, how much she wants her family.",
        "Bill: Thomas needs to step up. He's way too swept up in that ginger.",
        "Steffy: He likes that sally needs him.",
        "Bill: She's desperate and broke! What's attractive about that?",
        "Steffy: He likes to be the hero, the -- the rescuer. He thinks that he rescued sally.",
        "Bill: Right, right. He wants to be the woman's knight in shining armor, ride up, save the day. Like your father learned the hard way, there's only one stallion.",
        "Steffy: One what?",
        "Bill: Nothing. Look, sally's the kind of woman that eats chumps like Thomas for breakfast. She'll use him to elevate her status, get her company's footing back on track, and then she'll kick him to the curb. He'll be miserable!",
        "Steffy: I know Thomas. I know he's stubborn, and he's fully committed to sally.",
        "Bill: W-w-what are you doing? We're brainstorming! You can't just leave!",
        "Steffy: I have to go to work. We got to get ready for Monaco.",
        "Bill: Okay, fine! Go! Just, you know, look pretty and leave it to me!",
        "Steffy: Okay, I will try to send sally back to the circus, but don't count on it.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "[Dialing]",
        "[Ringing]",
        "Bill: It's Bill.",
        "Thomas: Oh, I know. We have nothing left to talk about.",
        "Bill: Look, Thomas, I'm sorry, okay? I-I know I came at you pretty hard, but th-this really is important. Would you please come by my office?",
        "Thomas: No, no, I can't right now. I'm in the middle of making an entire collection for Monaco.",
        "Bill: I'm begging you, Thomas. Please.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] Fine. Fine. I'll be there.",
        "Sally: You have to leave?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Bill Spencer wants to see me.",
        "Sally: Well, I can guess what that's about.",
        "Thomas: Don't worry. There is nothing that bill can do or say that will ever come between us.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: Did something happen? You and Brooke get into a disagreement or something?",
        "Katie: No, no. Um, I just -- you know, it's just been busy.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I-I have really enjoyed working with you on all this.",
        "Katie: Yeah, same here. It's been stressful, but I can handle it.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. You want to take a break, have a coffee or...?",
        "Katie: No, I, uh, I'm just gonna finish this up and head out. What?",
        "Wyatt: Nothing.",
        "Katie: Do I have something in my teeth or something? Why are you looking at me like that? Did Brooke not tell me that I had something --",
        "Wyatt: You're fine. You're fine.",
        "Katie: Well, then why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: Pam is showing Douglas off all around the building.",
        "Steffy: I can't believe how much he's grown since Christmas. It's crazy.",
        "Caroline: It's insane.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: He has outgrown all of his clothes. He's definitely gonna be tall and handsome like his daddy.",
        "Steffy: Well, hopefully he's a lot smarter than Thomas has been these days. I'm sorry, Caroline. I just wish you'd come home months ago.",
        "Caroline: I actually might have had a chance.",
        "Steffy: I know you two could be so happy together.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Steffy: I just can't get through to Thomas. I wish I could, but I can't.",
        "Bill: Thomas. Uh, come on in. I-I appreciate you coming by.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure I already know what this is about.",
        "Bill: Look, uh, I would be lying if I said that I couldn't wrap my head around why you would get involved with a con artist like sally.",
        "Thomas: There it is. I'm gone.",
        "Bill: Thomas, come on. I mean, look, give me -- give me a break. You abandon your sister, Forrester, you've aligned yourself with this woman.",
        "Thomas: Okay, look, bill, I've heard enough of all these complaints that you have about sally. You don't like her.",
        "Bill: But you haven't heard it all. There's something more, something you don't know.",
        "Thomas: Look, bill, if this is about Caroline and my son, you have to stop questioning my commitment to them. She left me, and I will never abandon my son. That's it.",
        "Bill: Well, in the meantime, you're here cavorting around with sally spectra.",
        "Thomas: Oh, god, this was a mistake.",
        "Bill: Just -- just hear... just hear me out, Thomas. I know you didn't have the best role model in ridge. And I'll admit, I mean, you know, I was the playboy's playboy back in the day. But I've evolved. I've learned that there is a proper way to conduct yourself with a woman. I have learned the responsibility with family. But it's more than that. There's something I discovered recently, something that Caroline doesn't want anyone to know.",
        "Thomas: What are you talking about?",
        "Bill: You know that my niece means the world to me. She's a Spencer. She is my sister's only daughter. And I look out for my own.",
        "Thomas: I get it. You will always help Caroline.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I will always do that. But, uh, I-I can't help her.",
        "Thomas: What do you mean?",
        "Bill: Caroline told me something. She didn't want you to know. But given that you are the father of her son, I felt you had a right.",
        "Thomas: Bill, what are you saying? What -- what -- what are you even talking about?",
        "Bill: It's Caroline. She's dying, Thomas."
