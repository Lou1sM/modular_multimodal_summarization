        "Thorne: They did a good job --\r\nwould you give me a minute, please? ",
        "Thorne: You said you'd never leave\r\nme. ",
        "Felicia: Hey -- ",
        "Thorne: Hey -- ",
        "Felicia: Where's Alexandria? ",
        "Thorne: Why would I want her here?\r\nHow can I explain to my daughter what I don't understand myself? That someone\r\njust mowed her mother down like a dog, and had more important things to do than\r\nto stop. ",
        "Eric: The police are working on it,\r\nall right? They're going to track him down. ",
        "Thorne: Oh, he'd better hope so --\r\nbecause if I find him first, then God help us both. ",
        "",
        "Hector: Taylor, Phoebe and I are\r\naccessories. Her story was in the paper. I lied in my report, my sworn\r\nstatement to the police. ",
        "Taylor: You really think a little\r\nmore guilt is going to keep me in line? ",
        "Phoebe: Mom, if you go to jail, I\r\ndon't care what happens to me. ",
        "Taylor: You know, Hector, you\r\nreally have to stop putting phoebe in the middle of this, okay? My\r\nbrother-in-law had maybe the only perfect marriage I've ever known. And my\r\nlittle niece, she only knew the world through her mother. This isn't a legal\r\nissue to me, you know? I can't be worrying about whether or not I'm a criminal.\r\nI'm somebody who loves those two people, and they have a right to know why they\r\nwill never see that beautiful woman again. Phoebe, you're driving. Fine, I'll\r\ntake a cab. ",
        "Hector: Do you think my heart\r\ndoesn't go out to that family? But I see no sense in destroying another one. Do\r\nyou? ",
        "Taylor: I'm going. With or without\r\nyou. ",
        "Stephanie: I wasn't sure if you\r\nwere going to come. ",
        "Taylor: Oh, yes, Stephanie. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, you've been so\r\nangry with me -- with everybody, I mean -- but family's family, isn't it? ",
        "Taylor: And right is right. ",
        "Thorne: I owe you an apology. ",
        "Taylor: Oh, Thorne -- ",
        "Thorne: That first morning that you\r\nshowed up at the house, I was half out of my head, and I was awful to you. \r\n",
        "Taylor: Oh, please, no -- ",
        "Thorne: But the truth is, Taylor,\r\nif you hadn't shown up, I would've lost it. I would've busted up the place -- I\r\ndon't know. I found Alexandria's video, and I couldn't help myself, so -- it\r\nwas Darla looking so -- ",
        "Taylor: So -- so beautiful. ",
        "Thorne: Yeah. ",
        "Taylor: And so loving you. ",
        "Minister: Let us pray. O God, whose\r\nmercies cannot be numbered, accept our prayers on behalf of your servant, Darla.\r\nGrant her an entrance into the land of light and joy, in the fellowship of your\r\nsaints, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. ",
        "All: Amen. ",
        "Ridge: If I wasn't Darla's least\r\nfavorite person in the world, I should've been. I didn't think she was smart\r\nenough or strong enough to travel with our pack. The weirdest thing about all\r\nthis was that I knew I was wrong. I was jealous -- jealous of what she and my\r\nbrother had. Of her devotion to him -- of how happy they were -- they just made\r\nit seem so easy. ",
        "Stephanie: Sometimes in life, we\r\nare fortunate enough to meet the real thing. It's someone who is genuinely kind\r\nand generous in spirit, who just shines with goodness and love. One day, god\r\nsmiled -- and my son, Thorne, was fortunate enough to meet Darla. Thorne's wife\r\ncompleted him in every way -- spiritual and carnal -- completed him with their\r\nchild, and began their child's journey down the path of life. She's gone,\r\nhoney, but just for a short while. She waits. She watches over you and Alexandria.\r\nHonor her -- her love for you -- by living the rest of your life with joy. She\r\nwould want you to do that. She was the real thing. ",
        "Sally: My name is Sally Spectra,\r\nand I am a selfish old broad, and you might as well know that. I ask myself how\r\nI can be thinking about myself at a time like this? But I am. I'm thinking of\r\nmyself and my beautiful girls. My daughter Macy, my precious Darla, and they're\r\nboth gone. And I will never see their sweet smiles again. Oh, Lord -- what on\r\nearth were you thinking? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ",
        "Minister: Is there anyone else? ",
        "Taylor: It's so strange now -- it\r\nhorrifies me in a way I can't even begin to describe that Darla's gone from us\r\n-- I know that Darla loved me. She even came -- and she said that to me the\r\nnight before she died. At a time when I needed to hear those words the most,\r\nshe was the one person who came to me and she said that to me. But didn't she\r\ndo that for all of us? She made us feel good about ourselves. She always lifted\r\nour spirits when we were feeling down. She had the best sense of humor. She\r\nmade us realize that we have special qualities that are worth living for, even\r\nwhen we feel like there isn't any hope left. She never judged anyone. She just\r\nloved without expecting anything in return. That's the reason she died, because\r\nshe was helping my daughter when she was feeling afraid and she was alone. And\r\nwhen I hold myself up in the light, I'm ashamed. Now I know what my task is --\r\nto be the woman she saw in me. ",
        "Thorne: Thank you for that. Thank\r\nall of you, for your words today. And I want to thank you for your love and\r\nyour support, but I especially want to thank you for reminding me today that my\r\nwife -- in her own quiet way -- was -- was very special. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. \r\n",
        "Stephanie: Come on, honey. It's\r\nokay. ",
        "Minister: \"Into your hands, o Lord,\r\nwe commend your servant Darla. May her soul, and the souls of the departed,\r\nwith God's mercy, rest in peace.\" ",
        "All: Amen. ",
        "",
        "Hector: Hey, I've got to get back\r\nto the station. You'll take care of your mom? ",
        "Phoebe: Lieutenant Baker wouldn't\r\nstop looking at us. ",
        "Taylor: Let him look. It's his job.\r\n",
        "Ridge: Hey. Are you all right? I've\r\nbeen worried about you, your drinking. ",
        "Taylor: I've got a handle on it.\r\nReally, I do. ",
        "Ridge: Okay, good. We haven't had a\r\nlot of time to spend as a family recently. I thought maybe we could do\r\nsomething this afternoon. ",
        "Taylor: Okay. ",
        "Ridge: You wouldn't mind? ",
        "Taylor: No, I think that would be\r\ngood. Why don't you go ahead and take the kids with you now, though? ",
        "Ridge: Okay. Come on, kids. ",
        "Phoebe: Mom, I can't go with dad, I\r\nhave to drive you home! ",
        "Taylor: Just let me wait 'til\r\neverybody else leaves. I need to take a cab, okay? ",
        "",
        "Lt. Baker: Nice service. ",
        "Taylor: Yeah, it was good of you to\r\ncome. ",
        "Lt. Baker: I was hoping to have\r\nanother talk with your daughter. ",
        "Taylor: Oh, I'm afraid she's all\r\nready gone home. ",
        "Lt. Baker: Another time, then. Sad\r\n-- tragic, really. ",
        "",
        "Thorne: You're still here? Can I\r\nask you something? It's Alexandria -- my daughter -- ",
        "Taylor: Yeah? ",
        "Thorne: I haven't told her yet. She\r\nstill thinks that mommy is sick and that she's going to come home from the\r\nhospital, and -- I just can't seem to look in her little face -- ",
        "Taylor: You just can't find the\r\nwords. ",
        "Thorne: Yeah. ",
        "Taylor: The most important thing\r\nyou -- have to tell her or anyone -- and you just don't know how. ",
        "Thorne: Yeah. Will you help me? I\r\nmean, I know I don't have the right to ask, but -- Taylor, will you come home\r\nwith me and sit with her and help me make her understand? ",
        "Taylor: Whatever you need. Yes,\r\nI'll do that. ",
        "Thorne: Now? ",
        "Taylor: Now -- and for the rest of\r\nmy life. Anything -- I mean that, anything. ",
        "Thorne: Okay.  "
