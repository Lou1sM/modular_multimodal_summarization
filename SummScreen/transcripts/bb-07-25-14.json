{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["At Ridge's repeated urgings, Bill finally admits that yeah you bet he did it. Ridge got what was coming to him. Ridge cheap-shot him and drug off his bride and nobody does that to him and gets away with it, so he had Justin dump him. Now he wants Ridge to land this chopper. Brooke keeps defending Bill that they were getting married, so there is no way he could have planned an accident for Ridge. Katie says she isn't sure they can still call it an accident. When Wyatt shows Ivy the big blue diamond, she says she thought it was on loan and they returned it. Wyatt says yes but when Ricardo recently died he gifted it to Wyatt. She asks what he is going to do with it and he replies let it work its magic. Wyatt has to quickly close his fist with the diamond when Liam comes back in and tells Wyatt good job at the meeting today and it's obvious he is excited to be back at work. Wyatt says that is a huge understatement. Liam asks if he has any specific plans. Wyatt says just strictly business but he always has something in the works. And then he segues way that he needs to go show Hope this latest piece. Hope asks Deacon why he came by. He says just to check up on her and to ask about Liam. She says he's fine. It's kind of cute seeing him hobble around. She thanks him for telling Wyatt what Quinn was up to. He says anything to help and he wants them to see he is trying to change. Maybe her mom will see that someday too. Hope says no offense but she doesn't think her mom wants anything to do with him. She says he is her father and Brooke knows she wants a relationship with her dad but it's hard to even think that she would change her mind about him. Deacon shares that Bill is not the man she thinks he is. Hope says obviously she is not a huge fan of Bill's but he has proven himself with her mom. Deacon says yes, he's proven himself to be a jerk. Deacon has been one too but at least he knows his limitations. Bill thinks he can do anything and up until now he has. But Brooke is gonna find out very shortly exactly what he is capable of.", "Brooke is still trying to convince Katie that Bill had nothing to do with Ridge's accident when Bill comes back home. She quickly says she is not even ready yet; he came back too soon. They are still going to get married? Ridge answers he is not sure. Brooke tells him if he is still accusing Bill then he can turn around and go back home. He had a terrible accident but Bill had nothing to do with it. She saw it happen and it was one of the worst days of her life. But Bill did not orchestrate it and what Ridge is saying would be attempted murder and he would not do that. She orders Ridge to keep this to himself. She wants no more interruptions. All four of them now need to come together for the kids. She tells Bill again that she is not ready. Ridge says that is on him. He didn't let Bill get to Catalina. Bill finally speaks up and says Ridge had him hijacked. After Wyatt leaves, Ivy makes small talk with Liam and even convinces him that her mum would love to know them all better so would he mind being in her video. He acts goofy but complies. She mentions both Wyatt and Liam being in the tabloids over Hope. She knows Hope is with him now and that's good. She thinks he is a really nice guy and Hope's love life is none of her concern. She is here to work and that is what she is going to do. Deacon tells Hope that she has that whole blonde mother/daughter executive thing going on .something he never accomplished at her age. She reminds him that he owned a club or something. He says yeah that's right so maybe they are alike. She inspires young girls to live a life of meaning and he owned a club and inspired young women to other things. Hope asks if he still has a thing for her mom. He lets her in on a little secret .any guy who has been with Brooke Logan still has a little thing for her. And it used to be if your name wasn't Ridge, then why bother as you were destined for second place but now Ridge is with Katie. She reminds him that Brooke is with Bill. Deacon says he knows but he doesn't see that lasting. He admits he's been working on a little something to help her mom out so they'll have to wait and see. Wyatt comes in but says he can come back. Deacon says it is okay, he was just leaving anyway. He tells Hope that maybe her mother will appreciate his efforts and with time and a little understanding she will see that he has changed and cut him some slack so you never know what the future might hold. Wyatt and Hope go outside on the Rooftop as she has some jewels of Ivy's that she wants to see in the natural light. He thanks her again for this second chance. She says he has a lot to live up to like topping whisking her away to Mexico and coming home with the HFTF diamond. He says that was the beginning of a great adventure for them and with success it can happen again. And he did make a promise. She says she remembers, he was going to give it to her and she is holding him to that. Slyly he says he has something that she needs to see in the natural light. It's not for the line but something for her. Something that he only imagined her owning since he saw it. He opens his fist and presents the diamond. She gasps and puts her hands to her face. He said he told her that he would not break his promise. Ricardo gave it to him and now he is giving it to her. She says she does not know what to say. Ridge tells Brooke what he told Bill, that poetry wasn't the only thing he learned in Paris. Both Katie and Brooke guess that it was he that was flying Bill's helicopter and brought him down. Brooke says she is sure Bill will want to press charges, but don't. Ridge is confused and they need to help him. Bill says he is not pressing charges. Katie wants to hear the details. Ridge says he remembers seeing Justin's face and the SP logo. He was not imagining that. The helicopter had been on the back of Bill's yacht. He saw him and Brooke climb into the helicopter and he gave orders to Justin to dump him. Brooke says damn it, Bill needs to defend himself. Bill says nothing to defend. It was his helicopter; Justin was the pilot and he had him dump Ridge in the water. In shock, Brooke says no he wouldn't do that. Ridge almost died and they were all worried about him. Bill says he knows but Ridge interrupted their wedding. He drug her away. Bill was angry and he didn't have time to think. He just knew he had to get her back with him. It was just an impulse. He told Justin to cool him off. He never thought he'd get hurt. He could swim or Justin could go back and get him. He never thought in a million years that he'd go missing. And when he was found, Bill was relieved as he had been living in fear. Bill says he was afraid. Ridge had cheap-shot him in the face while they were getting married and nobody does that to him and gets away with it. He wants Brooke to say something. Tell him that she understands."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["[Alarm beeping]", "Bill: Yeah, you bet I did it. You got what was coming to you. I had Justin dump you from my helicopter. You think you can break up my wedding? Cheap-shot me, drag off my bride? No. Nobody does that to me and gets away with it. Now land my chopper!", "Brooke: Oh, Katie, why are you so sure about what Ridge is saying?", "Katie: I wasn't at first.", "Brooke: And now?", "Katie: I have my suspicions. There are a lot of things that Bill needs to explain.", "Brooke: Like what? It's ridiculous. We were in the middle of getting married on the beach. There's no way Bill could have arranged that accident.", "Katie: I'm not so sure we can call it an accident anymore.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: I thought this was only on loan. It was no longer part of the line.", "Wyatt: Well, yeah, we had to return it.", "Ivy: But...?", "Wyatt: But... Ricardo Montemayor willed it to me.", "Ivy: This is yours now?", "Wyatt: Yeah. [Chuckles]", "Ivy: What're you gonna do with it?", "Wyatt: I'm gonna let it work its magic.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Look at that -- working hard already.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: Like mother, like daughter.", "Hope: Hey. Um, what?", "Deacon: Oh, I'm sorry. I just meant the whole beautiful blond fashion-exec thing you have going on here.", "Hope: Oh.", "Deacon: You know, I got to tell you something. I never accomplished anything like you have when I was your age.", "Hope: What are you talking about? Didn't you -- didn't you own a club or something?", "Deacon: [Chuckles] Yeah. Uh, I did. Hey, you know, maybe you do take after me. I mean, there are certain similarities. You know, you have your own fashion line, and I owned a bar, and you inspire women to live a life of meaning, and I inspired young women to other things.", "[Both laugh]", "Deacon: You even have the same giggle she has.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: I didn't mean to interrupt. Just want to say good job at the meeting today. It's very obvious you're excited to be back.", "Wyatt: Yeah. That is a huge understatement.", "Liam: Yeah, well, you made it sound like you got some big plans. Anything specific or...?", "Wyatt: You know me. Always got something in the works. Business, Liam. Strictly business.", "Liam: I -- I would not have thought any different.", "Wyatt: Speaking of business, uh, I have to go show hope that piece we were talking about.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Yeah. You know what? I think she's really gonna like it, hmm.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Hmm.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: So, what brings you by?", "Deacon: Just wanted to check up on you, make sure you're okay. Hope that's all right.", "Hope: Yeah, of course.", "Deacon: So, how's Liam doing?", "Hope: He's good. He's really good. It's, um... it's kind of cute, actually, watching him hobble around in the boot he has to wear. Thank you, again. If you hadn't told Wyatt what Quinn was up to...", "Deacon: Just glad I could help. I really am. I'm just... just doing what I can to change.", "Hope: Yeah, I can see that.", "Deacon: Maybe your mom will, too, someday.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: I know you want to be there for Ridge and support him, but feeding into his delusions is not going to help.", "Katie: Explain to me where Justin was in all of this?", "Brooke: I don't know.", "Katie: So it's not impossible that Bill might have arranged for Justin to pick you up in the helicopter after the ceremony was over.", "Brooke: Katie, if there was a helicopter there to pick us up, I would've known about it.", "Katie: How would you have known? You didn't know about any of this. Bill arranged it all.", "Brooke: Oh, great. You're back. That was quick. I'm not even ready to go yet. You okay? Was there a problem with the site? We are getting married today, aren't we?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Mm, I don't know. Bill?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You settling in?", "Ivy: Slowly. It's really intimidating, but I'm up for the challenge.", "Liam: Yeah. Man, I got to hand it to you. I don't know if I could move so far away from home on a moment's notice.", "Ivy: Yeah, well, my mum's been in pretty good contact with me. It's actually hard to remember that we're not on the same continent anymore.", "Liam: Ah.", "Ivy: She's just so excited. She wants me to update her all the time. I'm shooting this video thing for her so she can see what everything looks like.", "Liam: Oh, okay. That's cool.", "Ivy: Actually, would you mind if...", "Liam: What?", "Ivy: Uh...nothing. Don't worry about it.", "Liam: Oh, my God. You want me to be in your video.", "Ivy: Yeah. Would you mind? I know she'd get a real kick out of it.", "Liam: Yeah, sure. No problem. Um, where do you want...?", "Ivy: Well, why don't you go behind the desk?", "Liam: Behind the desk. Okay.", "Ivy: Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. Hi, Mom. As you can see, we're no longer in the sewing room. We are up here in the executive suite, and you'll never know who you might bump into.", "Liam: Hello, Mum!", "Ivy: Aw, thanks.", "Liam: Yeah.", "Ivy: Yeah, she'll love it.", "Liam: It was good.", "Ivy: Oh, it's still recording. It's still recording.", "Liam: Turn it off! Good God!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: I hate to say this, but I don't think that my mom really wants anything to do with you.", "Deacon: No. I know.", "Hope: You are my father, and she knows that I want to have some kind of relationship with you, but it's hard for me to picture her ever changing her mind about you. Especially romantically. You know that Bill and my mom are together, right?", "Deacon: You know, Bill is not the man that your mother thinks he is.", "Hope: Look, I am not a huge fan of his, obviously, but he's proven himself to her.", "Deacon: \"Proven\"? Proven as what? As a jerk? I mean, I'm a jerk, too, admittedly. But at least I know my limitations. I mean, this guy's incredible. I mean, he just -- he thinks he can do anything. And up until now, he has. That's gonna change. Because Brooke is gonna very shortly realize exactly what he's capable of.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Ridge, what're you doing? Were you harassing Bill out there?", "Ridge: No, not at all.", "Brooke: If you're here to accuse him, you can turn around and just go home. We know that you had a horrible accident. It was a terrible ordeal.", "Ridge: Orchestrated by this guy.", "Brooke: Look, listen to me. I was there. I saw it happen, and it was one of the worst days of my life. But you grabbed me, and we went down the beach, and Bill was following. He had no chance to call a helicopter and organize that. See, physically it was just impossible. And emotionally, you're saying it was attempted murder? That Bill is a killer? Katie, you know that's impossible. Bill loves me. We've been trying to get married for a while now. Why would he want to hurt the father of my child? That makes no sense.", "Ridge: It kind of does. 'Cause he thought he was gonna get away with it.", "Brooke: Okay. You know what? You can have these thoughts, but keep them in your head. I don't want to hear any more accusations. Bill and I are getting married today...", "Ridge: I don't know about that.", "Brooke: ...And I don't want to hear anymore interruptions. It would be good of you to just put this behind you. It'd be good for you, good for Katie. All four of us need to come together, and we need to be there for the kids -- for will and for R.J. So, is the wedding set? I still have to get ready 'cause you ended up doing all that so fast.", "Ridge: Well, that's on me. He never made it to Catalina.", "Brooke: You never went to the site?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I was going to. The plans changed when Ridge hijacked my helicopter.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Thank you.", "Liam: Yeah, no problem. So, your mom really, like, knows who I am?", "Ivy: Oh, yeah. Yeah, you and Wyatt always make the tabloids back home. \"Who will hope choose?\"", "Liam: Oh, yeah. Well, asked and answered.", "Ivy: So, is it true? The relationship is really over even though they're gonna keep working together?", "Liam: You heard the man. Business only.", "Ivy: Mm. Yeah, it's just those Logans, though...", "Liam: What?", "Ivy: Well, they just have such a complicated relationship with my family. Seeing hope and Brooke and the men who fight over them, it's just -- it's kind of weird being in it.", "Liam: Well, you're not -- you're not in it, though. Yeah, there have definitely been some obstacles along the way. Wyatt was a problem. But not anymore. You know, hope's committed to me now, so...", "Ivy: Yeah. Well, that's good. I'm glad to hear it. You seem like a really nice guy. Besides, I guess it's really none of my business. I mean, I am here to work, and that's what I'm gonna do. Hope's love life really isn't my concern.", "Liam: Well, you are here to work, but, uh, there's -- there's something else, too.", "Ivy: Oh. Yes?", "Liam: Well, you know that video for your mom?", "Ivy: Mm-hmm.", "Liam: Not gonna make itself. Chop-chop! Let's go! Come on!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Can I just come out and ask you something?", "Deacon: Sure, honey. Anything.", "Hope: Do you still have a thing for my mom?", "Deacon: I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Any guy that's ever been with Brooke Logan still has a little thing for her.", "Hope: Okay.", "Deacon: Hey, look, it used to be, if your name wasn't \"Ridge,\" why bother, 'cause you're just destined to wind up in second place, but... Ridge is with Katie now.", "Hope: And my mom is with Bill.", "Deacon: Yeah, like I said, I just -- I don't really see that lasting.", "Hope: Okay. What do you know that I don't?", "Deacon: I've been working on a little something, trying to help your mom out. I don't know. You'll learn soon enough.", "Hope: Okay. Does this have anything to do with Ridge's accident?", "Deacon: I don't think I should say any more. Your mother will fill you in.", "Hope: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: Look, I --", "Wyatt: Oh.", "Deacon: Hey.", "Wyatt: Are you guys in the middle of something? 'Cause I can always come back.", "Deacon: No, it's okay. I'm just leaving. Look, I'm not delusional, all right? I'm well aware of your mother's hatred, okay? I just think she's gonna appreciate my efforts. And maybe with a little time, a little understanding, she's gonna see that I'm starting to change and cut me some slack. Who knows what the future holds?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Hijacked? What do you mean?", "Ridge: Well, like I told Spencer, poetry's not the only thing I studied when I was in Paris.", "Katie: Wait a second. Seriously? You were --", "Ridge: Yeah, I was flying the chopper, just like Justin. Thought that was a good way to get a confession out of him.", "Katie: [Sighs]", "Brooke: So you actually kidnapped him?", "Ridge: Ah, come on.", "Brooke: Okay. I know you're gonna want to press charges, but don't. He's just a little confused right now, and we have to help him.", "Bill: I'm not pressing charges.", "Brooke: Thank you.", "Katie: Okay. Why don't you just tell me exactly what happened?", "Ridge: Well, I took the great Spencer on a ride in the helicopter, and he forgot to put his seat belt on. Kind of what happened to me when Justin was flying the Spencer helicopter in Abu Dhabi.", "Brooke: The helicopter wasn't there.", "Ridge: Yes, it was. It was on the yacht.", "Brooke: It was?", "Ridge: And Justin was waiting to pick you up after the ceremony.", "Brooke: No.", "Ridge: Yes. I saw his face. And I saw the Spencer logo. I wasn't imagining that. And he saw us climb into the helicopter. I put a seat belt on you, but I couldn't get one on me. He knew that. So he gave Justin the order.", "Brooke: Bill, what are you doing? Say something. Tell him it's not true.", "Ridge: So, today, I took him for a ride in the helicopter so he knows what it feels like.", "Brooke: Damn it, defend yourself.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Nothing to defend. It was my helicopter. Justin was the pilot. And I ordered him to dump him in the water.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Uh, so what was all that about with your dad?", "Hope: I have no idea, but I'm going to try very hard to stay out of it.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Hope: Oh. I'm sorry. Have you seen this?", "Wyatt: Oh, is that Ivy's?", "Hope: Yeah. I wanted to see it in natural light.", "Wyatt: Yeah, it's beautiful.", "Hope: Mm-hmm.", "Wyatt: She understands the Forrester style.", "Hope: Well, she ought to. She's a Forrester herself. And with you by her side, we're gonna have quite a jewelry team.", "Wyatt: Yeah. Thanks again for giving me another chance here at the company and working with you guys. There's a lot of excitement ahead.", "Hope: Yeah. You know, you're gonna have a lot to live up to.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Hope: How will you ever top whisking me away to Mexico and coming home with the Hope for the Future diamond?", "Wyatt: What? That was just the beginning of a great adventure for us. With our success, we'll do it again.", "Hope: Yes, we will. Maybe not with the diamond, but...", "Wyatt: Well, I did make a promise to you.", "Hope: That you were gonna give me that diamond.", "Wyatt: Ah. Lady remembers.", "Hope: Of course I do. I'm holding you to it.", "Wyatt: You know, I've got something that we should take a look at in natural light.", "Hope: Is it something for the line?", "Wyatt: No. Something I was thinking for you. Ever since the moment I saw it, I only imagined that you would be the one owning it.", "Hope: [Gasps] Wyatt!", "Wyatt: I told you that I won't break a promise.", "Hope: How -- why do you -- what -- how --", "Wyatt: Well, Ricardo gave it to me, and now I'm giving it to you.", "Hope: Oh!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: [Gasps] Wyatt, I -- I -- I don't know what to say.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Knocks on door]", "Deacon: Hope?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: No.", "Bill: It's true.", "Brooke: You wouldn't.", "Bill: I did.", "Brooke: He almost died, Bill.", "Bill: I know. I know.", "Brooke: We were all so worried about him.", "Bill: I never intended him any harm.", "Brooke: Then why?", "Bill: You know why. You were there. He interrupted our wedding. He drags you away? I was angry. I didn't have time to think. I just knew I had to stop him and get you back to me.", "Brooke: I can't believe this.", "Bill: It was an impulse. I told Justin to cool him off. I never thought he would get hurt.", "Brooke: What did you expect?", "Bill: That he knew how to swim. There'd be a splash like jumping off a high dive. Justin would bring you back to me and go fish him out of the water, or by that point, he would've already made it ashore. I never in a million years thought he would go missing. And when he was found, I was so relieved. I had been living in fear.", "Brooke: You?", "Bill: I was afraid. I was afraid of what it would mean to everyone. So when he came back, then I knew everyone would be okay -- that we would be okay. I just meant to teach him a lesson. He cheap-shots me in the face as we're about to say our \"I dos.\" Now, nobody is gonna do that to me and get away with it. Nobody. Say something.", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "Bill: Brooke, say something. Tell me that you understand."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMuXIzivEKA"}
