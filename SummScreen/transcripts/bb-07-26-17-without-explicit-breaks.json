    "Recap": [
        "Ridge demands that Steffy tell him where Eric is with Sheila. She is dangerous. She's a criminal with a past. Steffy says he will flee if she tells. Eric tells Sheila that he misses his son but he is not ready to see any of the family yet. And he will not believe anything they say as they only confessed when they were caught. Caroline is livid that Bill told Thomas that she was dying. She rants that she will not go along with this. Sally catches Thomas at a bad time while he is thinking about the possibility of Caroline dying. Sally wants to flash a few new sunglasses at him that she can wear in Monaco. She says she is all packed and Saul will not let her out of his sight. She wonders if he could stow away in the cargo hole. She laments that Bill seems to be coming around and that is a good thing. Thomas says yes, he is not out to get them after all. And Sally will always be his priority. She says no matter what happens she can handle it with him at her side. Caroline tells Bill that she did not ask him to lie for her. Bill says it will be okay as he told Thomas that she did not want anyone to know. Thomas understands that he needs to be with his son, that is his responsibility. She says she does want Thomas in her life but she does not want to win him back this way.",
        "Steffy confesses that she only grazed Sheila but she thought she was going for a gun and she shot her. Now Sheila is covering for her and did not call the police. Ridge understands - Sheila wants Steffy on her side. He says they need to talk to Eric sooner rather than later. Finally she says okay, she will tell him. Sheila thanks Eric for his generosity and trust and giving her another chance. She is happy to be here with him to help him work through this. She just wants to make sure he is all right even if he doubts her motives. Steffy tells Ridge not to run over there now. She gave her word to Eric. He tells her to go to Monaco and tell Brooke and Katie everything will be fine. Sally tells her grams that she cannot believe that Bill is letting them ride on his plane, especially when he is trying to get Caroline and Thomas back together. Grams warns her to keep her eyes open and her guard up. Sally says she is not worried; Caroline is only the mother of his son and part of his past. Caroline declares again that she is not going to do this. Thomas walks in and she stutters that she knows Bill told him something that she did not want him to share. Thomas cuts her off and goes to her and says he is so sorry. He says he wants to be there for her and spend as much time as he can with her and Douglas. Bill praises him for stepping up to be the kind of father the little boy needs but reminds him that she does not want this to happen out of pity. Thomas says it is not. He was miserable and buried himself in his work but he is going to be there for her now. Family comes first. He is sorry how this happened. He hugs her. Eric says he cannot imagine what Quinn and Ridge was saying when they were alone behind his back. Heck he even invited Ridge to practically stay under the same roof. Sheila says he must put that out of his mind. Ridge knocks on the door and announces who he is and that Eric must open the door."

        "Ridge: You know where my father is. You have to tell me.",
        "Steffy: If I do, he'll disappear.",
        "Ridge: He's with Sheila!",
        "Steffy: He is, but I don't --",
        "Ridge: She is dangerous!",
        "Steffy: He doesn't want to see you, dad.",
        "Ridge: All right, I got to work this out with him. Tell me where he is. You tell me now.",
        "Sheila: I thought you turned that off.",
        "Eric: I did.",
        "Sheila: What, are you thinking of making a phone call?",
        "Eric: I miss my family.",
        "Sheila: They're probably very worried about you, Eric, I mean, if Steffy is any indication.",
        "Eric: She's the level-headed one.",
        "Sheila: [Laughs] Well, then, I hope ridge doesn't find out where you are.",
        "Eric: I don't want to see any of them. Not yet.",
        "Caroline: You told Thomas I'm dying?!",
        "Bill: When you and Douglas go back to new York, Thomas will be going with you.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my god, uncle bill! He didn't believe you.",
        "Bill: Oh, you bet he did -- hook, line, and sinker. He was very concerned.",
        "Caroline: Why would you do that?",
        "Bill: Because you asked for my help.",
        "Bill: It's Caroline. [Echoes] She's dying, Thomas.",
        "Sally: Oh! Good! You're here. Okay, so, which sunglasses are more Monte Carlo? [Laughs] If our swimwear line takes off, we could do a whole line of summer accessories. Obviously not for the summit because our hands are tied with the showdown, but next season. [Sighs] Listen to me! Next season? Just a few months ago, spectra was on life support, and now, thanks to you, our future has never been brighter. [Giggles]",
        "Sally: The collection is being packed. Saul does not want to let it out of his sight. Do you think bill would let him ride in the cargo hold?",
        "Thomas: What?",
        "Sally: Kidding! Do private jets even have cargo holds? This is so awesome. Even riding across the Atlantic with bill Spencer is exciting. By the way, you met with him. How did that go? Finalizing plans for the trip? He's not trying to throw a wrench in anything, is he?",
        "Bill: You asked for my help. I'm helping.",
        "Caroline: This is not helping. Lying, telling the father of my child that I am dying is not helping!",
        "Bill: Hey, you're yelling. Why are you yelling? There's no -- there's no need to do that. Do you want Thomas back, or don't you?",
        "Caroline: Because he wants to be with me, not because he thinks I'm sick!",
        "Bill: Well, I agree with you. He shouldn't need a reason to want to be with his family. But since he does, I gave him one.",
        "Caroline: This is wrong! I am not going along with this!",
        "Sheila: I didn't come back to L.A. to disrupt your life, Eric.",
        "Eric: Well, if it weren't for you, I'd still be in the dark, wouldn't I? Ridge and Quinn only confessed because their secret was about to come out.",
        "Sheila: Now, you don't think they would have told you on their own?",
        "Eric: I don't believe anything those two say anymore.",
        "Steffy: Granddad made me swear not to say anything, especially to you.",
        "Ridge: Steffy, we can't leave him alone with that woman.",
        "Steffy: Sheila isn't holding him hostage, dad.",
        "Ridge: She is turning him against us!",
        "Steffy: No, you did that. You and Quinn! You caused all this. I'm sorry, I -- I know you think you know what's best for granddad, but you have no idea.",
        "Ridge: She's a dangerous criminal. You know her past.",
        "Steffy: I shot her.",
        "Sally: You told me not to worry, so I'm not gonna worry. If bill seems to be coming around, then that's a good thing.",
        "Thomas: He's just looking out for his family.",
        "Sally: He's not out to get us.",
        "Thomas: No. No, it's not like that. I thought it was, but I was wrong.",
        "Sally: Well, you were looking out for me and the company.",
        "Thomas: That's been my priority.",
        "Sally: I can't tell you what it means to me. To feel so supported and encouraged. Anything that comes at us, I know I can handle it because I have you by my side. Thanks to you, I have never felt more alive.",
        "Caroline: I didn't ask you to lie for me.",
        "Bill: I told you I'd do whatever I could to help.",
        "Caroline: Thomas and I have a child together. What if he says something to Douglas or my mothers?",
        "Bill: He won't! He won't! I -- I told him you don't want anyone to know, including him, and the only reason I told him is because he's the father of your child.",
        "Caroline: Uncle bill!",
        "Bill: I was good. I mean, I was very convincing.",
        "Caroline: You can't joke about this! This is not something you joke about! His grandmother died of cancer, and when he was little, his mother --",
        "Bill: Easy. Look, I didn't pull the cancer card, all right? I went with an auto-immune disease.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my god! No! This is wrong! I am not dying, and I'm not gonna let Thomas think that I am.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm telling you, it had an impact on him.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, because he's probably terrified!",
        "Bill: Of losing you! Look, we need to get him away from sally. Thomas, he understands he has to be with his son. Now, if you're worried he's gonna leave sally out of pity, no! He told me himself he loves you. So he'll leave out of a sense of duty and responsibility. You love him, don't you?",
        "Caroline: Yes.",
        "Bill: And you want him in your life?",
        "Caroline: Yes. But not like this. I am not going to win Thomas back this way.",
        "Sheila: Look, the truth matters to you, Eric. My god, you are the most honest man I have ever known.",
        "Eric: But if I can't trust my family, who can I trust?",
        "Ridge: What do you -- what do you mean, you shot Sheila?",
        "Steffy: With grandma's gun.",
        "Ridge: Oh, my god...",
        "Steffy: Well, when I realized that granddad was with Sheila, I -- I had Liam track her down, and then Quinn said she could be armed, so I brought the gun. I -- I wasn't gonna use it, but...",
        "Ridge: It sounds like you did use it. What happened?",
        "Steffy: We were arguing. And then she went to reach for her purse, and I thought she was gonna grab her gun, and I reacted, and I... but I only grazed her.",
        "Ridge: So she's okay?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, and then the hotel security came, and...",
        "Ridge: The hotel? So they're at a hotel.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah. But Sheila, she didn't -- she didn't turn me in. She covered for me.",
        "Ridge: Covered for you? You were protecting yourself!",
        "Steffy: But she wasn't armed! If she wanted me out to the way, she could have sent me to jail!",
        "Ridge: And, what, alienate granddad? No, she wouldn't do that. She's smarter than that. What she wants right now is to have you on her side.",
        "Steffy: No. No, granddad wants to be alone because he feels that you betrayed him.",
        "Ridge: I know, and I take full responsibility for that. That's on me. That's all on me. But I got to talk to him. And I got to talk to him sooner than later because the longer we wait, the more isolated he's gonna be with Sheila. I'm not sure that you realize how dangerous that woman is. She will do anything to get what she wants. And if granddad gets hurt because of her, I'm not gonna be able to live with that. And I don't think you can do that, either.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Let's keep him safe. Tell me where he is. Tell me.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Okay, I'll tell you where to find him.",
        "Sheila: I hope you know that me being here with you was purely a coincidence. I mean, ending up on the same floor in the same hotel in the middle of los Angeles...",
        "Eric: Even harder to believe that I didn't leave after seeing you.",
        "Sheila: No, you didn't. And I really appreciate that. Your kindness, your generosity, and giving me another -- another chance, trusting me, even if it's just a little bit. [Sighs] You know, I'm -- I'm really sorry about everything that you're going through, Eric. Everything. Quinn and ridge and what they did... but I'm -- I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to be here and help you work your way through this. And I -- I know you might not think I'm sincere, and you might be questioning my motives... but they are sincere. I just want to make sure that you're all right. And if keeping your family away from you is what you need, then that's what I'm gonna do.",
        "Ridge: You did the right thing.",
        "Steffy: Wait, dad, you can't just go over there now.",
        "Ridge: Don't call him. He -- he can't know that I'm coming. I got to get him away from that woman.",
        "Steffy: What if he knows I told you where he is?",
        "Ridge: One day, he'll thank you for it.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] But I -- I gave him my word. I don't want to lose him.",
        "Ridge: You're not gonna lose him, and I'm not gonna lose him, either. I know he doesn't want to talk to me, but he will. Go to Monte Carlo.",
        "Steffy: Dad, I -- I can't go to Monte Carlo now.",
        "Ridge: You have to go to Monte Carlo, you're the C.E.O. Of the company.",
        "Steffy: What if people ask about you and granddad?",
        "Ridge: Tell them I don't look that great in a bathing suit anymore.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Tell Brooke and Katie that everything's gonna be fine. I'm gonna handle it. Okay?",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Shirley: Make sure you take plenty of pictures. [Gasps] Especially of the food! I understand that the spread that they have on private planes is better than any buffet you've ever been to.",
        "Sally: I just can't believe that bill invited us to fly with him. I guess he's given up on trying to get Thomas and Caroline back together.",
        "Bill: You want Thomas back. I'm making that a reality.",
        "Caroline: I didn't ask you to lie to him.",
        "Bill: Hey, Caroline, do you think I got where I am by accident? I'm a guy who makes things happen, and sometimes to make things happen, you got to blur the lines a little bit, push the envelope, if you want to achieve your desired goal. I did what I thought was right.",
        "Caroline: And I love you for that, but you went way too far.",
        "Bill: I fudged the truth a little bit.",
        "Caroline: You told I was dying! You told Thomas that he's about to become a single father!",
        "Bill: He has to understand what's at stake. That he needs you, Caroline, that Douglas needs his parents together, supporting each other. So I gave him a wake-up call, a jolt. So that he could come face to face with the reality of how important you are to him. And that Douglas' life and his life are better with you in it.",
        "Caroline: I agree with you on all of that, but this is not right, and I'm not going along with it.",
        "Bill: So, if Thomas tells you he's gonna come back to you, you're gonna turn him down?",
        "Caroline: I am not gonna let him think that I am dying if I am not! I'm not gonna do this!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bill: Come in. Thomas. We were just talking about you.",
        "Caroline: There's something that you need to know. I know that my uncle told you something, but I didn't know he was gonna do that.",
        "Thomas: Caroline, I am... I am sorry. I am so sorry.",
        "Eric: Well, this is certainly not a place that I expected I would end up. So much has happened in such a short amount of time.",
        "Sheila: You were happy, Eric.",
        "Eric: I was oblivious. My son and my wife are having an affair behind my back, they're just carrying on. What were they saying about me every time I left the room, or every time I turned my back? I even invited ridge to live with us practically under the same roof. I have to question everything! Every moment they were alone together, at the house or at the office.",
        "Sheila: Yes. You could. But it's not what I would recommend.",
        "Eric: What would you suggest?",
        "Sheila: You need to put them out of your mind.",
        "Ridge: Dad, I know you're in there -- open up, let me in.",
        "Shirley: Just what gives him the right to meddle in your life?",
        "Sally: Bill is Caroline's uncle.",
        "Shirley: So?",
        "Sally: So... she has a son with Thomas. Caroline wants them to be a family again.",
        "Shirley: Well, that's tough cookies. He's with you now!",
        "Sally: Yes, but Thomas is committed to his son, and I love that about Thomas. I would never do anything to get in between them.",
        "Shirley: No, you wouldn't. [Sighs] This plane trip, the Spencer summit... sally girl, you need to have a good time, but... [Sighs] Keep your eyes open and your guard up.",
        "Sally: I will, but I am not worried about Thomas. He and Caroline are parents, they love their son, but that is their only connection. She will never be a part of his life again.",
        "Caroline: I don't even -- I don't know what to say right now because I don't want you to worry about me or Douglas.",
        "Thomas: No, Caroline, look -- I -- I can help.",
        "Caroline: No, I don't need help!",
        "Thomas: I'm -- I'm not going to let you go through this alone! That's not gonna happen.",
        "Caroline: No, no, 'cause you have your whole life. You have Monaco and you have this fashion show --",
        "Thomas: No, that doesn't matter, that doesn't matter. I have to think about my son. What -- what... what are we gonna do without you? What is Douglas going to do without the most important person in his life?",
        "Caroline: You're just as important.",
        "Bill: A little boy needs his dad.",
        "Thomas: Hey, look, I -- I have wanted to be there, and I am going to be there for you and Douglas, and I am going to spend as much time with you as I can while you are still here. I want you to teach me everything.",
        "Caroline: I know that Douglas would love that.",
        "Bill: Proud of you, Thomas. The man wants to step up, be the kind of father that little boy needs.",
        "Caroline: Douglas misses you.",
        "Thomas: I've missed him. I've missed both of you. I -- and all of that, all of it is going to change.",
        "Bill: Clearly, Caroline is overcome with emotion. But I think I can speak for her in saying that she doesn't want you to do any of this out of pity, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: I'm not doing this out of pity. This is what should have happened from the beginning. It shouldn't have taken a tragedy like this to bring us together. I -- Caroline, when I left new York, I was heartbroken and I was miserable, and I buried myself in work. But I couldn't stop thinking about you and Douglas and... god, I am going to be there now. I am going to be there for our family. Family comes first. Caroline, I -- I am sorry."
