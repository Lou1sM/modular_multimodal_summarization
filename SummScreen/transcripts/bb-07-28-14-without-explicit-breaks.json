        "Bill tells Brooke that he screwed up. He should have been honest with her. He's embarrassed to say he was scared. He never meant to hurt Ridge. He never meant it to go this far. Ridge says he means he never thought he'd get caught. Bill says Ridge needed to be taught a lesson. He reacted impulsively. He tells Brooke he is sorry and promises her that nothing like this will ever happen again. He wants her to say something. She asks why did he have to do this? He says he had to punish Ridge for taking her away. He wanted him to pay. She says Ridge could have been killed and all Bill was thinking about was himself. He almost killed R.J.'s father. He argues that she knows he would never intentionally hurt the father of her son. Ridge says those are just empty, meaningless words. Brooke can not trust him, she can not forgive him and she certainly can not marry him. Ivy is outside on the Rooftop still taking video on her phone. She comes across Hope and Wyatt just as Hope hugs Wyatt for showing her the diamond. Ivy quickly puts it away and goes back inside. Hope tells Wyatt that she doesn't know what to say. She says she is sorry. She just got carried away. He says it was just a hug; they didn't break any rules. She can't believe Ricardo left him the diamond and it's really his. He says no, it's hers now to keep forever. She keeps looking and gushing at it but says it is too much. He says the diamond belongs with her. It's meant for her. It's supposed to be in their lives. It's worked wonders for them before and he thinks it will do it again. She says she would not feel right accepting this as Ricardo gave it to him. He says because he trusted that he'd know what to do with it. She reminds him that she is with Liam now. He says he knows and he is not naive enough to think this will change anything. He just thinks it feels right and as far as he is concerned it has always belonged to her. He can't keep it and wear it, just not his style. They laugh about him giving it the justice that it deserves and he says only she can do that. Aly tells Liam that she admires his confidence. Most guys would not want their girlfriend to work with their ex boyfriend. Ivy slips in and hears this. Liam says yeah well he and Wyatt have a new understanding and he's turned over a new leaf and is starting to respect Liam's relationship with her. Aly says Liam may trust Wyatt but she thinks he is more like his dad than he realizes. Liam says sure he will always be a little wary of Wyatt but it was Quinn who caused the damage and Wyatt actually defended him. Ivy asks if he is okay with him now. Liam says yeah, he does not think he will be a problem with his and Hope's relationship. And he trusts her so he is okay with their working relationship. Liam leaves and Aly tells Ivy that they have to find her a boyfriend. Ivy says she will be busy and have no time to date. But she understands Oliver is pretty nice. Aly says yes tho they went through a rough patch lately but they worked it out. Aly tells Ivy it's good to have someone around her own age. Hope is cool but always so busy. Ivy says she hasn't had much chance to get to know her either ..but very pretty and every bit a Logan. She's learned from the master; the great Brooke Logan. Aly says Hope and Brooke are very different. Ivy can't be sure, but it must be nice having two guys fighting over you like Liam and Wyatt unless she is planning to torture them just like Brooke did with Aly's dad and Uncle Ridge and Eric. There is appropriate behavior and then there is Brooke's behavior. Aly assures her that Hope is not like that. Hope is a good person. Just look at what her HFTF message says about being honest and decent and staying true to yourself. No one does that better than Hope. Ivy says she does believe in the message but she thinks maybe Aly is idealizing Hope a little too much. She's not sure she is living up to her own message. Aly wonders why she said that. Ivy says she has something to show her. She shows her the video and says she did not mean to take it. Bill tells Brooke that he was really scared but he had to come clean and he wanted her to hear it from him. Dumping Ridge in the water was the only way he could fight back; the only way he could get Brooke back. She wonders what he would have done if Ridge hadn't been found; what Bill would have done then. She knows when someone crosses him that he strikes back .hard and he doesn't care about the consequences. And that scares her. He says he deeply regrets what he has done. Katie laughs and says she wishes she could count the times that he had said that he would never do something again. She has spent years of hr life listening to his lies and manipulations and she does not want that for Brooke.",
        "As Hope is still fighting with herself about the diamond Wyatt says this is nothing compared to what she has given him. She has given him love, a job, a purpose. Just think of this as a reminder of all the great times they have had. This is what they can accomplish together. This is her diamond. No one else should have it. It is rare and unique and should belong to someone equally so. It's only right that the two most precious things he has known should be together. She says she can't accept the diamond just about the time that Liam hobbles out and asks what they are working on. Hope puts the diamond in her pocket. They manage to make light of the conversation especially when Liam tells them he's been in Ivy's video and they better watch it as she will be after them next. Her mum is a huge fan of the tabloids and the three of them. Wyatt wonder who she is rooting for, him or Liam. Hope says well she will be disappointed with the gossip when she finds out that now she is with Liam. Wyatt says and he is alone. Liam jokes that he always has his jewelry. Ridge tells Brooke to take Bill's ring off and kick him to the curb. Bill rants to Ridge to let her think for herself. Ridge says he does not want him near RJ. Bill says he does not want anything to happen to RJ and if he could change things and go back he would. Brooke says that is just it, he can not go back. He admits he made the wrong move but he will not pack up and go until Brooke tells him to. Ridge knew who he was dealing with and is not devoid of blame either. He knew there'd be payback. The difference is that Bill acted on impulse whereas Ridge planned the whole thing out. So yes he screwed up but Ridge is not exactly squeaky clean either. Ridge says he has heard enough. He does not want him near his son and Brooke does not want him here either. He tells Brooke to tell him."

        "Bill: Brooke, I screwed up. I went too far. I made an impulsive decision, and I regret it.",
        "Katie: What kind of man does something like that?",
        "Bill: I should've been honest with you. I should've told you that I was responsible for Ridge's accident. I'm embarrassed to say that I was scared. I never meant to hurt him. I never thought it would go this far.",
        "Ridge: You never thought you were gonna get caught.",
        "Bill: I never thought that you were going to get hurt. You needed to be taught a lesson. You carelessly set this thing in motion, and I reacted impulsively. Say something to me. I'm sorry. I promise you, something like this will never happen again.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs]",
        "Bill: Tell me you believe me.",
        "Brooke: Why did you have to do this? Huh? Why?",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I -- I don't know what to say. And I... sorry. I just... I got a little caught up. Sorry.",
        "Wyatt: It's just a hug. I don't think we broke any rules.",
        "Hope: This is the Hope for the Future diamond.",
        "Wyatt: I know! It's pretty incredible, right?",
        "Hope: And Ricardo -- he left it to you?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Me, of all people. [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: I can't believe this. I cannot believe that I'm holding it in my hand again!",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Hope: And it's yours? It's really yours?",
        "Wyatt: No. It's yours. It's yours to keep forever.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: I told you it'd be yours someday.",
        "Hope: It's amazing. It's really amazing, but... I'm sad, though, now. Now I'm thinking about Ricardo.",
        "Wyatt: I know. He was a good man. I'm so honored that he entrusted this diamond with me. And now I'm giving it to you.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, I'm so at a loss for words right now. Think about it. I -- I can't.",
        "Wyatt: There is nothing to think about. This -- this diamond belongs with you, okay? I want you to have it.",
        "Hope: It's too much.",
        "Wyatt: Hope, this diamond is meant for you. It's supposed to be in our lives. It worked wonders for us before, and I think that it'll do it again.",
        "Aly: I admire your confidence. Most guys wouldn't want their girlfriend working with her ex-boyfriend.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. But Wyatt and I, we've -- we've turned over a new leaf, you know? He knows that he and hope are over, and he's finally starting to respect my relationship with her.",
        "Ivy: Hey, guys.",
        "Aly: Hey. You remember Liam.",
        "Ivy: Uh, yes, yes. You helped me with my video.",
        "Liam: Yeah. How's that going, by the way?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, it's -- it's good. You never really know what you're gonna find around here.",
        "Aly: Yeah, I was just telling Liam how shocked I am that he let Wyatt come back to Forrester.",
        "Liam: Funny. I was always wondering what it's like to have a little sister.",
        "Aly: I'm just looking out for you.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Aly: You may trust Wyatt, but I think he's more like your dad than anyone realizes.",
        "Katie: You could've killed him, Bill.",
        "Bill: That was never my intention. I didn't want to hurt him.",
        "Brooke: You just wanted to punish him.",
        "Bill: Yes, I did. For taking you away from me. I wanted him to pay. But I didn't want him to get hurt. I didn't realize how dangerous it was.",
        "Brooke: You weren't thinking, Bill. You weren't thinking about anybody but yourself!",
        "Bill: I was thinking about you!",
        "Brooke: When you look at him, don't you see R.J.'S father?",
        "Bill: Come on. I would never -- you know this. I would never intentionally hurt the father of your son. Or your fianc\u00e9.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs] I'm sorry.",
        "Ridge: Those are just words, Bill. Empty, meaningless words. You can't trust him, Brooke. You can't forgive him. And you sure as hell can't marry him.",
        "Hope: I appreciate what you're trying to do -- I really do -- but I would not feel right accepting this.",
        "Wyatt: Why not?",
        "Hope: First of all, Ricardo gave it to you, not me.",
        "Wyatt: Because he trusts that I'll know what to do with it.",
        "Hope: Because he knew how much it means to you.",
        "Wyatt: And I know how much it means to you... and to us and our past and our future.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Yeah, it was a really big part of our lives.",
        "Wyatt: It brought us together.",
        "Hope: Wyatt... you know that I'm with Liam now, so...",
        "Wyatt: I know. I know. I'm not naive enough to think that this is gonna change anything.",
        "Hope: Then why are you giving it to me?",
        "Wyatt: Because it feels right. Because as far as I'm concerned, this has always belonged to you, and it always will. Look, hope, I can't keep it. What am I gonna do, wear it? It's not really my style. Okay? Actually, on second thought, I could wear it. I could make a belt buckle.",
        "Hope: I think that would look really nice, not at all tacky.",
        "Wyatt: No. Or put it on my rearview mirror, maybe, you know?",
        "Hope: Oh, good. Just treat it like an old pair of fuzzy dice. Lovely. I think your truck could use some sprucing up.",
        "Wyatt: See? This is exactly why I can't keep it or give it the justice that it possibly deserves. Only you can do that.",
        "Liam: Yeah, Wyatt's done some things in the past that'll always make me a little wary.",
        "Aly: He and his mom caused major drama for Liam and hope.",
        "Liam: But it was his mom -- it was Quinn who went too far, and actually, Wyatt defended me. He really stood up for me like a brother.",
        "Aly: Half-brother.",
        "Ivy: But you guys are cool now?",
        "Liam: Yeah, everything is great. I mean, I guess I'll always instinctually keep an eye out, but I don't think he's a problem for hope and my relationship anymore, and I totally trust hope, so I'm comfortable with their working situation. By the way, both of them very excited to be collaborating with you.",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah, me too. It's gonna be the best experience.",
        "Aly: I can't wait to see the new jewelry designs. Hope and Wyatt have been kind of hush-hush, and you'll barely show me anything, even though we're cousins and we live in the same house, which makes me think there might be some surprises.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, there'll be a surprise or two.",
        "Aly: So tell us! Come on, Ivy. Just give us a hint.",
        "Liam: Yes, a little taste of what's going on in these halls.",
        "Aly: Yeah, we won't tell hope and Wyatt. Just give us a little sneak peek.",
        "Ivy: Well, I mean, I could show you, but... I don't really think that's such a good idea.",
        "Katie: Ridge suspected it was you, but I didn't want to believe him. I do not want to believe that the father of my son could do something so reckless and unforgivable, not to mention criminal.",
        "Bill: What do you think he just did?! It was both reckless and criminal! Hijacks my helicopter, kidnaps me, he's banking the thing so I could fall out, and if I didn't hold on, I would have, and I'd be dead.",
        "Ridge: Had to scare you to come clean.",
        "Bill: You want to know what really scared me? Losing you. So I came clean, I admitted what I did so that you would hear it from me.",
        "Brooke: You gave Justin the order to dump Ridge into the water.",
        "Bill: It was the only way I could fight back -- the only way I could get you back. I thought he'd swim ashore, no problem.",
        "Brooke: But he didn't he didn't, Bill. The authorities were looking for him, the search teams, everybody. And then there was that gut-wrenching time that we had to sit around and wait. What if we didn't find him? What were you gonna do then?",
        "Bill: I never thought that way. I knew we would.",
        "Brooke: Were you ever going to tell me?",
        "Bill: I'd like some time alone with Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Why? So you can talk your way out of this?",
        "Bill: Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I don't want to believe that you're dangerous. But your temper is out of control. If somebody disrespects you or crosses you, you strike back, hard. And you don't care who you hurt or you don't care about the consequences. And that scares me.",
        "Bill: I deeply regret what I've done. And I will do everything in my power to prove to you that something like this will never happen again.",
        "Katie: Oh, my god. [Laughs] Do you know how many times I've heard those words come out of Bill's mouth? I have spent years of my life listening to his lies and manipulations. I don't want that life for you, Brooke.",
        "Aly: We need to find you a guy.",
        "Ivy: Well, as much as I would love that, I have zero time for dating right now.",
        "Aly: So make time.",
        "Ivy: You know, Oliver seems like a nice guy.",
        "Aly: He is. He's amazing. We went through something recently, but we worked it out.",
        "Ivy: All relationships, they're never easy.",
        "Aly: Yeah, I'm just now figuring that out. And Oliver's my first boyfriend, so I haven't had any experience.",
        "Ivy: Well, just be yourself. These things always find a way of working out.",
        "Aly: It's nice having someone close to my age around here. Hope's been really cool, but she's always so busy.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I haven't really got a chance to get to know her very well. She seems smart, and she's very pretty. Every bit a Logan, I guess.",
        "Aly: Why do you say that?",
        "Ivy: Well, she's learnt from the master -- her mother, the famous Brooke Logan.",
        "Aly: Hope and Brooke are very different.",
        "Ivy: Are they?",
        "Aly: You think they're alike?",
        "Ivy: Well, it's just hope and Wyatt are gonna be spending a lot of time together now.",
        "Aly: Yeah, but you heard Liam. He's fine with it.",
        "Ivy: Okay. Must be nice having two guys fighting over you. I mean, as long as she's not planning to torture them just like her mom did with your dad, uncle Eric, Ridge. Look, I'm Australian, and where I'm from, I mean, we're pretty chilled out about this stuff, but there is appropriate behavior, and then there is Brooke's behavior.",
        "Aly: True. But hope's not like that.",
        "Hope: You are making it very difficult for me to say no.",
        "Wyatt: So don't. Hope, I'm giving you a diamond, but it is nothing compared to what you've given me. You've given me love and a life and a job and a purpose. Think of this as a reminder of all the great times that we've had. This -- this is what we can accomplish together. This is the Hope for the Future diamond. It's your diamond. It would be wrong for anyone else to have this. Something this rare and magnificent needs to be owned by someone equally as unique and beautiful. It's only right. The two most precious things that I have ever known should be together.",
        "Hope: Oh. [Sighs] I can't. I can't.",
        "Wyatt: [Groans] Okay. Do it for the diamond.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Do it for Ricardo Montemayor, may he rest in peace.",
        "Hope: You are guilting me. You're guilting me into it!",
        "Wyatt: Yes, I am. I am.",
        "Hope: You're the worst.",
        "Wyatt: I am terrible.",
        "Hope: You are awful. You need to take this, I know.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Hope: Hey. Hi, babe.",
        "Liam: How's it going? What are you guys -- what are you working on?",
        "Wyatt: Uh...",
        "Aly: Hope's a good person. She has very strong morals.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I'm sure she does.",
        "Aly: I mean, look at what she stands for. The Hope for the Future message -- it's all about honesty and decency, respecting yourself, and staying true to who you are. No one does that better than hope.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Aly: What? You don't agree?",
        "Ivy: No, I agree with the message. I think that's great. But I think you're maybe idealizing hope a little bit too much.",
        "Aly: Why?",
        "Ivy: I just -- I don't think she's living up to her own message.",
        "Aly: What do you mean?",
        "Ivy: I'm gonna show you something. I didn't mean to record any of it. I was just shooting that video for my mum.",
        "Liam: Ivy's making this video for her \"mum,\" and I just made a brief appearance.",
        "Wyatt: What'd you do? A little juggling, a little soft shoe?",
        "Liam: With this leg? Are you kidding me? I said hi. All the talent I have to offer. Has she gotten to you two yet?",
        "Wyatt: Nope. I have managed to dodge that project thus far.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Be warned -- she's gonna get you on tape. By the way, apparently her mom -- huge fan of the three of us. She's a big tabloid reader.",
        "Hope: Oh, god.",
        "Wyatt: So I wonder who she's rooting for -- you or moi?",
        "Hope: Well, I think she'll be sad to hear that there really is no more gossip because I'm with Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Yep. And I -- I'm -- you know, I'm all alone.",
        "Liam: Hey, buck up, little camper. You will always have your jewelry.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, why are you still wearing that ring? Take it off and kick him out.",
        "Bill: How about you let her think for herself.",
        "Ridge: We don't want you here. I don't want you near my son.",
        "Bill: You think I'd ever do anything to harm R.J.?",
        "Ridge: I don't know where you draw the line.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on. Brooke, I would give my life to protect R.J. and you.",
        "Katie: Well, you didn't have any problem putting R.J.'s father's life in danger.",
        "Bill: If I could go back and do things differently, I would.",
        "Brooke: It's too late, Bill. You can't take it back.",
        "Ridge: You heard her -- pack up and go.",
        "Bill: I'll go when Brooke tells me to. I made the wrong move, but I flew halfway around the world to avoid something like this.",
        "Brooke: You're not blaming this on Ridge.",
        "Bill: No. But I'm not saying that he's devoid of blame, either. You knew who you were dealing with. You knew there'd be payback. The difference is, I reacted spontaneously. It was on impulse. You planned the whole thing out. You flew to Abu Dhabi, you hunted us down, broke up the wedding, dragged Brooke onto a helicopter against her will. Yeah. I screwed up. But you? You ain't exactly squeaky clean, either, pal, including what you did today.",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry for interrupting. I can't listen to this stuff anymore. No one wants you here. Go. Get out. I don't want you near my son. Brooke doesn't want you here. Tell him -- tell him it's over."
