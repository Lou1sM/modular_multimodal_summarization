    "Recap": [
        "Aly confronts Steffy and says she does not think the accident happened like Steffy says. She was responsible for what happened to Aly. Wyatt and Liam discuss how tragic this is for Thorne to lose his wife and now his only daughter. Liam says he is concerned about Steffy too. He just has to keep telling her this was not her fault. Caroline and Ridge also feel for Thorne but vow they will be there for him as a family. Thomas walks in and does not want to interrupt but sees them hugging. He too wants to be there for his Uncle Thorn and says he has decided to give up International and be back here in L.A. now. Ridge's response is lukewarm and wonders if Thomas has given this enough thought. There is not an executive position open here at FC. Thomas assures him that he is not interested in that. He wants to be part of the designing team. Caroline and Ridge exchange quick glances. Wyatt gets the feeling that Liam is saying Wyatt would hit on Steffy now that she is in these circumstances and needs their support. Liam assures him that he will be there for her .and deep down he knows Wyatt would not do that. Ivy keeps saying she saw the whole thing, but Steffy says she didn't or she would not be questioning her or saying she caused it. Ivy says there were only two people on the side of the road and now one of them is dead. Steffy reminds Ivy that this was Aly's revenge. She made the HATE board, she drove a nail in Steffy's' tire and then followed her and ran her off the road. She tried to hit her with the car and attacked her several times. All she did was try to defend herself. The guys come in and Steffy says it is just a minor disagreement. Liam takes Ivy aside and wants to talk to her and that leaves Wyatt with Steffy. It's awkward but he says he thinks Liam is dropping the bomb and breaking up with Ivy now.",
        "Ridge stammers as he tells Thomas this surprises him. Caroline even says they are well into their spring line. Thomas says he understands they are quite good but he has been working on his craft and he believes that he can contribute. He pleads his case that he thinks Eric will be on this too. Thomas reminds Ridge that he has 5% of the company and is a shareholder. Ridge runs the company so his vision will be divided so he can use another on the designing team. He will not let him down. Liam tells Steffy that he feels awful that he felt he had to do this at Aly's funeral but Ivy needed to know before they went further. He tells Steffy she is the best thing for his life and he could not be happier for his future. Ivy tells Wyatt that she kept pushing Steffy but she would not budge. But she has the video as proof. Wyatt knows she wants justice for Aly but says no one can see this video. It is too dangerous. A pop up of Aly's obituary is on Steffy's phone and she tears up and looks scared."

        "Ivy: I was there, Steffy. I saw what happened.",
        "Steffy: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Ivy: Aly's death? She didn't just fall and hit her head like you said. Aly died because of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I still can't believe Aly's just...gone.",
        "Wyatt: I know. So sad.",
        "Liam: You know who I really feel for is Thorne. I mean, can you -- can you even imagine what he's got to be going through right now?",
        "Wyatt: First he loses his wife, now his only child. It's crazy.",
        "Liam: I mean, that's two accidents. That's two tragic, horrific accidents.",
        "Wyatt: I know. This must be hard on Steffy, though. She must feel terrible.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, well, it's devastating to the whole family, but I have to keep telling Steffy, you know, it's -- it's not her fault. It's not her fault. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I can't even imagine what Thorne is going through.",
        "Ridge: He's numb.",
        "Caroline: He's never gonna see his daughter again. Could there possibly be anything worse than losing a child?",
        "Ridge: No. There's nothing. Nothing worse than that.",
        "Caroline: I just wish that there was something that we could do for him, you know? He's all alone now. He doesn't have anyone.",
        "Ridge: He has us. He has his family. Just got to help him, support him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Hey. Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Hope I'm not interrupting.",
        "Ridge: Hey. How are you?",
        "Thomas: As well as I can be, all things considered.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. We were just talking about your uncle Thorne.",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Everyone appreciated you being here. The family appreciated it.",
        "Thomas: Well, I feel horrible for uncle Thorne. And Steffy, being there that night.",
        "Caroline: I really hope she doesn't feel guilty. I mean, what happened to Aly was not her fault.",
        "Thomas: Well, yeah. And everyone knows that. It's still upsetting, though. I'm just glad I could be here for Steffy.",
        "Caroline: So, does that mean that you are thinking of sticking around?",
        "Thomas: Oh, I'm here indefinitely. I've decided to move back to Los Angeles.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Did Steffy tell you everything that happened that night?",
        "Liam: Yeah. I mean, you know, as much as she can remember.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. It's crazy how Aly just stumbled and fell and that's it. Like, her life is over.",
        "Liam: I know. It's like a freak accident.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. It appears that way.",
        "Liam: You know what really makes me sad? And I-I -- [Sighs] I hate that I'm saying this.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Liam: All of this could have been avoided if Aly didn't go nuts on Steffy. I mean, we -- we'd all be here right now, you know? We'd be celebrating the success of the fashion show, and instead, Aly's gone. She's gone, and Steffy has to live with the memories of this.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, it's probably gonna haunt her for the rest of her life.",
        "Liam: I'm telling you, man, I-I can't help but worry about Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I'm worried about her, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Ugh, just be straight with me, Steffy. I saw the whole thing.",
        "Steffy: Obviously you didn't, or you wouldn't be questioning me.",
        "Ivy: I'm not asking you anything. I know exactly what happened.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Okay. This has been an emotional last few days. You and Aly were close, and I know this is painful for you, but this is painful for all of us. She was my cousin, too. You honestly believe that I wanted this?",
        "Ivy: No, I don't think you woke up that morning wishing she would die. But that's what happened. And it was only the two of you on the side of the road.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. Wait, so, what are you implying?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: That I am responsible for what happened to Aly?",
        "Ivy: That's exactly what I'm saying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Have you thought this through, weighed the pros and cons, or...?",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] There are no cons. Me moving back to L.A. is best for everyone, okay? How can you not agree with that?",
        "Ridge: I'm not saying I don't agree. It just seems a little sudden.",
        "Thomas: Well, it's not like I just decided five minutes ago, okay? This has been on my mind for a while.",
        "Ridge: And you don't think you should have maybe told someone about it?",
        "Caroline: Okay. Your dad is just...wanting to make sure that you're making the right decision. That's all.",
        "Thomas: Well, Paris was great while it lasted. But this -- this has always been my home.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, no. This is nice.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: So, what? You're just gonna abandon your job?",
        "Thomas: Well, I'm not gonna leave them high and dry. I've got it covered.",
        "Ridge: You've got it covered. Good. Well, we don't have any executive positions for you here.",
        "Thomas: Okay. Dad, I'm not looking for an executive position. I want to join the design team.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Why would you be worried?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. Why wouldn't I be worried? Steffy's a friend. She's going through a tough time.",
        "Liam: Right, right, right, yeah. No, that's cool. That's cool of you to be concerned. I mean, for the record, Steffy does have me to lean on.",
        "Wyatt: I know. Are you seriously implying right now that I would hit on Steffy?",
        "Liam: I don't -- I don't know.",
        "Wyatt: And take advantage of this horrific situation? Seriously?",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Give me a little credit here, okay?",
        "Liam: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "Wyatt: God, what is wrong with you?",
        "Liam: I'm sorry. You'd never do that.",
        "Wyatt: Wow.",
        "Liam: I don't think you would ever do that.",
        "Wyatt: Come on.",
        "Liam: Look, this is a stressful situation for everybody. I don't know how to handle this any more than anybody else.",
        "Wyatt: I know, so why don't you put yourself in Steffy's shoes? I mean, the guilt, the culpability, the regret -- I mean, she's probably thinking a lot of things right now.",
        "Wyatt: What are you even -- what are you talking about? Nobody's blaming Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Doesn't seem that way right now. But you never know. Things might change.",
        "Liam: Wh-- why would things change?",
        "Wyatt: Because no one has gotten a chance to process the whole situation, Liam. We weren't there. You and I weren't there. They were there.",
        "Liam: Okay, all right. You're right.",
        "Wyatt: So the truth could be difficult to accept.",
        "Liam: Yes, it's absolutely tragic. We all wish it never happened, but there's one thing that I am sure about, and that is that this is not Steffy's fault. She has nothing -- nothing -- to feel guilty about.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I'm not trying to fight with you, Steffy. I'm just trying to get you to admit the truth.",
        "Steffy: Truth? The truth is, Aly went ballistic. She went crazy. I mean, you saw the photos in her closet. There was a photo Maya with an \"x\" crossed out and a nail in my head.",
        "Steffy: I'm not saying she wasn't struggling. That is not my point.",
        "Steffy: She was out for revenge. She jammed a nail in my tire so I would veer off the road. And then she tried to hit me with her car, and at the last minute, she stopped, and I -- I grabbed her out of the car, and then she tried to attack me. My God. She was ill, Ivy. And I don't -- I don't want to talk bad about her, okay? But she completely lost her sanity.",
        "Ivy: She was clearly very unwell, but that doesn't explain your role in her death.",
        "Steffy: My \"role\"?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: I was trying to defend myself. She attacked me. And then she -- she hit her head on a rock, and... and now she's dead.",
        "Ivy: What did you think would happen?",
        "Steffy: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Ivy: So, what? She just -- she fell back, and she died? How many people trip over themselves every day, Steffy, and die? She's a healthy young woman. You don't just lose your footing and then die. That's what you're saying. Is that your story? Because that's what you told police. So is that the truth? Is it not possible that your memory's just a little fuzzy, and you've distorted reality?",
        "Steffy: Okay, I realize that you don't like me, but this is an all-time low. Using Aly's death to push my buttons?",
        "Ivy: Oh, my --",
        "Steffy: No, I did nothing wrong, and I -- I don't need to defend myself to you. Oh, my...",
        "Liam: Hey. Everything okay?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, no, no, it's -- it's -- it's nothing. Um... Ivy and I were just having a little disagreement. It's -- it's...",
        "Liam: Oh. Oh. Um... all right, maybe Ivy and I should...talk.",
        "Steffy: No, no, not right -- I don't think it's a good time.",
        "Ivy: No, it's fine. It's okay.",
        "Wyatt: Um... why don't you and I just get some air?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. That's a good idea.",
        "Ivy: So what do you want to talk to me about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So you want to be a designer now?",
        "Thomas: Don't act so shocked, Dad. You know more than anyone that I've always been passionate about designing.",
        "Ridge: Until this very moment, I thought you were pretty happy being an executive.",
        "Thomas: Crunching numbers at International? Seriously?",
        "Caroline: Well, everyone says that you're so excellent at your job.",
        "Thomas: That was me taking one for the team. You know, paying my dues, learning another aspect of the business. Yeah. Which was tolerable, for a while. But it's time for something different.",
        "Ridge: Something different. You think you can just walk in here and be part of a design team? The world doesn't work that way, son.",
        "Thomas: Hmm. Let's not forget that I backed you in the takeover, okay? I might only have 5%, but technically, I'm still a shareholder. And I'm a designer. My Taboo line was a huge moneymaker.",
        "Ridge: That's long time ago.",
        "Thomas: Since then, I've been honing and fine-tuning my craft every single day.",
        "Caroline: Ridge and I are well into the Spring line.",
        "Thomas: And I've seen your work. It's pretty good. But I think you guys will be pleased with what I have to offer. So, what do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: It's kind of weird. What do you think Liam wants to discuss with Ivy?",
        "Steffy: It's not my place to say.",
        "Wyatt: No. He's dropping the bomb on her right now, isn't he? Liam is breaking up with Ivy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I don't know what to say. I don't know how to do this. Um... I care so much about you, and I want to be honorable here. You are wonderful.",
        "Ivy: Oh, my God. Are you -- are you serious-- are you doing this right now? Are you seriously doing this right now?",
        "Liam: I -- you were --",
        "Ivy: At my cousin's memorial, Liam? Can you -- can you not see the flowers and the photos? This is how you want to do this?",
        "Liam: The timing couldn't be worse, I know that.",
        "Ivy: You know what? Just say it. Just come out and say it -- you want to be with Steffy. I mean, it's not like I'm gonna be surprised. You've been honest with your feelings about her from the start, but a little part of me can't help but feel a bit betrayed.",
        "Liam: Don't blame you.",
        "Ivy: Gosh, you just -- she was just trying to get between us. Don't you see that? She was relentless. You finally gave in, huh?",
        "Liam: It's more complex than that.",
        "Ivy: Oh, come on.",
        "Liam: Steffy and I... we've finally been given another chance, and... I owe it to both of us to take it. Ivy, I'm so sorry --",
        "Ivy: Don't -- don't touch me!",
        "Liam: Okay. Okay.",
        "Ivy: I mean, what was I to you, Liam? Was I just a conquest? Something to do? Something to just fill in your time while Steffy was away? Is that it?",
        "Liam: Absolutely not, Ivy. I loved you. I loved you.",
        "Ivy: Don't do that! Don't say another word. If you want to be with Steffy, a woman with no moral center and no conscience, then good luck with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Any room for me on your team?",
        "Caroline: Well, it's something we can certainly discuss.",
        "Ridge: Does your grandfather know about this?",
        "Thomas: Dad, you're CEO now. You're calling the shots. Okay? But if I'm a betting man, I predict granddad will be thrilled. Look, you're gonna be tied up running this place. Lots of demands, people pulling on you left and right... another Forrester on the design team makes sense. Come on. I won't let you down. So, what's it gonna be? Am I in?",
        "Ridge: You're gonna have to work hard, earn your stripes like everybody else.",
        "Thomas: Wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Ridge: Fine. Let me see your stuff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I feel like such a jerk.",
        "Steffy: It had to be done. Ivy needed to know.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I mean, I -- I didn't want to string her along, and... I tried to hold off 'cause of the Aly thing, but... still, breaking up with somebody at a funeral is...",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it wasn't ideal.",
        "Liam: I could feel the tension when I walked into the room, you know? It seemed pretty clear that that's what you guys were already talking about, and I thought... she should hear it from me right now. It seemed like the respectful thing to do. [Scoffs] I was wrong. I miscalculated. She was not happy.",
        "Steffy: She was hurt. It's understandable.",
        "Liam: I know, but... it still got... pretty intense there at the end, and she was... saying some things about you and your character and -- and... you know what? It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. I know that you're the best decision for my life. And I couldn't be more optimistic about our future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: The day of my cousin's memorial Liam decides to have the talk?",
        "Wyatt: I am so sorry that he did this to you today -- especially today, of all days. What the Hell is wrong with him? You deserve better, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: I mean, I'll live, I'll survive. Aly's the one who's not here today because of Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Did she admit anything?",
        "Ivy: Mnh-mnh. I kept pushing. She wouldn't budge. She just kept lying and lying. She didn't even show an ounce of remorse for killing Aly. I mean, it's crazy! I have -- I have the video. I have the proof. God, just -- Aly was just -- she was such a good person, you know? And she was a loyal and sensitive friend. She had so much life in her. I can't... I know she got judgmental and a little withdrawn, but she was in pain.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: She was in a lot of pain. She was struggling. We all knew that. I just -- I wish I -- I should've just done more.",
        "Wyatt: No, hey. No, no, no, no, no. There is nothing more than any of us could've done for her, Ivy. We -- we had no idea how broken she'd become.",
        "Ivy: Well, it doesn't justify Steffy hitting her with a tire iron and then lying to her father and the police about it, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: I know, and I know you're hurting right now, and justice is what you want. But no one can see this video. Do you understand? It is way too dangerous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
