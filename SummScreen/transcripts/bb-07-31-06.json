{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["In the show room at Forrester's, Donna reflects on her recent conversation with Ridge where she told him she wanted to be there for him; let her be his Logan! He walks in and asks if she is excited about her big debut? He is not having second thoughts; they will make a great team. Brooke doesn't know he's changed his mind and she tells Eric that she has to convince Ridge to stay. Eric tells Stephanie and Felicia that if Brooke can't convince Ridge to stay on, this whole thing might be history. Donna apologizes to Ridge for things she might have said or the way it might have come across what happened last night. He replies that it was just what he needed. He has spent too much time licking his wounds and feeling sorry for himself. Brooke barges in on their conversation hoping to change his mind and is shocked when he tells her he already has. She picks up on some small vibes between sister and Ridge.", "Dante is still sullen with Bridget because she told him she did not want to have a baby right now and no excuse will suffice. Stephanie stops by to try to get Donna to bow out since she knows nothing about modeling. Ridge offers his support though and reveals he is continuing. Trying to sound sincere, Brooke tells all that she has no reservations of stepping down as spokesperson. She will be working from Marone's, but her heart will be here. Stephanie offers that she could just give back the stock and they will call it a clean break. Brooke relays that will never happen; Forrester is now home to her. And now it will be home to her sister as well. Dante tells Felicia he needs to speak with her, away from the reporters. Stephanie catches her though and reminds her that Dante is sleeping with her sister and she does know how possessive she can get with somebody she loves. Brooke makes the announcement to the press and they put Donna through the rigors of defending why she got the job. Ridge tells them she is the new Logan and certainly is beautiful enough, she easily qualifies. Everyone seems to be happy except Brooke who feels a little apprehensive. Felicia tells Dante that happiness should never be put off until tomorrow and Bridget is only making him wait. Brooke accosts Ridge that she has been replaced as the NuLogan. He explains it is for the company and he came up with a new slogan off the top of his head. She still maintains he is trying to get back at her. He justifies and asks what exactly does she want? Donna comes out in breathtaking white, the skimpiest of skimpy. Point taken is written all over Brooke's face."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["(Music track \"para el pueblo\", this time with good sound)", "[Donna remembering]", "Donna: I want to be there for you, ridge.

And no.", "Ridge: Okay, now just relax.", "Donna: I can'T.", "Ridge: Remember what I told you last night? You're going to be great.", "Donna: Ridge, about last night -- I'm really glad we ran into each other.", "Ridge: Me, too. If we hadn't, I wouldn't be designing the new line, would I?", "Donna: Well, you're not having second thoughts?", "Ridge: Donna, we are going to be a great team.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: So, you're okay with this?", "Brooke: Yes, I'm okay with it. It was my decision. And because it was my decision to make donna the spokesperson for the bedroom line, I think I should make the announcement.", "Eric: And the one about ridge?", "Brooke: What about ridge?", "Eric: That he's no longer going to be designing the bedroom line?", "Brooke: What?", "Eric: He didn't tell you?", "Brooke: He's backing out?", "Eric: He told stephanie last night.", "Brooke: Oh, my god. I've got to talk to him.", "Eric: Look, his mind is made up, brooke.", "Brooke: He's hurting, eric. Because it's our line. I know designing for donna is going to be different. But it can't be this way. He just can't walk out on this like this. I have to convince him to stay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bridget: I thought I'd find you here.", "Dante: What time is it?", "Bridget: It's not too late for breakfast. Or an early lunch. Croissants.", "Dante: Thanks.", "Bridget: I know it's not the greatest olive branch, but --", "Dante: Not hungry.", "Bridget: So, you're still upset?", "Dante: You said you don't want to have a baby with me.", "Bridget: Dante, I didn't mean ever, I just meant right now. Look, I know that a bag of pastries and an apology aren't going to solve our problems, but I'm here. Can we please try to work this out?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: How's it going down here?", "Stephanie: Oh, we're just about all set up.", "Felicia: You don't look very enthusiastic, daddy.", "Eric: No. Well, no offense to donna, but ridge and brooke are the bedroom line. Losing both of them could be devastating. If she cannot convince ridge to stay on, this whole thing might be history.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Donna: You're really glad you ran into me last night?", "Ridge: Yes, I am.", "Donna: Because I've been a little worried. About things I said. About the role you played in my life. I can only imagine how I came across.", "Ridge: Donna, what happened last night was exactly what I needed. I've spent far too much time licking my own wounds and feeling sorry for myself.", "Brooke: Ridge! Excuse me, donna. You can't just stop designing the bedroom line. I can understand why you would want to. Because it's our baby. But this is a critical time for the company. We need you just to stay on for a little while longer until we can find a new designer.", "Ridge: I'm not quitting, logan. I've changed my mind.", "Brooke: So, you are going to keep designing for brooke's bedroom?", "Ridge: For as long as you need me.", "Brooke: Oh, thank god. I'm so relieved. I don't think you know, but we need your expertise now more than ever. And I also don't think you heard, I hired donna to be our new spokesperson.", "Ridge: She told me last night.", "Brooke: Oh.", "Ridge: In fact, she's the reason I'm going to continue designing this line.", "Donna: I hope it wasn't a secret or anything like that --", "Brooke: Oh, well no, no. I just don't know what she said, little sister, but thank you.", "Donna: Oh no, thank you. I mean, both of you. This is an amazing opportunity for me.", "Ridge: One you're going to take full advantage of. Providing brooke and I can sell it to the press now.", "Brooke: Do you really think it will work?", "Ridge: I'm going to make sure of it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bridget: Look, I don't blame you for being angry. You said, let's not wait to get married, let's start a family, and I agreed.", "Dante: And you said that having a baby would be wonderful.", "Bridget: I really thought it would be. I wanted it to be. When I got the test results, and I found out that I wasn't pregnant. I don't know why I was just relieved. Honey, I'm just being honest and telling you how I feel.", "Dante: Well, I was disappointed.", "Bridget: I probably just need some time to think.", "Dante: How long am I supposed to wait? Huh? We've been so much already. Look what we did to felicia. I practically dumped her at the altar because we couldn't live without each other. So, if that's not how you feel about me -- you know what? There's a press conference in the showroom. I gotta go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danica: You're sure the invitation said to meet in the showroom, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sophie: The forresters have big news. They're certainly not making a lot of noise about it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jarrett: Don't worry. If brooke says it's big, it will be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Make-up artist: You look perfect.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Donna: Thank you.", "Stephanie: Hello, donna.", "Donna: Stephanie.", "Stephanie: You look beautiful.", "Donna: Just stopping by to wish me luck?", "Stephanie: No, actually I was hoping that I could talk you into bowing out.", "Donna: Quit?", "Stephanie: Donna, you are a beautiful, young woman. But you have never done any modeling. You don't know anything about it.", "Donna: Well, neither did my sister. But she's made you millions of dollars.", "Stephanie: You don't have any experience whatsoever.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: But I do. I think donna has a wonderful future.", "Stephanie: Doing what? I mean, how are you going to continue the line? How are we going to continue the line if you aren't going to design?", "Ridge: I decided to stay on.", "Stephanie: Well, that's wonderful. What happened to our conversation last night?", "Ridge: Mother, I just didn't want to produce substandard work. That's all. Donna taking brooke's place in this, it's not really an issue anymore.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: The reporters are here. And I don't want to keep them waiting. There's something I have to say.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Donna: I hope it's a pep talk.", "Ridge: Hey, just relax and enjoy the ride. I just want to tell all of you how much this line truly means to me.", "Donna: No pressure.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: And I'm leaving it in good hands. In that regard, I have no reservations stepping down as spokesperson. I really wish I didn't have to make that decision. However, I will be working from marone industries. My heart will be here with all of you.", "Stephanie: Let's not get all teary eyed. Why don't you just give us back the stock, and we will call it a clean break.", "Brooke: That will never happen, stephanie. Because in spite of your negativity, forrester creations has become a home for me. And it's going to become a home for my sister, as well.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Felicia: Hey, how are you?", "Dante: Reporters, okay.", "Felicia: You want to talk someplace else?", "Dante: Good idea.", "Stephanie: Hello, dante. Come to watch the train wreck?", "Felicia: Glad to see that you are staying positive, mother.", "Stephanie: Would you excuse us for just one moment? I want to talk to her.", "Dante: Sure.", "Stephanie: Thank you.", "Dante: You're welcome.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reporter: Mr. Damino, can we have a word?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Stephanie: What's up with you and dante?", "Felicia: He's just -- going through something.", "Stephanie: He's sleeping with your sister.", "Felicia: Since when is something like that ever been a problem in our family?", "Stephanie: I know you. When you get strong feelings for someone, you get obsessive.", "Felicia: It's fine. I'm fine. And you have way more important things to worry about.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Hello, everybody! Thank you for joining us today.", "Danica: So, um, brooke, where is everybody?", "Brooke: I'm giving you an exclusive. I'm making some changes in the direction of brooke's bedroom. But because of the recent tragedy in the forrester family, I didn't think it would be appropriate to have a huge fanfare. So, as of today, I am stepping down as the spokesperson for the bedroom line.", "Sophie: Stepping down?", "Brooke: Well, brooke's bedroom will continue to be one of forrester creation's most lucrative and most popular ventures. However, my image will no longer be used.", "Jarrett: Well, your image just made the \"brooke's bedroom or nothing at all\" campaign the most successful marketing effort in forrester history.", "Brooke: Nothing like going out on top.", "Danica: Why would you change the strategies now though? I mean, sales are through the roof.", "Brooke: Thanks to the bedroom line, forrester creations is in the middle of an incredible resurgence. That is why I need to focus my energy on my duties as ceo. So, that brings me to my second announcement. I would like to introduce to you the new face of the bedroom line. She is a very beautiful, very alluring woman. And she is going to do justice to ridge forrester's designs. My sister, donna logan.", "Jarrett: So, donna, what qualifies you to be the new spokesmodel? I mean, besides being related to the boss?", "Brooke: Donna appeals to our target market, because she is our target market, jarrett.", "Sophie: You're marketing your line to models?", "Brooke: Donna is a waitress. That is, until she got this job.", "Danica: Donna, how did you get this job?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Donna: Well, um, actually --", "Ridge: Wouldn't you rather know why she got? Out of all the beautiful women in the world, why would brooke chose her own sister?", "Jarrett: Yes, I would.", "Ridge: Because the spokesperson for brooke's bedroom can't just wear my designs. She has to embody the vision. The vision inspired by brooke logan.", "Brooke: And just like me and our customers, donna is very hard-working, very savvy woman who knows how toare of herself. Just like she knows how to take care of her mate.", "[Light laughter]", "Danica: Donna, how does it feel to step into your sister's shoes?", "Jarrett: You mean, slip into her sheets?", "[Light laughter]", "Donna: Well, it's a little overwhelming. But ridge gave me some good advice. Just relax and enjoy the ride.", "Jarrett: Is that how you're handling brooke's defection, ridge?", "Ridge: Brooke hasn't gone anywhere, jarrett.", "Jarrett: Yes, but the bedroom line has always been about you and brooke. She was your inspiration, your muse. Can you design a successful line without her?", "Ridge: My inspiration comes from beautiful women. Donna logan is definitely that.", "Sophie: What about the slogan, \"brooke's bedroom or nothing at all?\"", "Jarrett: It's not brooke's bedroom anymore.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Okay, okay. How about a new slogan, then? \"Forrester has a new logan, donna logan.\" [Applause] (Female announcer) remember the mouth-wateringtastes of the old farmstand?", "Donna: I was terrible.", "Ridge: You were not.", "Donna: The way you and brooke just stay so cool while they are firing questions at you.", "Ridge: When brooke started, she was nervous, too.", "Donna: Yeah, the way she handled jarrett. I mean, she was still talking to him when we left.", "Ridge: I think he has crush on her.", "Donna: They were all more interested in what's going on with you and brooke.", "Ridge: That's what happens when you live your whole relationship in front of the media.", "Donna: It couldn't have been easy for you to answer those questions.", "Ridge: Well, you just have to answer instead of having them speculate. Remember that. Be honest. Be yourself. And you'll knock'em dead.E all right, go put these on and let's get to work.", "Donna: I can't wait.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Felicia: Alone at last. So, tell me what happened at home when you got home last night with bridget. Did you guys figure anything out?", "Dante: I actually didn't go home. I slept in the studio.", "Felicia: You should've said something. I would have stayed.", "Dante: Look, I'm just working things out with bridget, that's all.", "Felicia: If you really thought you could work things out, you would have gone home.", "Dante: I just needed some time, that's all.", "Felicia: For what? All because yodidn't want go home reeking of guilt?", "Dante: I have nothing to feel guilty for.", "Felicia: Exactly. The only person that has any reason to feel guilty is bridget. Playing with your emotions this way.", "Dante: She's not.", "Felicia: Are you kidding me? Dante, she knows you want to start a family. She knew that the day we were set to be married. And now, she's telling you, she doesn't want to have a baby with you.", "Dante: For now.", "Felicia: Oh, then when? Since the two of you met, she's been putting you off. That's no way to live, dante. Believe me. Happiness should never wait until tomorrow.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: If you're looking for donna, she just want to change.", "Brooke: No, I'm looking for you.", "Ridge: I think she did very well on her first press conference.", "Brooke: Yeah, she did fine. Were you just trying to hurt me, ridge?", "Ridge: Hurt you? How?", "Brooke: You've got a new logan?", "Ridge: Forrester has got a new logan. The company.", "Brooke: When I was downstairs answering all these questions about your involvement with donna. Like, is she your new muse? Is she the new me?", "Ridge: She is the new you. For the ad campaign.", "Brooke: So, it's that easy to replace me?", "Ridge: What's going on here, logan? They just asked for a new slogan. I came up with the first thing that popped into my head.", "Brooke: Deep down you want to get back at me.", "Ridge: No. But I think I'd be justified if I did. Brooke, it was your decision to not model for the new bedroom line. To be away from me, from our future. I tried to do everything I could to convince you not to give up on us. But you decided to marry nick anyway. Now, I'm just trying to make the best of it.", "Brooke: You know how much brooke's bedroom means to me. How hard it was for me to give that up.", "Ridge: Do you think it was easy for me to keep going with this. Without you. I couldn't imagine designing for anyone but you, brooke. Donna finally convinced me that I could. Not to hurt you or make you jealous. Because I really love this work.", "Brooke: Yeah, well I love it, too.", "Ridge: Well, then -- god, I feel like I'm damned if i do, and damned if I don'T. Brooke, what do you want from me? Tell me. What do you want?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Donna: Are you ready for me, ridge?"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided by Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxr5Uimb9w8"}
