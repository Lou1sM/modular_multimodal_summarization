Bill sits around and mopes but tells Alison that he will not lose Brooke over this. He will do whatever it takes to get her back. Alison says Brooke without a man is like a ship without a rudder, and Bill is that rudder. She will come back to him in time. The press ask Hope what she is going to do. Wyatt says he gave it to her once, now he is giving it to her in front of the whole world. She says yes she does accept it, the audience applauds . but Liam glowers. He hears the press say romance and he walks out. Hope sees him and gives Wyatt the diamond to take over. She follows Liam. He wants to know what the hell was that? She told him she was going to give the diamond back. She begs him not to over-react on this. She was going to give it back. That was before she walked into a room full of media. Wyatt was just working the room; he's really good at that. She thought that was great in there. They need this. Liam rants that Wyatt did not give her that diamond for business. He thinks it has a hold on Hope. If it doesn't, then she needs to tell Wyatt and - she has to give it back to him right now. Wyatt tells the audience that Ricardo was a man of great class and he'd like to take a moment of silence in his memory. Aly pouts and tells both Ivy and Oliver that Wyatt is using the diamond to get Hope back. Ivy agrees it was disrespectful of Wyatt, and Liam should not put up with this. Hope keeps telling Liam this is not about Wyatt and her. This is all about publicity. Liam says she can't be that naive. She says Wyatt knows they are going to be married. He says all the more reason that it is so inappropriate. She says she is sorry. She guesses they are just seeing this differently.", "Deacon tells Brooke that he used to be like that too \u0096 fire at will and forget the consequences. But that got him in a lot of trouble and he gave it up. Now he's the model citizen. And the difference in him and Bill is that he paid his debt. Bill comes out of the cesspool and smells like cheap cologne. He has never gotten payback for what he did to Brooke, Katie or Hope. Brooke fell in love with him, Hope forgave him and Katie gave him back is company. He is the one who needs to be taught a lesson. Brooke says he is learning. Deacon says he has never seen her like this, not even with Ridge. Bill has certainly raised the bar. Brooke says yes it was a stupid, reckless act but he did not try to kill Ridge. Brooke tells Deacon that she appreciates he brought Bill to their attention. He needed to be exposed. Bill walks in and accuses Deacon of missing his parole officer, so beat it. Deacon says at least he knocked first. They are both visitors now. Bill says he wants private time with Brooke. She asks why since there are no more secrets. And if it had not been for Deacon she would still be believing Ridge was delusional and Bill did that to someone she loved. Bill tells Brooke okay fine he will say it in front of the stooge. He screwed up. He made a mistake. He's human. Deacon utters that is debatable. Brooke says what he did was also criminal and then he made it worse by lying to her about it as if he knew nothing. He says what was he supposed to do, just stand there and wave goodbye to Ridge and turn the other cheek? Deacon brings up the snapshot and Bill tells him to go to hell. He tells Brooke to please butt out Deacon or he will have to take him outside and remind him of the cellblock dates. Brooke barks they both need to shut up. Deacon is a guest in this house just as Bill is. Bill says he'd like to think he is more than a guest. They have to get past it. He lists again how far they have come and they can't let this tear them apart. They have sacrificed too much and he can't wait any longer. He wants her to marry him. Wyatt walks up outside the office so he can hear that Hope says her line needs this. No one is playing her. She will wear it for publicity only, that is it. She says other than that it means nothing. She is committed to him. He still continues how disrespectful and insulting it is to him .how the press ate it up when they tied in the romance. And make no mistake, that will be their story. Wyatt chooses then to walk in and all happy face says Hope is back in the news. Liam says yes and doing what he does best \u0096 manipulating. Wyatt says the press can not be manipulated. Liam says not the press; he is talking about Hope. Wyatt asks Hope if she feels manipulated. Liam jumps in when Wyatt says he was working the room; he was beating the drums. The press will be talking about this for six months and sales will skyrocket. Liam accuses him of working it to get Hope and his fiance should not be accepting diamonds from another man. Period! Wyatt is hitting on her because he thinks he has another chance. He needs to know if he does. Hope says no. Liam says okay then this is what needs to happen. She has to fire him and give the diamond back and this time he will accept nothing less."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["[Camera shutters clicking]", "[Indistinct conversations]", "Wyatt: I promised you the Hope for the Future diamond.

Don't worry about the consequences.", "Brooke: Yeah, it got you into a lot of trouble.", "Deacon: [Chuckles] That's why I gave it all up. Now a model citizen.", "Brooke: Right.", "Deacon: Listen, the difference between me and Bill is I paid my debt. Bill comes out of the cesspool and smells like cheap cologne.", "Brooke: That's a bit of an overstatement.", "Deacon: Oh, come on, Brooke. After what this guy did to you and Katie and hope, he has never gotten payback. I mean, think about this for a second. You fell in love with him, hope forgave him, and Katie gave him back the company. No, this guy needs to be taught a lesson.", "Brooke: Believe me -- he is learning a lesson.", "Deacon: Is he?", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "Deacon: All right, I'm sorry. Look, you don't need me to tell you how to feel.", "Brooke: No, I don't, 'cause I'm sure I'll get an earful when my daughter finds out about all of this. Hope. Are you certain what you said?", "Deacon: What -- about the diamond?", "Brooke: Yeah, the Hope for the Future diamond -- that Wyatt gave it to her?", "Deacon: Yeah. I saw it myself.", "Brooke: So what does Liam think about all of this? What do you say, hope? That diamond represents so much about you, your line. How could you not accept it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Uh, we brought the diamond back from Mexico, and, yes, it has become a symbol of everything that Hope for the Future stands for -- beauty, relevance, magnificence.

Let her know what it feels like to be without Bill Spencer. She'll come crawling back sooner or later.", "Bill: I'm not gonna play that game.", "Alison: It's not a game. It's a fact. Brooke Logan without a man is a ship without a rudder, and you're that rudder.", "Bill: Well, I'm not at the moment, but I will be. Whatever it takes, I have to get through to her.", "Alison: She'll come back, Bill. Who can give her what you have?", "Bill: Well, you're right about that. Nobody gets her like I do.", "Alison: I'm sure no one even comes close.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "Deacon: I've never seen you this way. I mean, not even over Ridge.", "Brooke: Ridge never did something like this.", "Deacon: [Scoffs] Yeah, old Bill definitely did raise the bar, didn't he?

Well, you know, the -- the diamond is unique. It's one-of-a-kind, much like the line and the message that it represents.", "Jarrett: And, of course, a diamond is symbolic of romance.", "Hope: [Chuckles nervously] Next question.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "Jarrett: Surely, you can't dismiss what it meant for you and Wyatt. A diamond is forever, right?", "Hope: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: Hey, come on. This is a press conference, not a gossip column. Come on, above the belt. Let's keep it professional. But you can't deny that it put you on the map -- both professionally and personally. We all know the story of your Mexico adventure.", "Hope: [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: Right. There's -- there's no Mexico this time, though. It -- it -- the diamond was willed to me by Ricardo Montemayor, and he put it in my trust, and now I am putting it in hope's.", "[Reporters murmuring]", "Hope: Um...handle it from here?", "Wyatt: Uh-huh.", "Hope: Thank you, everybody.", "Wyatt: Um...

Liam.", "Liam: What the hell was that?!", "Hope: It was nothing.", "Liam: You -- you told me that you were gonna give it back to him.", "Hope: And I was going to until I walked into a room full of reporters.", "Liam: Yeah, which he arranged. How do you not -- how do you not see what he's doing right now?", "Hope: He's just -- he's working the media. He's good at that.", "Liam: No, he's working you.", "Hope: Oh, please, don't -- don't overreact. You saw the response in there, and I think it's good. We need this. I mean, my line has not been the same since the diamond went back to Mexico.", "Liam: All business, huh?", "Hope: Yes.", "Liam: Not to my brother!", "Hope: He knows that we are together.", "Liam: And when has that ever stopped him, hope?", "Hope: [Sighs] Please don't do this. Please don't do this.", "Liam: What? I'm not...", "Hope: Make an issue out of something that is not an issue.", "Liam: You think that he gave you this diamond, arranged a press conference, presented it to you for the whole world to see for business? For business? No, he did it because he believes that that diamond has a hold on you, hope. Now, you tell me -- does it? Does it?", "Hope: No.", "Liam: Good. Tell him that. Give it back to him right now. praise the e", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: You don't need a man you can't trust, and you can't trust Spencer.", "Brooke: Bill would never harm me.", "Deacon: Well, look, I mean, I'll grant you -- the guy would never probably chuck you out of a chopper, but, I mean, he is playing head games with you. He already is.", "Brooke: [Scoffs] This is not helping.", "Deacon: What do you want me to say? You want me to praise the guy? You know, tell you he's a boy scout or something -- helps old ladies cross the street? He's a bad guy, Brooke. I know. I used to be one.", "Brooke: Don't. Don't bad-mouth Bill. I know Bill. I know his dark side, which is probably equivalent to your good side.", "Deacon: How do I prove to you that I've changed?", "Brooke: If you have to prove it, then it's suspect.", "[Door opens]", "Deacon: Pssh!", "Bill: Well, well, well. I'm sure you have a meeting with your parole officer, so beat it.", "Deacon: Hey, at least I knocked, Billy boy. I mean, after all, we're both visitors now.", "Bill: I need to speak with you.", "Brooke: I'm listening.", "Bill: Privately.", "Brooke: Why? There's no more secrets. Or are there?", "Bill: I made a mistake -- a big one, I admit. That's what I'd like to talk with you about.", "Deacon: So talk.", "Brooke: If deacon didn't reveal the truth, I would still think that Ridge was delusional, accusing you of dumping him into the ocean. But, you know, the biggest betrayal of all was having me believe a lie about somebody that I love. So, what did you come here to tell me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: He willed the diamond?", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Rick: What, was he, like, your godfather?", "Wyatt: No, no. No, he was -- he was just a friend.", "Maya: Can I meet some of your friends?", "Wyatt: [Chuckling] Yeah. I mean, it still blows me away. It's crazy.", "Ivy: Well, it is very generous letting hope use it for the line.", "Wyatt: Uh, well, I gave it to her.", "Ivy: A loan?", "Wyatt: No, it's hers.", "Rick: You meant that? That's not -- not one of your P.R. Stunts?", "Wyatt: Nope. No, this belongs to your sister now.", "Rick: [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "Jarrett: Wyatt, uh, a few more questions?", "Wyatt: Yeah, Jarrett. Yeah, sure.", "Ivy: Oh. [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: Excuse me.", "Jarrett: And this was big for Hope for the Future before.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Oliver: Looks like another big quarter for hope's collection.", "Aly: Yeah, seems like it.", "Oliver: What?", "Aly: It's pretty obvious Wyatt's making a move on her -- giving her a diamond -- that diamond. Subtle.", "Oliver: Quite the show.", "Ivy: Yeah, wasn't it?", "Aly: More like a performance than a press conference.", "Oliver: Aly's not a big fan of Wyatt's.", "Ivy: I've heard.", "Aly: He wasn't too obvious.", "Oliver: Aly thinks that --", "Ivy: Aly thinks that Wyatt was playing hope in front of all those reporters, giving her the diamond, and in front of Liam, no less.", "Aly: Exactly.", "Ivy: Mm.", "Oliver: Do you agree?", "Ivy: Ugh, who wouldn't?", "Aly: I felt so horrible for Liam.", "Ivy: Yeah, so did I. You know, no one should be subjected to that kind of humiliation.", "Aly: And to put hope on the spot that way...", "Ivy: It was hurtful and wrong. Liam shouldn't accept it, and hope shouldn't allow it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Liam, this isn't about Wyatt and me. This is business. This is publicity.", "Liam: Please, don't act naive with me.", "Hope: Wyatt knows that you and I are together. He knows that we're talking marriage.", "Liam: Yes, which is all the more reason it's inappropriate.", "Hope: I'm sorry. I guess we're -- we're just seeing this differently.", "Liam: Hope -- hope, you do not give an engaged woman a priceless diamond and then turn around and call it a business move. Why -- why are you not seeing that?", "Hope: But my line needs this. It gave us the biggest sales boost that we've ever seen.", "Liam: I am not talking about sales, hope. I am talking about you being played.", "Hope: No one is playing me, Liam. The diamond will be used for publicity, period. I will wear it for the media. I will put it on display in the Beverly hills boutique, and that is it. Other than that, it means nothing. I am committed to you.", "Liam: Do you not see how disrespectful this is to me?", "Hope: [Sighs]", "Liam: How insulting this is to me? Because everyone in that press conference -- they saw, and they loved it. They ate it up -- all those questions about romance, and, yeah -- yeah, you handled it, but make no mistake, hope -- that's their story. That's what they're gonna be printing and blogging and talking about tomorrow -- the romance. That's the publicity you're getting from this. You know that, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Hey. Talk about kick-start, huh? The lady is back in the spotlight. What do you think, bro?", "Liam: I think you're doing what you do best, Wyatt. You're manipulating.", "Wyatt: [Scoffs] The press and the reporters live to get manipulated.", "Liam: I am not talking about the press. I'm talking about hope.", "Wyatt: What? You feel manipulated?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: [Sighs] All right. Fine. I'll say it in front of the stooge. I came here to tell you how sorry I am.", "Brooke: You already told me that.", "Bill: I screwed up. I'm human.", "Deacon: That's debatable.", "Brooke: What you did in Abu Dhabi was criminal, and then hiding it from me -- telling Ridge that he's crazy because of his concussion?", "Bill: That was wrong. I admit that. But let's not pretend like the part that Ridge played in this whole drama doesn't count. He flies to Abu Dhabi, punches me in the face, and drags my bride away. I mean, what was I supposed to do -- just stand there and wave goodbye, turn the other cheek?", "Deacon: Now, didn't he bring something with him? What was it -- a snapshot with you and Quinn?", "Bill: Will you shut the hell -- would you please just butt out, deacon?", "Deacon: What, and just let you bully the woman? Not a chance.", "Bill: Well, then we can take it outside, and I'll remind you what it was like to be the cellblock --", "Brooke: Stop it! Please! Deacon is a guest in this house, just as you are.", "Bill: I'd like to think that I'm more than a guest. We have to get past this, Brooke.", "Deacon: I think she's doing just fine without you.", "Bill: Shut up. Think about what we've been through -- how far we've come. We can't let it go. We have sacrificed too much. I don't want to wait any longer. Tell me you'll marry me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: What is your problem?", "Liam: You.", "Wyatt: What is with this guy? I thought we were just getting along, bro.", "Liam: Yeah, Wyatt, we were. You saved my life, so I started treating you like a brother, letting you in, only to realize that you are still working it, bro. You haven't changed at all.", "Wyatt: What? Were you not in that showroom today?", "Liam: Yeah, I was there. I was there.", "Wyatt: Well, then did you see the response? Liam, we are back in the game. They'll be talking about this diamond for the next six months. That translates to sales.", "Liam: No, here's what they'll be talking about, Wyatt. They'll be talking about hope and Wyatt and, \"oh, how romantic.\"", "Hope: Only if we let them, and we won't.", "Wyatt: You saw how I handled those personal questions.", "Liam: What -- there shouldn't have been any personal questions because she's in a committed relationship with another man!", "Wyatt: Oh, you know reporters -- they'll think what they think.", "Liam: No, they think what you lead them to think, and you did a masterful job.", "Wyatt: I was working the room. I was beating the drum. That was about buzz and publicity, Liam.", "Liam: Then use it for publicity! You don't need to give her the diamond. She doesn't need to own it for your P.R. stunts, but, no -- no, you had to, didn't you? You had to ask her to accept it in front of god and everyone because what -- the power of the diamond? My fianc\u00e9e does not accept jewelry from another man, period. What -- hope, what is so unreasonable about that?", "Hope: [Sighs]", "Liam: I am asking you to see this for what it is. He is hitting on you because he believes that he still has a chance. Does he?", "Hope: No.", "Liam: Okay. Then here's what has to happen -- you fire him, and you give him the diamond back, and this time -- this time, I am not accepting anything less.", "Hope: [Sighs]"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjxRFp9QXBk"}
