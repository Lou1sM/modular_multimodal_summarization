    "Recap": [
        "Quinn tells Ridge that he is not out of touch but she wants to make more of a bold statement and what the dress would look like with her jewelry. They compromise with a few less stones while still looking good but giving the dress a chance to shine. She thanks him for giving her a chance. Thomas tells Caroline that he enjoyed hanging out with her yesterday. He wonders what she has in common with Ridge .besides the obvious that men always are intrigued by the great Ridge Forrester. She says they just get each other and are a great design team. He asks her opinion of a design he just made. If she likes it then probably his dad will too. She makes a few changes before she accepts it. He thanks her for the tip. He says he will take it over to his dad so wish him luck. She thinks he can be the third member of the design team. Brooke tells Deacon that she is not used to seeing him roam the halls of FC at will. He thinks it is funny and must drive Ridge crazy and that is worth the price of admission. Quinn spies them talking and walks up. He comments on being there with his two favorite women. Quinn can't help but mention that Brooke videoed Hope in on their wedding to try and stop it. Brooke assures her that they were only talking about Quinn and how Deacon is a happy married man now. Quinn tells her how good it is to be working and accepted by Ridge and the entire company's morale is much better now.",
        "Brooke drops by Caroline's office hoping to find Thomas. She inquires how things are going between her and Ridge and Caroline says she does not think Brooke wants to go there, but things are just fine. She anticipates it will only get better as Thomas is seeing his dad right now and may join the team. It would be great to have another father/son combination at FC. She says she loves Ridge now when Brooke mentions that when she first came to L.A. she and Thomas were a couple. Thomas sees his dad and the model hits on him. Thomas rubs it in his father's face, now they are flirting with him and not the great RF. Thomas is proud to show his dad his design. Ridge says that was awfully fast and sometimes attention to details is better than fast and go. Thomas says he thinks he can do both and this is not necessary at all as they both know what he can bring to the table, but Ridge is running the show so they will do it his way. He warns Ridge that he already showed it to Caroline and she liked it. He has his own style, different than his dad's but he thinks he will like it. Quinn tells Deacon that she hopes he got that whole message. She is really trying with Brooke but even when she is opening up and being civil she can be so cold. And Deacon runs hot so she does not see what they have together. He appreciates Quinn trying to make the effort and says she is all he wants and needs. Ridge looks at the design by Thomas and the son stands by waiting on the critique. Ridge takes it and tears it in half. Thomas is shocked. He thinks it is a joke and Ridge did that to get a reaction out of him. Ridge says no, they are on the cutting edge now and this didn't have that. They are trendsetters not followers. He must have gotten lazy in Paris. If this is the best he can do, then he'd be the last person Ridge would hire."

        "Quinn: Here is the difference between you and me. Why we don't always agree on jewelry. You're -- you're more of a couture guy, you know. You like things delicate and classy. And, well, I'm a little bit more, um, new school.",
        "Ridge: And what am I? Out of touch?",
        "Quinn: No, no, no. No, what I mean is, um, what you would see as over-the-top, uh, I would see as a bold statement. And -- and that's what this dress needs. Not that this dress is boring, per se. What are you thinking?",
        "Ridge: Is that a trick question?",
        "Quinn: You know what? Can I just show you what the dress looks like with the necklace?",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Quinn: Okay. You're tall. See?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I-I see what you mean.",
        "Quinn: Yeah?",
        "Ridge: I do. So let's do this. Let's meet in the middle. If you can take out every other stone and give this a little more room to breathe, I think we're in good shape. We have a deal.",
        "Quinn: I can do that. Okay. Um...great. Excuse me. Okay.",
        "Ridge: Just hold on a sec.",
        "Quinn: Oh, and, uh, Ridge? Thank you for hearing me out.",
        "Ridge: We're part of a team.",
        "Quinn: We are. [Chuckles] I, uh, I saw Thomas in the building. Is he driving by or is he home for good?",
        "Ridge: Well, if, uh, my son has his way, I think he's gonna be a permanent fixture.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: You know, it was nice hanging out with you yesterday. It's been too long.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I was the envy of all the models, by the way.",
        "Thomas: How so?",
        "Caroline: Because I got to watch you work out, so...",
        "Thomas: [Austrian accent] Soon one day you'll be pumping your own iron.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Thomas: [Normal voice] It was a little weird, though, you getting summoned home by my dad.",
        "Caroline: He didn't summon me. He just text me that he was on his way home.",
        "Thomas: Hmm. And you shot out of there like a cannonball. What do you two even have in common?",
        "Caroline: You'd be surprised.",
        "Thomas: Hmm. I mean, besides the obvious. Women have always been attracted to the great Ridge Forrester.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Ridge and I just get each other.",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Caroline: We're a team.",
        "Thomas: So, I impress you, chances are Dad will be impressed, too?",
        "Caroline: When it comes to design, yeah. We usually think alike.",
        "Thomas: Okay. What do you think of that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Still not used to seeing you here, wandering the halls at will.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, you know, that is actually one of the benefits of being married to Quinn. All right, now tell the truth. That has got to be driving Ridge all sorts of crazy.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] I can only imagine.",
        "Deacon: And that is definitely worth the price of admission.",
        "Brooke: And are you paying the price, being married to Quinn?",
        "Deacon: Oh, come on. You're looking at a happy man.",
        "Brooke: It's a spell, you know.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] You ain't wrong about that.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: You're not saying anything.",
        "Caroline: Give me a sec. I'm -- I'm absorbing.",
        "Thomas: You don't like it. You hate it.",
        "Caroline: No. No, stop. It's -- it's good.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] But?",
        "Caroline: But... in order for it to fit in with the California Freedom collection, which is what I'm assuming you want... it has to come in here. At the natural waist.",
        "Thomas: Okay. Yeah.",
        "Caroline: Because you have to design for every body type. Um, you know, 'cause this collection is about embracing your uniqueness and -- and -- and celebrating what makes you, you, whatever that may be. So it's all inclusive.",
        "Thomas: Okay. Awesome. Yeah. Thanks for the tip.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. Anytime.",
        "Thomas: Okay. [Sighs] Well, I might as well get started. Got to take the design over to Dad, so wish me luck.",
        "Caroline: You don't need luck.",
        "Thomas: Right. Because the design and the talent speaks for itself.",
        "Caroline: And, you know, before you know it, you'll be the third member of the Freedom Collection design team.",
        "Thomas: Awesome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: Hey.",
        "Deacon: Hey.",
        "Quinn: Hmm.",
        "Deacon: Hmm. You know, can I just take a second here and savor this moment?",
        "Quinn: Why? What's so special about it?",
        "Deacon: All right, well, the only thing missing is Hope, but you know what? I'll take it. I mean, it's a great day, I got two of my favorite women here.",
        "Quinn: Did I interrupt a personal moment?",
        "Brooke: Actually, we were just talking about you.",
        "Quinn: Oh! [Laughs] Of course, you were. Were you trying to poison Deacon against me some more?",
        "Deacon: Come on.",
        "Brooke: Have you always been this paranoid?",
        "Quinn: Uh, when it comes to you, a woman who would stoop so low as to video in Hope during our wedding to try and stop it?",
        "Deacon: Okay, look, the point is, I still married you.",
        "Brooke: According to Deacon, he's a happy man. So how could I be anything but happy for him?",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: How's that feel?",
        "Sarah: Much better.",
        "Ridge: Good. See Caroline before you go down to alterations.",
        "Sarah: Okay.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Thomas: Hey, you got a minute?",
        "Ridge: Oh, there he is. You can ask him yourself.",
        "Sarah: Ridge.",
        "Thomas: It's Sarah, isn't it? Well, don't be shy. What do you need to know?",
        "Ridge: She wants to know about your future plans --",
        "Sarah: Please stop. I can speak for myself. Thank you. But yeah. I'm curious.",
        "Thomas: Well, I'll know more after this meeting. But if you want me to give you a call sometime...",
        "Sarah: Hope to hear from you soon.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Thomas: Well, that was different.",
        "Ridge: What's that?",
        "Thomas: A model flirting with me instead of you.",
        "Ridge: Well, the son also rises.",
        "Thomas: Well, I hope that doesn't bother you, because that's exactly what's about to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I know I'm beating my head against the wall, and I guess I'm going to do it over and over and over again. [Chuckles] But I... it -- it just has to prove how much I love this man, and I want him to be happy, because I know your approval will make him happy. So, I'm gonna ask you again. Maybe today or tomorrow or early next week, you could be happy for us.",
        "Brooke: I do respect the fact that you're Deacon's wife.",
        "Quinn: Well, that's progress, so that's accepted. Yeah.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: I mean, I'm not really bad once you get to know me. You know, I haven't done anything crazy in months.",
        "Brooke: Keep up the good work.",
        "Quinn: Thanks.",
        "Deacon: Okay, so, uh, how did your meeting with Ridge go today?",
        "Quinn: Oh, that. That went surprisingly well.",
        "Brooke: Why surprising? He hasn't been nice?",
        "Quinn: No, Ridge is always his own version of nice. I mean, he's -- he's professional, if not a little bit impersonal. But today I learned that he is willing to compromise.",
        "Deacon: So then he heard you.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Yeah. We were able to figure something out that I can make work.",
        "Deacon: No, babe, that's fantastic. I mean, you know, it means he values your input, which he should because you are brilliant.",
        "Quinn: Aww. You always say that.",
        "Brooke: So, you're happy working with Ridge?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. I really am. I mean, not that I don't appreciate Rick, because he's the reason I'm here in the first place, but Ridge really brought the morale of the company back up. You know, everything is fun and creative and alive again.",
        "Brooke: Good.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, and I guess there's gonna be some new/old blood joining the design team, so...",
        "Deacon: Who's that?",
        "Quinn: Well, Thomas wants in. And I get the feeling that guy gets whatever he wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Wow. I'm surprised. You got sketches already, huh?",
        "Thomas: Well, I'm a designer, Dad. That's what I do.",
        "Ridge: Well, here's a tip. Sometimes attention to detail beats fast and furious.",
        "Thomas: Now, who's to say I didn't do both? Look, I want to get back to this, okay? I'm ready to get back to work, and there's no reason why I shouldn't. Except this dog and pony show.",
        "Ridge: That's what you think this is? Proving yourself is a dog and pony show?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. I think it's unnecessary, because we both know what I bring to the table, okay? But hey, you're running the show, so we're gonna do it your way, okay? Now, I showed Caroline the sketch. She really liked it. I think you will, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Hey, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Hey. I thought Thomas would be here.",
        "Caroline: Uh, no. He is in with Ridge, but you're welcome to wait.",
        "Brooke: Sure. Why not? Must be my day for character building.",
        "Caroline: Excuse me?",
        "Brooke: Oh, nothing. How are you?",
        "Caroline: I keep waiting for Aly to walk through that door. And it's just... still strange that... she never will again.",
        "Brooke: It's unspeakable. She was too young.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I mean, just in any instant, just to be... gone.",
        "Brooke: Other than that?",
        "Caroline: I'm doing really good.",
        "Brooke: So you and Ridge, things going well there?",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] I don't know if that's a place that you and I should go.",
        "Brooke: Well, I don't think we can really avoid it. You are a couple. Unless something has happened that I don't know about.",
        "Caroline: We're fine, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Must be lovely for you. Must seem like you're on a roll. Ridge is CEO. First fashion collection under his regime is a huge success.",
        "Caroline: And it's all about to get better, actually, 'cause I think that he is hiring Thomas as we speak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I don't think I should be judged for how long it takes me to complete a design. You haven't even looked at it yet.",
        "Ridge: Son, I'm not judging you. I just -- I'm giving you some advice. I've done this for a long time. And sometimes it pays to spend some time with the design and see what it has to tell you.",
        "Thomas: And that's how you work, okay? But I'm allowed to have my own style.",
        "Ridge: Of course, but you could benefit from my experience.",
        "Thomas: That's what I'm trying to do. You're gonna like what I've done. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Did you notice what just happened? Brooke and I actually had a moment. I think she's starting to warm up to me.",
        "Deacon: Oh, it was -- it was downright civil.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, I will take civil. I hope you got the message about all that.",
        "Deacon: What message is that?",
        "Quinn: Well, that I'm so crazy about you that I'm willing to make things work with that woman. Because even when she's warming up to me, she's still cold as ice. And you run so hot. How did the two of you even connect in the first --",
        "Deacon: Yeah, let's not --",
        "Quinn: Stop, stop, stop. Stop. I don't want to know.",
        "Deacon: You know, I just --",
        "Quinn: I don't want to know.",
        "Deacon: I want to say that you are a fantastic partner. You really are. You're the woman -- you're the woman that I never deserved, and I really appreciate you making an effort, because I know it ain't easy.",
        "Quinn: Aww. I would do anything for you.",
        "Deacon: You know that goes both ways.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] I can't believe I'm in a marriage that's actually working.",
        "Deacon: What the hell does that -- what? What? You doubted us?",
        "Quinn: No, I doubted me. I didn't think I could do the wife thing. I mean, my life has always been about my career and my son. I didn't think -- I didn't think I had any room left inside for anything else. And then I walked into a bar one night and nothing's been the same ever since.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] And here we are, happily hitched.",
        "Quinn: Are you sure that you don't...look at Brooke and secretly wish you were single?",
        "Deacon: Never. You're everything I want. And you are everything I need.",
        "Quinn: Aww.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So, Thomas is here to stay?",
        "Caroline: I think so, yeah. Um, he was kind of over corporate, and he wants to design again.",
        "Brooke: That's what Quinn was saying. So when does he start?",
        "Caroline: Well, that hasn't been determined yet. Um, Thomas is showing Ridge a design right now.",
        "Brooke: Showing? As in this is a test?",
        "Caroline: Pretty much.",
        "Brooke: But Thomas' line did so well for Forrester before. Why wouldn't Ridge just hire him again? After all, he is his son.",
        "Caroline: Well, I... [Sighs] Ridge wants him to earn it just like everyone else.",
        "Brooke: Well, that makes sense. But Thomas is very talented. I'm sure it won't be a problem.",
        "Caroline: And I'm really excited to have another Forrester on the team.",
        "Brooke: I can't help but remember. When you first came to town, you and Thomas were the couple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: It's pretty good for on the fly, huh? You might actually recognize that little trick right there. Classic Ridge Forrester with a tad more sexy.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: Okay, so what I'm going for here is a combination of both in a couple of ways. Design with the elegance that put Forrester on the map paired with something a little more sensual. And us. Moving forward in the Forrester tradition, father and son working side by side.",
        "Ridge: Really? You want to know what I think?",
        "Thomas: Yeah! Come on. Give me what you got.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Wow, uh, Thomas and me? That was [Chuckles] Such a long time ago. I mean, there's been so much growth, thank God. I mean, 'cause we were both so immature. I don't even remember that girl.",
        "Brooke: You made quite an impression on Thomas. And Rick.",
        "Caroline: Wow. Okay. Way to open a huge can of worms there, Brooke. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: You're not sorry I sent for you, are you?",
        "Caroline: No. No. Coming to LA was the best decision I could have ever made.",
        "Brooke: Well, then... you're welcome.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] Okay. Yeah. It's true that I have you to thank for all that. Um, I mean, I'm working and I'm in love and... I know that you said it was okay that I could talk to you about Ridge, but I just -- it feels weird, and I'm not so sure that it is a good idea.",
        "Brooke: Please. I don't want Ridge back.",
        "Caroline: Right. I know. Because if you did want Ridge back, you could have him back just like that.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: So, anyway... yes, I-I am in love. And -- and now Thomas is back. And Forrester has another father/son designing team, and I'm really excited at the prospect of collaborating with them. You know, and it just shows the whole world that Forrester is back to what made it so unique. Family creating together. You know, one generation to the next. It's exactly what Ridge wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: What the hell was that?",
        "Ridge: You wanted my opinion. Now you have it.",
        "Thomas: You just tore up my design!",
        "Ridge: There's no reason to keep them. They don't work.",
        "Thomas: I spent all night on this!",
        "Ridge: Spend a little more. We need cutting edge, son.",
        "Thomas: [Scoffs] This is a -- this is a joke, right? You just want to get a reaction out of me?",
        "Ridge: No, that's not what I'm doing.",
        "Thomas: This is what everybody is wearing on the streets of Paris, Milan, and New York!",
        "Ridge: I don't care what anybody's wearing on the streets today. I care about what they're gonna wear tomorrow. We're trendsetters. We're not followers. We never were. Now, part of you has got to be embarrassed by that just a little bit.",
        "Thomas: Embarrassed?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, it's -- it's terrible! You walk in here, you want to be part of this design team, and this is what you bring to validate yourself? This? Do you know how many young people there are, young visionaries who want to work with Caroline and want to work with me and learn from us? You have an edge! You worked in this business. You have experience. You had your own line. And what happened? You went to Paris and what? You just got lazy?",
        "Thomas: Oh, come on. I can't believe this.",
        "Ridge: Believe it! Look at me! You're alive. You're here. You got the world at your fingertips, and what do you want? You just -- you want a job from me, because you're my son? If you truly believe that this is the best that you can come up with, you'd be the last person I'd hire."
