        "Bill jokes with Brooke and shows her his own dollar bill with his face on it \u0096 his two favorite things. And \"In Bill we trust\". Thomas reflects on what Bill told him about Caroline dying. Zende tells Nicole that he is so nervous. There aren't many designers that are their own models. He has never done this before. Sally tells Bill that all she wants is a fair shake and no dirty tricks from him. They could win this thing fair and square. She tells Thomas that nothing can stop them now. Bill tells Steffy that he does not have a lot of respect for Thomas since he flew here for competition instead of being with Caroline. But they are going to win so get ready for the victory celebration band. Steffy says she will not cheat and do that to her brother. Lizzy runs a temperature and Maya tells Rick that she will not continue. He will have to get a replacement. Steffy conducts the charity auction using the Dollar Bill dollars. She wants them all to enjoy the fashion show challenge.",
        "Bill has a fantasy of him opening his newest Spencer Skyscraper Tower .that is until he sees Sally and then he bristles. Steffy tells Thomas this is only a charity event so everything is cool between them. The doctor tells Maya that Lizzy will be okay with rest and lots of fluids. Brooke tells Katie that she has done an incredible job even if Wyatt helped her. Sally laments to Thomas that she hopes Bill does not do anything to ruin this as Thomas deserves all the accolades. Thomas and Zende strut their stuff in swim wear too as competing designers to the delight of the audience. The show stoppers are modeled by none other than Steffy Forrester and Sally Spectra. Bill catches Thomas later and tells him he did good but now he knows what he has to do. Both Caroline, who is dying, and his son needs him. Katie introduces Bill to name the winners of the charity function. He proclaims there was no winner except him. They took in over a million dollars for charity so they are all winners. Katie rushes up to Wyatt and said they did it. He agrees and kisses her. She responds back. In fact she looks like she is ready for Round Two."

        "Bill: [Inhales deeply] [Sighs] Can you smell it?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Jasmine and the sea.",

        "[Brooke scoffs]",
        "Bill: [Inhaling] Ahh, so good.",
        "Brooke: That is not real money, bill.",
        "Bill: I always wanted my face on a dollar bill, and there it is. \"In bill we trust.\"",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] You are so silly.",
        "Bill: I'm handing them out at the event to encourage bidding. Every dollar spent goes towards Spencer charities. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: That is a good idea.",
        "Bill: Thank you. [Sighs] My two favorite things.",
        "Brooke: I hope I'm one of them.",
        "Bill: Well, that would be my three favorite things. You number one, of course. And yachts and skyscrapers. Where else do you have yachts and skyscrapers in one place but here?",
        "Brooke: I'm surprised you're not shedding a tear when you say \"skyscraper.\" I know how badly you wanted to buy the spectra property, tear it down, and build your big, beautiful Spencer skyscraper. But you know what? Thomas is a team with sally now. I don't see them crumbling any time soon.",
        "Bill: Caroline told me something. She's dying, Thomas. [Echoing] Dying. Dying. Dying.",
        "[Dance music playing]",

        "Zende: All right, well... I'm nervous.",
        "Nicole: You'll be fine once you get out there and start modeling.",
        "Zende: That's what I'm nervous about. Asking me and Thomas to walk the runway in the bathing suits? It's like... how many designers you know model their own stuff?",
        "Nicole: Only one that I see. And he's all mine.",
        "[Music, indistinct chatter]",
        "Bill: Nothing more valuable than bill money. And nothing more important to me than charities. Empty your pockets today. [Chuckles]",

        "Bill: I bet you could.",
        "Sally: I mean, I know it's old hat for Thomas, but, I mean, he could show me the ropes. Show me the dos and the don'ts of the aristocratic life.",
        "Bill: Listen, sally, I'm just trying to look out for you. I wouldn't get too used to this.",
        "Sally: Our designs are top-notch. We could win this thing. All I ask is for a fair shake. No dirty tricks.",

        "[Voicemail beeps]",
        "Caroline: Uncle bill, I'm back in new York. Um, listen, yes, I want to be with Thomas, and yes, Douglas needs him in his life, but not this way, okay? Telling Thomas that I am dying is not right, and I can't keep this up. So please just call me back.",
        "Thomas: Line it up. Perfect. Thanks.",
        "Sally: Hey.",
        "Thomas: Hey. Are you still stressed about the show? Don't be. Look, our designs can't miss. And we are gonna get tons of publicity out of this. We're on our way, bucko. Nothing can stop us now.",
        "Steffy: I miss you, too. I love you. All right. I'll call you after the fashion show. Okay. Bye.",

        "Steffy: We need to win this thing first.",
        "Bill: Done.",
        "Steffy: Whoa, no. Bill, we're doing this fair and square. I don't like that sally and Thomas jammed this down our throat, but I'm not gonna cheat. I won't do that to my brother.",
        "Bill: Your brother had a son with my niece, and he left her in new York to raise the kid by herself. I'm sorry, Steffy, but I don't have a lot of respect for Thomas.",
        "Steffy: What does that have to do with anything, bill?",
        "Bill: Everything.",

        "Rick: You need to get down there. I'll take care of Lizzy.",
        "Maya: No, I am not leaving my baby.",
