        "About as forceful as he can, Wyatt tells Liam this was a promise he made Hope a long time ago about giving her the diamond and he's only fulfilling that promise. Liam says even though he knows how Liam feels. Wyatt says it is not about his feelings at all. Liam says Wyatt made a promise to him too. He trusted him and now he pulls this. And how he even came in possession of that diamond is ridiculous. Aly and Ivy continue to gossip and Ivy says where she comes from you don't accept jewelry from one man while engaged to another. Aly convinces her to go listen in while Wyatt is talking. He just can't brainwash Hope again. Liam turns to Hope and says she is playing right into Wyatt's hand. Surely she can see that. She tells him she knows it may look that way but it's just good for Forrester. Liam says this is not about her line. This is about trust. And if she respects him then she will give Wyatt back the diamond and tell him never to walk through those doors again. He's told Wyatt about boundaries but clearly he needs to hear it from her. That yes, he is fired. Hope says this is not grounds for dismissal. Liam rants that it is beyond what is appropriate. He tells Wyatt that this diamond is what brought them together and the whole world knows that. And yet she does not see a problem with that. She tells him firmly that she is not going to fire Wyatt and she is keeping the diamond. Liam says one word \u0096 okay and storms off. Tears well up in Hope's eyes. They let Liam pass but then Aly goes into the room and storms at Wyatt that he just couldn't let this pass. He's luring Hope again with the diamond and hurting his own brother. Wyatt gets a phone call. Aly says if he needs to go somewhere she needs to talk to Hope alone. She tries to convince Hope not to let Wyatt manipulate her again. Bill tells Brooke that he made a mistake. He admits that. Deacon mocks him for groveling. Bill tells him surely there is a license plate he needs to go make. Brooke tries to quiet Deacon so she can listen to Bill. Bill says he doesn't want to say anything in front of this loser but he will as long as she hears it. He screwed up, he knows it and he learned from it. They are worth fighting for and they can't throw away what they have. It won't be easy; he's not easy but they love each other and have to get past this. He says he didn't realize how dangerous it would be for Ridge. He saw an opportunity and took it. He regrets that it hurt Brooke. Deacon says he is just hurt that he got caught. Bill tells the convict to shut up. Deacon claps his hands and says it is all show and a fake; all for Brooke. He'd throw Ridge out of a helicopter now if he thought she would not find out. He'd say anything to make her forget what he did. Bill tells mug shot to shut up. He doesn't expect her to forget just forgive and move on. She reminds him that she was in pain and yet he said nothing. He says only because he did not want to see the look on her face that she has right now. He tells her that he loves her and he hopes that is enough. She says she needs time. Deacon pipes up that she doesn't want to deal with Bill right now. Bill cups her face with both hands and says he will never give up on them. When Bill is gone Deacon asks Brooke if she is even considering going back to him as he is not going to change. If so, then consider him too. She says what they had was over a long time ago. He says he wants her back. She says she is sort of in the middle of something and she could make a list of all the things Deacon has done wrong over the years. He agrees but says he is trying to do better and be a good dad. Brooke says okay and she is not interfering. Whatever choice Hope makes about him is her own. He says he wants them to be parents. She says Hope is an adult so the time for that is past. Deacon says he never thought she would ever leave Ridge but now that she has do not go back to Bill but come to him. He surprises her with a kiss. Not sure how to respond she pulls away. Ivy follows Liam out to the Rooftop. He says he just needed some air; he feels like with this diamond he is cursed. She tells him maybe this happened for the best. At least he is not married to Hope when this happened. He says he lost his fiance and a brother and the life he wanted for himself and he walked out on them. Nothing good is coming from this. Wyatt goes to the warehouse loft and announces he is there. Quinn slowly walks out and says she was not sure he would come. He closes the door and says no way she could have been released that soon. She replies that she checked herself in. He says it hasn't been that long so don't tell him that everything is all right; She tells him to relax she is still in treatment. She says she missed him and she hopes he is glad to see her too. He says it hasn't been that long ago that she freaked out and he's supposed to believe that all is okay. She admits she had issues. And she is working on them. She knows what she did was wrong. She hates that she lost control and the danger she put Liam in. She is ashamed but she is so much better in treatment and she will never go down that dark path again. He admits that she can't. She promises she won't. With hesitation he says he believes her.",
        "Quinn wants to know if she missed anything; fill her in. Wyatt says okay; first the bad news. Ricardo died. Quinn acts surprised and asked if he was sick. Wyatt says not as far as he knows. The good news \u0096 he was in Ricardo's will and ..Quinn jumps up and says the diamond? Wyatt says yeah and he's already given it to Hope. She thinks that is fantastic even though she knows Hope is still with Liam. He tells her Liam flipped out but Hope did not give back the diamond. He says he's not sure the diamond has super powers but hey it drove Liam away. It really is priceless. Quinn remarks on all the times she tried to help Wyatt drive Liam away. When all they had to do was wait and Liam would do that all by himself by screwing up again. He told her to let that be a lesson to her. Everything always works out okay in the end. His phone rings. It is Lt. Barragan from the Mexico Police Department. Wyatt asks what is going on. Quinn can hear his part of the conversation. The Lt. asks if Wyatt knew Ricardo and if he will be in town the next few days as they would like to talk to him about the death. At first they thought it was accidental but now they are looking into murder. Hope tells Aly that Liam is over-reacting and it's not fair. Wyatt is not doing what Liam thinks he is doing. And then he just left after all this time of them working so hard to get back together. And now it feels like she is losing him. Aly begs her to not do this. Do not push Liam away. She can change her mind. Hope says she has separated her personal life from her professional one and this is all for marketing but Liam can not see that. Aly say well now she is putting her professional life before her personal one and that is just crazy. She feels like this diamond is jinxed; it's bringing Hope bad luck. Like Wyatt and his mother and if Hope makes this choice she is only going to be asking for more trouble. Liam tells Ivy that he can't believe it has come to this ..if she only knew what they have been through. She laughs and says she has in the tabloids. He says something is always getting in the way. She says Steffy. He says yeah and his dad, Wyatt, now the diamond. She agrees that is it disrespectful of Wyatt and she totally agrees with Liam about that. He wishes Hope felt that way."

        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Expecting nothing in return, knowing how I would feel about it?",
        "Wyatt: This has nothing to do with your feelings! This is about a promise I made to hope, and I wanted to keep it!",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah. Well, you made a promise to me, too, Wyatt, that you would respect my relationship. I trusted you! I trusted you, Wyatt, and you turn around and you pull this? How you even came into possession of that diamond is ridiculous. This whole thing is ridiculous. Hope, hope, he is after you, and you are playing right into his hands if you don't see that.",
        "Hope: I understand that it looks very suspicious to you, but, trust me, this is just good for Forrester.",
        "Liam: This is not about what it's worth or what it means for your line or the company. This is about trust.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: And if you respect me, you will give him back that diamond and tell him never to walk through these doors again.",
        "Aly: [Sighs] Maybe it really is just publicity.",
        "Ivy: Hope accepting the diamond?",
        "Aly: Good press, photo ops.",
        "Ivy: Things might run a little differently here in los Angeles, but where I'm from, if you're engaged to one man, you don't accept jewelry from another.",
        "Aly: Let's go listen in.",
        "Ivy: You mean eavesdrop?",
        "Aly: I just want to hear for myself how hope can justify this. She can't be brainwashed by Wyatt again.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Aly: Right?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. [Giggles]",
        "Bill: I made a mistake. I'm not denying that.",
        "Deacon: Bill Spencer groveling? Now, that is something I never thought I would hear.",
        "Bill: Don't you have to go make a license plate or something?",
        "Brooke: Deacon, please.",
        "Bill: I don't want to say this in front of this loser, but I will. I'll say it in front of anybody as long as you hear it. I screwed up. I know it. I've learned from it. We can't throw away what we have. We are worth fighting for.",
        "Bill: I know this is hard. Forgiveness isn't always easy. I'm not easy. But we love each other, and we have to get past this.",
        "Brooke: I want to [Sighs] But --",
        "Bill: Ridge was out of control, Brooke. I would have done anything to stop him. But I miscalculated it. I didn't realize how dangerous it was. I just saw an opportunity, and I took it. I regret that it hurt him, that it hurt you.",
        "Deacon: You regret that you got caught.",
        "Bill: Shut up, convict!",
        "Deacon: You know what? Bravo! You know what this is? Hey, listen, forgive him if you have to, but make no mistake about this -- it's a show. There's no remorse. It's fake. It's all for you. He would throw Ridge out of a helicopter today if he thought you wouldn't find out.",
        "Liam: Wyatt and I were supposed to have an understanding of what the boundaries are, what's appropriate, what's not appropriate. Well, clearly, I was wrong about that, and you know what that means? That means you have to put your foot down. He needs to hear it from you, not me.",
        "Hope: That he's fired?",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Hope: Liam, this gift is not grounds for dismissal.",
        "Liam: This gift is an affront to our entire relationship, and it is beyond inappropriate, hope.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, dial back the possessive-freaky-boyfriend thing you got going on here, Liam.",
        "Liam: You two bonded over this. This thing is part of what brought you both together, and the whole world knows that. And you don't see a problem with this?",
        "Hope: Liam... I'm not gonna fire Wyatt. And [Sighs] I'm keeping the diamond.",

        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: I-I didn't mean for --",
        "Aly: That's it -- you and Liam?",
        "Hope: Oh, god. You scared me.",
        "Aly: You just couldn't let them be. You had to lure her back with this diamond.",
        "Wyatt: Aly, this isn't the time.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Aly: Do you have any integrity? I mean, this is your brother you're messing with.",
        "Wyatt: Excuse me a second.",
        "Aly: Don't let him do this.",
        "Wyatt: Hello?",
        "Aly: Don't let him manipulate you again.",
        "Hope: I'm not. That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Wyatt: What? I'm so-- no. I don't know if I can.",
        "Aly: Look, if you have someplace you need to be, I need to talk to hope alone.",
        "Wyatt: Stay put. I'll be right there. If you need anything, I --",
        "Deacon: He'll say anything to you.",
        "Bill: Don't push me, mug shot.",
        "Deacon: He'll say anything to make you forget what he did.",
        "Bill: Not forget -- just forgive, move on, remember the life we'd planned.",
        "Brooke: You saw my pain. And the whole time, knowing what you did, you said nothing.",
        "Bill: Because I didn't want to see the look you're giving me right now.",
        "Brooke: I do love you.",
        "Bill: I love you. Is it enough?",
        "Deacon: Give her some time.",
        "Bill: Tell me it's enough.",
        "Brooke: It's not just something that I can get over. It's -- I just... need some time.",

        "Bill: I will never give up on us.",
        "Ivy: Liam.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Ivy: I thought you left.",
        "Liam: No. Yeah. I-I just [Chuckles] Needed some air.",
        "Ivy: You know, I can't believe what happened down there.",
        "Liam: This damn diamond, you know? I feel like I'm cursed.",

        "Aly: Okay. Well, couldn't you have? For Liam?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Liam is overreacting. He is asking too much, and it's not fair. It's not. Wyatt is not doing what Liam thinks he's doing, and he just -- [Voice breaking] He just left. I feel like we've been working so hard to be together. We've been working so hard, and now it's like... now I think I'm losing him.",
        "Liam: I just can't believe this is what it's come to.",
        "Ivy: You and hope, you mean?",
        "Liam: [Sighs] If you -- [Chuckles] If you knew what we've been through...",
        "Ivy: Don't worry. I've read all about it -- your almost weddings, runaway proposals, Italy.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. It's -- something's always getting in the way.",
        "Ivy: Steffy?",
        "Liam: Yeah, and my dad and Wyatt and now this diamond.",
        "Ivy: You do know it's totally inappropriate for her to accept it?",
        "Liam: Okay. So, I'm not being unreasonable?",
        "Ivy: No! Not at all! Accepting a gift from any man -- it's disrespectful.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I wish hope saw it that way. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: There's no way you got released that soon.",
        "Quinn: Released? I checked in voluntarily.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, it hasn't even been that long. If you're trying to tell me that everything is fine --",
        "Quinn: Relax. I'm still in treatment.",
        "Wyatt: Huh.",
        "Quinn: Hey, aren't you glad to see me?",
        "Wyatt: Of course I am.",
        "Quinn: I missed you.",
        "Wyatt: You know, it's been such a short time since you freaked out, and I'm just supposed think everything is back to normal again, huh?",
        "Quinn: I have issues, and I am working on them.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Quinn: Look, I know what I did was wrong. I regret losing control. It's horrible the danger I put Liam in.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Quinn. I'm ashamed. But I-I- really am feeling better. I mean, treatment has helped me tremendously, and I am never going down that dark path again.",
        "Wyatt: Well, you can't.",
        "Quinn: I won't. I promise.",
        "Wyatt: I believe you.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. So...Have I missed anything?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah -- a lot, actually.",
        "Quinn: Yeah? Fill me in.",
        "Wyatt: Well, first, the bad news.",
        "Quinn: The bad news?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Ricardo Montemayor died.",
        "Quinn: What? That's terrible. Was he sick?",
        "Wyatt: (Sighs) Not that I know of.",
        "Quinn: Well, what's the good news?",
        "Wyatt: I was in his will.",
        "Quinn: Really?! Wait. You don't mean -- the diamond?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. And I already gave it to hope.",
        "Quinn: Oh, my god! That is so romantic! Oh, I know she's still with Liam, but did she --",
        "Wyatt: Well, maybe she is. Maybe she isn't.",
        "Quinn: What happened?",
        "Wyatt: He went into full-on jealous mode and flipped out on her for accepting it and told her she better give it back or else.",
        "Quinn: And?",
        "Wyatt: She didn't give it back.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Wyatt...",
        "Wyatt: Look, I don't believe in the supernatural, okay? But maybe this diamond really does have powers. I mean, it drove Liam away. It really is priceless.",
        "Deacon: That guy's a jerk.",
        "Brooke: You're not helping.",
        "Deacon: Why? He's conceited. He's stubborn. What? He is.",
        "Brooke: Are you describing yourself or Bill?",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] It would seem that you have a type, wouldn't it? He's not gonna change.",
        "Brooke: Now you're gonna tell me you have.",
        "Deacon: Are you considering going back to him?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Deacon: Well, then, you ought to consider me.",
        "Brooke: Deacon --",
        "Deacon: Brooke, listen, I know this is out of right field, but most of the things I do are. I mean, if he can almost kill Ridge and still have a chance with you, don't I deserve one, too?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Deacon, what we had was over a long time ago.",
        "Deacon: And I want you back.",
        "Brooke: Uh, if you haven't noticed, I'm in the middle of...",
        "Deacon: Breaking up with Bill? That's why I'm putting this out there.",
        "Brooke: No, I never said I was breaking up with Bill.",
        "Deacon: No, but you will after what he's done.",
        "Brooke: I don't think you should talk. You want me to make a list of things you've done over the years?",
        "Deacon: Look, I've made lots of mistakes, all right? But I'm ready to move past that, and I'm ready to be a dad.",
        "Brooke: Great. I've done my job not to interfere. If hope wants to allow you into her life, that's her choice.",
        "Deacon: I mean more than a dad. I want us to be parents.",
        "Brooke: Hope is an adult. The time for that has passed.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, it's never too late to fix what should have always been. I never thought that you were gonna leave Ridge, that he'd be out of the picture, but now that he is, don't go back to Bill. Come to me.",
        "Ivy: You know, maybe this all worked out for the best.",
        "Liam: What are you talking about?",
        "Ivy: Well, if you'd already married hope, that would have been your wife out there accepting a diamond from another man. At least this way, you got to see what Wyatt really means to her. And I know that it's painful, but you might be happy to look back and see that it all turned out this way.",
        "Liam: No, no.",
        "Ivy: Well, you never know. Some good might come from this.",
        "Liam: I lost my fianc\u00e9e, my brother, the life I planned for myself. I mean, I just walked out on all of it. Trust me, Ivy -- no good is coming from this.",
        "Aly: Liam took off, and, yes, he was upset, but that doesn't necessarily mean what you're thinking.",
        "Hope: I didn't do what he wanted.",
        "Aly: He is upset. But it's -- I mean, you're hope and Liam. You're not breaking up over this. If you would just change your mind... just don't do this. Don't push Liam away.",
        "Hope: There is [Sniffles] A difference between private life and professional life, and I feel like I have learned to separate the two, but Liam is just --",
        "Aly: But this is different. I mean, Wyatt has interfered before. For him to give you that diamond --",
        "Hope: It's all part of marketing for Hope for the Future. It is the key to the line's success, you know? And if Liam really can't see that, well, then, god -- maybe we are just too far apart.",
        "Aly: But he --",
        "Hope: Maybe there's a reason we didn't make it work.",
        "Aly: He understands. But you are putting your professional life ahead of your personal life, and, hope, that is just crazy. That diamond feels like it's jinxed.",
        "Hope: It's supposed to bring luck.",
        "Aly: Yeah, bad luck, like Wyatt and his mother. If you are really making this choice, you'll only bring trouble.",
        "Quinn: Liam doesn't understand women at all.",
        "Wyatt: Apparently not. \"It's wrong for you to accept jewelry from another man.\" Blah, blah, blah.",
        "Quinn: To think I almost ruined things, going after him for you -- we should have known all we had to do was wait. Liam was bound to mess things up with hope the minute they got back together.",
        "Wyatt: See? Let that be a lesson to you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Wyatt: Everything always works out in the end. [Sighs] That's odd.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Wyatt: I think it's a Mexican area code.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Wyatt: Hello?",
        "Lt. Barragan: Wyatt Spencer, please.",
        "Wyatt: Speaking. Who is this?",
        "Lt. Barragan: Lieutenant Barragan from the Mexico city police department.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, what's going on?",
        "Lt. Barragan: You were an acquaintance of Ricardo Montemayor, were you not?",
        "Wyatt: Wait. This is about Ricardo?",
        "Lt. Barragan: Will you be in los Angeles for the next few days?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, yeah. Why?",
        "Lt. Barragan: I'm making arrangements to come up there. I'll need to set up a time to meet, ask a few questions.",
        "Wyatt: About what?",
        "Lt. Barragan: Se\u00f1or Montemayor's death. At first, we thought it was accidental, but now we're investigating another possibility.",
        "Wyatt: Such as?",
        "Lt. Barragan: Murder. I'll contact you when I'm in town.",
        "Wyatt: Sure.",
        "Quinn: Who was that, honey?"
