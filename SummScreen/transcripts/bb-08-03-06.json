        "Brooke tells Donna that she saw the kiss and it better be the last one, no more Ridge. Donna defends by announcing it was strictly innocent; Ridge was helping her with her confidence and she was showing her gratitude. Donna states that Brooke can't love Nick the way she does Ridge, and he is for the taking; just take her old job back. She understands how she could be attracted to Nick but Captain Control wants to control every thing she does and Brooke will not stand for that. And, if she is so in love with Nick, why does this kiss bother her so much? Because, Brooke has always wanted Ridge since the first day she spoke his name; he's the man for her, and still is.",
        "Taylor is welcomed back to the A.A. meeting anytime. She has a lot to give people. Thorne returns her to his place and Tylor talks to Alexandria. Even takes Darla's birthday dress and fashions it into one for Allie that she can wear when she is really sad and longing for her mother. Thorne comforts Taylor and tells her he's grateful and that he needs her. Eric worries about Thorne but tells Ridge he is glad Taylor is helping. There's going to be a fashion preview tomorrow and he should just do what he always does, and ignore Stephanie. Ridge speaks with Brooke and doesn't know whether to be flattered or offended by her accusations about Donna. He too scoffs that it was just an innocent kiss. And finally he has something to wake up in the morning for; don't take that way from him too. He confesses he still loves her and always will. Donna witnesses his hug and Brooke's repeats that she is sorry."

        "Brooke: I saw you kiss Ridge. You are never going to kiss him again.",
        "Donna: Brooke, modeling is new to me. I'm scared. I may not look it, but I am. Ridge has -- ridge has been great, making me feel like I can do this. That's all that kiss was about.",
        "Brooke: A kiss of gratitude? You really expect me to buy that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: I knew that I had a problem with drinking. I just -- I didn't want to face it. It -- it helped deaden the pain from my divorce. But my friends, they knew I was having trouble and they tried to help. And I just -- I didn't really want to listen. My son was worried about me, and I promised him -- I told him that I would pour all of the alcohol down the drain and get it out of the house, and -- I did. I did okay. And -- there was one last bottle of wine. I tried. I tried not to, but I did. And then my daughter called me. My daughter called me because she was in trouble and she needed help. And I just --",
        "[Taylor cries]",
        "Eric: I still can't believe what's happened. Poor Darla, such a sweet soul. Thorne, I'm worried about Thorne.",
        "Ridge: Thorne will make it through.",
        "Eric: Yeah, I know he will. Your mother tells me that Taylor has been very helpful to him and to Alexandria. That's good. Giving everything that Taylor's been through lately and for her to step up -- she's a real godsend.",
        "Ridge: I've got to be honest, I had my concerns. She's been so lost and out of focus for the last long while. But she always sort of steps to the plate when she's helping other people. That's when she's at her best.",
        "Eric: All right, about this photo session thing with Donna, how's that going?",
        "Ridge: Oh, don't ask.",
        "Eric: She's new at it. She'll get used to it.",
        "Ridge: I'm not talking about Donna, I'm talking about mother and Brooke. I just want to do something a little different. And neither of them seems to get what I'm after.",
        "Eric: But you believe in it, right?",
        "Ridge: Oh, yeah, I think it's a great idea.",
        "Eric: Well, as far as your mother is concerned, you just do what you always do. Ignore her.",
        "Ridge: That's what I will do. In fact, I'm planning a little fashion preview tomorrow. Debut some new designs, get the word out.",
        "Eric: What, tomorrow?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Eric: You're that confident?",
        "Ridge: Dad, I think if it goes half as well as I think it should, Donna may well be the perfect replacement.",
        "Brooke: Donna, this is a real job. A serious job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: And waiting tables isn't?",
        "Brooke: You know what I mean. You can't just strut around and make a play for the lead designer.",
        "Donna: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Brooke: I knew you were green at modeling, but I didn't think I would have to point out the obvious.",
        "Donna: Ridge has been coaching me. Giving me advice. What you saw was a simple kiss. I was thanking him for his support.",
        "Brooke: So now you're blaming it all on Ridge?",
        "Donna: I'm not blaming anyone. Nothing happened. And frankly, I'm surprised how much this is bothering you.",
        "Brooke: You know how hard it was for me to give up Brooke's bedroom.",
        "Donna: So you're taking it out on me?",
        "Brooke: No, I'm just --",
        "Donna: Telling me I'm behaving in an unprofessional manner? That I'm making this personal? Well, if anyone's making it personal, it's you.",
        "Brooke: Oh, that's ridiculous.",
        "Donna: Your reaction to what was an innocent kiss only proves what I've been saying all along. You want to be with Ridge. You should be his model -- his muse -- not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: We can't change what we've done. The damage, the hurt caused by our drinking. But we can change the future.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Maggie: Keep coming back. It really does work.",
        "Taylor: Thanks.",
        "Maggie: Good luck.",
        "Thorne: Are you okay?",
        "Taylor: Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "Stan: Hey, if you ever need to talk.",
        "Taylor: Thanks, Stan.",
        "Stan: Sure.",
        "Lisa: It's common to feel grief and regret over what brought you here. But your life still has value. You mentioned you have children, that your daughter needs you.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, my daughter Phoebe. She missed me so much, she came all the way back from Europe.",
        "Thorne: It's hard for children to be separated from their parents. Especially a daughter from her mother.",
        "Lisa: Once you have found your sobriety, a whole new life can begin for you. A new beginning. We're all here for you, Taylor. You have so much to offer this world. Remember, people need you.",
        "Taylor: Thanks.",
        "Thorne: Hey, she's right. A lot of us need you, Taylor. Your children, Alexandria, I need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: I didn't come to L.A. Looking for this job. You offered it to me, remember? And I only said I'd try because you and captain control double- teamed me into saying yes. Brooke, you're the face of the bedroom line. You're Ridge's inspiration. So take it. Take the job back.",
        "Brooke: We're not gonna go through this again.",
        "Donna: Then what, Brooke? I just stand here and listen to you accuse me of things that aren't true? Nick is a good looking guy. I see that. You were attracted to him. He's safe. Dependable. But he also wants to control everything in your life. And you, of all people, can't live like that.",
        "Brooke: I made a decision.",
        "Donna: The wrong decision. And it's not the first time. You married Eric, Thorne -- when all along you were in love with ridge. This marriage to nick is only history repeating itself. But it's not too late. You can just accept your destiny. Your life is meant to be spent with ridge.",
        "Brooke: Nick is a wonderful man. He's very dependable. What is so bad about that? To have someone in your life who really cares, who's never going to leave you.",
        "Donna: Nothing, but you're not --",
        "Brooke: You know, Bridget gave that up, so that I could have it. And R.J. And Hope, they really love Nick. We're a family.",
        "Donna: Okay. Great. I believe you. But if you're so happy with Nick, why are you telling me to keep my mitts off Ridge?",
        "Thorne: Alexandria, we're home. So, how did you feel about the meeting?",
        "Taylor: I never imagined I'd be at an AA meeting. But I needed it. Where did you find the strength to reach out and help me?",
        "Thorne: When someone I care for needs help, I know that Darla would want me to be there.",
        "Taylor: That's what Darla would have done.",
        "Thorne: Yeah.",
        "Taylor: I don't deserve your kindness. I really don't. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Alexandria: Why are you sad, Auntie Taylor? You miss mommy, too?",
        "Taylor: Yeah, Alexandria. I do miss your mommy. She was a friend.",
        "Alexandria: She's in heaven.",
        "Taylor: Mm-hmm. That's right. Mommy's in heaven. I know you're going through a really hard time right now. And I know your daddy is, too. I just feel bad. I wish there was something I could do.",
        "Alexandria: Daddy said no one can ever bring mommy back.",
        "Phoebe: She was fine on the beach. But when we came home, she wanted to play dress-up in her mommy's closet. And when she saw this dress, she got --",
        "Thorne: Darla wore it the night -- she wore it to Alexandria's party.",
        "Phoebe: When she saw it, she just got kind of quiet.",
        "Taylor: Honey, it's nothing you did. It's not you.",
        "Thorne: Mother offered to pick up Darla's things. Maybe I should just go ahead and box them up.",
        "Taylor: Oh, no way. No, no. It's too soon for that, Thorne. Let me try something. Alexandria -- hey, was this your mommy's favorite dress? Yeah? And she -- she wore it the night of your birthday party, didn't she? I heard you helped her pick it out. Is that true? Mm-hmm? My daughters used to do that for me. Do you think you might like to wear this dress?",
        "Alexandria: It's too big.",
        "Taylor: Well, I bet -- I bet I could fix that. I bet I could -- I could make it fit you. Would you like to help me? Yeah? Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: You asked for my help, and now you're giving me this guilt trip about Ridge.",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Donna: Then what are you saying? You claim it's about work, me needing to remain focused. But what it really comes down to is me staying away from your man.",
        "Brooke: My man is over at Marone Industries.",
        "Donna: You don't love Nick the way you love Ridge. Brooke, come on. He's standing right in front of you, there for the taking.",
        "Brooke: Nothing is that simple.",
        "Donna: Maybe some things are. My whole life, I've watched you -- this incredible person -- but for so long, you've made things so much more complicated than they need to be. Always jumping through hoops to please other people.",
        "Brooke: Well, that's what life's about. Concessions, compromises. It's all part of it.",
        "Donna: Brooke, you've wanted Ridge from the day you spoke his name. I've always known he's the man for you, and he still is.",
        "Ridge: Logan? One word and I get the attention of two beautiful women. Not bad.",
        "Brooke: Donna, would you mind? I'd like to speak to Ridge alone for a moment.",
        "Ridge: What's up?",
        "Brooke: You tell me. I saw you kiss Donna. I'm not going to put up with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: See? Now it's all done. Hang on. Now you can cut the thread again. Okay, ready?",
        "Phoebe: How did I not know you knew how to use a sewing machine?",
        "Taylor: Your father was a fashion designer, you know. I was married to him.",
        "Thorne: It's good to see you picked up a thing or two.",
        "Taylor: Okay. Let's go try this on. It's okay. We'll get it later. Come on. Okay, Cinderella. How's that?",
        "Alexandria: Just like mommy.",
        "Taylor: Mm-hmm. Just like Mommy. Alexandria, I know you miss your mommy. Your daddy does, too. We all do. So whenever you're feeling sad, you can put this dress on. You can think of all the happy times you had when your mommy was wearing this dress. Especially at your birthday party. Okay? And you'll feel closer to her. All right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You didn't like me kissing Donna. I don't know if I should be flattered or offended.",
        "Brooke: Donna is my sister, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Okay -- and?",
        "Brooke: And she's going to be the new face of Brooke's bedroom. And you're going to be working with her on a daily basis.",
        "Ridge: So, it should be strictly professional?",
        "Brooke: Are you saying it's more than that?",
        "Ridge: Come on, Brooke. It's not what you think.",
        "Brooke: I saw you kissing her, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: It just happened. She was feeling insecure. I was just helping her with her confidence.",
        "Brooke: Donna's got plenty of that.",
        "Ridge: Not when it comes to modeling, she doesn't. You don't go from waiting tables to being a featured model without a butterfly or two.",
        "Brooke: Well, who better to help her with her butterflies?",
        "Ridge: Oh, Brooke. Look, it was an innocent kiss. That's all.",
        "Brooke: I just want you to be aware of my feelings.",
        "Ridge: You think I'm not?",
        "Brooke: You know it was really hard on me to give up Brooke's bedroom.",
        "Ridge: It was hard on you? You married Nick, and you're talking about me kissing Donna? Brooke, it's all I can do to get through everyday of my life right now. For the first time, I'm excited about something. This line. I have something to get up in the morning and come to work for. The new bedroom line has a new direction. Donna has given me inspiration. And I'm having a fashion preview tomorrow. Look, if all this is hard on you, I'm very sorry. Please don't take this away from me, too.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Brooke: Nick, hi. Yeah, I just had to put out a few fires. I'll be back to Marone in a bit.",
        "Ridge: Still doesn't trust you to take care of yourself, huh?",
        "Brooke: Do you blame him?",
        "Ridge: Is he right?",
        "Brooke: I really should go.",
        "Ridge: Can we expect you at the fashion preview tomorrow?",
        "Brooke: No, I don't really think I'll be there.",
        "Ridge: Is that your decision, or Nick's?",
        "Brooke: It seems like you have everything you need.",
        "Ridge: If you say so. Brooke? You and R.J. are all I think about.",
        "Brooke: I believe you.",
        "Ridge: And you know I still love you. I always will.",
        "Brooke: And I never meant to hurt you.",
        "Ridge: I know. I know.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
