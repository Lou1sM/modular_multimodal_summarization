        "Quinn paces the floor but it is only Ridge that comes through the door. He thought he would catch her at work but she says she is not leaving until Eric comes home. They need to communicate if they are to have any chance. Sheila catches Eric packing and he says it is time that he goes home. He quickly calls Quinn and asks if she is home; good as he plans to come see her. She is ecstatic. Ridge tells her to pull herself together and keep her chin up. She wonders if Eric is going to forgive her. Ridge says he should not be here when Eric gets home so he will see her later. Bill and Brooke take the jet but everyone else but Sally and Thomas are on a commercial jet and speaking about the night before. Nicole tells Maya and Zende it must have been quite a night as they got in late. Katie remembers seeing Maya with her hand on Zende's face as she kissed his cheek and hugged him. Sheila says wait; there is something she wants to tell Eric before he goes. She tells him that he has always been honest with her so she wants to do the same. There are some betrayals you cannot forgive and he will never be able to trust Quinn again. He needs to leave her.",
        "Zende follows Maya to another room to get some water. He tells her last night was not exactly what he thought it would be but alcohol can sometimes make things happen. He is sorry that things like that still happens to Maya. She says it does not bother her anymore. And she does not want Rick or Nicole to worry so he should not tell them. Katie pulls Wyatt aside and says she saw something last night that surprised her. She saw Maya kissing. Wyatt says big deal, that is what happens at clubs and the two of them know that. She says but it was with Zende. He asks if it was a real kiss or just a peck. She says it was dark so she cannot be sure. He says whatever, it is not their business. Maya tells Zende to please just forget it ever happened. Rick does not have to know about the dudes who verbally attacked her. Katie and Wyatt and Rick all notice Zende coming out of the bedroom where Maya has been. Charlie marches into Sheila's room and snaps at her that he never thought Eric would move out and now he is afraid that will all be on him. She tells him to calm down as no one even knows that it was him that told her. Quinn is apprehensive but glad to see Eric home. She starts off by saying she betrayed their marriage and she cannot tell him how much she regrets that and wishes she could take it back. But they cannot change the past but make sure from this moment forward they can work this out. She believes that is the reason he came home, that he wants to fight for their marriage as much as she wants to. He says she betrayed him with his own son. He wants her off the property, both her and Ridge. He could never trust her again. He wants a divorce. She begs that he has to give her another chance please. The can work this out."

        "Quinn: [Sighs] I can't focus. All I can think about is Eric.",
        "Ridge: You haven't heard from him?",
        "Quinn: I keep calling him, but he's not answering his phone.",
        "Ridge: Well, then, maybe going to the office is a good idea, take your mind off things.",
        "Quinn: Where is he, ridge? Where is my husband?",
        "Ridge: Telling you where he is is not gonna make a difference.",
        "Quinn: I am his wife. We need to communicate. Otherwise, there's no chance for us. The divide between us keeps growing every day that we're apart!",
        "Sheila: You're leaving?",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Sheila: Where you going?",
        "Eric: Home.",
        "Sheila: Home?",
        "Eric: It's time.",
        "Nicole: Lizzy is sound asleep, and she seems to be feeling better.",
        "Rick: Thank you for giving her a bottle.",
        "Nicole: Of course. Hey, Wyatt, it was really nice of your dad to let us use the jet while he and Brooke stay back on their yacht.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, it's a little quieter with sally taking commercial, for whatever reason, and Thomas going directly to new York.",
        "Nicole: Hey, well, it means more champagne for us.",
        "Rick: Uh-oh. Somebody's hurting.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] No hair of the dog for you guys?",
        "Maya: No, no. Thanks.",
        "Zende: No. I'm good.",
        "Rick: You guys must have had quite a night.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, you guys were out late enough. Was it fun?",
        "Wyatt: Hot night at the club last night. Katie and I had a good time ourselves.",
        "Katie: Yeah, uh, we, um -- we kind of lost track of you guys. Did you have fun?",
        "Rick: I'd say it's safe to say they did. Maya didn't get home till after sunrise, didn't even sleep a wink.",
        "Maya: Yeah, it -- it got a little crazy. I wish you were there.",
        "Rick: Well, I wanted you to let loose. I was happy to stay and watch Lizzy.",
        "Wyatt: Well, you guys missed out.",
        "Nicole: I feel bad I didn't join you.",
        "Zende: It's all right, baby. There will be more to come.",
        "Sheila: Do you need any help?",
        "Eric: I didn't bring much.",
        "Sheila: Have all your medications?",
        "Eric: I'm all packed.",
        "Quinn: I just -- I wish I could see him. Spend some alone time with him. I can tell him how sorry I am, how much I regret what I --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Quinn: W-wait! It's Eric. Eric? Is that you?",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Sweetheart. Thank you so much for returning my call. I can't tell you how much I've missed you.",
        "Eric: Are you at the house?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. I am.",
        "Eric: Good. I'm coming to see you.",
        "Quinn: Your father wants to see me.",
        "Ridge: How did he sound?",
        "Quinn: I could hear the pain in his voice. It kills me what I've put him through.",
        "Ridge: He's coming over to talk to you, so that's not all bad, is it?",
        "Quinn: I hope not.",
        "Ridge: Don't do that. Keep your chin up. You've pulled yourself together throughout this whole thing, so don't give up now.",
        "Quinn: I'm not giving up. I'm never gonna give up on Eric. I -- I'm just so relieved that he's coming home. At least I hope that's what he's doing, you know? Not -- not just to the house, but to me. Do you think he's gonna forgive me?",
        "Ridge: I don't know the answer to that. But I'm pulling for you. Both of you.",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: I shouldn't be here when he gets home. I'll see ya.",
        "Sheila: Eric, wait. There's something I want to tell you before you go.",
        "Zende: How you feeling?",
        "Maya: [Sighs] I'm, uh... I'm fine.",
        "Zende: Good. I know last night didn't exactly turn out the way we wanted.",
        "Maya: Yeah, I'm just not used to, uh, encountering stuff like that anymore, you know?",
        "Zende: Yeah. You know, alcohol can make people lose their morals sometimes.",
        "Maya: [Sighs] Maybe. Well, I don't know about everybody else, but it's been a long time since I had that much to drink. [Laughs]",
        "Zende: I know what you mean. I won't be, uh, dabbling in alcohol anytime soon.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: What movie are you gonna watch?",
        "Katie: Um, I -- I haven't really thought about it. I've just been quantifying the numbers for the online auction.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Katie: Could you help me with that?",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Quantifying. Sure. [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: Oh! Hi. [Chuckles] Okay, that's --",
        "Wyatt: Mile high club with all these people in here?",
        "Katie: No, that's not why...",
        "Wyatt: I'm fine with it if you are.",
        "Katie: That's not why I wanted you to come out here.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, well, you say the word, and I'll make it happen.",
        "Katie: I'm sure you would, but, seriously... something strange happened as I was leaving the club last night.",
        "Wyatt: Couldn't stop thinking about me? That's not strange, really. It's normal. It happens sometimes.",
        "Katie: No, um, I saw two people kissing.",
        "Wyatt: That's what happens at clubs. You remember?",
        "Katie: Yes. I remember. But we are not married.",
        "Wyatt: Married? What does -- what does married have to do with it? Is it someone we know?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. Happened after you left.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, bill and Brooke already took off. Maya and Zende?",
        "Maya: You know, I already took some aspirin. I think I'm just gonna go to sleep.",
        "Rick: Are you okay, babe?",
        "Maya: [Sighs] Yeah, I'm tired. I-I'm gonna go get some rest.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, you look tired, too, baby.",
        "Zende: Yeah, no, I -- I'm gonna go grab a pillow.",
        "Rick: All right, well... sweet dreams. Get some rest.",
        "Maya: Thanks.",
        "Zende: Happy we get a chance to speak.",
        "Maya: Hey, look, I don't want rick and Nicole to know what happened last night.",
        "Zende: Maya, you were verbally attacked by some ignorant bigot at the club. I think rick would want to know. Hell, I know I would.",
        "Maya: I know, but you know how he gets. He's gonna get alarmed and make a whole big deal out of it, and then he and Nicole are gonna feel bad that they weren't there to stand up for me. No, no, I think it's just best if we keep it between us, okay? I just want to forget it happened.",
        "Eric: What is it, Sheila?",
        "Sheila: You've always been very honest with me. You've made it perfectly clear that there's no future for us, and I have been so happy just to be here and be a friend to you. I know that you're leaving to go see Quinn. Just don't go easy on her. You need to divorce that witch. She can never be trusted again, Eric. There are some betrayals that can be forgiven, but what she did with your son? She is despicable. You deserve the absolute best in life, and Quinn isn't it.",
        "Wyatt: Maya and Zende?",
        "Katie: I know, I know. It sounds crazy.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so, was it like a kiss-kiss, or more like a peck?",
        "Katie: It was dark. I think it, you know, was maybe on the cheek?",
        "Wyatt: On the cheek? That's it?",
        "Katie: Well, they -- they embraced. It seemed intimate.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, God. They hugged.",
        "Katie: Shut up, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, Katie, he's her brother-in-law. There's got to be a viable explanation. Maya is totally devoted to rick, and Zende and Nicole are like the newlyweds of the year.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I know. I know. You're right.",
        "Wyatt: Either way, it's none of our business.",
        "Katie: Okay. I'm -- I'm probably over-reacting.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: I have trust issues.",
        "Wyatt: I had no idea.",
        "Katie: Thank you for indulging me and for talking me off the ledge.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, we could do more than talk. You want to talk about the mile high club? We can do that again if you want.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] No, I'm good.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, okay.",
        "Maya: I don't wake up in the morning and think about it. Being a woman is who I am. It's who I have always been.",
        "Zende: You should be proud of who you are. You're a strong woman, Maya. Sometimes I forget how much adversity you've gone through.",
        "Maya: I've been dealing with insecurities and the fear of being exposed my whole life. I just want to be accepted for who I am. That's what matters to me the most. And the fact that you stood up for me the way that you did last night, Zende... it just means the world to me.",
        "[Rapid knocking on door]",
        "Charlie: Boy, you really know how to put things on spin cycle, don't you? I cannot believe that Eric -- Eric moved out! You know, I'm not so sorry that their marriage might end. What I'm sorry about is that the whole thing might come back on me!",
        "Sheila: Charlie, would you just calm down? Nobody knows you told me!",
        "Charlie: I didn't tell you! You put two and two together! By the way, where is Eric?",
        "Sheila: He went to see Quinn.",
        "[Door unlocks]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Quinn: You're home.",
        "Zende: I'm sorry this is something you still have to go through.",
        "Maya: Oh! [Sighs] I don't let guys like that bother me 'cause I know who I am. And I have a family that supports me. What breaks my heart is when I think about people who don't have that. That's why I'm so grateful for all of you.",
        "Zende: Yeah. Me, rick, Nicole, Lizzy.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: When she gets older. Guys like that, they better watch out.",
        "Maya: Yeah. [Laughs]",
        "Zende: She's half Avant, half Forrester, which means she half-crazy.",
        "Maya: [Laughing] So true. That's so true. No, I mean, honestly, the best that rick and I can do is just to raise her to be who she is and to stand up for what's right.",
        "Zende: Yeah, well, you know what? I'm glad you're all right.",
        "Maya: Mm. I'm a little hungover, but, uh, you know, I'll live.",
        "Zende: Are you sure you don't want me to tell Nicole and rick what happened?",
        "Maya: No, I don't want them to worry. I don't want to worry, either.",
        "Zende: Then I'll honor that. As far as me worrying... I'm gonna do that whether you like it or not, okay?",
        "Maya: [Laughs] Okay.",
        "Zende: Get some rest.",
        "Maya: Pillow.",
        "Zende: Everybody all right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Yeah. That was quick. You get any sleep, or...?",
        "Zende: No, I just, uh, got a pillow. Hopefully Maya is. I'm still feeling the effects from last night.",
        "Rick: Well, thank you again for taking her out and keeping an eye on her.",
        "Zende: Yeah, no, we had a great time. We should have probably turned it in a little sooner, but, you know.",
        "Nicole: Aww, come here, sweet thing. Take a nap. Rest your head.",
        "Katie: So, is, um... is Maya okay? I mean, she seemed a little shaky.",
        "Zende: Uh, no, she's, uh -- she's a tough girl. She'll be just fine.",
        "Charlie: Eric's with Quinn?",
        "Sheila: Yes.",
        "Charlie: What does that mean? I mean, does that mean he forgives her? He's letting her off the hook?",
        "Sheila: I would like to assume that it means he's telling her he wants a divorce, and hopefully, that's happening right now.",
        "Quinn: I've been so worried about you, Eric. Wondering where you are. How you are. It's -- it was so hard not to hear from you. But I understand. I mean, I-I hurt you, and -- and you needed some time alone. I spoke to... I spoke to ridge. He said that he saw you and that Sheila's been hanging around.",
        "Eric: I don't want to talk about her.",
        "Quinn: No, I -- I don't want to talk about her, either. I just -- I want to talk about us. I betrayed our marriage. I betrayed our vows. I betrayed your faith in me. I can't tell you how much I regret that. I would do anything if I could take that back. I also know that I -- I can't change the past. All I can be is the wife that you deserve to have from this moment forward. Look, I know -- I know that we have a lot of issues to work through. We have worked through so much in the past, and I know -- I know that we can overcome this, and I -- I believe you do, too. I mean, that's why you came back home. To me. Because you want to fight for our marriage as much as I -- as much as I do. Eric, please, just say something.",
        "Eric: How can I stay married to you? How can I ever trust you again? You betrayed me with my own son.",
        "Quinn: I -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Eric: I want you and ridge off the property.",
        "Quinn: Ridge already moved out. I --",
        "Eric: No, Quinn, you're not listening to me. I want you gone. I want a divorce.",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Eric: I've started the proceedings already.",
        "Quinn: No, Eric, wait! No, no, no! Please! Not a divorce. Please, I made a mistake, and I am so sorry, but I will do anything! I'll -- I'll go to counseling. I'll give you -- I'll give you your space. As much as you need. Please, just sit down and -- and talk to me!",
        "Eric: There's nothing to talk about. It's over, Quinn! It's over!",
        "Quinn: Eric, no! No! You cannot mean it! Not a divorce! We can work this out! Please! Eric, I am begging you! You have to give me another chance! Please!"
