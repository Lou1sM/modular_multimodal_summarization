She feigns ignorance and scoffs that she just got out of treatment, nowhere near Mexico City. But she does not want this to ruin his fabulous day that he will have with Hope. She accepted the diamond so its only a matter of time before she takes Wyatt back. As the group at FC huddle Ridge says they need to work fast to continue this while the diamond is hot. They need Hope in here. Rick calls her and tells her to call Wyatt they need him too. Ivy tells Liam that she knows he is upset. His fiance should not be accepting jewelry from another guy. He corrects her and said he did not break up with Hope which Ivy seemed to think. Ridge tells Rick they need to make some decisions and a statement about the diamond. Wyatt comes in and says he gave the diamond to Hope so it really is up to her. She says she is going to use the diamond with her line otherwise she never would have accepted it. Wyatt tells the group that he told them this would be big. Aly hates how they are encouraging Wyatt. Donna says the news is trending like crazy. Pam says Rodeo Drive already has lookie loos. Ridge asks how long would it take to set up a display. Eric says they need to do something bigger than that. He says Thorne thinks they should bring it to Paris. Carter says they have to avoid rushing ahead and risk overlooking something. Ridge says they will cross that when they have to. Ridge tells Wyatt he started this firestorm so what is his idea. Wyatt says that should be up to the diamond's owner and asks Hope if she is up for another adventure. She seems confused and says her head is still spinning. Wyatt says that is what they want to do - take everyone's breathe away. He likes Thorne's suggestion going to Paris. How about three superstars in one photo shoot? It could be the diamond, Hope and the Eiffel Tower. If they can make the jet ready he can be ready right away. Every moment they miss the buzz will start to fade. All they need is one iconic image and HFTF will be cemented in people's minds forever. Wyatt promises them they will not be sorry. They all like it. Only Hope who is saying nothing looks unsure.

They have given him a second chance and he wants to prove to them that he deserves that.",
        "Brooke breaks away from her kiss with Deacon and asks what is he doing. He says getting through to her the best way he knows how. He asks how's he doing. Stunned she says he can not come back and expect anything after all this time. He tells her that he hasn't forgotten and neither has she. She says they were reckless back then. He says they were crazy for each other if she will just admit it. She said her priorities have changed and right now her main one is her daughter. He says they have that in common then. She finds a photo on the phone and says Liam is going to be extremely upset when he sees this with Hope wearing the diamond. Liam hobbles home and flops down on the couch. He gets some takeout Chinese out of the frij but then throws that aside and is not interested. Deacon tells Brooke that he didn't come over to look at pictures on her phone. About that time she gets a text from Rick that Hope and Wyatt are going to Paris. He says Liam won't like that for sure. Brooke says all the more reason she doesn't understand why Hope would say yes. Deacon says Hope is a lot like her mother in that regard. She has a heart inside of her that wants what she wants. She can listen to her heart and believe and trust in it just like Brooke always did. Brooke says Hope and Liam have been through so much. She hates to see them be derailed. Deacon says she is a Logan. He'd be a fool to let her go. Alone Wyatt tells Hope that she never gave Rick a firm answer. He tells her again that Paris will be good for her and her line. He wouldn't have suggested it otherwise. Finally she says she wants to go ..but not until she talks to Liam. Quinn's face lights up when she calls Wyatt and he tells her that he and Hope are on their way to Paris as soon as she talks to Liam. This could put a wedge between them permanently. Hope tells Liam that she wasn't sure that he'd let her in since he walked out on her the last time they saw each other. He says yeah he was frustrated as he wasn't getting through to her. She says she could say the same thing. But she is willing to still talk about it. That is not exactly why she is here though. And she reminds Liam that it was a business decision to keep the diamond and Liam was the only one making it personal. She says she is going out of town and she really doesn't want to leave things like this between them. He asks and she says Paris. Rick and Wyatt are going as Ridge wants them to do a photo shoot. Liam stiffens and backs away when he hears Wyatt is going and is sure that it was his idea. She tries to sell him again that this is not about the diamond or Wyatt. It really will empower the line and her message to young girls out there. It's not because Wyatt gave it to her but what the diamond can do. She makes it clear that she has not said yes yet. She says she loves him and she wants them to start their life together so why not in Paris. She asks him to come with her."

        "Wyatt: It was a lieutenant from the Mexico city police department.",
        "Quinn: What did they want?",
        "Wyatt: To ask me some questions about Ricardo Montemayor's death.",
        "Quinn: Why? What do they suspect?",
        "Wyatt: Murder.",
        "Aly: Is the diamond really worth that much to you?",
        "Hope: Saying yes to the diamond does not mean that I'm saying no to Liam.",
        "Aly: You didn't say yes to the diamond, hope. You said yes to Wyatt. That's why Liam walked out on you.",
        "Liam: Okay. Well, obviously, you think I did the right thing.",
        "Ivy: Well, does it really matter what I think?",
        "Liam: I-I don't know. I mean, you were at the press conference. You saw what happened.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. And I know why you're upset. Your fianc\u00e9e should not be accepting jewelry from her ex-boyfriend. But I don't know. I can't tell you if breaking up with hope was the right way to handle things or not.",
        "Liam: I didn't break up with her.",
        "Ivy: Didn't you?",
        "Carter: The diamond's big news.",
        "Oliver: Hope and Wyatt, too.",
        "Maya: All over social media.",
        "Pam: Jarrett, line 2.",
        "Eric: We'll get back to him.",
        "Pam: Sorry, Jarrett. Try later.",
        "Donna: Did anyone know what Wyatt was planning?",
        "Pam: Well, hope obviously didn't.",
        "Rick: He said he was gonna get the world's attention. He certainly did that.",
        "Ridge: How do we keep it?",
        "Brooke: What are you doing?",
        "Deacon: Getting through to you the best way I know how. How am I doing?",
        "Ridge: All right, everybody. I called this meeting because we need to harness the momentum that Wyatt gave us.",
        "Eric: Marketing, media, sales, everyone.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Ivy?",
        "Ridge: Sure.",
        "Rick: Hey, it's Rick. We need you in the C.E.O. Office.",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah. I'll -- I'll be right there. I, uh -- sorry. I-I have to go.",
        "Liam: No, go. Go.",
        "Quinn: That sounds serious.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. The Mexican police want to talk to me.",
        "Quinn: How would you know what happened to Ricardo?",
        "Wyatt: Don't know. Do you?",
        "Quinn: Me?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Oh, honey, come on. Why would I know? I just got out of treatment -- nowhere near Mexico city.",
        "Wyatt: You just got out?",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. Look... it makes sense that they want to talk to you. Ricardo left you the diamond. They're probably just gonna assume you were old friends. You know what? You shouldn't even be thinking about this, though. Don't let this phone call ruin your incredible day. You know, focus on hope. She accepted the diamond. It's only a matter of time before she takes you back.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles softly] All right. Well, I'm off to work.",
        "Quinn: Okay, honey. Bye.",
        "Wyatt: Bye.",
        "Ridge: We need to jump on this now.",
        "Rick: Caroline is in a meeting.",
        "Eric: Let's get hope in here.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Hope: Hey.",
        "Rick: Are you with Wyatt?",
        "Hope: Aly.",
        "Rick: We need you both in dad's office. Call Wyatt. We need him here, too.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Deacon: The connection's still there.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Deacon, you can't just come back and expect, after all this time...",
        "Deacon: I haven't forgotten. And neither have you.",
        "Ridge: If we can make this happen, it's gonna be really big.",
        "Rick: That's a big number right there.",
        "Hope: Hi.",
        "Rick: Hey! Did you find Wyatt?",
        "Hope: Oh, uh, I sent him a text.",
        "Rick: Is everything okay?",
        "Ridge: Hope's here. We can start.",
        "Eric: All right. Marketing already has a link to the diamond footage on the website. We should prepare a statement.",
        "Ridge: We've got to make some decisions first, carter.",
        "Rick: Forrester has the diamond back. What are we gonna do with it?",
        "Wyatt: Well, actually, um [Chuckles] I gave hope the diamond, so it's up to her what she wants to do with it.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Um, well, I'm gonna use it to promote the line. I wouldn't have accepted it otherwise.",
        "Brooke: We both moved on, deacon.",
        "Deacon: Look, we could circle back.",
        "Brooke: We were reckless!",
        "Deacon: We were crazy about each other!",
        "Brooke: Look, I know that's how you want to remember it, but it wasn't always like that.",
        "Deacon: It was sometimes.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Brooke: You say you've changed. We, I have, too. I have different priorities now. And the most important priority is my daughter.",
        "Deacon: We have that in common.",
        "Brooke: Yes, which is why I think you're going to want to see this.",
        "Deacon: It looks like she took my advice. It's a priceless diamond, Brooke. She couldn't say no to it.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Liam is going to be extremely upset.",
        "Wyatt: I told you this would be big.",
        "Donna: Was it for real? The diamond is really yours?",
        "Pam: Do you get to keep it?",
        "Hope: Well, I think it should be put on display.",
        "Wyatt: Well, yeah, it should be displayed, but it should be worn as a necklace.",
        "Ivy: A 40-plus-carat one-of-a-kind necklace.",
        "Maya: They say it's magic.",
        "Rick: I definitely know it has the power to raise sales, doesn't it?",
        "Aly: Why are they encouraging him?",
        "Donna: Hope for the Future's already trending off the charts.",
        "Pam: And that is really saying something, 'cause donna has the most active account in town.",
        "Oliver: The people want to see that diamond.",
        "Pam: Well, the rodeo drive boutique already has looky-loos.",
        "Carter: How long would it take to set up a display?",
        "Rick: No, we need to do something bigger.",
        "Eric: Thorne thinks we should bring the diamond to Paris -- build an exhibit around it there.",
        "Rick: Well, if Ivy is willing to do a new setting, we could tie it to her line -- send it to Australia. How does that sound, mate?",
        "Ivy: Y-- overwhelming. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: This whole thing caught all of us by surprise, and, unfortunately, we don't have time to catch our balance, but we have to make a decision.",
        "Eric: It's not the way I like to do things.",
        "Carter: It's risky, rushing ahead. We might miss something important.",
        "Ridge: If there's a problem, we'll deal with it when we get there.",
        "Wyatt: That's how I work best.",
        "Ridge: Now, Wyatt, you started this little firestorm. What's your idea?",
        "Wyatt: Well, that depends on the diamond's new owner. What do you say, hope? You up for another adventure?",
        "Ivy: I want hope to weigh in on this.",
        "Rick: It is your line, sis.",
        "Pam: And it is your diamond.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Uh, well, honestly, my head is still spinning.",
        "Donna: Yeah. If somebody gave me a gift like that, I'd be passed out on the floor.",
        "Wyatt: See, that is exactly the feeling that we want this campaign to capture. We want to take their breath away.",
        "Ridge: So, you do have an idea?",
        "Wyatt: I like what Thorne suggested.",
        "Eric: Take the diamond to Paris?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Well, Rick did say he wanted to go bigger, so I'm thinking, \"what's bigger than one superstar diamond?\" How 'bout three superstars in one photo shoot?",
        "Oliver: Celebrities?",
        "Wyatt: Icons. The diamond, hope, and the Eiffel Tower, hmm? I mean, if we can get the jet ready, I can -- I can have everything ready for the photo shoot right away. But every hour that passes, the buzz starts to fade.",
        "Ridge: We can't let that happen. We got to capitalize.",
        "Wyatt: Right. But all we need is one great iconic image and Hope for the Future will be cemented in people's minds forever.",
        "Rick: I like it.",
        "Ridge: I like it, too.",
        "Eric: And you can be ready right now?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. [Chuckles] Look, just give me a chance, okay? I promise you won't be sorry. Okay, look -- I know you've had issues with me in the past and I've made mistakes and I have given you plenty of reasons to question my judgment. But there's one thing that you can't deny -- my passion, how much I care about this job, how grateful I am to get another shot. This opportunity is -- is huge for Hope for the Future, but it's also a huge opportunity for me to prove myself and to show you that we want the same things. And with the help of the diamond... I know we can achieve them.",
        "Brooke: Wyatt put hope in a horrible position.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt gave her a hell of a gift.",
        "Brooke: In front of the whole world and made it impossible for her to say no.",
        "Deacon: Hey, remind me to take some lessons from that kid. Look, I didn't come over here to look at videos on your phone.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Deacon: Is -- is it hope?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] No, it's Rick. Hope and Rick are going to Paris with Wyatt to do a layout with the diamond.",
        "Deacon: With Wyatt?",
        "Brooke: That's what it says.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Liam isn't gonna like that, either.",
        "Brooke: Which makes me wonder why she agreed to it.",
        "Deacon: You know, she's doing it for the line. She's like her old man -- keeping her eye on the prize.",
        "Brooke: I-I don't understand what she's thinking.",
        "Deacon: Maybe she's not. Look, I know it doesn't sound like her. I know she's logical and cautious. But, Brooke, she's also your daughter, which means she's got a heartbeat inside of her that wants what it wants. I know that scares you because you're afraid she's gonna do the right thing for the wrong reason or vice versa and that it could get her in trouble, but you know what? It won't lie to her. She can trust it, like you've always trusted it.",
        "Brooke: She and Liam have been through so much. I don't want this to derail them.",
        "Deacon: She's a Logan. He'd be a fool to let her go.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, you're not gonna throw that thing at me, are you?",
        "Hope: I thought about it.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Kind of put you on the spot back there.",
        "Hope: Yeah, you did, didn't you -- a couple times?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. And I hate to do it again, but...you didn't really give Rick an answer on Paris.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] You know, it's -- I really don't think that I should be leaving right now. Liam's really upset.",
        "Wyatt: So? A little time apart. He'll calm down. He'll get over it. Unlikely, I know, but stranger things have happened. [Chuckles] Paris is a good idea -- for you and for your line. I wouldn't have suggested it if it wasn't.",
        "Hope: Look, I-I want to go.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Then say yes.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] No. Not until I talk to Liam.",
        "Aly: They might ask you to go.",
        "Oliver: No. They'll use the international crew.",
        "Aly: Well, if it even happens. Hope didn't say yes.",
        "Oliver: But why would she accept the diamond if she's not gonna use it to promote her line?",
        "Aly: Good question.",
        "Oliver: Of course, Wyatt has his agenda.",
        "Aly: And he's not even trying to hide it.",
        "Oliver: Taking the diamond to Paris is a really great idea. You know, it could be a really great photo shoot.",
        "Aly: Yeah, but why does he have to go along? He's not responsible for the diamond anymore. He gave it to hope.",
        "Oliver: I still can't believe Ricardo Montemayor just gave it to him.",
        "Aly: It kind of makes me sad. He had all that money and priceless jewels but no family -- no one close to share it with. Everyone says the diamond is magic, but it definitely wasn't lucky for Liam or se\u00f1or Montemayor.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Wyatt: If I don't answer my phone, it probably means that I'm busy.",
        "Quinn: Except you're not, because you answered your phone.",
        "Wyatt: Is everything all right?",
        "Quinn: That's what I called to ask you. How's hope?",
        "Wyatt: Well, she's getting ready for a trip to Paris.",
        "Quinn: Paris?",
        "Wyatt: With me.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] Oh, Wyatt!",
        "Wyatt: And with Rick and the diamond. We're putting together a photo shoot. Actually, I'm putting together a photo shoot superfast, and I need to get off the phone so I can get to work.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Well, is hope helping you?",
        "Wyatt: She will be. She's on her way to Liam's right now to break the bad news.",
        "Quinn: I thought he walked out on her.",
        "Wyatt: Well, this might shut the door between them permanently.",
        "Hope: I wasn't sure you'd let me in.",
        "Liam: Why would you say that?",
        "Hope: Because you just walked out earlier.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I was frustrated. I wasn't getting through to you.",
        "Hope: I-I could say the same thing, but I'm still willing to talk about it.",
        "Liam: Is that why you're here?",
        "Hope: Uh, no -- I mean, not exactly.",
        "Liam: Um...you're not wearing the thing.",
        "Hope: No. No. It's -- it's in the safe at Forrester.",
        "Liam: Okay. So, it's still yours. You know -- you know what he's doing, and I know that you see it because you were ready to give it back to him. And then he ambushes you with this press conference, announcing his gift in front of the whole world, and, suddenly, everything you said to me goes out the window.",
        "Hope: Liam, it was a business decision. You are the only one making it personal.",
        "Liam: Hope, it's personal to me.",
        "Hope: Okay. Okay. So, let's talk about it.",
        "Liam: I don't -- I don't think that's a good idea right now.",
        "Hope: Well, I might have to go out of town, and I don't want to leave things on bad terms.",
        "Liam: Where are you going?",
        "Hope: Paris.",
        "Liam: With who?",
        "Hope: Rick. And Wyatt. Rick and Ridge want me to do some photo shoots there. They think it would be a really good idea.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, but originally, it was Wyatt's idea, wasn't it?",
        "Hope: I haven't said yes yet. I wanted to talk to you first.",
        "Liam: But you've made up your mind already, right?",
        "Hope: Liam... this could be a really, really incredible opportunity. Showcasing the diamond in Europe would fortify Hope for the Future there, and it could bring in thousands of new clients. And, obviously, profits are important, yes, but you know that's not why I'd do this. You know that. The more reporters that show up to our showrooms, the more headlines we get and the more young women are going to be in touch with Hope for the Future's message of empowerment and environmental awareness. You -- you get that, right? I mean, you understand that. This is not about the diamond. This is not because Wyatt gave it to me. This is because of what the diamond can do. Liam... Liam, I love you. I love you so much. And I want to start our life together, so [Sniffles] Let's start it in Paris. You are the man that I want to be with. What do you say? Come with me."
