Liam asks why Sally flew back by herself with Thomas going to New York. Steffy says she does not know but whatever keeps them apart is okay with her. Quinn begs Eric not to divorce her. She knows that he loves her. Eric says he could not ever trust her again. She says they cannot break up over a few kisses. He opines that it was more than that and that is all he needs to know. So, no, no marriage counselors to tell him what he already knows. Ridge tells Steffy this is the worst it has ever been. Eric told him he no longer is his son. And it will be hard on Quinn with Sheila sitting there fanning the flames. Sheila comes back and finds Charlie still there. She threatens him with if he does not want his precious Pammy to know that he told her about Ridge and Quinn then he better not to be telling her to get out of Eric's life. She was his wife once and is a friend now and knows what is best for him. Charlie accuses her of wanting to be Eric's wife again. A Beatrice knocks on the door and Sheila invites her in. She starts looking around for vibes. Charlie asks Sheila what she is up to, he does not like it. She said she asked him to leave but he can stay over her dead body ..and laughs an evil laugh when she says it could be his body. Quinn tells Eric this does not have to be over if they could just talk and work this out. She will do anything to make that happen. He is livid. He says it could have been anyone else but it was his own son. He could never trust her again. She cannot fix that. Katie laments to Wyatt that she does not want to keep harping on what she saw the other night but she can't quite shake it either. He says just leave it alone, but them on the other hand ....", "Katie says that is funny, she did not know there was a \"you and me\". He starts to kiss her again and she pulls away and tells him he should find someone else and so should she. It was fun but .He says he feels like she is dumping him. She says no because they are not dating. He says they can leave those kisses on the plane and in Monaco or he could take her out and have fun and see what happens. She throws up roadblocks that she has a kid and cannot be out all night. He says he can work with that and remove any obstacles. Beatrice starts spraying smoke all around Sheila's room and tells Charlie to please move as she needs her space. Charlie asks Sheila again if she is planning on being Mrs. Eric Forrester again. Quinn tells Eric they fought so hard for this marriage that no one else wanted. And then they found the world's most unlikely couple were actually good for each other. He says divorce is not the easy way out. It has been agony with no sleep lately. She says it hurts her that the most important decision in his life he was with Sheila. He reminds her this all had nothing to do with Sheila. Quinn says good. He is a good man and she hopes he can find it in his heart one last time to forgive her. It won't be easy to learn to trust her again. But she was a devoted wife to him and will be again, just please do not divorce her. She believes the power of their love can overcome and she thinks he believes that too."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Steffy: ...And it was incredibly beautiful. We, like, had it right over the water, and the swimsuits were so sexy and vibrant and...", "Liam: Yeah? Oh, sexy. Vibrant.

Classic dollar bill spencer. Center of attention.", "Liam: Yeah, what else is new? Actually, I did hear about that. I just wanted your take.", "Steffy: Yeah, actually, he, um, handled it with class. Apparently there was no voting whatsoever. He was just trying to gain excitement for the charity event.", "Liam: Hmm.", "Steffy: But we -- we got a lot of money for the children. It means a lot.", "Liam: And coincidentally it bolstered his image. Imagine that.", "Steffy: [ Sighs ] Of course.", "Liam: So, thomas went back to new york? Is that right?", "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah. Shocker, huh? I mean, it was bound to happen. Look what's going on with my family. My granddad and quinn, quinn and my dad, and granddad and sheila. It's like the whole world has been turned upside down.", "Liam: Yeah.", "Steffy: Especially my grandfather'S.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Eric, please. Don't do this. A divorce?", "Eric: How could I ever trust you again? Why would I want to?", "Quinn: Because you love me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Uh, listen, it was -- it was really great of you to give me a ride to the office, but it -- it -- it wasn't necessary.", "Wyatt: [ Cackles ] Just back from monaco and she's already giving me the ol' brush-off.", "Katie: No, I just... [ Sighs ] I want to capitalize on the momentum.", "Wyatt: Yeah. Well... so do I.", "Katie: I mean all the positive press that forrester has received from the swimwear show.", "Wyatt: Oh. Right.", "Katie: Their social media is blowing up, and everybody wants to know about our new designer.", "Wyatt: Yeah, zende.", "Katie: Yeah.", "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. I just -- I still can't shake what I saw between zende and maya. I mean, I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but it seemed like an intimate moment.", "Wyatt: I mean, I'm sure it was nothing. But, uh... you and me, on the other hand...", "Katie: You know, um, I'm -- I'm gonna call donna and just check in, make sure everything's okay.", "Wyatt: [ Chuckles ] You already did that from the car, remember? You're not very good at changing the subject.", "Katie: Charlotte!", "Wyatt: That's better.", "Katie: No, I mean charlotte.", "Wyatt: Uh...hey.", "Charlotte: Wyatt, hey. Pam said she thought she saw you. But how was monaco? I so wish I could've tagged along.", "Wyatt: [ Laughs ] Yeah...", "Katie: Yeah. I'm sure.", "Wyatt: Hey, uh... I know you're concerned about your grandfather. I am, too. But... thomas flying to new york to be with caroline and douglas, wh-- what's going on there?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Uh, I'm not sure.

Like, spectra needs him to design, otherwise they're... going nowhere.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Another good reason for him to stay in new york.

What [Stammers] I'm supposed to just disappear?", "Steffy: [ Scoffs ] Must you be so dramatic?", "Charlie: [ Sighs ]", "Sheila: All I said was eric went to see quinn... and that he's asking for a divorce, hopefully.", "Charlie: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did he actually say that's what he was going to do?", "Sheila: What other choice does he have? She made a mockery of their marriage, and with his son nonetheless. Now, I'm not a betting woman, but if I were, I'd say quinn doesn't have a prayer of holding on to eric.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: What if we see a marriage counselor? Someone who can help us work through this? We have to try. We can't give up, not over a few stupid kisses.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: But it was more than that, quinn! You and ridge could not help yourselves. That's what you told me. I think that's all I need to know, isn't it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: ...And then my dad names himself the winner.", "Charlotte: [ Giggles ] Well, do you need me to get you anything, like coffee or pam's lemon bars?", "Wyatt: Oh, she's still making those things?", "Charlotte: [ Giggles ] [ Cellphone chimes ] Oh!

I got to go. But I'm glad you're home. See you, guys.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Bye, baby.", "Ridge: See you.", "Steffy: So, how did you leave things with granddad?", "Ridge: It's more about how your granddad left things with me. This is worse than it's ever been. He said I'm no longer his son.", "Steffy: Can you blame him?", "Ridge: Come on.", "Steffy: Okay, he's hurt. And I'm sure he doesn't mean it, dad.", "Ridge: Yeah, this is, uh... this is a tough one. This is gonna be a tough one to -- to move past. Especially with sheila sitting there fanning the flames. She is dangerous, steffy. More dangerous than she ever was.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: All right, look. Look, I-I-I'm not a big fan of quinn's, either, but, you know, it's eric's life. It's his marriage. You should stay out of it.", "Sheila: What did you say?", "Charlie: I said it's eric's life. Don't -- don't interfere.", "Sheila: I'm not interfering! I'm a good friend!", "Charlie: Okay, fine. Whatever. You know, my point was just that --", "Sheila: Well, you know, here's my point -- unless you want your precious little pammy to know that you told me all about quinn and ridge --", "Charlie: Hold it right there! My god, that sounds like a threat.", "Sheila: You know what? You call it whatever you want, because I'm not gonna have some two-bit security guard telling me what's best for eric. I know what's best for eric. I know because I was his wife once.", "Charlie: Oh... and you want to be again, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: [ Sighs ] I've been... playing this moment in my head over and over. You walking through the door... coming home. [ Sighs ] I-I-I've been wondering where you are and if you're all right --", "Eric: I'm all right. I'm all right. You can see that.", "Quinn: But you're not all right. You're still hurting, and you are so angry --", "Eric: No. No, I let the anger go quite a while ago. I just want to get on with my life.", "Quinn: Without me? Without wondering why this has happened?", "Eric: Look, understanding why is only important if you're gonna work on the marriage, and we're not.", "Quinn: Don't say that. Don't say that! It doesn't have to be over if we don't let it be. I will do anything -- anything that you ask. Just please... please, eric, don't let this be the end.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: That's funny. You know, I-I didn't realize that there was a \"you and me.\"", "Wyatt: [ Chuckles ] I did. When, you know -- when we kissed.", "Katie: [ Sighs ] We shared a few kisses.", "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.", "Katie: It was -- it was cute.", "Wyatt: Cu-- \"cute\"?", "Katie: Yep.", "Wyatt: Did you just say \"cute\"?", "Katie: Yes, that's what I said.", "Wyatt: I mean...", "Katie: I mean, how would you describe it?", "Wyatt: Hot. Sexy. Hot.", "Katie: You said that twice.", "Wyatt: Yeah. I know. I did.", "Katie: No. Mnh-mnh. No, no.", "Wyatt: What do you mean, \"no\"? I thought we were having fun.", "Katie: Listen, I, um... I don't want to mislead you, but the two of us making out like a bunch of teenagers, it's -- it's ridiculous. It's silly.", "Wyatt: Oh, so you're saying you're just -- you're not allowed to have fun?", "Katie: You're a great guy.", "Wyatt: Mm.", "Katie: But you should really find someone else. And so should I.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: So, is that what you're thinking? That you were mrs. Eric forrester once, and you can be again? Because I got news for you, sheila -- I don't think that's gonna happen.", "Sheila: Shouldn't you be leaving?", "[ Knock on door ]", "Beatrice: Sheila?", "Sheila: Yes.", "Beatrice: Beatrice. I'm a little early for the appointment.", "Sheila: No, that's quite all right. Please, come in. You did say that I could pay by credit card, right?", "Beatrice: Certainly. This will do. I'll start setting up.", "Sheila: Okay. I-I'll -- I'll be right with you.", "Charlie: Who's that?", "Sheila: Didn't I tell you to leave?", "Charlie: You're up to something. And I'm gonna find out what it is.", "Sheila: Over my dead body... or yours.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Chuckles ] [ Laughing ] Oh, charlie.", "Eric: You had to know this was a real possibility, quinn. That, in spite of my big heart that everybody likes to say i have, what you and ridge did --", "Quinn: What ridge and I did was foolish. It was reckless. It was utterly selfish. It's not like we even were in love with each other. We barely even like each other. Every time it happened, we didn't even understand why, we just -- we just --", "Eric: You just gave in to it! The two of you gave in to it. That's what you did. It's what the two of you always do, the consequences be damned.", "Quinn: I would undo this if I could in a second. I just -- I want you to believe in me again, in -- in -- in my love for you the way you used to.", "Eric: I don't -- I don't question -- I don'T... I don't question your love. Anybody who's shared the intimacy we have would never question our love. No. But marriage is more than that, quinn. It's trust and -- and... and loyalty and commitment.", "Quinn: I am committed to you! I'm committed to you. I'm committed to -- to repairing this, to fixing what's broken.", "Eric: What's broken? What you broke! What you and ridge broke! It'd be bad enough if it was some other man. But that's my son. It was my son! How the hell do you ever fix that?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Okay, let me get this straight. You're dumping me? Is that what's going on?", "Katie: [ Laughs ] No, no. I am not dumping you, because we are not dating.", "Wyatt: This is true. But a date's not a bad idea. Let's go out tonight -- have dinner, go to a club, maybe do some dancing.", "Katie: See, I have responsibilities. I have a little boy that I have to tuck in at night. And I enjoy that. I cannot be out till all hours.", "Wyatt: Right. So tuck him in. Find a sitter. Problem solved.", "Katie: You're terrible.", "Wyatt: I'm just trying to show you that whatever obstacles you think are in your way, they don't have to be. Look, we can either leave those kisses in monaco -- and on the plane -- or... maybe we explore them and just keep having fun. I mean, don't -- don't you owe it -- don't we owe it to ourselves to just, I don't know... see what happens?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Sheila's taken advantage, using this whole situation to worm her way back into granddad's life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Oh, I agree. I can see it. But the good news is that my father has agreed to talk to quinn. Here's what I don't get -- how did sheila find out about quinn and me, anyway? It wasn't brooke. It wasn't katie or ivy. So who would talk to sheila carter, of all people?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Sitar music playing ]", "Beatrice: Oh, oh. Please, sir. This side. I need my space.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: Oh. So, uh, sheila, you -- you never answered me. Are you expecting to become mrs. Eric forrester again?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I know we have a lot to work through. Maybe it's insurmountable. D-don't we... owe it to our marriage... to at least try? A marriage that we fought so hard for. A marriage that nobody wanted to accept. The odds were stacked against us right from the very beginning, but... slowly your family started to realize what... what we already knew -- that the world's unlikeliest couple were really good for each other. And we can be again if -- if we just... if we just don't take the easy way out.", "Eric: Divorce is not \"the easy way out.\" These have been sleepless nights for me. The time I've been gone has been... agony trying to figure out what to do about this.", "Quinn: I know. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I-I-I didn't mean to imply that this was easy. I-I'm sorry, it just -- it upsets me so much to know that when you were making such an important decision about our lives that you were with sheila of all people --", "Eric: Oh, sheila -- sheila had nothing to do with this.", "Quinn: Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Please. Eric, please, just come home. This is your home. If you don't want me here, I'll leave. Eric, you are just... you're such a good, decent man. Your capacity for forgiveness and understanding is more than anyone I've ever known. Which is why I believe, despite your reason for coming here today... you can find it in -- you can find it in your heart to forgive me one last time. I know it won't be easy. I know you have to learn to -- to trust me again. But before I lost my way, I was a loyal, faithful wife to you, devoted to you and this marriage, and I can be again -- I will be again, from this day forward. Just -- just -- just don't divorce me. Don't end what we could have again. I-I believe in the strength of our love. I believe in its power to endure and overcome and... and I think you do, too. Please. Please, please, please tell me you do, too."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv3TGVYaKM0"}
