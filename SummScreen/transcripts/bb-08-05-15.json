        "Caroline tries to do a little sketching at home but is a little down. Ridge says he is sorry. He knows there is nothing happy about getting a divorce. She says she knows and both she and Rick have moved on in new relationships and are happier now, so she should have expected this. It's just hard to let go of this vision for what she had planned for her life. He jokes she can look on the bright side \u0096 he no longer is sleeping with a married woman. Brooke confides in Thomas that Ridge can be pretty intense at times but she is glad he apologized to Thomas. Ridge pushes those he loves to do their best. Thomas just wonders if he has Caroline's best interest at heart. And if being involved with his dad is her smartest move but maybe he is just being too protective. He comments Ridge leaves women .he did it to Brooke and he did it to his own mother. He doesn't want to see Caroline get hurt like that. Brooke makes mention that perhaps he has feelings too for Caroline. Thomas laughs that off and says he remembers when she first came to town and they dated for a while but then moved on. Brooke says but she is not married now. Thomas says that would be going after the woman that his dad is with. That is nasty, he would not do that game. Brooke assures him that Ridge has grown a lot in the last few years. He has had a few major impacts on his life. Thomas hopes so as Caroline is special and does not deserve another heartbreak in her life. She deserves a guy who will stick around. Brooke says but Ridge is supportive and he would never keep her from doing what she wanted. Thomas says that is the fantasy and adventure but then it starts to turn and goes away and leaves her in tears.",
        "Nicole and Othello are talking in the showroom. She jokes how the models walk like zombies with no expressions. Othello dares her to get up there on the catwalk and do her stuff then. He turns the music on and she starts but it turns into more of just wild dance moves like in a club. Zende walks up and surprises her by joining in. Then Othello changes the mix board to a slower song and leaves them under the disco ball. Nicole comments that she went to her prom. Zende didn't but says it is never too late. He asks Nicole to dance and she can't wait. He is not sure about her leading but she says get used to it. Ridge suggests that he and Caroline get more comfortable and they end up eating in bed. He says what more can she possibly want. She catches him off guard when she says she would like a baby. It is something that she has been thinking about for a while. He is honest and isn't sure he wants to share her with anyone else. He has a family. She knows but she still wants her own child. She likes seeing him be a dad to his own kids. He mentions just wanting to live in the moment. She says she always knew this age difference might come into it. And if it came between a child or choosing Ridge, he would always win. She kisses him and they hold hands, but still she cries."

        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. There's nothing easy about getting divorced.",
        "Caroline: I know. I know that Rick and I are -- are both happier now. We've both moved on. We're both in new relationships. I think it's just... letting go of an idea, you know, letting go of the vision I had for -- for that life.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] On the bright side... I'm no longer sleeping with a married woman, so that's good.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: [Laughs] Oh. I had an idea. Why don't we slip into something a little more comfortable?",

        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Brooke: Ridge can be intense at times.",
        "Thomas: Who, Dad? No.",
        "Brooke: I'm glad he apologized for ripping up your design.",
        "Thomas: Well, yeah, I think he realized it was a bit harsh and unwarranted.",
        "Brooke: He's hard on you, and he pushes you, because he wants the best for you. That's what he does for people he loves.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, for the most part. I just wonder if he really does have Caroline's best interests at heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Got the melodies, worked out some lyrics. I just need you to help me turn them into hits.",
        "Othello: [Chuckles] Look at you, girl. Little renaissance woman. You're a singer, you're a dancer, aspiring model.",
        "Nicole: Aspiring? Honey, I am a model.",
        "Othello: Selfies in front of the bathroom mirror -- they don't really count.",
        "Nicole: Ha. Very funny.",
        "Othello: [Chuckles] Who's joking? I've seen your profile.",
        "Nicole: Ooh, harsh.",
        "Othello: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Okay, but have you ever noticed how serious models are when they're walking down the runway? Like, I mean, I get it. You're supposed to be expressionless, showing off the clothes, blah, blah, blah. But walking straight down the runway staring straight ahead like a zombie -- I mean, no offense to them, but if I were up there, I'd put on a real show.",
        "Othello: Oh, really?",
        "Nicole: Yep.",
        "Othello: Fine. Get up there, then.",
        "Nicole: Right now?",
        "Othello: Yeah, unless you're all talk.",
        "Nicole: Ooh. Watch and learn, my friend. You're about to get schooled.",
        "Othello: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Give me some beats. Now, this is how it should be done.",
        "Othello: Ladies and gentlemen, making her international debut exclusively here on Forrester runway for one night only, please give it up for Forrester's lead model, Miss Nicole Avant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: What do you mean?",
        "Thomas: Well, Dad can't know what's right for everyone, okay? Nobody can.",
        "Brooke: But you mentioned Caroline specifically.",
        "Thomas: Well, yeah, maybe I'm just being overly protective. Okay, I just question if being involved with Dad is the smartest move for Caroline. I think you and I both know the answer to that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: This is exactly what I needed. Can we just lie here all day and pretend that we have no responsibilities and that there's nothing else in the world that's happening at all?",
        "Ridge: We can stay here as long as you want.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: I know it's hard. It's a lot to process.",
        "Caroline: You know, it's not so much that I'm saying goodbye to the marriage. I think it's more that I'm letting go of the plans that I made for myself, you know. I am so grateful for all the good things, you know, especially you. I just... I don't think that I saw myself being here at this stage in my life. I think I just always thought I'd be more settled and -- and sure of my future.",
        "Ridge: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're in Venice Beach with your handsome prince. We got champagne and grapes and some kind of a cheese product. What else could you possibly want?",
        "Caroline: I want to have a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Singer: It's time for us to celebrate to enjoy all the things that make us really great from ocean to ocean it's just another year of freedom and liberty the time is finally here let's rock it rock it",
        "Othello: [Laughs] Oh, yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, we got a special guest. Joining Nicole on stage, give it up for Zende!",
        "Singer: Let's rock it rock it bang, boom, kapow it's time",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I want to work with Dad, become a vital part of the company, okay? And I'm grateful for every opportunity that he's given me. That's not the issue.",
        "Brooke: The issue is Caroline?",
        "Thomas: It just concerns me that someone as positive and as beautiful as Caroline, you know, who just survived a horrific car accident and went through this really painful divorce is almost guaranteed to get her heart broken again.",
        "Brooke: I wasn't a fan of the relationship in the beginning, but I have to admit I could see how they could be a good couple. I don't know why you're not giving them a chance.",
        "Thomas: He ends things, Brooke. That's what he does. I saw him do it with you. I saw him do it with Mom. I don't want to see the same thing happen with Caroline. What?",
        "Brooke: Is this really about your father?",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] I mean, did you not hear what I just said?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I did hear. But I'm wondering if you're having some feelings for Caroline.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] I caught you off guard.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, you could say that.",
        "Caroline: Just kind of, um... [Clears throat] It's something I've been thinking about.",
        "Ridge: Yeah? For how long?",
        "Caroline: 20 years or so.",
        "Ridge: Oh, so it's recent.",
        "Caroline: I know that it's... I know it's a lot to digest, and I kind of just dropped a huge bomb on you, and you're probably not sure what to say.",
        "Ridge: Why -- why can't we just... why can't we just be in the moment, you know?",
        "Caroline: We've been in the moment.",
        "Ridge: I know, and I love the moment, and I love you. And you're my girl. You're it for me. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.",
        "Caroline: I want that, too. But what about... starting a family together?",
        "Ridge: I've had a family. Now all I want is a life with you. I don't want to share you with anyone. I just want us to be together, you know, the life -- this life, you and me.",
        "Caroline: I understand. I do. I've always admired the father that you are, you know? You're -- the way that you are with your kids and... I still want to have my own child, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Why did you stop the music? We were having fun.",
        "Othello: Chill. Can I say hi to the man?",
        "Zende: Othello, what's up, man?",
        "Othello: Oh, man, it's good to have you back in California.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles]",
        "Othello: Don't be leaving us for Miami any time soon.",
        "Zende: No, I think I got a few reasons to stay.",
        "Nicole: LA is where it's at. I keep telling people. Where else you gonna get this type of entertainment -- and for free? Seriously, do you guys know how lucky you are? I mean, when I'm a famous supermodel/music artist, you're gonna be, like, you knew me when.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles]",
        "Othello: We got a live one here.",
        "Zende: You know, that's what I dig about her.",
        "Othello: And now for the showstopper.",
        "Singer: La, la-la, la, la la, la-la, la, la la, la-la, la, la-la-la la-da, ta, ta, ta, da la, la-la, la, la hey-ey-ey la, la-la, la, la la, la-la, la, la-la- la",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Feelings? [Scoffs]",
        "Brooke: You're right. None of my business.",
        "Thomas: I'm just concerned for Caroline, okay? I don't want to see her get disappointed by my dad.",
        "Brooke: I didn't mean to put you on the spot. But it just seemed like there was something more. Am I wrong?",
        "Thomas: [Clears throat]",
        "Brooke: I know that you were interested in Caroline when she first came to Los Angeles.",
        "Thomas: That was awhile ago, okay? We dated for a minute, and she moved on, I moved on.",
        "Brooke: Is there any part of you that would want to be with Caroline again? Especially now that she's not married?",
        "Thomas: You mean go after the woman that my dad's with? No, I don't play that. That's Dad's game. Not mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Guess we never really talked about it before.",
        "Caroline: [Sniffles] Well, we were just busy having fun, you know, and getting to know each other and... God, and we were dealing with everything. Dealing with Rick and everything at work and... [Sighs] It kind of felt like... now would be a good time to start at least talking about it. And I know that it's so, so overwhelming because, trust me, the idea of being a mother absolutely terrifies me, but... [Voice breaking] The idea of not getting to be one really scares me.",
        "Ridge: I completely understand that. And I think... you would make a wonderful mother.",
        "Caroline: Thank you for saying that.",
        "Ridge: Well, I mean it.",
        "Caroline: I think just the accident really put things in perspective for me, you know? I'm just so grateful for every day and for every little moment, you know? But... before you know it, five years passes by and then -- and then 10 and... and I think that's when you start thinking about, like... the things that you wish you would have done and how much you wish you would have had, and I know, for me...that's a family. And I see you with your kids, and I see how important they are to you and -- and how much joy they bring you and... I really want that. I mean, is that something you would consider? Would you consider having... would you consider having a child with me? [Sniffles]",
        "Ridge: If I were 20 years younger, I would have a thousand children with you. I just... I can't see myself being a father again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: The disco ball is an interesting touch, right?",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] Yeah. This reminds me of my high school prom. [Laughs] They dimmed the lights, put on a cheesy slow jam, and then all of the teachers were scouting, trying to make sure nobody got too freaky.",
        "Zende: Ooh. They didn't have to worry about Nicole, though, right?",
        "Nicole: Oh, no, of course not. I mean, I was an absolute angel.",
        "Zende: Ooh, I bet. I bet you were.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] We did not have a disco ball, though. My school was kind of low budget. You have one at yours?",
        "Zende: I wouldn't know.",
        "Nicole: Oh, too cool to notice?",
        "Zende: No. I didn't go.",
        "Nicole: You didn't go to prom?",
        "Zende: Nope. But it's never too late. May I?",
        "Nicole: Thought you'd never ask.",
        "Singer: From all the games the world is playing I'm on my knees and when I'm near you, skies are clear",
        "Zende: What? Who's leading here? Me or you?",
        "Nicole: Me. Get used to it.",
        "Zende: [Laughs]",
        "Singer: Reason for words because I'm too far gone I'd be lost without you and loving you could never feel wrong",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I don't want to hurt you. That's the last thing I'd ever want.",
        "Caroline: I know that.",
        "Ridge: Hey, I-I want your life to be fulfilled. I want you to have everything that you ever wanted. If I lose you, that's... that's gonna kill me.",
        "Caroline: I don't want to lose you, either.",
        "Ridge: So what do we do?",
        "Caroline: I really want a child. I want to be a mother. [Sniffles] You know, and I know going into this that there was an age difference and that -- that we had different life experiences, and [Sniffles] -- And I really don't want you to think this is an ultimatum, because that's not what it's supposed to be. I don't want you to think that you've led me on or... 'cause you've always been honest. [Sniffles] And I think that if I'm being honest with myself, a part of me always knew that you felt this way. But if there is any chance that, even the slightest chance that the door might be open, I just had to know. And I'm realizing now that it's -- it's not. [Sniffles] And it's hard for me to hear. But if I have to choose between being a mom and being with you... ...I'm gonna always choose you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Your father's grown in the last few years. His helicopter accident, difficulty recovering -- it's really been very humbling. It's made an impact on his life. So you might be surprised. He and Caroline might end up together for a very long time.",
        "Thomas: I hope you're right. I do. Caroline's special. You know, she's one of the most extraordinary women that I have ever met. She deserves some stability in her life, you know, a guy who will stick around, let her shine and be whoever she wants to be.",
        "Brooke: Ridge respects her. He supports her. He would never keep her from doing something she wanted to do.",
        "Thomas: That's the fantasy. The adventure. And then it all starts to turn, and it all ends the same way. It ends in tears.",
