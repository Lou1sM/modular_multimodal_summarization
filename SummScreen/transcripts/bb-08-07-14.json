        "Hope and Wyatt stroll through Paris. They sit on a bench with the Eiffel Tower in background. He tells her these are truly icons, her and the Eiffel Tower and they are going to truly take Paris by storm. She looks over her shoulder and says yes it is a trip they will never forget. He seems to sense what she is thinking and asks if she really thinks Liam is going to show. Liam is at Spencer's and Alison hands him his first class tickets on commercial since the Spencer jet is out of the country. Pam surprises Ivy by saying it is here \u0096 her work permit to stay in the states. She can now go to Paris. Aly tells Oliver that Paris would have been fun but she is okay; she'd rather be there with him. She says besides Rick and Hope are in Paris and her dad and Taylor are on vacation so somebody has to be in charge around here. Oliver says then he is dating the boss and he kind of likes that. He says the showing will be live streaming so it will be sort of like they are in Paris only they aren't. There is a lot riding on this photo shoot. The whole world is watching. Felicia verifies to Rick that the shoot is on lockdown, everything is set. So now they just need Hope and Wyatt. Right on cue, they stroll in. Hope introduces Felicia to Wyatt who says he is happy to see her again. They are unbelievably excited about tomorrow and Wyatt just hopes there are no distractions. Liam calls Ivy and says he just wanted her to know that he is taking her advice and will be flying to Paris. She's happy; says she wishes she were going but her work permit just came through a little too late. He says no; he is heading to LAX right now so he can get Alison to get her a ticket too. She says he can fax her the details and she will meet him at the airport. Quinn calls Wyatt to see how the day is going. He says not that well. Hope invited Liam to meet her there. He's not here yet. She says he just gave Hope the diamond so Wyatt can't lose the girl and the rock too. He says forget what he just said and whatever she does, just stay away from Liam. He wants to be clear on that. Quinn smiles and says yes loud and clear. When Hope asks, Wyatt fibs and says it was only someone from his warehouse and he did not want to deal with it right now. Hope thanks Felicia for filling in for Thorne and pulling this together so fast. Wyatt says the diamond has been magic in the past and it will again in Paris. There is no telling what kind of magic it is capable of.",
        "Pam helps Ivy pack. Although she is not going, Aly is delighted to hear that Ivy is going and meeting Liam and that he is going to be with Hope in Paris. They say goodbye and the last thing Aly tells Ivy is to make sure Liam gets to Hope. As Liam drives off from the parking lot, Quinn is hiding behind another car close by. She is disguised all in black with sunshades and a scarf around her head. Aly gushes to Oliver about how dreamy it is that Liam is going to Paris. Oliver says he likes Liam but he is not lucky in the good luck department. It is always one thing or the other with him. Aly tells him to bite his tongue. Nothing bad is going to happen in Paris. She has a lot of faith in them and she is going to plan a party for them when they get back. Felicia brings up Ricardo and why he left the diamond to Wyatt who is not a relative. Hope jumps in and says Ricardo knew how much Wyatt appreciated the diamond. Felicia also asks if Quinn had known Ricardo for long ..so Wyatt might say his mother was instrumental in him getting the diamond. She doesn't want to make Wyatt uncomfortable but she asks where his mother is now. She heard she attacked Liam. Again Hope jumps in and says Quinn went through a really bad time but she is seeking help and they are all glad she has taken that step. Oliver has Aly close her eyes and he guides her to a seat where he has displayed a gorgeous romantic French dinner ..since they could not go to Paris he brought it here. He says Liam is not the only romantic one. She says he will always be her knight in shining armor. Liam boards first but is waiting for Ivy who soon joins. Both are bubbling over about this trip. Just behind them is Quinn in her disguise reading a magazine. Ivy tells Liam that she thinks he is making the right decision. He laments yeah once he got over his huge ego, making this decision was easy. He says Hope has no idea he is coming. They have this special place and are to meet at 3 P. M. close to the Eiffel Tower. Hope has her ring and he has his and he plans to put it on her and they will be married in Paris. Quinn frowns at this. Hope and Wyatt stroll again along the Seine River. They are gushing about tomorrow but then he stops and tells her to do him a favor and not let Liam ruin this adventure for her. He always does. It's always complicated with him and always will be. If he doesn't show up then get out with her dignity still in tact. Just cut Liam loose. He scoffs that he has already given her the diamond and he doesn't want to take it back. She would never have to wonder where she stood with him. She means everything to him. He states that if Liam doesn't show up, he wants to make Hope his."

It's brought us plenty of good fortune so far in the past, and it will again. In Paris. I mean, the most vibrant, passionate city in the world. There's no telling what kind of magic that it's capable of.",

        "Aly: Guess what? Liam is going to Paris!",
        "Oliver: Oh! Great.",
        "Aly: How can you not even be the slightest bit excited? It's so romantic. Liam hopping on a plane, flying all the way to Paris to get the girl. So dreamy it hurts.",
        "Oliver: If he makes it.",
        "Aly: Why would you say that?",
        "Oliver: I like Liam. I do. But that guy -- he just hasn't gotten any luck lately. If it's not one thing, it's --",
        "Aly: What could possibly go wrong? Quinn is locked away somewhere and Steffy is totally out of the picture.",
        "Oliver: Steffy lives in Paris.",
        "Aly: She's not an issue anymore, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: All right, well, what could go wrong? Nothing.",
        "Aly: Nothing.",
        "Oliver: Except a late flight, bad weather, Parisian traffic.",
        "Aly: Okay, bite your tongue. Nothing bad is going to happen in Paris. It's finally going to work out for hope and Liam.",
        "Oliver: You and your happy endings. And what if it doesn't turn out that way?",
        "Aly: Well, unlike some people, I have a lot of faith in hope and Liam, and I'm going to plan a party for them when they get back.",
        "Felicia: So, Mr. Montemayor left you the diamond in his will?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Surprised me just as much as everybody else.",
        "Rick: I could imagine. I didn't realize you guys were so close.",
        "Hope: Well, Ricardo didn't have any living relatives, and he knew how much the diamond meant to Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: And I always promised hope that I was gonna give it to her some day.",
        "Felicia: Quite an extravagant gift.",
        "Hope: Beyond.",
        "Rick: So Quinn and Ricardo -- they've known each other for a long time.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Long time. A few years.",
        "Felicia: Oh. So you have your mother to thank for that diamond.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. What do you mean?",
        "Rick: I think what she's saying is that you would never have the diamond if Quinn hadn't introduced you to Ricardo.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, right. Yeah. That's very true. Yeah.",
        "Felicia: Where is your mother these days? I don't mean to make you feel uncomfortable or anything, but I heard rumors that she attacked Liam?",
        "Hope: You know, Quinn went through a really difficult time, and now she's getting the help she needs. And we're all really happy that she's taking that step. Can I get you anything, monsieur?",
        "Liam: Uh, no, thank you. One more glance outside the window you're feeling helpless, I can tell I don't have an answer for everything over and under and in between, but, oh, I know you like I know myself and I can't help but thinking, well, look at us you can see we're no superheroes, but I'd save you if you could save me from all this gravity I'm all right I believe I'll be flying in no time hang on tight it's just you and me and all this gravity, yeah it's all this gravity",
        "Ivy: Hi.",
        "Liam: Ivy! Oh, my God! You made it.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I know. Not a moment to spare.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Whew! Can't believe I actually made it.",
        "Liam: Yeah, like, way to rally last minute. I'm super impressed. Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the \"fasten seatbelt\" sign. If you will please have a seat and make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened.",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Liam: Not kidding. Like, really last minute, right?",
        "Ivy: I know.",
        "Liam: Wow.",
        "Ivy: Hey. Thank you so much for making this all happen. I'm so excited! We're actually going to Paris!",
        "Liam: I know. It's happening.",
        "Ivy: It's gonna be so memorable, this trip, I can just feel it.",
        "Liam: I think you're right.",
        "Aly: What's going on?",
        "Oliver: All right. Stop. Open.",
        "Aly: [Gasps] Oh, my gosh.",
        "Oliver: Since we couldn't go to France, I brought it to you.",
        "Aly: Oh, my gosh, Oliver. [Chuckles] What a nice surprise.",
        "Oliver: [French accent] For mademoiselle, we have Portobello mushroom with b\u00e9arnaise sauce and, your favorite, white truffle pommes frites.",
        "Aly: You are too good to me.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Liam is not the only romantic guy around here. And I do have to admit the Eiffel tower is tough to beat.",
        "Aly: Nothing could ever top what you did in the jousting ring.",
        "Oliver: I was pretty good.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles]",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "[Fanfare]",
        "Aly: That is a moment I will never forget. It was so chivalrous. A lost art nowadays.",
        "Oliver: I had to prove to you how much you mean to me.",
        "Aly: You know, you looked pretty handsome as a knight.",
        "Oliver: Well, I'm pretty tight with those guys now. I can probably get them to let me borrow the costume.",
        "Aly: You don't need it. You will always be my knight in shining armor. Just like Liam is hope's knight in shining armor.",
        "Oliver: How did I know you were gonna say that?",
        "Aly: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: To Paris.",
        "Ivy: Yes, and to making good decisions.",
        "Liam: Ooh. I'll drink to that.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Thank you so much for the wise counsel, by the way.",
        "Ivy: No, look, I think you're making the right decision, Liam. It's obvious how much you love hope.",
        "Liam: Once I got over myself and my huge ego, that decision became pretty -- pretty easy. Thing is, I don't want to lose hope. If I don't show up, that's exactly what's gonna happen, so...",
        "Ivy: Well, it's a good thing you're on this plane, then.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: So, tell me.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Does hope know that you're on your way?",
        "Liam: I'm surprising her. No, she has no idea whether I'm coming or not. There's this special place we have. It's near the Eiffel tower, so I'm supposed to meet her there at 3:00 P.M. Sharp. She's gonna be wearing her ring, and I will put on mine. And here's the coup de gr\u00e2ce. Are you ready? I plan on marrying her in Paris.",
        "Hope: Look at the trocad\u00e9ro gardens. And this fountain -- everything about this place is stunning.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. And just think about tomorrow. All right? You up on stage, looking gorgeous as ever. The diamond just blinding everyone in the sunlight. And the reporters all here to see you and that diamond.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I think it's gonna be a success.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. Here it is. Le tour Eiffel.",
        "Hope: She is magnificent.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] An iconic landmark, an iconic diamond, an iconic woman. We'll make history. Okay, that diamond that has already been good to us I believe will change our lives again.",
        "Hope: And I couldn't imagine a more special place.",
        "Wyatt: Hope, can you do me a favor? Don't let Liam ruin this adventure for you. Look, all he does is make you upset. It's always so complicated with him, and it always will be. If he's not there, if he doesn't show up... get out with your dignity in tact. Cut him loose. Hell, I've already given you a diamond. I -- I don't want to take it back.",
        "Hope: [Chuckling] Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: No, I'm just saying, you never, ever have to question where you stand with me.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Look, you mean everything to me. If he doesn't show up... I want to make you mine."
