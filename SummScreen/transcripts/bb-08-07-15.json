        "The Forrester house is all abuzz with festivities. Even Bridget comes home and surprises them. Maya can not believe this is really happening, she is getting married. Rick introduces Vivienne and Julius to Bridget. She in turn hugs Zende. She says he sure has grown up since she has seen him. Katie and Bill walk in, but Rick balks at that. He tells Bill no, he is not invited or welcome here. Katie asks him to let him stay, Bill has something to say. Bill says he is not here to bash Maya. He is really here to apologize to her and would like to stay for the wedding. Rick listens and says that will be up to Maya. She initially says no but Bill steps forward and says they are going to be part of an extended family so they need to put their feelings aside and accept each other. He made a business decision and went in for the kill without giving Maya consideration how it would affect her. That was his mistake. He hopes she will be man enough to forgive him. She says it was cruel and unnecessary but she can not change other people's minds, so yes she will accept his apology. He can then see first hand how happy they are and how he can never scare her again. Rick tells her that he is so proud of her. Maya reminds Nick about when they first met and she was just starting on this journey and now she is a bride.",
        "Vivienne pulls Julius away before he can embarrass himself even more. He asks Zende if he really wants to make women's clothes. She tells him to please keep his negative thoughts to himself. It is a family business of long standing and they are proud of it. He has no right to put them down. Vivienne goes upstairs to be with Maya and says she came to help but she sees now she is fine and looks flawless. Still she would like to give her something if Maya will have it .a bracelet from her mother. Maya is thrilled. Nicole makes a point to her father to be on his best behavior. He still makes a remark about his daughter and him walking her down the aisle. Alone with Vivienne but with Maya on the banister looking down and hearing it, Julius has venom in his voice when he says this is not right. He will say all the right things today but he can not accept it. These rich people are all alike and he does not believe this marriage will last. Rick could have any woman he wants and it won't be long before he will want a real woman and not the man they raised. It is not natural and he will never accept this. Maya is crushed."

        "Nicole: Didn't anybody ever tell you that the bridesmaids are supposed to look hideous?",
        "Maya: Not when the bride and groom work for Forrester Creations.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I thought you said you couldn't get time off.",
        "Bridget: I had to make it work. I was not about to miss one more family event.",
        "Eric: Well, if you'd just be sensible and move back...",
        "Bridget: I know. I know, Dad. But I do think about it.",

        "Bridget: Oh, it's Bridget. It's lovely to meet you both.",
        "Vivienne: Likewise. Are you in the fashion business, too?",
        "Bridget: Oh, I've dabbled.",

        "Maya: You know, Mama used to volunteer at church potlucks.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, setting up in the basement.",
        "Maya: So, you know sometimes the potlucks were for weddings. And every time they were, I would ask to go. And I'd help out for a little while, setting up chairs, whatever. But, eventually, I would sneak off and go looking for the bride. And I was always blown away. Seeing the bride and how nervous and excited and joyful she was -- and I was fascinated. And I knew -- I knew -- that someday I wanted that, too. So, yeah... this is what I have been picturing for a very long time.",

        "Bridget: Oh, it's so good to see you, Zende!",
        "Zende: Likewise.",

        "Zen: Really? No. No.",
        "Brooke: Kids do grow up fast. You'll know soon enough.",
        "Bridget: Okay, Mom. Don't make me cry. I'm already emotional enough. This is Rick's wedding. I don't need the added element of my son's childhood passing me by. Oh, good! Tie's here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Get out. Turn right around, partner.",
        "Katie: Listen, I know that you don't want him here.",

        "Katie: Oh, no, no, no. You promised. You promised me. He has something he wants to say.",

        "Rick: This is your doing?",
        "Katie: No! No. I -- when have I ever been able to get him do something that he doesn't want to do?",
        "Bill: All right, look -- Rick, this is your wedding day. You're Katie's nephew. I'm not invited, and there's something wrong about that. I didn't consider all of the ramifications of publishing Maya's story. I should have. And I would like to express that to Maya. I would like to stay for the wedding... and show you both how much I respect the fact that you were able to withstand everything I threw at you and still make it to this day.",

        "Carter: I finally get to sit back and enjoy a wedding.",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rick: I know this is breaking all sorts of protocol. I've got my eyes closed.",
        "Maya: I'm not dressed. You're fine. It's not bad luck. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: We have a problem. We have an unexpected guest. I said that he could stay only if it's okay with you. All right! You can come in!",
        "Katie: Hi. Um...",
        "Maya: No. Not okay.",
        "Bill: I have something I want to say.",
        "Maya: On my wedding day?",
        "Bill: All right. Just stay with me here, all right? You're about to exchange vows with Rick. Rick is Katie's nephew. You're going to commit your lives to each other, which means that you and I are going to be part of the same extended family. So... what better time for me to apologize?",
        "Maya: Seriously?",
        "Bill: I don't want tension between us.",
        "Maya: Oh, no. I'm clear that you don't want tension and that you want me to shrug off what you did to me, to Rick, to the company that you own a portion of. What I'm asking is, are you seriously sorry?",
        "Bill: Of course.",
        "Maya: For what?",
        "Bill: The whole deal.",
        "Maya: Sold a lot of magazines. You sorry for that?",
        "Bill: I'm, um... [Sighs] No. No, I'm not. I'm in business to make money. I'm never unhappy to do so. I made a damn good business decision. But in this case, business crossed with personal, and what I could have done was ask you for an exclusive, an opportunity to express yourself, your story, in your own way. But I didn't do that. I smelled blood, and I-I went in for the kill... without giving full consideration to how that would affect you. That was... a mistake. And I'm man enough to admit it.",
        "Maya: And now you want me to be man enough to forgive you?",
        "Bill: Exactly. That's... cute. You almost got me there.",
        "Maya: Yeah. You almost got me, too. You almost got me to leave my job, my town, my fianc\u00e9. Your attack was cruel. It was unnecessary. But, you know, I've learned that hanging on to anger doesn't help anybody. So, yes. Yes. I accept your apology. Stay. Be a part of our celebration. Actually, I'm happy that you're gonna be here, because you'll get to see firsthand [Voice breaking] What we have and how you will never, ever scare me away. And [Chuckles] Now that we are gonna be in-laws, maybe somewhere down the line, I will give you that exclusive that you want.",
        "Bill: Really?",
        "Maya: Yeah. Yeah, so that your readers can get another version than the tabloid version of my story. Contingent, of course, on the fact that a large portion of the profits will go to the charity of my choosing.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm. We'll talk about that.",
        "Maya: Champagne's flowing.",
        "Rick: I'm so proud of you. He doesn't deserve forgiveness.",
        "Maya: Everybody does. So, then you'll call my mother up?",
        "Nick: For the first reading.",
        "Maya: Which is not the psalm anymore.",
        "Nick: It's the sonnet. I know. You told me -- twice.",
        "Maya: I did? I'm so sorry. Forgive me. I'm a little frazzled.",
        "Nick: It's okay. You're a bride. You're allowed.",
        "Maya: Do you remember when we first met?",
        "Nick: Yep.",
        "Maya: I was just starting on this journey, and now... I'm a bride. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: All right. There we go. Yeah.",
        "Rick: Good?",
        "Eric: Yeah. It's perfect now.",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Eric: It's all part of a best man's duties. You know, we can't have a crooked tie in the wedding pictures. You're wearing the watch, too, right now?",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah. Maya gets to do the \"something new, something blue\" bit. I want to do something special, as well, and what's more special than a gift from my father, my best man... the man who's always had my back, who supports me, loves me, and, of course, the man who straightens my tie.",
        "Eric: C'est moi.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] I love you, Dad.",
        "Eric: Love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: So, you really like the fashion business?",
        "Zende: Yeah, so far.",
        "Julius: Don't you think it's a little, you know...",
        "Zende: What?",
        "Julius: I mean, do you really want to make clothes for a living?",
        "Vivienne: Julius!",
        "Julius: Hmm?",
        "Vivienne: Can I speak to you a moment, please?",
        "Julius: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: On a scale of 1 to 10, how embarrassed should I be about my father just now?",
        "Zende: Well, uh, how does insulting my entire family business rank?",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] Great.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles] Don't worry about it. He's a dad. They were born to embarrass us.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: What? I say something wrong?",
        "Vivienne: No. I wanted to stop you before you did.",
        "Julius: Zende seems like a guy's guy, you know? I didn't think he'd be that excited about women's clothing.",
        "Vivienne: Oh. You mean like our son was? Is that what you mean? You told Maya you'd try.",
        "Julius: I am trying.",
        "Vivienne: Well, then, try harder. Today is her wedding day.",
        "Julius: Oh, yippee. I can't wait to see our son skipping down the aisle.",
        "Vivienne: Julius!",
        "Julius: Vivienne, you know how I feel about this. I don't agree with what Myron did. I don't think people should be messing with nature. It's just wrong. People shouldn't be doing it.",
        "Vivienne: Well, she did, okay? And she's our child. I know this is hard for you to embrace the idea right away. I certainly struggle with it. Listen, all I'm asking is that you keep your negative comments to yourself. I don't want you ruining her wedding day.",
        "Julius: I don't want that, either.",
        "Vivienne: Good! Thank you! I'm going upstairs to wish our daughter luck. Would you care to join me?",
        "Julius: No. You go ahead.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Maya: Come in.",
        "Vivienne: [Gasps] You're beautiful.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Vivienne: [Chuckles] I feel silly now.",
        "Maya: Why?",
        "Vivienne: 'Cause I came up here thinking that I'd give you something to wear for the ceremony, but look at you. You're flawless.",
        "Maya: Mom, stop.",
        "Vivienne: No, you are. But I would still like you to have this, if you're willing to wear it.",
        "Maya: [Gasps] Grandma's bracelet.",
        "Vivienne: You remember.",
        "Maya: Of course! She wore it to every special occasion.",
        "Vivienne: Well, I thought this qualified for one.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nicole: It's time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You ready to walk your girl down the aisle?",
        "Julius: As ready as I'm ever gonna be. And, you know, if you did the ceremony quickly, we could still have time to play nine holes before it got dark.",
        "Nick: I think we better hold off on that. We don't want to miss the reception, and, anyway, I can't have Maya coming after me for you missing the father- daughter dance.",
        "Julius: Oh, yeah. Can't have that.",
        "Nicole: Maya's good to go.",
        "Nick: Okay! I'll get people in their seats.",
        "Vivienne: Whew!",
        "Nicole: Everything okay?",
        "Julius: You know, I expected one day to walk you down an aisle, but this -- this is -- this is something to adjust to.",
        "Nicole: Just be happy for her. It's as simple as that. Then you'll see that it doesn't take much adjusting at all.",
        "Vivienne: She's got a point.",
        "Julius: You know, I hear this a lot -- \"be happy, be happy\" -- like there's a switch that I can just flip on and off.",
        "Vivienne: Oh, you can get through this.",
        "Julius: I want to get through this. I really, really do. I mean, look at this place... this family. It should be easy for us to be happy for our child... for all the good that's coming into Maya's life and maybe even ours. You know what? Maybe that's what I should focus on, and that way, maybe I can accept her.",
        "Vivienne: But?",
        "Julius: But I don't think it's going to last. You know these rich Hollywood types. Marriage doesn't mean the same thing to them that it means to us. Doesn't Rick already have two ex-wives? How long before the novelty wears off?",
        "Vivienne: Stop!",
        "Julius: No, no, no. Listen to me. Rich, good-looking, handsome, can have any woman he wants... and he's gonna marry into a freak show... a woman made by surgery? It's not gonna be long before he wants the real thing again.",
        "Vivienne: Shut your mouth.",
        "Julius: Listen, Vivienne, I know that I am not supposed to say all of this. I'm supposed to keep it all locked up inside of me. I told Maya last night I wanted to be inside her life. And I will do the same thing today. I will bite my tongue. I will march what used to be our son down an aisle, and I will hand him over to a man like it's normal. I will sit through this joke of a ceremony, and I will smile. I will say the right things, I will do... all the right things to protect Maya's day. But I will be acting, because I'm trying to make myself believe and accept her, to accept this, and this is wrong. It's sick. It's not natural. I don't accept it, and I can't accept it, and I won't accept it! What she did and who she is -- it just...isn't...right."
