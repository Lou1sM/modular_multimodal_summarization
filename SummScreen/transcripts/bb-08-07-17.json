Maybe she does not have as much influence on him as they think. Ridge catches Carter on his way to see Eric. He thinks it is the divorce papers. Wyatt tells Katie that thinking is overrated. She says there is the problem of she was once married to his - father \u0096 there she has said it out loud. Wyatt says yes and his dad has moved on, so should she. Charlotte interrupts and Wyatt tries to kiss Katie again but she puts an end to it. Ridge wants to see the papers but Carter says only Eric can see them. Sheila tells Charlie that the door is right behind him, use it! Charlie tells her all this hocus pocus is not going to work. Quinn begs Eric one more time to give her a chance. They were good for each other and still could be if he will give her one more chance. Wyatt shows up at the outdoor restaurant and sees Charlotte. She invites him to sit down. He says he is meeting Katie. Charlotte says funny; Katie called her and told her to meet Wyatt, must be match making. Ridge tells Steffy that he just hopes Quinn's marriage can survive this. Quinn tells Eric that she did not care what other people said if she got her way, but she has changed because of Eric and she cries what she would do to see that look of her in his eyes again. Carter brings the papers by and Eric hands the papers to Quinn and says if she is the new woman that she claims to be then sign the papers and let him go. Wyatt gets a chance to call Katie and says setting him up with Charlotte \u0096 that was not necessary. Katie thought she would be perfect and she definitely likes him. Charlotte returns and gives Wyatt a kiss on the cheek.", "Charlie tells Sheila that he thinks it is really Eric and Quinn's business and she should give up. He wants to know who this friend of hers is and what is she doing here. He sees her drawing a portrait and wonders if it is what he thinks it is. Eric tells Quinn that there is a restraining order against her. She will be out of the company and out of the house and let him move on from this. It is what he wants. She says okay if that is what he wants. She signs; he thanks her and says she can go. She cries that she is so sorry that she hurt him. But she wants him to know that she will love him forever. As she turns to leave, she hears him tearing up the papers. Katie cannot concentrate and then suddenly there is Wyatt kissing her instead of having lunch with Charlotte. Eric tells Carter they won't be filing the papers. He just wanted to be sure. He said she was a whole new life for him, he trusted her with his life and then she took it away from him. He knows she did not mean it and he sees her regret now. She is home now. She says it was not about the home, just him. He says he wants to give it another chance and there will not be another opportunity for her to stray. They hug and cry. Charlie accuses Sheila of wanting her own portrait over Eric's mantel. She says it will happen in time. That is her goal and she will achieve it. She gets what she wants. And she wants to be Eric's wife again and if Charlie thinks that will not happen then he is in for a big surprise."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Steffy: I'm glad granddad called quinn.

Can I see you for a second?", "Carter: Gonna have to wait. I'm on my way to see eric.", "Ridge: What is that? Are those divorce papers? Dad is leaving quinn?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Don't give up on us, eric. I know it won't be easy. I hurt you terribly, and it's gonna take you a long time to get over it. But we -- we will get over it. We can't get divorced.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: I'm serious. Don't you think we owe it to ourselves?", "Katie: To what? To... figure out what this is?", "Wyatt: Yep.", "Katie: We should think about what we're doing.", "Wyatt: No. Thinking's overrated. Okay? We don't need to bother ourselves with the little details --", "Katie: Oh, I know. Those little details.", "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.", "Katie: I can think of a little detail -- I used to be married to your father. Oh, my god. I just said that out loud.", "Wyatt: Okay. Uh, \"a,\" was. And \"b,\" twice. Epic fails.", "Katie: [ Scoffs ]", "Wyatt: He -- he has moved on. Why can't you? Hmm?", "Charlotte: Knock, knock! I made a coffee run, and somehow ended up with this extra latte.

My favorite.", "Charlotte: Is it?", "Wyatt: [ Laughs ] Yeah.", "Charlotte: Wow, what a coincidence.", "Wyatt: I mean...", "Charlotte: Well, you know how to reach me if you need anything else.", "[ Giggles ]", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Charlotte: Oh, either of you.", "Wyatt: Thanks. Was she... acting a little strange?", "Katie: No, no. Not strange at all.", "Wyatt: Hm. Now. Uh, where were we? Oh, right. You -- you were just about to kiss me.", "Katie: Well, I don't remember that. You know, charlotte came in, and \"phew!\"", "Wyatt: No, I'm -- I'm pretty sure of it.

Leave!", "Charlie: I get it. You're doing one of those new age-y, meditation-y, uh, thingies, right? Well, good luck with that. You know, I-I don't think you can \"om\" your way back into eric's life. So don't get your hopes up.", "Sheila: The door is right behind you, charlie.", "Charlie: Face reality, huh? He's married to quinn.", "Sheila: For now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: He's divorcing her?", "Carter: I can't comment on that.", "Ridge: Just give me the papers, I'll take them over.", "Carter: You know I can't do that, either. I need to give these personally.", "Ridge: Quinn doesn't deserve this. She can be a good wife to him if -- if he'll let her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I know you value this marriage as much as I do. What we are to each other -- I've never had that kind of support. And I don't believe you have, either. [ Sighs ] I messed up. But does that erase all the happiness that we had before? We were good for each other, and we still can be. Please just give me one more chance.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Uh...hey. Fancy seeing you here.", "Charlotte: Right? [ Chuckles ] What are you having? Another coffee, or something stronger?", "Wyatt: Uh, I-I'm gonna wait till we get a table. I'm actually meeting someone.", "Charlotte: Funny. So am I.", "Wyatt: Oh, yeah?", "Charlotte: You.", "Wyatt: No, uh... katie -- katie logan texted me and asked if we could meet.", "Charlotte: Yeah, that's why I'm here. She texted me, too. She told me to join you.", "Wyatt: Oh.", "Charlotte: I think someone's playing matchmaker.", "Wyatt: [ Laughs ] Uh, yeah. I think so, too.", "Charlotte: Not that I mind.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: N-now -- now, if quinn and eric do split because of this, can we, uh -- can we just agree that it's not because of me? You know...", "Sheila: [ Chuckles ] Yes. We can agree that your passionate kisses with ridge did not break up [Laughing] Eric's marriage.", "Charlie: No, no, no, no, no. You kn-- you know, that -- that I didn't say anything directly to you a-about, y-you know, them.", "Sheila: [ Laughing ] Would you just relax, charlie? I figured it out on my own. It wasn't hard.", "Charlie: Well, you see, that's because we have, uh, similar skills. I mean, w-we're both -- we're both really good at the fine art of observation. But...god, you know, eric, I -- I don't think he ever would have caught on.", "Sheila: Yeah, well, he knows now. And he knows that she doesn't deserve him, not after betraying him with ridge.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Will this open up any doors for you? Granddad divorces quinn, now that she's available...", "Ridge: Oh, don't be ridiculous.", "Steffy: I'm not being ridiculous. You were kissing her.", "Ridge: Okay. But there's nothing between us. There never was anything. I don't know why I did what I did. I just hope their marriage can survive it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Just one more chance. That's all I'm asking.", "Eric: All this talk about how you've changed.", "Quinn: I have changed!", "Eric: All this time, you've been lying to my face.", "Quinn: And I was torn up inside about it. The person that I was wouldn't have cared. I mean, I-I didn't care if I hurt people as long as I got my way. But -- but... who I am now? I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror. It made me sick hurting you. I have changed... because of you. I saw, in your eyes, who I was, and somehow I learned to be her. And what I wouldn't give to see her in your eyes again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Knock on door ]", "Carter: I got this together as quick as I could.", "Eric: All the conditions I asked for?", "Carter: Exactly. Ready to sign.", "Eric: If you really are the woman I thought, if you really have changed... show me. Let me go.

Yeah.", "[ Charlotte giggles ]", "[ Clears throat ]", "[ Cellphone rings ]", "[ Phone beeps ]", "Katie: Hello?", "Wyatt: Charlotte? Seriously?", "Katie: What? She is a beautiful, lovely young woman, and she clearly likes you. I just think that she's probably more suited for you than I am, so --", "Wyatt: You really feel that way?", "Katie: Yes. Yes, I do.", "Wyatt: I know that it would be complicated for us, but that doesn't mean that... I-I mean, I just thought that we were... I don't know. Whatever. Never mind.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlotte: So, it's gonna be about 15 minutes.", "Wyatt: Oh, okay.", "Charlotte: But I thought maybe you'd follow me to the host station.", "Wyatt: Oh, yeah? Why?", "Charlotte: For this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Both chuckle ]", "Steffy: If you really moved on from quinn --", "Ridge: Hey. I was never with quinn.", "Steffy: Okay. Okay.

There isn't anybody.", "Steffy: Ridge forrester, a celibate now? Okay. Okay. First time for everything.", "Ridge: I've -- I've been -- what do you kids call it? I've been... soul searching.", "Steffy: Soul searching. Okay.", "Ridge: And I realized that, over the last I don't know how many years, all I've been doing is chasing women. Maybe it's time to grow up. Maybe this latest -- and hopefully last -- disaster has helped me wake up a little bit. A few foolish kisses, and I lost brooke forever. And now it looks like quinn has lost your grandfather.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: I-if I were you, I'd just, you know, lay low for a while. I mean, eric knows the truth. And -- and -- and if he and quinn, you know, work it out -- or not -- it's really their business.", "Sheila: Yeah, well, thank you for your opinion.", "Charlie: You know, it's really rude to talk to someone when they're not looking at you.", "Sheila: I'm a little preoccupied here, charlie.", "Charlie: All right, what the hell is going on back there, huh? And who is this friend who hasn't said one single word?", "Beatrice: Whew! You know, I'm -- you know, this isn't working. We should take a break.", "Sheila: Y-yeah, sure. Let -- let me get rid of my friend, and then we can continue.", "Charlie: Oh, my god. Is that what I think it is?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: You might want to have your own attorney look it over. Review the terms.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Am I reading this correctly -- zero dollars?", "Eric: Yes.", "Quinn: My -- my job is -- is terminated.", "Eric: Yes. And you're not to use the forrester name in the future... professionally or personally. You're banned from the building. You're banned from this house. There'll be a restraining order issued to that effect.", "Quinn: [ Sobs ] A restraining order?! Eric, why --", "Eric: Those are the terms of the agreement.", "Quinn: You know how I feel about you, don't you?", "Eric: Then show me. Do this for me. Sign the papers. Let me move on from this.", "Quinn: So... no money. No job. I-I -- I lose my name and -- and I have to leave my home.", "Eric: It's what I want.", "Quinn: Okay. If that's what you want.", "Eric: Thank you. You can go.", "Quinn: I'M... I am so sorry. I'm so sorry that I hurt you. Here's your guarantee that i will never hurt you again. [ Sobs ] But I will love you forever. [ Paper tearing ] What are you doing?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Okay, I'm gonna work. I'm gonna work, because work is what I do best. [ Sighs ] Right. We did it!", "Wyatt: We did it!", "Katie: We did it! Oh, my god!", "Wyatt: We did it!", "Katie: [ Sighs ] Oh, god. Wyatt, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be having lunch with charlotte. You're --", "Katie: We can'T. We can't do this. This is not...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: E-er-- eric, what are you doing? I-I don't understand.", "Eric: I wanted to be sure. Carter, we won't be, uh, needing to file these.", "Carter: Bye.", "Quinn: Are you saying that...", "Eric: Come here. Come here. You were a whole new life for me. Good... and honest and committed. And I trusted you. [ Sighs ] I trusted you with all my heart. With my life. And you took that away from me. I know you didn't mean to. [ Quinn sobs ] But you took it away. And I, uh... I see the regret. I see it. You were willing to -- to give up your career and -- and your home.", "Quinn: Because it was never about any of that. It was always just about you. Just you.", "Eric: 'Cause you love me.", "Quinn: [ Laughs ] Of course I do.", "Eric: I want to give it another chance, okay?", "Quinn: Okay.", "Eric: Nothing like this can ever happen again.", "Quinn: No. Never. I promise you. Never.", "Eric: No, it can'T. It won'T. I believe in you.", "Quinn: You... you are the greatest man. You won't regret this.", "Eric: Oh, quinn... [ Quinn crying ] Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: You want this to hang over [Laughs] Eric's fireplace, don't you?", "Sheila: Well, it's a preliminary sketch. The -- the sitting for the portrait comes later. It may take time, but... it's gonna happen.", "Charlie: Well, you don't need time. You need a psychiatrist. And then you need a miracle.", "Sheila: Do you know what a vision board is?", "Charlie: Well, sure. Yeah. Pammy's got one in her closet. It's got all kinds of pictures of wedding gowns, whatever that's all about.", "Sheila: Well, sometimes all you need to make a miracle happen is the proper vision board, and that's what I'm making here. My portrait will hang in the forrester house again, because that is my goal, and I will achieve it.", "Charlie: And what if eric forgives quinn?", "Sheila: And if he does... I know where I need to be. And I get what I want. And I want to be eric forrester's wife again. And if you or anyone else thinks that isn't gonna happen...
