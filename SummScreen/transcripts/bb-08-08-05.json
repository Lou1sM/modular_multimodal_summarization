        "Brooke: That's it, sweetie. I feel you. Mommy's here. Mommy's right here. Could you do it again? Please squeeze my hand one more time. Yes. Yes, that's good. That's really good, could you open your eyes? It's okay. It's okay, just rest. And just know that the doctors are taking really good care of you. I love you so much.",
        "Nick: Hey! I need a doctor here. Over here! Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Catherine: Can I get you anything, Hector? Maybe something to drink?",
        "Hector: Thanks Catherine, but I'm almost finished here.",
        "Catherine: You trying to figure out what happened?",
        "Hector: Trying.",
        "Catherine: It doesn't make any sense. Hope swims great for a girl her age. How could she almost drown?",
        "Hector: Well, this would explain it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Sobel: What's happened?",
        "Brooke: Hope, sweetie, show the doctor how squeezed my hand.",
        "Brooke: I'm not imagining it. She did squeeze my hand before.",
        "Dr. Sobel: It's possible.",
        "Brooke: No, she did. She really did.",
        "Dr. Sobel: I just don't want you to get ahead of yourself. It could be involuntary.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, but she did it twice. That has to be a good sign.",
        "Dr. Sobel: I'll know more once I've examined her.",
        "Nurse: I'll let you know when the doctor's finished.",
        "Brooke: Hope, honey, I'm not leaving. I'll just be right outside, okay?",
        "Nick: You're right. That's a good sign. It's a good sign. You just have to keep believing that she's gonna get through this.",
        "Brooke: Hope's in that hospital bed because of you, Nick. You did this to her. I trusted you with my baby, and now she's in there, fighting for her life, because you nearly let her drown! I thought you loved her.",
        "Nick: I do love her. I love that little girl more than anything. This is killing me --",
        "Brooke: Stop it! I can't stand to listen to this. I can't stand to hear your voice. I can't even stand to look at you!",
        "Nick: I know that you may hate me. But you shouldn't be alone.",
        "Brooke: I shouldn't be here, period. Hope shouldn't be here. I still don't understand. I mean, how did her hair get caught in the drain? How long was my little girl under there?",
        "Nick: I don't know. A minute, maybe more, I don't know.",
        "Brooke: Just long enough to ruin her life.",
        "Nick: No. You know, we gotta believe that she's gonna come through this. We just have to believe that.",
        "Brooke: I hope to god you're right. Because she may end up disabled. My daughter may not have a normal life again.",
        "Nick: Brooke, please --",
        "Brooke: Don't.",
        "Nick: I wish to god it were me in there. I would love to trade places with that little girl, 'cause she's like a daughter to me. She's like my flesh and blood. And if she's hurt in any way -- I will give her my life. Whatever she needs.",
        "Brooke: If my daughter is scarred by this, every time I look at her, I'll be reminded that you were responsible. You are to go nowhere near her, Nick. Not now, not ever.",
        "Brooke: How is she?",
        "Dr. Sobel: There's been no more movement, but her breathing pattern appears normal.",
        "Brooke: And that's good, right?",
        "Dr. Sobel: Certain breathing patterns can signify abnormalities in the brain.",
        "Brooke: But Hope is fine?",
        "Dr. Sobel: Her breathing is, yes. We've also seeing increased neuromuscular responses and eye activity, which is encouraging.",
        "Brooke: Oh, thank god.",
        "Dr. Sobel: I'll be back shortly to check on her.",
        "Nurse: But if Hope should move or respond in any way before then --",
        "Brooke: I'll call you right away. I know it's hard. But you've got to keep fighting. So many people love you. Your little brother, Bridget, Catherine. They need you. I need you. So, please, please come back to us. Please.",
        "Hector: Hey. Okay if I come in?",
        "Brooke: Yes. Of course.",
        "Hector: How's she doing?",
        "Brooke: Well, she's still unconscious. But she did squeeze my hand twice.",
        "Hector: Well, that's positive.",
        "Brooke: I just wish she'd open those big eyes of hers. So I understand that you responded to the call.",
        "Hector: From Nick, yeah. Brooke, I know you're worried sick about her. But hope has everything she needs to pull through this. She has youth, resiliency, excellent doctors -- and a loving mother by her side.",
        "Brooke: Some mother. I never should've left her in nick's care.",
        "Hector: No, no, don't do that now. Come on. Hindsight is always 20/20.",
        "Brooke: Hector, he wasn't even watching her.",
        "Hector: I understand how you feel. I really do. [ Hector sighs ] And Nick should've been paying closer attention. But there's something else that you need to know.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Hector: I took another look at the spa. Brooke, it was an accident waiting to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Nick remembering ]",
        "Hope: Did you see me?",
        "Nick: I saw you, honey. I'm watching. Hope! Hope. Brooke! I'm right here, sweetie. Uncle Nick's right here.",
        "Brooke: You did this to her, Nick. You did this to her.",
        "[ Echoing ]",
        "Brooke: An accident waiting to happen?",
        "Hector: Yeah. Your spa has only one drain. And the drain cover was broken. Hope's hair got caught in this. And as the water was being drawn through, her hair got sucked down with it, causing her head to be held underwater. It's like every parent's worst nightmare. But there are precautions that you can take.",
        "Brooke: What precautions?",
        "Hector: Well, nothing replaces adult supervision, but you can put a bathing cap on Hope, or anybody else with long hair. Or for a spa with only one drain like yours, you can install a vacuum release system, which breaks the vacuum if something should get stuck in there. Better yet, get a spa with two outlets. That way, if one drain is blocked with hair, for example, the suction won't be as strong.",
        "Brooke: I had no idea that was an issue.",
        "Hector: You and a lot of other people. But children get injured by this type of accident every year.",
        "Brooke: I should've realized. We just moved back into that house, and I should've had the spa checked. I was going to, but then so much was going on. Oh, my god. My sweet little girl. What have I done to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: I got your message, Nicky, but it was really, really difficult to make out. What happened?",
        "Nick: Hope. She was -- she was in the spa, and I was supposed to be watching her.",
        "Jackie: Where was Brooke?",
        "Nick: She went to pick up R.J. and she asked if I could keep an eye on hope. But I didn't. I didn't do a very good job of it, mother. She was -- she was playing underwater, and she wanted me to watch her to see how long she could hold her breath. I turned away. And when I looked back, I saw her legs sticking out of the spa.",
        "Jackie: Oh, dear god.",
        "Nick: I tried to pull her out, but she was stuck. Her hair was caught in the drain and I couldn't --",
        "Jackie: Nicky, Nicky, she's here. She's here in the hospital right? I mean, Hope is alive?",
        "Nick: I got her out, I did CPR, she's breathing.",
        "Jackie: Oh god, you saved her life.",
        "Nick: Saved her life?",
        "Jackie: Yes, because of you, she's here, she's in --",
        "Nick: Mother, because of me, this little girl might have brain damage. She may never walk, or talk, or laugh again. She's upstairs right now, unconscious in a hospital bed with tubes hanging out of her. Because of me. Because of me.",
        "Jackie: Nicky, this could've happened to anyone. You musn't blame yourself.",
        "Nick: She told me to keep an eye on her. She said, \"don't take your eye off of her, whatever you do. You can't take your eye off of her.\"",
        "Jackie: It was an accident. Accidents happen, especially to children.",
        "Nick: That's no excuse, mother. She just wanted my attention is all. And I let her down. I let her down in the worst way possible.",
        "Jackie: Okay, stop it. Your tormenting yourself and this isn't fair.",
        "Nick: Fair? I'll tell you what's not fair. The life that this little girl has led being bounced from dad to dad, and then along comes her big hero, uncle nick, and I let her down more than anybody.",
        "Jackie: Listen to me. You're not doing yourself any good. You're not doing hope any good with this. What she needs now is her uncle nick to be with her, holding her hand, helping her to recover, and Nicky, you've gotta go to her. Go be with her.",
        "Nick: Can't.",
        "Jackie: Of course you can. The child adores you.",
        "Nick: Brooke doesn't want me anywhere near her.",
        "Jackie: Well, that's ridiculous. Brooke needs you too, more than ever.",
        "Nick: She blames me, Mother. She holds me responsible for what happened. And she should.",
        "Jackie: Okay, that's just because she's scared. I mean, any mother would be frantic in this situation. But once the crisis has passed --",
        "Nick: Then what? Tell me. Then what? All is forgiven? We go back to normal? I don't think your hearing me, Mother. Her daughter might have brain damage. Do you understand? That means her whole life is different. Were talking paralysis, possibly, loss of speech, seizures.",
        "Jackie: Seizures?",
        "Nick: Seizures. She had two of them in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. I watched her. Her little body shaking. Maybe this is why I was never meant to have a kid.",
        "Jackie: No, Nicky, no.",
        "Nick: You know what they say, mother, right? Things happen for a reason. Well, obviously, I was never meant to have children or be around children. I mean, you know you just can't love them enough, and, you know, parents are supposed to look out for their children and take care of them and protect them, not drown them.",
        "Jackie: You'd be a wonderful parent. You can't keep beating yourself up.",
        "Nick: Just what do you suggest I do? Mom?",
        "Jackie: Pray. Okay? Pray. I'll pray with you for Hope's recovery. I mean, that is why you came down here, right? Ask for his help.",
        "Nick: Don't take that little angel. Give her back to her mother. Give her back to Brooke. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I did this to her.",
        "Hector: Brooke, you didn't know about this. But now you do.",
        "Brooke: I should've had the spa checked.",
        "Hector: And Nick should've been watching her more carefully. But your focus should now be on Hope and helping her to get better. So that the next time she goes swimming, you're doing everything you can to protect her.",
        "Brooke: Honey? I didn't know I was putting you in danger. If I'd known -- I'm so sorry. Mommy's gonna make sure that nothing ever hurts you again, okay? Now I need you to do something. I need you to be strong. I need you to fight. Fight, please. I love you so much. You have to come back to us, Hope. [ Hope groans ] Hope? Hope?",
        "Hope: Mom.",
        "[ Brooke gasps ]",
        "Brooke: Yes. Yes, honey. It's me. It's mommy. I'm right here. I'm right here."
