        "Hope gets ready for the photo shoot of her life. She meets with Wyatt and press gal, Eva. He says once she gets this diamond baby on her, she will have nerves of steel. Quinn is straining her neck on the plane to listen or see what Ivy and Liam are talking about \u0096 the special spot in Paris that he is going to meet Hope. Ivy says some girls get all the luck, then Hope will know that he has a future planned with her. He says thank goodness no more Wyatt or his crazy mom. She chose the diamond for the shoot but she is choosing a future with him. Brooke comes into the office early. Says she could not sleep just thinking about Hope and the diamond shoot. Aly says she can't wait until Hope sees Liam. Brooke is surprised and knows nothing about it. Aly says he is to meet Hope after the shoot at the tower so all he has to do is get there today on time. Liam and Ivy get off the plane and a still disguised Quinn is last. They have a car at the airport and get inside while Quinn waits around and finds an opportunity to grab a parked moped in front and takes off after Liam's car. Liam is nervous; the traffic is terrible, he just wants to get there as fast as he can. Luckily Quinn can even get up on the sidewalks and bypass the traffic.",
        "Hope's photo shoot goes well with her looking absolutely gorgeous in several different gowns highlighting the diamond necklace. Then she takes questions and answers that it will be shown in Paris, Milan, Brussels and London. They ask about Quinn and Wyatt says she needed a break, he didn't. They ask him about Ricardo's death. Wyatt skirts that by saying if there is an investigation he is sure it is because he was loved by so many. Afterwards when Wyatt and Hope are wandering through the Trocadero gardens, she says she had no idea that Ricardo's death was being investigated. Again Wyatt laments that he is sure they are just being as thorough as they can be. He says they should go celebrate. She says he knows she can't. This is her special spot right here to wait for Liam. Wyatt looks around and no Liam. He says he doesn't think he is coming. Hope says yes he is. She takes off the diamond and hands it to Wyatt. She says it is his and she can't keep it. Without a word he reluctantly walks away. Hope waits anxiously while Wyatt stands under a tree and watches her without her seeing him. At the last minute when it looks like he will be late, Liam tells the cab driver to drop off the bags at FI. He and Ivy jump out and start running up the stairs to get to the Bridge by the Seine River. Quinn is not far behind on foot also. All are literally running as fast as they can. Liam sees the Eiffel Tower and he's out of breath but continues toward it. Ivy catches up. They see Hope on the other side of the river and she tells him to go on, she will stay behind and give him time with Hope. She rests a bit by sitting on the ledge of the bridge. She is taking a selfie. Quinn smiles and walks slowly up to her and gently pushes her. Ivy goes splat in the water below. Liam hears it and turns around and comes back. He sees Ivy. She is not drowning and tells him to go on, be on time. He looks at Hope, he looks at Ivy. What to do?"

        "Eva: [Speaks French] Hope Logan!",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Hope: Bonjour. Bienvenue. Thank you so much for joining us. I am very excited to present the newest collection from Hope for the Future. When I first created this line, my goal was simple. To create eco-friendly fashion for young women. Then as the line developed, so did my dedication for social awareness, environmental responsibility, and empowering young women all across the world. I believe that, like art and music, fashion has the ability to transcend boundaries. It can communicate across cultures. And what better place to showcase this message than perhaps the most fashionable spot on earth, Paris' Trocadero Gardens, the Eiffel Tower.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Hope: Thank you. Uh, the other reason and main event for this press conference and photo shoot is this -- the Hope for the Future diamond.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Hope: Thank you. Thanks. The grace and elegance of this diamond truly defines the nature of beauty in its purest form. It is a reminder to protect and cherish the earth that we live on and be grateful for everything that it has given us. It's an inspiration for what Hope for the Future can accomplish, to lead the next generation into a future that will shine as bright as this diamond.",
        "[Applause]",

        "[Car horn honks] Monsieur. Bonjour.",
        "[Speaking French]",
        "[Reporters shouting] Miss Logan, what is it like to wear such a diamond? Please, will the diamond be on display in your Paris boutique?",
        "Hope: Yes, yes. It will. Um, the diamond is currently making its European tour. It will be making its way through Paris, Milan, Brussels, London. And we will send out a press release as soon as dates are finalized. Please, what about the Stephanie Forrester collection? Can you expect to see that here at some point?",
        "Hope: Well, that is another excellent idea from Wyatt Spencer, and yes, Forrester is thrilled with this collection. I'm expecting you to see it in Paris sometime in the near future. Wyatt, your mother is no longer working for Forrester, but you remain?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, well, my mother's the one who needed a break, not me, so... What makes the two of you such a great team?",
        "Hope: Well, I think we both really believe in this line and what it can do. Wyatt, do you mind getting in the picture, please?",
        "[Camera shutter clicking]",
        "Wyatt: Thank you. Mr. Spencer, Ricardo Montemayor willed you this diamond. Have you heard there are questions surrounding his death? Perhaps an investigation?",
        "Wyatt: Really? Uh, well, I'm -- I'm sure that it's just a routine investigation. Ricardo's death was a terrible loss to so many.",
        "Hope: Yeah, he was the steward of this diamond for so long. Um, yeah, he -- he won't soon be forgotten.",

        "Wyatt: Uh, I'm sure he's just being thorough, you know.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",

        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: You know what? You know what? We can make it faster on foot.",
        "Ivy: Well, yeah, probably.",
        "Liam: Listen, uh, drop the bags off at Forrester international. Let's go. Let's just walk.",
        "[Honking continues]",
