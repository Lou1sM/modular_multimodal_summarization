She remarks this is more than she deserves and she will never let him down again. Pam calls the house and is surprised to find Eric answering the phone. He says he does not want to hear one negative word but he has come home to stay and Quinn is too. He tells Quinn from the very first day he met her she touched something in him that he did not know was there. She sighs that she can breathe again. He wants her to do him a favor and he starts playing the piano and she dances around. Then he tells her to stop right there and don't move. He moves into her arms and gives her a big hug. Katie laments to Wyatt that he can't just come in here at work and start kissing on her. He wants to know if she did not like it. She says she did not say that. He has lost his mind as anyone could walk in. He retorts that will give them something to talk about and he is not worried about that. By time they move to the couch, Katie tells Wyatt that she needs to slow this down. It is not that she does not want to but they are friends .friends with benefits or whatever he wants to call it. She says she likes to label things so she can deal with it. He laughs and says she needs to shut that brain off right now and just be. She says okay they will just have fun.",
        "Charlie tells Sheila she is delusional if she thinks her so-called portrait will ever hang on the Forrester wall. She rails that Stephanie had one, Quinn had one and she is going to have one too. Do not underestimate her. Charlie tells Sheila that she probably is underestimating Quinn. She cannot know that he is with her now. Pam calls and tells Charlie some interesting news; Eric is back with Quinn; she heard it from Eric himself. Charlie explains to Sheila that he knows she was expecting something but it is not going to be. Sheila tears up and can't believe Eric would do that. Wyatt tells Katie that the two of them are adults and they are free to do what they want. She says he does make her laugh but there are real issues they cannot dismiss. There is their age difference and then there is Quinn and Bill and her son Will. He asks if she is thinking of those things now or when he kisses her and she admits no, so he kisses her again. He says if he doesn't mean something it does not go past this lips. He finds her sexy. He thinks they make a good team too. They kiss again. Charlie tells Sheila that he knows she is disappointed but Quinn and Eric getting back together is really none of her business. Sheila says he was hers long before Quinn came into the picture and he will be again and that portrait will hang on Eric's wall. And if Charlie mentions it to anyone he is going to hang too. Quinn says she feels like she could burst with happiness; how blessed she is. From this day forward she wants to celebrate what they are to each other .to the woman she sees reflected in his eyes. She had to lose something to really appreciate him but now she does. She is now 100% committed to him. A flash of thunder and the Quinn portrait is transformed into a vile Sheila one."

        "Quinn: You're really giving me another chance? I can stay?",
        "Eric: We will stay -- you... me... her. We're all where we belong.",
        "Katie: That was a really big mistake. You can't just walk in here and -- and start kissing me. It's -- it's ridiculous.",
        "Wyatt: You didn't like it?",
        "Katie: I didn't say that.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. So, then, what's the problem?",
        "Katie: Well, for starters, anyone could walk in here.",
        "Wyatt: We'd give them something to talk about.",
        "Katie: And you wouldn't care?",
        "Wyatt: Absolutely not. And that was very clever of you, by the way, earlier, when you set me up with charlotte.",
        "Katie: It was clever, wasn't it? She's such a lovely, young, young, young woman.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my god. She's cute, yes. She laughs at my jokes. That gets her extra points.",
        "Katie: See?",
        "Wyatt: But the thing is... I am not standing here in front of charlotte, now, am I?",
        "Katie: This is all very, um... tempting and --",
        "Wyatt: And?",
        "Katie: And ridiculously wrong on so many levels.",
        "Wyatt: [ Chuckles ]",
        "Katie: You should really -- you should just go.",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Katie: You can't -- you can't say no!",
        "Wyatt: I j-- I just did.",
        "Katie: You have lost your mind.",
        "Wyatt: [ Chuckles ] I know.",
        "Quinn: Who are you? This amazing man... with this huge heart... and its capacity for forgiveness.",
        "Eric: I believe in you, quinn.",
        "Quinn: That's so much more than I deserve. But I am never going to let you down. [ Telephone rings ] Hmm. Ugh!",
        "Eric: Hello?",
        "Pam: Eric? I-I-I was calling for quinn. You're home?",
        "Eric: I'm home.",
        "Pam: Are you okay?",
        "Eric: I'm better than I've been for a while. I'm home with my wife. We're giving our marriage a second chance. And before you start going on about this, I don't want to hear a word of it.",
        "Pam: Look, I'd rather have you back with her than with that whack job sheila.",
        "Charlie: You've got to be kidding me! You can't really be doing this!",
        "Sheila: Clearly, I am.",
        "Beatrice: I... I think we've accomplished enough for a first sitting.",
        "Sheila: Wow. That is wonderful, beatrice.",
        "Beatrice: Oh, you're a good subject. Same time tomorrow?",
        "Sheila: That sounds great. Thank you. That went well.",
        "Charlie: So, what are you gonna do, sheila? You gonna march over to eric's with your self-commissioned portrait and slap it up on the wall?",
        "Sheila: A girl's got to be ready, charlie.",
        "Charlie: You are so deluding yourself if you think that is ever gonna grace a forrester wall.",
        "Sheila: Why not? Stephanie had a portrait! Quinn has a portrait! I was eric's wife! I want one, too! You know, I really don't care if it ever hangs on the walls of the forrester house it's the principle of it!",
        "Charlie: Okay! All right.",
        "Sheila: [ Sighs ] But... I really feel confident that it will. If there's one thing that I've learned, it's what's yours will come to you.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not trying to minimize your concerns here, okay? There's no real reason why we shouldn't, you know, explore this.",
        "Katie: Oh, I can think of a few real reasons.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Well, don't, because I'll just shoot it down, because this is what it boils down to, okay? You and I are adults, both single, and we're free to do what we want with whom.",
        "Katie: It's not really about wanting. I mean, you're -- you're awesome, right? You're charming and you're sexy, and you make me laugh, but --",
        "Wyatt: But?",
        "Katie: But there are some real issues that we cannot just ignore. There's quinn and bill and our age difference. I mean, that doesn't bother you>",
        "Wyatt: This coming from the same woman who tried to hook me up with charlotte?",
        "Katie: Okay, fine. That was -- that was silly. I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Wyatt: Let me just ask you something, okay? When we're close like this... do you still think about why we're wrong for each other?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Wyatt: Are you thinking about anything at all?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Wyatt: No?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Charlie: I can't believe that you think you have a chance of being mrs. Eric forrester again.",
        "Sheila: You underestimate me.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, you underestimate quinn. That woman is no joke. She is evil and possessive, and nothing -- nothing -- is beneath her. And, unfortunately for you, eric thinks that she hung the moon, which should have been dazzlingly obvious to you when he went home to her!",
        "Sheila: Why do you assume a reconciliation is happening?",
        "Charlie: Why else would eric go back into a house with a woman that betrayed him with his own son?",
        "Sheila: To say he wants a divorce.",
        "Charlie: [ Scoffs ] You really think that's happening?",
        "Sheila: Eric had time to think about what ridge and quinn did, time to see me for the woman that I truly am now. I wouldn't be surprised if he's kicking her out of his life as we speak.",
        "Quinn: I never realized how big this house was until you weren't here. It always feels so cozy when it's just the two of us.",
        "Eric: I was gone. I-I-I'm sorry. But I needed to find my way... back again.",
        "Quinn: I'm just so glad that you did.",
        "Eric: I was empty without you.",
        "Quinn: How did I get so lucky?",
        "Eric: 'Cause we're connected. Deeply connected. From the very first day... you touched something in me that I didn't even know was there.",
        "Quinn: I feel the exact same way. Ohh. My husband is back! He's ba-- I can breathe again!",
        "Eric: [ Laughs ]",
        "Quinn: I can breathe again.",
        "Eric: Ah, my quinn this way -- my quinn in motion. Don't stop. Don't stop. Come on. Do me a favor, will you? Here. Here. Okay. [ Mid-tempo music playing ] Right there. Stop. Don't move. Wait for me. Wait. Okay.",
        "Quinn: [ Chuckles softly ]",
        "Katie: Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. I need to -- I need to slow this down.",
        "Wyatt: [ Sighs ] Okay. [ Sighs ] I can do that.",
        "Katie: I mean it's -- it's not that I don'T...want to. It's just... we're friends, right? We're... friends with benefits?",
        "Wyatt: I mean, is that -- is that what we are?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I mean, what would you call it?",
        "Wyatt: I'm attracted to you. You're attracted to me. We don't have to put a label on it.",
        "Katie: Oh, see, that's a problem. That's a problem, because I like to label things. I like to compartmentalize them so I can analyze them and get all the information so I can make a clear, responsible choice. What?",
        "Wyatt: [ Laughing ] What?! You -- your -- your brain is, like, so active right now. You just -- it must be a real challenge to just shut that thing off! I mean, how do you -- how do you get katie to stop thinking and just feel?",
        "Katie: And then what?",
        "Wyatt: Who knows?",
        "Katie: You don't care?",
        "Wyatt: About a future I can't control? No.",
        "Katie: So, this is just fun?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Katie: You know what I think, wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Katie: I think it's about time we had some fun.",
        "Wyatt: [ Chuckles ] I think so, too.",
        "Charlie: So, did, uh, eric say he was divorcing quinn?",
        "Sheila: No.",
        "Charlie: Did he say he was kicking her out of his life?",
        "Sheila: No, but... why would he go back to her?",
        "Charlie: Well... once again, you're underestimating quinn. Nothing sticks to her for very long.",
        "Sheila: Well, maybe I should go over there.",
        "Charlie: You'd look like a stalker and, you know, creepy and weird. [ Cellphone rings ] Oh, god. It's pam. She cannot know that I am here, okay? Hi, honey. How are you?",
        "Pam: Charlie, where are you?",
        "Charlie: Out and about. You need me back at the office?",
        "Pam: You are not gonna believe what just happened?",
        "Charlie: Well, then, I guess you better tell me.",
        "Pam: Eric and quinn are back together.",
        "Charlie: Back together? You sure about that?",
        "Pam: He's back home. I heard it from eric himself. How long are you gonna be?",
        "Charlie: Uh...I'll -- I'll be back there soon. Love you.",
        "[ Cellphone beeps ]",
        "Sheila: He took her back?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Look, I know that you'd hoped for something...different.",
        "Sheila: [ Voice breaking ] Eric forgave her? How could he? How could he do that?",
        "Eric: I hated that I couldn't touch you -- your face... your mouth... your hands.",
        "Quinn: My hands? My hands? Really? My hands?",
        "Eric: Yes, your hands. Everything about you. When I came home, I looked out on, um -- out on the patio, and I saw where you were almost shot and... you were almost killed. The thought of you... not being here is just unbearable to me. That's when I realized I was right to come home.",
        "Quinn: I'm never gonna give you a reason to leave. Never again.",
        "Wyatt: Do you have any idea how great you are?",
        "Katie: Oh. You don't have to say that.",
        "Wyatt: Katie... look at me. If I don't mean it, it doesn't go past these lips, okay? You're gorgeous.",
        "Katie: [ Chuckles ]",
        "Wyatt: I find you sexy. You're smart and you're funny. And you're a little overanalytical and you like to label things. God knows what your fridge looks like.",
        "Katie: I'm telling you, the labeler is an amazing device.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my god! Okay!",
        "Katie: That's all I'm saying.",
        "Wyatt: I just think it balances out my impulsiveness... and vice versa. And I also think that's why we make such a good team.",
        "Charlie: You all right?",
        "Sheila: [ Sniffles ] Yeah. Just a momentary lapse.",
        "Charlie: Look, I know you're disappointed that eric went back with quinn, but, honestly -- and this is gonna be tough to hear -- it's really none of your business.",
        "Sheila: Eric is my business.",
        "Charlie: He's married to quinn. He chose her.",
        "Sheila: So, are you saying that I should -- I should just give up and... hand him over politely?",
        "Charlie: Eric isn't yours to give, sheila.",
        "Sheila: Yeah, well, he was... long before quinn ever came into the picture, and he will be again. She is shady. There is so much hidden there, and I'm gonna find it and I am gonna take her down. And this -- this portrait -- it will hang on eric's wall. If you tell anyone anything about my plan... you're gonna hang, too.",
        "Eric: I have missed that.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Eric: That beautiful smile.",
        "Quinn: [ Chuckles softly ] The one that didn't exist before you started loving me. I was...such a dark soul when we first met. But... [ Sighs ] ...You embraced me. You embraced all of me, even my flaws, and your faith -- it filled me up with light and love, and -- and I don't know. Now I [Chuckles] Feel like i can -- I can...burst from happiness.",
        "Eric: My heart's pretty full right now, too.",
        "Quinn: We found each other twice. How blessed we are. I just never want to feel as hollow as I did when you left, especially knowing that i brought that on myself. From this day forward, I want to celebrate what we are together. I want to dedicate myself to you, to our marriage... to the woman that I see reflected back in your eyes.",
        "Eric: I don't expect you to be flawless or perfect. I just -- I just want you committed.",
        "Quinn: Sometimes you almost have to lose something in order to... to appreciate it. I appreciate you. And to call the greatest man in the world my husband... I love you. And I am 100% committed to you. Never doubt that."
