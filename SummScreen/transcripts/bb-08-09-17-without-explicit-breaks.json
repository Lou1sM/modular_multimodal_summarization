        "Ridge calls a meeting with everyone attending. He tells them good news \u0096 his dad and Quinn are back together, as in re-united. They do not know all the details but that is enough for now. RJ says but it could happen again. Ridge says no, it won't. Sally tells her crew that Thomas is in New York with his son .and yes Caroline is his mother and is there too. Sally states that she does not feel threatened. And with Bill not announcing who the winner at the Summit was she is going to take that as that Spectra won. Grams says they still have questions like why did Thomas have to go to New York when they need his designs. Sally says she has some designs. Grams said this old battleship could still go under. Liam shows up and asks if this is a bad time for an interview, but he was looking for Thomas. Sally tells him sorry but he is stuck with her. Liam asks Sally how she feels about her first national show. She says they could have been named the winner but .Thomas calls her at that moment. He says it is rough and he knows Douglas is going to miss his mom but they are staying strong for her. He tells Sally he does not know when he will return. He cannot even think of that now. She will have to take the lead. He believes in her and she has the chops to do this. Bill praises his skyscraper and thinks to himself that Sally better be ready to fall and his beautiful skyscraper ready to grace the sky. Bill tells Justin do not think of his skyscraper as an \"it\". She is a thing of beauty and all Spectra has to do is take a nosedive and his skyscraper will become a reality. Things do not happen by accident. Justin should know that. Bill confides in Justin that Caroline is dying so that is why Thomas is away and Sally will be working alone at Spectra. Bill gloats that Thomas is in New York where he should be in the first place. Justin is stunned and even more so when Bill tells him all the information is not accurate at all, otherwise Thomas would be here designing the latest collection. So that means Spectra doesn't have a prayer.",
        "Bill also tells Justin that there will be no problem when later there is a sudden miracle cure for Caroline. Brooke tells the group that she thinks they all have been on the end of Eric's generous nature so this does not surprise her that he took Quinn back. Steffy tells Ridge that he dodged a big one. He says yes but he is only glad Eric and Quinn are back together. Steffy calls Thomas and he tells her the same thing that he does not know how long he will be in New York. She says he is right where he should be. Liam tells Sally that he didn\u0091t mean to eavesdrop but it sounds like Thomas is not going to be there to design and she will be doing it. He tells Sally that she needs another win after Monte Carlo but without Thomas that story may go away. He gets it that Thomas needs to be in New York but the public will not. They will not care. He is bailing when Spectra desperately needs him. She tells him he knows Caroline is dying so this is more important than a few designs. Liam is shocked when Sally says he must know since he is part of the family that Caroline is dying so that is why Thomas is with her now. But they are not a couple. Liam is thrown for a loop and isn't sure what to do now."

        "Steffy: Whoa, uh...",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Steffy: Hey. Dad, I thought you called a meeting, not a convention.",
        "Ridge: Uh, yes, well... excuse me. Hi. I've got something to share with everybody.",
        "Pam: I promised I'd let ridge tell everyone first.",
        "Ridge: It's good news, for once. My dad and quinn are back together.",
        "Brooke: Together? As in...",
        "Ridge: As in reunited.",
        "R.J.: Oh, that is good news! Any reason why they split up in the first place?",
        "Ridge: That's really none of our business, R.J. Just glad it worked out.",
        "Sally: Yes, monaco was everything we hoped it would be.",
        "Darlita: That video was so amazing.",
        "Saul: Tell us about the interviews.",
        "Shirley: No, no, no, let's wait until thomas gets here.",
        "Sally: Thomas is in new york.",
        "Saul: New york? Why?",
        "Sally: Spending time with his son.",
        "Shirley: Only his son?",
        "Sally: Caroline is his mother, grams. Of course she's there.",
        "Saul: Well, as nice as it'll be not having to dodge abs every day... [ Sighs ] We need him here designing.",
        "Shirley: Sally, spectra is getting a lot of buzz since monte carlo. We've got our next showing on the books, rushed as it is! [ Sighs ] We've got the big \"mo\" goin'! When is he coming back?",
        "Darlita: Yeah, like, in a day or two?",
        "Sally: Hey! Ease off, guys. Okay? Thomas is coming back. Eventually. But right now, we have every reason to celebrate. We could have totally bombed in monaco or bill spencer could have pulled something, but he didn't! Other than naming himself and the children the winner. But he practically called it a tie, and that, my friends, made us the winner, okay? We got press, we showcased our designs, and we announced our upcoming show. Dollar bill is no longer a problem.",
        "Bill: What do you think, sky? Are you ready to step out of this office into the real world?",
        "[ Chuckles ]",

        "Bill: Justin, my man. Come on in. Just having a little chat with my beauty here.",
        "Justin: I hope she didn't chat back.",
        "Bill: When you have a special connection, what is understood need not be discussed. And she understands completely. You see, her time is at hand. Spectra will fall, and my beautiful sky will rise.",
        "Ridge: So liam is interviewing sally without thomas?",
        "Steffy: That's why liam had to take off.",
        "Ivy: Well, I would love to be a fly on that wall.",
        "Pam: Thomas is in new york with caroline, eric's back home and out of sheila's clutches... all is well with the world.",
        "Katie: Well, maybe not quite all.",
        "R.J.: Yeah. What happens if granddad does a repeat?",
        "Brooke: Of what, honey?",
        "R.J.: Walking out again.",
        "Coco: Well, let's be positive.",
        "R.J.: Well, I'm just saying. Whatever happened must have been serious. What's the guarantee that it won't happen again?",
        "Ridge: Trust me, R.J. It won'T.",
        "Thomas: Something's come up. I need to go see douglas.",
        "Sally: You miss your son.",
        "Thomas: It's not just that. It's, uh... it's caroline. She's dying.",
        "Sally: I hate that you're leaving, but it's what you have to do. I will be there... waiting... because you're worth it.",
        "Shirley: Sally girl, we, um, know that you told us to get working, but we still have some questions. Why did thomas have to go to new york?",
        "Saul: Now of all times.",
        "Sally: I told you, he wanted to be with his son.",
        "Darlita: Why? He just saw him out here not that long ago.",
        "Saul: And what about the upcoming showing? We need his designs!",
        "Sally: He will do what he can.",
        "Shirley: What?",
        "Sally: He has faith in me. Okay? I already have... I already have some designs.",
        "Shirley: Sally girl... this whole battleship could still go under.",
        "Darlita: Yeah, and bill spencer can gobble us up at any time.",
        "Liam: Uh...hi. Here for the interview. Is it a bad time?",
        "Sally: No. Nope. Timing's -- timing's great.",
        "Liam: Well, it's almost great. I was hoping to interview both you and thomas about the challenge, but steffy said he's in new york with douglas and caroline.",
        "Sally: Yep, so I guess you're stuck with little ol' me. Everyone was just leaving.",
        "Liam: [ Clears throat ] Nice to... nice to -- okay.",
        "Sally: So... let's get started, shall we?",
        "Liam: [ Clears throat ]",
        "Thomas: Okay, I'm gonna style your hair just like daddy's 'cause you are super handsome. So handsome! Look at that. Does that feel good?",
        "Douglas: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Yeah? Okay, good. And then after this, we're gonna go for the car ride like i promised, and then maybe we'll go to jones beach if mommy's up for it. Does that sound good? She's been so quiet. And so strong. Come here, come here. Come this way. Come over here. [ Grunts ] We have to be strong for her, too, okay? While we still have her.",
        "Justin: And you've given that thing a name...",
        "Bill: Sky. And don't refer to her as a thing. She is a rare beauty, a work of art.",
        "Justin: Right. You still plan on building her?",
        "Bill: Oh, most definitely.",
        "Justin: But not on the prime plot downtown, the old spectra building...",
        "Bill: That's exactly where she's going.",
        "Justin: Yeah, I think thomas might have something to say about that.",
        "Bill: Well, thomas is in new york with caroline and his son.",
        "Justin: For how long?",
        "Bill: Long enough for spectra to take a nosedive and sky to become a reality.",
        "Justin: And I bet that didn't happen on accident, did it?",
        "Bill: [ Chuckles ] Justin. Come on, now. You know there are no accidents.",
        "Justin: So how did you manage it?",
        "Pam: I mean, it sounds like eric was out to punish her.",
        "Steffy: So no divorce settlement?",
        "Carter: No, he was testing quinn.",
        "Katie: Testing her?",
        "Ridge: What, to gauge her reaction?",
        "Carter: Yeah, to a severe settlement. No money, she loses her job at forrester, she's banned from the house, no name, and a restraining order.",
        "R.J.: Wow. Brutal.",
        "Coco: Yeah. Looks like she passed the test.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, with flying colors, I'd say.",
        "Carter: Yeah, she accepted all of it. It was heartbreaking to see, but she did it with such class, you know? She signed the divorce papers, and then she told him, \"I'll always love you.\" She was walking out, and then eric, he took the divorce papers and he tore them up.",
        "Ivy: How beautifully romantic.",
        "Brooke: I think we've all been on the receiving end of eric's enormous capacity to forgive.",
        "Darlita: So what do you think, saul? Can we pull off this collection without thomas here?",
        "Saul: [ Sighs ] I wish. If I never saw him again, I would not file a complaint. But, no, we need him.",
        "Shirley: You're darn right we do! And who does he think he is, walking out on us?",
        "Saul: I just hope sally finally learns a thing or two about loyalty.",
        "Liam: Okay, so... first international show. How do you feel about the results?",
        "Sally: Well, we could have been named the winner...",
        "Liam: [ Scoffs ] Yeah, well, you held your own against forrester. That's not bad.",
        "Sally: I'll settle.",
        "Liam: [ Laughs ] You'll settle.",
        "Sally: Until thomas comes back and we roll out the greatest collection this city has ever seen.",

        "Thomas: Hey. How are you?",
        "Sally: Holding down the fort. How about you?",
        "Thomas: Oh, it's, uh... it's been rough.",
        "Sally: I can't imagine.",
        "Thomas: Every time I look at douglas, I know that he's gonna lose his mom. I just --",
        "Sally: Thomas, I'm sorry. I really wish I could be there with you. When do you think you're coming back? I hate to bring it up, but the line...",
        "Thomas: I -- I'm sorry. I can't even think about that right now. It's too much. Just -- no.",
        "Sally: I understand.",
        "Thomas: Look, sally, I meant it -- you have to take the lead on this. You're gonna do a great job, but I have to be here for douglas.",
        "Sally: Thomas, I really don't know if I have the chops.",
        "Thomas: You do. I believe in you.",
        "Douglas: Daddy?",
        "Thomas: It might be a while before I come back.",
        "Douglas: Daddy!",
        "Thomas: Hey, uh, sorry, i have to go right now, but just remember that this stays between us.",
        "Sally: Well, there are other people that know.",
        "Thomas: Not many, and i really want to keep it that way.",
        "Sally: I'll be thinking about you.",
        "Thomas: You, too.",
        "Liam: Uh... sorry, i didn't mean to eavesdrop. I probably should have, like...",
        "Sally: No, it's -- it's nothing you don't already know.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Uh, well, it sounds like thomas is staying in new york a while.",
        "Sally: Indefinitely. Yeah, he's gonna take a little break from the business.",
        "Liam: Wait a second, so he's -- he's not designing your collection for the showing?",
        "Sally: No. I will.",
        "Justin: Obviously you're up to something.",
        "Bill: It doesn't go beyond this office.",
        "Justin: It won'T. Speak.",
        "Bill: Thomas is in new york because the mother of his child, my niece, is dying.",
        "Charlie: All the bear claws are gone.",
        "Pam: Come on, charlie. You don't need to take those.",
        "Charlie: No, but... maybe some bear claws.",
        "Pam: Charlie, you're not gonna eat all of those pastries, are you?",
        "Steffy: Well, you must be pretty happy granddad and quinn are back together.",
        "Ridge: I am.",
        "Steffy: You dodged a big one.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm not sure about that. I'm just glad they're happy. And you got to be relieved, too. We haven't talked about that much.",
        "Steffy: About what?",
        "Ridge: About thomas in new york, far away from sally spectra.",
        "Liam: Okay. You want to -- you want to go off the record here for a minute?",
        "Sally: Yeah. I suppose we should, given what we both know.",
        "Liam: Uh, okay, well, here's what I know. I know that without thomas forrester, spectra could be on the chopping block. You need another win after monaco. So you -- you know what that means, right?",
        "Sally: Yes, a successful rollout.",
        "Liam: No. Okay, you have a good story right now. That's good. That's good for you. Without thomas, that story goes away. You understand?",
        "Sally: Yes. But thomas needs to be in new york with his son.",
        "Liam: I get that. The public will not.",
        "Sally: [ Scoffs ] Liam, I am a bigger cynic than you, but i have to believe that the public will understand.",
        "Liam: You're wrong, sally. You're wrong. They're not gonna care. We're talking about thomas bailing at a time when your company desperately needs him.",
        "Sally: He's not bailing.",
        "Liam: No? So, is he designing in new york?",
        "Sally: Obviously not, no. He's being a father, liam. He's got a lot to deal with.",
        "Liam: Oh, okay, so bonding with his kid's a 24/7 job, huh?",
        "Sally: Okay. Let's just be straight with each other. We both know the real reason that thomas is in new york with douglas and caroline, and it is a lot more than just bonding time with his son.",
        "Justin: So caroline is dying? Man, that's awful. She's so young.",
        "Bill: Well, it's not all that awful. I told thomas that caroline has a rare auto-immune disease, which is not entirely accurate. In fact, it's not accurate at all. But thomas doesn't know that.",
        "Justin: So... you're telling me that she isn't dying?",
        "Bill: Thomas needed motivation -- otherwise, he wouldn't be in new york. He would be here, away from his son and the mother of his child, designing spectra's latest collection.",
        "Justin: But he isn'T. Which means that --",
        "Bill: Which means that spectra doesn't have a prayer.",
        "Ridge: I got to admit, your brother pulled it off in monaco. Those designs were great.",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm. Hey, I'm just glad he's spending more time with his son. That's what I want for my nephew, and that's why I asked caroline and douglas to come to L.A. I knew once he saw his son and they spent more time together, it would make a huge impact. You know, maybe I should -- i should call him and see how he's doing.",
        "[ Cellphone rings ]",
        "Thomas: Hey.",
        "Steffy: How's my cute nephew?",
        "Thomas: He's asleep at the moment.",
        "Steffy: He happy to have his daddy around?",
        "Thomas: It's definitely where I need to be.",
        "Steffy: How long are you staying?",
        "Thomas: I'm not sure. It could be a while.",
        "Steffy: Well, like you said, it's where you should be. With douglas and caroline.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. She needs me.",
        "Justin: I don't know, this is a big one, bill. You're telling thomas that caroline is dying, and then you're convincing your niece to play along.",
        "Bill: Trust me, she is not thrilled with the idea.",
        "Justin: Yeah, I'll bet.",
        "Bill: But then -- hallelujah! There is a miracle cure! But not until thomas is head over heels back in love with my niece.",
        "Justin: Man, you are something else, telling thomas that your niece is dying.",
        "Bill: Come on, justin! We're all dying! We're all on the way out! So we might as well go out happy, right? Well, for caroline and me, that means thomas staying in new york, which is where he belonged in the first place.",
        "Justin: Oh, god. [ Chuckles ]",
        "Liam: I'm just -- [ Laughs ] I'm trying to understand why thomas feels the need to relocate 3,000 miles away.",
        "Sally: Because that's where douglas and caroline are? I'm surprised you don't want him to.",
        "Liam: I don't have a dog in that fight.",
        "Sally: Okay, well, what about your cousin?",
        "Liam: What about her?",
        "Sally: Your family must be devastated.",
        "Liam: What, about caroline? They don't care! She's totally independent. And if she decides she wants a family with thomas, believe me, she'll make it happen.",
        "Sally: That is not what I'm talking about. Thomas and caroline are finished. I'm talking about caroline's condition.",
        "Liam: Her condition?",
        "Sally: Yeah, she's dying of an auto-immune disorder. Shouldn't that take precedence over everything?",
        "Liam: What did you just say?",
        "Sally: You must know, right? You're a part of the family. Caroline's dying.",
        "Bill: What a plan, huh? Put in place by the master himself. God, I'm good.",
        "Liam: You just said caroline is dying?",
        "Sally: You didn't know?",
        "Liam: Oh, my god. My cousin is dying."
