        "Thorne visits Darla's graveside and relives happier moments. Sitting on a nearby bench, he watches as Phoebe shows up and cries over the grave. He overhears her thoughts that he doesn't understand. He tells her to keep an eye on her mother; the divorce has been hard on her. He assumes Hector is good for her, but Phoebe isn't sure. Hector literally drags Taylor to his house and is adamant and won't hear a word about her telling Thorne the truth. He wants her to go with him on vacation to Mexico where he can take care of her. She argues that this won't be washed away by sunshine and margaritas. Though technically it was an accident, she WAS drinking and that changes everything. Thorne is looking for answers and she is the only one that can give them to him. She counsels other people but can't take her own advice. She is sorry he got involved in this, but she can't live with this. He gets rough trying to talk some sense into her \u0096 his sense. Thorne walks in and sees her trembling and asks if she is okay? Hector tells him he is not welcome here.",
        "While the repairman works on the security system, Dante tells Eric that he came to L.A. because he was infatuated with Bridget. But then he found and became acquainted again with Felicia. And now he realizes he is in love with her and wants Eric to give him one more chance to prove he is worthy. Eric realizes it is over between him and Bridget and he's actually relieved. He thought she was on the rebound from Nick anyway. Felicia leaves Dino in the stroller out by the fountain that he loves so much, while they go into the cottage to visit. He's hedging but getting dangerously close to telling her he was wrong and that it is her that he wants. She's enjoying the flirting and goes out to get Dino to put him to bed, when they realize Dino is missing. Minutes earlier a pair of hands picked him up and drove away."

        "Dante: No problem, Mr. Forrester.",

        "Delivery man: This delivery job has its benefits. Lived here all my life, never seen anything like this. Great to live up here, I bet. View of the ocean. Clean air. What I wouldn't do for a pad like this. Takes a king's ransom, huh?",

        "Eric: And then you found out you were a father.",
        "Dante: Having a son with Felicia -- it's been amazing. It's taken me a while to fully realize how much I love Felicia. And it's just not because we have a son together. I'm in love with Felicia. Mr Forrester, if you would just give me one more chance -- to prove myself to you. I won't let you down.",
        "Eric: I appreciate you telling me that. But I'm not the one who needs convincing. Felicia, she's out in the guest house.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Aunt Darla, you came to help me. And what happened -- I can't get it out of my head. My mother -- I'm so sorry. Alexandria's lost her mother. I can't lose mine, too.",
        "Thorne: Phoebe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: I bought something. Plane tickets. To Mexico. Come on, for you, me and Phoebe. We need this. I got a little time off. We need to clear our heads.",
        "Taylor: No.",
        "Hector: Why not? School's out. What's wrong with a mother taking your daughter on a vacation? Hmm? Come on, you need this or the secret will eat away at you. All of us. Give yourself over to me, Taylor. Everything is gonna work out. I'll take care of you. You just have to let me in.",

        "Dante: What a face, huh?",
        "Felicia: He likes the sound of the fountain. So, I let him sleep out here.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Uncle Thorne.",
        "Thorne: I heard what you said about losing your mother, too. What did you mean by that? I think I know. When you thought your mother died years ago. You were in so much pain, just like Alexandria.",
        "Phoebe: She came back to us. That won't happen for Alexandria.",
        "Thorne: Keep an eye on your mother, okay? Ever since Ridge ended their marriage --",

        "Hector: It's a chance to clear your head.",
        "Taylor: What happened isn't going to be washed away with sunshine and margaritas. I mean, do you have any idea the guilt I'm carrying? Do you? I killed somebody. Okay? I killed Darla. I hit her with my car. I watched it happen. And now, Thorne's out there looking for the bastard who did it. He's looking for the man who killed his wife. But it's not a man, it's me. So, who am I? Am I a good, honest person? Someone who I want my daughters to grow up to be like? Or am I a liar? Someone who runs from the law? A murderer?",
        "Hector: No, you're not a murderer!",
        "Taylor: I am. I am!",
        "Hector: Will you stop? It was dark and foggy. Darla fell in front of your car.",

        "Dante: No.",
        "Felicia: Well, then what?",
        "Dante: I guess I haven't seen you in a little while.",
        "Felicia: So absence makes your heart grow fonder?",
        "Dante: Maybe.",
        "Felicia: Well, I've been busy. Working. Busting heads. Cracking the whip. That sort of thing.",
        "Dante: Cracking the whip?",
        "Felicia: Do you wanna try?",
        "Dante: Sure.",
        "[Felicia laughs]",
        "Felicia: Dante Damiano, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were flirting with me. Don't you remember -- I'm a handful. You did learn that. Just in the Nick of time, too. Right before we said \"I do.\"",
        "Dante: I was wrong.",
        "Felicia: Okay, do you want to tell me what is going on here?",
        "Dante: Felicia, I was wrong about a lot of things.",
        "Felicia: Go on.",
        "Dante: You know, you are like Van Gogh.",
        "Felicia: Van Gogh?",
        "Dante: At times he was locked away -- considered crazy. You know, he looked different, he acted different.",
        "Felicia: I'm not gonna cut off an ear for you if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Dante: He was sent away, his art was shelved. But he was a genius. He was a one-of-a-kind. Very much like you.",
        "Felicia: I don't know where you're going with this. But if you're trying to work me up into a lather with your compliments -- it's working.",
        "Dante: Well, good.",
        "Felicia: Maybe I should go and get Dominic and put him down for the night.",
        "Dante: Maybe you should.",
        "Felicia: Oh my god. Dominic's gone!",
        "Dante: What?",
        "Felicia: He's gone.",
        "Dante: Could he have crawled out of the stroller?",
        "Felicia: No! He's never crawled out of there before! The pool!",
        "Dante: The pool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: I've risked my life more than once to save someone else's. I've moved people into my home -- never asked anything in return. And now I see everything. In my life, about to be lost. My reputation, my freedom. Things I consider sacred. No, a decision's been made.",
        "Taylor: I can't -- I can't do it anymore, Hector. I can't. I don't eat -- I barely sleep. I mean, every time I close my eyes, I see Darla. And all the people who depended on her. I can see her. She's right there. She's right in front of me. But I know she's gone. And then I think of Alexandria and she's crying in her closet. She's holding her mother's dresses. And she's wishing that she would come back home. And then there's Thorne. And I know that he's lying there at night. And he's just thinking of all the terrible things he wants to do the person that did this to his family.",
        "Hector: Have you thought about phoebe? Have you thought about what's gonna happen to your daughter if you admit to this? Her life would be ruined. And she'll lose you. Look, you want to beat yourself up -- do you want to say that you don't deserve forgiveness? That you hope to burn in hell? Is that the way you want to live your life?",
        "Taylor: Maybe I should burn in hell. I counsel people all day in my office, whose lies are eating them alive. And I tell them, you know, be honest. That's what'll give you peace. That's where your peace is at. What is my profession even a joke?",
        "Hector: No.",
        "Taylor: Then why -- why can't I take my own advice? Why, what am I, that weak? Justice and truth. Those aren't just words. They actually mean something. And keeping this a secret isn't right. I mean, isn't the truth what is supposed to set us free? You know, Thorne will never be free. He'll keep trying to figure out who it was who did this. He'll never be free from it until he knows the truth. He has to know.",
        "Hector: Telling him will only destroy two families. Do you want to be locked away? Because I don't.",
        "Taylor: I can't -- I can't do it. I can't live with myself. I can't. I'm sorry you got involved in this. I'm sorry you got caught up in it. I promise you, I will help you if I can. But I didn't want to do this. I should've just said no. I should have just stepped up and taken responsibility from the beginning. I should have just told the truth!",
        "Hector: Stop talking this way, Taylor. Just stop --",
        "Thorne: What the hell is going on? Taylor, are you okay?",
        "Hector: Thorne, you're not welcome here.",
        "Thorne: The hell I'm not. Taylor, you're trembling. What is it? What's wrong?"
