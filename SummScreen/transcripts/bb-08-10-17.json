Sally says she thought since he was family that he knew. Bill tells Justin that he didn't have a choice. Thomas would not step up and stay with his son so he stepped up the game to re-unite him and Caroline. He will stay in New York and Sally will be forced to close Spectra without him. Thomas is a do-gooder and he will not turn his back now on his son. Steffy mentions Quinn to Wyatt and asks if that is what is putting a smile on his face or does he have a new woman. Brooke questions Katie about Quinn or if she has discussed it with Wyatt as they seem to be a new team. She says she wants her to be happy as they both deserve it. Katie says yes they both seemed to have been looking for love in all the wrong places in the past. Justin laments to Bill that he can not believe that Caroline is going along with this lie. Bill says Sally stole Thomas away from Caroline not to mention getting Thomas away from Forrester and he will not let her get away with his legacy.", "Liam drops in on Wyatt and says he has been out of touch, but he wonders if he has spoken with Thomas since being in New York. Something seems wrong there and he may want to stay. He thinks if Thomas and Caroline want to get back together that is great. Wyatt says Bill will be tickled by this news. Steffy drops in on Sally and then ends up talking about Thomas being in New York and staying there for Caroline. Katie and Wyatt discuss the fact that both Steffy and Brooke say they see the look on their faces and neither denied it. Liam walks in on Bill as he is kissing his skyscraper again. Liam quips that he thought Bill had given up on that with Spectra still in business. Wyatt and Katie continue to kiss until she pulls free and says they should not be doing this. He tells her it is time for her to shut that brain off and just have some fun. He announces he is going to kiss her again. She does not pull away. Liam questions Bill about Caroline and why Thomas is in New York to be with her and not working for Spectra. Bill says Thomas is where he belongs and Spectra should have been gone a long time ago. Liam says he heard something pretty shocking today that concerns him. Sally told him something that she assumed he knew. Caroline is dying so why didn't Bill tell him if he told Wyatt. Bill says Caroline came to him about her health but she wants it confidential. She is being cared for by the best doctors in New York. Thomas was told and wants to be there for his family. Liam says this is weird, all working out to Bill's advantage. All Bill has to do is swoop in and take it. He wonders if Caroline is really dying."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Liam: you just said caroline, like my cousin -- my cousin caroline... is dying.", "Sally: I thought you knew.", "Liam: Nope! Nope. In fact, I don't even know how that's possible because I just saw her -- I just saw her and she was fine.", "Sally: [ Sighs ] I can't believe I...", "Liam: How did you -- wait. Wait. Wait. How did you find this out? Did you hear it from thomas? Thomas told you this?", "Sally: Yes. That is why he's in new york. He wants to spend as much time as he can with caroline and doug--", "Liam: Before she dies.", "Sally: [ Sighs ]", "Liam: Oh, my god.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Justin: You told thomas caroline was dying.", "Bill: Stubborn fool didn't give me a choice! I asked him to step up and be there for his family. I wasn't getting through, so...", "Justin: So you lied.", "Bill: I motivated thomas to do the right thing. He stays in new york, caroline's family is reunited... and this beautiful baby becomes a reality.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: [ Clears throat ]", "Steffy: You seem like you're in a good mood.", "Wyatt: [ Chuckles ] What gave it away?", "Steffy: Uh, you were humming down the hall.", "Wyatt: [ Chuckles ]", "Steffy: Your mom hasn't come in, if that's why you're here.", "Wyatt: Uh, yeah, she probably won't for a few more days. Uh, so, how's your family taking the news?", "Steffy: Now that my granddad and quinn are back together? Not as giddy as you are.", "Wyatt: I'm happy for her. I don't -- I wouldn't call it giddy.", "Steffy: Well, uh, something put a smile on your face. Is there a new woman in your life?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I guess it's not really for me to say.", "Brooke: You don't have an opinion?", "Katie: They -- you know, eric and quinn survived a crisis, they're staying together. I -- I don't understand it, but attraction is a funny thing. It doesn't always make sense.", "Brooke: Well, I think it's more than just attraction. I think that eric really does love quinn, and the family supports their reunion.", "Katie: Well, at least it's better than seeing him with sheila.", "Brooke: So, what about wyatt? How does he feel? I'm sure that he's pretty happy.", "Katie: Yeah, I'm -- I'm sure he is.", "Brooke: You two haven't talked about it? You were working so closely at the spencer summit. I started thinking of you two as a team.", "Brooke: You and wyatt really did an amazing job on the fashion challenge.", "Katie: Thank you. It was -- it was fun.", "Brooke: Yeah. It was good to see you getting out there and enjoying yourselves. And wyatt was so pumped. It was cute. I haven't seen him like that since he was with steffy. Hasn't been an easy year for either one of you.", "Katie: Nope. Pretty sad and lonely.", "Brooke: Yeah, no, that's not what I meant.", "Katie: I -- I know. It's -- it's okay. I know what you meant.", "Brooke: I just want to see you happy. You deserve it. And so does wyatt.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Okay, my ex-wife is currently asking me about my love life.", "Steffy: Okay, okay, no more questions.", "Wyatt: I have one, though. What's going on with thomas? Is he going back to new york to be with caroline?", "Steffy: He's, uh, visiting his son, where he should be.", "Wyatt: He's definitely got to be there for douglas, but what about spectra? I mean, they were just getting off the ground, not to mention sally. They seemed to be all hot and heavy, weren't they?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Justin: Thomas and sally are more than business partners.", "Bill: Not for long.", "Justin: And you really think he's getting back with caroline?", "Bill: Thomas is a do-gooder. He has to rescue people. Just like he rescued sally. He's not gonna turn his back on the mother of his child.", "Justin: Not if he thinks she's dying.", "Bill: Spectra doesn't exist without thomas! If he's out of the picture, they're out of business.", "Justin: This all rests on your lie.", "Bill: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: So, my cousin is dying, and I'm only now finding out about it.", "Sally: She doesn't want anyone else to know. Thomas only told me so I'd understand why he went back to new york. Look, I never would have blurted it out. I just -- I assumed... you're family.", "Liam: [ Sighs ] Oh, I can't believe this.", "Sally: I'm so sorry, liam. For you, and for your family.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Do you want me to forward this e-mail to wyatt?", "Katie: I can go over it with him.", "Brooke: You haven't wrapped things up yet?", "Katie: No, not quite.", "Brooke: I know I keep saying this, but you two really do make an incredible team.", "Katie: Does that surprise you?", "Brooke: You're both very different.", "Katie: Yeah, I -- I suppose we are, in some ways, but we have at least one thing in common -- we tend to look for happiness in all the wrong places.", "Brooke: I think with everything going on in the world today, wherever you can find happiness, it can't be wrong.", "Katie: Hmm.", "Brooke: Everybody needs to have some joy in their life, and when you find it, you've got to just run with it.", "Katie: You know, I've been thinking of doing just that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Only thomas and sally think caroline is dying. I don't want this getting out, and neither does caroline.", "Justin: I can't believe she's going along with this.", "Bill: Well, it took a lot of convincing, and she's not gonna put up with it for long. But before you know it, there's gonna be a miraculous recovery, and she and douglas and thomas can live happily ever after.", "Justin: What about sally?", "Bill: What about her? She stole from the forresters. She lured thomas away from his family. Not to mention the fact that she's a blight on the fashion industry. I'm not gonna let somebody like that stand in the way of my legacy. Or one of my greatest professional achievements.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Door opens ]", "Sally: Steffy.", "Steffy: Hope this isn't a bad time.", "Sally: No.", "Steffy: It's, uh, kind of quiet around here.", "Sally: Well, we're still coming down from monaco.", "Steffy: Shouldn't you be gearing up? The summit gave you a lot of momentum.", "Sally: Yeah, and we want to use that, but, you know, we can take a little time to enjoy our success.", "Steffy: Mm. You surprised a lot of people in monaco. You put on a decent show.", "Sally: Thank you, princess.", "Steffy: I just think it could be your last.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Hey.", "Wyatt: Hey.", "Liam: Uh, glad I texted you. I -- I thought you'd be at spencer.", "Wyatt: No, yeah, I'm -- I'm here. What's up?", "Liam: Uh... nothing. Just -- I'm -- I don't know -- touching base. I feel like -- I feel like with everything that's going on lately, I'm really out of touch.", "Wyatt: Don't let dad hear you say that. He'll make us do another one of those guys' nights.", "Liam: [ Laughing ] Yeah. Hey, speaking of father-son bonding, did you -- you happen to talk to thomas at all about going to new york?", "Wyatt: While we were in monaco?", "Liam: Yeah, like -- like that he wants to stay there with douglas and caroline? Did you --", "Wyatt: Uh, apparently, but no, we didn't -- we didn't talk about it. Why?", "Liam: I don't know, man. I don't know. I'm just -- I was interviewing sally earlier, and stuff came up, and I... I don't know.", "Wyatt: Like what?", "Liam: Like that it's not a visit. That he -- he wants to stay there indefinitely.", "Wyatt: Really?", "Liam: Yeah, okay, so you haven't heard about this? You don't know anything about what I'm saying?", "Wyatt: Nope. No, I --", "Liam: Well, have you talked to caroline?", "Wyatt: Why? Should I have?", "Wyatt: Look, if -- if thomas and caroline want to get back together, I don't know, I think that's great.", "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, that's good news.", "Wyatt: Yeah. It's a little unexpected...", "Liam: Right.", "Wyatt: And probably not good for spectra.", "Liam: Yeah, I was, uh, thinking about that. Thomas and sally were really tight, and caroline comes to town, and suddenly thomas is on leave in new york. How does that happen?", "Wyatt: I don't know. I'm not the one to ask, dude. You know? I barely saw caroline this trip. Every time she came by the office, I was in a meeting. Dad probably saw her more than i did.", "Liam: Dad did?", "Wyatt: You know he's gonna be happy to hear about this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Oh! Hi. Hi, liam.", "Liam: Hey.", "Katie: Sorry, uh, pam said you were in here.", "Wyatt: Oh, uh, you need me?", "Katie: Yeah.", "Liam: I'm gonna take off. I'm gonna -- I'm gonna go.", "Wyatt: Wait, you're taking off? You just got here.", "Liam: No, I just -- I have, uh... I got to see someone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: So you didn't come here to congratulate me, then.", "Steffy: I did, but I just wanted to give you a heads up. Thomas could be in new york for a very long time, and I don't want you deluding yourself. Thomas got caught up in the romance of saving you and saving the company. But he didn't just go to new york for douglas. He went for caroline, too.", "Sally: Yeah. I know.", "Steffy: They're very connected.", "Sally: Well, she's the mother of his child. Thomas cares about her.", "Steffy: So then you realize what that means.", "Sally: Maybe more than you do.", "Steffy: I doubt that.", "Sally: Look, I know you want thomas back with caroline. You encouraged her to come here with douglas.", "Steffy: And that doesn't upset you?", "Sally: No, because I know right now that spending time with douglas and caroline is exactly where thomas needs to be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Okay, that is off. Everything at spencer is under control, and we won't be interrupted. But you know what? Just to be safe, I should maybe lock the door.", "Katie: No, no, no. I don't think that's necessary.", "Wyatt: I'm very sorry to hear that.", "Katie: So, what was up with liam? He rushed out of here.", "Wyatt: No idea. He seemed distracted, like, not himself.", "Katie: Yeah. I noticed that.", "Wyatt: Yeah. Must be going around. I, uh...I ran into steffy earlier.", "Katie: Oh.", "Wyatt: And, uh, she said that she thought I was happy.", "Katie: And that's unusual for you?", "Wyatt: Well, I didn't think so, but she apparently noticed a difference, and then recognized the look on my face and asked if there was a new woman in my life.", "Katie: Huh. Interesting.", "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.", "Katie: Yeah, uh, brooke and i kind of had the same conversation.", "Wyatt: Oh. What'd you tell her?", "Katie: What did you tell steffy?", "Wyatt: [ Laughs ] I didn't tell her that I can't stop thinking about the woman who just works right across the hall.", "Katie: Okay, good. That's great. That's good you didn't say that.", "Wyatt: Yeah, it was probably a good idea. What about you?", "Katie: I didn't say anything. Not a word.", "Wyatt: Not a hint?", "Katie: No. Mnh-mnh.", "Wyatt: Huh.", "Katie: [ Giggles ]", "Wyatt: What about that smile you got going on? You didn't think that was gonna give anything away?", "Katie: No, actually, I -- I smile quite a lot.", "Wyatt: Mm.", "Katie: I think that she, um, she's happy that I'm happy, even though she doesn't know the reason.", "Wyatt: Right. And let's not tell her. I don't mind keeping this our little secret.", "Katie: Right.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Katie: Our little secret.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Just a matter of time, sky, and you'll be the most beautiful tower on the L.A. Skyline.", "Liam: I thought you'd given up on that thing.", "Bill: Never. She's getting built right where I want her.", "Liam: Yeah? Is that so?", "Bill: All right, what is it, liam? You come barging in here without knocking. Something wrong?", "Liam: I don't know, dad. You tell me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: What are you doing?", "Wyatt: I am kissing you.", "Katie: Yeah. Why?", "Wyatt: Because you like it when I do.", "Katie: Mm.", "Wyatt: Come on! I am attracted to you, and you're attracted to me, and i think you're amazing.", "Katie: Yeah, well, this city is full of amazing women.", "Wyatt: Right. And they're out there, and you're in here. And for some reason, I am still trying to convince you to just shut this brain off, let go, and have some fun. And be in this moment right here, right now, with me. And just so you know... I'm going to kiss you again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: So you don't have a problem with my brother being in new york?", "Sally: Thomas is doing what's right for his family.", "Steffy: Douglas and caroline need him. I'm just really surprised you're okay with it.", "Sally: I wish this trip wasn't necessary and the situation was different for our upcoming showing and for a lot of reasons. But I understand why thomas needs to be there for caroline and their son.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Got something to say, say it, liam.", "Liam: Okay. All right. Um... it's about caroline. You know thomas is in new york with her, right?", "Bill: It's about time he stepped up for his family.", "Liam: Yeah. About time.", "Bill: Damn right. He's got a son to raise. He can't be wasting time with sally spectra, blowing his money on bad investments.", "Liam: Yeah, and with thomas gone, it's only a matter of time before spectra's gone, too. Right?", "Bill: Spectra should have been gone a long time ago. And thomas should be in new york where he belongs.", "Liam: Yeah, I get that. Douglas is at an age where he needs his father. I commend thomas being there for him.", "Bill: Okay, then, what's the problem? You come in here like you have an ax to grind, but we agree.", "Liam: Well, dad, uh, I heard something pretty shocking today. Something that actually concerns me. In fact, it concerns our entire family, and I -- I almost didn't believe it, considering where i heard it from. So I'm -- I'm at spectra, right? And I'm interviewing sally, of all people, about the summit, and she tells me something about caroline, something that she assumes I know because I am her family. You want to know what -- sally said that caroline is dying. Oh, so you knew.", "Bill: She shouldn't have said anything.", "Liam: Why didn't you say anything? To me! To wyatt! You know I saw wyatt today, right?", "Bill: You didn't tell him.", "Liam: No. No, I didn'T. Because sally said it's a secret.", "Bill: And it's going to stay that way. Because caroline wants it to be confidential. She came to me for my help.", "Liam: Because she's sick?", "Bill: Yes.", "Liam: Okay. With what?", "Bill: With a rare auto-immune disease. She's being cared for by the best doctors in new york.", "Liam: Your doctors?", "Bill: I'm giving caroline all the support I can.", "Liam: Oh, well, then, i suppose you gave thomas a good talking to, as well, about his responsibilities.", "Bill: Yes, I did. I told him he has to be there for his family.", "Liam: And yet, that leaves spectra without their lead designer. Do you know -- thomas actually called sally when I was in their office today, and he said that he would be gone for months and that she would have to run the company herself.", "Bill: Yes, liam. Because that's where his focus needs to be, on his family.", "Liam: And yet, here you are, talking to your skyscraper. Hmm... it's weird, you know? All this could really work out to your advantage. Thomas is in new york, caroline gets her family back, spectra's vulnerable, they could fail. All you have to do is swoop in and take advantage...", "Bill: You're forgetting one thing, liam.", "Liam: Yes! That's right! I am forgetting one thing. All this cool stuff is happening because your niece is dying. Mm. Is she, dad? Is caroline dying?"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnYZFXfusrw"}
