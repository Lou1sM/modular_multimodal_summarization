        "Thorne stands his ground when Hector asks him to leave his house now. He manages to get Taylor to leave. Hector remarks he knows he wants answers, but he does not have any. He says it was an accident but Darla fell into the path of a car. Thorne offers that he's only making excuses for the monster that killed his wife. He's going to find the son of a bitch who did this and on Darla's grave make him pay! Hector calls Taylor and warns her that Thorne is heading to her house. He gives it one last ditch effort to get her not to reveal her complicity in the case. They would lose it all.",
        "Felicia and Dante panic when they realize Dino is missing but they vow to track him down with a Global Positioning System by the PDA and a laptop. They head to the Van Nuys Airport. Dino is riding in a car driven by a man, seeming okay. They find him aboard a plane and then Eric shows up and reminds Felicia that he was taking Dino for the day and he did leave a note. He takes the boy for ice cream and Dante confesses his love for Felicia and he won't let her or Dino out of his sight again.",
        "Taylor tells Thorne she doesn't deserve his comfort, but he disagrees. She has been there for him and Alexandria for weeks now. He knows Hector wants him to call off this manhunt, but he vows he never will until he finds this evil person. Breaking down, Taylor tells a shocked Thorne that she knows who it is. She knows who killed Darla. She is the person he is looking for. She killed Darla."

        "Hector: Thorne, I want you to leave now.",
        "Thorne: Not until I find out what's going on here. Taylor, you're hiding something from me. What is it?",
        "Felicia: Oh my God, Dante! Where is he? Where is our son?",
        "Dante: There's walls around the whole property. He's got to be here, okay?",
        "Felicia: We've looked! What? What, Dante?",
        "Dante: There was an electrician guy here earlier. He was fixing one of the security cameras outside because it was broken.",
        "Felicia: Do you think he took our son?",
        "Dante: I don't know. There was also a delivery guy here as well.",
        "Felicia: Oh my God! He's been kidnapped.",
        "Dante: You don't know that! Hold on a second, okay? Who would do such a thing?",
        "Felicia: You just said who!",
        "Dante: I was thinking out loud! I don't know!",
        "Felicia: Well, the delivery guy, the electrician -- I've got to call the police. The PDA is in the diaper bag. It's gone.",
        "Dante: What?",
        "Felicia: Oh my God! Somebody took our son, Dante.",
        "Dante: Your PDA was in the bag?",
        "Felicia: Yes. Absolutely.",
        "Dante: Wait a second. Your PDA has got a GPS system. A global positioning system. If we find the PDA, we find him, okay?",
        "Felicia: How do we track it?",
        "Dante: We just need a laptop. Your laptop. Come on, let's go inside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: That's enough, Thorne. You're not welcome here.",
        "Thorne: I'm not going anywhere until someone tells me what the hell is going on.",
        "Hector: Taylor is dealing with a family matter, okay? Something to do with her daughter, Phoebe. I have a teenage daughter myself, so there is nothing that we can't solve.",
        "Thorne: I was just with Phoebe. She's concerned about her mother. She's concerned about you, Hector.",
        "Hector: Yeah, well, she's a confused young woman.",
        "Thorne: Well, I don't think she is.",
        "Hector: After everything Ridge has put this family through -- you think it's had an effect?",
        "Thorne: Taylor, go on home okay? Be with Phoebe. Hector and I are going to talk alone.",
        "Taylor: I don't really think that's a good idea.",
        "Hector: No, it is a good idea. You should be home with Phoebe. Taylor.",
        "Thorne: Go ahead, okay. We'll talk later.",
        "Taylor: I'm sorry.",
        "Hector: It's your turn. Take off.",
        "Thorne: Not until I get the answers I'm looking for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: Thank you, thank you, thank you, lt. Baker. We appreciate your help. How long does this thing take?!",
        "Dante: Almost there. It should take just a second.",
        "Felicia: I never should have left him outside.",
        "Dante: It's not your fault.",
        "Felicia: It is. He's my responsibility, Dante!",
        "Dante: We're going to get him back. Okay, I got the signal for the P.D.A.",
        "Felicia: Where is he?",
        "Dante: Van Nuys.",
        "Felicia: That's only 15 miles from here.",
        "Dante: They're moving.",
        "Felicia: Oh my God. I'm calling Lt. Baker back!",
        "Dante: From the car. Let's go. From the car. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: I know you want answers. But I don't have them for you. Nobody does.",
        "Thorne: I came here to help Taylor.",
        "Hector: I'm helping now, okay? Look, I know you want answers. And if I were you, I would too. But coming over here, it's not going to help you find her killer. Your time would be better spent at home with your little girl.",
        "Thorne: I'll deal with what happened to Darla and Alexandria as I see fit. But there's something going on between you and Taylor -- something that has Phoebe worried. Are you hassling them, Hector?",
        "Hector: I'm a friend that Taylor's leaning on. Okay?",
        "Thorne: She has family.",
        "Hector: Who? The Forresters? You discarded her like a piece of trash.",
        "Thorne: If you're pushing her into a relationship, Hector --",
        "Hector: I am giving her the respect that your family couldn't manage to at a time when she needed it the most. Thorne, you know I did everything I could to save Darla's life, don't you?",
        "Thorne: Yes, I do.",
        "Hector: Well, the truth of the matter is that that night has stayed with me. And Taylor and Phoebe too. It was horrifying, what happened. It rocked all of our lives. Yours, too. Your wife, to see a sweet, innocent person like that lose their life -- and everybody's blaming themselves. Phoebe, for calling Darla. I blame myself because -- I don't know, maybe I could have done more.",
        "Thorne: And Taylor?",
        "Hector: She wishes that -- she'd gotten there sooner. Thorne, there is something that you have to know about what happened that night. Something that I haven't told anyone. And you may hate me for telling you this, but it's the God's honest truth of what happened. And none of us are going to find any peace until you hear it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Are they still on Sherman way?",
        "Felicia: Yeah. Going west.",
        "Dante: Don't worry. We'll get 'em.",
        "Felicia: What if we lose the signal over the canyon, Dante?",
        "Dante: We'll pick it up on the other side. Besides, the police is tracking them too.",
        "Felicia: My Dominic. He's going to be all right. He's going to be okay. They've stopped!",
        "Dante: What?",
        "Felicia: At Van Nuys airport! My God, they're taking our son.",
        "Dante: Hold on.",
        "Felicia: Hurry!",
        "Dante: Hold on!",
        "[Tires screeching]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: The night Darla died, changing a tire -- a lug nut was stuck and she was leaning on the tire iron to pop it loose when she lost her balance and fell into the road. It was in the police report that Phoebe gave.",
        "Thorne: What difference does that make?",
        "Hector: The person that hit her -- Thorne, it was dark. It was foggy. You gotta understand.",
        "Thorne: Understand what, hector? Understand what? That you're making excuses for the monster who killed my wife?",
        "Hector: All I'm saying is that it was an accident.",
        "Thorne: This was not Darla's fault. She was run down, Hector. She was hit by a car and she was killed. And the son of a bitch fled. I'm going to find them. And on Darla's grave, I'm going to make damn sure that they pay.",
        "Hector: Finding the person responsible, Thorne, is not going to bring Darla back. It was an accident. Accept it. That's where you and Alexandria are going to find your peace.",
        "Thorne: I don't know why you're bringing this up, and I don't care. But you stay away from phoebe. You stay away from me. And you leave Taylor the hell alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Dino? Oh my God, Dino. Hey buddy. Hey buddy.",
        "Eric: Dante? Mr. Forrester --",
        "Eric: What's going on?",
        "Felicia: Daddy, Dominic's been with you all day?",
        "Eric: Yeah, what are you doing here?",
        "Felicia: Dante and I came out of the guest house and he was gone.",
        "Eric: I told you that I was going to take him today.",
        "Felicia: Well, I completely forgot.",
        "Eric: Well, he's okay.",
        "Felicia: Thank God. We were scared to death.",
        "Dante: We called the police. They should be here any minute.",
        "Felicia: Dante tracked you using the GPS on my phone, which was in the baby bag.",
        "Eric: You tracked me with your GPS? I needed to pick up some papers that I left aboard, and we were going to get some ice cream. I left you a note.",
        "Felicia: No you didn't.",
        "Eric: Yes I did. The wind must have blown it over. Oh, for God's sake. The police are here. Look, I'll straighten this whole thing out, but the baby is okay.",
        "Felicia: Dante, I'm so sorry.",
        "Dante: You okay?",
        "Felicia: Yeah, I am now. Sweetie, I am never going to let you leave my sight again.",
        "Dante: And I'm never going to let you leave my side again -- either one of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Taylor: Hello?",
        "Hector: Taylor, Thorne's on his way to see you.",
        "Taylor: Okay.",
        "Hector: Now, listen to me, Taylor. I told him that what happened to Darla was an accident. It was no one's fault.",
        "Taylor: Hector, don't lie for me anymore. It doesn't suit you.",
        "Hector: I'm not lying. Taylor, you're going through the same hell that I am. You're a good person with a conscience. But to be in jail, everything that we have -- our families, our purpose -- we would lose it all.",
        "Taylor: I know you care about me. I know you're coming from a place of concern. But I'm not changing my mind.",
        "Hector: Taylor --",
        "Taylor: I'm sorry, Hector. Good-bye.",
        "Hector: Taylor?!",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Felicia: So do you think my dad felt guilty?",
        "Dante: About scaring us to death?",
        "Felicia: I should've remembered that it was his day to be with Dominic.",
        "Dante: Well, he did leave a note.",
        "Felicia: Well, I figure they're having ice cream about now, so all is forgiven. Now, about this thing you were saying about never letting me leave your side again?",
        "Dante: Never.",
        "Felicia: Don't say something you don't mean.",
        "Dante: Okay, I won't.",
        "Felicia: Dante, we were just afraid that our son had been abducted. I'm not going to stand here and take advantage of your frayed nerves.",
        "Dante: Frayed nerves? 'Fraid not.",
        "Felicia: You are buzzing with adrenaline. So you are going to start saying stuff to me like we need to be together. You need us. That we should be a family. And then the adrenaline buzz is going to wear off and you're going to be like, \"what did I just say?\" We've been down this road before, right? Remember?",
        "Dante: For someone that I want to spend the rest of my life with, you're missing the whole point.",
        "Felicia: See! You're doing it already -- \"spend the rest of my life with you.\" Look, you just had a really bad scare and that's why you're saying right now.",
        "Dante: That's why I told your father the same thing that I'm telling you now before this whole thing started with Dino.",
        "Felicia: My father? Before?",
        "Dante: Yes, that's why I went to the house earlier.",
        "Felicia: What? Sorry, I'm really not very good at keeping my mouth shut.",
        "Dante: Try.",
        "Felicia: You talked to my father?",
        "Dante: I wanted to talk to him. About you and Bridget.",
        "Felicia: Bridget?",
        "Dante: Bridget brought me to you. I would have never come to Los Angeles if it wasn't for her. I would never be able to see you again. I would have never known that I was a father. Look, I'm not one to worry about what's going to happen tomorrow. I just take one day at a time. But I believe in my heart that you came into my life for a reason. And it's just not because we have a son together. We are both blessed to have a beautiful son. But everything about you, that light that's inside of him, is from us. Me and you. And I can't live without that light. Hey. And I can't live without you. Please believe me when I tell you that I -- I love you. And I want to prove that to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: Valor. Truth.",
        "Thorne: Taylor, what you're going through.",
        "Taylor: Thorne, I don't deserve this.",
        "Thorne: Yes, you do. I have leaned on you so much these past few weeks. And you've been there for me. You've been there for Alexandria. You've taken care of us, Taylor. But who's taken care of you?",
        "Taylor: You're the one who's suffering.",
        "Thorne: Taylor, your whole life was built around Ridge and he left you -- we all left you. And I know you're in pain -- you were drinking.",
        "Taylor: After what I've done.",
        "Thorne: Taylor --",
        "Taylor: No, no, you've been there for me. You have done more than enough for me and I don't deserve it.",
        "Thorne: Taylor -- I can see the pain and suffering in your eyes. Please, let me be the person that you can lean on. Okay? I know Hector's a good guy. I know he is. All right? But he thinks he's helping you when I can clearly see that he's not. Taylor, this guy is obsessed with you. And he thinks he has the right to control your life. Not to mention the things that he said about Darla.",
        "Taylor: What did he say?",
        "Thorne: Maybe he's trying to get me to move on to -- I don't know. To drop this manhunt. But to forgive, to forget the man who killed my wife? Never, Taylor. And I'm not going to rest until I find him. There'll be no closure, no peace, no justice until I find the bastard who did this. It was an accident. Why did he run? Why didn't he stop? There are good people in this world -- like you and like Darla. But the person that did this -- that person is evil! And I'm going to find him. And when I do --",
        "Taylor: Thorne -- your search is over.",
        "Thorne: What?",
        "Taylor: The person you're looking for --",
        "Thorne: Taylor?",
        "Taylor: I know who did it. The person who killed Darla is haunted by it every day and every night. And it wasn't a hit and run. The person stopped and they pulled over. And they went over to Darla. And they saw that beautiful, caring life. And they saw her in pain. The person you hate -- the coward who didn't have the strength to stand up and confess this awful crime -- it's -- it's me. Thorne, I did it. It's me. I'm the one. I'm the one who killed Darla. I killed Darla."
