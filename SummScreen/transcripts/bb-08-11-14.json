{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Hope is waiting for Liam; Liam sees her on the other side of the river. Ivy tells him to go. Quinn comes along and pushes Ivy off the railing into the Seine. Liam hears her splash and turns around. He looks at Hope, he looks at Ivy needing help. Aly is on the internet thinking good thoughts about Hope and Liam, finally. She goes on and on about Hope's message and how much it means to her. So many people tried to keep them apart but they are meant to be .an incredible reunion. And Quinn is far away unable to touch them this time. Liam will always be Hope's knight in shining armor. Oliver says just like them. Quinn is at an outdoor cafe and wishes she were closer to watch Hope. She spies a guy who leaves his binoculars unattended for a minute and she grabs them. Wyatt is still standing underneath the tree so he can keep eyes on Hope. He hopes for Liam not to show. Deacon knocks on the door at FC and brings in coffee and donuts for Brooke. She frowns but tells him quickly get in before Pam sees these store bought things. She fills him in that today could be a very big day for their daughter. Liam is on his way to Paris to meet Hope. She does not think there is a chance that he won't show. Deacon deducts that Brooke prefers Liam over Wyatt. She says just that she thinks Liam is more Hope's type. She likes Wyatt fine but she's glad that Quinn is not in Hope's life any more. Deacon says yeah he did not know how much trouble Quinn could be when he met her. But thank God she is getting treatment and is not interfering with their daughter's life anymore. He glances at his watch and says it is past 3 in Paris right now so something big could be happening. Brooke says yes finally Hope and Liam together.", "Liam pulls Ivy out of the Seine and they lay exhausted in the shallow water on the beach. She tells him that she is fine so go find Hope. He runs off and scooting through the crowds almost in a panic. Quinn looks through the binoculars and mocks Hope by saying she looks worried that Liam isn't going to show and doesn't love her after all ..well not as much as Wyatt. Quinn glances at her phone and sees it is past 3 o'clock, doesn't bode well for Liam. Hope too looks at her phone and no messages from Liam. Fairly close to their sacred spot Liam spots a young blonde lady from the back and is sure it is Hope. He goes up to her and puts his hand on her shoulder and turns her around. She is not Hope and she looks at Liam like he's some creep and runs off."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Ivy: There she is!", "Liam: I know!", "Ivy: Liam, go!", "Liam: Yeah?", "Ivy: Go! Yeah! I'm gonna stay here and take a photo! Aah!", "Liam: Ivy? Ivy? Ivy! Ivy?!", "Ivy: Liam, go!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Bells chiming]", "Brooke: I will let you know if hope calls me, and you do the same. You let me know if hope calls you, okay? Thanks, Aly. Bye. Uh... [Chuckles] Oh, okay.", "Deacon: Good morning, sunshine. I have coffee, and I have doughnuts.", "Brooke: Deacon.", "Deacon: Do you still like those maple bars?", "Brooke: [Sighs] Okay. Get in here and shut the door. And don't let Pam see that you brought anything store-bought! [Scoffs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Oliver: Bonjour, mademoiselle. Big day for Forrester, Hope for the Future.", "Aly: Especially hope and Liam.", "Oliver: Any word?", "Aly: Well, I talked to my uncle Rick. He said the photo shoot and press conference went well.", "Oliver: Another Wyatt fuller production.", "Aly: Yeah, I hate to say it, but I got to hand it to him. He knows how to create a buzz.", "Oliver: Return of the Hope for the Future diamond, paris, the Eiffel tower. C'est magnifique.", "Aly: And then the real show takes place. Hope and Liam together again finally.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: So, Brooke, um, something going on with hope?", "Brooke: Why do you say that?", "Deacon: Oh, you know, I just -- I heard you on the phone, and it sounded like there was good news. Oh, come on. I'm her father. Please? Please? I deserve to know.", "Brooke: She's in paris.", "Deacon: Yeah. With Wyatt.", "Brooke: Mm... Liam's on his way.", "Deacon: Uh-oh.", "Brooke: No. No, it's okay. She wanted him to come. She's not sure if he's going to or not, but she's gonna find out very soon. I have a feeling this is going to be a very big moment in our daughter's life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: She is so beautiful. You know, Brooke couldn't have picked a better name. Hope is exactly what she gives so many people around the world, an example of how to live your life from a place of self-respect and strength, an appreciation for the world around us. You know, you have no idea of the pressures girls face today. It's overwhelming, especially since the majority of our role models are anything but. But hope gives us a different way. And hearing her message and applying it to my own life, I can't tell you how many times that pulled me through when I felt lost and confused.", "Oliver: I think you're both pretty special.", "Aly: Hope and Liam have been through so much together. It's crazy how many people have tried to keep them apart.", "Oliver: Like Quinn.", "Aly: Well, it doesn't matter. They're meant to be. Does that sound silly?", "Oliver: No. No, not at all.", "Aly: That's why they're in paris, having an incredible reunion. And Quinn is far away, unable to touch them this time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Merci. Oh, where are you, hope? I should have picked somewhere closer.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Cell phone rings] Hey. I'm about to leave right now. Okay, bye.", "Wyatt: Don't come, Liam. Don't show.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: [Coughing] The current! My clothes are weighing me down! It's -- it's too much! [Coughing]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: All right, let me see if I get this straight. So, if Liam shows up at the Eiffel tower, then he and hope, they -- they recommit to each other, right?", "Brooke: Right.", "Deacon: Okay. What happens if he doesn't?", "Brooke: I don't think we have to worry about that. He's on his way.", "Deacon: It's a long flight, a lot of time to think things over, you know? What happens if, uh, if the kid gets cold feet? I mean, do you think that hope would move on?", "Brooke: Well, hope thinks Wyatt's a great guy, and I guess I could see her having a life with him if Liam doesn't show, but I don't think that's gonna happen.", "Deacon: No, I think you're right. I mean -- I mean, Liam's crazy about her. And for one thing, she's your daughter. That's just -- you know, she's -- she's her own person, though, right?", "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, she's, um... she's different from me. I really respect the choices that she's made.", "Deacon: Yeah, I just still can't believe that I had anything to do with making that amazing human being. You know, people say that kids, they're our greatest teachers. You know, like, they -- I don't know, they -- they push us to, uh, to uncover issues that we've buried and all that sort of stuff. For me, I mean, hope is the complete opposite of that. Whenever I'd have a really crummy day, I was really struggling, I-I would close my eyes, and I would -- I would think of her face, and I would hear that laugh. And it was like every good thing in the world that I was starting to question, it was restored. Faith.", "Brooke: Hope.", "Deacon: Our daughter deserves to have the best, somebody who truly, truly understands just how spectacular she is.", "Brooke: Yeah. And Wyatt and Liam both do.", "Deacon: Well, they better, all right?", "Brooke: [Chuckles]", "Deacon: The Spencer boys. Oh! So, which one do you like?", "Brooke: Oh, no. No, I am leaving that all up to hope. That is her decision. What about you? Who do you prefer?", "Deacon: I don't know Wyatt that well, but the kid's pulled himself up by his own boot straps. I mean, he's made his own dough, given our daughter a hell of a big rock. I mean, how would you not want hope to be with a guy like that?", "Brooke: Well, Wyatt's fun, you know. He makes her happy. Uh, he's just a little maybe too carefree for hope. I just picture her with somebody more solid, and Liam is that. He's a true, true gentleman. You always know that he's going to do the right thing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: I got you. Head above water?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: Well, they should be together by now.", "Oliver: I bet Wyatt's seriously bumming.", "Aly: Sometimes I almost feel sorry for him.", "Oliver: Having a mother like Quinn?", "Aly: That woman is crazy scary.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Both chuckle] Excusez-moi, monsieur. Oui, monsieur?", "[Speaking French] No. [Speaking French] Just five minutes ago. Excusez-moi, Madame.", "[Speaking French]", "Quinn: I'm sorry. Oh, binoculars?", "Quinn: No, I'm sorry. I didn't see any.", "[Speaking French] Oui, merci.", "Quinn: Ah, yes. There you are. Oh! Excuse me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Yeah?", "Sara: I know you.", "Hope: Oh, hi! Hi. Uh, I'm -- I'm hope. Hi.", "Sara: I'm Sara. Nice to meet you.", "Hope: It's nice to meet you, too, Sara.", "Sara: Can I take a picture with you?", "Hope: Oh, yeah! Oh... yeah, absolutely.", "Sara: Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Hope: You're very welcome. Bye. Au revoir.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: [Coughing] [Breathing heavily]", "Ivy: [Coughing] Thank you. [Chuckles]", "Liam: [Breathing heavily]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Oliver: You know, I doubt hope and Liam will be posting selfies from the Eiffel tower.", "Aly: I know, but I'm so curious.", "Oliver: You really care about those two, things working out for them.", "Aly: I followed their relationship from the beginning. It's so sweet and romantic. Liam understands hope, who she is, how she leads her life. Just two good people who really complement one another.", "Oliver: Like... you and me. That's pretty epic. Liam racing to paris, saving hope from Wyatt's evil clutches.", "Aly: Her knight in shining armor.", "Oliver: Every girl's got to have one.", "Aly: And for hope, it'll always be Liam.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: So, you prefer Liam?", "Brooke: I just think that Liam is more hope's type.", "Deacon: Why? Because he's a gentleman? Meaning Wyatt isn't?", "Brooke: No, Wyatt is wonderful. He is. They just have a different set of morals. I mean, it's not really Wyatt's fault. After all, he was raised by Quinn.", "Deacon: [Chuckles]", "Brooke: He could have turned out a lot worse. I'm just glad that she's not involved in hope's life anymore.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Merci. Oh, hope. You're starting to look a little worried. \"Oh, Liam, I thought you'd be here by now. I guess you don't love me after all.\" [Chuckles] He doesn't. Not as much as Wyatt.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Oh, my.", "Liam: Are you -- are you okay? Did you swallow water?", "Ivy: No -- I mean, I did, but I'm fine.", "Liam: We got to get you cleaned up.", "Ivy: No, no! Liam, you have to go and meet hope!", "Liam: Wh-- are you sure?", "Ivy: Yes.", "Liam: Are you serious?", "Ivy: Yes! Thank you, but go.", "Liam: All right. Okay. Okay! Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Ooh. Past 3:00. All's not well for you, Liam.", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: You know, it really is too bad that I didn't realize how much trouble Quinn was when I first met her.", "Brooke: She hid it from all of us. I understand wanting the best for your child, but she really closed the line.", "Deacon: [Chuckles] You think? Well, look, at least she's getting the help she needs. She's not interfering with our daughter anymore. Guess what? It's after 3:00 in paris.", "Brooke: Yep.", "Deacon: [French accent] Ze big moment has arrived.", "Brooke: [Laughs] It's a big moment. Yes. Hope and Liam...finally together."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCj0wrl7-M8"}
