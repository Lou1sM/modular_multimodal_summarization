        "Thomas sees Steffy's face and wants to know what is wrong. She tells him to close the door. Their cousin is dead. He says do not keep saying it is her fault. She says it is not a matter of fault. She does not know what she could have done to change facts. She says she was calm but firm. Aly intended to kill her, she even told her because she was selfish and a slut and took her dad's job. But she did not run, she stayed. She thought at one point she got through to her. Steffy said it did not happen quite like she said previously. Aly did not just fall. Steffy had picked up the tire iron and hit her. Eric asks the wedding guests to adjoin outside and give the Avants a chance to talk. Maya says no, she wants everyone to hear. She asks her father to say again how he feels about her. He says whatever problems they have is in the past. He will not be publically called out and humiliated like this. She tells him no it is not in the past. And he can not give something away today that he has already thrown away. Maya tells him she overheard him at the bottom of the stairs. They stand and rant back and forth of how Maya was raised. He does claim that he loved her but kept his distance as he did not know how to raise a boy as a girl. He says he has tried but there are certain things he can not accept. She wonders why he is here at all. He came to get Nicole and that did not work, but he is sticking around. Thomas tells Steffy that her mind is playing tricks on her. She says no, she was in shock earlier but now she remembers. She thought everything was okay but out of nowhere Aly got the tire iron and swung at her. It fell and so did Steffy but she did get hold of the tire iron and swung at Aly. Thomas says then it was self defense. She does not have to tell anyone. Aly threatened her life, that simple. He has lost one sister already and he will not lose another. Talking now will not bring Aly back.",
        "Julius stands tall and tells them the story of his father's life, Myron, as a 15 year old in Chicago that had to work day jobs to keep a roof over his head. And he worked hard until he saved enough money to make his own business. Vivienne cringes when Julius says his father also gave him a severance check and told him his Myron was a disgrace to the whole family. Julius has tears by now and listens as Vivienne says she is staying for her daughter's wedding; Julius can just go. He tries to convince her how unnatural this is. She asys no, the most unnatural thing in her life was when she had to turn her face away from her own child. And she went along with that and she wishes a thousand times that she could undo that and she hopes the Lord will forgive her for being so weak then. He hopes she is happy now, breaking up the little bit of family that she had. Maya tells him that she is proud of who she is and she does not want him here any more than he wants to be here, so just go and let her be. He walks out. Rick asks what she needs. She says she thinks she has it all now. Vivienne asks for her forgiveness. She knows she was wrong and she wants to say now how sorry she is. She wasted her life being weak but she looks at Maya now and realizes how beautiful she is. She tells her she is so proud to be her mother. They hug."

        "Julius: Are you sure? I'm a father, and a father worries.",
        "Maya: I wouldn't know.",
        "Nick: If we're ready to continue...",
        "Vivienne: Maya, you don't want to make everybody wait too long.",
        "Maya: I've been waiting and waiting for this day, and it's finally here. But...nothing's changed. I wonder if you would be more comfortable leaving.",
        "Julius: I'm perfectly fine where I am. Or I am being asked to leave?",

        "Steffy: [Breathing shakily] What?",
        "Thomas: You tell me. You should see your face.",
        "Steffy: Close the door.",
        "Thomas: Steff... something's not right.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Our cousin is dead. Nothing is right about this. I may have killed her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Steff, don't -- don't say that.",
        "Steffy: Not even to you?",
        "Thomas: You can say whatever you want to me, okay? But you've got, um -- oh, what do they call it? Uh... survivor's guilt.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: You -- you were there. You lived and she didn't. And you feel like it's somehow your fault.",
        "Steffy: [Crying] No, it -- I don't.",
        "Thomas: That's not what I'm hearing.",
        "Steffy: It's not a matter of fault. You know, I-I look back at it, and I-I honesty -- I don't know what I could have done differently.",
        "Thomas: Okay, then.",
        "Steffy: It doesn't change the facts.",
        "Thomas: Steff, the fact is it was an accident.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it was.",
        "Thomas: That's all I'm saying.",
        "Steffy: And it wasn't. And you're the only person who knows that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Everyone, let's adjourn outside for a while, give the Avant family some time alone.",
        "Maya: Please don't. I need you all here. Dad...",
        "Julius: Yes?",
        "Maya: I need to ask you again what I am to you.",
        "Julius: I do not think this is the time and place for that.",
        "Maya: I think it is.",
        "Julius: Show some respect. I'm your father.",
        "Maya: Trying to give you the respect that you demand and believing that, someday, you would come around was almost the end of me.",
        "Vivienne: What are you saying, Maya?",
        "Maya: How could you?",
        "Julius: I will not be called out. I will not be publicly embarrassed by my own flesh and blood. Now, whatever problems we had, it's in the past now. I am here to do my fatherly duties.",
        "Maya: And what duty is that?",
        "Julius: To give you away at your wedding.",
        "Maya: You can't give away something you've already thrown away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Steff, you've got to stop carrying this around.",
        "Steffy: Easier said than done.",
        "Thomas: You can't hold yourself responsible for something that nobody could have foreseen.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] She was unraveling. I tried to confront her, and I-I was firm but yet I was calm. I don't know.",
        "Thomas: And how did she take that?",
        "Steffy: She planned to kill me. It was not an impulse.",
        "Thomas: I don't know that a nail in your tire proves that.",
        "Steffy: No, she -- she told me. She wanted me to know all the reasons why she did it. Oh, because I'm -- because I'm a slut and I'm -- I'm selfish and I'm a taker and I-I took Liam and I-I took her dad's job.",
        "Thomas: Okay, but none of that makes what happened to Aly your fault.",
        "Steffy: You know, why didn't I just run? I don't get it. Why didn't I just run? A part of me just feels like maybe I -- maybe I wanted her to realize that judging other people's lives was ruining her life. I really thought I got through to her, and she was going on about being lost and empty. [Chuckles] And then she attacked me.",
        "Thomas: Don't make yourself relive that again.",
        "Steffy: But I-I wasn't remembering it right before.",
        "Thomas: What does that matter? Huh? She fell. She hit her head.",
        "Steffy: No. No, it... I hit her. I picked up the tire iron, and I swung it. It hit her, and she fell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Do you think this is right, what you're doing? Or is this your new Los Angeles morals? Is that what it promotes?",
        "Rick: Maya, what's happening?",
        "Maya: I heard you.",
        "Brooke: You were right. This is not the time or the place.",
        "Maya: I heard you and what you said right at the bottom of those stairs.",
        "Vivienne: No. What did you hear him saying?",
        "Maya: That he despises me. You always have.",
        "Julius: Despise you? You're my child. I fed and clothed you and kept a roof over your head. And the only thing that I asked for you to give me in return was respect and decency.",
        "Maya: And I could never be decent enough for you, could I, Dad?",
        "Julius: Ah! [Chuckles] So, because I don't agree with what you did to yourself, I'm a bad father?",
        "Maya: How? How did you love me? Did you tuck me in at night? Did you take care of me when I was sick? Did you bathe me? You -- you couldn't bear to touch me.",
        "Julius: I didn't want to touch you!",
        "Maya: Good! Say it to my face!",
        "Julius: Listen, even your mother --",
        "Maya: No, no, no! Don't you blame her. She loved me enough to keep me away from you, to send me upstairs to play and do homework when you came home from work, because every time you looked at me, all you saw was something wrong.",
        "Julius: I saw a son who was afraid to be a man.",
        "Vivienne: Julius, leave her alone.",
        "Maya: I couldn't be what I never was.",
        "Julius: See, that's the problem. That's the problem. See, your TV shows, yeah, your blogs and your internet, it says that everything is okay. Everybody can just do whatever they want. Well, it's not okay! See, a dog can't be a cat. And a boy can't be a girl. And don't you ever say that I didn't pray for you, that I didn't sacrifice for you, that I didn't love you. [Voice breaking] But you see, I didn't know what to do with a child like you. So I thought the best thing that I could do was to give you distance -- distance and a solid foundation.",
        "Rick: Did you ever try to hear what your daughter was telling you? That the life she felt inside was the one that you could not see?",
        "Julius: I didn't have a daughter, mister. I had a son who now stands around in pretty dresses and takes pictures for people instead of building a life for himself. No. Now she's got to rely on you and your money to build that life for himself.",
        "Maya: So, why are you here if all I am to you is a son who failed? You came to whisk Nicole away. That didn't work. Why aren't you gone?",
        "Julius: Because I told you I would try.",
        "Maya: But did you? Or did you fake it?",
        "Julius: There are certain things that just cannot be accepted.",
        "Maya: Like me? And who I am? Because if that's the case, why are you here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Your mind is playing tricks on you.",
        "Steffy: No.",
        "Thomas: It was an accident. She fell. That's what you said.",
        "Steffy: No, I was in shock. It all happened so fast. It was -- it was dark. I had these images in my mind, but -- but now I'm starting to connect them.",
        "Thomas: Don't fill in those blanks if you don't know what happened.",
        "Steffy: No, I do. I do. I do. I... [Sniffles, sighs] I was -- I was changing the tire, and she tried to hit me with her car. And I-I was so furious. And we started to -- we started to argue, but then I-I-I thought everything was okay. And then, out of nowhere, she just grabbed this tire iron, and she tried to attack me, but then I-I managed to knock it out of her hand. And I-I fell. But then she was standing over top of me, and so I-I grabbed the tire iron, and I-I don't -- oh, my God.",
        "Thomas: Are you sure?",
        "Steffy: [Crying] Yes. Oh, my God. [Crying]",
        "Thomas: It was self-defense. She was out of her mind.",
        "Steffy: No, it's -- it was more than that. It was -- it wasn't rational. It -- it was a reflex.",
        "Thomas: It could have been you instead. Do you understand that? Who else did you tell about this?",
        "Steffy: No one. No one, but obviously we have to tell the police.",
        "Thomas: No. No. Why? She threatened your life. Okay, you don't owe anyone anything else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: You and your... California friends think I'm just a small-town man. But let me tell you who I am. I am the proud son of Myron Avant, a proud and strong man who taught himself to read when he was still working on the farm. When he was 15 years old, he hopped a train to Chicago. And when he got there, he slept in parks and alleyways until he found work. And he worked day jobs, painting and -- and roofing until he was able to earn enough money for the first time to get his own room. He worked his way up in the building industry until he was able to start his own business. That's who I named you after -- a self-made man.",
        "Rick: I think you've overstayed your welcome, Julius.",
        "Julius: Rick, does it make you feel secure to know that you have a woman that no other man would want?",
        "[All murmuring]",
        "Julius: Oh, by the way... [Voice breaking] Before my father died, he gave me a severance check and disowned me [Crying] Because he felt that his namesake had disrespected the whole family. [Normal voice] Vivienne.",
        "Vivienne: I'm here for my daughter's wedding. You can go. I'm staying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: It's still an accident.",
        "Steffy: Not exactly.",
        "Thomas: \"It was a reflex\" is what you said.",
        "Steffy: [Breathing shakily] I didn't mean for it to happen. But it did. I --",
        "Thomas: That is the definition of an accident. What happens when somebody dies tragically and, too soon after, the one person who was there changes her story? Don't do it, Steff. It won't bring Aly back. I lost one sister already, and I am not losing you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Be careful, Vivienne. Remember who you are.",
        "Vivienne: I obeyed you for 35 years. You're a hard man to love, but I loved you anyway. I am here to see my daughter get married. I'm staying.",
        "Julius: You mean to tell me you're gonna stand here and witness this freak show?",
        "Rick: How the Hell could you say something like that about your own child?",
        "Julius: No, no, no. Not my child. See, my flesh and blood wasn't good enough. Can't you see how unnatural this is? And all the people here?",
        "Vivienne: Oh, no. Mnh-mnh. You don't tell me about unnatural. The most unnatural thing in my life was the day I had to turn my own child away from my door. You looked at her and you said, \"I don't what you are, and I don't want to know. Be gone.\" \"Be gone\" like you were casting out a demon. And then she looked at me standing there next to you. And I said, \"you heard your father. You don't belong here.\" [Voice breaking] Maya, I am so sorry. The words burn my tongue today. I wished a thousand times I could take it back, but I can't. I only hope the Lord -- [Crying] I only hope the Lord will forgive me, because I can't.",
        "Julius: Are you happy now? You've broken up the little bit of family that you left us with.",
        "Maya: For so long, all I wanted was your acceptance and approval. But I don't care what you think of me. I'm my own woman, and I don't want you here any more than you want to be here. So go. Let me be.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Rick: Tell me what you need.",
        "Maya: I have it. I think I have all of it.",
        "Vivienne: I'm a terrible person. For half my life, I have done wrong to you.",
        "Maya: None of us understood what --",
        "Vivienne: Oh, no. I knew, baby. I knew I was wrong. I did. [Voice breaking] I, um, wanted to call you a hundred times. I wanted to come to you and say I was sorry. I thought my heart would explode with all the love I couldn't give you. I did. I just wasted my life. I wasted my life being weak. Mm-hmm. But you know, I look at you now, and you are so beautiful. Oh. And tougher than heartwood.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Vivienne: You don't look any different than you looked before. You look like yourself. Oh, God. I'm so proud to be your mother.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Vivienne: I didn't do a good job, but I'm still proud.",
