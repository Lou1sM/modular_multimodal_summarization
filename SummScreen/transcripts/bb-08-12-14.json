        "Liam runs up and down the streets by the Seine mumbling and a bumbling, calling out for Hope. Quinn watches with her borrowed binoculars and calls him a drip. Such a dumb gentleman and his reward \u0096 he loses again. She chuckles, damn she's good. Ivy finally catches up to Liam and realizes he never found Hope. She did not wait for him. Liam's phone is dead so they decide Hope might have gone back to FI and go there. Brooke calls FI and Rick tells her that the photo shoot is the buzz and got great reviews. But he has not seen Hope nor Wyatt ..nor Liam either. Bill walks in and tells Brooke to go ahead and call him; he knows she wants to but she doesn't have to as he is standing right there. He wants to convince her to come back to him. She asks if he has spoken to either Liam or Wyatt. He guesses it must be because of Hope. So catch him up to speed. She says before she would have said Hope and Liam could have weathered the storm, but now there is Wyatt. Hope still has feelings for Liam but she's not so sure about him now. Sometimes you can not be pushed beyond the limits. And no matter what happens in Paris, someone is going to be the odd man out. Wyatt sits besides a gloomy Hope and asks if she is okay. She does not answer. He says she can not count on Liam. He never comes through for her. He takes her by the hand. Quinn calls so he leaves Hope for a minute. Quinn asks where he is and he replies on the Spencer jet on his way to Monte Carlo. She makes sure that Hope is still with him. He asks if there is something in particular that she wants. She says she wants him to have everything he wants. He's in such a good position now. Make it count and take control. Then she tells him to make the most of this moment .marry Hope as he might not ever get another chance like this. Wyatt asks if Hope has anything to say about this. She repeats again, just do it. She finishes up and hands the binoculars to the waiter.",
        "Wyatt goes back to Hope and says they will be landing soon. He hates to see her like this. She needs to put Liam aside. He treats her like there is a Hope around every corner, but with him there is not. She needs to be celebrated and loved, not like this. He says Liam is a good person but when it comes to Hope he is an idiot. She needs to just walk away. Do not put up with this disrespect and disappointment. She says it is not easy; he says he can help. They've done it before and now the transportation is better from the truck and trailer to the private jet to this private yacht. He kisses her hand. Liam and Ivy rush into FI to see Rick but he has no clue about Hope. Off the jet, Hope gives a little girl an autograph and a boat picks them up to take to the yacht. They marvel at the splendor. As they pull alongside, a crew is waiting for them. They are at their service for anything they want or need. Wyatt says only one phrase comes to mind ..Hope just needs to think hard. Yes she says Rock 'N' Roll baby. When Liam doesn't find Hope at FI, Rick says she is probably furious that he blew her off ..but just hang around because she has to return. Liam calls Brooke who says she has not heard from her. But not to worry. She probably just needed a little time to herself and she will turn up. Bill is still there so she puts him on speaker phone. Liam tells him that he can not find Hope. Bill says like mother like daughter after major disappointments. But they have gotten through obstacles before and so will this pass. Brooke tells him about Liam rescuing Ivy from the Seine but she just hopes it did not cost him Hope. Ivy tells Liam that she owes him, for his goodness, his chivalry. He did not have an option. She will explain to Hope and she will understand. Rick tells Liam that this is a place he probably doesn't want to go but Hope most likely is with Wyatt. Wyatt finds Hope on the bow and tells her to let Liam go, just let him go. Once and for all put him in the past. He says when the diamond came back into his life he immediately knew that it was meant to be hers. So he wants her to take it as his symbol of unwavering love and commitment to her. And he wants her to say right here, right now that she will marry him."

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So, how are things going?",
        "Rick: Been at International all day, but apparently the press conference did exactly what it was supposed to do. Uh, created all the buzz and excitement around the return of the diamond. Uh, I know that the photo shoot got rave reviews. I should be seeing the images soon.",
        "Brooke: So, it's over?",
        "Rick: Mission accomplished.",
        "Brooke: And Hope is back in her office?",
        "Rick: Uh, no. I haven't seen her. Or Wyatt, now that you mention it.",
        "Brooke: What about Liam?",
        "Rick: No, I haven't seen him, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Excuse me.",

        "Bill: Go ahead. Call me. You know you want to. Of course, there's no need. I'm standing right here.",
        "Brooke: But I guess the question would be, why?",
        "Bill: Come on. You know why. I've got to convince you to come back to me.",
        "Brooke: Have you heard from Liam or Wyatt?",
        "Bill: No. Something happen?",
        "Brooke: I'm not sure. Something was supposed to happen.",
        "Bill: Let me guess. It involves Hope.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Good guess.",
        "Bill: All right. Bring me up to speed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Poor dumb Liam. Such a gentleman. Your reward -- you lose again. [Laughs] Oh, damn, I'm good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Liam. Hope didn't wait?",
        "Liam: I mean, that was the plan, you know. I meet her here at 3:00. Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: It's dead. It's totally -- uh, okay, wait, wait, wait. Think, think. Apply logic. She's -- she's in pairs. She's upset. Where would she go? Uh... Forrester International?",
        "Ivy: Yes. Yes. Okay, let's go. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You okay? Look, you can't count on him, Hope. Liam just doesn't come through for you.",

        "Wyatt: Hey.",
        "Quinn: Hey! Um, where are you?",

        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: Excellent.",
        "Wyatt: Is there something in particular that you wanted?",
        "Quinn: I want you to have what you want. You are in such a great position. Make it count. Take control. Marry her.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Just like that, huh?",
        "Quinn: Exactly like that! How many chances do you think most couples get? Not as many as you've had with Hope. And if you let this one slip away, you may never get another chance. I would marry her immediately, if not sooner.",
        "Wyatt: Does she get a vote?",
        "Quinn: Just do it, Wyatt.",

        "Bill: From what you told me, Liam's still her choice.",
        "Brooke: But is she his? People have limits, and there comes a time in their life when they say \"no more.\"",
        "Bill: So, where does Wyatt end up in all this?",
        "Brooke: That's the unfortunate part. No matter what happens in Paris, someone's going to be the odd man out.",

        "Ivy: And then Liam, he jumped in, and he saved me.",
        "Rick: Are you all right?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, we -- we just need to find Hope.",
        "Liam: Have you -- have you heard from her at all?",

        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Well, we should be landing soon.",
        "Hope: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Nothing's changed, you know. Between you and me. Not since the day that I met you. Liam was disappointing you then, and he still is. And I hate seeing you like this. You should be celebrated and loved. Liam just treats you like there's another Hope around every corner, but you know what? With me, there's not. There's only you. Look, my brother is a good person, but he is an idiot when it comes to treating you the way that you deserve. Walk away, hope. Decide right here and now that you are not available for any more disrespect and disappointment.",
        "Hope: It's... it's not easy letting go.",
        "Wyatt: I can help. I did it before.",
        "Hope: It's just -- you know, I'm...I'm so tired. I'm so tired of -- of getting my hopes up and then just watching them crash down around me over and -- and over again. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: That shouldn't be your life. You know what we have together, and you know how good it is.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Re-up on the ride with me. Been a pretty good one so far. Especially the transportation factor. I mean, that's gotten a lot better -- from a truck to the trailer to private jet on the way to the private yacht. Come back to me.",

        "Brooke: O-okay. Well, then just explain that to her. I'm sure she'll understand.",
        "Liam: I'm trying. I can't find her. She's not answering her phone. I was hoping she would be in touch with you, maybe?",
        "Brooke: No. Sorry.",
        "Liam: All right, if -- if you hear from her...",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I'll tell her to call you right away. And, Liam, please don't worry about it. I'm sure she just needs some time to herself. She'll turn up.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] What?",
        "Rick: I realize that this isn't a place you probably want to go, but... Hope's most likely with Wyatt.",

        "Brooke: [Sighs] I'm trying to figure out if I should be. Although spending time alone after a major disappointment, that's not really abnormal.",
        "Bill: Hmm. Like mother, like daughter? I'm never giving up on us, Brooke. We're good at overcoming obstacles, and we're going to overcome this one. You know, uh, I'm a bit of a work-in-progress. Certain...situations challenge me, but this I will promise you, all right? I swear that I will never dump another person out of a chopper into a large body of water ever again.",
        "Brooke: I'm gonna hold you to that.",
        "Bill: Well, how about you just hold me instead?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Speaking of dumping bodies into the water, can you believe that Ivy fell into the Seine? Thank God Liam was there.",
        "Bill: Well, that's my boy. Rescuer of defenseless animals and damsels in distress.",
        "Brooke: Well, that's Liam for you. And of course he would pull Ivy out of the river and save her. I just pray that it didn't cost him Hope.",

        "Ivy: Why don't you leave a message?",
        "Liam: I-I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna make excuses over the phone. I-I have to talk to her in person.",
        "Ivy: If I hadn't have been pushed into that river... Liam, you had a choice. You had a choice. You could have kept going. You could have made it to Hope on time.",
        "Liam: That was not a choice. That wasn't even an option.",
        "Ivy: Exactly. And that says so much about the kind of man you are. Your goodness, your chivalry. I owe you. I'm gonna make things right with Hope. I'm gonna explain what happened, and then when she understands, she'll fall in love with you even more. I mean, you're both in Paris. You're in Paris, she's in Paris.
