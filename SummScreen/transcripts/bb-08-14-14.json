        "Liam contemplates what just happened. He laments to Ivy that he was there, late, but there yet Hope married Wyatt. He is not sure how that happened. He doesn't understand but he should have been smarter and known. This is all on him. Ivy says he has every reason to be upset at Hope and Wyatt but it isn't his fault. He says he should be Hope's husband, not Wyatt. He had the most phenomenal girl right there but lost her .maybe because of the diamond. A Mexican police lieutenant knocks on the warehouse door and speaks with Deacon. He says he is there to talk to Wyatt Fuller about the death of Ricardo. Deacon invites him in and asks a few questions of why a death would be investigated. The lieutenant says Ricardo was poisoned by arsenic that is associated with certain gemstones. Ricardo was a seasoned gemologist so it's highly doubtful he accidentally poisoned himself. They think someone else was involved. He admits that neither Wyatt nor Quinn is known to have been in Mexico at the time. But Wyatt did receive the diamond so Deacon can surely see why they need to cover all bases. He will be back to see Wyatt later. Deacon thoroughly searches the loft and finally uncovers the laptop and the video Ricardo made for Wyatt when he left him the diamond. Viola, Deacon thinks he has something that it would be on Quinn's computer.",
        "Oliver gives Aly some flowers and they are cooing to each other when Pam and Charlie break in to give her the bad news. Hope got married all right but not to Liam, it was Wyatt. Aly says it was always Hope and Liam but circumstances kept them apart. Charlie says maybe it was just meant to be as the diamond always wins. Aly says the diamond is a curse. Pam says like it or not looks like Hope moved on and Liam will have to too. Liam roams the streets and has flashbacks of he and Hope in happier times. Ivy finds him and says his chivalry saved her so do not find fault in that. She wants to thank him again. She kisses him. He's shocked and a little embarrassed."

        "Liam: She married him. She married him. H-how?",
        "Ivy: Your dad -- he said that they were on his yacht in Monte Carlo, so why don't you try and find a way to reach them and then get her to stop before it's too late?",
        "Liam: It's too late. It is too late. Why would I trust Wyatt? Why would I do that? Why wouldn't I see this coming?",
        "Ivy: Liam, I'm -- I'm so sorry. I-I can't even imagine how you must be feeling right now. I .",
        "Liam: I just -- I don't -- I don't get it. I don't understand. I mean, yeah, I was -- I was late meeting her, but I was there, you know. I was -- I was there. Our future was right there, and now she -- she's married to Wyatt. How -- how does that happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: [Western accent] Excuse me. I have a delivery for Miss Aly Forrester.",
        "Aly: That's me. Oh, gosh, how gorgeous. Thank you. [Laughs] Carnations, the flower you gave me at medieval night.",
        "Oliver: [Normal voice] My maiden needed her carnation.",
        "Aly: And now my knight bringeth me a whole bouquet. A very lucky maiden am I. Thank you, Oliver. I-I love them. And I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Bat cracks]",
        "Deacon: Go! Come on, baby! Go! Go! Yes! Ha ha! Nice!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Lt. Paragan: Wyatt Fuller?",
        "Deacon: No. Who are you?",
        "Lt. Paragan: I'm Lieutenant Paragan from the Mexico City police department.",
        "Deacon: Okay, look, man, I -- it wasn't me. I haven't even been in Mexico in years. I don't know what she said.",
        "Lt. Paragan: If you are not Wyatt Fuller, I am not here for you. I'm here to investigate the death of Ricardo Montemayor.",
        "Deacon: The guy that gave Wyatt the diamond?",
        "Lt. Paragan: Yes. I'm sure you've heard that Se\u00f1or Montemayor has passed away, and now Wyatt Fuller has his diamond. I need to find out if that was just a coincidence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Truck beeping]",
        "Deacon: Yeah, that's \"Sharpe\" with an \"E.\" Uh, I'm just staying here temporarily.",
        "Lt. Paragan: What is your relationship to Mr. Fuller?",
        "Deacon: Well, he's, uh -- actually, as of today, he's my son-in-law. Yeah, he and my daughter, they just tied the knot in Monte Carlo. Do you mind if I ask you why there's an investigation into Montemayor's death?",
        "Lt. Paragan: At first, we thought it was accidental. But now we believe there could have been foul play.",
        "Deacon: So, how did he die?",
        "Lt. Paragan: Poison.",
        "Deacon: He was poisoned?",
        "Lt. Paragan: The autopsy revealed high levels of arsenic. We think it could have come from a very unusual gemstone.",
        "Deacon: A gemstone, like for jewelry?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Carnations just became my new favorite flower.",
        "Charlie: Knock, knock.",
        "Oliver: Who's there?",

        "Aly: What's wrong?",
        "Pam: I'm afraid I've got some bad news, Aly. You're not gonna like this.",
        "Oliver: Is everyone okay?",
        "Pam: Hope got married.",
        "Aly: She did?",
        "Pam: But not to Liam. Hope married Wyatt.",
        "Aly: Very funny, Pam.",
        "Pam: I wish I was kidding.",
        "Oliver: Are you serious?",
        "Aly: Wait, wait, wait. H-how did that -- wait. How did that happen?",
        "Pam: Liam just didn't make it to the Eiffel Tower in time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: She's my brother's... wife. She's Wyatt's wife.",
        "Ivy: Liam, I don't think this is gonna stop hurting you for a while.",
        "Liam: I just -- I don't -- I don't... I don't understand, you know. That piece of -- I should have known, you know? I should have been smarter. This is -- this is my fault. I'm the one who screwed up.",
        "Ivy: No. No, you didn't. You didn't. The only reason you were late was because of me.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was late. I was late one time. [Chuckles] One -- one -- one time, and that's all it takes for her to run off and marry my brother. Really?!",
        "Ivy: Look, you have every right to be upset.",
        "Liam: I am upset, you know? I'm upset -- I'm upset with Wyatt, I'm upset with Hope, I'm upset with whoever pushed you off the stupid bridge... and I'm mad at myself. I'm mad at myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Flashback)",
        "Ivy: Go to Paris, Liam. Go and meet Hope in your special place and prove to Wyatt that -- that you're not gonna let him or a diamond ruin things for you and Hope.",
        "(Present time)",
        "Liam: I was gonna marry Hope. I was gonna wear this ring for the rest of my life, and -- and now that's just...not happening. Like, I lost my chance. That's it. [Scoffs] You know, I never would have predicted this. I was so excited to come over here and surprise her. I was so excited for our future together. Am I just -- am I just, like, really foolish?",
        "Ivy: No. Liam, you just -- you had faith in your relationship.",
        "Ivy: Well, that says more about his character.",
        "Liam: Yeah, 'cause -- 'cause it should be me with her right now. I-I should be Hope's husband, not Wyatt.",
        "Ivy: I-I don't even know what to say to you. I... this has surprised me, as well. It's all happened so fast.",
        "Liam: I know. Sorry. Do you think I was too hard on her? Do you think that's it? I mean, maybe -- she was just trying to be professional. Maybe I overreacted to the diamond, 'cause -- 'cause I had the most phenomenal girl right there, and...I lost her. I-I got to go. I'm not -- I'll --",
        "Ivy: Liam, I'm --",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lt. Paragan: Very few gems contain the poison arsenic. But some, such as realgar, contain upwards of 70%.",
        "Deacon: You're kidding me.",
        "Lt. Paragan: When handled carefully, wearing gloves, mask, eye protection, uh, there are usually no serious risks. Very rarely are there fatalities.",
        "Deacon: So then it's pretty strange that Montemayor had this stuff in his system.",
        "Lt. Paragan: It's quite suspicious. He was a highly educated gemologist.",
        "Deacon: Well, he had to be aware that there were dangers when you're handling these kind of stones, right?",
        "Lt. Paragan: Initially it was assumed that he accidentally poisoned himself. But it is unlikely he would have been so careless. We think someone else was involved.",
        "Deacon: So you think this guy was murdered? [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I don't trust Wyatt. He's manipulative, always working some angle. And now Hope's committed to him forever.",
        "Oliver: I can't believe they're actually married.",
        "Aly: Wyatt forced that diamond on Hope. Probably forced the marriage on her, too.",
        "Charlie: Let's hope that's not the case. But if it is, when he gets back, he's gonna have to deal with me.",
        "Pam: I was really rooting for Liam. And now, somehow, once again, Wyatt and Quinn are back on top.",
        "Aly: I feel so awful for Liam. I hope he's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Singer: Sitting solemnly at home beside a silent telephone a vacant heart a world come and gone so hold me in and I could see a cold romantic one-way street an empty bed of used-up promises and then you came to me with conscious hands and steady feet you took away my need to need my history and, boy, well, here goes nothing and this ain't a love song it couldn't be that I would fall for you so soon my rose that blooms in autumn go on break me, take me to the place I'd want to be and we can just pretend it wasn't all a dream all a dream",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: So, uh, Mr. Montemayor -- he died in Mexico, right?",
        "Lt. Paragan: Yes. I spoke with Wyatt on the phone awhile back. I'm here to follow up.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt's not a suspect, right?",
        "Lt. Paragan: We have no record that he or his mother traveled to Mexico at the time of death. But I would like to ask him a few questions. We have a dead man who left Mr. Fuller the priceless Hope for the Future diamond. You can understand why we need to cover all our bases.",
        "Deacon: Well, listen, Wyatt's out of the country. I don't know when he's coming back. And, uh, Quinn, his mom, she's not here, either.",
        "Lt. Paragan: I will return. Here is my card.",
        "Deacon: Great.",
        "Lt. Paragan: If you have any information, anything at all, please call me.",
        "Deacon: Adios.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Liam will be fine. He's a big boy.",
        "Aly: I know, but I can't help feeling bad. Liam loves Hope so much, and they are just -- they're perfect together.",
        "Pam: I know. You really believed in Hope and Liam, didn't you?",
        "Aly: I still do. And not just because I can't stand Wyatt. Liam is a real gentleman, the kind of man Hope deserves.",
        "Oliver: They've tried so many times to make it work.",
        "Pam: I know. How many canceled weddings did they have?",
        "Charlie: Or broken engagements.",
        "Pam: Right.",
        "Aly: But it was never their fault. Someone was always interfering. Bill, Steffy, Quinn -- one thing after another. But Hope and Liam -- they never truly gave up. They always found their way back to each other.",
        "Pam: I know. But maybe this is the way that it's just meant to be.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I think Pammy's right. You just can't fight the power of the Hope for the Future diamond. It will always win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Singer: At times it comes and goes again an empire founded on a whim and is it less important if we were young? In years, will I look back and miss the way that we made all of this? A sanctuary that I would never trade for anything and there you were again to show me just how I fit in this incandescent second skin you've wrapped around me time and time again and so it goes this ain't a love song it couldn't be that I would fall for you so soon my rose that blooms in autumn go on break me, take me to the place I'd want to be and we can just pretend it wasn't all a dream there's a lifetime inside of your eyes it's been a long while since I woke up alive and hell, I know there's times when troubles don't die but I can try and could we try? And this ain't a love song",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Oh, Quinn, you naughty, little minx. [Chuckles] That looks painful. Ricardo Montemayor.",
        "Ricardo: Wyatt, I can only imagine how surprised you are. I am, too. My heart was never fuller than when I was caretaker of the diamond. It was only out of my reach once when I loaned it to you. You have a shared passion and reverence for the... quintessence of this gem. I am at her mercy, as you will be, the mother of all diamonds. She's yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: That diamond is a curse. I just don't see the magic in it.",
        "Oliver: It's brought a lot of recognition to Forrester.",
        "Charlie: And Wyatt, too. And don't think he doesn't know it.",
        "Aly: Don't get me wrong. It's an exquisite diamond.",
        "Oliver: You just hate that it's drawn Hope and Wyatt together.",
        "Aly: More than anything.",
        "Pam: Whether we like it or not, it looks like Hope has moved on. So I guess Liam's got to move on, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: So, of all the bridges in Paris to choose from, you have to choose the most romantic one.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm a glutton for punishment, I guess.",
        "Ivy: You saved my life before, Liam.",
        "Liam: Oh, stop.",
        "Ivy: And your chivalry may have cost you your future. I'm -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Liam: Don't you dare apologize to me, Ivy. Not one bit of this was your fault.",
        "Ivy: I'm not gonna forget what you did for me. I wish there was a way to thank you, that's all.",
        "Liam: You don't -- you don't have to thank me.",
        "Ivy: Well, I -- thanks.",
