    "Recap": [
        "Liam confronts Steffy that Bill told everyone that the mother of Thomas's son was dying and that cannot be condoned. They banter back and forth and she ends up saying perhaps Bill's extreme measures are for the best. Thomas and Caroline are more compatible. He asks what is now going to happen to Sally. Steffy says she is not going to give her one bit of remorse. Caroline sits and tells Bill that she flew here because she cannot do this. This little charade comes to an end today. Bill tells Caroline do not kill this now. It will only be a matter of time before Caroline has a miraculous recovery but not before Thomas is deeply connected to her and Douglas and wants to be a family. Eric calls Sheila, who is more than happy to hear from him. He tells her that he is back with Quinn and he wants her to be happy too but he thinks it should be somewhere else, not in L.A. He informs Charlie and Pam that Sheila is going to be dropping by in a few minutes. Charlie says he could send someone to retrieve his watch so she would not have to be in the building. Eric says he is well aware of Sheila's past and all will be all right. Instead of Forrester, Sheila goes to the manse and knocks but goes on it. Quinn finds her looking at the portrait and asks what she is doing there. Caroline bursts out that Bill does not care about her and Thomas. He only wants to get his hands on the Spectra building for his precious new skyscraper. He does not think there is anything wrong with that. Quinn tells Sheila just to leave Eric's watch and get out. She never wants to see her again. Quinn calls Eric and Charlie wants to go with him to the house but Eric insists on going alone. Sheila tells Quinn that her portrait does not begin to be worthy of hanging on that wall. And furthermore she is not leaving.",
        "Liam asks Steffy one more time what is so wrong with Sally. Steffy retorts that she is a con artist so why don't they be patient and see if Bill's plans work. He relents and says okay if she feels that strongly about it then he will keep his mouth shut. Bill tells Caroline to get back to New York. Her life is there with Thomas and her son. She adds and his is with his new building and his empire. She leaves in disgust. Quinn tells Sheila she is not going to stand there and let her insult her in her own home, so get out! As she turns to leave, Sheila stops when Quinn calls her Bitch. Sheila wants to hear that again so Quinn calls her bitch again. Sheila pushes her backward and then slaps and chokes Quinn and a violent fight ensues with Quinn picking up a fireplace poker and they push and shove and fight over it. It looks like Quinn is being choked. As Sheila quietly walks away Quinn comes to and throws her pocketbook as a perfect spiral pass at Sheila hitting her in the head. She falls to the floor. Quinn tries to revive her but can't. Sheila is bleeding from the head when Eric suddenly walks through the door and sees the mayhem. He looks at Quinn with the look of shock and disgust pointed at her."

        "Liam: How are you even hesitating? You know this is the right thing to do.",
        "Steffy: I'm still trying to wrap my head around what Bill did.",
        "Liam: What my dad did is what my dad always does, which is whatever it takes to get his way. He told your brother that the mother of his child is dying when she's not. That is...beyond cruel. And we can't let him do that. You agree with that.",
        "Steffy: No.",
        "Bill: Were you or were you not the one who came to me and asked for my help?",
        "Caroline: I didn't think that you were gonna go this extreme.",
        "Bill: What you call extreme I call effective.",
        "Caroline: I don't want to be with Thomas this way. Not because of some horrible lie. I-I flew here from new York because I can't do this anymore. It should have been Thomas' decision, and it wasn't, so this whole charade is gonna end! Today.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Sheila: Hello?",
        "Eric: Sheila, it's Eric.",
        "Sheila: Eric. I was hoping I'd hear from you.",
        "Eric: Well, a lot's been going on. Quinn and I are back together.",
        "Sheila: Oh, I can't say I'm not disappointed, but if you really think she deserves a second chance... I just want your happiness.",
        "Eric: I want the same for you, too, Sheila. Though I think maybe it's best for you to stay away. We're trying to move past what's happened. I'm sure that you'd like to move on and begin the next part of your life. Maybe somewhere else, somewhere -- somewhere other than L.A. Sheila, there's another reason I was calling. My gold watch. I wondered if the hotel found it. It was a gift from Stephanie. I seem to have misplaced it.",
        "Sheila: Housekeeping found it. Um, I told them that I would get it to you. I'll -- I'll -- I'll drop it off.",
        "Bill: Listen to me, Caroline. Don't sabotage something that's gonna pay off very big very soon. Thomas already realizes that his life is with you and Douglas. Another few weeks, he'll be so invested, he will never want to go back to L.A., Especially when he hears the miraculous news that the mother of his child isn't going to die after all. She's going to live.",
        "Caroline: As I continue to lie to him, I am starting to feel less and less worthy of my son's father. And also what if somebody else finds out? Oh, my god! Please tell me that Sally hasn't figured it out.",
        "Bill: Oh, don't be ridiculous. That -- that ginger isn't smart enough to put on a pair of slippers. Your cousin Liam, on the other hand, he's a little too smart for his own good.",
        "Steffy: Liam, I agree with you. I wish Bill hadn't done that.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but he did, and now that we know he did, we can't just keep that from Thomas.",
        "Steffy: What if we tell Thomas and he just abandons Caroline and Douglas and goes right back to Sally Spectra?",
        "Liam: He won't abandon her. He wasn't abandoning her before. Yeah, he's not gonna be happy with Caroline once he finds out she went along with the lie, however begrudgingly, but they -- they got a kid together. They're gonna work it out.",
        "Steffy: Well, what if they don't? What if -- what if Thomas sues Caroline for primary custody? I mean, things could get really ugly, you know?",
        "Liam: Come on, come on. You're rationalizing. You're just -- you're trying to justify what you know isn't right.",
        "Steffy: No, what isn't right is Sally ruining my brother's life. And maybe Bill Spencer's extreme measures are -- are for the best.",
        "Caroline: How did Liam find out?",
        "Bill: How did Liam find out? That ginger shot off her big mouth. So he thought that his cousin -- listen, you know what? Don't worry about Liam. I'll keep him in line. You just keep doing what you're doing.",
        "Caroline: No, no, no. Don't. I am not going along with this, okay? I am just gonna tell Thomas that I had a great doctor's visit and it turns out I am not dying, and he'll be relieved.",
        "Bill: And he will be back in L.A. Before you can say Sally Spectra.",
        "Liam: How is lying to your brother for the best?",
        "Steffy: For one thing, Thomas won't be a part-time parent. He's not living thousands of miles away. He will actually be there for his son. He's able to play with him and tuck him in at night --",
        "Liam: All things that I never had from my biological father growing up, and look at me. I've only murdered like eight people.",
        "Steffy: Okay. I'm thinking about Caroline. Thomas and Caroline, they're compatible.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Steffy: This is where Thomas needs to be. Let's not interfere.",
        "Pam: It's one teaspoon of vanilla extract, two teaspoons of baking soda!",
        "Charlie: Well, that's not what the recipe says.",
        "Pam: No, don't worry about the recipe! I've been making blueberry zucchini bread since I was knee-high to a spatula. I know what I'm doing.",
        "Eric: Pam, Charlie, Sheila carter will be stopping by later.",
        "Pam: The Sheila carter?",
        "Charlie: Why -- why would she be coming here?",
        "Eric: She's dropping off a watch of mine. I just want to make sure that security lets her in, all right?",
        "Pam: Ah. Okay. Um, Joey, there's a woman that's gonna be arriving at the front door, and...",
        "Eric: Charlie. Something else?",
        "Charlie: Well, uh, are you sure you want Sheila here at Forrester? I mean, you know, I-I can send someone for the watch.",
        "Eric: Charlie, I'll be all right. Look, I'm well aware of Sheila's past and the trouble that she's caused. But she's been working really hard on herself lately. And frankly, she's been more forthcoming with me than a lot of other people have been. Besides, what possible harm could she do dropping off a watch?",
        "Sheila: Eric? Eric, I've got your watch!",
        "Quinn: What are you doing here?",
        "Liam: All right. What about Sally?",
        "Steffy: What about her?",
        "Liam: Well, I mean, you were just on the runway with her in Monaco. She's working really hard to make something out of nothing. I mean, this is really how you want to win? By making her into a victim?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Look, I love you. And you have an enormous heart, and you always see both sides, but when it comes to Sally Spectra, I just want Thomas to be the family man I know he can be. And you should want that for Caroline. She's your cousin. As for Sally, I'm not gonna give her one shred of remorse. So let's just wait and see if Bill's plan works.",
        "Caroline: Is this really about me, uncle Bill? Or is there more to why you're insisting I go along with this lie? [Chuckles] It's impressive. All the detail, opulent entrance. 380 Wyler street. Is that downtown?",
        "Bill: Oh, uh, yeah.",
        "Caroline: Why does that address sound familiar? That's Spectra fashions!",
        "Bill: So?",
        "Caroline: You want to build your skyscraper on the Spectra property?!",
        "Bill: Does it matter?",
        "Caroline: It only matters if you think Thomas being in new York is gonna make Spectra fail. I suspected you had ulterior motives. I cannot believe you! This is all about you getting your shiny, new building, Bill! You don't care about me and Thomas!",
        "Bill: You wanted Tommy boy back in your life and Douglas' life. I agreed. A man should be with his son. So I made it happen. You should be thanking me, Caroline. You will be thanking me.",
        "Eric: Sheila should be here by now.",
        "Charlie: Wait, wait. W-w-what if she went to your house instead? I mean, is -- is Quinn there?",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Charlie: Alone?",
        "Eric: I think so, yeah.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Eric: It's Quinn. Sheila's there.",
        "Charlie: Okay, let's go.",
        "Eric: Wait. I'll go, I'll go. Thank you.",
        "Charlie: N--",
        "Quinn: I just texted Eric, and I told him that you're here.",
        "Sheila: Good. I-I told him I had his watch and that I would drop it off for him.",
        "Quinn: Well, he's at Forrester. You should have dropped it off there with security.",
        "Sheila: I'm sorry. I just assumed that he wanted me --",
        "Quinn: Well, you assumed wrong. And you shouldn't even be in this house. Eric still has a restraining order against you.",
        "Sheila: [Scoffs] You gonna call lieutenant baker? Are you really that afraid of me?",
        "Quinn: No, no, no. See, I'm not afraid of you or your intimidation tactics. They may work on other people, but they don't work on me. So why don't you leave his watch and get out? I never want to see you again.",
        "Sheila: Yeah, well, you know, maybe you don't. But Eric might feel differently.",
        "Quinn: You listen to me, Sheila. Eric and I are back together, and we're happier than ever. Your pathetic attempt at trying to get back with my husband didn't work.",
        "Sheila: [Chuckles] My, my, my. Somebody's still very angry at me for telling her husband the truth about her and his son, something she should have done on her own! It really makes me question your character.",
        "Quinn: Really? Seriously? You have the audacity to question my character?",
        "Sheila: I not only question it. It's clearer than ever now that you're never gonna be good enough for Eric. Your portrait, it doesn't even deserve to be hanging on that wall.",
        "Quinn: And whose does, Sheila? Yours?",
        "Liam: I got to ask one more time. Is Sally really that bad?",
        "Steffy: Liam, you always root for the underdog. Sally is a con artist.",
        "Liam: You don't think maybe that's changed since Thomas has been there?",
        "Steffy: That's what makes me so angry. Sally used Thomas. Spectra would have been rubble if it weren't for Thomas. It was his talent and his money that kept Spectra afloat, and now that he's gone, his relationship with her is over, and Spectra will tank. And that is a good thing for him and his family. So let's just be patient and see if the plan works. A little boy's future depends on it.",
        "Liam: Okay. All right. I mean, if you feel -- if you feel that strongly about it, I'll keep my mouth shut. For now.",
        "Bill: I'll have my beautiful building. Douglas will have his father. And you'll have the man that you love.",
        "Caroline: And when Thomas realizes that you've built your building where Spectra sits?",
        "Bill: Thomas knows I've been after that property. He won't be suspicious. And besides, by then the two of you will be stuck back together like glue, and Sally will be out of the picture. Everything will be as it should be. Now get back to new York, Caroline. Your life is there. With your son and his father.",
        "Caroline: And your life is here, doing what you do best -- building monuments to yourself and your empire.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Quinn: You think your portrait should be up there, don't you?",
        "Sheila: Yours certainly shouldn't be after what you did with Eric's son.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs]",
        "Sheila: He deserves so much better than you.",
        "Quinn: You know what? I am not gonna stand here and listen to you insult me in my own home. Get out. Now. Leave his watch on the table. I'll make sure he gets it. You know what else, Sheila? You have done enough damage to Eric and his family. Don't ever come back to this house again. Bitch.",
        "Sheila: What did you call me?",
        "Quinn: I believe I called you a bitch, bitch. [Grunts] Wh-- aah! Oh!",
        "Sheila: Don't you ever, ever call me that!",
        "Quinn: Come on. Come on!",
        "[Vase shatters]",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Aah! Aah!",

        "Eric: Quinn, what happened? Oh, God. Sheila. Sheila. Sheila. Oh! Quinn. You killed her. Sheila. Sheila."
