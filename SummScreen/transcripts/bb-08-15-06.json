        "Late morning, Nick and Brooke are snuggling in bed. They both lament that two days away from each other was just too long. He informs her about Ridge's visit the night before and how he thinks Ridge is taking advantage of Donna and she's not resisting. Nick expounds that Ridge is doing this just to make Brooke jealous and it looks like it's working. Donna reports to work late, trying to act business as usual. She finally asks Ridge if it is true what Nick said; that he's using her to make her sister jealous? She doesn't want to play games. He tells her he didn't answer because he doesn't know the answer. He doesn't completely scare her off and she reminds him that even good girls like to occasionally play with fire. She's taking this ride and not getting off.",
        "Felicia and Dante are smooching up a storm in the Executive office when Bridget walks in. She lets them know she is happy they are back together and that there is at least one happy ending. Felicia comes clean with her previous Botox and suntan lotion switch and Bridget apologizes for her not knowing her own mind and interfering in their relationship. Felicia gives her a stethoscope for a graduation gift and tells her now that she can cure other people's hearts, it's time to work on her own. She knows it's all about Nick. Brooke walks in on Ridge with his hands all over Donna \u0096 working, of course. She coolly dismisses Donna so she and Ridge can go over sales figures. And ends up telling Ridge he has a disregard for her feelings, and she can't take it any more. He reminds her that she is with his half-brother, so she surmises this is payback. He simply says it's him moving on with his life, which is what she asked him to do. But, what he really wants is for her to tell Nick it is over and come back to him."

        "Nick: Can you tell how much I missed you?",
        "Brooke: Can you tell how much I missed you?",
        "Nick: You know, we've only been away from each other a couple days.",
        "Brooke: Yeah? Well, it's been too long. So, how were things around here while we were away? Did Donna pitch in with R.J.? She did help out, didn't she?",
        "Nick: Yeah, yeah, no, it's not that. It's just that Forrester was by last night.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yeah, he came to visit R.J.",
        "Nick: Well, R.J., Plus one. You know, Forrester's still pretty much all over your sister. Doesn't look like she's really resisting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Sorry I'm late.",
        "Ridge: We've got a lot of work to do today.",
        "Donna: I'll get changed.",
        "Ridge: You okay?",
        "Donna: Sure. I just didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Not that that's your fault. You know, actually, that's not true. Not entirely. What Nick said last night -- are you using me to make my sister jealous? Because if you are, just tell me. Because I don't play games.",
        "Ridge: You're wondering if I have feelings for you, and if I still have feelings for Brooke?",
        "Donna: You left without even answering. What am I supposed to think?",
        "Ridge: Maybe I didn't answer -- because I don't know the answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: It wasn't a dream, right? You and me making love all night, while our beautiful boy slept safe and sound down the hall?",
        "Dante: It wasn't a dream.",
        "Felicia: And that thing you said, about not being able to imagine your life without me, or him. It's real, too?",
        "Dante: I'm just sorry I put you through what I did before I realized.",
        "Felicia: It wasn't your fault.",
        "Bridget: It was my fault.",
        "Dante: Bridget --",
        "Bridget: I see you two are back together.",
        "Dante: Not exactly the way I wanted you to find out --",
        "Bridget: It's all right. It's -- it's fine, really. I'm happy. For both of you. Look, my life has been such a mess, and I've hurt people because I didn't know my own mind and my own heart -- and it's really nice to see at least one happy ending.",
        "Dante: Bridget, look, I will always care about you. You know that, right?",
        "Bridget: Yeah, I know. But your life is with Felicia and your son. Because it should be. My sister is going to be able to love you the way you deserve to be loved.",
        "Bridget: I didn't mean to run Dante off like that.",
        "Felicia: You didn't. They were expecting him downstairs like ten minutes ago.",
        "Bridget: Well, it's funny how times flies when you're in love.",
        "Felicia: Tell me about it.",
        "Bridget: Listen, I meant what I said, about being happy for you two.",
        "Felicia: And I believe you.",
        "Bridget: I do wish I had realized it sooner. If I had, I would have never --",
        "Felicia: Ruined my wedding?",
        "Bridget: Felicia, I'm really sorry. I hope that you'll be able to forgive me. Because if anyone deserves to be able to get back at me, it would be you. And you've risen about all that.",
        "Felicia: Well, um -- actually, not so much, Bridget. Do you remember the sunburn you got right around the time of Dante's big art award? I switched out your sunblock for baby oil.",
        "Bridget: What?",
        "Felicia: Yeah, and then -- the cream you got from the pharmacy to soothe the sunburn -- it was actually topical Botox.",
        "Bridget: My frozen face! Felicia, I was -- I was really scared to death!",
        "Felicia: You did deserve it.",
        "Bridget: You're right. I guess I did deserve it. And probably a whole lot more, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I don't believe this! I warned Donna what could happen if she mistook the excitement of working with Ridge, as something more. And now you're telling me --",
        "Nick: Wait, wait, wait a second here. Don't you think it's Forrester the one you ought to be upset with here? Or maybe that's the problem?",
        "Brooke: No, the problem is -- I'm just trying to keep my sister from getting her heart broken. She seems hell-bent into going that direction. I told her no more kissing, no more flirting, and she agreed to keep it strictly professional.",
        "Nick: Well, this is far from professional. The way I see it, Forrester's paying attention to your sister to get a reaction from you. And the way you're acting -- I'd say it's working.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: You're saying -- you're confused?",
        "Ridge: I'm saying, it's complicated.",
        "Donna: Because you're still in love with my sister.",
        "Ridge: And will be till the day I die. The truth is, I'm on the rebound right now, Donna. And that makes me dangerous. I'm not apologizing for that. I'm not making excuses. That's just the way it is.",
        "Donna: So, any woman is fair game, if she lets herself be.",
        "Ridge: I would never intentionally use you. But I'm not gonna lie to you. When we're working together, and I'm trying my damnedest to be professional -- it ain't easy. I'm a man that appreciates a beautiful, sexy woman. And you, my friend, are a beautiful, sexy woman. Is there desire there? Absolutely. Do I think about you when I design? Hell, yes. You're my muse, my inspiration. That is a turn-on in more ways than one. And what happens today, tomorrow, next week -- I don't have a clue. But that makes any involvement with me a big, big risk.",
        "Donna: Look, if you're trying to scare me off, it's not working. Okay, I'm scared. But even good girls like to play with fire sometimes.",
        "Ridge: And that's what you'd be doing --",
        "Donna: Look, I hear what you're saying, Ridge, okay? You're afraid I'll get too close -- get burned. But I am an adult. And I'm willing to take a risk. Especially if it means -- look, I've lived in my sister's shadow my entire life and I'm out. People are noticing me. You're noticing me. And it feels amazing. I'm gonna take this ride for everything it's worth. And either I'll have the time of my life or -- I'll get hurt. But either way, I am not getting off.",
        "[Intercom buzzes]",
        "Donna: You get that. I'll slip into something more comfortable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Brooke, now, I don't want Forrester messing with your head like this. Which is exactly what he is doing with this whole Donna situation. He knows how vulnerable you are because she's taken over as Forrester's spokes-model and that that was tough for you. He's taking advantage of that. He's using it to chip away at our marriage which ultimately proves my point.",
        "Brooke: What point?",
        "Nick: I just think that you need to step back. And don't get caught up in his games.",
        "Brooke: I've already given up working at Forrester, now I'm running things out of Marone.",
        "Nick: Which -- which leads me to an idea that I had. I was thinking, what if you got involved with my company.",
        "Brooke: You want me to give up fashion for freighters?",
        "Nick: I think that you're a creative woman. I think you're a hell of a businesswoman and I think Marone Industries would be lucky to have you.",
        "Brooke: Nick --",
        "Nick: There's a board meeting today. And I would mean a lot to me if you were there. Just give it a chance. Who knows, you just might find the same satisfaction at Marone that you did at Forrester.",
        "Brooke: In shipping and oil?",
        "Nick: Well, I like shipping and oil and you like me. It's a new focus for you, huh? Marone could use some new ideas. For me?",
        "Brooke: All right, I have to run by Forrester first and pick up some sales figures --",
        "Nick: I want you at that board meeting.",
        "Brooke: I know, I just don't know what I have to offer.",
        "Nick: Oh, please, you'll probably be running the joint in no time. And if you don't like it, I will kick everyone out of the conference room and we will have sex on the boardroom table. See ya.",
        "[Brooke giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: For what it's worth, I did feel really bad about the Botox thing. But hey, I had to do something.",
        "Bridget: Oh, I'm just lucky you didn't hire a hit man.",
        "Felicia: Don't think it didn't cross my mind.",
        "Bridget: Oh, I'm so sorry for everything. I know it doesn't excuse any of the pain that I caused you. But I am sorry.",
        "Felicia: You didn't do it on purpose, Bridget, I know that.",
        "Bridget: Well, still, it doesn't excuse it. Or explain why I did it. But, I do feel like I'm getting my life back together and I'm coming through to the other side.",
        "Felicia: I know, I heard about your graduation. I even got you a gift.",
        "Bridget: Felicia, you should not have done that.",
        "Felicia: Don't get too excited, it's not keys to a Ferrari or anything. Just a little something I thought might come in handy.",
        "Bridget: Very sweet. Wow!",
        "Felicia: A stethoscope. Not the most original gift I've ever thought of --",
        "Bridget: I love it. I love it. And I love you.",
        "Felicia: I love you, too. So, now that you're qualified to fix other people's hearts -- how about your own? Everything that you did, Bridget -- it's really all been about Nick, hasn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So, what do you think?",
        "Donna: I think it's inspired. But then, everything you do is inspired. Our show was in half an hour.",
        "Bridget: Well, you just cut right through, don't you?",
        "Felicia: Life's too short not to. I should know. The point is -- do you?",
        "Bridget: Oh, Felicia, if I'm being really honest with myself -- yeah, I've probably been in love with Nick since the first time I kissed him up at Big Bear.",
        "Felicia: And nothing's really happened to change that, not even your divorce. So why'd you let him go? He still had Brooke in him, I get it.",
        "Bridget: I don't know that I've admitted this to anyone -- well, I know I haven't. I can't even admit it to myself. But I thought that if I gave Nick up and he experienced my mother for himself, then the reality of her life and that rollercoaster that she lives on -- that he would eventually come back to me. I guess if he was gonna do that, it would've already happened by now.",
        "Felicia: You can't know that, honey --",
        "Bridget: I just wonder if I led my mom down the wrong road by urging Nick to stop her wedding to Ridge. You know, my mom is so hard to figure out. There's no way to know who she really wants to be with. But, if it is Ridge, she should be with him. She should definitely try to go be with him right now before anything or anyone else gets in her way again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Brooke: What's going on here?",
        "Ridge: Brooke, welcome back.",
        "Donna: How was camp? Did you and Hope --",
        "Brooke: It was fine.",
        "Ridge: So, what do you think?",
        "Donna: Ridge's latest inspiration.",
        "Ridge: I was just making a few adjustments.",
        "Brooke: We need to go over the sales figures -- alone.",
        "Donna: I'll just get my things.",
        "Ridge: Don't go too far, we have a lot of work to do today.",
        "Brooke: I thought I made it clear that your relationship can only be about work.",
        "Ridge: We were working.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, I have eyes. I could see what was going on.",
        "Ridge: Okay, why don't we just talk about this after the meeting.",
        "Brooke: I won't be here.",
        "Ridge: Why not?",
        "Brooke: I promised my husband I'd be at the board meeting at Marone. He thinks I can make a contribution. Besides, I need to step away from here.",
        "Ridge: Step away? Great. Just peachy. Not only won't Popeye let you work with me, he's trying to pull you into a business you have no interest in.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, this isn't about my husband. This is about you and my sister and whatever the hell's going on with you two and your total disregard for my feelings! I can't stand it, Ridge! I can't take it anymore!",
        "Ridge: Brooke --",
        "Brooke: You had her hands all over her. Now, I don't know if you're doing that to get back at me if she is or what! But you can't imagine how much it hurts!",
        "Ridge: I can't imagine that, huh? I can't imagine? How about you and my half brother?",
        "Brooke: Oh, okay. So this is payback?",
        "Ridge: No, Brooke, it's not payback. This is me just wanting to move on with my life, which is what you asked me to do, remember?",
        "Brooke: Well, I didn't know it was going to be with my sister.",
        "Ridge: I'm not saying it is.",
        "Brooke: You're not saying it isn't either!",
        "Ridge: That's because I don't know what I'm feeling here anymore than you do.",
        "Brooke: I'm married, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, you're feeling me pulling away from you toward another woman and it's eating you up inside. Especially when that other woman might possibly be your sister.",
        "Brooke: So, you do want to be with Donna?",
        "Ridge: What I want is to hold you in my arms and never let you go. What I want is to tell you over and over again how much I love you and will always love you. What I want is for you to come to your senses and finally realize that neither one of us are gonna be happy until we're together again. You know it's true, Brooke. You know it's true in your heart and in your soul. You know it's true. And there's only one way to make that happen. And that's to tell Nick that it's over between the two of you and come back to me. Come on, Brooke, do it for us. Do it for our son. Do it for everything we've ever meant to each other. Just tell him that it's over between the two of you. Go ahead. It's easy. Just do it."
