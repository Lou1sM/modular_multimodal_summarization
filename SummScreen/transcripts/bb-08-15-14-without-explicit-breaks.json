        "Thanks to Rick's generosity, Liam flies home with Ivy on the Forrester jet. He pulls a little pity party about not getting to Hope in time but it really wasn't up to her to call him as she made the date and when he didn't show, she thought it was over. And his own dad never thought Hope was good enough to be Mrs. Liam Spencer. There was always someone like Bill or Steffy in the way. He says Hope is now married to his brother and he has to move forward. He can't keep chasing her to Hawaii, down the Emerald Coast and now Paris. Someday he will meet somebody. Ivy takes his hand and says it might not seem like it now but he is a good guy and the good guys always win out in the end. Quinn comes home to find Deacon on the laptop listening to the Ricardo video again. They cat and mouse with questions and she plays innocent that she knows anything other than Wyatt married Hope, something she always knew would happen. She missed the ceremony but she bets it was beautiful. She vows to make the best mother-in- law ever, very supportive. Deacon tells her of his little visit from the Mexican police and they are investigating that it might have been murder. And he thinks they will eventually want to talk to Quinn. She calls Deacon a con man and he says he has changed. She says so has she and he can not pin anything on her. Ricardo gave the diamond to Wyatt, simple as that. Deacon says she is pretty but she is also a lunatic and he just wonders what a person would do and how far they would go to get exactly what they want. He calls her a murderer. She laughs it off and calls him crazy.",
        "Bill comes to see Brooke and asks if she has heard from Hope. She says no and asks if he has heard from Wyatt. He says no but he's on his honeymoon. He's planning him a party when he returns. Then he thinks he and Brooke should go get married. Their kids taught them a lesson. You can not sit around and take things for granted. He tells her that he will never let Quinn become between them again. Deacon shows Quinn the Ricardo video and focuses on certain words \u0096 Quintessence, mother of all diamonds, she's yours, Fuller, captive, I'm at her mercy. Quinn accuses Deacon of fiddling with the video and making it say what he wanted. She asks what he is going to do, finger her as the murderer in this senseless case. He says if he has to he will make sure the police, Bill, even Wyatt, everybody will know what she has done. He will see to it that she goes away for a long, long time. With his back turned, Quinn goes to the box and pulls out a gun and points it at Deacon. She says he is a little too \"sharp\" for his own good."

        "Ivy: Well, it was nice of Rick to let us use the jet.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, I just really didn't want to stick around paris any longer. You could have.",
        "Ivy: I didn't feel right sending you off home by yourself.",
        "Liam: What did I tell you about feeling guilty?",
        "Ivy: \"Don't.\"",
        "Liam: Ivy, hope and Wyatt didn't get married because you fell into the seine.",
        "Ivy: Hope was waiting for you at the Eiffel tower. If you hadn't jumped in to save me, you would have gotten to her on time.",
        "Hope: [Sighs deeply]",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: You heard from hope?",
        "Brooke: No. Did you get through to Wyatt?",
        "Bill: The guy's on his honeymoon.",
        "Brooke: But you've been in touch with the yacht.",
        "Bill: Hope is fine, Brooke. Our kids are married now. And we should do the same. Marry me. Let's get on with our lives.",
        "Ricardo: Wyatt...",
        "[Video rewinds]",
        "Ricardo: My heart was never fuller than when I was caretaker of the diamond.",
        "[Video rewinds]",
        "Ricardo: You have a shared passion and reverence for the... quintessence of this gem.",
        "Brooke: Our children run off and get married, and you think we should follow their lead?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, right after the party.",
        "Brooke: What party?",
        "Bill: The party that I'm gonna throw for hope and Wyatt. And the moment it's over, you and I are gonna fly to Stella Maris and have a wedding of our own.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] You're not concerned at all that they might have done something reckless?",
        "Bill: What, in this family? Liam had his chance, Brooke. He hesitated. Wyatt didn't. And don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't feel sorry for Liam -- I do. The kid's kicking himself.",
        "Brooke: You told him about the wedding?",
        "Bill: You say I act without thinking. Well, not acting can have consequences, too.",
        "Liam: I could second-guess this all the way across the Atlantic. What if I said yes right away when she asked me to paris? What if -- what if I gave myself more time to get there?",
        "Ivy: What if she waited a little bit longer?",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, that -- you know, hope...didn't know I was gonna be in paris, so...",
        "Ivy: Well, why didn't she call somebody and find out where you were?",
        "Liam: Well, because, as far as she knew, uh, you know, if I wanted to be with her, then I would meet her at the Eiffel tower, and if I didn't, then she knew what that meant, so...",
        "Ivy: Liam, you were on your way to her. You were practically there.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, now she's married to my brother, so... that happened. Nothing's changing that now.",
        "[Door unlocks]",
        "Deacon: Let me guess --",
        "Quinn: Whoa!",
        "Deacon: You snuck out when the orderly dropped his butterfly net.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I got the help I needed. What are you doing? Sitting around here like a lump?",
        "Deacon: I was just waiting for you.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Heard any good news lately?",
        "Deacon: You know.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. That my son and your daughter are married?",
        "Deacon: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: Finally.",
        "Deacon: Uh-huh. And, uh, you're just getting home, so that means, what -- you were out celebrating until now?",
        "Quinn: Well, daddy, I didn't know that I had a curfew. When did you hear?",
        "Deacon: Yesterday. What about you?",
        "Quinn: Oh, please, I've always known that Wyatt and hope would end up together.",
        "Deacon: So, what'd you hear about the ceremony? Anything?",
        "Quinn: I don't know. It was beautiful, I'm sure -- the happiest day of their lives.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, yours, too, right? I mean, this is exactly what you wanted.",
        "Bill: I'm not gonna make the same mistake Liam did. It's not my nature. Hanging back, letting things happen -- that's not how you get what you want.",
        "Brooke: Forcing the issue doesn't always help, either.",
        "Bill: All he had to do was be there.",
        "Brooke: You and Liam may feel badly about doing things the way that you did, but like you said, there are always consequences.",
        "Bill: We will get past this. What happened with Forrester was regrettable, but he's home now. He's back with Katie.",
        "Brooke: But he's not the same. And I can't quite put my finger on it. I guess that's pretty normal with a head injury -- memory loss, PTSD, lingering effects that we're not even aware of yet.",
        "Bill: I don't see it. And the way Forrester's acting, I don't think he's changed a bit.",
        "Brooke: And when I hear you talk like this, I'm not sure that you've changed, either.",
        "Ivy: How do you think your dad's gonna react to this?",
        "Liam: My dad? [Chuckles] My dad never thought hope was right for me -- at least not right enough to be Mrs. Spencer. It seemed like there was always somebody trying to break us up -- my dad or her dad, Steffy. Sometimes it worked.",
        "Hope: Liam!",
        "Liam: There was always that connection, you know? It's like the way I felt at the end of the runway the day I proposed.",
        "Ivy: Oh, that's a nice memory.",
        "Liam: Someday it will be.",
        "Quinn: It's kind of hard to wrap your mind around, isn't it?",
        "Deacon: What, that we're family?",
        "Quinn: Well, it wasn't that long ago that you were trying to pick me up in a bar.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] Dodged a bullet there, didn't I? Or more accurately, a blade. Yeah, I know what you did to Liam, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: And I know you're the one who told Wyatt.",
        "Deacon: Honey, you're lucky I did, because I saved you from doing something crazy.",
        "Quinn: Mm. It was a bad decision. It wasn't the way to handle things.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, you were desperate to get hope away from Liam, with \"desperate\" being the operative word.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Now she's married to my son.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, that's interesting how that worked out. Aren't you kind of curious how that happened?",
        "Quinn: Nope. It was meant to be.",
        "Deacon: It's too bad you didn't get to see it, though.",
        "Quinn: Oh, please. It was their day. My presence there would have just been a distraction. And I know that hope isn't going to embrace me right away. I got a lot of work to do there.",
        "Deacon: Leave her alone.",
        "Quinn: Excuse me?",
        "Deacon: What do you think -- that -- that I believe this actually just all happened -- that is was fate that your little plan just seemed to work out, and you had nothing to do with it?",
        "Quinn: Wow. It must be horrible walking through the world like you do -- thinking everybody's out to get you, everybody's got ulterior motives. I guess that's what happens when you're a con man.",
        "Deacon: I'm not like that anymore.",
        "Quinn: Hmm?",
        "Deacon: I'm not like that anymore.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Oh, well, neither am I. No, I'm turning over a whole new leaf. I am going to be a great mother-in-law -- supportive, encouraging. It's okay if they don't take me back at Forrester because Wyatt is there. His future is set. He's got a great job, a happy marriage. He has the diamond.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, about the diamond...I got a little visit yesterday. Yeah, a lieutenant from the Mexico city police department. He's investigating the death of Ricardo Montemayor.",
        "Ivy: It's gonna take you awhile to process this.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Yeah. Think I should keep it to myself until we get home?",
        "Ivy: No, Liam, I -- no. I didn't mean it like that. I just -- it's just if talking about this is too hard, then I-I understand, that's all.",
        "Liam: Wow.",
        "Hope: Hard to believe.",
        "Liam: You know, sometimes --",
        "Hope: I know.",
        "Liam: You do, do you?",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. Sometimes, you thought that we would never get to this place.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: But we're here... together. And soon, we'll be husband and wife. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: We came so close so many times. Maybe you only get so many chances.",
        "Bill: Our kids are trying to teach us a lesson, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: This really makes sense to you?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: I have nothing against Wyatt. I think he and hope are wonderful together. And it's obvious that he really does love her.",
        "Bill: But you would have bet on Liam.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Hope did not want Quinn as a mother-in-law.",
        "Bill: Well, she married Wyatt anyway.",
        "Brooke: That's a lot to take on.",
        "Bill: Well, she obviously feels that he's worth it. You know, Wyatt is a little bit like his old man -- not perfect, makes a mistake now and then, has a little bit of baggage, but when he tells her... ...that it's not going to be an issue, she can believe him.",
        "Brooke: Quinn will always be an issue. I'm glad that she's getting the help that she needs, but I'm not gonna lie -- I hope that therapy keeps her out of los Angeles for a very long time.",
        "Quinn: The police came here?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. A guy named Paragan. He's probably still in town. Here's his card. So, he said he wanted to talk to Wyatt, but, you know, somehow I just get the sneaking suspicion that he's eventually gonna want to talk to you.",
        "Quinn: Why?",
        "Deacon: Well, let's see. Montemayor was poisoned. Yeah, some kind of arsenic- rich gem.",
        "Quinn: Mm, yeah, some gems can be very dangerous. You have to be careful how you handle them.",
        "Deacon: This wasn't an accident. Quinn, they think he was murdered.",
        "Quinn: Well, Ricardo was a really wealthy man. He had a lot of valuable possessions. If --",
        "Deacon: They asked about the diamond.",
        "Quinn: Oh, well, see, there you go. That wasn't missing. He gave that to Wyatt in his will.",
        "Deacon: Oh, and doesn't that sound a little bit -- I don't know -- suspicious to you? Montemayor croaks, and all of a sudden, you-know-who winds up with a rock?",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Wyatt is innocent. He wouldn't hurt a fly.",
        "Deacon: No, he probably wouldn't, would he? No, you have to be -- you have to be really crazy to do that, right? You know, I mean, like a real nut job -- like obsessed. I mean, how badly would you have to want something that you'd be willing to kill for it?",
        "Quinn: You know, deacon, I'd be a little careful because what you're saying sounds an awful lot like an accusation.",
        "Deacon: Is that what you do when people get in your way -- when you don't get what you want? I mean, that's what you tried to do to Liam, and I'm not gonna let you do it to hope.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] What are you talking about?",
        "Deacon: When you threatened Liam, you threatened hope!",
        "Quinn: You are out of your mind.",
        "Deacon: You are.",
        "Quinn: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Deacon: You know, Quinn? You're very beautiful, but you're also a lunatic, and you're a murderer.",
        "Quinn: Are you listening to yourself? Murder? That is ridiculous. Why would you think I murdered Ricardo?",
        "Deacon: Because he told me.",
        "Liam: It's funny. The last time hope and I got back together, she said it was because she couldn't imagine a life without me.",
        "Ivy: What, you don't think she meant it?",
        "Liam: No, I do. I-I do. I do. I just... [Sighs] Maybe the reason she couldn't imagine life without me is because I never let her. You know, I followed her to Hawaii. I followed her down the coast, to paris. Wherever hope was...there Liam was. I can't -- I can't do that. I can't do that anymore. I can't live my life that way, you know? Sharing her and chasing her and constantly trying to create this -- this ideal future or -- or even rebuild the past. I have to be done. I have to be done. I have to let this go. She is married to my brother, and I have to accept that, and I have to move forward.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but saying it and actually doing it...",
        "Liam: I know. [Chuckles] I know.",
        "Ivy: You will, though.",
        "Liam: Someday, I'm gonna meet somebody. I'm gonna meet somebody eventually.",
        "Ivy: There's -- there's no rush.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah. 'Cause that's not me -- rushing.",
        "Ivy: Well, unless you're saving somebody's life.",
        "Liam: Well, I never said I-I couldn't rush when I had to. I just...don't have to right now.",
        "Ivy: Liam... look, I-I know that it may not seem like it right now...but the good guys -- they all -- and you are one -- they always win out in the end.",
        "Bill: Quinn needs more than therapy. She should be locked up for a very long time for what she did to Liam -- not in some cushy treatment center.",
        "Brooke: You still think she's dangerous?",
        "Bill: Absolutely. But not to us. I'm never going to let Quinn or anyone else come between us ever again.",
        "Quinn: Ricardo told you I killed him?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, he did.",
        "Quinn: So, were you holding s\u00e9ances while I was away? Now you -- you talk to the dead?",
        "Deacon: Just -- back in a second.",
        "Quinn: Hey, hey, hey. Don't touch that. That's mine.",
        "Deacon: Thank you for establishing that.",
        "Ricardo: Wyatt, I can only imagine how surprised you are. I am, too. My heart was never fuller than when I was caretaker of the diamond. It was only out of my reach once -- when I loaned it to you. You have a shared passion and reverence for the... quintessence of this gem. I am at her mercy, as you will be -- the mother of all diamonds. She's yours.",
        "Quinn: That's Ricardo's message to Wyatt. He's talking about the diamond, why he wants Wyatt to have the diamond. He doesn't say that I murdered him. He doesn't mention me at all.",
        "Deacon: Oh, no?",
        "Quinn: Unh-unh.",
        "Ricardo: She's your mother, Quinn fuller. I am at her mercy.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] What is that?",
        "Deacon: Oh, you didn't think your buddy Ricardo was gonna let you get away with it, did you?",
        "Quinn: Dude, you made that video.",
        "Deacon: Hey, listen. The message was there, okay? I just uncovered it.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] You could have cut it to make him say whatever you wanted.",
        "Deacon: You know, I think maybe I'm gonna let the police decide that.",
        "Quinn: You sent that to the police?",
        "Deacon: No. Not yet. But I did send it to myself, and with a click of my finger, I can forward it to anyone I want to.",
        "Quinn: Unless I do what? Stay away from your daughter? Or you're gonna do what? You're gonna -- you're gonna ruin my reputation? You're gonna make me a suspect in this pointless investigation?",
        "Deacon: You're not really getting what's going on here, okay?! This is not a negotiation! I'm not bargaining with you! If you had anything to do with that man's murder, you're going to jail. I'll make sure the cops see that video. I'll make sure your son sees that video. And Brooke and hope and Bill -- they're all gonna know what a crazy psychopath you are! And that little stunt that you pulled with Liam and the sword -- I mean, that was enough reason to get you out of hope's life forever! But listen to me -- if you did this, you're gonna go away for a very long time.",
        "Quinn: Oh, deacon. You're a little too sharp for your own good."
