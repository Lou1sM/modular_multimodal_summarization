{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7651 ~ Sally makes a fighting plea to CJ to allow her one more collection to prove that Spectra will be a success; Eric and Quinn greatly differ about what to do regarding Sheila's condition, which was brought on by Quinn."], "Recap": ["Quinn tries to reason with Eric that Sheila isn't as bad as he thinks and cannot stay with them. If she is, then she needs to be in a hospital. She is not taking the blame for all of this. Sheila herself says she does not need to go to the hospital. But Eric says he remembers all she has done in the past but he just wants to pay her back for her kindness since she has been back in L.A. so she stays here until she recovers. Liam drops in on Bill while he is with Brooke. Bill gloats that Spectra is going down while his Sky is going up. CJ stops in at Spectra and says he gave Sally a decent shot to make this work, but it didn't and now he has no choice but to close her down. He asks why has Thomas left her in this critical time. She says he will return but he needs a place to come home to. This is not how his mother raised him. This is not the time to jump off the Spectra train. Do not take that offer from Bill. He knows what he has to do. Eric says he is going to check in on Quinn but he wants to show Sheila how to use the intercom and says she can find anything she wants in the kitchen. She was helpful to him and he can do the same for her. She says he has helped her believe in herself. Sally explains to Grams and Saul what might be happening. Grams wonders if having Thomas here would help .call him and get him back to this dust post. Sally says Thomas will come back when he can but until then they are on their own.", "Liam has to admit that he told Steffy and she told him to forget all of this. CJ comes back and Bill asks if things went badly with Sally. CJ says she did not sign; he is giving her one more chance to keep Spectra afloat. She has another showing on board. Eric tells Quinn that he will keep his eyes on Sheila and if she does anything wrong then she is gone. He will never completely trust her but he can give her a place to stay for something that Quinn caused. She says there has to be another solution. He promises it will only be a short time and then he will send Sheila on her way. He can handle her. To herself Quinn says she will handle Sheila first. Liam cannot believe his ears that CJ is turning down Bill's first very generous offer plus an extra $5 million tax free dollars. CJ thinks Spectra deserves another chance so Bill throws him out. He tells Liam that without Thomas one more shot and they still will fail miserably. So now to Plan B. Caroline cannot be cured until that building is his. The group rejoice as Sally tells them that CJ is giving them one more chance. Quinn goes to Sheila's room and says she will not get away with this. Just how long is this recuperation going to last; Eric is never going to take her back. Nobody is buying that she has changed or prison has made her better. She will see to it that she will recover and be out of their lives. Sheila says she will be watching her too, the cheating wife. She knows Quinn as she was her at one time and she knows she will do something to prove she is not worthy. Sheila tells her not to ever underestimate her."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Eric: She has a concussion.", "Quinn: Yeah!", "Eric: Because of you.", "Quinn: No, I'm not taking all the blame for this.", "Sheila: I -- you know, I don't want to cause any trouble. I just -- I just want to go back to my hotel room.", "Eric: The doctor says she can't be left alone.", "Quinn: Yeah, but she won't be alone! Send her to a hospital! If you're really that bad off, isn't that where you should be?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Hey, so -- oh!", "Bill: [Groans]", "Brooke: [Giggles]", "Liam: Um, yeah. I -- I was just gonna head out. I was gonna say good night. Uh, don't forget about the conference call with the new York office first thing tomorrow.", "Bill: No, no, no. I'm gonna let you take over that little chat with Karen.", "Liam: Okay.", "Brooke: Tell her hello, and that I miss having Caroline around here.", "Liam: I will.", "Bill: Yeah, you know, it's, uh, not likely Caroline will be back anytime soon. Not with, uh, Thomas in new York.", "Brooke: Are they getting back together?", "Bill: You know my niece. If she, uh, sets her mind to something, she usually gets it.", "Brooke: Takes after her uncle.", "Bill: [Chuckles]", "Brooke: There's a prime example right there.", "Liam: Why? Is there news?", "Bill: Spectra's going down, and sky's going up.", "Liam: How? Spectra did great in Monaco. There's no reason to think they're closing up shop, is there?", "Bill: Well, they will if CJ Garrison says so. He owns the building.", "Liam: You've made CJ offers before.", "Bill: Mm, yeah. But in the words of the great Vito Corleone -- \"I made him an offer he couldn't refuse.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: So we're alone now. Tell me what's really going on. We're making enough to pay the rent. You don't have to sell the building -- not anymore.", "CJ: Look, Sally, this was a pipe dream to begin with, okay? And it just feels easier, to me, to let this whole thing go.", "Sally: Why, because Thomas is gone?", "CJ: No. Look -- the reasons are numerous, okay? And I don't have time to go into them. This isn't easy for me. Yes, Bill made me another offer, and I'm going to sell.", "Sally: I'm not letting you, CJ. Come on. For your mother. For Spectra. You can't do this.", "CJ: Sally, I wanted to give you a decent shot to make this thing work.", "Sally: It is! You saw the success we had in Monaco.", "CJ: Yes. Thomas had some killer swimwear designs, but, um, I don't see him, do you?", "Sally: I can do the next line myself. Spectra has momentum, Thomas or no Thomas. Please, just me one more chance.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: An additional $5 million?", "Bill: In an offshore account, tax-free. Should have seen CJ's ears perk up. The guys should never play poker.", "Brooke: [Giggles] Wow. You and that building. The lengths you'll go to get it built.", "Liam: Oh, you have no idea.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sheila: Look, I don't -- I don't need to go to a hospital, but when someone has suffered a concussion, it's best to make --", "Quinn: To hire a nurse, right? Round-the-clock care. That's exactly what we'll do. Far, far away from here.", "Sheila: Eric, I don't -- I don't want you to go through the expense. If it's -- if it's a problem, me being here, than I just -- I want to leave, okay? I want to leave.", "Eric: It's not.", "Quinn: Eric! Have you forgotten what this woman has done to you and your family?", "Eric: Of course not! The things I went through with her, you have no idea. I will always remember.", "Quinn: Then why?", "Eric: Because it's the right thing to do. Look, when I needed someone, Sheila was there recently. She was there, and now I just want to -- I just want to pay her back.", "Quinn: What? Eric!", "Eric: She stays here until she recovers.", "Sheila: Thank you. Thank you very much.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: No building is worth the lie you're telling. You know that.", "Bill: A little white lie so we can all get what we want -- me, Caroline. Everyone benefits.", "Liam: Not Sally.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "CJ: If Thomas is still on board, then why did he leave at such a critical time?", "Sally: He has obligations.", "CJ: Yes. He's a father. I get that. But you can still be a dad and put pencil to paper.", "Sally: Eventually. When he's ready, he will come back, but we need to make sure we at least have a place for him to come back to. I can do this, CJ. I can build off what we started in Monaco.", "CJ: Yes, but this place is my future, too. You keep forgetting that. Why risk it? Why? When there's a chance to...", "Sally: To what? Sell out? That is not how aunt Sally raised you. Please, CJ. Come on, Spectra is on the verge of something really big.", "CJ: Sally, you have been saying that for months.", "Sally: The only bad review we had was manipulated by Bill. We have had one success after another ever since. This is not the time to jump off of the Spectra train. No! This is the time to sit back and just let it ride out! Don't take that offer from Bill. Not when your very talented, very motivated cousin is offering you something way better. Monthly rent checks for the rest of your life. It is a no-brainer, CJ. You know what you have to do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Agh! [Grunts] [Grunting] [Grunts]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Thud, glass shatters]", "Sheila: Thank you.", "Eric: You okay?", "Sheila: Mm-hmm.", "Eric: All right. There's fresh towels in here, in the bathroom.", "Sheila: Great.", "Eric: And, uh, help yourself to anything in the kitchen that you want.", "Sheila: Thank you. Thank you.", "Eric: I should show you how to use the intercom here.", "Sheila: Eric. I remember how to use the intercom.", "Eric: Yes. Of course you do. I'm gonna check in on Quinn, see how she's doing. Call if you need anything.", "Sheila: Eric, wait. I really appreciate what you're doing.", "Eric: It's no problem.", "Sheila: No, it is a problem, for Quinn. She -- she hates me. She think I'm faking this concussion. She practically demanded that you kick me out.", "Eric: I think she's a little threatened by you, Sheila. But you're not a threat, are you? Certainly not to our marriage.", "Sheila: I can't imagine anyone taking me in after all that I've done.", "Eric: You were helpful to me. I -- I can do the same for you.", "Sheila: It's not that you brought me into your home, Eric. It's that you believed me. It's helping me believe in myself.", "Eric: Good night, Sheila.", "Sheila: Good night.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Shirley: CJ barely looked at me as he walked out. Is that a bad sign?", "Sally: I think he just has a lot to think about.", "Saul: Did you get through to him at all?", "Sally: I tried, but he's seriously concerned about Thomas not being here anymore.", "Darlita: Oh, my gosh. Do we all have crushes on that man?", "Saul: That's not -- that's not really why CJ's concerned. [Sighs]", "Shirley: Wait just one second. Would having Thomas here sway CJ?", "Sally: I think so.", "Shirley: Well, then, what are you waiting for? Get lover boy on the phone and tell him to make a beeline back here to the best coast!", "Sally: I can't.", "Darlita: It's easy, Sal. I'll teach you. All you have to do is press 1 before you dial.", "Sally: Pressuring him is not the answer right now, okay? He will come back whenever he's able to, but until then, we have to do this on our own.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Well, I told Steffy.", "Bill: Of course you did. And?", "Liam: And she talked me into keeping quiet for now.", "Bill: I told you she'd see the wisdom of this. [Intercom buzzes] Yeah? Really? Send him in. CJ Garrison's here.", "Liam: Oh, great. I'm gonna go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: No, no, no. Stick around. This'll be fun. CJ! Always a pleasure. I see you have the contract for me.", "CJ: I do, yes.", "Bill: I hope it wasn't too rough with Sally, she didn't get too emotional. A lot of tears. Women tend to do that.", "CJ: No, it was a really good conversation, actually.", "Bill: You didn't sign, CJ. Need a pen?", "CJ: Not yet, no.", "Bill: Not yet?", "CJ: I'm giving Sally more time.", "Bill: Excuse me?", "CJ: They have a showing scheduled -- one more line, one more chance to keep Spectra alive.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: [Groans]", "Eric: Oh, Quinn... are you okay?", "Quinn: No.", "Eric: I know you're angry with me.", "Quinn: No, I'm not angry. I just -- I just don't understand your decision.", "Eric: I'll keep an eye on her, all right? If she does anything wrong --", "Quinn: Isn't that when her bad behavior, it goes too far? When somebody's lying, bleeding on the floor?", "Eric: You mean like she was a few minutes ago?", "Quinn: I --", "Eric: Look, Sheila has been through an extensive amount of therapy. I've seen some of the benefits of that myself. She took very good care of me when I was away. I will never completely trust her. I promise you. I'll keep one eye open all the time. But I can give her a place to stay while she recovers from the injuries that -- that you caused.", "Quinn: Look, Sheila and I -- both of us -- never should have let this get physical. But we don't need to be responsible for this. There has to be another solution.", "Eric: It's just for a short time. When she gets better, I'll send her on her way.", "Quinn: Do you promise?", "Eric: I promise. All right, look, it's been a long day. I'm gonna go up. Come on. You gonna go with me?", "Quinn: No, I just -- I'll -- I'll be up in a few minutes.", "Eric: I'll take care of Sheila. I can handle her.", "Quinn: Okay. But I think I'll handle Sheila first.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Music box plays]", "Bill: You're turning down my original, very generous offer plus another $5 million tax-free dollars.", "CJ: Yep. I sure am. It's crazy, I know, but, you see, I remembered something. I'm a Spectra, too. And I was there with my mother in the trenches all those years ago, and it feels good to know that Sally --", "Bill: Good? [Chuckles] Good? Really? Why would you want to feel good when you can feel great with all those millions?", "CJ: They deserve another shot. A fair one. You know, without someone trying to sabotage it. So one more line, and when Thomas comes back --", "Bill: If! If Thomas comes back. And I'm starting to think that is highly unlikely. Get out of my sight.", "[Door closes]", "Liam: You all right?", "Bill: I'm fine. Just fine. Spectra... \"one more shot.\" Without Thomas, they will fail. And fail miserably.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: One more line? Are you serious? And -- and we'll re-evaluate after the show? Thank you, thank you, thank you, CJ. I promise you won't regret this. [Gasps]", "Darlita: One more line?", "Sally: One more line. One more chance!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laughter, cheering] Letting us stay letting us stay", "Saul: We did it! We did it! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!", "Shirley: Whoo!", "Saul: Oh! [Laughs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: \"One more showing.\" Without Thomas, they're nothing, and they'll stay nothing. Caroline's miracle cure just got postponed. Thomas can't leave her side. Not until that building is mine.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Sheila: Eric?", "Quinn: Making yourself at home, I see.", "Sheila: I didn't hear the knock. Come on in.", "Quinn: So, tell me, nurse, how long does it take for a person to recover from a concussion, so they can be on their own? What is it, one day? Two?", "Sheila: Each case is different.", "Quinn: I'm not gonna let you get away with this.", "Sheila: Get away with what? What -- what do you think that I'm doing here, Quinn?", "Quinn: \"Oh! Mm.\" Oh, it's so obvious. You're faking this concussion to try and get Eric back. What, you want him to what, to kick me out so that you can move in here?", "Sheila: I've already moved in.", "Quinn: You think you're gonna replace me?", "Sheila: I was Mrs. Eric Forrester long before you.", "Quinn: Mm, but you never, ever will be again. It doesn't matter if Eric and I are married. He's never gonna take you back. He may be very nice to you right now because, you know, you're making amends and showing how prison has -- has changed you, but he's not buying it. In fact, nobody's buying it. You're still dangerous. You're still pathetic. And you're still unwanted. And as soon as you're better, you're going to be out of this house and out of our lives. I'm gonna see to that.", "Sheila: You know what, that's really not for you to decide. That's a decision Eric can make. He can tell me when he wants me to leave, but in the meantime, I'll be watching you -- the cheating wife.", "Quinn: You can watch all you want, there's nothing to see.", "Sheila: Really? Even when Ridge comes over?", "Quinn: [Scoffs] You don't even know what you're talking about.", "Sheila: No, I know you. Because I was you. You set yourself up for destruction. You're not gonna be able to get out of your way. And I'll be waiting. When you do something to prove that you're not worthy of Eric's love, that you're not worthy to have your painting hanging on his wall...", "Quinn: But you think you're worthy. That just proves how crazy and delusional you still are.", "Sheila: Don't underestimate me, Quinn. Ever.
