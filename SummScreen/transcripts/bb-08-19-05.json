        "Nick: So this is how it feels.",
        "Bridget: What does?",
        "Nick: To be completely happy. I want nothing more than what I'm holding -- you, and my child. God, I love you. I love you so much. Thank you.",
        "Bridget: Don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I don't want anything from you, Stephanie, and neither does Bridget.",
        "Stephanie: Well, how do you know until you've seen it?",
        "Brooke: I thought you said it was for Bridget.",
        "Stephanie: It is. But it's the kind of gift that only you can give to her.",
        "Brooke: For the baby?",
        "Stephanie: For the baby, too -- if there still is one.",
        "Brooke: I'm not going to listen to that. Bridget would never, ever --",
        "Stephanie: Can you be so sure? You heard her, you saw her. Was she the Bridget you've always known -- that sweet daughter with her loving heart, the one good thing this family could always rely on?",
        "Brooke: And you blame me.",
        "Stephanie: No. You know, I finally understand you. I think I had to go through this -- this humiliation and through the same sort of terrible losses that you've suffered to understand that you're a victim, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You can say whatever you want to me.",
        "Bridget: It's all been said. I'm done with it.",
        "Nick: Have you seen a doctor? Do you feel all right?",
        "Bridget: Yes, I've seen a doctor.",
        "Nick: Would you -- would you come back to the boat with me and get some rest? Last night was hard on all of us.",
        "Bridget: That's not why I asked you to meet me here.",
        "Nick: There were some ugly things said and done, and there's no taking them back. So whatever reason you asked me to meet you here, if you want to tell me we're going our separate ways, that's not what's happening.",
        "Bridget: What are you doing?",
        "Nick: I'm putting this back on, 'cause you never should've taken it off.",
        "Bridget: You know why I did. I had to.",
        "Nick: Well, you were wrong!",
        "Bridget: It is not your decision.",
        "Nick: It is my decision. Bridget, you came to me last night because you wanted something, you needed something, but you wouldn't let me talk. You wouldn't hear me. So here's what we're going to do. As soon as the doctor says that you're okay, we weigh anchor, and we go. And then when we decide, we bring our firstborn home, and we introduce him to the family, we do something I never dreamed that I'd do -- live in a normal house in a normal neighborhood. And we'll have a big yard with a swing-set and a couple of good climbing trees. And we raise our son or daughter.",
        "Bridget: Do you -- do you really want to run away with me, or are you just running away from my mother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: You love Bridget, don't you?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: And you want her to be happy?",
        "Brooke: Of course.",
        "Stephanie: I know how to make peace for you.",
        "Brooke: Well, I don't really have much faith in your advice, Stephanie, but all right. How? What's in it?",
        "Stephanie: Open it.",
        "Brooke: Something dead?",
        "Stephanie: No.",
        "Brooke: Something alive?",
        "Stephanie: No. But life giving, in the right hands.",
        "Brooke: That's absurd. Nothing in a cute little box with a cute little ribbon wrapped around it could be a solution to anything. Bridget is with Nick, and that's all that matters.",
        "Stephanie: And I'm sure he's making her the promises that he's made so many times before. It's all over between you two. It's all in the past.",
        "Brooke: Yes, it is.",
        "Stephanie: I have no doubt that he believes that. When was the last time he was here? An hour ago, 15 minutes?",
        "Brooke: He was looking for Bridget. Oh, my god, you're blaming me again! I'm sick of it!",
        "Stephanie: No. No, no, no, no, no. It's nothing that you consciously do. It's just the long line of men at the door. I mean, my husband's side of the bed wasn't even cold before he was on his way over here to ask you to marry him.",
        "Brooke: I was as shocked by that as you were.",
        "Stephanie: Why do men see you the way they do?",
        "Brooke: Frankly, I wish I knew.",
        "Stephanie: Men just see you as the ultimate sexual refuge.",
        "Brooke: I've never pretended to be anything I'm not.",
        "Stephanie: Exactly.",
        "Brooke: So what do you want me to do, Stephanie? Just slam the door in Nick's face?",
        "Stephanie: No. He'll just come back.",
        "Brooke: I don't want him to want me or to need me for anything.",
        "Stephanie: Lucky for you, and for all of us. There's a way to close that door, once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Be strong, Bridget. Just be strong.",
        "Nick: Bridget, I think you may be misunderstanding.",
        "Bridget: Then tell me, where exactly do I fit into this escape fantasy of yours?",
        "Nick: Fit in? But you're everything. You're the reason for all of this.",
        "Bridget: How hard would that be to lose you again, after having you to myself for a year, every hour of the day?",
        "Nick: Well, that's not going to happen.",
        "Bridget: Oh, yeah?! That's what you always say! You always say that! But how am I supposed to believe you when she's always there?! I can't be this neurotic person anymore, just wondering where you are and if you're with her, what you're doing, knowing good and well if I ask you, you're just gonna say, \"oh, nothing. Stop being so insecure.\" I'd rather be with no one! I'd rather just put us out of our misery right now.",
        "Nick: Well, I'm not letting you go. Everything's different from a week ago, if you haven't noticed.",
        "Bridget: And I thought so, too, at first.",
        "Nick: And maybe you won't believe anything that I have to say again. But our child, what about that? Can't you believe in that? That's your blood and mine. I will never let you down again.",
        "Bridget: I guess you just thought you could love me if it was some sort of a package deal. I'm sorry, it's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: This isn't just a question of Bridget's sanity. She cannot lose another man to you. She's not going to have that baby if she thinks there's the remotest chance that you and nick will end up raising it.",
        "Brooke: Well, there isn't! I would never!",
        "Stephanie: Well, in her mind, it's already happened once before. Deacon's baby should have been hers, not yours.",
        "Brooke: Well, I could tell Nick not to come over here. That way, we wouldn't see each other.",
        "Stephanie: A lot of good that did with Deacon. Aren't you tired of all this? I mean, it's exhausting just watching it.",
        "Brooke: Damn it, Stephanie, I never meant to hurt Taylor. I never meant to hurt her children.",
        "Stephanie: Or me?",
        "Brooke: Yes, or you, believe it or not! I was just trying to live my life! But this is my daughter we're talking about. You should have seen the pain on her face, Stephanie, the hurt. I mean, how did it get to this? Maybe it was a mistake to actually admit that Nick and I still had feelings for each other.",
        "Stephanie: Sometimes the answers are right in front of us. But we all have blind spots. You helped me with mine. So I'm here to help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Dante fantasizing ]",
        "Bridget: Dante! Dante!",
        "Dante: Another letter from home? Just throw it away. You're so happy here in italy.",
        "Bridget: It's not another letter from home.",
        "Dante: Well, what is it?",
        "Bridget: It's just something I need you to translate.",
        "Dante: Let me see it.",
        "Bridget: I already know what it is.",
        "Dante: You ran all this way to show me, and you won't even let me see it? What is it? We're going to have a baby together? I'm going to be a father? Yeah! I'm so happy. Unbelievable!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: This is all about us. I want us to be together for this child.",
        "Bridget: Well, I know what else you want. You want to feel like you're a good person. I've been thinking about us a lot lately, when we were right and when we weren't. I was up all night talking about it with Dante.",
        "Nick: Well, he'd say anything to undermine me.",
        "Bridget: Don't you dare begrudge me a friend. After everything you and my mother have put me through, at least he tells me the truth.",
        "Nick: Bridget, maybe I lied to myself because I didn't know how to say this, but the truth is, every man that you've loved before me has left you, betrayed you and treated you like dirt. It all turned bitter for you, but that didn't happen to me. Now, your mother and I didn't work out, but it was no one's fault. She never gave me a reason to stop caring about her.",
        "Bridget: I guess I didn't either.",
        "Nick: I'm trying to be honest here. I have been honest that there is a connection, but it's not in that way. It's not like that. It has nothing to do with us.",
        "Bridget: Maybe you really believe that, but I grew up with her. Every man that I ever cared about made her the center of their world -- my uncles and my father, my -- my own husband. I can't -- I can't go through that again with you.",
        "Nick: You're just overreacting to the situation here, you know? What happened with little Hope -- I mean, for god's sake, we almost lost that little girl.",
        "Bridget: Do you hear yourself?! You talk about Hope as if she was your daughter together. What does that make me? This is all just so insane and incestuous. What you really want is a child with my mother, not me. And now you're free to have that. Wanna know a secret?",
        "Nick: Well, I don't want to be free. I'm not free.",
        "Bridget: Why not? I love you, and you know that. It just wasn't enough to hold you. And now it's just -- it's hurting me so much, I feel like I'm going crazy. I just need to get rid of it. I don't care how anymore. So please just go!",
        "Nick: Go? I mean, you can't tell me that you're carrying my baby and then tell me to walk away.",
        "Bridget: I'm not, Nick. I'm just telling you to walk away.",
        "Nick: I don't understand.",
        "Bridget: If you don't go, I will. So fine, I'll go.",
        "Nick: But Bridget, wait, wait! Wait a second, wait. We can't turn our backs on this, you -- don't you get that? Now we've got to stay here and work things out. There's a child involved. Bridget --",
        "Bridget: I never said that there was, Nick. I never -- I never told you that there was a child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So you think I should go away, is that it?",
        "Stephanie: Open the box.",
        "Brooke: I guess I could go to the Paris office, or Milan for a couple of months.",
        "Stephanie: It has to be a complete break. Otherwise, Bridget will never trust Nick again.",
        "Brooke: And how would I do that?",
        "Stephanie: So easily. Open the box.",
        "Brooke: Ridge would never let me take R.J.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, R.J. will be fine, and Ridge will understand. Matter of fact, he'll be grateful to you. We all will.",
        "Brooke: So you made reservations for me?",
        "Stephanie: You don't need a reservation. You'll be welcomed anytime. You can travel light -- just what you're wearing.",
        "Brooke: Why are you putting gloves on?",
        "Stephanie: What does the color white symbolize for you?",
        "Brooke: Weddings. Christmas.",
        "Stephanie: Purity? Innocence?",
        "Brooke: I don't like the way you're acting, Stephanie. I think you should leave.",
        "Stephanie: You'll be there before you know it. Quick as a bang.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Bridget! Bridget.",
        "Bridget: No, please, leave me alone.",
        "Nick: Tell me, what are you talking about?",
        "Bridget: Please, leave me alone!",
        "Nick: Tell me. Bridget --",
        "Bridget: I can't even look at you.",
        "Nick: Bridget, tell me what you're talking about.",
        "Bridget: Just go. You can go and be with my mother.",
        "Nick: Stephanie said you were pregnant. Are you, or aren't you?",
        "Bridget: You don't owe me anything.",
        "Nick: She said she was there when you took the test.",
        "Bridget: Well, that was then. I don't have what you want anymore. I don't have what you want anymore."
