{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7135 ~ Thomas struggles with his romantic feelings for Caroline; Liam & Ivy have a candid conversation about love & murder."], "Recap": ["Ivy thanks Wyatt for bringing her coffee the next morning. He says it is almost as sexy with her putting his clothes on as in taking them off. He does not mind them being late for work; they can tell all they had a breakfast meeting. She tells him how lucky he is that he did not delete that video. He says it is still there because she asked him not to. At the meeting Steffy is clearly distracted when they ask her about Lt. Baker questioning her. She says it is no story; she has taken care of it ..everything is under control. Liam is surprised this is the first he is hearing about it. She jokes that he was more interested in the hotdog they gave him at lunch than about Aly, so nothing to worry about. They didn't even get started when Steffy said there was something she needed to take care of and needed to go; it would not take long. Ridge tells the others that for some reason Steffy is on Baker's radar and he wants to know why. Steffy shows up at Wyatt's and says he knows why she is there. She demands to know if he deleted the video. He admits that no he didn't. Ivy is hurting. She was the closest to Aly as anyone. Steffy says Ivy is blackmailing her, also Wyatt. He is lashing out at Steffy because she chose Liam over him. They both feel like they got a raw deal but this is not a game she is playing. She realizes this video could get her in real trouble with Ivy going behind her back and spreading these rumors. She is innocent. Aly attacked her and she defended herself. The video is dangerous and does not show what really happened.", "Liam and Ivy argue what really happened. She says that is not what she saw and she was there. He admits that he knows she is still angry at him for choosing Steffy over her and he is sorry for that, but that does not change this outcome. She says fine, he chose Steffy and now he gets her and all her secrets so he can go ask her exactly what happened. Ivy goes back to Wyatt's and he is glad she is going to play hooky. She says no, but Liam was there and got her all riled up. Steffy was the one who came back into town and broke them up yet Ivy is the one who is now suddenly vicious. But Liam hasn't seen the video and Steffy hasn't mentioned it either. Wyatt reminds her they have talked about this and she needs to let Steffy deal with this in her own way. Ivy arrives at FC and runs into Liam. She asks if Steffy sent him to talk to her as she knows that would be awkward. First Steffy takes Liam from her and now wants his help with Ivy in a jam. He wants to know what sort of jam Steffy is in. Ivy says she assumed he would know. She says she is not enjoying this but he needs to know his precious little Steffy is not as blameless as she claims. Steffy goes back to the office and Liam is surprised that she left the meeting to go see Wyatt. She says she went to see him about his new girlfriend. Someone needs to remind her that Steffy is the boss and she needs to be shown respect. She laments she would have asked Liam but Ivy is not exactly warm and fuzzy toward him either. She's just jealous. Steffy says they all know what happened and they need to put it behind them. Liam says no, Ivy thinks something else happens. She did not come out and say it but she does think that Steffy is responsible and he knows she is not."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["[Seagulls calling]", "Wyatt: Coffee?", "Ivy: Thank you.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Ivy: [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: What?

They -- they look great.", "Ivy: [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: What are you talking about?", "Ivy: No, I can't. I have to go home and change.", "Wyatt: Wh-- fine. I'll -- I'll take you. And then we can have a little \"lunch meeting.\"", "Ivy: As much as I would love to, I can't.", "Wyatt: Huh? Eh.", "Ivy: I hope you realize how lucky you are, by the way.", "Wyatt: I like that in a woman. Self-confidence.", "Ivy: You know deleting this video would have been a huge mistake.", "Wyatt: Look, I know that you think that it proves that Steffy killed your cousin.", "Ivy: Yeah. And you don't.", "Wyatt: That's not why it's still on your phone. Ivy, I didn't delete the video because you asked me not to.", "Ivy: [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: Okay?", "Ivy: Mm-hmm.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Steffy. Steffy! Liam asked you something.", "Steffy: I'm sorry?", "Liam: [Chuckles] Lieutenant baker was here yesterday to talk to you.", "Steffy: You told him?", "Ridge: Well, yeah. He's vice president of the company. Needs to know what's going on.", "Steffy: Yeah, but it's not about Forrester.", "Caroline: You and Aly were family. You both worked here. I mean, if it gets out in the press that the police are investigating her death and that they talked to you --", "Thomas: And I'm sure bill Spencer would love that story.", "Steffy: No, there's -- there's no story. I've taken care of it. The situation is under control.", "Liam: Okay, I'm just surprised that this is the first I'm hearing of this. What did you say to him?", "Steffy: Oh, it was nothing. Lieutenant baker was more interested in the hot dogs we had for lunch than what I had to say about Aly, so it's nothing to worry about.", "Ridge: All right, there's a couple of things we need to talk about. I'd like to start.", "Steffy: Actually, um, I have to go. Yeah, I, uh, I got to go. Got to run.", "Ridge: You have to go now?", "Steffy: Yeah, there's just something I need to take care of. I won't be long.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door closes]", "Ridge: You miss one, little detail, it distorts everything.", "Thomas: Yeah, I get that.", "Ridge: Where was your sister going?", "Thomas: Uh, not sure.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: She's been gone awhile.", "Ridge: I'm worried about her. You got baker walking in here talking about Aly's death, and now Steffy has to relive it all.", "Caroline: Yeah, but they have to investigate. It's just police protocol.", "Ridge: I've known the lieutenant for a long time. This wasn't a formality. Steffy's on his radar, and I want to know why.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Why do you think I'm here, Wyatt? I told you to delete that video from Ivy's phone. Did you do it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Birds chirping]", "Ivy: Oh. [Sighs]", "Liam: Ivy. Hi.", "Ivy: Hi.", "Liam: Uh, yeah, I know things are a little awkward between us still.", "Ivy: Wait, now you're talking to me?", "Liam: I'm trying to.", "Ivy: Why? Did Steffy ask you to come down here and plead her case or something?", "Liam: Excuse me?", "Ivy: [Scoffs] It's always funny that she took you away from me and now she's gonna use our past to get herself out of a jam.", "Liam: Nobody asked me to do anything. I don't know what you're talking about right now.", "Ivy: Uh, wait, she hasn't said anything?", "Liam: Jam. You said jam. Steffy's in a jam? What jam?", "Ivy: No, no, it's -- it's, um... no, if -- if she knows, then you know.", "Liam: Know what?!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Hey, Thomas. I know you love your sister. So what are you guys fighting about?", "Thomas: We're not. Did someone say we were?", "Ridge: There's a lot of tension.", "Thomas: Well, yeah, dad. It's been pretty stressful for everyone around here.", "Ridge: It's been stressful for everyone. It's been especially stressful for your sister. And instead of supporting her, you turn your back on her. You agreed with Wyatt.", "Thomas: That was a business decision.", "Ridge: How is that a business decision? She needed you to be in her corner, and you threw in with the Spencers.", "Caroline: Should I just be covering my ears at this point?", "Ridge: I understand why Wyatt would want Ivy to be the face of Forrester, but why do you want that?", "Caroline: I think that Thomas brings up a good point about the police investigation, even if it is just protocol. If the press catches wind of it, it could reflect really badly on our line.", "Ridge: So we just keep her out of the spotlight? Is that it?", "Thomas: She's been through enough.", "Ridge: That's not what I'm talking about! What am I missing? Why are you going after your sister?", "Thomas: I didn't do it to hurt her. I did it to protect her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I don't care how you did it. I just want to know if you deleted the video.", "Wyatt: I had Ivy's phone in my hand, okay?", "Steffy: Yes or no?", "Wyatt: Ivy was in the other room. I had my finger over the button. I was about to push it, and then I...", "Steffy: What?", "Wyatt: I didn't. I couldn't do it.", "Steffy: Why not?", "Wyatt: Because Ivy came out and she caught me.", "Steffy: What did you tell her?", "Wyatt: I tried to explain to her.", "Steffy: So now she knows that I know about the video? What did she say?", "Wyatt: Well, she didn't want me to delete it, obviously.", "Steffy: So instead of making the situation better, you just made it 1,000 times worse.", "Wyatt: I wouldn't put it quite like that, but...", "Steffy: I thought I could count on you. I thought you were gonna do this.", "Wyatt: I tried.", "Steffy: Well, then try again!", "Wyatt: I can't! Things have changed.", "Steffy: Yes. Yes, they have. Now Ivy has more ammunition with her wacko vendetta. She's out of control.", "Wyatt: Things have changed between Ivy and me. With our relationship.", "Steffy: Since when?", "Wyatt: Last night.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: That's not fair.", "Ivy: [Scoffs] You want to talk to me about what's fair, Liam? Really?", "Liam: Okay. If you're not gonna tell me, I'm not gonna stand here and let you --", "Ivy: Ugh! Okay, okay! Just -- all right. Stop. Just stop. Yes, this is about Steffy. You know, that beautiful, edgy, dangerous girl that you left me for. That one. Is that the attraction? Was I just -- was I too honest and too sweet?", "Liam: No.", "Ivy: Really? So you don't like that kind of thing? You know, like something a little naughtier, a little darker?", "Liam: Why -- why are you doing this?", "Ivy: 'Cause I think you deserve to know what you've got.", "Liam: What is that, Ivy? What? Is that some kind of warning?", "Ivy: Yeah, that's actually exactly what this is. Do you think this is a game to me? Like I'm enjoying myself? Because I'm not. I need you to know that your precious little Steffy isn't as blameless in all this as she pretends to be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Protect her from what? What's going on, Thomas?", "Thomas: If there was something you needed to know, I'd tell you.", "Ridge: Tell me now.", "Thomas: Dad, you don't always have to be in control of everything, all right? Run the business, work on your designs. Our family's fine.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "[Door closes]", "Steffy: So, you and Ivy slept together? And now you can't help me out?", "Wyatt: I never said I can't help you out.", "Steffy: You didn't delete the video.", "Wyatt: And I'm not going to, either.", "Steffy: Why? Because you and Ivy are serious now?", "Wyatt: Because it wouldn't change anything, Steffy!", "Steffy: Yes, it would! If there was no video, there would be Ivy's word against mine!", "Wyatt: You really want to go down that road? Ivy's smart. She probably made another copy somewhere.", "Steffy: So you find it. You find the copy and you delete it.", "Wyatt: Look, I didn't expect her to react the way she did, but if I do what you're asking me to do, I could totally alienate her.", "Steffy: Oh. And if you don't do this, I could get dragged down to the police headquarters for something I didn't do!", "Wyatt: Nobody wants that!", "Steffy: Oh, Ivy does. That's why this video is so important to her.", "Wyatt: That's why I'm telling her not to use it.", "Steffy: Oh, okay. You're gonna tell her not to use it. So I have nothing to worry about.", "Wyatt: This isn't about you, Steffy! This is about Aly! Ivy -- Ivy was closer to her than anyone in the family. They lived together. And losing her like that, being there, Ivy is hurting.", "Steffy: Yeah. She's lashing out. She's blackmailing me. The same as you. You're mad I chose Liam over you.", "Wyatt: Oh, my God.", "Steffy: No, it's true. You and Ivy feel like you got a raw deal. But this isn't a game, okay? Ivy's not talking behind my back, spreading rumors. We're not in high school, all right? This video could get me in real trouble. I am innocent. Aly attacked me, and I defended myself. How many times do I have to say this to you? This video is dangerous. It doesn't show what really happened.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: What has Steffy told you about that night?", "Liam: Aly's accident? That's what this is about?", "Ivy: Yeah. What has she told you?", "Liam: Not much. She doesn't like talking about it.", "Ivy: [Scoffs] That's 'cause there's a reason for that.", "Liam: Yeah, Ivy. It was traumatic. Her cousin tried to kill her.", "Ivy: Except Aly's the one who died, Liam! Steffy's still here. She's still walking around. She's still alive.", "Liam: That does not make Steffy the bad guy. What happened to Aly was super- tragic, and we all wish there was something we could have done about it.", "Ivy: [Chuckles] Yeah? Well, Steffy did something, all right.", "Liam: Steffy was just changing her tire. Aly tried to run her over.", "Ivy: No, no, that is not what I saw.", "Liam: That's because you weren't there yet, Ivy!", "Ivy: No, because by the time I got there, they were fighting!", "Liam: Yeah, of course they were fighting! Aly attacked Steffy, and they were struggling when Aly fell and hit her head on a rock!", "Ivy: Is that what happened?", "Liam: What kind of question is that?", "Ivy: Because it seems to be the only question that matters.", "Liam: Don't -- don't do that.", "Ivy: Tell me you haven't felt it. When you and Steffy are alone, you're sitting with her, tell me you don't feel her distraction or her -- her anxiety.", "Liam: Okay, Ivy, whatever this is, this has to stop. I get that you're angry. You're angry with Steffy and me because of what happened between us. I hurt you, and I'm so sorry about that. But I really loved you, and I do think we can still --", "Ivy: No, don't say -- don't say that to me! You can't say that anymore! You chose Steffy! And now you have her, and that means you have her and all of her secrets. Do you really want to know what happened to Aly that night? You go and speak to your girlfriend!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: [Sighs]", "Caroline: Hey, stop. What are you doing? It's good.", "Thomas: It's not good enough for my dad.", "Caroline: You know what? You just -- you need a little bit of a twist. You need to -- you need to kind of see it and say, \"okay, I've been there, and so I'm just gonna take it a little bit further.\" Can...", "Thomas: Yeah.", "Caroline: So, what if you did something kind of like this and this? You know? Hello?", "Thomas: [Clears throat]", "Caroline: Wow. Okay. I totally lost you on that one, didn't I?", "Thomas: No, no. Uh...", "Caroline: What? Is it just too out there for you, or what?", "Thomas: It -- it's not that.", "Caroline: It's Steffy. You told your dad that she's fine, but you're concerned. I mean, she means a lot to you, and you just -- you want to be there for her.", "Thomas: Yes, I do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: So you decided to play hooky, huh?", "Ivy: Hmm. No, actually.", "Wyatt: Lunch meeting? Huh?", "Ivy: I, uh, I went to the office, and I saw Liam.", "Wyatt: Wow, okay. So what happened with that?", "Ivy: He thinks we can still be friends. If he says all the right things, he apologizes correctly, that voil\u00e0.", "Wyatt: Okay, he made you upset.", "Ivy: It's insulting. Steffy comes back into town. I mean, I shouldn't actually be upset because it was inevitable, apparently.", "Wyatt: He really riled you up today, didn't he?", "Ivy: Because Steffy's the one who broke up a committed relationship, yet I'm the one who's being hurtful and vicious.", "Wyatt: Wait, he said that to you? Okay, but you didn't accuse her...", "Ivy: Liam thinks she's the victim in all this.", "Wyatt: So he hasn't seen the video?", "Ivy: No. He hasn't. And Steffy hasn't said anything, either.", "Wyatt: And you didn't, either? Okay, well, you must have said something if he got all defensive about it.", "Ivy: Wyatt, I just want him to realize that his incredible, edgy Steffy is capable of doing some pretty bad things.", "Wyatt: Ivy, we talked about this. You got to let Steffy deal with this in her own way.", "Ivy: Well, maybe she needs a little more motivating.", "Wyatt: What'd you do?", "Ivy: I just -- all I said was that \"if you really want to know what happened to Aly that night, you should go and talk to Steffy.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I've been looking for you. I didn't think you'd be here.", "Liam: Hey. Yeah. Um, I just had some reports to drop off for Wyatt.", "Steffy: Oh, I just saw him. He's -- he's at home at the beach house.", "Liam: You left the meeting, that's where you went?", "Steffy: I needed him to take care of something for me.", "Liam: Something for work?", "Steffy: His new girlfriend.", "Liam: Ah. Ivy.", "Steffy: Yeah. Somebody's got to remind her that I'm her boss and she needs to show a little respect. I'd ask you to do it, but she's not feeling very warm and fuzzy towards you.", "Liam: Yeah. Tell me about it. She was just here, and she let me have it.", "Steffy: God. This needs to stop. She needs to get over this.", "Liam: By \"this,\" you mean us?", "Steffy: Yeah, that's why -- that's why she's mad.", "Liam: Well, I'll tell you something. Mad doesn't even begin to cover it, 'cause you should have heard what she said -- about you, specifically.", "Steffy: Like what?", "Liam: Just, you know, that she's too innocent and I clearly am interested in somebody more dangerous and aggressive and... bad. Like you.", "Steffy: [Scoffs] She's so immature. She's jealous.", "Liam: Well, see, that's what I thought, too, but then, um... then she brought up Aly and the night she died.", "Steffy: She won't stop talking about it. That's why I saw Wyatt.", "Liam: Just get her to rein it in or...", "Steffy: To help her deal with it. It's not good that she keeps rehashing this. We all know what happened. Aly lost it, and she attacked me. And sadly she's -- she's gone.", "Liam: Because she fell and she happened to hit her head on a rock. Ivy thinks something else happened, though.", "Steffy: What did -- what did she say?", "Liam: I mean, she didn't, like, come out and say anything, but I get the sense that she blames you. She thinks you're responsible for Aly's death. And, of course, I told her that's not true. I mean, I'm right, right? You're not responsible for Aly's death, are you?"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tOyVt303f8"}
