{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Deacon makes fun of the scribbles of Ridge; looks like the preschool down the street. Quinn says she took it out of his wastepaper basket herself. It's junk and apparently Ridge has lost his ability to draw. He apparently is keeping a huge secret, but she doesn't know why. She says there is a big story here and she and Deacon are going to find out what it is. He had panic all over his face, she can feel it. There is something he does not want anybody to know. She needs to gather some information. She knows Katie and Ridge are having lunch so they can go there and try to find out what is happening to Ridge. Over lunch, Katie asks why Quinn was even at the office. Ridge says she has been released from the facility; apparently she is cured now. He says he is struggling all because of Spencer. He can't draw or create. Katie suggests he tell his dad or Brooke but Ridge doesn't want them to know. At Brooke's Bill says he obviously made a very bad call ordering Ridge from the helicopter. He acted impulsively but Ridge did sucker punch him and drug her away from their wedding so he had to do something. She says he went too far. He admits he did but everyone is back to normal now and he'd like for them to focus on their future. He adds that their son and daughter just got married. They will be family for life, so all this family unity..... come on what a life it will be! Even Wyatt and Liam will be fine. Hope will see to that. He laments that she has become an exceptional young lady and he has come to admire her. He promises to never hurt Hope or anyone else she cares about ever again. That includes Ridge; he will be his new best friend. She says he does not have to be his best friend; just respect him. Bill says Ridge will be Will's step father some day and he will be RJ's so the Spencer's and Forrester's will be one big happy family. He says he will be nice to all of them, they can even double date with Ridge and Katie. In a month's time he will even play golf with Ridge and offer him a cocktail and invite him to his poker game. So just how long can old Grumpy hold a grudge. Life is pretty damn good. Brooke says except for Hope. She has a black widow for a mother-in-law. Bill says not to worry about her. She won't bother them again. Bill says he has changed all because of Brooke. She makes him want to be a better man. It is going to be smooth sailing from now on. He asks her to stay on this incredible journey and she agrees to marry him.", "At Liam's, Ivy and Aly are bending Liam's ear that Hope did not know he came to their special spot at the tower. She was waiting for him but he was late because of rescuing Ivy from the Seine. They both agree that he has to tell Hope. She needs to know that he was there. It will change everything. They relive the scene over and over that Liam thought he still had a chance to get to Hope even though late but the bottom line is she did not wait. Ivy says he was not that late and Aly says Hope should have had more faith in him. Liam says he should not have been so stubborn to let Hope go to Paris alone. But what he really can't get is that she turned to Wyatt so quickly and married him the very same day. He trusted him and let him in. He says he takes full responsibility for this. He can't blame it on his dad or Quinn this time; it is all on him. Aly says he can see Hope tomorrow at the party and explain. Ivy says he still loves Hope so she will explain. Do not give up on Hope. He can still get her back. He says Hope may already know that he was in Paris, so maybe it does not even matter. At some point enough is enough. His own father is telling him to leave Hope alone and he's beginning to think he is right. Bill comes back to Brooke's with this gigantic bottle of champagne. He tells her they are going to open it at Wyatt and Hope's party and then focus on their own wedding. He tells Captain Marx to pull out all the stops; he and Brooke are going to tie the knot. Then he tells Brooke that he loves her and he will never hurt anyone again. She is too precious to him. Katie tells Ridge that she hates he is going through this alone. Bill is getting off scott free as if nothing ever happened. Quinn, disguised in a big black hat and sunglasses is with Deacon and they manage to get a seat with her back to Ridge and she only hopes he will be a bit chatty. They overhear Ridge say that he can't draw or design. Spencer took that all away from him. Katie says all the more reason that Brooke needs to know what Bill has done and it wasn't just a dunk in the ocean. Ridge says no; this must be kept between the two of them. Quinn looks in triumph at Deacon."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Deacon: Are you sure you got that out of Ridge's office and not the preschool down the street? I mean, it looks like a bunch of scribble.", "Quinn: I snuck them out of Ridge's office myself.", "Deacon: What the hell is this even supposed to be? It looks like a -- looks like a guy in a space suit or something.", "Quinn: It's junk. Apparently, Ridge Forrester has lost his ability to draw.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: What was Quinn even doing there? Isn't she supposed to be in some kind of treatment facility?", "Ridge: Well, apparently, she got released 'cause she's cured now.", "Katie: Well, she shouldn't be involved. Look what happened last time.", "Ridge: It's not keeping Brooke away from Bill, is it?", "Katie: You don't know that.", "Ridge: Struggling, Katie. I can't draw, I can't create, and all because of Spencer.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Obviously, I made a very bad call ordering Ridge's fall from the helicopter. I reacted impulsively. But he did break up our wedding, sucker- punch me in the face, and drag you away. I had to do something.", "Brooke: You went too far, Bill.", "Bill: Yes. I went too far. But time has passed, Ridge is fine. He's back to his life's passion -- making dresses. And now I want to focus on our future. Will you do that with me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: Hope doesn't know you were at your special spot near the Eiffel tower. Liam, she thinks you didn't come.", "Liam: I -- I know, Aly. I was late.", "Aly: Yeah, because Ivy fell into the seine, and you jumped in and saved her.", "Liam: Ivy!", "Aly: You have to tell hope. Liam, she needs to know you were there.", "Liam: Hope is married to Wyatt, guys. It's too late, okay? It's too late.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: No. No, it's not. It's never too late, not for you and hope.", "Ivy: It couldn't hurt to explain to her that you were on you way. Tell her it was my fault you didn't get there on time.", "Aly: How did that happen, anyway? Thousands of people cross that bridge every day. I've never heard of anyone falling in?", "Ivy: It was crowded, and... I was up there, I was trying to take a photo, and then I was bumped, and I fell over.", "Aly: That is so weird. You have to explain it to hope. When she finds out, it is going to change everything.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: My son and your daughter are married. Our families are connected -- for life. Now, if we can have peace and respect flowing through the generations, come on. What a life it'll be.", "Brooke: Right. It'll be a while before there's peace between Liam and Wyatt.", "Bill: Oh, now, they're gonna be fine. Hope will see to that. You know, she's become an exceptional young lady, and I have -- I have come to really admire her. I'll never do anything to hurt hope or anyone else you care about ever again.", "Brooke: Including Ridge.", "Bill: Oh, I'm gonna be his new best friend.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: That slimeball Spencer -- he's the reason I lost my identity.", "Katie: It's temporary.", "Ridge: Is it? It's been like this for weeks. There's no improvement.", "Katie: I think you should tell someone about this -- your dad or Brooke. They would want to help you.", "Ridge: No. No, I don't want anyone to know about that. We'll keep that between us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Ridge is keeping a huge secret. The question is, why? Why can't he draw?", "Deacon: Look, maybe it's like writer's block or something. You know, eventually, he'll get it back.", "Quinn: Yeah, but how long has this been going on?", "Deacon: Who cares?", "Quinn: I care. There's a story here, deacon -- a big one. And you and I are gonna find out what it is.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You know, I was... planning on marrying hope in paris. I had my ring, I was all set to meet her. Even after Ivy fell into the seine, I thought -- I thought I still had a chance. I'm running through the streets of paris, I'm soaking wet, I'm headed to the Eiffel tower as fast as I possibly can, and I... I get there, and I look around, and I look, and I look... and hope's gone. So, yeah. So I was too late.", "Aly: Why didn't hope wait for you? She should've had faith you'd be there.", "Ivy: You weren't that late, Liam.", "Liam: Well, I was late enough. I was late enough for her to run f with Wyatt.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: You don't have to be Ridge's best friend. I just want you to respect him.", "Bill: He's gonna be will's stepfather someday. And I'm gonna be R.J.'S. The Spencers and the Forresters -- one big happy family.", "Brooke: Yeah. That's what I've wanted all along.", "Bill: I'm ready to move on -- be the man you need, what this family needs. I'm gonna be good to your sons, to your daughters. I'll make nice with your sister. We can go on a double date with Ridge and Katie.", "Brooke: My, my. Some lofty goals you have.", "Bill: Well, let me tell you something -- in a month's time, I'm gonna be playing 18 holes with Ridge, we're gonna have a cocktail. Maybe I'll even ask him to join my poker game.", "Brooke: Assuming he forgives you.", "Bill: How long can grumpy hold on to a grudge? Look, he got me back pretty good -- hijacks my helicopter, gets me to acknowledge what I did. He's got Katie, he's got his kids, he's got his work. Life is pretty damn good.", "Brooke: All's well that ends well.", "Bill: You said it, not me.", "Brooke: I just wish I could say the same about Quinn.", "Bill: Eh, don't worry about her. She knows better than to mess with us again.", "Brooke: The one downside to hope marrying Wyatt -- she has a black widow for a mother-in-law.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: Okay, I see the wheels turning. What do you got up your sleeve?", "Quinn: I am trying to figure that out.", "Deacon: What is the big deal if Ridge can't design? Who cares? I mean, it's not great for his career, but, I mean, the guy can't need money. My God, he's got to be loaded.", "Quinn: Okay, deacon, try -- okay? -- Just try and follow me here. It's not just that Ridge can't draw. What caused it? Why doesn't he want anyone to know?", "Deacon: Just because nobody told you does not mean it's this big secret.", "Quinn: You didn't see his face earlier. He was panicked. He didn't want anyone to see these.", "Deacon: He was probably embarrassed. I mean, look at this crap! I'd be embarrassed, too.", "Quinn: No, it's more than that. I can feel it.", "Deacon: Okay, all right. You know what? What's -- what's the plan here? And none of your crazy shenanigans, either.", "Quinn: Nobody's saying anything about crazy shenanigans. [Sighs] I just -- I want to gather some information. And I know exactly where to find him.", "Deacon: They're not gonna let you back into Forrester. Last time, you were escorted out by security.", "Quinn: I know, but we are not going back to Forrester. He and Katie are having lunch at Il Giardino. You and I are gonna go there, and we're gonna find out what's happening with Ridge.", "Deacon: [Sighs] No, this will end well.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Every day I can't do my job, I'm reminded of Bill. I can't be around the guy.", "Katie: I understand that, but this is about hope. This is a celebration of her marriage to Wyatt.", "Ridge: Marrying a Spencer.", "Katie: So? Wyatt is not his father. He's not a bad guy. And this is hope. You love her.", "Ridge: Yes, of course I do. She's like a daughter to me. I practically raised her. That's -- I want her to be happy. That's why I don't want Bill to be her father-in-law. What is it about this guy? Why? Why can't -- why can't Brooke see what everybody else sees? Why can't she cut ties with this man?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: What you did in Abu Dhabi -- something like that can never happen again.", "Bill: That was the old Bill -- impulsive, hot-tempered. Is there still a little bit of him in me? Well, hell yeah. That is part of my considerable charm. But I'm changing because of you, your influence. You make me want to be a better man. I guarantee you, it's gonna be smooth sailing from here on. I just want you to remember the good things. And our trip to the middle east wasn't all bad, was it?", "Brooke: We had some amazing times together.", "Bill: Marry me. Stay on this incredible adventure with me.", "Brooke: All right, my habibi. I will marry you.", "Bill: You'll marry me?", "Brooke: Yes!", "Bill: My beautiful habibti.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Both laugh]", "Katie: Well, maybe Brooke will surprise us all and be done with Bill.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: He gave R.J. A sword necklace. Who does that? I don't want that cartoon character anywhere around my son. Cartoon character -- I can't even say that, right? 'Cause he's not whimsical, he's not funny. He's dangerous.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: He's right over there.", "Quinn: I have eyes. Hello. Table for two?", "Quinn: Yes, please. Uh, do you mind if we sit at that table? Sure. Follow me.", "Deacon: I cannot believe you've got me...", "Quinn: Thank you.", "Deacon: ...Spying on Ridge and Katie. Definitely gonna need a cocktail for this one.", "Quinn: Well, let's hope Ridge is feeling a little extra chatty today.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: I was just being stubborn, you know? I shouldn't have let her go to paris without me. You know what I don't understand? What I don't understand is how she could turn to him so quickly. Marry him the same day? The same day?", "Ivy: Wyatt probably pressured her.", "Liam: Yeah, but you know what? I shouldn't have let him anywhere near her. I trusted him. I let him in. And he played me.", "Aly: I am so sorry, Liam.", "Liam: No, you know something? I take responsibility for everything that's happened, because I can't blame this on my dad. I can't blame it on Quinn this time. Yeah, this is -- this is on me.", "Ivy: Liam, this was just a misunderstanding. You can't give up on hope like this.", "Aly: She'll be home tomorrow for the party. You have to tell her what happened to Ivy.", "Ivy: I'll talk to her. I'll just tell her the truth. I'll tell her how excited you were to surprise her, that you were there, you were gonna meet her, you had your ring, you were gonna marry her in paris. I'll just tell her it was my fault.", "Liam: Ivy, it's not your fault.", "Ivy: Liam, if I hadn't fallen into that river, you would have made it on time. You would be marrying hope. You'd be planning your future together. You love her, Liam. Do whatever you can to get her back.", "Aly: You are a hero, Liam. You saved Ivy's life. Hope needs to know that.", "Liam: Guys, I'm not a hero, okay? Anybody would've done the same thing.", "Aly: No, only a gentleman like you.", "Liam: But -- okay. At some point, hope is gonna find out I was in paris. Maybe she already knows. Maybe it doesn't even matter.", "Ivy: Well, then you have to talk to her.", "Liam: At what point is enough enough, Ivy? She's married. She's married to my brother, Wyatt, and my father is telling me to leave it alone. Starting to think he's right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Hey, look what -- Brooke? Brooke! Oh, there you are.", "Brooke: What is that?", "Bill: Biggest bottle of champagne I could find on short notice.", "Brooke: [Laughs] Everything is larger than life for you, isn't it?", "[Both laugh]", "Bill: You know what we're gonna do? We are going to open this at hope and Wyatt's party, celebrate their marriage... and then get focused on our own. In fact, hold that thought. I'm gonna call my captain right now.", "Brooke: Monte Carlo?", "Bill: On my yacht. It'll be magnificent.", "Brooke: Oh.", "Bill: Captain Marx. Good. Listen, I need you to do it again. Brooke and I are finally tying the knot. We're gonna have a little party for hope and Wyatt tomorrow, then we're gonna jump on my jet and head your way. Yes, that's right. Now listen to me -- I want you to pull out all the stops. Only the best for my bride. All right, we'll see you in a bit. Boom! We will be there before you know it.", "Brooke: Oh, my God. That sounds wonderful. It does. I -- I just need to reiterate -- nobody is ever going to get hurt again.", "Bill: I've learned my lesson. No more mistakes. Nobody's gonna get hurt. I will never do anything to risk losing you again. You're too precious to me. I love you.", "Brooke: I love you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Fine. I'll go to the party tomorrow. Just keep me away from Bill.", "Katie: Fine. I just hate that you're struggling with this, and that you're keeping it all inside and you're not telling anyone. Well, once again, Bill gets off scot-free. He's living his life like nothing happened. He should be held accountable for what he's cost you. Brooke should know the truth.", "Ridge: How much longer. How much longer before I get my life back?", "Katie: Soon. It's just a matter of time.", "Ridge: I can't draw, I can't design. Spencer took that away from me.", "Katie: I just don't get it. I mean, Brooke knows that the fall was not an accident, she knows about Justin piloting the helicopter, she knows that Bill gave the order to dump you into the ocean. That should be enough to keep her away from him. I mean, you could've died.", "Ridge: But she's not staying away, is she?", "Katie: Because she doesn't know what this has cost you. Everyone thinks you've made a full recovery, that you're fine.", "Ridge: Well, obviously not fine.", "Katie: Brooke should know the truth.", "Ridge: No. She can't know. No one can know. Promise me -- give me your word this stays between us."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvSom93l2WQ"}
