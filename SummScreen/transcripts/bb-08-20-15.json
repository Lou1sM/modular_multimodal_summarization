        "Liam tells Steffy that she may feel responsible but he knows she is not a serial killer. Ivy tells Wyatt that she was just blowing off steam about Liam. She does not want him back. She is not that big a fool. She told Liam to go see Steffy and get the real story from her. Wyatt says she will tell him. Ivy says no, she will lie. He disagrees as both of them know too much. If Steffy tells the truth Liam will go all moral on her and come sniffing around Ivy's door again .and saying he is sorry and still loves her. That is what always happens and he is not going to do that dance with him anymore. She swears she did not have an ulterior motive. She just wanted Liam to hear it directly from Steffy. Bill calls off lunch with Katie and she runs into Ridge who convinces her to sit down with him. He says he is the boss and he is not slacking off. Thomas wants to tell Caroline something but is afraid she will have to keep it from Ridge. She says that is okay. She does not have to tell him every little conversation she has if it does not concern him. He laments that Steffy is being blackmailed for something she did not do. And Ivy has the video. Liam wonders out loud to Steffy why he is just now hearing all these details. How is it possible that Aly fell and hit her head and then died. Steffy admits that she hit at Aly blindly and did not know when she talked to the police if it connected or not. She thought she was telling the police the truth. But now Ivy says differently. And she has a video and is threatening to use it against her. No one can imagine how or why Ivy did that. She admits she has not seen it but Wyatt says it looks really bad. He wonders why Wyatt is even involved in this and she explains Ivy asked him not to delete it. Liam says Wyatt has to be behind this as Ivy would not be using leverage like this. Steffy says she definitely will not sit still and let Ivy blackmail her. Liam tells her to trust him. He will find a way to see the video. Ridge confides that he is still working that delicate balance of trying to support Thomas and encouraging him in his designs too. They have been through some rough patches but the good news he did not inherit his own father's paranoia in thinking that his oldest son is gonna steal something from him. Katie says Thomas is probably just trying to protect his sister whose nerves of steel must be rattled about now. Katie gets around to asking about Caroline. Ridge confides she has problems still with her legs and he is afraid she has lost some strength and is afraid of bumping into things or falling. Katie says if he thinks his son and Caroline are whispering behind his back it is probably just this, about her health.",
        "Liam charges into Wyatt's house while he and Ivy are canoodling on the couch. Wyatt chastises him for not practicing his own proponent of knocking first. Liam apologizes but says it is kind of hard when no one will tell you what you want to know. Wyatt jokes that they should have picked out a card in the \"I'm dating your brother\" in the greeting card section. Liam assures them that both deserve to be happy and they should do just that ..except for crime. Perhaps they will stay just this side of criminal. That video could be blackmail and he demands to see it. He accuses Ivy of her silence being worth her being the new face of FC. Ivy laments she would not be at FC long if it were up to Steffy. She came back to town, took her boyfriend and makes herself their boss. She has everything now. Aly is dead so why is Liam defending Steffy? Liam reminds her if this is justice for Aly, this is not the way to do it. He looks at the video and says he needs to be convinced. Ivy says he may call that self defense; she calls it murder."

        "Steffy: Was I responsible?",
        "Liam: You know what I mean.",
        "Steffy: I don't know how to answer that question.",
        "Liam: Well, Steffy, I know you're not a serial killer.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] So, would Aly be dead if I hadn't been on the side of the road with her? Probably not. But am I responsible? Aly attacked me. She put a nail in my tire. I mean, is she responsible? I don't even know how to answer this question.",
        "Liam: I think it's a simple question with a simple answer, and I think you know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: All right. What did I say?",
        "Wyatt: Well, more than you meant to, I guess.",
        "Ivy: I was just blowing off some steam about Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but the subtitle said that you want him back.",
        "Ivy: Do you really think I'm that much of a fool -- again?",
        "Wyatt: You told him to go ask Steffy about what happened with Aly that night. She's gonna tell him.",
        "Ivy: No. She's gonna lie.",
        "Wyatt: No. She can't, because you and I know too much.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Now she's gonna go telling the truth, and then he's gonna get all moral and horrified and then go, \"I need some space,\" and then he's gonna knock on your door and say, \"you know what? I'm so sorry. I love you. I should have listened. Ohh.\" And then this is gonna be over. You want to know why? Because that always happens. And I'm not doing that dance with him again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Have you talked to your dad about this -- about whatever's going on between you and Steffy? Didn't think so.",
        "Thomas: I can't.",
        "Caroline: Why?",
        "Thomas: He doesn't listen.",
        "Caroline: To you?",
        "Thomas: To most people. Look, I don't expect you to agree, but what he really likes to do is make a decision and take over.",
        "Caroline: And that approach would be what?",
        "Thomas: Disaster. And since I can't talk to him...",
        "Caroline: You can't talk to me. What makes you so sure?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: I was just concerned that with four news stores --",
        "Ridge: Don't be. We'll goose production, and we'll fill your racks.",
        "Woman: Thank you, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Bye.",
        "Katie: Master at work.",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Ridge: Master of what?",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't know \u0096 um, charm, seduction. I'm not sure there's a word for it.",
        "Ridge: Hmm. I always wanted to know.",
        "Katie: I'm not sure there's a nice word for it.",
        "Ridge: You're, uh, meeting Bill for lunch?",
        "Katie: Uh, I was, but he just texted me -- \"can't make it.\"",
        "Ridge: That's it?",
        "Katie: Oh, no. He -- he also wrote \"sad face.\"",
        "Ridge: He wrote \"sad face\"?",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: Oh, what a tool. Come. Sit. Let's get you some lunch.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no. You -- you've already eaten. I-I'm fine.",
        "Ridge: I don't get to see you without Bill. Please.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] You don't think someone at the office is going to accuse you of slacking off?",
        "Ridge: Nope. I'm the boss. I do the accusing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I don't trust people.",
        "Caroline: You don't think that you can open up to me?",
        "Thomas: See, trusting you means asking you to keep something from my dad.",
        "Caroline: Which -- you're right -- I-I won't do.",
        "Thomas: So...",
        "Caroline: So...? I don't have to tell Ridge every conversation I have, especially if it doesn't concern him. So... why don't you try telling me what the Hell is going on and if I hear something that I don't think that I should... then I'll stop you?",
        "Thomas: It isn't about Steffy and me. It's about her and Ivy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Wyatt... you're wrong, okay?",
        "Wyatt: No. I am never wrong. I inherited that from my mother.",
        "Ivy: I'm sorry. I, I, honestly, I swear, I didn't have an ulterior motive when I said to Liam, \"go to Steffy with your question.\" I just wanted him to hear her answer it for himself. Okay?",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles softly]",
        "Wyatt: I just think the fewer the people know about this video, the better. Private things get out, and they assume a life of their own. Look what happened to Maya. Okay, that was all my fault.",
        "Ivy: You're kind of sexy when you're like this.",
        "Wyatt: You -- don't even. That -- you're saying that just so I don't stay angry.",
        "Ivy: Mm...hmm.",
        "Wyatt: And it's working.",
        "Ivy: Yay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Yes. There's more.",
        "Liam: More than what you told me?",
        "Steffy: About what happened to Aly? Yes.",
        "Liam: Okay. Let me ask a different question. Did you cause Aly's death?",
        "Steffy: Is that what Ivy said?",
        "Liam: That's what she implied, yeah.",
        "Steffy: Not the way she thinks. [Voice breaking] But yes. I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Are you sure you don't want to have dessert or something? I feel weird eating without you eating anything.",
        "Ridge: No. No. Watching you eat is -- is pretty entertaining. It takes you an hour to eat a salad. It's very suspenseful.",
        "Katie: Whenever you have to get back, I understand.",
        "Ridge: I don't -- why do you try to shoo me away? I don't get to see you without...",
        "Katie: The ball and chain?",
        "Ridge: ...Bill and chain.",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Ridge: How's Will?",
        "Katie: Oh, he's so good. He's 2 1/2 and a terror, but he's great. How 'bout you? You're in the dad zone these days with Steffy and Thomas working their way up the corporate ladder.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. They used to say, \"hey, you're not the boss of me,\" and now look at me. I am the boss.",
        "Katie: Right? Have they formed a secret alliance to defeat you yet? I was just kidding about that.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. But they do have something secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I mean, she's my sister. We have the same history together. We were kids, teenagers, together. We had the same advantages and frustrations... the same losses. You know, we could pass each other in the hall and say 10 words to each other, and I would know exactly what she's going through, what her day was like... whether she's heading for a crash-landing or going to the club at the end of the day. Now it's -- it's all changed. It's -- it's -- it's like I-I don't even know her anymore. You know, I-I don't know what she's gonna do or say or who she's gonna say it to. You know, I have no idea what it's like to have killed someone.",
        "Caroline: Wait. No one thinks that that's what happened to Aly.",
        "Thomas: I can stop. But remember, this stays between us.",
        "Caroline: No. I-I think you should -- I think you should go on.",
        "Thomas: My sister's being blackmailed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Can we just be normal, please?",
        "Wyatt: What, and give up our special superpowers?",
        "Ivy: I just mean talk about something else, anything else.",
        "Wyatt: Sure. Sure. Yeah. I mean, you've got a lot pinned on this maneuver, though. Will you be the face of Forrester? Will Liam reject Steffy? Will we lose our jobs? I don't know, but maybe we should talk about Beyonc\u00e9 or something, right? I don't know.",
        "Ivy: Hey, do you -- do you think I have a split personality?",
        "Wyatt: Who doesn't in this God-forsaken town?",
        "Ivy: Well, it's just, you know, when I first came here, I was -- I was a good girl, and everybody would tell me that. They'd say, \"you're a good girl.\"",
        "Wyatt: Right, but you took over my mom's position at Forrester. You're good by default. Trust me.",
        "Ivy: Mm. Well, apparently not that good. I mean, I still tricked Liam into marrying me.",
        "Wyatt: What are you talking about? That's Liam's favorite way to get married.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] And now look -- I'm in this high-stakes move with Steffy. I mean, how did I even get here?",
        "Wyatt: Your best friend died. It...changes things, I guess.",
        "Ivy: But I didn't die. So why do I feel so different?",
        "Wyatt: I like you just the way you are now.",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Even up close and personal, like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Are we back to you shutting me out when the going gets tough?",
        "Steffy: This wasn't that.",
        "Liam: Okay. Then why am I just hearing about it now, Steffy?",
        "Steffy: Okay, okay. How do I explain this? How do I explain this? Okay. You know when you're walking past a doorway and you hear people talking but you don't know what they're saying? It's almost like you hear it later. Something just clicks.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Well... that's what happened with the police. Something just stopped. Everything stopped. My cousin's life stopped. I was just screaming inside of me, \"how is this possible?!\" When the police were asking me all these questions.",
        "Liam: How is this -- how is it possible that Aly fell and hit her head? What?",
        "Steffy: Aly fell because I hit her.",
        "Liam: Okay. Well, I already knew that there was a struggle.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, you knew that there was a struggle. Okay, so... what I told you is that... I was changing my tire and Aly tried to hit me with her car and then we got in this argument and I thought she calmed down and then she just -- I don't know. She just tried to attack me. She picked up a tire iron, and she was gonna swing it, and, somehow, I-I knocked it out of her hand, and it fell, and -- and I fell with it. And when I looked up, she had this rock, and she was gonna smash it on top of me, so I picked up -- I picked up the tire iron, and I just -- I swung it. I swung it blindly. I didn't even know if -- if -- if it connected. So, when the police were asking me all these questions, I really thought I-I was telling them the truth.",
        "Liam: That it was self-defense?",
        "Steffy: Yes.",
        "Liam: And it was.",
        "Steffy: Yes!",
        "Liam: Okay. Then nothing's changed.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Um... Ivy.",
        "Liam: Well, Ivy was there. Why would she think any different?",
        "Steffy: She saw it... and she blames me.",
        "Liam: Okay. Well... you know, they were really close, and Ivy's hurting, and I'm sure it stings to be accused like this, but it can't touch you, Steffy. It's your word versus hers.",
        "Steffy: No. Ivy has a video, and she's threatening to use it against me.",
        "Liam: Video how?",
        "Steffy: She shot it from her phone.",
        "Liam: Well, how the Hell does that work?! She sees Aly trying to kill you and she goes, \"oh, let me take out my phone!\"?",
        "Steffy: Exactly! I keep asking myself the same question.",
        "Liam: Okay. Well, fine, but how is the video gonna show anything other than what you just told me?",
        "Steffy: I didn't see it. But Wyatt says it's bad.",
        "Liam: Bad for you? Why is he even involved in this?",
        "Steffy: Because of Ivy. I asked Wyatt to delete the video, but Ivy convinced him not to.",
        "Liam: Wyatt's got to be behind this, because Ivy doesn't just go around using leverage to get whatever she wants.",
        "Steffy: I wouldn't be too sure about that.",
        "Liam: Steffy, I think I know her.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Don't be too sure about that, either. I'm not gonna let her blackmail me. I hate that Aly's gone. But I was defending myself.",
        "Liam: Okay. All right. Well, before you take any big stand about this, we have to see that video.",
        "Steffy: I don't know if I can see it.",
        "Liam: Steffy, do you trust me?",
        "Steffy: We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't.",
        "Liam: Let me handle it. I'll see you back at the house.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Well, you have no reason to believe that they would be upset with you about something?",
        "Ridge: Oh, I'm sure Thomas is, 'cause I'm -- I'm still working on that delicate balance, trying to support him and encourage him to do better.",
        "Katie: As a designer?",
        "Ridge: As a designer and as my son.",
        "Katie: Yeah. You two have been through some rough patches.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. The good news is I didn't inherit my father's paranoia, thinking that my eldest son is gonna steal something from me.",
        "Katie: I think you're too hard on Eric.",
        "Ridge: I get that a lot. I didn't inherit his lovability, either.",
        "Katie: Could it be that Thomas is just trying to protect his sister? I mean... even Steffy's famous nerves of steel had to be rattled after what happened with Aly. Have you just asked them what's going on? No. Of course you haven't, because you think that parents should be mind-readers.",
        "Ridge: There you go.",
        "Katie: Can you read my mind?",
        "Ridge: Thyme. You want to know what's in the salad. It's thyme.",
        "Katie: You're good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: There's video proof?",
        "Thomas: Well, it's not proof. It only looks like proof. It doesn't show everything.",
        "Caroline: Everything that Steffy told you.",
        "Thomas: Everything Steffy told me is what happened.",
        "Caroline: I-I am not saying that I doubt her.",
        "Thomas: Ivy does.",
        "Caroline: Well, maybe that's sincere.",
        "Thomas: It is.",
        "Caroline: But wait. Ivy is the one who has the video.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, and that's the problem.*",
        "Wyatt: Why not?",
        "Ivy: Oh, gosh.",
        "Wyatt: What? What's wrong?",
        "Ivy: Nothing.",
        "Wyatt: Why?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, great. Aren't you the world's foremost proponent of knocking?",
        "Liam: [Clears throat] Well, it's a way to find out things nobody will tell you, I guess.",
        "Ivy: Oh, I'm sorry. I-I didn't realize we had to send you a memo.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, maybe we should have got him something from the \"I'm dating your brother\" part of the greeting-card section.",
        "Liam: Just so you know... I think you both deserve to be happy, and I think you should do whatever you can to make that possible.",
        "Wyatt: Well... that's big of you.",
        "Liam: Except for crime. You think you could do me a favor and stay just this side of the criminal?",
        "Wyatt: What are you talking about?",
        "Liam: I'm talking about stealing somebody's sense of safety. Guys, I'm talking about keeping them in fear so that you can control them and take advantage of them, because that is called \"blackmail.\" I want to see the video.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thank you. So, how's Caroline?",
        "Ridge: Oh. Here it comes. Is that a good topic for us?",
        "Katie: Well, we've talked about Brooke and Bill, so... sure. Why not?",
        "Ridge: She is... she's wonderful. She makes me happy. And I'm a little worried about her legs, you know. She's lost some strength in them, and I'm just concerned about her bumping in to stuff or falling.",
        "Katie: So, let me just throw this out there. I mean, if you think that your son and your daughter are whispering about something behind your back, could it be about her?",
        "Ridge: No. They're not whispering. I-I can hear them loud and clear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: So now you see why I can't go to my father. Caroline?",
        "Caroline: I know. I -- [Sighs] I know. I got myself into this.",
        "Thomas: What -- what good would it do? All right, if he asked Steffy to go back to the police, the video comes out, Ivy has to change her statement, too. I mean, what's the point? Nothing's changed. It's still self-defense.",
        "Caroline: But it doesn't look that way on the video?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Liam?! Liam! [Sighs]",
        "[Steffy's flashback]",
        "Steffy: No!",
        "Aly: [Grunting]",
        "[Present time]",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: So, you decided the price of silence is to be the new face of Forrester?",
        "Ivy: Ohh. Liam, how long do you think I was gonna have a job at Forrester if it was up to Steffy? She comes back into town, she takes my boyfriend, and then she makes herself my boss. She literally has everything. She has everything. So, why do you defend her so much when Aly's the one who's dead?",
        "Liam: So, this is about justice for Aly? I don't think that's the way to get it.",
        "Wyatt: Really? And what would be, huh? She could easily tell you the full truth, but you ever wonder why she hasn't?",
        "Liam: It was self-defense, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: And yet the only actual witness says that it wasn't.",
        "Ivy: Which I didn't tell the police, just so you know. Seeing Steffy hauled off in handcuffs on the evening news would cripple Forrester. I'm aware of that, and I'm trying to stop that if I can.",
        "Wyatt: Look, Steffy's got a company to run, plus she's got to be in every garment design and every jewelry design that we make on every cover of the magazines. I mean, is it so wrong that we just suggested to sit down for a second? Is that blackmail, really?",
        "Liam: Fine! Convince me it wasn't self-defense, then.",
        "Ivy: Watch it.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: Would you call that \"self-defense,\" Liam? I call it \"murder.\""
