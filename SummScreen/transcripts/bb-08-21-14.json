        "Hope and Wyatt come back a married couple. She hugs Brooke who tells Wyatt to call her Mom now, buster. Bill tells Liam that they are back and the party will be today and he expects him to be there. Liam says really, he doesn't think so. Bill says yes he is going to be there. He can pull this off, start it today and not a word to Hope about him being in Paris. Katie and Ridge discuss the day and she says Brooke does not know the entire story and he should tell her but meanwhile she does know what Bill did to Ridge and should stay away from him. He makes her promise to keep his secret about not drawing to herself. Quinn tells Deacon that today is the day that Brooke finds out that Ridge can not draw because of Bill. It will be a win/win for them, the good guys. It will be at the party and she is not going to drop the bomb; it will be Deacon. Brooke will be grateful. Brooke tells Hope that she thinks she better tell her; Liam will be at the party today. Bill lays down the law and tells Liam that he will be at the party. Liam is not even sure that Hope and Wyatt will want him there so Bill should check with them first.",
        "Quinn is the first one at the party surprising Brooke. She says she always knew this would happen and she can't wait for the next chapter in their lives. Katie is glad Ridge is getting dressed and he will go to the party to celebrate Hope and Wyatt. Bill calls Wyatt who is not sure Liam should be there, but Bill turns to Liam and says they want him there. He points out again that Hope is now married to his brother. So he needs to man up and accept it. Deacon joins the party and is introduced all around even to Quinn. Alone she tells him to be kind to Bill but drop the bomb about Ridge to Brooke nonetheless. Wyatt tells Hope they better not keep everyone waiting. He only wanted one thing in his life and now it is coming true and he is really, really lucky. Bill literally pushes Liam inside the door at Brooke's. He says he is having a barrel of laughs. He spies Quinn who walks toward him and greets them. She tells Liam that she is a changed woman which he finds hard to believe \u0096 the woman who tried to kill him. As father of the groom, Bill offers the first toast while Liam hangs his head as Hope kisses Wyatt, and Wyatt hugs Bill. Then Bill calls upon Liam that he should toast the new bride. Liam looks like he could spit nails."

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: It's pathetic.",
        "Quinn: It's tragic, if you're Ridge.",
        "Deacon: It's, uh, a little late in the game to change careers, don't you think?",
        "Wyatt: If ever a man was motivated to hate.",
        "Deacon: He's there. Listen, you heard him at the restaurant.",
        "Quinn: One of the world's greatest designers reduced to this.",
        "Deacon: All because Billy boy decided to drop him out of a chopper.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Nobody knows about it except for Katie. And us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I can't --",
        "Bill: You're going to the party.",
        "Liam: Why, though? Hope and Wyatt obviously wouldn't want me there.",
        "Bill: Yeah, in this mood you're in, you're right. But you're gonna change it.",
        "Liam: I don't know if I can pull this off, Dad. I really don't. I mean, seeing those two together --",
        "Bill: Liam.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Bill: Son, they're married. You're gonna be seeing them together a lot, and you're gonna have to learn to deal with it. Why not start today, huh? And listen to me. Not a word to Hope about your being in Paris.",
        "Liam: Wh-- that's --",
        "Bill: Ah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So, you guys got the text about the party?",

        "Brooke: Ivy, Aly, Donna, Katie, Rick.",
        "Hope: Okay. What about Deacon?",
        "Brooke: I'm sure he'll show up.",
        "Hope: Yeah? And Ridge, is he coming?",
        "Brooke: Ridge is still recovering. Water?",
        "Hope: Sure. Uh, okay, I just -- you know, I know that Ridge was at the office before we left for Paris. I thought he was okay.",
        "Brooke: Well, honey, if you want him to be there, just give him a call.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I can do that. But I don't think I'll have to. I think he'll show.",
        "Brooke: Oh, look at you two.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Married. I can't believe this.",
        "Wyatt: I know. We really wish you could have been there.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: I wish I could have been there, too. This is the day that I've been thinking about for a very long time.",
        "Hope: Aw. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I imagine Spencer's gonna be there.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, he is the father of the groom, so probably.",
        "Ridge: And now he's a distant member of the family.",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: Well, not so distant if he marries Brooke, I guess.",
        "Katie: Listen, she knows what he did to you. And even though she doesn't know the whole story, she has to be done with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: If Brooke knew about this...",
        "Deacon: She'd never marry Spencer.",
        "Quinn: Well, from what we heard, Katie wants Ridge to tell her.",
        "Deacon: That's not gonna -- that's not gonna happen. I mean, look, if word about this gets out, Ridge is as good as washed up.",
        "Quinn: Then we have to do something about it. That is, if you still want Brooke.",
        "Deacon: And you want Spencer.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] It's a win/win for the good guys. Today is the day, Deacon. Brooke finds out that Ridge lost his talent because of Bill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Listen, I know that Brooke still loves Bill, but...",
        "Ridge: She knows what he did to me.",
        "Katie: Well, she doesn't know everything. I mean, if she did, then she certainly wouldn't marry Bill. So maybe we should tell her.",
        "Ridge: If Brooke knows, everyone knows.",
        "Katie: It's temporary. It'll come back.",
        "Ridge: My talent is gone. Until it comes back, we got to keep this between us.",
        "Katie: I want Bill to pay for what he did.",
        "Ridge: And he will. But until then, we'll keep this between us. Promise me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Can't stop staring at that thing, can you?",
        "Quinn: It holds my future. And yours with Brooke.",
        "Deacon: What's the plan?",
        "Quinn: Well, we show up at the party. Separately, of course, because nobody but Wyatt knows that you're staying here with me. And then at the opportune moment, Brooke learns the truth, that the man she's loved most of her life, the man with whom she shares a child, is an empty shell because of Bill.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, he's gonna hate you when you drop this bomb.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] No, Deacon, I'm not dropping the bomb. You are.",
        "Deacon: What?",
        "Quinn: Uh, when you told Brooke about Abu Dhabi, she was grateful, right?",
        "Deacon: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: Well, she's gonna be even more grateful when you lay this sucker in her lap.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Are you ready?",
        "Aly: How do I do it, Ivy? Congratulate Hope and Wyatt on a marriage that never should have happened?",
        "Ivy: We show some class.",
        "Aly: That might be easy for you.",
        "Ivy: No, trust me, it won't be. I think Liam and Hope, they should be together.",
        "Aly: He is such a gentleman, the way he saved you.",
        "Ivy: And the price he paid for it?",
        "Aly: Liam was there for her in Paris. He has to tell her that today at the party.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Are you upset your mom's not gonna be here for the party since she's still in therapy?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, actually, she's out.",
        "Brooke: What? When?",
        "Wyatt: Recently.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. Wyatt says that she's doing a lot better.",
        "Brooke: Oh. [Chuckles] That's wonderful.",
        "Hope: We're gonna go freshen up.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Oh, honey, wait. Uh... I think you should know. Liam's gonna probably show up today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Dad, I really -- I really don't need this right now.",
        "Bill: Yes, you do.",
        "Liam: Listen, if I had shown up in Paris like I said I would, Hope and I would be having this party right now.",
        "Bill: Didn't work out that way. Now you have to put it behind you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, it'd be a lot easier to do that if I didn't have to show my face at Brooke's house!",
        "Bill: Family gathering, your family. I'm laying down the law, Liam.",
        "Liam: Oh -- call them.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Liam: I'm telling you, call them. If Hope and Wyatt truly want me to be there, hand to God, I'll show up. Just give them a call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Quinn: Mmm! It smells good in here!",
        "Brooke: Quinn!",
        "Quinn: The first to arrive, last to leave. I love a party. And this is something to celebrate.",
        "Brooke: The marriage of our children.",
        "Quinn: I always knew it would happen. Everything turned out as it should.",
        "Brooke: I suppose.",
        "Quinn: Go ahead. You can ask. My therapy?",
        "Brooke: You seem well.",
        "Quinn: Never better. I've never felt more alive. Ready for life's next challenge.",
        "Brooke: And what might that be?",
        "Quinn: Oh, who knows what the future has in store. It does have a way of surprising us.",
        "Brooke: Sometimes it's a good idea to plan.",
        "Quinn: Is that what you're doing?",
        "Brooke: It's what I was doing in Abu Dhabi.",
        "Quinn: Again, Brooke, I am so sorry for my part in that.",
        "Brooke: No, no. [Sighs] I'm just trying to put it behind me.",
        "Quinn: I have to say that, um, I did find one thing very impressive.",
        "Brooke: What's that?",
        "Quinn: Ridge's loyalty to you. You're truly blessed. I hope you know that.",
        "Brooke: Ridge is a true friend.",
        "Quinn: Indeed he is. Will he and Katie be here today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Good. You're dressed.",
        "Ridge: Well, I didn't want to disappoint Hope, plus there really isn't that much to do for me around here, so...",
        "Katie: Give it time.",
        "Ridge: Time. I have a lot of that these days.",
        "Katie: Let's go celebrate Hope and Wyatt.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Another wedding. And one more to come. You keep me away from Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Hey, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Dad.",
        "Bill: Congratulations. And welcome home.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Bill: Where are you?",
        "Wyatt: Um... I'm in my wife's bedroom. Hey, is -- is, uh, is Liam coming?",
        "Bill: He's your brother.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, it might not be a good idea. We don't want a scene. You know what I mean?",
        "Bill: Oh, I'll take care of that. I'll see you soon.",
        "Liam: What'd he say?",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah. He wants you there.",
        "Liam: What?! What -- how?! Come on!",
        "Bill: Liam, come on. You got to see him sooner or later. Why do you want to prolong it?",
        "Liam: Why prolong the -- because that's what it is, Dad. It's agony seeing those two together!",
        "Bill: You're being too -- too dramatic, all right? You're gonna go there, you'll congratulate Wyatt, you'll congratulate Hope, and then you can leave. It won't be as bad as you think.",
        "Liam: Dad, do you have any idea how much I loved this girl?",
        "Bill: Yes. And I'm glad to hear you using past tense. Hope is your brother's wife. And you have to man up and accept it.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Wyatt and Hope are upstairs getting ready for the party. So, is Oliver coming?",
        "Aly: Oh, yeah, he'll be here. He had a few things to wrap up.",
        "Brooke: Oh, good. And, Ivy, did you bring somebody?",
        "Ivy: Well, I asked Ryan Gosling, but he said no.",
        "Brooke: Oh.",
        "Aly: Really?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] I haven't really had time to sort out the L.A. boyfriend thing yet.",
        "Brooke: Well, we're gonna have to do something about that. Um, girls, have you met Wyatt's mother yet?",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "Aly: I have.",
        "Brooke: Quinn Fuller, this is Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Hi. Nice to meet you.",
        "Quinn: Nice to meet you, too.",
        "Brooke: Ivy works --",
        "Quinn: Oh, yes, I know. She replaced me at Forrester.",
        "Ivy: I have always admired your work.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. And where might I have seen yours?",
        "Ivy: Well, on the Forrester Sydney website.",
        "Quinn: Oh! Australia.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Deacon: Well, well, well. Let the party begin.",

        "Ivy: Ivy Forrester.",
        "Deacon: Nice to meet you.",
        "Brooke: And you know Quinn?",
        "Deacon: Quinn, nice to meet you. You're a very lucky lady, you know that? Your -- your son marrying my daughter.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Brooke: Oh, uh, girls, come with me. I need you to help me with something.",
        "Ivy: Oh, okay.",
        "Quinn: Really?",
        "Deacon: Hmm?",
        "Quinn: Really? Are you -- are you done with the stand-up routine? Because you got a job to do.",
        "Deacon: Take it easy, all right? I know. Relax.",
        "Quinn: Do you?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. I'll drop the bomb on Brooke and tell her that Ridge can't draw. Happy?",
        "Quinn: Because of Bill.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, okay, I got it. Try breathing, you know? Ohm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Presentable?",
        "Hope: Oh, very. And moi?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I mean... you'll pass.",
        "Hope: I'll pass? What?! Well, so much for the honeymoon!",
        "Wyatt: No, I'm just -- I'm practicing.",
        "Hope: For what?",
        "Wyatt: The boredom of marriage.",
        "Hope: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: The onset of middle age, the years and years of marital bliss.",
        "Hope: Oh, God.",
        "Wyatt: I can't wait.",
        "Hope: It sounds so exciting.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs]",
        "Hope: Oh, so... do you think he's gonna come?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, Liam?",
        "Hope: Yeah, I mean, probably not, right?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] [Chuckles] I think he just wanted a clean break, Hope.",
        "Hope: Yeah. I think so, too. I mean, that has to be why he didn't show up in -- in Paris, so...",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Well, are you ready for our grand entrance? Because we can't keep these people waiting any more.",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Wyatt: It's just...unreal. Us here, you know. I had one wish in my life, and it came true. That doesn't happen for me all that often, so I just... I'm either lucky or... really, really lucky.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",

        "Rick: That's true.",
        "Brooke: I want you guys just to relax, have fun, enjoy, have some champagne. I'll see you in a minute.",

        "Liam: You're a changed woman? Changed from the woman who tried to kill me? Really? I hope so.",
        "Quinn: You know what? Can we just put that aside at least for today? It's your brother's very special day.",
