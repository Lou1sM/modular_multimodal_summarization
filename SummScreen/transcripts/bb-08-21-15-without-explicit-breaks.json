    "Recap": [
        "Ivy tells Liam that he has seen it for himself. He has seen the video and it was murder. Steffy can cry self defense all she wants, but Aly was just standing there doing nothing and Steffy tried to kill her. She tried to kill her and doesn't even care. Liam disagrees. Caroline is aghast that Thomas is saying the night was videoed by Ivy and the interpretation is open for discussion. But he is not going to let his sister get railroaded for something she did not do intentionally. There was a tire iron and Steffy used that in her defense. Also a rock was involved and Aly fell and hit her head on. And isn't it rich that Ivy now wants to be the new face of FC. Thomas warns Caroline to keep this to herself, but especially not to tell his father. And Steffy is not the only woman he is worried about. There is Caroline too because she is with his father. He's not cynic but has had a front row seat most of his life with the way his father operates around women. Katie tells Ridge that she is not surprised that he wants Caroline. She is young and beautiful and certainly in love with him. But she knows she wants children so how is Ridge going to be with that. He says they are just now starting their life together and maybe she will not want to give up all of that to start a family. Katie is not sure she will outgrow that desire. Thomas tells Caroline that he confided in her, now she can return the favor. Is she completely happy with his dad. She tries to skirt around it but he pushes and he finally asks if she wants to start a family and perhaps his dad doesn't. He hates to see his dad put her on the spot. He is sure his dad does not want another family and he does not want to see her being hurt because of that. Ivy tells Wyatt that she is glad that Liam has now seen the video as now maybe he will see Steffy in a brand new light. She knows Steffy committed murder and Steffy knows it. She does not think there is any way that Liam can condone what he saw. It is criminal and Steffy should feel responsible.",
        "Steffy is on eggshells until Liam comes in. She is glad he saw the video and it will show her defending herself. He doesn't speak for a minute but then says it is really bad. Steffy goes over the details again. He tells her there is no rock shown. With just the tire iron it looks bad. She does not know how that could be. Liam says she needs to rethink this and tell everyone what really happened. Wyatt and Ivy lay in bed, Liam and Steffy do the same. He says Wyatt and Ivy are not objective and they are just lashing out, but they have the video now to contend with. Steffy says she is so appreciative that Liam believes her. She realizes Ivy could hurt her in trying to get justice for Aly. He says he will not let Ivy get back at her because she is mad at Steffy. This is a very serious matter. He believes her and will not leave her. He laments that no matter what it takes he needs to make sure no one sees that video. Wyatt jokingly tells Ivy to put that phone down. They are not going to concentrate on that now."

        "Ivy: Now you've seen it with your own eyes. Steffy hit Aly. It was murder, Liam.",
        "Liam: That's not true. It was -- it was self-defense.",
        "Ivy: Self-defense against what? Aly was just standing there, doing nothing. What, do I have to play you the video again?",
        "Liam: Yes. Please.",
        "Ivy: Look, just -- [Scoffs] Steffy can claim self-defense all she wants, but this video shows exactly what happened. Steffy killed Aly, Liam, and she doesn't even care.",
        "Steffy: [Gasps] [Gasps] [Breathing heavily]",
        "Caroline: Okay. I have a lot of questions, um, because I-I thought that Aly died because she fell and hit her head.",
        "Thomas: True.",
        "Caroline: But you just said that Steffy hit her with a tire iron.",
        "Thomas: In self-defense.",
        "Caroline: Okay. And now Ivy recorded it, and -- and so... [Sighs] Okay, I don't know. I guess that's good, because the whole confrontation is on video, so...",
        "Thomas: Video doesn't always show the whole story.",
        "Caroline: What do you mean?",
        "Thomas: It's unclear. It's subject to interpretation. That's not true. It's incredibly damning.",
        "Caroline: Like what? Like -- like...Steffy deliberately killed Aly and -- and now Ivy is holding this video over Steffy's head?",
        "Thomas: You know Ivy's sudden interest to become the new face of Forrester?",
        "Caroline: Wow.",
        "Thomas: You can't tell any of this, especially not to my father.",
        "Caroline: I -- ridge is gonna want to know if Steffy's in some kind of trouble, and he's gonna want to be there for her.",
        "Thomas: I'll protect my sister, all right? I'm not gonna let her get railroaded into paying for something she didn't do. But [Sighs] Caroline, she's not the only woman I'm concerned about. I'm worried about you, too.",
        "Caroline: Why?",
        "Thomas: Because you're involved with my father.",
        "Katie: You know, I actually have been thinking about you a lot lately -- how different your life is.",
        "Ridge: It is different. I'm firing on all cylinders, and then I've got my young, oh, so young, Caroline to come home to.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Listen, I-I know that it's more than just that. It's not hard for me to understand why you would fall for her. She's beautiful, and she's wonderful. And she's very happy with you.",
        "Ridge: She told you that?",
        "Katie: She's also been pretty clear about the fact that she wants a family. So, how do you feel about that? Mm. No answer. I guess I know.",
        "Caroline: Ridge is very good to me.",
        "Thomas: Always is in the beginning.",
        "Caroline: You're such a cynic when it comes to him.",
        "Thomas: I know my father, his patterns. I had a front-row seat to it most of my life. He'll be going along, everything's so wonderful, and then, well, there'll be an issue.",
        "Caroline: Oh, and he'll just -- he'll just leave?",
        "Thomas: Maybe he'll only wish he did.",
        "Caroline: Ridge and I are very happy.",
        "Thomas: Is being with him everything you'd hoped for? Come on. I trusted you. Return the favor. Has he given you everything you want?",
        "Wyatt: Well, I think it's safe to say that that video rocked Liam's world. I mean, clearly, he's wondering why he's only hearing about it now.",
        "Ivy: Well, it's because Steffy's only about self-preservation.",
        "Wyatt: But why keep it from him? I mean, he's the protector of women. He's not gonna go to the cops and turn her in.",
        "Ivy: Well, it just proves that she isn't worthy of it.",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Ivy: That's what it does. She clearly doesn't trust him, which means she doesn't know him, because if she did know him, she'd know she'd be able to trust him.",
        "Wyatt: In other words, she doesn't know him like you do.",
        "Ivy: Ugh. Wyatt, that's over.",
        "Wyatt: What? I'm just saying -- I'm just checking. I don't know. I mean --",
        "Ivy: Look... this isn't about me, okay? It's about Steffy doing something so reprehensible, criminal, and then not accepting responsibility for it. Aly's dead, and it's like her life just meant nothing but Steffy's does. You know what? I'm actually -- I'm really happy that Liam's now seen that video, 'cause maybe he'll see Steffy in a brand-new light.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Steffy: Hi. Hi. How did it go? Did you see the video?",
        "Liam: I did.",
        "Steffy: Okay. It shows that I was defending myself... right? Why aren't you saying anything? Liam, you're starting to freak me out. What?",
        "Liam: It's bad, Steffy. It's really bad.",
        "Katie: You know, if I'm prying, just tell me and I'll stop, but... you know, Caroline has mentioned that she really wants to have children someday.",
        "Ridge: Well, you are prying. And Caroline's young. She's -- it's --",
        "Katie: So, you're hoping that she's just gonna grow out of it? Because in my experience, it doesn't really work that way.",
        "Ridge: She could maybe grow out of it. I don't mean \"grow out of it,\" but just we're just starting our life together, you know? We're gonna have some adventures -- travel and design and do things -- and maybe she doesn't want to give up all that right now.",
        "Katie: Why does she have to? I mean, as a woman, you don't have to be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. There are lots of options for working women.",
        "Ridge: Whose side are you on?",
        "Katie: I'm not on anyone's side. You know, when we were together, you said that you would be a father to will.",
        "Ridge: I meant it.",
        "Katie: And yet I'm sensing that you're not real anxious to start a family with Caroline, so... I'm just wondering why.",
        "Caroline: Who gets everything they want from anyone? Just even to think that that's possible is just asking for heartbreak.",
        "Thomas: Voice of experience?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I mean, look -- I learned a lot of things from my marriage to Rick, and, yes, that is -- that is one of them.",
        "Thomas: So, would you say that you're getting 99% of what you want? 'Cause that's the least of what you deserve.",
        "Caroline: Okay, fine. Th-there's one thing that we just aren't completely in sync on.",
        "Thomas: What's that?",
        "Caroline: I ca-- no, I can't. I can't talk to you about those kinds of things.",
        "Thomas: Well, let me make it easy for you. I'm guessing it has to do with starting a family or, more likely... not starting one.",
        "Ivy: Liam is so moral and upstanding, you know? It really makes me wonder how it's affecting him, seeing Steffy hitting Aly like that.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I'm still stuck and why she hasn't told him until now. I mean, what does that even say about their relationship -- that she can keep something this big from him?",
        "Ivy: No, no, no. It says that she's a self-serving liar, that's what.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Well, I guess there's that.",
        "Ivy: Steffy committed murder. I know it. She knows it. Now Liam knows it. How can he morally accept that?",
        "Wyatt: My brother's not a saint. You know that. What trumps morality every time is coming to the rescue or the defense of a woman that he loves.",
        "Ivy: There is no way Liam can condone what's on that video, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: That's what you're counting on.",
        "Steffy: I don't get it. The video looks bad? How bad?",
        "Liam: Like...hard to watch.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, of course it's hard to watch. It's awful. And I feel terrible about this.",
        "Liam: I know. I know you do. But...in the video, when you haul off with that tire iron --",
        "Steffy: Liam, it was self-defense! How many times do I have to tell you that?! Aly attacked me! She was trying to re-enact the same night her mother died. She picked up the tire iron, she swung it, and then she grabbed a rock.",
        "Liam: That's the thing. There's no rock.",
        "Steffy: What? What do you mean, there's no rock? Of course there's a rock. There was a rock in Aly's hand, and she was gonna crush it on my head.",
        "Liam: Not in the video.",
        "Steffy: How can that be?",
        "Liam: I don't know. I don't know. But that's what we have to figure out, okay? So, whether there was a rock or there was just a tire iron, it doesn't look good, Steffy, so... you got to take me through it one more time. What really happened that night?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Me not wanting to have a family has nothing to do with my feelings for Caroline. Just -- I just don't want to start over, you know?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I get it. But does Caroline?",
        "Ridge: I was honest with her.",
        "Katie: And...she was okay with that?",
        "Ridge: She said she was. I mean, I got to take her at her word.",
        "Katie: Sure. It's just that sometimes people say the things they think you want to hear.",
        "Ridge: I know that. I know. All I can do is be honest with her, you know? And I-I told her what she didn't want to hear -- that I didn't want to complicate our life. I just want to...have this time together and not share it with anybody and just...live every moment, enjoy every day.",
        "Caroline: Of course I want to have a family one day.",
        "Thomas: When? Next year? Five years from now?",
        "Caroline: I don't know. Whenever it feels right.",
        "Thomas: Do you think it's ever gonna feel right for my father?",
        "Caroline: Obviously you don't.",
        "Thomas: Have you mentioned it to him?",
        "Caroline: Yeah, we've talked about it.",
        "Thomas: And...?",
        "Caroline: And...ridge isn't ready.",
        "Thomas: Not ready or not interested? There's a difference.",
        "Caroline: Ridge just wants to live right now. I mean, he just wants to be in the moment.",
        "Thomas: Mm. Well, that sounds great for him. Where does that leave you?",
        "Wyatt: I kind of feel bad for Liam.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "Wyatt: I mean, I-I remember how shocked I was when I first saw that video.",
        "Ivy: Well, I don't.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: I don't feel badly for Liam. Why shouldn't he be aware of the kind of woman he's involved with?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Come on. He thinks Steffy walks on water. Well, guess what. She's far from it. She's a cold-blooded killer.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, don't you think that's just a little extreme, Ivy?",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, come on! You know what's on the video.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, I do.",
        "Ivy: She stole a life. She stole Aly's life. And her life just goes on, rewarded with no consequences. If you really want to feel badly about someone in this situation, think about Aly. She's gone. Okay, but I haven't forgotten.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy, okay. I-I know. I know. I know. Is this how we want to spend our night? Huh? Talking about other people?",
        "Ivy: Well, I'm guessing you have different ideas.",
        "Wyatt: Have I told you how sexy you are when you're angry?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] I'll show you sexy.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, yeah?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: What do you mean \"what really happened?\" You don't think I'm telling the truth?",
        "Liam: Come on. I'm not accusing you of anything. But I am a little confused.",
        "Steffy: I told you everything.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Yes. But you did say that it's coming back gradually. Right? It's coming back in pieces. So, I don't know, Steffy. Maybe if -- if you go over it one more time, then you'll remember something, some -- some detail that makes all the difference.",
        "Steffy: I don't want to do that. I don't want to relive it again. You don't -- you don't know.",
        "Liam: I know. I know. I know. But it's important. It's really important. Come on.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Okay. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Go ahead.",
        "Steffy: Okay, um... I was in my car. I was driving down PCH, And then, out of nowhere, I-I got a flat tire. So, I-I pulled over to change it. And then, out of nowhere, there were these headlights coming towards me. It was Aly. Aly was driving the car. So, we started to argue, and out of nowhere, she grabbed a tire iron, and -- and she tried to attack me with it.",
        "Liam: Now, when did she pick up the rock? Is that when she picked up the rock?",
        "Steffy: Yes. Yes, yes, that's when she -- yeah.",
        "Liam: And what hand was the rock in?",
        "Steffy: It was in her right hand. [Voice breaking] And she -- she had the -- she had the rock, and then she was gonna crush it on top of me, so I -- so I took the tire iron, and I swung it to protect myself. And then she fell, and she hit her head on a rock. [Breathing shakily] Look, I-I don't -- I don't have all the bits and pieces, okay? But...I would never, ever, ever, ever kill my cousin deliberately. [Crying] Look, if you don't -- if you don't want to be with me, I get it. I'm...",
        "Liam: What?! Are you kidding me? Steffy, I'm not going anywhere, okay? I know you, and you defend yourself when you feel threatened. It's instinctive.",
        "Steffy: Even after seeing the video, you believe me?",
        "Liam: Of course, I do.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. You have no idea how much that means to me.",
        "Liam: Come here.",
        "Steffy: You have no idea.",
        "Thomas: You and I weren't together long, but I got a sense of what drives you, your dreams, your ambition. You should have all of that, Caroline, instead of -- instead of dimming your light for my father.",
        "Caroline: Uh, that is not how it is at all.",
        "Thomas: Really? Because it seems like you're doing all the sacrificing while my father lives his moments. Ridge Forrester doesn't want a family. Because it's all about him. I-I'm not -- I'm not trying to upset you or put you on the spot. I just know my father. I don't want to see you hurt.",
        "Wyatt: I like this. I like you. Even if you are a million miles away right now.",
        "Ivy: No. No. How can you say that after what just happened?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you were definitely here for that.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: That -- that is for sure.",
        "Ivy: I'm sorry. I just -- I slipped away for a minute there.",
        "Wyatt: You're wondering what's happening with Steffy and Liam?",
        "Ivy: Well, my bet is it's nothing like this.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, yeah.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: It means so much that you believe me.",
        "Liam: Well -- [Chuckles] Well, what am I supposed to think? That you morphed into a cold-blooded killer one night? That's absurd, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: No matter what Ivy says?",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Ivy -- Ivy's not objective right now, and neither is Wyatt. They're -- they're lashing out at us for being with each other instead of them.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: But we do have this video now.",
        "Steffy: I should have told you everything as soon as I remembered. Ivy has the video now. And you're right. She can hurt me and get justice for Aly at the same time.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, I'm not gonna let that happen. I don't -- I don't care. I don't care what the video shows. I know that you're innocent. And I'm not gonna let Ivy use it as a tool to ruin your life just because she's mad. But we do have to be realistic. This is a, uh -- this is a very serious problem.",
        "Steffy: What are we gonna do?",
        "Liam: Whatever it takes. Whatever it takes to make sure nobody ever sees that video.",
        "Wyatt: Nope. No way. That is it. You lost your phone privileges. Give me the phone. Give me the phone.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt...",
        "Wyatt: Put it down. There you go. Isn't that so much better? So much lighter, you know?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. Lunch meeting?"
