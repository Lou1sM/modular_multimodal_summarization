        "Ridge is adamant that Thomas needs to be cleared. He was not involved in Emma's accident. The Sgt. says his office has added information that he was seen and it's unusual but Thomas has not bothered to explain. Ridge says his son has had some issues in the past but the Sgt. cannot call him a murderer. Brooke speaks up and says she is concerned with Thomas too since he has vanished and won't come forward. Under questioning Brooke admits they both are afraid Thomas could be dangerous. Yet Ridge claps back the Sgt. is only going on speculation. Sgt. Sanchez says if Thomas has done nothing wrong then they have nothing to worry about. So just call him when Thomas reappears. Brooke tells Ridge this is really strange behavior that Thomas does not get back to them. She needs to know that he is not going to be a threat to her daughter. Justin tells Hope and Liam that he will get the annulment papers started and done properly. He is sorry for what they went through but looks happily for what lays ahead. Liam tells Hope they have no idea how Thomas will react when he hears about the annulment papers. He will try to see her again. He will not give up without a fight; he is not a rational person. The minute he finds out she is ending the marriage could send him over the edge. Thomas is still on a quiet rampage. He needs to see Hope and explain to her. And it cannot be on the phone. He needs to see her in person. It's all Liam's fault. He is filling her head with a lot of lies and nonsense. But Hope is still his wife and that will never change. Vinny tries to get him to calm down and just work on calling Hope until she picks up her phone. Brooke tells Ridge that Thomas should have checked up on Douglas so that alone is strange. Ridge says he admits Thomas screwed up but he is trying to do something about that. Brooke says she knows Thomas and his lies and manipulations and she is very worried for her daughter's safety. No telling what he will do when he finds out that Hope regrets marrying him and is fixing that now .what he might do.",
        "Liam goes berserk when Hope says she is going to call Thomas and tell him it is over and about the annulment papers. Liam says that is Justin's job, not hers. She wants it to be over quickly. Thomas keeps on talking to himself that everything he has done, he has done for Hope and their family. They were happy and they will be again as soon as he explains. Brooke keeps harping to Ridge to try again and again to reach Thomas. She knows he will eventually pick up. Liam tries to take the phone from Hope but she insists. She is going to call Thomas. Thomas is ecstatic when her call comes through. He keeps calling her his wife and that he needs to see her. She cuts to the chase and says she only called to tell him she has seen a lawyer and is drawing up annulment papers. He tries to talk her out of it. She says no. She tells him to just go home and face his family. And he needs to see Douglas as he still thinks his dad is mad at him. And the last thing she tells him she does not want to speak to him again EVER! She hangs up on him. Moody Thomas stands and says they were married until death do they part."

        "Ridge: Emma barber's death was an accident, detective.",
        "Det. Sanchez: Well, as i explained, that's why we're taking another look at the case.",
        "Ridge: Why is that, because some former employee made a baseless accusation against my son?",
        "Det. Sanchez: It's hardly baseless. Mr. Avant gave my office pertinent information. Now, if you have information that contradicts his story and clears thomas then --",
        "Ridge: He doesn't need to be cleared! He's not involved this!",
        "Det. Sanchez: Okay, I'd like to hear that from thomas. But you said he's not here, right?",
        "Brooke: No. And he's not answering his phone.",
        "Det. Sanchez: Is that unusual? Mr. Forrester? Sir? Would you say that your son's behavior is unusual?",
        "Thomas: I will not lose you, hope. You're my wife. You belong with me.",
        "Hope: I want my marriage to thomas annulled right away.",
        "Liam: I mean, can you do that, even? Can you just file the paperwork, or does thomas have to be involved somehow?",
        "Justin: He has to be involved. He won't be able to challenge the annulment. Look, this is a clear case of fraud and misrepresentation.",
        "Hope: Thomas won't take that well. But I'm not going to let him control my life ever again.",
        "Justin: Well. I will get the annulment paperwork started right away.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, thank you. Thomas has caused hope enough pain already.",
        "Justin: Well, I am sorry for what you have been through, but I am really happy for what lies ahead.",
        "Hope: Me, too.",
        "Justin: I am glad I could help put this behind you so you can focus being a mommy to your beautiful little girl.",
        "Hope: Thank you so much.",
        "Justin: You're welcome, you're welcome.",
        "Liam: All right. Thanks for stopping by. All right, man.",
        "Justin: Certainly. All right.",
        "Liam: Hey, uh... do you think we should have asked justin about a restraining order?",
        "Hope: If thomas wanted to confront us, he would have done it already. He disappeared because he's ashamed, and he should be.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but he doesn't know about the annulment yet. Like, we don't know what he's gonna do when he finds out you're done with him.",
        "Det. Sanchez: I understand that thomas has a history of... instability.",
        "Ridge: What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Brooke: He hasn't responded to any of us. We don't know where he is or what he's doing.",
        "Ridge: [ Sighs ]",
        "Brooke: Ridge, if the detective thinks this is relevant --",
        "Ridge: It's not!",
        "Brooke: I'm worried about my daughter.",
        "Det. Sanchez: So you have concerns about thomas.",
        "Brooke: Well, yeah. I -- I do have some concerns, actually. I think that thomas can be... a little obsessive. And given the fact that he did know about beth, and then there's emma's death...",
        "Ridge: He has shown some very poor judgment, but no one is accusing him of murder.",
        "Brooke: What if xander is right? I know you don't want to consider this, but what if thomas is responsible for emma's death?",
        "Thomas: Come on, hope. Did you, uh, get a call?",
        "Thomas: No. Oh, I -- I thought I heard you.",
        "Thomas: All these texts are from my dad. Nothing from hope. Nothing. Not -- not one word. And, you know what, it's liam and it's brooke. They're trying to turn her against me. I let that happen... [ Chuckles ] I just -- I need to see her, you know, and -- and I just need to help her understand. So why don't you do that? Give her a call. She's got to be worried about you, right? How about I give you some privacy?",
        "Thomas: No, I -- I... I can't do this over the phone. I have to see her in person.",
        "Liam: I'm so sorry you're dealing with this right now.",
        "Hope: I just want to get it over with.",
        "Liam: [ Chuckles ] Trust me. As far as I'm concerned, you can't get the bastard out of your life soon enough.",
        "Hope: I should have never married him.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, you thought you were doing what was best for douglas. And, besides, you didn't know what thomas was capable of.",
        "Hope: No, I mean, you and mom tried to warn me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, we kind of did.",
        "Hope: [ Chuckles ]",
        "Liam: Listen. I hate what thomas did to you, I mean, using his son to manipulate you like that, but -- but even given his whole history, what all of us knew about it, nobody expected him to do something this twisted. I mean, to keep beth a secret and let you suffer, just for, what, so he could have you for himself? That is sick.",
        "Hope: I never want to see him again.",
        "Liam: [ Sighs ] Well, you definitely can't be alone with him again, that's for sure.",
        "Hope: No, liam, I mean it. I want him out of my life for good.",
        "Liam: Okay, yes, let justin handle the annulment, but you have to know he's gonna try to see you again, okay? He's not gonna give up without a fight.",
        "Hope: Yeah, well, he doesn't really have a choice, does he?",
        "Liam: Okay, this -- this is a perfect example. A rational person would understand that, but thomas is not a rational person. Look -- look at what he's done to us just so that he could hold onto you. I'm not trying to scare you, but the minute he finds out that you're annulling the marriage, that could send him over the edge.",
        "Thomas: I just -- I -- I have to see hope. I have to re-establish that connection face-to-face. Because then once she sees me, she'll see that I'm still the man that she married. I don't know, man. Maybe not like this. You're still kind of worked up.",
        "Thomas: I just need to explain everything, all right? I just need to explain it and show her all the great things that we were doing together, with the line and -- and the family that we were gonna have together. I was giving her a family with douglas and me, right and did liam ever do anything like that? No, no, no, no. He always has to hurt her, right? He has to poison everything. That's what he's doing. That's what happening right now, okay? He's -- he's confusing her. This is his fault. Okay, but -- but you're gonna fix it, yeah? When you calm down?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, she has to listen to me. Right. She's got to, man. She's your wife, right?",
        "Thomas: That's right. We made a commitment. Yeah, so what are you stressing about? Come on, you're usually \"mr. In control.\" Just breathe. It's all gonna work out. You got to believe that. Don't let this get to you.",
        "[ Inhales sharply ]",
        "Thomas: Hope is still my wife. That hasn't changed. That is never going to change.",
        "Det. Sanchez: You think thomas could be dangerous.",
        "Brooke: Ridge and I are both concerned about our children, detective sanchez. But if you have evidence that maybe thomas is responsible --",
        "Ridge: Well, he doesn'T.",
        "Det. Sanchez: He's a person of interest.",
        "Ridge: Based on what? Some office rumor? Something that he did years ago? You finished the investigation. Emma died because she was texting and driving. It's awful! But everything is speculation!",
        "Det. Sanchez: Yeah, well, thomas was seen arguing with emma the night she died.",
        "Ridge: People argue all the time! That doesn't mean they're gonna kill each other!",
        "Det. Sanchez: Well, previous investigators had no idea about the situation with hope and her baby.",
        "Ridge: Because it was a private family matter.",
        "Brooke: And we don't want the press involved. We think that hope and liam need time alone with their child.",
        "Det. Sanchez: And how does thomas feel about that?",
        "Ridge: We haven't talked to him!",
        "Det. Sanchez: Well, I'd like to, as soon as possible. Look, mr. Forrester, I know you're just trying to protect your son. Your wife says you're concerned, I know she's concerned. So why don't you give me a call when he reappears? Look, if thomas has done nothing wrong, then he has nothing to worry about. You have a good day.",
        "[ Door opens, closes ]",
        "Ridge: He's fishing.",
        "Brooke: Where is thomas? Why can't we reach him? Why hasn't he called us back? I mean, this is strange. It's really strange behavior. What about all the lies? We really need to find him. I need to know that he's not a threat to my daughter. Ok everyone!",
        "Brooke: Thomas should have called to check on douglas. The fact that he hasn't, it's -- it's really strange. It's the whole reason he came back from new york. He wanted to give douglas a secure life. And that was his justification for going after hope.",
        "Ridge: Stop. Don't -- you got to stop saying that. He didn't go after hope. He proposed to her, she accepted, and they got married.",
        "Brooke: And he lied about beth so that she would stay with him.",
        "Ridge: He made a mistake. He screwed up. I'm not denying that! And he's paying the price for it now. But being deceitful and being selfish is very different from being dangerous, which is what you told the police. Emma died in an accident. And hope isn't scared of thomas. They were gonna have a life together!",
        "Brooke: And how is thomas going to react when he realizes that life is over? He's been obsessed with hope for months. He lied about beth because he didn't want hope to leave him. So what about that? I -- I know that these are ugly questions, ridge.",
        "Ridge: Brooke. You know my son. You know thomas.",
        "Brooke: Yes, I do know thomas. His lies and his manipulations. He tricked hope into marriage. She's not gonna be with him now, ridge. And what is going to happen when he finds out hope doesn't want to be with him? What's he going to do? I'm worried. I am worried for my daughter's safety.",
        "Thomas: We got married for life. [ Chuckles ] To be a family. That's not something you walk away from. And if you really love somebody, you -- you fight for it. [ Cars passing, horn honking ] You do whatever it takes to hold the family together.",
        "Liam: Every time you come out of her room, you're smiling.",
        "Hope: Well, it is just like i imagined, only it's real. Our daughter is sleeping peacefully in her nursery. She is safe in her home.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, thankfully, she was always safe. We just didn't know she was ours.",
        "Hope: [ Sighs ] You know, i think back on when I would visit steffy's and I would hold her, and that bond, how she would ease my pain. That all makes sense now, but everything else... what thomas did...",
        "Liam: Well, thankfully, that's being taken care of, and all you have to do is be with beth.",
        "Hope: Trust me, nothing is going to take away from the joy that I feel right now, but, at the same time, I cannot forget what thomas did, the fact that he married me and he knew that beth was alive. He kept my daughter from me. I mean -- [ Scoffs ] How could anyone be so cruel?",
        "Liam: Well, it wasn't just you. I mean, he deceived other people, too. His own family didn't even realize what he was up to, and that -- that's my whole point. That's why I'm saying we have to be smart about this. If he could -- if he could lie to you about something as epic as beth... there is no telling what else he's capable of.",
        "Hope: Well, he won't do anything else to me.",
        "Liam: Wait. What are you -- who are you gonna call?",
        "Hope: Thomas.",
        "Liam: What? Why?",
        "Hope: I'm going to tell him about the annulment.",
        "Liam: What are you -- let justin do that!",
        "Hope: Liam, I want this finished. I do not want this hanging over our heads.",
        "Liam: Hope, nobody even knows where he is. Ridge has been trying to call him. He's not picking up.",
        "Hope: Thomas won't ignore me.",
        "Brooke: I know you want to find thomas as much as I do.",
        "Ridge: Because I'm concerned about him, not because I think he killed emma or he's trying to hurt your daughter.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] Well, try him again.",
        "Ridge: He doesn't answer his phone.",
        "Brooke: If you keep on trying, maybe he will. I know that you can get through to him.",
        "[ Dialing ]",
        "[ Cellphone ringing ]",
        "[ Ringing continues ]",
        "Thomas: Everything I've done, every decision I've made has been for you. For you and our family. And this new life we're building. I promise to do whatever necessary to protect and defend that family. We were happy. Once I explain... we will be again.",
        "Hope: I want thomas to know it's over.",
        "Liam: I do, too, but you shouldn't be having anything to do with that psycho. Hope, if you call him, it could set him off.",
        "Hope: I am not afraid of him. Thomas is a coward. And he may have tried to manipulate me and control me, but no more. I am making the decisions now.",
        "[ Cellphone ringing ]",
        "Thomas: Hope, I -- I knew you'd call. I -- I missed you.",
        "Hope: Thomas --",
        "Thomas: Look, I know that your mom and -- and liam are probably filling your head with garbage about me, but you -- you have to know, I never meant to hurt you.",
        "Hope: Thomas, you lied to me about the most painful experience of my life, and you could have taken that pain away. You knew beth was alive, and you kept me from my daughter!",
        "Thomas: Because I knew that she was safe, right, and she was happy, and so were you.",
        "Hope: Stop. This isn't why I called. I don't want to hear why you did it.",
        "Thomas: Look, if you would just let me explain --",
        "Hope: Thomas! You betrayed me. You told me that the only way i could be a mother was to help you raise your son. You encouraged me to end my marriage to liam, to have him go back to steffy, all the while, you knew phoebe was beth!",
        "Thomas: Yes, so he could be with both of his daughters.",
        "Hope: And, what, you were just gonna lie to me for the rest of our lives?",
        "Thomas: Hope --",
        "Hope: I contacted a lawyer. I'm having our marriage annulled.",
        "Thomas: What? N-no. You -- you -- you can'T.",
        "Hope: And once the papers are ready, I want to you sign them. [ Echoing ] ...Want you to sign them.",
        "Thomas: Hope, you can't -- you can't annul our marriage, okay? You haven't even heard me yet. You haven't let me explain.",
        "Hope: You can talk to my lawyer.",
        "Thomas: Hope, just give me a chance.",
        "Hope: Thomas, our marriage is over. [ Echoing ] Our marriage is over. Now, you need to reach out to your son because douglas misses you and he's worried that you're angry at him.",
        "Thomas: He never should have been spying on me like that.",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Thomas: Look, what -- what am I supposed to tell douglas, hope? I mean, you -- you can't abandon him like this. He's already lost one mom. If he loses you, too --",
        "Hope: This is not about me. This is about you. You are his father. You need to be there for him.",
        "Thomas: Hope, I -- I was going to do that with you. Remember? We were going to do it together. That was it. We were -- we were gonna be a family.",
        "Hope: Go home. Face your family. And be there for your son. I never want to speak to you ever again. [ Echoing ] Speak to you ever again...",
        "Thomas: Please, hope, you can't do this.",
        "Liam: [ Sighs ]",
        "Thomas: You're going to be my wife. It's gonna be, it's gonna be -- you're gonna be my wife. You're going to be my wife. Till death do us part. . . ."
