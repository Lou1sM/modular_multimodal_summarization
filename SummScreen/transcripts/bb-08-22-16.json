Thomas kisses Sasha before she leaves. She tells Thomas that suddenly she doesn't seem to want to leave so fast. They share some ice cream before he kisses her again as she leaves. Ridge tells Brooke that he was asked to move out so Quinn can move in with Eric and that is not going to happen. Wyatt tells Liam that he hasn't figured this all out yet but he has to go home and tell Steffy and hope for the best. Steffy tells Quinn that she is going to go home and start packing. Quinn begs her not to but Steffy tells her only she can change this so live with it. Brooke advises Ridge to not be too forceful with Eric and she is here for reinforcement if he needs it. As Sasha leaves Liam comes in and needs to speak with Thomas. Eric comes back into the room and Quinn gives her details of how Steffy threatened Wyatt and their marriage. She will move out on Wyatt unless Quinn moves out of Eric's. He says that was an unfair demand of Steffy and he is glad she did not give in. Ridge walks in and Eric says he is interrupting; Steffy is not still here. She came and had her little fit and is gone. Ridge tells Eric that Quinn is not moving in here. Eric says he is the father, not the child here, and Ridge cannot make this call. Steffy returns home and she says she already knows the news. Wyatt says he tried to talk Quinn out of it but she would not budge. She says she did too and she even told her that if she didn't, she would move out of Wyatt's. They discuss it and she says nothing Wyatt does will make Quinn change her mind so she needs to leave so she can protect herself and her family from Quinn. He doesn't know what he can do other than go in there and drag Quinn out by her hair. Steffy says that might work but yes that is what she is gonna do \u0096 move out right now.

He will go and pick Quinn up and physically take her out of that house, just do not leave!"], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Quinn: Don't do this.", "Steffy: You're forcing me. This is what it comes to. Wyatt's future is in your hands. You walk out this door right now and nothing changes for him.", "Quinn: You would really move out?", "Steffy: If you move in with my grandfather and start a relationship with him... yes. I will move out tonight. So what's it gonna be? Do you care about Wyatt's marriage or not?", "Quinn: Of course I do. I don't want to hurt Wyatt. But I care about Eric, too, and I don't want to hurt him, either. And I won't.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: What is wrong with Eric?! Seriously?! Asking Quinn to move in? He's -- he's got to know how upset his whole family will be.", "Wyatt: Yeah, especially Steffy.", "Liam: She won't accept it, Wyatt.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: So, Steffy's over there now talking to Eric?", "Ridge: Yep. Trying to make him realize how crazy this all is.", "Brooke: A relationship with Quinn -- it's beyond crazy.", "Ridge: I'm worried about him, the kind of power he gives that woman and what that's gonna do to the rest of us. Especially Steffy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: Thomas?", "Thomas: Are you, uh, are you sure you have to go?", "Sasha: Well, I-I'm not in a hurry to. I'm not in a hurry for anything.", "Thomas: Good. Me neither. Uh, maybe you can stay. You could hang out for a little bit. Might as well not be in a hurry together.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: We'll all join forces and put a stop to it before it goes too far.", "Ridge: Uh-huh. He doesn't exactly seem open to our opinion. And if he's moving her into his house...", "Brooke: You don't know he is. You've always had an overactive imagination.", "Ridge: And you have always been very optimistic right till the end. I appreciate that about you. But I have to assume that he's moving me out so he can move her in. Quinn fuller in my mother's house. It's not gonna happen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: I told my mom that this is wrong. I told her that I expect her to stay away from Eric.", "Liam: Did she listen?", "Wyatt: Well, I -- not exactly.", "Liam: Okay, so what's your plan, Wyatt? How you gonna get through to her this time?", "Wyatt: I don't know! I got to figure that out!", "Liam: And what about Steffy?", "Wyatt: I-I got to go home and tell her and just hope for the best. We're gonna work through this. We have to.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: You're staying?", "Quinn: I have to. What I feel for Eric --", "Steffy: He's an easy target. That's what you feel.", "Quinn: No.", "Steffy: I hope you understand what you're doing. I'm gonna go home now and I'm gonna start packing.", "Quinn: Please don't.", "Steffy: Don't -- don't make me, Quinn! Do the right thing! Walk out the door right now! Fine. I hope you're ready for the consequences.", "Quinn: [Sighs] Please don't. You can't!", "Steffy: You're making me do this!", "Quinn: Oh, Steffy, please!", "Steffy: It's your choice, Quinn. Live with it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Steffy's not answering?", "Ridge: No. Straight to her machine. Maybe her phone's off. I'm going over there.", "Brooke: Wait, don't make your father feel attacked. It'll only make things worse.", "Ridge: I won't.", "Brooke: I'm gonna go with you. You and Steffy can be a little forceful at times. I think he needs a gentler approach.", "Ridge: Maybe forceful is what he needs right now. And if I fail, I will call in my gentler reinforcements. How about that?", "Brooke: Don't hesitate. I'm here for you. Anytime.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door closes]", "Sasha: Mmm. Okay. Can I come over every night?", "Thomas: For my ice cream?", "Sasha: Oh, no. He's on to me.", "Thomas: [Chuckles] Well, I'll -- I'll keep my freezer fully stocked just in case you ever stop by.", "Sasha: Ooh. Okay. You just got a bazillion brownie points with me.", "Thomas: Oh, good, good. Um, eventually I will be able to cash in these points for something, right?", "Sasha: Eventually, I think... you might. Well, I better get going.", "Thomas: Already? Really? Yeah?", "Sasha: Yeah.", "Thomas: Ah.", "Sasha: It's getting late. Besides, you got to leave them wanting more, right?", "Thomas: [Sighs] You have succeeded.", "Sasha: [Chuckles] Okay, now this...", "Thomas: Mm-hmm?", "Sasha: Um, I'm pretty sure I can do this.", "Thomas: Okay.", "Sasha: Okay. Got the thing and the... auto lock. Ohh!", "Thomas: Wow. I-I'm impressed.", "Sasha: You know, I think earlier just... this had me a little flustered and distracted, but now I'm back together, level-headed. Got myself. I'm good.", "Thomas: I'll take that as a, uh, a compliment.", "Sasha: You should. Bye. Oh, wow. Hey, Liam.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Hi, Sasha. Are you heading out? Could I talk to you for a sec?", "Thomas: Come on in.", "Liam: Thanks.", "Thomas: Well, uh, see you tomorrow?", "Sasha: Definitely.", "Thomas: All right.", "Sasha: Have a good night.", "Thomas: See you. What's going on?", "Liam: Get this. Your grandfather and Quinn are moving in together.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: I believe that fits the front door. I don't want to be too forward, but I'm wondering if you're interested in shacking up with me, my fair lady.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Steffy has been more than clear with you since the beginning of my marriage that she does not want you around, and then you come up with this brilliant idea to move into her family home with Eric?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Put your son's needs before yours.", "Quinn: I always put Wyatt's needs first.", "Steffy: Good. Keep doing it. Or else.", "Quinn: What are you saying?", "Steffy: I will leave Wyatt.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Wyatt's gone?", "Quinn: He left awhile ago.", "Eric: Then I have you all to myself. Come here.", "[Both chuckle]", "Eric: Quinn, Quinn. Quinn. What is it? He tried to talk you out of moving in, didn't he?", "Quinn: Yeah, yeah. But that's not what's bothering me. I can get Wyatt to come around eventually. I know I can. He wants what's best for me, and...eventually he'll realize that we're really good for each other. Steffy, on the other hand, is...", "Eric: Wait, you -- you talked to Steffy?", "Quinn: Yes. She showed up here. After Wyatt left, she was, um... she was so angry. She was lashing out, making threats.", "Eric: She threatened you here?", "Quinn: No, no, no, no. I wish she threatened me. That -- that I could handle. She... she threatened Wyatt. And their marriage. She said because I'm not moving out of here, she's gonna move out on him.", "Eric: What?", "Quinn: Steffy's moving out. Tonight.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Wyatt: Hey, um... there's, uh, there's something I got to tell you.", "Steffy: I already know. I was just there.", "Wyatt: Uh, where?", "Steffy: At my grandfather's. With your mom.", "Wyatt: I-I-I tried to talk her out of moving in there. She just -- she wouldn't budge.", "Steffy: I know. I tried the same thing. I thought you were gonna be able to control her. I can't have that woman living with my grandfather.", "Wyatt: We'll figure out a way to get her out of there.", "Steffy: I told Quinn if she didn't move out...I would.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Steffy's moving out? Because of us?", "Quinn: She said she would stay with Wyatt if I left you.", "Eric: I hate that this is hurting my granddaughter. But it's a ridiculous and it's an unfair demand. I'm glad you didn't give in.", "Quinn: I just hope she's bluffing that she's not gonna walk away from her marriage.", "Eric: I hope so, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Ridge: Wow. I'm interrupting?", "Eric: Matter of fact, you are.", "Ridge: Well, I want to talk to you. Steffy still here?", "Eric: No, she came. She threw her fit and then she left. Is it your turn?", "Ridge: I just want to talk to you in private. So you can go home.", "Eric: She's home. No.", "Ridge: Excuse me?", "Eric: Quinn lives here now. I invited her to stay, and she accepted.", "Ridge: That's not happening.", "Eric: Not up to you.", "Ridge: Dad, this woman is not moving in here. I can't let you do that.", "Eric: You don't come in here and start barking orders, Ridge. I'm your father. I'm not your child. You need to start understanding that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: This has officially gotten insane.", "Liam: Yeah, well, no surprise there. We're talking about Quinn.", "Thomas: Steffy's gonna be livid.", "Liam: Yeah, that's why I'm here, Thomas. I'm worried about her. You -- you and I both know she's gonna flip out, but this is too much. She shouldn't have to deal with this.", "Thomas: And she wouldn't have to if she was married to you instead of Wyatt.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: You told my mother that you're leaving me?", "Steffy: I told her I'd move out unless she walked out the door. I begged her. She didn't. She claims to love you so much, but not enough to keep me in your home.", "Wyatt: I-I don't understand why you would say something like that.", "Steffy: Because I... I had to.", "Wyatt: Yeah, but how does that threat even pop into your head, Steffy?", "Steffy: Because -- because she fought so hard to get us together! She fought so hard to get us married! I just -- I thought that she would do anything to get us to stay together! I guess -- I guess I was wrong!", "Wyatt: Okay, so -- so then you don't actually have to move out. You gave her an ultimatum, and she didn't listen!", "Steffy: You promised that she wasn't gonna be an issue for us anymore.", "Wyatt: She doesn't have to be.", "Steffy: You promised that she was gonna be out of our lives, but things are just getting worse and worse. It's like first she tricks us into getting married, and now -- and now she's living at my grandfather's house, and it's just like I --", "Wyatt: Wait, \"tricked\"?", "Steffy: That's --", "Wyatt: \"Tricked\"?", "Steffy: You know that's not what I mean. You know that my feelings for you are real. But yeah. We were tricked. And as painful as that was to discover, I stuck by you, and I chose to believe in our marriage.", "Wyatt: Until now. That's basically what you're saying is -- is until now.", "Steffy: Wyatt, I need to feel protected. I need to know that my family is protected.", "Wyatt: Yeah, well, I did that, okay?! I did that time and time again! I told my mom to stay away!", "Steffy: Yeah.", "Wyatt: And even after tonight when I found out that she was moving in there, I demanded her to not do that -- for you.", "Steffy: You're not taking -- where is the action? That's just talking to her!", "Wyatt: So what do you want me to do?! Do you want me to just drag her out of there kicking and screaming?", "Steffy: Yes! Yes! If what we have means anything to you!", "Wyatt: [Scoffs]", "Steffy: I love you. But I ca-- I can't put up with this anymore.", "Wyatt: Are you being serious right now? You -- you're -- you're moving out of here?", "Steffy: I am.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: I'm treating you like a child? How? By voicing my concerns? By telling you that people are worried about you?", "Eric: Don't worry. You can stop worrying. I've been making my own choices since long before you were born.", "Ridge: Yes, your own choices, your own decisions. Not always the best ones when women are concerned. We have that in common, Dad. Sometimes we lose our head. It happens.", "Eric: My life, my choices.", "Ridge: Yes. Your choices. And I can get behind most of them. You want to run the company again? Sure. It's your company. Want to be in this house? Yes. Your house. But this...with that... makes me wonder who makes these choices around here. Who's motivating all that?", "Eric: Motivating? Motivation? My motivation is that I'm alive, Ridge! When your mother died, I could have just faded into the woodwork. I could have just lost myself in my own grief. I got pushed out of my company. I could have just sat there and waited for my turn to die. Well, I'm not waiting. I'm alive, Ridge. That's my motivation. I'm happy, I'm healthy, and I've got what I want. I've got a company, I've got a family, and I've got Quinn. Oh, I know you're not happy about this. Nobody's happy, especially you. Well, I am. And as long as Quinn is happy and I'm happy, that's all that matters.", "Ridge: Can't accept that, Dad.", "Eric: Live your life, Ridge. I won't tell you how. You don't tell me how to live mine, either. Understood?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: We will protect Steffy no matter what. Quinn moving in with granddad. That's -- that's -- that's crazy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Yeah, it is. And Steffy needs to free herself from it. She needs to put this marriage and Wyatt behind her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: This doesn't even make any sense. You're moving out because of an ultimatum that you never should have made in the first place.", "Steffy: Her moving in is the last straw.", "Wyatt: For her, yes! But what about for me? Why is it that our marriage is what's being sacrificed here?!", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: Is this -- is this like another excuse? Are you just trying to get back to Liam? Is that what this is about? Is that what you're doing?", "Steffy: If I needed an excuse to be with Liam, I think finding out that your mom kidnapped him to keep him away from me would be enough!", "Wyatt: Ohh.", "Steffy: My vows to you are true! I married you because I love you! So do not dare question my feelings for you! And don't -- don't bring Liam in this! This isn't about Liam! This is about your mom! You swore that you were gonna get her out of our lives, but yet here she is! She's at Forrester! She's targeting my grandfather -- [Scoffs] -- After kidnapping Liam and molesting him, and then she just repeatedly lies to us, and you've done nothing! You've done nothing!", "Wyatt: Nothing?", "Steffy: And that's -- [Sighs] That is why I need to get away. That is why I need to get away from Quinn, okay?", "Wyatt: Away from me.", "Steffy: [Sighs] That's...", "Wyatt: What are you doing?", "Steffy: I'm leaving.", "Wyatt: What? Where -- now? Where you gonna go?!", "Steffy: I don't know. I don't -- I'm gonna -- [Sighs] I'm gonna go to Thomas'. I don't --", "Wyatt: No, you can't leave, all right?! You're not leaving tonight! Not until you give me another chance to fix this!", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: You say -- you say that my words aren't enough, that you need more actions? That's bull, because all I've been doing is defending you and protecting you since day one! Okay, fine, fine! You want more actions? You'll get actions. I hate everything that my mother is doing just as much as you do. So I will go over there. I will. If -- if she refuses to leave, I will pick her up and escort her out of there myself. I won't rest until she's out of that house and out of our lives for good. But come on, Steffy. You can't -- you can't leave. I would do anything for you. Just don't leave, Steffy. Don't leave.", "Steffy: [Sighs]"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo2DeaA7TQs"}
