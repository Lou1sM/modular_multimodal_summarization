        "Bridget: Well, actually they admitted to it. They just said they weren't gonna act on it, because he wants a future with me.",

        "Bridget: When I found out I was pregnant, I was so excited, I rushed home to tell him, and I walked in on him and my mother, again. There's something there, Catherine. And I'm just afraid that he's still in love with her.",

        "Bridget: I know this might be really hard for you because you're close to my mom.",
        "Catherine: Brooke and Nick? I can't believe your mom would do something like that to you. Not after what happened with deacon.",
        "Bridget: I hope she doesn't. I pray to god that nothing's going on between them.",
        "Dante: But if it does, she just needs someone to be honest with her.",
        "Bridget: Will you do this for me? Please? For the baby.",
        "Catherine: Okay. Okay, I'll do it. But I'm telling you, nick is committed to you, Bridget. Whatever feelings he has for your mother, they can't compare to the way he's gonna feel about you and this child.",
        "Brooke: Nick, come in. Please, just come in. I can't believe this. I can't believe that my daughter would terminate her pregnancy.",
        "Nick: Well, she did.",
        "Brooke: Why? Why? Because of what she saw here at the house? The two of us together. What we told her. Nick, we pushed her to this. She did this because of me. Because of my mistakes that I made in the past. My little girl -- I drove her to this. I drove her to this.",

        "Dante: They put you into this position.",
        "Bridget: It was my decision to lie.",
        "Dante: It was the right one.",
        "Bridget: I've seen how lies work, though. They just spin out of control and ruin people's lives. Nick was completely devastated when I told him that I aborted our child. I know my mother. She's going to feel guilty. Take this on herself.",
        "Dante: Your mother is not innocent in this, you know.",
        "Bridget: Well, neither am I! I'm deceiving the man that I love and my own mother. I'm deliberately causing them pain.",
        "Dante: Listen, I'm not telling you what to do, okay? If you can't go through with this, go ahead and call him right now and just tell him you're still pregnant. But if you do that, and you end up get married to this man, you'll never know if this man chose you or chose the baby. Now listen to me, okay? Just wait a couple of days. Let Catherine find out what's going on. She's gonna tell you the truth.",
        "Bridget: What if nothing's going on? What if I've been acting out of sheer panic?",
        "Dante: Nick and your mother admitted they have feelings for one other. If they're going to act on them, it's better for you to know now.",
        "Bridget: I don't know.",
        "Dante: One way or another, you're about to have your answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You didn't drive her to anything. Bridget made her own choice.",
        "Brooke: No. No, we pushed her to this, Nick. We did this to her. Talking about our feelings. Her seeing us together.",
        "Nick: It doesn't matter. The damage is done and there's no changing it. It's gone. The love and the baby. It's gone.",
