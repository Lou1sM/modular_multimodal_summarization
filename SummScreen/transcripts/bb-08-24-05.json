        "Bridget: You said you loved me, Nick. I really want to believe you. In my wildest dreams I never thought I'd see the day someone would change me you walked into my life and now I feel so alive I'm just not the same me you're my soul reason that I feel this way come and warm me like the sun you're my inspiration you're every breath I take you're my soul reason I laugh, I cry I live, I die and I love you're my soul reason that I feel this way come and warm me like the sun you're my inspiration you're every breath I take | you're my soul reason I laugh, I cry I live, I die and I love you're my soul reason",
        "Dante: You sure you want to do this?",
        "Bridget: Nick deserves to know the truth.",
        "Dante: So do you.",
        "Bridget: I lied to him. I told him I aborted our child. I set him up just to see how committed he was to me.",
        "Dante: It's not a setup, it's a test.",
        "Bridget: Well, I was wrong. I wasn't thinking clearly.",
        "Dante: They both admitted they have feelings for one other.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, they're determined to get over them.",
        "Dante: But can they? They could be together right now.",
        "Bridget: If they are, it's because I devastated him. I practically threw him into her arms.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Doorbell rings ]",
        "Nick: I haven't heard from her. Have you?",
        "Brooke: No. No, come in. I left messages on her cell all night and all day today. I apologized, begged her to come home. I've just been going over it in my mind and trying to figure out what she was thinking. What made her so desperate to abort your baby? I'm sorry, Nick. I know you're angry, and hurt.",
        "Nick: You were right. You were right, what you said yesterday why Bridget did this -- you were right. I've been thinking about it all night. Everything -- everything I've thought about -- wrong things. And then I was finally honest with myself. She doesn't trust us, and she shouldn't, because I looked that girl right in the eye and told her we still have feelings for each other.",
        "Brooke: Feelings we said we would never act on.",
        "Nick: I told her I would keep her safe. I gave her my word that I would love her, and I would protect her and that she'd never be alone. And what happens instead? What happens? She's forced to do something that goes against everything that she believes in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Thanks for stopping by.",
        "Thorne: Don't mention it. How are they doing?",
        "Taylor: Oh, Ridge is in heaven.",
        "Thorne: Any word on Bridget?",
        "Taylor: You know about that?",
        "Thorne: Dad said you might be counseling her. I thought you might need help running interference with mother, 'cause obviously, she hasn't learned her lesson to keep out of other people's business.",
        "Taylor: Well, Bridget can use all the help she can get. [ Taylor sighs ] But that's not why I wanted to see you. Thorne, I've got problems of my own with your brother that I need help sorting out.",
        "Thorne: I had a feeling you and Ridge were having problems. Is he second guessing his decision of leaving Brooke?",
        "Taylor: Well, he's here, but he's not. He's distracted, and he's distant -- you know, I cannot live like that. I need to know that he's put Brooke in the past.",
        "Thorne: Well, Taylor, have you told him that?",
        "Taylor: He's trying to please everybody.",
        "Thorne: But pleasing no one.",
        "Taylor: Exactly.",
        "Thorne: The guy's in a tough position.",
        "Taylor: I know, and I sympathize with him. It'll be a lot easier for all of us if he would just be honest with his feelings. Forget what Brooke wants. Forget what I want.",
        "Thorne: Well, that's easier said than done.",
        "Taylor: Well, he has to do it, Thorne. We're not going to be able to move forward until he understands what it is he's truly feeling. And that's why I need your help.",
        "Thorne: Me?",
        "Taylor: Yeah, I'd like you to talk to him, help him sort out his feelings.",
        "Thorne: And report back to you?",
        "Taylor: No, no. I would never ask you to do that, Thorne. He just needs somebody to open up to. It's not healthy for him to hold all those feelings inside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Don't say that.",
        "Nick: Come on, we both know Bridget had to be out of her mind to do what she did.",
        "Brooke: Then we'll get her some help, counseling. And if we're part of the problem, then we'll do it together.",
        "Nick: Is that gonna bring my child back?",
        "Brooke: No, but you do have another chance with Bridget. Now, I know she's hurt and confused right now. She feels betrayed. But that doesn't mean she isn't going to forgive you.",
        "Nick: It's not gonna happen.",
        "Brooke: You don't know that.",
        "Nick: I know it. It's not gonna happen. She's not gonna forgive me. She can't. I know, because I can't forgive her.",
        "Brooke: But you love each other.",
        "Nick: Well, sometimes love's not enough. You know, you have to have respect and trust, and we've lost both of those.",
        "Brooke: So what does that mean? It's over?",
        "Nick: Bridget's her own woman. She doesn't need anybody to complete her. But she does deserve to be happy. And if I could give her that -- but we've both hurt each other enough. [ Nick scoffs ] I don't even know what I was thinking, gettin' into a relationship. I mean, they've all fallen apart on me. It becomes one catastrophe after another.",
        "Brooke: That's not true.",
        "Nick: Oh, let's face it, have I ever really brought any happiness to her life, or to your life for that matter? I hurt everybody I care about, even little hope.",
        "Brooke: Bridget's not herself right now. But I do believe that she still loves you. And so does Hope.",
        "Nick: Is she here?",
        "Brooke: She and R.J. Went to visit Ridge.",
        "Nick: Well, that's good. Kids should be with their dad. I'm gonna go.",
        "Brooke: Nick, you shouldn't be alone right now.",
        "Nick: You know, Brooke, a sailor's never alone when he's at home.",
        "Brooke: On your boat.",
        "Nick: I'm gonna go back to the only lady I've really ever understood.",
        "Brooke: But you and Bridget planned a life together. Don't you think you should try to get back on course?",
        "Nick: Well, it's kind of fitting, really. We started with a shipwreck, and that's how it ends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Hey, Thorne. Taylor told me you were down here.",
        "Thorne: Yeah. I saw the girls on their way out. Alexandria's always asking to spend more time with her cousins.",
        "Ridge: I know, I know. I'm sorry we haven't been around much lately.",
        "Thorne: Well, you've been busy. We understand.",
        "Ridge: Probably do me good to spend some time around an uncomplicated family to remember what it was like.",
        "Thorne: Well, even the happiest marriage are complicated, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Don't get me wrong, being here with Taylor and the kids is still a miracle to me. But they're not my only family. Sometimes, when I'm with Thomas and the girls, I think about R.J. and Hope. When I'm with Taylor, I --",
        "Thorne: Thinking about Brooke?",
        "Ridge: Brooke's moved on.",
        "Thorne: The question is, have you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Catherine: Brooke, are you okay?",
        "Brooke: Catherine, I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Catherine: You seem kind of worried. Did something happened?",
        "Brooke: Has Bbridget tried to contact you?",
        "Catherine: Why?",
        "Brooke: You have no idea where she might be?",
        "Catherine: Is there some reason you need to find her?",
        "Brooke: Yesterday, I told you that she was pregnant. She's not anymore. She -- terminated her pregnancy.",
        "Catherine: Oh, Brooke, no. You know Bridget would never do that.",
        "Brooke: No, I know, I know. Not if she were in her right mind. And she isn't. She thinks something's going to happen between Nick and me. But she's wrong, we can't seem to convince her of that. And now, Nick just wants to give up.",
        "Catherine: On their relationship?",
        "Brooke: I don't think he can forgive her.",
        "Catherine: Maybe if they talked, he would change his mind.",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Catherine: Oh, no.",
        "Brooke: I really think that it's over.",
        "Catherine: Well, obviously, you have a lot on your mind. I just wanted to ask if it was okay if I ran an errand before I pick the kids up at Ridge's.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Catherine: Thanks.",
        "Brooke: \"Meteorologists predict the remnants of tropical storm Teresa will turn north up the southern California coast after coming ashore in Mexico this afternoon. Coastal towns should prepare for high winds, record swells and a violent storm surge.\" Oh, my god. Nick.",
        "[ Brooke remembering ]",
        "Nick: I'm gonna back to the only lady I've ever really understood.",
        "Brooke: He wasn't talking going back to the marlin. He's going back to the sea.",
        "[ Brooke remembering ]",
        "Nick: Bridget and I started with a shipwreck, and that's how it ends.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god. He's sailing right into that storm.",
        "Radio: Gale warnings are in effect as far north as San Diego and Los Angeles. The small craft advisory for the waters of California has been upgraded to a warning. All craft are advised to find anchorage immediately.",
        "Nick: Screw it.",
        "Radio: Upgraded to a warning. All craft are advised to find anchorage immediately.",
        "Nick: Screw it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Your entire life, you've never had a man who was truly devoted to you. That could change right now. If you'd just open your eyes, you'd see that that man is standing right here in front of you.",
        "Bridget: Dante --",
        "Dante: We could be happy.",
        "Bridget: It wouldn't be love. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just -- I'm in love with nick. I hate lying to him. This plan, just telling him I had an abortion -- god, I think I've made a terrible mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Mother pressured you into renewing your vows with Taylor.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Thorne: You wouldn't have chosen to do it spur of the moment in a hospital room.",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Thorne: But you still would have done it, right?",
        "Ridge: I can't answer that, Thorne. I love Taylor -- always have, always will. Brooke's been a big part of my life, too. The last few years, she and the kids have been everything to me. Back when I wasn't getting along with you and dad and everyone else, even thoughB might have disagreed with me, she saw me through that time. Well, I sure couldn't see her through this.",
        "Thorne: What, you feel guilty?",
        "Ridge: I just want her to be happy. I really do. It's just kind of strange for me to think of her moving on with somebody else -- with some new guy, and raising Hope and R.J. With him. I --",
        "Thorne: This is a real problem for you, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: For me, and for Taylor. She thinks I should leave Brooke behind, and I know I probably should. I should do that. I -- I just don't know if I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: I'll never forget the look on his face when I told him I aborted our child.",
        "Dante: He was shocked.",
        "Bridget: He was devastated. If he was in love with my mother, he would have been relieved. And he wasn't. He was horrified, heartbroken.",
        "Dante: For the loss of the baby.",
        "Bridget: Our baby, our family, the life that we had planned together. He never gave up on us. I hurt him, because I took it away from him. I have to tell him the truth. I have to -- I can't do this to him anymore!",
        "Dante: Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Hold on a second. What's the rush? Listen, if you're so sure that Nick is so committed to you, a few more hours are not gonna make much difference. Bridget, just -- just one more night, okay? One more night, and you'll get all the answers you'll ever need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Radio: High winds and rough seas are lashing the coast. All small craft are advised to find anchorage immediately.",
        "Nick: What the hell are you doing here?!",
        "Brooke: I knew it. You're leaving.",
        "Nick: Go home.",
        "Brooke: I'm not letting you go.",
        "Nick: Well, it's really not your choice, is it?",
        "Radio: The coast guard is reporting a force 9 gale. Winds to 45 knots and 20-foot seas.",
        "Brooke: 20-foot seas?! You're really gonna go out in this?",
        "Nick: I've been in worse.",
        "Brooke: Nick, you're gonna kill yourself. Is that what you want?",
        "Nick: Maybe.",
        "Brooke: Stop it. Stop running away!",
        "Nick: Well, I'm not doing anybody any good here, am I?",
        "Brooke: That's not true!",
        "Nick: I've brought nothing but pain to you and your entire family.",
        "Brooke: You have always been a rock for us.",
        "Nick: Your daughter killed my child. I think that says it all, don't you?",
        "Brooke: She was wrong. And you're wrong to think that running away is gonna fix anything. Were you even going to say good-bye?",
        "Nick: No! Because I knew this would happen. I knew you'd try to stop me.",
        "Brooke: Yes, yes, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.",
        "Nick: Why, why?",
        "Brooke: Because you are the one man who has stood by me.",
        "Nick: Brooke, I ruined your relationship with your daughter. If I'm gone, then maybe she'll forgive you.",
        "Brooke: And if you leave, I won't forgive you.",
        "Nick: I can't help you anymore! I can't help Bridget! Hell, I can't even help myself!",
        "Brooke: Well, then let me help you! Yes, yes, this has been a tragedy, for all of us. But you really want to go out there and make it worse by killing yourself?",
        "Nick: Why shouldn't I, huh? Give me one reason why I shouldn't! I lost my child. Bridget doesn't love me anymore. If she loved me, she couldn't do what she did!",
        "Brooke: Maybe you're right, Nick. Maybe Bridget doesn't love you anymore. But damn it, I do! I do."
