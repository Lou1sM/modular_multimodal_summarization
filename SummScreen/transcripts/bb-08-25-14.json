{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Liam tells Hope that he knows she waited, but he was there. She argues that he wasn't. He repeats she had on a blue dress and was beautiful; he saw her. She answers angrily if he was there, then he should have come to her. Meanwhile the groupies have Wyatt pinned on the stair steps wanting to hear all the details of the wedding and honeymoon. He tells them people are starting to leave so he should go find Hope. They try to convince him to stay and Bill saves the day by coming by and says he needs a word with Wyatt. He says there is something Wyatt needs to know and he didn't want to say it in front of Hope. Bill says that Liam was in Paris. He just didn't get to Hope in time. Wyatt says he is wrong. It's the whole reason she married him. Bill quickly describes how Ivy fell into the Seine and of course Liam is a good swimmer and had to rescue her. So Wyatt says he is married to Hope now because Ivy fell into the river. Bill tells him not to say that. Wyatt says but it is true. If Ivy had not fell in the water and Liam dove in, he would have been in Hope's spot on time and they would be married now. Bill says none of that matters now. Wyatt says of course it is when Hope finds out. Bill says she doesn't have to know. Wyatt says yes because he is not keeping any secrets from Hope. Bill tells him, okay, he and Hope are married. Wyatt knows how Hope is. She will honor her vows and he had a conversation with Liam and he is not going to be a problem. He expects Liam to respect the marriage. Hope continues to question Liam of why he was not there. He admits he was angry with her at their last conversation and he was not sure he would come. Hope says she wasn't sure either but she had faith in them. And that it was even more painful when he did not show up. She utters that it seemed so simple to her \u0096 3 o'clock, Eiffel Tower, be there or not. And when he didn't, she knew his decision. He says except that she was wrong. He did everything he could to get to her but when he did she was gone. Quinn asks Deacon how did it go. He says Brooke did not believe him at first but she knows the secret now and she is pretty torn up. Quinn chuckles. Deacon tells her not to do that. This is not fun for him. He actually cares how Brooke feels. She says she understands. That is why they are doing this. He cares for Brooke like she cares for Bill. It was fun seeing all the families together. And now that Ridge's secret is out, who knows what might develop.", "Brooke approaches Ridge and says whatever caused this, whatever happened they will fix it. Designing is his passion. She says he is an artist. He's just blocked, it's normal under the circumstances. She asks if he has been struggling alone and he replies that Katie knows. Brooke says he should have come to her and not been ashamed. He says other things like names came back to him but this one thing has not and he doesn't think he will ever design again. He scribbles things down but they don't look like anything. His mind doesn't seem to be able to tell his hands what to do. Katie walks in and Ridge tells her that Brooke knows. Katie says she is glad she knows what he has been struggling with. Brooke tells Ridge he will get through this. He is Ridge Forrester, a great designer. He is not going to lose that. Bill walks in and asks when did the party come in here. Wyatt starts up the stairs and of course the girls are dogging him. He says he knows they have been trying to stop him from going upstairs to see Hope. He will tell Liam they did a good job. Hope asks Liam to explain how this happened. He says Ivy was with him. They landed, they got a cab but the traffic was snarled so they got out and started running. She says she had her phone; he could have called. He retorts that he didn't think he had to. He could see her across the way. He could picture her smile when they reunited in Paris. Then he heard Ivy scream as she had fell in the water. Hope continues and Liam jumped in to save her, of course. Liam says it was past three then and all he could do was run and hope that Hope would still be there but she wasn't. Bill says look at the three of them, so serious. This is supposed to be a wedding party not a funeral. Ridge takes Katie by the arm and they leave. Bill wants to know what is going on. She obviously must have told them that he and Brooke were getting married and it didn't go well. But they will come around. Meantime everybody is leaving so they should just go to his jet and fly to the yacht. She's not budging. She says Ridge just confirmed something. He hasn't been the same since he fell. Bill asks her not to get back to that. He says he knows Ridge was struggling and it took a while to recover but he is back to his old self. And he has apologized for his part in it. Brooke says that is just it. He is not his old self. He can not draw .his gift is gone, all because he fell out of a helicopter. Hope tells Liam she is not surprised that he jumped in to help Ivy. But he must understand that doesn't change her perspective. He was not there; Wyatt was and he could see how upset she was. Suddenly Liam coming seemed very ridiculous. Liam says he showed up but admits he was late; now she knows. Wyatt walks in. He takes one look at Liam, then to Hope and says the party is over, come on honey."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Hope: Wow.

A lot of things -- you know, a lot of things were confusing, um... names and...relationships, memories, you know? But, um... I recovered.

How will Brooke ever forgive Bill for putting such a talented man out of commission?", "Deacon: Now, you do realize she's gonna blame you the most?", "Quinn: Oh, I can handle her dirty looks, as long as she's also directing them at Bill.

Ridge, you don't need to be ashamed.", "Ridge: The day I came home and I went to work and you guys -- you guys were standing there, waiting for me, cheering me on. [Sighs] Man, what a rush. What a day. Then I went to my office, and I pick up a pencil. And I froze.", "Brooke: I remember that day. You went home. We just thought you were tired.", "Ridge: Yeah.", "Katie: Hey. There you are.", "Ridge: Hey.", "Katie: What's going on?", "Ridge: Brooke knows.", "Katie: She knows what you've been struggling with.", "Brooke: Design is your passion.

But Ivy was in the water. Liam had to help her. I mean, what choice did he have?", "Wyatt: Okay, so I'm married, basically, because Ivy fell in the river.", "Bill: [Sighs] Don't say that.", "Wyatt: No, but it's true. It's true. If she hadn't, Liam would have made it to hope and they would be married right now.", "Bill: All right, well, at is point, it doesn't matter.", "Wyatt: Of course it matters. When hope finds out about this --", "Bill: She doesn't have to.", "Wyatt: I am not keeping any secrets from her.", "Bill: Okay, listen to me. You and hope are married. Now, you know how hope is.

You and hope are married, and he knows I expect him to respect that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: You were there?", "Liam: Yes.", "Hope: Then what happened? What happened, Liam? What, you just stood on the bridge and you watched me standing there, waiting for you? What -- why were you there? I knew you were upset about the diamond, but...", "Liam: That's not... I didn't think you should accept it, especially not in front of the press, and especially not after you told me you would give it back to him, and then you took off to paris. With him. And you're right. I was -- I was angry. And when you left and you told me to meet you there, honestly, I-I didn't know if I would.", "Hope: I didn't know. I didn't know, either, but I-I chose to believe that you'd be there. I chose to have faith in us. That made it all the more painful when you didn't show up. It seemed so simple to me. 3:00, Eiffel tower, be there or not. So when that clock struck 3:00 and you weren't there... I knew your decision.", "Liam: Except you were wrong. I did everything I could to get to you. But when I did, you were gone.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Kind of a change for us, being part of it all, feeling wanted.", "Deacon: Yeah, thanks to hope and Wyatt. No, today was -- today was good.

Now that Ridge's secret is out, who knows what might develop.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I'm glad you know what he's been struggling with. He's been trying to keep it a secret, but...he needs support. You see that, right?", "Brooke: I'm here for you, always. We both are. [Sighs] I just can't believe this is happening. All because of...", "Katie: Bill said he wanted to teach him a lesson, to make a point. You know, \"no one punches me and drags my bride away.\" He said to cool him off. And look at what happened.", "Brooke: You're going to get through this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Well, I've been trying. I got nothing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: You'll get it back. You are Ridge Forrester. You're a great designer. You're not losing that.", "Bill: Oh, hey. There you are.", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "Bill: When did the party come in here?", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Oh, great! So, uh -- so your dad left.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: You were about to tell us the vows. Who spoke first?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Later. I need to find hope and tell her that I -- oh. You two have been trying to keep me from doing that. I'll tell Liam you did your job.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: This doesn't make any sense. Please explain this to me.", "Liam: We landed in plenty of time. Didn't even occur to me that we wouldn't get to you.", "Hope: We? Who's we?", "Liam: Ivy was with me. We landed. We jumped in a car. But then we got stuck in traffic, and we waited it out for a while, but...it was getting close to 3:00 and we weren't moving, so we got out. And we started running.", "Hope: Liam, I-I-I had a phone. I had a cell phone. Why didn't you call me?", "Liam: I didn't think I needed to. I could see you from where I was, and I was picturing your face when I got to you. I was...picturing your smile, reuniting in paris.", "Hope: If you were that close, then --", "Liam: I was on the bridge. I was on the bridge, and I could see you in the distance, and... that's when I heard Ivy scream.", "Hope: What?", "Liam: Someone bumped into her. She fell into the water.", "Hope: Are you kidding me?!", "Liam: No. No, I'm not. She told me to keep going. She told me she was fine. I could tell she was in trouble.", "Hope: [Sighs] You jumped in to save her.", "Liam: I got her to shore, and at that point it was past 3:00. All I could do was run -- run and pray that you'd still be there. Nope. You weren't.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Look at you three -- so, uh, serious. This is a wedding celebration, not a funeral. Let's turn those frowns upside down for hope and Wyatt. Or not.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Let's go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Okay. Are you gonna be all right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: What did she mean, \"are you gonna be all right?\" You want to tell me what's going on?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Look who's leaving.", "Deacon: Brooke and Spencer are alone in the kitchen.", "Quinn: I wonder what they could be talking about.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Well, you obviously told Ridge and Katie that we're getting married. They didn't take it well. Come on, Brooke. I mean, we knew they wouldn't. They'll come around. In the meantime, everybody's pretty much cleared out, so let's get to my jet and fly to my yacht. What is it?", "Brooke: Ridge just confirmed something. He hasn't been the same since he fell.", "Bill: [Sighs] Let's not go back to that.", "Brooke: No, no, Bill. We have to. It's something he's struggling with.", "Bill: Well, I know that he -- he was struggling. I mean, it took him a while to recover. He had a little bit of memory loss. I feel badly about the part I played in that. Not that it's done any good, but I have apologized. Thankfully, he's back to his old self.", "Brooke: No. He's not.", "Bill: Wh-what do you mean?", "Brooke: [Sighs] He's not able to draw. His gift, his art -- it was taken from him... all because he fell out of a helicopter.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: Should we call Liam, let him know Wyatt's on his way?", "Ivy: Well, it probably doesn't matter at this point. I think we gave him enough time to tell hope.", "Aly: Liam was there for her in paris like hope asked. [Sighs] I wonder what she'll do now that she knows.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: I had been standing there for what seemed like an eternity.", "Liam: I-I know. I made a split-second decision, hope. I jumped in to help.", "Hope: I know. Of course you did. Of course you'd save her. I'm not surprised. But you have to understand that that doesn't change my perspective. It doesn't change what I was going through, because for me, I was looking for you. I was waiting for you. I was wondering where you were. \"Is he gonna show up? Is he t gonna show up?\" It's... when those 3:00 bells rang and you weren't there... that meant that I didn't matter to you. But Wyatt was there. He was there. Oh, God. And he didn't have to say a word to me. He -- he just looked at me and he saw how upset I was and suddenly, in that moment, it felt like you ever showing up was just ridiculous.", "Liam: I did show up. I was late, but I showed up.", "Hope: But I didn't know that.", "Liam: Yeah, well... now you know.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Wyatt: Hope...", "Hope: Yeah.", "Wyatt: The party's over. Come on, honey."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVmuhEJKuwo"}
