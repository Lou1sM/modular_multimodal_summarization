        "Thomas calls Sally and wishes her well at her showing tomorrow. He saw her designs and they look great. She says she knows he has a lot to deal with in New York but is there any chance he could be here tomorrow. He says sorry, he would if he could. But he cannot leave his son even one day. He will be there in spirit. Ridge asks Steffy if Thomas is going to be here. He and Sally were doing well so he is surprised that he picked up and practically moved to New York. Liam tells Bill that he hates to remind him of this but Jarrett thinks Sally does have talent and he has seen her designs and thinks the showing will go well. Bill may have to accept finding another spot for his skyscraper. Bill tells Justin that he already has plan B and it will start tonight. That showing will never happen. Liam tells Ridge and Steffy the same; Sally's designs are pretty damned good. He thinks she can give them a run for their money. Ridge says it sounds like he is rooting for her. Steffy adds that no matter how good they are, they will not be on Forrester's level. Liam assures them that his dad says he will not interfere this time. It was not okay before but they have all moved on from that. Without Thomas let's see if they are indeed up for the challenge.",
        "Sally thanks Coco for being there for moral support. She notices the fire extinguisher and they fill her in on the fire the day before. They cannot get any new wiring in meantime but have the extinguisher just in case. Coco tells Sally that even without Thomas she knows she can pull this off. No one, not even big bad Bill is going to stop her now. The non-electrician tells Sally that his suggestion is the same as yesterday \u0096 just turn off the power and get out of the building until they can get it re-wired. Bill tells Justin he wants the building gone. He wants it quick and clean and no one killed, but get rid of Spectra Fashions. He wants them to disappear. Sally tells her troops again she is so grateful for their never-ending support and they are all ready for tomorrow. Somehow they survived Bill the first time. Now is their big moment \u0096 Spectra Fashions is here to stay. They all grab their coats and purses to go out and celebrate, leaving Sally behind to turn out the lights and shut the door. Liam thanks Steffy for not being mad at him. He thinks Sally deserves her chance so let her do it without more interference from Bill. Suddenly as Bill broods but with a smile on his face, Spectra Fashions breaks out with a huge fire."

        "Bill: It's caroline. She's dying, thomas.",
        "Justin: A spark is dangerous, bill. Just ask liam. He put out the fire at the spectra building today.",
        "Bill: Electrical issues. Now that's something I hadn't thought of.",
        "Liam: [ Clears throat ] Hey, dad? Uh, did you, uh... did you get a chance to look at that proposal? The -- the hong kong investment?",
        "Bill: Not yet.",
        "Liam: Okay. Well, the meeting's this week.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I know. I'll look at it tonight.",
        "Liam: Good. You cool?",
        "Bill: As a cucumber.",
        "Liam: Spectra fashion show tomorrow.",
        "Bill: Yeah. That's right.",
        "Liam: Yeah, kind of a big deal, right? Determines whether or not you get to build your skyscraper where spectra's standing.",
        "Steffy: So, granddad and quinn are back together? Have you spoken to him?",
        "Ridge: Uh, I think it's gonna take a little while for the two of us.",
        "Steffy: Well, I have faith. If anyone can forgive, it's granddad. I still can't believe this is happening. So, wait. Granddad asked sheila to stay in the house with him and quinn?",
        "Ridge: I know. It's ridiculous. But, you know, maybe... maybe dad feels obligated in some way because sheila was there when he was missing in action.",
        "Steffy: She's like -- she's so weird.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. You don't have to convince me. But hopefully she'll be out of there soon.",
        "Steffy: Good riddance.",
        "Ridge: Speaking of missing in action, have you spoken to your brother?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Here and there.",
        "Ridge: \"Here and there\"? The spectra show is tomorrow. Is thomas gonna be there or not?",
        "Sally: Take those down to saul. [ Cellphone ringing ] Oh, I can't deal. Thomas?",
        "Thomas: Hey. Uh, I know you're busy getting ready for the showing. I just wanted to call and say good luck, and I wish I could be there.",
        "Sally: Me too. [ Sighs ] Did you get my e-mails? I sent you some pictures of my designs.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah, I did. They look amazing.",
        "Sally: I'm glad you think so. I gave liam and jarrett a preview, and I think they were pretty impressed.",
        "Thomas: Of course they were.",
        "Sally: I have a really good feeling about it. I think this line's gonna be a success.",
        "Thomas: I don't doubt it for a second. I've got total faith in you.",
        "Sally: Look, thomas, I know you have a lot to deal with back in new york, but is there any chance that you could be here tomorrow?",
        "Sally: So, what do you think? Is there any way? I would love it if you could be here.",
        "Thomas: I would if I could. But with caroline's illness, I... I just don't know how much more time she has left. And leaving new york right now, it just -- it wouldn't be right.",
        "Sally: It's just one day. I mean, you could be here by noon and head back on a red-eye.",
        "Thomas: I'm sorry, sally. I-I -- I can't leave right now. Being here with my son and caroline, the three of us together, it's been a really... a really great experience. But I want you to know that I will be thinking of you tomorrow, and I will be there with you in spirit.",
        "Sally: [ Scoffs ]",
        "Ridge: I just wanted to know if thomas was coming to the spectra show or not. What's this all about?",
        "Steffy: Dad, he's with douglas and caroline. What's more important than that?",
        "Ridge: Nothing is more important than that. I just know he was all gung ho on designing for spectra, and he and sally were doing pretty well, so I'm just a little surprised that he would pick up and go to new york, that's all.",
        "Steffy: Well, maybe he was reminded about his priorities. He's with his family, dad. And he's distancing himself from sally and spectra. Those aren't bad things.",
        "Ridge: No, I -- they're not bad things at all. I just -- I'm interested to see what's gonna happen tomorrow.",
        "Steffy: Well, whatever happens, it's all on sally.",
        "Ridge: If bill doesn't mess with her like he did last time.",
        "Liam: I hate to remind you of this, but... jarrett does think sally has real talent.",
        "Bill: Well, jarrett's been known to wear a kilt on occasion, so consider the source.",
        "Liam: Still. I've seen some of sally's designs, too, and I'm telling you, dad, they are going to be well-received. I'm just saying... prepare yourself. I know you don't want to hear this, but you may have to find another site to build your skyscraper. That's all. I mean, it never hurts to have a plan \"b,\" right?",
        "Justin: Liam.",
        "Liam: Hey, justin. How's it going?",
        "Justin: All right.",
        "[ Sighs ]",
        "Bill: I already have a plan \"B.\" And it starts tonight.",
        "Justin: If you want it to.",
        "Bill: We will put a stop to spectra. And make sure that fashion show never happens.",
        "Liam: Well, it was just me and jarrett, but I got to tell you, sally's designs are better than you'd think.",
        "Ridge: You mean they weren't terrible.",
        "Liam: No, I mean, they were actually pretty damn good.",
        "Ridge: Come on.",
        "Liam: [ Stammers ] Listen, I don't know what sally's been having for breakfast, but her designs have improved. Like, significantly. They're on- trend, they're relevant, they're even progressive. I'm just saying that, from what I've seen, I feel like sally could rival some of the top fashion houses on the west coast.",
        "Ridge: Wow. That good.",
        "Liam: I mean, even jarrett agrees.",
        "Steffy: But you've only seen a few pieces.",
        "Liam: No, that's true. I mean, the rest of them could be garbage. But I doubt it. I mean, sally's unpolished, and she's rough around the edges, but she knows what she's doing. And this thing, this... I don't know. It could be a win.",
        "Ridge: Is it just me, or does it sound like he's rooting for her?",
        "Steffy: [ Scoffs ]",
        "Liam: I-I wouldn't go that far.",
        "Steffy: You're always rooting for the underdog. Look, I don't care how good spectra designs are. They're never gonna be on forrester's level.",
        "Liam: Yeah, okay. Sure. But spectra's not going anywhere.",
        "Sally: Saul, you got to fix this hem.",
        "Saul: Already on it.",
        "Sally: Darlita, the seating chart?",
        "Darlita: Still working out the kinks.",
        "Sally: The show is tomorrow, people. Come on! We go to go.",
        "Shirley: Sally girl, stop worrying. It's all coming together. At least I hope so. Oh, darlita! Did the caterers call back?",
        "Darlita: Mm-hmm. They said no discounts.",
        "Shirley: How rude!",
        "Sally: It's fine, okay? We'll pay whatever we have to. I just want the show to be flawless.",
        "Coco: It will be.",
        "Sally: Thank you so much for being here, and for your moral support. What happened over there?",
        "Sally: Uh, we had a small fire.",
        "Coco: A fire?",
        "Shirley: Honey, you know, these vintage buildings, the wiring's at least 80 years old.",
        "Coco: That must have been so scary.",
        "Sally: It's fine. It really wasn't that big of a deal.",
        "Darlita: Liam spencer was here when it happened. He put it out with the fire extinguisher. Pretty much saved the day.",
        "Coco: Yeah, but, shouldn't you still get it looked at?",
        "Sally: We called a handyman, but we can't afford to get it fixed until after the showing.",
        "Saul: And we, uh -- we got that fire extinguisher just in case.",
        "Shirley: Come on, people. This showing is going to set spectra fashions ablaze! And no one is going to put that out.",
        "Saul: Yeah! Yeah, that's right!",
        "[ All cheering ]",
        "Justin: You really sure you want to do this?",
        "Bill: Have we met? I've waited long enough. I mean, I tried to be civil, but that glorified sweatshop is standing in my way. So no more being nice. I want every bit of dirt you have on that rat-infested heap of dust.",
        "Justin: I think you'll find that interesting. Check the date.",
        "Bill: It expired?",
        "Justin: Yeah.",
        "Bill: [ Laughs ] Well, that leaves them incredibly vulnerable, doesn't it?",
        "Justin: No insurance on the building. Garrison must not have renewed the policy.",
        "Bill: Apparently so. And that might just mean an end to spectra fashions.",
        "Liam: My dad says that he's not gonna interfere with spectra this time.",
        "Ridge: Well, if that's what your dad says, we've got to believe him.",
        "Liam: What do you want me to do? I have to believe him. I have to believe he's not gonna do more than he's already done.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, sometimes bill just can't help himself. Hopefully this will just play out on its own.",
        "Ridge: He can't what? He can't help himself? It was his review that broke sally. That's why she stole our designs and killed our whole collection. Does anybody else remember that?",
        "Liam: I know what sally did, to forrester and to your family, and I'm not condoning any of that. What she did, what my dad did, it was not okay, and I hope it never happens again. But... I think we've all kind of moved on from that, no?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Well, we know thomas has moved on. From sally and from spectra.",
        "Liam: Yeah... well, actually --",
        "Steffy: No, I'm sure thomas will come back eventually.",
        "Ridge: I just want to know what he's doing -- if he's gonna be with caroline in new york or if he's coming back here.",
        "Steffy: I don't think thomas even knows what the future holds.",
        "Liam: Well, either way, without thomas, it's gonna be a challenge. But let's see. Let's see if sally has what it takes to resurrect spectra all on her own.",
        "Sally: So, you haven't reconsidered. Can't you just fix it for cheap and patch it up?",
        "Pete: Like I told you yesterday, I'm not an electrician. You want my suggestion?",
        "Shirley: That's what we're paying ya for, ain't it?",
        "Pete: You should turn off the power to this entire building and go home. And don't come back until you can get these wires repaired.",
        "Saul: We can't do that. We have a fashion show tomorrow.",
        "Pete: Well, then I don't know what to tell you. But I'd get this fixed A.S.A.P.",
        "Sally: Okay. Yep. We will. Thank you.",
        "Saul: Well, that was, uh, pointless.",
        "Coco: Hey, do you guys want me to ask around and try to find an electrician?",
        "Sally: No. Thank you, coco. We'll be fine for one more day. We have way too much to do. Would you work with darlita on the guest list?",
        "Coco: Sure.",
        "Darlita: We're good. We've only got in a few no's so far. Everyone is super excited. We're gonna be the hottest ticket in town.",
        "Sally: Awesome! [ Laughs ] No pressure.",
        "[ Laughter ]",
        "Coco: You're gonna kill it tomorrow, sally. Like, I'm so proud of you for doing all this on your own.",
        "Sally: Well, I didn't really have a choice.",
        "Coco: Yeah, but you don't need thomas, or anyone else, to succeed. Like, I never doubted that. I always believed in you. And now you just get to show that to the entire world.",
        "Sally: God, I hope so.",
        "Coco: You will, sal. And there's nothing anyone could do to stop you. Not even big bad bill spencer.",
        "Bill: When I asked you to find me details, I didn't expect all this.",
        "Justin: Had to pull a few strings.",
        "Bill: Well-pulled.",
        "Justin: So, what's next?",
        "Bill: You tell me.",
        "Justin: We have a few options, a few different ways we could do this.",
        "Bill: I want the problem removed as quickly and cleanly as possible.",
        "Justin: Then there's really only one option.",
        "Bill: Do it.",
        "Justin: You know if we green-light this, there's no going back?",
        "Bill: I want the building gone. No one hurt. No one killed. But there can be nothing left of spectra fashions.",
        "Justin: I've already talked to someone.",
        "Bill: Well, it better be someone you can trust implicitly.",
        "Justin: Yes, but I need to ask this question again -- are you absolutely sure you want to do this, dollar bill?",
        "Bill: Make it happen, justin. I want spectra fashions to disappear.",
        "Saul: What do you think?",
        "Sally: Yes. Yes, yes! It is impeccable, saul. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Ah... [ Scoffs ] You guys are amazing. I am so proud of my troops.",
        "Shirley: Sally girl, we are proud of you, too, and everything you've accomplished. [ Sniffles ] My heart is so full, it's nigh on to busting.",
        "Sally: Oh! Grams, I would be nowhere without any of you. Seriously, I am -- I am in awe of everything we've built. I am so grateful for your never-ending support. I know you guys have been working nonstop for this, and... I'm sure you guys are ready for a break.",
        "Darlita: No way. Show's tomorrow. We're gonna crash here if we have to. Sleep on the couch or something.",
        "Sally: Okay, fine. We will pull another all-nighter. But at least please let me take you to dinner as a thank-you for all of your hard work.",
        "Saul: All right. I think we could, uh, manage that.",
        "Shirley: Right. Okay. We go get something to eat, then we come right back here and get to work.",
        "Sally: How did I get so lucky to have the best crew in the biz?",
        "Darlita: Sally, you are a fearless leader. We've always known you could do it.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, we got off to a rocky start.",
        "Saul: But that wasn't you. That was bill spencer.",
        "Sally: You know, I think about that a lot. Like, everything we could have accomplished if he hadn't hijacked our first preview.",
        "Saul: [ Sighs ]",
        "Sally: So many things would have been different. But, miraculously, somehow, we survived.",
        "Shirley: And here we are, on the eve of the biggest fashion show in spectra history.",
        "[ Cries ]",
        "Sally: Oh, this is our big moment. Finally being embraced by the fashion community. Spectra fashions is here to stay. A permanent fixture in the L.A. Fashion world. Got to feed my troops!",
        "Saul: [ Laughs ] Who's craving hot wings?",
        "Shirley: Aah!",
        "Darlita: Oh, whatever's fastest. I want to finish the playlist.",
        "Sally: Everything rests on these designs.",
        "Liam: No, no, no! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where do you think you're going? Where are you going? We're the only ones still here.",
        "Steffy: Okay! Some of us have to work.",
        "Liam: Yeah, work. I guess. Or -- or... we could stay here on the couch.",
        "Steffy: I'm totally game for that. Just forget about the stack of invoices over there.",
        "Liam: Invoices are lame.",
        "Together: So lame.",
        "Steffy: Well, thank you for staying here while I work.",
        "Liam: Sure. Thanks for...not being mad at me for supporting sally.",
        "Steffy: Well, that's what you do. You just always root for the little guy. Well, in this case, the fairly tall redheaded woman.",
        "Liam: I just... I don't know. I think everyone deserves their shot, and my dad has involved himself enough already. Let sally succeed on her own. Or fail miserably on her own. It doesn't matter. Just... let it be without any further manipulation from my father.",
