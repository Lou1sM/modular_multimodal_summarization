        "Brooke: Why was I so afraid? So afraid of being loved by you.",

        "Ridge: You're giving me an ultimatum?",
        "Taylor: I'm telling you that I feel like an outsider in my own marriage and I can't live like that. You know, it's like you haven't even made a decision. It's as if you're living here under duress with one foot out the door, I keep waiting for a phone call for you to tell me that you've moved back in with Brooke.",
        "Ridge: I'm trying here, Doc. I'm trying, at least give me credit for that.",
        "Taylor: But that's what I don't understand. Why? Why do you have to try so hard? I don't. My god, I'm even starting to understand Stephanie. Why she would think that someone would have to force you into making a decision because you can't make it on your own.",
        "Ridge: So you're trying to force me now? To do what?",
        "Taylor: I'm not trying to force you to do anything. I love you with all that I am. I'm trying desperately to save this marriage. I would like to hear that you want the same thing, but, so far, I haven't heard that. And I'm not sure if I'm going to.",

        "Nick: Why did you do this?",
        "Dante: Bridget, are you decent? Bridget?",
        "Bridget: Will Nick think I'm decent?",
        "Dante: Hey, you're bringing him good news.",
        "Bridget: After what I've done to him? Was that decent?",
        "Dante: He'll still want the child.",
        "Bridget: But will he still want me?",

        "Nick: We belong together, don't we?",
        "Brooke: Yes!",
        "Nick: Why didn't we see it? Why did everybody else see it but us?",
        "Brooke: Because we didn't allow ourselves to see it.",
        "Nick: Bridget --",
        "Brooke: You were committed to her, you loved her.",
        "Nick: All I wanted to do was make her happy. I didn't want her to feel one moment of pain.",
        "Brooke: I know --",
        "Nick: Or you.",
        "Brooke: And you haven't. You couldn't. You won't.",
        "Nick: You know that, don't you? You know that.",
        "Brooke: I feel it. Right here.",
        "Nick: A heart's a fragile thing.",
        "Brooke: Yes. And that's why I trust mine to you.",
        "Nick: You gotta help me with this. After what we've been through, why now? Why is this happening now? Why?",
        "Brooke: I don't know. I don't know, but I finally see it for what it really is. It's love. It's love.",
        "Nick: Do you really love me? Do you?",
        "Brooke: Yes. Yes, I do. I really do love you.",
        "Nick: You don't know what it feels like for me to hear you say that. I've loved you from the first moment I met you. You're the love of my life. And I'm not letting you go this time. I'll never let you go, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: What if he never forgives me.",
        "Dante: You needed to be sure of him.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, but the look on his face should have been enough. How could I do that to him? I told him I had an abortion.",
        "Dante: You saw something between your mother and Nick, and that scared the hell out of you.",
        "Bridget: Yeah.",
        "Dante: But let's be real about this, okay? We both know it's gonna happen again.",
        "Bridget: You don't think that Catherine was right?",
        "Dante: I'm not saying that. You wanted to be satisfied. So be satisfied. Bridget, your mother was his first love. Let's not forget that. And there are some people in this world that, once you love them, you're stuck. Your wishes may fade away. The things you used to say to each other can't be the same things anymore. But in here -- in here stays the same. There's no harm in that. There's no danger. You just learn how not to love them.",

        "Ridge: Sorry I'm making you so unhappy.",
        "Taylor: That's a cop-out, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: I just need some more time, Taylor.",
        "Taylor: Do you know how disrespected that makes me feel? You are the only man I have ever truly loved. I just told you that you're",
        "Taylor: Do you know how disrespected that makes me feel? You are the only man I have ever truly loved. I just told you that you're hurting me. And then you tell me to just wait it out and see if it goes away?",
        "Ridge: Why is it okay for you to say what you need, but it's not okay for me?",
        "Taylor: Okay, then, what are we waiting for? For you to be able to commit to me?",
        "Ridge: We're married, Taylor. I think that's one hell of a commitment.",
        "Taylor: Yes, you said the words, but we all know how that came about.",
        "Ridge: I've been true to those words.",
        "Taylor: Ridge, marriage is a commitment that you get up and you make all over again every day. If you still have your identity in being Brooke's husband, then you can't do that. If you can't put the energy you gave that relationship into this relationship -- instead of mourning and grieving it all the time -- then we are just spinning our wheels here.",
        "Ridge: Just stop diagnosing me, will you? I'm your husband, not your patient. You're laying down conditions here and I don't like it. Taylor, I don't want it to be this way between us.",
        "Taylor: Neither do I.",
        "Ridge: I never stopped loving you. Even when I thought I'd never see you again. Maybe I am grieving a little here -- for a life that I had that you never saw. How could you sympathize. Grieving -- grieving can't be rushed. Losing you taught me that.",
        "Taylor: Well, thank you. At least that's something to go on. So you do feel forced into being with me again?",
        "Ridge: No, I didn't say that.",
        "Taylor: Ridge, we need somebody to help us get through this. We need someone to help us understand each other again.",
        "Ridge: Marriage counseling? No. Thank you, but no thank you. Get enough of that at home.",
        "Taylor: Then I see only one other option.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, what's that.",

        "Brooke: Bridget?",
        "Nick: I'm gonna get it. Hello.",
        "Bridget: It's me.",
        "Nick: I know.",
        "Bridget: Are you out in the storm?",
        "Nick: It's the wind going through the rigging. I'm on the boat.",
        "Bridget: I need to see you.",
        "Nick: Why?",
        "Bridget: There's just some things that I need to say -- not on the phone.",
        "Nick: Me, too. Where are you?",
        "Bridget: I'm with Dante. Don't worry, I'm much saner now. He's been taking care of me.",
        "Nick: I'm glad.",
        "Bridget: So, I'll be right over.",
        "Nick: She's coming over.",
        "Brooke: What are you going to say to her?",
        "Nick: Well, I'm not going to hold anything back. Look where that's gotten us.",
        "Brooke: Nick, do you really think we should do this now?",
        "Nick: Not \"we\" Brooke. I have to do this. I have to.",
        "Brooke: She's still hurting. And so are you. It's just too soon.",
        "Nick: Or too late, depending how you look at it. She knows there's no going back, that's not why she's coming here. Now if we're going to find any peace in this mess, it's not going to happen overnight. But if it's gonna happen, it has start now.",
        "Brooke: I don't know, something keeps telling me not to leave you.",
        "Nick: I don't want to leave you for one second, not one second. But you know what, we got the rest of our lives together.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, the rest of our lives. You promise.",
        "Nick: I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You want me to leave?",
        "Taylor: I suggested counseling and you don't want any part of it.",
        "Ridge: I told you why.",
        "Taylor: And I told you that I can't live like this.",
        "Ridge: So this is payback? Is that what this is?",
        "Taylor: Payback?",
        "Ridge: Look, I can't defend putting you and Brooke in competition. That was wrong. It was stupid. There are no self-help books in this situation here. I know you resented being put in the running with someone so beneath you, but now it just seems like you want me to know that you're in a position to reject me.",
        "Taylor: I don't know what to make of that version of me. I really don't, Ridge. See, these are the things a counselor needs to hear.",
        "Ridge: I don't buy that. I don't think you really want counseling. I think you just want somebody in the room that thinks the way you do, to take your side and tell me I'm wrong.",
        "Taylor: Are you leaving something out of this equation? That I love you? And that you mean the world to me.",
        "Ridge: Well then why can't you give me some more space here? A little more understanding? And definitely some more time.",
        "Taylor: Because you're not my patient. You are my life. I can't be clinically detached from the man that I love when -- you know, I'm starting to lose respect for you, Ridge. I'm starting to lose respect for myself. I know what I can live with, and I know what I can't live with. And this, I can't. Okay, if you think that marriage counseling is a way for me to have some sort of home court advantage, fine. Whatever. But at least you could go and you could sort through these conflicting feelings you have.",
        "Ridge: Go where?",
        "Taylor: To get some one-on-one counseling, Ridge. At least you would be showing me that you're committed to changing this situation.",
        "Ridge: So I'm the one who's damaged, who needs to be sent out for repairs?",
        "Taylor: Now you're deliberately misunderstanding me.",
        "Ridge: Taylor, what if you don't like the results? What if the degree of \"repair\" on me doesn't suit you? It might not you know. After all my father turned out not to be my father. My wife turned out not to be my wife, because my dead wife turned out to be alive. Apparently, my mother wrote the book on guilt-tripping her son. I don't think I really need a shrink to tell me I might be a little bit damaged.",
        "Taylor: Am I losing you?",
        "Ridge: You just asked me to leave. And now you're asking me if you're losing me? Come one here, what's going on?",
        "Taylor: I know that distance alone is not going to fix everything. But, Ridge, I just can't keep living here, and watching, and feeling myself lose you in this house, and in our bed. If you need space and you need time, I want you to take all you need.",
        "Ridge: I'll leave tonight. You want to tell the kids together?",
        "Taylor: God, no. No, I can't do that. I can't go through that right now. I'll talk to them tomorrow. I'll talk to them later.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You look better. Wet, but better.",
        "Bridget: You don't.",
        "Nick: A lot's happened.",
        "Bridget: Baby, look, I know there's no excuse for what I did to you.",
        "Nick: I don't want to do that.",
        "Bridget: Do what?",
        "Nick: I don't want to make little prepared speeches that aren't true. You thought you had a reason.",
        "Bridget: I lost my mind a little bit.",
        "Nick: Well, I can take some responsibility for that. I waited too long to tell you that you weren't wrong about your mother and me. I loved you too much to see it myself.",
        "Bridget: I think I understand all that a little better now.",
        "Nick: It's important to me that you know that what you thought was going on behind your back never happened.",
        "Bridget: I believe you. Nothing will ever justify what I did to you. I know I caused you the worst possible pain.",
        "Nick: So we start fresh. I want a life I'm happy with. And I want you to find that, too.",
        "Bridget: I have. The life inside of me.",
        "Nick: No, there's no looking back here. Now, what's done is done.",
        "Bridget: No sweetheart. It's not. I lied -- I lied to you.",
        "Nick: Well, we both said things that we didn't mean.",
        "Bridget: No, Nick. I know I told you that I had an abortion, but I didn't. I'm still carrying your child. I'm still carrying our child."
