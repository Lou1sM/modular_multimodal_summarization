    ],
    "Recap": [
        "Liam demands Ivy to take one of two options; delete the video or give it to the police. He wants her to do the right thing and save Steffy from going to prison. He reminds her if she did turn the video into the police the entire Forrester family would villify her around here. Her life would never be the same. She holds up the phone again and says this image would suggest otherwise, that Steffy is guilty. Ridge knows something is wrong for Steffy to turn down being the face of Forrester and giving it to Ivy. He wants her to share her feelings so he can help. In Ridge's apartment Caroline helps Thomas with a design and he moves closer to her but all he can think of is his kissing her previously. He explains about Steffy turning down the job as the face of Forrester. She is glad he can talk to her about this. Likewise Thomas is glad that she can talk to him candidly about wanting children and perhaps Ridge not wanting them.",
        "Quinn looks confused and hopes Wyatt is not becoming cynical. She does not understand Ivy suddenly becoming the face of Forrester. Wyatt says she has been overlooked for a while and now Ivy is holding the winning ticket and he is going along for the ride. Steffy asks Ridge to please drop this, her mind is made up. Finally he says he will speak with Ivy and try to make her understand and they will find someone else. Steffy adamantly says no, it has to be Ivy. Quinn feels like Wyatt is up to something with Poison Ivy. She knows he charms people. He isn't suspicious, he just wants to be happy. He explains that Ivy just got a promotion and he won't be far behind. They have looked the other way far too many times. Ivy tells Liam that once again he is being super hero. She fell in the Seine and he rescued her and now he is doing the same with Steffy. Unlike him though, she knows the meaning of loyalty and she will not let Aly die in vain. She wants him to go home and confess to the police. Steffy belongs in a court room for what she did. Thomas is joking with Caroline about painting her as they look at Ridge's drawing. She hopes Thomas does not mean nude. He says yeah from another angle and he is drawing a big old smiley face and both are laughing when Ridge walks in. Ivy doesn't know which hurts more; Liam siding with Steffy or just not wanting to admit the truth about the video. Perhaps they do need an objective third party, the police. Steffy asks Liam how it went and he says not good, but he is not through with this yet. Wyatt is shocked that Liam didn't take the bait, but then he is an idiot. Ivy wants to make a pact. They have been neglected and ignored and shoved aside and yet they hold the power. Wyatt says she deserves everything and holds the key to that door and it is time to open some. She wants the same for him and they kiss."

        "Liam: So, you delete the video or you take it to the police, but those are the only two options, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Wow. I didn't know you were such a risk taker.",
        "Liam: I jumped in the seine to save you, didn't I?",
        "Ivy: That feels like a million years ago.",
        "Liam: Okay. You want a more recent option? How about marrying you to keep you in the country?",
        "Ivy: See, that -- that's the bigger risk, because you didn't even really love me.",
        "Liam: That's not true.",
        "Ivy: Liam, not like how you love Steffy. And now you need me to save her from a prison sentence.",
        "Liam: I need you to do what's right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You know I'm here for you, right?",
        "Steffy: Always.",
        "Ridge: So, whatever you're going through...",
        "Steffy: Dad, I just -- I don't want you to worry about this, okay?",
        "Ridge: I can't not worry about you. I can't fathom that you would turn down being the face of Forrester and try to give it to Ivy. What is that?",
        "Steffy: I think it's for the best.",
        "Ridge: The best for whom?",
        "Steffy: For me. Just trust me on this, okay?",
        "Ridge: I know you're struggling, and it's not just because of your cousin's death, but it -- something's bothering you, and I know it is. Tell me what I can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: It's different, Thomas, but the California Freedom line is just that. It's...free. So, no constraints. You know, so I think what we should do is we should, uh -- we should lose the sleeves. And then actually drop the neckline in it. You don't like it?",
        "Thomas: No, no, no. It's fine.",
        "Caroline: You were just, like, shaking your head. It's...",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] That's something else.",
        "Caroline: Steffy?",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] No.",
        "Caroline: Because I think that Steffy would look great in this, you know, as the face of Forrester.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, yeah. About that -- um, Steffy turned it down.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Thomas: She handed the position over to Ivy. And I think we both know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: So much better in natural light.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. What can I say? My mother's a genius.",
        "Quinn: Ha! Tell that to your girlfriend. I wonder if she'll approve now that she's the new face of Forrester.",
        "Wyatt: Seriously?",
        "Quinn: How did she manage to pull that off anyway?",
        "Wyatt: Careful, Mom. You're becoming like the rest of them.",
        "Quinn: Like the rest of who? What? The Forresters?",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Quinn: Please. I'd have to win the lottery to have that happen.",
        "Wyatt: It's not about money. It's about entitlement -- the right to choose because of your last name.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] You are becoming so cynical.",
        "Wyatt: I wonder where I got that.",
        "Quinn: And you think your girlfriend deserves to be a top model?",
        "Wyatt: I do. Because she's been passed over, just like me, but not anymore. She holds the winning ticket, and I'm just...going along for the ride.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Steffy handed it over just like that?",
        "Thomas: She didn't have a choice.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Ivy can't expect to just stay in that position like that.",
        "Thomas: Oh, with what she has on that video...",
        "Caroline: Ivy's blackmailing her?",
        "Thomas: The only reason Steffy went along with that. Either that or a possibly murder charge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You're a tough cookie. And I can be tough, too, when I have to be. So, I think between the two of us, we can figure this out and we can fix it. But you're keeping something from me.",
        "Steffy: Dad, please don't pressure me. My cousin is dead. I was there when she left us. [Sighs] I just need to recover from this, okay? From all of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You want me to do what's right for Steffy, not me and certainly not Aly.",
        "Liam: Aly is no longer with us.",
        "Ivy: I know. Thanks to your girlfriend.",
        "Liam: Ivy, ha-have you even thought about what it would mean to turn that video over to the police? Your life here would never be the same. I mean, every -- every member of this family would vilify you. Is that what you want? You want to forever be the person who put Steffy in prison?",
        "Ivy: God, you just -- you love her so much. You're happy for her to escape justice, aren't you?",
        "Liam: No, no, no, no, no. Because Steffy did not commit murder.",
        "Ivy: See this? It suggests otherwise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Sounds to me like you're all in with this Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: We're working on something.",
        "Quinn: Here at Forrester?",
        "Wyatt: No more questions, your honor. I plead the fifth.",
        "Quinn: Okay. You know what?",
        "Wyatt: Mm?",
        "Quinn: I hope you're at least getting something out of this situation.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I am.",
        "Quinn: I mean more than that.",
        "Wyatt: We'll see.",
        "Quinn: Ever since you and Ivy have hooked up, you've been on some sort of a mission. But it seems to me like Ivy's the only one getting any of the benefits from it.",
        "Wyatt: Because she deserves it, Mom.",
        "Quinn: More than you?",
        "Wyatt: Hey. I'll have my moment. Trust me.",
        "Quinn: Oh...there you go again with the cryptic comments. Something is going on. Tell me what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Do you really think that Steffy could be prosecuted?",
        "Thomas: If I were a cop and I saw Ivy's video, I might go straight to the DA.",
        "Caroline: And she -- [Sighs] She doesn't want to tell your dad?",
        "Thomas: I know I put you in the middle of this. And I'm sorry about that.",
        "Caroline: I promised that I wouldn't say anything, and I-I'm glad that you came to me. I mean, somebody's got to look out for your dad. It might as well be me, right?",
        "Thomas: Right.",
        "Caroline: And I-I'm -- I am glad that I confided in you, too.",
        "Thomas: About...wanting a family?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I mean, it's just something I try...not to think about. [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: It's the hardest thing not to think about.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, but it helps when you have somebody to talk to, you know, somebody you trust.",
        "Thomas: That's me. Professional sounding board.",
        "Caroline: Oh, God. Am I that bad?",
        "Thomas: No, no, no, no. I-I'm kidding. [Chuckles] Seriously. But...I-I do think your wanting a family is something that my father needs to consider.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I'm sorry, Dad. I know it's tough. You're wanting to protect a daughter who does not want to be protected.",
        "Ridge: It's tough protecting your daughter if you don't know what you're protecting her from.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God.",
        "Ridge: This whole thing with Aly, it --",
        "Steffy: No, Dad. We know, okay? She attacked me. I get it. [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: It wasn't your fault. Hey. I can't tell you how to grieve. I'm not. We all do that in our own way and our own time, but --",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: She put that on herself. You got to know that, right? You do know that.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: So, you got to just try to move past that horrible night, move past it and keep going. Or tell me why you can't.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] I just need to resolve this, okay?",
        "Ridge: But maybe doing this job would give you the time to --",
        "Steffy: Dad, no. Come on.",
        "Ridge: At least agree with me that Ivy's the wrong person for it.",
        "Steffy: Please don't do this. Please.",
        "Ridge: I'm not. I'm just -- just take some time. Can't you just take a few weeks, think about it? I really do believe it'd be good for you. It'll pull you out of this thing. And I'll talk to Ivy. She'll understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I don't know what hurts more -- you defending Steffy or your complete refusal to see the truth.",
        "Liam: The truth?!",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: The truth is that Aly had been planning to murder her. Steffy was fighting for her life.",
        "Ivy: How can you even say that once you've seen this video? Steffy hits Aly with a tire iron.",
        "Liam: You were there! You know for a fact there was more to it than that.",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, then should we watch the video again? Because clearly there is something in this that I'm missing, that I don't see.",
        "Liam: You know what? I don't care. Just because the video looks bad --",
        "Ivy: \"Looks bad?\" It's a murder in progress, Liam. God, you're just -- you're in such denial. I've never seen this side of you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, I've never seen this side of you. So eager to stand in judgment.",
        "Ivy: You know what? At least my judgment is based on evidence. Your judgment is based on obsession. You don't want to believe that Steffy is capable of doing anything wrong, even when it's right here in front of you. So, maybe you're right. Maybe we do need an objective third party to make a decision on this. How about we go to the police?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Dad, I told you. I don't want to be the face of Forrester.",
        "Ridge: But we need you.",
        "Steffy: No. You need Ivy.",
        "Ridge: Ivy. No. What? Ivy is good. She's beautiful. She's talented. But she's not you. And I really think this would help you just kind of get out of where you are right now.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. I won't do it, okay? I won't.",
        "Ridge: I'll find somebody else.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no, no. No, you let Ivy do it.",
        "Ridge: What is up -- what is all this talk about Ivy?",
        "Steffy: Because she lost her best friend, okay? She's suffering.",
        "Ridge: We're all suffering!",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but she is suffering worse.",
        "Ridge: I'm lost. You and Thomas -- I don't get either one of you guys.",
        "Steffy: I don't -- I didn't -- I didn't mean to upset you.",
        "Ridge: I'm not upset. I'm...just worried about you.",
        "Steffy: No, I'm -- I'm fine. I'm fine. Didn't I, uh, hear you tell Caroline you'd be home soon?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I can't criticize him. He's...a great father.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I mean, he's just kind of, uh... been there, done that.",
        "Thomas: Right. Don't blame him. Steffy, Phoebe, and I were, uh, a handful.",
        "Caroline: Oh, I doubt that.",
        "Thomas: Steffy way more than me.",
        "Caroline: Now I doubt that even more.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] Well, one thing's for sure. You're gonna make a hell of a mom.",
        "Caroline: Mm. That's really, really sweet. Just so long as I have a son, not a daughter.",
        "Thomas: Why? Girls are awesome.",
        "Caroline: Girls are awesome.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: I am someone's daughter. But I just don't want to put anybody through that, especially not me.",
        "Thomas: It's called karma, Caroline. You're definitely gonna have a daughter.",
        "Caroline: No!",
        "Thomas: Sorry.",
        "Caroline: Oh, God! [Chuckles] Honestly, I-I would just happily give Ridge either one.",
        "Thomas: So, bring it up with him. He's reasonable. Sometimes.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Your father is not...a talking-about-the-future kind of a guy. He's more of a right-now guy.",
        "Thomas: What if right now sucks?",
        "Caroline: How could right now suck? He has me in his life.",
        "Thomas: Oh, so true. So true.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] He just kind of likes to live in the moment.",
        "Thomas: It's easy for him to say. Not really sure where that leaves you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Is something going on? Of course. Ivy's about to be a spokeswoman, and I'm just hanging on to her coattails.",
        "Quinn: You have never hung on to anyone's coattails before, and you're avoiding my question.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not like you, Mom. When you are happy, I get suspicious. When I'm happy --",
        "Quinn: You're usually charming someone, and I got to say, I don't feel so charmed right now.",
        "Wyatt: It's not working?",
        "Quinn: Not even a little bit. No. You're up to something.",
        "Wyatt: [Groans]",
        "Quinn: You and your poison Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Hey. Ivy just got a big promotion, and hopefully I'm on my way to one, too. 'Cause this is our time -- Ivy's and mine. We have lost out to Steffy and Liam way too much already. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I'm sorry.",
        "Ivy: Sorry for what?",
        "Liam: For hurting you so much that you have to act out like this.",
        "Ivy: Liam, I am not acting out.",
        "Liam: The Ivy Forrester I know would not commit blackmail.",
        "Ivy: No. The Ivy Forrester you knew got stepped on, and then her best friend died.",
        "Liam: I didn't mean to step on you.",
        "Ivy: I trusted you, Liam. I gave you my love. That was huge for me.",
        "Liam: I know it was.",
        "Ivy: Look, you're just doing what you always do for women. You play the superhero, the rescuer. You know, I-I fall into the Seine, and you jump in after me and save me. And now you're doing the exact same thing for Steffy. She's in a fix, so you're trying to help her avoid justice. You just ride in on your white horse and save the day. Well, guess what, Liam. It's not gonna happen this time. Because unlike you, I know the definition of loyalty, and I will not let Aly die in vain. So, if you really want to do what's right, you go home, and you convince Steffy to confess to the police. And you'd better do it soon, because time is running out and so is my patience. Your girlfriend belongs in a courtroom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: It's good.",
        "Thomas: Don't patronize me, woman.",
        "Caroline: I didn't say it was great.",
        "Thomas: Wow. Please. No, patronize me. Go for it.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] It's just I know what your dad likes, and...this business here -- it's -- it's very cool, but...",
        "Thomas: He's gonna hate it. Probably.",
        "Caroline: Probably he's gonna hate it. [Laughs]",
        "Thomas: [Groans]",
        "Caroline: Listen. No. You just have to give him what he wants, and then once you're on the design team, then you can go all crazy.",
        "Thomas: Like he did when he painted that one?",
        "Caroline: Yes. We -- we did, uh...[Chuckles] Loosen up a bit that day.",
        "Thomas: Oh, yeah. You loosened something up. That's for sure.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs] Do you paint?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, a little.",
        "Caroline: Do you want to show me?",
        "Thomas: Tell you what. Let's do one of those.",
        "Caroline: A nude?",
        "Thomas: No, no, no. Different angle. Uh, the other side of Caroline Spencer -- her... [Clears throat] Crazy side.",
        "Caroline: Oh.",
        "Thomas: Strike a pose?",
        "Caroline: You mean like this?",
        "Thomas: Ooh! How long can you hold that?",
        "Caroline: This one?",
        "Thomas: Oh, yeah. That's it right there. Hold that. Hold that.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] I can't.",
        "Thomas: No, no. Hold it.",
        "Caroline: It's awful!",
        "Thomas: Hold it!",
        "Caroline: I can't! I've already quit!",
        "Thomas: No, no! I've got it.",
        "Caroline: What is this?",
        "Thomas: It's you.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs] Why would you even get a brush that big to do it?",
        "Thomas: It's a great shot.",
        "Ridge: [Clears throat] What's going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I thought you were gonna ask about how it went with Ivy as soon as I walked through the door.",
        "Steffy: Priorities first. Now... how did it go?",
        "Liam: Not good.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God.",
        "Liam: I'm sorry.",
        "Steffy: No. What am -- what am I gonna do?",
        "Liam: We. We. And we're not giving up on this.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] All right. All right. And it's not gonna be easy. My dad is pressuring me. He knows that something's up. Like, I-I feel like I'm being squeezed from every angle, and I haven't even mourned my cousin's death. Every time I try to think about Aly, I keep thinking about is threats and blackmail. Oh, my God. I just want to let this go, and I want to move on with my life.",
        "Liam: Our life. And we will, Steffy. We will. I promise we'll figure something out. It's just -- Ivy is so wrong, and she doesn't even know it. It's like she's a different person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: And you didn't take his bait?",
        "Ivy: Well, no, but Liam didn't make it easy. He kept trying to act like he could dictate terms. And then when he realized that that wasn't working, he tried the whole guilt-trip thing on me, and he said that my life around here is gonna be horrible if I take that video to the police.",
        "Wyatt: You mean he didn't want you telling the truth?",
        "Ivy: He's trying to scare me. Trying to.",
        "Wyatt: Of course, he is. 'Cause he's an idiot.",
        "Ivy: Hey, do you want to make a pact?",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Ivy: We have the power here, Wyatt. We're the ones holding the loaded gun. We've been pushed to the side for far too long. We've been neglected. We've been ignored. I mean, look. Look at you. Look what you did for the Hope for the Future diamond line. I mean, you put jewelry on the map for Forrester Creations. And then what did you get for it?",
        "Wyatt: I know, but what about you? Why shouldn't you have your moment in the spotlight?",
        "Ivy: Well, we know why. It's because I'm not Ridge's daughter. But I hold the key to her fate.",
        "Wyatt: And we should use that key to open some doors, don't you think? I want you to have that. I want you to have everything, you know?",
        "Ivy: I want that for you, too, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm."
