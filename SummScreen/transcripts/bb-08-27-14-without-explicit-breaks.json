        "Brooke helps Hope pack to move into Wyatt's house. She tells her mother that she can't believe that Liam was in Paris. Brooke says yeah it sounds crazy but he was there, Ivy fell into the Seine and Hope married Wyatt. That is what happened. Hope admits it is messing with her head. There is so much history there, but she is married to Wyatt now. She doesn't know what she is gonna do. At SP Liam tries to concentrate but all he can think about is Paris and Hope slipping away. Quinn asks Wyatt if Hope is at his place moving in. He should be with her. He said she needed time with her mother. She quips as he needed time with his. She thought her presence at the party went over well with the evil Quinn back in the mix with the Forrester's. He reminds her that it was only one party and she was only there because she is his mother. He says there is something he needs to tell her about Liam .he was in Paris. She acts surprised. He says Liam had every intention of meeting Hope at 3 o'clock but had to rescue a damsel in distress. Quinn mocks a typical Liam. He needs to be a gracious loser and go away. She says the best thing Wyatt did was get Hope out of Paris and onto that yacht. Liam needs to mind his own business and stay out of Wyatt's. Wyatt says that makes two of them. He needs her to stay away from Liam. The truth is he would not even be married if Hope knew Liam was there. Aly confides in Ivy that she is glad Liam told Hope that he was in Paris, it will change everything. Ivy is not so sure it matters now. Hope might struggle over what did happen but at the end of the day she is still married to Wyatt. She knows Hope's sense of morality so she hopes she honors her commitment. Aly can't believe all of this was caused by some thoughtless stranger. She asks if Ivy knows who bumped her. Ivy says no but she thinks it was a woman. Who knew it would turn into this. Even though she told Liam to leave her and go on to Hope she knew he wouldn't. There was no way he would leave her. Aly senses that Ivy really likes Liam and says she can tell her. Ivy admits she kissed Liam in Paris; just a friendly peck but she can't deny she felt something. Aly says well Liam is available now, so what's next. Ivy says there is a party on at Bikini and a lot at the office will be going. She is thinking of inviting Liam. Quinn tells Wyatt not to say that. Liam will never be half the man that Wyatt is. Wyatt tells her do not talk about Liam and do not do anything to him. He wants her to be clear about that. She replies that she may hate the little creep but she is not going to make it her life's work to torture him. Wyatt says good, that is the last thing he needs right now. Quinn tells him not to second guess Hope. She married him. The diamond brought them back together again. He tells her the police are still asking questions about Ricardo's death. She says total waste of taxpayer's money. He asks her to promise him that she had nothing to do with that. She said she already promised him that. He says okay. The diamond did bring them back together but he just wanted to be sure it was the diamond and not her doings.",
        "Deacon brings in the cat for Hope; says he missed his mommy. She holds and cuddles him. Deacon says he is no mind reader but he senses something is off here and he wants to help. Hope says there was a little mix-up in Paris, a misunderstanding on her part. She says turns out that Liam was in Paris after all to meet her. But he was delayed by a good reason; the best reason of all by saving Ivy's life. She says she is so proud of Liam. Chivalry is not dead; he is a hero. She was so lucky to have him in her life. Ivy knocks on Liam's door at SP and asks if she is interfering. He says no; he was finding it hard to even concentrate. She says that is because he was looking at the wrong thing. She has some photos that Oliver took that she'd like included in her layout. Liam takes them and tells her she is very talented and they are gorgeous .every bit as good as Quinn. She says Quinn may not be the nicest person in the world but she does know her way around jewelry. He says by the way; he knows what she is doing. He thinks it is very sweet of her to come here to check up on him. He thanks her for having his back and assures her he is going to be okay. Hope married his brother so you talk about moving on Ivy says that doesn't mean that Hope's feelings are all resolved. She talked to Hope when the party was winding down and she knows that she is still in love with Liam. He says shoulda, woulda, coulda, she has to stop blaming herself. She did not jump in the river. It was an accident. He was late but Hope could have waited a few more minutes. She chose not to. And she was not forced but she married Wyatt. She made all those decisions with her eyes wide open and if he is to move forward he has to accept that. Wyatt tells his mother he needs to know that Hope married him out of choice and not because of her. She says Hope married him because she loves him; it's that simple. He hopes she means that. She assures him that she wants to work her way back into the Forrester family not by scheming but proving she is a worthy person. He says he wants her in his life, as Hope's MIL and their children's grandmother but she has to fit in a functional way. He will not have his family be in constant chaos because of her. She says okay. Is the lecture done as she has something for him. She's beside herself with giddy joy. She hands him a velvet pouch. He looks inside and says thanks. He tells him to go to Hope; she is his wife. Hope tells Deacon that she made vows to Wyatt and she meant them. Brooke adds that she wouldn't have if Liam had made it there on time. Deacon says these things can happen all the time and if you can't fix it or change it back then you just have to accept it and move ahead with the choices that she did make. She tells them thanks. She just needs some time alone. Wyatt comes home and sits with her on the bed. He says it feels good coming home to her, being married. Ivy asks Liam if he is still feeling sad. He says somewhat as Hope was such a constant in his life for so long. It's going to feel really weird without her. Ivy says perhaps she can help him with that. At the risk of sounding terribly improper she wants to know what he is doing tomorrow night. There is an end of summer party at Bikini and she thought he might like to go. He says yeah, why not. Wyatt tells Hope that he has something for her from his mother. And not to worry it's safe. They got married so fast they sort of skipped a few beats. He pours the contents out in her hand and it is two matching wedding bands ..pounded pewter. He slips hers on and says \"with this ring I pledge my life to you.\" As she puts his on, she chuckles that she commits herself to him, her husband ..from this day on rocking and rolling wherever life takes them. He says he loves her and gives her a big hug."

        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: I know you're confused.",
        "Hope: I can't believe that Liam was there. He was there in paris on his way to the Eiffel tower, where we were supposed to meet!",
        "Brooke: Nobody could have predicted that Ivy would fall into the seine and Liam would be there to save her. And then you and Liam missed each other, and you married Wyatt. I mean, it sounds crazy, and it's unbelievable, but it's what happened.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: So, hope is at your place moving in?",
        "Wyatt: That's the idea.",
        "Quinn: You should be with her.",
        "Wyatt: Wanted to spend some time with her mom.",
        "Quinn: Oh! And you wanted to spend some time with yours. You know, I think my presence went over quite well at the party. Me and evil Quinn back in the mix with the Forresters.",
        "Wyatt: It's only for one party, mom, and it was because you're my mother.",
        "Quinn: And hope is your wife. It's been a long time coming.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: How do you feel? Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: There's something I got to tell you about Liam and paris.",
        "Quinn: Tell me.",
        "Wyatt: He was there.",
        "Quinn: In paris?",
        "Wyatt: Yep, with every intention of meeting hope at 3:00.",
        "Quinn: Why didn't he?",
        "Wyatt: Because super Liam had to rescue a damsel in distress.",
        "Aly: I am so glad Liam told hope he was in paris.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, it had to be done. I don't think it's gonna make much of a difference, though.",
        "Aly: It changes everything, now that hope knows Liam came to meet her.",
        "Ivy: Hope might struggle with what might have been, but at the end of the day, she's married to Wyatt now. I just hope she honors her commitment. You know what kind of woman hope is. Her sense of morality. Do you think she would go back on her vows to Wyatt?",
        "Aly: I feel so awful for Liam. Coming so close to finally marrying hope after everything they've been through, and it's ruined by some thoughtless stranger. Did you see whoever bumped you?",
        "Ivy: No. But I am pretty sure it was a woman.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Typical Liam. You are married to hope. Why can't he just be a gracious loser and go away?",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: It was a party to celebrate your wedding, and he had to lay some massive guilt trip on hope? [Sighs] The best thing you ever did is rush her out of paris and on to that yacht. My baby got married on the Spencer yacht. [Chuckles] Why can't he mind his own business and stay out of yours?",
        "Wyatt: Well, that makes two of you. I mean it, mom. Stay away from Liam. Because the truth of the matter is, hope and I wouldn't even be married if she knew Liam was there.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: Knowing Liam was there is -- it's really messing with my head.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I understand, sweetie.",
        "Hope: There's just so much history there.",
        "Brooke: I know. It's hard to accept when you've invested so much love and so much...",
        "Hope: But I'm married to Wyatt, and...",
        "Brooke: Yeah. So, what do you do?",
        "Hope: I don't know.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Deacon: You guys, I'm here!",
        "Hope: Hey! We're in here!",
        "Deacon: Somebody wanted to see his new home.",
        "Hope: Hi, my little love.",
        "Deacon: Missed his mommy.",
        "Brooke: The kitty that you and Liam rescued.",
        "Hope: I missed you, too. Hi, baby.",
        "Brooke: Cute.",
        "Deacon: Welcome home, kitty.",
        "Hope: Hi, my sweet man.",
        "[Light laughter]",
        "Aly: Okay, so I have come to a decision. I think this family needs to stay away from places that overlook large bodies of water.",
        "Ivy: [Laughs] Excellent point.",
        "Aly: No, I'm serious. I mean, I just -- I-I can't get over it. One second, your feet are firmly placed on the ground and you're taking a picture, and then the next, you're almost drowning in the seine?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. And it had a pretty strong current, too.",
        "Aly: Even so, you still tried to get Liam to go to hope.",
        "Ivy: Deep down, though, I knew he wouldn't. I mean, I was in danger. There's no way he would have left me.",
        "Aly: You like him, don't you? Come on. You can tell me.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] I kissed him in paris. I mean, it was just a friendly peck. But, Aly, I-I can't deny that... I felt something.",
        "Aly: Wow.",
        "Ivy: Am I awful?",
        "Aly: Liam's available now.",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "Aly: So, what's next?",
        "Ivy: Well, uh, there's a party on at bikini bar, and a lot of people from the office are going. I'm gonna invite Liam.",
        "Quinn: Honey, don't say that.",
        "Wyatt: It's true!",
        "Quinn: Liam will never be half the man you are.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, stop. Just stop that, okay? Don't talk about him, and don't do anything to him, okay?",
        "Quinn: Come on, I might hate the little creep, but I'm not gonna make it my life's work to torture him.",
        "Wyatt: Good! Because that's the last thing that I need right now. Look, I'm trying not to freak out here. Liam was in paris, and if it hadn't been for some crazy accident with Ivy falling into the seine, then who knows?",
        "Quinn: Don't second-guess hope! She married you! You were in paris. The diamond brought the two of you together again!",
        "Wyatt: You know, the police are still asking questions about Ricardo's death.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Typical waste of taxpayer money.",
        "Wyatt: Promise me you had nothing to do with that.",
        "Quinn: I already told you. I had nothing to do with Ricardo's death.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. The diamond did come back to hope and me, and we took it to paris. And yes, like you said, it did bring us back together. But I just want to know that it wasn't because of you and your manipulations again.",
        "Deacon: Uh, okay, I'm not a mind reader, but I'm sensing something's off here. Honey, if -- if there's any way that I can help, just tell me.",
        "Hope: Um, there was just a little mix-up in paris, a misunderstanding on my part.",
        "Deacon: Okay, I'm completely lost.",
        "Brooke: It's not your fault, sweetie.",
        "Hope: It turns out that Liam was in paris. He was there to meet me after all.",
        "Brooke: He was delayed.",
        "Deacon: Uh, well, I hope he had a good reason.",
        "Hope: Oh, he did. He did. He had the best reason. It really doesn't get any better than saving Ivy's life.",
        "Brooke: I know this sounds crazy, but Ivy fell into the seine.",
        "Hope: And Liam jumped in to save her.",
        "Deacon: And that's why he didn't make it?",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. I am so proud of Liam. He is a hero! Chivalry is not dead! I was so lucky to have him in my life.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Liam: Ivy. Hi.",
        "Ivy: You busy?",
        "Liam: Uh... [Scoffs] Not really. Just having trouble concentrating.",
        "Ivy: Oh, well, that's because you were looking at the wrong thing. I have some photos I had Oliver take of pieces I would like to see in the layout.",
        "Liam: What? Let me see, let me see. Come on. Hand it over. Ivy, you are very talented.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Liam: Wow. Every bit as much as Quinn.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Well, no, not quite, but I'll get there.",
        "Liam: And she's modest.",
        "Ivy: Quinn may not be the nicest person, but she does know her way around jewelry.",
        "Liam: I guess everybody's good at something. No, this is great. This is awesome. I mean, you know, subject to photographer input, of course, but...",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah, yeah. And I'm open to suggestion. I'm just grateful to have my pieces exposed.",
        "Liam: By the way, I know what you're doing.",
        "Ivy: That transparent?",
        "Liam: I think it's really sweet that you're coming here and checking up on me. Thank you for having my back. But I'm gonna be okay. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: I mean, hope married my brother. [Chuckles] You want to talk about moving on in a definitive way, well...",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but that doesn't mean her feelings are just neatly resolved. Liam... I spoke to hope when the party was winding down. To be completely honest with you, she's still in love with you. She was shocked when she found out you'd came and she'd missed you. [Sighs] If only I hadn't been so inattentive.",
        "Liam: Okay, can you -- can you stop saying things like that? It was an accident. You didn't jump. You weren't being too clumsy. You got bumped into the river, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but if I wasn't so preoccupied trying to take that photo --",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, shoulda, woulda, coulda, you know? If hope had only waited a few minutes longer. It wasn't that late. But she chose not to. Just like she chose to marry Wyatt. She wasn't forced. She wasn't manipulated. She made all those decisions with her eyes wide open. And if I am going to move forward with my life without her... I got to accept that.",
        "Wyatt: I need to know that she married me out of choice and not because of you.",
        "Quinn: You know, it really hurts my feelings that you think so little of me.",
        "Wyatt: Look, I-I just can't afford for anything to go wrong right now! She knows Liam was in paris! You should have seen her! The way she was looking at him when she found out -- it could change everything!",
        "Quinn: Hope married you because she loves you. It's that simple.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, you didn't have a hand in this, then?",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Wyatt: I hope you mean that.",
        "Quinn: You think I want to be ostracized permanently from my son and his new family? I want to work my way back into the Forresters! Not by scheming, but by showing that I'm a worthy person!",
        "Wyatt: Mom.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm?",
        "Wyatt: I want you in my life, okay?",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: As hope's mother-in-law, as our children's grandmother. But you have to fit in, in a functional way. I will not have my family in constant chaos because of you.",
        "Quinn: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Are we done? Are we done with the lecture now, please? Because there's something I really, really want to give you.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Great.",
        "Quinn: Don't give me that look. You're gonna love this.",
        "Wyatt: What is it?",
        "Quinn: What do you think?",
        "Wyatt: Thanks.",
        "Quinn: You go to hope. She's your wife.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: I made vows to Wyatt. And I meant them.",
        "Brooke: But you wouldn't have if Liam got to you on time.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Honey, a random sequence of events completely altered your course.",
        "Deacon: Honey, this happens all the time. And when it does, I mean, all you can do... if you can't fix it and you can't change it back, your only choice is to move ahead with the choices you've made.",
        "Hope: Thanks. Thank you. Um, I think I just need some time to be alone.",
        "Deacon: Of course. Just, you know, call us if you need anything, okay?",
        "Brooke: All right, baby.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Brooke: Love you.",
        "Hope: I love you, too.",
        "Deacon: Okay. Bye.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[Cat meows]",
        "Hope: Hi.",
        "[Cat meows]",
        "Wyatt: Hope?",
        "Hope: Hey. Hi.",
        "Wyatt: Hi. It's nice. Coming home, seeing you here. It feels... married.",
        "Ivy: Sorry about that.",
        "Liam: Oh, no problem.",
        "Ivy: Still sad?",
        "Liam: Yeah, I-I mean, moving on doesn't mean you forget. It's gonna be weird. It's gonna be really, really weird. Hope was this constant in my life for so long, you know?",
        "Ivy: Well, I might be able to help you with that. At the risk of sounding really improper, I was wondering what you were doing tomorrow night.",
        "Liam: Oh. You --",
        "Ivy: Do you want me to help you with that? \"Oh, Ivy, what have you got in mind?\" Well, there is an end-of-summer party at bikini, and I was wondering if you want to go.",
        "Liam: Y-yes. Yes. Yes. Why not? Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: You know, it was ridiculous of Liam to show up to our wedding party and then start guilt-tripping you. It's just... you okay? Say something.",
        "Hope: Sorry. Sorry. Uh, I'm... today was just really unexpected, you know. I'm a little thrown. But yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I, uh... I got you something. [Clears throat] It's from my mother. Don't worry. I checked. It's safe. It's TSA approved. We got married so fast that we kind of skipped a few beats.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: May I? You take that one. With this ring... I pledge my life to you. Okay. My turn.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] [Sighs] With this ring... I commit myself to you... as my husband... from this day on... rocking and rolling, wherever life may take us.",
        "Wyatt: I love you."
