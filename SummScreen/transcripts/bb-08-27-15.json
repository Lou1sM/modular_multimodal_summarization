        "Ivy asks Wyatt if he is okay with this; they are not to be pushed around. He says they are the one being pushed, they can now be the pusher. Liam is one who gets served on a silver platter. As long as no one gets hurt, why not use the video to help them. And yet they think Ivy and Wyatt are the bad guys. Steffy even said that some of Quinn was rubbing off on her. Ivy says there are many things she would do differently. Aly needed medical help but if Liam does not know who she is anymore or wants to blame her, she does not hold that against Wyatt. He says a weaker person might have just gone home, but she is sexy and strong and that is a turn on. She says she thought Liam was there for her but she was just a sub for Steffy ..now she has Wyatt and she appreciates that. Steffy laments to Liam that the video does not show what really happened or that much but Ivy is holding it over her head. If Steffy goes to the police it will be to turn Ivy in for blackmail. They need a night off, no more video, no more Ivy. Ridge is not interested in Caroline's and Thomas's silliness so Thomas hands him his designs. Ridge tells him he has not made a decision but he is definitely one step closer to being a FC designer. Thomas thanks him for at least not tearing up his designs.",
        "Steffy thanks Liam for the pizza and making her laugh with his John Wayne impressions. Wyatt says he knows the answer already but what if .what if Liam came back in two weeks and said he was through with Steffy and wanted Ivy back. She says that will never happen and kisses him. Wyatt says he will retract his question. They helped each other change. He felt second fiddle to Liam when it came to woman and even his father, but no more with her. She's good and genuine, qualities he tries for but she has them. What Liam did was wrong but it gave her self confidence and he finds that sexy as hell. Thomas says he realizes he has a long way to go but it feels good to get Ridge's respect. Ridge says that is all he wants, for him to be the best designer he can be and Caroline has helped with that. Thomas leaves while watching her run into Ridge's arms and puts her legs around his body. After love making, Wyatt jokes that Ivy is moving up in the world by getting away from Liam and being with him. It's good they found each other. They are kindred spirits with mother's who dominate. She says she is not going to waste this video. Aly would want her to use it. And she was an underdog like they are; take what they deserve now."

        "Ivy: So, you agree? No more being pushed around.",
        "Wyatt: We have the power. We should do the pushing.",
        "Ivy: Deal.",
        "Wyatt: Deal.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Want some wine?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Hey, I-I know you have a problem using the video. You don't want Steffy going to jail.",
        "Wyatt: She doesn't have to. That's the beauty of it. As long as we start getting some respect at Forrester. I mean, there's...some people -- [Coughing] Liam -- who get served everything on a silver platter while the rest of us actually have to work for our success.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: But that's what this video is for us -- our way of working our way up. And as long as no one gets hurt, why not use it? Why can't the underdogs get a chance, you know?",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I thought if anyone could get through to her, it would be you.",
        "Liam: So did I.",
        "Steffy: She's blackmailing me. She's holding this over my head. The video -- it doesn't show what really happened. It doesn't even show that much. And, I mean, if she goes to the police about this --",
        "Liam: Actually... [Sighs] I get the feeling she expects you to.",
        "Steffy: What? No. If I go to the police, it's to turn Ivy in for blackmail. And you can tell her that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: What's going on?",
        "Caroline: Thomas wanted to paint me. So, that... [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: You paint?",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] Yeah, your -- your portrait inspired me.",
        "Ridge: Inspires me, too. Painting is fun if you have the time. But if you want to impress me and the rest of Forrester, you should probably focus on your designs. What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I've actually been focusing plenty on my designs. That's why I'm here. Caroline's been helping me out.",
        "Ridge: Was she?",
        "Thomas: Do you want to see them?",
        "Ridge: Sure.",
        "Thomas: Okay. But...yeah, you're not gonna tear them up, are you?",
        "Ridge: I hope not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Sighs] I feel like I'm to blame here. I mean, I'll tell you one thing -- Ivy wouldn't be blackmailing you if she and I were still together.",
        "Steffy: Hey, you should feel relief, not guilt. You escaped.",
        "Liam: Well, that's one way to look at it.",
        "Steffy: You know, I don't even want to think about this anymore. [Sighs] We deserve a night off. Yeah.",
        "Liam: We do, huh?",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm. Yeah. No video. No Ivy. Just us.",
        "Liam: I can make that happen.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You know, what's so maddening about this is that they honestly believe we're the bad ones.",
        "Wyatt: Liam thinks of himself as the hero to everyone else's story. I mean, it doesn't even occur to him that he could actually be wrong in this situation.",
        "Ivy: Oh, I know. I mean, he made promises to me, and he spoke all these commitments. But then Steffy comes back into town, she murders my cousin, and I'm the disappointment. [Scoffs]",
        "Wyatt: He said that to you?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, it was -- it was in his tone. He kept going on about how I've changed and I'm no longer the Ivy Forrester he knew.",
        "Wyatt: But you're not. And that's a good thing. Because the Ivy he knew would just be happy to sit by and be second string to -- to Steffy and just wait for some scraps from him. But the girl -- the woman in front of me got screwed over, and she's standing up for herself. And I got to say I am so proud of you.",
        "Ivy: Well, he thinks it's because of you.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: He thinks that, uh, because I've been hanging around you, that some of your mother's qualities are rubbing off on me.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. I mean, he's not -- he's not entirely wrong.",
        "Wyatt: I mean...",
        "Ivy: The Quinn part, yeah. But...you know, these -- these changes in me -- it does have a lot to do with you.",
        "Wyatt: But is it a good change or -- or a bad change?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: It used to have some sleeves right here, but Caroline convinced me to lose those. And, uh, the neckline was about an inch or two higher, so we dropped it. And...well, we can drop it more if you think that... so, best designs you've ever seen, huh? Gonna put them into production immediately?",
        "Ridge: Well done, Thomas. It's a definite improvement.",
        "Thomas: Yeah?",
        "Ridge: You're on the right track.",
        "Thomas: So, does that mean --",
        "Ridge: It doesn't mean anything. I haven't made a decision as to how you fit into the company at all. But it means you're one step closer to what you really want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You choose a movie?",
        "Steffy: I think I narrowed it down. Bob Hope?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Always.",
        "Steffy: Oh, yes. Oh! Thank you.",
        "Liam: To a quiet evening together.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Yes, please. Mmm. Together. Ooh, who'd have thought?",
        "Liam: I know, right? I mean, let that sink in for a minute, 'cause it didn't have to go this way.",
        "Steffy: We all have our off days. Weeks. Months.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] You know, I don't think I ever really gave up on you coming home. And here you are. To home.",
        "Steffy: I like the sound of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Do you regret what we're doing here? I mean, do you -- do you think that I'm a bad influence on you?",
        "Ivy: What? No. I mean, do I have a lot of regrets? Yeah. But none of them involve you. I regret not figuring out what kind of guy Liam was sooner. I regret not being a better friend to Aly when -- when, obviously, she needed serious help. I mean, there's a lot of things that I would do differently, especially that night. But this change that Liam sees...",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm?",
        "Ivy: It's necessary. You know, it's a matter of survival. It's a way that I can mourn Aly's death.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Ivy: So, you know what? If -- if Liam wants to act disappointed and say that he doesn't know who I am anymore, then so what? I'm a stronger person now because of you.",
        "Wyatt: Good. I'm glad you think so.",
        "Ivy: Aww.",
        "Wyatt: I like this fire in you. It's extremely attractive and sexy.",
        "Ivy: Really?",
        "Wyatt: And it drives me wild. [Chuckles] But a weaker person might have...just gone home.",
        "Ivy: Well, I mean, I can't lie and say I haven't thought about it. But what would that mean for Aly and her memory if I just packed up my bags and left?",
        "Wyatt: Especially when you'd be leaving me. I mean, little old me, you know?",
        "Ivy: Hey. Look, you joke about this, but it's kind of true. I mean, I thought I was in this loving, secure relationship with Liam. Little did I know I was just Steffy's stand-in.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Ivy: You were there for me, a shoulder to cry on. We were both bummed, thinking we were never gonna find people like them again.",
        "Wyatt: Yuck. [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: Little did we realize what was standing right in front of us.",
        "Wyatt: We realize now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Ridge: For what?",
        "Thomas: Well... thank you for at least not tearing up my designs this time.",
        "Ridge: You're welcome.",
        "Caroline: See? I told you they were good.",
        "Ridge: You seem invested.",
        "Caroline: Well, I mean, I've just seen...definite growth in Thomas as a designer, and he really is trying to give it his all. And I want it to work out for him, for all of us.",
        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Ooh. I like your style, padre.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Do you remember saying that to me in Aspen?",
        "Steffy: And you gave your best John Wayne response.",
        "Liam: [As John Wayne] Well, I'll you what, Pilgrim. I'm gonna lasso you like one of my cattle and --",
        "Steffy: Stop it.",
        "Liam: [Normal voice] What?",
        "Steffy: Stop it.",
        "Liam: I'm done.",
        "Steffy: You're done. You must be done.",
        "Liam: I promise.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. Thank you. No, seriously. Thank you for making me laugh and stop thinking about everything that's happening. You remind me that I have so much good in my life. And I have so much to look forward to. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I'm glad you stayed.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Me, too. I'm excited to see where this goes.",
        "Wyatt: Can I ask you a question? And I probably know the answer to this, but I-I-I have to ask it anyway. Let's say Liam shows up a week or two or a month from now, and he says he's done with Steffy and he's just -- you know, he's begging for a second chance. What then?",
        "Ivy: Liam will never be done with Steffy. That's what I've learned.",
        "Wyatt: But Liam needs another girl waiting in the wings.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. He does. So, it must have been a huge shock when I said I wasn't gonna play that part. He's gonna have to go find someone else.",
        "Wyatt: You just made my day. You know that?",
        "Ivy: Really?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: That was easy.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: I could do so much better than that.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Ivy: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Show me.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I retract my statement. That kiss just made my day.",
        "Ivy: Oh, good.",
        "Wyatt: But I can reevaluate my answer depending on, uh... what's gonna happen here.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Are you...",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Ivy: Well, we might just have to see what happens.",
        "Wyatt: Really? Good. You know, you say that I helped change you. But you did the same thing for me, you know?",
        "Ivy: How so?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] You helped me get out of the shadow of my brother. I always -- I felt second fiddle to him when it came to women or when it came to my father, and...now there's you. You see the potential in me, and you're not looking over my shoulder, waiting for Liam to show up.",
        "Ivy: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Wyatt: Right?",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "Wyatt: I'm just checking.",
        "Ivy: God, no. Geez.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] I love your honesty. You know that? You're just -- you're sweet and you're loving and you're -- you're good. You're genuine, you know? A lot of qualities that I don't really possess, myself, but I'm working on them. I'm working on them.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, you are all those things.",
        "Wyatt: Well, uh, mm... I try. Look, Liam -- Liam took advantage of your goodness, but I-I promise you I won't do that. I will appreciate it, just like I appreciate how you're standing up for yourself and how you stood up for Aly. What Liam did to you was wrong, but it -- it gave you a voice and it gave you self-confidence. And I got to say, I find that sexy as hell. Oh, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I realize I've got a long ways to go. You know, my place on the Forrester design team -- it's got to be earned, and I want you to know that I get that. I'm thankful for it. It feels good to be earning my place, gaining your respect through my work and not just my name.",
        "Ridge: I'm happy to hear that. Hey. I want you to be the best designer you can possibly be, better than me. After I'm dead and gone, of course. Not now.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] Yeah. If I ever am, I-I'll know it's because you helped me get there. Both of you. Well, I'm -- I'm gonna head back to the office now, so...",
        "Ridge: Yeah?",
        "Thomas: Uh, yeah. You know, I'm feeling inspired. It's a good time to sketch.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: All right. Well, I'm very excited to see what you have brewing.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] All right. Show you in the morning.",
        "Caroline: All right. I can't wait.",
        "Ridge: Whoa!",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Up-tempo music plays]",
        "Liam: [Sighs] I like this.",
        "Steffy: Me, too.",
        "[Music stops]",
        "Steffy: I know I said I didn't want to talk about this -- about Aly and -- and Ivy, but...",
        "Liam: I know.",
        "Steffy: It just feels so good, you know? That you believe in me. It feels so good.",
        "Liam: Of course I believe in you.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but you heard what Ivy said. And you saw the video. I mean, you could have easily just walked away.",
        "Liam: No walking away. We are both holding on, and neither of us are letting go ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You know, sometimes I just -- I -- [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Hmm? What?",
        "Ivy: It's just my summer started out so differently, you know?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: I had this...marriage with Liam out of convenience, and now I'm -- and now I'm here with you.",
        "Wyatt: Well, you're moving up in the world is what you're doing.",
        "Ivy: Yes, indeed. Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: But not just with me. You are the new face of Forrester.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, thanks to your support.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: It's the most I've ever felt, I think.",
        "Wyatt: Seriously?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: You mean besides your parents?",
        "Ivy: Mm... I mean...no. My dad -- I love him. I love my dad. But he is crazy. He is in and out of this country. He's always on an adventure.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I learned at a very young age that I can't count on him.",
        "Wyatt: What about your mom?",
        "Ivy: Our mothers are very different. Yeah, I mean, your mom likes being extremely involved in your life.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, God.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] But, I mean, how long have I lived here in Los Angeles, right? It hasn't even occurred to my mom to come and visit me. And if it was -- it was getting time off work or a money thing, I'd understand, but... it's not. Although I can't really blame her. She's always been in her own world.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I know what it's like to have a mother in her own world. Trust me. Have you seen Quinn?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Yes. You understand. Good.",
        "Wyatt: But that just reiterates my point.",
        "Ivy: Mm?",
        "Wyatt: It's good that we found each other, you know?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. We're like kindred spirits.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, kindred spirits that could be a force to be reckoned with.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: 'Cause we can do anything together.",
        "Ivy: I mean, it is good to have some leverage, though.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Ivy: You know?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Think of what Aly could have done with her life. Such a huge talent wasted, you know? I'm not gonna waste this video. She would want me to -- to use it and defend her memory, and I can't just let her die in vain. I... you know, you were right before when you were saying that thing about the underdogs deserving their chance. I mean, Aly was an underdog, too, and -- and if she was still here, she would tell us to just do whatever it takes for us to win, take what we deserve from Liam and Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
