    "Recap": [
        "Bill is incensed and tells Thorne to shut up; this does not concern him. Katie says it does. He has seen Will more than Bill has lately. Bill rants more until Thorne steps closer and they almost come to fisticuffs. He says he is sorry they are so estranged but he is here now to fix that. Katie says it terrifies her and she has to do all she can to make sure they Will is not hurt. Bill says listen up good, there is no way they are going to strip him of seeing his son \u0096 ain't happening. Steffy breezes in and tells all to get to work. Emma immediately is jealous when she sees Xander is going to be allowed to shoot Zoe. Steffy gives orders and tells them to own the runway. Emma watches Zoe and Sander's every move. Katie tells Bill to take a breath and calm down. Bill tells Thorne that he is stirring the pot and she never mentioned sole custody until today when Thorne mentioned it. They both bring up his involvement in pursuing his daughter-in-law and then ruining Liam's life. Bill says he is not the only one that has messed up. She has more than a few skeletons in her closet and if she takes him to court she will lose.",
        "Steffy seems pleased. Emma corners Zoe and wants to speak with her. Zoe agrees then Xander shows up. Emma says on the other hand perhaps she ought to go get more clothes on. Zoe wants to know if she is the assistant or the boss. Katie tells Bill she will never keep him from his son. He asks her to remember those nine months when she struggled with her sobriety and then more recently her trysts with Will's own half brother. She says she has had her struggles with bad times but they are talking about right now. Thorne steps in again and says Katie has been Will's full time parent unlike Bill and he is sure if she pursues sole custody, which he thinks she should, with her written proof of evidence of Bill being absent, that it will be Bill who will be the loser. Zoe tells Xander that she is grateful that he did not listen to Emma and make her go back to the U.K. and eventually maybe they can be more than friends. She kisses him and he does not pull back. Bill starts to go upstairs and Katie stops him. He says he knows how important this is and she is keeping him from his son so she is the one who is keeping them apart. Katie says he is in pain and he is blaming himself. She says she will go upstairs and let Will decide. Bill rails into Thorne that he knows Katie better than anyone else and he knows she did not dream this up all by herself. He loves Will despite his latest lapses and Thorne has absolutely nothing to say about his son's life and he will do all he can to make sure it stays that way."

        "Bill: Will you answer me? You'd actually go through with this? Sole custody?",
        "Thorne: You've given her no other choice.",
        "Bill: Will you shut up? This doesn't concern you.",
        "Katie: Yes, it does. He cares about our son.",
        "Bill: What, and I don't? You know how much I love our little boy.",
        "Katie: It's not about love. I-it's -- it's about consistency and stability and security. It's about being there for him when he needs you.",
        "Bill: And I'm here. I'm here right now, trying to fix this. That's all that matters.",
        "Katie: No, that's not all that matters. Your actions matter. More than your words. What matters is not disappointing him over and over again with your absence.",
        "Bill: Can we talk about this without lurch hanging out there, just the two of us?",
        "Thorne: What's the matter, spencer? Are you feeling threatened?",
        "Bill: Just -- just tune that out. It's just a bunch of white noise. Why would I feel threatened? I don't feel threatened. And you know that, because you have no case, katie. Threatening to take my son from me? Really? Why would you do that to me?",
        "Xander: It's crazy how fast steffy got the intimates line up and running again.",
        "Emma: Yeah. She's been working practically day and night when she's not with kelly.",
        "Zoe: Yeah, talk about losing yourself in your work. I mean, of course, now that her personal life is kind of --",
        "Emma: Hey, she's here.",
        "Steffy: Hello, everyone. I'm really pressed for time, so let's get started.",
        "Quinn: I've been, uh, working with the models, adding more accessories like you wanted.",
        "Steffy: Great. And, xander, you know what I'm after, right?",
        "Xander: Yeah. I'm -- I'm not a professional photographer, but I can grab the looks for sure.",
        "Emma: You're shooting the mini run-through?",
        "Xander: Just documenting the pairings so they can be reviewed. I'm more like a -- a substitute for zach since he's out on another shoot.",
        "Zoe: Yeah, didn't you know? Xander is our modern-day renaissance man. You know, graphic design, amateur photography. There's nothing he can't do.",
        "Steffy: Uh, emma, will you help out xander and grab all the models?",
        "Zoe: Ready for my close-up.",
        "Xander: Yeah. All right. Let's do this.",
        "Quinn: Okay, so, we've got the turquoise or the lucite.",
        "Steffy: Oh, I really like the lucite.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, me too. And then, um, for sierra, you wanted to stay with rose gold, so I picked this one for her.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. That's gorgeous.",
        "Quinn: Yeah?",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm. Let's do it.",
        "Quinn: Okay. All right. Has ridge signed off on all of this?",
        "Steffy: You mean has he signed off on the direction I'm taking the collection? No. I have full control over the intimates line.",
        "Quinn: Yes. I know that. That's why it's gonna be a success.",
        "Steffy: You're absolutely right. Did you hear that, everyone? This is gonna be a success! Yes it is!",
        "Steffy: You all look so good. I want positive vibes, good energy, and we got this. I know you guys got this.",
        "Quinn: ...On you.",
        "Steffy: You know? Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Excuse me, miss? I like what's happening here, for what it's worth.",
        "Steffy: It's worth a lot, coming from my co-ceo and father.",
        "Thorne: Come on, bill. Let's be honest. You haven't been a father in the past few months.",
        "Bill: I'm warning you for the last time, butt out. This is none of your business.",
        "Thorne: Well, I'm making it my business.",
        "Bill: Are you?",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no, no. Stop it. Stop it. Stop.",
        "Thorne: I care about katie and will.",
        "Katie: This is not helping.",
        "Bill: Then get --",
        "Katie: And your son is upstairs, and I don't want him to hear this.",
        "Bill: Then get rid of this jackass so you and I can discuss this -- will's parents, just the two of us.",
        "Katie: Thorne has been a part of will's life for a while now. He cares about will, and he has been there for him when you haven't been.",
        "Bill: Okay. Fine. Fine. I should not have let aspects of my personal life compromise my relationship with our son. I am sorry about that. I'm here to fix it. But, katie, come on. For you to go to such an extreme. We were -- we were co-parenting just fine. We still can.",
        "Katie: Oh, god, I wish I could believe that. But actions, they mean something, bill, not just words. You have disappointed our son over and over again, and I see what it's doing to him. And as a mother, that terrifies me, and I have to do whatever I can to protect him.",
        "Bill: [ Sighs ] And so do I. So I want you to listen to me. I want you both to listen to me. Under no circumstances will I let you strip me of custody. None. It ain't happening.",
        "Steffy: Okay, everyone. Even though this is a test run-through, we want to see what it looks like on the runway. So give it your all. Lots of energy, fun, excitement, sexiness. Do it! Own it.",

        "Katie: Okay, bill. Take a breath and calm down.",
        "Bill: Don't you tell me to calm down when you and forrester are coming after my son!",
        "Thorne: No one is coming after your son.",
        "Bill: The hell you're not! You're doing everything you can to convince katie that I'm a bad influence on my own son.",
        "Thorne: Well, you have to be present in will's life to be an influence. Good or bad. And you're not. That's the problem.",
        "Bill: No, the problem is that you're stirring the pot.",
        "Katie: That is not what thorne is doing.",
        "Bill: That's exactly what he's doing. Come on, katie. Just be honest, just for a second. You want to tell me you didn't hear the words \"sole custody\" come out of him until today? Attacking katie is not gonna help you.",
        "Bill: I'm not attacking katie. I'm just trying to get at the truth, because I know that I'm right. Yes, I have been distracted --",
        "Katie: Ho!",
        "Thorne: \"Distracted\"?",
        "Bill: Yes, distracted. All right? I don't just work at a dress farm. I control an empire, and that comes with more responsibility than you could ever fathom.",
        "Katie: Okay, be quiet. Keep it down.",
        "Thorne: You make it sound like you were out saving the world, when we all know that you were busy sabotaging your son's marriage. Trying to rip apart your granddaughter's family so that you could pursue your much younger former daughter-in-law.",
        "Katie: I mean, I can't -- I can't believe what you did to liam, bill. I mean, how do I know that -- that, in a few years, you wouldn't do something just as devastating to will?",
        "Bill: Oh, come on, katie. You're talking utter nonsense!",
        "Katie: I don't think so.",
        "Bill: All right, I've heard enough. Enough of this. I have tried to reason with you. I have tried to reach out to you. But if you are delusional enough to actually pursue this custody, oh, how I will fight you. And you know, katie -- you know that I like nothing more than a good bare-knuckle brawl. I'm not the only one who messed up. You have a few skeletons in your closet, now, don't you? So you want to go to war with me? Bring it on. You will lose.",
        "Quinn: So, that's everything that steffy wanted me to relay to you. And, uh, for you guys, um... she was really pleased, you know, other than just a few tweaks here and there. So does anybody have any questions?",
        "Danny: Has a date been set?",
        "Quinn: For the actual preview?",
        "Carmen: I mean, the way steffy's talking, it sounds like she plans to pull out all the stops.",
        "Zoe: Speaking of which, if she'd like me to model the showstopper, I'm game. I did it for hope for the future, and it was a --",
        "Emma: Only because bailey twisted her ankle and you happened to be the right size.",
        "Danny: Wow. Somebody threw some shade. What's up with that?",
        "Quinn: Okay. Everybody, you can all go. Except for you. You need to stay. I need to fix your look a little bit. And xander and emma, just stick around, because I need help bringing all these accessories back upstairs.",
        "Xander: Sure thing.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Emma: Steffy gave me a few notes to pass on.",
        "Zoe: This mean you're her assistant now?",
        "Emma: Let's just get this over with, okay?",
        "Zoe: Okay. I'm all yours.",
        "Emma: On second thought, why don't you put some clothes on first?",
        "Zoe: Now I'm confused. Are you the assistant or the boss?",
        "Quinn: Emma? I need you over here, honey.",
        "Emma: [ Sighs ]",
        "Zoe: Thought she'd never leave.",
        "Xander: Will you please go easy on emma?",
        "Zoe: Absolutely, love. If you do something for me.",
        "Ridge: You're really doing it.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Ridge: What you said you'd do -- put yourself and your baby, the company, first. I shouldn't have doubted you.",
        "Steffy: Glad I have a fan.",
        "Ridge: A fan? Are you nuts? Th-those guys out there, those interns, they would do anything for you.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I've set some pretty lofty goals for myself. And with the intimates line. But at the end of the day, what matters is my daughter.",
        "Ridge: That makes me very happy.",
        "Steffy: What? That my daughter's the center of my world? What kind of mother would I be if she wasn't?",
        "Ridge: No, it makes me happy that this bill spencer chapter is behind you. That guy caused a lot of damage. He still is.",
        "Thorne: If that's not a threat, I don't know what is.",
        "Bill: I'm just stating what you will be up against if you decide to pursue this.",
        "Katie: An ugly, protracted custody battle. Is that it?",
        "Bill: I will not be separated from my son.",
        "Katie: No one's talking about separating you from will. You can see him whenever you like.",
        "Bill: No. Correction. I can see him whenever you'd like.",
        "Katie: I would never keep you from my son, bill. I'm just trying to give him the stability that he needs.",
        "Bill: Did you say stability? Why don't we have a conversation about stability? How much stability did will have all those many months that you were drinking? And how about that, uh, not-so-secret tryst that you were having with will's half-brother.",
        "Katie: I'm not saying that i haven't had my own struggles, but we are talking about now. Today. Will's not the same little boy that he was months ago. He's growing up so fast. And he needs to know that he can count on his parents, that -- that we're gonna be there for him.",
        "Thorne: Katie has been, every minute of the day. While you were busy pursuing steffy, katie's been will's rock. Making him breakfast. Taking him to play dates. Taking him to school. Tucking him in at night. She's been a 24/7 parent, unlike you. And she has the records to prove it. All those scheduled visits and weekends that you missed, that's all the proof she needs to show that you're an absentee father. No judge in his right mind is gonna side with you. Which is why I'm confident that, if she pursues sole custody, which I think she should, then you're the one that's gonna lose.",
        "Xander: Uh, what are you doing?",
        "Zoe: It's called privacy.",
        "Xander: And why do we need privacy?",
        "Zoe: Well, maybe because I'm being sensitive to emma's feelings. Since she obviously has a thing for you. Or maybe I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you didn't listen to her, ask me to go back to the uk and give up this incredible opportunity at forrester. I wouldn't have blamed you if you had. But this is just so much better. The two of us... maybe even more, eventually?",
        "Ridge: Spencer has failed will as a father. And katie is thinking about suing for full custody.",
        "Steffy: Is carter representing katie?",
        "Ridge: Not yet. But thorne is supporting her, so we'll see. See, my -- my brother thinks that bill's neglect over the past few months have really hurt the boy.",
        "Steffy: It can't be easy for her.",
        "Ridge: No. But you know what it is. You're a mother. You would do anything to keep your child happy and safe.",
        "Steffy: I mean, yeah. Yeah, I get it. I empathize with katie. But if this is the route she and thorne are gonna take, god only knows how bill is gonna react.",
        "Bill: I'm done with both of you. I came here to see my son, and that's what I'm gonna go do.",
        "Katie: Bill, don't go up there. You're gonna upset him.",
        "Bill: I don't want him to think I blew him off, katie.",
        "Thorne: You did blow him off. You called and you cancelled.",
        "Bill: [ Sighs angrily ]",
        "Thorne: Do you have any idea how sad and confused will was when katie had to tell him that you weren't coming -- again?",
        "Bill: This meeting came up at the last second. I couldn't say no. You know how important it was. I couldn't say no, katie.",
        "Katie: But you could say no to your son?",
        "Bill: I'm -- I didn't! I'm standing right here. I'm trying to go see him right now. You're keeping me from it. I ended that meeting as quickly as I could.",
        "Katie: That doesn't justify what you're doing to will. If this was the first time you'd blown him off, then fine, maybe. But... [ Sighs ] Bill, he's in pain. You're hurting him. He's questioning himself. He's wondering if he did something wrong to drive you away, and that breaks my heart. I'm gonna go upstairs. I'm gonna talk to him. And if he wants to see you, fine. But I'm gonna let him decide.",
        "Thorne: Whew!",
        "Bill: Nobody knows katie better than I do. And there is no way she came up with this idea of sole custody on her own. You planted it in her head.",
        "Thorne: You know, will's a terrific kid. Katie's a great mother. We've been spending a lot of time together. They mean a lot to me.",
        "Bill: Whoopee. So what does that mean? What, are you gonna just keep hanging around, trying to insinuate yourself? Who the hell do you think you are?",
        "Thorne: Well, I'm the man who knows what a responsibility it is to be a parent. Being someone who lost a child, I would welcome the opportunity to help out with will as much as katie allows.",
        "Bill: Hear this, forrester, loud and clear -- I don't give a freakin' rat's ass what you think of me, because you're nothing. You're less than nothing. All that matter is that katie knows, and I know, how much my son means to me. I am a loving, committed father despite my recent lapses, so you pass whatever judgment you want. Will knows that I love him. Will loves me. He doesn't need you to be there for him, because I'm there. So don't delude yourself. You have no say whatsoever in my son's life. And I will do whatever it takes to make sure it stays that way."
