        "Wyatt tells Hope to pick any closet or drawer. This is their home now. He has to leave for a little bit. He kisses her then sneezes and she realizes his allergies are really that bad and getting worse. Bob Barker thanks Liam for the series on animal shelters; it was a winner. Liam thanks him not only for the interview but for pointing him to the rescue shelter too. Bob says he knew Liam would be impressed and with that exposure many more pets around the world will be neutered and spayed and that makes him so happy. Rick and Oliver, Maya and Carter get ready for a photo shoot. Oliver tells Carter it must be hard to work together now. Carter muses that he's over it. The best thing you can do with a mess like that is move on and leave it behind. Rick says Caroline is out of town so he won't be coming to the Bikini party. Maya coos that doesn't mean he has to stay home. Paris was a huge success so they should celebrate. Carter agrees and says Rick can hang out with him. Deacon drops in on Hope. He offers to help her unpack but really wants her to help him. He says things have been better between he and her mother. Brooke invited him to Hope's party but she sort of kept her distance like she was testing him. Hope says maybe that is a good thing. He says maybe but he is having a hard time reading her. She has put up this wall and he is hoping Hope can help him with breaking that down. She's really glad that he came to her asking for help. She wasn't sure what to expect. He says the truth of the matter is that yes he needs a job and some extra cash but he would never come to Brooke about that. He states that he will never be as wealthy as Bill Spencer but that isn't what Brooke saw in him. She thought she could believe in and depend on Bill and it didn't turn out that way. But he is that guy and he's going to prove it. Something happened to Ridge when he hit that water. It left him incapacitated. He can't draw. All his life he has been an artist and designer and Bill took that way. Ivy tells Aly that technically she said yes for Liam, but yes he is coming to the party. Ivy says then it's a date. Ivy says she does not consider it a date but at least Liam won't be sitting on the couch alone tonight. Aly says he will be the envy of every guy at Bikini. Liam tells his secretary that he's busy and doesn't want to bother right now. Wyatt walks in and says it will only take a minute. He's only dropping Boo's things off .the whole kit and caboodle. He's not living with that hairball. Liam says Hope will not stand for this. Wyatt says he's allergic to cats .and anything that reminds her of Liam. And besides he can use the company with all those lonely nights. Deacon tells Hope maybe this is all wishful thinking. She says maybe not as they have been spending more time together. He says yes with Hope as they are family. That is their connection as parents but they are not family and they could be. Ridge is now out of the picture and with Katie so this is his and Brooke's chance. Bill slips in to see Brooke who is not ready for any intrusions. She shows him some lovely designs by Ridge. They tell a story of his evolution of an artist and as a person. He definitely had a true gift. She says Bill destroyed that so thanks to Bill that Ridge and FC may never be the same.",
        "Outside Liam catches up with Bob Barker to give him his packet he left behind. Wyatt is right behind and tells Liam that they are not done. Just because he is not some stupid animal over doesn't mean that he is going to keep the cat. Bob Barker asks who Wyatt is .and calling Liam some stupid animal lover. Wyatt asks why does he care who he is. Bob says animal lovers are not stupid and he does not like remarks like that. Wyatt says oh he is sorry, he meant animal wacko. Liam tells Wyatt not to be a jackass. Bob says maybe a pet would be a good thing, make him happy. But just remember to help the pet population and have your pet spayed or neutered. Wyatt calls him wacko one more time. Bob says that's it and proceeds to pummel him with four left hooks across the mouth, one by the left, punches him in the gut and then over the head as Wyatt doubles over. While on the ground, Bob shoves him with his foot and Wyatt rolls over and over down the hill. When he lands he says really? Bob says he still has it, Wacko. At the Bikini the place is grinding to the music with drinks flowing. Rick tells Carter he almost didn't get in. There are so many paparazzi outside. Carter says yes now Forrester in on the map with his leadership. Rick orders some drinks. Soon Oliver and Aly walk in. She just hopes Liam will be able to join them. Ivy tells her it is not a date, it's just a party. Soon Liam joins them and he mentions he likes Ivy's hair. And that she might just be right. This may be just what he needs. Hope tells Deacon she wishes she could tell him where her mother's head is at right now. But he will have to be that man that she wants to come back to. He wants to know if Hope thinks he can be that guy. She says she does. He says yesterday at the party and then when they were here he got the whole picture of what it would be like if they were a family. He says he wants that more than anything. Hope hugs him and says he has to tell her mom how he feels. He says he has. She says do it again. Just be honest with her. If he loves her then she needs to know. Bill asks Brooke what he can do to fix this. She doesn't know. He says he knows she wants to forgive him. She says yes she does. She loves him, but she doesn't know how to minimize this situation. What will happen if Ridge never draws again. What will happen to the business, his family, Ridge himself. She asked herself all night if she could be with a man who did that to Ridge. She doesn't think she has a right to be happy under those circumstances. Bill rants that Ridge came and drug her away from their wedding and he is not going to let him or anyone else come between them again. Bill says she is still wearing his ring because she knows they will get through this. Ridge will recover and they will get married as no other outcome is acceptable .she is the only woman for him and he's the only man for her. She turns away and we have a picture of Bill on one side and Deacon on the other."

        "Liam: Well, I got to tell you I was shocked how many people dropped their animals off at the shelter. They just left them there; they didn't even care.",
        "Bob: Fortunately, there are also people like you who are willing to give them good homes.",
        "Liam: We all do our part, I guess.",
        "Bob: Well, if there's anything else that I can do, just let me know, and please keep spreading the message to have your pet spayed or neutered and remember that some of the shelters will provide that service free.",

        "Hope: Oh, no. Not at Wyatt's not even here.",
        "Deacon: Listen, Hope, um, I know that news you got about Liam coming to Paris must have been difficult. I just wanted to make sure you're hanging in there.",
        "Hope: Uh, well, it's like you said, Wyatt is my husband. Uh, well, it was really nice of you to come help me unpack.",
        "Deacon: Actually, I was kind of hoping you might be able to help me. So, Hope, things have been, uh, getting better between me and your mother.",
        "Hope: She invited you to the party, so...",

        "Hope: Hmm. I don't know. Maybe you can try looking at that as a good thing.",
        "Deacon: Maybe. I just -- I'm just having trouble reading her, you know? She puts up this -- this wall. I was kind of hoping maybe you could help me break through it. This is ridiculous, isn't it -- me asking my kid for advice?",
        "Hope: Are you kidding? I love that you came to me for advice. I'm kind of relieved. I mean, when you said you needed my help, I really wasn't sure what to expect.",
        "Deacon: I didn't mean to scare you. Look -- here, the truth of the matter is this -- yes, I could use a job and little extra scratch, but I would never come to you or your mother for that. I-I'm never gonna be as wealthy or as powerful as Bill Spencer. But I know your mother, and I know that's not what she saw in him. You know, she thought that he was a guy that she could believe in, depend on, and he wasn't. And I am. And I'm gonna prove it.",
        "(Brooke's flashback)",
        "Deacon: Something happened when Ridge hit the water. It left him incapacitated. He can't draw. All his life, Ridge has been an artist, a talented designer, but Bill took that away.",

        "Hope: Here -- will you put that on the vanity?",
        "Deacon: Maybe this whole thing is wishful thinking.",

        "Deacon: With you. I-I mean, that's our connection as parents, but we're not a family, and I know we can be. Look, Ridge is finally, finally out of the picture. He's engaged to Katie. This is our chance.",

        "Brooke: One of Ridge's portfolios -- years of dedication and hard work, a lifetime of achievement.",
        "Bill: We were on the verge of a pretty big achievement of ours, until Ridge derailed us again with another newsflash.",
        "Brooke: Ridge didn't want me to know about this. He didn't want anybody to know. This was devastating for him, and the entire fashion community. I know fashion to you is just about business. It's about making more money. But to most of us, including myself it is art, and Ridge was a master. These designs -- they tell a story -- his evolution as an artist and as a person... his relationship with his father, with his family, places he's been, people he loves. And this one shows refinement. It shows maturity. Most of all, it shows joy. Ridge reveled in his work. He definitely has...a true gift. [Sighs] And you destroyed it. Thanks to you, Ridge and Forrester Creations may never be the same.",

        "Liam: Yes, I see him. Thank you, Gregory. Uh -- uh, Mr. Barker? Um, I mean Bob.",
        "Bob: Oh, my packet. I forgot it. I'm sorry.",
        "Liam: Oh, no. I'm glad I caught up to you.",
        "Wyatt: Liam! Look, we're not done here, okay? Just because I'm not some stupid animal lover, doesn't mean I'm taking that cat.",
        "Bob: \"Stupid animal lovers\"? Who are you?",
        "Wyatt: Why do you care?",
        "Bob: Because animal lovers are not stupid, and I don't like remarks like that.",
        "Wyatt: Ohh. I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. I meant, \"animal wacko.\"",
        "Bob: Hey, careful, young man.",
        "Liam: Don't be a jackass.",
        "Wyatt: I'm being --",
        "Liam: You're being a jackass.",
        "Wyatt: How am I being a jackass?",
        "Liam: Because --",
        "Bob: You know, I think a pet could be your best friend. Make you happy. You look like you could use that.",
        "Wyatt: Happy?",
        "Bob: But just remember -- help control the pet population. Have your pet spayed or neutered.",

        "Aly: Is that okay? I-I don't want to intrude on your date.",
        "Ivy: Aly, it's not a date. It's a party.",

        "Deacon: Do you think I can be that guy?",
        "Hope: Yeah I do.",
        "Deacon: Then I'm gonna have to be patient and that's is not easy when it comes to your mother. You know, yesterday at party, and then we were here -- I could see it -- the whole picture, you know, of what it would be like for us to be a family, what our life would be like. I want that. I want that more than anything.",

        "Bill: You want to forgive me.",
        "Brooke: Yes, Bill, I do. I love you. I just don't know how to minimize this situation. What if Ridge can't draw again? What happens? What happens to the business, to the family, to Ridge himself? I stayed up all night asking myself the same thing over and over again. Can I really be in a relationship with a man who has taken that from Ridge?",
        "Bill: So, suddenly, you don't have a right to be happy?",
        "Brooke: I don't think I can be happy under those circumstances.",
        "Bill: With me?",
        "Brooke: You don't realize what you've done.",
        "Bill: What I did was go after the woman that I love. Forrester assaulted me. He dragged you away from our wedding. You were yelling for me as he pulled you down that beach. I didn't know where he was going. I didn't know what he had planned. All I knew is that I wasn't going to let him take you away from me. And I'm not gonna let him or anyone else come between us now.",

        "Hope: [Sighs] You have to tell Mom how you feel.",
        "Deacon: I have.",
        "Hope: Well, tell her again. Just be honest with her. If you love her, then she needs to know.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",

        "Bill: [Sighs] You're still wearing my ring because you know we're going to get through this. Ridge will recover, and we will be married because we love each other, and no other outcome is acceptable. You are the only woman for me, Brooke, and I'm the only man for you."
