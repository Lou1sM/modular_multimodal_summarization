Sweetheart, the baby, our baby, is alive. ", "[ Doorbell ringing ] ", "Brooke: Eric? ", "Eric: Where's bridget? Is she upstairs in her room? ", "Brooke: No. ", "Eric: Have you seen her? Have you spoken to her? I'm very concerned about our daughter. ", "Brooke: You know. ", "Eric: That she's pregnant? Yes. Stephanie told me of all people. She also told me that bridget's very upset about you and nick. What's that about? What's going on, brooke? ", "Brooke: Eric, there's no real easy way to tell you this. ", "Eric: Tell me what? Oh, for god's sake, brooke, just spit it out. ", "Brooke: Bridget terminated her pregnancy. ", "Bridget: I know what a shock this must be to you. I don't really know where to begin. It was so wrong to lie to you. I never should have lied. When I came home to tell you that I was carrying our child -- I walked in on you and my mother. And something in me just -- just snapped. I guess I had some sort of a breakdown. My insecurities -- that's all I could see or hear. They were rushing back. My mother with deacon. Even my mom with ridge. Baby, you were the first man that I ever knew was mine. You were never going to leave me. Especially not for my mom. But when I walked in and I saw you together, knowing that I was carrying your child, it drove me to do something that I never should have done. I just needed to know that if you were free, and there was no baby, would you chose me or would you chose my mother? I needed to be sure. And so, I came up with this insane idea to test you. On the beach, I kept running from you because I couldn't even look at you. It felt so wrong to lie to you about our baby. When I did finally look into your eyes, I saw that pain and the betrayal. I realized -- I realized if I lost you, I would lose any chance that I ever had at happiness. Real love. That's why I'm here right now. I'm begging you -- I'm begging you to put my insanity behind us. Baby, just love me. Love me as deeply as I know that you do. Please. ", "Brooke: Nick drove around all night looking for her. He left messages and she wouldn't return his calls. ", "Eric: Well, can you blame her? Can you blame her? After what she walked in on? ", "Brooke: What she thought she walked in on. It was all a misunderstanding, eric. She assumed that nick and I were -- well, it wasn't that, and we tried to explain it to her. She didn't even let us know that she was pregnant. And when she got rid of the baby, she didn't even talk to nick about it. We only found out because stephanie told us. ", "Eric: My poor, baby girl. ", "Brooke: Yes, I know. And nick and I feel terrible about this. And we understand that we both played a part in it. But as horrible as this situation seems right now, maybe in the end it's for the best. ", "Eric: For the best? Maybe you could explain to me how losing this baby could possibly be for the best for anyone. Especially bridget. ", "Brooke: You know our daughter, eric. She has incredible instincts. Not that I agree with what she did, but she understood something about nick and me. Something that we couldn't even see ourselves. ", "Eric: What are you saying? ", "Brooke: If nick and I had been more honest about our feelings for each other, maybe this tragedy never would have happened. ", "Eric: But, you said you were being honest. You assured all of us you were being honest. ", "Brooke: Yes, yes. And I thought we were. I really believed we were. But bridget knew better. She's always known my heart better than I have. You're the only person in this world that I could tell this to, eric. ", "Eric: No. I don't want to hear it. ", "Brooke: Please. Please, I need you to understand. Nick and I didn't want to acknowledge our feelings, and we kept trying to explain it away every which way we could, until there were no more explanations left. Only the truth. And the truth is that we love each other. And we have for a very long time. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bridget: Baby? Nick? Nick, say something. ", "Nick: A test? ", "Bridget: I'm sorry. I know it was completely wrong. The pain that I put you through -- ", "Nick: You stood there on that beach. Looking at me. Watching my life collapse. ", "Bridget: I should have put a stop to it. I almost did. But I just -- I couldn'T. You were right. My insecurities, they took me to the darkest place that I could possibly go. I was just going to watch and see if you flew into my mother's arms. I know this must sound crazy to you right now. It sounds the same way to me. It's ridiculous now, but at the time -- I know you're angry. You have every right to be angry. Nothing justifies what I did to you. But still, I didn't just -- I wasn't just thinking about me. It was for all of us. I needed to know that you were committed to our baby, too. ", "Nick: Committed? The things I've said to you about children and family, you mustn't have been listening. ", "Bridget: I did. I just never felt it. I do now, though. Nick, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Just forgive me. Please, nick, just forgive me. Now I am honored to presentour next speaker. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Talk to me here. You help me understand this. All your life you've wanted ridge. You spent your whole life waiting for him. He was your destiny. That's what you've always said. ", "Brooke: And I thought he was. But I was so obsessed that I couldn't even see nick standing there, loving me. ", "Eric: Your daughter's fiance? Have you forgotten that already? ", "Brooke: No, eric, I haven't forgotten that. And I haven't forgotten about deacon either. Why do you think I tried so hard not to see what was happening between nick and me? Do you really think I wanted to take another man away from our daughter? ", "Eric: I don't know, brooke. Why don't you tell me? ", "Brooke: No, eric, no, I didn'T. But bridget saw something that i couldn'T.", "Eric: Enough to make her terminate her pregnancy. Well, you must be very proud of yourself. ", "Brooke: Stop it. We weren't going to act on our feelings. Nick was committed to bridget, and he was devastated when she told him what she had done. He blamed himself. ", "Eric: And well he should. ", "Brooke: Eric, we're both to blame. It was a horrible tragedy, and it never should have happened. But out of this tragedy, came this love, eric, that I have been searching my whole life for. And I finally found it. I found it with nick. We finally have a chance at happiness. Now, bridget turned her back on nick. But I can'T. I won'T. Not now, not ever. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bridget: I know that this is a lot to absorb. I really thought that you would be relieved. Your child is alive and -- ", "Nick: Relieved? Did you really just say that? Relieved my child is alive? Yes. I'm relieved my child is alive. ", "Bridget: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply -- if you can just find it in your heart to forgive me, if you can forget about the last couple of days, nothing has to change. ", "Nick: Nothing has to -- you just play with people's emotions? You stick a knife in their heart and you twist it a bit, and then you come up with this little apology, and you tell me nothing has changed? Well, I've changed! I thought that you had killed my child. I felt responsible for it. I was ready to take this boat out into this storm, because being torn up by the ocean would have felt a hell of a lot better than this! ", "Bridget: But you didn'T. You're here, and your child is living inside of me. And we can be a family. ", "Nick: Oh, we can? We can just be a family? And what about what you've put me through? What about what you put your mother through? Do you realize what you've done to your mother? ", "Brooke: I know. I know. I owe her an apology. I just was afraid that I would lose you. I didn't want to lose you to her. I should have known better. I should -- you're different. ", "Nick: We need to talk to your mother. ", "Bridget: Right now? ", "Nick: Right now. ", "Bridget: Okay -- ", "Nick: No, we're not calling. We go over there. ", "Bridget: Wait, nick, no. Wait. Look, my mother will understand. She'll forgive me. You'll see. We have to work this out. Npwe have a child to think about. Baby? ", "Nick: Let's go. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: You do realize that you thought you had found happiness before with other people. With thorne, with me. ", "Brooke: This is different. ", "Eric: How is this different? Because you want it to be? Because you want it to be nick? That he's the true love of your life? ", "Brooke: I know we have a lot of hurdles to overcome. ", "Eric: Not the least of which is your relationship with our daughter. You better hope she's half as strong as you think she is. Because I don't think she could stand another betrayal by you. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nick: Brooke? Brooke? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Nick, I'm so glad you -- ", "Bridget: Mom. ", "Brooke: You talked to nick? ", "Bridget: Yeah. We talked about everything. ", "Brooke: Everything? ", "Bridget: There's a lot that we need to work out, mom. ", "Brooke: You really want to do that? ", "Bridget: Of course I do. Mom, you know that I love you. ", "Brooke: Honey, I love you, too, but -- ", "Nick: Brooke -- ", "Bridget: Can you just -- can you ever forgive me? ", "Brooke: There's nothing to forgive you for. If anything, nick and I -- ", "Bridget: I said some really awful things. I know that. ", "Brooke: You were hurt. ", "Bridget: So you don't hate me for what I've done? ", "Brooke: Honey, we drove you to it. ", "Nick: Brooke -- ", "Brooke: I just wish you'd come to me. I was so worried about you. I wish you had talked to me about this. ", "Bridget: I couldn't even see straight, mom. I'll never forgive myself for the pain I must have caused you. ", "Brooke: No. No, don't blame yourself. ", "Bridget: I'm just really thankful that you had nick to turn to. I'm thankful that you both had each other. ", "Nick: Bridget, tell your mother. ", "Bridget: I understand what your relationship is now. Yours and nick's, I get it. ", "Brooke: Honey, you understood all along. ", "Bridget: But I blew it out of proportion. I really let my insecurities get the better part of me, and I've apologized to nick, and now I just need to apologize to you. ", "Brooke: No, you don't need to apologize for anything. ", "Nick: Bridget! Tell her, now! ", "Bridget: I just did something I really should've never done. But I had to know. ", "Brooke: What? What? ", "Bridget: I had to know that if given the right circumstances, if you and nick would give into your feelings for each other. So I came up with this idea for a -- it was just a stupid test. But it's over now and you passed. ", "Brooke: What did you do? What are you talking about? ", "Bridget: I didn't have an abortion. I told nick I had because I needed to know if he would come running to you, but he didn'T. ", "[ Bridget sighs ] ", "Brooke: So you're having nick's baby? ", "Bridget: Yes, mom. You're going to be a grandmother. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Brooke gasping ] You're still really upset. I don't blame you. I was very deceiving. And I'm so -- mom, I'm so sorry. Please. Mom, just forgive me. I just want to get married and have our baby and live the life that nick promised me we could have. But I can't do that unless you forgive me. Can you just find it in your heart to forgive me? Please? ", "        Please visit our partner sites:"], "Transcript Author": [], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0GiyJId-1U"}
