        "Taylor conveys her regrets that Hector is blind. He apologizes for his actions earlier; what was he thinking? He was so relieved when he realized she was safe. And believes he deserves to be punished for his behavior. Nick has coffee with Harry at Insomnia and tells him to drop the sarcasm about being a big shot. Phoebe slips in and she and Harry make eye contact and notice each other. Phoebe sees Harry take money from the tip jar and calls him on it. He rubs her the wrong way about being one of those \u0091entitled' girls he's met all over the world. Nick calls and asks Phoebe to help him with an old friend to show him the town.",
        "Thorne is mad that Baker is hounding Taylor and Stephanie advises him to drop the investigation. He's not sure he can accept closure by just letting go and someone not paying for Darla's death, but he agrees to do it for the sake of his child. Stephanie tells him he won't regret it. She knows he's getting very attached to Taylor and they will help him through this.",
        "Hector asks if Taylor can forgive him? She's not quite ready but she does understand his actions just like she panicked when she hit Darla. They almost died in the fire but now they have a second chance. He's not sure since all he ever wanted to be was a firefighter. Taylor talks with Hector's doctor and then relays the bad news to Hector. They are not ready to give up on him but feel the eye damage can not be reversed. His life will change but he can adapt. He feels disabled and useless and doesn't want her pity. She helps him up when he falls and they cling to each other and she promises they will get through this together."

        "Harry: There's no way I would pay this much for coffee. I'd just mix up a batch of instant on the marlin.",
        "Nick: Instant's good with me.",
        "Harry: Oh, yeah? Big shot rich guy like you?",
        "Nick: Don't forget that the big shot rich guy's letting you stay on his boat for free. So let's kill the sarcasm, huh?",
        "Harry: Oh, you think it's going to be easy for me to hold that bucket of bolts together? I mean, maybe I'm the one doing you a favor.",
        "Nick: Well, I was about to do you another one, but now you can forget it.",
        "Harry: I was just -- I was kidding.",
        "Nick: You know, I don't have time for this kind of thing, Harry.",
        "Harry: I know.",
        "Nick: I run a very big company. I am not a tour guide.",
        "Harry: Well, I've been around the world and I don't need a tour guide to show me around L.A.",
        "Nick: The one I'm thinking of is awfully cute. Phoebe Forrester. You'll like here.",
        "Harry: She's not as hot as Brooke Forrester, is she?",
        "Nick: Yeah. I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: I didn't know Alexandria feels responsible for phoebe. She's way too young to feel that way --",
        "Stephanie: Honey, I know -- look, you'll make her understand it's not her fault. Just be patient with her.",
        "Thorne: That poor kid.",
        "Stephanie: I don't know that I should have left phoebe at the insomnia.",
        "Thorne: Well, Bridget said she was fine. It was just an anxiety attack, mom. Listen, if you want me to call her --",
        "Stephanie: No! No, no, no --",
        "Thorne: Why? Do you think by speaking to me, it's going to upset her again?",
        "Stephanie: She needs time to get herself together. And so do you.",
        "Thorne: Mom, Phoebe thinks this is her fault. And I need to let her know that it's not.",
        "Stephanie: Her mother is more than capable of helping her to understand that, honey.",
        "Thorne: I know, but I could help, okay? I mean, after everything they've done for me, it's the least I can do for them.",
        "Stephanie: You're really starting to be very attached to Taylor, aren't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Well, did the doctors say they could do anything?",
        "Hector: Nobody can turn back time, Taylor. And no one can stop me from taking you to my house and tying you to the stairs. My God, what was I thinking?",
        "Taylor: You weren't thinking. You were just desperate.",
        "Hector: If I had hurt you --",
        "Taylor: Okay. Come over here and sit down. Stephanie got me out, and we tried to get you out, but we couldn't. The fire was too intense.",
        "Hector: When they told me that you were safe, I was so relieved. When I think of what could have happened, what I could have done -- I deserve this. I deserve this. I put you in harm's way. I endangered your life. I deserve to be punished for this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Hey, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Hey. I haven't seen you in awhile.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah.",

        "Phoebe: I'm busy. Family stuff. But it's evening out now.",
        "Kelly: Usual?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, thanks.",
        "Harry: Yeah, and while you're at it, can you give me a refill?",
        "Kelly: Four bucks.",
        "Harry: I already paid, man.",
        "Phoebe: No free refills in to-go cups.",
        "Harry: You know that's nuts, right? I've been to Sumatra, and the people picking those beans barely make four bucks a year.",
        "Phoebe: Hey, I saw that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Taylor's been a good friend to me.",
        "Stephanie: And you to her.",
        "Thorne: She needed one. What she doesn't need is baker making crazy accusations about her.",
        "Stephanie: Now don't start fretting about that.",
        "Thorne: This guy thinks that Taylor killed Darla.",
        "Stephanie: But he can't prove it, so it doesn't matter what he thinks.",
        "Thorne: Well, of course he can't prove it. But he can scare the two.",
        "Stephanie: Well, we won't let that happen, will we?",
        "Thorne: He was in Phoebe's room tonight, mother. What did he say?",
        "Stephanie: He's not -- he's not going to pursue any of this, all right?",
        "Thorne: Well, I already told him to stay away from them, but he didn't.",
        "Stephanie: Well, he will. Look, you have to do something first, though. Okay?",
        "Thorne: Anything to get him off of Taylor's back.",
        "Stephanie: You have to drop the investigation into Darla's death. I know that's going to be difficult for you, but I think you have to do it. Right now. For good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: You know what, Hector? I think we've wasted enough time, beating ourselves up and wringing our hands. I think it's time for us to move on and start healing.",
        "Hector: You could forgive me?",
        "Taylor: I don't think I'm ready quite yet. But, Hector, I can understand why you panicked. You panicked just I like did, when I hit Darla.",
        "Hector: I was scared for you, Taylor. Not for myself. I want you to know that. And it's no excuse for what I did. I mean, I went way, way too far. But that isn't who I am. All I could think about was stopping you from going to Thorne and telling him what you did. I knew that you would regret it, if I could just convince you --",
        "Taylor: We almost died in the fire. But it's kind of like, you know, we got a second chance. And we can take our mistakes and turn it into something good. Remember, that's what you said to me. That's what you said to me the day you got your award.",
        "Hector: I just don't know who much good I can do like this. All my life, all I ever wanted to be was a firefighter. And now, look at me.",

        "Harry: Of course.",
        "Phoebe: Well, then put it back now.",
        "Harry: I need it now.",
        "Phoebe: More than he does? I mean, these servers pay their bills with that tip money.",
        "Harry: You know, it's funny, I didn't notice you put anything in there.",
        "Phoebe: I was going to.",
        "Harry: Right.",
        "Phoebe: I was.",
        "Harry: Right, because he's your friend.",
        "Phoebe: 'Cause these people work really hard.",
        "Harry: \"These people.\" You don't have a job, do you? I mean, you don't need one, daddy pays all the bill, right?",
        "Phoebe: You don't know anything about me.",
        "Harry: I know people. I've been all over the world. And everywhere that I've been, there's been girls just like you. You've all got that -- that same look.",
        "Phoebe: What look?",
        "Harry: Like you're entitled to something.",
        "Phoebe: I do not.",
        "Harry: It's just your opinion.",
        "Phoebe: I know, and I'm entitled to -- it.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: I can't just give up.",
        "Stephanie: It's exactly what you have to do.",
        "Thorne: Why?",
        "Stephanie: Because you'll never have peace of mind if you don't let it go. And that's what you really want.",
        "Thorne: No, what I want is to -- I want to know who killed my wife, Mother.",
        "Stephanie: I don't think you do, honey. What you want is closure.",
        "Thorne: And I have to believe that I'm going to find it, if I keep looking.",
        "Stephanie: Closure isn't something you just stumble on, sweetheart. It's a decision process. First, you accept what's happened. And then you move on with your life.",
        "Thorne: It's not that simple.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it is.",
        "Thorne: No, it's not.",
        "Stephanie: I didn't say it would be easy, because you want someone to pay.",
        "Thorne: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: Thorne, I believe in my heart -- in my heart -- that whoever did this to Darla is already paying. It's an image that will never leave their mind and they will spend the rest of their life suffering with guilt.",
        "Thorne: You're right. I know, I know. And that should be enough --",
        "Stephanie: And it will be, if you just let go. What are you going to do? Spend the rest of your life filled with frustration and anger? Is that how you want your child to see her father?",
        "Thorne: No, I don't.",
        "Stephanie: Then let it go. Put your focus where it needs to be. On your future and on your child. It will all work out, if you let it go.",
        "Thorne: I guess we have to do these things sometimes for our children. Don't we, Mom?",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, honey. We do. You won't regret it. I'll help you. And Taylor will help you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: I'm so sorry that you're dealing with this, Hector.",
        "Hector: No, I don't want you to feel sorry for me.",
        "Taylor: It isn't sympathy. It's empathy.",
        "Hector: Well, I don't deserve either. And I shouldn't be complaining, because I'm alive.",
        "Taylor: You know the doctor's can do a lot of really amazing things these days.",
        "Hector: I'm afraid to hope.",
        "Taylor: Why don't I go talk to your doctors and find out what they're planning, okay?",
        "Hector: Okay.",
        "Taylor: Hector, I want to you to know whatever you have to deal with, I'll -- I'll be there and I'll help you through it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: So, you don't like women who have opinions?",
        "Harry: Didn't say that --",
        "Phoebe: Then, what, you don't think rich people can be nice?",
        "Harry: Oh, so, you admit it? I was right, you are rich. [Cell phone rings] Oh, don't mind me. Go for it.",
        "Phoebe: Hello.",
        "Nick: Phoebe, it's Nick Marone. I wonder if you would be kind enough to do a favor for me.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, what is it?",
        "Nick: Well, I have a friend in town. He's a little bit older and he knows nothing about L.A. Would you be good enough to show him around?",
        "Phoebe: Well, is he cute?",
        "Nick: Well, he's a sailor, and you know we're all ugly as wet dogs.",
        "Phoebe: You better be kidding.",
        "Nick: I'm kidding. I think you'll have a good time. So, can I call you later and set something up?",
        "Phoebe: Sure.",
        "Nick: Thanks, kiddo.",
        "Phoebe: Bye.",
        "Harry: Hot date?",
        "Phoebe: Potentially. Sounds a lot nicer than the guys you meet hanging around here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Hubert: Ms. Forrester, Dr. Herbert.",
        "Taylor: Hi. Hector Ramirez is a family friend and he's a little concerned about his prognosis.",
        "Dr. Herbert: As am I.",
        "Taylor: Well, I know it'll be a difficult recovery.",
        "Dr. Herbert: It's one of the worst burns I've ever seen.",
        "Taylor: But it's not irreversible, I mean -- he will get his sight back, won't he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Darla loved you more than anything in this world, honey. She wouldn't want you to be angry. She'd want you to be happy.",
        "Thorne: I'm not even sure I remember how.",
        "Stephanie: Give it time.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, but how much time?",
        "Stephanie: Ask Taylor.",
        "Thorne: Taylor has her own life, mom.",
        "Stephanie: True, but you and Alexandria are a significant part of that.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, and she has her own issues to deal with. Her drinking, the divorce --",
        "Stephanie: I understand, but she also needs to focus, like you do. I think maybe helping you and Alexandria will enable her to turn her life around.",
        "Thorne: We sound like a real pair.",
        "Stephanie: But you both have suffered a lot, haven't you? And you've lost a lot. Look, someday you're going to be happy again. You can't see it right now, but I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: Is someone there?",
        "Taylor: It's me, Hector.",
        "Hector: Did you find my doctor?",
        "Taylor: Yeah, I spoke with him.",
        "Hector: And?",
        "Taylor: Well, he doesn't have an official prognosis.",
        "Hector: What, he doesn't know whether I'll get my sight back or not?",
        "Taylor: The damage to your eyes was extensive.",
        "Hector: Right, but he's not ready to give up on me. That's positive, right?",
        "Taylor: No one's giving up on you, Hector.",
        "Hector: It's just going to take some time. An operation or, you know, like you said -- there's all kinds of things that they can do.",
        "Taylor: Not for you.",
        "Hector: But you said he wasn't ready to --",
        "Taylor: No, no, he didn't make it official, but he knows.",
        "Hector: The damage can't be reversed?",
        "Taylor: No.",
        "Hector: I'll never see again.",
        "Taylor: Hector, you're a strong man. Your life will change, but you can adapt. You'll adapt to it.",
        "Hector: I can't be a fireman.",
        "Taylor: You can still help people. You can.",
        "Hector: I will.",
        "Taylor: You will, you will.",
        "Hector: I'm disabled, I'm not useless.",
        "Taylor: That's right. That's right, Hector. Oh, God. Oh, my God.",
        "Hector: I'm not useless!",
        "Taylor: You're going to get through this. You will. You'll get through this. I'll help you. I'll help you through this."
