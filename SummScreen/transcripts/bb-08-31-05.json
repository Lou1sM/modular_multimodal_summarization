        "Bridget: But if you're not gonna forgive me --",
        "Nick: I didn't say that. I just think we have to -- you said you haven't eaten. Why don't you let me go below and rustle you something up, huh?",

        "Jackie: I had no idea.",
        "Nick: Well, now you do. And to make sure that she wasn't crazy, completely out of her mind, she wanted to test my feelings for her mother, to make sure that I wouldn't run back into her arms, because that's what all the experts said I'd do.",
