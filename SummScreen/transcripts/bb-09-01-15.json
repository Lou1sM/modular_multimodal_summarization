        "Ridge sits in his loft and looks over the papers remembering he told Caroline he can not be that man to give her a child. Caroline is in a hotel room when Thomas calls. He assumes she is with his dad and wants her to ask him a question. He hears her crying and she blurts out that she is not with him. She is in a hotel and Thomas says he is on the way. She opens up the bottle of Pam's anxiety pills and takes one ..then another. Maya and Rick sip martinis and relive their honeymoon. Brooke stops by Ridge's to give him some papers for tomorrow's meeting. He invites her in and proceeds to tell her that Caroline is not there so he is not in the middle of anything. He broke it off with her. She sees how upset he is over this and she feels guilty if she talked him into it. But for whatever it is worth she thinks he made the right decision. It goes further. He shows her a paper he got in Paris where he got a vasectomy.",
        "Caroline lets Thomas in and fills him in on Ridge's decision. He is sorry she is hurting and says he was just with Brooke and got the impression Ridge was going to give her a baby. Caroline pours some wine for both. She says she was not thrilled but she thought after all they have been through together she could accept just Ridge without a child, but she was not expecting it like this. He says he hates seeing how much his dad has hurt her. She rambles that she does not need kids if it means she can not be with Ridge. She does not understand this. Sipping more wine, Thomas sits behind her on the bed and massages her shoulders. She says she would give up that dream to be with Ridge and maybe he would change his mind down the road. She lies down on the bed and Thomas sits by her. He says he admires his dad in a lot of ways but not the way he treats the women in his life ..not Caroline. After his own mom's and Brooke's disappointments he realizes Ridge only lives in the moment. She cries that is the way it is now. He does not want a future with her. Thomas says he is lucky he is not wired that way and he is lucky if he gets another opportunity with her. She says he always has been a good friend. He says she needs someone who appreciates her. The room turns into a blur and she loves the words coming out of his mouth. She closes her eyes and Thomas leans over and kisses her sweetly."

        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: For good. I ended it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: [Scoffs] You really didn't have to come.",
        "Thomas: Of course, I did. The way -- the way you sounded on the phone. You're staying in a hotel. What happened?",
        "Caroline: I'm sure you can imagine.",
        "Thomas: You and dad got in a fight.",
        "Caroline: He ended things.",
        "Thomas: He what?",
        "Caroline: Yeah, he said, um, that I want a family and he doesn't, so...",
        "Thomas: Caroline, I --",
        "Caroline: He said that he wants me to, um... be a mother, but that he -- he can't be the father, so, there's that.",
        "Thomas: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So, you ended it. But you basically said that you were giving in, that you were gonna have a child with Caroline so that she could have that experience.",
        "Ridge: And she should.",
        "Brooke: Just not with you? Are you sure this is what you want?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] You said yourself, it's crazy to start a family at this point in the game.",
        "Brooke: Yes, it is crazy. But I can see how upset you are. And if you really love Caroline --",
        "Ridge: That's why I'm doing it.",
        "Brooke: Well, is it that important for her to have a family? You really need to break up over this?",
        "Ridge: She was pretending otherwise, but...it is, and she would have kept pretending if I hadn't put a stop to it.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Now I'm feeling kind of guilty. If I talked you into this --",
        "Ridge: It's nothing to do with -- no, I knew all that already. I just didn't want to face it. I've raised my kids. That part of my life is over, and Caroline, she's... just getting started, so I let her go so she can find someone who can have a kid with her. That's not me. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I was just with Brooke. She had the impression that -- that dad was changing his mind, that he was -- that he was willing to have a baby with you.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, that's kind of what I thought at first, too. He started talking about me having a baby, about wanting me to have one, you know? Thanks for not making me drink by myself, by the way.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] I wish there was something that I could say. He's not capable of staying in a relationship. I am so sorry.",
        "Caroline: You know, that's what was so strange. It was like, the way he was looking at me and the way that he was acting, he was like... acting like ending things was what was best for me, and that's what I don't understand.",
        "Thomas: Well, maybe he does believe that. Caroline, if having a baby is that important to you --",
        "Caroline: I mean, it is, you know? It is. It's something that I thought I...I would do, you know? Have a child of my own, and... raise it and love it. And then I met Ridge and, you know, he's a man who has children that are grown, and he doesn't want any more, and... I was okay with that. You know, I mean, I wasn't... I wasn't thrilled about it, you know? It's definitely something that I thought...that I knew that I would be giving up. But I think that's what relationships are about -- they're compromises, and... then out of nowhere, he just decides that this is something that I can't live without and then -- and just ends things. And that's...just like, after everything that we've been through, for him just to say like, \"oh, you want kids and I don't,\" so that's like goodbye, like... and I don't know what do to, Thomas, because I don't know how not to love him.",

        "Thomas: I...I hate seeing how much my dad has hurt you.",
        "Caroline: [Whimpers] I told him I'd choose him... over having kids, that... that he was worth it.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, but that's -- that's one of my dad's flaws. You know, he thinks that he knows what's right for everyone.",
        "Caroline: You know what I'm gonna do? I'm just gonna never have kids. Ever. That will show him.",
        "Thomas: Or...live your life. You have kids or you don't, but you don't let my dad affect that decision, either way.",
        "Caroline: He affects my every decision I make. Because he's the man that I -- I want to be with, so... how does he not see? I don't need to have kids. I just -- not if it means I can't be with him. I don't...",
        "Thomas: And you told him that?",
        "Caroline: It's just an excuse 'cause he wants to get rid of me. He doesn't...",
        "Thomas: No. I do not believe that. I saw how much he cared about you.",
        "Caroline: He just kept saying that I could have kids and have a baby, that it just can't be his, that he just can't... and I don't understand. I don't understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: What aren't you telling me? After all these years, you don't think I can tell when you're hiding something? What is it? What did Caroline do?",
        "Ridge: Caroline didn't do anything. This is all on me.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Ridge: What is that look? I -- you advised me and you were right. This is the right thing to do.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I think it is the right thing to do. Caroline should have known who she was getting involved with. She shouldn't have expected you to have a child with her.",
        "Ridge: She didn't, but she should have one, and now she can find someone that can give that to her.",
        "Brooke: Well, it's not like you can't -- you just won't.",
        "Ridge: No, I can't.",
        "Brooke: What are you talking about?",
        "Ridge: When I was living in Paris...I knew I didn't want any more children.",
        "Brooke: Oh! Okay. So, you had a vasectomy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: You know, the thing is, is that...Ridge and I would make really great parents... if he could just forget about the age difference and his kids, you know, and, like, whatever his hang-ups are, you know? I don't get it.",
        "Thomas: It sounds -- it sounds to me like -- like you really want kids.",
        "Caroline: Well, yeah.",
        "Thomas: So, when you say, \"it doesn't matter,\" I'm thinking he's seeing what I'm seeing and that -- that you're giving up too much to be with him.",
        "Caroline: But I would give it up. I would...I would give up that dream to be with him for, like, at least, a little while. And maybe he would change his mind down the road.",
        "Thomas: But if he's -- if he's past the age of -- of wanting kids...",
        "Caroline: I just feel like maybe he would change his mind if he just saw me holding his baby.",
        "Thomas: [Clears throat]",
        "Caroline: You know what I mean, Thomas?",
        "Thomas: [Sighing] Okay. I... [Clears throat] I admire my dad in a lot of ways. [Chuckling] And I try to emulate him in some. It's stupid. But -- but the thing that I don't understand -- I don't -- and the thing that -- that I'm determined to do differently... and that -- that is the way that he treats the women in his life. You. You know, after -- after living through my mom's disappointments and Brooke's...it's just -- it's just whatever suits him in the moment.",
        "Caroline: See, that's... that's it. That's exactly what he says to me. He says, \"in the moment, in the moment,\" you know? And...and it's just because he doesn't want a future with me. And that's it. It's why he says that. He doesn't want a future with me.",
        "Thomas: Mm. See, well, that's never been his style. Dad has...no... you know, I'm... I'm not wired that way. I'm not. If I was ever lucky enough to have another chance with you... I would love that... love that opportunity.",
        "Caroline: You're such a good friend to me. You know, you've always been such a good friend. Like, you...you really have been always a good friend.",
        "Thomas: But -- but you and I could be -- could be so much more than friends, and we are. You know? Well, I mean, we were before, but we could be again. You know, you -- you need somebody who appreciates you for who you are and everything that you've done and everything that you've accomplished. You've -- you've survived a horrific car accident, and -- and you're a survivor. And you're so -- you're so talented. And you're so beautiful.",
        "Caroline: That's really nice."
