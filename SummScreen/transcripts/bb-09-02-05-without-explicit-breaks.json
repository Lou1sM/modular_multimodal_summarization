        "[missing first half of \r\nshow due to news coverage of Katrina.]",
        "Taylor: \r\nShe knew what your intentions were. ",
        "Thomas: I told her it \r\nwould be all right. And it should be. We're married. ",
        "Taylor: In name only.\r\n",
        "Thomas: Well, not any \r\nmore. ",
        "Taylor: Nothing's changed, \r\nThomas. ",
        "Thomas: Yes, I have. These \r\nlast few months have been the most confusing, overwhelming months for me. You \r\nand dad got back together, now you're splitting up again, my first fashion show, \r\ngetting ready for college. I don't know what I would've done without Gaby's \r\nsupport. ",
        "Taylor: And I'm very \r\ngrateful about that, Thomas. But you just said yourself that you are confused.\r\n",
        "Thomas: Well not about \r\nher. I love her, Mom. ",
        "Taylor: Ridge was exactly \r\nright. This was a mistake. It was a mistake for me to lie to Agent Dunn. It was \r\na mistake because I sent you the wrong message. Obviously, you think it's okay \r\nto break the rules. ",
        "Thomas: Well, sometimes \r\nthe rules are wrong. ",
        "Taylor: No, no, I was \r\nwrong. I was wrong because I thought that you two could control yourselves, but \r\nyou can't. This whole situation is wrong. I mean, my heart was in the right \r\nplace, because I was trying to help Gaby because we had a special relationship \r\nwith her mother. But now this whole thing is out of hand. ",
        "Thomas: Because of me. All \r\nright, it was my fault. Me. Gaby had nothing to do with it. It was me. And she \r\nshouldn't have to pay for -- mom, please. We didn't do anything. And we won't. \r\nJust please -- let her stay and we won't cross that line again. ",
        "Taylor: All right, Gaby \r\ncan stay the night. And then tomorrow morning when we're all just a little bit \r\ncalmer, we can talk about this and come to some sort of compromise. Like maybe \r\ngoing to visit your cousins in Phoenix. ",
        "Thomas: Okay, okay, we'll \r\ntalk in the morning. We'll figure something out. ",
        "Taylor: Okay, go on up to \r\nyour room, Gaby. ",
        "Gaby: I'm sorry if we \r\nupset you, Mrs. Forrester. But I think that if you'd just hear Thomas out that \r\n-- ",
        "Taylor: It'll be \r\ninteresting to hear what you both have to say tomorrow. ",
        "Gaby: I don't want you to \r\nthink I'm trying to turn Thomas against you 'cause I'm not. ",
        "Taylor: Good night, Gaby.\r\n",
        "Gaby: Good night. \n",
        "Thomas: This was supposed \r\nto be our night, Gaby. It can't end like this. ",
        "\r\n************************************************************************",
        "Bridget: Dad, what -- what \r\ndo you mean? Are you saying that I shouldn't trust them? ",
        "Eric: Honey, I'm just -- \r\nI'm just concerned for you, that's all. This isn't like you, you know? Telling \r\nnick that you had an abortion when you didn't. ",
        "Bridget: I guess I just \r\ncouldn't handle it anymore. When I saw them together, there was just -- there \r\nwas something there. It was like there was this connection. And then they \r\nfinally admitted it. But I knew it. I knew it the whole time. Deep down I just \r\n-- that's what was driving me crazy. I could feel it. ",
        "Eric: They have feelings \r\nfor each other. ",
        "Bridget: No, Dad, they had \r\nfeelings for each other, but they've dealt with them and they've put it all \r\nbehind them. Look, I know this is a lot to digest. But the important thing is \r\nNick and I are okay. We're going to have a baby and you are going to be a \r\ngrandpa again. Dad, come on, aren't you excited? ",
        "Eric: Well, of course, I'm \r\nexcited about this baby, especially if you are. I'm your father. You're my \r\ndaughter. I want you to be happy. ",
        "Bridget: I am. I feel so \r\nincredibly blessed. I know that nick and I are going to have a wonderful life \r\ntogether with our child. And knowing I have the support of both of my parents \r\nmakes it so much better. ",
        "\r\n************************************************************",
        "Nick: Maybe I'm letting \r\nBridget down by lying to her. Have you thought about that? ",
        "Brooke: You're not lying \r\nto her. You do love her. ",
        "Nick: Not the way I love \r\nyou. ",
        "Brooke: Don't say that.\r\n",
        "Nick: I know you don't \r\nwant to hear it. I didn't either, but my mother finally got through to me.\r\n",
        "Brooke: Your mother?\r\n",
        "Nick: Yeah, that's right. \r\nShe was right. All along. About everything. She saw it and we didn't. And now we \r\ndo, and we can't turn our backs on it. ",
        "Brooke: Yes, we can. We \r\nhave to. We have to do whatever it takes to keep Bridget happy. ",
        "Nick: She'll see through \r\nit. She'll see through it. ",
        "Brooke: Well, then it \r\ncan't be an act. Nick, whatever is going on between us, it has to end. Right \r\nhere, right now. Look, I am not going to disappoint my daughter again. You \r\nweren't there. You didn't have to live through it. ",
        "Nick: But you know this \r\nisn't the same. ",
        "Brooke: I won't do it. I \r\nwon't do it to myself. And I won't do it to my daughter. It's not going to \r\nhappen. ",

        "Gaby: Mrs. Forrester? \r\nThomas -- ",
        "Thomas: Hey, quick, let me \r\nin. ",
        "Gaby: What are you doing \r\nhere? ",
        "Thomas: I couldn't stand \r\nto be anywhere else. ",
        "Gaby: What are you talking \r\nabout? Thomas -- Thomas, we can't do this. ",
        "Thomas: What? Why, because \r\nmy mom says we can't? Forget about my mom. ",
        "Gaby: She's already angry \r\nwith us. ",
        "Thomas: There's no point \r\nin her being angry about nothing, is there? ",
        "Gaby: I'll be deported.\r\n",
        "Thomas: I won't let that \r\nhappen. ",
        "Gaby: Thomas -- \n",
        "Thomas: Trust me. \n",
        "\r\n***********************************************************",
        "Taylor: Ridge, it's me. We \r\nneed to talk. Well, you were right. I made a major mistake about Thomas and \r\nGaby. It was a mistake to let her stay here. Thomas is all worked up. I caught \r\nthem together, Ridge. If I hadn't walked in when I did -- it's just lucky that I \r\nshowed up when I did, because this family is in enough trouble as it is. \n",
        "\r\n***************************************************",
        "Gaby: I love you, Thomas.\r\n",
        "Thomas: I love you, too.\r\n",

        "Brooke: Please, just go.\r\n",
        "Nick: You can't look at me \r\nbecause you're afraid, and you don't have to be. ",
        "Brooke: I'm afraid for my \r\ndaughter. ",
        "Nick: We have to be honest \r\nwith her. ",
        "Brooke: The way we were \r\nbefore, Nick? You saw how Bridget reacted. ",
        "Nick: This is not like \r\nbefore! ",
        "Brooke: This is not going \r\nto happen! ",
        "Nick: It already has \r\nhappened! Come on, Brooke, you've searched your whole life for a man to love you \r\nthe way you needed, and you thought it was Forrester. But you were wrong. He let \r\nyou down. He wasn't there for you, but I was. And I always have been. And I am \r\nnot going to lie about this. I am not going hide this because I want to be with \r\nyou. I want to touch you. I want to make love to you. ",
        "Brooke: Stop it. \n",
        "Nick: I need you. \n",
        "Brooke: No, Bridget needs \r\nyou. Your baby needs you. ",
