        "Brooke cannot believe that Ridge broke it off with Caroline just because he had a vasectomy. It happened when she was in Paris. He was not seeing anyone and he told no one. He did not know if his relationship with Caroline would last, and he saw no reason to bring it up. He explains that now she wants children. He told her that he didn't. When she wakes up and knows the truth she will understand. Caroline does wake up naked in bed and is astounded when she finds Thomas laying beside her. She remembers nothing of how he got there and asks him to explain, but she will not let him touch her. He says he told her how he felt and it was mutual; they made love. She becomes hysterical and even more so when she says she remembers nothing except that she did take some pills before he came over. He claims he knew nothing about that and while she was a little emotional he thought she was okay. He would never take advantage of her. They talked a long time before anything happened. She says she is not that kind of girl who would date his father and then turn around and make love to his son. She screams when Thomas tries to explain how it happened and tells him to get out. He grabs his clothes and leaves. She is crying when Ridge calls and wants to talk to her.",
        "Steffy storms into Wyatt's house looking for Ivy. She says she asked Wyatt to delete the video. Now she is not asking, she is demanding that he do so. She wants all copies destroyed and knows Wyatt can find them and make it happen. She does not care what kind of bind he will be in with Ivy. She can not control her life with his video. If she takes it to the police Steffy will be the #1 prime suspect and skewered by the media. Ivy already thinks she owns her. She said that directly to her face. Wyatt tells her that she put herself in this position. She should have told the police everything and let them sort it out. He saw no rock in the video that Steffy insists Aly had. She knows Ivy will not change her mind but she is hoping Wyatt will. He says Liam could not help her so now she is counting on Wyatt and calling him a good person because she expects a favor. Caroline hangs up on Ridge. She curls up crying hysterically. Brooke is shocked. She tells Ridge that vasectomies can be reversed. He needs to go find Caroline and make it right."

        "Brooke: You had a vasectomy?! That's why you broke it off with Caroline?",
        "Ridge: Not every woman wants to have children, but Caroline does, and I can't allow her to throw that away because of me, 'cause she would.",
        "Brooke: She doesn't think you want children, not that you can't!",
        "Ridge: She doesn't understand that now, but she will.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: When she left here, she was hurt. She was upset. She was confused. When she wakes up, it's all gonna make sense to her.",

        "Caroline: Ridge?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Ivy?!",
        "Wyatt: She's not here.",
        "Steffy: Where is she? Is she at the house?",
        "Wyatt: Well, I don't think you should go there all riled up like this.",
        "Steffy: I am not riled up, Wyatt! I am done! I came to you before! I asked you to delete the video! I am not asking this time! I want every copy destroyed. So tell me where it is. Where is the damn video?! I know Ivy has it on her phone. Where else?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know.",
        "Steffy: Find out.",
        "Wyatt: Steffy, we've been through this. I told you --",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. I don't care what this could do to your relationship -- the bind it could put you in. It is nothing compared to what that video can do to me! I won't let that happen. I am through trying to reason with you people! Ivy thinks that she can control me with that video -- make it look like I committed murder. No. That game is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You just decided? That's it? You're done?",
        "Ridge: I was living in Paris on my own. I was clearing my head, and I figured it was time. I had raised my kids.",
        "Brooke: Were you seeing somebody?",
        "Ridge: Nope -- made the decision all on my own.",
        "Brooke: So, you didn't tell anybody about this?",
        "Ridge: Why? What's the point?",
        "Brooke: And then there was Caroline.",
        "Ridge: Then there was Caroline. And that was unexpected. I -- mm. By the time I figured out what was happening, it was already happening, and I just didn't want it to stop. It was new and exciting.",
        "Brooke: And who knew how long that would last?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. The issue of children -- I don't know -- I thought maybe it wouldn't come up. Maybe I was hoping it wouldn't come up. But when it did come up, I knew I was being unfair. And -- and that's when I let her go so she could find someone to have a family with, and I didn't tell her about the vasectomy, because I knew she would stay with me, and I didn't want that for her. [Sighs] Don't look at me like that. Yeah, maybe I should have told her about it, but that's just gonna confuse things even more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: What happened? Why are you here?",
        "Thomas: Oh, you think I would just leave you? Hey, I-I wouldn't do that to you.",
        "Caroline: No! Don't touch me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Your girlfriend's out of control. You better do something about it.",
        "Wyatt: Is that a threat?",
        "Steffy: What?!",
        "Wyatt: Because the last person you said that to --",
        "Steffy: Oh, no, no. Don't even go there. Ivy thinks she owns me, and she doesn't.",
        "Wyatt: Nobody owns you, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: That's what Ivy said to me! That's exactly what she said, right to my face.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Steffy: Don't you get it? Don't you see why this has to end? If Ivy takes that video to the police, I am prime suspect number 1. If that video goes viral, I get massacred by the media.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. So, what do you want?!",
        "Steffy: Every...trace...of that video...gone... for good.",
        "Wyatt: That's a tall order.",
        "Steffy: Not for anyone who has a conscience. For somebody like that, it should be simple. Deleting the video is the right thing to do.",

        "Ridge: I don't.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, you didn't tell her everything.",
        "Ridge: What else is there to say? She wants a family. I can't give her one.",
        "Brooke: You had a vasectomy!",
        "Ridge: I know what I did, and it just -- it doesn't make a difference.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. At least she would understand.",
        "Ridge: It's not about understanding something. It's about giving her what she wants, what she should have. She's gonna be a great mom, and I'm not gonna be the one that stands in her way. I'm not gonna take that away from her.",
        "Brooke: Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Ridge: If it were possible for me to be with Caroline, I would never let her go.",

        "Caroline: What happened?",
        "Thomas: We fell asleep.",
        "Caroline: I -- no, I don't -- how -- how did -- how did we -- h--",
        "Thomas: You told me where you were, and I was very concerned about you, okay?",
        "Caroline: Ridge.",
        "Thomas: Hey. You don't have to talk about that right now. It's okay. All right? You don't have to worry about that ever again. All right? Hey. Come --",
        "Caroline: D-d-did we... no. No, no, no. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't do that. [Crying]",
        "Thomas: Seriously, Caroline, you don't remember anything? Okay. We talked. I told you how I felt, and -- and -- and I asked if I could show you. All right? You reached out to me, Caroline. We made love.",

        "Wyatt: Hey, I'm not the one looking like a criminal here.",
        "Steffy: Blackmail is a crime, too -- intimidation, extortion.",
        "Wyatt: It isn't murder.",
        "Steffy: It was self-defense. Aly was holding a rock over my head.",
        "Wyatt: There's no rock in the video!",
        "Steffy: No, you didn't see it, but I did! I had to defend myself!",
        "Wyatt: You could have told that to the police. Look, Ivy didn't put you in this position, Steffy. She gave you a chance to come clean.",
        "Steffy: I'm not gonna confess to a crime that I did not commit.",
        "Wyatt: Well, you can't deny what's on that video, either.",
        "Steffy: I'm not gonna live in fear for the rest of my life, so if you're trying to play this little game --",
        "Wyatt: Don't you think that's just a little dramatic -- \"the rest of my life\"?",
        "Steffy: As long as Ivy has that video, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Steffy: Why do you think she hasn't gotten rid of it? If she only wanted to be the model, it would have been gone, but she's not erasing it. She's holding it over my head, just like Aly. Wyatt, I know you're a good guy, and I used to think Ivy was a good person, but now --",
        "Wyatt: She is.",
        "Steffy: What she's doing to me isn't, and you know that. She's changed. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe... maybe you have, too. Ivy's made up her mind about me. I can't convince her to stop it, okay? But I have to protect myself. Are you gonna help me or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You made the right decision.",
        "Ridge: You would say that.",
        "Brooke: Because I understand. A vasectomy, ending thing with Caroline -- it all goes back to the way you want to live your life. And, yes, you and Caroline were great for each other. You inspired her, and she encouraged you, and... your paths crossed for a while, but you were never really on the same course.",
        "Ridge: Hmm. Kind of thought that we were.",
        "Brooke: That's because you live in the moment, and moments don't usually last. You know how hard it is to raise a child like that... how it was with RJ.",
        "Ridge: I do.",
        "Brooke: Well, children need stability. They need consistency. Parents need to stick to a plan and see it through.",
        "Ridge: Well, plans change. You and I should know that better than anyone.",
        "Brooke: Yes, marriages get annulled... and vasectomies can sometimes be reversed. Is that what you're considering?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Come on, Caroline. You've got to remember it's okay. Everything's fine. Everything's gonna be fine.",
        "Caroline: Oh, God. My head. I can't -- I don't even -- I can't -- [Sniffles] The pills. Ohh.",
        "Thomas: The what?",
        "Caroline: Oh, God! I took pills before you got here.",
        "Thomas: What pills did you take?",
        "Caroline: I took anti-anxiety pills before you got here, because I was so upset about everything! I took pills!",
        "Thomas: And we drank -- we drank so much.",
        "Caroline: And then what? I don't know what happened? Did I get drunk? Did I -- did I pass out?",
        "Thomas: No. No. No, no, no, no. You did not pass out, okay? No. All right? You seriously don't remember anything?",
        "Caroline: I didn't want that! I didn't want that! I didn't want it!",
        "Thomas: Caroline... what are you saying?",
        "Caroline: [Crying]",
        "Thomas: No. No. I-I-I wouldn't -- I would never -- Caroline, Caroline, you know me. I-I would never take advantage of you like that.",
        "Caroline: Then how come I don't remember?!",
        "Thomas: It's because of the pills, Caroline -- because of the pills! Once they wear off -- once they wear off, everything's gonna be fine. You're gonna remember I was here for you after what my father did, after he pushed you away like that. Caroline, I-I told you how special you are and how much you mean to me. Caroline, it was -- it was so special. It was so beautiful.",
        "Caroline: [Crying continues]",
        "Thomas: I-I swear to God, I did not know about these -- these pills.",
        "Caroline: How could you not tell?!",
        "Thomas: You were just emotional, Caroline! That was it. I-I-I asked you. Why didn't you say something? God! God! Why didn't you say anything about -- about these pills? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? That came out wrong, but -- it was so -- it was so special, what we had. It was amazing.",
        "Caroline: It was amazing?! It was amazing?! How could you do that to me?!",
        "Thomas: I didn't do anything, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: What are you talking about?! I told you about Ridge, and you saw how emotional I was! How could you not tell, Thomas?! How could you not know?! You had to have known! You had to have known!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: So, you want me to get the video for you?",
        "Steffy: If I could do this myself, I would.",
        "Wyatt: I thought you were done playing games, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: I am.",
        "Wyatt: Yet here you are, telling me how good of a person I am.",
        "Steffy: Was I wrong about that?",
        "Wyatt: You need help. Why don't you ask your boyfriend? Liam's been the white knight of this family lately. He's saving Forrester from Rick, protecting my cousin and my dad's stake in the company. I'm sure he'd love to jump at the chance to be a hero for you. Oh, but wait -- you did ask him, didn't you?",
        "Steffy: I'm not looking for a hero.",
        "Wyatt: No. You want results, and he failed you.",
        "Steffy: Ivy wouldn't listen to Liam, okay?",
        "Wyatt: He failed her, too! You know, that seems to be, like, a running theme with him -- just letting people down.",
        "Steffy: God. You sound so bitter.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, you put your faith in him, you're gonna end up sounding the same way, too.",
        "Steffy: Is that how Ivy feels? Is that why you're siding with her -- because you guys are mad that Liam and I are back together?",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] Oh, my God.",
        "Steffy: Now, I don't want to believe that -- not about you, not about Ivy, but you have to see it from my point of view. What other reason could there be? All Ivy's talk about justice for Aly -- then why doesn't she just go to the police?",
        "Wyatt: Is that what you want? You want her to go to the police?",
        "Steffy: No, I-I don't. But I don't want to live under this shadow, either. Do you? As long as this video exists, we can't heal. We can't move on with our lives. Wyatt, doing nothing is not helping anyone. You're allowing Ivy to blackmail me. How can you support this? You have to do the right thing -- for all of us. Put this behind us. Help me. Help me get rid of that video.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Caroline, I promise you, what happened between us was absolutely mutual.",
        "Caroline: [Crying] No. It was the pills and the wine.",
        "Thomas: Caroline, you were not that out of it. I-I-I promise, we talked for such a long time before anything ever happened. You -- you opened up to me. You opened up to me, and I -- and I th-- I thought that you wanted me.",
        "Caroline: Did I say that?!",
        "Thomas: You kissed me back, Caroline!",
        "Caroline: I'm in love with your father! Is that the kind of woman that you think I am -- that I lose the man that I love and I just -- I would just...with you? Because that's not -- I'm not that kind of person!",
        "Thomas: Caroline, you are making it sound like I did something wrong here.",
        "Caroline: You did do something wrong here!",
        "Thomas: I didn't know! I didn't know about any pills! If I knew, I would have stopped right away, but -- but, Caroline, you didn't stop, either.",
        "Caroline: Get out.",
        "Thomas: Just stop.",
        "Caroline: No.",
        "Thomas: You have to believe me. I would never do this to you!",
        "Caroline: I want you to leave! Get out! Go!",
        "Thomas: Please! Please!",
        "Caroline: Now, Thomas! Get out! [Crying]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Caroline: [Sniffles] [Crying] Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Caroline. I'm glad you picked up.",
        "Caroline: [Crying continues]",
        "Ridge: Are you crying? I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Caroline: Oh, please don't do that right now, please.",
        "Ridge: Tell me where you are. I need to see you.",
        "Caroline: Wh-why?",
        "Ridge: 'Cause I need to talk to you.",
        "Caroline: No. I-I can't. Bye. [Crying continues]",
        "Brooke: She hung up.",
        "Ridge: She's a mess. I let her down, Logan. I got to go find her and talk to her. And until I do, I don't want you saying anything about this vasectomy.",
        "Brooke: Okay, wait. Wait. Ridge! You're not thinking about getting back with her, having a baby with her? Come on. What are you gonna do?",
