    "Recap": [
        "Ridge tells Sanchez to take it easy. Thomas just took a very bad fall. Det. Sanchez says he is aware of that. All he wants to ask Thomas if he fell or was he pushed. Wyatt starts to kiss Sally and she tells the cowboy to hold his roll. She's not sure she wants to jump back in headfirst. She seems to enjoy giving him a hard time. He says he can do better than that first kiss. And they can make this relationship whatever they want it to be. Sally had her second chance so now he wants his too. They joke about his chewing his breakfast cereal and other things. He wants to take her to dinner for a real date. She apologizes again for not telling him the truth about Thomas. Perhaps some of this could have been avoided. Wyatt says he does not want him to die but he got himself into all this mess so he will pay for his actions. He mentions Flo too sitting in a jail cell, one deception after another. That's why he hopes they can all move past this. She says he seems pretty confident. Thomas tells Det. Sanchez that no one pushed him; it was an accident. Brooke gives a quiet sigh of relief. Sanchez asks Thomas if he is positive and Thomas says yes, he fell. Before the detective leaves he tells Thomas not to leave town. There is new information that he needs to get from Xander and Flo. Ridge begs for just a little time and Hope and Liam stay as well. Thomas says he has no one to blame but himself. Brooke was only trying to protect her daughter thinking he was hurting her. He does not know what made him do the things he did. He was being selfish but he guarantees them he will never do anything like that again. He knows he has no right to ask for their forgiveness. But he did it out of love for her. He meant his vows. Douglas really wanted Hope to be his mother. Thomas wanted her too for Douglas's mother. And he is sorry that he knew the truth but kept Beth's whereabouts from her. He tells Hope that he loves her and hopes someday she can forgive him. The doctor comes back in and says that is enough. He tells Ridge and Brooke that considering the fall, there seems to be no setbacks .no paralysis, no broken bones or even concussion. So he would just like to keep him for another day or two for the swelling to go down. They can consider themselves lucky.",
        "Ridge tells Brooke that's a relief. And Thomas is not the only one who should feel lucky. She must be relieved that Thomas did not tell the detective the truth. He pulls away when she tries to put her hand on his. He says he saw her push Thomas whether it was intentional or not. Liam and Hope talk and she is grateful that Thomas did not say her mother pushed him. Liam says yes, he was not sure where he was going. She says Thomas's apology is not enough, not even close. There are so many firsts with Beth they have missed. He admits that is true but look at it this way. There will be so many more firsts they will see and enjoy now. Brooke and Ridge sit and talk. He tells her she got off lucky that Thomas did not tell the truth. He saw her push him. She tries to explain one more time that she was only protecting her daughter. She saw Thomas put his hands on her daughter's arms and thoughts went flashing through her head of things Thomas has done and could do to Hope. Ridge is staunch in his views. He saw what he saw. She pushed him off the cliff and he could have died. They are lucky he is still with them. She says she is sure he was frightened but so was she. And Ridge needs to understand what she saw. And why they went over to the cliff house in the first place because they knew Thomas would be there and were afraid. He says again that he saw what he saw and that was Brooke shoving his son so they are going to see this differently. He was not afraid when he went to Steffy's. He told her he would handle it. Now he is only concerned with what just happened in Thomas's room. She should be glad Thomas did not tell the detective the truth. In fact instead of badmouthing his son she should go in there and thank him. She cries no, she is not going to grovel and show her gratitude. It was an accident and she does not believe for a minute that Thomas's apology is real. She thinks he is still trying to manipulate Hope. Ridge says he does not believe Brooke. Thomas is still in the hospital because of her. She fires back that Thomas is in the hospital because of his sick, twisted obsession of Hope and it won't just end here. Thomas is going to have to pay for what he has done to Hope."

        "Ridge: Detective, take it easy on him. He's just woke up from a very bad fall.",
        "Det. Sanchez: That's why I'm here. Thomas? Are you ready to talk to me? Detective, you really need to make this brief. He needs his rest.",
        "Det. Sanchez: I'd just like an answer to my question about the fall. Thomas. Was it an accident? Or did somebody push you?",
        "Wyatt: So, how was that?",
        "Sally: For you, or for me?",
        "Wyatt: For me, it was like a -- a 10. On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 10!",
        "Sally: It was all right.",
        "Wyatt: All right? Our first kiss in months was \"all right,\" that's it?",
        "Sally: It wasn't your best.",
        "Wyatt: Psht!",
        "Sally: I was just saying.",
        "Wyatt: Would you give me another shot? A chance to redeem myself? I mean, I couldn't have lost my mojo these past few months.",
        "Sally: You should give me another try. You should, you know...",
        "Sally: Ah! Slow your roll, cowboy.",
        "Wyatt: You -- [ Sighs ]",
        "Wyatt: You set me right up for that one.",
        "Sally: I think you set yourself up, my friend.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Sally: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, as I recall, weren't you the one who said something about a second chance?",
        "Sally: I did?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Sally: Mm. Okay, maybe I did, but I don't know if I'm ready to dive in head- first.",
        "Wyatt: What, for another kiss?",
        "Sally: For whatever this is.",
        "Wyatt: Look, this -- this is whatever we want it to be.",
        "Sally: [ Groans ] It just seems like a whole lot of \"too good to be true,\" if you ask me.",
        "Wyatt: So we'll take it slow. Or fast. Fast is good. I -- I err on the side of fast, that's better.",
        "Sally: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: It's your decision, really, but it's, you know --",
        "Sally: Honestly?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Sally: I'm just really glad that you're even talking to me, after what I did, that this is even a possibility.",
        "Wyatt: I wasn't exactly mr. Maturity, either. I mean, I -- I did slightly overreact.",
        "Sally: A tiny bit, yeah. But I do get why you were mad. I mean, I should have told you what thomas was up to. I -- I hate that I ever agreed to being his confidant. I mean, obviously he was just using me.",
        "Wyatt: All right, thomas will use anyone and anything to get what he wants.",
        "Det. Sanchez: Thomas, was your fall an accident? Or did somebody push you?",
        "Ridge: Maybe we should do this later.",
        "Thomas: No.",
        "Det. Sanchez: Do you remember what happened? You fell over the cliff? You were standing on the deck... you were having a heated conversation with your wife. Mrs. Forrester was there, too. They were both very angry with you.",
        "Thomas: I remember. I was there. Near the edge.",
        "Det. Sanchez: How did you go over the cliff?",
        "Thomas: I fell.",
        "Det. Sanchez: Well, your family's saying it was an accident, but I need to know the truth. Did somebody put hands on you? Did somebody deliberately push you?",
        "Thomas: No. Nobody pushed me.",
        "Det. Sanchez: You sure?",
        "Thomas: It was an accident. There's a bunch of whole almonds in every bar",
        "Wyatt: As far as I'm concerned, thomas got exactly what he deserved, all right? I -- I don't -- I don't hope -- I don't want him to die. That would be awful. I mean, I hope he makes a miraculous recovery. But, I mean, he got himself into this mess. He's the one who did all this stuff.",
        "Sally: No, I mean, you're right. You know, in the end, people have to pay the price for their actions.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: I -- I don't know, it's just, he has a little boy. You know? And douglas has already lost his mom.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I'm thinking about that kid all the time.",
        "Sally: Well, if thomas wasn't in the hospital, he definitely would be in jail.",
        "Wyatt: Where he belongs. Like flo. She's -- she's sitting in a jail cell for what she did.",
        "Sally: How do you feel about that?",
        "Wyatt: I think that she should pay for her actions, you know, and her part in this. I mean, look, there's just so many -- there's so many lies, and -- and one deception after another... I -- [ Sighs ]",
        "Sally: Yeah. I know how much you hate that stuff.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, doesn't everybody?",
        "Sally: [ Sighs ] Pretty much.",
        "Wyatt: That's why I -- I mean, I hope that I can move past all this.",
        "Sally: Yeah, I like the sound of that.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, I'm hoping that I could -- I could do it with you.",
        "Sally: You sound pretty confident.",
        "Wyatt: Why, should I not be?",
        "Sally: We'll see.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Det. Sanchez: So you're saying it was an accident. You're positive?",
        "Thomas: Yes. An accident.",
        "Det. Sanchez: All right, then. If you remember anything different, you can call me. That goes for all of you. Stories have a funny way of changing.",
        "Ridge: Thank you, detective.",
        "Det. Sanchez: Oh, and, thomas, your name came up in another matter. Make sure you stick around town. I'm gonna need to talk to you about some information I got from xander avant and flo fulton.",
        "Ridge: How you feeling, son? You know, I think he's been through enough already. I think it's best if he have some time alone to recover.",
        "Thomas: Wait, wait. I need to say something. Especially to hope. Okay. I'll give you a few minutes.",
        "Thomas: I have no one to blame but myself. Brooke was trying to protect her daughter, thought I was hurting her. I don't -- I don't know why I did what I did. I... there's no excuse. I was wrong. Ashamed. Dad... I let you down. I was being selfish. Building a family... hope, I -- I took you away from yours. Precious time with your baby... I could have taken your pain, but... I didn'T. I -- [ Groans ] Well, I did this to myself. Put myself here. I'll never do anything like that again. I promise you. You have my word. I don't blame you if you never forgive me. I hope you do. Be right there baby. Whoops. Sorry.",
        "Ridge: We should probably let you get some rest.",
        "Thomas: Can I, uh, talk to hope alone?",
        "Brooke: I don't think that's a very good idea.",
        "Hope: There's really nothing you can say.",
        "Thomas: Please.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm not gonna leave you alone with him.",
        "Thomas: That's okay. You should stay. You should hear this. I'M... horrified by what I've done. But I did it out of love for you. The love I felt for you was real. The vows I said, I meant them, hope. Douglas... [ Sighs ] Poor douglas. He really -- he really wanted you to be his mother. I wanted you to be his mother. And what I did... the detective, not telling him the truth, that your mother pushed me... god, I hope that shows -- that shows you I'm putting your happiness, your well-being first, finally. You can't get back the time i took away, the time you should have had with beth... but I'm just asking... maybe one day you'll forgive me. And, hope, I -- I'm sorry. All right, folks. That's enough for now. Thomas really needs his rest.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that's -- that's probably a good time.",
        "Thomas: Hope. I meant what I said. I -- I do love you.",
        "Wyatt: I know we can't erase what happened, good or bad, but maybe we can, uh, press the reset button.",
        "Sally: Well, you know how much I like to push buttons, so...",
        "Wyatt: Oh! I know. I remember what I'm signing up for, okay? Making fun of the way that i chew, complaining about my driving... [ Laughing ] Oh!",
        "Sally: Okay, look, if we are starting fresh...",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: ...And getting everything out in the open, I... I actually have a confession to make.",
        "Wyatt: Uh-oh.",
        "Sally: I actually think you chew adorably.",
        "Wyatt: Aww! Really?",
        "Sally: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Huh! Even my cereal?",
        "Sally: It's the cutest crunching sounds I ever heard.",
        "Wyatt: Mm. Crunch, crunch, crunch. And all this time, I thought you just wanted to strangle me during breakfast. But, in actuality, I was turning you on.",
        "Sally: Uh -- mm, I don't know if I'd go that far.",
        "Wyatt: No, yeah, that's what it is.",
        "Sally: Mm. Okay.",
        "Wyatt: We should test that, too.",
        "Sally: Really? How?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Sally: Are you just gonna chew something?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. At dinner.",
        "Sally: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, I want to take you on a date, you know, a real date.",
        "Sally: Like we met on a dating app and you're trying really hard to impress me?",
        "Wyatt: Exactly.",
        "Sally: I like it.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Sally: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Seriously. I just -- I want to treat you the way that you deserve to be treated. I mean, there's been so much, like, lost time and so many missed opportunities, and i don't want to do that anymore. I want -- I want to start right here, right now, this moment.",
        "Sally: What are you getting at?",
        "Wyatt: This. I have to say, I'm rather shocked. I mean, of course there's gonna be bruising and swelling, but considering the tremendous fall your son took, he does seem to be in pretty remarkable condition.",
        "Ridge: He's a tough kid. Do you think he'll make a full recovery? There's no paralysis, no internal bleeding. Of course, I'd like to keep him here for a while longer, for observation, run another ct scan, but apart from that, i don't foresee any, any setbacks.",
        "Brooke: That's wonderful news. Thank you, doctor.",
        "Ridge: Thank you. Sure.",
        "Brooke: Wow. Well, that's a relief.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Thomas got very lucky.",
        "Brooke: Yes, he did.",
        "Ridge: And he's not the only one that got lucky today. You got to be relieved that thomas didn't tell sanchez the truth. As someone in witness protection,",
        "Liam: I can't believe what happened today.",
        "Hope: Yeah, well, luckily thomas is gonna be making a full recovery.",
        "Liam: Yeah, which is amazing because that was a long fall.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I'm just glad that he didn't blame my mom for it.",
        "Liam: Well, that's the -- see, I didn't know which way he was gonna go on that. I mean, he could have easily, easily blamed brooke, but once he started saying it was an accident...",
        "Hope: Well, we both obviously know why he did that.",
        "Liam: Yeah, obviously. He's trying to score points, he's trying to gain sympathy.",
        "Hope: Well, nothing could ever make up for what he did. He stole so much from us, liam. All of our firsts -- her first bottle, her first bath, her first smile. Those are memories that we will never be able to share together.",
        "Liam: I know, but, hope, we have so many more firsts ahead of us, and, you know something, we're gonna appreciate them even more because of what we've been through. Aren't we?",
        "Hope: Yeah, but thomas' apology, it's not enough. Not even close. Liam, it makes me mad how...",
        "Liam: It makes me mad, too. Trust me.",
        "Hope: [ Sighs ] We've cried enough. We've been mad enough, and I'm -- I'm done with that.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: I just want to focus on this precious little girl and the awesome, exciting, wonderful future that she is going to have with her mommy and daddy.",
        "[ Chuckles ]",
        "Brooke: Ridge...",
        "Ridge: I saw you. I saw you push him, and it doesn't matter if it was on purpose or not. You shoved him off the cliff, and he could have died, and it's a miracle he's still with us.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure that it was very frightening for you.",
        "Ridge: [ Scoffs ]",
        "Brooke: I was terrified, also. But you have to understand what I saw. I saw your son with his hands on my daughter, and I just reacted.",
        "Ridge: So you were protecting your daughter, and I saw you shoving him. We're not gonna see it the same way, are we?",
        "Brooke: Well, you have to remember why we rushed over to steffy's in the first place. You and I were both concerned about --",
        "Ridge: I was not concerned about anything. I said I would handle it. That's what I said.",
        "Brooke: Well, my daughter was over there, and she was alone, and I couldn't get through to her. And images of what thomas could do just kept flashing through my mind, so I was worried about my daughter, and I hate feeling that way about thomas.",
        "Ridge: You know what I'm concerned about right now? What I'm focused on is what happened in there. He gave you a break.",
        "Brooke: He gave me a break?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: [ Scoffs ]",
        "Ridge: You could have told what really happened out there, but you didn'T. Instead of bad-mouthing him out here, why don't you go in there and thank him?",
        "Brooke: You want me to thank him? What thomas did to my daughter and to my grandchild... ridge, after that, you want me to grovel at his feet to show my gratitude? No! It was an accident!",
        "Ridge: Shh.",
        "Brooke: And I don't believe for one second that his apology was real.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Brooke: I think that he's still trying to manipulate hope.",
        "Ridge: I don't believe you. He's in that hospital bed because of you.",
        "Brooke: He's in a hospital bed because of a sick, twisted obsession with my daughter. And I'll tell you something, this isn't gonna just end. Thomas is not gonna just walk away from this. He's gonna have to pay, ridge. Thomas has to pay. What he's done... he's gonna have to pay for what he's done to hope!"
