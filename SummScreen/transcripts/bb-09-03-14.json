        "At work, Liam sighs deeply but all he can concentrate on is his wedding to Hope in Italy. Ivy questions Ivy about what she wants to hear. Her and Liam at Bikini .and she got him out on the dance floor. That doesn't happen that often. Ivy says yeah he is too serious with Hope. She wants to loosen him up and have some fun. Aly says finally Ivy is admitting it. She likes Ivy with Liam. Ivy admits he has moved on since Hope is married to Wyatt. Hope walks up and hears this. She needs to show some shoots to Ivy so she sits down. Ivy realizes she heard what she and Aly said and tells Hope they probably need to talk about the elephant in the room. Hope asks if Ivy is officially dating Liam now. Ivy says not officially but if he asked she would not say no. Hope makes it clear that she thinks Ivy should say no. Hope says she can see where Ivy would be interested in Liam as he is handsome, smart and attractive, but he is just recently single and he is still processing that so she thinks Ivy's timing is off and she should stay away from him. Ridge helps Caroline by guiding her hand while he draws the designs. He says he could not do it without her. She says the same. He tells her to remember that the woman wears the dress not the other way around. Rick keeps hounding Katie that he is behind schedule and has not seen a single hint of a design from Ridge. He needs to know if there is some reason he is stonewalling. Ridge chose to come back to work so Rick has to see those designs today.",
        "Aly takes some jewels to Liam and proclaims that Ivy will be famous someday. He likes the sound of that. She realizes he is still getting used to being single but in the meantime she likes that he is seeing Ivy. Liam admits that being with Ivy is easy and she is fun but he is not rushing into anything with her. Aly says Ivy is family and they'd like to keep Liam around. Ivy tells Hope that she does not have to protect Liam from her. Hope says he does need a friend but he should not be rushing into another relationship. Ivy says it nicely but that it is really not any of Hope's business since she has her own husband. What will he say when he knows she is worried about Liam's love life? It ends below the belt when Ivy tells Hope that she is a Forrester. It is her name, it is her family business, her legacy and Hope is a Logan. This was after Hope reminded her that she was the boss. Hope gets somewhat catty when she asks if anyone saw Ivy being pushed into the Seine. Ivy takes offense that Hope might be insinuating that she fell in on her own. Then Ivy even adds that blood tells . Hope is so much like her mother, involved with two brothers at the same time. Hope tells her that Ivy should show more respect. She was brought here to help with her line, her name. Ivy counters with yes absolutely, as much as she deserves. Ridge shows Katie the sketch he made with Caroline and infers that it just came to him. She's ecstatic but when she asks him to repeat it, he can't. Rick loves it though and thinks it is a knockout. Caroline gives most of the credit to Ridge and explains how Ridge guided her hand. Ridge explains to Katie that his hand was on Caroline's and he guided her hand but it was his ideas. He can finish the collection that way."

        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: I... I'm speechless.",
        "Ridge: So am I.",
        "Caroline: That was incredible. The way that you guided my hand...",
        "Ridge: The way you followed my lead...",
        "Caroline: The way that you feel the lines...",
        "Ridge: That just comes with time.",
        "Caroline: No one could do it better than you.",
        "Ridge: Well, I couldn't have done that without you.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] That's hardly true.",
        "Ridge: Yes, it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Something going on with Ridge that I need to know about?",
        "Katie: Like what?",
        "Rick: I don't know. I'm asking you. I'm president of this company. It's my job to make sure all the lines get manufactured in time, and so far, I don't have any designs. I haven't heard of a concept, any ideas... if there is a reason that Ridge is not gonna be able to step up to this collection, I need to know about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Ahh. Okay. Liam is meeting with the photographer, and they said they wanted all these pieces on hand. I would give them over to him myself, but I --",
        "Aly: I'm happy to do it.",
        "Ivy: Thanks.",
        "Aly: So, speaking of Liam...",
        "Ivy: Yes?",
        "Aly: He came to Bikini.",
        "Ivy: He did. It was a really fun party, wasn't it?",
        "Aly: Are you seriously gonna pretend like you don't know that I'm dying to hear everything?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Well, Liam and I had a great time.",
        "Aly: Yeah, it looked that way. You even got him on the dance floor. That doesn't happen too often.",
        "Ivy: I know. Hope makes him too serious. I want to help him move on from her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Breathes deeply]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Please tell me you're not still blaming yourself.",
        "Ivy: If I hadn't toppled into the Seine, I --",
        "Aly: Yeah, and if Hope had just waited a little longer and if she hadn't married Wyatt, but... that's what happened. Maybe things were just supposed to work out this way. But...now there's you, Liam's new lease on life.",
        "Ivy: Okay. Let's not get too overexcited.",
        "Aly: Oh, come on. You could be. I mean, obviously, he likes you.",
        "Ivy: We, uh -- we've gotten closer.",
        "Aly: Yeah. I'd say a kiss qualifies. [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: There was another.",
        "Aly: At the party? I knew it! When I saw you two holding hands -- oh, so scandalous.",
        "Ivy: He's just -- he's such a terrific guy. I just -- I want to spend more time with him.",
        "Aly: Well, I've got a feeling you'll be doing lots more of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Listen, you just need to back off just a little bit. Ridge is a perfectionist. If you pressure him, you're just gonna make him crazy. You'll get what you need.",
        "Rick: What I need is designs, and all he's giving me is attitude.",
        "Katie: Just be patient. He won't disappoint.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Enough design tips. Back to work. That's pretty lame, huh?",
        "Ridge: Hey, you got to stop doing that. There's potential here.",
        "Caroline: Tell me. Show me how to make it better.",
        "Ridge: [Breathes deeply] The thing about couture --",
        "Caroline: Less is more.",
        "Ridge: Yes, but there's, um... there's a simplicity. Clean lines. The woman wears the dress, not the other way around. You got to remember that. See where this falls down here?",
        "Caroline: Right. It's -- it's too revealing.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, maybe it is, but... we put a sleeve...right here.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. It's still sexy, but it's classic.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. There. Now you're getting it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: You and Liam looked great together at Bikini.",
        "Ivy: Do you think?",
        "Aly: Yeah, like a couple in progress.",
        "Ivy: Ah. Well, we'll see.",
        "Aly: That's what you want, though, right?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Aly: Finally! She admits it, ladies and gentlemen.",
        "Ivy: Well, it's not like there's any reason to be coy about it. It's not like I'm snaking Liam from Hope. She let him go.",
        "Aly: I wonder if she regrets it.",
        "Ivy: I don't really think that matters now. She's married to Wyatt.",
        "Hope: Yes, I am.",
        "Aly: Hope, hi!",
        "Hope: Hi! Uh, sorry to interrupt. I just heard that you had some proofs for me from Maya's last photo shoot.",
        "Aly: Oh, yeah.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Aly: Here you go.",
        "Hope: Thank you. Uh, well, sorry. You guys go ahead and continue with your conversation.",
        "Aly: Oh, no, no. I was just, um -- I was just on my way out.",
        "Hope: Oh, not on my account.",
        "Aly: No, I...just need to get this jewelry to Liam for the Eye on Fashion piece.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, can you tell him I'm more than happy to answer any questions that he might have about the pieces?",
        "Aly: Yeah, will do.",
        "Hope: Well...",
        "Ivy: Yeah, the photos turned out great, don't you think?",
        "Hope: Yeah, Maya's much more engaged.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. B-beautiful smile.",
        "Hope: Yep.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Should we just say hi to the elephant in the room?",
        "Hope: Sorry?",
        "Ivy: You heard what I said about Liam.",
        "Hope: Pretty much every word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I don't know. Every instinct in me is screaming that something's off. I just don't get it. Ridge has never been this secretive about designs.",
        "Katie: Rick, give him a break, okay? He's been through a lot.",
        "Rick: [Sighs] I know. I can't even imagine how traumatic it must have been being tossed from a chopper in the middle of the sea, lost and compromised. But Ridge chose to come back to work. He has to produce. And whatever designs he has, I have to see those today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: I can't believe it. I mean, I'm -- I'm...looking at it. This dress is jaw-dropping.",
        "Ridge: It's fantastic.",
        "Caroline: It's so far beyond my ability.",
        "Ridge: Apparently not.",
        "Caroline: You -- you've just taught me so much in like 15 minutes. It's all just crashing around in my brain.",
        "Ridge: Well, I could help you sort it out. 'Cause I -- maybe we -- we should just keep doing that.",
        "Caroline: Do you mean that? You would mentor me? Because I would be so honored.",
        "Ridge: Why don't you take this and bring it to Rick? Tell him its part of the collection.",
        "Caroline: Are you serious?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: I -- I don't even know what to say except... thank you.",
        "Ridge: No, thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Nice stuff.",
        "Aly: Ivy's really talented. She is gonna be famous one day.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, I'd sure like to see that happen.",
        "Aly: You will. Especially now that you're free to look.",
        "Liam: Oh, 'cause I'm... right. 'Cause I'm not with Hope anymore.",
        "Aly: She married your brother. That kind of makes you available now.",
        "Liam: I'm sorry. Is that an arrow in your pocket, Miss Cupid?",
        "Aly: Well, would you like it to be?",
        "Liam: I don't -- I don't know. I don't know. It's a little early for another relationship.",
        "Aly: I get it. You're still adjusting to being single. And you'll get used to it eventually. But, in the meantime, I just don't see the harm in spending some time with Ivy.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You and Liam are... dating?",
        "Ivy: I mean, it's nothing official. Although if Liam did ask me, I wouldn't say no.",
        "Hope: Wow. I don't know. I think -- I think if Liam asked you, maybe you should say no.",
        "Ivy: Excuse me?",
        "Hope: Yeah, you know, it's -- I mean, I know better than anybody, obviously, how wonderful Liam is. He is handsome and smart and successful. You know, what woman wouldn't find him attractive?",
        "Ivy: No arguments here.",
        "Hope: [Chuckling] Yeah. I just think that your timing is off. You know, that's all. Liam and I, we had such an -- oh! -- intense and, um... complicated relationship, and it ended so abruptly. I think that he is still processing that. I just -- I think that it would be better if you left Liam alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I mean, Ivy's a lot of fun. I like being with her. It's, um -- it's...easy. But I -- but I'm not rushing into anything. Okay?",
        "Aly: Fair enough. But get to know Ivy. I mean, she is so awesome. Plus, she's a Forrester.",
        "Liam: What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Aly: Ivy's family. We'd get to keep you around.",
        "Liam: Oh, come here! Bring it in for the real thing. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Hope, don't you think you're a little out of line?",
        "Hope: No. Why would I?",
        "Ivy: You're not Liam's fianc\u00e9e anymore.",
        "Hope: Well, no, but we still care about each other.",
        "Ivy: You're married to Wyatt now.",
        "Hope: Yeah. But that doesn't mean that Liam and I aren't gonna look out for each other.",
        "Ivy: You don't have to protect Liam from me.",
        "Hope: No, I -- hey, maybe I'm protecting you. It's just, Liam isn't ready.",
        "Ivy: Hope, you can't have them both.",
        "Hope: No, that's -- that's not -- okay. Wow. No. Okay. How do I make you understand this? Um... Liam has been through a lot lately. He's had to deal with some things.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, like your relationship with his brother.",
        "Hope: Liam has to accept that Wyatt and I are married, and I think that that hit him hard.",
        "Ivy: Well, I know that it did, because I was there.",
        "Hope: And I'm glad. I'm so glad that he had a friend. He needed a friend. What he doesn't need, though, is to be rushed into a new relationship.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Don't you think that's Liam's decision to make?",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. Have I upset you in some way?",
        "Ivy: I'm just -- I'm shocked. That's all. I'm a little shocked that you still think whoever Liam decides to see is any of your business.",
        "Hope: Well, it's just that Liam's general well-being is always gonna be my business.",
        "Ivy: Oh, really? So, how does your husband feel about that?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: You know, Hope, if you really care about Liam, you should be supportive. You've moved on. Why can't he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: How did this happen?",
        "Ridge: Well, Caroline did some sketches for couture, and she just wanted to see if she could. She wanted me to look at them, so...I did... and I thought they were pretty good. You know, rough. And I told her where I thought she went wrong. And she wanted me to show her.",
        "Katie: Did you panic?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I did. But I-I had nothing to lose, and... I don't know. I...I put my hand on hers, and...started guiding it, and... and it happened.",
        "Katie: And you can draw.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Katie: That's incredible.",
        "Ridge: You told me to be patient, and that's the easiest thing for me, but... I-I don't... it happened. I-I had these ideas in my head, and now I can put them on paper, and that's the breakthrough I wanted.",
        "Katie: So, I guess I was right. [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: You're always right.",
        "Katie: Can you show me?",
        "Ridge: Sure.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Sure.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Ridge: Uh... I -- I can't.",
        "Katie: Well... you don't have to pressure yourself, you know? Just, uh... just try again.",
        "Ridge: I can't.",
        "Katie: But -- but you were able to do it with Caroline.",
        "Ridge: I know. I know I was... with Caroline.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: [Laughs] This is a knockout!",
        "Caroline: Right? Ridge told me to tell you that that is for the collection.",
        "Rick: You did this? Oh, Baby, I'm so proud of you!",
        "Caroline: Well, okay. Most of the credit goes to Ridge. I mean, I just -- I showed him a rough sketch, you know, to get input from the master. He actually liked them. And then he guided my hand to make the corrections, and it was -- oh, my God. I-I don't even have words for it. Just -- to feel his talent and his brilliance just coursing through me...",
        "Rick: It's good to know that Ridge still has it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: It was there, Katie. My hand on hers, and it was effortless.",
        "Katie: Well, that just proves that you didn't lose your gift over the Persian Gulf somewhere. It's in there. We just have to figure out a way to get it out.",
        "Ridge: I was guiding her hand, and whatever was in my head was out on paper. That's it.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Ridge: I know how to finish my collection. I will finish it through Caroline.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I do support Liam getting on with his life.",
        "Ivy: Well, okay. Sorry. I must have misunderstood.",
        "Hope: You know, you haven't know Liam very long, so I think what you really need to know about him is that he feels things very deeply. And right now, he's hurting.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I, um... I know that. Which is why I'm trying to help him.",
        "Hope: Great. Well, I think the best way for you to do that would be to leave him alone, because when you try and help, things get a little...",
        "Ivy: Oh. No, continue, please. Actually, I want to hear what you're thinking.",
        "Hope: Oh, I was just gonna say that things would be a lot different if you hadn't fallen into the Seine, but, you know... uh, did anyone see that happen, by the way?",
        "Ivy: No, not to my knowledge.",
        "Hope: There were people around.",
        "Ivy: Yes. I -- are you implying that I deliberately fell into the river?",
        "Hope: Did you?",
        "Ivy: No, Hope. I was in Paris supporting Liam, just like I was before I even left the states. I didn't want him to give up on you. So the last thing I deserve is some kind of crazy insinuations that I deliberately fell into the river to make him late.",
        "Hope: That's -- that is not what I said.",
        "Ivy: Well, that's what you're implying. Look, it's not my actions here who are questionable. I mean, why couldn't you wait a little while before rushing off to marry Wyatt?",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Well, I mean, blood tells, right?",
        "Hope: What does that mean?",
        "Ivy: Well, we all emulate our mothers. Subconsciously or not. I mean, your mum was involved with two brothers, as well, so...",
        "Hope: Oh-ho, Ivy, my mother and I could not be more different.",
        "Ivy: Hmm. Kind of looks the same from here.",
        "Hope: Wow! The way you are speaking to me right now is so wildly inappropriate. I am your boss.",
        "Ivy: I was brought here by my uncle Eric because I'm talented and because I'm a Forrester. This is my name. It's my family's business, my legacy. You're a Logan.",
        "Hope: Don't get it twisted, Ivy. You were brought on to be a part of Hope for the Future, my line. My name. Show me some respect.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, absolutely. As much as you deserve."
