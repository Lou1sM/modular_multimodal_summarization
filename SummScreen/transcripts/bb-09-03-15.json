    "Recap": [
        "Ridge lets a very subdued Caroline into the loft and asks what is wrong. At work, Thomas relives making love or at least telling Caroline they did and her reaction. She was disgusted. Wyatt remembers Steffy telling him that he has to let Ivy do the right thing and help Steffy. Ivy gloats to Wyatt about her being the face of Forrester. She says it is what Aly would have wanted. He asks about any other copies of the video and she says yes that is her insurance. She could not take a chance on just one copy. Steffy tells Liam but he says that is not how this is going to go down. He does not think they will go to the police even though it looks like Wyatt and Ivy are still on the fence. She only hopes he comes to his senses. Liam tells Wyatt and Ivy that they can start without Ridge, but he wants to get started with Ivy being the face of Forrester. And he laments that the yacht is available and Monte Carlo would be a good place to start. Ivy wonders if they are trying to get her out of the country for some reason. Liam says no, this is business. Ivy says her gut is saying something else. She should have taken that video to the police a long time ago. Steffy is not innocent. Aly's life was taken by Steffy.",
        "Alone Steffy tells Wyatt again to get rid of the video and all of this will be over. Ridge tells Caroline that he wants what is best for her and he still wants a life with her if she wants the same thing. He knows after what happened last night it is probably the last thing she is expecting to hear. They are a team and they will have challenges but they will do it together. He says he wants her back. Brooke asks Thomas if he has seen Caroline today. He admits not. She says she and Ridge broke up. But Caroline is strong and she will bounce back. Thomas thinks Brooke knows more than she is saying and Ridge has confided something in her. Caroline tells Ridge to stop saying that. She can not hear him say that again. Why is he bringing this up again? He says he can not have her miss out on having their child, seeing and holding it for the first time. Liam follows Ivy as she re-watches the video and he slips up behind her and tells her to delete it. It does not show the entire thing and he knows she is blind to Steffy. He knows Ivy is a good person and this is not her. She needs to heal too and let this vendetta against Steffy go. Wyatt tells Steffy there are more copies and he is considering what she said. She wants to make a deal. Ivy must be dealt with, once and for all. Ridge says he knows Caroline will be an amazing mother and he has to be there for that. He can not lose her. Maybe not this year, but sometimes they will have this baby. She looks conflicted and confused. He hugs her."

        "Thomas: Seriously, Caroline, you don't remember anything? Okay. We talked. I told you how I felt, and -- and -- and I asked if I could show you. All right? You reached out to me, Caroline. We made love.",
        "Caroline: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!",

        "Pam: Chop, chop, mister.",
        "Thomas: What?",
        "Pam: The meeting in Ridge's office. It's about to start.",
        "Thomas: Are dad and Caroline in there?",
        "Pam: Oh, um, I don't know. I haven't been at my desk. Do you want me to check?",
        "Thomas: No, no, that's fine. I'm -- I'm passing on the meeting, anyways.",
        "Pam: Are you okay?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah. Just -- just tell them... you know what? No, it's fine. I'll handle it.",
        "Pam: Okay.",

        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "[Wyatt's flashback]",
        "Steffy: You're allowing Ivy to blackmail me. How can you support this? You have to do the right thing -- for all of us. Put this behind us. Help me. Help me get rid of that video.",
        "[Present time]",
        "Ivy: Hey!",
        "Wyatt: Hi!",
        "Ivy: So, have you seen this press release?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Yes.",
        "Ivy: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: You hit the big time, beautiful.",
        "Ivy: Well, who would have thought? Little, old me, the face of Forrester?",
        "Wyatt: Hey, it's what you wanted, right?",
        "Ivy: Well, it's what Aly wanted.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Ivy: Gosh, Steffy must be chewing her nails seeing this.",
        "Wyatt: Well, Ridge did choose her first until you convinced her to step aside.",
        "Ivy: No, no, I didn't convince her, Wyatt. The video convinced her.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Hey, um, speaking of which...",
        "Ivy: Hmm?",
        "Wyatt: Do you still have other copies of it?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, what do you think? I mean, come on. This is my secret weapon against Steffy. I'm not gonna take any chances.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I didn't ask Wyatt. I told him I wanted every copy of that video deleted.",
        "Liam: And what'd he say?",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] Uh, before or after I told him what Ivy said about owning me?",
        "Liam: Okay, well, what did he say to that? Because if anything proves she's crossing a line...",
        "Steffy: And he knows that. He knows that. But he still sides with her. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Probably because you and I got back together. I mean, that's hurtful to both of them.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, that's exactly what I said to him. He didn't deny it.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but he didn't agree to do what you asked, either.",
        "Steffy: The point is, this insanity just needs to end. Ivy thinks that video is all about justice for Aly. She's using it and she's holding it over my head. And for all I know, Lieutenant Baker could walk in right now for the warrant for my arrest.",
        "Liam: No, that -- that is not how this is gonna go down.",
        "Steffy: Look, I know... I know you tried to get through to Ivy. And I tried, too. [Sighs] And I know Wyatt has done some questionable things. But I honestly do not believe he wants Ivy using that video against me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, unfortunately, he's still on the fence.",
        "Steffy: Well... he's had a night to think about it. Hopefully Wyatt comes to his senses.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Ah. Are we interrupting?",
        "Wyatt: What? What's going on?",
        "Liam: Like you don't know.",
        "Steffy: Actually, I-I just got a text from my dad. He said start the meeting without Caroline and him.",
        "Liam: Oh, really?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, what about Thomas?",
        "Liam: Well, I-I can fill him in later if he doesn't show.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so what's this big confab about, anyway?",
        "Liam: Okay, okay, uh, well, we here are all aware of the big changes that have been taking place at this company, and now so is the public. So, Ivy is the new face of Forrester, and I think it's time to start planning her first photo shoot.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Got something in mind?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Actually, I talked to dad, and the yacht in Monte Carlo is available.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah!",
        "Ivy: Wow. Monte Carlo. That's great. I mean, I love that. Wait.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Ivy: Just -- it just -- this seems to be moving really fast. Is there another reason you want to get me out of the country?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'm a pretty decent mind reader.",
        "Thomas: [Clears throat]",
        "Brooke: Caroline, right?",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: I know you're concerned about her.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Did you talk to her today?",
        "Thomas: No.",
        "Brooke: Your father?",
        "Thomas: Why?",
        "Brooke: Well, remember when I said he was going home to talk to Caroline to tell her that he was going to agree to have a family with her? Well, I was wrong. Ridge broke it off with Caroline. They're not together anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I know it's the last thing you expected to hear after what happened last night. [Sighs] I-I just... I want...what's best for you. And... hey. I still love you, and I want to have a life with you. And I hope you still want the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You would think that.",
        "Ivy: Well, is that what you're doing? You're sending me on this shoot to get me out of the country?",
        "Liam: Absolutely not, Ivy. This is just business.",
        "Ivy: Okay, so then why does my gut tell me there's something more to it?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. Maybe you're just being paranoid.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, Steffy. Come on!",
        "Steffy: No, you come on, Wyatt. You know what Ivy's doing is wrong.",
        "Ivy: No, Steffy. What I'm doing is keeping you out of prison! I should have taken that video to the police a very long time ago, but I didn't. And instead of you guys being grateful, you keep throwing demands around! I mean, where do you get off?",
        "Steffy: Where do you get off accusing me of something that you know I would never do?! Aly was family. I said this a thousand times how sorry I am! We are all sorry! But it was self-defense!",
        "Ivy: So then why are you so concerned with this video getting out, Steffy? You want to know why? Because you aren't innocent. Aly's life was taken by you, Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Despite Caroline choosing Ridge over being a mother, ultimately Ridge couldn't have her make that kind of sacrifice knowing what family and children mean to her.",
        "Thomas: So he sacrificed their relationship instead.",
        "Brooke: Yes. But Ridge being Ridge, he was concerned, so he called her to make sure she was okay, and she -- she was upset. She was crying. But you know what? Caroline is tough. She's a fighter. She's going to get through this. And she'll find a man who can give her what Ridge can't. She has family and she has friends. She has you. You and Caroline have always had this amazing connection. If one person could really help her get through this, it would be you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I don't understand.",
        "Ridge: What changed between yesterday and today? I'm... I was trying to do what's -- what's best for you, you know? And then I realized... I heard your voice, and I heard how upset you were, and I just wanted to crawl through that phone and grab you and hold you and tell you that everything's...everything's gonna be okay because that's what people that love each other, that's what they do. And...we're a team, you know? And whatever the challenge is, we face that together and we get through it together. It's what we're all about. It's what we're all about. I'm hoping that we still are. So I want you back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: How many times do I have to deny it?",
        "Ivy: Well, why don't you try admitting to it? I mean, come on. What -- what's that saying? Is it, \"confession is good for the soul\"?",
        "Steffy: I have nothing to confess to. I never wanted any of this.",
        "Ivy: Oh, and you think I did? Steffy, I wish to God that Aly was still with us. I wish there wasn't a confrontation. I wish there wasn't a stupid video. And you know what? I really wish you would understand why I'm doing this. It's to defend Aly's name. But instead you two are too busy wasting time trying to figure out ways to get me out of the country.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy. I'll go talk to her.",
        "Liam: No, let me -- let me do it. I'm the one she's really upset with.",
        "Steffy: Don't say it.",
        "Wyatt: It can't go on like this.",
        "Steffy: Well, then do something. Get rid of the video. Or did anything I say get through to you?",
        "Wyatt: Actually, it did. In more ways than you might think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: So, dad's phone call to Caroline last night...",
        "Brooke: Ridge said she was a mess. And ultimately, he takes full responsibility, even though...",
        "Thomas: Even though what? Is there something you're not telling the rest of us?",
        "Brooke: Like what?",
        "Thomas: There is. Dad told you something in confidence.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Why would you assume that?",
        "Thomas: Because you're answering my questions with questions. Fine. You're obviously dad's confidante now, so...",
        "Brooke: You know what? I think Caroline's the one who needs a confidante.",
        "Thomas: Don't look at me.",
        "Brooke: Why not? She's always trusted you completely. Unless something's changed between the two of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: This is how I see you, who you'll always be to me.",
        "Caroline: I'm not her anymore. I'm not the same.",
        "Ridge: Because of what I did. Because of what I did to you.",
        "Caroline: I just kept thinking it was me.",
        "Ridge: It's not you. You're the most loving, loyal woman I've --",
        "Caroline: No, stop. Just stop. Stop saying that stuff to me. I can't hear that from you. I can't... [Sighs] I don't know if I can hear that from you ever.",
        "Ridge: I didn't mean to hurt you. I never meant to do that. I know how -- how important it is for you to be a mom.",
        "Caroline: Right, and you can't give that to me, right? That's what you said.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, that's what I said.",
        "Caroline: So then why -- why are you -- why are you even bringing this up? I...",
        "Ridge: I didn't know how it was gonna be being a parent, you know? I saw my mom and dad struggling, all the stuff that we put them through, but they were always there for us, and... they always loved us unconditionally. And I don't think we even know what our hearts are capable of until we hold our child for the first time. I can't have you miss out on that.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs shakily]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: [Clears throat]",
        "Liam: Delete it. You know you want to.",
        "Ivy: No, Liam, what I want is for Steffy to admit responsibility.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, Aly attacked Steffy, not the other way around.",
        "Ivy: Well, for the last time, that's not what this video shows.",
        "Liam: That's because the video doesn't show everything.",
        "Ivy: Maybe, maybe not. But I'm pretty sure it does have enough in it to interest police if I decide to show them what I have.",
        "Liam: Okay, so can you just listen to me for a second? I know that you want justice for Aly. I know that.",
        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Liam: I also know that you happen to think I'm blind when it comes to Steffy, but I'm not, Ivy. Not any more than I am to what's really driving you right now. Can you look at me? You're a good person. But what you're doing is not. It's -- it's changing you, Ivy. It's consuming you. And you have to stop. Stop using this video to control Steffy's life. Stop putting yourself through what you're putting yourself through right now. You need to heal. You need to move on, 'cause this can backfire on you.",
        "Ivy: Oh \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: So, you're agreeing to delete the video and all the copies?",
        "Wyatt: Let's just say I'm considering it.",
        "Steffy: All right. Let's talk. A private conversation, just you and me.",
        "Wyatt: Sure.",
        "Steffy: Let's make a deal. Whether Ivy is grieving or she sees this as an opportunity to advance herself, that video needs to be deleted. Ivy must be dealt with once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Thomas' flashback]",
        "Caroline: What are you talking about?! I told you about Ridge, and you saw how emotional I was! How could you not tell, Thomas?! How could you not know?! You had to have known!",
        "Thomas: You kissed me back, Caroline!",
        "Caroline: I'm in love with your father!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Well, the saleswoman said it's, uh, top of the line, you know, and -- and, um... well, what kid doesn't like rabbits, so... [Sighs] I'm -- you're gonna be an amazing mom. And, uh, I-I got to be there to see that 'cause our baby's gonna be the most amazing baby in the world.",
        "Caroline: Our baby?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, and I know I said it couldn't be me, but it has to be me. I can't lose you.",
        "Caroline: I don't want to lose you, either.",
        "Ridge: So maybe not today or tomorrow, but sometime this year, we... we're -- we're gonna do this. We're gonna have a kid together.",
        "Caroline: [Gasps] We -- we will?",
        "Ridge: Yeah."
