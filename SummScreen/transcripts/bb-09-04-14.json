        "A tired, frazzled Hope comes home and is greeted by happy hubby with a kiss. She wraps her arms around his neck and says it feels so good to be home. He says he got them a pizza and a bag of salad for later. He quips that he is still getting used to this whole husband thing and microwaving for the two of them. And it's not just pizza but her favorite with a lethal amount of garlic so he better kiss her now with a preemptive strike. With Eric out of town, Ivy steps in as hostess and is having an Australian barbecue for a group or a barbie as they call it back home. Oliver says he is the grill master. Liam tells Bill that he is supposed to be there right now. Bill tells him to get out of here and go get some barbecue, he is looking sort of peaked and skinny right now. He says he knows Liam is dealing with a lot right now with losing Hope and he is disappointed in his brother so go hang out with his friends, have a few beers and have fun. Don't stop living. Liam says he knows Bill is right and he can't keep spending every night with Boo. Bill says that is sad, spending all his nights with a cat, very sad. Liam says and it was very kind of Ivy to invite him so he'll be on his way. However, before he gets out, Quinn knocks on Bill's door and comes in. He gives that perturbed look and asks why she is there. She tells them to calm down. She has no sword and she will not touch either of theirs unless they want her to. Liam starts to leave and says he gets physically ill when she is around. She quips that he ought to see a doctor as she thinks there is a pill for that. Bill adds or a vaccination. He asks Morticia what she wants. She says a lot of things .most of them probably not legal. When he doesn't laugh, she says Brooke must have taken away his sense of humor. Bill grouses that he is happy Hope is with Wyatt but he also wants his other son to be happy too. Quinn says maybe he can move on with this Ivy .Poison Ivy. Wyatt tells Hope that he doesn't want to talk shop all night but wonders if she has had a chance to see some of Ivy's designs. She's really not bad and gonna give his mother a run for her money in designing jewelry. Hope says hmmmm, Ivy may be more like his mother than he even realizes. Wyatt isn't sure what she means by that.",
        "Aly tells Caroline that Ivy really did good in putting this together tonight and she is excited. She is really beginning to fall for Liam. Caroline is not sure that is a good idea so soon. The place is all decorated and Ivy says they need a vacation and since they could not go to Australia, she would bring it here. They are having juicy lamb chops but Oliver asks Liam if he'd like a veggie burger. Ivy says if he really is adventurous she has some yabby for him and then he really should try some veg spread which is probably the most popular food they have in Australia. Oliver says it definitely is an acquired taste. Liam samples some and he says whoa, no he doesn't hate it, but it is weird and unique. Ivy says she wanted to give them a real authentic Australian experience and no one is going anywhere until she teaches them how to throw a boomerang correctly. Wyatt asks Hope what she meant by Ivy and his mother being alike or what they have in common. Hope laments that perhaps she is being overly sensitive but they sort of got into it today. Ivy wanted to make it clear that Hope is a Logan and Ivy is a Forrester. Wyatt says that really doesn't matter and now she is a Spencer. Hope says she knows but first she was getting it from Steffy and now Ivy. Hope admits it's not only business but she is a little uncomfortable with Ivy being here at all. She tells Wyatt that Ivy and Liam kissed. Wyatt laughs and says he did not know his brother had game. Hope says she thinks it was the other way around. Ivy kissed him twice. Wyatt laughs again and says good for his bro for moving on. He doesn't understand when Hope says she is not sure it is a good idea to move on so fast. Liam needs time to process things. Wyatt said it was just two kisses. It is not like she is moving in with him. Hope says she knows, but what kind of woman would pursue a man after a recent breakup. It just speaks for her character. Liam is venerable right now and sort of makes her look like an opportunist. Wyatt says he wishes the best for his brother and it doesn't matter who he dates or who he kisses as long as it is not her. He thinks it is natural for her to be concerned and feel badly for him, want to protect him. So does he but he'd really like not to talk about his brother in their home with his beautiful wife. She says okay and it might not be an issue soon as she sort of told Ivy to back off. Both Aly and Ivy notice Liam taking a lot of messages and sort of ignoring them. Rick asks Oliver to bring Liam another beer. Liam says he would be knee deep in tequila if he thought it would help. Caroline finally tells Liam that he is supposed to be having fun, so get off the phone. He says ever since Bill has been back as CEO, his e-mails have taken over. Caroline says he will get through this. It will just take a little time. Aly tells Ivy that Liam is having fun but .Ivy says she knows. He is still thinking about Hope. She tells Aly about her convo with Hope. Perhaps she is right and it is too soon. She really just wants him to have fun and let loose. Bill says Poison Ivy; does Quinn have a beef with her. Quinn says no, she's just weak .damsel in distress and has to have Liam dive in the Seine for her. Bill reminds her that if she hadn't then Liam would be married to Hope right now and not to Wyatt so she'd be planning her next takedown instead of her victory dance right now. He says talk about fate and then it hits him. He asks Quinn was she there, did she do this? She scoffs at first then admits it was some of her best work .she did what had to be done. He says if she doesn't know already she is completely insane. She says she could not live with herself if she hadn't taken care of this one last detail. He says Hope and Wyatt need to know this and since he knows she will not tell them he will. Quinn laughs ad says he will not say a thing and she will tell him why. Wyatt tells Hope that it is sweet of her to protect Liam but he probably wouldn't want her to. And he could see why it might irritate Ivy. He tells her she just needs to let this play out .let Liam figure it out for himself. And he really doesn't think it is weird for either of them to be attracted to each other. Hope says she really doesn't think Liam is attracted to Ivy. He just needs someone to lean on but he doesn't need someone to make moves on him so soon. Wyatt says Liam is a guy and guys never do not need that. He tries to convince her that Liam will be okay. And just look at it from Ivy's prospective. Liam is her hero; he jumped in The Seine to save her. The party breaks up and Aly and Oliver say goodbye. Oliver says they are going for ice creme and he's buying if they are interested. Liam says rain check. He tells Ivy that he thinks he will head out to. He thanks her for inviting him and says he had a good time whether he showed it or not. She smiles a big smile and tells him that she really likes him. She knows he is going through a bad time right now and she doesn't want to put any pressure on him or seem like she is chasing him. Maybe tonight was a really bad idea cause she would be lying if she didn't say she really had her hopes up. So maybe they should just say G'day or goodnight and let it go at that. She turns with a disappointed look on her face to clean up. Liam taps her on the shoulder and turns her around and leans in and kisses her. He says, \"night's not over yet.\""

        "Liam: Yeah, well, you know --",
        "Bill: I know. I know. You're dealing with a lot right now. You lost Hope, you're disappointed in your brother. Go hang out with your friends. That's what you need to do. Have a couple beers. Don't stop living, Liam.",

        "Bill: See any pigs flying outside that window?",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Oh! Well, then you're saying there's a chance. So, where is little Liam off to, hmm? It's a little early to be leaving the office.",
        "Bill: What do you want, Morticia?",
        "Quinn: So many things, Bill. And I'm sure most of them are not legal. [Laughs] Oh, come on! I'm kidding! What, did Brooke forbid you to have a sense of humor?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: Well, the neighbors dropped this of. Congratulations to the newlyweds.",
        "Hope: Oh, that was really sweet of them.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, maybe we could pop this baby open later.",
        "Hope: Mm, I would love that.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Um... I'd hate to talk shop, but, uh, did you ever get a chance to look at Ivy's latest ideas?",
        "Hope: Yes. I did.",
        "Wyatt: Not bad. She's definitely giving my mother a run for her money in the jewelry-designing department.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. Yep. And she might even be more like your mother than we realized.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Here you go. Now just brush this on every now and then. Yeah.",
        "Oliver: [Laughs]",
        "Aly: Ivy's excited about tonight. I think she's really starting to fall for Liam.",
        "Caroline: Is that a good idea? He hasn't even gotten over Hope yet. I'm not sure that he ever will.",
        "Aly: Well, she's not trying to push things. I think she just wants to see Liam smile again.",
        "[Door opens]",

        "Liam: Sure.",
        "Ivy: Thanks. I'm really happy you're here. Yeah, so, you seem like you needed a bit of a vacation, and seeing as you're too busy to go to Australia, I thought I would bring it to you. [Laughs]",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: What does Ivy have in common with my mother?",
        "Hope: I don't know. I'm probably just being overly sensitive.",
        "Wyatt: Where's this coming from? Did something happen?",
        "Hope: Yeah. [Sighs] Ivy and I kind of got into it today.",
        "Wyatt: About what?",
        "Hope: She just wanted to make it very clear that I am a Logan and she is a Forrester.",
        "Wyatt: That doesn't even matter! Also, technically, you are a Spencer now.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Yeah, I know, I know. But it's -- it's just that I've been getting this for so long. First I was getting it from Steffy, and now Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, Hope, look. Don't let this get to you, okay? You are confident in who you are. Your talent and your self-worth, not to mention all the contributions you've made to this Forrester company.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Thanks. But it's not just the business side of things. It's also, um, I'm a little... uncomfortable with her being here.",
        "Liam: Uh-oh. What else did she do?",
        "Hope: Well, she, um... [Chuckles] She kissed Liam. [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Well, that smells really good over there.",
        "Oliver: We're all having lamb chops.",
        "Rick: Mmm.",
        "Caroline: Tender, juicy lamb chops.",
        "Oliver: Are you sure you want a veggie burger?",
        "Ivy: Actually, I, uh, I got you something special from the markets. I got you some prawns 'cause they looked really good, but... if you're feeling adventurous, I also got you some yabbies.",
        "Rick: What's a yabby?",
        "Ivy: It's a freshwater crayfish. I boiled them earlier. They're really popular in Australia, and they're quite delicious.",
        "Liam: I -- I would love to try some yabby. Yabby?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yabby.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Ivy: Look, you don't have to. But I do suggest you all try some veg spread. It is probably the most popular food that we actually have in Australia.",
        "Liam: Oh, man, I've heard about this.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Aly: Ivy's already got me hooked. Every morning with a cup of tea.",
        "Oliver: It's definitely an acquired taste.",
        "Aly: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Liam: Really?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: Okay. Okay. Oh, whoa!",
        "Ivy: Yeah, you hate it.",
        "Liam: Whoa! No, I don't. I don't hate it. It's weird and it's unique.",
        "Caroline: Let me try.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Caroline: I want to try it.",
        "Liam: All right. There you go.",
        "Oliver: [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: That's really salty. I'm kind of digging it. Yeah?",
        "Oliver: You should take a selfie. [Australian accent] Your first time trying Australian veg spread.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Caroline: That's very funny. That's actually kind of a great idea, though.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, I just -- I wanted to give you all a really authentic Australian experience, so none of you are going anywhere until I attempt to teach you how to throw a boomerang correctly.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Caroline: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] Liam kissed Ivy. I didn't know my bro had any game.",
        "Hope: I think it was probably the other way around. I think Ivy kissed him -- twice.",
        "Wyatt: Twice?!",
        "Hope: Uh-huh.",
        "Wyatt: So it wasn't just a one-time thing.",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] The old bro is moving right along. Good for him.",
        "Hope: I don't really think it's the best idea.",
        "Wyatt: Why not?",
        "Hope: Because it's too soon. Liam has things that he needs to work through.",
        "Wyatt: They kissed a couple of times. So what? It's not like she's moving in.",
        "Hope: Well, no, but, I mean, what kind of woman pursues a man after he's just gone through a breakup like the one we had? It makes me question her character.",
        "Wyatt: What's the big deal with a few dates?",
        "Hope: Liam is so vulnerable right now. Don't you think that makes her seem a little opportunistic?",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I wish the best for my brother. I also couldn't care less who he dates or who he kisses as long as it's not you.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Look, it's only natural for you to be concerned for him. You feel bad. You want to protect him. So do I. But I -- I really -- I'd really rather not talk about my brother in our home with my beautiful wife. Mm? Okay?",
        "Hope: Okay. Okay. Okay. [Chuckles] But, you know what, I don't think it's gonna be an issue much longer, because I may have told Ivy to...back off.",
        "Wyatt: What -- what is happening right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Oh, I'm stuffed!",
        "Caroline: It was good.",
        "Ivy: Rick, I'll take those.",
        "Rick: Thank you. Hey.",
        "Caroline: I like the yetis. Get off your phone!",
        "Liam: Sorry. Ever since my dad's been back as C.E.O., I'm getting all these e-mails. Everybody's .",
        "Caroline: You're supposed to be having fun tonight.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Well, I'm --",
        "Rick: [Australian accent] Oliver, get Liam another beer!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Rick: Or would you prefer something stronger, mate?",
        "Liam: Honestly, Rick, I'd be knee-deep in tequila if I thought it would help.",
        "Caroline: You will get through this, Liam.",
        "Liam: Ah. Thank you. Thanks.",
        "Aly: Look, Liam's having a good time. He's just --",
        "Ivy: He's just thinking about Hope.",
        "Aly: It might take a bit.",
        "Ivy: Hope thinks I should leave him alone.",
        "Aly: What do you mean?",
        "Ivy: Her and I had a little chat earlier and she suggested I stay away.",
        "Aly: I don't understand. I mean, she's married to Wyatt now.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, she overheard us talking earlier.",
        "Aly: I knew she was listening. Did she hear the part about --",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. The whole thing. She heard that I kissed Liam, and she thinks he's not ready for a relationship right now because he's still processing.",
        "Aly: He likes you, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I don't know.",
        "Aly: No, he does. He's just --",
        "Ivy: Processing. I just -- I really wanted Liam to have fun tonight and let loose. Maybe Hope was right. Maybe it is too soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I'm happy Wyatt found a life with Hope. But I'm also Liam's father, and I want him happy, as well.",
        "Quinn: Well, I think Liam needs to move on. Maybe with that Forrester girl.",
        "Bill: Ivy?",
        "Quinn: Poison Ivy.",
        "Bill: Oh, you have a beef with her, too?",
        "Quinn: No, no, no beef. I just don't like her. She's weak. Damsel in distress, falling into the seine -- and of course Liam dives in after her. I could have predicted that a mile away. Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes and Miss Prim-and-Proper -- seems like a match made in heaven, hmm?",
        "Bill: You're mad at Ivy for falling off the bridge? If she hadn't, then Liam would be married to Hope right now, and you would be planning your next takedown instead of doing your little victory dance.",
        "Quinn: Maybe I just lucked out.",
        "Bill: Incredible. And what are the odds? Ivy falls off the bridge, Liam jumps in to rescue her, missing his rendezvous with Hope. Talk about fate doing its -- wait a minute.",
        "Quinn: Hmm?",
        "Bill: It was you? Did you knock her over?",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Me? [Scoffs] It was some of my best work.",
        "Bill: It was you? You pushed Ivy off that bridge?",
        "Quinn: I did what I had to do.",
        "Bill: Well -- what were you even doing in Paris?",
        "Quinn: Well, I jumped on the same flight as Ivy and Liam. In a disguise, of course.",
        "Bill: Well, if we didn't know it already, you are completely insane.",
        "Quinn: I did it for our son and for Hope. Liam is the wrong guy for her!",
        "Bill: It's not up to you, Quinn!",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't take care of this one last little detail, and look what happened, Bill! Success! Hope and Wyatt are married. They couldn't be happier.",
        "Bill: And you messed up Liam's life. Do you not get that I have three sons? Not just Wyatt to worry about.",
        "Quinn: I only have one son, and I do whatever is necessary to get the job done. Same as you would do.",
        "Bill: Hope and Liam need to know what you did, and since I know you aren't going to tell them, I will.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, you're not going to tell them anything, Bill. You want to know why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Was I out of line?",
        "Wyatt: Telling Ivy to step off your ex? I can see why she might take offense to that.",
        "Hope: I am just trying to protect him.",
        "Wyatt: It's sweet, but he probably doesn't want you to.",
        "Hope: Probably not.",
        "Wyatt: Nope.",
        "Hope: No, but there's just something about Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Hope, you got to let this one play out, okay? Let Liam figure things out on his own. Okay? And to be honest with you, I don't think it's that weird that they're drawn to each other.",
        "Hope: No, I don't think that Liam is attracted to her. I think that he was looking for a friend, for someone to lean on. I mean, he doesn't need someone making moves on him so soon.",
        "Wyatt: He's a guy. We don't ever not need that.",
        "Hope: All right. Fine. Okay. Maybe some day, yes, down the line, it's fine, okay. But he needs some time.",
        "Wyatt: Liam's gonna be okay. Don't worry. You should think about this from Ivy's perspective. I mean, Liam is her hero. He jumped into the seine to save her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Good job, Sheila. The party was a success, the meat was fantastic.",
        "Aly: It was so much fun. Great having Caroline around again, too. Thanks for doing this.",
        "Oliver: We're gonna grab some ice cream. I'm paying if you guys want to come.",
        "Aly: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Uh, rain check for me. Thank you.",
        "Ivy: Mm.",
        "Aly: Hey, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Aly: Listen, I'm sorry tonight didn't go as well as --",
        "Ivy: Oh, no, it's okay.",
        "Oliver: You ready?",
        "Aly: Yeah. I'll help you finish cleaning up when I get home, okay?",
        "Ivy: Okay. [Chuckles]",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Ivy: See you. [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Well... I think I'm gonna head out, too. Thanks for having me.",
        "Ivy: Well, I'm just really glad you came. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Yeah. Look, I know I probably wasn't a lot of fun tonight. I'm just -- you know.",
        "Ivy: I just -- I was just hoping I could make you smile. Or something. That's all.",
        "Liam: I did have a good time, even though it didn't look like it.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Liam... I really like you. And I -- I totally understand that you're going through this breakup right now, so I don't want to be putting pressure on you or seeming like I'm chasing you. So, maybe tonight was a really bad idea. 'Cause I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you that I kind of had -- kind of had my hopes up. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Oh, Ivy. I --",
        "Ivy: Look, why don't we just call it, um, G'day and good night, mate? [Chuckles] And we'll just leave it at that.",
