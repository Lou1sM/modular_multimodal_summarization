    "Recap": [
        "Caroline is stunned that Ridge has a crib/basket. He explains it is the only one he could find. He starts rambling that if it is a girl they can get something else. He just wants it to be healthy. This doesn't seem to make her look any happier but she wants to be sure this is what he wants. He explains that he did not want another family but he saw her walk out the door and a huge part of him went with her. He does want a baby to share with her. They hug and Caroline cries like a baby and says she wants this more than anything. Liam and Ivy storm into Rick's office. She laments that she knows exactly why he wants her out of the country. He reminds her that she is the face of Forrester and photo shoots are part of that job. She says she will not turn over the video until Steffy admits she murdered Aly and they both know that is not going to happen, so Steffy will have to live with it hanging over her head. He continues that Aly would not want this. As misguided as she may have been she did play by the rules. He says Ivy knows that Aly hated Steffy but her death was an accident and they need to let it go, pick up the pieces and all move on. He feels Ivy is holding the video against him because he is now with Steffy and is getting back at him.",
        "Wyatt and Steffy walk into his house. He admits Ivy is not making this easy on anybody. Steffy declares that the video must be deleted along with all copies. She wants it gone for good. Wyatt tells her to calm down as he never agreed to anything. She says this is serious and he is wasting her time if he is not going to delete the video. She thought they had a connection. Thomas walks into Ridge's loft via Ridge's text. He notices the crib and Caroline can not look at him but looks confused and scared. Thomas is unsure what is going to happen. Ridge tells him that they had a rough patch last night. He said some things he did not mean but he and Caroline are back together. The crib is not for now but later. They are going to have a family together. Thomas says all the right things. He is happy for them. He is ready to be a big brother. Ridge begins to go on and on and Caroline tells him that Thomas probably does not need all of this. He just wants to get on with his work. Ridge is happy to talk about that too and says it will make him proud to offer Thomas to be part of the designing team and he will continue to work with Caroline. Clearly surprised, Caroline says that will be great and well deserved but as Thomas and his dad hug, Thomas looks over his shoulder at Caroline but her eyes will not meet his. Ivy tells Liam that there has been too much change and sadness in so little time. Steffy comes back and reclaims Liam as her boyfriend. She feels unappreciated and misled. This is all about Steffy now. There was not a rock on the video and Steffy is lying to him. They should be thanking her that Steffy is not in prison. And they are kidding themselves if they think she is deleting the video. Steffy is still haranguing Wyatt to delete the video. She opens the laptop and finds the video. Wyatt is conflicted as he does not believe Steffy murdered Aly but he knows this will upset Ivy greatly. He has the mouse in his hand and pointed toward the delete button when Ivy walks in and sees what Wyatt is about to do. He explains that what she wants to do is wrong. With both girls on either side of him and the computer, one is telling him to go ahead and delete while the other barks at him not to touch it."

        "Caroline: I can't believe you bought that.",
        "Ridge: Well, he's got to sleep somewhere. Or she. They just had a blue one, so I got the blue one. If it's a girl, we'll get something else. Just -- I don't care what it is. I just want it to be healthy.",
        "Caroline: Are you sure that you want this, though? You have to be sure.",
        "Ridge: I don't want this. I don't. I... I told you I-I don't -- I don't want another kid. I've raised kids. I-I... but you walked out that door, and a big part of me walked out with you. And the rest of me was standing here wondering what just happened. And I was looking around this place, and all I could see was you, naked, just... running around wearing nothing but the paint off my fingers and your joy for life. And I sat on our bed and... I thought about not -- not what I want, but what I need. I need you. 'Cause without you, none of this makes any sense to me. [Sighs] I don't want a family with you. I need a family with you, because... I need to share that with you. So, what do you say?",
        "Caroline: [Sobbing] I want that more than anything.",
        "Ridge: Come here.",

        "Caroline: [Sobs]",
        "Thomas: I would be really nice to you if you'd just let me show you.",
        "Caroline: What happened? Why are you here?",
        "Thomas: Hey, I-I wouldn't do that to you.",
        "Caroline: Don't touch me! The pills.",
        "Thomas: What pills did you take?",
        "Caroline: I took anti-anxiety pills before you got here because I was so upset about everything! I took pills!",
        "Thomas: You seriously don't remember anything?",
        "Caroline: I didn't want that! I didn't want that!",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Liam, you can deny this as much as you like, but I'm not stupid, okay? I know exactly why you're trying to ship me off to Monte Carlo.",
        "Liam: Ivy, you're the new face of the company! Just ask Maya! Photoshoots are part of the territory, okay? Or did you not know that when you blackmailed your way into the job?",
        "Ivy: Do you really think getting rid of me is gonna make me forget that I have this video?",
        "Liam: Okay, so you're just -- you're just gonna keep on holding it over Steffy's head. That's great. God, Ivy! What happened to you? Honestly? You got the face of Forrester. Steffy held up her end of the deal, and you're still taunting her. You're still threatening her. When is it gonna end?!",
        "Ivy: When Steffy finally admits to murdering Aly! That's when! But you and I both know that that's not gonna happen. So she's just gonna have to live with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I'm not dealing with this for the rest of my life. No, don't look at me like that. I'm serious. I'm not putting up with this from Ivy anymore.",
        "Wyatt: She definitely isn't making it easy for any of us, that's for sure.",
        "Steffy: Okay, so we're doing this? You said it's on several devices?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Yeah.",
        "Steffy: All right, I'm sure it's on some kind of virtual storage, so let's hack into that and delete the video.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, I want the video gone for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Ivy, trust me. You do not want this on your conscience. I know you're -- I know you're hurting right now. I know you miss Aly. But using her death as a weapon against Steffy -- it's not gonna bring justice, and it's not gonna bring Aly back.",
        "Ivy: Right now, Liam, it's the best thing I can do for her.",
        "Liam: No! [Chuckles] No, no, it's not! The highest moral standards, always following the rules. I mean, misguided as she was, that was her passion.",
        "Ivy: Aly hated Steffy! She was disgusted with her, the way she threw herself at you, disrespected me!",
        "Liam: Okay, all right. Aly's death, it's tragic enough, don't you think?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "Liam: Can you let it go? Can -- can you let us all pick up the pieces and move on? Delete the video.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Hope you weren't in the middle of something.",
        "Thomas: No, no. I was just at the office working on some sketches when I got your text.",
        "Ridge: Well, you're probably wondering why I got you over here. Probably both wondering.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. What's going on? Is -- is everything okay?",
        "Ridge: Caroline and I, we went, uh, through a bit of a rough patch last night.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I heard. Uh, Brooke told me.",
        "Ridge: Well, it was my fault. Uh, I said some things I shouldn't have said. Said some things I didn't mean. I realized I-I can't live without her. And luckily she feels the same way. So now we're back together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hey, I know you're in pain. I know you're upset over losing Aly. We all are. Steffy is more than you think.",
        "Ivy: Oh, come on, Liam. Steffy doesn't miss Aly. She's just worried about getting in trouble.",
        "Liam: Well, uh, yeah. That, too. Wouldn't you be?",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah. You know what? I would be -- if I was guilty.",
        "Liam: She's not guilty, not of what you're accusing her of.",
        "Ivy: So then why does she care so much about this video? Why? Can you tell me that? If she really is innocent, why does she care if I have it or not?",
        "Liam: You -- what? You know why. Because it looks bad.",
        "Ivy: It looks bad, Liam, because it is. I would never believe that Steffy was defending herself against Aly. Boy, does she have you fooled.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Why does that say about you?",
        "Liam: Okay. I know how personal this is for you. I do. And I know that it's not just because of Aly. This isn't about making Steffy pay. It's not about landing the face of Forrester. It's about getting back at me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: What are we waiting for? Let's do this.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, just slow down for a second. I didn't exactly agree to helping you.",
        "Steffy: Then why am I here?",
        "Wyatt: I told you that I was considering it.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. Sit down! You are wasting my time! I don't want to play games, all right? This has gone on long enough.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Steffy: No, I'm serious, Wyatt. I know we haven't known each other that long, but... I feel some kind of connection, and I know you feel that, too.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I thought we did, at least, but now you're with Liam.",
        "Steffy: And you're a pawn in Ivy's game.",
        "Wyatt: I am not a pawn in Ivy's game.",
        "Steffy: If you don't do this, you are just as much to blame.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, well, that kind of sucks now, doesn't it?",
        "Steffy: You have the power.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: Just a few clicks, and that video can be gone for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Is -- is that a --",
        "Ridge: It is what it is. It's a little premature. Caroline and I -- we want to have a family together. Not right away. Within the next year, right?",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas: Wow. Wow. That's great. It's really great. That's big news.",
        "Ridge: It is big news. And speaking of big, are you ready to be a big brother again?",
        "Thomas: Sure, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely. So, is that -- is that why you called me over?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Um... I wanted you to be one of the first to know, because I know you've had a problem with our relationship because of my age and my track record and the fact that I don't want to have kids.",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: And -- and you were right about a lot of that stuff. But I really do want to have a family with the woman I love.",
        "Thomas: I'm -- I'm really, really happy for you, Dad.",
        "Caroline: You know what? Um, Thomas doesn't want to hear any of that stuff. I mean, he's busy at work, so he just...",
        "Ridge: He wants -- you want to hear it, right? And oh, oh. Work. Speaking of the office... [Sighs] It's not easy for me. I know you've -- you've worked hard. You've put in a lot of effort, and it shows. Your work is -- is much better. And I'm proud of what you've done. So, um, Thomas Forrester, I am very happy to have you as part of the Forrester design team. Very nice job. And I like what you guys have been doing together, and I want you to continue doing that.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: You're part of the team. You got to be overjoyed right now.",
        "Thomas: I am. I'm -- I'm just surprised, that's all. I-I didn't expect this.",
        "Ridge: Well, you're not surprised, right? You've been supporting this guy ever since he came back from Paris.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, no, I-I think it's great. Um, I think it's very well-deserved and, yeah, I think Thomas is gonna be great.",
        "Ridge: I agree. I have all the confidence in you.",
        "Thomas: Thank you, Dad. I-I don't know what to say. I'm so happy about this. This is an amazing opportunity. Your trust, your belief in me. I don't know if I deserve it, but...",
        "Ridge: Hey. You deserve everything. You're my son. You work hard. I love you. And the two of you, you're gonna do some great work together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I've lost so much, Liam. So much so quickly in the smallest amount of time. It's just -- there's too much change. There's too much sadness. One minute you and I are together. We were happy. And now we're not. Aly was here. She was alive. And now she's gone. And you know what? I am really upset with you. I am. I feel misled, and I feel unappreciated, and I feel abandoned. But, Liam, that's -- that's not the issue. We are not the issue. The real problem is what Steffy did to Aly. That's what this whole thing is about.",
        "Liam: Ivy, it was a tragic --",
        "Ivy: \"Oh, it was a tragic accident. It was a mistake.\" Do you know how tired I am of hearing that?",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, it's true.",
        "Ivy: No, it's not. What's true is Steffy hitting Aly with a tire iron.",
        "Liam: Yeah! Because she was trying to knock the big-ass rock out of her hand!",
        "Ivy: What rock are you talking about? What is this mystery rock? I've seen the video. You've seen the video. Where is it? She's lying to you! Steffy is lying to you, Liam!",
        "Liam: You know what? I don't care. I don't care if the rock can't be seen on the video. Steffy's not a liar, and she's not a murderer. And you have got to realize that.",
        "Ivy: What I realize, Liam, is that Steffy gets away with everything. She does. She attacked our relationship. She stole you. She's taken Aly's life. She gets away with everything. She's the dangerous one, and that video proves that. God, I just -- I wish -- I wish you would listen to me! I wish you would see things from my perspective! You have no idea how badly I wish things were different.",
        "Liam: So do I. But please don't punish Steffy for something I did to you.",
        "Ivy: Oh, Liam, not everything is about you! Steffy is guilty. She killed Aly. And you two should be thanking me for not throwing her in prison. And as for the evidence that I have, you're kidding yourself if you think I'm gonna delete it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You're a good guy. And I know you want to do the right thing.",
        "Wyatt: If I destroy the video, all hell's gonna break loose, and you know it.",
        "Steffy: What? Ivy's gonna be mad at you?",
        "Wyatt: Yes! Yes! And I hate the thought of hurting her or betraying her.",
        "Steffy: This is the best thing for Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God.",
        "Steffy: She is filled with resentment and anger, and so are you.",
        "Wyatt: What? Me?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Me?",
        "Steffy: There is resentment in you. It's coming out of your ears, and it's all about Liam. Liam and I are back together. He's vice president. And that bothers you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, it does bother me.",
        "Steffy: All right. I'll tell you what. You want to advance in this company?",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: I will sing your praises to my father. All you have to do is delete that video right now. And I won't hold anything against you. It's plain and simple. Just log in to Ivy's account. I know you have her password memorized. Just log in and delete it. I don't want any trace. Delete it from her phone, from the master file. I want it gone everywhere. Do it, Wyatt. End this once and for all. Make it disappear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I realize I was hard on you. I know that. I ripped up your design. That's not...",
        "Thomas: Well, you made me work twice as hard as everyone else, yeah.",
        "Ridge: Yes, I did. I pushed you, because I feel you needed that. And you did. Look at what you're doing now. That white dress that you guys put together was fantastic. And that red number? [Sighs] I -- hmm. I hate to say this, but I think you might be more talented than I was when I was your age.",
        "Thomas: [Laughs] Wow. Uh, thanks, Dad.",
        "Ridge: Well, enjoy it, 'cause I'm never gonna say that again. No hard feelings, okay?",
        "Thomas: No, of course not.",
        "Ridge: This is great. I get to design with my eldest boy, just like my dad did with me. I have so much faith in you. Just this loyal, honest person. You're my son. You can do so much. [Sighs] Congratulations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Why are you hesitating?",
        "Wyatt: Steffy! What you're asking me to do, it's kind of a huge deal. You're asking me to betray Ivy's trust here.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, come on.",
        "Wyatt: Imagine if the tables were turned, and I expected you to betray Mr. Perfect.",
        "Steffy: That would be -- that's different.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, re-- how?",
        "Steffy: He wouldn't blackmail me with false murder charges. And we were married.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Right. How can anyone forget your complicated history?",
        "Steffy: Okay, I get that you and Ivy are a couple now. But wrong is wrong. Don't you get it? Everything that I cherish, everything that I love, everything that I have worked for, she is threatening to take it away from me! She wants me to suffer. God, if this video gets out, this video goes to the police, then I go to prison for the rest of my life for something that I didn't do! [Sighs] I didn't want Aly to die. I am a mess about this. And I don't know how much more I can take. I had two choices that night -- death or self-defense. I don't know what else I can tell you, but this is not my fault. It's really not. I just wish you would believe me. Like, why -- look at me. Do you really believe that I'm a cold-blooded murderer? Do you?",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Steffy: Then do the honorable thing. Delete the video. [Sighs] Wyatt, I swear to God. I swear to God there was a rock. I mean, it's -- it's the camera. It's the angle. But it was there! Come on. I know you believe me. Ivy doesn't, but I know you do. Just delete it!",
        "Ivy: What's going on? What are you doing here?",
        "Steffy: Tell her. Tell her.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy, look, I-I know you're upset. Aly's gone, and your heart is broken, but -- but what you're doing, blackmailing Steffy and threatening to go to the police, it's wrong.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, what are you -- what are you doing on my computer?",
        "Wyatt: I'm just, um --",
        "Ivy: Why are you on my account? What the hell are you doing, Wyatt?!",
        "Wyatt: Ivy, listen to me for a second.",
        "Ivy: No, don't -- whatever she has told you, do not do it!",
        "Steffy: He's doing the right thing! Wyatt, do it.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, whatever you do, do not delete that video.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, just hit the button! Wyatt!"
