        "Ridge: Answer me, Logan. Will you forgive me? I promise I will never, ever leave you again. We can be happy, I know you can. You know that, too. Tell me you'll come back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Who's kissing who?",
        "Donna: They're not kissing anymore. I think Ridge started it, but Brooke didn't resist.",
        "Nick: Is he touching her? Or holding her?",
        "Bridget: Nick, don't do this to yourself.",
        "Nick: Tell me!",
        "Donna: The only way I can describe it is -- they look hungry, like they want to shallow each other up. I can't do this. I'll talk to you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: I just wanted to check on you. I thought there might be a problem with your phone.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, your mother told me that you tried to call.",
        "Thorne: You talked to my mother?",
        "Taylor: Yes, she came over here, but I think she was using that phone thing as an excuse to talk about other things.",
        "Thorne: What other things?",
        "Taylor: You don't know?",
        "Thorne: You and me?",
        "Taylor: Well, I guess you mentioned that little kiss that happened, and being the proactive parent she is, she was all over it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: You're hanging \"Keep out\" signs around Taylor like she was your personal property.",
        "Stephanie: No, just one. And it reads, \"Keep out, H. Ramirez.\"",
        "Hector: I need her. I'm not sure I can deal with this without her.",
        "Stephanie: Of course, you can.",
        "Hector: How do you know? You have no idea what it's like.",
        "Stephanie: No, I don't have any idea. You're absolutely right. And I feel awful that this terrible thing has happened to you.",
        "Hector: But your son needs some lovin'. And damn it, you're going to get it for him.",
        "Stephanie: I don't want any obstacles. I want love, if it's going to, just to simply take it's own natural course.",
        "Hector: Obstacles. Obstacles like me?",
        "Stephanie: Hector, you should never have moved into the house. It's wrong, and it wasn't honest, hector. Because you want more than just friendship. Save to say, you and Taylor are not going to happen. So, stop being so self-serving and selfish, and move out of the house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Are you upset that I told my mother about us?",
        "Taylor: No, no, Thorne. Not at all.",
        "Thorne: She's not pressuring you, is she?",
        "Taylor: No, I'm a big girl. I make my own decisions.",
        "Thorne: You know, she does have a point, though.",
        "Taylor: You think?",
        "Thorne: I thought I'd never smile again. You've changed that.",
        "Taylor: I'm glad.",
        "Thorne: Thank you, Taylor. You may have saved my life.",
        "Taylor: Well, you're welcome.",
        "Thorne: Am I frightening you?",
        "Taylor: No. No, you're not frightening me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Oh, darn. Bad timing, I'm sorry.",
        "Thorne: Mother, I didn't know you were here.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I was actually upstairs chatting with Hector.",
        "Thorne: Hector's here?",
        "Stephanie: Not for long, I hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I can't come back to you, Ridge. It's too late. The damage has already been done.",
        "Ridge: Damage? Look at us, Brooke. We're still young. We still have our passion, our creativity. We survived the hardships, Brooke, the mistakes, the wrong decisions, and now we have the chance to make the right decision. We have a lot of great years ahead of us, Brooke. Why would we want to spend them apart?",
        "Brooke: Because I don't trust you.",
        "Ridge: No, you don't trust your father. I can still see that little 12-year- old girl inside of you that was abandoned so many years ago. She was hardwired not to trust anymore, and I completely understand. But you're not that child anymore, Brooke. You've experienced life. You understand that no great thing comes without risk.",
        "Brooke: Maybe not. But what I found in nick --",
        "Ridge: What you found in Nick was compromise. Is that what you want to say on your deathbed? \"I made a good compromise\"? Or would you rather say, \"I went for it. I went with my passion.\"",
        "Brooke: What I have found in Nick is not nothing, Ridge. He loves me. He interests me. He makes me laugh. He makes me feel safe. And maybe that's what I need in my life right now -- a little safety. Which is something you could never provide. And that's what Nick gives to me, and he always will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Wait, Nick -- look, you really don't need that.",
        "Nick: Let go.",
        "Nick: My wife's in love with another man. She loves him more than me.",
        "Bridget: I'm so sorry.",
        "Nick: And you knew.",
        "Bridget: Nick, I -- I thought it would be so different for you. It's just what my mom does. She runs back to Ridge. It's a sickness. I let you go, and part of me knew that this might happen. But you had to learn it yourself.",
        "Nick: Well, lesson learned. What do I do now? ...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I will always love you.",
        "Ridge: I don't want a memory, Brooke. I want us.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry, Ridge. I just can't come back to you.",
        "Ridge: Then, you know, I -- I'll have to move on.",
        "Brooke: With Donna?",
        "Ridge: She's an amazing woman.",
        "Brooke: Just don't hurt her.",
        "Ridge: I don't intend to.",
        "Brooke: It hurts me to see you two together.",
        "Ridge: It doesn't have to happen.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, don't, please. No one gets to me the way you do. You know that. I am going to stick to my vows that I made with Nick. No matter what I've put him through, he's always been there for me. And he will be forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Oh -- oh, I got a lot of good hate going on right now.",
        "Bridget: That's just poison for your soul, Nick.",
        "Nick: Well, then my soul has either been poisoned or cleansed! [Nick crying] She said she loved just me. But she doesn't. She doesn't. You can have her, Forrester! She's yours! She's all yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Where's Brooke?",
        "Ridge: She went home to sort things out.",
        "Donna: You mean how to tell Nick she's leaving him for you? You really had me going, Ridge Forrester. You're one smooth son of a gun.",
        "Ridge: Donna, listen --",
        "Donna: No, you listen to me. You made a fool of me on national television tonight. And it wasn't even for the publicity. I mean, I was just the bait on your hook, wasn't I? You knew that Brooke couldn't resist turning the tube on, and she'd see you sweet-talking me -- and kissing me. And she'd come back to claim what was rightfully hers. You're not the man I thought you were, Ridge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: You know, I can understand why you would want to reach out and help hector, because that's who you are. I mean, look at what you've done for me and for Alexandria. But to move him into your home, I can't help but wonder if that's a good idea, Taylor.",
        "Stephanie: Amen.",
        "Thorne: Mother?",
        "Stephanie: Okay, you handle it. But I agree with you.",
        "Thorne: I mean, let's face it, this guy has a major crush on you.",
        "Taylor: Well, that may be true, but the more important fact is that he just lost his eyesight. Okay? He's got a lot of adjustments to make, and he needs somebody he feels close to to help him get through that.",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, I am perfectly prepared, financially, to help hector. Help him find a place that he can have of his own, where you can visit him. Help with the dog training -- I mean, isn't independence supposed to be his main goal?",
        "Taylor: Yes, and I agree with you, he needs all of those things. But right now, he's in a very fragile place.",
        "Stephanie: And you're not? You're a recovering alcoholic, you need to take care of yourself.",
        "Thorne: And there's other people who need you.",
        "Taylor: Well, I'm not going to stop being there for you and Alexandria, if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Thorne: You're spreading yourself pretty thin.",
        "Taylor: Well, what's new?",
        "Stephanie: We're just trying to help.",
        "Taylor: I know you are, but you're not.",
        "Stephanie: Taylor --",
        "Thorne: You know, mom, she's right. We've had our say, okay? It's time for us to pitch in. I will help you with Hector, okay? Anything that I can do to help lighten the burden, I'll be there for you, okay?",
        "Taylor: Thank you. Thank you very much, Thorne. I do appreciate that. It's only temporary. It's just a very temporary arrangement. Just until hector, you know -- [Crashing sounds] Oh -- oh, my goodness. Okay, let me go check on him.",
        "Thorne: You want me to go with you?",
        "Taylor: No, no, it's okay. Thanks -- thanks for offering.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Hector! What happened?",
        "Hector: I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Taylor: Why do you keep walking around the house?",
        "Hector: I thought I was going towards the dresser, and then I get all turned around. And suddenly I realized that I was out in the hallway, and I didn't know which way I was turned. I didn't know where the stairs were, and then I just froze up, I panicked.",
        "Taylor: It's okay, it's okay. It could have happened to anybody. It's all right.",
        "Hector: I felt like I was falling, like everything was spinning. I didn't know which way was up, or which way was down --",
        "Taylor: Hector, listen to me, you're going to get used to it, okay? Your brain will learn how to compensate for a lack of visual cues. Hector, you'll get used to your blindness, alright? And I'm going to help you through it.",
        "Hector: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Taylor: It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: You know what's really sad?",
        "Ridge: I thought you said you were finished.",
        "Donna: You're empty inside, because you're not honest. You're not real. You just say whatever it is you need to say to get what you want, and you don't care who you walk on.",
        "Ridge: Alright, I think it's time, Donna, that you hush up and listen.",
        "Donna: Oh what? Did I wound you?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Donna: No, of course not, you have to be bullet-proof to be Ridge Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Donna --",
        "Donna: Go ahead, talk. But I'm not listening.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Brooke is not leaving Nick. We got into it, and she chose him over me.",
        "Donna: Why should I believe you?",
        "Ridge: Call up your sister at home and ask her. She doesn't trust me not to leave her. Bottom line of all this is I guess she just doesn't want an exciting life. Nick is safe, Nick is secure, and she wants him. 'Til death do them part. And you, Donna, are what I want.",
        "Donna: But they're always be Brooke.",
        "Ridge: I admit, it may be difficult for me to let go of that. But I will. I'm just trying to be honest here. I admit, Brooke and I have one hell of a history. But as she's pointed out to me, that's all it is, a history. Never to be repeated again.",
        "Donna: Never? Oh, I could so easily --",
        "Ridge: Easily what?",
        "Donna: I'm gonna go home now. Tomorrow's a new day, and we'll take it from there.",
        "Ridge: Alright then. I personally am looking very forward to this, because, Miss Donna Logan, you are what I need.",
        "Donna: Brooke's lipstick. I'll see you tomorrow. I have to say, thank goodness for Nick Marone, I hope he makes my sister very happy for a very long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I'm exactly what I didn't want to be. I'm a fool. Bridget: No, Nick you're not a fool. You're a man who has to --",
        "Nick: I believed something that wasn't true! It's over.",
        "Bridget: Oh Nick. Oh god, I hate to see you like this. Oh god, I'm so sorry. I hate to see you hurting like this, I just want to take the pain away.",
        "Nick: You can't. It won't go away.",
        "Bridget: Oh honey, I'm so sorry. Oh god. Oh Nick."
