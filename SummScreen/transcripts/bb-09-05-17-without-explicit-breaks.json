        "Bill says enough apologies. He'd do it again with no regrets to get his niece and Thomas back together. He warns Liam to tell the truth and tell all of them this is not true. Quinn tells Ridge that if she has to be stuck with anyone in the elevator it might as well be with her best friend. Sheila continues to stand over Charlie's shoulder looking at footage and he tells her it is time to let them out of the elevator. She says no it is her that gets to decide that. She urges Ridge to go ahead and kiss Quinn; she knows he wants to. Justin comes into Bill's office but instead of being in Bill's corner he says according to bylaws if Bill cannot run the country then it falls to Liam. Bill puts his hands out and tells them to take him away as quickly as possible and get this over with. Liam says he is calling the shots now and he will not let this company be run by a criminal which is what Bill is. Ridge tells Quinn that it feels nice for her to say she missed him. He hopes they can remain friends now that she is back with his dad. She puts her hands on his shoulder and says she too does not want to lose that bond. And she is going to make it her life mission to help him with his quest with Eric and Brooke. Bill tells Lt. Baker he will have to question him right now. He is not leaving this Bozo in charge for one more second. Then he starts in on Sally, the character witness. Lt. Baker reads Bill his rights to remain silent. He shouts he will not remain silent. He turns to Liam and says he was the son who came out of nowhere and he gave him the keys to the kingdom and he will be sorry for this.",
        "Steffy calls out Liam's name and he comes out of his foggy fantasy as she asks if he really wants to put his father through this by turning him in. Sheila is disappointed that neither Quinn nor Ridge are making a move toward each other. Charlie says she has photos and that is as far as it goes. Suddenly the elevator is open; Quinn and Ridge are free. Quinn says she will go find Ivy to say she is still alive. Ridge goes to find Charlie and he says it was just unfortunate timing. It won't happen again. Liam says he is not doing this just for Sally but for himself as well. Thomas comes in and says he is heading back to New York. He wanted to give Caroline a little more time to say goodbye to Bill. He does not know when he will be back. Steffy says it sounds like he is leaving permanently. Thomas laments it feels right. Liam asks about Sally. Thomas says he is doing what he has to do and Sally knows that. He has to be with his son; that is the most important thing. Steffy hugs him but Liam tells him to wait. When Ridge leaves, Sheila comes out of hiding and tells Charlie they have the pictures that will come in handy but get ready for his next assignment. He retorts that he is not working for her. She says now he is. CJ calls Bill and says something unfortunate has happened. There was a fire at Spectra. He has been talking to his mom a lot and they have come up with a plan. He'd like to meet if Bill still wants the Spectra property. Bill plays coy and says okay, just set up an appointment with his secretary and they can discuss it. Thomas says goodbye and Liam asks Steffy why did she stop him from telling Thomas. Liam says no he doesn't want his father in jail but he did wrong and needs to be held responsible. He holds onto his sword necklace and says that once meant something to him but not anymore. He is not his father and never will be. She says she knows he wants to do the right thing but she does not believe that means Bill going to prison. Liam says he does not know. He knows he has power now for the first time in his life .power over his father."

        "Charlie: Maybe -- maybe they don't need to. Maybe those pictures you took will be damaging enough.",
        "Sheila: It's disgusting, the way they look at each other.",
        "Quinn: Though, if I did have to be stuck in an elevator... might as well be with my best friend.",
        "Ridge: Right?",
        "Quinn: Right. Although, I am going to be getting hungry really soon. That's not gonna be good news for you, or anyone.",

        "Liam: I could tell lieutenant baker I was wrong to call him here, that I made a mistake, that I misunderstood, that I'm a spoiled brat lashing out at daddy, but I'm not gonna do that because it's not true. And today I stand up for what's right.",
        "Bill: Justin! Welcome! Join the party. From this point forward, all questions will be directed to my attorney, who is so on top of things, I didn't even have to summon him.",
        "Justin: Actually, I, uh... I was summoned. By your son.",
        "Liam: You want to tell him?",
        "Bill: Tell me what?",
        "Justin: According to the company bylaws, if you are under arrest, incarcerated, or otherwise unable to perform your duties...",
        "Bill: Yeah?",
        "Justin: The president of spencer publications assumes control.",
        "Liam: That'd be me. I'm in charge now, dad. But don't worry -- I'll run this ship just fine while you're behind bars. I'll make some changes, steer the company in a better direction. I think -- I think I'll revamp our benefits, expand our 401(k) plan. Finally get us involved in some charity work.",
        "Bill: [ Chuckles ] Ah, this is great. You enjoy your, uh, do-gooder revolution while it lasts. Let's go. Let's go. I want to get this over with as quickly as possible. Take me in! Because I want to get back before the end of the day, so i can undo whatever damage this idiot causes!",

        "Lt. Baker: Eventually happens to even the smartest of criminals.",
        "Liam: You hear that? Criminals. That's what you are. A criminal. And I'm not going to allow my family or my company or my legacy to be run by a criminal any longer. I'm calling the shots, and i will be for a long, long time.",
        "Sheila: [ Clears throat ]",
        "Ridge: You know what you said earlier about... about missing me. I liked that. It was nice. I miss who we were together. But, hey, you're with my dad, you're back with him, and that's great, and that's the only thing that matters. And if that means we can't be friends anymore, so be it, but i hope it doesn't have to be that way.",
        "Quinn: I think we can make this friendship work. We have a bond that I don't want to lose.",
        "Sheila: See there? It's happening. It's not gonna be much longer.",

        "Ridge: Well, you don't have to take that on.",
        "Quinn: No, no. I think I do. I mean, he forgave me. I just have to get him to see that he needs to forgive you, too.",

        "Quinn: What are friends for?",
        "Sheila: Oh, she wants him so bad.",
        "Bill: I've changed my mind. I'm not going in. You have questions, you can ask me right here. I'm not giving this bozo the satisfaction of being in charge for even one second.",
        "Lt. Baker: You say he confessed to you?",
        "Liam: He did.",
        "Lt. Baker: Then I'm afraid this has gone way past a simple questioning.",
        "Bill: Even if I said what he claims I did, how does he know i wasn't messing with him? I say things to get a rise out of people all the time!",
        "Sally: Okay, for what it's worth, bill has an established history of attacking my company, and I will gladly testify to that.",
        "Bill: Oh, wow, isn't that great? So we have the thief! The two-bit ripoff artist is the character witness! Case closed!",
        "Justin: Bill, I need to insist that you --",
        "Lt. Baker: You can insist all you want, mr. Barber, but do it at the station. I've heard more than enough to warrant an arrest.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? How'd we go from questions to an arrest?",
        "Lt. Baker: Bill spencer, you have the right to remain silent...",
        "Bill: Like hell I'll remain silent!",

        "Liam: This is the right thing!",
        "Lt. Baker: If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights as I have explained them?",
        "Bill: Do you understand the rights that you're giving up? The right to be a spencer!",

        "Bill: Don't do this! Liam!",
        "Steffy: Liam! Are you seriously thinking about doing this? Because it could go down just like that. Your father could just be hauled off, and he'd never be able to forgive you.",
        "Liam: He'd deserve it, wouldn't he?",
        "Steffy: I can't believe your father did this. What he did was so wrong. But do you really want to put your father in jail? Could you really go through with it?",
        "Quinn: How can nobody have heard us?",
        "Ridge: I'm sure they're fixing it right now.",
        "Quinn: Just like I'm gonna be fixing your relationship with your father.",

        "Liam: It's not just for sally. It's for me. It's for spencer. Maybe it's time my family's company became about more than greed and power. Maybe it's time to change what it means to be a spencer.",

        "Bill: Something about a fire. Yeah. It's unfortunate.",
        "C.J.: Very. Um... anyway, I have been speaking at great length with my mother, and I have finally convinced her to sell the property.",

        "Steffy: The truth doesn't accomplish anything. He would leave caroline, he'd be confusing his son, and you know what would happen? He'd put two and two together about the fire. As much as you're fantasizing about this idea, I know you don't want your father in jail.",
