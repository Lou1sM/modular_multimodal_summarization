        "Nick: Something happened last night. Something you need to know.",
        "Brooke: What I need is your forgiveness.",
        "Nick: This isn't about you and Ridge.",
        "Brooke: No, it's not. It's about us. And it's about you putting this ring back on your finger and giving our marriage another chance.",
        "Nick: Well, I don't think I can do that. Not after what happened last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: One night. Everything that seemed so impossible could actually be happening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: It doesn't bother you, Taylor? Having me here?",
        "Taylor: I wouldn't have asked you to stay here if it did.",
        "Hector: You are a saint. After everything I've put you through.",
        "Taylor: Well, you haven't always acted appropriately, but I guess your heart was in the right place.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Hector: Oh, that could be Christian. He's getting back from Africa today.",
        "Taylor: Oh, well, maybe it is, but I think it's Thorne. I'm expecting him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I went to the Marlin last night. I was angry. Brooke you had a right to be. I let you down.",
        "Nick: You kissed him.",
        "Brooke: I was vulnerable. For an instant, but that's all. It's never going to happen again, I promise you that.",
        "Nick: This isn't about Forrester.",
        "Brooke: I know. I know you don't want to talk about him, Nick, but we have to deal with it. We have to face it.",
        "Nick: Yes, we do. We've got to face it. What you did. What I did.",
        "Brooke: What did you do last night?",
        "Nick: I gave up on you. I thought we were finished. I believed that. That's why it happened. That's why -- [Cell phone rings] Yeah?",
        "Bridget: Are you with my mom?",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Bridget: She can not find out about last night. Please, please tell me that she doesn't know.",

        "Bridget: Well, do not tell her.",
        "Nick: I gotta go.",
        "Bridget: Wait, Nick. Nick, wait, please, I'm begging you. She's my mother. She can not find out. Nick --",
        "Brooke: I know what happened last night. You fell out of love with me. Well, I won't let you. This marriage means too much to me. And it's not going to end. Not this way. Not ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Christian, I am so glad you were able to make it.",
        "Thorne: Christian was just telling me he was in Africa when he got the news about hector.",
        "Christian: I can't believe it, Taylor. My brother, blind. Thank you so much for taking him in.",
        "Taylor: I'm just trying to help. I mean, he can stay for a while.",
        "Christian: Is he upstairs?",
        "Taylor: Yeah, go on up.",
        "Christian: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Well, that's perfect timing. Hector will be occupied for a little while and we can get started.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, thank you so much for helping me. It's just that Hector already has a lot to deal with. He doesn't need to be running into the furniture all the time.",
        "Thorne: No problem. We'll just make some paths for him and he can feel a lot more comfortable moving around down here.",
        "Taylor: Okay.",

        "Christian: Let me get it. It's on the floor.",

        "Felicia: Knock, knock.",
        "Bridget: Oh -- oh, Felicia, hey! Hi, come on in.",
        "Felicia: You sure? I don't mean to intrude.",
        "Bridget: Yeah. No, don't be silly. I'm just looking at photo albums and some of Nicole's stuff.",
        "Felicia: Little sister, you've had a lot of losses this year.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, but things are really looking up for me. I think things are really looking up for all of us.",
        "Felicia: Yeah?",
        "Bridget: Yeah. As of today, I think my life is back on track.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'm not going to give up on our life. And I'm not going to let you give up on it, either.",
        "Nick: Stop. Just stop.",
        "Brooke: I will, I will stop listening to Ridge and Stephanie. I'll do whatever it takes to prove to you how much I love you.",
        "Nick: No, there's nothing that you have to prove to me anymore.",
        "Brooke: I have to prove to you how much this relationship means to me. I don't know, maybe I'm just self-destructive. Maybe Ridge has been in my life for so long that I don't know how to break free of that. But I have to. I see that now. I betrayed you and I need to fix it.",
        "Nick: Can't fix it. Can't undo it.",
        "Brooke: But we can get past this. We can forget all about it and just move on. I want that more than ever, and I know you do, too.",
        "Nick: Just start over? Forget about last night?",
        "Brooke: Yes. I'm not going to take no for an answer. This marriage isn't over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Okay. So you really think this is going to help?",
        "Taylor: I guess it'll make it a little bit safer if he wants to go out on the balcony and get a little fresh air. I mean, he won't be able to enjoy the view, but -- this whole thing is just so sad.",
        "Thorne: It's a lot for you to take on.",
        "Taylor: I'm just trying to do whatever I can to help.",
        "Thorne: Well, believe me, I know how beneficial your friendship can be. I'd hate to think where Ally and I would be without it.",
        "Taylor: Well, if you're worried that I'm not going to have time for the two of you --",
        "Thorne: No, no.",
        "Taylor: Because I won't let that happen. You're too important to me.",
        "Thorne: Hector's important, too.",
        "Taylor: We've been through a lot together. Not all of it's been very good.",
        "Thorne: Look, you don't have to explain.",
        "Taylor: Well, I kind of feel like I do need to because, you know, I've invited a man to come live in my house. And I'm sure that that could be misinterpreted, especially by hector, and that's why I made it very clear to him that I know he has feelings for me, but I don't feel the same way.",
        "Thorne: I'm really glad to hear you say that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: So you haven't talked to your mom about what happened last night?",
        "Bridget: What happened last night?",
        "Felicia: Bridget, you know. Ridge and Donna's talk show stunt?",
        "Bridget: Oh, that.",
        "Felicia: Yeah, that! Thank you. That big kiss that's going to be on the cover of every tabloid on the newsstand?",
        "Bridget: Yeah.",
        "Felicia: Why? What did you think I was talking about?",
        "Bridget: Oh, nothing, nothing.",
        "Felicia: Oh, my god, you're mom's jealous, isn't she? Yes, and you didn't want to tell me because I'm friends with Nick, but my big brother's stunt worked. She can't stand seeing him with Donna. Ridge and Brooke are getting back together. I'm right.",
        "Bridget: Felicia -- oh, I think eventually we all end up with exactly who we're meant to be with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Nick, look at me, please. Just take this ring. Take the ring back.",
        "Nick: I can't take it. I can't take it after last night.",
        "Brooke: We can get past this. We have to. Please! Just put the ring back on your finger and we can forget all about last night. My god, what do I have to do? What do I have to say to prove to you how much I love you?",
        "Nick: I love you. I love you so much.",
        "Brooke: Well, then, forgive me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Nick: So am I.",
        "Brooke: We could still have the life that we planned. We could have the marriage that we wanted. No more Stephanie. No more Ridge. Just you, me and the kids. We can have everything.",
        "Nick: We can never let each other down again.",
        "Brooke: Never.",
        "Nick: Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Bridget: Hello?",
        "Nick: It's me. I just talked to your mom. I'm coming over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: I need your help, little brother. There has to be some way to get my sight back. Something new. Something that nobody's tried. A procedure, something.",
        "Christian: I'd have to talk to your doctors.",
        "Hector: They don't know how much I need this, but you do. You know, Taylor and I have had our ups and downs. And we were getting closer before the accident, before this happened to me. And I didn't think we could get that back. But now, she moved me into her home. She wants me here.",
        "Christian: She wants to help you, Hector.",
        "Hector: Yeah, but something more could come of this. I know it seems crazy, but I -- I believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Taylor, I hope I didn't misread this situation. I mean, the other day, we both felt something.",
        "Taylor: No, Thorne, I enjoy spending time with you and Alexandria, I really do. I mean, I'm not the kind of person who would kiss someone because they feel sorry for them. But I guess I kind of -- I do feel kind of guilty.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, I mean, so do I. It's -- I mean, it's so soon.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, we're still dealing with Darla's death.",
        "Thorne: And I always will be dealing with Darla's death. But Taylor, every day that I spend with you, I get stronger. And I'm able to look forward now. And I think Darla has a hand in that. I think she's guiding us. She's watching us. And she's allowing me to get past my anger and my bitterness. You know, I talk to her every night. And in my heart, I can hear her telling me it's okay for me to get on with my life. My life with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: So you talked to my mom?",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Bridget: And you didn't tell her what happened?",
        "Nick: No.",
        "Bridget: Oh, god. Thank god, Nick. She would never understand. I mean, I hardly even understand it myself. It's so -- it's so weird how life can be so crazy.",
        "Nick: Yes, it is.",
        "Bridget: Listen, I really -- there's just something I need you to know. I never ever stopped caring about you. As much as I really did try to get you out of my mind, I was never able to get you out of my heart.",
        "Nick: I never stopped caring about you. I never will.",
        "Bridget: I know that you were just infatuated with my mother. And I understand, it's so easy to get caught up and not be able to see what's really going on, but eventually you do. You know, and it's nothing that anyone can explain to you. It's just something that you have to realize on your own and in your own time.",
        "Nick: Bridget, I need to explain something.",
        "Bridget: No, no, Nick, it's okay. You really don't. I get it. Sometimes reality is just -- it's just too hard to look at. You put your wedding ring back on. Nick -- why did you put your wedding ring back on your finger?",
        "Nick: Your mother and I talked. She's sorry about what happened with Ridge.",
        "Bridget: She's sorry? She's sorry?",
        "Nick: She asked me to give the marriage another chance.",
        "Bridget: But you can't. She'll never be yours. You said that this morning.",
        "Nick: We agreed to start over.",
        "Bridget: Nick -- Nick, you can't let her do this to you! You've had nothing but a marriage that's caused you so much pain! What do you think's gonna change? Nothing is gonna change. You're going to be constantly disappointed, again and again. And after everything that's happened, after last night, after what we've done --",
        "Nick: Bridget, I'm committed to your mother. And there's only one way to deal with this, and that's the truth. I'm going to tell her everything.",
        "Bridget: No, Nick, you cannot!",
        "Nick: I'm going to tell your mother that we slept together.",
        "Bridget: Nick, no.",
        "Nick: She's going to understand, and she will forgive me. She will forgive both of us."
