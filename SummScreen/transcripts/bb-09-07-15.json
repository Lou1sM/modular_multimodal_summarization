        "Steffy tells Wyatt to delete the video while Ivy stands on his other side and tells him do not dare. Ridge hugs Caroline and Thomas tells him he is grateful that he asked him to join the team. He charges across the hall and runs into Brooke who notices the tension. He tells her all is okay and she is looking at the newest member of the design team. She hugs him. But she is surprised that Ridge and Caroline are back together. Ridge apologizes to Caroline for what he said earlier to hurt her. He says he never wants to be without her again. Wyatt tells Ivy this video is dangerous as it does not show everything. Steffy is not a murderer. Ivy tells him that he was not there, she was. He says he is putting an end to this today. He knows she thinks she is trying to avenge Aly but this is wrong. Steffy says she is attacking her life. Ivy says maybe Steffy should have thought of this before she picked up the tire iron.",
        "Wyatt says lots of mistakes were made but this is not murder. She can not blame Liam and Steffy, it was an accident. It was a mistake and she can not hold this over Steffy and blackmail her. She has to delete the video and give her another chance. They do not need another tragedy. He keeps repeating Steffy did not murder Aly so it was tragic. Steffy says she is not a bad person and she is not sure why Ivy is trying to ruin her life. She did not kill Aly and she did not take Liam away from Ivy. Wyatt reminds them they are family and that is what Aly stood for. Ivy keeps repeating that she saw no rock on the video. Thomas tells Brooke that Ridge felt like he could not be a father again but he thinks he can. Brooke says she can not believe that as he likes living in the moment and he just told her he had grown children and did not want any more. Caroline keeps looking at the crib and says she is looking forward someday to all those little fingers and toes and 3 a.m. feedings, all of it. He says there are a few things they need to work on first. He flips the page of his sketch pad and says there is one more line ----- it says \"will you marry me?\" She is his muse and gave him back his life and he does not want to live another day without her. He gets down on one knee and hands her a huge diamond and puts it on her finger. She clasps her hand over her mouth, almost afraid to believe it but finally pulls him to her and says yes. He says they can have the CEO and the designing, he just wants her back and for her to be happy. They have no champagne so they snuggle up on the bed with bottles of beer. Ivy admits she should have paid more attention to Aly. She went to crazy and they ignored it. She was sick and they all missed it. Wyatt says they can not bring Aly back but they can put an end to this. The video will only hurt the whole family. Ivy cries that she is sorry. She knows Steffy is not a murderer. She sits down and deletes the video then hugs Wyatt as Steffy looks on."

        "Steffy: Wyatt, come on! Do it!",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, you can't! We need it! Don't you dare delete that video!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Big day for all of us. Hey, welcome to the team.",
        "Thomas: Thanks again, Dad. I really don't want to let you down.",
        "Ridge: You're not gonna let me down. We're gonna be great together. The three of us -- we're gonna create beautiful things. And you will make a great mom.",
        "Thomas: And congratulations again. I'm really happy for you two.",
        "Brooke: Uh, I could work across the hall if you like.",
        "Thomas: No. No. It's -- it's fine, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I didn't mean to surprise you.",
        "Thomas: Seems like a running theme today.",
        "Brooke: Is everything okay?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah. Actually, you are looking at the newest member of the design team.",
        "Brooke: Wow! What?! Oh, my gosh! That's great! Congratulations! I knew your father would come through.",
        "Thomas: It's funny you should mention that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You have a short list?",
        "Caroline: Hmm?",
        "Ridge: Names. There's a lot of things to think about, but it always kind of comes down to that -- names. You okay? You seem preoccupied.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: This video is dangerous. It doesn't show what actually happened. Aly attacked Steffy. She was just reacting.",
        "Ivy: What did she do? Did she play to your old feelings for her or something? Is that it?",
        "Wyatt: What?! No! She's not a murderer, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Oh, seriously?!",
        "Wyatt: Yes!",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, even without that video, I'm still the only one who was eyewitness to the entire thing.",
        "Wyatt: Listen to me. Video or not, you cannot be going around with those kind of accusations. Blackmail -- it's wrong. And I'm putting an end to it -- today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I can't believe they're back together. Ridge ended things out of respect for Caroline and her desire to be a mother.",
        "Thomas: It's like I said -- he changed his mind.",
        "Brooke: But he can't.",
        "Thomas: He can, and he did. He's Ridge Forrester. He kind of does whatever he wants.",
        "Brooke: A bassinet? Seriously?",
        "Thomas: Bottom line is he's committed to having a baby with Caroline.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: What is it?",
        "Caroline: No, it's nothing. I'm sorry. I think, um... it's just a lot to process.",
        "Ridge: Don't apologize. This is -- this is... [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: We're starting a family together.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. I just -- I wish... I hadn't let you go.",
        "Caroline: Me, too.",
        "Ridge: I don't know what happened. I don't even know how those words came out of my mouth, you know? I-I just wish I could make that night go away, because I never want to hurt you.",
        "Caroline: I think everything that you were doing, you were just -- [Sighs] You thought it was what was best for me, and you were being selfless. Stupid.",
        "Ridge: Hey. I was stupid. You're right. I was stupid. [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: I'm really glad you came to your senses, though.",
        "Ridge: Me too. I never want to be without you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Just -- no. Hold on.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, I'm trying to --",
        "Wyatt: Listen to me! I know you think you're defending Aly and you're trying to make her death not in vain, but what you're doing isn't right. I never should have encouraged it in the first place. We saw an opportunity with the video, and we took it, and it's wrong.",
        "Ivy: You know what's wrong? It's Steffy murdering Aly! That's what's wrong!",
        "Steffy: Murdering?! I didn't murder Aly! You're blackmailing me with this video. You think you're avenging Aly's death, but you're attacking me. You're attacking my life!",
        "Ivy: Well, life has consequences, okay?! And maybe you should have thought of that before you picked up a tire iron --",
        "Wyatt: Just -- enough! Both of you, stop it! You're both Forresters! You're both family! This needs to be decided as a family. And I know I've made mistakes, and I'm gonna admit to them. Yeah. Was I upset that Liam took the VP position at Forrester and that you hooked up with him? Sure. But does this video make you a killer? No. Was I bitter? Yes. Did I enjoy seeing you guys squirm? Yes. And I can admit that. But I can admit that I was wrong, as well. Ivy, I know you're upset about Aly, and rightfully so. Look, you're grieving, and you're dealing with a lot of stuff, but you can't blame Liam and Steffy. Can you see how wrong that is?",
        "Ivy: All I can see is that Aly was alive one minute, and then the next, she was dead.",
        "Wyatt: But it was an accident! Ivy, you can't hold this over Steffy! We made a mistake, and now we have to fix it. And, Steffy, you're gonna give Ivy a second chance. You have to see that this is just a traumatizing experience for her, okay?! We have to delete this video! We do not need another tragedy.",
        "Ivy: A tragedy?!",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Steffy being held accountable for murdering someone isn't a tragedy, Wyatt! It's called \"justice\"!",
        "Wyatt: Steffy isn't a murderer! This is a horrible situation that was set in motion by Aly! Steffy was defending herself! She's actually a victim in this!",
        "Ivy: I can't accept that. She gets away with everything.",
        "Steffy: That's not true! [Voice breaking] We're family. You're my cousin. And Aly was my cousin, too, and I have to live with this for the rest of my life. I have to live with the knowledge. I have to carry this with me forever. I know you're upset with me for taking Aly away, but it was not intentional. And I did not take Liam away from you, so you cannot compare the two. I'm not a bad person. I don't know why you're trying to ruin my life, but this extortion, this blackmail -- that's not who you are.",
        "Wyatt: You say that you've been doing this for Aly, but have you even, like, thought about her?",
        "Ivy: Oh, Wyatt. Of course, I have.",
        "Wyatt: No. I'm talking about really, really thinking about Aly -- more importantly, what she stood for before she even lost her way, after she lost her way. Family, love, honesty, truth -- that's what she stood for. Steffy did not murder Aly! And I know that you believe that deep down somewhere. So just listen to her.",
        "Steffy: Aly plotted to kill me. She put a nail in my tire, and she waited for me to get a flat, and then she tried to run me over. She drove [Sniffles] She drove directly at me. I was trying to get through to her, but it was impossible. And she picked up a tire iron and -- and swung it, and when I was on the ground, she grabbed a rock.",
        "Ivy: I didn't see it.",
        "Steffy: But that's why the video is so dangerous. It doesn't show it on there. It's not the right angle. But I swear to you, she had a rock.",
        "Ivy: I-I didn't see it. I was her best friend, and she needed help. There was so much that... Wyatt, I didn't -- I didn't see it. [Crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: He already has you guys. He has RJ and now a baby? He can't start a new family now.",
        "Thomas: Dad wasn't sure if he could be a father again, but now he feels that he can.",
        "Brooke: Nothing's for certain.",
        "Ridge: When I was living in Paris, I knew I didn't want any more children.",
        "Brooke: So you had a vasectomy.",
        "Thomas: Trust me. I'm just as thrown as you are.",
        "Brooke: It's not even what he wants. He's already had his children. And he just told me how much he enjoys living in the moment.",
        "Thomas: This is so like him -- act first, think later. I mean, I should have known that he was gonna do something like this.",
        "Brooke: You were so right to be worried about Caroline, to want to protect her. That poor girl. After everything she's been through in the last 24 hours...",
        "Thomas: If I could turn back the clock...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I still can't believe you did that. We're starting a family together. I mean, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna be a mom. It's everything that I've wanted since I was really little, you know? I mean, I look forward to everything -- the little cheeks and the little fingers and... even the 3:00 a.m. feedings.",
        "Ridge: You give that some time.",
        "Caroline: No, I mean it. I look forward to all of it -- even poopy diapers.",
        "Ridge: Mm.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs] I don't know. It's just -- just raising another person and seeing them turn in to this tiny little human with their own personality and instilling...",
        "Ridge: [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: ...Morals and beliefs and just seeing their effect on the world.",
        "Ridge: Some people would find that daunting.",
        "Caroline: I don't. 'Cause I have you. And we're such a good team already.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Me too. There's a few things -- things, you know, procedures -- we've got to take care of before that, you know.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I do. I do. I -- we've got work, and so much going on right now. Within a year?",
        "Ridge: Definitely.",
        "Caroline: So, is this something -- one of the things -- that needs to be taken care of?",
        "Ridge: Well, it's -- I've been working on this for a while, and -- and I-I think -- I think it's gonna be pretty amazing, but I need -- I need your approval on it.",
        "Caroline: Since when do you need my approval on absolutely anything?",
        "Ridge: Just -- you've been through a lot. After my accident, you taught me how to design again.",
        "Caroline: After my accident, you taught me how to walk again.",
        "Ridge: Well... now we're gonna take another step. We're gonna have a family together, which is fantastic. But there's one more step I want to take before we -- before we do any of that. Lines, you know -- lines... that's what brought us together, and I think lines... are important, and I have -- I have one -- one more line I want to kind of run by you. You're my muse. You woke me up. And you gave me my life back, and now I don't want to live it without you. I love you, and I'm gonna love our child, and... don't ever question my commitment.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles, cries]",
        "Ridge: Caroline Spencer...",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God! Will you look at this thing?! It's huge!",
        "Ridge: Will you please just shut up...",
        "Caroline: [Giggles]",
        "Ridge: ...And marry me?",
        "Caroline: Yes! Aah! [Giggles] I still can't believe it. [Chuckles] It's beautiful.",
        "Ridge: You're beautiful.",
        "Caroline: No, you're beautiful.",
        "Ridge: I am beautiful.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs] I kind of, um -- I don't know. I just kind of -- I gave up on the idea of having kids. And I was okay with that. But... when you saw me... you saw that I might regret that one day. I really love you for that. You know me better than I know myself, and you've taught me so much about myself, too, and... I thought I lost you. Now you're gonna be my husband...",
        "Ridge: [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: ...And the father of my child.",
        "Ridge: Hey. You're all I need. This whole CEO thing and designing -- they can have all that back. I just want the most important thing, and that is your happiness. That goofy laugh you have that comes all the way from here. It's just -- mm.",
        "Caroline: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. The way you put your tongue right there when you think you want to make a point.",
        "Caroline: I don't do that.",
        "Ridge: You don't do that?",
        "Caroline: Maybe I do it.",
        "Ridge: You just did it.",
        "Caroline: I do -- [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Hey. I can't wait to start my life with you. I really can't.",
        "Caroline: I'd drink to that.",
        "Ridge: You would?",
        "Caroline: I would.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Break out the champagne! No champagne.",
        "Caroline: No?!",
        "Ridge: Beer!",
        "Caroline: Beer!",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles] [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: I don't want these. I want this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: She was my best friend. [Voice breaking] You know, maybe if I'd seen it sooner, she would still be alive.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is not your fault -- no one to blame here.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, I was so caught up with Rick, with his CEO thing, and the deportation saga, and I was trying to hold on to Liam.",
        "Wyatt: I-I know, but you got to cut yourself some slack here.",
        "Ivy: But I should have paid attention to Aly and my relationship. We all knew she had history, Wyatt. We knew that.",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Ivy: And we decided to ignore it? And we just called her \"crazy\" and she was being intolerant? She was sick. She was sick, and we missed it. I missed it.",
        "Wyatt: No. We all missed it. We all missed it, okay? We can't bring Aly back, but we can put an end to more hurt. We have to learn from this. This video will only do more harm than good.",
        "Ivy: Steffy... I know that you didn't intentionally kill Aly. You're not a murderer, and I'm so sorry. Wyatt, um...",
