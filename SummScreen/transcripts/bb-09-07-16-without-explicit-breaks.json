    "Recap": [
        "Pam is not sure how Ivy can come back and be here after all that happened. Ivy says it is in her blood, her family, her designing jewelry, it was what she was born to do. Pam scrunches her face and says she meant working with Quinn. Ivy remarks she really isn't that bad. Steffy walks in and is surprised to see Ivy. Ivy says she is a Forrester so why shouldn't she be here? Then Steffy realizes that she is here because of Quinn in helping her with the jewelry line. Wyatt tries to talk to his mother again about moving on and working anywhere but here at FC. She says Eric is CEO and he wants her here and in his house so Wyatt needs to accept that. He says Steffy will not accept her with Eric and will not live with him as long as Quinn is around. So he is not with his wife because of Quinn. No one, not Ridge, Steffy or Thomas wants her here. He is doing everything he can to keep in touch with Steffy and not lose her but he is not gaining any headway. He blames Quinn for sticking around and then Liam worming his way in at every opportunity. She says he will not lose Steffy. They will not let that happen. Liam finds Thomas working out and says he is looking for Steffy. He needs to talk to her again about cutting all ties with Quinn. Thomas knows that means also that Steffy will not be returning home to Wyatt. Liam says he doesn't want to hurt Wyatt either but he cannot cut his mother out of his life and Steffy cannot be around her so it is an impossible situation. Thomas says he can not reveal more now but they have a plan to get Quinn out of FC. Liam says Quinn is always up to something so he is not sure he can believe that but Thomas has his support 100% if the plan gets rid of Quinn. Steffy tells Ivy that she looks different. Ivy says yes she is working on Americanizing herself with a whole new look and accent. Steffy tells her if Quinn brought her back do not count on that long as Eric made a mistake hiring Quinn back and she is on her way out. Ivy retorts that she knows Quinn is a sore spot for Steffy so maybe that is why she is not with Wyatt, too bad as they have not been married that long. Quinn tells Ivy that she spoke with her uncle and Eric is happy to welcome her back on board at FC. Quinn says she is going to be Ivy's advocate and back her. She needs to be honest. She needs her help in helping to save her son's marriage. She needs Ivy to distract Liam and keep him away from Steffy. Wyatt joins Thomas at workout and asks if he has a minute. Things are a little strained still between he and Steffy. Thomas says that is really none of his business. Yeah, Thomas, then why keep telling Liam that you are all for him and Steffy to be together. Wyatt says he knows his mother causes drama wherever she goes so he gets why Thomas is so protective of his sister. He's talked to Quinn over and over about moving out of Eric's but it is like talking to a brick wall. Thomas says he knows but as long as she is living with his granddad it is as if she feels she is entitled. Wyatt says Eric is a grown man so he cannot tell him what to do. Eric brought Quinn back, not him. And now he feels like he is paying for it with his marriage on the line. There is a whole other factor here not just his mom, but Liam. Liam finds Steffy. She tells him he did not have to make up an excuse to come to FC to see her. He laments to her that he just saw Thomas and he alluded to the fact that they had a plan to get rid of Quinn. Steffy says yes but she does not want to jinx it but maybe they won't have to deal with her much longer. But besides her craziness she needs to warn him that now Ivy is back. He is flabbergasted because Quinn and Ivy hate each other ever since Quinn pushed her off the bridge. He comments to Steffy that he'd like her to come over tonight. He is not going to pressure her but just to hang out. And he would like her to know that he still wants a life with her whenever she is ready to make that decision.",
        "Ivy thinks Quinn is crazy to think that she can snap her fingers and make Liam forget Steffy, the woman he really loves. Quinn says then think about what Steffy is to men that makes them go wild. She is audacious, she's charming, a modern woman so Ivy needs to be a little more like that. Now Ivy sees it, the reason for this makeover to please Quinn but to please Liam too. Quinn says Steffy it out of the picture. She's Wyatt's wife so Liam needs someone to take his mind off of Steffy and he stop sniffing around. That is where Ivy comes in. She still cares for him a lot and Liam needs a new woman in his life. So Ivy can turn on the charm and flirt a little. Ivy says that may not be possible if he is always with Steffy. Quinn says absence makes the heart grow fonder. Ivy says not always. Quinn tells her she will not fail as she is going to guide her and be her life coach. At that moment Steffy and Liam are saying goodbye in the hallway and are in view of Quinn and Ivy. Ivy says Liam is still hung up on Steffy as they speak. Quinn assures her that does not matter; she belongs to Wyatt. She knows Ivy is not over Liam so she can get him back. It's easy, just keep Liam away from Steffy."

        "Pam: We sure have missed having you around, ms. Ivy.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: You think you're gonna stay for a while?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] If Eric says I can rejoin the design team.",
        "Pam: [Exhales sharply] I just -- I don't know how you do that.",
        "Ivy: Jewelry design is -- it's my life, it's in my blood. It's what I was born to do.",
        "Pam: No. I-I'm not talking about the design part. I'm talking about the working-with-Quinn part.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] She's really not that bad.",
        "Pam: [Scoffs] Not that bad? Are we talking about the same Quinn fuller?",
        "Steffy: Ivy? What are you doing here?",
        "Ivy: What? I'm a Forrester. Why shouldn't I be here?",
        "Pam: You know, I-I probably should get back to my desk. Hi, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Hey. So, what are you, like, here for a few days, or...?",
        "Ivy: Oh, hopefully longer. Quinn said she could find me some work on the jewelry line.",
        "Steffy: Quinn.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: You're here because of Quinn.",
        "Wyatt: Still here.",
        "Quinn: Well, where else would I be? I'm working! I'm running the jewelry line.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] For now.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] When are you gonna have a little faith in your mother?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I don't know. Maybe when you move out of Eric's place. Maybe when you take all of your stuff here and work on it someplace else -- anywhere other than Forrester creations?",
        "Quinn: Eric and I are together. He wants me in the house, and he wants me here.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, he might be the only one.",
        "Quinn: He's the C.E.O.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: And what he says, goes. And the sooner Steffy can accept that and accept that I'm not going anywhere, then we can all get on with our lives.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, Steffy has been very clear with you, okay? As long as you're around, she and I will not be living together, so we can't get on with our lives. My wife is gone because of you.",
        "Thomas: Liam. You're, uh -- you're a little overdressed for a workout.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Yeah, no, I'm actually here to see Steffy.",
        "Thomas: Oh. Not giving up with that, are we?",
        "Liam: I can't. Would you, in my shoes?",
        "Thomas: Probably not.",
        "Liam: I just -- I just got to get through to her, you know? I have to convince her to cut all ties with Quinn.",
        "Thomas: \"All ties\" -- that means ending her marriage with Wyatt.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Quinn is making Steffy's life hell, and it's gonna continue as long as she stays in that marriage.",
        "Thomas: Steffy made a commitment. She is not about to break Wyatt's heart.",
        "Liam: Listen, I'm not trying to hurt Wyatt, either, but Quinn is his mother. I mean, she's always gonna be around, and he's not willing to cut her out. He can't do it. He's been, like, her everything his whole life.",
        "Thomas: And now she has her claws dug into my grandfather.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, that's -- that's a whole other issue. I mean, even if Steffy ends things with Wyatt, Quinn is still at the office, she's still living with Eric, she's still a part of Steffy's life.",
        "Thomas: Maybe not for much longer.",
        "Liam: You know something I don't, tom?",
        "Thomas: I can't go into detail, but we've got a plan to get Quinn out.",
        "Quinn: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Look. Mom, I know that you like it here. I know that you're thrilled being with Eric and that you're the lady of the house and all that, but what you're doing -- it's not just affecting you. It's affecting a lot of other people.",
        "Quinn: Why? Why does it have to be such a negative thing?",
        "Wyatt: Steffy, ridge, Thomas. None of them want you here.",
        "Quinn: And it's a shame that they don't support Eric --",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Their father and their grandfather. After everything that he's done for them, it breaks my heart.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, they're never going to accept you. Steffy's never gonna be okay with you.",
        "Quinn: Well, at least Eric trusts me. And he appreciates having me around.",
        "Wyatt: And I don't doubt that. I don't. But you being here only makes it harder for me to get Steffy back.",
        "Steffy: You look different. Like, I'm almost positive I have this exact same outfit.",
        "Ivy: I needed a change.",
        "Steffy: And the way you're talking... what's going on with that?",
        "Ivy: Oh, I'm -- I'm trying to lose my accent. I'm just -- I want to Americanize myself.",
        "Steffy: Why?",
        "Ivy: Start of a whole new chapter -- here in L.A., Forrester creations.",
        "Steffy: If Quinn brought you back, I'm just gonna let you know, she's not gonna be here long.",
        "Ivy: Why not?",
        "Steffy: Granddad made a huge mistake hiring her back. But we're gonna manage to get her out.",
        "Ivy: Huh. Really not a fan of your mother-in-law.",
        "Steffy: I mean, after everything she's done? Really?",
        "Ivy: Quinn is obviously a sore spot for you. Is that why you separated from your husband?",
        "Wyatt: Everything was great between Steffy and me, until you interfered.",
        "Quinn: I did not interfere. I fell in love.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, Steffy doesn't quite see it that way, mom.",
        "Quinn: Well, maybe Steffy needs to adjust her attitude.",
        "Wyatt: As long as you are working here and sleeping with Eric, her opinion of you will not change.",
        "Quinn: Okay, I realize I've complicated things.",
        "Wyatt: Complicated? You've \"complicated things\"? Steffy moved out because of you. My wife is no longer living in our home because of you.",
        "Quinn: And I feel terrible about that, but... don't you think she's being a little overly dramatic?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my -- you can't just dismiss her feelings like that.",
        "Quinn: You can't dismiss mine, either!",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on!",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, look at me! I'm glowing! For the very first time in my life, I'm feeling joy!",
        "Wyatt: And I have never been more miserable.",
        "Quinn: I finally found a man who believes in me. A wonderful man who's given my career a second chance, who's given my entire life a second chance. And I have helped reinvigorate him, as well. I've given him much-needed attention and support. Wyatt. Eric and I are really, really good together. And I never wanted this to happen at your expense.",
        "Wyatt: I want you to be happy, mom. But not like this. Not Eric. Anyone else but Eric. Please. Come on.",
        "Quinn: I can't. I can't just undo this. There are undeniable feelings there, just like you have with Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you mean until you kind of screwed things up for us.",
        "Quinn: Are you two at least still talking?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, yeah. I mean, we talk, we text. I -- I see her every once in a while. I just -- the longer that she is away from home, the more distance there is between us.",
        "Quinn: You can't let that happen. You have to do everything you can to save your marriage.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, I am trying! She's my wife. I don't want to lose her! But then you -- you just -- you don't want to leave. You just keep -- you're adamant about sticking around. And then Liam -- I mean, he's trying to edge his way in every way he can, and he just --",
        "Quinn: Okay, listen to me. You are not going to lose Steffy. Do you hear me? Wyatt. We are not going to let that happen.",
        "Ivy: You and Wyatt haven't been married that long. You've already moved out?",
        "Steffy: It's complicated.",
        "Ivy: Hmm. Must be.",
        "Steffy: You know, it's not about Wyatt. It's about Quinn.",
        "Ivy: So this is has nothing to do with Liam and your feelings for him?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] All right, I won't -- I won't ask what the plan is, but if it means no more Quinn, you got my full support.",
        "Thomas: [Exhales sharply] Just hope it works.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, it better. Quinn can say that she's done scheming and manipulating, but I don't believe that, do you? She's always up to something.",
        "Quinn: Oh! Just the woman that I was hoping to run into. I have some great news for you.",
        "Ivy: You talked to uncle Eric?",
        "Quinn: I did. And I got his approval. Welcome back to Forrester creations.",
        "Ivy: [Australian accent] Oh, my god. That's great! He said it was all right?",
        "Quinn: Yes. Now, wait. The accent. You got to --",
        "Ivy: [American accent] Oh. Right. Sorry. I, uh -- I really, really appreciate this, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: I am really looking forward to working with you.",
        "Ivy: I know! I'm excited! I'm so lucky to have your support.",
        "Quinn: Well, I'm gonna be your advocate. I'm gonna back you. I am. I just -- [Clears throat] I have to be honest. I need something from you.",
        "Ivy: My loyalty.",
        "Quinn: Yes. Yes. That. I-I do, um... but I need your help. I need your help saving my son's marriage. I want you to distract Liam. I want you to keep him away from Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Hey. Uh, you got a minute?",
        "Thomas: Sure.",
        "Wyatt: Um, obviously things are a little strained still between Steffy and me.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, that's, uh -- that's none of my business.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but, I mean, you share some of the same concerns that Steffy does about my mom.",
        "Thomas: Can you blame me for that?",
        "Wyatt: No, I -- I get it. My mother's a divisive force. She creates drama wherever she goes, and I totally understand why you're being protective of your sister.",
        "Thomas: Steffy wants nothing to do with Quinn. She's afraid of her. She's afraid of what she's done in the past, and she's afraid of what she's gonna do in the future.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I-I've tried to get through to her, okay? I-I begged her to quit and to move out of Eric's. But it's like -- it's like talking to a brick wall.",
        "Thomas: As long as she's living with my grandfather, she's gonna feel entitled.",
        "Wyatt: But don't you think that's on Eric? He's a grown man. I can't tell him what to do. No one can. He's the one who brought her back, not me. He gave my mom her job back.",
        "Thomas: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. So then why do I feel like my marriage is on the line here? That I'm paying for it?",
        "Thomas: I don't envy your position, but it's like I said, man, that's --",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, it's between Steffy and me. I get it. I heard you. Only we both know that's not exactly the case here. 'Cause there's a whole other factor with my marriage, and it's not my mother. It's Liam.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Steffy: Liam. Hi.",
        "Liam: Pam said you were in here. I was actually gonna make up some kind of excuse, like I'm here on official Spencer business, but who am I kidding? I'm just here to see you.",
        "Steffy: You never need an excuse for that.",
        "Liam: Yeah. So... so, I was looking for you up in the sky lounge, and I-I ran into a guy with an eight-pack?",
        "Steffy: Oh, really? Was he, like, really, really tall and really, really sweaty?",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kind of looked like he's never had a carb his whole life?",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah, must be my brother.",
        "Liam: Thomas! Right.",
        "Steffy: Yes. Yes.",
        "Liam: That's his name. That's the guy. Yes. Um, so... so, in between reps...",
        "Steffy: Uh-huh.",
        "Liam: ...We're talking, like you do, uh, about this situation with Quinn.",
        "Steffy: [Groans] Yeah. My least-favorite subject. Great.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Thomas mentioned you guys might have a plan to get her out.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, we're -- we're working on something with my father. I don't -- I don't want to jinx it, but there's a chance we won't have to deal with Quinn much longer.",
        "Liam: Well, that'd be amazing.",
        "Steffy: Fingers crossed.",
        "Liam: Like I told Thomas, I mean, if you need anything, let me know.",
        "Steffy: Thank you. You've been incredible throughout this whole ordeal.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Yeah, well, I just don't want you to have to deal with her anymore.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Yeah. Me, too. Well, on top of all the Quinn craziness, guess what else is happening.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Steffy: Ivy. She's back.",
        "Ivy: Are you serious? You want me to distract Liam?",
        "Quinn: Spend some time with him. Keep his thoughts away from Steffy.",
        "Ivy: Quinn.",
        "Quinn: What? I'm assuming that you still have feelings for him.",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah, and I always will!",
        "Quinn: Then this should be easy for you. And it'll be good for you. It'll be good for Liam. H-he needs to stop thinking about Steffy.",
        "Ivy: Steffy's the one. She's the woman that Liam wants to be with.",
        "Quinn: Well, he can't have her. She's committed to Wyatt.",
        "Ivy: No, Steffy's not living with Wyatt anymore.",
        "Quinn: That's because of me. But we are gonna fix that.",
        "Ivy: How? I can't just snap my fingers and make him forget about Steffy.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, think about her, then. Think about Steffy. What is it about her that makes men go wild? She's audacious and she's charming. She's courageous. She's a modern woman. You need to be more like that.",
        "Ivy: So, the whole reason for this makeover was to make me look like Steffy.",
        "Quinn: Personally, I think you look fabulous.",
        "Ivy: Not my point, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Wyatt and Steffy are married. The only reason that they're having any sort of problems is because of me. I can't blame Steffy for being wary, but she never should have walked out on my son. And more importantly, Liam shouldn't be sniffing around. He should be keeping his distance.",
        "Ivy: That's where I come in.",
        "Quinn: Liam is lonely. He needs someone to take his mind off of Steffy. Don't you want to be that woman?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "Thomas: So you understand why Steffy's upset, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but come on, man. Moving out? Leaving our home? You even got to admit that's a little uncalled for.",
        "Thomas: You can't get a handle on Quinn. Steffy's got no choice but to defend herself in this situation.",
        "Wyatt: My marriage can't end because of my mother, all right? Steffy means way too much to me to let that happen. W-we both want this to work, and it will. As long as Liam stays away from my wife.",
        "Liam: Ivy's in town? Since when?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. A couple days now.",
        "Liam: I thought she was staying in Australia.",
        "Steffy: I thought so, too. But I guess Quinn wants her working back here at the company.",
        "Liam: Wait. Quinn? Quinn? But they hate each other.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. That's what I thought.",
        "Liam: Well, no, I mean, Quinn literally pushed her off of a bridge. I mean, she flipped out on her about breaking up with Wyatt, and now they're -- they're working together?",
        "Steffy: According to ivy. And considering Quinn's relationship with the C.E.O., I'm assuming that ivy plans on being a permanent fixture around here.",
        "Liam: Why would ivy do that? Why would she want to be around someone like Quinn?",
        "Ivy: You want me to win Liam back.",
        "Quinn: Turn on the charm. Flirt a little.",
        "Ivy: I mean, I want to, but I don't think that's possible. I'm sorry, Quinn, but I can't.",
        "Quinn: You -- no. Don't say \"can't.\" You can. And you will.",
        "Ivy: Last time I saw Liam, I poured my heart out to him, and he told me he just wanted to be with Steffy.",
        "Quinn: Oh, that was like a million years ago. Distance makes the heart grow fonder.",
        "Ivy: Uh, nope. Not always true.",
        "Quinn: How do you know if you don't try?",
        "Ivy: Maybe I don't want to risk rejection again.",
        "Quinn: You're not going to get rejected. Not this time. Not with me around. Because I'm here to help you. I am here to guide you and be like a life coach.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Remember how much I helped you when Liam married you during that whole citizenship fiasco?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, and look how well that turned out. I had my marriage annulled within days.",
        "Quinn: That's because you didn't listen to me. Liam would have stayed loyal to you if you had just followed my advice, but you didn't. You went rogue, and that's when everything fell apart. If you do everything I tell you to do this time, he will be yours.",
        "Liam: Well, I guess I better let you get back to work. I did see that stack of files on your desk.",
        "Steffy: Oh, that 10-foot pile over there? Yeah.",
        "Liam: 9 1/2. Don't exaggerate.",
        "Steffy: Hey. Very funny.",
        "Liam: Hey. Why don't you come over tonight?",
        "Steffy: Uh, I don't know if that's a good idea.",
        "Liam: Not to --",
        "Steffy: Liam, I don't --",
        "Liam: Just to talk. Maybe hang out. But --",
        "Steffy: Hmm.",
        "Liam: I just want you to know that despite Quinn and everything else that's happened, it's gonna be okay. And I know things are far from simple right now. It's confusing... but there is one thing that I'm clear about. I still want a life with you. You don't have to say anything. I'm not asking for that. I just want you to know that whenever you're ready... I'll be here.",
        "Ivy: What exactly are you asking me to do with Liam?",
        "Quinn: Steffy is married to my son.",
        "Quinn: Liam needs to respect that, and that's where you come in.",
        "Ivy: Obviously he's still hung up on Steffy.",
        "Quinn: It doesn't matter. She's not up for grabs. She belongs to Wyatt. And this shouldn't be that difficult. Liam is single. H-he's vulnerable.",
        "Ivy: I refuse to hurt him again. I'm not that kind of person.",
        "Quinn: Nobody's asking you to hurt him. You still care about him, don't you?",
        "Ivy: Yes, I -- I've never stopped thinking about him.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Then get him back.",
        "Ivy: Quinn --",
        "Quinn: No, listen.",
