        "Ridge: It suits you.",
        "Caroline: It's spectacular. Forget about the fact that it is probably the most flawless diamond ever. But you picked it out.",
        "Ridge: Well, I figured you could always exchange it if you don't like it.",
        "Caroline: No! I am never taking this ring off, ever.",
        "Ridge: It's not too late, you know. You could change your mind.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Ridge: I'm not the greatest catch. Old and blunt, impatient, in the morning, I'm --",
        "Caroline: Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Shut up. Stop talking.",
        "Ridge: [Grumbles]",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] You are the most wonderful man I've ever known. I love you. I can't wait to be your wife.",

        "Thomas: I would be really nice to you if you'd just let me show you.",
        "Caroline: Ridge?",
        "Thomas: We made love.",
        "Caroline: No! No, no, no, no, no, no!",
        "[Present time]",
        "Brooke: Good. You're still here.",
        "Thomas: Why are you?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I've been trying to make sense out of what you told me. Can you just help me out here? Okay. So, Ridge has been adamant about not having children with Caroline, and yet he goes out and he buys a bassinet.",
        "Thomas: He changed his mind.",
        "Brooke: It's not that simple.",
        "Thomas: I don't see what's complicated about it. Caroline wants a baby. Dad wants Caroline happy.",
        "Brooke: Okay, so go out and buy a piece of jewelry or take her on vacation or something! You don't just go and have another child. I mean, what was he thinking?",
        "Thomas: Well, maybe you should talk with him about it.",
        "Brooke: Maybe I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] You're awfully quiet.",
        "Ivy: Am I?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Your eyes kind of gave it away.",
        "Ivy: Mm.",
        "Wyatt: I'd look at them, and I just -- I know exactly what you're thinking.",
        "Ivy: Well, you think you'd be the only one, seeing as I've \"changed\" so dramatically.",
        "Wyatt: You have not changed.",
        "Ivy: Well...",
        "Wyatt: You just -- you got a little lost for a while. The pain of Aly's death, and... Liam treating you horribly.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: The video was a way for you to fight back, and you did, and trust me -- I get it.",
        "Ivy: Well, I just deleted all of that power.",
        "Wyatt: [Breathes deeply]",
        "Ivy: Do you know what really bugs me? Is I know that Steffy's not a murderer, but she's still responsible for killing Aly. And she's just gonna get away with that, Wyatt, and that video was the last way I could make her pay for that and --",
        "Wyatt: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You did the right thing, and I'm proud of you.",
        "Ivy: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Wait a second. Wait. This is for real?",
        "Steffy: Ivy deleted the master copy from all her devices.",
        "Liam: You saw this. You saw this with your own eyes, right?",
        "Steffy: Yes, yes, yes! And Wyatt witnessed it with me. Actually, he was more like the catalyst.",
        "Liam: So the threat is over. She can't blackmail you anymore.",
        "Steffy: It's over. It's over. It's finally over. It's finally over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] This is unreal. I mean, 'cause we tried everything we could think of with Ivy. There was just no way she was gonna delete it. What happened?",
        "Steffy: Wyatt. I got to give the guy credit. He was relentless. He told her that holding that video over me was wrong and that it was an accident, that it wasn't murder and that we should work it out as -- as a family.",
        "Liam: Well, obviously, he got through.",
        "Steffy: He pushed Ivy until the truth came out. She's dealing with a lot of guilt. She didn't notice that Aly was in trouble. I mean, they were cousins, yeah, but... they were best friends. And Aly went off the rails, and Ivy missed it. That's what was driving her. It wasn't the desire to get back at me. And when she realized that, that's when she deleted the video. He's the reason I can breathe again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I kind of need to hear you say it.",
        "Ivy: Say what?",
        "Wyatt: That deleting the video was the right thing to do.",
        "Ivy: Oh, well, Wyatt, it's just, you seemed so sure. Well, I did it, didn't I?",
        "Wyatt: I know. I just -- I just want to make sure that you're letting it go and you're moving past this -- I mean, for your sake and for everyone else's.",
        "Ivy: Look, I know that blackmailing Steffy doesn't benefit Aly in any way. And it diminishes who I am. So, yes. Deleting that video was the right thing to do.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Have you seen my phone?",
        "Caroline: Oh. Right here.",
        "Ridge: Oh, thank you. Got to call Thomas.",
        "Caroline: Why? He was just here.",
        "Ridge: Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Dad. What's up?",
        "Ridge: Can you come by the loft, please?",
        "Thomas: I was just there.",
        "Ridge: What difference does that make? Just come by here.",
        "Thomas: Okay, sure. Yeah, I'll be there.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Caroline: Why are you making him come back?",
        "Ridge: You'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Why did Ridge call you back to the loft so quickly?",
        "Thomas: I don't know. That is a lot of questions about dad, though.",
        "Brooke: Well, how did he sound?",
        "Thomas: Like dad.",
        "Brooke: No. I mean, did he sound urgent or casual, happy, sad?",
        "Thomas: He was up, energetic.",
        "Brooke: I wonder what's going on.",
        "Thomas: I have no idea. But if you're done with the interrogation, I could go and gather some intel.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Right. Sorry. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I have to admit, it's a relief.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Ivy: Carrying around the emotional weight of that video, it was almost too much power -- you know? -- Against the woman that I have deep anger for.",
        "Wyatt: Steffy didn't kill Aly.",
        "Ivy: No, not intentionally. But, Wyatt, Aly's gone. And Steffy just gets to live large. That's what drove me crazy, the fact that she can't accept responsibility for it. And I know -- I did things that I'm not particularly proud of.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, whoa. Don't knock it. Fierce Ivy was actually kind of sexy.",
        "Ivy: Come on. I think blackmailing my own cousin was taking it a step too far.",
        "Wyatt: But you stopped.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, that's because you stopped me.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Well, you know...",
        "Ivy: Is that something you do often -- you just walk around, saving women from themselves?",
        "Wyatt: Only when they really need it.",
        "Ivy: Well, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: It's been awful living under Ivy's thumb... constantly afraid that she might give this video to the police. Yeah, I just kept thinking, \"what if they don't believe me? What if... what if I go to prison?\" I would lose everything. I would lose you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, we wouldn't have let it get that far. I mean, really, we would've found some way to stop Ivy even if Wyatt hadn't.",
        "Steffy: Well, I'm just glad he came to our side.",
        "Liam: How did that go down, by the way?",
        "Steffy: Uh, I begged, I pleaded, I did anything I could to make him realize.",
        "Liam: And did he make it difficult?",
        "Steffy: He was torn. I mean, he wanted Ivy to delete the video. At the same time, he -- he was very loyal to her.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] My brother moves fast, I'll give him that.",
        "Steffy: Well, it worked. Ivy wouldn't have deleted the video if Wyatt hadn't convinced her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: So, why am I here? Again. You're not having second thoughts about me on the design team?",
        "Ridge: No, no, no. This is not about business. This is about as personal as it can get.",
        "Thomas: Okay.",
        "Ridge: I know you weren't crazy about Caroline and I being together.",
        "Thomas: It's nothing against you, Dad. I just didn't want to see her get hurt.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's, um... that's good. I know you guys had a connection. Caroline came to L.A., and I know you're taking care of her. You want her to be all right.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, admittedly, I had my doubts. But you really stepped up. You're committing to having the family that she's always wanted. You guys are on a roll. Don't let anything stop that.",
        "Caroline: I don't intend to.",
        "Ridge: I'm glad you turned the corner, because we need people to kind of be on our side, stand with us.",
        "Thomas: For what?",
        "Ridge: We're getting married. And I want you to be my best man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: You're getting married.",
        "Ridge: I know! It's all going pretty fast, I know, but sometimes you got to go with it, go with the momentum, right?",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm. Absolutely.",
        "Ridge: We're gonna have a baby, and -- and getting married just makes perfect sense.",
        "Thomas: Wow. Wow. That's great. That's really great.",
        "Ridge: I don't want anyone standing next to me but you. So what do you say?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, Dad. Yeah, absolutely. I -- I would be honored.",
        "Ridge: [Laughs] Oh, thank you. You just made an excellent day a perfect day. Okay. I got to go. I'll be back.",
        "Caroline: When you walked in, I just completely froze, and I couldn't speak.",
        "Thomas: You were fine. He's on his own track, anyways.",
        "Caroline: I mean, asking you to be his best man?",
        "Thomas: How are you with that, by the way?",
        "Caroline: You couldn't say no?",
        "Thomas: Congratulations, by the way, or -- or good luck.",
        "Caroline: Fine. I'll take either one. Just...as long as you mean it.",
        "Thomas: It's exactly like I've told my dad. I've only ever wanted to see you happy.",
        "Caroline: I am. And I will be, just as long as he never finds out. This will ruin everything, Thomas. And not just for me. For you, too. 'Cause he will never forgive you if he finds out what happened the other night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I've been so focused on Ivy and the video, I... I haven't had time to really mourn Aly.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Uh... still doesn't really feel real. I mean, Aly spent so much time in Paris, and she wasn't around a lot. It -- it feels like she could just...walk through the door any minute.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but that's... that's not gonna happen.",
        "Liam: I know, and it's not your fault.",
        "Steffy: Just... I wish I got in the car with you that night when we went to my grandfather's. I wish I didn't take my car, and I look back at it --",
        "Liam: I know, I know. I know. But... maybe -- maybe this can let us move on. 'Cause Aly's not coming back. She's not walking through any doors. And... I think it's time we let her go. I just, uh... I just -- I'm sorry. I just -- I got to make sure.",
        "[Ringing]",
        "Wyatt: Liam.",
        "Liam: Hey, man. Ivy with you?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. She's right here.",
        "Liam: Can you put me on speaker?",
        "Wyatt: Okay...",
        "Liam: Ivy?",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Liam: Hey. Uh, Steffy...told me that Wyatt convinced you to delete all the copies of the video.",
        "Wyatt: I did, yeah.",
        "Liam: Thank you for that.",
        "Wyatt: It was the right thing to do.",
        "Liam: So this is really done. The video is gone.",
        "Ivy: Yes. Yes, Liam. The video is deleted. No other copies exist anymore.",
        "Liam: That's great. That's -- that's really great. Thank you. But what I need now, from both of you, is a promise -- that we never speak of this again. What happened that night on that roadside, it was a terrible, terrible accident. And it stays buried forever. We all agreed?",
        "Wyatt: Agreed.",
        "Steffy: I agree.",
        "Ivy: Buried forever.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You've been incredible.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: You've given me just what I've needed exactly when I've needed it. You haven't judged me. You've just supported me. You made me realize that I shouldn't be focusing on the past or hanging on to anger and resentment.",
        "Wyatt: Aly wouldn't have wanted that for you.",
        "Ivy: No. So, it's a new chapter for me and for us.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, I like the sound of that.",
        "Ivy: From this day on, I'm only gonna be focusing on the future.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Ivy: Okay?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: And all the fun times we're gonna have.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: As long as you plan on sticking around.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I'll be around.",
        "Ivy: Good answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You know what else I haven't paid much attention to lately?",
        "Liam: Um...me?",
        "Steffy: Oh, poor baby. You feel neglected?",
        "Liam: I feel...incredibly lucky to be with you. Steffy and Liam's grand adventure, part 2. Or is it part 3? Part 2? I don't know.",
        "Steffy: No, it's forever.",
        "Liam: You are where I belong.",
        "Steffy: Liam, I'm so grateful for you. This would've been unbearable. But I knew, at the end of the day, you'd be here.",
        "Liam: Always. Hey, this is a new beginning for us. So, from here on out, no old baggage, right? No regrets. Deal?",
        "Steffy: Seal it with a kiss?",
        "Liam: Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Brooke's flashback]",
        "Ridge: When I was living in Paris, I knew I didn't want any more children.",
        "Brooke: So you had a vasectomy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Are you sure that that's how it happened the other night? Because I still can't remember.",
        "Thomas: Yes. And I'm sorry, but I did not take advantage of you. I'm not that guy, and you know that.",
        "Caroline: It's just -- it's confusing, because I would never do something like that. I would never betray Ridge and especially not with you.",
        "Thomas: You broke up. I thought you were done. I thought you wanted me.",
        "Caroline: That's the last thing that I wanted!",
        "Thomas: That was not clear, Caroline. Especially from the way that you were looking at me that night.",
        "Caroline: Thomas! I told you I had taken pills!",
        "Thomas: I didn't know that! I didn't! I was drunk! A-and I would never... okay, okay. Here's what I thought happened. You and dad were over. We made love. And I held you in my arms until we both fell asleep. You were content. You were at peace. And I thought... I thought that you were mine. Obviously, I was wrong. But you have to know, that is where my head was at. Nowhere else. Caroline, you know me. Do you -- do you honestly think I would ever do something so horrible?",
        "Caroline: No.",
        "Thomas: Thank you.",
        "Caroline: Okay, so... moving forward -- and it's the only way that we can move forward -- Ridge can never know. That night, it didn't happen. Okay? Because he and I are gonna be happy, and we're gonna get married, and we're gonna start a family, and it's everything that I ever wanted.",
        "Thomas: You don't have to worry. I have never wanted to hurt you.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Ridge: And he's back.",
        "Caroline: Back! You're back.",
        "Ridge: Corner-store magic. Hi.",
        "Caroline: Hey.",
        "Caroline: Why are you crying? What's going on here? What happened?",
        "Thomas: Uh, it was...just a little thing.",
        "Caroline: No, it's me, it's me. Ugh. I'm...emotional because of everything. There's so much going on.",
        "Ridge: Are we moving too fast? Is it -- is it too fast?",
        "Caroline: No, no. No, no. No, it's really good.",
        "Ridge: 'Cause you get it, right? I'm not good at waiting, and I don't want to wait. I don't want to waste any time. I want to start the party right now. Glasses. Here we go."
