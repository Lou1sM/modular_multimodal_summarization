        "Quinn and Ivy whisper that it will be hard to get Steffy and Liam apart but she gave her this new look and she needs Ivy's help to get Liam to move on. She knows she loves that man so help him stay away from Steffy. Wyatt is Steffy's victim. She tries to convince Ivy that she can get him back, just work it. Thomas tells Wyatt that he never has seen him so stressed out like this. Wyatt opines that he can't help it. This is something he cannot fix. The only thing to help will get Steffy back home where she belongs. Thomas says he knows his sister and this may take a while. He is not insensitive to what Wyatt is going through but he doesn't know what he can do. Wyatt says maybe nothing but he can tell Liam that he is not going to relinquish the title of husband any time soon. Quinn steps out in the hallway and shouts to Liam that look who is back. He asks Ivy how long she is going to be here and she says that depends but Quinn has asked her to work with her .so she is working it. He tells Ivy that he cares about her and she needs to know to watch her back around Quinn. Steffy tells Quinn that it is surprising that she went to bat for Ivy. And she warns Quinn that she is not a permanent fixture around here and will be gone soon. Quinn says it is completely unfair of her to continuously punish Wyatt for whatever Steffy thinks Quinn has done to her and her family. She says for the hundredth time that she has changed yet no one will give her that chance. Quinn tells her maybe she can change her focus. Go home to her husband and focus on him.",
        "Wyatt tells Thomas that he can not underestimate Liam. He is going full out and making it clear that he wants Steffy back. Ivy and Liam talk about old times, even Amsterdam. She says she is making some changes to help her adapt. She wants to change her accent and wants to be more assertive here in L.A. He says she never should have left L.A. in the first place but he is glad she is back. She wants to know why things are so complicated with Quinn. He gives the same old story that he and Steffy would be married if Quinn had not kidnapped him. Quinn's plan worked to keep Liam away and give Wyatt a chance to get Steffy. He says that is his point. Quinn says she is a changed person but she has always been a nut job. And now she is living with Eric. So work with Quinn but for God's sake do not trust her or turn her back on her. Before she will let him go she comes forward and gives him a big kiss. Steffy tells Quinn that she loves Wyatt but Quinn's ends do not justify the means and she has a twisted way of seeing things and that will never change. Quinn begs her to see her as she is now. Just come to the house and see how she and Eric are good for each other. Steffy says no she will not be doing that. Steffy says she does not have to put an act on for her. Just tell the truth of why she is doing all of this. Quinn says this was not part of some master plan; falling in love with Eric just happened. It is real and it hurts Eric to know that his family will not accept her. Quinn says she can stay away from Wyatt and Steffy and all will be okay. Steffy says no, she has told her several times to stay away from her family and she could not do that. Quinn has to pack up and leave FC and Eric and go somewhere else."

        "Quinn: Look at them. Right there. Where everyone can see. Steffy is married to my son. She shouldn't be draped all over Liam like that.",
        "Ivy: Those two don't break easily. Trust me, I know.",
        "Quinn: I know, but... Steffy is committed to Wyatt. When they got married, she became his whole world, and she's disrespecting him. Not just him but the vows that they made. You said you would be loyal to me, right?",
        "Ivy: I meant it.",
        "Quinn: Okay, well, you owe me. I got you rehired back here at Forrester. I-I gave you this hot new look that's gonna serve you well.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, I don't know if this fits me. I --",
        "Quinn: It's going to be great. You got to get used to it. In the meantime, you need to help out my son. We need to get Steffy to do the right thing, we need to get Liam to move on, but most of all, Ivy, help yourself out. You still love that man. You can have him back if you want to. You just need to get in there and fight for what you want.",
        "[Steffy laughs]",
        "Thomas: I've never seen you like this, man.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] How's that?",
        "Thomas: Stressed out, anxious, you know?",
        "Wyatt: Could you blame me? My wife's moving out because I can't control my mother.",
        "Thomas: I don't envy your position at all.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, it feels like everything that's important to me is just -- it's just slipping away, and it doesn't matter what I do or how hard I try, I can't -- I can't just -- I can't seem to fix it.",
        "Thomas: Do you want to join me, work out a little bit, get out some of that excess tension that's going on right there?",
        "Wyatt: The only thing that's good for me is getting Steffy back home where she belongs.",
        "Thomas: I'm not trying to be a downer, but I know my sister, and it takes her a while to build up to an ultimatum, but once she's there, she does not back down.",
        "Wyatt: So, what are you saying? You're saying I should go to the courthouse and file divorce papers, is that it?",
        "Thomas: Quinn's an issue, Wyatt. And it's not easily resolved since she's living with my grandfather, which, by the way, nobody likes. Quinn is a problem, Wyatt, and not just for Steffy. For our whole family.",
        "Quinn: Come on, Ivy. It's not like I'm asking you to do something morally questionable. Steffy's a married woman. She shouldn't be looking at another man like that. On the other hand, you and Liam are single. You can be with whomever you choose, so why not choose to be with each other? You guys have a history together. Look, you'd be doing Wyatt a huge favor. He doesn't deserve to be made a fool of, does he? And he doesn't deserve to lose Steffy, not because she has a problem with me. He's a victim. Wyatt is Steffy's victim, and you have experience with that, right? You still love Liam?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Always will.",
        "Quinn: Okay, well, then, get in his face. Spend some time with him. Remind him of your history together, you know? You can get him back. You can do it. You just -- you just need to work it a little -- what do you say? Okay. Hey, Steffy. Liam. Guess who's back.",
        "Liam: Ivy. Hi.",
        "Ivy: I don't look that different.",
        "Liam: No, I, um -- it's good to see you.",
        "Ivy: You, too.",
        "Liam: How long are you in town?",
        "Ivy: Uh, indefinitely. I'm officially back at work, though.",
        "Liam: Oh. Congratulations.",
        "Steffy: Yep. It's all because of Quinn. Convinced my grandfather to bring Ivy back.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Well, I mean, it wasn't that hard. Eric was more than happy to have her back at Forrester, and me, too, you know? Ivy's gonna be a really big help to me.",
        "Ivy: Well, that's the plan. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Okay, that right there. I knew something sounded different. What happened to your Aussie accent?",
        "Ivy: Oh, it -- that's part of the plan, too. I -- I'm just making some personal changes, trying to reinvent myself. Make this time here in L.A. Much better than the last one.",
        "Quinn: You just need to know how to work it.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas: I feel for you, Wyatt. It's got to be tough being stuck between your wife and your mom.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Thanks, man.",
        "Thomas: I'm not insensitive to what you're going through. I'm just not sure what I can do because I'm on the side that gets rid of Quinn, but I get it. I get that you're in a challenging place.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, Steffy and I were great. Our marriage was great. The marriage that my mom wanted so badly, she took Liam out of his life to make sure that it happened. But instead of respecting Steffy and respecting her wishes, even just giving me, like, a little bit of time to convince Steffy to be on board. Like, she blatantly goes after Eric to get her job back, and now she's living with the guy.",
        "Thomas: That's where I get stuck -- right there. That's it. You know, that woman went out of her way to get you and Steffy together.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and then Liam -- there's Liam. He's just sniffing around my wife, and -- I mean, talk about screwed up, man.",
        "Thomas: Well, you can't be surprised that Liam's doing that. He's never given up on Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, he needs to focus on his own life and move on. Let go of the thought that Steffy's ever coming back to him because I am her husband, and I am not about to relinquish that title anytime soon.",
        "Ivy: You, uh -- you seem confused.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, surprised, in any case, that Steffy would agree to speak to Quinn privately.",
        "Ivy: Maybe the ice is melting.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I can say with all confidence that is -- that is not happening. Look at you. You're -- wow. You're back.",
        "Ivy: Yes. I am.",
        "Liam: And you're working with Quinn.",
        "Ivy: Jewelry design is where I belong. Does it bother you?",
        "Liam: Everything about Quinn bothers me. Ivy, listen, are you sure you want to be working with her again?",
        "Ivy: It's time I get my rightful place back here at Forrester. Quinn just comes with the package.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, she managed that nicely. Just -- do me a favor and watch your back, okay? 'Cause Quinn's not exactly trustworthy.",
        "Ivy: Haven't you noticed that I'm a big girl? I can look after myself. But thank you. It's very nice you still have my back.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well -- yeah. I'm sorry, but I care about you. I know things got a little -- a little weird at the end there, but... we were close, and I missed you, and...",
        "Ivy: Uh...",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Ivy: I-I didn't get that. Can you -- can you repeat it? You...?",
        "Liam: I -- I -- I missed you.",
        "Steffy: So, you went to bat for Ivy.",
        "Quinn: Surprised?",
        "Steffy: Maybe a little.",
        "Quinn: She's a talented designer, she's easy to work with, she's a Forrester -- why wouldn't I want her around?",
        "Steffy: So, you just go to my grandfather, and like magic, it's done, huh?",
        "Quinn: Do you have a problem with Ivy being back?",
        "Steffy: No. I have a problem with you. But not for long.",
        "Quinn: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Steffy: You're not a permanent fixture around here. You'll be gone soon enough.",
        "Quinn: I get it. You don't like me, don't trust me, have no use for me. You know what? It's okay. You just -- you just keep heaping all your animosity on me. It's fine, I can take it. But it is completely unfair for you to continue punishing Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: I've made mistakes.",
        "Steffy: Mistakes? You've committed crimes.",
        "Quinn: Whatever you want to say about me, whatever you want to accuse me of, I regret all of it. But I'm trying to make up for it now by being a better person, and it's working because I've changed.",
        "Steffy: People like you don't change. You evolve. You get better at being wrong. I see you for exactly who you are -- total disregard for people, using people to get what you want, and now you're targeting my grandfather. Enjoy him while you can.",
        "Quinn: I intend to. Because I know how incredibly lucky I am to have him. Maybe, just maybe, you can switch your focus. Stop dwelling on my past mistakes, stop making Wyatt pay for them. You're married, Steffy. \"For better or for worse.\" So go home to your husband.",
        "Thomas: You know, underneath all the bravado and even behind all of our chaotic history --",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Thomas: I feel bad for you.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks, man.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: I just don't -- I got to figure out what to do with my mother. I mean, she -- she's doing a fantastic job of single-handedly ruining my marriage.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: And then there's Liam. I'd be an idiot to underestimate him 'cause he's just -- he's going full-out. Every time I see her, he's there. He's just -- he's always around.",
        "Thomas: Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Steffy wouldn't cheat on you. That's it.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] I-I know that. I'm not paranoid. But the longer Steffy's away from home, the more it doesn't bode well for the state of my marriage. Especially with Liam just making it very clear that he wants her back. I mean, there's millions of women in L.A. Millions of 'em! Why can't he find one of his own?",
        "Ivy: It's nice knowing you missed me.",
        "Liam: Well, yeah, I mean, we had a lot of fun together.",
        "Ivy: The best.",
        "Liam: The best memories I shan't forget.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, me, either. Amsterdam.",
        "Liam: Yeah, like that.",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Ivy: Is that good or bad?",
        "Liam: It's good! I'm sorry. It's good. It's definitely good. It's just -- it's, uh... it's different. With the look and the accent, or lack thereof, or --",
        "Ivy: Like I said, I'm just -- I'm just dialing it down, you know. I don't want to be the long-lost Forrester anymore from \"down under.\"",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Ivy: I'm just -- I don't know. I'm just making changes to kind of reflect my new attitude.",
        "Liam: Your -- which is what?",
        "Ivy: To be more assertive -- here in L.A., My family, getting my job back. You.",
        "Liam: Ivy, I'm so glad you're back, and you shouldn't have left in the first place, by the way. I felt really bad about that. But --",
        "Ivy: But there's Steffy. Always Steffy. Liam, she's married to Wyatt. Why do you want to interfere with that?",
        "Liam: It's not -- it's not that simple.",
        "Ivy: How is it complicated?",
        "Liam: Uh, Quinn, actually.",
        "Ivy: Quinn?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Steffy and Wyatt wouldn't be married if it weren't for her, so...",
        "Ivy: Don't you think this all-powerful perception of Quinn is a little over- the-top?",
        "Liam: Ivy, have you -- have you forgotten who Quinn is? You know, Quinn, who, like, pushed you off a bridge into the seine?",
        "Ivy: Kick-started some of the best days of my life? It's a bit hard to stay mad at that.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Yeah, well, maybe you'd be more forgiving if she didn't kidnap you.",
        "Ivy: Kidnap?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Uh, spare you the gory details, but bottom line, she held me hostage in a cabin.",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Liam: Oh, you didn't hear about that.",
        "Ivy: Actually, I do remember Steffy saying she was looking for you, but this is when she and Wyatt got engaged.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's 'cause Quinn's plan worked. She kept me away from Steffy long enough for Wyatt to make his move on her. Their entire marriage is based on a false assumption because -- oh, by the way, I didn't mention this -- Quinn was texting Steffy as me saying that I never wanted to see her again, so...",
        "Ivy: I -- [Laughs] I don't even know how to respond to that.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, Quinn's a nutjob, Ivy. That's my point. I mean, she can say that she's a changed woman. She can say that this great love for Eric has turned her into a different person.",
        "Ivy: Do you think she's using my uncle?",
        "Liam: Yes, I -- yes, absolutely, she is. Steffy told Quinn again and again and again -- \"stay away from me and my family.\" What did Quinn do? She went over Steffy's head. Which, apparently, that was a good move because she's back at Forrester, she's living it up in the mansion with Eric. I'm just -- I'm just saying -- work with Quinn if you have to. But don't turn your back on her, and for God's sake, don't trust her.",
        "Ivy: You're looking out for me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I care about you. I always will. Uh... well, it was great seeing you. I got to go.",
        "Ivy: Mm. Liam, wait.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Just -- one more thing.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: I'm not punishing Wyatt. Do you think it was easy for me to leave our home?",
        "Quinn: I don't know. You don't seem to be having a very difficult time with it.",
        "Steffy: Proves how little you know me.",
        "Quinn: I'm trying to fix that.",
        "Steffy: I love Wyatt. And that's why I married him. But your manipulations helped put us on that beach.",
        "Quinn: And I don't understand what was so wrong about that. I mean, I understand. I understand that what I did was wrong, but you and Wyatt, you're so good together. You were happy.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. You are unbelievable. The end doesn't justify the means. You stole a man out of his life.",
        "Quinn: And I apologized for that.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. You know, you have such a twisted way of seeing things, and that's never gonna change. You're never gonna change.",
        "Quinn: Yes. Yes, I have. If you can just ignore the past and see me for who I am now.",
        "Steffy: A calculating gold digger who seduced my vulnerable grandfather.",
        "Quinn: That's not the way it happened at all, Steffy. I wish you would just come to the house and spend some time with me and Eric, see who we are as a couple. See how good we are together. I-I'm good with Eric, and Eric is so good with me.",
        "Steffy: No, I won't be doing that.",
        "Quinn: Well, maybe you'll reconsider in time.",
        "Steffy: I won't have to. Quinn, can't you just be honest? It's just us. You don't have to put an act on for Wyatt or my grandfather. Just tell me the truth. What you did to Liam, using my grandfather. Is that -- is that directed at me?",
        "Quinn: Of course not. Why would I even do that?",
        "Steffy: Because I pushed you out of our lives, I told you to stay away from me and my family. Maybe you wanted to get back at me.",
        "Quinn: Steffy. I love you. I want us to be good. I want you and Wyatt to be happy with each other. Falling in love with your grandfather wasn't part of some master plan. It just happened.",
        "Steffy: Fine. Well, like I told you before, this isn't gonna be some long-term commitment. Yeah, he's infatuated with you right now, but that's because he's lonely and you're targeting him. So whatever you think this is is really just a miscalculation at your son's expense.",
        "Quinn: I understand that you need to believe that. But what Eric and I have is real, and it hurts him so much that you won't accept us.",
        "Steffy: Then leave. If you love him, and if this is hurting him, then make a sacrifice. Take yourself out of the picture.",
        "Quinn: What if we come up with a compromise, okay? I will stay away from you and Wyatt, 100%, and you go back to your husband.",
        "Steffy: Throw my grandfather in the mix and you have yourself a deal. That's my one condition.",
        "Quinn: I tried doing that before. It didn't work.",
        "Steffy: Well, then try harder. I thought Wyatt's happiness meant everything to you.",
        "Quinn: It does.",
        "Steffy: Then listen to me. Get your bags, move out of my grandfather's house, leave Forrester, and never come back.",
        "Quinn: That's an impossible choice. You're not being fair.",
        "Steffy: You want to talk to me about being fair? I told you to stay away from me and my family, and now you're more involved than ever. Look, I want you gone. I want you away from my grandfather, out of my life. It's -- it's the only way Wyatt and I will have a chance of working things out. You love your son and you want him to have a solid marriage. So leave my grandfather."
