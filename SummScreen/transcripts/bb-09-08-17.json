{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7668 ~ Nicole confronts Maya about her idea for Zende to be promoted within Forrester Creations; Brooke attempts to stand by her man, even though Bill will not divulge what is weighing on his mind."], "Recap": ["Steffy tells Sally to please keep her designs. They are really good but they are hers and Sally does not owe her anything. Sally says Steffy will not take this as a compliment but they are both a lot alike, being two badass girls. Only Steffy's paid off and hers didn't. She starts to leave and Steffy calls her back and thanks her for the designs. Maya and Rick introduce the idea of Zende and Nicole going to Paris in the International office to the Avants. Maya admits it was her idea after Rick praised Zende's designs and then there was an opening in that office. Viv asks isn't that where Sasha is modeling now. Zende speaks up and says he made mistakes but he is not stupid. Nicole is the only woman for him. Nicole wonders if it is more than that for Maya. Does it have anything to do with her almost not wanting to sign the adoption papers. Maya assures them this has nothing to do with that difficult time. Julius only wants to be sure this is okay with Nicole. Nicole says she knows it is a wonderful opportunity but she would miss all of them. But in the end Zende thinks it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity for him to be a designer and he looks to Nicole to accept it with him and she agrees. Liam tells Steffy that tomorrow morning there will be a letter of resignation from Bill on this desk .this desk which is now his desk. Steffy says that is never going to happen. Bill will never give this up. Liam says he will or be arrested.", "Brooke gives Bill a neck and shoulder massage but it does not help his grumpy mood. She brings up the fire and Bill does not want to talk about the fire or Spectra. She wants to know why he is so upset. Steffy is not so sure that Liam will send his own father to prison. He says he is counting on that. Bill will not let it go that far. Now he will get his chance and the power over his father and that is exactly what he is going to do. He will take Spencer Publications into a whole new future. Sally has lunch with CJ to say her goodbye. She feels she has no reason to stay in L.A. Nicole says this all makes her head spin just thinking about Paris. Zende says he knows it will be hard leaving her family, especially Lizzy, but this will be a time they will never forget. Liam says he has been wanting to make a change in the company for a long time, better times for the employees for one thing. His dad had a lot of bad policies. He points to the Tower and says his dad will not be doing that now. He does not need the property with a charred building. Steffy says she knows Liam can run the business and be good at it he feels a but coming. She says yes. She does not care about the company right now; she does not want to see him ruin his relationship with his father. Brooke wants to know what Bill is thinking; he can tell her anything. Finally he says he is thinking of taking some time off. He wants to get away with her. She asks about SP and he says he has two sons and one of them is President so it will be in good hands. Brooke is dubious and wants to know the real truth. Liam tells Steffy this has gone on too long. Enough is enough with the lies."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: You want more transparency? Is that it? Okay. I'll give it to you. I told justin to get someone to set fire to spectra fashions so I could build spencer tower! That's it! Are you satisfied? Are you happy now? I did it! You recorded our private conversation?", "Liam: You went too far, dad. It's criminal activity, and it stops now. You will step down, and you will take not only a leave of absence, but a long, hard look at yourself. You're gonna have a memo on my desk tomorrow morning announcing that you are stepping down effective immediately. Steffy, here's your proofs.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Thank you very much. You're very welcome.", "Steffy: Sorry to keep you waiting.", "Sally: It's all good. Got nowhere to be.", "Steffy: So, you're really leaving town?", "Sally: That's the plan.", "Steffy: Please, can you just -- please, keep your designs?", "Sally: Their yours.", "Steffy: No, they're -- they're yours. And they're really good.", "Sally: I...really have no use for them. Plus, I owe you, princess.", "Steffy: You do not owe me anything.", "Sally: I don't even know how you can say that after everything that I've done. I almost feel like I deserve everything that happened to me. And my company.", "Steffy: No, you definitely did not deserve that, sally.", "Sally: You know, I know you're not gonna take this as a compliment... but you and I are actually a lot alike. Two toughies. Like your grandmother and my great-aunt. Only difference is, your badass ways pay off, and mine don'T. I had it all. A new era at spectra, a guy i adored. It all came so quickly. And it disappeared even quicker. [ Cellphone chirps ] Guess i do have somewhere to be. C.J. Wants to see me.", "Steffy: Sally? Wait. Thank you for these.", "Sally: Goodbye, princess.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: Paris?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: The forrester international office.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: It's a great opportunity for zende. He gets to work with our european design team.", "Maya: Yeah, and, nicole, think about it. Life in paris? It's one of the most romantic cities in the world, in my opinion.", "Julius: Well, I know that you and rick loved it there.", "Ridge: Well, that's probably why they came up with it.", "Nicole: Wait. This was your idea?", "Maya: Yes. Yes, I suggested the move, actually. Ridge was so positive about zende's designs, and then it dawned on me that there is a position opening up in international and that it would be an amazing opportunity for both of you. Nicole, you can assist with the pr department there.", "Ridge: We've all worked at international. There's a lot to learn from our european colleagues.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: I hate to bring this up, but isn't that where sasha is modeling?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Yeah. Look, I may have made mistakes, but I'm not stupid. I know what I have right here, and I love this woman more than anything.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: Nicole. How are you feeling about this?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I mean -- [ Sighs ] It all came about so suddenly. But I have to ask... is there more to this, maya?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Hi, honey! How was your day?", "Bill: From hell.", "Brooke: Oh, no. The deal with the indonesian firm?", "Bill: Oh, no, no, no. That was a breeze.", "Brooke: Well, then, what?", "Bill: Employees have no freaking idea what it takes to build an empire.", "Brooke: Did you educate them?", "Bill: Tried. But the lack of gratitude and common business sense is blinding. You don't get ahead playing by the rules. You make the rules. And when necessary, you break the rules.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Hi. Got your text. I tried your office first. What's wrong? What happened?", "Liam: End of an era.", "Steffy: O...kay. What do you mean?", "Liam: Tomorrow morning, there will be a letter of resignation on this desk, which is now my desk, saying that my dad is stepping down from spencer publications.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: More to what, nicole?", "Nicole: This move you suggested for zende. And me, of course.", "Maya: Like ridge, I thought it was...an incredible opportunity for both of you. The adventure of a lifetime, really.", "Nicole: But...you didn't even discuss it with me. Or zende, for that matter.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: She cleared it with rick and me first.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: Well, obviously, there's something bothering you, honey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: Yes, what is it, nicole?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: The adoption papers.", "Zende: What about them?", "Nicole: Are you still upset with me because I almost didn't sign them?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "C.J.: You set? I cannot tell you what a relief it is to see you out and about. I'm so glad you came. And I am so glad you are doing better, cuz.", "Sally: It's gonna take a lot more than some smoke to put me under.", "C.J.: Come on. You do realize it could've been a lot worse.", "Sally: Could it? I lost everything, C.J. If those designs had made it out onto the runway, spectra fashions could've been a part of the L.A. Fashion world. Those dreams are gone. My big moment went up in flames. All because of some freak accident.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I had it right in the palm of my hand.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Well, then, you're gonna just have to grab it again. Whatever \"it\" is. [ Sighing ] Oh, come here. My goodness, you are so tense. What is it? This little setback at work? It can't be that bad. You still have me. And you still have sky -- your big, beautiful skyscraper, which is soon gonna tower over everything in los angeles. And those big, smoky windows and your mirrors and your C.E.O. Desk and y--", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: You actually said that to your father?", "Liam: Yeah, well, he had it coming.", "Steffy: How did he react?", "Liam: Like the tough guy he is -- threatening me, yelling at me, you know.", "Steffy: So, you stood your ground.", "Liam: Yeah. I did. He's got 'til 9:00 am tomorrow to hand me his letter of resignation.", "Steffy: He will never do that. Spencer publications is bill spencer. He's never gonna give this up.", "Liam: Well, either he hands this company over to me or i hand him over to the police.", "Steffy: You actually blackmailed your father.", "Liam: I'm righting a wrong, steffy.", "Steffy: You would have him arrested?", "Liam: Yeah, if it came to that, yeah.", "Steffy: Liam, we are talking about your father. Could you really send him to prison?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: No, nicole, I-I'm not upset. This has nothing to do with the adoption papers. It was a very difficult and emotional time, but we got through it. I just want what's best for everybody. And I honestly think that it would be an amazing opportunity for both of you.", "Ridge: I'm not going to force you into something if you're not comfortable with it.", "Vivienne: Are you comfortable with it, honey?", "Nicole: I don't mean to cause problems.", "Julius: You're not. We want to know how you feel.", "Nicole: The idea is exciting... but also a little intimidating. Leaving L.A... my family and friends... lizzy... I'd miss... all of you. How do you feel about it?", "Zende: Look, it's a lot to process. But the more I think about it, the more I think how great it could be. Living in paris, exploring europe, you and me -- I mean, it sounds like a dream. And I get to design at international. Just think about it. The opportunities for us could be great, and you know it'd be quite the adventure.", "Ridge: So, that's a \"yes\"?", "Nicole: It'S... a \"yes.\"", "Rick: Alright! Congratulations, guys.", "Vivienne: I am so happy for you! It's exciting.", "Julius: Now, you take good care of my baby. Make sure she's safe.", "Nicole: Hey, I'll be the one looking out for him. I know more french than he does.", "Maya: You know what, ridge is right. You're not going to regret this. You're going to have the time of your life, nicole.", "Nicole: I hope so.", "Zende: Yes. New beginning.", "Rick: [ Chuckles ]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "C.J.: Wait, that's it? You're just gonna leave town?", "Sally: I mean, what's left for me here? Nothing but a charred office in your charred building.", "C.J.: Not for long, cuz. I'm selling the building to bill spencer.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: I still can't believe that there was a fire at spectra on the eve of their important show. I mean, how could that possibly happen?", "Bill: That building had been neglected for years.", "Brooke: You know, I almost feel sorry for sally. I heard that her designs are pretty good.", "Bill: Well, I guess we'll never know, will we?", "Brooke: Yeah. And now she has to leave town. Poor girl. She was on the brink of success. And now -- nothing. All while thomas was in new york --", "Bill: Can we not talk about sally or spectra?", "Brooke: You still didn't tell me what got you so upset at work. What put you in this mood, bill? Come on. You can tell me. Why are you so upset?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: My dad ordered a building to be torched, steffy. Like -- like he thinks he's some gangster? He's done a lot of terrible things. Nothing as bad as this. I mean, people could have been killed.", "Steffy: I get it. I get it. I don't condone what bill did.", "Liam: Okay, well, then he needs to pay a price.", "Steffy: Giving up the company that he built?", "Liam: On the backs of a lot of people.", "Steffy: And if he doesn't?", "Liam: He goes to prison.", "Steffy: You are so certain that you can do that to him?", "Liam: [ Scoffs ] I don't want to do that to him, but that's the point. I'm banking on it. He's not gonna let me send him to prison. But all these people have been burned by him, and the only way to stop him is to grab the source of his power -- spencer publications -- and I'm gonna run this company the way it deserves to be run.", "Steffy: I have never seen this side of you before, liam.", "Liam: Yeah, well, neither has he. But he better get used to it. He's out. I'm in. Finally I have control over him, and I plan on using it. I'm gonna make some much-needed changes to this company. I'm gonna take us in a new direction, and there's nothing my dad can do but sit back and accept it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: [ Laughs ] We're really doing this.", "Nicole: It makes my head spin just thinking about it.", "Zende: Eiffel tower, walking along the champs-elys\u00e9es, the history there, romance.", "Nicole: And you are going to learn a lot about fashion.", "Zende: It's all because of you. I couldn't have done it without you. Look, I know it's gonna be hard to leave our family, and especially lizzy, but... look, I really think that this is gonna be a time in our lives that we'll never forget.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: You say you're gonna make changes to the company?", "Liam: Been wanting to a long time.", "Steffy: What kind of changes?", "Liam: Well, workers are gonna be valued and protected, for one. And I'm talking childcare all the way on up to 401(k). My dad's been offering the bare minimum for way too long, and spencer has to do better. Fair and equal pay for employees comes to mind. And globally speaking, we'll reduce our carbon footprint. Our impact on the environment is a huge priority for me.", "Steffy: Wow. I'm actually impressed.", "Liam: [ Scoffs ] Yeah, well, it'll take a lot of work to unravel my dad's bad policies. Like this. This, for example. My dad's not taking that property from sally anymore.", "Steffy: I, uh, I saw sally today. She's leaving town.", "Liam: Yes. Another one of my dad's victims. Got to have his building, no matter who gets steamrolled in the process.", "Steffy: Yeah, your father's all about progress. I'm not a fan of his tactics, but it can't be denied -- he's all about growth of his company.", "Liam: Yeah, well, I'm not. I mean, I know how to turn a profit, but profits ain't everything.", "Steffy: Liam, look, I know that you could make this company better under your leadership.", "Liam: Is there a \"but\" coming?", "Steffy: Yeah, there's a \"but.\"", "Liam: [ Scoffs ]", "Steffy: I don't care about this company right now. I care about you and your father, the effect this will have on your relationship.", "Liam: He'll get over it.", "[ Scoffs ]", "Steffy: Your father doesn't just \"get over\" blackmail. And that's exactly what this is.", "Liam: Steffy --", "Steffy: It is!", "Liam: Wow.", "Steffy: And blackmail is a crime, just like arson.", "Liam: I already heard this from my dad. Please don't make me hear it from you, too.", "Steffy: [ Sighs ]", "Liam: I didn't do this, okay? I didn't put this in motion. He did.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Bill?", "Liam: You are stepping down, effective immediately.", "Brooke: You can talk to me. What's going on?", "Liam: 9:00. Or I call the police. You get me?", "Brooke: Do you hear me? You know you can talk to me about anything. Do you really need to drink more? We haven't even had dinner yet. Now you're really worrying me. Why don't you tell me what you're thinking?", "Bill: What I'm thinking... I'm thinking of taking some time off.", "Brooke: Time off?", "Bill: To be with you. We could travel, just do whatever.", "Brooke: That's really nice, but you'd go crazy in a couple of days. So where's all this coming from?", "Bill: I just feel like I need to get away.", "Brooke: From spencer? Who would run the company?", "Bill: I have two sons. Liam is president.", "Brooke: And liam is very smart and talented, but you two are very different, so for you to hand the company over to liam, that just wouldn't make sense.", "Liam: Tomorrow, I become the new C.E.O. Of spencer publications.", "Bill: That might be exactly what I need to do.", "Brooke: So why do you need to do that? Why do you need to hand the company over to liam? Bill, what's really going on here?", "Liam: Now look me in the eye and tell me the truth! Were you behind that fire? [ Echoing ] Arson!", "Bill: I did it! I told justin to get someone to set fire to spectra fashions so I could build spencer tower!", "Liam: It's just gone on too long -- the lying and manipulating... and now arson. Well, enough is enough."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSXczpLikEY"}
