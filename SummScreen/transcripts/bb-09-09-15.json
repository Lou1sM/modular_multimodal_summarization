    "Recap": [
        "Caroline and Thomas listen as Steffy tells them that the video has been deleted. Thomas does not think this sounds like the Ivy of late but hopes she came to her senses. Steffy is not happy that even Caroline knows but makes Caroline promise secrecy from Ridge. Ridge does breeze in and is happy when Steffy tells him that Lt. Baker called and they have dropped the investigation. Ridge says he has more good news. He and Caroline are engaged. The reluctant Steffy says she is okay with this if it is what they want. Caroline explains that her two mothers are happy too. She leaves to go inform Bill. Steffy reminds Thomas it wasn't that long ago that he and Caroline were more than friends. Now he is all for Caroline marrying his dad so she wants to hear more. He sloughs it off and she accuses him of not being a very good best man with this attitude.",
        "Brooke is working on the Sky Lounge when Katie and Bill walk out and say they have been summoned by Caroline with some news. Brooke looks worried. Caroline joins them and asks Brooke to stay as she has news for her too. She flashes her big rock on her fingers as Bill rolls his eyes and Brooke's widen. Bill makes a snarky remark that Ridge has had plenty of those already. Caroline says she knows several have a history with Ridge, both Katie and Brooke for instance. Yes they all have pasts but they have moved on. Both are surprised when she says they are also planning on having children despite Ridge originally saying he did not want another family. Bill makes another remark about Caroline pushing Ridge in a wheelchair to his son's graduation. Brooke says good luck with that. Although he is against it, Bill assures her if she marries he will be there in support. Brooke storms off and into Ridge's office and asks if he is out of his mind. She does not think this is something to joke about. He points out that she thinks Caroline is of a different era but that is exactly what Stephanie used to say about her when Brooke married Eric. Brooke tells him he already has grown children and one that still needs his attention. And there is no guarantee that his vasectomy can be reversed so he needs to tell Caroline .and if he doesn't she will."

        "Caroline: She deleted it?",
        "Steffy: Every copy she had.",
        "Thomas: Off of all of her devices?",
        "Steffy: The video's gone. Wyatt made sure of it.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] This doesn't sound like Ivy.",
        "Caroline: I mean, at least not the Ivy that she's been lately.",
        "Thomas: So she's finally come to her senses?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, apparently.",
        "Thomas: Do you trust her?",
        "Steffy: Do I trust Ivy? No. But I do believe the video is gone. We made a pact to never talk about it again. To anyone. I wasn't thrilled Thomas told you about it. You didn't say anything to my dad?",
        "Caroline: No. Not a word.",
        "Steffy: Good. Let's keep it that way.",
        "Ridge: Wow. Good morning.",
        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Hi.",
        "Steffy: Uh, Lieutenant Baker called. He said that the investigation into Aly's death has been closed.",
        "Ridge: Well, good. There shouldn't have been an investigation in the first place.",
        "Steffy: He also called Thorne. It's all over.",
        "Ridge: All right. Good news. Oh, and speaking of good news, I have some. At least I hope you think it's good news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh! Hey!",
        "Brooke: Hi! Oh, this is a surprise. What are you two doing here?",
        "Katie: Oh, well, we've been summoned. Caroline wants to talk to her uncle.",
        "Brooke: About what?",
        "Bill: Well, it's a big mystery. But she says it's important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: We're engaged.",
        "Steffy: What? Oh, my God. How -- how did this come about?",
        "Ridge: Oh, the craziest thing. I asked her, and she said yes.",
        "Steffy: I know -- [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: I know you weren't crazy about this in the beginnings.",
        "Steffy: No, no, if -- if this is what you want. I mean, if this is what both of you want.",
        "Caroline: We do.",
        "Ridge: We do.",
        "Thomas: Aww. And the two shall respond as one.",
        "Steffy: You knew about this?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Dad asked me to be his best man.",
        "Steffy: Well, then I-I guess congratulations are in order.",
        "Caroline: Thank you, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, of course. Have you posted anything?",
        "Caroline: No, no, no, no. Uh, but I did tell my moms, and they were very excited.",
        "Thomas: What about your uncle?",
        "Caroline: Oh, my gosh. Yeah. I'm supposed to go talk to him right now, so I'm gonna -- I'm gonna see you later, okay?",
        "Ridge: Hmm. All right. Now you can tell me.",
        "Steffy: Tell you what?",
        "Ridge: What you really think.",
        "Steffy: Well, it's -- it's obvious you're all-in.",
        "Thomas: More than you think. Dad, you want to tell her the other part?",
        "Ridge: We're not only getting married. We're gonna start a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You've been around Caroline more than I have. What's going on with her?",
        "Brooke: Well, uh...",
        "Bill: Come on, Brooke. I mean, we're all...family.",
        "Katie: Maybe she doesn't know what's going on. Don't make her uncomfortable.",
        "Bill: I'm not making her uncomfortable. Am I making you uncomfortable?",
        "Brooke: I'm not Caroline's confidante.",
        "Bill: But she's dating the dressmaker, which means I'm sure you're keeping tabs on her.",
        "Brooke: Ridge and I are friends. Nothing more.",
        "Caroline: Hi! Sorry, sorry, sorry. Didn't mean to keep you waiting.",
        "Bill: Well, you did keep us waiting. So...cut to the chase.",
        "Brooke: I'll give you some privacy.",
        "Caroline: Uh, no, no, no. It's fine. I mean, I have happy news, and I'm okay to share it with everyone. Care to guess?",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Katie: Did you get a promotion?",
        "Caroline: I did not. But I will give you a hint.",
        "Katie: Oh...my God. You're engaged.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: So you broke up with Caroline for one night before deciding you want to have a baby with her?",
        "Ridge: It was a significant night.",
        "Steffy: Must have been.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I told her I wasn't gonna be the one that can give her a baby yet -- I just didn't want that -- and to find someone who wants to give that to her, so she left.",
        "Steffy: And then?",
        "Ridge: And then I-I just couldn't get her out of my mind. Thinking about what I did to her, what I did to us. So I tried to -- I wanted to talk to her about Aly and Thorne and about Phoebe. And not a day goes by where I don't miss your sister. There's something that comes with the great gift of being a parent, and that is the constant fear of losing them. But there's been so much loss, and...and I just -- I don't want to lose Caroline. But she was out there in the night, devastated and alone, probably wondering if she was ever gonna be enough. So I called her. She didn't want to tell me where she was. And I just wanted to make things right, you know?",
        "Steffy: Make things right by getting married and having a child?",
        "Steffy: No, Dad, I'm serious. You didn't want this. And Caroline knew that. I mean, God, have you really thought this through?",
        "Ridge: Did you think it through when you wanted to be with Liam? No, sometimes we just do what we think is right. And I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman. I love her. And I know what it feels like for her to walk out the door, and I don't ever want to feel that again.",
        "Steffy: And you're okay with this?",
        "Thomas: It's not about me. Or you, for that matter. Dad proposed, and Caroline accepted. What I want is for Caroline and -- and Dad to be happy, and I'm not gonna do anything to get in the way of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Wow, that is some ring.",
        "Bill: You do realize he has a drawer full, though, don't you?",
        "Caroline: Uncle Bill. I'm getting married.",
        "Bill: No, no, you're engaged. That doesn't mean you're actually getting married.",
        "Caroline: No, I'm getting married. Look, I get it. It's kind of weird, because everybody has history with him. But everyone's moved on. I mean, look, you're with my superstud uncle. Brooke, you could have anybody that you want, so...",
        "Katie: It's just, um, this is a bit unexpected.",
        "Bill: Not to me. I knew the second you started working with that predator this is where it was heading.",
        "Caroline: Well, I didn't. I mean, I was attracted to him, obviously.",
        "Bill: But you were married. Of course, the dressmaker likes it that way.",
        "Katie: Bill.",
        "Caroline: What about you, Brooke? You haven't said anything.",
        "Brooke: Marriage can be a huge commitment.",
        "Bill: Not to Ridge.",
        "Brooke: Have you thought about the implications?",
        "Caroline: That -- yeah, I get to spend my life with the man that I love, so...",
        "Bill: Latest in a long line for him.",
        "Caroline: You know what? We all have our pasts, okay? I used to be with Rick. Ridge used to be with Brooke and you.",
        "Bill: Yeah, why don't we just recite the list? Start now, maybe we'll be done by sunset.",
        "Caroline: It doesn't matter, you know? All that matters is that I found Ridge and that he found me.",
        "Brooke: Are you ready for marriage?",
        "Caroline: Yes.",
        "Brooke: Is Ridge?",
        "Caroline: Yes. He's as committed as I am.",
        "Brooke: Marriage is more than just a husband and a wife.",
        "Caroline: What -- what does that -- what does that even mean?",
        "Brooke: You want to have a family.",
        "Caroline: So?",
        "Brooke: Well, it's been a point of contention between you and Ridge. Ridge can't give you a family.",
        "Caroline: And I was just happy to be with him.",
        "Bill: Without the possibility of having children?",
        "Caroline: Uncle, I love him. I want to have kids, but it's not a dealbreaker for me not to be with him.",
        "Katie: Okay, so you're gonna marry Ridge and not have children?",
        "Caroline: No. Because he changed his mind, and we're gonna actually start a family. He even bought a bassinet.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Wait a second. You're actually gonna have children with this guy?",
        "Caroline: I can't wait.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Really? You're excited about this? Do you understand that you will be pushing him to a high school graduation in a wheelchair?",
        "Caroline: He is not that old!",
        "Bill: Caroline, do the math. It's not like he's gonna be tossing the football around with his grandkids.",
        "Katie: I thought Ridge didn't want another family.",
        "Brooke: He doesn't.",
        "Caroline: He didn't, because like I said, he changed his mind.",
        "Brooke: Sometimes men get caught up in their emotions, and I've seen Ridge do that many times.",
        "Katie: So have I.",
        "Bill: All right, I'm gonna give you a little advice here, okay, sweetheart? You're gonna go away. You're gonna take a little vacation. You're gonna clear your mind. You're going to gain some perspective.",
        "Caroline: You guys are such Debbie Downers! Seriously! I'm getting married, and I'm gonna start a family.",
        "Brooke: Ridge told you he could give you a child?",
        "Caroline: Yes, Brooke. Yes. He wants what I want, so yes, we're gonna have kids.",
        "Brooke: Good luck with that. Congratulations. I have a meeting to attend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Okay, we're gonna get real here.",
        "Thomas: It's a shocker. I know. Dad wanted to tell you himself.",
        "Steffy: What's shocking is that you accept this. Dad and Caroline getting married, having a child. I know you, Thomas. This isn't what you want for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: What is going on with you?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ridge: You heard.",
        "Brooke: That you're marrying Caroline? Are you out of your mind?",
        "Caroline: I didn't expect you to pop champagne bottles, but I didn't...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Listen, you have to understand --",
        "Caroline: I have to understand what? I'm getting married. This is something that you celebrate. It's not something you grieve.",
        "Bill: We would be celebrating if --",
        "Caroline: If I weren't marrying Ridge. I get that. But I thought that you two were okay.",
        "Bill: Why would you think that? Just because I own some shares in his little dressmaking company doesn't mean I want Ridge walking my niece down the aisle.",
        "Caroline: So, does that mean that you're not gonna be at the wedding?",
        "Bill: I'll tell you what it means --",
        "Katie: If there's a wedding, I mean, when -- when there's a wedding --",
        "Bill: When is it?",
        "Caroline: It's soon.",
        "Bill: Oh, for God...",
        "Caroline: Uncle Bill, you and the boys are the only family that I have in town, and I'm sure that Steffy and Brooke and the rest of the Forresters are not gonna be thrilled about this, so I really just need some support.",
        "Katie: What about Thomas?",
        "Caroline: Yeah, fine. Thomas is supportive. He's just about the only person that is. But I really, really want you guys to be happy for me.",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: Especially you, Uncle Bill. Come on. Could you please just put aside your differences and just do this for me? Please.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] You're like a daughter to me, Caroline. So, of course, I will be there for you. Always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I told you what I want for Caroline.",
        "Steffy: Her happiness. You didn't believe she could have that with Dad.",
        "Thomas: Guess I was wrong.",
        "Steffy: No, no. No. What's really going on here?",
        "Thomas: Nothing, Steff. Let it go.",
        "Steffy: Is that what you've done? 'Cause you were so convinced Dad was all wrong for Caroline.",
        "Thomas: Did you hear about my, uh, my new, big promotion?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, yeah, that you're a part of the design team.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Dad finally came through.",
        "Steffy: Oh! That's why you're supporting the wedding.",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Steffy: You honestly expect me to believe that?",
        "Thomas: Caroline wants a family with Dad. Nobody knows that better than me.",
        "Steffy: And you talked to her about this?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. We're friends. We talk.",
        "Steffy: Did you forget you guys were more than friends at one point?",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] So what?",
        "Steffy: Something is going on here, and you're not telling me. Come on, Thomas. Tell me what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: What are you thinking?",
        "Ridge: Thinking is overrated, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, this is nothing to joke about.",
        "Ridge: Who's joking?",
        "Brooke: You're in denial.",
        "Ridge: In denial about what?",
        "Brooke: Caroline. She's from a different era.",
        "Ridge: That's funny. That's exactly what Mom used to say when you married Dad.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] What is it that you have in common, really? Besides a physical attraction.",
        "Ridge: This in common.",
        "Brooke: Fine. Okay, the Bohemian artist shacks up with a younger woman. Just leave it at that. You don't have to marry her.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, 'cause that wouldn't be Bohemian, would it?",
        "Brooke: You already have grown children, and one of them still needs your attention.",
        "Ridge: Is that what this is about? I'll always be there for RJ. You know that.",
        "Brooke: Why are you spinning this dream in her head?",
        "Ridge: It's not a dream. We're gonna have a life together.",
        "Brooke: She thinks that includes children.",
        "Ridge: It does.",
        "Brooke: Do I need to point out the obvious?",
        "Ridge: The vasectomy is...",
        "Brooke: Our little secret? Which isn't going to be a secret much longer.",
        "Ridge: I'm gonna have it reversed. You even mentioned that yourself. So that's what I'm doing.",
        "Brooke: Have you talked to your doctor?",
        "Ridge: Not yet.",
        "Brooke: There is no guarantee.",
        "Ridge: I realize that.",
        "Brooke: So have you told Caroline? No. Of course, you haven't.",
        "Ridge: I haven't told her, because I don't want to worry her.",
        "Brooke: Ridge! This has disaster written all over it, and I don't want that for you.",
        "Ridge: And I appreciate that, but you can rest easy. We're gonna have a nice wedding and a beautiful life. This is gonna last.",
        "Brooke: You know how devastating secrets are. You have to tell Caroline about the vasectomy. She has every right to know.",
        "Caroline: Hey. What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: That was very sweet.",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah. That's me. A real sweetheart.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Well, Caroline thinks so, and so do I.",
        "Bill: Then I'm doing something wrong.",
        "Katie: No. You couldn't resist your niece. It was nice. It was nice to watch.",
        "Bill: I said I would support her. I hope I don't regret it.",
        "Katie: You won't.",
        "Bill: Well, you obviously trust that loser more than I do.",
        "Katie: It doesn't matter whether I do or not. I know that you will always be there for Caroline.",
        "Bill: I don't want to have to pick up the pieces, Katie.",
        "Katie: Maybe there won't be any pieces to pick up.",
        "Bill: He better treat her like a princess.",
        "Katie: Like you do?",
        "Bill: No comparison.",
        "Katie: So sexy when you're protective.",
        "Bill: I won't be so sexy if I have to come down on Ridge.",
        "Katie: Hmm. My big, bad Bill.",
        "Bill: [Growls]",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Something is off with you.",
        "Thomas: I've got a lot of design work that I have to finish.",
        "Steffy: No, it's more than that.",
        "Thomas: Look, Steff, stop analyzing. It's annoying.",
        "Steffy: And you look uncomfortable.",
        "Thomas: I'm tired. I just want to get past this.",
        "Steffy: Past what?",
        "Thomas: All this talk about marriage and children, and now we've got a wedding to look forward to.",
        "Steffy: Bad attitude for a best man. What's the real problem?",
        "Thomas: I don't have a problem.",
        "Steffy: It has to do something with Dad and Caroline.",
        "Thomas: Look, a lot has happened between those two in the last couple of days.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, and you're in the middle of it.",
        "Thomas: Can we change the subject?",
        "Steffy: So there is a problem.",
        "Thomas: It's --",
        "Steffy: You do have an issue with the marriage. You do.",
        "Thomas: It's their life, Steff. If they're happy, then I'm fine with that. Now, I have a lot of work to get back to, so if you don't mind...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Seems tense in here. Did I walk in on something?",
        "Ridge: Brooke and I were just having a little chat.",
        "Caroline: Ah. Let me guess. About weddings and babies?",
        "Brooke: You wanted children with Rick.",
        "Caroline: Yes, and I'm going to have them with Ridge.",
        "Brooke: Sometimes it's not that simple, Caroline.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, that's enough.",
        "Caroline: Look, Brooke, I don't want to disrespect you. I mean, you obviously have feelings for Ridge still. You have a child together. I mean, but is it so hard to believe that I would want that, too?",
        "Brooke: No, of course not. Under the right conditions.",
        "Caroline: What -- what conditions?",
        "Ridge: Brooke, that's enough. We're engaged. We're gonna get married.",
        "Brooke: But that's not really the issue.",
        "Caroline: What issue?",
        "Ridge: There is no issue. [Sighs] We're gonna have a life together. What are you -- why? Why?",
        "Caroline: And a family.",
        "Ridge: Yes, a family.",
        "Brooke: We'll see.",
        "Caroline: Is it my love for him that you're questioning, or is it his for me?",
        "Brooke: No, this isn't about love.",
        "Caroline: Then what is it about? Because he knows how I feel.",
        "Ridge: And she knows how I feel, so everything is fine.",
        "Brooke: But she doesn't know everything.",
        "Caroline: What is she talking about?",
        "Ridge: Nothing.",
        "Brooke: Caroline has expectations. She has a right to know.",
        "Caroline: Know what?",
        "Brooke: Tell her, Ridge. If you don't, I will."
