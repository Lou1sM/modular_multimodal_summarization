        "Caroline puts her hand on Ridge's and says she is sorry. He takes it away and says they came here to work. There is nothing to be sorry about. She tells him people love him and they will understand. He says there is nothing to understand. Caroline asks then what do they do now. Ridge says to make the corrections he asked her to make. She says she tried but she still didn't get it. He tells her try again. Brooke meets Katie for lunch and says this was a surprise. Katie says she came in with Ridge and thought they could have lunch like they used to. It's a little weird and awkward until they get their small talk out of the way. Katie is the first to say that things aren't that good. This whole thing with Ridge has been stressful and hard. She's like to talk to her best friend but ends up hanging up because her best friend is Brooke. She says she misses her sister, she misses her best friend so today she did not hang up. Brooke brightens up and says she misses Katie too. Katie says she is tired of being angry. She doesn't have that kind of energy anymore. Brooke says it does not have to be awkward. They are sisters and they love each other so no matter how much they have hurt each other in the past they will always love each other. And she can talk to her about anything. Katie says she just wants to do the right thing and give Ridge what he needs but she is not sure what that is. He needs to be creative. Does Brooke think that is why they aren't married yet, that he feels less than a man. Maya has her hand on Rick's shoulder. He calls attention to it and says it needs to be somewhere else .like not as on this person. She asks if he heard what she just said. He says yes, that she still loves him. She asks if that is uncomfortable for him. He says only because she can't seem to change the subject. She says unlike Caroline she thinks honesty is the best policy. And she also believes that somewhere he feels the same way too. He says this can go one of two ways. He can get mad and fire her .or. She asks why when she does her job well. He laments that she is difficult and pushy and won't listen to him. She says that worked for Caroline. He says or he could thank her for having feelings for him but nothing is ever going to come of it. He likes being married. He's never been happier. She continues that she has seen him happier. She made him happier. He shakes his head and says there was something just not quite right about them being together. Maybe it was too needy or dependent. Maya confesses that she felt it too but it had nothing to do with the way they felt about each other. It was like the odds were stacked against them and they had a right to be afraid of that. They have been through the worst so there is nothing to be afraid of anymore. She says she does not believe he is going to fire her. He says difficult people do not last long here. She scoffs, difficult people call the shots here. And she is hardly his biggest problem, Ridge is. And as much as she is aggravating him right now it is not half as bad as what Caroline pulled on her. Caroline asks Ridge why his hand is shaking. He says nervous habit, it's all right. She says it's only her here now. Rick is not here. He is going to have to tell him something eventually. He asks her if she wants to learn. She is not sure she is bright enough or talented enough. He tells her to stop. She is all those things and more. They make a good team. She says that is just it. She thought he was helping her, not that she was helping him too. She says he should have told her. She would be honored to work with him and know that he trusted her. He says trust is a funny word. What if he doesn't trust her that she and Rick are not going to finish what her Uncle Bill started. She's stunned when he says her uncle wanted him dead. He grabs the pen and tablet but can't do anything. He breaks the pencil into. He tells her his hand won't do what his mind wants it to. She slowly takes her hand and puts it on his and says with practice perhaps hers can. Rick tells Maya that she is cute when she is being coy. But too bad she is hardly ever coy anymore, just aggressive. She says yeah men get promoted for being aggressive but women get fired. She says she knows he remembers them too. He says yes, he didn't say he didn't, just that he was married. She says they know something that most people are too afraid to admit. He asks her to remind him. She says marriage is not forever. He and Caroline married too fast. Sure she is behaving now but the lies and secrets are gonna start up again any day now. Rick says she is right about one thing. He is not going to fire her. But if there are any more surprises like the steam room or being rude to Caroline, that is exactly what he will do.",
        "Ridge fills Caroline in on what happened in Dubai. Not many people know about it and he'd like to keep it that way. She asks what his doctor says. Ridge says it is all about neuro something and his doctor doesn't know if he will ever get what he lost back. But he thinks he will and he thinks it will be with Caroline. Katie tells Brooke that Ridge is so all consumed by not drawing that there is not much else to talk about. Brooke says artists are like that, work, work, work and that is what they talk about. Katie says and yes with Bill there were certain things that she did not want to know about. Katie says Ridge has not changed his mind about marriage. They talk about where they'd like to travel, how to parents the boys but it is vague and no dates or to do lists, just \"someday\". She does not want to add to his stress so she says nothing. He is the man she fell in love with, not sketches and designs and it would be fine with her if he never worked again. Brooke says but that is a future that Ridge could not contemplate. Katie says she knows. She wants to be whoever he needs but she doesn't know what that is. With his hand guiding hers, Caroline is able to finish another couture design. He thinks she can hand it to Rick. She says he still has it, all of it. He says yes all of it except the ability to put it down on paper so he needs her to work with him. She chuckles that is a fantasy she has been waiting to hear since she came to FC. And she wants no credit. There is no question in her mind that the design is his and she is happy to contribute. But people will eventually find out. He says they can't. They just need to continue doing what they are doing. She says she will but she has to tell Rick. Ridge is adamant, no if Rick finds out he is impaired he knows Rick doesn't want to hurt him but if he discovers a weakness then he will strike. And she needs to think about this if they continue this they can have a whole new line and the public loves Rick so it will be his success too. Finally she agrees. He says he knows he is not easy. She says she can handle it and learn from him. He says it will be their secret. He gives her a big hug. Maya starts to enter when she sees them hug. She has a big smile on her face."

        "Caroline: I'm sorry.",
        "Ridge: Why would you be sorry? You came here to work, right? Don't do that.",
        "Caroline: Everybody loves you. People will understand.",
        "Ridge: We're making a mistake. There's nothing to understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: What a nice surprise.",
        "Katie: Um, well, I-I came in with Ridge this morning, so I thought maybe we could have lunch like we used to.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Um, yeah. That's -- that's great. So, how is Ridge?",
        "Katie: He's okay.",
        "Brooke: How are you?",
        "Katie: I'm fine. I'm -- I'm -- I'm good.",
        "Brooke: Great. Uh, this is kind of -- this is weird. It's very awkward. What is going on?",
        "Katie: I'm -- I'm sorry. I just -- I... actually, I'm -- I'm not so good. This whole thing with Ridge has just been so stressful and hard, and... you know, I pick up my phone almost every day, and sometimes I even dial it because I just want to talk to my best friend, but... I always end up hanging up because... my best friend is you. I just want to feel normal. But I don't even know what that is. All I know is that I miss you. I miss my sister. I miss my best friend. So today I decided not to hang up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Maya... the hand.",
        "Maya: What about it?",
        "Rick: It needs to be somewhere else. As in not on this person.",
        "Maya: Did you not hear what I said?",
        "Rick: You're thinking that you still love me.",
        "Maya: I never said anything about thinking. Does that make you uncomfortable?",
        "Rick: Only that you can't seem to change the subject.",
        "Maya: Because I, unlike Caroline, believe that honesty is the best policy.",
        "Rick: Okay, fine. You can feel free to feel exactly how you'd like to. We've established that.",
        "Maya: Good, because I also believe that somewhere... you feel what I feel, too.",
        "Rick: This can go one of two ways -- I can get all outraged and fire you...",
        "Maya: Why would you do that when I am so good at my job?",
        "Rick: Uh, because you're difficult and -- and pushy and won't listen to me.",
        "Maya: It worked for Caroline.",
        "Rick: Or... I could tell you, \"Thank you,\" that I appreciate that you have feelings for me. But nothing is ever gonna come of this, Maya. I love being married. I've never been happier.",
        "Maya: I have seen you happier, Rick. I made you happier.",
        "Rick: There was something that just wasn't right about us being together. I can't put my finger on it, but it was maybe too needy or too dependent.",
        "Maya: I felt it, too. But it had nothing to do with the way that we felt about each other. It was fear of losing each other because the odds were so stacked against us, and we had a right to be afraid. But we survived. We're alive. [Chuckles], If I seem pushy or difficult to you now, it is only because when you've been through the worst... there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I miss you, too.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I'm just so tired of being angry. I just don't have the energy to keep it up anymore. This thing with Ridge -- I probably don't even have a right to talk to you about it, but I can't stand this awkwardness between us. I just can't stand it.",
        "Brooke: It doesn't have to be awkward. We can just accept the fact that we're sisters, no matter how much we've hurt each other in the past, and... Katie, we're always gonna be sisters and we're always gonna love each other.",
        "Katie: I do love you, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: And I love you, and you know you can talk to me about anything.",
        "Katie: Okay. I'm just -- I'm trying so hard to be as supportive as I possibly can be with Ridge, but I just want to do the right thing, I just want to give him what he needs, but I'm not sure what that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: What do we do now?",
        "Ridge: You make the corrections I told you to make.",
        "Caroline: I tried, and I still didn't get it.",
        "Ridge: Well, try again.",
        "Caroline: You know what you want. Can't you just show me? You get angry when I try and angry when I don't do it.",
        "Ridge: I'm not angry.",
        "Caroline: Then why is your hand shaking?",
        "Ridge: It's a nervous habit. It's nothing.",
        "Caroline: Ridge, it's -- this is between you and me. Rick isn't here.",
        "Ridge: Why would Rick be here? This is designers only.",
        "Caroline: You know if you don't tell me, you're gonna have to tell him.",
        "Ridge: Tell you what? Tell him what?",
        "Caroline: What it is that you're hiding or think that you're hiding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I don't know what I expected you to say.",
        "Brooke: Ridge and Bill aren't so different, are they?",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Brooke: Well, you know, you can't ask Ridge how his work day went.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I know. I-I try not to, but he's so consumed by his work right now that I feel like if I don't ask the question, then we won't have anything to talk about.",
        "Brooke: Well, that's not gonna change, even when he recovers. I mean, artists are just like that. They need to work, work, work, and if they're not, they feel like they're not doing anything, and even asking them about it is a reproach.",
        "Katie: Of course, with Bill, there were certain things that I just didn't want to know.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. I couldn't ask Bill about how his day went, either, but that's because he was at home. He wasn't at work. I know you still hold resentment towards me because I helped get Spencer Publications back to Bill, but that's because I was feeling the way you're feeling now. His whole identity is wrapped up in his work, in his job. That makes him who he is. And I know Ridge feels the same way. And he loves you, Katie, and he knows you love him. It's just he doesn't understand why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I don't think you're going to fire me.",
        "Rick: Difficult people don't last here.",
        "Maya: Two reasons -- number one, \"Difficult people don't last here\"? Are you kidding me?! Difficult people call the shots here. And I am hardly your biggest problem. Ridge is. And, number two, as much as I may be aggravating you right now, you know that is nothing compared to what your darling wife pulled on me. Number three --",
        "Rick: You said there were two reasons.",
        "Maya: Okay. Fine. I'm done.",
        "Rick: All right. What's number three?",
        "Maya: Are you sure you want to know?",
        "Rick: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You don't know me. You don't know anything about me.",
        "Caroline: Do you want me to leave?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] No. Do you want to learn?",
        "Caroline: Maybe I'm not bright enough or talented enou--",
        "Ridge: Stop. You're all those things and more. You have what it takes. I thought we made a pretty good team earlier.",
        "Caroline: It's just that I didn't know that we were a team. I thought you were just helping me. I didn't realize that I was helping you, too. Ridge, you could have told me. I'd still be honored to work with you and be trusted by you.",
        "Ridge: Trusted? Trust is a funny word, isn't it? \"Trust.\" \"Trust.\" No one has the right to rob me of what I was born to do, what I've done all my life.",
        "Caroline: What are you talking about?",
        "Ridge: Trust! Trust me? What if I don't trust you? What about that? What if I think that you and Rick -- you're here because you want to finish what Uncle Bill started?",
        "Caroline: My uncle?",
        "Ridge: Yes, your uncle. He wanted me dead. My hand won't do... what I want it to do anymore.",
        "Caroline: Well, maybe with some practice, mine can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: It's true what you say. Ridge feels like he's nothing without his work.",
        "Brooke: There have to be other ways for him to be creative.",
        "Katie: Well, he may have a solution.",
        "Brooke: I'm sure there's some kind of new technology out there that he can play with.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Well, I guess we'll see. I just keep feeling like this is...",
        "Brooke: I'm sure it affects your relationship. It has to.",
        "Katie: Do you think that's why we're not married? Do you think he feels like less of a man?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You're cute when you're being coy.",
        "Maya: Thank you.",
        "Rick: Too bad you're almost never coy anymore.",
        "Maya: What am I, then?",
        "Rick: Aggressive.",
        "Maya: Why is it that men get promoted for being aggressive and women get fired?",
        "Rick: You have your two reasons to protect you.",
        "Maya: Three.",
        "Rick: Which is?",
        "Maya: You remember us, too.",
        "Rick: I never said that I didn't. I just said I was married.",
        "Maya: But you and I know something about that that most people are too afraid to admit.",
        "Rick: Why don't you remind me what that is?",
        "Maya: That marriage isn't forever. You and Caroline got married too fast. You know it, and I know it. Sure... she's behaving now. But the secrets and the lies are gonna start up again any day now.",
        "Rick: Yeah, you're right about one thing -- I'm not gonna fire you. But if there's any more surprises like the steam room or being blatantly rude to Caroline, that's exactly what's gonna happen.",
        "Maya: But its okay for her to mangle my name any way she likes? Of course it is... because she has trained you to expect that little from her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I had no way of knowing that the helicopter I ordered never showed up, and then I got on to Bill's by mistake. None of that came together until my memory came back. All of it -- the Spencer logo on the jacket and Bill's most trusted employee was wearing it and that Bill was giving the order to drop me out of the helicopter. A fisherman and his family picked me up, took care of me, and I don't know why they didn't report it. Maybe they thought there was a reward. Maybe they were scared. I don't know. But one day, I just wandered off, couldn't find my way back, and that's when Brooke found me on the beach. And with Brooke, Katie, my family, coming back here... it brought everything back. All my memories -- everything came back... except this, so... [Sighs] What a day that was, huh? Now... not a lot of people know about that, and I would like to keep it that way, okay?",
        "Caroline: What does your doctor say?",
        "Ridge: Words. Words, words, words. Neuroskeletal and, uh... neuro-something. A lot of \"Neuro\" stuff going on there.",
        "Caroline: Meaning?",
        "Ridge: Meaning she doesn't know why I lost what I lost or if I'll ever get it back.",
        "Caroline: What do you think?",
        "Ridge: I think I have a chance. And I think that chance is with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Have you asked Ridge if he changed his mind?",
        "Katie: He hasn't changed his mind.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry. I thought you were asking.",
        "Katie: No, I -- we still talk about the future, you know? We still talk about the places we want to travel and how we're gonna parent the boys and the things we want to do before they're consumed with school. But all the talk never manifests itself into any kind of plan with dates and to-do lists. It's just this vague \"Someday.\" And I don't want to add to his stress, and I-I feel like if I say anything, then he's gonna think I'm questioning his commitment to me, and so I just say nothing.",
        "Brooke: Maybe he's just waiting to be the man that he was when he asked you to marry him.",
        "Katie: He is! I didn't fall in love with sketches and designs. And what if his ability is gone for good? I mean, his doctors are hopeful, but, clearly, they have no clue. It would be fine with me if he never worked again.",
        "Brooke: I don't think that's a future that Ridge can contemplate.",
        "Katie: I know. I just want to be who he needs me to be. But I don't know who that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: There. You see that? It's a little softer, more gradual. Simple. Now, that's couture. You got it now, right?",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: I think we have another design for Rick.",
        "Caroline: You still have it, you know -- all of it... the sense of lightness and volume and that tricky simplicity that you do so well.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Well, I have all of it -- everything except the ability to put it down on paper. Work with me.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] It's been a fantasy of mine since I came to Forrester to hear you say that. But...",
        "Ridge: You want credit. Of course.",
        "Caroline: No. No, no, no, no, no. There is no question in my mind that this design is yours, and I am happy to contribute anonymously what little I can. People will eventually find out.",
        "Ridge: Well, they can't find out.",
        "Caroline: Ridge, how is that realistic?",
        "Ridge: We'll just keep doing what we're doing.",
        "Caroline: I have to at least tell Rick.",
        "Ridge: No. No, you can't do that, 'cause if he finds out that I'm -- I'm, uh, impaired -- is that the right word?",
        "Caroline: We're newlyweds. I mean, what kind of married life am I leading when I can't tell my husband what I'm doing all day?",
        "Ridge: Listen to me. I know Rick doesn't want to hurt me, but if he sees a weakness in me, he's gonna strike. That's part of his nature. Our relationship's very complicated. And you need to think about something. This would be good for him, too. If we can pull this off, if we can have a whole line and the public loves him, well, that'll be his success, too.",
        "Caroline: All right. I'll work with you, and I won't tell Rick -- unless I have to. But that is the best I can do.",
        "Ridge: I know I'm not easy. I know that -- not easy on wives and employees, kids. I ask a lot. I ask too much, maybe.",
        "Caroline: I can handle it. I could learn so much from you.",
        "Ridge: I'll give you everything I have. And it'll be our secret.",
        "Caroline: Our secret."
