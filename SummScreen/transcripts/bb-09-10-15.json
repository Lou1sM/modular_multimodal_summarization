    "Recap": [
        "Caroline wants to know what Brooke and Ridge are talking about; and when both clam up, she thinks she knows it is something Brooke thinks Ridge ought to tell Caroline as the prospective bride. She guesses it might be about RJ, perhaps he is upset they are getting married. She wants to assure Brooke that she would never try to replace her, and she is not the wicked stepmother type. Ridge takes Caroline out the door and slams it. He tells Brooke that this is his life and she needs to butt out. He explains he would have never told her about the vasectomy if he thought she was going to hold it over his head. She says he can not be certain the procedure can be reversed and Caroline deserves to know that since she is counting on having children. He can not start off a marriage with such a huge secret. She questions him if he has spoken to his doctor and he says not yet; he has other important things to plan. She reminds him the longer he waits the harder it might be. He wants this conversation to be just between them.",
        "Working, Thomas thinks about his conversation with Caroline before she completely lost it. He snaps back to reality when Zende and Nicole come in discussing fabric. They talk about a lady in the sewing room who has been there 30 years. Both of them want a future in fashion too. They briefly touch on the news about Caroline and Ridge and how Thomas did not see that coming. He claims he is happy for them. He thought Ridge was through with kids too but he is willing to do that again for Caroline. Zende tells Nicole to be careful talking about Thomas and Caroline as Ridge is CEO and he could get word of it. Zende likes her working there. Thomas and Caroline miss each other as he walks into Rick's office to design and Caroline is walking out to go to the restroom. She returns though in a better mood and explains she was a little concerned but there is no pregnancy and she feels better now. Thomas says he is sorry that she had to go through that worry. He never would have taken advantage of her and she admits she knows that. They will never speak about this again. Ridge tells Brooke this is his little secret and no one else will know."

        "Brooke: You know I'm right.",
        "Caroline: Right about what? What is she talking about here?",
        "Brooke: You're not telling your bride-to-be everything.",
        "Ridge: She knows everything she needs to know.",
        "Caroline: Okay, why are you both talking like I'm not here? What do you know that I don't know?",
        "Brooke: Your fianc\u00e9e has certain expectations.",
        "Caroline: Brooke, I can speak for myself.",
        "Brooke: Am I wrong?",
        "Caroline: No, you're not wrong. Every bride-to-be does have expectations, and... okay, I think I know what's going on here, what you're reluctant to tell me, and what she desperately wants you to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Thomas' flashback]",
        "Thomas: If I was ever lucky enough to have another chance with you, I...I would love that. I would love that opportunity.",
        "Caroline: You're such a good friend to me. You know, you have always been such a good friend.",
        "Thomas: But -- but you and I could be -- could be so much more than friends, and we are. You know? Well, I mean, we were before, but we could be again.",
        "[Present time]",
        "Nicole: I love all these fabrics, the silk one, especially. It's from Tsuruoka in Japan, right?",
        "Zende: Wait. How do you know so much about rare fabrics?",
        "Nicole: I'm an intern, a little sponge soaking up every tidbit of information I possibly can to impress the higher-ups.",
        "Zende: Cathy in the sewing room told you, didn't she?",
        "Nicole: Yeah. Okay, did you know she's been here for 30 years? I should be so lucky.",
        "Zende: You really wanna make a career in fashion?",
        "Nicole: Don't you? I mean, it's who your family is. Eric, Ridge, Steffy, Thomas. The guy is so into his work, I bet you he doesn't remember promising us a big bonus for bringing up these fabrics.",
        "Zende: Yo, cuz. You gonna come up for air anytime soon?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah, sorry.",
        "Nicole: It's like you're trying to bury yourself in your work or something.",
        "Thomas: Oh, I just -- I got behind. There's so much I have to do and catch up on, plus with everything else going on...",
        "Nicole: Like what?",
        "Zende: Yeah. Inquiring minds want to know.",
        "Nicole: Something big. I can tell. Don't leave us in suspense.",
        "Thomas: Dad and Caroline? They're getting married.",
        "Zende: Wow. Uncle Ridge and Caroline tying the knot. I mean, who didn't see that one coming?",
        "Nicole: Thomas, apparently. From the look on your face, I mean.",
        "Thomas: What look is that?",
        "Nicole: Like your dad proposing was the last thing you expected.",
        "Thomas: Well, uh, you know, relationships are complicated. This one's no different. But if marriage is what they really want to do --",
        "Nicole: Which it obviously is, or is there something we're missing?",
        "Thomas: Dad decided to have another kid with Caroline. Does that count?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: It's RJ, isn't it? We told him that we were getting married, and he's upset. Or he's not, and he's fine with the marriage. It's the idea of a new, little brother or sister that he's upset about?",
        "Ridge: It doesn't even matter how RJ reacts to any of it, because he's gonna learn to love you the way that I love you, and as far as this new edition to the family... [Inhales deeply] I'm gonna do whatever I can, but there are no guarantees. You know that.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I-I do. I realize that. But isn't the saying that there's the fun in the trying? Isn't... okay, look, we...we can talk about this when we're at home. Right now I'm gonna go work on that design I was telling you about earlier, okay?",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Caroline: Mm, Brooke, I could never replace you in our R.J.'s life, and I certainly would never try. I'm not that kind of person. I'm not the wicked stepmom type.",
        "Ridge: Come on.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Ridge: Why would you do that? Why would you try to force my hand? This is my life -- my life with Caroline. Stay out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Zende: Getting married and having another kid -- I mean, uncle Ridge does not do halfway.",
        "Nicole: So when's the baby due?",
        "Thomas: It's not. Caroline's not pregnant yet.",
        "Nicole: But she's hoping to be.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Zende: And your dad is okay with that?",
        "Thomas: Well, he wasn't at first, but...",
        "Nicole: Caroline talked him into it.",
        "Thomas: Do you remember what I said about relationships being complicated? Yeah. Well, Dad thought he was done with this part of his life. You know, he's already had two families, and now he's --",
        "Zende: Now he's about to make it 3 for 3.",
        "Nicole: Because of the woman he loves. Caroline means that much to him.",
        "Zende: Girl's a hopeless romantic.",
        "Nicole: So...I happen to like happily-ever-afters, that's what this is for your dad and Caroline. Their happily-ever-after.",
        "Thomas: Look, there's a lot that we could keep talking about, but this is a place of business, and we need to get back to it.",
        "Nicole: Right. We should... finish sorting these fabrics.",
        "Zende: Those are for the Freedom line, right?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. We're ramping up big-time for production, and I know that Dad and Caroline are out on their own, goofing off a little bit right now, and they're distracted, but --",
        "Nicole: You're like a laser. Totally focused on making the line a huge success.",
        "Thomas: Guys, we are the next generation of Forrester. People are expecting a lot from us, and we are going to deliver that.",
        "Zende: We are?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. I want you working closely with me on this. You know, coming up with your own designs if you're interested in that.",
        "Nicole: Hey, I'll do anything, too. Like maybe running these bolts down to the sewing room.",
        "Thomas: Good.",
        "Zende: Yes. Let's do it.",
        "Thomas: Done. Get on it. Get outta here.",
        "Zende: All right. [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: Thomas... I hope you really are happy for your dad and Caroline. I know that you two used to be involved.",
        "Thomas: That ended a long time ago.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I wouldn't have told you about the vasectomy if I thought you were gonna hold it over my head.",
        "Brooke: No, Ridge, I'm not doing that. I just want you to be straight with Caroline.",
        "Ridge: Oh, and if I'm not, if I don't think this is the right time, you're gonna do it? Where do you get off?",
        "Brooke: I'm a mother. My children are so precious to me. I know what Caroline is going through.",
        "Ridge: Caroline is getting married. She is happy.",
        "Brooke: But you promised her a family -- a family that she wants so desperately, and you may not be able to give that to her.",
        "Ridge: I don't know that I can't give it to her, so what are we talking about?",
        "Brooke: Exactly my point. I know where this is coming from. You never wanna disappoint the woman that you're with. You wanna move heaven and earth to make her happy. I get that. I know. I've been there, Ridge. You've done that for me many times. But this is different. Vasectomies can't always be reversed. I hope yours can. But to start a marriage, a relationship, keeping a secret? Caroline deserves to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Oh, hey.",
        "Thomas: Hey. Sorry.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Thomas: Didn't mean to --",
        "Caroline: No, it's okay. I was just, um, running to the restroom really quickly.",
        "Thomas: Ah. Are you coming back?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I'm in the middle of designing something, so...",
        "Thomas: Me, too.",
        "Caroline: Ah.",
        "Thomas: Unless that's a problem.",
        "Caroline: Why?",
        "Thomas: You know, us sharing an office.",
        "Caroline: No. No problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Are you sure I'm doing this right? I'm not feeling the burn.",
        "Zende: [Exhales] You will. Keep at it.",
        "Nicole: Maybe I should try a heavier weight.",
        "Zende: You don't wanna strain anything.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, but at this rate...",
        "[Weight thuds]",
        "Zende: [Grunts] That's too heavy. You'll hurt yourself.",
        "Nicole: No way. I am a lot stronger than I look, thank you.",
        "Zende: Okay, maybe, but I'm not willing to chance it, all right?",
        "Nicole: Since when did you get so protective?",
        "Zende: [Sighs] I don't know. What can I say? I look out for my peeps.",
        "Nicole: Your peeps? Is that what I am to you?",
        "Zende: Do you prefer \"partner in crime\"?",
        "Nicole: I prefer... you know what? Never mind. If I have to pull it out of you, what's the point?",
        "Zende: Uh-oh. Okay, what did I do?",
        "Nicole: Nothing. It's just guys are so clueless sometimes.",
        "Zende: Or maybe we want the opposite sex to think that we are. So we can mess with your beautiful heads.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] So...break's almost over. Don't want Thomas to think that we're slacking.",
        "Zende: Right. Hey, you think he was serious about before?",
        "Nicole: About...what?",
        "Zende: You know, him and I working closely together, the whole next generation of Forrester thing.",
        "Nicole: If he said it, he must mean it. Then again...",
        "Zende: What?",
        "Nicole: When it comes to Caroline and his dad, I'm not so sure.",
        "Zende: Okay, you've lost me.",
        "Nicole: See? Clueless. He says that he's happy for them, and I...guess he is, but...I don't know. I just can't shake the feeling that something else is going on with Thomas where Caroline's concerned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You through psychoanalyzing me?",
        "Brooke: I just want what's best for you and Caroline.",
        "Ridge: Oh, you do? And you, Brooke Logan, you know exactly what that is.",
        "Brooke: I certainly know that if I were Caroline, I wouldn't wanna be left in the dark about something so critical to my future.",
        "Ridge: I'm not keeping her in the dark. I don't see it that way.",
        "Brooke: Because you're not looking from Caroline's perspective -- not from any woman's perspective.",
        "Ridge: I've put her through enough. She's been through enough, and this is not necessary. Vasectomies can be reversed.",
        "Brooke: Sometimes they can't. I've done research. Have you?",
        "Ridge: Yes. I-I will. I have things to do.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: I've gotta focus on this.",
        "Brooke: What things do you have?",
        "Ridge: I'm running a company. I have responsibilities.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Well, you're not married yet. There's still time to tell her, even though you want this child --",
        "Ridge: You were standing right here. I told you that there are no guarantees.",
        "Brooke: Yes, but she doesn't know why. She doesn't know why that pregnancy might not be possible. And as a mother, as a woman, I would wanna know. Why would Caroline be any different?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Hey, so I just ran into Pam, and she said to tell you that she's got lemon bars on her desk with your name on 'em?",
        "Thomas: You're speaking figuratively, right?",
        "Caroline: No, like, she literally wrote your name in vanilla frosting on each one, like, \"Thomas Forrester,\" \"Thomas Forrester.\"",
        "Thomas: Oh, come on. No, no, no, no, no. That -- [Laughs] That can't even happen right now. She's writing my name on...",
        "Caroline: I couldn't help it. That was kinda funny.",
        "Thomas: Oh, come on. For real?",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: It's great seeing you this way. It's been a while.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, well, we... we both know why that is.",
        "Thomas: I'm really sorry about what happened. I never meant to --",
        "Caroline: No, I -- listen. I know. I know that. It's...it's just that I was -- I was kind of worried, um...",
        "Thomas: About Dad...",
        "Caroline: Uh, I was worried uh, that... I might be pregnant? But I-I'm not now. There's like no question about that, and, uh, so it's all good, but I guess I just -- I wanted you to know if, uh, if you had any concerns that that's -- we're -- it's...",
        "Thomas: I didn't have any concerns. You're saying that... that you did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Zende: Don't take it the wrong way. But I think you should be careful.",
        "Nicole: About what?",
        "Zende: Talking about Caroline and Thomas. I mean, his dad is C.E.O. If something inadvertently...",
        "Nicole: Yeah. I'd be in some serious...",
        "Zende: Yeah. Not saying that you would intentionally, you know, do anything to cause trouble.",
        "Nicole: No way. Ridge give me a second chance with this internship, and I'm not gonna blow it.",
        "Zende: Good, because I like having you around.",
        "Nicole: Oh, yeah?",
        "Zende: Yeah. It just wouldn't be the same without you.",
        "Nicole: Nice to know I'd be missed.",
        "Zende: You don't know how much.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Zende: They need us in the sewing room. We should probably get changed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I probably should have handled this differently.",
        "Ridge: You think?",
        "Brooke: I know you don't like to be pressured, but...",
        "Ridge: No, I know. I know you just wanted to, uh, have your say as a woman. Say what you think about Caroline -- you wouldn't just do this 'cause you like to stir things up. That's not you.",
        "Brooke: Have you talked to your doctor about having the vasectomy reversed?",
        "Ridge: Not yet.",
        "Brooke: Have you been online? Done any research at all?",
        "Ridge: I'm gonna do all of that.",
        "Brooke: Because, apparently, the longer you wait, the harder it is --",
        "Ridge: I understand. I got it. And I will get to it. Right now I've got a wedding to plan, and I... [Sighs] I told her we're gonna have a kid within the next year, if all goes well.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Well, I hope it works out for you, for both your sakes. But if it doesn't work out like that, I mean --",
        "Ridge: I'm not thinking about it that way. I can't. And I don't wanna worry her unnecessarily, and you know what? I don't want you to do that either. So let's keep that between us. Understood?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Caroline, why -- why didn't you tell me that you had concerns?",
        "Caroline: Because I didn't know, not really. You know how sometimes your mind just goes to the worst-case scenario? What happened between us that night was a terrible mistake, and if I would've gotten pregnant, I... thankfully, now I know I'm not. You don't have to worry about it at all.",
        "Thomas: I still can't believe what happened that night. I had no idea that you'd taken that anti-anxiety medicine, that you weren't even yourself. I...Caroline, I never would have taken advantage of you or any woman, for that matter. I'm not that guy. You know that.",
        "Caroline: I know -- I know that. I told you that, and I mean it.",
        "Thomas: I just feel awful. I'm so sorry that you had to go through all of this.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: You know, part of me can't help but wonder what would have happened if you and I... but I'm happy. I'm happy for you, Caroline. I want the best for you.",
        "Caroline: This is the last time we ever talk about that night. It's our secret, and no one will ever find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: This is my secret. No one else will know."
