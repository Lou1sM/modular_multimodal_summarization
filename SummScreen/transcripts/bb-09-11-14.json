        "Bill calls Liam and asks if they are still on for the big game tonight. It will cheer him up and help keep his mind off \"things\". Liam says yes he's looking forward to it. Bill grills him about seeing the girl he fished out of the river. Liam says yes they went to a party and it went well. Wyatt comes to see Bill so Bill lets Liam go and says he will see him tonight. Wyatt tells Bill that he would like a favor. He'd like to move into the cliff house with Hope. Bill says that is Liam's house. And why does he want it. Wyatt says it is bigger and Liam can have his place, sort of a bachelor pad. He'll even de- Wyatt the place and fill the frig with tofu and bean sprouts. Reluctantly Bill says okay, but he can't promise anything. Maya drops in on Caroline and asks about Ridge helping her. She calls Caroline lucky to have a mentor like Ridge. And since it is crunch time around here she is surprised that he has time for her or anyone, including Katie. When Katie comes in, Caroline says she hates how everyone is pressuring Ridge. He always comes through and this time will be no different. It will be another fabulous Ridge collection. Katie guesses Caroline knows. Caroline says yes he told her. Katie says good, she is glad he had her to confide in. Caroline says it has been good so far, he's taught her more than she ever learned in school. He's put her on a whole different level. He dresses women like he is in love with each and every one. He perfects everything. Katie says she is grateful to Caroline as this has been a nightmare. Hope walks into Ivy's office and there is silence for a few minutes. Finally Ivy starts to apologize for the other day. Hope says it is fine; Ivy had her say and so did Hope. All she wanted to get across was that it was too soon for Liam to be getting into another relationship, that's it. So they should just leave that alone and concentrate on the couture collection for now. However then she turns the conversation to the dinner party she heard about the other night. Ivy is low-key about it and says it was spur of the moment with all the normal suspects, Aly and Oliver, Rick and Caroline and Liam was there too. Hope says by invitation she assumes. Ivy tells Hope that they both want Liam to be happy again. Hope says that is why they need to leave him alone and let him sort this out. She knows Liam better than Ivy does and he is not ready to jump into another relationship so soon. He's been on that treadmill with her for years. Ivy says she does not think it is Liam, but Ivy as her last name is Forrester. But they could work well together and she knows that is what Hope would want also for Liam and Wyatt. Hope says yes she would not have it any other way.",
        "Bill shows up at the cliff house a little early ..pizza, bucket of chicken wings, he's all pumped up for Thursday night football with the Ravens and the Steelers. He knows it's early but this is a pre-game meal. He chows down on several chicken wings; tells Liam that the pizza is half veggies so he can eat that too. Bill gets around to Liam getting back in the game and not spend all his time way out here moping, maybe he should move aback into the city. He says he spent too much time here with Hope and it's time to move on. This could become a mauso-Liam. He even yells at Liam and tells him it's over with Hope and it's time to move on. Somewhere out there is a woman but he will never find her camping out here. Liam says he is trying too hard on the hard sell. He likes it out here; it's quiet and peaceful. Bill says yes there is an issue ..Wyatt wants to move in here with Hope. Wyatt finds Hope in Ivy's office and says he has some good news for her. He still has some details to work out. Liam is appalled that Wyatt wants his house. Bill reminds him that technically it is his house and that is why Wyatt came to him first. Liam throws a chicken wing at him when he is sure Bill must have said yes to Wyatt. Bill says no, he told him it would be difficult. Liam is also stunned when he hears they might be starting a family, but .why rush it. He is not moving out period, it's that simple. Wyatt shows up at the cliff house with a bottle of bubbly and says it's a housewarming gift ..Liam is moving. He assumes he has heard. They get into an argument about Wyatt being an opportunist and marrying Hope and Liam being a no-show in Paris. Wyatt says it is just a matter of square footage here. They need the space and Liam doesn't. Liam says he knows better than that. Wyatt just wants to gobble up everything that is his. Liam points both hands at Wyatt, stamps his feet and says this land is sacred, the history, the memories and Wyatt is not taking it from him. Wyatt argues that is not taking anything, only exchanging, quid pro quo. Liam says he can keep his quid and he'll keep his quo, he is NOT getting the house. He's already taken Hope from him and this house is all he has left and it will NEVER ever be Wyatt's."

        "Bill: Good. What better to cheer you up, get your mind off other things?",
        "Liam: Right.",
        "Bill: So, uh, I hear you've been spending some time with the girl you fished out of the river. How's that going?",
        "Liam: It's good. We, uh -- we went to a party.",
        "Bill: Well, how did it go? Did you have a good time?",
        "Liam: Yeah, you know, I needed to get out of the house, so...",
        "Bill: Well, I'm glad you did. All right, listen, I've got to go. I'll see you tonight for the big game. Okay. Hey. What's going on?",
        "Wyatt: Hey, uh, I know you're busy...",
        "Bill: Never too busy for one of my boys.",
        "Wyatt: Good, 'cause I-I have a favor to ask.",
        "Bill: Shoot.",
        "Wyatt: I want to...move in to the Spencer cliff house with Hope.",
        "Bill: It's Liam's house.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Hey.",
        "Hope: Hey. How's it going?",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah. Good. Still waiting on these Couture designs.",
        "Hope: Mm.",
        "Ivy: Hope, look, about the other day --",
        "Hope: It's fine. No. You said your piece, I said mine.",
        "Ivy: I really didn't mean any disrespect.",
        "Hope: Look, Ivy, it's, um... it's just that Liam needs to take more time before jumping in to another relationship. That's it. All right? But let's just not even talk about it. Let's focus on business. So...let's talk about Couture.",
        "Ivy: Uh, okay. Well, uh, [Chuckles] Look, I really can't start accessorizing until I get the designs in, so do you have any idea when Ridge is ready to show us something?",
        "Hope: Um, no. I know that he was in the office with Caroline.",
        "Ivy: Are they working on it together?",
        "Hope: I'm not sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Maya: Oh. I didn't expect to see you in here.",
        "Caroline: You looking for Ridge? 'Cause he left.",
        "Maya: You two have a meeting?",
        "Caroline: No. He just was, um...helping me with some of my design work.",
        "Maya: Mm. Lucky you. I mean, Ridge is the best, right? It would be great to have Ridge as a mentor. It is a little strange, though.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Maya: Well, it's crunch time, Caroline. We need that collection. [Scoffs] I'm surprised Ridge has time for you or...anyone... even Katie.",
        "Caroline: Ridge will deliver.",
        "Maya: Wow. Really seems like you're his right hand.",
        "Caroline: I just -- I help wherever I'm needed.",
        "Maya: And he needs help?",
        "Caroline: What is with all the questions, Maya?",
        "Maya: Please. I am not on the attack, Caroline. I'm glad you're spending time with Ridge. After all, you're the future. I mean, one day, maybe you'll be designing our Couture collection.",
        "Caroline: Okay, well, thank you for the compliment, if that's what that is. But Ridge has a lot of years ahead of him.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Caroline: Hey, Katie.",
        "Katie: Uh, is Ridge around?",
        "Caroline: Uh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Why do you want to move in to Liam's place?",
        "Wyatt: It's bigger.",
        "Bill: What?!",
        "Wyatt: He's single. I'm married. He doesn't need all that space.",
        "Bill: Well, you don't, either.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Bill: I lived in that house with Katie.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Oh, wait a minute. You're not about to tell me that Hope's pregnant already, are you?",
        "Wyatt: Grandpa Dollar Bill? [Chuckles] Yeah, that'll blow a few minds. All right. And, no, not yet, but it could happen. It's good to be prepared. Hey, it's not like I'm asking him to live under a bridge, all right? He could take my place. It's more of a bachelor pad anyway.",
        "Bill: I-I don't think that Liam wants to think of himself as living in a bachelor pad.",
        "Wyatt: Well, maybe that's the problem. He lost the girl fair and square, right? Isn't that what you've been telling him?",
        "Bill: It was.",
        "Wyatt: Look, [Scoffs] Just talk to him, okay? It's not good for him, living over there all alone where he once lived with Hope. It's -- maybe this will help him move on -- a fresh start at the beach house. I'll even de-Wyatt the place and fill the fridge full of tofu and bean sprouts.",
        "Bill: Okay, okay. Okay. I -- [Sighs] I'll talk to him. But I can't promise anything.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Thanks. And, hey, I hear he's been trolling a bit. Ivy Forrester?",
        "Bill: Yeah. I just wish she had a different last name.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: So, I heard you had a little dinner party the other night.",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah. It was just a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.",
        "Hope: Any...special occasion?",
        "Ivy: No. Not really.",
        "Hope: Who all was there?",
        "Ivy: Ah, you know, just the usual suspects -- Caroline was there, Rick, Aly. We're all so busy, it's really hard to find time to hang out.",
        "Hope: Mm, yeah, yeah. So, it was just the four of you?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Yeah, Oliver was there, as well, and, um -- and, uh...Liam came, too.",
        "Hope: By invitation, I assume.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Your fianc\u00e9 -- what a talent.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, he says you have a bit of that, as well.",
        "Caroline: Well, he definitely brings it out in me.",
        "Katie: And, uh, you were here with them?",
        "Maya: No. No, I was just passing by, thought I'd check in. Everyone's waiting on those Couture designs.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, well, everyone will have to be patient. Ridge is doing his best.",
        "Katie: Yes, he is.",
        "Maya: Well, I better be getting back to work. Nice to see you, Katie.",
        "Katie: You, too.",
        "Caroline: I don't like the way that everybody's pressuring Ridge. I mean, he always comes through.",
        "Katie: Yes, he does. And he will.",
        "Caroline: This time will be no different. It will be another fabulous Ridge Forrester collection.",
        "Katie: Why wouldn't it be?",
        "Caroline: Right.",
        "Katie: You know, don't you? Ridge told you.",
        "Caroline: That he can't draw? Yeah, he told me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Hope, I care about Liam just as much as you do.",
        "Hope: Okay, then you want what's best for him. Well, what's best for him is to sort this out on his own.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, and I want to help him do that. Isn't that what we both want -- just to see him happy again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Bill: Hey. Go long! We'll work on that. Thursday night football, baby! Ravens, Steelers, tonight. I am so pumped! Are you ready?",
        "Liam: I'm pumped, I'm ready, I'm, uh -- it's a little early for football, though, isn't it?",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? It's a pre-game meal. Don't worry. The pizza's half veggie. You can eat it.",
        "Liam: Little early for that, too.",
        "Bill: Well, I-I could leave it here and come back later. Or -- or we could, uh...go watch the game at my place.",
        "Liam: Why? Why not here?",
        "Bill: You know, just this place is kind of, uh -- kind of cavernous.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that's why they call it a \"fan cave.\"",
        "Bill: Or, in this case, a \"mauso-Liam.\"",
        "Liam: Ah!",
        "Bill: Or maybe a shrine to someone.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I-I got to change that desktop eventually.",
        "Bill: Got to do a lot more than that, Liam.",
        "Liam: I know. I know, Dad. I'm -- I'm working on it.",
        "Bill: Let me ask you something. Um... you ever think of moving back into the city?",
        "Liam: The city?",
        "Bill: Where the action is.",
        "Liam: Uh...",
        "Bill: You're young, you're single -- you got to get back in the game.",
        "Liam: It's not really me, Dad.",
        "Bill: What's you? I mean, being all the way out here? Walking around this big, empty house, moping?",
        "Liam: Well, I like it out here. It's -- it's peaceful.",
        "Bill: I guess what I'm saying is... you're fresh out of a relationship. You spent a lot of time here with Hope. You know, wouldn't it be a good idea to get kind of a...maybe a fresh start?",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm not really ready for that.",
        "Bill: Well, get ready for it, Liam! All right? It's over. It's done. You got to move on. You know, there's a woman out there for you, but you're not gonna find her camped out here on this cliff side. You got to get out of this place.",
        "Liam: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Liam: What's with the hard sell? Where is this coming from?",
        "Bill: Not a hard sell. It's just that... all right, well...maybe it's a little bit of a hard sell. There's, uh...an issue.",
        "Liam: Issue? What? What issue?",
        "Bill: Your -- your brother stopped by my office, and, uh... he wants to... you know...[Muffled] Move back in here with Hope.",
        "Liam: Uh, what?",
        "Bill: He wants to move in here with Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Yes, we both want Liam to be happy, but I know him better than you do, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I realize that.",
        "Hope: Okay. So believe me when I tell you that he does not need to jump into a romantic relationship right now. He's been running the treadmill with me for years.",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, if that's what he needs, then that's what I'll give him.",
        "Hope: I wonder if you can be that objective.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] It's me, isn't it? It's me you don't like. It's my last name -- Forrester.",
        "Wyatt: Aha. Just the person I was looking for.",
        "Ivy: Oh, I'm flattered.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Actually, uh, I meant my wife here.",
        "Ivy: Oh, should have guessed.",
        "Hope: So...what's going on?",
        "Wyatt: I have some good news.",
        "Hope: Mm. Tell me.",
        "Wyatt: Mm, well, it's kind of a surprise, and I...kind of have to work out some of the details first, but...",
        "Hope: Okay, well, color me fascinated.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, good.",
        "Hope: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Wyatt wants my house?!",
        "Bill: Well, if we're gonna be accurate, Wyatt wants my house.",
        "Liam: Your house? Wha-whatever. I'm the one who lives here. Why didn't he come to me first?",
        "Bill: Because it's my house.",
        "Liam: Oh, come on! That's lame and you know it.",
        "Bill: Now, listen, don't get upset, all right? Listen. Here. Have a wing. You'll feel better.",
        "Liam: I hope you told him \"no.\" You told him \"yes!\"",
        "Bill: No! No, no, no. Listen to me. No, I said that I was going to talk to you, so can I do that?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Can I just -- can I talk to you?",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: First of all, Wyatt is...married, and you're not.",
        "Liam: What the Hell does that have to do with moving in here?!",
        "Wyatt: There's two of them. There's more space.",
        "Liam: Oh, 'cause the beach house is so small.",
        "Bill: For a family.",
        "Liam: A family?",
        "Bill: They're...thinking about it.",
        "Liam: Wait, wait. Dad... is she pregnant?",
        "Bill: No! No.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Okay, all right, then what's the rush? I mean, they can find their own damn house.",
        "Bill: What's the point of that? I mean, the beach house is great, right? All the peace and tranquility that you want. Or you could do what I suggested and move back into the city. How about that?",
        "Liam: No, no. You know -- you know this isn't about the beach house, Dad. This is about Wyatt taking everything from me. Well, I'm not moving out. Period.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I know that Ridge doesn't want anybody to find out, and they won't, not from me.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Thank you.",
        "Caroline: For what?",
        "Katie: Well, I've been wanting Ridge to...tell someone about this. And I'm glad that he did. I'm glad that he was able to confide in you.",
        "Caroline: I actually just kind of figured it out on my own.",
        "Katie: Right. You two are working closely together, so I'm sure you were bound to notice.",
        "Caroline: He just -- he couldn't sketch, not without guiding my hand. He's -- he's such a genius, Katie. I mean, he has taught me more in the last few days than I ever learned in school.",
        "Katie: And you've taught him how to be a mentor. You've opened him up.",
        "Caroline: He's gonna get through this, Katie. I know he will.",
        "Katie: Yeah, he will. And I really am grateful. This has been a nightmare, and he really needed a breakthrough.",
        "Caroline: I'm the one who's grateful. I mean, I always knew that I was pretty good, but Ridge -- he's -- he's on this whole other different level. You know, all of his designs, every single one of them, it's like he knows what a woman wants to feel or what she needs to be beautiful. He dresses women like -- like he loves every single one of them. You know, when he was guiding my hand, I felt this -- this surge of energy. His lines, the way he perfected everything, it was all Ridge, but...it was me, too. He changed my career, Katie. He changed my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Greetings, brother. Uh, I have a housewarming gift for you. You're moving. I assume you heard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Imagine -- me, crazy little Caroline, being able to give something back to a man like Ridge. I just -- I want to see him get his gift back. And anything I can do, I-I will.",
        "Katie: You've given him back his confidence.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] Me, giving Ridge confidence -- it's -- [Chuckles] It's unreal.",
        "Katie: But it is real. You're a talented designer, and Ridge recognizes that. You can help him.",
        "Caroline: That is what I'm doing, isn't it?",
        "Katie: Yes. And I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. You've given him something that even I couldn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Don't worry about Liam.",
        "Hope: I don't worry about him. I care about him. Liam needs time to heal, okay? And then he can go on. Just...please keep that in mind.",
        "Ivy: I will. I do. Hope, look we want the same things. Look, we could do great work together. We should be able to get along... just like what you want for Wyatt and Liam.",
        "Hope: And they will get along. [Chuckles] I won't have it any other way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I'm not moving out, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: See, you're being stubborn right now, and -- and I get it, and I know why.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] No, no, no. No, no. This has nothing to do with you marrying Hope. That was you being an opportunist.",
        "Wyatt: And you being a no-show again.",
        "Liam: What?! Whatever.",
        "Wyatt: You're upset about it, bro. I would be, too. But at a certain point, we got to get past all this. Hey, hey. I heard you shared a little kiss with, uh, Ivy Forrester, huh?",
        "Liam: Seriously?! That's your play? You're gonna bring Ivy into this?",
        "Wyatt: Liam... [Groans] It's -- it's really more of a square-footage issue here. You don't need all this space. We do.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah. Yeah, dad told me. You're planning a family. Let me ask you something. Is Hope in on these plans or is it just you?",
        "Wyatt: Please, I am not gonna argue with you about this.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that's right, because you know it's not really about family or kids or square footage. It's about you trying to gobble up everything that's mine.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. You -- you really need to talk to somebody.",
        "Liam: Oh, I'm talking. I'm talking to you. And I am telling you, flat out, [Stomps] This land is sacred -- the history, the memories. It was promised to me by my father, and you are not taking it from me.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not taking anything! I'm exchanging with you, quid pro quo.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you keep your quid, I'll keep my quo. You're not getting the house.",
        "Wyatt: Liam, you are being unreasonable right now.",
        "Liam: Why? Because I won't give up my home? Because I won't move out so you can have something else that's mine?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my --",
        "Liam: Wyatt, Wyatt, you already took Hope from me. This -- this is all I have left, and it will never, never be yours."
