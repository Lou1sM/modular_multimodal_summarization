    "Recap": [
        "Ivy tells Wyatt that she deleted the video so the least Steffy can do is be grateful and go along with her first photo shoot. Steffy and Liam discuss being surprised that her dad has agreed to more children to keep Caroline. But he has always been supportive so she can not turn on him now. Bill pops in just as Ridge and Caroline are kissing. Bill says he heard the good news .Ridge laments and he came all the way over to congratulate him. Bill says he has had a night to think about it so he'd like to think that Caroline has come to her senses. And if she were marrying anybody but Ridge he would throw her the party of the year. Bill tells Katie that this is Ridge. He always runs the other way. Caroline has Spencer blood coursing through her veins and he will do everything he can to keep her happy. That includes having a baby. Ridge says that has all been taken care of. Caroline tells her Uncle Bill that she knows they all love her and she appreciates that but she wants to assure them this is what she wants. And she just wants them to all tolerate each other and no tension. They are going to get married, so be friends. Bill tells Ridge for some unknown reason his niece is crazy about him so do not screw this up.",
        "While everyone is waiting, Steffy and Liam walk in and she tells Ivy there will not be a shoot today, at least not with her. When they all want an explanation, Steffy says she is the President and she is making some changes starting with the face of Forrester. Ivy says she thought when she deleted the video that meant they had all moved on. Steffy says it is plain and simple. Ivy's days of modeling here at Forrester are over before it started. Both Ivy and Wyatt are livid. Ivy says Steffy should be grateful. Steffy tells her to quit playing the victim. She manipulated her to get the job in first place. Liam agrees, and Ridge picked Steffy first so it is hers if she wants it. Ivy says Steffy is going against her word. Steffy says she gave Ivy a second chance but she never once said she would keep the position. Ivy tells Liam they are so wrapped up in their power trip they can not see anything else. Ivy even throws her last name in as she deserves this too. Wyatt tells them things can get uglier so they all need to take a rest. Steffy says she knew with Ivy's attitude they would have a hard time moving on. She can not trust her and as of now she no longer works at Forrester. She is fired. Caroline tells Ridge that is the way macho man Bill is, all wrapped up in his family. Ridge tells her that she is strong and needs no one that protective but if the day comes, he wants to be there. He wants to talk marriage; he does not want to wait any longer. Today, just the two of them. She was not expecting this. He suggests Malibu. Caroline is giddy."

        "Ivy: [Exhales deeply]",
        "Nicole: So Wyatt said that we need to organize all the shoes, looks, and accessories.",
        "Charlotte: Already did it. And everything's all hung up in order.",
        "Nicole: Great.",
        "Kristina: And hair and makeup are on their way for touch-ups.",
        "Zende: All right. I'd say the interns are on point today. I think we're ready for the shoot. Let's do it.",
        "Nicole: Question is, is anyone else?",
        "Ivy: Well, I just hope Steffy and Liam haven't forgotten.",
        "Wyatt: This is your first photo shoot as the new face of Forrester. This -- this -- you think the president and her VP are gonna miss this?",
        "Ivy: Well, right now, I just hope Steffy and I can put the past behind us. Look, I-I'm not saying that we're gonna be best friends or anything, but I did delete that video of her and Aly. At the very least, she could be grateful.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I agree.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: No wonder you didn't feel like talking much last night.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. I woke up this morning hoping that my dad would be dating an age-appropriate woman, not planning a wedding to Caroline. Dating was one thing.",
        "Liam: Hey, at least you like Caroline. You know, you get along with her, you respect her.",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah, she's great. Yeah, she's funny and smart. I just didn't think they'd actually go along with this.",
        "Liam: I'm actually surprised he's making such a commitment, too. I mean, after he ended the engagement with Katie, I kinda thought Ridge wouldn't wanna marry again.",
        "Steffy: Neither did I. But then again, I never imagined my dad would wanna have more children, and now he wants one with Caroline.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: So I think we just need to add a little more fabric to the back of the bodice.",
        "Ridge: Like that?",
        "Caroline: Exactly what I was thinking.",
        "Ridge: Aha! I may not be half-bad at that after all.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. You're all right. You show promise. Keep working hard. This though...",
        "Ridge: [Gasps]",
        "Caroline: [Laughs] What?",
        "Ridge: Nothing. Just happy.",
        "Bill: Oh, great. You ever get anything accomplished around here with all that?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs deeply]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Bill: So my niece gave us the breaking news. You popped the question.",
        "Ridge: And you came all the way over here to congratulate me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Ugh. I'm trying to picture my dad changing diapers again.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, it's an adjustment -- expanding the family, the engagement.",
        "Steffy: It's a lot. I'm not gonna lie. I'm trying to make peace with it. But if he's happy, then I'm happy.",
        "Liam: Good. Glad to hear that.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, he's always been supportive. It wouldn't be fair to turn my back on him.",
        "Liam: I mean, all things considered, we're in a pretty good place right now. You and I have never been better. The company's thriving. No video.",
        "Steffy: Oh, God. That -- that went on for way too long...",
        "Liam: Oh.",
        "Steffy: Ivy holding that over my head. Which reminds me... we have to get to the photo shoot.",
        "Liam: Ah, yes. Ivy's first as the new face of Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You had the night to think about it. Tell me you came to your senses.",
        "Caroline: Oh, let me think. Uh... mnh?",
        "Katie: Um, bravo on the ring, by the way.",
        "Ridge: Thanks.",
        "Bill: Craft store run out of all the red string.",
        "Caroline: Wow.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Uh, anyway, it's -- it's a really nice ring.",
        "Caroline: I'm not complaining.",
        "Katie: Okay, well, we just came by to say congratulations. So, um...",
        "Ridge: Hey, what about you? You gonna throw us a party?",
        "Bill: Oh, you kiddin'? I'd throw the party of the year... if Caroline was marrying anybody but you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, it's great. Perfect.",
        "Charlotte: And then we also decided on this bracelet.",
        "Wyatt: Nice.",
        "Nicole: It's looking good, though.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I definitely think that'll go well with the necklace.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, that's it.",
        "Charlotte: And it'll just add a nice shine.",

        "Charlotte: Oh, and this is for the first look.",
        "Ivy: Oh, thank you. Oh!",
        "Wyatt: You are gonna knock this out of the park. Trust me.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: You are.",
        "Zende: Hey, guys, still nothing.",
        "Ivy: Are you kidding me? He was supposed to be here, like, an hour ago.",
        "Wyatt: I -- hey, there you are! We're just about ready here. And we haven't heard from Oliver. Have you guys seen him?",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I talked to him earlier today.",
        "Ivy: What did he say?",
        "Steffy: I told him not to come in.",
        "Ivy: Why?",
        "Steffy: Because there won't be a shoot today... not with you.",
        "Wyatt: Wait. You're canceling the shoot? Did you know about this?",
        "Liam: It's Steffy's call.",
        "Steffy: I'm sorry, everyone. I know a lot of you have put in extra hours this week, and I really want you to know that I appreciate it.",
        "Zende: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, what is going on? Has something happened?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, you can't just cancel the shoot out of nowhere. We have a deadline. This campaign needs to be shot.",
        "Steffy: Then we'll reschedule.",
        "Ivy: But why? You haven't given us an explanation.",
        "Liam: Okay, well, before -- um, can you guys start packing everything up, break everything down?",
        "Nicole: Yes. No problem.",
        "Liam: Thanks.",
        "Wyatt: W-- hold on a second. This has been on the schedule for days. You've already approved the images. Now what is -- what's the problem?",
        "Ivy: Should I go speak to Ridge?",
        "Steffy: I don't think that'd be to your benefit.",
        "Wyatt: This is insane. I'm to gonna stay here and play guessing games with you two.",
        "Liam: Well... [Sighs] You're free to leave any time you want, Wyatt.",
        "Ivy: Okay, Steffy, what is going on? I'm so confused right now.",
        "Steffy: I'm president of this company. I'm making some changes. Number one on my list is the face of Forrester.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs deeply]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Look, we all know that Bill is very protective of you. And I think that's a good thing.",
        "Ridge: But you're a capable woman. You don't need protection, do you?",
        "Bill: All right, look. You know how protective you are of Steffy? Well, that's how I feel about Caroline. She may be my niece, but I love her like a daughter. And she doesn't have a father to look after her, but she's got me.",
        "Ridge: I didn't say you shouldn't look after her. I said you're not gonna control the situation.",
        "Bill: Caroline's a Spencer. That means she has my blood coursing through her veins. Now you know that I am protective of my own, especially from a predator like you.",
        "Katie: Okay! Well, this has been super fun.",
        "Bill: He is a deserter, Katie. This is what he does. He runs the other way. I don't want him to do to Caroline what he did to you and Brooke and Taylor and --",
        "Ridge: All right, Uncle Bill!",
        "Bill: Would you like me to go on?",
        "Ridge: No, no, no, no, no. You're good. I don't owe you an explanation. For some weird reason, this one here has a soft spot in her heart for you. So I will say this -- there's nothing for you to be concerned about.",
        "Bill: That's a load of crap.",
        "Ridge: I will do everything in my power to keep her happy.",
        "Bill: Does that include having kids? Because if that's what she wants, you better be on the same page.",
        "Katie: Okay, well, um, I think maybe we should go since it's not any of our business.",
        "Ridge: You're right. It's not any of your business. But next year, we're gonna try and have a baby if all goes well. So like I just said...",
        "Bill: [Exhales deeply]",
        "Ridge: Nothing to worry about. It's all taken care of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Sorry for inconvenience, guys. Thank you.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, I thought we'd reached an agreement.",
        "Steffy: I was forced into declining the job, telling my father to make you the spokesmodel.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, look, I understand you're still upset about how things went down. And I get that, okay? On some level, I get it. But the fact of the matter is, Ivy deleted the video for you.",
        "Steffy: After she blackmailed me all that time.",
        "Wyatt: But she deleted it, all traces of it, because you asked her to!",
        "Liam: Okay, but you know it's not that simple. She was terrified she was gonna lose all of her freedom for something she didn't do.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God.",
        "Ivy: Oh! Liam, seriously? Are we really going to go over this again? I thought we'd moved on. I thought we'd buried all this.",
        "Steffy: We did move on. But what you did was reprehensible.",
        "Ivy: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Steffy: Do you honestly think I'm gonna reward you for that?",
        "Ivy: Steffy, you know what? Instead of tearing into me, you should be thanking me.",
        "Steffy: Wow. No, it's plain and simple, Ivy. Your modeling days are over here at Forrester.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I know that you're all looking out for me, and I really appreciate that. It makes me feel very loved. However, Uncle Bill, you have to trust me. You have to trust me and my judgment, and trust that I know what's best for me and who I wanna spend the rest of my life with. And that man is Ridge, and there's no doubt in my mind.",
        "Katie: Well, there you go. Can't put it any better than that. You know, I mean, I, much like everyone else, had my doubts. I mean, given the... obvious age difference. But...and your track record is a little --",
        "Ridge: Yeah, don't hold back. You should just say what you feel.",
        "Katie: But after seeing the two of you together and hearing your point of view, I, um, I am excited for your future. And, hey, you can sign me up to babysit any time.",
        "Caroline: Great. I will -- I will definitely do that. And -- and I'll call you all the time for -- for mommy tips.",
        "Katie: Awesome.",
        "Caroline: Great. So see? This is all I'm asking for, just for us to be civil. I just -- I just want everyone to merely tolerate each other, because truly, you two... are the most important men in my life, and I just don't want there to be any tension between you. And Ridge and I are getting married, and that's -- that's happy and wonderful. And we're gonna have a baby. So what do you say? Friends?",
        "Bill: Hell, no.",
        "Ridge: Oh, God, no.",
        "Caroline: Great. That went -- that was really great. It was worth it.",
        "Bill: All right, look. Uh... for some insane reason, my niece is crazy about you. Don't screw it up.",
        "Caroline: [Mouths word] Let's get a group hug going. Should we?",
        "Katie: No. No.",
        "Caroline: Great.",
        "Katie: Don't push it.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: This is not fair, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Neither was blackmailing me.",
        "Wyatt: Why do I feel like we're taking two steps backwards here?",
        "Liam: Okay, just go two seconds without interrupting her, please.",
        "Wyatt: Shut up!",
        "Ivy: Look, I deleted the video! I didn't have to do it, but I did it!",
        "Steffy: And you expect me to be grateful?",
        "Ivy: I expect you to at least act civil towards me, not come into work, throw your weight around, and then tell me that I'm no longer part of the face of Forrester.",
        "Steffy: You being the spokesmodel was never part of the plan.",
        "Wyatt: All right. I can see where this is headed. You're about to tell us that you're gonna become the new face of Forrester, not Ivy, right?",
        "Steffy: But I've been the face.",
        "Liam: Well, honestly, can you think of a reason she shouldn't? 'Cause Ridge was CEO. She was his first choice. And Ivy only got the job because she manipulated the situation.",
        "Ivy: [Laughs] Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Liam. That's really nice.",
        "Liam: No, you -- you tell me, Ivy. Am I speaking out of turn here? Because that is what happened, and we all know that.",
        "Steffy: You never earned the job, Ivy, and you don't deserve it. So stop playing the victim.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You got a lot of people that care about you.",
        "Caroline: Yes. I am very lucky.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, this went better than I anticipated.",
        "Caroline: No black eyes or bloody noses, so I would say it was a complete success.",
        "Ridge: With Spencer, you never know what's gonna happen.",
        "Caroline: I know how you feel about him, but... I don't know. I thought I was kinda cute.",
        "Ridge: Cute? Really? Eh.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I don't know. It's kinda sweet, like... him coming in here, thinking he's standing up for me.",
        "Ridge: [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: Doing the whole father figure thing.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. It all seems a little fake to me.",
        "Caroline: I know it's weird, but... Uncle Bill making threats and doing the whole, like, \"She's got my Spencer blood\" and \"I'll kill for my family\"... it's just his way of showing affection. You know, it -- it's just how he... that's how he is nurturing and supportive.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: That's just what he does. And it's all wrapped up in this very, like, macho man package.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. It's a lot.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: I stand by what I said. You are the strongest individual I know. You don't need anyone protecting you. You can do that all on your own. But if the day will ever come where you do need that, it's not gonna be from Bill. It'll come from me. [Growls]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: This is my company, run by my father and me.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, we know.",
        "Ivy: You're not holding up your end of the bargain, Steffy. You're going against your word.",
        "Steffy: Going against my word? I never once said you could be part of the campaign if you deleted the video.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] Well, it --",
        "Steffy: Never once.",
        "Ivy: It was inferred, obviously.",
        "Steffy: Inferred?",
        "Liam: Or else what? You wouldn't have erased it?",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, you were there when she got rid of the video. Did I make any promises? Did I? No. You we're talking about a second chance and cleaning the slate, and that's what I'm doing. I never once said that you get to keep the new position, Ivy. Not once.",
        "Ivy: You are so unbelievably petty.",
        "Steffy: Oh!",
        "Liam: All right, can we calm down and -- and pretend like we're all professionals here?",
        "Ivy: You know what? I was really hoping that things we're gonna be different around here. But you two are so caught up in your own power trip that you don't see anything else.",
        "Steffy: [Exhales deeply]",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, this isn't just hurting Ivy. This is hurting the company. The press releases have already gone out. Plus, it is way too soon after Aly's death for you to even go out front and center.",
        "Steffy: I disagree.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, this was my chance to step up as a Forrester. Or have you forgotten that that's my last name as well?",
        "Steffy: No, of course, you're a Forrester. But you have to earn the stripes, just like I did.",
        "Ivy: Oh, come -- don't even try that. I made a name for myself in Australia long before I even came to LA.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, you did. And then you tried to get ahead by blackmailing me. You said that I committed a crime. You told me that I killed Aly. It was obvious that it was self-defense. I'm trying to fix things, so you're gonna have to deal with the consequences.",
        "Ivy: What does that mean?",
        "Wyatt: Okay, we're already all worked up here. So just take a minute, get some air, take a breath. You know, before things get uglier",
        "Ivy: No. No. Steffy, if you have something to say to me, say it right now.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] You know what? I knew it was gonna be very challenging for us to work together and move on. After everything that's happened, your attitude...",
        "Ivy: My -- my attitude?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Ivy, I don't trust you. I don't. And you can't work with someone that you don't trust. And for that reason, you are no longer welcome at Forrester. You're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I meant what I said. I wanna give you the life you deserve -- a child and a family. And this ring, this was a symbol of my commitment to our future.",
        "Ridge: I've been thinking a lot about our wedding day.",
        "Caroline: Have you?",
        "Ridge: Yes, I have.",
        "Caroline: Mmm!",
        "Ridge: Absolutely. And I thought about this whole... I mean, friends, everyone getting together and... I don't -- I don't think that's us. It's always been kinda just you and me against the world, you know? I... I wanna keep it that way. So what do you think? You, me, secluded place with... and incredible view?",
        "Caroline: Do you have a place in mind in particular?",
        "Ridge: I do have a place in mind in particular. A friend of mine's place. Just you and me, no one else.",
        "Caroline: No minister?",
        "Ridge: No, don't need it.",
        "Caroline: So -- so... no minister or -- what about our vows?",
        "Ridge: Just make 'em up.",
        "Caroline: Just make 'em up on the spot? I'm not gonna know what to say.",
        "Ridge: Well... just hold on to me, onto my hand. I wanna be connected like this forever. I just wanna be your husband. And I don't wanna wait anymore. Let's do this. Let's do this today.",
        "Caroline: Today?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, today. This afternoon. Wanna?",
        "Caroline: In a few hours?",
        "Ridge: Uh-huh. What do you think? What, you don't trust me? Come on!",
        "Caroline: No! No! I very much trust you. I wasn't expecting that.",
        "Ridge: Why weren't you expecting it? I just wanna be with you. So let's do this. What do you say?",
        "Caroline: Where?",
        "Ridge: The most beautiful place in the world -- Malibu.",
        "[Sea birds calling]",
        "Caroline: We're gonna get married...today?",
        "Ridge: Today.",
        "Caroline: In Malibu?",
        "Ridge: In Malibu. Mmm. Yeah?",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm!",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
