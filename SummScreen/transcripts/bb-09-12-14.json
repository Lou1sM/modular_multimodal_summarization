        "Wyatt explains that this is not a conspiracy. He and Hope just need more space. Liam mentions him passing off Bu to him but this is not going to work. Bill will not throw him out of his house. Is it insecurity or greed. Wyatt says he and Hope have more plans and this place is perfect for them and he thinks Hope will be excited about this too, a place for their kids to play outside. Charlie has a whole wall set up of \"suspects\" of Quinn, Paris trip, Ivy falling, trying to piece the puzzle together. He asks Pam if she'd like to see Hope and Liam back together. She says yes of course, but it is a little crazy. He says it might turn out to be nothing but Quinn is capable of this and she might have found out about Paris and it was she that pushed Ivy into the Seine. He does some checking and finds customs did show Quinn went to Paris that day, same day that Ivy fell into the Seine. He finds a French girl who set up the shooting for the photo shoot and they had cameras everywhere. They need something that even Quinn can not talk herself out of. Pam wants to call Liam and warn him that Quinn was in Paris at the same time. Charlie says no, you don't poke a snake until you are ready to strike. He looks at the footage and they do spot Quinn on the stolen bike and where she is following Liam and Ivy in the cab.",
        "Quinn visits Bill and he tells her that he has no problem with secrets but her manipulation is gonna stop. She continues that she did everybody a favor. Hope and Ivy continue their conversation of what is best for Liam. Ivy gets Hope to admit that she does love Wyatt. Ivy feels that is her answer. She should leave Liam's love life alone. While he is deeply thinking about Hope, Ivy walks in on Liam. She says the door was open so she came on in. Pam tells Charlie that she is really proud of him following his gut feeling. Quinn again - they saw her bump Ivy into the river. Wyatt warns Hope that the surprise is pretty big, but it's not quite ready. He wants them to move into the cliff house. Liam explains his mood is that Wyatt wants to move into his house. He's all ready to start a platoon of little me me's. Liam says he thought he was ready and pretty close but this really hit him. There is a heavy banging at the door and it's Pam and Charlie who tell Liam they have something to show him and he will never believe this. Bill tells Quinn that she got what she wanted; back off, no more games. She says Liam is safe, she has no reason to go after him anymore. She says no one is gonna find out she pushed Ivy. Hope is shocked that Wyatt wants to live at Liam's where she has a ton of memories with her ex. He says they can make new memories. And it has everything he wants for his family. She is surprised at that. He says it does not have to be today or next week, but he is ready. Pam and Charlie question Ivy about her fall. They explain it was not Ivy they were after, but Hope. She was right there in Liam's sight and Quinn did not want him to get to her. They show them the footage .it was not some act of fate, it was Quinn!"

        "Wyatt: Whoa. Dude, I'm not taking anything from you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, especially not my house.",
        "Wyatt: Technically, it's not your house. It's Dad's.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, you really think Dad is gonna kick me out?",
        "Wyatt: I'm not out to get you, Liam. This isn't part of some kind of conspiracy to ruin your life. Hope and I just need a bigger place.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah, yeah. And, magically, it has to be this one. You didn't even want 'Bu around, because he reminds Hope of our life together! And now suddenly you want an entire house full of those memories?",
        "Wyatt: You know, this may be hard for you to believe, but we're gonna fill it with our own.",
        "Liam: Oh --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I don't see why this has become such an issue for us. Hope, we do amazing work together. We want the same thing for Liam, so I don't know why we have to be at odds with each other.",
        "Hope: Neither do I. If you can agree with me that Liam needs to take some time.",
        "Ivy: Look, I obviously don't know the Liam you know, but the guy who jumped in the river to save me didn't seem to have a problem with making quick decisions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Here.",
        "Bill: What's that?",
        "Quinn: My way of saying \"Thank you.\" Drink it.",
        "Bill: I'll pass.",
        "Quinn: You are still keeping my secret, right?",
        "Bill: Only because stirring up everything isn't going to benefit anyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Oh, there you are!",
        "Charlie: Hey.",
        "Pam: You been hiding from me?",
        "Charlie: Uh, yeah. No, no, no. I'm, um, I'm waiting on a text here.",
        "Pam: Yeah? From who?",
        "Charlie: Uh, a guy I know. Um, works in, uh, customs. Look, I-I wasn't gonna say anything until I knew something for sure.",
        "Pam: Charlie, are you getting me a present?",
        "Charlie: Well, sort of. I mean, how would you like to see Hope and Liam back together again?",
        "Pam: Oh, I'd love to, but it's never gonna happen.",
        "Charlie: Well, it might. Especially if Quinn pushed Ivy into the Seine.",
        "Pam: What? [Scoffs] Charlie, she wasn't even in Paris. Was she?",
        "Charlie: That's what I'm trying to find out. And if she was, there will be a record of it. And, Pammy, that could change everything.",
        "Pam: [Scoffs] I don't know, Charlie. It's a little crazy.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I know, but every time I think about Ivy's accident, I-I get a little hitch in my giddyup. And I just can't ignore it anymore.",
        "Pam: How would Quinn even know that Liam was going to Paris?",
        "Charlie: I don't know, Pammy. I'm just working on a hunch here. It could turn out to be nothing. But don't tell me Quinn isn't capable of this, because we both know she is.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Charlie: There it is.",
        "Pam: What? Did you find something?",
        "Charlie: It's a customs document.",
        "Pam: [Gasps]",
        "Charlie: I knew it.",
        "Pam: Charlie! You were right!",
        "Charlie: Quinn went through customs the same day Ivy did her nosedive into the Seine. The dates and the times are right there.",
        "Pam: But, Charlie, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. It still doesn't prove that she had anything to do with Ivy's fall.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, lucky for us, big cities are full of cameras. And if Quinn was anywhere in that area, I got somebody that can find it.",
        "Pam: You do?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I'm not ashamed of what I did, Bill.",
        "Bill: You just don't want anyone to know what you did.",
        "Quinn: If I hadn't pushed Ivy off that bridge, our son might not be where he is right now.",
        "Bill: Wyatt's married to Hope because she accepted his proposal. You put him in the position to make the offer. That's the only reason I'm keeping your secret. Not because I approve of what you did.",
        "Quinn: Who knew you were such a romantic?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You can tell a lot about a person by the decisions they make.",
        "Hope: Yeah. I agree.",
        "Ivy: Liam made a decision when he jumped in the water to save me. And that choice told me a lot about the kind of man he is. You know, you made a decision that day, too, Hope. When Liam didn't arrive on time, you left with Wyatt, and then you married him.",
        "Hope: Which tells you what?",
        "Ivy: It tells me that you must love Wyatt very much.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I do.",
        "Ivy: It's only right to let Liam move on, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You just do not know when to give up, do you?",
        "Wyatt: Never really worked for me.",
        "Liam: What is it exactly, Wyatt? Is it insecurity? Is it greed? Getting your job back at Forrester and marrying Hope wasn't enough for you?",
        "Wyatt: No, it wasn't. Hope and I have bigger plans for our life, and this is just the beginning.",
        "Liam: And these \"Big plans,\" have you happened to mention them to Hope? The house, the family?",
        "Wyatt: Come on, Liam! You can't see a bunch of kids having breakfast at that table or running around outside in that backyard? This place is perfect for us, Liam, and you might not think so, but Hope will. And -- and I really think she's gonna be excited about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Okay, I got it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. S'il vous plait. Once again, s'il vous plait. Oui. Thank you very much. Uh-huh. Okay. Merci, merci, Silvie. That is exactly what I need. And pardon moi for interrupting vous. Adieu. [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: Silvie?",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah, just some nubile, young French girl who set up the surveillance for the Paris photoshoot.",
        "Pam: Uh-huh. But she has the footage?",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah. She's got access to cameras all over the city. I just had to tell her when and where to look.",
        "Pam: The bridge and Trocadero Gardens.",
        "Charlie: Correctamundo. And the airport.",
        "Pam: Well, we don't really need the airport because we know she was there. We have the customs document.",
        "Charlie: No, no, no. She'll say it was a fake. She'll say we set her up. The woman lies like a wet Berber carpet. We need solid proof. We need -- we need something even Quinn can't talk her way out of.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I took a big risk telling you the truth.",
        "Bill: Don't expect me to be flattered.",
        "Quinn: I didn't think you'd be so touchy about it.",
        "Bill: I don't have a problem with secrets, Quinn. But your manipulation is going to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: That's a pensive look.",
        "Hope: Sure is. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? Maybe there's something I can do to change that.",
        "Hope: Hmm. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Everything all right?",
        "Hope: Now it is.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Well, you and Ivy seemed to be getting along when I left. Uh, take a turn for the worse?",
        "Hope: Hmm, things got a little bumpy.",
        "Wyatt: Ah. Heavy terrain.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, it sounds like you and I both kind of had the same day.",
        "Hope: Is it your mom?",
        "Wyatt: No, actually.",
        "Hope: So, Liam?",
        "Wyatt: Well, you know, we kind of have to work some things out.",
        "Hope: Okay. But when you left before, you said you had some kind of a surprise?",
        "Wyatt: I did, didn't I?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Sorry. The, uh, the door was unlocked. I hope you don't mind.",
        "Liam: Uh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: You think maybe we should call Liam? I-I know we don't have Quinn on video yet, but we know she was in Paris.",
        "Charlie: No, no, no. You don't poke a snake unless you're ready to lop off his head.",
        "[Computer chimes]",
        "Charlie: Okay, here we go.",
        "Pam: What? She find something?",
        "Charlie: Two files.",
        "Pam: What?",
        "Charlie: Security footage from outside Charles de Gaulle airport and the exit for arriving international passengers.",
        "Pam: Wow.",
        "Charlie: That's her.",
        "Pam: What? The -- the one with the scarf? Are -- a you sure?",
        "Charlie: No luggage.",
        "Pam: Oh! [Gasps] Is she stealing someone's scooter? Charlie! That is definitely Quinn!",
        "Pam: Do you see Quinn?",
        "Charlie: Not yet.",
        "Pam: But you're sure this is the bridge?",
        "Charlie: This is exactly where Ivy went in the river.",
        "Pam: Well, then Quinn should be here. I mean, do you think maybe that she changed her clothes or took off her disguise or something?",
        "Charlie: No, no, no. Liam and Ivy would spot her in the crowd.",
        "Pam: Right. What about the time?",
        "Charlie: Well, if they took the most direct route from the airport, we should see them any time now.",
        "Pam: Okay. I-I still can't believe this, Charlie. Quinn? Again?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, I even considered myself wacky to even think about this.",
        "Pam: Honestly, so did I. But I am really proud of you for following your gut.",
        "Charlie: Hey. What's that?",
        "Pam: It's Liam! And -- and look, Charlie! There's Ivy! Oh!",
        "Charlie: This is it.",
        "Pam: Can -- can you zoom in?",
        "Charlie: From way over here?",
        "Pam: N-- [Sighs]",
        "[Computer keys tap]",
        "Pam: Oh, my God! Charlie! She did it! It was her! It was Quinn! [Gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I did this family a favor. Your sons aren't at each others' throats anymore. Hope and Wyatt are married, and Liam is finally moving on with his life. All because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I have to warn you, um, this surprise is -- is pretty big.",
        "Hope: Okay, so it's ready?",
        "Wyatt: Well, it's not official yet.",
        "Hope: Well, I don't want to ruin it.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you're gonna love it.",
        "Hope: Okay. Is it -- is it, like, something do I need to see it first?",
        "Wyatt: Well, you already have. We -- we lived there, sort of. Um... Hope...I want us to move into the cliff house.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles nervously]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: What happened?",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Ivy: It's just -- you seem a little distracted.",
        "Liam: Sorry.",
        "Ivy: Do -- do you want to talk about it?",
        "Liam: Wyatt's after my house.",
        "Ivy: To do what?",
        "Liam: Live in with Hope.",
        "Ivy: Wow, okay. Well, that -- that surely explains your mood.",
        "Liam: He...he says he can picture their kids living here. He -- he is all ready to just start creating a platoon of mini-mes with her. It's...",
        "Ivy: Okay, so this isn't really about the house.",
        "Liam: No, no, no. It's Wyatt. It's Wyatt. He's just like his mother, Ivy. I mean, the both of them, it's never enough. You know, they take and take and -- and... I'm so sorry. I don't want you to think that...",
        "Ivy: No. No, it's fine. I mean, Wyatt's upset you.",
        "Liam: I mean, this... house...",
        "Ivy: This house means a lot to you.",
        "Liam: Maybe more than I realized.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I understand.",
        "Liam: I mean... I really thought I was ready. And -- and I'm certainly close.",
        "Ivy: You're just not ready, maybe not quite yet.",
        "Liam: Not quite.",
        "[Pounding on door]",
        "Liam: Oh, my God. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! What the hell, Guys?!",
        "Pam: [Sighs] Oh, good. Ivy, you're here, too.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, uh, what's -- what's going on?",
        "Charlie: We've, uh, we've got something you need to see.",
        "Pam: Yeah. And you are not going to believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: It's over, Quinn. You got what you wanted. Now, no more games.",
        "Quinn: This has never been a game to me, Bill. You should know that better than anyone.",
        "Bill: I am telling you to back off.",
        "Quinn: Relax. Liam doesn't have anything to worry about from me anymore. He's no longer in my way.",
        "Bill: I'm talking about all of them. Hope, Wyatt -- let them live their lives.",
        "Quinn: Gladly.",
        "Bill: You know, you got off lucky. You should appreciate that, because if Wyatt finds out what you did, he will be against you again.",
        "Quinn: Nobody is going to find out that I pushed Ivy off that bridge. Our secret is safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You want us to live at Liam's?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I already talked to him and my dad.",
        "Hope: And -- and what? They agreed?",
        "Wyatt: It's not a done deal, but I knew that Liam wasn't just gonna hand over the keys.",
        "Hope: Well, no. I mean, it's -- it's his house.",
        "Wyatt: He's just staying there, like I am with -- with Dad's other house. But I thought we could swap.",
        "Hope: I don't get it. [Chuckles] I don't -- I don't understand why you would want me to move in with you into a house where I have a bunch of memories with my ex.",
        "Wyatt: That doesn't mean that we can't make new ones. We can -- we can renovate. We can -- we can...",
        "Hope: Okay, I get -- I get it. No, totally, yeah. I-I-I get what you're thinking, and I understand that, you know, it's a really great house.",
        "Wyatt: It's perfect for us, okay? It's -- it's -- it's bigger, there's more bedrooms, it has a tennis court, there's a big backyard. It's everything that I want for our family.",
        "Hope: Family?",
        "Wyatt: Now that we're married... I was kind of thinking about kids.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Wow.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: When you said you had a surprise for me, you really weren't kidding.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I mean, we don't have to start right away. Next month or next year, whenever -- whenever, however it happens. I just -- I want you know that -- that I'm ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: All right. What do you remember about Ivy falling off of that bridge?",
        "Liam: Uh, nothing. I mean, I didn't see it.",
        "Pam: What about you, Ivy?",
        "Ivy: Is that what this is about?",
        "Pam: Yeah. We are certain now that your fall was not an accident.",
        "Liam: Wait, are you saying somebody intentionally hurt Ivy?",
        "Charlie: Not Ivy. You.",
        "Pam: Hope was right there, Liam, waiting for you. You were steps away from having the life you always wanted. Well, she just couldn't let that happen.",
        "Liam: Who?",
        "Charlie: Quinn.",
        "Ivy: No, Quinn wasn't even at the fashion shoot.",
        "Liam: No, Guys, Quinn was in L.A.",
        "Pam: No. She wasn't, Liam.",
        "Charlie: That's her.",
        "Pam: In disguise.",
        "Charlie: At Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris shortly after your arrival.",
        "Ivy: She was on our plane?",
        "Charlie: And then... she followed you to the Eiffel Tower.",
        "Pam: And when you got to that bridge, she could see Hope waiting for you. Well, she had to do something to stop you. So she pushed Ivy into the Seine. That's why you lost Hope, Liam. It wasn't some act of fate. It was Quinn!"
