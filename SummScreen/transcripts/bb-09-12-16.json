Quinn looks at her engagement ring and kisses Eric and tells him how great she feels. But she knows Steffy is gonna blow a gasket when she sees it. She hopes that Eric will go talk to her one more time and ask her to go home to Wyatt. She does not want to lose Eric but she also does not want Wyatt to lose Steffy. Bill visits Steffy and says he has a son .well actually he has two sons that are interested in her and need a question answered. She tells him that it's his fault as he brought that ugly Quinn into their space. She will not go home until Quinn is out of their lives. Maya is stunned when Nicole introduces her to a young gentleman that is being fitted for a new suit and he says it is Rick's idea but she is going to sing the National Anthem tonight at a ballgame. She is ecstatic as that has been a lifelong dream. Rick says he wants to make all her dreams come true. That night they all dress up and go to the Dodgers game.",
        "Ridge teases Brooke that she could ask Bill for the shares as an engagement gift and then not marry Bill. She says she wants to marry him. Ridge says then he will have to stop calling her his Logan. Eric calls and tells Steffy he'd like to see her. It is about Quinn. She gets her hopes up to Bill that perhaps her grandfather has called it off with her. Brooke laments to Ridge that they have been talking about her a lot; what is he up to. She does not mean business but personal wise. She wonders if he is broken up with Caroline if he is seeing anyone. He says no, he is a free agent. Maya does great and Rick is so proud of her. She says she owes Rick for making her dream come true. Brooke tells Ridge she thinks she broke her own personal record as she has never been alone this long and it is time to move on. Bill walks in and hopes he is interrupting something. Steffy tells her granddad that she will always be there for him and will not let that woman take him down. She is sure that is why he called her over in that he ended things with Quinn. However, Quinn walks out and Steffy tells her granddad to tell her to go, it is over. He says she is not leaving. If there is anything they can do to help her get back with Wyatt .but Quinn is not leaving. She has given him many reasons .Quinn holds up her hand with the ring and says she said yes, she is going to be Eric's wife. Steffy shouts no!"

        "Rosie: Okay, so I'm gonna escort you to the field. You guys hang back here. You'll have a clear view of Maya. Here's your mike. Just hold it where you're comfortable. We'll turn it on and off and handle the levels.",

        "Ridge: And make sure my dad's okay.",
        "Brooke: Exactly. And that is what you need to be focusing on.",
        "Ridge: Oh. Just had an idea. Why don't we call Bill and tell him that you really want the shares as an engagement present, and then...?",
        "Brooke: And not marry him?",
        "Ridge: Boom.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, come on. I want to marry Bill.",

        "Ridge: Why? It -- it bothers you?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] No, no. It's going to bother Bill when he's my husband. You're gonna drive him crazy by saying that.",
        "Ridge: I don't want that. So, out of huge respect that I have for Bill, I'm gonna stop calling you Logan, Logan.",

        "Quinn: Look, Eric, I know you love me. And to become your wife -- it -- it's the most incredible feeling. It's pure joy. But I don't want to lose you. I don't want Wyatt to lose Steffy, either, but he's going to because she said that she was going to leave unless I --",
        "Eric: All right. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: It was one stipulation I made to Wyatt. His mom had to stay away from me and my family, but now --",
        "Bill: But she's living with your grandfather.",
        "Steffy: Yes, and that is totally unacceptable. But she's not budging. She has my grandfather exactly where she wants him. It's --",

        "Bill: What?",
        "Steffy: He says he's okay, but it makes me wonder, like...",
        "Bill: What?",

        "Announcer: Fans, at this time, we ask that you please rise and join in the singing of our national anthem. Please welcome Maya Forrester.",
        "Maya: Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight o'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air gave proof through the night that our flag was still there oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wa-ave o'er the land of the free and the home of the bra-a-ave?",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Maya Forrester.",

        "Ridge: Just so you know, I'll be keeping an eye on things.",
        "Brooke: Things?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. You're getting married to Spencer. Someone's got to have your back.",
        "Brooke: Oh. That's comforting. We've been talking a lot about me. What about you?",
        "Ridge: What about me?",
        "Brooke: What does your future look like?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I don't know. Just -- just working, I guess.",
        "Brooke: I'm not talking about work. I'm talking about your life. You and Caroline broke up, and she's raising a child with Thomas.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: So, are you seeing anybody? I mean, I know that's a silly question, because you're always seeing somebody.",
        "Ridge: No, I'm a free agent.",
        "Brooke: Ah. Open for bids. Probably somebody in her 20s.",
        "Ridge: Early 20s, yeah.",
        "Brooke: Mm.",
        "Ridge: No, come on. I've done that, been there. It's good.",
        "Brooke: Oh, raising the bar? Somebody in her 30s, right?",
        "Ridge: It has nothing to do with that. I just want to be with someone that I'm comfortable with -- you know, no airs, no pretenses, like us, like -- like an old pair of shoes.",
        "Brooke: Did you just compare me to an old pair of shoes?",
        "Ridge: Hmm? What? No. No, not -- not -- yes, but not -- I meant, you know, like, frayed. Frayed and you're just -- you're comfortable. You slide --",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God. Okay. Where's the shovel? 'Cause you're digging yourself even deeper.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] You didn't answer my question earlier about -- about a wedding date.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I don't know. We haven't really discussed it, but it's gonna be private, quiet, small.",
        "Ridge: Out of respect for Katie.",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I mean, we'll get married, I'll get the shares, and get them to you so you can get Quinn out of Eric's life.",
        "Ridge: Can't thank you enough for that. Hey. Why don't we run the company together?",
        "Brooke: Uh... uh, Bill won't like that.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I don't care what Bill likes. Think about what -- what we could do together. We were good. Men's line, the bedroom line. Could make you lead model.",
        "Brooke: An old shoe like me.",
        "Ridge: If the shoe fits.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Are you alone?",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] I'm sorry.",
        "Eric: Sorry about what?",
        "Steffy: I spoke to Quinn. I told her to end things with you. I'm, uh -- I'm assuming that's why you asked me here. Did she end it with you? Or did you end it with her and you finally came to your senses?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Yes, it happened.",
        "Ridge: I know, I know. You're ama-- come on. My gosh.",
        "Zende: There she is!",
        "Maya: Did that really just happen?",
        "Rick: Yes, it happened.",
        "Nicole: You nailed it.",
        "Zende: Yeah, hey, you were amazing, okay? Hey, you guys -- you think they'll notice if I hang out in back of the dugout?",
        "Maya: Rick, thank you.",
        "Rick: Are you kidding? You did the hard part. I just set it up.",
        "Maya: No, you just made one of my dreams come true.",
        "Rick: Oh...",
        "Maya: I owe you.",
        "Rick: Yeah, you do. So, you're saying I might get to first base tonight?",
        "Maya: Oh. I think you might get a grand slam.",
        "Rick: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You're so much better than him, Logan.",
        "Brooke: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: I know, I know.",
        "Brooke: It's time for me to move on. I think I broke a personal record. I haven't been alone this long since I was a girl.",
        "Ridge: You're doing fine on your own.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Well, well, well. Am I interrupting? I hope so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You're lonely, and I fault myself as much as anyone for that.",
        "Eric: Sweetheart, you had a lot on your plate.",
        "Steffy: No, that's -- that's not an excuse. Look, I didn't want you to be upset with me, the way I talked -- talked to Quinn, and...I had to. I had to. The situation was out of control. And I'm not gonna let that woman take you down. I'm gonna always be there for you. Know that.",
        "Eric: I know you will be.",
        "Steffy: So, you're okay? You understand that this is best for you, for all of us? I mean, the woman was gonna dismantle my marriage, the family, the business. And I'm really happy you ended things. Right? I mean, that's why you asked me here. You ended things with Quinn, right?",
        "Quinn: Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Why is she here? You're leaving, right?",
        "Quinn: Oh.",
        "Steffy: No, you're gonna -- you're gonna pack your bags, and you're gonna leave, Quinn. You're gonna leave.",
        "Quinn: How can you not see that I'm not that woman you once knew? I'm never gonna be her again.",
        "Steffy: Whatever. Fine. Just go. Granddad, tell her to leave. Wait. What's going on? This is -- this is over, right? Granddad?",
        "Eric: Steffy, Quinn is not leaving. Now, I know how you feel about her, but it's absolutely unwarranted. And if there's anything we can do to help you get back together with Wyatt, we will.",
        "Steffy: Oh, no, no. We'll have that discussion after Quinn leaves, please.",
        "Eric: Steffy, she's not leaving. Quite the opposite, really. I can't believe myself how much she's come to mean to me in such a short time. She's given me so many reasons to live my life.",
        "Steffy: What are you saying?",
        "Eric: I asked Quinn to marry me.",
        "Quinn: And I said yes. I love him, Steffy, and I'm gonna be his wife.",
        "Steffy: No. No!"
