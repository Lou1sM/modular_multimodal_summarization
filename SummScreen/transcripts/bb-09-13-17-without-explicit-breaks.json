She tells him that Bill is taking a leave of absence so looks like there will be several changes. Alison ushers CJ in to see Liam.

CJ shakes his hand and says he does not realize what this will for his mother and him. Sally is in the midst of saying goodbye one more time to Grams, Saul, Coco and Darlita. She says they have come to the end of the line with the building burnt to a crisp and Thomas is not coming back. Liam tracks her down and asks if she can come to his office right away. She sees no reason since she is on her way out of town. He says this is important and thinks she will want to hear this. Bill tells Steffy that he was wrong in dealing with Liam but if it had not been for Sally Spectra . She corrects him and says Sally had nothing to do with what happened and it is all up to Bill now. He admits he went too far but so did Liam.",
        "Sally goes to see Liam and he says he hopes after they talk she will not want to talk about leaving Los Angeles. She tells him there is nothing left for her now as Caroline is in remission but Thomas is staying with his son in New York. He hands her new papers and says this is real, seriously. She now is the new owner. He is just trying to right a wrong. It is hers now. Ridge gives Brooke another pitch to leave Bill before he lets her down. She says he is persistent. She reminds him that he betrayed her with Quinn. He tells her do not think of that. There is nothing there, never was. Steffy tells Bill that he knows he is wrong so do not lose these precious moments with Liam. Sally wonders why Liam is doing this and he says it is the right thing to do. He hopes she has a plan now and wants to design. He knows it will be a lot of work but she can get a loan and she has friends and family and can get back in the business again. She wants to know about Steffy and he says no one needs to know about this but them. She gives him a big hug and says he is the most amazing man. He tells her to go tell her crew and get to working. She stops and says he just took the worst day of her life and made it the best."

        "Bill: Unfortunately, it's more than a rift. Things have spun out of control.",
        "Steffy: My god, bill. Arson? You had to know there was gonna be repercussions.",
        "Bill: I just didn't think losing my son would be one of them.",

        "Sally: I'm sorry.",
        "[ Door creaks ] Despite all the damage, the building is structurally sound. That's why we allowed you back in. But, please, exercise caution when moving about.",
        "Shirley: I'm seeing it, but... I still can't believe it.",
        "Darlita: Spectra fashions, may she rest in peace.",
        "Saul: Wait, we knew there were wiring issues, but for the whole place to go up in flames the night before our big show?",

        "Brooke: Bill. He's taking a leave of absence from spencer publications.",
        "Steffy: I can't believe you hit him, bill. Your own son.",
        "Bill: I know! I know... I was angry. I -- I reacted. I mean, he was trying to take my company, threatening me with jail time. What was I supposed to do, just stand there and accept it?",
        "Steffy: You're supposed to work things through, not resort to violence!",
        "Bill: And liam's supposed to be a loyal son! Instead he axed me, and he defends sally spectra in the same breath! After everything she did to you? Or has the, uh, dippy redhead won you over, too?",
        "Sally: I am so happy to hear that caroline is gonna be okay. That is great news for douglas and for her. For us. So, you think you'll be coming back soon?",

        "Sally: You just told me that caroline was getting better.",
        "Thomas: Sally, I've loved you like I never loved anyone. But caroline has a second chance at life, and I have a second chance at giving my son something that I've never had -- a stable family. I realized that my place is here with my son and his mother.",
        "Sally: I got to go. Goodbye, thomas.",
        "Coco: I am so sorry, sal.",
        "Alison: C.J. Garrison for your father. What should I tell him?",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, no, send him in, I'll handle it.",

        "C.J.: Thank you very much. Oh! Hey, uh, liam, look, I am -- whoa! What happened to your face, man?",
        "Liam: It's, uh, fine. Listen, my father took a leave of absence, and I am now acting C.E.O.",
        "C.J.: Okay, um... what's this?",
        "Liam: The original purchase agreement. I mean, look at it. These are the numbers that you and my dad originally agreed upon, right?",
        "C.J.: Well, yeah, but he pulled that. I mean, you were here when...",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, now that I'm in charge, we're gonna do things a little differently, and honoring original agreements is one of them.",
        "C.J.: Liam, listen, I don't think you realize the impact that this is going to have on my mother and me. I can't thank you enough. Man, it's -- yeah, we can stop shaking hands.",

        "Saul: Sally. Sally, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Are you absolutely sure that we are out of options?",
        "Sally: This entire building is burnt to a crisp. My line is destroyed. C.J. Is selling whatever is left of this place to bill spencer, and... thomas isn't coming back. We've reached the end of the line. Spectra fashions is...no more.",
        "[ Cellphone rings ]",
        "Shirley: Oh! It's thomas calling back. I bet he's reconsidered. Come on, everybody, let's give sally some privacy.",
        "Sally: Hello?",
        "Liam: Hey, sally. It's liam spencer. I'd like to see you. Can you come to my office at spencer publications right away?",
        "Sally: Liam, this really isn't a good time right now. I'm actually in the middle of something. I'm in the middle of leaving L.A. For good.",
        "Liam: Well, that's what i want to talk to you about. But not over the phone. Would you come? Please. It's important. And I think -- I think you'll be happy you did.",
        "Sally: [ Sighs ]",
        "Ridge: Wow.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: Who'd have thought that a control freak like your hubby can let go of his company?",
        "Brooke: Temporarily. In the meantime, liam's taking over.",
        "Ridge: Good. Put his own stamp on spencer publications.",
        "Brooke: Bill just hasn't been himself lately. He seems really stressed.",
        "Ridge: Maybe he's finally grown a conscience. Maybe he feels guilty about something he's done to someone.",
        "Bill: I regret what I did. Losing it with liam, ordering the fire... it was wrong. But if it wasn't for sally spectra and that two-bit --",
        "Steffy: No! Do not put this on sally. You took something from her you had no right to take. Bill, if you had any remorse, you'll do something. You'll start the healing process with your son. It's all up to you, bill.",
        "Sally: I, uh, went to your office, but they directed me here.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. I'm glad you came. Honestly, I didn't -- I didn't think you would. Can you close that door?",
        "Sally: What is this about, liam? What is that about?",
        "Liam: It's a long story... I'm kidding, I'm fine.",
        "Sally: Well, I'm glad someone is because I am not. This has literally been the worst day of my life. I can't wait to get as far from L.A. As possible.",
        "Liam: Well, I'm kind of hoping that after we talk, you won't feel that way.",
        "Brooke: Here's a novel concept -- instead of you always thinking the worst about my husband, you could actually cut him some slack instead.",
        "Ridge: I don't trust the guy. Neither should you.",
        "Brooke: I'm married to him.",
        "Ridge: I know.",
        "Brooke: I'm his wife.",
        "Ridge: Here's an easy fix. Leave him, come back to me, and I'll make you forget all about bill spencer.",
        "Bill: If you're asking me what I think you are...",
        "Steffy: You and liam have had your differences before, but nothing like this.",
        "Bill: He never instigated a coup before and threatened to have me arrested.",
        "Steffy: You committed a crime!",
        "Bill: He recorded me behind my back. Is blackmailing me not a crime?",
        "Steffy: Bill, people could have died.",
        "Bill: I got that. And I realize now that I went too far. But so did liam! And for what? To try to avenge what I did to sally spectra? He's got a thing for her.",
        "Sally: So, did you hear about caroline? Thomas called and said that she's cured. Or at least on her way, anyway, but hopefully you would already know that this time. You're her family. Anyway, um, thomas called me to tell me that, the good news, and that all of his time spent with caroline and douglas has made him recommit to his family. He's staying in new york. I thought we were in love, that we were in a relationship, we were business partners, but I guess he's gone, too. Just like spectra. So I'm -- I'm gonna head out 'cause there's nothing left for me here in los angeles.",
        "Liam: I'd like to try and change that.",
        "Sally: Look, liam, I know you're some ridiculously upbeat guy, but --",
        "Liam: No, no, no, no, no. Okay, you -- you know that my dad wanted to build this skyscraper on the spectra lot, right?",
        "Sally: Yes. I do. Uh, C.J. Is about to sell it to him, from what I understand.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, spencer holdings already owns it.",
        "Sally: When did that happen? Is that why you invited me here? I'm confused. You're giving this building back to my great aunt?",
        "Liam: I believe sally spectra is your name, too. The building, the property -- it's yours.",
        "Sally: [ Sighs ] I am sure your father has something to say about this.",
        "Liam: My father took a leave of absence, and I'm in charge now. And, yeah, this is real.",
        "Sally: Seriously? I own a piece of downtown L.A.?",
        "Liam: Listen, my dad has been out to get you from the start. I know you know about the bad review, but... it goes a lot deeper than that. It doesn't matter. I'm just -- I'm trying to right a wrong here, so the building, the property, all of it -- it's yours, sally.",
        "Brooke: You are persistent. I'll give you that.",
        "Ridge: Good. Then leave bill before he lets you down.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] Ridge...",
        "Ridge: I know. I know, I know. I let you down, too. But if you give me another chance, then I will be the husband that you need, that you always needed, the husband I should have been.",
        "Brooke: When I was going to marry you, that's what i thought. That you were all I needed. Until you betrayed me with quinn, of all people. Your father's wife. I still wonder...",
        "Ridge: Well, don'T. Don't wonder. There's nothing between me and quinn. There never was. Dad has forgiven her. Why can't you forgive me?",
        "Steffy: Don't be ridiculous! He doesn't have a thing for sally. Can we just focus on saving your relationship with your son?",
        "Bill: Sure, but I'm telling you, I'm right.",
        "Steffy: I'm telling you that you guys just need to work together. You need to end this war. You and your son just need to meet in the middle.",
        "Bill: We go back a long way, don't we? You know I'm not a \"meet in the middle\" kind of guy.",
        "Steffy: I know you're not gonna be able to fix this overnight, but you need to just try, okay? You don't need be estranged from your son again. You don't need to just lose these precious moments because you're angry and you know that you're wrong. Because you're gonna regret it.",
        "Sally: This is insane.",
        "Liam: [ Chuckles ]",
        "Sally: This can't be happening.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, it just did.",
        "Sally: Why are you doing this?",
        "Liam: I told you. It's -- it's the right thing to do.",
        "Sally: Really? That's all you're gonna say?",
        "Liam: That's all that needs to be said. Listen, do you have a plan to resurrect spectra?",
        "Sally: I, um... I mean, I just came from there. The building is still standing. Barely. But they said it's structurally sound, and... [ Stammers ] I don't know where to start, no, but, um, the whole place has to be redone and gutted...",
        "Liam: Okay, great, but you still want to design, right? I mean, you want to be a name in the fashion industry?",
        "Sally: Yeah! Yeah, that's always been my dream.",
        "Liam: Fantastic. Good. I mean, look, listen, it's gonna be a lot of work. You're gonna have to borrow against the property and the building to take out a loan so you can get jump-started, but you -- you got friends, you got family. I mean, with support like that, you can't go wrong, right?",
        "Sally: Right, um... does bill know about this?",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Sally: Steffy?",
        "Liam: Nobody needs to know but us.",
        "Sally: I really don't deserve this.",
        "Liam: You really do deserve this. More than you realize.",
        "Sally: How can I ever thank you?",
        "Liam: [ Laughs ] By realizing your dreams and being successful, I guess. Can you do that?",
        "Sally: Yes! Yes! I'm -- I'm gonna work every hour of every day for the rest of my life to prove it! [ Laughs ]",
        "Liam: [ Laughs ] Good.",
        "Sally: Oh, god, you are the most amazing man, liam.",
        "Liam: Okay, thank you, but this really does have to stay between us.",
        "Sally: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Liam: Now, go! Go tell the crew that, you know, spectra's not closing after all, and you'll be up and running before you know it.",
        "Sally: Yes!",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Sally: You just took the worst day of my life... and you made it the best. Thank you."
