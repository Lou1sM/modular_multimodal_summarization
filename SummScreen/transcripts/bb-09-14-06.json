        "Shane rehearses his little story to Taylor and asks for $1 million for a reverse story not to tell the police that he saw the whole Darla accident because it wasn't her fault. If she doesn't want them to know she was there and driving, then he won't tell them and thinks he should be compensated. He muses to himself that he is sure she will go for this. Clarke, Sally, Thorne, Ally, Taylor and Phoebe celebrate Darla's birthday and Ally hopes her wish comes true. She's delighted to give Taylor a beaded necklace and Taylor is touched. Then Ally professes her love for Taylor and wants her to sleep in her bed while she uses the sleeping bag.",
        "Brooke lashes out at Bridget when she tells her that she told Nick the truth that she still loved him. Nick walks in on the outburst and they decide to have it out. Bridget back peddles and tells Brooke that she is sorry that she is so weak and she didn't mean to cause problems. Brooke understands that Bridget was only trying to tell the truth and she couldn't bear it if something came between them. A look comes between Nick and Bridget that THAT will never happen. Taylor and Thorne accidentally meet later in the kitchen and he confesses he can't sleep. But he wants her to know that what Ally told her earlier, he feels the same way. Bridget kisses the urn and packs Nicole's things away. Brooke apologizes to Nick for running off to Ridge and giving Nick doubts. He doesn't feel like he's a wiser man, but he is more humble and feels like a lucky man that she is in his life. She feels sorry for Bridget, but says she can handle it."

        "Brooke: I'm not saying that this is not awkward. You know, there were times in the past when I wish we had had this conversation and really had been honest about our feelings for Nick.",
        "Bridget: Mom, I tried to.",
        "Brooke: I know. I know you did, honey. You were always braver than I was. And you still are.",
        "Bridget: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Brooke: It didn't feel good to hear you say that you hoped our marriage had failed.",
        "Bridget: Mom, I just -- I'm trying to be honest about my feelings, and I'm trying to face it.",
        "Brooke: Honey, I want you to be happy. You deserve to be happy. And nick is not going to make you happy. Or at least not happy enough. He's my husband now. And I know there's nothing you would ever do to undermine our marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: My daughter said you wanted to see me?",
        "Shane: Yes, I do. On a personal matter.",
        "Taylor: Do you think that's appropriate?",
        "Shane: Don't worry. This will only take a few minutes. See, when I first came to beautiful Los Angeles, I found myself sleeping on the beach a few times at one point.",
        "Taylor: Well, then, it's to your credit that --",
        "Shane: Wait, wait, wait. Let me finish. Please. You see, like I was saying, I was on the beach one night and I saw this car stranded up on the road, and I started to make way up there. Let me tell you, by the way, that's no easy hike up a hill, in the dark, ma'am. But I made it up there, and I decided to offer up my help. But your daughter, she really doesn't remember me that much at the time. 'Cause I -- I looked a little different then.",
        "Taylor: You? You were the man that frightened my daughter?",
        "Shane: People who have nothing are nothing to be afraid of. But yeah, that's exactly how your daughter took it. I offered up my help, but she didn't want it, so I stopped. I moved back. And I just watched. And your daughter -- I made sure that nobody caused her any harm.",
        "Taylor: That was good of you.",
        "Shane: Oh, yeah, that's right. Because I'm a good guy. That's why I'm trying to tell you, there's no shame in having fallen on hard times.",
        "Taylor: Of course not.",
        "Shane: And that's what I'm trying to tell you, Dr. Forrester. There's no shame in what you did. That poor woman that was trying to help your daughter fix that tire, she -- she fell. Into the road. You couldn't help but hit her. That's exactly what I would have told the police, had they confronted me. I would have gone to bat for you. I would. I don't suppose you still want to do that, though, right?",
        "Taylor: What do you want, Shane?",
        "Shane: Well, let's see here. I was thinking that maybe there might be a little reverse reward. You know, for having information and not coming forward.",
        "Taylor: Such as?",
        "Shane: I was thinking $1 million would be appropriate. That would be more than enough to help me get back on my feet again.",
        "Shane: She'll go for it, Shane. She's gotta go for it. It's not even like she's even gonna miss $1 million.",

        "Thorne: Hey, there you are.",
        "Phoebe: Hey, I'm sorry I'm late, everybody.",
        "Sally: It's all right. We saved you a plate.",
        "Sally: And you're just in time for the cake.",
        "Thorne: Yes. Honey, why don't you blow out the candles, okay? Come on. And don't forget to make a wish. Something that mommy would wish for.",
        "Sally: Good.",
        "Thorne: Good job.",
        "Alexandria: I just hope it comes true.",

        "Brooke: What are you trying to tell me? Or not tell me? Come on. You know I'm going to find out eventually.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, maybe.",
        "Brooke: Honey, look, I'm not worried about me and Nick. I mean, whatever you can say is not going to make me jealous. I mean, it might make me angry, but that's why I'd rather have it over and done with.",
        "Bridget: Oh, Mom. I think I could handle anything except you being \"over and done\" with me.",

        "Clarke: Okay, everybody. Time for presents.",
        "Thorne: Who said anything about presents?",

        "Thorne: You two --",
        "Sally: Oh, yeah.",
        "Clarke: Well, this is -- it's my favorite t-shirt. My hippie mother gave it to me when I was very little. And Darla always loved tie-dye. This is the real deal. It's from back in the day. And I've had it for all these years. But sometimes, you gotta let things go. Ally? Is it okay? Okay. Happy birthday, sweetheart.",
        "Alexandria: I have a present, too. We made it at pre-school for mommy's birthday.",
        "Taylor: Oh, that's so pretty.",
        "Alexandria: And since she can't wear it, Aunt Taylor, will you?",
        "Taylor: Ally --",
        "Alexandria: Ms. Albright helped.",
        "Thorne: She insisted.",
        "Taylor: Well, I'd be honored, ally. Think you could help me put it on? Thank you. Thank you so much, sweetheart.",

        "Brooke: You've done something.",
        "Bridget: Yes.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Bridget: I can't -- I can't say anything, mom. I swore that I wouldn't say anything.",

        "Bridget: Yes.",
        "Brooke: You went to him, told him how you felt?",
        "Bridget: Yes.",
        "Brooke: What else did you say? That I could never make him happy? Not the way you could?",
        "Bridget: Yes! Yeah, I said something like that.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god, Bridget. What did you expect? That he would leave me and fall into your arms? I thought you knew Nick better than that.",
        "Bridget: I do. I do now, Mom. Yes, I do.",
        "Nick: Hello, ladies. Is this a bad time?",
        "Brooke: Oh, no. No, not at all. You might as well come in now and we can have it out. Bridget told me everything.",
        "Nick: Well, maybe that's for the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: She won't even miss $1 million. I mean, that house alone has got to be worth -- Shane, what are you doing, man? It's blackmail. That's exactly what it is. It's a crime. You know something? It's nowhere nearly as bad as what they did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandria: How late can we stay up?",
        "[Taylor yawns]",
        "Taylor: Oh, I don't know. I'm getting pretty tired. How about you, Phoebe?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, I actually have school tomorrow.",
        "Taylor: Yeah. Yeah, I'm getting pretty sleepy.",

        "Taylor: Well, Ally, I don't want to take your bed away from you.",
        "Alexandria: I want you to. Because I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Maybe I can help explain this --",
        "Bridget: No, no, Nick, Nick -- Nick, there's really nothing you need to say. Or explain. I was just -- I told mom that I admitted to you how I feel about you and -- well, there's no need for you to make it sound any better. Or any worse. Obviously, I was -- I was wrong. And maybe I needed to feel the humiliation of you knowing that I've been waiting around for Nick. Maybe that's what made me realize how strong you two have been -- and are -- and how weak I am. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know this hasn't been easy for you two to be together, but starting today, it can be.",
        "Nick: Brooke, how do you feel about that?",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry. I acted so jealous.",
        "Bridget: Mom, you don't need to apologize.",
        "Brooke: No, honey, yes, I do. You were just trying to tell me the truth. And I appreciate that. It's something I probably didn't really want to hear, but I think I needed to hear it. Two of the most important people in my life are standing right here in this very room. You both make me so happy to be alive. And I couldn't bear it if there was something that came between us. Not even a little bit.",
        "Bridget: Mom -- oh, god -- that will never, never happen.",
        "Brooke: Never?",
        "[Nick whispers]",
        "Nick: Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Oh, I didn't know you were still up.",
        "Thorne: Sometimes I can't sleep. But tonight, I will. I just wanted more of it. You know how when you're happy and tired at the same time, but you don't want to let go of the happy part yet? It's been a long time since this place felt like home. And I thought if it ever did, if it ever felt anything like complete again, I would be upset. Because I would feel that it was wrong. But I'm standing here in the dark, asking myself -- and it feels right.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, I know what you're saying. I know it isn't always easy, but -- I don't know, for some reason, tonight, it was. I just came to get a little bit of water and I'm going to go back to bed.",
        "Thorne: Don't turn around. What ally said earlier to you tonight, I feel the same way. Good night.",
        "Shane: I'm sorry to do this to you, man. But I need this money more than you need to know who killed your wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: If we had time to take a second honeymoon, we would leave tonight. But since we don't, this will have to do. I'm sorry what I did to us. Not respecting your feelings, running off to Ridge at the least bit of provocation -- which is exactly what he wanted.",
        "Nick: I'm sorry about my temper. And the demands that I make.",
        "Brooke: You have every right to.",
        "Nick: I can't say I can look you in the eye and tell you I'm a wiser man because of all of this, but I can certainly say I am a bit more humble.",
        "Brooke: I love your pride. That's who you are. I don't want you to lose that.",
        "Nick: I pray every day that I never forget how lucky I am to have you in my life. To be able to touch you with my hands and hold you.",
        "Brooke: I feel so badly for Bridget. She was right to tell me what she was hoping for you with you. But she needs to be responsible for her own happiness. And I can't do that for her.",
        "Nick: No.",
        "Brooke: And we need to be responsible for ours. So, we need to believe in our love and not worry about it. And not doubt it. Just know that it's there. And let everything else just slip away.",
        "Nick: Let the rest slip away. Well, we should be able to do that."
