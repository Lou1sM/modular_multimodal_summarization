        "Brooke: Your son. Or your daughter.",
        "Nick: I'm looking.",
        "Brooke: Yours and Bridget's. When he's born, you'll look at him and you'll see yourself, everything that you ever wanted to be. Everything that you were. I still see that in Bridget.",
        "Nick: I see that in her, too.",
        "Brooke: You and I will never be. You'll thank me for that when the baby's born. You'll have no regrets. And you'll love Bridget completely, not only for who she is, but for everything that she's given you.",
        "Nick: I do love her that way.",
        "Brooke: Then let go of me. Let the best thing, the right thing, happen for all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gaby: Well, look on the bright side.",
        "Thomas: What's the bright side of having my dad order me to confess to a federal crime and get you deported?",
        "Gaby: He doesn't seem to hate me as much as your mom does. Honey, have you seen my nightgown?",
        "Thomas: I don't know. Try the filing cabinet. You know, this is crazy. We can't live here. We're supposed to be starting school.",
        "Gaby: Can we, still?",
        "Thomas: Well, that was the whole point. You can't give up your scholarship. And my parents already sent in my tuition.",
        "Sally: Oh, our resident newlyweds. So how are we doing? Oh, what have we here?",
        "Gaby: I'm sorry, Sally.",
        "Sally: It's okay, darling. I certainly know what it's like to be tossed out by a Forrester. As a matter of fact, I am the resident expert when it comes to that. So until you patch things up, mi casa es su casa.",
        "Thomas: Actually, I'm not so sure if that's going to happen, Sal.",
        "Gaby: They think I'm trying take advantage of their son.",
        "Thomas: Dad says we have to get our marriage annulled.",
        "Sally: What's the matter with him? Can't he see past that roman nose of his?",
        "Gaby: They think we got married just for my green card. And they're not completely wrong. That's how it started. But it's not --",
        "Thomas: But it's about us now. It's our future. And he still wants me to be a college jock and date sorority girls.",
        "Sally: Ah, I see. And forget about her. And forget about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: What do you think they're talking about?",
        "Dante: You know I love dancing with someone who doesn't even know I'm here.",
        "Bridget: I don't think it's the weather, do you?",
        "Dante: I don't think you should be doing this to yourself. You should have at least told Nick about tonight, you know?",
        "Bridget: Why should he care if you and my mom are together?",
        "Dante: Maybe he thinks I'm a plague on all humanity.",
        "[ Bridget sighs ]",
        "Bridget: Maybe he'll just never be able to see her with anyone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: All right. All right.",
        "Brooke: I need to hear you say it.",
        "Nick: I don't know how to not love you. That's not gonna change. But I can bury it. Because I did it before, and I can do it again.",
        "Brooke: One day you'll wake up and realize it's what you want.",
        "Nick: Is he sleeping?",
        "Brooke: Not all the time. He'll be kicking in a couple of months.",
        "Nick: It's probably like being at sea.",
        "Brooke: He knows he's not alone. He hears Bridget breathing, talking. He'll hear you at night.",
        "Nick: Maybe I wouldn't have spent most of my life at sea if I'd heard my old man at night.",
        "Brooke: I'm so happy for you.",
        "Nick: Thanks.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sally: I'm going to show you how much money you have made for me. Los Angeles sales. West coast regional gross.",
        "Thomas: Just from my line?",
        "Sally: National gross sales.",
        "Thomas: Oh, my.",
        "Sally: I think the point has been made. You, young man, are hot. Sssssss.",
        "Thomas: I'm hot!",
        "Gaby: I already knew that.",
        "Sally: Now, you know how the youth market is about designer labels. So yours is the one they want to see right now. I've never seen anything like it. Now, I know college seems exciting, and it is. All that plagiarism. All that alcohol poisoning. And a degree is indispensable if you want an entry-level job that pays absolutely nothing with no benefits. Think. What is your designer label going to mean in four years, when the kids snapping it up now are having babies and pinching pennies?",
        "Gaby: But going to college is something Thomas really wants to do.",
        "Sally: People go to college now when they're 50 years old. If you can ride the wave until then, why not? Why not cash in while it's there for the taking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Can we let this go on?",
        "Eric: Jackie, they look like two people who are saying good-bye to each other, that's all.",
        "Jackie: Well, even if they are, it's cruel. It's cruel and unnecessary. I know Brooke thinks she's doing the right thing --",
        "Eric: Jackie, you seem to forget that my daughter's happiness is at stake here.",
        "Jackie: What kind of happiness comes from being kept in the dark? Is she going to be able to forgive you when she realizes that we all smiled and looked the other way while she married a man that we knew was in love with her mother? One word from either of us -- one true word -- and this could all change.",
        "Eric: Jackie. Jackie, don't. Listen, if you want to ruin my daughter's hopes and your relationship with your son, you do it on your own time.",
        "Jackie: This is my own time.",
        "Eric: I thought you were with me. Am I wrong? I don't need this dinner. I've had this dinner dozens of times. Sitting across the table from someone who is fuming about the incompetence of others to live their lives properly.",
        "Jackie: I don't want to be Stephanie.",
        "Eric: I'm taking you home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Thanks. Wow, you two are awfully quiet all of a sudden.",
        "Brooke: It's just kind of hot in here.",
        "Nick: It's okay if I hang onto this, isn't it?",
        "Bridget: Oh, yeah, of course. Honey, it's ours.",
        "Dante: Well --",
        "Bridget: I know what we could do. We could go home to the pool.",
        "Brooke: Now?",
        "Nick: It's late.",
        "Bridget: No, it's not. And mom, you love swimming at night.",
        "Brooke: I don't feel like getting wet, sweetheart.",
        "Bridget: Well, even if we don't, there's a nice breeze. And I'm sure there's some champagne leftover from one of our non-weddings, and --",
        "Nick: You know, I really don't care for champagne that much. I've had my fill for the night.",
        "Bridget: We're celebrating, right?",
        "Dante: I'm kind of tired, you know?",
        "Bridget: I'm the pregnant lady. If I'm not tired, I don't see how any of you can be. I'm gonna go -- thank you -- to the ladies' room. And I hear I'm gonna be saying that a lot the next couple of months.",
        "Nick: Well, I don't want to go sit by a pool, if you don't mind.",
        "Dante: Well, you should. Both of you should. You know what you two look like from the dance floor? Bridget was watching it. And trust me, you guys don't look like you've called it quits just yet. Her insecurity's been stirred up again.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god.",
        "Dante: I'll get the check.",
        "Nick: I'm done being tested.",
        "Brooke: You're coming to the pool.",
        "Nick: I will love your daughter. I'll love our child, and I'll do everything I've promised. But don't ask me to watch him put his hands on you.",
        "Brooke: Bridget needs to see this, Nick. Do it for me. I like to mix it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I appreciate what you're trying to do, Sally. But I don't see how I can change my plans now.",
        "Sally: Oh, but you can. You see, I just happen to have a brand-new contract all ready for you to look at.",
        "Thomas: My first year of tuition is already paid.",
        "Sally: And you feel obligated to pay back your father whatever the tightwads of academia will not refund, hmm?",
        "Thomas: How? I let my dad talk me into having every dollar you paid me deposited into a trust fund, which I can't touch.",
        "Sally: Well, that is where this little signing bonus may come in handy.",
        "Bridget: Wow, what a glorious night. Mom, did you get new patio furniture?",
        "Brooke: Just a couple of things, now that I have a man around the house to do the heavy lifting.",
        "Nick: I need a drink. Anybody else?",
        "Bridget: You know, I think I'm gonna get the champagne out. Even though I can't have it, I still like seeing it.",
        "Dante: How do you want to do this?",
        "Brooke: Does Bridget really need more convincing?",
        "Dante: I guess that's why she asked us here, to see if Nick is too jealous to be around us.",
        "Brooke: I just hate doing this to him.",
        "Dante: You know, maybe we shouldn't go through with this. We should just leave.",
        "Brooke: No. That'll just make things worse. We came here to reassure Bridget. And that's exactly what we have to do. No matter how much pain it causes any of us.",
        "Dante: Here they come. Okay, what do you want me to do?",
        "Brooke: Just hold me. Stroke my hair. This is the last time I'll ask you to do anything like this for me. But we have to convince Bridget that this is real. So just pretend to kiss me. Just kiss me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: I think they lost their interest in champagne.",
        "Nick: Let's get out of here.",
        "Bridget: We just got here.",
        "Nick: I don't think they'll miss us.",
        "Bridget: They'll feel bad if we do. Come on.",
        "Brooke: Are they watching?",
        "Dante: I think so.",
        "Bridget: You don't have to look at the ground. We're all grown-ups.",
        "Nick: Are we? Why do I suddenly feel like I'm in high school?",
        "Bridget: This is all new for them. My mother deserves to have someone, don't you think?",
        "Nick: I didn't know I was supposed to have an opinion on that subject.",
        "Bridget: It's pretty obvious that you don't like Dante, but you have to admit that look good together. Don't they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: This. This is what I could have been making?",
        "Sally: This summer you were an unknown. Now you're not.",
        "Gaby: I don't understand the second part of paragraph seven.",
        "Sally: You know, for a quiet little thing, you do get chatty at the oddest times.",
        "Gaby: The part about who reserves the rights to what.",
        "Sally: Honey, come on, I couldn't cheat your husband even if I wanted to. Thorne would tear up the contract and then he would tear my head off my shoulders. Do either of you have a problem with this?",
        "Thomas: I didn't know you could write a number that big on one check.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, all those zeroes spell \"freedom.\" Go buy yourself a sweet, little house on the beach. Get your wife a hot, red convertible to drive to class in. And in a year or two, Ridge and Taylor will see you two are for real and come crawling back to eat their words. Then you will be richer than any bachelor's degree could ever make you. All you have to do is sign.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Am I being held prisoner?",
        "Eric: Yes. 90 days, bread and water. All the sand you can eat.",
        "Jackie: Just how angry with me are you?",
        "Eric: I just thought you needed a little protection from yourself. Make yourself comfortable.",
        "Jackie: Maybe you're right. Maybe I am just a fool who never learns. It's just that when two people are meant for each other like Nick and Brooke, you just --",
        "Eric: Meant to be what?",
        "Jackie: To be together.",
        "Eric: To do what? Oh, Jackie, you and I have been around long enough to know that \"meant to be together\" and \"meant to be happy\" are not necessarily the same thing.",
        "Jackie: You think that's how it is with Brooke and my son? It's true. They have made each other more unhappy than not.",
        "Eric: I think Nick and Brooke truly believe that they're doing what's best for everyone. Maybe, just maybe, they are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Are they still there?",
        "Dante: Yes. Nick doesn't look too happy.",
        "Brooke: Oh, god, why don't they just leave?",
        "Dante: Maybe we should just stop.",
        "Brooke: I don't like this anymore than you do, Dante. And I hate what this is doing to Nick.",
        "Dante: You know, if we keep this up, he might lose it. This whole thing about reassuring Bridget might blow in your face.",
        "Brooke: I thought we just had to go to dinner, show her that we were a couple, and she'd be satisfied. I guess she got insecure when I had that conversation with nick at the table. I'm sorry, Dante, but we have to keep going. We have to prove to Bridget that this is real. She has to know that my relationship with Nick is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Nick remembering ]",
        "Brooke: Then let me go. And let the best thing, the right thing, happen for all of us. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go.",
        "Bridget: Honey?",
        "Nick: Yeah?",
        "Bridget: You think we should go ahead and open the champagne?",
        "Nick: Sure, why not? Why don't you douse them with it? Can we get out of here, please? I don't need a front-row seat to this.",
        "Bridget: Is it that hard for you to see my mother with someone else? No, I'm serious, Nick. I'd like you to tell me the truth. Seeing the two of them together, does it bother you that much? Look at me, Nick. I'm carrying your child. I'm about to marry you. I deserve to know the truth. Is it uncomfortable for you to see my mother with another man? The truth, Nick."
