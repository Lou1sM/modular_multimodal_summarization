        "Grandma Stephanie answers Ally's questions about Taylor, if it would it make her mommy sad if she loves her? Stephanie replies that her mommy loved her and wanted her to be happy, so she thinks it would be okay; for Thorne too. Thorne joins in and gives Ally pictures and she adds one of Taylor to the Darla shrine table. Thorne remarks to his mother that all of a sudden with no disrespect to Darla, Ally is practically planning their future together, he and Taylor and Phoebe. And waking up this morning with Taylor there felt right. Stephanie urges him to go with his instincts; sometimes out of great tragedy can come great joy and happiness.",
        "Hector makes a crack about Taylor spending the night at Thorne's and he warns her she is going way too fast. She wants him to stop talking like this. She has made a promise to Stephanie and she vows to keep it. Hector calls Stephanie to warn her this isn't going to work. Taylor will crack when she tells Thorne and he will hate her. It will all be Stephanie's doings. Stephanie says Hector is just jealous. Later Hector tells Taylor he hoped he could be there for her, fill a need in her life but she has moved on with Thorne. He professes his love for her, and he can't stay there if she wants to be intimate with another man. She agrees if this is going to turn into something inappropriate. Shane practices his little speech to Mrs. Forrester and asking her to write a check for one million dollars. He'll be gone. But, if he stays poor, she's going to jail and that doesn't make much sense. He drops by Taylor's and Phoebe goes and gets her mother. Thorne calls Taylor and they giggle over the turn of events and make a date for dinner that night. Finally able to catch her face to face, Shane tells Taylor this is not about landscaping. He saw what she did, he knows her little secret."

        "{Taylor Remembering}",
        "Stephanie: Well, then, let it go! Walk away from it. Now, let it end here. If he can live with it, if he can learn to live with it, then you can too. You owe it to Darla.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Oh, oh, oh. Hang on. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, you found your way out to the pool. So, here's the stairs.",
        "Hector: Amazing, isn't it?",
        "Taylor: Yeah.",
        "Hector: So, it's morning and you're just coming home. I take it that you stuck to your plan after all.",
        "Taylor: Yes, I spent the night at Thorne's. Okay?",
        "Hector: We're going too fast, Taylor. You're going too fast.",
        "Taylor: Hector, please.",
        "Hector: No, you have to be more cautious. You are just coming out of a very difficult time of your life. Carrying around this terrible secret that would destroy any chance of happiness that you could possibly have with Thorne. And send you to prison.",
        "Taylor: Okay, I want you to stop talking about this.",
        "Hector: Look, I know it was an accident. But will Thorne believe you? Will lieutenant baker, who smelled alcohol on your breath that night, will the judge?",

        "Shane: Mrs. Forrester, can I bother you for a second? I need -- Mrs. Forrester, I really need to talk to you for a second. That's not going to work either. Hey, Mrs. Forrester. Can I -- I need to explain some -- okay, look. Mrs. Forrester, don't take this personally, okay? Listen, I know what they say about this town. It's all about how you know and that might be true, but I also think that maybe it's a little bit about what you know. 'Cause you see something, I was there. I was there the night you ran over that woman. Darla. Oh, yeah. I saw the whole thing. Oh, what do I want from you? What I want from you? Well, Mrs. Forrester, let's just say I'm a guy who doesn't want to worry about too much about where his next meal is going to come from. And you? You're that woman that this hit and run killer who's out here, just walking around, free -- you can just write a check right now for $1 million. You're never going to miss it. Whoa, whoa, wait a second. Let me finish. Let me finish, please. It's just exactly what I said. You write me a check for $1 million. And I'll never bother you again. You'll never see me ever. Gone. Because let me tell you something, if I stay poor, you're going to jail. And that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, because you've got a wonderful life here. You're rich. Well-respected. I mean, you got a great future ahead of you. You really want to throw all of this away? Do you? Well, Shane, that's it. That's it. Right there. It's going to work. That's got to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandria: Daddy? Can you take the rest of the pictures to my room?",

        "Thorne: Oh, I'll tell you, kids. They're so amazing.",
        "Stephanie: They heal quickly, you know? If it's under the right circumstances.",
        "Thorne: You know, all of a sudden without any disrespect to Darla, Ally's practically planning our future together, Taylor, Phoebe, and me.",
        "Stephanie: Children are very practical. They just like to know they have parameters and that they're safe.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, well I just assumed that I ever got involved with a woman again, she would feel that I was betraying her mother.",
        "Stephanie: I understand Taylor spent the night here last night.",
        "Thorne: And phoebe too. It was a pajama party only, okay? But I do have to say waking up this morning with Taylor in the house -- it felt right.",
        "Alexandria: Daddy, can you help me with this?",
        "Thorne: Yeah. Hang on. I'm coming, honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: Look, you need to think this through. Okay, let's just say that everything progresses with you and Thorne, where does that lead? To the altar, right?",
        "Taylor: I don't know.",
        "Hector: Well, if you love someone, you're not gonna stand up in front of your friends and your family and lie and hide a secret like this from your husband to-be.",
        "Taylor: Okay, okay, stop. You're way, way ahead of yourself there, Hector, all right? I'm just trying to be there for Thorne and Alexandria right now, that's all I'm focusing on. I don't want to talk about this anymore, okay? You're driving me crazy. I'm going to go get something. I'll be right back. Don't move. Don't fall in the pool.",

        "Hector: Stephanie, it's Hector.",
        "Stephanie: Hello, Hector. What can I do for you?",
        "Hector: It's not working. You've got to know that.",
        "Stephanie: What?",
        "Hector: Thorne and Taylor. Okay, she's all right now, but she's gonna crack. She spent the night at Thorne's last night.",
        "Stephanie: Hector, this is exactly what I knew was going to happen. You're jealous.",
        "Hector: Stephanie, I am the voice of reason here. You're playing matchmaker is a double-edged sword. The closer she gets to Thorne, the more obligated she'll feel to tell him the truth. Her stomach is tied in knots, Stephanie. She's a wreck over this. When she tells Thorne the truth, he's not going to forgive her. He's going to hate her. And it will be your doing. And I know that you love Taylor as a daughter. But this relationship is doomed.",
        "Taylor: Hey, I'm back, Hector. I found a couple of extra towels. Who was that on the phone?",
        "Hector: Oh, just a friend of mine at the station. I'm looking out for you, Taylor. Even though, I'm blind, I can still do that.",
        "Taylor: Don't bring that into it, Hector.",
        "Hector: Well, what else do I have to offer?",
        "Taylor: That's a very unhealthy mindset.",
        "Hector: Whatever. I'm going to get good at living in the dark, Taylor. But I can't fool myself. There was a time when I thought I could be there for you. Maybe fill a space in your life. But then, this happened. And Thorne was there with his little girl and his broken heart. Let's face it. You don't need me and you never will. So, it's time that I moved out, and got on with my life.",

        "Phoebe: Oh, hi.",
        "Shane: Hey, Phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: Shane, right?",
        "Shane: Yeah, Shane.",
        "Phoebe: How are you liking landscaping?",
        "Shane: Ah, it's not too great, actually. I'm really more of a carpenter by trade.",
        "Phoebe: Well, why don't you do that instead?",
        "Shane: Well, that's what I would like to do. I would like to work for the studios, but you know, the union's not hiring right now.",
        "Phoebe: Oh, that sucks.",
        "Shane: Yeah, it does.",
        "Phoebe: I think, wasn't Harrison Ford a carpenter before he got his big break in \"Star Wars?\"",
        "Shane: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. I heard about that. Yeah. But I, you know something? I'm sick and tired of sitting around, waiting for my big break.",
        "Phoebe: So, what's up? Why did you come by?",
        "Shane: Well, I need to know, is your mom here?",
        "Phoebe: I think so. I haven't seen her in awhile. But --",
        "Shane: Remember what I told you yesterday, I needed to talk to her?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah --",
        "Shane: It's important.",
        "Phoebe: Okay.",
        "Shane: I got a business proposition for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: What was that all about?",
        "Thorne: Getting the glue opened.",
        "Stephanie: Oh.",
        "Thorne: She's going to make a collage after all.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, did you put an old shirt on her or something?",
        "Thorne: No, of course not. You know what's good, to see her getting back to her normal self. Doing things that she used to do, it's a relief.",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, what about Ridge?. It wasn't that long ago and what happened with Darla was a really tragic, tragic situation, but sometimes, sometimes out of great tragedy comes great joy and happiness. You and Taylor have both suffered a lot of loss.",
        "Thorne: Do you think Darla is smiling at Taylor and me?",
        "Stephanie: Knowing her? Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Hector, um, when I told you, you can stay here, I said that because I wanted to see you gain your independence. I wanted to help you, so you can cope with disability. Because I want to see you have the fullest life possible. So, that you could move on.",
        "Hector: I know, and I accepted your offer, but in the back of my mind -- I thought that --",
        "Taylor: Okay, let's face it. You weren't completely honest.",
        "Hector: Why? Because I couldn't put my thoughts into words? You can't tell when a man is fascinated by you? When the sound of your voice, the smell of you, makes him want to hold you in his arms and love you?",
        "Taylor: Well, I thought under the circumstances, there were more important things to deal with first.",
        "Hector: I didn't want a nurse, Taylor. I wanted you. But you're moving on with Thorne. I can't be here if I know that you want to be intimate with another man.",
        "Taylor: Well then, maybe you should move out. This is starting to get inappropriate.",
        "Hector: I'm sorry. It's just the way I feel. I want you to be happy. But I wanted to be a part of that happiness.",
        "Taylor: Well, I made a commitment to you, okay, Hector? Because you know, I wanted to help you. I wanted to help you get through this first major part of this adjustment. And I don't know why you can't just put all of these feelings aside and let me help you get through that challenge without expectations.",
        "Hector: I don't think I can.",
        "Taylor: Okay, well, then just think about what I said. Because this is going to be a very difficult period in your life. And however you start out, is how it's going to affect you the rest of your life.",
        "Phoebe: Mom? I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's a guy at the door to see you.",
        "Taylor: Who is it?",
        "Phoebe: Shane, the landscaping guy from yesterday.",
        "Taylor: What does he want?",
        "Phoebe: He seemed kind of nervous. I think it's something about a business proposition?",
        "Taylor: Okay. Think about what I said, Hector, all right?",
        "Phoebe: You okay?",
        "Hector: Phoebe, I will be there for your mother if she ever needs me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Oh, hello. Shawn?",
        "Shane: No, Shane, Mrs. Forrester.",
        "Taylor: Oh, Shane. Yeah, my daughter said you wanted to talk to me about something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Sweetheart, don't worry about Taylor's children. Or Ridge, or anyone, all right? Because no one in the family is going to stand in the way of a good thing.",
        "Thorne: Thanks, Mom.",
        "Stephanie: It's my job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Oh, oh, listen. I'm pretty sure I know exactly what this is about. Everybody wants to do it. They want to move those pots on the back. I don't want to move those, I don't want to touch them. I want to leave the tall pots in back --",
        "Shane: No, no, no, Mrs forrester. This is not what this is about. It's even easier for you to understand. I mean, this is like, it's black and white, really. [Cell phone rings] Okay, um, oh, yeah, yeah. I've got to take this. Hang on. One second. Hello, hey there.",
        "Thorne: Well, hi, yourself.",
        "Taylor: So, how are you? What's up?",
        "Thorne: Other than, I miss you already? Nothing. No, that's not true. What's up is I want us to have dinner together, tonight.",
        "Taylor: Well, a girl's got to eat, I suppose.",
        "Thorne: Are you playing hard-to-get?",
        "[Taylor laughs]",
        "Taylor: If I was playing hard-to-get, I would tell you next week.",
        "Thorne: Like you can wait that long, huh? [Thorne chuckles] Is this really happening?",
        "Taylor: I think, maybe it is.",
        "Thorne: It's a new beginning for both of us. Where yesterday is a dream and tomorrow is a vision of hope.",
        "Taylor: You have no idea how good that sounds. Oh, listen, I've got somebody standing in my living room. I'll call you right back and we can finish up the plans, okay?",
        "Thorne: It's a deal.",
        "Taylor: All right. Bye.",
        "Thorne: Bye.",
        "Taylor: Oh, okay. So, now where were we? Oh, my daughter also said you had, like a business proposal, or something? That not is not going work --",
        "Shane: No, no, this is not what this is all about. It's not even about landscaping. It's about what I saw. It's about what you are going to give me because what I saw. So, no more phone calls. And no more of these interruptions. Please, listen to what I have to tell you. Mrs. Forrester -- your secret, I know what it is."
