    "Recap": [
        "Caroline and Ridge are both giddy that they are married. Nicole tells Thomas that he kissed her out of the blue for no reason and she did not see that coming. She says she is flattered if it had anything to do with her but something tells her that it didn't. He heads her off and says he and Caroline were over a long time ago; almost before it started. Now she is marrying his dad and that is a line he will not cross. Liam says that was quite a scene with Ivy as she did not expect it. Steffy tells him they need to let Quinn know she is on her own now. He questions her decision but Steffy says she had no choice. She could not let her blackmail her. Ivy grouses to Wyatt that she can not believe that Steffy fired her. Wyatt takes her side and says they will regret it. Over lunch Bill does not want to talk about Caroline as she is marrying Ridge today. Katie says she is ready for a new challenge and a new project, something she can sink her teeth into. Bill says then he will get it for her. Ridge tells Caroline tomorrow he will go to city hall and make everything legal. He knows she is going to be a wonderful mother. Ivy is not sure how much longer she will even be welcome at the Forrester estate. Wyatt says it does not matter. He meant it when he said they would regret what they have done. Ridge hopes Caroline does not feel left out with her family and friends not being at their wedding. She says no, all she needs is him. They kiss.",
        "Liam says his brother does not make idle threats so he does not know what he will do since Steffy is President of the company. Steffy says she does not trust Wyatt either so she may have to fire him too. Wyatt calls Bill and wants to meet with him. Nicole tells Thomas that he is good. He'd have to be being the son of Ridge Forrester. Thomas says some day he will be better. She says she knows, he has that look, the determination and confidence. Thomas looks at his I-phone and sees that Caroline has posted a picture. She is married to his dad. Ridge tells Caroline that his life was just fine until she came along and now he is humbled that she is his. She says he made it all happen, it was not a dream of hers. Liam tells Steffy that she looks different. She says yes because a weight has been lifted off her shoulder and now they can get on with their lives as they should have a long time ago. She considers this chapter closed. Wyatt invites Katie to stay too while he tells his dad that Ivy was unceremoniously dumped from Forrester. He asks if his position at FC is the same. He is still dirt there as long as Ridge is in control. Bill asks him to get to the point. Wyatt thinks Spencer Publication is where he belongs.......another industry that can be brought under SP. He wants to start another fashion house to compete with Liam and Steffy and take them down. Caroline and Ridge kiss as they undress each other and both think back on their meeting, guiding the hands in design and how magical it felt."

        "Caroline: I can't believe we're married!",
        "Ridge: Yeah, we did that.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] I'm your wife.",
        "Ridge: Yes, you are. Permanently. You vowed, so you can't get away from me.",
        "Caroline: You are so stuck with me.",
        "[Waves crashing]",
        "Ridge: That makes me very happy.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Um, wow. Didn't see that coming.",
        "Thomas: Good. I try not to be predictable.",
        "Nicole: Well, you know, I can't accuse you of that because you just kissed me out of the blue for no reason.",
        "Thomas: Oh, I had a reason.",
        "Nicole: Like to hear it.",
        "Thomas: Has anyone ever told you that you talk too much?",
        "Nicole: Oh, do you use that line a lot? Because it's outplayed.",
        "Thomas: Really?",
        "Nicole: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: You know, I'm willing to learn new lines if you're down to coach me.",
        "Nicole: And coaching you should be my job?",
        "Thomas: Do it for the cause.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] You're cute. And, you know, I might be flattered by this sudden overwhelming desire to kiss me, if it had anything to do with me. But something tells me it didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You're awfully dark.",
        "Bill: I need something stronger than a glass of wine. My niece is marrying Forrester, Katie. Not exactly cause for celebration.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm very proud of you that you supported her.",
        "Bill: I had to bite my tongue so hard, it bled.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Well, that was a scene.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: I don't think Ivy expected to be fired, not like that.",
        "Steffy: No, she thought she could blackmail me, own me, and just keep working here like nothing happened. I don't want to talk about her. Let's just move forward. Oh, we have to tell Quinn that she's on her own.",
        "Liam: Steffy, are you sure about this?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I think Quinn's perfectly capable.",
        "Liam: That's not what I'm talking about. I mean firing Ivy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I can't believe it. I mean, I know that it happened, but she fired me. Steffy actually fired me.",
        "Wyatt: I know. It was outrageous.",
        "Ivy: And then Liam? God, he will do anything Steffy wants.",
        "Wyatt: There's no surprise there. He's kind of whipped.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, I thought that maybe he would at least come to my defense just for old time's sake.",
        "Wyatt: The way Liam and Steffy treated you is unacceptable. And when I told them they were gonna regret it, I meant it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, there's something I want to run by you, just give you a heads up. I'm looking for a new project.",
        "Bill: At your service.",
        "Katie: Well, that's very kind, but I was actually talking about work.",
        "Bill: What do you want to do?",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I just -- I need something to sink my teeth into, you know, a new challenge, something to allow me to flex some new muscles.",
        "Bill: Then let's get that for you.",
        "Katie: Really? You're okay with it?",
        "Bill: Will it make you happy?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Bill: Then I'll make it happen.",
        "Katie: Okay, well, that was easy. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: This place.",
        "Ridge: Knew you'd like it.",
        "Caroline: Oh. Breathtaking. I'm so glad it was just the two of us.",
        "Ridge: It's our first day as husband and wife. I don't want to share that with anybody.",
        "Caroline: It's just so us, you know? How we are as a team, always off in our own little world. But I guess that's gonna end when we have our baby.",
        "Ridge: You're gonna make a wonderful mom.",
        "Caroline: I just want to -- I want to enjoy being married to you for a little while. Just bask in it.",
        "Ridge: Tomorrow we're gonna be stuck in traffic going down to city hall and making everything legal.",
        "Caroline: It's not gonna make me feel more like your wife than I do right now.",
        "Ridge: No?",
        "Caroline: Mnh-mnh. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I believe you kissed me to shut me up, but not because I talk too much. It was the subject I brought up.",
        "Thomas: Look, I know you think that there's lingering... whatever going on, but you're way off base. I mean, Caroline and I were over almost as soon as we started. It just wasn't that deep. And now she's marrying my dad. That is a line that I would never cross.",
        "Nicole: Okay, then. Why did you kiss me?",
        "Thomas: I mean, you really didn't give me any choice, standing there all gorgeous. You got to ask?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I had to fire Ivy. She left me no choice.",
        "Liam: You know, technically you could have let her stay and just dealt exclusively with Quinn on the jewelry line.",
        "Steffy: Oh, really? Just give Ivy all this time to regroup so she can betray me again? Business is business, and I can't work with someone that I don't trust. Ivy's out. And she's not coming back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: How great it would be to think that Steffy and Liam would actually regret the way that they've treating me.",
        "Wyatt: What? You don't think it could happen?",
        "Ivy: Come on, Wyatt. Those two get everything they want. They don't care about other people. All they care about is if they're happy. And if they're together -- let's not forget about that.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I might not be able to do anything about together. But I bet there's a way to shake up happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Ohh. I know that look. Please don't tell me you think I should bring Ivy back.",
        "Liam: No. No, I get it. Holding that video over your head and using it to blackmail you, that's inexcusable. And who could blame you for not trusting her? That's on Ivy. But... you did surprise me.",
        "Steffy: How?",
        "Liam: Well, because we made a pact and we said it would stay buried forever, and I thought it was done. And now Ivy's fired over it.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Yeah, I didn't want this, either. But I can't shake what she did to me. You know, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I don't trust her. And then seeing her at the photo shoot today -- you know, she has the audacity to think that she'd still be the face of Forrester after blackmailing me? I mean, come on.",
        "Liam: I know, I know. I get that. All I'm saying is, I wish it hadn't come to this.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, so do I.",
        "Liam: And what Wyatt said when he left, about us regretting the decision? I wonder what that means.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Do I detect a plan?",
        "Wyatt: Well, I'm still wading through the finer points, but as soon as I figure it out, you'll be the first to know. Or the second.",
        "Ivy: Wow, you really do have my back, don't you?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Well, it's a beautiful back. I mean, how could I not?",
        "Ivy: It's just nice to know that I can count on you.",
        "Wyatt: It's not a chore.",
        "Ivy: Well, I should, uh, I should go. It has been a long day.",
        "Wyatt: She says with admirable restraint. I mean, it's been a day from Hell. Are you sure you don't want to stay? I'm a good masseuse.",
        "Ivy: I need to go back to that place that I've called home because I don't know how much longer I'm gonna be welcome at the Forrester estate.",
        "Wyatt: It won't come to that, believe me.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, I don't know that for sure. Steffy's influence is everywhere.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy. What I said to them earlier about regretting what they did to you... that's gonna happen. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Actually, yeah, I have to ask. Hot rich dude suddenly lays a kiss on me, and alarms go off.",
        "Thomas: Who? Me? No, it must be the guy behind me. Should I say I'm sorry?",
        "Nicole: No. Not offended. And I wasn't complaining. More like assessing your motives.",
        "Thomas: Sometimes a rose is just a rose.",
        "Nicole: Yeah. But roses have thorns.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: My mind is so blown right now.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: We just got married in the most romantic ceremony ever.",
        "Ridge: You don't think you're missing out 'cause your friends and family weren't here?",
        "Caroline: No. All I ever need is you.",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I mean, my brother doesn't make idle threats. I'm just not seeing what he can do exactly. You're president of the company. You have the absolute right to hire and fire as you please.",
        "Steffy: And Ivy can say whatever she wants to my dad. He'll have my back. It's just so -- it's so crazy to me. At one time, I thought Ivy and me, that we could be friends.",
        "Liam: Well, at one time, I thought Ivy wasn't capable of blackmail.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, and to be so good at it. I'm just grateful that it's over and that Wyatt got Ivy to delete the video. But he better be careful. Aligning himself with Ivy could backfire. And if I don't trust him, he's gone, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bill: Hey, son.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, uh, I need to see you.",
        "Bill: Everything all right?",
        "Wyatt: It will be after we talk.",
        "Bill: All right, well, I'm just finishing up lunch with Katie, and then we'll head over to your place.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, great. Thanks. See you soon.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: You're good.",
        "Thomas: Thanks.",
        "Nicole: Then again, you'd have to be. Son of Ridge Forrester and all. You got a lot to live up to.",
        "Thomas: I'll be better than him one day.",
        "Nicole: So, it's competitive between you two?",
        "Thomas: I mean, there's that, but it's more about the evolution of it. Like, my dad learned from his dad, incorporated elements and themes and created his own style. I'll do the same with him and make it better.",
        "Nicole: I believe you. You got that look in your eye.",
        "Thomas: What look is that?",
        "Nicole: Confidence. Determination. Ambition. Guy who knows where he's going and he's already on his way.",
        "Thomas: And my eyes told you all that?",
        "Nicole: Windows to the soul. If you know what you're looking for.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Thomas: Wow. Caroline just posted a picture. She and dad are married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Seagulls calling]",
        "Caroline: You did all this?",
        "Ridge: I sure did.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] Where'd you even find the time?",
        "Ridge: Got to make time. It's your wedding day. You deserved a memory.",
        "Caroline: You've already given me so many. And not just today.",
        "Ridge: I'm gonna give you more. How'd you do that? You just got prettier. Stop doing that.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] I'm just insanely happy.",
        "Ridge: So am I. My life was good. It was -- it was fine. And then you came along. And now I am humbled to call you mine.",
        "Caroline: You know, when I first came to L.A., the only thing I wanted was just be in the same room and breathe the same air as the world's most talented designer and just maybe, maybe he would look at my work, just maybe.",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Caroline: Yes, really. I can't even call this a dream come true because I didn't even dare to dream it. I had no idea that this is just everything that I could ever want. And you made it happen.",
        "Ridge: I want to keep making things happen because I need you to be happy.",
        "Caroline: I love you. Husband.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I love you. Wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You look different.",
        "Steffy: Really? How?",
        "Liam: I don't know. Lighter somehow.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like this weight has been lifted. We can move on with our lives. Our future. 'Cause we waited far too long for that.",
        "Liam: Yeah, we did. I want that, too.",
        "Steffy: The video is gone. And Ivy's not holding anything over me. And yeah, no matter how angry Wyatt gets, it's not gonna do anything to us. So I consider this chapter closed.",
        "Liam: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So what's going on?",
        "Katie: Hey, you know, if this is between you two, I can wait outside.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no. Stay. Uh, this has to do with you, too, actually.",
        "Bill: What is it?",
        "Wyatt: Ivy was fired from Forrester today.",
        "Katie: What?! Why?!",
        "Wyatt: It's...complicated.",
        "Bill: Ridge dumped her just like that?",
        "Wyatt: No, not Ridge. It was Steffy. And Ivy didn't want to go quietly. She had security escort her out of the building.",
        "Katie: Are you kidding me? That is ridiculous.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. It was horrible. And Liam didn't do anything. He didn't stand up for her. He didn't say anything for a woman who he supposedly loved!",
        "Bill: So this is about Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Yes! Yes! This is about Liam. I am upset. Not only does he get president of Spencer, he gets the V.P. position at Forrester Creations. He doesn't even know anything about fashion! Nothing whatsoever!",
        "Bill: Wyatt, Wyatt, if you're asking me to give you Liam's position...",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no. That's not what I'm asking.",
        "Katie: Okay, then what do you want?",
        "Wyatt: You gave Liam control of your 12.5% of the company, right? Has that benefited you in any way? Has your position changed at Forrester in any way? No. Nothing has changed. You still don't have a say there. You're dirt to them. You're never gonna have a say at Forrester, and neither will I, not as long as Ridge is controlling things. No matter how hard I work, no matter how deserving I should have it, whatever, like, it doesn't even --",
        "Bill: Wyatt, get to the point.",
        "Wyatt: I want to carve out my own space in my family business. What am I doing at Forrester Creations anyway? Spencer Publications is where I belong. Look, I'm not asking for just a job or a seat on the board or whatever. I'm talking about something bigger here, another industry that can be brought under Spencer.",
        "Katie: What do you mean, industry?",
        "Bill: Jewelry line? You and Ivy bring it over here?",
        "Wyatt: I want to start a design house here to compete with Forrester and to compete with Liam and Steffy. To take them down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Singer: I've wanted this for so long when everything feels so right there are no rules and words cannot explain I never knew that I could change the clouds are gone and I can finally see when at first your heart does not succeed, it's not because you don't believe it just takes time to heal and then it all can be revealed and when you hold my hand, you hold my soul the power makes our bodies whole I know it's you and me love's masterpiece ohh, love's masterpiece"
