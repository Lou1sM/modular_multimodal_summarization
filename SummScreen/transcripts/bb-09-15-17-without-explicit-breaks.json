    "Recap": [
        "Brooke repeats what Bill just said \u0096 that he is stepping down from the business so she wants to know what he did to make Liam do that. Steffy tells Liam that do not shut the door on Bill; he is willing to give a little. Liam says his dad is an arsonist and he cannot condone that. There is no forgiving him. And he could have hurt Liam when he cold cocked him. In the midst of almost making a move on Katie Wyatt tells her he was shaken earlier today when his dad took a leave of absence and made Liam CEO. He is completely unfit to run Spencer Publications and Liam has a whole new plan to roll out. Katie says that is certainly a bombshell. He says he has been working a lot with his dad lately and there was no sign of this coming on. Something is definitely not right here and with no warning. Something happened between him and Liam but this does not make sense. Liam tells Steffy that the only thing that happened is that Bill is using her to try and get the company back, but he is in charge now, period. There are things he wants done. He has the power now and he is going to use it to get things done. There is no place now for his dad. Brooke says it is obvious that Liam has something on Bill so he needs to tell her what he did. Bill says Spencer Tower, it was finally becoming a reality for Sky and nothing was going to stop him ..whatever he had to do. She mentions the fire and there was no insurance for Spectra but accidents do happen so no need for him to feel guilty. He blurts out that the fire was not an accident. She wants to know what it was then.",
        "Wyatt fingers his sword necklace and says this meant so much to him when Bill gave it to him. It meant he finally had a family besides his mother, of course. And then they discovered they were a lot alike and he really felt like a Spencer. Katie takes his hand and leads him to the bed. Liam asks Steffy why she is looking at him that way. She says he is changing. He says yes a welcome change from Bill. Brooke is stunned and wonders how Bill could do such a thing as to have the fire ordered and now Liam has recorded his confession. Bill groans that he trusted him and gave him everything and now he has set him up and he will go to the police if Bill does not step down. She is aghast that he did this the night before the Spectra showing; someone could have been killed. She rails at him this is criminal behavior and she mentions that she has overlooked some of this flaws before and still loved him, but this is much more. She absolutely cannot believe he did this. With a smile on her face, Katie lays with Wyatt and says it does not matter who knows about them, she is along for the ride. He can have her all he wants. Steffy says of course she wants Liam to be who he is, but Bill is sorry about the fire. Liam says funny when he was laying there on the floor with his Dad looking down at him he did not see remorse in his eyes when he said he would decimate him. Liam still says no he will not give his dad another chance. Bill tells Brooke with a situation like this the less people that know is better. He has done things before he regretted. She wants to know what and he tells her he hit Liam because he was provoked when Liam told him he would call the police. Again Brooke is disgusted when she hears the details and does not want to hear anymore. She walks away and says she cannot even look at him. He says she still loves him and he recognizes now that he made a horrible mistake and he learned a painful lesson, so she can holler at him or throw things at him but please do not go. He cannot lose her. All she can manage is a cold, hard stare."

        "Brooke: You said that liam's blackmailing you.",
        "Bill: Yes. My own son.",
        "Brooke: And you stepped down from spencer publications because he's forcing you out. Okay, this is all making a horrible kind of sense. Spencer is your baby! You love that company! There's no way you would ever walk away! Unless... what happened? Obviously liam has something on you. What did you do, bill?!",
        "Steffy: What bill did was wrong, and you and your father, you are in a precarious situation right now. And if you're not careful, your relationship could be ruined for the rest of your life. Bill is willing to meet you in the middle.",
        "Liam: I'm not interested.",
        "Steffy: You're angry, and you want to teach bill a lesson. Well, fine. Mission accomplished. Now it's time to find a mutual understanding.",
        "Liam: Why -- [ Scoffs ] Why would I want to do that?",
        "Steffy: Because he's your father, liam! Don't shut the door on him! Be willing to give a little.",
        "Wyatt: Agh!",
        "Katie: What? What -- what -- what is wrong?",
        "[ Chuckles ]",
        "Wyatt: I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm so sorry. I just -- I-I-I can't seem to shake what happened to me today. The craziest thing.",
        "Katie: What? What?",
        "Wyatt: Dad -- dad stepped down.",
        "Katie: Stepped down?",
        "Wyatt: From spencer publications.",
        "Katie: [ Chuckling ] You're joking.",
        "Wyatt: No, he took a sudden leave of absence, and apparently his mind, because, uh... he made liam C.E.O. So then I went to go see dad, and he confirmed it.",
        "Katie: That's crazy!",
        "Wyatt: I know! Liam is completely unfit to -- to run spencer! And I thought dad knew that! I was sure he knew that! Oh, and get this. Liam's got a whole new business plan he wants to roll out, and -- and god knows what that's gonna be.",
        "Katie: Do you think that this is what steffy was warning me about?",
        "Wyatt: Could be.",
        "Katie: I mean, it's certainly a bombshell.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Katie: There was no clue that this was gonna happen?",
        "Wyatt: No. And I've been working closely with dad a lot lately, and -- and there has been no sign. Not at any point was he ever, like, wanting a vacation. It's -- it's absurd.",
        "Katie: No, I mean, the bill I know never wanted to go on vacation.",
        "Wyatt: No, something's definitely not right here.",
        "Liam: What are you doing right now?",
        "Steffy: I'm trying to keep this family together.",
        "Liam: Do -- [ Scoffs ] Do you have any idea how much i don't want to hear my own wife defend the indefensible? My father is a liar, a cheat, a bully, and an arsonist. What if one of the spectras had been inside the building, hmm? What if somebody got killed? What if -- what if I had hit my head on the corner of this desk when my dad clocked me? You want me to sit down and have a little chat with him? Steffy... I love you, but I have said all I have to say to that man. There's no forgiving him.",
        "Brooke: Whatever you did is serious!",
        "Bill: And I'll work it out. I always do.",
        "Brooke: God, bill, stop blowing me off! Look, I hate to ask, but how did you give up your leadership and just hand it over to liam? Obviously he has something on you! How did he blackmail you into making him C.E.O. Of your company?!",
        "Katie: I don't understand how things could change so drastically overnight.",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Katie: And I can't imagine bill ever leaving the company, but if he did, we were talking about how he would make you C.E.O.",
        "Wyatt: Right! That's what he led me to believe. I mean, he didn't say it outright. He, you know, he always says things by implication. But, I mean, all those conversations over steak and scotch, like how much alike we are, it'S...",
        "Katie: Well, that's true, and it's probably something that he's proud of.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but then this happens? No warning? He -- he -- he leaves the company and then anoints liam?",
        "Katie: And he doesn't give you a straight answer when you confront him about it.",
        "Wyatt: Exactly. And liam's acting weird, too. What could possibly have happened between those two? And liam? Seriously? It doesn't even make any sense.",
        "Steffy: Your father deeply regrets what happened.",
        "Liam: The only thing my dad regrets is that he got caught, and now he's paying for it. He's using you, steffy. He's just trying to get me to change my mind and give him his power back. Don't -- don't kid yourself this is about anything else.",
        "Steffy: I don't care about the company. You two can divvy it up however you want.",
        "Liam: I'm not doing any divvying. I'm in charge now. Period. You know, if I squint, I can actually see why my dad got off on sitting in this chair, because power means you can get things done. Well, as it happens, there are things, things I want to get done. So I'm gonna go ahead, and I'm gonna hold on to this power, and I'm gonna use it for good instead of giving it back to my dad so he can wreak more havoc. It's a new dawn, steffy. There's no place at spencer for my dad's ways.",
        "Brooke: Please, bill. Please just let me in. Explain to me how liam can blackmail you out of your own company.",
        "Bill: Spencer tower. I just wanted to build my crowning achievement. I mean, I held that vision in my head for so long, and it was finally becoming a reality. My skyscraper would dominate the L.A. Skyline from the perfect location, and nothing and nobody was going to stop me. That building was going up. Whatever I had to do.",
        "Brooke: Okay, well, I don't understand. That building is still going up. There was a fire at spectra, and you said that they didn't have insurance, so they had to sell the property, and C.J. Agreed to sell it to you.",
        "Bill: The fire.",
        "Brooke: It was horrible. They didn't deserve that.",
        "Bill: Seems to be the consensus.",
        "Brooke: I really feel bad for the spectras, actually. I mean, when the original sally left, the building got neglected, and then young sally came in, and she did whatever she could to keep the doors open. I mean, I really think if she had one more day, they would have succeeded. It's unfortunate, but accidents do happen. And if you're feeling guilty about buying the property --",
        "Bill: It wasn't an accident.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry?",
        "Bill: The spectra fire wasn't an accident.",
        "Brooke: Then if it wasn't an accident, what was it, bill?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. You know, when -- when my father gave me this sword, it meant everything to me. Just so much symbolism in it. I actually had a father. That he accepted me and there was a family that I belonged to. Besides my mother, of course. And the more I got to know him, I just... I realized how much of a spencer that I really am, all the time we spend together hanging out. And I know dad loves liam. But he and I just -- we connected on this whole different level.",
        "Katie: You saw yourselves in each other.",
        "Wyatt: Exactly. That's why I thought I was next in line. If dad was ever gonna resign, like... there's more going on here.",
        "Katie: I think you're right. And we will figure it out together.",
        "Wyatt: Together.",
        "Liam: All right. Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Steffy: I've just never seen you talk this way. You're changing, liam.",
        "Liam: You don't think it's about time? Time to stop enabling every heinous thing my father decides to set loose and start standing up for what I believe in? What a welcome change that is.",
        "Brooke: That fire was horrible. Sally spectra lost everything. The building, her designs, her future.",
        "Bill: I know.",
        "Brooke: You said that the fire wasn't an accident, which implies... do you think it was deliberately set?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Brooke: Who would do such a thing? Who hates the spectras that much?",
        "Bill: It wasn't about hate. I just couldn't wait any longer for them to fail. So I called justin in. I ordered it.",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Bill: Liam knows. That's what he's using to blackmail me. He recorded me without my knowledge. I mean, can you imagine? My own son betraying me that way! I trusted that boy! I gave him everything, and how does he repay me? By setting me up! He said that if I didn't resign and appoint him C.E.O., He would go to the cops!",
        "Brooke: You...set fire to that building?",
        "Bill: I didn't light the match, but yes. I ordered it.",
        "Brooke: [ Voice breaking ] You ordered it? Arson! The day before their show, you -- you committed arson?! My god, bill! What are you thinking?! You could have killed all those people!",
        "Bill: No, no, no, no. We made sure there was nobody in the building.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god. What difference does it make? Sally ended up in the hospital!",
        "Bill: I know that! And -- and I feel terrible about it! I mean, how was I supposed to know they were gonna come back and run into a burning building?",
        "Brooke: My god. [ Sighs ] I used to admire the way you ran your business. Not that I agreed with all of your methods. And I loved you for you who were no matter all your flaws! Now this? This criminal behavior! How could you? How could you?!",
        "Katie: I never dreamed that this could happen, you and me.",
        "Wyatt: It's because you've been overthinking it.",
        "Katie: Hmm. Guess you're right. Not anymore.",
        "Wyatt: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Katie: I'm just along for the ride.",
        "Wyatt: It's been a pretty good one so far, hasn't it?",
        "Katie: Yeah. One of the best.",
        "Wyatt: \"One of\"? \"One of the best\"?",
        "Katie: Well, you know, like top five or six.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my -- I am gonna have to do so much better.",
        "Katie: [ Chuckles ] Okay, top three.",
        "Wyatt: Yes. Making headway. I just want to tell you how nice it is to be able to come over here and just shake off the crazy. I'm -- I'm glad I have you. Not -- not that I, like, i presume that I \"have you.\" Like, you know...",
        "Katie: You can have me all you want.",
        "Steffy: Of course you should stand up for what you believe in. No one's saying you shouldn'T.",
        "Liam: So -- so what? You just want me to kiss and make up with my dad? All is forgiven? No big deal burning out the spectras?",
        "Steffy: Bill made a mistake. He admits it, and he regrets it.",
        "Liam: The only thing he regrets is losing. Don't believe a word he says.",
        "Steffy: I think he means it. And he's sorry about the fire.",
        "Liam: You know, when I looked up at him from my vantage point on the floor after he smashed my face in, remorse was not the look in his eyes as he stood over me vowing to decimate me. Steffy, I've been manipulated by him so long. Don't let him do it to you, too.",
        "Steffy: I get why you're mad. I just have reservations about the way you're expressing it, because he is your father.",
        "Liam: No. No. I don't forgive him. And I won'T.",
        "Bill: Look, I'm not gonna stand here and make excuses. I did what I did, and I'm sorry about it. I shouldn't have done it.",
        "Brooke: You shouldn't have done it? It never even should have crossed your mind. It was vile, bill! The most disgusting thing I've ever heard! You actually almost killed people! And you think you're gonna get away with this?",
        "Bill: I'm not getting away with anything, brooke!",
        "Brooke: Liam is right! If I didn't force the issue, would you even have told me?",
        "Bill: I wanted to contain it. A situation like this, the fewer people that know, the better.",
        "Brooke: I'm your wife! What you do directly affects me!",
        "Bill: Yes. Yes. You're -- you're right. Of course you're right. I've done a lot of things lately that I regret.",
        "Brooke: Oh! There's more!",
        "Bill: I hit him.",
        "Brooke: Who? Liam? You hit your own son?",
        "Bill: I just reacted!",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god.",
        "Bill: I-I was angry! I was emotional! He was threatening to have me arrested! I mean, are -- are you hearing me?! He was trying to take my company! He was kicking me out of my own building!",
        "Brooke: You know what I hear? I hear that you love your company more than anything else! [ Sighs ] Where?!",
        "Bill: Where what?",
        "Brooke: Where did you hit him?!",
        "Bill: In the face.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god. Who are you? First you order arson, then you physically attack your son, and you lie to me! You lie to me about taking a leave of absence.",
        "Bill: It's what it is. I have no intention of letting this mutiny just sit. Are you kidding me?",
        "Brooke: [ Scoffs ] Yeah. Yeah, you're just planning your next plan of attack. It's gonna be disgusting and vile, I am sure. [ Sighs ] Were you ever gonna tell me? You know what? I don't want to know.",
        "Bill: What are you doing?",
        "Brooke: I don't want to be here with you here in this house, bill.",
        "Bill: Brooke!",
        "Brooke: No, I am so upset. I can't even look at you right now!",
        "Bill: Brooke. I screwed up. I know that. Liam, the fire, all of it. I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I recognize that. I learned my lesson! I swear! A very painful lesson! Please don't go. Yell at me. Throw things at me. Tell me I'm -- I'm -- I'm a irredeemable bastard! But don't go. Please. I might lose my son. I can't lose you."
