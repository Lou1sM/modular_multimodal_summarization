{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Ridge is demanding that Stephanie make peace and give her blessings for his and Brooke's wedding. Stephanie doesn't give much of a response in front of Ridge. When he leaves Brooke and Stephanie alone, Brooke starts in with her bratty attitude and Stephanie tells her that it will be \"a cold day in hell\" when she gives them her blessings. Brooke responds that Ridge will be very disappointed. Warning her not to gloat, smart Alec Brooke grabs a fake bouquet and tosses it at Stephanie's feet. Later on, Sally meets up with Stephanie at her new office. She wants to know what happened with Brooke, half expecting bad news. When Stephanie tells her what happened, Sally needs a drink. The two of them got sloshed and Stephanie falls on the floor. Sally helps her up and then gives her a makeover. She plops a potted plant on Stephanie's head and stars chopping away. They are gabbing and Stephanie tells Sally she should come work for them. When Sally is done, Stephanie's hair is about 2 inches long all over her head, a look Stephanie declares as \"hip-hop !\" Bridet is still being held by the fake doctor. Oscar isn't much help but Bridget elbows the goon and he falls to the floor when she bonks him on the head with a tray. The cops come and take him away and Bridget asks Oscar what kind of trouble he is in. Brooke is admiring her diamond ring when in comes Nick. He wants her to be happy. He has a gift for her. She opens it and finds a bracelet with a compass dangling from it. He says she should use it when she feels lost. Their conversation is halted when Ridge raises a ladder to the window and expects Brooke to elope with him."], "Recap Author": "Judy", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Brooke: That's a lovely gesture, Ridge.", "Ridge: Better come off sounding sincere, too.", "Stephanie: You're leaving?", "Ridge: Oh, I'm through putting words in your mouth, Mother.

It is merely a way to placate you.", "Brooke: You're just upset because you were outwitted. You really thought you had your revenge. Well, you know what, Stephanie? It's over. Because you lost, and I won.", "Stephanie: What did you win? A Forrester wannabe? A shadow of the company that you used to run?", "Brooke: We're going to turn this into the preeminent design house.

I could talk for days about that woman. You know, it's really nice being here with you like this. I mean, being on the same side for once is a nice change.
