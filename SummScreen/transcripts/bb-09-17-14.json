        "Hope is stunned and speechless when Liam tells her that Quinn pushed Ivy. He knows it does not make sense but Quinn was controlling things and he refuses to give her that power. They can get back their life. They do not have to let her poison them anymore. They do not have to give up. He's missed her so much. She says she misses him too and she does not regret anything even when things went wrong. He opines that Quinn can not keep them apart. She says she never gave up until she had to. Her life did not turn out the way she planned but she still has those memories. She says she knows he is trying to fix things but it's not right to blame it all on Quinn. Hope reminds him that she is married to Wyatt now. Liam's not showing up is not just on Quinn. He tells her to look into his eyes. He has proof. He tells her Ivy was sitting on the edge of the railing taking a picture. He debunks what Quinn said that she had a job interview in Paris. He shows her the scan of her passport and video of Quinn pushing Ivy in the river. Quinn put Ivy's life in danger to keep them apart. Quinn shows up at Bill's and says they have a problem. He says there is no we, so leave him out of any of her problems. He pours her a stiff drink while she asks for his help in telling Hope. He says Hope ought to come to that conclusion on her own. She wants him to go to Liam and tell him this does not change anything. Bill tells Quinn that he told Liam he would stop meddling so he is going to keep that promise. She says Wyatt is her whole world. He says if she doesn't want him to suffer then stop making his decisions for him. Hope makes Liam miserable and he's moving on. All these kids are finally making progress. It doesn't matter how Ivy fell. Liam did not show and Wyatt did and they all need to respect that.",
        "Hope can not wrap her brain around this right now, but she admits it does change her life. Liam says she chose him already and Quinn knew she chose him. She says she knows all of that but at 3 o'clock he did not show and Wyatt was there. She wants to know if Wyatt knows. He says he does now. He keeps repeating that Hope chose him. She gets a fax from Wyatt wanting her to come home. Liam tells her Wyatt will understand that they were robbed once again. He hugs her. She says she has to go and talk to Wyatt. Liam drags out a box of memories; Bill walks in. He says he is irritated that Quinn interfered again. Liam guesses that Quinn came to him to get Liam not to interfere in the marriage. He says this changes things between him and Hope. She was shocked. But he is not going to let Quinn come between them ever again. Bill reminds them they are married. Quinn walks in on Wyatt and he tells her to turn around and go home. She has done enough damage. She says Hope had her chance with Liam and never could make it work. With Wyatt it was easy. Quinn admits that she went to Bill and asked for his support. He can talk to Liam and get him to back off. Wyatt says that does not matter. It's up to Hope, not up to Bill or Liam. Why would she think he would want a woman because of Quinn's manipulations. He asks her to leave, he needs to talk to his wife and she is on her way. Too late, Hope walks in. Quinn starts explaining. Hope tells her to close her mouth. She is just as sick as she always was. All she cared about was keeping Liam away from Hope in Paris. Everyone was wrong to think that they could believe she would grow a moral bone in her body. Now she has hurt a lot of people and worst of all, her own son is a victim. She hopes he hates her as much as Hope does now."

        "Hope: Quinn pushed Ivy?",
        "Liam: Desperate to keep me from you, yeah.",
        "Hope: [Stutters] Sorry, this -- this just doesn't make any sense.",
        "Liam: Hope, listen. Quinn tricked you into a marriage that you weren't prepared for, and that changed the course of our lives. But I refuse to let her have that power over us. We can set the clock back. Right now. This is the moment, hope. This is it. It's 3:00 at the Eiffel tower. And I'm right by your side.",
        "Quinn: You don't have to question your relationship with hope.",
        "Wyatt: I kind of do, thanks to you.",
        "Quinn: I had to stop Liam. He doesn't belong with her. You do.",
        "Wyatt: That was for her to decide, not you.",
        "Quinn: Well, I didn't trust her to make the right decision.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my...",
        "Quinn: Look, I know it seems a bit unorthodox, but she's married to you and that's all that matters.",
        "Wyatt: Do you think I really want to be married to someone because my crazy mother conned her into it? No. Just go. Just get out of here.",
        "Quinn: I'm not leaving you.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I don't want to deal with you right now. You've already caused enough damage. So go.",
        "Quinn: Honey, I just w--",
        "Wyatt: Stop.",
        "Quinn: Hope is your wife. She'll respect that.",
        "Quinn: We have a problem.",
        "Bill: There is no \"we.\" If you have a problem, fix it. Leave me the hell out of it.",
        "Quinn: This is about our son. Our little \"Ivy falling into the seine\" secret? It's not so secret anymore.",
        "Hope: Okay, I think I know what's going on here.",
        "Liam: What's going on is that Quinn is human arsenic. But we don't have to let her poison us anymore. All those memories I spoke of earlier, the first time I saw you, the proposal, the fashion shows, the wedding in Italy, all those moments, they add up to this. They add up to us realizing that we don't have to give up. Hope, I have missed you so damn much.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Liam, I've missed you too. And I do cherish those memories. I don't regret anything, even when things went wrong.",
        "Liam: I know. Neither do I. 'Cause they made us stronger, those road blocks. Every single time, we came out the other side better than we were before, and this will be no different. But we have a chance right now to prove to Quinn that no matter how hard she tries, she can't keep us apart.",
        "Hope: I always thought we were gonna end up together. You know that. Even when things got really tough and when obstacles were thrown at us, there was a part of me that just never gave up.",
        "Liam: I know.",
        "Hope: Until I had to. Liam, our life didn't work out as planned, and that's... that's okay. We still have those memories, and we can look back on them and smile --",
        "Liam: I don't -- [Chuckles] I don't think you understand what it is I'm trying to tell you.",
        "Hope: I think I do. Liam, I can see how hurt you are, and I understand that you're trying desperately to fix what happened, but to blame Quinn...",
        "Liam: I am blaming Quinn because she is actually the one who kept me from you.",
        "Hope: Okay. Well...I'm married to Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Yes, you're married to Wyatt. And why are you married to Wyatt? Because I didn't make it there on time, right?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Because of you. Because you didn't show up. It doesn't have anything to do with Quinn.",
        "Liam: Yes, it does.",
        "Hope: No. Liam, I understand that you're looking for someone to blame. I do. And Quinn is such an easy target, why not blame her? Look at everything that she's done. But...she was in los Angeles. There's no way she pushed Ivy into the seine.",
        "Liam: Hope, look at me. Look into my eyes. I have proof.",
        "Bill: First things first. Have a drink. Relax. No reason to panic.",
        "Quinn: There are plenty of reasons to panic. Everybody knows what I did to Ivy. Wyatt is furious with me, and Liam's probably whining about it to hope as we speak. We've got to do something.",
        "Bill: The truth came out. It happens. I'm glad it did.",
        "Quinn: How can you say that? Think about our son's marriage.",
        "Bill: I am. I don't want hope waffling again. She should be with Wyatt. Honor her vows.",
        "Quinn: Okay. So...",
        "Bill: She should come to that conclusion on her own.",
        "Quinn: Mnh-mnh. No, I didn't want to chance that.",
        "Bill: If they get through this, their marriage might even be stronger.",
        "Quinn: And that is where you come in. You are gonna go to Liam, because he listens to you, and you're gonna convince him that this doesn't change anything.",
        "Liam: Like I said, Quinn pushed Ivy.",
        "Hope: Okay, did Ivy say something? Because if she's, like, suddenly remembering and trying to stir something up, I --",
        "Liam: What? No. No, no, no, no, no. Ivy didn't even see it. One minute she was trying to take a photo, the next she got bumped off the edge.",
        "Hope: Okay, so... what? Did, like, another witness step forward?",
        "Liam: Believe it or not, Pam and Charlie.",
        "Hope: Okay... well, they weren't in paris, either.",
        "Liam: No, they weren't. But they did come to me with hard evidence.",
        "Hope: From Pam? You're believing evidence from Pam? Liam, listen to yourself.",
        "Liam: No, no, no, trust me. Charlie has connections over in paris. Take a look at this.",
        "Hope: What am I looking at?",
        "Liam: This is a scan from customs. Do you see the date?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Quinn was on my flight, hope.",
        "Hope: Seriously?",
        "Liam: Yeah. I mean, it's all there in black and white. That's her name. That's her passport number. She was in paris that same day.",
        "Hope: Well, maybe she had a reason to be there.",
        "Liam: Yeah, a job interview, according to her. But that was a lie.",
        "Hope: She is out of work.",
        "Liam: How many people do you know that go to job interviews wearing disguises? Wait. There's more. Take a look at this. This...hold on. That is security footage from Charles de Gaulle airport. Do you see the woman in black? The one wearing a scarf?",
        "Hope: Yeah. That's Quinn?",
        "Liam: That sure as hell is.",
        "Hope: I guess I see a resemblance.",
        "Liam: It's her. It's Quinn leaving the airport, by stealing somebody's scooter, by the way, and then following my car. She wasn't going on a job interview, hope. She was tracking me to stop me from getting to the Eiffel tower in time.",
        "Hope: Okay. So, a woman who looks like Quinn...",
        "Liam: It's Quinn. There's no doubt about --",
        "Hope: ...Gets on a scooter and leaves. But you -- you don't know where she's going. I mean, you don't have any proof of that.",
        "Liam: Ah! I do. Take a look at this. There it is. Quinn on the bridge pushing Ivy into the river. Boom. She tried to deny it at first, but that didn't last for very long. I got her to confess, hope. She actually admitted it. It was Quinn. Quinn sacrificed Ivy. She put Ivy's life at risk to keep us apart.",
        "Bill: I'm not telling Liam squat. Or Wyatt. I promised them I would stop meddling, and I'm sticking to it. Look, you got busted. Time to pay the piper.",
        "Quinn: I'm not worried about me. I can handle anything that's thrown at me. This is about our son.",
        "Bill: And if you don't want him to pay for your mistakes, stop making them.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You know how much Wyatt means to me. He is my whole world.",
        "Bill: Poor kid.",
        "Quinn: Look. I know you don't like me.",
        "Bill: Right.",
        "Quinn: And I know you don't care if I lose Wyatt over this.",
        "Bill: Not one bit.",
        "Quinn: But you care about Wyatt.",
        "Bill: And Liam.",
        "Quinn: Okay, then show it. Hope makes Liam miserable. You've seen how happy Wyatt's been since he's been back, and hope. And Liam, he's finally moving on. He's been dating that Forrester girl. All these kids, they're finally making progress. I would think you would want to do whatever is necessary to keep them all on the right track. And don't, don't, don't even tell me that you're done meddling, 'cause we both know that's a bunch of bull. Look, this doesn't change anything. All the facts remain the same. Liam chose to dive in after Ivy instead of meeting up with hope. Doesn't matter how Ivy fell. Liam didn't show up, hope and Wyatt are still married, and you need to convince Liam to respect that.",
        "Hope: This is... I c-- I can't even wrap my brain around this right now. It's -- this changed my life. I married her son.",
        "Liam: I would have made it to you. And you and I... [Chuckles] We would be married right now instead. Quinn knew what would happen if I didn't get to you in time. I mean, because you chose me already. You already had. And you must have known. You must have known that I felt the same way, that I was gonna be there.",
        "Hope: I did. I did. I did know. I just...I knew that you were gonna show up. That at 3:00 at the Eiffel tower, I would see you walking towards me and we would embrace and it would be wonderful and romantic. But... you didn't show. You didn't. And instead, the moment that I was hoping for was full of disappointment and embarrassment. But... but Wyatt was there.",
        "Liam: It was all part of Quinn's plan.",
        "Hope: Does he know?",
        "Liam: He does now. He was there when I confronted her.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: But you didn't choose Wyatt, hope. You chose me. You chose me. Quinn chose him for you.",
        "Hope: To go from thinking that you didn't want me because you didn't show up, then finding out that you did want me, you did care, because you were there, that was hard enough. But now, adding this on top of it, knowing now that Quinn engineered everything, it's... [Scoffs]",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Hope: Oh, God. Oh, it's...Wyatt. He wants me to come home.",
        "Liam: Listen. Listen to me. Listen, hope. He's gonna understand. It's gonna hurt like hell. It hurts to lose love. But he knows we were robbed and we finally have a chance to get that back. He...how could he not understand? Come here.",
        "Hope: Okay. Um...I have to go talk to Wyatt and Quinn.",
        "Bill: Liam!",
        "Liam: Hey. I was just about to call you.",
        "Bill: About Quinn?",
        "Liam: So you know.",
        "Bill: Unfortunately I was just with her. She told me all about paris.",
        "Liam: Can you believe that?",
        "Bill: It's Quinn. Of course I believe it. I mean, come on. You know? I'm just irritated that I didn't see her involvement from the beginning. She pushes Ivy into the seine, you don't make it to hope on time, she runs off with Wyatt. What other explanation could there have been?",
        "Liam: I know. I know. I don't quite understand why she would come to you. Oh, she -- oh. She wants you to convince me to respect their marriage.",
        "Bill: Bingo.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] Psycho.",
        "Bill: Certifiable.",
        "Liam: I -- honestly, I want her to stay the hell away from hope and me. I mean, especially now. Especially moving forward, you know?",
        "Bill: Forward? What are you thinking?",
        "Liam: What do you mean? This kind of changes things between hope and me, don't you think?",
        "Bill: You told hope?",
        "Liam: Yeah, she was just here.",
        "Bill: And?",
        "Liam: And she was shocked. Actually, no, that's not true. At first, she didn't even want to believe it. But then when I showed her the proof, yes, she was furious.",
        "Bill: So what's she going to do?",
        "Liam: I mean, she's with Wyatt right now, so I can only assume --",
        "Bill: Liam...",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Bill: She's married.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know she's married. She's married because of a crazy woman. And Quinn doesn't get to get away with that. I'm not letting her come between hope and me ever again.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: Ah, turn right back around.",
        "Quinn: I need to talk to you.",
        "Wyatt: Hope is on her way home, and I don't want you to be here.",
        "Quinn: Well, that's great. I can explain.",
        "Wyatt: Explain? How will you explain this? She'll hate you.",
        "Quinn: Ah, at first, maybe.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, I don't think you understand. What you have done --",
        "Quinn: I gave her the husband she deserves, not some wimpy tofu lover.",
        "Wyatt: If she wanted to be with him, she should have been able to have that chance.",
        "Quinn: She has had chance after chance. How many weddings have they had? They've never been able to make it work. With you, it was simple. Baby, it was easy. She'll see that.",
        "Wyatt: What do you want? Why are you here right now?",
        "Quinn: I went to see your father and I asked him for his support.",
        "Wyatt: What, of you?",
        "Quinn: No, of you. You're marriage. He doesn't want hope and Liam together. He never has. He could...talk Liam down, get through to him, get him to back off.",
        "Wyatt: It doesn't matter.",
        "Quinn: Bill has tremendous influence over Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, if Liam backed off or not, it doesn't matter. Hope is the one who has to decide what she wants to do with this, whether she wants to stay married to me or not.",
        "Quinn: And she will because she loves you.",
        "Wyatt: I hope that's enough.",
        "Quinn: It will be. Baby, you'll see.",
        "Wyatt: Can you just...just give me some time with my wife? I want to talk to her. Give me a chance to talk to her without you throwing your excuses at her. I don't want her walking in here and seeing you.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Quinn: Hope, I know that --",
        "Hope: Don't.",
        "Quinn: I just want to --",
        "Hope: Stop...talking. You claimed that you were getting better, claimed that you wanted to get help. But you are just as sick as you ever were. Pushing Ivy, risking her life.",
        "Quinn: Well, she wasn't really in that much danger.",
        "Hope: You don't know that. You have no idea what could have gone wrong. Not that you cared. All you cared about was keeping Liam away from me. You know, when he told me what you did, I didn't want to believe it. I genuinely thought, \"no, no, no, this woman is trying to get better for Wyatt's sake, for her son.\" But no. We were so wrong to give you a second chance. We were so wrong to think that you could grow a moral bone in your body. This is who you are. This is what you do. This is your pattern. Nothing else matters as long as you are getting what you want. Ridge, Ivy, Liam, all people that you have hurt. And what's worse is Wyatt, your own son whom you claim to be doing all this for, is a victim just as much as the rest of us. It is disgusting. Unforgivable. And I hope to God that Wyatt hates you just as much as I do."
