        "Bridget muses over recent happenings and conversations with Nick. She shocks her father and Stephanie when they want to throw a party for the newest doctor in the Forrester family. She meekly informs them the timing is bad as she is going to Africa for a year to help with AIDS patients. Brooke looks over some models in designer gowns and remarks it is Eric's finest work. Nick ponders on what Bridget said that they must keep this secret forever. Brooke welcomes this second chance at their happiness. Shane begins to tell Taylor that he knows her secret; he was there that night. Hector interrupts before he can say more. But he is concerned that this young man is involving himself in Taylor's private life and how he knows Hector. Shane explains it away that he read about him in the newspaper. Later he berates himself for being so close, yet so far away from telling Taylor. Phoebe catches him talking to himself and inserts herself into his space, even taking the hedge clippers and messing round with them and in a scuffle manages to cut Shane's hand very badly. Taylor suggests to Hector that maybe he should stay there with her after all so Shane wouldn't know that she was alone. Hector does think there is something weird about Shane and vows to find out what it is.",
        "Brooke and Nick enjoy Chuck's takeout of buffalo wings and beer in the office. Stephanie enters and they trade wisecracks and then she asks what is going on with Bridget? They know nothing so she has to inform them about her going to Africa. Brooke doesn't make much out of it, but tells Stephanie that Bridget recently confessed to her that a part of her was still hoping Nick would come back to her. Now maybe she realized that wasn't possible and going to Africa was a way of coping with that. Stephanie tells her no offense to Nick, but Brooke is still in love with Ridge and Bridget still in love with Nick. So Brooke should enjoy the illusion while she can and then hope that Ridge will take her back. Brooke tells Nick not to feel badly; they have a marriage full of love, understanding and honesty. And as long as they have that, it will last forever. A frantic Phoebe takes Shane to the hospital emergency room where Bridget oversees the procedure."

        "Shane: You didn't know I was there, but I saw what happened. Mrs. Forrester, your secret -- I know what it is.",

        "[Bridget remembering]",
        "Bridget: You know how much I love you. And I always, always will.",
        "Nick: Your mother and I talked. She asked me to give the marriage another chance.",

        "Eric: Paging Dr. Forrester -- Dr. Bridget Forrester.",
        "Bridget: Hey, Dad! Hey, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Hi!",
        "Bridget: What are you guys doing here?",
        "Stephanie: Well, we wondered if you had any plans for Friday night.",
        "Bridget: Why? What's going on Friday night?",
        "Eric: A long, overdue celebration for the newest doctor in the Forrester family.",
        "Bridget: Oh --",
        "Eric: I'm so proud of you, honey.",
        "Stephanie: Your father is very, very proud of you, believe me.",
        "Bridget: I appreciate that, a lot. I would love to, but timing -- the timing's a little off.",
        "Eric: It doesn't have to be Friday night, it can be any time your schedule permits. You just name the day.",
        "Bridget: Well, the thing is, Dad, I'm -- there's this position in Africa that I was thinking about --",
        "Stephanie: Africa? Africa?",
        "Eric: What are you talking about?",
        "Bridget: The aids clinic in Botswana, a position became available and I can leave in a couple of days all I need to do is get my immunizations --",
        "Eric: Hang on. Hang on, young lady. This is the first I've heard about this. I had no idea you were considering such a big step.",
        "Bridget: Dad, it's just --",
        "Stephanie: Has this got something to do with your mother?",
        "Bridget: No.",
        "Stephanie: Has she done something?",
        "Bridget: No.",
        "Stephanie: What has she done?",
        "Bridget: Stephanie, it's not about my mother. She hasn't done anything. It's just -- it's me. It's what I have done. It's -- look, Dad, I understand why this seems so unexpected to you. I get it. It's just that I really have put a lot of thought into it. You know, and there's no reason for me to stay in LA. There's no ties here except for you and -- you and mom. I mean, it really is just the perfect time for me to do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Eric's really outdone himself this time. These latest designs -- some of his best work ever.",
        "[Nick remembering]",
        "Bridget: If you tell her that we slept together, we all lose. This is a secret that we need to keep forever.",
        "Brooke: Hey! Hi, sweetheart. Perfect timing. We were just wrapping up. Thank you, ladies. Okay, handsome, I'm all yours. Not that there would be any doubt after what happened last night, right? Are you okay? [Nick sighs] I can't apologize enough for everything I put you through. For you to forgive me and give our marriage one more chance -- I don't deserve you or your devotion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: You look confused, like you don't even know what I'm talking about.",
        "Taylor: Um -- so, you were there and obviously you saw us?",
        "Shane: Yeah. Yeah. I was in the bushes and then I ran into your daughter, so I stuck around. I saw everything.",
        "[Shane remembering]",
        "Phoebe: Darla!",
        "Shane: And you thought that no one would find out.",
        "Taylor: Okay, this is my home, and I would think that what happens here is very private, but obviously it's not. I mean, I knew when people found out about Thorne and me that they would try to make something out of it.",
        "Shane: Wait, wait, wait, what?",
        "Taylor: Look, I know it's only been a short while since his wife died and it is a little bit soon for us to be getting so close --",
        "Shane: No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. That's not --",
        "Taylor: Look, listen, listen. People are people, okay? And they're going to make of it what they want to --",
        "Shane: That's not what I'm talking about here.",
        "Taylor: They're gonna think what they want to think but listen. Listen, I've got to tell you this part. It's really not a good idea for you to be commenting on the personal lives of the people you work for. It's really not the best idea. Here. Hector? Hold on. Hector, I'm right here. I'm right here.",
        "Hector: Taylor, are you okay? I heard voices.",
        "Shane: Mr. Ramirez.",
        "Hector: I'm sorry. I don't recognize the voice.",
        "Taylor: You know Hector?",
        "Shane: Yeah, I know Hector. He's the fireman. He's the one that pulled -- wait a second. He lives here, too, with you, right?",
        "Hector: Taylor, who is this man?",
        "Taylor: This is Shane. Phoebe just was telling me he's new on our landscaping crew. And he was just telling me that there were some issues of privacy in the back, because he had seen Thorne and me kissing. And he just wanted to warn me that there are eyes everywhere, watching.",
        "Shane: Look, I know how this sounds and -- I just wanted you to know that -- listen, I think I should probably be going here.",
        "Hector: Wait. Don't go. We need to find out why you're involving yourself in Taylor's private life and where you know me from.",
        "Taylor: I really think you're overreacting, Hector.",
        "Hector: No, I would just like some answers.",
        "Taylor: Well, I guess that Shane's maybe a little bit thrown by your condition.",
        "Shane: Yeah, she's right. Mrs. Forrester's right. Actually, I read about you in \"the times\" about a fire at your place and how you lost your vision.",
        "Hector: Oh, and that's how you know me? From the newspaper?",
        "Shane: Yeah, man, they ran your picture before the accident.",
        "Hector: That still doesn't explain why you feel compelled to get involved with her personal life. Phoebe told me that you had some proposal for her mother. What kind of proposal?",
        "Taylor: Hector, it was a privacy issue. See, Shane saw that I was kissing Thorne and he was worried about that. And I had said that I wanted the hedges trimmed down a little and he thought they should be taller, so --",
        "Shane: Right --",
        "Taylor: That was a good idea.",
        "Shane: Yeah, you're right. You're right. Maybe if I just cut them down in the middle, they'll grow taller.",
        "Taylor: Thank you. That was a good idea.",
        "Shane: You're welcome. Listen, I'm gonna just leave you two alone, okay? Bye- bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: What was that all about?",
        "Taylor: He's just trying to help.",
        "Hector: Or something else entirely different -- whatever that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: What do you say to a little lunch? A little take-in, take-out, whatever.",
        "Brooke: Take-in, take-out? I'm a little surprised, actually, because you usually don't like hanging out here at Forrester.",
        "Nick: Well, he's not here. I don't mind it around here when he's not here.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, he's probably showing my sister the time of her life.",
        "Nick: Have you heard from them?",
        "Brooke: Just that they were in Paris. I don't know where they're going from there.",
        "Nick: Do you find yourself at all curious?",
        "Brooke: No, not really. I have more important things to focus on now.",
        "Nick: Like what?",
        "Brooke: Like you. Like our marriage. Our future. And something else.",
        "Nick: What else?",
        "Brooke: You know.",
        "Nick: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: No reason to stay here? What about us? We're your family. We're your friends. People who love --",
        "Bridget: Stephanie, I'm gonna be gone a year. It's not like it's forever.",
        "Eric: Honey, a year is a very, very long time. Think of everything your gonna miss.",
        "Bridget: Dad, I really want to do this.",
        "Eric: Because --",
        "Bridget: Because? Because the need is so great. Botswana has the highest infection rate of aids patients in the world. Knowing that, can you think of a better way for me to spend my time?",
        "Eric: No, of course not. So, because the need is so great, you've decided all of a sudden to spend a year in Africa?",
        "Stephanie: What does your mother say about this?",
        "Bridget: She doesn't know, but --",
        "Stephanie: You haven't told your mother you're going to Africa for a year in less than a week?",
        "Bridget: I was gonna go by right after work today, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Bridget, I know you. You're running away from something.",
        "Bridget: I'm not running away from anything. [Pager buzzes] Yes, Dr. Forrester. Got it right here. Be right there.",
        "Stephanie: You haven't answered my question.",
        "Bridget: Oh, Stephanie! God, there's a whole huge world out there. Like I said, I really want to do some good. I will see you both later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Stupid! Stupid, stupid! How come all I ever do is screw up? I was so close. I almost had it. I was so close. I was right there.",
        "Phoebe: Shane, what's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: No, something was off with that guy. I could hear it in his voice.",
        "Taylor: It's because you were grilling him.",
        "Hector: Don't you think he was being presumptuous? I mean, bringing up that kiss?",
        "Taylor: No, he was trying to protect my privacy.",
        "Hector: Or maybe he was working another angle. Think about it, Taylor. I mean, here's a guy you don't even know you hire to do your gardening. Takes it upon himself to get involved in your personal life. I just don't want to see you taken advantage of.",
        "Taylor: Okay, Hector, I really don't believe that's what it is. But if you do think that something more maybe going on, then maybe you should stay. Maybe you should stay here and let him know I'm not alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Why'd you do that to me?",
        "Phoebe: What?",
        "Shane: Why'd you walk up on me like that? You were trying to spy on me.",
        "Phoebe: I wasn't spying on you --",
        "Shane: Yes, you were.",
        "Phoebe: I was over there and I heard you. What's wrong with you?",
        "Shane: Yes, you were. There's nothing wrong with me. Does it look like something's wrong with me?",
        "Phoebe: What's with this mood you're in? I mean, did it not go well with my mom or something?",
        "Shane: No, it didn't go well with your mom. You know, if your mom's friend, Smokey the bear, just stayed out, it would have been better.",
        "Phoebe: Oh, you mean Hector?",
        "Shane: Yeah, hector. What's he doing living at your mom's house, anyway?",
        "Phoebe: Well, his house burned down not to long ago and she just --",
        "Shane: Oh, so what, is she gonna play a good Samaritan? Is that what she's doing?",
        "Phoebe: Well, I mean, they're friends and he needed her help. What's the big deal, anyway?",
        "Shane: What's the big deal?",
        "Phoebe: Yes.",
        "Shane: What's the big deal? Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what, I -- let's just forget this.",
        "Phoebe: Come on.",
        "Shane: No, let's forget it. I need to get back to trimming these hedges anyway.",
        "Phoebe: The hedges aren't going anywhere. How do you work these things, anyway?",
        "Shane: Phoebe, what are you doing? Don't, don't -- please give that back to me.",
        "Phoebe: Oh, chill out. I'm not a pro, but I could make some pretty cool --",
        "Shane: Don't do that. Listen, give me those back. I don't want you to do that. Are you crazy? If your mom comes out and she sees you doing that -- don't do that.",
        "Phoebe: She'll be fine. Look. Look, look. It's fine.",
        "Shane: Please give me that back. No, stop! Stop it! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Isn't this sauce great?",
        "Brooke: Mm. I like this sauce right here.",
        "Nick: You can use it with the carrot or you can use it with the wing.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Stephanie: Oh, a romantic lunch of chicken wings and beer. Who knew chuck's delivered?",
        "Brooke: We should've locked the door.",
        "Nick: Sorry, Stephanie, lunch is over.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, thank you. No, thank you. What's going on with Bridget?",
        "Brooke: Bridget?",
        "Stephanie: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: What are you talking about?",
        "Stephanie: Bridget is leaving for Africa for a year to work with aids patients. I find that rather intriguing. Knowing Bridget as I do, it seems to me a little strange that she would just uproot herself and not tell anybody about it until the last moment. What's going on, Brooke? Am I asking the wrong person?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Okay, okay, okay, put this around your hand.",
        "Shane: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "Phoebe: We have to get to the hospital, come on. I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hector: I can't be around here if you're with Thorne.",
        "Taylor: Hector, you have to stop talking to me about Thorne, all right? We're not flaunting our relationship or anything. I mean, we're keeping things quiet as possible.",
        "Hector: Tell that to your new landscaper. But why it's any of his business --",
        "Taylor: He seems really harmless, okay, Hector?",
        "Hector: There's something weird about him, okay? And I'm going to find out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Sirens]",
        "Phoebe: Somebody help us. We need help.",
        "Shane: Somebody please help!",
        "Nurse #1: What happened? What happened?",
        "Phoebe: Please -- we were in the backyard and it was an accident. I just -- I accidentally cut him.",
        "Nurse #1: Get him into cubicle two, stat!",
        "Shane: I'm going to have to lie down. I'm a little dizzy.",
        "Bridget: Phoebe?",
        "Phoebe: Bridget! Bridget, thank God.",
        "Bridget: Honey, what's wrong?",
        "Phoebe: You need to help him. You have to help him.",
        "Bridget: What's going on?",
        "Phoebe: Shane -- I accidentally -- I cut him. And it's my fault. I accidentally hurt him.",
        "Bridget: Honey, calm down. Calm down.",
        "Phoebe: He's --",
        "Doctor: Let's elevate this hand. Let's keep pressure on it.",
        "Shane: Ow, ow! I'm not feeling good, doc.",
        "Doctor: Start an IV TKO. Administer one gram of anseph and notify radiology and the OR.",
        "Shane: Tell me if I'm gonna be all right. I need to use this hand.",
        "Doctor: You'll be all right. We're doing everything we can. Let the OR know we're on our way up.",
        "Shane: Ow.",
        "Bridget: Doctor, how's he doing?",
        "Doctor: Dr. Forrester, you know the patient?",
        "Bridget: No, but he knows my niece right here.",
        "Doctor: Okay. Well, the patient has a severe laceration --",
        "Phoebe: Shane, I'm so sorry.",
        "Shane: Doc, please --",
        "Phoebe: I know you'll never forgive me. I'll never forgive myself. I just --",
        "Shane: I'm not feeling good, doc.",
        "Phoebe: I'm really soy. I'm sorry.",
        "Shane: Doc --",
        "Bridget: Look, I don't know where your warped mind is going with all of this but \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Brooke, just tell her the truth. She's gonna find out anyway.",
        "Stephanie: What is it?",
        "Brooke: Bridget confessed to me that a part of her was still hoping nick would come back to her. Maybe now she realizes that's not possible, because Nick and I just recommitted ourselves to each other. So maybe going to Africa is a way of coping with that.",
        "Stephanie: And this doesn't upset you?",
        "Brooke: Yes, it upsets me to think that my daughter feels she needs to put distance between us, to know that I won't be seeing her for months. But maybe this is a way for her to deal with it.",
        "Stephanie: This is such bull. You're in love with Ridge, and she's still in love with him.",
        "Brooke: Oh, God, Stephanie. I made my commitment to Nick. I said my vows, and I plan on keeping them.",
        "Stephanie: Just the way you keep all your vows.",
        "Nick: You know the way to the door, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: No offense, nick, but the simple reality is --",
        "Brooke: The reality is that with Ridge, there was always another woman involved -- Caroline, Taylor. And with Nick, I know that he would never cheat on me. There's no secrets in our marriage. I am done with that. I finally have a man who has some integrity and some honor.",
        "Stephanie: Who will never disappoint you.",
        "Brooke: Right.",
        "Stephanie: Well, enjoy the illusion while it lasts, because it's going to come to an end. And when it does, hopefully Ridge will take you back.",
        "Brooke: It's time for you to leave, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: I'm on my way.",
        "Nick: I cannot live like this. No secrets in this marriage. No secrets in this marriage.",
        "Bridget: If you care about me at all, you will never say a word. Not one. Not ever.",
        "Brooke: Don't let her get to you. I can see that she has. You know, she just doesn't understand. Because she doesn't have what we have -- she never did. A relationship that's full of love and understanding and honesty. And as long as we have that, our marriage will last forever."
