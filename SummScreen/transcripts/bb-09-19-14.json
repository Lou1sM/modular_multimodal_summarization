She just hates they were manipulated. He says he is not a Boy Scout like his brother, but he asks her not to let this affect their marriage. He and his mother are two different people. He can not control her. He needs to know that leap of faith they took still means everything to her. She doesn't have to let all of this affect them. They were ready to get a bigger house and start a family and they still can. She says there is something she needs to go do. Quinn flops down on Liam's couch and clearly has no intention of leaving. She says Wyatt saved his life and this is how he is repaying him by interfering in his marriage ..and then boo-hooing to all who would hear how they were robbed. But it will make no difference. Hope finally got the husband she always wanted .not one who issues ultimatums. Liam gives her kittens and Wyatt gave her a diamond the size of Texas. He tells her it is not cute or endearing.

Pam and Charlie corner Deacon and Brooke in the office and ask Donna to come in. They say they are about to blow Wyatt out of the water. Brooke wants to know what this has to do with Hope and her marriage. Pam says Hope never had a chance with a marriage with Liam because Quinn was in Paris pulling all her strings. They show everyone the video they have which proves that Quinn orchestrated it all. Pam sings Charlie's praises for knowing the right people in the right places to get this evidence. Brooke tells Deacon that Hope is probably making her decision now of what she will do but this time it will be all her and not Quinn who decides it. Brooke tells him that she likes both Liam and Wyatt and she knows Hope is the only one for Wyatt, but one of them is going to lose.",
        "Quinn comes back to Wyatt's and says she knows that she is the last person he wants to see, but she'd like to try and fix this. He says she has done enough damage and he might not be Hope's husband when this is all over. There might not be anything she can do at this point. Hope is not here. She probably is at Liam's. She says maybe Hope just went for a drive to clear her head. Wyatt rants at her to stop this pretending it did not happen. Do not ever do anything for him again. He could lose Hope, the only women he's ever loved. He is not giving up but don't forget for a minute that this will affect all of them. Quinn says she should have thrown Liam in the river instead of Ivy. All those plans of Wyatt's are not going to be destroyed because of Liam. Hope does show up at Liam's. They look at each other for a minute then he reaches out and hugs her. He says he is glad she came back. He tells her Quinn was here puffing her chest like nothing has changed at all. He needs to know what happened with Wyatt. She says he wants her to look past all that happened because of Quinn. She tells Liam that he is the love of her life and she will never forget their times together. She loves him. She gives him a kiss and a big hug then pulls away. Liam asks what is going on. Tell him what is wrong. She has tears in her eyes and can not speak."

        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I've made excuses for her all my life, and then I met you, and I fell in love, and all of my mother's craziness just couldn't touch me... or so I thought. Look, I hate how she has invaded our marriage and our lives this way. But, hope, we can't let that come between us. We can't lose us because of what my mother did in paris.",
        "Liam: Get out.",
        "Quinn: Why? So you could rush to hope and capitalize on the situation?",
        "Liam: You know something? Delusional as you are, you can't possibly think that hope is gonna stay married to your son at this point.",
        "Quinn: Marriage is sacred to hope. No way she's gonna hold Wyatt responsible for something his well-intentioned, yet slightly quixotic mother did.",
        "Liam: \"Quixotic\"? Quix-- [Chuckles] Oh, I should have had you thrown behind bars when you tried to plunge that sword into my chest.",
        "Quinn: As I recall, you pledged your undying gratitude to your brother on this very spot for saving your life. This is how you repay him -- by interfering in his marriage?",
        "Liam: Quinn, the only one interfering in Wyatt's marriage is you, and you're about to cost him the woman he loves.",
        "Quinn: No, I'm not. And I'll tell you why.",
        "Deacon: What's going on? Why did Pam want to see both of us?",
        "Brooke: She didn't say. Just that it had to do with hope.",
        "Pam: Gangway! Incoming torpedoes.",
        "Donna: Apparently, Pam and Charlie are about to blow someone out of the water.",
        "Charlie: Uh, no \"apparently\" about it. We already have.",
        "Pam: It's all right here.",
        "Brooke: What is?",
        "Charlie: Quinn fuller, ice queen, at it again -- scheming, conniving.",
        "Pam: Only this time, it backfired. Or it's about to.",
        "Brooke: Backfired how? And what does this have to do with hope?",
        "Deacon: And her marriage to Wyatt? Charlie, what --",
        "Charlie: Hang on. Hang on. We will fill in all the blanks.",
        "Brooke: Is this about hope's marriage to Wyatt?",
        "Charlie: Bingo.",
        "Pam: Yes, and how it really happened.",
        "Donna: Well, it happened because Liam didn't meet hope at the Eiffel tower in time.",
        "Pam: Because he was busy rescuing Ivy from the seine after a certain someone pushed her in.",
        "Charlie: Knowing that Liam would jump in after her and effect rescue.",
        "Brooke: Wait. You said Ivy was pushed?",
        "Pam: Yes. Hope never had the chance to choose a life with Liam because Quinn was in paris that day, pulling all the strings.",
        "Charlie: And we have proof.",
        "Liam: I'm done listening to you.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckling] Fine, but don't be surprised if hope doesn't do what you think she's going to.",
        "Liam: Hope is not gonna stay in a marriage that happened the way hers did to Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: Hope didn't have to marry Wyatt on that day. She could have said she needed more time, but she didn't because --",
        "Liam: Because you played God. Because you decided whom she should be with, and you made it happen.",
        "Quinn: I'm a go-getter, while you sit passively by and boohoo because you didn't get the girl.",
        "Liam: [Inhales deeply] Wyatt's not getting the girl.",
        "Quinn: He already did. He's hope's husband. And right now, he is with her, helping her realize... that she can't punish him for something I did.",
        "Wyatt: If I had any idea the lengths that she would go...",
        "Hope: She was supposed to get professional help, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I know, and I promise you -- I will make sure that she does it.",
        "Hope: You heard her yourself. She's not sorry. She's not remorseful. She would do it all over again in a heartbeat if it meant that you and I would be together.",
        "Wyatt: Are you sorry that we're together?",
        "Hope: I-I just hate that we were manipulated.",
        "Wyatt: Me, too, okay? But you do know that my mother and I are different people, right?",
        "Hope: Yes, of course I do.",
        "Wyatt: It's not like I'm a boy scout or anything like my brother. Occasionally, I step up to the line to get things done, but... what my mother -- what my mother did -- just -- I know it's hard not to, but please don't let it affect our marriage, hope, okay? Say you won't let it.",
        "Charlie: So, brace yourselves. It's all there.",
        "Pam: And there is no way that mommy dearest can fast-talk her way out of this.",
        "Charlie: We've got her so cold from the time she arrived incognito at the paris airport...",
        "Pam: To stealing somebody's scooter.",
        "Charlie: ...To arriving at the bridge...",
        "Pam: Where the poor, unsuspecting Ivy was pushed into the seine.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God.",
        "Charlie: ...Making Liam jump in after her, making him miss the meeting with hope at the appointed time.",
        "Deacon: Quinn orchestrated this entire thing from the moment she got on the plane, Brooke.",
        "Charlie: And this document proves that she went to paris and back on the same day all this happened.",
        "Pam: It's just lucky for us that Charlie's got contacts in all the right places.",
        "Donna: Otherwise, Quinn would have gotten away with this.",
        "Deacon: Who else knows about this?",
        "Brooke: Does hope?",
        "Charlie: We, uh -- we told Liam first.",
        "Pam: I mean, we thought it'd be better if he told her.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God. I can only imagine his reaction.",
        "Liam: Nobody's that persuasive, Quinn -- not even your son.",
        "Quinn: He doesn't have to be. Wyatt didn't do anything wrong, and once hope realizes that --",
        "Liam: What hope realizes, Quinn, is that her husband's evil mother robbed her of a chance to choose whom she wanted to spend the rest of her life with.",
        "Quinn: Come on. Like it was much of a choice. A boy who brings her stray kittens or a man who brings her a diamond the size of Texas. Lucky for her, she met up with Wyatt in the woods that day, and it was love at first sight.",
        "Liam: Maybe for Wyatt. Not for hope.",
        "Quinn: My point is, from the moment they met, Wyatt has treated hope the way she deserves to be treated. No wonder she didn't even think when he whisked her away on that yacht, and they exchanged vows. I mean, she finally got the husband she always wanted -- one that was strong and decisive -- not a boy who issues ultimatums or pits one girl against another, like you did with hope and Steffy. And before you say it, yes, yes, I am -- I am 100% aware that I am a big liability in their marriage right now. But I believe in their love for one another, and I think that they're going to overcome this, and it's gonna make them stronger.",
        "Liam: It's gonna make them stronger? It's gonna make their marriage stronger? A marriage that wouldn't have even happened unless you risked Ivy's life by pushing her into the seine and almost drowning her in order to keep me from getting to hope? Listen, this is what it keeps coming back to, okay? Your neurotic obsession with your grown son and his love life. It's not cute, Quinn. It's not funny. It's not endearing. You deserve to be locked up in a padded room, and if I have anything to say about it, you will be.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I-I hate what this is doing to you. I mean, we're newlyweds. We're just weeks back from our honeymoon, and then here we are, dealing with our first test as husband and wife. You know, that -- that leap of faith that we took together, hope... I need to know if you're gonna hold this against me -- something that I didn't even do, something that my mother did, something that if I had the slightest idea she was gonna do, I would put an immediate stop to it.",
        "Hope: I know.",
        "Wyatt: Even if that meant that you would choose Liam and marry him instead of me.",
        "Hope: I know you would have. It's... [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Hope, we have so much going for us. We have so many plans. We're possibly going into a bigger house and, uh, talking about starting a family. This doesn't have to change any of that -- not if we don't let it... if you don't let it.",
        "Wyatt: What do you -- what do you want to do?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] There are some things that I-I have to go do, okay?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Deacon: Hey, honey, it's your dad. Uh, just checking to make sure everything's okay. Uh, do me a favor. Give me a call. Let me know everything's all right. I love you.",
        "Brooke: Hope's voicemail?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I didn't want to say too much in case, uh, Liam hadn't told her yet. Where were you?",
        "Brooke: Oh, I was downstairs talking to Jarrett. Apparently, hope planned this exclusive interview with him for the upcoming fashion show, and I had to tell him that something urgent happened.",
        "Deacon: Urgent? Brooke, our daughter's life has been completely turned upside down again.",
        "Brooke: I know, but thankfully, not because of bill this time.",
        "Deacon: Are you sure he's not in cahoots with Quinn? What? What? It wouldn't be the first time. You remember that little selfie with bill and Quinn in bed? Ugh!",
        "Brooke: Quinn manipulated him the same way she's manipulating hope and Liam right now. I wish she would just stay out of it.",
        "Deacon: And then she'd, uh -- she'd be back with Liam instead of Wyatt.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] She does love Wyatt. It's just that he is ready to have children, and she's not -- not that that even matters at this point.",
        "Deacon: Why? 'Cause she might end the marriage and, uh, go back to Liam?",
        "Brooke: Wyatt has made her happy, and he really does love her, and she's the only woman for him.",
        "Deacon: You feel for him.",
        "Brooke: I feel for both of them. I like both of them. I know one of them is going to lose.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt.",
        "Brooke: All because of his mother.",
        "Quinn: I realize I'm the last person you want to see right now. [Sighs] I-I hate how we left things. Hope was so upset. Tell me how I can fix it.",
        "Wyatt: You stay out of it. You've done enough damage already.",
        "Quinn: Sweetheart, this doesn't have to be the end of the world. I mean, you're still hope's husband.",
        "Wyatt: I may not be hope's husband much longer, thanks to you.",
        "Quinn: Where is she?",
        "Wyatt: She left awhile ago... probably to go see Liam.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: Poor Liam and hope.4n(r4n(r%!4pk\"\u00faj;k<",
        "Donna: [Sighs] Poor Liam and hope. I mean, talk about a tortured romance.",
        "Pam: Thanks to the likes of three-dollar bill and now the ice queen.",
        "Donna: Ugh.",
        "Pam: I'm just so proud that Charlie cracked this case, so at least they now know the truth.",
        "Donna: Yeah. You know, I always knew that Quinn was kind of kooky, but to deliberately risk Ivy's life to keep hope apart from Liam -- it's crazy.",
        "Pam: I know.",
        "Charlie: Uh, what do you suppose hope's gonna do? I mean, now that she knows.",
        "Donna: I'm more interested in knowing what Brooke and deacon are gonna do, now that they know.",
        "Deacon: Hey. Don't worry. She's strong like her mother, whether she decides to stay with Wyatt or go back to Liam.",
        "Brooke: It'll be hope's choice this time -- not Quinn's.",
        "Quinn: You can't be certain that hope is with Liam right now. Maybe -- maybe she took a drive to clear her head.",
        "Wyatt: Stop it, mom.",
        "Quinn: Stop what?",
        "Wyatt: Pretending like this is nothing -- that everything's gonna go back to normal in a day or two.",
        "Quinn: Maybe it will.",
        "Wyatt: Are you serious? Even now, do you not get what you did? You went nuts. You committed a crime again.",
        "Quinn: I-I pushed poison Ivy in a little bit of water.",
        "Wyatt: She could have drowned, mom.",
        "Quinn: She didn't!",
        "Wyatt: That's not the point.",
        "Quinn: No, the point is, your spineless brother was about to ruin hope's life again, and I couldn't let that happen -- not if it meant you losing hope. Baby, I-I did this for you.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, okay. Okay, well, then do me a favor. Don't ever do anything for me again, okay?",
        "Quinn: Come on. You don't mean that.",
        "Wyatt: I could lose her, mom. Hope could be over there with Liam right now, saying that she's coming back to him. I could lose the only woman that I ever loved.",
        "Quinn: Baby, you cannot give up.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not giving up, but don't think that this isn't going to affect hope and me or that Liam's not gonna take advantage of this situation.",
        "Quinn: Ohh, he's such a spineless little goody-two-shoes. I should have thrown him in the river. I -- listen, hope loves you, okay? All those plans that you were making together -- the future and children -- she wants those things just as much as you do. She's not gonna -- she's not gonna ruin that to have another chance with Liam. You and hope share a bond that Liam Spencer cannot destroy.",
        "Liam: I'm glad you came back. [Sighs] So, um...you spoke to Wyatt?",
        "Hope: And Quinn, yeah.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] I hope you blasted her. I just did.",
        "Hope: She was here?",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] Yeah, just puffing her chest, you know, acting like nothing's changed at all. Um -- uh, come on in. Come on in.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Liam: So, what happened with Wyatt?",
        "Hope: Um -- uh, he wants me to look past everything that his mom has done.",
        "Liam: How could you possibly do that? You would be married to me right now if it weren't for what she did.",
        "Hope: I know.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: And, Liam, I want you to know... you are the love of my life. When I think about everything we've -- we've done, everything we've been through...I will never forget our times together. I love you.",
        "Liam: Hey. Listen, we knew this day would come, and now it's good. Now we finally have the life we wanted, okay? Are -- are you okay? What's going on? What's going on?",
        "Hope: I'm...",
        "Liam: You -- what? You're what?"
