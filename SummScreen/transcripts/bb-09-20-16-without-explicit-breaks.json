    "Recap": [
        "Brooke discusses with Bill that RJ is older than his years, always has been. Bill says they need to do this; RJ will eventually come around. Kids adjust; they always do. She says she loves Bill and wants to marry him but first and foremost she is a mother and she needs to be sure that RJ is okay with this and she hopes Bill will understand. RJ does not know Bill so he needs to do that first. So they will be good and just wait a little longer. Bill says he feels like he has been waiting for her all his life. She says that she wants a life with Bill but she wants RJ to be a part of that too. Bill remarks that he will wait a little while. RJ tells the group that he cannot see any reason why Ridge would want Brooke to marry Bill. Eric tells Quinn that this is their time. He doesn't care what Steffy and the others want; they need to go make this official. She says they are in the minority so they better get their feet back on the ground. He would give up his family to have a lifetime romp in the hay with her. He says this will eventually resolve itself so they have a wedding to plan. Steffy is worried. They need those shares from Bill and it looks like Ridge might be wavering now. Eric convinces Quinn that despite their feelings his children will be there. It will be the last marriage in his life. She starts making the invitations on the computer. Again she says she is sorry that she brought turmoil into his life. But this is real and she would never do anything to hurt him. She tries to convince Eric to talk to his kids again and say the nice things that he says to her. He promises her that as long as he is breathing and smiling that they will see that when they come to this wedding and it will all be resolved.",
        "RJ asks Ridge if he is going to send him back to boarding school. Ridge replies no. RJ says he and Brooke are meant for each other and he does not see how Ridge is going to let her marry Bill. Brooke comes in and hugs RJ and says she is not going to marry Bill. RJ goes on and on about now both his mom and dad are free to be together. She tells him no, she put off the wedding but it will be sooner rather than later. Ridge says he can stay at home now and they will all be closer. Brooke agrees that they will all be united and that means the world to her. RJ sees Steffy and Thomas and cannot believe they do not see this train wreck like he does. He says Brooke has not broken the wedding off altogether but has put it off for the moment. Steffy assures him that she cannot give him the details but the future of the company depends on this wedding and Ridge and Brooke all know about it. Ridge tells Brooke that she is a good mother so he is glad she is giving RJ a chance to understand and be okay with it. Ridge tells her no hurry on the wedding, just let them wait and see. At that moment he gets an invitation from Quinn and Eric. They are both stunned that Eric is going to marry that woman."

        "Bill: I-I understand that you're torn. But R.J.'s a teenager. Teenagers have issues with their parents. They always have, and they always will.",
        "Brooke: And you, of course, are an expert on teenagers.",
        "Bill: I'm an expert on everything. You should know that by now.",
        "Brooke: R.J.'s not your normal teenager.",
        "Bill: Ah, spoken like a true mother.",
        "Brooke: He's older than his years. He always has been.",
        "Bill: Okay. Then give him a gold star and stick it on his forehead. But don't let him run your life. We're supposed to leave today -- start our adventure, get married. I mean, the plane is waiting on the tarmac. I understand that you want to wait. Brooke, R.J. will adapt, especially when he sees how happy you are. Come on. Let's do this.",
        "R.J.: What do you mean, Brooke's promise? Wait. Where is all this negativity coming from?",
        "Ridge: No one's being negative, R.J.",
        "R.J.: Well, that's what it sounds like to me.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Like dad said --",
        "R.J.: Yeah, yeah. I know. It's complicated, all right? The point is I stopped mom from marrying that guy. Or I hope I did. But that's still a good thing.",
        "Thomas: Brooke didn't say she was canceling the wedding, though, right?",
        "R.J.: No. She didn't come out and say it, but that's what I'm hoping for. And you should be, too, Dad. I can't see any reason you would want Mom to marry that guy.",
        "Quinn: Wait. You're serious? You want to get married right away?",
        "Eric: What's stopping us?",
        "Quinn: I can think of a couple sons, your grandchildren.",
        "Eric: You know what? If we let them stop us, it's our own damn fault. This is our time, Quinn. This is our time. Ridge and Steffy and Pam and all the rest of them -- they can complain all they want, but what I want is you. Come on. Let's make this official.",
        "Quinn: Wait. No, wait. Let's -- let's just get our feet back on the ground, okay?",
        "Eric: No. Why? I like it up here. I like it up here.",
        "Quinn: I do, too, but we are in the minority.",
        "Eric: And the majority being?",
        "Quinn: Do you want me to make you a list? Your entire family and my entire family, which is just one person.",
        "Eric: That's their problem, not ours.",
        "Quinn: Okay. So, you're saying when it comes down to it, you're gonna write off your entire family to have a lifelong romp in the hay with me?",
        "Eric: It seems like a fair trade to me.",
        "Quinn: Oh, Eric. You're joking. Of course. Honey, I want to have a life with you, but it has to include your family, because that is who you are.",
        "Eric: My family will come around. They'll come around when they see how much you mean to me. Now let's stop worrying about something that's gonna resolve itself, because we have a wedding to plan! Come on!",
        "Steffy: R.J., you just got back into town. We can't expect you to understand.",
        "R.J.: Understand what? Dad, if I didn't get through to mom, you have to.",
        "Ridge: Son... I don't want her marrying that guy any more than you do.",
        "R.J.: Then do something about it.",
        "Ridge: It's not that simple.",
        "R.J.: Nothing ever is around here. But I don't care about the other stuff going on, okay? I'm concerned for mom. She shouldn't be marrying a guy like Bill Spencer.",
        "Bill: We'll be all over R.J. -- when we get back. Brooke, come on. He'll adjust. Kids always do.",
        "Brooke: He's had to adjust to so much in his life.",
        "Bill: And look at him! I mean, he's strong and he's resilient. I really admired the way he stood up to me.",
        "Brooke: I love you, Bill. I do. And I want to marry you sooner rather than later. But first and foremost, I am a mother, and my son is confused right now. I need to be there for him. I can't just run off. Please tell me you understand.",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: So, you get it, right? We just wait a little bit.",
        "Bill: I feel like I've been waiting for you all my life.",
        "Brooke: Well, then, a little bit longer shouldn't matter.",
        "Bill: A little can turn in to a lot pretty quickly.",
        "Brooke: No, it won't -- not this time.",
        "Bill: Your son really doesn't like me, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: He doesn't know you.",
        "Bill: Well, I don't know what, uh, he's heard from his father.",
        "Brooke: He's an independent thinker. We brought him up that way.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, he's, uh -- you know, he's quite a kid. The way he came at me -- he definitely has some... bulldog in him.",
        "Brooke: Someday you'll brag that he takes after his stepdad.",
        "Bill: Oh, you think so, huh?",
        "Brooke: So, we're good not getting married right away?",
        "Bill: Define \"right away.\"",
        "Brooke: It'll be soon. I don't want to drag this out any more than you do.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, I'm sure ridge doesn't, either. He's gonna be very disappointed, not getting his sweaty palms on my 12.5% of Forrester.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Well, this isn't about ridge. This isn't about Forrester. This is about us and our future together. My life with you -- I want that. But I want R.J. to be a part of it, too.",
        "Bill: Then we wait.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Bill: But not for long. I need you. I need you with me. And I have for a long time.",
        "Brooke: I'd better get back.",
        "Bill: Well, tell R.J. that I'll, uh, meet him in the gym sometime -- throw the gloves on, go a few rounds.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Bill.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: This could be a real problem.",
        "Thomas: Not necessarily.",
        "Steffy: R.J. comes home from school and he then tells his mom to basically not marry Bill? How do you think Brooke feels about that?",
        "Thomas: Dad will calm him down.",
        "Steffy: I don't know. It feels like dad's wavering. We need those shares, and to get them, Brooke needs to marry Bill, and that needs to happen as soon as possible, before granddad gets any more infatuated with Quinn.",
        "Eric: So, you're okay with the venue, right?",
        "Quinn: Really? To be married here, in your home?",
        "Eric: Surrounded by family.",
        "Quinn: Hopefully, yes.",
        "Eric: They wouldn't miss it. Come on. They'll all be here.",
        "Quinn: All right. Well... there's ridge, Thomas, Steffy, and Wyatt.",
        "Eric: And don't worry. It's gonna be fabulous.",
        "Quinn: Oh, you sound so sure about that.",
        "Eric: I'm marrying you. It's the last wedding in my life.",
        "Quinn: Oh, no. I don't like the sound of that.",
        "Eric: Why not?",
        "Quinn: Well, it's -- I mean, it's okay. It's -- you know what I mean.",
        "Eric: [Chuckling] Oh, my -- come on. You're adding 30 years to my life.",
        "Quinn: Just 30 years?",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Quinn: Fine. Let's get these invitations out. I can only imagine the responses they're gonna get.",
        "Eric: All right. Come on. Let's get it over with. Let's get it over with, and let's go and have some dinner. Come on.",
        "Quinn: Yes, before the masses rally another intervention.",
        "Eric: That's not gonna happen. You're gonna be Mrs. Eric Forrester, and there's nothing ridge or anybody else can do to prevent that.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "R.J.: Are you sending me back to boarding school?",
        "Ridge: Don't be ridiculous.",
        "R.J.: I know what I saw when I walked in here.",
        "Ridge: Your mom and I were discussing something.",
        "R.J.: [Chuckles] Discussion, huh?",
        "Ridge: And I was hugging her. What's the big deal? It was a hug.",
        "R.J.: Well, there's a difference between hugging and --",
        "Ridge: All right. Hey. Calm down. It's okay.",
        "R.J.: You're still in love with her. It's obvious.",
        "Ridge: I told you I'll always be in love with your mother.",
        "R.J.: No, but you two are meant for each other.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] You got to prepare yourself for the possibility that your mother's gonna end up with Bill Spencer.",
        "R.J.: I j-- I don't get it. How can you let this happen? What's going on?",
        "Brooke: [Gasps]",
        "R.J.: Mom.",
        "Brooke: Hi, honey! I love walking in and seeing you here.",
        "R.J.: What happened? Please tell me you're not going away to marry Bill Spencer.",
        "Brooke: No. No, I'm not.",
        "Quinn: There. How's that?",
        "Eric: \"Quinn fuller and Eric Forrester request the honor of your presence at their wedding.\" You know, they're lucky we're inviting them at all.",
        "Quinn: Ha!",
        "Eric: Can we spice this up a little? Uh... \"hey, kids! We're done shacking up! She's not leaving! We're getting married!\" Put that there. Put that there.",
        "Quinn: No. Maybe a little more civil than that.",
        "Eric: Why should it be civil? They're not being civil to us.",
        "Quinn: Are you angry with them?",
        "Eric: No. No, I'm not angry. I just -- I get it. It's just so --",
        "Quinn: Disrespectful?",
        "Eric: Yeah. To both of us.",
        "Quinn: Well... respect is not something that I'm used to, but you -- you must be respected...by everyone, most especially your family, and that's what really concerns me.",
        "Eric: Well, don't let it.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well...",
        "Eric: Don't let it.",
        "Quinn: ...It does. It does. You -- you're the king of this castle. You're the patriarch of this family. You're -- you're responsible for everything, especially some of their lives, and this has to be the first time you've been disrespected in your entire life, and why? Because of me. I never wanted that, Eric. I-I-I-I only wanted to bring positive things into your life, not -- not family dysfunction. But you know what? I'm not gonna give up... because I love you. I love you too much, and -- and I know what I bring into your life, and god knows what you bring into mine, and I think that the only solution to all of this is to get all of your children and your grandchildren and my son to realize this is not a manipulation from me -- this is real -- and that I would never, ever do anything to hurt you. I need you to talk to them, Eric. Please? All those beautiful things that you say to me -- you need to say it to them. You've got to get them to understand that I am not the enemy... and that we all want the same thing -- for you to be happy. I'm sorry. I-I-I'm sorry. I don't mean to go on and on like this. It's just -- it just means a lot to me.",
        "Eric: Never apologize to me for expressing your feelings. Quinn, I promise you -- I promise you, for as long as I live, as long as I'm breathing and smiling... that my family's gonna understand it's all because of you. They're stubborn. They're not stupid. And when they're here, when they come to this wedding, they're gonna witness how much you mean to me and how much my life has changed because of you, and it'll all -- it'll all resolve itself beautifully.",
        "Quinn: Even with Steffy?",
        "Eric: Even Steffy.",
        "Steffy: I will never understand what granddad sees in that woman.",
        "Thomas: She does seem to make him happy.",
        "Steffy: Thomas, Quinn can't be trusted. Everyone knows that. We've got to protect granddad. He spent his whole life building this company. But we just -- we got to secure those shares.",
        "Thomas: And, hopefully, Brooke is flying off with Bill to get married as we speak.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "R.J.: Thank you for listening to me.",
        "Brooke: We always listen to you, honey.",
        "R.J.: I knew you would come through. It's no secret I wanted you two to be together, and when I came back home, saw you two hugging it out...",
        "Brooke: R.J...",
        "R.J.: What? You're the ones who always talk about destiny -- how you were meant to be together, how you didn't run off with Spencer. And dad and Caroline are over. I mean... you guys are both free and available. Connect the dots.",
        "Brooke: I did what you asked. I didn't run off today with Bill to get married. But we are gonna get married -- sooner rather than later.",
        "R.J.: Wait. Mom --",
        "Ridge: No, you wait, son. You didn't come back here to get caught up in all this drama. You came here to spend time with your friends and with your family, and that's exactly what you're gonna do. And -- and, sure, we'll -- we'll spend time together.",
        "Brooke: That's right. [Chuckles] Yes. We will. We have you here, and we'll all be together. We are reunited, and that means more to me than anything.",
        "R.J.: Okay.",
        "Steffy: We should check in with dad -- see if he heard anything from Brooke. I'm hoping that he was able to get through to R.J.",
        "Thomas: Let me see if he's still here.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Thomas: Hey, R.J., come here. I want to talk to you for a second.",
        "R.J.: Hey.",
        "Steffy: Hey. Have you heard anything from your mom?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Did she and Bill take off yet?",
        "R.J.: Uh, actually, we just talked. She is not marrying him.",
        "Steffy: What?!",
        "R.J.: [Scoffs] I don't get you guys. I mean, am I the only one who sees how much of a train wreck this would be? I mean, I know she's not your mom, but come on. Bill Spencer? Would you wish that on your worst enemy?",
        "Steffy: R.J., there is a lot at stake.",
        "R.J.: I had to tell her how I felt, all right? But we'll see. Uh, she hasn't broken it off completely.",
        "Steffy: What do you mean?",
        "R.J.: Well, she said she would hold the wedding off for the moment but... they'll get married soon.",
        "Steffy: R.J... we're family.",
        "R.J.: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: Okay? Now we need to trust each other. I totally get where you're coming from. I-I know how you feel about Brooke and Bill, but that's her choice. There's a lot riding on this -- more than you know.",
        "R.J.: All right. Just tell me.",
        "Steffy: No, I -- [Sighs] Not yet. Trust me.",
        "R.J.: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: Thomas and Dad and even your mom -- we know what we're doing. You can't get in the middle. The future of our company and the family is at stake.",
        "Quinn: Okay. That's it.",
        "Eric: Beautiful invitation for a beautiful event.",
        "Quinn: You sure about this? It's your last chance to pull out.",
        "Eric: Send it.",
        "Quinn: Oooh! I feel like the earth is about to shake!",
        "Eric: It's been doing that since the first time I kissed you.",
        "Quinn: [Breathes deeply] Uhh.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I couldn't do it. I...couldn't run off and marry Bill.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm glad you didn't... for our son's sake.",
        "Brooke: Right.",
        "Ridge: Of course. Yeah.",
        "Brooke: For our son. I needed him to know that I do listen to him, that I hear what he has to say.",
        "Ridge: You always listened. You were a good mother. You are a good mother, and you were -- you were a good wife.",
        "Brooke: But I am going to marry Bill. And then I get the shares and give them to you, and you can get Quinn out of the office.",
        "Ridge: Well, let's just see what happens, Logan. Let's just -- let's just see what happens, Brooke. We have plenty of time, so...",
        "Brooke: Well, there's no reason to drag our feet, right?",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Ridge: Ah.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: Uh...it's an invitation from my dad and from Quinn. \"We request the honor of your presence\" at their wedding, two days from now.",
        "Brooke: What? Oh, my god!",
        "Ridge: He's gonna do it.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: They're getting married. He's gonna marry that woman."
