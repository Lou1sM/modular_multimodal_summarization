        "Liam asks what is going on; what's wrong. Hope says she has always wanted a life with him but she is sorry ..he says it is okay. She can tell him anything. She says she is pregnant. Quinn tells Wyatt that he and Hope have too much. She will come back to him. Do not give up. Wyatt tells Quinn that he doesn't want to hear anything from her, not even see her. His whole future with Hope is in jeopardy because of her. Pam and Charlie fill Ivy, Rick and Caroline, Carter, Maya and Rick in on what Quinn did in Paris. Now they have all the proof they need. Pam shows them the video. Eric says Quinn is a lot more dangerous than they thought. The group tell Pam that there is no way Hope will stay with Wyatt now. Quinn tells Wyatt that Hope and Liam were together because of her and she could not let that stick. She wants him and Hope to grow old together. And because of what he did in Paris she thought they would. She thinks it will work out in the end. She is his mother and will always be in his life. She knows she has messed up but she can be a good person. He tells her this is not about her. She is the last person he wants to see right now. Hope is with Liam right now and she could come home any moment and move her things out. Quinn is baggage and he wants her out right now. Liam's heart sinks and he is stunned and asks Hope if she is sure. She says she just took a test. She was not expecting this, but it changes everything. The baby is Wyatt's. He says it is not fair just as they were getting back together. He says none of this is her fault. Donna tells Caroline not to be so modest. She had a lot to do with Ridge's designs being accepted. Charlie says what Quinn did in Paris is out of their jurisdiction but he's keeping his eyes on her. Liam says there has to be another way. Everybody on this planet seems to want to keep them apart. He is not going to lose her. That is not an option. He suggests they raise this child together. Hope wants to be with him as much as he does. Even if that is his brother's child, he is not accepting it any other way. He will love this child because it is part of her. She says she can not do that. She can not have a baby by one man and have it raised by another. She wants to be with him but this is not the answer. Liam says she was deceived by Quinn and he will not let her sacrifice her life by staying with Wyatt when he was not her original choice. He will not have her obligated.",
        "Quinn returns to her studio to find Ivy with the welders mask on and blow torch. Ivy calls her a sick and depraved woman. Quinn says her little tumble in the Seine didn't stop Ivy .maybe five or six minutes before she hit on Liam. Ivy tells her she is only going to say this one time \u0096 do not ever touch her again. She doesn't know who she feels sorrier for \u0096 Hope and Liam or Wyatt because she is his mother. Quinn dishes back not to feel sorry for Wyatt. He doesn't need her pity. Ivy says she's not so sure. Because of what Quinn has done Wyatt is going to lose Hope and his marriage, everything he cares about. Liam tells Hope they can still be a family. They just need to tell everyone the baby is his. Astonished, she says she can not do that. They will know it is not. She knows he would make an incredible father but this is a secret they would have to carry around for their entire lives. She can not do that to him or to Wyatt. It would destroy Liam's family. He says he does not care about Wyatt or his family. He only cares about Hope. He's said it before, he is not giving up on them. She says she wants to be with him too but this is not the answer. She doesn't know what to do. Does he want her to walk away from her marriage. He asks does anyone else know. Has she seen a doctor? She says no, only the two of them know but they will soon enough. He chirps what if they don't. If it is just the two of them that knows and she won't let him raise this baby with her then they have to act quickly. She asks what is he talking about. He stammers there is one other thing they can do."

        "Liam: Hope. What's wrong? What is it?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Liam, I have... I've always wanted you. I've always wanted a life with you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah. I-I want a life with you, too. What's going on?",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry that I'm putting you through this.",
        "Liam: It's okay. It's okay. Whatever it is, you can tell me. It'll be all right.",
        "Hope: I'm pregnant.",
        "Quinn: You and hope share something extraordinary. Liam can never destroy that.",
        "Wyatt: I know what hope and I have.",
        "Quinn: Well, then stop doubting yourself. She'll come back to you. She will. I am not going to let you give up.",
        "Wyatt: Who said I was? Mom, you know what? I-I don't want to hear you. I don't want to see you. I don't even want to be anywhere near you right now.",
        "Quinn: I don't feel good about leaving you.",
        "Wyatt: I don't care. What does feel good to you, huh? Violence? Manipulation? My future and my marriage are in jeopardy because of you.",
        "Rick: We haven't heard much about Quinn lately.",
        "Eric: What about Quinn? What'd she do now?",
        "Pam: You are not going to believe this.",
        "Carter: Well, nothing surprises me about that lady.",
        "Maya: She has always rubbed me the wrong way.",
        "Caroline: Gave me the chills.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, ask Ivy about the chills. What you're about to find out will shock you but not surprise you. Pam?",
        "Pam: What happened to Ivy was not an accident. She was pushed into that river on purpose.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Pam: And it wasn't by some Parisian mime or a Swedish tourist or some students pulling a prank.",
        "Donna: Pammy, please. Come on.",
        "Pam: Ivy was pushed into that river by none other than --",
        "Donna: Quinn! It was Quinn.",
        "Carter: Quinn?",
        "Caroline: Are you serious?",
        "Maya: She did that to you?",
        "Ivy: Unfortunately, yeah.",
        "Eric: How is this possible?",
        "Rick: I didn't even know that she was in paris.",
        "Pam: Yeah, nobody did.",
        "Donna: Uh-huh. She snuck over there.",
        "Charlie: Aboard Liam and Ivy's flight.",
        "Maya: You saw her?",
        "Ivy: She was in disguise. We had no clue.",
        "Caroline: Quinn was that hell-bent on keeping Liam from meeting hope?",
        "Maya: Wow.",
        "Carter: It's unbelievable.",
        "Pam: See, Charlie just had this hunch that something was off, so he called in some favors to these bigwigs.",
        "Charlie: All part of being a security VIP.",
        "Pam: And now we've got all the proof we need. Okay. Take a look. Here we are at the paris airport, and who's getting on the bike in the dark glasses but Quinn fuller? And now for the coup de grace -- the push.",
        "Eric: Quinn fuller's a lot more dangerous than we thought.",
        "Pam: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: I didn't push Ivy that hard. It was -- it was like a little nudge.",
        "Wyatt: Oh! Oh, okay, well, in that case...",
        "Quinn: Honey, I am so sorry. I know I've been a little too overprotective.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, that's one way of putting it.",
        "Quinn: You're a smart, thoughtful, intelligent young man, and I should respect you enough to let you live your own life.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Quinn: Just that hope and Liam were together again because of me, and I-I couldn't let it go on any further. I had to make a move.",
        "Wyatt: The wrong move.",
        "Quinn: It might be hard for you to see this, but in my heart, I believe that you and hope are gonna grow old together because of what I did.",
        "Liam: No, you're not. No.",
        "Hope: I am.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] You're sure?",
        "Hope: I just took a test. I didn't expect this. I really didn't expect this, but it -- Liam, it changes everything. I'm pregnant... and it's Wyatt's.",
        "Rick: You must be furious at Quinn.",
        "Eric: Well, thank goodness Charlie was on the case.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: Yes. Charlie, our hero once again.",
        "Pam: Oh, I almost forgot. I baked these special...",
        "Carter: What a surprise.",
        "Pam: ...In honor of Charlie. So, everybody has to have at least one. You know, sort of like a toast.",
        "Ivy: Uh, look, could you save me one? I have something I need to go and do.",
        "Donna: We'll save you a big corner piece.",
        "Eric: Well, I'm assuming that, uh -- that hope and Liam know about this?",
        "Pam: Yeah. And we spoke to deacon and Brooke earlier, too.",
        "Carter: What about Wyatt?",
        "Rick: He'd better not be in on it with his mother.",
        "Charlie: No, there's no reason to believe he is.",
        "Caroline: I feel really bad for Wyatt.",
        "Maya: Yeah. Not only is his mother completely nuts...",
        "Caroline: He's probably gonna lose hope, too.",
        "Rick: \"Probably\"? There's no way that hope is gonna stay with Wyatt after this.",
        "Wyatt: You don't know that for sure.",
        "Quinn: I have a gut feeling about this.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Quinn: It's all gonna work out in the end.",
        "Wyatt: Good.",
        "Quinn: And I-I'm not worried about you and hope because I have faith in her feelings for you. You -- you have given her something that Liam never could -- your unconditional love and your undying devotion.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, hope knows how I feel about her.",
        "Quinn: Honey, I'm your mother. I'm always gonna be in your life. Look, I-I know -- I know that I messed up, but you have to forgive me. I could be a good person. I could be a good mother.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, just stop it! Okay? What don't you get about this? This isn't about you. You are the last person that I care about right now. Hope is with Liam, and I don't know if she's ever coming back. I could get a phone call or a text saying, \"goodbye. That's it. It's over. I'm done.\" And then a bunch of movers are gonna come in here and take all her stuff out.",
        "Quinn: No. She wouldn't do that.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, she might. And you know what? I would understand because being with me -- the baggage that comes along with being married to me -- you are not just this overbearing mother-in-law who tells her what to wear and how to decorate the house. You put people's lives in danger -- calculating and manipulating. And who in their right mind would want to sign up for a lifetime of that?! No, you know what? Just get out of here. I don't want to be around you right now.",
        "Quinn: Honey, I just --",
        "Wyatt: Please just get out of here!",
        "Liam: Uh... I mean, when -- when did you -- what -- I mean, were you just -- were you feeling like --",
        "Hope: I don't know. I-I don't know. It -- I've been so busy with Hope for the Future since I got back from paris and the honeymoon, and I knew that I had been a little late, but I-I didn't think anything of it. I really just thought it was stress. I-I mean, that's what happened last time, and I didn't want to cry wolf again. I didn't want to freak out like last time, but after Wyatt brought up starting a family, and after talking to my mom about kids, part of me just thought that maybe -- maybe I should double-check. So when I left Wyatt and Quinn to come over here, I-I just had to be sure.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] This can't be happening. How is this -- how is this happening? Um -- um, well -- well, what do we do?",
        "Hope: What can we do?",
        "Liam: [Sighs] I-I -- God! It's never been fair for us, is it? It's never fair. I mean, just when we're finally getting back on track... this -- really?",
        "Hope: Liam, when you told me what Quinn did...I didn't want to let her get away with it. I didn't want her to win. I-I didn't want to be messed with and -- and manipulated -- not again, and especially not from her. But then -- [Sighs] [Sniffles] How could she do this to us? Liam, I'm so -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Liam: None of this is your fault. None of it.",
        "Hope: Liam, I came over here wanting to start a life with you, to make plans with you, but I just -- I had this feeling.",
        "Liam: And you were right.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Maya: Should have taken me to paris with you.",
        "Rick: You would have been able to stop Quinn?",
        "Maya: No. But you would have had a lot more fun.",
        "Carter: So, you heard from hope yet?",
        "Rick: No. Uh, but I texted her.",
        "Donna: Yeah, I'm sure she's just trying to figure things out, right?",
        "Rick: Yeah. I did hear from Ridge. He e-mailed his new design.",
        "Eric: Good. I'm glad to hear that. So, you and Ridge are turning out to be quite a design team.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, they're mostly his ideas. I'm just along for the ride.",
        "Donna: Oh, come on. Don't be so modest.",
        "Eric: So, carter, what about this? I mean, is there something we should be doing about Quinn?",
        "Carter: Yeah, have her committed.",
        "Maya: Or arrested.",
        "Charlie: Crime took place in France. Out of our jurisdiction. Uh, but I got eyes on her.",
        "Donna: Well, I'm sure she'll manage to cause trouble somehow.",
        "Pam: I think that's what we're all afraid of.",
        "[Welder crackling]",
        "Quinn: Excuse me? Hello? Excuse me? What are you doing here? Hello?! Are you kidding me?",
        "[Crackling stops]",
        "Quinn: All right, I'm gonna give you about three seconds, and then I'm calling the cops. One, two --",
        "Ivy: Yeah, see, I wouldn't do that if I were you.",
        "Liam: We can't -- we can't just accept this, hope. I mean, there's got to be another way.",
        "Hope: I don't see how.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] God! Why are we suffering through this again?! I mean, it's like everybody on the planet wants to keep us apart. They want to keep us unhappy. Why is this happening? [Sighs]",
        "Hope: I wish I knew the answer.",
        "Liam: I am not losing you, hope. I'm not losing you. I'm not gonna let it happen. There's got to be another way. We'll -- we'll... we'll raise this child together.",
        "Hope: Liam.",
        "Liam: Hey, why not? I mean, tell me why not. You know, there's all different kinds...",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Liam: ...Of families these days, and you and I would be together. That's all that matters, right? You want that just as much as I do.",
        "Hope: Yes, I-I do.",
        "Liam: Okay. Okay, so then we're not gonna let anything get in our way.",
        "Hope: Liam, you're -- you're talking about raising your brother's child.",
        "Liam: I don't care. I'll do whatever it takes. I am not letting go of you. That is not an option, hope -- I am not accepting any other way.",
        "Donna: Uh, we're in the office. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: [Clears throat]",
        "Donna: Yeah. You know, I-I really feel for Wyatt. I do. I mean, but come on -- never really had a chance. Hope's heart's always been with Liam.",
        "Eric: Nothing's standing in their way now.",
        "Carter: Not even Quinn.",
        "Charlie: And we'll make sure of that.",
        "Ivy: This is a nice studio.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. You want to, um, take off my gear? What do you want?",
        "Ivy: You know I know what you did, Quinn -- pushing me into the river.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, it's old news.",
        "Ivy: You know, you are one sick, depraved woman.",
        "Quinn: You know, your little tumble didn't seem to faze you all that much. I mean, how many minutes did it take for you to hit on Liam? What -- five? [Sniffs] Six?",
        "Ivy: Okay, I'm gonna say this to you once and once only. Don't you ever touch me again.",
        "Quinn: Mm. Oh, well, I barely gave you a tap. And you know, you went over surprisingly easy.",
        "Ivy: You know what, Quinn? I can't figure out who I feel more sorry for. I can't decide if it's, uh -- if it's Liam and hope or if it's Wyatt because you're his mother.",
        "Quinn: Oh, thank you, but my son doesn't need your pity.",
        "Ivy: Oh, really? Are you sure of that, Quinn? Because you do realize because of you, Wyatt's about to lose hope and his marriage. It's everything he cares about.",
        "Liam: We can be a family. We can raise this child -- just the two of us. You just -- you just -- tell everyone it's mine.",
        "Hope: But we'll always know it's not. Liam, I-I can't have a baby with one man and raise it with another.",
        "Liam: I know that, but I promise you, I will love this child like my own because it's -- it's part of you.",
        "Hope: I know. I-I know that. I have no doubt that you would be a really wonderful father, but this -- this is a secret that we would have to carry around our whole lives. I can't do that. I can't do it to you. I can't do it to Wyatt. It could destroy your family.",
        "Liam: I don't care about my family! I don't care about Wyatt. Hope, I care about you. I told you this before, and -- and it's still true. I am -- I am not giving up on us.",
        "Hope: Okay, well, I don't want to lose you, either. I-I want to be with you, but this is not the answer, okay? So I-I don't know what to do.",
        "Liam: I don't know. I don't know, hope, but Wyatt is not who you chose. He's not who you wanted for the rest of your life.",
        "Hope: But he is my husband.",
        "Liam: Yes. Yes, he's your husband because you were deceived. I will not have you feeling obligated. I will not have you making this sacrifice.",
        "Hope: What other solution is there? You just want me to walk away from my marriage?",
        "Liam: Does anybody else know about this?",
        "Hope: No, just you and me.",
        "Liam: Have you seen a doctor?",
        "Hope: No. But people are gonna know soon enough.",
        "Liam: What if they don't? Hope, listen. Nobody knows you're pregnant. It's just you and me right now. [Sighs] And if you won't let me raise this baby with you, we can -- well, we -- we have to act quickly.",
        "Hope: Liam, what are you talking about?",
        "Liam: There is one other thing we could do."
