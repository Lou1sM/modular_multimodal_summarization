    "Recap": [
        "The Forrester's discuss not attending Eric's wedding. Pam wonders if they cannot like Quinn but still be polite and attend the wedding. The others voice their opinion and come up with a big no. Felicia comes in late and wants to know where Quinn is and why they have not talked Eric out of marrying this crazy person. Ridge says he dated under the radar and did not ask their opinion. Felicia asks where is Kristen as Eric was adamant that everyone be here. Zende says his mom was dragging her heels hoping Eric would change his mind and there be no reason to come. Felicia says she did not come to see a wedding. She came to see one did not happen. Ridge says it sounds like they are all in agreement. They are here to make sure Eric does not marry Quinn. Carter shows Eric the papers he has drawn up that will need at least one witness plus the pre-nup that they talked about. Then Carter shows him one other that was at Ridge's suggestion \u0096 a power of attorney in case of emergency. Eric knows that Ridge wants that to be him. Carter says Eric can name whomever he wants. Eric thanks him and says he will look it all over tonight. But he thinks tomorrow the family will look at him and Quinn and be reassured. Quinn tells Steffy that she is the apple of Eric's eye and is named after that other badass person so if she were at the wedding tomorrow it would be like a sign from Stephanie. Steffy tells her that she may sleep in her grandfather's bed and call herself Mrs. Forrester but she will never be one of them. Quinn says she knows she is not her favorite person but she is not hurting her right now. The only ones she is hurting is her grandfather and her husband. So just how does that fit in with Steffy's ideas. And she wonders if Steffy would ever let Eric stop her from the life she wants. Because that is exactly what the entire family is trying to do to Eric. She has walked out on her husband and now she wants to walk out on her grandfather for the rest of his life if he marries Quinn. That is mighty self righteous. Steffy says it might not happen today or tomorrow but someday Eric will remember their warnings. Yes Stephanie leaving left a big gaping hole and maybe they should not have moved out and left him all alone. But they will rally around and move back in if that is what it takes once Eric throws her out ..which will be soon. She can count on that. Ridge tells the group that Eric had a prenup drawn up and that is good but not good enough. He had his own papers drawn up naming him as POA. Felicia says she will speak with her dad tonight.",
        "Eric walks into the office at that moment and gives Felicia a big hug. He says he needs a sympathetic right hand man tomorrow and asks Thorne if he will be his best man. He tells Felicia that no one in this room knows Quinn like he does so instead of asking the others she should have come to him. That is what tomorrow is about. He wants them to see just what he and Quinn see in each other and mean to each other. Rick says they know all they need to know about her. Eric says that is based on hearsay. Thorne reminds Eric that his mother hasn't been gone that long. Eric says perhaps not but the rest of them can measure their lives in decades still but he cannot do that anymore. They are asking him to die alone in respect of Stephanie's memory. Felicia tells him he will never be alone as long as he has his children. He loves that but quips when is the last time he saw her in person. She will come tomorrow and he will be happy for her to meet Quinn and then they will talk. Finally Thorne gives in and says yes he will be his dad's best man. Eric says good, he knew he could depend on him just like he can depend on the others to come and see what he and Quinn share between them. He leaves and they all look like someone has let out the air of all their tires. Eric returns home and shows the papers to Quinn that she needs to sign. She is nonplussed when she hears it is a pre- nup. He explains to her that after tomorrow she not only has a legal tie to him but everyone in the family so this protects them. She doesn't even read it all over and signs. She says she does not need his money. She only needs him to be himself. Rick tells the group that he cannot sit there tomorrow and watch his dad marry that woman. Steffy says she certainly cannot either. Thorne speaks up and says he is not going alone. Ridge says it sounds like they have all made their decision. The only thing left for Eric is just to see an empty house. Maybe then he will realize his mistake when they all boycott the wedding."

        "Quinn: You say you'll never trust me or accept me.",
        "Steffy: That's correct. You say you change. It's really just like white noise to me.",
        "Quinn: Except we both love your grandfather and we both love my son, so there has to be some common ground we can find knowing that they won't be happy without both of us in their lives.",
        "Steffy: You know what you're like? You're like a chronic illness Wyatt's just gotten used to managing.",
        "Quinn: Come to the wedding tomorrow. The rest of the family will follow your lead. It's only an hour out of all of your lives. I will not take it as getting anyone's blessing. But it will be a blessing for Eric.",
        "Pam: Should we just do it for Eric's sake? I mean, should we just maybe put everything aside and go to the stupid wedding?",
        "Thomas: Is it really supporting granddad if we know it's not what's best for him?",
        "Maya: In my experience, having people there who are disgusted by what you're doing doesn't make for the best wedding day.",
        "Zende: He seems to really want it, though.",
        "Rick: Yeah, that's what bothers me, too. If it was just one of those \"I'm bored\" romances, why not? But marriage?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Felicia: Where is he?",
        "Thorne: Felicia.",
        "Felicia: Where is daddy, and why are you people letting him marry this crazy person?",
        "Carter: Your marriage license has to be signed by one witness at least.",
        "Eric: I'm sure I can bribe somebody into signing it or shame them.",
        "Carter: The prenuptial agreement. I dropped in a few standard clauses after we talked, so read it carefully.",
        "Eric: Fine. I will. Thank you, carter. Thank you.",
        "Carter: There's one more thing. It's for your family's protection.",
        "Eric: Ridge's idea, right?",
        "Carter: Ridge only suggested what any estate attorney would have.",
        "Eric: I would never ask ridge for advice about my estate.",
        "Carter: It's just a power of attorney to protect your interests in the company in case of emergency.",
        "Eric: If I'm incapacitated?",
        "Carter: That's right.",
        "Eric: Or dead.",
        "Carter: No, then your will would kick in. Until then, it's helpful to designate someone to make decisions for you, both personally and for the company.",
        "Eric: And ridge feels that should be him.",
        "Carter: You can name whomever you want.",
        "Eric: And ridge feels that should be him.",
        "Felicia: And suddenly I get e-mailed this wedding invitation. How could you even let dad date this woman?",
        "Ridge: He didn't ask my opinion. He kept it under wraps.",
        "Felicia: I thought you fired her.",
        "Ridge: Well, maybe that's why he kept it under wraps. What -- you got to start to listen and stop blaming me. Why are you blaming me? Come here.",
        "Felicia: I love you, but you always act like you're the head of the family until something goes wrong.",
        "Rick: Hey, I've got a laundry list of reasons we should burn ridge at the stake. However, dad outmaneuvered us all.",
        "Felicia: What about everything she did to Liam Spencer?",
        "Thorne: Yeah, why isn't she in jail?",
        "Maya: How do you know about all that?",
        "Pam: I like to keep the family aware of what's going on.",
        "Felicia: Speaking of family, where's Kristen? My father was very explicit that he expected everyone to show up.",
        "Zende: My mom keeps calling hoping to hear that the wedding's been canceled. I'm not supposed to tell granddad, but, uh, she's too upset to make it here tomorrow.",
        "Felicia: So? I didn't show up to go to a wedding. I showed up to make sure one didn't happen.",
        "Ridge: All right. All right, Felicia, you've made your point. You've made yourself known like you always do, and I'm glad you're here, 'cause the more, the better.",
        "Felicia: [Scoffs]",
        "Ridge: So we all agree, huh? Together we're gonna stop dad from marrying Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Eric loves all his children and all of his grandchildren, but you need to know you are the apple of your grandfather's eye. Your courage, your braininess, that -- that badass way about you, not to mention you are named after the great love of his life. You being there tomorrow would be like a sign from her.",
        "Steffy: Take my being here today as a sign that you may be sleeping in my grandfather's bed. You may call yourself Mrs. Forrester. But you are never gonna be one of us. Never.",
        "Eric: Does this power of attorney have an exception clause?",
        "Carter: If there's language you'd like me to add, I can --",
        "Eric: No. No, that's all right. I'll, uh, I'll look it over tonight. You weren't expecting me to sign my power of attorney now, were you?",
        "Carter: Expectations aren't part of the service. All I do is offer advice.",
        "Eric: I understand that my family's nervous about this. Frantic, even. But after tomorrow when they see Quinn and me together, I think they'll be reassured.",
        "Steffy: How could you possibly think I can condone this wedding after everything you've done to me and the people I love?",
        "Quinn: You're a very idealistic person, Steffy. I respect that. You stand up for what you think is right. You want everyone else to stand up for what you think is right.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, well, being appreciated by you has never really been one of my ambitions.",
        "Quinn: I get that. Yeah. Do you get, though, that you're not hurting me? I know that's what your intention is. But the only people you're hurting are your grandfather and your husband. So how does that fit in with those ideals of yours?",
        "Steffy: Not well. Not well at all.",
        "Quinn: Would you ever let Eric stop you from living the life you want? 'Cause you realize that that's exactly what you and your family are trying to do to him.",
        "Ridge: What is it with you? You always think you have some mysterious power over dad. You don't.",
        "Felicia: No, it's not mysterious at all. I worship the man. And what I ask for I get.",
        "Thorne: It's true. She mostly does.",
        "Rick: Well, that might work with shiny new cars and trips to Rome, but asking dad to give up his intimacy, his companionship? That's -- that's something totally different.",
        "Pam: Intimacy? Please. He might as well be marrying a cobra.",
        "Thorne: Has anyone said at least, \"gee, dad, what about a prenup?\"",
        "Ridge: It's been taken care of.",
        "Thorne: By you?",
        "Ridge: By him.",
        "Maya: That's good. He's not going into it blind.",
        "Ridge: It's not good enough. So I asked carter to draw up a durable power of attorney naming me.",
        "Zende: You mean just in case granddad gets sick?",
        "Ridge: Yes. In case he gets sick, I'll take care of the company and take care of him.",
        "Rick: Why couldn't it be me? You're not worried about the company, ridge. You're always worried about yourself!",
        "Felicia: Come on, guys! Let's focus on what's important, namely calling off this wedding. I'll talk to daddy tonight.",
        "Zende: He'll be watching the game with me.",
        "Maya: Unless there's last-minute wedding prep.",
        "Zende: He wouldn't miss the game.",
        "Pam: What game?",
        "Zende: Thursday night football. Texans at the patriots.",
        "Felicia: Can I watch, too? I can talk to daddy then. I love football.",
        "Thorne: No, sis. You like men in uniforms.",
        "Felicia: And the strategy, the action, the drama, crazy hail Mary pass or going for it on the fourth down.",
        "Maya: But mainly the guys in uniform.",
        "Thorne: [Chuckles]",
        "Felicia: Maybe.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Eric: Felicia.",
        "Felicia: Daddy. [Laughs]",
        "Eric: Oh, wow. You came.",
        "Felicia: When have I ever said no to you?",
        "Eric: Hmm. So happy to have the two of you here for this. This is great. You'll have a chance to catch up with each other. Now, I need a sympathetic face to stand up with me tomorrow. And as you may or may not know, that sort of eliminates your two brothers. Thorne, would you be my best man tomorrow?",
        "Thorne: I don't know what to say, dad. Naturally I'm -- I'm honored.",
        "Felicia: Daddy.",
        "Eric: Yes, sweetheart?",
        "Felicia: What would you say if I told you I am not ready to turn you over to another woman?",
        "Eric: I'd say you've been talking to ridge.",
        "Felicia: Well, I didn't know your intentions, so yes, I've been asking everybody about her. And frankly, what I hear worries me.",
        "Eric: You should have come to me. Nobody in this room knows Quinn the way I do.",
        "Rick: You could say that we know her as well as we want to.",
        "Eric: Based on what, rick? Hearsay? And the perfectly cordial relationship we all shared with her when she worked here? That's what tomorrow is all about. I want you all to see what she and I mean to each other.",
        "Thorne: Dad, can I just say... Mother hasn't been gone that long.",
        "Eric: You all can still measure your lives in decades. I can't do that anymore. What am I supposed to do? Die alone out of respect for her memory?",
        "Felicia: Daddy, you will never be alone as long as you have us.",
        "Eric: Well, I appreciate that sentiment. But when is the last time I saw you in person? I'm sorry. We'll talk after the wedding, all right? I can't wait for you to meet her. I think you have a lot in common with her. So, what about it, Thorne? You gonna be my best man tomorrow, son?",
        "Thorne: [Sighs] Sure thing, dad. Yeah. You got it.",
        "Eric: I knew I could depend on you, just like I depend on everybody opening their eyes and seeing what this woman means to me tomorrow at my wedding.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Quinn: I won't pretend to understand you.",
        "Steffy: Good.",
        "Quinn: But your grandfather sees you as a loving, accepting person. Isn't that who you want to be for him?",
        "Steffy: I'm done with you.",
        "Quinn: Look, can we just take this one day at a time? The wedding is tomorrow.",
        "Steffy: If there is a wedding. Maybe my grandfather will come to his senses.",
        "Quinn: Or what? You're gonna cut him out of your life forever? Don't you realize this campaign to wipe me off the face of the earth is making shambles out of your life, not mine? First you walk out on your husband, then tomorrow the rest of your family? How righteously alone do you really want to be?",
        "Steffy: He'll listen. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday soon he is gonna remember every word of warning. And hey, I want my grandfather to be happy. But not you. He's lonely. He and my grandmother, they were so connected. And losing her, he has this -- this gaping wound, and he tried to hide it for so long. And maybe -- maybe we should have moved back in here. Maybe we should have really rallied around him to -- to keep her memories alive. But we will do that -- the day he throws you out. Which will be soon. Count on it.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rick: Thorne, what's the matter with you, man? They snip off your manhood overseas?",
        "Thorne: He put me on the spot, rick. What was I supposed to say? No?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. \"No\" would have been really good.",
        "Thorne: Life is short, ridge. Even love can't last forever. Ask me how I know. Maybe I just want my father to be happy.",
        "Maya: Thorne, I promise you that's what we all want. But you and Felicia haven't been here to see close up how destructive this woman can be.",
        "Felicia: I just can't believe that dad thinks that she and I have a lot in common.",
        "Pam: Unless your ride home is a broom, I don't see it.",
        "Ridge: Hey. I get it, little brother. But in all the possible outcomes being married to Quinn fuller, happiness is not one of them.",
        "Eric: What's this? Keeping secrets?",
        "Quinn: Maybe there are a few things I would like to remember in public tomorrow. Where have you been?",
        "Eric: Legal business.",
        "Quinn: Hmm.",
        "Eric: Nothing puts me to sleep more easily. Uh, this needs to be signed today.",
        "Quinn: What is this?",
        "Eric: It's our prenuptial agreement.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Someone else has been keeping some secrets, too.",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Rick: I refuse to believe that we're helpless of this bona fide maniac.",
        "Steffy: No, it's like talking to the devil. Every damn time, it's like -- it's like she says the right things, but it's the wrong things, but somehow she makes it sound right, and then I feel like I'm being heartless or -- or selfish.",
        "Ridge: She is getting more delusional by the day.",
        "Steffy: No, it's -- it's not that. I think she sees us very clearly and she knows that we adore and respect granddad. But there are certain lines that we won't cross to go against him.",
        "Thomas: So what do we do?",
        "Steffy: I hate to say it. We start crossing them.",
        "Eric: Ridge said something that stuck with me. After tomorrow, you'll have a legalized relationship not only with me but with everybody else in my family. All of their inheritances, the work they do, everything. It could be impacted by our marriage whether we want it to be or not.",
        "Quinn: What if I refuse?",
        "Eric: To sign?",
        "Quinn: Uh, no. To read it. I can see here it has three places to sign and four places to initial.",
        "Eric: Yeah, yeah. Whatever it says there. You know, it also says that, uh, if you don't do your chores, you, uh, you don't get your allowance.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Okay.",
        "Eric: And that you're obligated to iron all my shirts and, uh, give me a massage every afternoon. Light starch, medium pressure.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Well, I am good with hot instruments and with using my hands.",
        "Eric: And so you are.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric: You're not gonna stamp your feet and say, \"why don't you trust me?\"",
        "Quinn: Uh, no, because I know why they don't, and I know that you do. And if you haven't figured it out already, I don't care about money. One of the benefits of making your way so young in life is you always know you can do it all by yourself. I don't need you to take care of me. I just need you to be you.",
        "Eric: I would sign that.",
        "Quinn: Well, I don't have that document in front of me, but this one's gonna have to do. Sign and initial where it says.",
        "Eric: And so I will.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric: Why does everything have to be difficult except us?",
        "Quinn: Well, obviously we must be doing something right.",
        "Thomas: Steff, if you've got a plan, you got to count me in.",
        "Steffy: If I had a plan, we wouldn't have this wedding looming over us tomorrow.",
        "Pam: I love Eric. I-I would do anything for him, and I want so much for him to be happy. But I...",
        "Maya: But Quinn isn't the answer.",
        "Pam: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Because she'll do anything.",
        "Rick: I'll tell you what I can't do. I can't sit in that room tomorrow and watch Dad marry that woman.",
        "Zende: I hear you.",
        "Steffy: Well, I'm certainly not gonna be there.",
        "Thomas: Well, if you're not going, then I'm not going.",
        "Steffy: All right.",
        "Thorne: Well, I'm not going alone.",
        "Rick: Sounds like we made a decision.",
        "Felicia: What? What have we decided?",
        "Ridge: The only thing that's left. Our only last, our best chance is an empty house. And hopefully Dad will see his mistake. We all agree? Okay. We're gonna boycott the wedding."
