        "Liam repeats what he said before. If he and Hope are the only ones that know she is pregnant, Wyatt doesn't have to find out. There would be no more ties to him after all they have been through. He says there is one thing she has to understand. If she has Wyatt's baby then it is the end of them. Hope says she wants to be with Liam but not like that. She's not okay with this and always wondering what might have been. After a moment of thought he says he understands. She will have that baby with Wyatt and have that incredible bond. But she can still be married to him and they can raise the baby together. She says she is grateful that he wants to make this sacrifice but she doesn't see them all raising this baby together. He says loving her, every part of her like he does, even raising another man's baby is not a sacrifice. She says again that it is and she can not let him do that. Caroline shows up at Wyatt's door and says she just heard everything about his mom in Paris. Wyatt tells her that Hope is probably with Liam now making some decisions. Quinn always thinks she is helping Wyatt but she causes more harm than good. She gives him a big old hug. She says things don't have to change. He's married to Hope. She says it might make for an awkward Thanksgiving but Hope is married to him ad she won't take that lightly. He says yes but had it just been fate that kept Liam from Hope that would be one thing. But his mother is a whole different story at least according to Hope. He says marriage is a sacrament to him but he doesn't want Hope to stay out of obligation. She says she is not playing favorites, but he and Hope will get through this.",
        "Bill shows up at Brooke's office and says he dropped everything when he got her text. She says this is not about them but their children. She admits she likes Wyatt and he's been a great husband but .after all Hope and Liam have been through she was sort of hoping that would work out. Bill leans in and says this will shock her but he is sort of feeling that way too. He can still interfere in things but not about this. If Hope wants Liam then he wants that for her too. It will be her decision. Brooke says then they know who that will be. Liam has always been the man. Quinn tells Ivy that she doesn't have to worry about Wyatt. He will not lose Hope over this. Hope loves Wyatt and they would have wound up with each other eventually. She just helped speed things along. Quinn debunks Ivy's suggestion that she is jealous because Ivy now has her old job. Quinn says no, she just needed a damsel in distress and it had nothing to do with Ivy Forrester. She's not obsessed, just a mother. And she actually did Ivy a favor. She gave her a shot at a guy she would have never had one with before. They both know she likes Liam. So Ivy got a little wet, big deal. Go put on a bikini, have a pool party and flaunt herself. She can't do all the work for her. Ivy says yes she was interested in Liam. And Quinn made it seem like he was available which he wasn't so bad for her for falling for that. Does it cause her pain \u0096 yes as she was falling for him. Right now he's with Hope trying to patch things up. It's what he wants. And now that he knows what Quinn did, she can't imagine anything else getting in their way. Hope tells Liam she is not sure this can work ..the way she grew up wondering why her parents weren't together, so confused why so many different men were in and out of her life with her mother. She told herself at a very early age she would never do that to her own child. She's not sure he really knows what he is volunteering for. It's too much. He says he is not pretending it will be easy but they don't have a choice. It is the only way. Again Hope stands her ground and says she can not do this to her baby or to him. This is just how it has to be. Hope says she has no choice. She is raising this baby with Wyatt. She refuses to become her mother. She dated two brothers and fell for both of them. The choices she made, they stop now! She is going to raise the baby with Wyatt. She is staying with the father. She is not sacrificing her own happiness. She thinks she can be happy with Wyatt and the baby. Liam says it is not the life she wanted. She says maybe not but what she wants is for the baby is what she didn't. He keeps saying that he can raise another man's baby. They have been someone else's puppet for so many years and Quinn doesn't have to get her way this time. She doesn't get to push people around. Hope says she knows but there is a higher force working here. So that is what she is going to do, raise her baby with her husband. She owes it to the baby to try. He asks if she is sure. They both have tears in their eyes. She says she will love him forever but after all they have had taken from then, they can not take away their memories. Slowly she walks out the door."

        "Liam: You haven't told Wyatt you're pregnant. We're the only ones who know right now.",
        "Hope: Right, but, Liam, what you're saying --",
        "Liam: But he -- he doesn't have to find out. I mean, I know this is -- this is hard to hear, but you wouldn't have any ties to him anymore, and after everything that we've been through, we could finally be together. Hope, there's just -- there's one thing you have to understand. If you have Wyatt's baby... it's the end of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: I just heard everything. Your mom? Paris? Oh, my God. Are you okay?",
        "Wyatt: Not exactly, no.",
        "Caroline: I'm sorry. I know what it feels like to lose somebody that you care about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I see you got my text.",
        "Bill: And I dropped everything. Is this what I'm hoping it is?",
        "Brooke: This isn't about us, Bill. This is about our children. Have you heard?",
        "Bill: Please don't tell me this is about Quinn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You don't have to worry about Wyatt. He's not gonna lose Hope over this.",
        "Ivy: Do you really think that?",
        "Quinn: Nothing's changed.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, the only reason Wyatt and Hope got married is because Liam didn't make it to the Eiffel Tower on time.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no. That's not true. Hope loves Wyatt. They would have ended up together eventually. I just helped speed things along. Excuse me.",
        "Ivy: Did it feel good?",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Ivy: Pushing me.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: I mean, we both know that there was an ulterior motive.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Ivy: Jealousy.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs]",
        "Ivy: Think about it. I have your job. I'm the one designing jewelry for Forrester Creations now. I'm working with your son.",
        "Quinn: Oh, see, I needed a damsel in distress. This had nothing to do with you, Ivy \"Forrester.\"",
        "Ivy: Wow. You really are obsessed, aren't you?",
        "Quinn: [Laughing] Obsessed? No. I'm a mother. I don't expect you to understand. You're not a mother.",
        "Ivy: No, but I do have a mother who cares about me and who doesn't push people into rivers for some warped sense that it might make me feel happy.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, maybe we're not reading the same parenting books. Have you -- have you said everything you came here to say? Because I got things to do.",
        "Ivy: Just don't ever come near me again, Quinn, because it wasn't just Hope, Wyatt, and Liam's life that you manipulated. It was mine, too.",
        "Quinn: And you're complaining? You should be thanking me.",
        "Ivy: Excuse me?",
        "Quinn: I did you a favor.",
        "Ivy: You pushed me off a bridge.",
        "Quinn: I gave you a shot with a guy you were never gonna have a shot with before. Come on. We both know that you like Liam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So you know.",
        "Bill: How Ivy ended up in the Seine? Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Quinn is totally nuts. Ivy could have her arrested.",
        "Bill: Half of Los Angeles could have her arrested. Hell, I want to have her arrested. But...",
        "Brooke: But she's Wyatt's mother.",
        "Bill: Yeah. I know. Poor kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I don't know if I'm losing her. I hope not.",
        "Caroline: She hasn't said anything?",
        "Wyatt: She's with Liam now. Or I assume she is. She's maybe making decisions or whatever. You know, my mom always thinks she's helping me, but she...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I can't do that. I can't. I can't do that. Liam, I-I want a life with you. I want the future that we always talked about. But not like that. I-I would always be wondering, you know, who he would have been, and -- and as hard as this is, and thinking about what it will do to us, it's just -- I'm -- I'm not okay with it. I'm not.",
        "Liam: I understand.",
        "Hope: You do?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Of course. So you'll have the baby with Wyatt, and you'll have that incredible bond. But you can still be married to me, Hope. We can raise the baby together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hope and Wyatt are married, which means you still have a chance with Liam. So what are you doing here, harassing me? Put on a bikini. Throw a pool party. Go flaunt yourself. I can't do all the work for you.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, you shouldn't have done anything at all. Your poor son is married because of it.",
        "Quinn: That's the point.",
        "Ivy: But it's only because of what you did -- what you did to me.",
        "Quinn: Oh, boohoo. You got a little wet.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Look, I-I meant -- I meant getting my hopes up about Liam. Yes, I'm interested in him, and yes, you made me feel like he was available, which he wasn't, and it's my fault for falling for him.",
        "Quinn: Babe, he's all yours.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Well, apparently not, because right now, he is with Hope trying to patch things up.",
        "Quinn: You -- you almost sound happy about that.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, because if it's what he wants...",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Quinn, does it cause me pain? Yeah, it does, because I was really starting to fall for him. Liam wants Hope. He always has. And now that he knows what you've done, and he has a reason to fight for her, I can't imagine why anything would get in their way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: When you think about it, it's not like anything has to change. Hope knew that Liam was in Paris.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but it's different, though. If fate had kept them apart, that's one thing, but because it was my mother, that's a different story. At least, it is to Hope.",
        "Caroline: All right, it'll make for an awkward Thanksgiving, yeah, but Hope married you. She's not gonna take that lightly.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I-I know she won't. But what does that mean if she stays? Is she staying because -- I don't know -- out of obligation? \"Marriage is a sacrament, and I have to honor it.\" Is that how I want my wife to think about being married to me?",
        "Caroline: Marriage is a sacrament, and yeah, there are gonna be days that you have to remind yourself that you made that promise. You know, like when you walk into the bathroom, and you see your husband's dirty laundry on the floor for the millionth time after you told him countless times that it's just super easy to just put it in the hamper. For example. You know, Hope is just probably having one of those moments right now, and that is okay. She married you. And I'm an equal-opportunities cousin here, so I am not playing favorites when I tell you this.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Caroline: You and Hope will get through this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Wyatt will need your support.",
        "Bill: Sounds like you've chosen a side.",
        "Brooke: Is that bad? I like Wyatt. He's been [Clears throat] wonderful for our daughter, and he would make an amazing husband. It's just that, after everything that Hope and Liam have been through, I can't help hoping...",
        "Bill: Well, I think it's safe to say this to you. I'm starting to hope for that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You really think that that's gonna work? The three of us are just going to raise this baby together? I appreciate you so much for -- for being willing to make this enormous sacrifice, but --",
        "Liam: Hope. Loving you -- loving every part of you, even a child that is not mine -- that is not a sacrifice.",
        "Hope: But it is. It is, and I can't let you do that.",
        "Liam: I-I need to. I-I need -- I need you.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] I don't know if it's gonna work. [Sighs] It's just -- Liam, you know how I grew up -- wondering why my parents weren't together -- so confused why -- why different men were always in and out of my life. And don't get me wrong. They were -- they were really good men. Ridge and Nick -- you know they helped raise me, and they were like father figures to me, but...they weren't my dad. And that's what I wanted. I wanted my dad. And so I told myself at a very early age that I was not gonna do that. I was not going to do what my mom did to me. I can't do it to the baby, and I don't want to do it to you. Liam, think about it. Y-you're -- you're asking to -- to raise this baby -- both you and Wyatt and me -- and I don't think you really understand what it is you're volunteering for. It's so much.",
        "Liam: I'm not sitting here pretending it would be easy. But we'll find a way through it because...we don't have a choice. Hope.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] I don't want to damage a family that hasn't even started. I can't do what my mother did to me. I won't do it to this baby, and I won't do it to you. This is just how it has to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: You think Hope's with Liam?",
        "Wyatt: There was something she needed to do, and I doubt it was grocery shopping.",
        "Caroline: Are you texting her?",
        "Wyatt: I have to let her know we need more eggs.",
        "Caroline: What are you really gonna say?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. I'm not sure yet. \"Come home,\" maybe?",
        "Caroline: That works.",
        "Wyatt: Or \"I've never felt this way about anyone. I can't possibly lose you because of my mother\"?",
        "Caroline: That works, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I have no choice. I'm raising this baby with Wyatt. I refuse to become my mother.",
        "Liam: You are not your mother, Hope. You are nothing like her.",
        "Hope: I'm dating two brothers. I fell for both of you. These choices that I am making -- they stop. They stop now. I'm -- I'm going to raise this child with Wyatt. I'm staying with the father.",
        "Liam: Please don't say that.",
        "Hope: I'm not just doing it for the baby. I'm doing it for you, too.",
        "Liam: How can you possibly think that's true?",
        "Hope: Because if we tried --",
        "Liam: If. Hope, if we're gonna be happy, we have to.",
        "Hope: I can't put you through that. It's not fair. It's not right.",
        "Liam: So you sacrifice your own happiness instead?",
        "Hope: No. No, I-I think that I could have a good life with Wyatt and our baby.",
        "Liam: But not the life you wanted.",
        "Hope: What I want...is for this child to have what I didn't. [Voice breaking] And I want better for you, too.",
        "Liam: Better than you?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Liam: Better than you?",
        "Hope: Better than -- than raising another man's baby -- your brother's.",
        "Liam: I can do it. I will do it. I'll do it.",
        "Hope: I would never ask you to do that. You know that.",
        "Liam: You don't need to ask me. Hope, we have been someone else's puppets over and over again over the years, and no more. Quinn doesn't get to win this time. She doesn't get to push people around!",
        "Hope: I know. I hate that she's getting what she wants, but, Liam, there is a-a higher force at work here. So that's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to raise my child with my husband.",
        "Liam: No. No.",
        "Hope: I owe it to the baby to try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: No text back yet?",
        "Wyatt: Not surprised. I mean, I tend to turn my phone off when I'm breaking someone's heart...or reuniting.",
        "Caroline: Either way, you are gonna be fine.",
        "Wyatt: Do you know I was at Liam's the other day? Trying to convince him to move out of that house.",
        "Caroline: Why?",
        "Wyatt: 'Cause it's bigger than this one. I thought we could swap. He's a single guy. Maybe he might prefer living right here down by the beach, and I'm married. I'm thinking about starting a family, and -- and now I don't know. Or even if I have a marriage or that life, that family that I imagined -- if it's gonna be Liam's -- or even if my wife is coming back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Does this mean no more interfering from a certain Dollar Bill?",
        "Bill: Oh, are you kidding me? I'm gonna be interfering in all kinds of things.",
        "Brooke: Mm.",
        "Bill: But not this. Listen, after everything that Liam has been through, if Hope is what he wants, then I believe he deserves her. But I'm leaving that decision up to Hope.",
        "Brooke: Wow. I'm impressed.",
        "Bill: Impressed enough to kiss me?",
        "Brooke: Oh, I knew you didn't mean it.",
        "Bill: Actually, I do mean it, kiss or no kiss. I am -- I am through being the meddling parent. I will abide by whatever decision Hope makes.",
        "Brooke: And we all know who that's gonna be. I mean, Wyatt's been great for her. He's been a lot of fun, and it's good for her to explore her options, but Liam has always been the man for Hope. I'm sure there's nothing that's going to stop her from going back to Liam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Voice breaking] Are you really saying...",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Liam: [Crying] And you're sure?",
        "Hope: [Sniffles] I will love you forever. All of the things that have been taken from us -- they never took our memories.",
        "Male singer: When we started our story, who knew where it would go? The chapters move so quickly you loved me, or so you told me but something happened, and the plot turned cold the pages stopped turning, and now we're on hold but if I can turn back the hands of time I would change so much more than history tonight if you could grant me a second chance I'd be the boy that you once knew and I swear that you'd say, \"I do\"",
