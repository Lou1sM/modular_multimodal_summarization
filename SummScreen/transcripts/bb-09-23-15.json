    "Recap": [
        "Looking rather forlorn, Ridge sits in his office looking at many photos of Caroline when Brooke walks in. He tells her before she starts that no he did not tell Caroline yet. She was so happy last night, and he too is trying to wrap his head around this. It is going to be a process for both of them. He informs Brooke there is no way he could have been misdiagnosed as they ran the tests twice. He tells her there is no medication, nothing they can do. He wanted this for Caroline. Brooke says she is sorry, she knows how much he wanted this. Caroline is sketching in the same room with Thomas and he likes seeing her exuberance like this over one of his designs. She jokes they need to find a girl for him. He says he does not think he is up for a relationship right now but he did kiss Nicole the other day. She's gorgeous and a fun girl but she was getting a little too close and asking a few too many questions about him and Caroline so he kissed her. Caroline is going to have a baby with his dad and nothing is going to come in the way of that. She is stunned that he would protect her like that. She says no one will know this, especially his father. Thomas promises this is just between the two of them and will go no further. Nicole is talking with Zende and says again the Thomas kiss was nothing serious but Zende seems to think so. She wonders why he never tried to kiss her if he is this interested. He says he does have that urge but he thought he should take it slow and be respectful. She says Thomas is a very successful and handsome Forrester but he is not the Forrester that she is into. Zende jokes that aha, it's grandpa, he gets all the girls and he's such a player. She lets him know that he is the only guy on her radar and she does not know why she has to tell him that. He says he is not mad, just disappointed. They aren't even dating yet. She picks up on the word yet and says there is still hope yet. And she will shout his name to the rooftops if he will believe her. There is no one else she had rather spend her time with. And she is not smooth talking him or playing games. As he gets up to leave a folder with tickets falls on the floor and she asks if those are for the two of them. He first says it is for his cousin but she does not believe him. Pam has Charlie taste a piece of her cake and give her his honest opinion. She is still bummed that she came in 5th out of only 5 contestants. He jokes that maybe he can cheer her up if they play Contessa and the cabana boy. They come out looking for Nicole and Zende and let the cat out of the bag. They ask if he has given her the tickets. She says she saw it was for a rock concert of one of her favorite bands ..and yes she'd love to go. Charlie says no problem, he works as security at The Bowl and was happy to get the tickets. He thinks they will have a grand time. Zende gets up the courage to give Nicole a little peck on the lips. And a second time when she gives her approval.",
        "Ridge tells Brooke that she was right when she said to explain to Caroline and work this out. He didn't and now what does he do. Brooke says this is his responsibility and he has to talk to her now. There are other methods of having a baby. He says not for Caroline. She wants his baby and he pretty much guaranteed that for her. Brooke laments this does not have to ruin his marriage but it will affect their relationship if he does not tell her as soon as he can. She's young and healthy and if she does not get pregnant very soon she will start figuring things out. Ridge barks that he appreciates her concern but right now he wants her to lay off of him. Caroline walks in and is concerned at what she just heard. She remarks that it seem awfully tense in here. Brooke starts to leave and says they just had a difference of opinion but it always helps to tell the truth. She tells Thomas that he does not have to rush the designs as she does not think Caroline will be going on maternity leave any time soon, there are no guarantees. Life is always full of surprises. Caroline tells Ridge that she wishes he would look at her. She feels their commitment and hopes they will have a baby but she realizes there is no guarantee it will happen right away. Slowly he tells her when she called he was at the doctor's office. She barges in and says she knows and she is so grateful that he changed his mind and wants to have a baby with her. He is giving her everything she ever wanted. She wraps herself in his arms."

        "Brooke: Hey.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Before you even start, no, I didn't tell Caroline. I got home last night, and she was just so happy, you know, and -- and I'm trying to wrap my head around this thing. It's -- it's a process for both of us.",
        "Brooke: And you're positive there's no way you could have been misdiagnosed?",
        "Ridge: We ran the test twice. Same result.",
        "Brooke: Are you sure there's no other kind of medication? Or maybe there's other options, some kind of procedure.",
        "Ridge: No, there's not. There's -- no! There's nothing I can do.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry, Ridge. I know how much you wanted this.",
        "Ridge: I wanted this for Caroline. This is... the one thing she wanted in her life. And I can't give it to her. I can't make her a mother. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: What do you think?",
        "Caroline: It's not bad.",
        "Thomas: Really? Really? That's all you got -- \"not bad\"?",
        "Caroline: Oh, I'm sorry. It's excellent! It's stupendous! It's amazing!",
        "Thomas: Yes. Yes. Tell me more. Tell me more.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs]",
        "Thomas: You know, it's nice to see you like this.",
        "Caroline: It's no secret why. Now we just got to find you a good girl.",
        "Thomas: Ooh, yeah. I don't really think that I'm up for a relationship right now. But, hey, something did happen the other day.",
        "Caroline: With who?",
        "Thomas: No, it's -- it's nothing.",
        "Caroline: Spill!",
        "Thomas: All right, fine. I kissed Nicole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Uh-oh. I know that look.",
        "Zende: Thomas just laid one on you right there, just right on those beautiful lips?",
        "Nicole: It really didn't mean anything, Zende. He just got caught up in the moment.",
        "Zende: Yeah. Well... I can't say I blame him.",
        "Nicole: How come you've never had the urge?",
        "Zende: What, to kiss you? I do, every time I look at you. But, you know, I wanted to be respectful and take it slow.",
        "Nicole: Well, like I said, that kiss wasn't even about me. It was about someone else.",
        "Zende: Okay. Then why didn't he kiss her, then?",
        "Nicole: Look, Thomas is a great guy. He is a handsome and successful Forrester. But he's not the Forrester I'm into.",
        "Zende: Got your eye on a Forrester, huh?",
        "Nicole: Yep. Sure do.",
        "Zende: Do you have a thing for my grandfather?",
        "Nicole: Oh. You know, Eric is a very charming and distinguished gentleman. He's not bad-looking, either.",
        "Zende: I knew it! Grandpa gets all the ladies, man. He's such a player.",
        "Nicole: Are you gonna let me off the hook now?",
        "Zende: Do I wish the kiss never happened? Do I wish it was me instead of Thomas? Yeah. Of course. I'm not gonna lie.",
        "Nicole: Well, just because someone else kissed me doesn't mean you never can. Look, you've got to know how I feel about you. There is no other guy on my radar, Zende. What do I have to do to get you to believe that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: So, wait. Were you and Nicole on a date? Did you take her out?",
        "Thomas: No, no. It was...here at the office.",
        "Caroline: So, what prompted this little love fest?",
        "Thomas: Well, Nicole's a fun girl -- interesting, gorgeous.",
        "Caroline: Well, yeah. Duh.",
        "Thomas: I don't know. We were talking. I just kind of acted on impulse.",
        "Caroline: I thought that she was into Zende.",
        "Thomas: She is.",
        "Caroline: So...",
        "Thomas: Okay. So, I didn't just kiss her, because she's attractive. She was getting really curious about you and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Maybe it's worth getting a second opinion.",
        "Ridge: What's the point of that? He's the best urologist in town. And what's another guy gonna tell me? The same thing -- that my sperm isn't viable.",
        "Brooke: Which makes a vasectomy reversal pointless.",
        "Ridge: Got to get used to that, huh? It's impossible for me to get a woman pregnant.",
        "Brooke: Ridge... if you both really want to be parents, there are other ways.",
        "Ridge: That's not the point. That's not what she wants. She wants to have a kid with me, with her husband. And I pretty much guaranteed that.",
        "Brooke: You assumed it wouldn't be a problem.",
        "Ridge: Well, it is a problem. What do I do now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Pammy, come on. The cake was fabulous! It was -- it was -- it was sensational!",
        "Pam: Are you sure it wasn't a little...chalky?",
        "Charlie: Pam, enough. You can't -- you can't win every bake-off you enter.",
        "Pam: Oh, not now, Charlie. I-I can't talk about it. It's still too painful.",
        "Charlie: All right. All right. Look at it this way -- you did finish 5th.",
        "Pam: There were only five people in it.",
        "Charlie: Pammy, how can Uncle Charlie cheer you up, huh? Hey, you want to play the Contessa and the cabana boy?",
        "Pam: Oh. [Chuckles]",
        "Charlie: How 'bout if we take Zende's tickets, and we go to the concert, then?",
        "Pam: [Laughing] Oh, Charlie, we can't do that. He's so excited about taking Nicole. And she has no idea. I think it's so cute that he wants to surprise her.",
        "Charlie: You know, he's a good kid. I like having him around.",
        "Pam: He couldn't be sweeter. I think that Kristen and Tony did a great job raising that kid.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Pam: Nicole's found herself a real keeper.",
        "Charlie: Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: You don't owe me anything, Nicole. You don't have to give me an explanation.",
        "Nicole: But I don't want you being mad at me.",
        "Zende: I'm not, okay? Promise.",
        "Nicole: Well, you're disappointed.",
        "Zende: Not in you.",
        "Nicole: In the situation?",
        "Zende: We aren't exclusive. We haven't even had that talk. I haven't even taken you on a date yet.",
        "Nicole: Yet? You said, \"yet,\" which means that I haven't totally screwed things up, and you might still like me after all.",
        "Zende: The key word is \"might.\"",
        "Nicole: I wish there was some way to prove to you how much I like you.",
        "Zende: Listen, Nicole, you don't have to --",
        "Nicole: I know I don't have to. But I want to... because I want you to trust me when I tell you how I feel. I'm not just smooth-talking you, Zende. I'm not playing games. There is no one else I would rather spend my time with than you.",
        "Zende: You mean that?",
        "Nicole: I'll shout it from the rooftop...right here. I will yell it so loud, they will hear me in Santa Monica.",
        "Zende: Okay.",
        "Nicole: I will. I'll do it.",
        "Zende: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nicole: The whole city will know your name.",
        "Zende: Great. Go for it.",
        "Nicole: All right. Wait. What is that?",
        "Zende: Uh, no. Unh-unh. Y-you're not getting out of this one.",
        "Nicole: Are those tickets?",
        "Zende: What?",
        "Nicole: Are those tickets for us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I'm talking way too much. I-I-I've got to finish this.",
        "Caroline: You know what? Back to what you said before -- Nicole being curious about me. In what way?",
        "Thomas: She was just assuming things, asking a lot of questions.",
        "Caroline: She doesn't know about...",
        "Thomas: No, no, no, no, no. She doesn't know anything about that.",
        "Caroline: Okay. Well, then, what?",
        "Thomas: Well, she knows that you and I dated back in the day.",
        "Caroline: Everyone knows about that.",
        "Thomas: She could tell that I just -- I've been distracted lately. I've really been burying myself in my work, and she thought it might have something to do with you. She was trying to be supportive, you know -- being a shoulder to lean on. It was nice. She was really -- really sweet about it. But I don't know. I just -- I felt uneasy about the whole situation, so I changed the subject.",
        "Caroline: By kissing her?",
        "Thomas: I had a nice moment with a lovely woman and also managed to sidetrack the conversation.",
        "Caroline: You did that to protect me.",
        "Thomas: You and Dad are finally in a great place. You're exactly where you want to be. You're about to start a family, and... I'm not gonna let anything get in the way of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You're right. You told me to talk to her about the vasectomy, and I didn't do it. I didn't listen to you. Here we are. How do I explain this?",
        "Brooke: Just talk to her.",
        "Ridge: It's not that simple.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, what other choice do you have?! It's not my place. This is your responsibility. You need to be honest with Caroline. You have to talk to your wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Zende Dominguez Forrester, are you taking me to a concert?",
        "Zende: Oh, the tickets. No. I'm -- I'm taking my cousin.",
        "Nicole: Really?",
        "Zende: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: Which one?",
        "Zende: You don't know him yet.",
        "Nicole: Hmm. I'm pretty sure I've met your entire family.",
        "Zende: Well, actually, it's a cousin on my dad's side. He's a Dominguez, so you wouldn't have --",
        "Nicole: Yeah, but you said they live in Florida. And it's funny, because I remember telling you that I like that band.",
        "Zende: Really? You know, I don't remember you ever saying that.",
        "Nicole: Don't even play. Please. I know those tickets are for us, and, yes, thank you, I would love to go.",
        "Zende: Okay. Now, hold on a second. I don't think that --",
        "Charlie: Oh, there they are!",
        "Pam: We have been looking all over for you two.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. You know, my supersleuth senses should have told me you'd be up here, but...",
        "Pam: So? Have you told her yet?",
        "Charlie: Did you, uh, give her the tickets?",
        "Nicole: I just saw them.",
        "Pam: Oh. [Chuckles]",
        "Charlie: I bet you're wondering how Zende scored those bad boys.",
        "Pam: Charlie's got an in at the Hollywood Bowl.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. I work security -- groupie containment. It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it.",
        "Pam: Have you ever been to the Bowl?",
        "Nicole: No, but I am so looking forward to it.",
        "Pam: Nicole, you are going to love it. It's this open-air amphitheater right there in the Hollywood Hills, open to the night sky.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. It's gonna be a real treat.",
        "Nicole: No doubt it will be.",
        "Pam: I'm just so relieved this whole thing has come together. I mean, it's been in the works for, what, a couple of weeks now?",
        "Nicole: Really? A couple weeks?",
        "Charlie: Well, Zende wanted it to be a big surprise.",
        "Pam: Yeah. He's been so excited to tell you.",
        "Nicole: Yeah. I can see that.",
        "Pam: You and I can put together a picnic basket for the show -- you know, make it really special.",
        "Nicole: Yeah.",
        "Pam: You are gonna have such a blast.",
        "Charlie: And if you two need anything else, you give us a call, all right?",
        "Nicole: All right.",
        "Charlie: All right. Later.",
        "Pam: [Speaking indistinctly]",
        "Nicole: Wow. That was enlightening.",
        "Zende: Okay, fine. The tickets -- they're for us.",
        "Nicole: Yes! See? I knew it. I knew it as soon as I saw them they were for us.",
        "Zende: Everything Pam and Charlie said is true. I've been -- I've been wanting to ask you out for a while. And I wanted to do something special. I figured the concert would be a perfect first date.",
        "Nicole: So, does this mean all is forgiven?",
        "Zende: I guess it's not your fault some guy wanted to kiss you. It's my fault for not doing it sooner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Hey, I know that I don't need to say this, but... about that night we had together --",
        "Thomas: No, hey. I get it. Nobody can ever know.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, especially not your father, because it would destroy him.",
        "Thomas: Trust me -- this stays between us.",
        "Caroline: Good. Good. Yeah. Um... I know that you would never say anything. Okay. I'm -- I'm gonna -- I'm gonna go show your dad what we've come up with so far, and, uh, hey...",
        "Thomas: Hmm?",
        "Caroline: ...Nicole's right. Don't bury yourself too much in work, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: This doesn't have to ruin your marriage.",
        "Ridge: Well, it's a big deal. I wasn't being honest with her.",
        "Brooke: Just tell Caroline the truth -- you thought it would be a non-issue. But now it's a problem, and it affects her directly. She needs to know about it.",
        "Ridge: It's all just still sinking in. I don't know how to handle it.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, there's nothing to handle. You just have to tell her the truth. She's gonna want to start trying for a family right away.",
        "Ridge: Not right away, no.",
        "Brooke: Yes, right away. She's young. She's healthy. There's no medical issues. If she doesn't get pregnant really soon, she's gonna start figuring something out.",
        "Ridge: You don't think I know that?! I appreciate your help, I appreciate your concern, but what I want right now is for you to lay off me.",
        "Caroline: Is everything okay in here? 'Cause it just seems kind of tense.",
        "Brooke: Sometimes Ridge and I disagree on how to go about things -- what the best course of action might be.",
        "Caroline: I'm sure you two will figure it out.",
        "Brooke: I hope so.",
        "Caroline: Sometimes the answer is just right in front of you. It's kind of obvious.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, that's true! True. It's best to be honest. The sooner, the better.",
        "Caroline: Hey, uh, thank you, by the way, for the wedding gift. That was really sweet.",
        "Brooke: Oh, it was my pleasure.",
        "Caroline: That was odd. Did you two get into it or something?",
        "Ridge: You know Brooke. She always thinks she knows what's right.",
        "Caroline: Well, you guys were together for a really long time, so I'd say she's got you pretty well pegged.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: Uh, I wanted to show you something Thomas and I were working on. I think we're making pretty good headway for the collection here.",
        "Ridge: Great.",
        "Caroline: You okay?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. I'm fine.",
        "Caroline: Hey, Ridge. Baby, please look at me. Whatever's going on, you can tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: It just got really hot out here.",
        "Zende: I'm definitely feeling it.",
        "Nicole: That was, um... I've been waiting for that.",
        "Zende: You have no idea.",
        "Nicole: It was even better than I imagined.",
        "Zende: Mm. You imagined?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, maybe once or twice.",
        "Zende: Yeah, me too -- once or twice.",
        "Nicole: And you know you're welcome to do it again...",
        "Zende: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: ...Like, anytime.",
        "Zende: Really? Yeah? Yeah?",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: We're, uh -- we're trying to wrap up the spring line here.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. I wouldn't be too concerned. You've got plenty of time.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, but it can't hurt to stay ahead of the game, especially if Caroline goes on maternity leave.",
        "Brooke: I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, maybe not, but they're about to start trying. What's that? Do you still not think them having a baby is a good idea?",
        "Brooke: No. I just don't think that we should assume there's a child in Ridge and Caroline's future. There are no guarantees. Life is full of surprises.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Okay. I think I know what this is about. Yesterday I talked to you, and you said you were planning our future, and then the last time that you kept a secret from me, we ended up getting married, so I can only imagine what this one is about. And you don't have to tell me 'cause you don't want to spoil the surprise, but I do want you to feel comfortable opening up to me... because we made the ultimate commitment, Ridge, and it's only gonna get stronger when we have a baby and we start a family. I-I know that it's -- nothing is guaranteed, and it might not happen right away, but I-I do feel very hopeful about our future. I-I believe in what we're building, and I think that you do, too.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] When you called, I was at the doctor's office.",
        "Caroline: Were you, like, getting a physical or something? Please don't tell me that you're going into the whole \"you're afraid that you're not gonna be around for our child.\"",
        "Ridge: No, it's nothing like that.",
        "Caroline: Good, because that's ridiculous, because you're not that much older than me.",
        "Ridge: When we first started talking about having kids, and I told you I didn't really want to do that, and you got upset and you left and went to the hotel --",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I don't want to talk about that.",
        "Ridge: Well, I-I told you that I-I couldn't give you a child, that I couldn't give you the family you deserve.",
        "Caroline: I know, and then -- then we said that we were gonna do that, that that'll change, and, you know, not -- not right away, but within a year, and that was our understanding. And I'm really, really, really thankful that you're giving me everything that I could have ever dreamed of, because I love you, Ridge. And I can't wait to start a family with you."
