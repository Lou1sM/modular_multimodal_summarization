        "Liam relives the moment when Hope tells him she is pregnant. Then he realizes that Bill is hollering at him from the front door. Bill says he just saw Brooke and she is pretty confident he and Hope are going to get back together. Hope arrives home. Wyatt seems surprised that she came home. She asks if he has been waiting. He says not all night. He hasn't been texting, he hasn't been calling her but he has worn a groove in the floor over there. She says she is sorry she left. She should not have done that. He says no, he understood. She was overwhelmed by what his mother did following Liam to Paris and pushing Ivy into the Seine, a whole new kind of crazy. She says she went to Liam's. He says he figured that out but now she is here. He asks if it is very good news or is she here to get her stuff. At Forrester, Ivy asks Aly how does she think Hope will re-act. Aly says they all thought it was an accident but when Hope finds out Quinn pushed her, she will not go back to Wyatt. She knows she likes Liam and this is not what she wants to hear. But Hope and Liam have a history. Ivy says but Hope and Wyatt made a commitment. Aly says yes but under false pretenses so it doesn't count. Ivy says it's okay; she knew what she was getting into. Hope is a Logan so maybe it's true what they say. They can have any man they want and then just never let go. Liam tells Bill that Hope left and she is not coming back. And it's too late for her to come back. He says they have been married for a while now even though it is built on a lie but they have moved on. He agonizes that he really thought they could turn back the clock but he was wrong. Wyatt tells Hope before she says any more, he needs to tell her something. He locks the door. He says when she left his mother showed up. And he told her if Hope did not come back that he would blame Quinn. It was very upsetting to her but right in the middle she said something that actually made sense. He says what she did was disgusting and despicable but that doesn't change how they felt when they said their vows and all the amazing days they have had since then. He says Hope did not marry him because Liam did not show up on time. That is not how she makes decisions. They are together for a reason and it has nothing to do with his mother or Liam. Whatever manipulations she and Liam had in the past, she chose a future now with him. She says he has to admit what his mom did was wrong. He says yes, of course but they aren't wrong. He asks if he has ever made her unhappy and she says no; also no to not making her satisfied as a husband. He says he promises he never will either. She says he also has to promise that nothing like this will ever happen again. She realizes she put herself in this by dating two brothers and then accepting the diamond from Wyatt and then Liam's ultimatum but it can not be like that any more. He says he doesn't have to know what's in their future. He just knows that he wants to share it with her. That is what a leap of faith is. Aly wants Ivy to call Liam and when she doesn't then Aly calls him. She hears just enough to know that Hope is not there and she has returned to Wyatt and the marriage. Ivy says as bad as she feels for Liam she is glad that Hope is sticking to her commitment. Maybe knowing what Quinn did didn't matter as much as they thought it would. Bill tells Liam that he is sorry. Liam says he doesn't have to pretend this is so bad. Bill says if it hurts Liam then it hurts him too. And Wyatt can't be happy with his mother's behavior just like they rest of them he is disgusted by her. Liam chuckles when Bill says she will never mess with him again. Liam says that is because there is nothing left for her to do. Any chance he had with Hope was gone long before Charlie showed him that video.",
        "Bill asks Liam what is next. Liam says focus on work, go rock climbing, skydiving whatever it is that keeps Bill's mind off of Brooke. Bill quips drinking. Liam says no not that. He really thought what was fair and right would win out in the end. Now he isn't sure what to believe. Bill gives him a big hug. Wyatt tells Hope that he loves her and he believes in them and wants kids and a family and a partnership as successful as Eric and Stephanie's. That is everything; their life now. She says he knows that she has always been a planner. He says fine, make a list. They can slow down. Just get away from his mother and Liam, just the two of them on some adventure. She knows what his mother did and how Liam feels but he needs to know where she stands. Aly tells Ivy that Liam is heartbroken. She can hear it in his voice. Ivy needs to go be with him. Ivy says she will be there for him again if he needs her but she doesn't want him to think that she wants something from him. Aly says Ivy is his friend so it wouldn't be like that. Ivy says if Hope will let him go for good, then she will listen to him just like she did on their ride back from Paris. He's such a wonderful guy. He deserves to be happy. And he will be once he has worked through this and realizes there is life after Hope. Wyatt says perhaps they should just not think about it .no more promises or vows. They will just figure it out and go for it. She says he is so confident and that is what life is going to be like with him, one surprise after another. He asks if that is such a bad thing. He asks if she is staying and she says yes. He grabs her and kisses her. She says she loves him. He's her husband and she is committed to this marriage, their future, their family. This is where she needs to be. He says good, someday they will have a family all of their own. She agrees, yes they will."

        "Hope: I'm sorry. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry that I'm putting you through this.",
        "Liam: It's okay. Whatever it is, you can tell me. It'll be all right.",
        "Hope: I'm pregnant.",
        "Bill: Liam? Liam!",
        "Liam: Out here.",
        "Bill: Would you answer me when I call you?",
        "Liam: I just did.",
        "Bill: Talk to hope?",
        "Liam: I did.",
        "Bill: You tell her about Quinn?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Bill: And? I just saw Brooke. She, uh... she's pretty confident you guys are gonna get back together.",
        "Liam: Yeah, so was I.",
        "Bill: Was? What -- where's hope?",
        "Liam: Not here.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] You came back.",
        "Hope: Have you been waiting?",
        "Wyatt: Not the whole time. I've also been not calling you, not texting you, and pacing a groove in the floor over there.",
        "Hope: I'm really sorry that I left. I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Wyatt: No. No, you were overwhelmed. What my mother did, following Liam to paris and pushing Ivy into the seine, it's a -- it's a whole new brand of crazy.",
        "Hope: I went to Liam's.",
        "Wyatt: I figured. But now you're here. That's either very good news or...you're here to... get your stuff.",
        "Ivy: How do you think hope will react?",
        "Aly: Everyone thought your fall into the seine was an accident. When hope finds out you were pushed, she will be furious.",
        "Ivy: Furious enough to leave Wyatt and go back to Liam?",
        "Aly: I know this isn't what you want to hear... but I think she will. It's their history, Ivy. Hope and Wyatt just don't have a deep connection like that.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt is not a consolation prize. Hope has real feelings for him.",
        "Aly: But they can't compare to what she has with Liam.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] She married Wyatt. She made a commitment.",
        "Aly: Yeah, under false pretenses. It doesn't count.",
        "Aly: Oh, you sound just like Liam.",
        "Aly: I'm sorry, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Don't be. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. Well, I should have. Hope is a Logan. Maybe it's true what people say about them -- they can have any man they want, and then they just never let go.",
        "Liam: Hope left, dad. She's -- she's not coming back.",
        "Bill: Where did she go?",
        "Liam: Where do you think?",
        "Bill: Back to Wyatt. She's not leaving him.",
        "Liam: No, it's, uh... [Chuckles] It's too late for that.",
        "Bill: Because they're married.",
        "Liam: They've been married for a while, you know? They've been making plans, building a life together. Building it on a lie, but... but they've moved on. And, God, I-I thought hope and I could turn back the clock. I really did. And I was wrong.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, before you say anything, I need to be honest with you about something.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: My mother showed up after you left.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] What did you tell her?",
        "Wyatt: That if you didn't come back I'd blame her.",
        "Hope: That must have been very upsetting for her.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, it was. But right in the middle of all her excuses, she actually said something that made sense. Look, what she did was despicable and dangerous and just disgusting. But that doesn't change how we felt when we made our vows, and all the amazing days that we've had since then. Hope, you didn't marry me because Liam didn't show up on time. That's not you. That's not how you make decisions. We are together for a reason. And it has nothing to do with my mother or Liam.",
        "Ivy: I won't be mad at hope if she decides to take Liam back.",
        "Aly: Well, I guess that's good, because I think she will. You should check on him.",
        "Ivy: No, I-I can't. I...",
        "Aly: Okay. Then I will.",
        "Ivy: Aly, don't. I just --",
        "Aly: Look, if he doesn't want to talk, he won't answer.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bill: Don't answer that. We're in the middle of this, Liam.",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Liam: Hey, Aly. Oh, it's you. I-I thought I'd get your voicemail.",
        "Liam: Ivy told you about Quinn?",
        "Aly: Yeah. I can't believe it.",
        "Bill: Tell her to call back later.",
        "Aly: Is that your dad?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, we're kind of in the middle of something.",
        "Aly: Is hope there, too?",
        "Liam: No, she left.",
        "Aly: Back to Wyatt's.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't call her right now, though.",
        "Aly: Oh, wow. So... she's ending the marriage.",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Aly: Wait, she's not?",
        "Liam: Um, listen, Aly, I-I got to -- I got to -- I got to call you back. I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Aly: Yeah, yeah. Okay, I understand. Bye.",
        "Ivy: What? What -- what happened?",
        "Aly: Nothing. He told hope what Quinn did and it didn't change anything.",
        "Wyatt: Liam wants to blame my mom for all this. He believes that everything that happened is a mistake.",
        "Hope: Well, I can't see it that way.",
        "Wyatt: Neither can I.",
        "Hope: But we were manipulated.",
        "Wyatt: I know. And that brought up a lot of old stuff for you and Liam, that -- that you'd be together if only...whatever. But I don't believe that, hope. Whatever you and Liam had in the past, you chose a future with me.",
        "Hope: I did, but you have to admit that what your mom did was wrong.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, it was. But we're not. I mean... have I made you unhappy?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Wyatt: Dissatisfied you as a husband?",
        "Hope: No. Not at all.",
        "Wyatt: And I promise you, I never will.",
        "Hope: And promise that nothing like this will ever, ever happen again?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: I'm serious, Wyatt. It's got to stop. Your mother's involvement with everything, this tug-of-war between you and Liam --",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Hope: Don't get me wrong, I realize that I put myself in the middle of it. I know I did. By dating both of you, accepting the diamond from you, giving Liam the ultimatum. But it cannot be like that anymore.",
        "Wyatt: All of that changed when you married me.",
        "Hope: Except it didn't. Because what your mom has -- has done --",
        "Wyatt: That doesn't change the facts of what happened.",
        "Hope: Yeah, exactly. Your -- your mom pushed Ivy off a bridge.",
        "Wyatt: But she didn't push you off the Stella Maris. She didn't make you stand up there and hold your hand out to me. You asked me to take a leap of faith with you and I did. And I'd do it again and again and again without a second of hesitation. Because that's what faith is. I don't need to know what's in our future to know that I want to share it with you.",
        "Ivy: So, how did he sound?",
        "Aly: He didn't want to talk about it.",
        "Ivy: But you're certain that hope isn't gonna leave Wyatt?",
        "Aly: That's what he said. Right after he told me not to call her.",
        "Ivy: Oh, Liam was certain this was his chance.",
        "Aly: I don't understand. Hope broke up with Wyatt the last time Quinn did something crazy like this.",
        "Ivy: But hope wasn't married to Wyatt then. Look, as bad as I feel for Liam, I kind of respect hope for sticking to her commitment.",
        "Aly: Yeah. Yeah, so would I. If she hadn't been tricked into it.",
        "Ivy: No, Aly, I don't think we can call this a trick.",
        "Aly: She was going to choose Liam. She was waiting for him and he was right there, Ivy. And if he showed her the video, she could see that. She could see Quinn knock you off the bridge. I mean, how does that not matter?",
        "Ivy: Well, maybe it just doesn't matter as much as we thought it would.",
        "Aly: It meant everything to Liam.",
        "Ivy: Did you say his dad was with him?",
        "Aly: Yeah, probably pouring salt in his wounds.",
        "Ivy: No, bill wouldn't do that.",
        "Aly: He never wanted Liam and hope together. He's probably telling Liam how lucky he is to finally have her out of his life once and for all.",
        "Bill: I'm sorry, son.",
        "Liam: You know, you don't have to pretend like this is bad news for me.",
        "Bill: Liam, if it hurts you, it hurts me.",
        "Liam: Even if it makes Wyatt happy?",
        "Bill: Wyatt isn't happy about... Wyatt isn't happy about the way it happened. He's disgusted by his mother's behavior just like we all are. She'll never mess with you again.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] That's 'cause there's nothing left for her to do. Nothing left for anyone to do. [Sighs] Any chance that hope and I had was gone before Pam and Charlie even showed me that video.",
        "Bill: So, what now?",
        "Liam: I focus on work. You teach me to skydive or rock-climb or however it is that you keep your mind off Brooke.",
        "Bill: You want a drink?",
        "Liam: No, not right now.",
        "Bill: Could call my boxing trainer.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] I've already had one gut punch today. No thanks.",
        "Bill: You know... you really didn't get hit with anything new. Hope and Wyatt were already married. Nothing's really changed.",
        "Liam: I know. I know. That's the thing. I thought it would. Well, when the truth came out, I really... I really believed that what's right and fair and good would win out in the end, and now I... I don't know what to believe.",
        "Wyatt: There's no going back for me, hope.",
        "Hope: What your mother did doesn't make you question anything?",
        "Wyatt: She made a bad choice. You didn't.",
        "Hope: But we didn't have all the facts.",
        "Wyatt: I love you. That is a fact. I want a life with you, and kids, and a partnership as successful as Eric and Stephanie's.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Oh, is that all?",
        "Wyatt: That is everything. That is my life now. Us. Everything that we can experience and -- and all the things that we can create. The incredible, unexpected adventures and journeys and... what?",
        "Hope: It's...nothing. You just -- you know I've always been a-a planner.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Okay, so let's plan. Let's make a list. What's first?",
        "Hope: You know, I feel like we're already getting ahead of ourselves.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, okay. Then we'll slow down. We'll slow down. We'll... we'll get away, you know? Away from my mother and Liam. Just us. You and me. The two of us. Just say the word. Tell me what you want. You know what my mother did. You know how Liam feels. I need to know where you stand. What do you want to do?",
        "Aly: You need to go over there. Liam will need somebody to talk to.",
        "Ivy: Well, he's with his father.",
        "Aly: At least call him. Don't you want to?",
        "Ivy: Yes.",
        "Aly: You were there for him before.",
        "Ivy: And if he needs me there again, then I will be.",
        "Aly: Ivy, he's heartbroken. I-I could hear it in his voice.",
        "Ivy: Liam thought that that video of Quinn was a lifeline, like it was going to solve all of his and hope's problems.",
        "Aly: You see? You understand what he's going through.",
        "Ivy: I don't want him to think that I want something.",
        "Aly: You're his friend.",
        "Ivy: No, we got closer than that. We did. And then Wyatt had this idea about the house, and then Charlie and Pam drop this bombshell about Quinn.",
        "Aly: And Liam went back to hope.",
        "Ivy: He wasn't ready to let go of her. But now -- now maybe he can, if hope is willing to let him get on with his life.",
        "Aly: It sounds like she is.",
        "Ivy: Look, I won't push him. I'll just -- I'll listen, just like I did on the plane back from paris. [Sighs] I hate that he's going through this again. He's just such a wonderful guy. He deserves to be happy. And he will be. He will be once he works through this and he can see that there is life after hope.",
        "Hope: I will love you forever.",
        "Wyatt: I want to put this behind us -- what my mother did, Liam's reaction, your doubt.",
        "Hope: Not doubt.",
        "Wyatt: Uncertainty, then.",
        "Hope: Not about you.",
        "Wyatt: But there's something.",
        "Hope: It's not anything that we need to get into tonight.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Okay, so, where do we go from here?",
        "Hope: I don't know. I don't know. This is all such new territory for me.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, well, how about this -- let's just not think about it. Let's not think about it. Like our wedding day. No more promises, no more vows. Let's just go for it. We'll figure it out.",
        "Hope: How do you do that?",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Hope: How are you always so confident about things?",
        "Wyatt: Well, that look's not making me feel particularly confident.",
        "Hope: Sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Wyatt: No, it's... I'm sorry. I-I... probably scared you. All this talk about a house and the kids. And then you get this revelation about my mother. I'm sure your head's spinning right now.",
        "Hope: A little bit. But you know what? That's what you do to me. And that's what life is going to be like with you. It's just one surprise after another.",
        "Wyatt: And that's such a bad thing? Wait. And that's what -- that's what life is going to be like with me? Are you staying?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Yes? Yes.",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: You are my husband. And I love you. And I'm committed to this marriage and our future and our family.",
        "Wyatt: I wasn't sure if that was what you wanted. If you were there yet or not.",
        "Hope: I am. This is where I need to be.",
        "Wyatt: I'll make you so happy, hope. We're gonna have an amazing life together. And someday... maybe a family of our own.",
        "Hope: Yes, we will."
