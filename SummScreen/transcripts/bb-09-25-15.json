    "Recap": [
        "Caroline tells her doctor that she can not leave here today until she knows who the father is. There must be some test. Ridge also tells Brooke that he's had tests and he could have a thousand more and it will not change things. Brooke again advises him to tell Caroline. He says Caroline has wanted this for so long and now he finds out he is sterile and it is not possible so he can not tell her now. Thomas asks Steffy if she had had second thoughts in letting Ivy go if she is not that pleased with Quinn's designs. Wyatt kisses Ivy and tells her he is going to work from home today as he can not go in and see that smug face of Liam. And now his dad has shot down his own fashion house. Ivy tells Wyatt that she has as much right to be at FC as Steffy so she will not stand for this. Quinn walks in and wonders if they are plotting a way to get her back into FC. Ivy says they are not plotting but she is going to see Steffy and talk to her again. Wyatt has done all he can and Quinn thinks they are being awfully cryptic. The doctor tells Caroline there is no test immediately to give her the answer but she'd like to find out more about this period that Caroline had around the time she had sex with the other guy and is wondering if he could be the father. The doctor says based on everything she has said she has no doubts this is her husband's child and she sees no problems. They will get her started on vitamins right away. Caroline is optimistically happy and can't wait to tell Ridge.",
        "Ridge tells Brooke that he wants to be alone when Caroline comes back so he'd like her to leave. She says again that he needs to tell Caroline and face the future. There are other ways to have a baby. Ridge won't hear of that since Caroline wants his baby. Quinn tells Wyatt that Liam's track record with women is sickening. He will not stand up for Ivy against Steffy. They were both disrespected but he hopes that will change today. Ivy slips in past the guards and tells Steffy that she thinks it is about time she came back to work. Thomas wants to show his dad some designs but runs into Brooke instead. She thinks it is brilliant and adding him to the design team has added a plus. She says Ridge went home as he needed to talk to Caroline, something in private. Caroline is not expecting him at home but can not wait to tell him her news. She starts to gush it out but he stops her and says there is something he needs to tell her first. He starts by saying there is something he needs to tell her about Paris. He was living at a crossroad then and trying to decide what to do with his life. His children were all grown except RJ who was turning into a fine young man. Having another family did not cross his mind so he took steps to make sure he never had any more....he had a vasectomy. So when he had earlier told her he could not give her kids that is what he meant. But then she seemed so broken and cried over the phone and no one to lean on and he knew he had lost her and he would be lost too. So he decided that he would go and have the vasectomy reversed. They can have one kid or ten kids. So he went to the doctor today and he ran tests and Ridge says he is sorry but nothing is viable. He is sorry but he can not be the father to her child."

        "Caroline: Is it possible? Please tell me.",
        "Doctor: That you're carrying another man's child?",
        "Caroline: It was just -- it was one night, and it was a mistake. Please, is there, like, a test? Is there any way to know, anything? I can't leave here without knowing who the father is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Maybe you should see a fertility expert. I know you have complete faith in your urologist, but still...",
        "Ridge: He ran the tests numerous times. He can run it a thousand times. It makes no difference. The result's the same. I'm...sterile. I married Caroline 'cause I want to give her a baby, and now...",
        "Brooke: Caroline loves you no matter what. Okay, yes, maybe she'll be a little disappointed, but she'll come around in the end. But first you have to tell her about the vasectomy and why you kept it from her. You can't hold anything back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Have you seen Quinn? Her designs -- they're all wrong.",
        "Thomas: What's wrong with them?",
        "Steffy: Well, for starters, they're nothing like she pitched.",
        "Thomas: You mean like Ivy and she pitched. Steff, are you having second thoughts about letting Ivy go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] [Groans] Okay, I should probably get going.",
        "Wyatt: No, are you out of your mind, woman? No, you just got here.",
        "Ivy: Oh, okay.",
        "Wyatt: No. Mnh-mnh.",
        "Ivy: It's just...",
        "Wyatt: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Ivy: I don't want to interrupt your work.",
        "Wyatt: No. What work? I have been staring at a computer screen for the better part of today.",
        "Ivy: Why? You can't concentrate?",
        "Wyatt: I mean, I figured it'd be easier working from home and not have to go in the office and see Liam's smug face, but... I just wish Dad hadn't shot down my fashion-house idea.",
        "Ivy: Hey, he didn't want to pit brother against brother. Look, I understand that, and I don't like saying it, but I respect your dad for it. And I love you for trying, so thanks.",
        "Wyatt: You know what? So what if -- if you're not at Forrester? Another fashion house is gonna snap you up like that.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, it's just -- it's frustrating. It's frustrating! If Steffy just hadn't have fired me -- which, by the way, I don't really understand. I mean, no, I shouldn't have used that video, but I deleted it!",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Ivy: I deleted it. And then she has me escorted out of the building. That was humiliating. It was so wrong.",
        "Wyatt: So wrong.",
        "Ivy: Forrester Creations is my family business, too. I won't be kept away. Steffy can't get away with this.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] Whoa, whoa, slugger, okay? You may want to think about this for a second.",
        "Ivy: Why? I have just as much right being at Forrester as Steffy does.",
        "Wyatt: I agree! But there's a little matter of the video, remember? Steffy hasn't told anyone why she fired you. And if you push her --",
        "Quinn: Push who? What's going on?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: Uh, nothing. Nothing. Ivy and I were just talking about stuff and things.",
        "Quinn: Ah, you plotting a way to get your job back at Forrester?",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Quinn: Oh, I'm right, aren't I?",
        "Ivy: No, we're -- we're not -- we're not plotting. I mean, I'm just -- I'm gonna go back down to Forrester, and I'm gonna try speaking to Steffy again, and hopefully this time I'll get through to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Why would I have second thoughts? Ivy blackmailed me. I can't trust her.",
        "Thomas: Steff, she should be thanking you that you only fired her.",
        "Steffy: Oh. Glad you're on my side.",
        "Thomas: Of course, I'm on your side. You're my sister. Except for when I'm not.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: Careful. You don't want to get on the boss's bad side.",
        "Thomas: Not a chance. Besides, Dad and I started off a little rocky, but now that I'm on the design team, he seems to be responding really well to everything that I have to offer.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, how's that going?",
        "Thomas: Great. Great, yeah. Dad's loving everything that I have to give him right now.",
        "Steffy: No, I mean how's it really going, working so closely with Dad and his new wife, given your history with Caroline?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I know you don't want to disappoint Caroline. But this changes everything.",
        "Ridge: Oh, really? You don't think I realize that? She's wanted a baby for so long, and now I'm gonna take that away from her.",
        "Brooke: No, you're not. You've done everything you possibly can to make it happen, only it's not possible. The longer you keep this from Caroline, the harder it's gonna be for both of you. And you know I'm right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: If you're asking about a paternity test --",
        "Caroline: Please don't tell me that it's too early.",
        "Doctor: I'm afraid so. Though you said something earlier about your period. Uh, you indicated it was lighter than normal?",
        "Caroline: Yes.",
        "Doctor: But you said you had it, correct?",
        "Caroline: Yes. Please, just please tell me that this is my husband's baby. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Steffy doesn't back down on pretty much anything. What makes you think you're gonna get her to on this?",
        "Ivy: Well, I at least have to try.",
        "Quinn: Why? Because you miss working with me so much?",
        "Ivy: I miss everything at Forrester, actually, even Pam and her lemon bars.",
        "Quinn: Ew! Ah!",
        "Ivy: And having my defender right down the hall. That was an added bonus, as well.",
        "Quinn: Well, if this guy is in your corner, he's there for life, unlike Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, let's not go there, please.",
        "Quinn: I'm just saying, she can count on you in ways she never could with Liam.",
        "Ivy: Look, I know that. Your son has proven that to me in a way that I'll never forget.",
        "Quinn: Proven it in what way?",
        "Wyatt: Must you know everything, Mom?",
        "Quinn: Must you be so infuriatingly cryptic all the time?",
        "Wyatt: You're infuriating.",
        "Ivy: Can we speak about Steffy again, please? Look, some time has passed, and I think that I can talk to her and -- and get through to her this time.",
        "Quinn: And if you can't, what are you gonna do then?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: What is it with everyone? All right, first Brooke, then Nicole, now you? There's no problem, okay?",
        "Steffy: I didn't say there was. I'm just saying when you first found out about Dad and Caroline --",
        "Thomas: Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. You had problems with their relationship, too.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, for different reasons than you did.",
        "Thomas: I was concerned for Caroline, all right? I thought Dad was gonna let her down just like he did with Brooke and Mom. I was wrong, okay? He totally stepped up.",
        "Steffy: Agreeing to be a father again, you mean?",
        "Thomas: Having a child is everything to Caroline. Granted, Dad wasn't initially gung-ho about the whole thing, but now nothing is gonna stop him from giving his wife the child of her dreams.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: So, how much longer do you think Caroline will be?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. I know you mean well, and you want to -- want to help, but...",
        "Brooke: You don't want me around when she returns.",
        "Ridge: I just want to be alone with my wife.",
        "Brooke: I'll say it again. There are other ways that you can have a child together.",
        "Ridge: I'll say it again. Caroline wants to have a child with me. That's why she went to the doctor's office. She wants to make sure that everything is in place so it can happen. But it can't happen. As long as Caroline's with me, she's never gonna be pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Please just tell me that I'm carrying my husband's child.",
        "Doctor: You really had no idea you might be pregnant?",
        "Caroline: I was on the pill!",
        "Doctor: It's a very effective form of birth control, but none are 100%, especially if you miss a day or two.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] I was just so, so stressed out back then, and... oh, my God. I could be carrying...",
        "Doctor: Caroline, listen to me. I understand why you might be upset. It sounds as if you had your period. This pregnancy would have come after. In my opinion, for now there's no reason to believe this isn't your husband's child.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "Doctor: We can do some more tests to be certain when you're a little further along, but given everything you've told me, I have a really good feeling. Stay positive. It can't be stressing the two of you.",
        "Caroline: Okay. Okay, um... is there anything that I should be doing?",
        "Doctor: We'll get you started on prenatal vitamins. Beyond that, you're a very healthy young woman. I don't foresee any problems.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] It's our first baby. Oh, I can't wait to tell my husband. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Well, Ivy should be there by now.",
        "Quinn: You're really worried about her, aren't you?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, she really wants back in at Forrester. It's not that it can't happen, but still...",
        "Quinn: But it's all up to Steffy now.",
        "Wyatt: You know what? If Liam was such a good guy...",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs]",
        "Wyatt: ...He would stand up to his girlfriend for Ivy.",
        "Quinn: Because Liam's track record with women is sickening, the way he treated Hope and now Ivy? And yet he's still considered the fair-haired wonder boy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, especially in Dad's eyes.",
        "Quinn: What does your dad have to do with all this?",
        "Wyatt: What? Nothing! I -- we're not talking about Dad here. We're talking about Ivy, okay? And you -- you. I don't get you. Practically since the moment you found out Ivy was let go, you were calling me, saying what a great opportunity this is gonna be for us, oh, my God. And now all of a sudden you're on her side.",
        "Quinn: I'm not allowed to change my mind?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. But this is like an instant 180. What is your problem?",
        "Quinn: Because I can see how you feel about her. And I can see how she feels about you. And, you know, in certain ways, your situations are very similar.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Yeah, we were both disrespected by Liam and Steffy. A big cost, too. And maybe that's about to change, you know? At least I'm hoping so for Ivy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I slipped by security.",
        "Steffy: Why are you here, Ivy?",
        "Ivy: Steffy, I think I've been punished enough. I think it's about time I get back to Forrester to do some work, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Hey. Is, uh, Dad here?",
        "Brooke: Uh, did you need him for something?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, well, I just wanted him to check out the tweaks I made to this design that he saw earlier.",
        "Brooke: Ohh, let me see.",
        "Thomas: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Only if you promise to tell me how brilliant this is. All right, all right.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] It is brilliant.",
        "Thomas: No, seriously, come on. Tell me what you really think.",
        "Brooke: No, I-I really think it's good. It's really amazing. And I think being a part of the California Freedom design team really has enhanced your career. It's brought a lot of energy and excitement to your designs.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Thank you for that. It's really challenging me, you know, making me dig deep for stuff. So, uh, where is he, though? Dad?",
        "Brooke: Oh, he had to go home to be with Caroline. There's something they needed to talk about. In private.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Caroline: Champagne? Pour me a glass. Actually, on second thought, don't. Oh. Ah. Scotch. Uh-oh. What happened? Was there, like, a crisis at work? I leave for like a minute to go to the doctor's appointment and then the whole place falls apart. Well, fear not, 'cause I have some amazing news. I thought about it the whole way home how I was gonna tell you, and I think I know how you're gonna react. Well, I hope I know how you're gonna -- I'm getting ahead of myself. I should just start from the beginning. So, I was at the doctor, and, oh, God. I can't believe it. Ah. I still can't believe it, actually. And --",
        "Ridge: Hey. There's something I have to tell you first.",
        "Caroline: Babe, but can't it wait? 'Cause I'm kind of on a roll here, and I just feel like... oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah, you go -- you go first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Why aren't you fighting back?",
        "Wyatt: Ugh.",
        "Quinn: Why aren't you hitting Steffy and her lap dog boyfriend where it hurts the most?",
        "Wyatt: Okay, here we go.",
        "Quinn: Come on, Wyatt. And you know what? Don't -- don't you tell me that it's none of my business, because you're my son. You are -- you are bright, you're talented, you're a natural-born leader. You should be running Forrester Creations and Spencer Publications or -- or you should be creating your own company to go head to head with them!",
        "Wyatt: Who says I haven't tried?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Don't beat around the bush.",
        "Ivy: I know you feel justified in terminating me.",
        "Steffy: You blackmailed me. I think that's more than enough justification, don't you?",
        "Ivy: Steffy, I wasn't dealing well with Aly's death, and it still upsets me.",
        "Steffy: We all miss her. But what you did was wrong.",
        "Ivy: I was torn about what I saw in that video. I agree with you. I shouldn't have used it the way that I did. I should have dealt with my own guilt. Aly was screaming out for help, and I didn't see it or I didn't want to see it.",
        "Steffy: Nobody did.",
        "Ivy: Look, I understand why you don't want me to continue as the face of Forrester. Things got pretty heated between us. But we've both had a chance now to step back and cool off. Steffy, I'm a Forrester, too. This company is very important to me, and I've made a valuable contribution to it, one that I know I can make again. So surely, as president, you can see the wisdom in my return. Look, we're family. We should be able to put things behind us and work together for the greater good of the company. I respect your position as president. And I know that I can prove to you that I'm a loyal and trustworthy employee. So please, Steffy... please find it in your heart to allow me to return to Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: So Dad wanted some private time with his new bride, huh?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Thomas: Well, we both know why. Another one of his famous romantic evenings. Champagne, candlelight, soft music. With any luck, nine months from now, hello, baby Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Everything okay? You seem very serious.",
        "Ridge: Uh, I want to talk to you...about Paris.",
        "Caroline: Paris?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. When I was living abroad, I was at a crossroads in my life, and I had to make a decision about my future. I already had a family. Steffy and Thomas were doing great, and RJ was growing up to be a fine young man, so I, um... the idea of having another family just never really entered my mind, and -- and when it did, it just seemed like a lot of work. And -- and then you showed up in my life, all perfect and beautiful and loving and giving. And -- and if I had known that you were coming, I... but I didn't -- I didn't know. So I took the steps to make sure I would never have children again.",
        "Caroline: Uh, what -- steps? Wait. What steps did you...",
        "Ridge: I had a vasectomy.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Ridge: So when I said I couldn't give you kids, I meant that I-I-I couldn't. And I let you go, because I-I didn't want you to be deprived of the joy of motherhood. But then I talked to you on the phone, and you were sad and crying out there on your own with no one to lean on, and -- and... I realized that if I lost you, I would be lost, too. So I decided that day that I would go and just have the vasectomy reversed. And if you want to have a kid, we'll have a kid. You want 10 kids, we'll have 10 kids. I went to the doctor's office, and he ran tests, and -- and... and I have this...condition... where...where nothing is viable. And what I'm...I'm saying is, I'm sorry, Caroline, but I... I can't be the father to your kid."
