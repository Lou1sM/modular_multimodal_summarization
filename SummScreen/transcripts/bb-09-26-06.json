        "\r\nNick: God, what have I done? ",
        "",
        "Phoebe: Why are we stopping, Shane?\r\nI don't like being on the side of the road like this. ",
        "Shane: This is where all the dangerous accidents took place\r\non PCH. It's okay. It's okay. You're safe. Don't\r\nworry. ",
        "Phoebe: Can we just get out of here, please? ",
        "Shane: You're okay. You're okay. This is where all the fog\r\nrolls in. It's a real dangerous spot on this highway. Kind of like it was a couple of months ago. \r\n",
        "Phoebe: What? ",
        "Shane: Phoebe, I got another confession to tell you. And I\r\nthink this one's really going to freak out when you hear it. It's gonna be kind\r\nof like the night we first met. ",
        "",
        "Taylor: I cannot believe you've\r\ndone all of this. I knew there had to be a good reason you didn't come to the\r\nmeeting. ",
        "Thorne: You deserve this, Taylor. After what you've accomplished? Where is it? \r\n",
        "Thorne: 60 days. I am very proud of you. ",
        "Taylor: It never would have happened without you, Thorne.\r\nHow do I thank you for that? And so much\r\nmore. ",
        "",
        "Nick: You were going to tell your mother everything before\r\nyou told me. Why? ",
        "Bridget: I don't know. You're right, I should have told you\r\nfirst. It's just -- I'm sorry. I obviously haven't thought through this very\r\nwell. Because there is something else that I really wish we didn't have to\r\nworry about at all, but -- you know, because of the problems I had with Nicole, I'd like to check the \r\nHCG levels again, just to\r\nbe on the safe side. ",
        "Nick: And what's that going to tell you? ",
        "Bridget: It will tell us if the pregnancy is heading in the\r\nright direction. ",
        "Nick: In the right direction? Are you telling me that --\r\n",
        "Bridget: Look, I just want to be as safe as possible. So\r\nthat we don't get too attached -- ",
        "Brooke: Hey, sweetheart. Where are you? It's our honeymoon\r\nnight and your bride -- oh, Bridget, you're still\r\nhere. ",
        "Bridget: It's\r\nokay, Mom. I was -- I was just leaving. ",
        "Brooke: No, I didn't mean that. It's just -- is everything\r\nall right? ",
        "Bridget: No, everything's not all right. Look, you and your\r\nhusband have a very special night ahead of you, and here I am, just messing it\r\nup. ",
        "Brooke: Oh, no, honey. You're not messing it up. Is she,\r\nNick? [R.J. crying] Oh, that's R.J. I'll go get him and I'll see you\r\nupstairs very shortly. Good night, honey. I love you. ",
        "Bridget: I love you, too, Mom. ",
        "Bridget: She's really happy. You make her happy. She\r\ndeserves tonight, Nick. So I'm just going to get the HCG test in the morning.\r\nI'll just call you and if everything is fine, then I suppose I should just --\r\ncome by and we'll tell mom tomorrow -- together, okay? ",
        "Nick: Bridget \u2013 ",
        "",
        "Thorne: Don't sell yourself short. You did this, Taylor. You fought the fight and you will keep fighting. \r\n",
        "Taylor: Every day, every year, for the rest of my life. \r\n",
        "Thorne: Well, there's no one I believe in more than you. No\r\none I trust more. You were there for my daughter and me when the unimaginable\r\nhappened, and some stranger took the light out of my life and turned my world\r\ninto something that I didn't recognize or that I can make sense of. And when I\r\nthought that I would never make sense of it again, you were there to tell me\r\nthat it would. And miraculously, it started to, because of you. I had no idea\r\nthen this would turn into something like this. Or so soon. But it has. And I'm not going to question\r\nit. I'm not going to analyze it. I going\r\nto accept it. And I'm going to be grateful that my heart -- that it can feel\r\nagain. And that it can love again. Because\r\nof you. ",

        "Hector: What date was he at the big rock market again? \r\n",
        "Jim: The 15th. Around 9:00 p.m. I'll let\r\nyou know if I learn anything else. ",
        "Hector: Yeah. The 15th.\r\nThat was the night that Darla was killed. Could it be\r\na coincidence? I mean, if it was, it's a hell of a -- it's not a coincidence.\r\nIt can't be. No, Shane McGrath was there. He saw everything. He saw Darla get killed. And now Phoebe is with him. \r\nGod, please,\r\nhave her cell phone on. ",
        "",
        "Phoebe: The night we first met? ",
        "Shane: Yeah. Remember how I told you that things got really\r\ndifficult for me? That things got really, really bad for me? But I didn't tell\r\nyou everything. I didn't tell you that I was homeless and that I had no place\r\nto go. And that I had no money and that basically I was living right down the\r\nstreet from here. And one night, I see this car up here on the road and\r\nstranded. With a flat tire, and then I --\r\nno, no. She was using her cell phone, just like this. So, I came\r\nup and I offered to help. And she just kind of looked at me. Like the way\r\nyou're looking at me right now. ",
        "Phoebe: Oh, my God. That was you? ",
        "Shane: Yeah. Listen, I don't blame you for feeling the way\r\nyou do, or reacting that way because I looked really, really horrible then. I\r\nknow -- no, no, no, no, wait. That was the night that we first met. And I also\r\nsaw something else that night, too. I saw another car approach. And there was a\r\nwoman driving the car and it hit Darla Forrester. And then I saw her stop, and she got out of the\r\ncar and she ran over here to the crash site. That woman was your mother,\r\nPhoebe. I know that's who the police are looking for, right? ",
        "Phoebe: What do you want? Shane, what do you want from me?"
