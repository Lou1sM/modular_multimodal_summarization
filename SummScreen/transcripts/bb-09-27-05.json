        "Jackie: You and Bridget were up late last night.",
        "Nick: I really don't want to discuss my honeymoon with my mother.",
        "Jackie: What honeymoon? I can't believe you didn't go away. I mean, your father owns the company. He'd of given you as much time off as you needed.",
        "Nick: I wish he owned the hospital, because that's where Bridget spends all of her time.",
        "Jackie: Ah, is that why you're in this mood?",
        "Nick: I'm not in a mood.",
        "Jackie: I'm your mother. I know when something is bothering you. Look, you just need to spend more time with your bride, that's all. Let's check your calendar, see what we can work out here.",
        "Nick: Mother, we don't need help planning a honeymoon.",
        "Jackie: You and Bridget have my complete support, Nicky. I didn't think that you could get past Brooke. Nobody did. But you proved me and them wrong. You're married to Bridget, starting a family. Whatever feelings that you had for Brooke, they're behind you now.",
        "Nick: Mother, take these. Would you do that? Here.",
        "Jackie: These are your wedding photographs.",
        "Nick: Here.",
        "Jackie: Don't you want them?",
        "Nick: No, you said you wanted to do something, you wanted to help, so do something with those.",
        "Jackie: Okay, Nicky, what is wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Not another stitch. I wouldn't change a thing.",
        "Eva: Are you sure? We just started.",
        "Eric: You've heard the expression, \"you cannot improve on perfection\"? Of course you have. Look at you, you're this beautiful girl. You've heard that before.",
        "Eva: Thank you, sir.",
        "Eric: No, no, no. Thank you. Good work.",
        "Eva: Oh, it's so nice to go to work when your boss is in such a good mood.",
        "[ Knock at door ]",
        "Bridget: Oh, hi, Daddy.",
        "Eric: Hello. How's our newlywed this morning?",
        "Bridget: How do I look?",
        "Eric: Uh, radiant.",
        "Bridget: Aw.",
        "Eric: You look beautiful.",
        "Bridget: Thanks Dad.",
        "Eric: And I'm not the only person in a good mood here today, see? Eva, thank you. We'll try the next design on right after lunch.",
        "Eva: Okay.",
        "Eric: Okay?",
        "Bridget: Bye.",
        "Eva: Bye.",
        "Bridget: Wow! So, I know why I'm on top of the world, but what's up with you?",
        "Eric: Well, can't I just be happy to see my daughter finally legally wed?",
        "Bridget: Sure you can, Dad. But this seems like a little bit more than happy. You're early. You have a huge smile on your face, a little twinkle in your eye.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, let's just say I'm -- I'm inspired.",
        "Bridget: Obviously. Huh? What are these? Oh, dad, are these Dante's?",
        "Eric: Yeah. Eye-catching, aren't they?",
        "Bridget: Oh, my goodness. They're -- Dad, they're beautiful. Is he around?",
        "Eric: No, he's not in yet. Coincidentally, your mother isn't either.",
        "Bridget: Well, maybe mom's thinking Dante's just as eye-catching as his designs are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: Brooke, you in there? I made you some breakfast.",
        "Brooke: I'm not hungry.",
        "Dante: You've got to eat. What's wrong?",
        "Brooke: I'm fine.",
        "Dante: If you don't get ready soon, you'll be late for work.",
        "Brooke: Oh, work will always be there.",
        "Dante: This has something to do with Nick and Bridget and their wedding, right? How was it?",
        "Brooke: It was nice.",
        "Dante: How nice?",
        "Brooke: It was nice. I'm very happy for them, Dante, whether you believe it or not. If you're going to sit there and analyze me, you might as well take your breakfast and go. In fact, why don't you just pack your bags and get out.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry.",
        "Dante: Hey, no need to apologize, okay? You know, the wedding last night, it was hard for me, too, you know? We both lost someone we care about. I know you -- you love Nick, okay? But you love your daughter more.",
        "Brooke: There's nothing I wouldn't do for my daughter.",
        "Dante: You're making a sacrifice. I respect that.",
        "Brooke: As long as my little girl's happy, I'm happy, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: It doesn't really bother you, does it, Dad, that mom and Dante are living under the same roof right now?",
        "Eric: No, not at all, as long as it doesn't affect their work or their punctuality.",
        "Bridget: Come on, Dad. Cut mom a little bit of slack. She's been having a hard time lately, and she's finally enjoying herself. It's about time.",
        "Eric: For both of you.",
        "Bridget: Thanks. I can't believe that I'm finally married.",
        "Eric: Well, you had four trips to the altar. You ought to be used to the idea by now.",
        "Bridget: I know, I know. But this time, it actually happened. You know, after everything that we've been through, we survived. It's not that I'm surprised, 'cause I'm not. When two people really love each other, I think that they can get through anything.",
        "Eric: You're happy.",
        "Bridget: I'm very, very happy. Honestly, Dad, I don't think my life could get any better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I'm fine, Mother. Bridget and I are fine. Everything is fine. Actually, we're better than fine.",
        "Jackie: That's good, but I wasn't asking about you and Bridget.",
        "Nick: Well, I'm sure you were about to. You usually do.",
        "Jackie: Perhaps I should have, the way you're acting.",
        "Nick: Well, look around this office, would you, Mother? I mean, I have a hell of a lot to do here. I just don't want to waste any time messing around with pictures.",
        "Jackie: Pictures? These aren't pictures, these are your wedding photographs.",
        "Nick: And they'll look great in any album you choose.",
        "Jackie: Nicky, if something's wrong --",
        "Nick: Nothing's wrong.",
        "Jackie: Please, tell me.",
        "Nick: Nothing is wrong. Look at this. Here, look at that. Now, is that the most beautiful, happiest bride you've ever seen in your life?",
        "Jackie: Yes.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Jackie: She's lovely, and she's happy. What about the groom?",
        "Nick: Well, I'd say he is handsome as hell.",
        "Jackie: Oh, Nicky --",
        "Nick: Mother, please, stop worrying. Stop it. It makes me crazy, you know that. Besides, I'd be lying to you if I said I wouldn't rather be on some tropical island alone with Bridget, not in L.A. And everything else that's here. But that just can't happen right now, so we stay here, and we make the best of it.",
        "Jackie: Well, you're certainly good at that -- making the best of it. Overcoming your feelings for Brooke and marrying Bridget --",
        "Nick: I did what was right, for everybody involved.",
        "Jackie: Yeah. And it took a strong man to do that, to put the needs of his child and his child's mother before his own. And I am very proud of you, Nicky.",
        "Nick: I'm no hero, Mother. I don't deserve a medal for putting my commitment to Bridget first.",
        "Jackie: I know, I know. You're a sailor, and sailors do their duty.",
        "Nick: Yes, they do.",
        "Jackie: And you've certainly done yours. Giving up your future with Brooke, honoring your child, I just want to acknowledge that.",
        "Nick: A good man keeps his promise, mother.",
        "Jackie: Yeah, I should have known that you would. I just honestly didn't think that you could get past Brooke. And I was wrong. You're obviously a stronger man than I gave you credit for. Well, I'll let you get back to work. The sooner you finish, the sooner you're gonna get back to your bride. You're sure I can keep these?",
        "Nick: Please.",
        "Jackie: Okay. I'll get them back to you as soon as I can.",
        "Nick: Take your time.",
        "Jackie: Of course, you don't need a bunch of photographs to remember your wedding day. Some memories, they stay with you forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I'm not at all surprised that you're happy. Jackie and I were talking about how Nick brings --",
        "Bridget: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jackie?",
        "Eric: Yes, we were talking about you after the wedding.",
        "Bridget: After?",
        "Eric: You know, life didn't stop when you got married. People do things you know, we went -- we went back to the beach house for dinner.",
        "Bridget: So, like a date?",
        "Eric: No, a celebration. We were celebrating our two children.",
        "Bridget: Huh? Wow.",
        "Eric: She's my friend. She's a respected colleague.",
        "Bridget: And she's very alluring and quite charming.",
        "Eric: Yeah, I'll -- I'll admit that, yeah.",
        "Bridget: Huh? Why do I feel like there's a little bit more of this story that I'm not quite getting?",
        "Eric: You know, I'd love to fill you in on all that, but the fact is, I'm meeting her in a few minutes.",
        "Bridget: Business, or pleasure?",
        "Eric: Don't forget that Jackie owns one of the most highly respected boutiques in all of Southern California.",
        "Bridget: Oh, Dad, come on, stop. I can smell it when a man is smitten.",
        "Eric: Well, there you are. Good morning, Dante.",
        "Bridget: Hey. It finally happened. I got married.",

        "Brooke: But you love me more. Come back to me, darling. Come back.",
        "Nick: Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! It's how I knew every summer from now on would be different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: All right. I'm off to my meeting. Bye, sweetie.",
        "Bridget: Bye, Dad. I love you.",

        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Dante: It's nice to see you smiling again.",
        "Bridget: Aw, thanks. I guess marriage agrees with me. So why were you late today?",
        "Dante: Oh, bad idea on the first week on the job.",
        "Bridget: Unless you've worked it out with the co-ceo over breakfast. I noticed mom's running late. Do you know anything about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Oh, Eric, I think we should stop. Someone might see us.",
        "Eric: Who? Oh, one of spectra's spies, you mean. No, you're right. They might accuse you of giving me preferential treatment.",
        "Jackie: Well, I certainly did last night.",
        "Eric: Yes, you did. And I've been walking on air ever since. And I'm not the only one.",
        "Jackie: I can't remember the last time I felt this good.",
        "Eric: I'm glad to hear it. Although I was referring to Bridget.",
        "Jackie: You've seen her this morning?",
        "Eric: Mm-hmm. She is in my office.",
        "Jackie: Is she all right?",
        "Eric: Yes, she's fine. I've never seen a happier bride. Why?",
        "Jackie: Nothing.",
        "Eric: Nick's happy, too?",
        "Jackie: Yes. I saw him, and he kept saying over and over that he is completely committed to Bridget.",
        "Eric: There, you see? I told you it was possible for a man to forget about Brooke. Jackie, what is it?",
        "Jackie: Look, I don't want to stir up trouble. It's just that when I was talking to Nick this morning, I had this sense that something was off. I can't put my finger on it. It's just, I hope it's nothing to be concerned about.",

        "Nick: He does.",
        "Bridget: I miss you, too.",
        "Nick: That's not the only reason I'm calling. I -- I just want you to know how much this means to me, you know? You and me together and having the baby like this, it's just -- I've wanted it for so long, and I -- I don't know, I just don't want to waste a minute thinking about anything else.",
        "Bridget: Well, you better not let your dad hear you say that.",
        "Nick: I'm very excited about this.",
        "Bridget: I'm excited about it, too.",
        "Nick: Maybe we should sign up for some birth class.",
        "Bridget: Huh, what?",
        "Nick: Well, you know, what's it called, Lemiz, or --",
        "Bridget: Lamaze, Lamaze. Yeah, we should. It's a little early right now. But I'm really glad you're so enthusiastic about it.",
        "Nick: I just want you to know how much it means to me, you and this baby. And most importantly, that you can depend on me.",
