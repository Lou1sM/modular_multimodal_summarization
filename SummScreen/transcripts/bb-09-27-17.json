{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7681 ~ Steffy attempts to find common ground between Bill and Liam after the changes Liam has made at work; Sally is overwhelmed with gratitude when Liam gives her yet another unexpected gift for Spectra Fashions."], "Recap": ["Steffy hugs Bill. He says he hates anyone to see him this way. She reminds him he is human and okay to be vulnerable. He thanks her for listening. She says anything she can do just ask and she will do it. Sally grabs Liam's arm and shows him some of her improvements. She says it is all because of him and he thinks it is incredible. She says again it is all because of him and she cannot thank him enough. He wonders what else does she need. She replies an architect and a builder. Katie tells Wyatt that Brooke just took her rings off. He says wow, he feels like they just got married and he cannot believe he cheated on her so he'd like to know what Brooke said. He knows that when Bill wants something he will stop at nothing to get it. And now has this whole Liam power trip on with Bill away and it makes no sense. He mentions the word fire and sees the reaction on Katie's face and asks if there is a connection. He says he thought they were close enough that she could tell him anything. She says normally yes, but this she cannot. He badgers her and says she does not have to tell him; he knows his dad must have had something to do with the fire. Steffy is glad that Bill is on the same page as Liam on some things but this one is not going to be easy. Bill says Liam is one lucky person to have such an incredible woman as she. He appreciates the support. She says the pleasure is hers. He says she is wonderful and not bad to look at. He does not know what he will do without her. Liam tells Sally that he thinks he knows a way to help her. She wants to hear all about it. He tells her that his dad still has his architects on contract and this would be nothing for them compared to what they did for Sky. She is ecstatic and hugs him, agreeing again to pay him back.", "Wyatt goes straight to Bill and accuses him of burning down Spectra. He does not even have to deny it as he figured it out all by himself. The only thing he did not see is that Liam forced Bill out and blackmailed him for CEO. Wyatt cannot believe Bill is letting him do this. Bill says he is not, but Liam recorded his confession when he had no idea he was being recorded. He realizes he should not have had the fire set but does he deserve to lose all of this and his wife too. There is no changing it. But a son stabbing his father in the back - that is unforgivable. He gave him everything and this is the way that Liam repays him. He will hit him so hard that he won't know what struck him. Bill says Liam does not care if he calls the police and Bill goes away for years. He wants the rooftop for his Brussels sprouts and kale instead of Bill's helicopter landing. Steffy asks Liam if he cannot just sit down and speak with Bill as he regrets what he has done and is willing to work it out. Liam says Bill will not change and talking will do no good. Bill calls and says they can work together if he can just quit this blackmail. They can go back to being a family. Liam puts the recording up to the phone and lets Bill listen to it one more time. Bill tells him okay, take the company in a new direction but he has to destroy the recording and do it NOW."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: I'm, uh, not really comfortable with anybody seeing me this way.", "Steffy: Well, fortunate for you, it's just me. You're human, and you're going through a painful time. And it's okay. It's okay to be vulnerable. Just feel it, go through it.", "Bill: Thank you for listening to me.", "Steffy: That's why I'm here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Liam!", "Liam: Hey.", "Sally: Thanks for coming! I'm glad you stopped by.", "Liam: Uh, yeah. Sure. I heard you made some improvements.", "Sally: Wait till you see it. Come on!", "Liam: Okay.", "Sally: Ta-da!", "Liam: Whoa! You did all this?", "Sally: Well, you know, with some help from some friends, but it's a work in progress.", "Liam: I mean... [ Laughing ] It's incredible.", "Sally: It's getting there. Yes, the resurrection of spectra fashions is happening, and it is all because of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: So brooke left my dad for good?", "Katie: Yeah. I guess so. He -- she took her rings off, so the marriage is over.", "Wyatt: Wow. So, that's it? I mean, I feel like they just got married.", "Katie: Yeah, I know.", "Wyatt: Did he -- did he cheat on her or something? I mean, whatever he did, it must have been bad, right? Did brooke tell you anything?", "Wyatt: I mean, something's up because my dad's whole life lately has been about this building, putting up the tallest skyscraper in los angeles... and you know as well as I do, as soon as he wants something, he will stop at nothing to get it. And out of nowhere, he just takes some time off and he puts liam in charge of the business? Really? I'm just supposed to believe that? Like, he's acting weird, liam's got this whole power trip going on -- it doesn't make any sense. This all started around the time of the spectra fire. What?", "Katie: Nothing. I didn't -- I didn't say anything.", "Wyatt: Katie... I just mentioned the fire, and you had a look on your face. Is there some kind of connection here? Is this all related to the spectra fire?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: So, what do you think? Isn't it great?", "Liam: Seriously, you can't even tell there was a fire.", "Sally: Right? Old girl's got some makeup back on her. The rest of the ship still needs some work, though. Some new furniture, drywall -- all that good stuff -- so please don't check out any other floors on the way out.", "Liam: [ Laughs ]", "Sally: But, uh, it's a start, right?", "Liam: It's more than a start. It's a great start. It's a fresh start for you and spectra. Can't wait to see what else you have up your sleeve.", "Sally: Just you wait. I've got plans that you can't even imagine. And for the first time in a very long time, I have hope.", "Liam: Good.", "Sally: You're the reason for all of this, and I really can't thank you enough.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I've lost so much so quickly. My son, my company... my wife walked out on me.", "Steffy: Brooke's upset right now, but that doesn't mean you have to stop fighting for her.", "Bill: I really thought she was the woman I would spend the rest of my life with. Now she's gone.", "Steffy: Whatever we need to do, anything I can do to help... bill, I'll do it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Just tell me, katie. Is my dad responsible for that fire? Is he?", "Katie: Here's what I know, and I had to learn it the hard way. Don't ask questions that you don't really want the answers to. Ask yourself -- do you really want to know what your father's capable of?", "Wyatt: Yes, because then this whole mystery thing would -- it would end! Just tell me if he was involved. That's all I want to know.", "Katie: I can'T. It's not my place.", "Wyatt: I thought we were closer than that, katie.", "Katie: We are!", "Wyatt: Well, then, I want us to be able to talk about anything here!", "Katie: Well, I want that, too, but this is complicated. You have to understand, this is very, very complicated.", "Wyatt: I'm onto something then.", "Katie: I can't talk to you about this, wyatt.", "Wyatt: Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. Look, I -- I hate that I have to put you in this position.", "Katie: Then don'T. Please don'T. Please.", "Wyatt: But this is why brooke left him, isn't it? Because he had something to do with that fire. He caused that fire! I'm right, aren't I? Just tell me! Okay? This is the only thing that makes sense to me.", "Katie: I can't say it. I can't say it. I can't say it.", "Wyatt: Okay, okay, okay. All right. Okay. Okay. It's fine. You don't have to tell me, but I know that I'm right. I know that's why all this drama is going on, and I know that's why liam is running spencer. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: The entire building has to be up to code, and i refuse to have a repeat of what happened. I can't afford any more accidents.", "Liam: Yeah, well, you've had enough bad luck for two lifetimes. I can't imagine any more coming your way.", "Sally: God, I hope not, but just in case, I am gonna get the best insurance policy in town.", "Liam: [ Laughs ] Probably not a bad idea.", "Sally: Right? Yes. But to get insurance, this building has to pass inspection, and for that to happen, it needs a total renovation.", "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, well, you got the money.", "Sally: I have a loan, yes, thanks to you, but I just -- I never realized how much work was involved.", "Liam: Well, what else do you need?", "Sally: An architect. A builder. Like, a real builder. Not just saul and darlita hammering nails into walls, because then the building will definitely fall down this time.", "Liam: [ Chuckles ] Well, you got a lot on your plate, but nothing that's not doable.", "Sally: Do you have a jackhammer and pliers that i could borrow?", "Liam: Actually, I think i might be able to do better than that. I think I have a way to help you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I know that ordering the spectra fire was wrong. Of course I know it.", "Steffy: I think we all agree on that.", "Bill: But liam's betrayal? Recording me without my knowledge, using it to blackmail his own father -- isn't that wrong?", "Steffy: Liam felt strongly about taking control of this company was for the best at the time.", "Bill: What about the spectra building? He just gives that away. And to who? To sally? With a bow on it? That's costing me tens of millions of dollars, steffy! I mean, not to mention all the other little do-gooder things he wants to implement.", "Steffy: Well, you know, some of it has been a long time coming.", "Bill: Fine, mr. Sanctimonious is doing some good things. I can give him that.", "Steffy: Okay, so you guys are on the same page about some things.", "Bill: Sure, I mean, if -- if that means that we could have some kind of healing, that i could have my son back, you bet. I'll -- I'll meet him in the middle, sure.", "Steffy: Okay, that's great. That gives me something to approach liam with.", "Bill: Won't be easy.", "Steffy: It's a start.", "Bill: You don't give up, do you?", "Steffy: On family, no. I'll talk to liam. Don't worry. We'll heal this divide.", "Bill: You're an incredible woman. Liam is very lucky to have you.", "Bill: You're pretty good at this advice thing. I appreciate the support.", "Steffy: That's what family is for.", "Bill: Liam's not the only one lucky to have you. So am I. It's a honor having you as a spencer.", "Steffy: Well, the pleasure is mine. Though I have to tell you, I'm always gonna be a forrester at heart.", "Bill: [ Groans ] Why do you have to go and ruin a perfectly good moment?", "Steffy: [ Laughs ]", "Bill: Either way, you're a wonderful person. And not half bad to look at.", "Steffy: Oh, okay.", "Bill: And pretty wise. I'm not sure where liam and i would be without you.", "Steffy: I know you two have your differences. You view the world differently. You're different people. Your priorities are different, your personalities are different, but the one thing you two have in common is that you love each other. You have that bond, that father-son bond.", "Bill: You're right. I'm hoping we can overcome this as a family. I better get out of here before the boss gets back.", "Steffy: I know you two can heal this. And, like I said, I'll do whatever I can to help.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: You have a way to help?", "Liam: I think so, yeah.", "Sally: Okay, well, please. Do tell!", "Liam: [ Chuckles ] Okay, so, you know the firm that was supposed to build spencer tower?", "Sally: Yes, your father's dream project which he was supposed to build here...", "Liam: Yeah, well, obviously that is not happening anymore, but my dad still has those guys on retainer. I mean, I'm sure I could introduce you.", "Sally: Seriously?", "Liam: Well, yeah, I don't see why not. The only thing is, they're in san francisco.", "Sally: That is not a problem. I would go all the way to timbuktu if it means I could get this place up and running again.", "Liam: Well, there you go. I mean, they're crazy-good architects, and they have their own contractors who themselves are, like, best in the business. I'm sure they'd do an amazing job.", "Sally: Oh, I'm sure they would, and I completely trust your judgment. Do you think they would be up for it?", "Liam: This is nothing for them. This is, like, new electricity, new flooring, new walls, and it's all up to code. That's easy.", "Sally: Oh, my god. Liam, I -- I don't even know -- I don't even know what to say! You've already helped me so much, I --", "Liam: All right, okay. Breathe, chill. You deserve it.", "Sally: I will absolutely pay you back. Oh! Thank you, liam!", "Liam: [ Laughing ] Okay.", "Sally: Oh, thank you so much.", "Liam: All right.", "Sally: [ Laughs ]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: I would have called but, uh...", "Bill: You don't need a formal invitation to come say hi to your dad.", "Wyatt: I know what's going on. How could you do that?", "Bill: How could I do what? What -- what did I do now?", "Wyatt: You burned down spectra?", "Bill: Who told you that?", "Wyatt: Don't even deny it, okay? I put it together myself! Why would you do something like that? Like, why -- why do you always have to control everything?", "Bill: I got it, okay? I've got it. You want a piece of me? Take a number! Your brother's pissed. My wife walked out of me. I screwed up! There!", "Wyatt: Okay, so I'm right! I'm right, then! You just -- you just handed everything over to liam, is that it?", "Bill: I didn't hand him anything! He took it.", "Wyatt: What? How?", "Bill: How do you think?", "Wyatt: What, he blackmailed you?", "Bill: \"Tell him what he's won, bob!\" \"A new C.E.O., Bill!\"", "Wyatt: Are you serious right now?", "Bill: My own son forced me out of my own company.", "Wyatt: Oh, my god. This explains why he's been such an ass lately, all high and mighty.", "Bill: Eh, you give somebody who feels inadequate a little power, and look out.", "Wyatt: Dad, why are you just letting him do this?", "Bill: I'm not letting him do anything! He has me on tape.", "Wyatt: What?", "Bill: I thought we were having a confidential conversation about the spectra fire, but no. I was being recorded by the little snitch.", "Bill: I shouldn't have ordered spectra to be burned down, I know that, but do i really deserve to lose everything for it, including my wife?", "Wyatt: I know. I heard about that. I mean, is there no chance she'll change her mind?", "Bill: You should have seen the way she looked at me. She called me a criminal. She can't accept what I've done. Hell, I can't accept it. I'm ashamed of myself. What am I supposed to do? What's done is done. I can't change it. But you want to know what's truly unforgivable? A son stabbing his own father in the back! That's unforgivable! I've given that kid everything! I've given you both everything! My multi-million-dollar beach houses, the lifestyle that you live... and how does he repay me? By screwing me. Well, if he wants to get in the ring with the big dog, he's gonna find out that I will hit him so hard, he won't know what happened!", "Wyatt: Look, I'm not arguing with you, okay? But you're a little angry, and i don't want you to do something you're gonna regret.", "Bill: I won'T. I will be calculated. I will work in the family and get him out.", "Wyatt: So he actually said he was gonna turn you in to the police?", "Bill: Exactly what he said.", "Wyatt: Why? [ Scoffs ] Is he stupid? Does he not understand that that's gonna put you away for years?", "Bill: He doesn't care. And he's not just saying it to scare me. He means it. Please, tell me what I have done that he would hold me in such contempt, that he would have such resentment that it would spew out this way.", "Wyatt: I don't know! You know, he's not listening to my opinions, either. He told me to mind my own business. And have you heard about his new policies?", "Bill: I've heard about all of it, wyatt, including his hippie-dippy vegetable garden that he wants to put on my roof! Well, where does he think I'm gonna land my helicopter? In a bed of kale and alfalfa sprouts?", "Wyatt: Okay, what does steffy think about all this? I mean, she can't be too happy.", "Bill: No. She's not. She hates that we're fighting. She's trying to mediate a reconciliation. But steffy understands how important the bonds of family are and if a family member breaks those bonds how quickly things can unravel. Well, that's exactly what your brother's done. And he's gonna regret it, wyatt. That's a check you can cash.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Liam, I -- I don't even know -- I don't even know what to say! You've already helped me so much, I --", "Liam: All right, okay. Breathe, chill. You deserve it.", "Sally: Thank you, liam!", "Liam: [ Laughing ] Okay.", "Sally: Oh, thank you so much.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: All right.", "Steffy: Your father's willing to work with you. He supports the changes that you're making.", "Liam: But I don't believe that.", "Steffy: Can't you two just sit down and speak to each other?", "Liam: No. Because if I let him in a crack, he takes over.", "Steffy: Under all that frustration, he is humbled by that experience. He regrets everything he's done.", "[ Telephone rings ]", "Liam: Liam spencer.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: It's your father.", "Liam: I don't have time for this.", "Bill: Please, liam. Please. Don't hang up. I'm sorry that things got so heated earlier, and I'm just calling to say that I do understand where you're coming from, the things you want to implement, and... I think -- I think that we could work together. In fact, we would be great together. So, what do you say? Can we stop with all this blackmail nonsense? Liam, come on! We're family! Can we start acting like one? Can we put the acrimony behind us and run spencer as a team? But you have to erase that tape. I mean, if for no other reason, just to show some good faith. I know you have it on your cellphone.", "Liam: As a matter of fact, i do.", "Bill: You want more transparency? Is that it? Okay. I'll give it to you. I told justin to get someone to set fire to spectra fashions so I could build spencer tower! That's it! Okay? Are you satisfied? Are you happy now? Can we move on? I did it.", "Bill: Is there anybody in the office with you?", "Liam: Just steffy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Your father has a point. This riff won't end unless that tape is gone. Can we just go on to the next chapter, please?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: We could do it together, son. We could take the company in a new direction. But you have to destroy the recording, liam. And you have to do it now."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cb5EhKR8Ng"}
