He appreciates that. Liam tells Wyatt that his dad lies, cheats and steals and he is tired of that man who is his father. And he thinks Wyatt gives him a pass because he is their father. But Wyatt makes up for Liam's weaknesses so he can use his help with the business the way it should be run. Nothing could stop them. Wyatt says Spencer Publications is a major corporation and they have no experience in running it and there will be huge complications if they fail. Liam says they will not fail. Wyatt says he cannot be on his side. He will always be on his dad's side and payback will be a bitch. Bill and Steffy enjoy a cold beer after an afternoon ride. She says she knows he and Liam will work this out. She confides in Bill that she and Liam have tried but she is not pregnant yet. And she knows Brooke will come back to him and if she doesn't then she will regret it. And another woman will come into his life to make him forget Brooke ever existed.", "Ridge stays behind after moving Brooke home. He starts hinting that she has a lot of room here, a lot more than his loft. She sees where he is heading and says his place is just right for a bachelor. Ridge tells Brooke that Forrester's exists because of four people \u0096 his dad, his mom, and the two of them. Others can run it but they know they owe it to them. And Bill was given the most precious gift and threw it away and Ridge is grateful that he showed his true colors before she got too caught up. He and Brooke's world is the same and it makes them happy. She is a Forrester creation and do not forget that. She wishes there was something at Forrester she could do. He says there is. He wants her to find her space again and he thinks with Steffy as CEO she will more than welcome that too. He wants her around and not just in the office. He likes her passion and her drive. He feels like they have wasted enough time already. He thought it was always going to be the two of them but he was foolish and reckless but he has learned his lesson. Liam tells Wyatt that this is his chance to do the right thing. Wyatt says his dad is wrong and he has expressed that sorrow and it would help if there was a little regret in Liam's voice. Wyatt says he has never heard that sound in Bill's voice at Liam before and he will be back at him. He can hurt him in ways that he never will imagine. Steffy talks of Bill's accomplishments and praises him. He says he is the one who is grateful that he has someone as smart and lovely as she is in his family. Wyatt tells Liam that his dad is never going to be happy with this with Liam in control and giving away his money. He's living in a fantasy world. He begs Liam to find a way to back down and get along with Bill. Liam says it is Wyatt that needs to back down as there is nothing more that man can do to him. In saying goodbye to Bill Steffy says she is going to fix this."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: You mean that, don't you?", "Steffy: Absolutely. As long as I'm around, you got a friend.", "Bill: I guess I better keep you around then, huh?", "Steffy: I guess.", "Bill: I appreciate what you did today.", "Steffy: Hey, I needed that ride as much as you did. We're helping each other out. You looked pretty slick on that motorcycle, I must say.", "Bill: Yeah, well... not so bad yourself. Motorcycle mama.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Wyatt, don't you want to be a part of this?", "Wyatt: What, going up against dad? No.", "Liam: No, going with what's right. Dad's way of doing things, it's wrong. It's always been wrong, and we sure got used to looking the other way, didn't we? Excusing every terrible thing he did or said -- \"ah, it's just dad.\" You know, he didn't mean to be cruel, lie, cheat, steal, destroy people's lives, but he did mean it. Every single time, he meant it, and I am tired of pretending that's normal. I am tired of pretending this man is someone to emulate. I'm gonna do good things here. Be a part of it. Be my right-hand man. Run the company with me. What do you say? Should we do this?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Thanks again.", "Ridge: For what?", "Brooke: For this. Helping me, moving me out of bill'S.", "Ridge: It's one of my favorite hobbies, moving you back home after a marital mishap.", "Brooke: [ Scoffs ]", "Ridge: It's too early for that, isn't it?", "Brooke: Yeah.", "Ridge: What happened? What did spencer do?", "Ridge: Maybe it would help to talk about it.", "Brooke: [ Groans ] Ridge, I have talked and talked and talked...", "Ridge: I mean, maybe talk to a friend, not to the guy that screwed up.", "Brooke: This is really difficult for me. I need to process it. And I just want to make the right decision for myself.", "Ridge: Well... I will support any decision that brings you home.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Do this with you? Run the company?", "Liam: Hell, yeah! Spencer brothers in charge. That's the way it should be.", "Wyatt: You're serious right now.", "Liam: You got to admit, we'd make a great team. Your strengths make up for my weaknesses.", "Wyatt: Okay, now he's admitting he has weaknesses.", "Liam: And vice versa.", "Wyatt: Please.", "Liam: Listen, I'm going into this blind. I mean, there's a lot to learn. I could use your help.", "Wyatt: It's just -- screwing dad over...", "Liam: It's not about dad, wyatt. This is not about dad. This is about spencer publications and running it the way it should be run, with decency.", "Wyatt: [ Sighs ]", "Liam: This is a new era, bro. You and me, we're at the top. There's nothing stopping us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Beer?", "Steffy: Yeah, thank you.", "Bill: Cheers.", "Steffy: Cheers. Are we, uh, just enjoying a cool beer after an afternoon ride, or are we getting drunk, or something?", "Bill: I can only speak for myself.", "Steffy: [ Laughs ]", "Bill: An afternoon ride. I mean, who'd have ever thought?", "Steffy: What?", "Bill: Well, I'm supposed to be, you know, at work, doing something. Making money.", "Steffy: Look, I know this is hard, but it won't be for long. Liam's gonna back off. You guys are gonna work things out.", "Bill: How can you be so confident?", "Steffy: Is there any other way to be?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: You looking for something?", "Ridge: Huh? No, I'm -- I'm just remembering how much room you have here. It makes my loft look really small.", "Brooke: Your loft is small, but it's good for a bachelor.", "Ridge: Yeah, it is. You know, it's the bachelor commute from the beach to beverly hills that gets to me. So if you -- if you know of anyone in the area that has a room for rent, I'm very tidy, very clean.", "Brooke: Might be too soon for that.", "Ridge: Too -- what are you -- what? What are you implying? What are you saying?", "Brooke: I know exactly what you're implying.", "Ridge: I'm not -- no, I -- you're saying I should move in with you, and I don't -- that's not -- it's too soon for that, I mean, even though we would never see each other. It's a big house, and I mean, i would come by anyway to talk to you because I miss you, but I'd see you at work all the time, and I just want you to know that I'm the person that you can lean on.", "Brooke: And I appreciate that.", "Ridge: You're welcome.", "Brooke: But I think you'd have to visit me more here than at work, because I think I'm cutting back my hours.", "Ridge: You -- you can't do that.", "Brooke: Yeah, I do. I want to start working part-time.", "Ridge: No. No. If you're not feeling great, the best thing to do is to throw yourself into work. You're not a part-timer. You're a full-time forrester. You're -- you're a forrester. You always will be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Have you really thought this through?", "Liam: It's all I've been thinking about.", "Wyatt: Running dad's empire?", "Liam: Our empire.", "Wyatt: [ Sighs ] Okay. Don't kid yourself, bro. This is dad's world, and yes, he has been grooming us to take it over someday, but neither one of us is even close to being ready.", "Liam: Speak for yourself.", "Wyatt: We don't have enough experience, liam. That's a fact.", "Liam: We have plenty of experience between us, and what we don't know, we'll figure out as we go.", "Wyatt: We'll figure it out as we -- this isn't a club that you're running in high school, liam! This is a multi-national multi-billion-dollar corporation, and if it fails, there are some serious consequences.", "Liam: Spencer publications will not fail.", "Wyatt: Oh, really? You sure about that? Because some of the decisions you've been making around here...", "Liam: I've been cost-effective long-term. Dude, I've run the numbers.", "Wyatt: Buying spectra and gifting it back to sally? Have you really run the numbers on that? Because that is a huge gamble.", "Liam: Yeah, well, some gambles are worth taking, especially for a good cause.", "Wyatt: Sally is not a cause.", "Liam: Sally is a good person who got screwed over by dad's tower obsession. Now, good people deserve to have good things happen to them.", "Wyatt: And what about naive people who betray their vengeful fathers? What do they deserve? Payback? Because I will not be your right-hand man in that gamble. My money is on dad because he has always gotten his revenge. And I got a feeling, bro... payback is gonna be a bitch.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Well, slick, we gonna be riding tomorrow?", "Bill: Slick? Ah, so my skills on the bike earned me a new nickname I see.", "Steffy: Yeah, maybe.", "Bill: Okay, well, let me just see here... oh, well, look at that. My schedule is, uh, wide open, so, yeah, we have a date for tomorrow. Motorcycle mama.", "Steffy: Yeah, I don't know if that's the best nickname for me.", "Bill: Oh. Oh, I -- I apologize. That was so stupid.", "Steffy: No, no. It's fine.", "Bill: That was insensitive.", "Steffy: It's okay. It's okay. Uh, well, actually, we've, um... we've been trying.", "Bill: To get pregnant?", "Steffy: Obviously no luck.", "Bill: Well, no, come on, now. Where's that confidence? You need that for yourself, not just for other people.", "Steffy: Good point, grandpa bill.", "Bill: Grandpa slick.", "Steffy: Okay, yeah. That's what we'll call you. I got it.", "Bill: [ Chuckles ] Well, assuming liam will let me see your kids, of course.", "Steffy: Oh, my gosh, there's not gonna be any tension between you two then. It's, like, I'm not even pregnant yet. Calm down.", "Bill: You know, I thought I'd be doing the whole grandparent thing with brooke at my side.", "Steffy: Who says you won't?", "Bill: There's that confidence again.", "Steffy: Brooke would be crazy not to come back to you. And if she doesn't, it's her loss because I can guarantee you, a woman's gonna come into your life that's gonna make you forget that brooke logan ever existed.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Okay, so... you make it sound so easy. I'm supposed to just throw myself into work, and then all my troubles will go away.", "Ridge: Well, it is easy. Worked for me every time I lost you.", "Brooke: Does forrester really need me? There's a lot of young blood there.", "Ridge: Don't -- don't say that. This company exists because of four people -- my father, my mother, me...and you. And the new people, they know that they have their jobs because of us. I mean, where would they be? Where would any of us be without the belief formula? Now, the men's line, brooke's bedroom, to this day, still the best-selling one we have. You are forrester creations. You belong with us. [ Sighs ] What better place to jump into if you're feeling sad, in so much pain? What better place that somewhere where people have your back? I don't care what bill did. It really doesn't matter. He was given the most amazing gift -- you. And he threw it away. And I'm happy. I'm not happy. That's not the right word because you're so sad. But I am grateful that he showed his true colors before you got all caught up in his selfish web. We share a lot of stuff, you know. Our worlds are the same. Designs, you know... a line that's out on the runway for the first time, it makes us happy. You are forrester creations. Don't ever forget that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: [ Scoffs ] Revenge from dad? Really?", "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.", "Liam: Brother, you cannot go through life worrying about that.", "Wyatt: Exactly. I can't and I won'T. As long as I don't put my stamp of approval on your little coup here, I'm not gonna be the one he's lashing out at.", "Liam: Damn it, wyatt, this is your chance to do the right thing.", "Wyatt: I don't believe blackmail is the right thing! And what dad did was wrong, yes, but as least he regrets it.", "Liam: Sure.", "Wyatt: He does! And you know what, it would be nice to hear a little regret in your voice, too.", "Liam: I don't! I'm sorry. I don't regret taking the reins from him.", "Wyatt: You will. You will, because if you keep this up, you definitely will. I have never seen dad this furious before. He will get back at you. You can count on that. And I just -- I got a feeling, however he does it, he's gonna hurt you in ways that you never even imagined.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: How does forgiveness come so easily to you? I mean, hell, you go beyond forgiveness. You go to bat for me, you reach out to liam...", "Steffy: I wouldn't do this just for anyone.", "Bill: Oh, so I'm special, huh?", "Steffy: Oh, you know it.", "Bill: Why do I think \"a special kind of jerk\" is about to come out...", "Steffy: Well, like a special kind of jerk who's rough and tough but enjoys showing that to the world, but I really know you, and I just know that's for show.", "Bill: Think so, huh?", "Steffy: Yeah, I think you're like... you're like a teddy bear.", "Bill: A teddy bear? Come on now.", "Steffy: Okay, okay, you're more like a grizzly bear.", "Bill: [ Chuckles ]", "Steffy: But the spencers wouldn't be a family without you and your leadership. I know that because I am a spencer. And I'm grateful to be one. I'm not gonna let this family implode on itself.", "Bill: I'm the one who's grateful. To have a woman as smart and beautiful as you are in my family. And on my side.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Okay, okay. Say no more. Forrester is my home. I know it, and you know it. I just wish there was something I could sink my teeth into.", "Ridge: There is. Lingerie.", "Brooke: Well, steffy's doing just fine with the intimates line.", "Ridge: Well, yeah, but steffy is co-C.E.O. She's very busy, and I think she'd be happy if you took over again.", "Brooke: Really? Is there anybody else? I mean, it doesn't have to --", "Ridge: No, there isn't anybody else. Don't you want to be in the middle again? The logan I remember, she kind of liked the limelight a little bit. And I think bill took that away from you because his personality walks into a room and he just sucks the air out of it, and i just -- I want you to find your space again. And it would be kind of nice to see you walking around in lingerie every day, so...", "Brooke: Oh! [ Laughing ] Okay. The truth comes out.", "Ridge: Don't -- you're making it ugly. It's not that. You inspire me.", "Brooke: You don't need to see me running around half-naked to be inspired.", "Ridge: I do. I don'T. It doesn't matter. Half-naked or fully dressed, I just -- I want you around. I want... your determination and your passion and your drive, I want it around, and not just -- not just in the office.", "Brooke: [ Sighs ] Ridge, I just -- I need some time.", "Ridge: I know that. I just sometimes feel like you wasted enough time already. I was foolish and reckless, and I've learned my lesson. I want you to come home. I always figured it was gonna be you and me in the end.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: [ Scoffs ] Look. Dad's hurt. I get that. He might lash out. I get that, too. I can handle whatever he throws at me.", "Wyatt: I mean, why -- I'M... I'm worried about you.", "Liam: Oh, come on, wyatt.", "Wyatt: Look, you're in this fantasy land and you don't even make any sense. Dad is never going to be happy about this. He's never gonna be proud of you for blackmailing him into control and then just giving away all his money! Like, you've got to listen to me here, and you've got to listen to steffy. We care about you. What you're doing right now is wrong. So, please, back down. Find a way to make things right with dad because you -- you do not want to make him your enemy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Next time we ride, I'll give you a 10-minute head start.", "Bill: 10-minute head start -- why?", "Steffy: So we can meet at the destination at the same time.", "Bill: [ Laughs ]", "Steffy: You may be slick, but I don't think you can keep up.", "Bill: Oh, I can keep up. In fact, I can more than keep up.", "Steffy: Ooh, dream on.", "Bill: [ Chuckles ]", "Steffy: Hey, I'm not giving up. I'm gonna convince liam.", "Bill: I bet you will.", "Steffy: And if you want me to talk to brooke, just say the word.", "Bill: Well, if anybody can sway her, I know it would be ms. Confidence.", "Steffy: There's a woman out there for you. I think it's brooke, and if not, someone worthy will cross your path.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Look, I appreciate your concern, but you got to calm down. Dad can consider me an enemy all he wants, but it doesn't really matter, wyatt, because there is nothing left that man can do to me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Thank you, steffy. Today has been just what i needed."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeEqfHfX4zI"}
