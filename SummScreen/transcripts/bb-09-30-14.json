        "Brooke says there is one person that she can't get out of her mind. It's obvious to Eric that it is Eric. She laughs and says that is sweet but no, it is her sister. Can she really do this to Katie. She wants to know that Katie is happy and protected. Somewhere along the way she lost that. She allowed herself to be with Bill although that too started off with just going along with what Katie wanted. She says it does not turn out good when she follows her heart. He tells her Katie is with Ridge so Brooke needs to lead her life. If she wants to be with Bill, then be with him. She says she realizes there is more to life than just following her heart. She is not interested in trying to figure out the next man she will be with, but the person that she wants to be. Eric gets a phone call but says Milan can wait. He says he has been with her a long time and he has seen her mature and grow, just like Stephanie wanted. She says she never felt worthy but she wants to be. No more mistakes like she used to make. Ridge's accident gave her time to stop and think. She has always wanted to be the center of attention no matter who it hurt. She does not want to be that person anymore. Take herself out of the equation and let Katie decide who she wants to be with, Ridge or Bill. She wants to change who she was 20 years ago, even ten years ago, even 6 months ago. She wants to start over as Brooke Logan.",
        "Quinn tells Deacon to cheer up. Two bad asses like them don't need to be in a relationship. She hopes Bill and Brooke have a long mind numbing marriage of regrets. They will be miserable to be tied down to each other every day. Deacon says she is actually cheering him up. She tells him not to call her nice. She has plans for him. Her disposal is clogged. That was not chitchat so get to work. All she really wants is her son to be happy. Hope will get over this and Quinn needs the time to prove herself to Hope and Wyatt and everybody. Things haven't turned out so bad. He brings up Ricardo again. She says again she did not kill him. He says if he is going to take care of her plumbing every now and then, he needs full disclosure. She would like to keep the past in the past. He says she needs more than her son to keep her happy and busy. She is way too obsessed with her kid. He kisses her passionately. Quinn pulls away and Deacon asks if she is going to stab him. She says no but asks if he is drunk. It's been a long time since a man kissed her that way while completely sober. He says he does not want to be on the receiving end of all her obsession so tell him why he should not run away as fast as he can. He has fixed her disposal and asks if she has anything more that needs plumbing. She says she will keep the fridge stocked for him and he can always fix her plumbing. But for the record she is not a fan of being touched. The kiss though was not bad; she liked it. He says he has made a lot of dangerous decisions in his life and something tells him he is about to make another one. They kiss again. While Katie is talking to Bill, Will puts a coin in his mouth and starts to choke. Katie yells that he can't breathe."

        "Brooke: Every time I think of Bill and me together, I think it would be a terrible mistake... because there's one person that I keep thinking about. I just can't get it off my mind.",
        "Eric: Not Ridge?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Eric: Not Deacon?",
        "Brooke: Did you really have to ask that?",
        "Eric: Well, so, who? Who is this person?",
        "Brooke: What have we been talking about?",
        "Eric: You mean me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Um, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Bill: What do you mean, \"no, no, no\"? Listen to mommy. What -- \"no, no, no\"? What are you talking about? Hey, listen, this is my time with Will. I'll take him to dinner where I want.",
        "Katie: Those waitresses are barely wearing bikinis.",
        "Bill: Exactly!",
        "Katie: Oh, God. Okay, fine, you can take him wherever you want, but tomorrow night, I am taking him to a-a feminist-poetry reading just to balance things out.",
        "Bill: Ugh. Okay. All right, I would expect nothing less.",
        "Katie: Well, um, I'll get out of your hair.",
        "Bill: Um, actually, uh...",
        "Will: Miss!",
        "Bill: No, would you -- would you stay? I got two calls -- just two -- that I have to return. So, would you -- would you entertain Will just for five minutes?",
        "Katie: Oh, I see. We're -- we're kind of missing the daycare that I had here when I was C.E.O. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Cheer up, Deacon. I mean, two badasses like us -- we don't need to be stuck in a relationship.",
        "Deacon: Right, look, if she wants to marry Bill, you know what? Fine. Go do it. You can only help somebody so much when they're determined to ruin their life, right?",
        "Quinn: Right, and if they can't see what's right there in front of their faces...",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: You know, I hope they have a very long marriage full of boredom...",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: ...And mind-numbing regret. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Bill and Brooke are gonna be miserable. You know that? Tied down to each other -- not in a good way.",
        "Deacon: Having to answer to each other day in and day out.",
        "Quinn: That domestic routine. Probably get a puppy.",
        "Deacon: You know, I got to tell you -- you're, uh -- you're actually cheering me up.",
        "Quinn: Well, I can't have you moping around, bringing me down.",
        "Deacon: So, um, why are you doing all this?",
        "Quinn: Doing what?",
        "Deacon: Being nice.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Don't call me that.",
        "Deacon: I just figured you'd be done with me by now. Hope and Wyatt -- they're together. That is the original reason you wanted my help.",
        "Quinn: You were useful. And you'll continue to be. Got, uh -- got big plans for you.",
        "Deacon: Really?",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. My disposal is clogged. I wasn't making chitchat. Get to work.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I'm gonna get you now! I'm gonna get you now.",
        "Katie: He's in the tickle machine! How will he ever get free?",
        "Bill: I'm gonna get you now.",
        "Katie: I'm glad that you're being able to experience these stages with him. You missed that with Wyatt and Liam.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I'm really glad, too. I'm so glad.",
        "Katie: What -- what the heck? What is this?",
        "Bill: What is it?",
        "Katie: Let me see.",
        "Will: Mine. Mine.",
        "Katie: Yours? It's yours? He will not let it go. What is that?",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Katie: That -- like father, like son, I see.",
        "Will: Mommy! Mommy!",
        "Bill: Why, you little thief.",
        "Katie: Uh-huh.",
        "Bill: Taking my money.",
        "Katie: Dollar Will Spencer.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I like that. That's pretty good.",
        "Katie: It has a nice ring to it.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Taking my money. Taking my money?",
        "Will: [Giggles]",
        "Bill: Taking my money?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Eric, did you think I was talking about...? [Chuckles] Oh, my gosh. You're -- you're so sweet.",
        "Eric: All right, it's not me.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: So, who is this? Who's this person who's keeping you from marrying Bill?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] My sister. Can I really do this to Katie?",
        "Eric: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: [Grunts] All right, all fixed.",
        "Quinn: I knew you'd be handy with tools.",
        "Deacon: Well, I was just wondering, ma'am, if maybe you have any other, uh, pipes you need plumbed. Bow, chicka, chicka, chicka",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] No, seriously. Hey, I really appreciate everything you do for me -- you know, letting me sleep here, and, uh, I'm happy to earn my keep, all right? I don't really think doing a couple repairs every now and then is gonna compensate for everything you've done.",
        "Quinn: Well, it'll do for now. Besides, all I care about is my son being happy. And as long as, uh, that's what your daughter wants, well, mi casa es su casa.",
        "[Bottles clink]",
        "Deacon: Well, we do have a little problem there, given the fact that Hope hates you.",
        "Quinn: Ah, for now. She'll get over it.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I don't see that ending anytime soon.",
        "Quinn: It has to. I can't be excluded from my son's life -- not forever. And I want the opportunity to prove myself to Hope and Wyatt again, to everybody.",
        "Deacon: And you want me to help you with that?",
        "Quinn: If you're willing. I understand I've made some mistakes, but things didn't turn out so bad. They'll see that.",
        "Deacon: Like, uh... Ricardo Montemayor?",
        "Quinn: Why are you bringing him up?",
        "Deacon: Hey, that was your fault, all right? You know, \"mi casa\" -- very nice intonation.",
        "Quinn: Spanish?",
        "Deacon: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: I told you I didn't kill him.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, you tell me a lot of things. What I choose to believe is very different. I mean, after what happened to Liam...I want to know how dangerous you really are. If I'm gonna be, uh, taking care of your plumbing every now and again, I think I deserve a little full disclosure, don't you?",
        "Quinn: I would like to keep the past in the past. I had a mission, and I accomplished it. Hope and Wyatt are together, and I need your help to make sure it stays that way.",
        "Deacon: I don't think you're gonna have to worry about that.",
        "Quinn: I always worry.",
        "Deacon: If you want my opinion -- and I know you haven't asked for it -- you are way, way too obsessed with Wyatt. I mean, you have to learn to find some different needs outside of your kids.",
        "Quinn: Like what? What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Little rascal -- taking my coins. Taking daddy's coins.",
        "Katie: Yeah, he's pretty fascinated by it.",
        "Bill: It's in the genes. He's naturally drawn to money.",
        "Katie: Well, it may be in his DNA, but it is not a baby toy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Thinking back to how everything started -- Katie was so sick. How she wanted us together -- she kept pushing us to be together. She arranged that hot-air-balloon ride. We really were just trying to help her. We weren't thinking about anything else. Little did we know that something wonderful would come out of that.",
        "Eric: Hot-air-balloon rides have a tendency to do that. He doesn't claim to be the first guy to take you up in a hot-air balloon, does he?",
        "Brooke: No. [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: I think I knew even then, though.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Eric: About Ridge...and that the two of you were destined to be together. And I believed that for a very long time. And now here you are... maybe about to marry Bill.",
        "Brooke: Katie's with Ridge. So that makes sense, right? We should all be very happy, right?",
        "Eric: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: I don't know why I keep questioning it. It's just I want to make sure that Katie's happy, that she's safe, and she's protected, just the way I always did, ever since we were very young. And then somewhere along the way, I just -- I just kind of lost it, allowing myself to fall for Bill. And now she's with Ridge. But is that the right thing? Is that -- is that what is best?",
        "Eric: Look...I don't care for Bill. I don't think I ever will, but I can really see how much he means to you.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Um, well, most people tell me that it -- it doesn't turn out good when I follow my heart.",
        "Eric: Well, don't listen to them.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] But Katie --",
        "Eric: Katie is with Ridge. Live your life. You take all this passion of yours, and you let it go. Don't bottle it up. If you want to be with Bill, be with him.",
        "Brooke: But there's more going on. There's the kids. There's more to life, I realize, than just following my heart. There's more to me. And I think that that's what Stephanie has been trying to get me to understand for all these years. I'm not interested in trying to figure out the next man that I'm gonna be with. I'm interested in trying to figure out the person that I want to be. [Chuckles] [Sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: So, now that Ridge can draw, you've got wedding bells in your head?",
        "Bill: Well, nothing holding Brooke back.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Katie: Nothing.",
        "Bill: Katie.",
        "Katie: No, it's -- I hope it all works out the way you want it to...even though there is a part of me that still isn't crazy about you being with my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Yeah, tell him I'm working on it and that I'll have somebody in Milan by the end of the week. Absolutely. No, Pam, I'm in a meeting. Thanks.",
        "Brooke: Eric, I know you're busy. I really should go.",
        "Eric: No, no, no, no. Milan can wait. You're my priority.",
        "Brooke: Thank you. I feel like you're the one person who really, truly understands me.",
        "Eric: Well, I am.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: We've been in each others' lives for a long time, haven't we? I've watched you change and grow and mature into this wonderful woman. Look at you. And now you're becoming the matriarch of this family... just like Stephanie wanted.",
        "Brooke: I never felt worthy. But I want to be. I don't want to make those same mistakes that I made for so many years. I mean, the old me -- I would have skipped off to the altar with Bill in a second -- my sister's ex-husband. I almost married Bill in Abu Dhabi, and I still might. But Ridge's accident really gave me a chance to stop and to think. I've always been the kind of person that craves attention, wanted to be the center of attention. I had fed off of that, and it didn't matter who I hurt in the process, especially Katie. I don't want to be that person anymore. I want to take myself out of the equation and allow Katie to decide who she wants to be with. Does she want to be with Ridge, or does she want to be with Bill? Whatever it is that makes her happy and works for her life. I want to change who I was 20 years ago -- 10 years ago. Heck, even a couple of months ago. I want to change the person I was, and I want to be somebody different today. What kind of woman is Brooke Logan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: You're not gonna stab me, are you?",
        "Quinn: Wasn't planning on it. Are you drunk?",
        "Deacon: No. What? Why? Are you?",
        "Quinn: No. It's just -- it's been a long time since a man has kissed me like that -- sober, I mean. This is -- this is gonna sound crazy, but --",
        "Deacon: Well, that is your middle name.",
        "Quinn: Most people -- when they -- they see me, they think I'm odd, or they're afraid of me. But you are --",
        "Deacon: Honey, I'm not afraid of anything. But maybe I should be. I mean, my daughter hates you. You pushed Ivy into the seine, and you tried to stab Liam in the heart with a sword, and then there's the whole Ricardo Montemayor incident. Stop. I don't need to hear it, all right? Because as far as I'm concerned, you might have had something to do with killing him to get that diamond. So you tell me -- why shouldn't I run as far as I can?",
        "Quinn: You won't. But I think you need to be careful. You're the one who pointed out how obsessive I can be. I mean, I have a tendency to let people consume me.",
        "Deacon: I wonder what it's like to be on the receiving end of all that obsession.",
        "Quinn: I would say that it's extremely overwhelming... but very, very rewarding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Don't get ahead of yourself. I don't move that quickly. I'll keep the fridge stocked, and... you keep working on my plumbing.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Sounds fair enough.",
        "Quinn: And just so you know, I'm not a fan of people touching me.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",
        "Quinn: But... that kiss was -- wasn't bad, and I liked it.",
        "Deacon: I've made a lot of dangerous choices in my life. Something tells me I'm about to make another one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Brooke's Flashback)",
        "Bill: I love you, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I love you.",
        "(Present Time)",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You're happy with Ridge, right?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Everything's great?",
        "Katie: Everything's fine.",
        "Bill: Then what the hell difference does it make?",
        "Katie: Hey, language. Language.",
        "Bill: Okay, I'm sorry. He didn't hear it.",
        "Will: Miss.",
        "Katie: It's just -- it's -- it's awkward. I -- we've talked about this before -- the idea of you raising our son with my sister -- it's -- it's weird. I like this. I-I feel like we get along better when you're not with Brooke.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] We'll figure it out. And listen -- who knows if -- if Brooke is gonna choose to marry me?",
        "Katie: [Scoffs] She will.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I think she will, too. Look, I-I know it's difficult for you to accept, but eventually, Katie, we'll work it out.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Will? There's something wrong. There's something wrong. Oh, my God! He's not breathing! He's choking! There's something wrong! He's choking. He's not breathing! He's not breathing! [Sobbing] Oh, God! He's not breathing."
