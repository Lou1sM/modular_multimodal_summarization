{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Katie is hysterical as Bill tries to hit on Will's back and get him to cough up the coin that he swallowed. Brooke rushes in and Katie tells her to call 911 quickly. Bill continues to do his best Heimlich maneuver and finally the coin dislodges. Katie takes Will in her arms and both she and Bill are relieved. Brooke sees how they are bonding again as a family should. Ivy sits at her desk thinking about her kiss with Liam. Aly comes in and they discuss Liam with Aly saying right now he needs support and understanding. Neither can think what could have happened to make Hope go back to Wyatt. They are interrupted by Liam who asks Aly is she wants to talk about that piece for Eye On Fashion. Aly says yes but casts a look at Ivy and says she just realized this might not be the best time considering. He nervously chuckles and says reality is beginning to set in and he realizes he is not going to get Hope back. They don't understand why she can't break this hold from Wyatt. Liam says he thinks eventually they will all realize why. He thought it was their time but she made a commitment to Wyatt and now she has to honor that and there is nothing he can do. With Aly gone now he tells Ivy there is a lot more going on inside Hope than he was prepared for. There's an attachment to Wyatt that is bigger than Liam. Those two are going to be linked to forever. Ivy still is not sure why Liam is so sure. Hope is home in a reflective mood. Wyatt comes in and says he rushed home as soon as he got her message. He wonders if anything is wrong. He asks if it is Bu because he can stay. He actually likes that cat now. He's ecstatic when she tells him she is pregnant. He keeps asking if this is for real. She says yes she knew she was late but she took a test and it came up positive. They both are concerned that the other will be happy over this news. Hope says yes she is excited. He says this is the best news she could ever have told him and the greatest gift. There is no one he'd rather share this with but her. And this after just the other day he thought she was going back to Liam and he would have respected that decision. But that wasn't Hope. She believes in their relationship and their marriage. This baby changes everything. It makes a deeper connection between the two of them forever. He kisses her and wipes a tear from her eye. Katie tells Brooke and especially Bill that the last few months haven't been easy but today put it all in prospective. They need to remember what is important. They need to get along for their children. Brooke tells her they have come a long way. She's very proud of her. Bill tells Katie that he is proud of her too. She says she has not always agreed with his choices but he has been an amazing father to Will and that is all that is important to her now. He says that means a lot to him. Being a great father is his greatest goal. It's even better than being CEO, by a long shot.", "Back at Katie's Brooke tells her that she has done a lot of soul searching lately. She has talked to Eric and there is a high level opening in Milan and she thinks she is going to take it. Katie is shocked that she would move and wonders if Bill knows. Brooke says no; she has not told him yet. Brooke says she needs to get away and regroup. She's done some things in her life, very selfish things she is not proud of. She is sorry she let Katie down. Katie says she is past all of that. Brooke says she stole her husband. That was wrong and she is going to try to make it up to her somehow. She comments there is still a lot of love between Katie and Bill. She saw it today in the office when they bonded again over Will. But there could be more. Brooke says she is leaving town so she is taking herself out of the equation. They are a family so she just wants her to consider that. When Ivy has to go meet Eric and leaves Liam alone in the office he calls Hope. He asks if she can talk now. She says briefly. She just told Wyatt about being pregnant. Liam says she knows that he can not stop loving her. Wyatt returns to the room so Hope tells Liam that she has to go. Wyatt tells Hope full steam ahead, no turning back."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Katie: Will? There's something wrong. There's something wrong.

I just wanted to give him some space.", "Aly: I thought for sure hope was going back to him.", "Ivy: I think we all did... and probably no one more than Liam.", "Aly: It isn't good for him to be dealing with this on his own. I think right now he needs support and understanding.", "Ivy: Yeah, I just really hope he knows that we're there for him.", "Aly: We'll make sure he knows.", "Ivy: You know, I can't make sense of this. What could possibly have happened to make hope go back to Wyatt?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: It's okay. Whatever it is, you can tell me. It'll be all right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: I'm pregnant.", "[Door opens]", "Wyatt: Hey.", "Hope: Hi.", "Wyatt: Hey. I got your message. Uh, I got back as quickly as I could.", "Hope: Yeah, thank you for coming home.", "Wyatt: Yeah. Everything okay? What's going on?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Could there be something we don't know?", "Aly: I guess hope's bond with Wyatt is stronger than anyone realized.", "Ivy: Oh, apparently so.", "Aly: Liam's a free man now... whether he likes it or not.", "Ivy: [Sighs] He's just such a great guy, you know? Just we had so much fun together.", "Liam: Hey.", "Aly: Hey.", "Liam: Am I interrupting?", "Aly: No, no, please -- please come in. Thanks for coming over.", "Liam: Yeah, sure. So, you, uh -- you want to talk about that piece for eye on fashion?", "Aly: Yes. We -- we do, but I just realized, you know, maybe this isn't the best time to discuss work, considering...", "Ivy: Yeah. How you -- how you doing?", "Liam: [Sighs] How am I doing? Um... [Chuckles] Well, I think the reality is setting in. I mean, I'm never getting hope back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Please tell me nothing's wrong.", "Hope: No, everything is fine.", "Wyatt: Okay.", "Hope: Yeah. Uh, come here. [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Okay.", "Hope: [Clears throat]", "Wyatt: What is it? Is it 'bu? Okay, he can stay. I actually grew to like him. He's a nice -- he's a nice kid.", "Hope: No, no, no, no. Um, actually, someone else is going to be moving in.", "Wyatt: Oh. Who? Is he -- is it your dad?", "Hope: No.", "Wyatt: Deacon? I don't know if we have a lot of room for deacon around here.", "Hope: It's not my dad.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "Hope: It's a little person who I'm hoping you will be very happy to meet... in about nine months.", "Wyatt: Wait. Are -- are you -- are you pregnant?", "Hope: [Inhales deeply]", "Wyatt: What?", "Hope: [Exhales deeply]", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Somebody answer. Please.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Please, you've got to get it out! You got to get it out!", "Bill: Come on, will.", "Katie: Come on, baby.

My baby.", "Bill: [Sighs]", "Will: [Whimpers]", "Bill: Ohh.", "Katie: [Sighs]", "Bill: Oh, you scared us.", "Katie: My baby.", "Bill: [Sighs]", "Katie: [Sighs]", "Bill: Oh, boy, you scared mommy and daddy.", "Katie: Oh, my God. Your son is perfectly fine.", "Katie: Oh, thank you so, so much for coming over. [Chuckles] It's a good thing you knew to perform the Heimlich maneuver.", "Bill: Oh, that's because of Katie. She insisted we both take infant- and child-CPR training before will was born. That's wonderful to hear. I recommend all parents get certified. Well, as we learned today, it can save a life.", "Katie: Yeah.", "Brooke: Yes, it can. Give him a little ice cream. It helps soothe the throat.", "Bill: Well, thanks for coming over, doc. Let me walk you out. Watch out, buddy. [Sighs]", "Katie: Oh, ice cream, huh?", "Brooke: Did you hear that, will? You get to have some ice cream.", "Katie: Yummy in my tummy.", "Bill: [Sighs] You know, I-I really can't believe I left those coins laying around.", "Katie: Well, it -- it wasn't your fault. I mean, I should have been watching him more closely. It was an accident. We just have to make sure it never happens again.", "Bill: I'm just glad he's okay.", "Katie: I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: At some point, hope is going to realize that she made a big mistake -- picked the wrong guy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: I think, deep down, she already knows that, but for some reason, and whatever that is, she just can't break this bond with Wyatt.", "Liam: I think it'll start to make sense at some point.", "Ivy: We just wanted things to go differently for you.", "Liam: Hey, me, too. I -- you know, I-I really thought this was hope and my chance. I really did, but she's made a commitment to Wyatt, and -- and she has to honor that now, and there's nothing I can do about it, so...yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: We're having a baby? This is -- this is totally for real?", "Hope: [Chuckling] Yes.", "Wyatt: This is really actually happening?", "Hope: Yeah, this is really happening.", "Wyatt: Oh, my. Wow! Holy sh-- when? When? When did you find out?", "Hope: Uh, only very recently.", "Wyatt: I-I-I had no idea.", "Hope: Neither did I.", "Wyatt: Well, yeah.", "Hope: But, you know, I-I knew that I was, you know, late, so I-I took a test, and it was positive.", "Wyatt: Oh, wow. Hope, this is incredible.", "Hope: Are you happy?", "Wyatt: Are you kidding me? Yes, I'm thrilled. This is -- this is what I've always wanted from the start. Like, you know -- are you okay? Did you -- I mean, you -- I-I know that you were kind of -- you know, you didn't know if you were ready.", "Hope: No, Wyatt, I'm -- I'm excited.", "Wyatt: Okay.", "Hope: Yes. I am. I mean, I'm pregnant. How could I not be happy?", "Wyatt: I know, right? A-a baby. We did that. We created a life in there.", "Hope: [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] This is the greatest gift you could have ever given me. It's the best news I could have ever heard. I mean, we're gonna be parents. We're gonna have a kid. And...there is no one I would rather share this with than you.", "Hope: [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: I'm --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Both chuckle]", "Will: Cock-a-doo!", "[Laughter]", "Katie: I'm just so glad you were there today.", "Bill: I will always be there for will...", "Will: [Babbling]", "Bill: ...And you, too, Katie. I want a good relationship with you. No more negativity.", "Katie: I-I agree 100%. I mean, we have been through so much, and it hasn't been easy, but...", "Will: [Continues babbling]", "Katie: ...A day like today puts things in perspective, and we have to remember what's important. We are gonna get along for the sake of our children.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: You two have come a long way.", "Will: Uh-oh.", "Brooke: I mean, it's been a few complicated years -- that's for sure -- but divorce is difficult -- the shared custody and sacrifices and compromises. But you do it because you love will so much.", "Will: Mommy, help you.", "Brooke: You are excellent parents.", "Will: Mommy, help you.", "Brooke: And you love your son. I'm so proud of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I'm proud of you, too, Katie.", "Katie: [Chuckles]", "Bill: You're an amazing mom. You are fiercely protective of will -- his well- being. I mean, look at this kid.", "Brooke: [Chuckles]", "Bill: He is happy. He's healthy. Mm! He's thriving.", "Katie: [Chuckles]", "Will: Mommy.", "Bill: And that's because of you.", "Will: I play cars.", "Katie: [Chuckles] Well, it's because of both of us. I mean, I haven't always agreed with your choices, but you have always been an amazing father to will. You're there for him. You stand up for him, and you protect him, and that is all that matters to me.", "Bill: And you believe in me as a father. I can't tell you what that means to me. It's my greatest role in life.", "Katie: [Chuckles] Even better than being CEO? [Chuckles]", "Bill: [Chuckles] Yeah. Even better than being CEO -- by a long shot.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: We don't have to talk about this if you don't want to.", "Liam: No, I-I know. You and Aly are just trying to help. I just, uh -- I don't think I can give you any answers right now.", "Ivy: Yeah, well, I mean, if we're confused about this hope situation, I can't even imagine how you must be feeling.", "Liam: It's probably clearer to me than it is to anybody else...except Wyatt.", "Ivy: Do you think Wyatt knows?", "Liam: About what?", "Ivy: About the fact that you're the guy hope wants to be with.", "Liam: Oh. I -- listen, Ivy, even -- even if that were true, it's -- it's insignificant now.", "Ivy: [Sighs] Okay. Look, I understand that divorce is a big deal -- I do -- especially for hope. But why is she willing to sacrifice her happiness and her future? I mean, sure, on some level, she's in love with Wyatt, but why does she feel so tied to him, so obligated?", "Liam: There is a lot more that it might be the end of us. And I wouldn't blame you if you went back to Liam. I would have respected your decision. But deep down, I knew you wouldn't. That wasn't an option for you... 'cause you believe in me, and you believe in our marriage, and you believe in our relationship just much as I do. [Chuckles] You know, we took that leap of faith in Monte Carlo. We jumped right off the Stella Maris and right into a brand-new life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: It was a big leap.", "Wyatt: Huge.", "Hope: Yeah.", "Wyatt: It's much bigger than us. Baby -- we -- we created a life. We started a family. This baby changes everything. It's -- it's -- it's bigger than the two of us. This -- this -- this creates a deeper connection for us forever. You are my wife, hope, and you're gonna be the mother of my child, and... [Chuckles] ...I have never loved you more than I do right now.", "Hope: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: It'll be good for will to have a nice nap.", "Katie: Yeah, thankfully, he's still too young to fully realize what could have happened.", "Brooke: It does put in perspective what life is really about.", "Katie: [Sighs] I'm just so glad bill was there.", "Brooke: You know, there's something that I wanted to talk to you about. I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately, and I think I'm gonna make a few changes.", "Katie: Okay. Like what?", "Brooke: Well, I talked to Eric, and there's a job opening over there in Milan for a high-level position, so I think I'm gonna take it.", "Katie: You're moving to Italy?", "Brooke: I think it'd be good for me.", "Katie: Does bill know?", "Brooke: No. No, I haven't told him yet.", "Katie: Doesn't this seem a little extreme? I mean, where is this coming from?", "Brooke: I just need to get away. I need to regroup. I have done some things in my life that I'm not very proud of, been very selfish. [Sighs] And I'm sorry if I ever let you down.", "Katie: I'm -- I'm past all that, Brooke.", "Brooke: Katie, I stole your husband when you were sick. But I know what I did was wrong, and I want to try to make it up to you somehow.", "Katie: We've all moved on, Brooke.", "Brooke: You and bill -- you have your differences, but there's still a lot of love there. I know because I saw it today in the office when you bonded over will. It was very powerful.", "Katie: Well...yes, we are finally co-parenting in a positive way. We're doing what's best for will.", "Brooke: Yeah, and that's great. What if there could be more?", "Katie: What are you talking about?", "Brooke: I'm leaving town. I'm taking myself out of the equation. Bill is will's father. You're a family. I just want you to consider it. That's all I'm saying.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Is there something else going on? Wait -- did Quinn threaten hope?", "Liam: No. No. Although, it is Quinn, so you never know.", "Ivy: Hey, actually, speaking of Quinn, the craziest thing --", "[Cell phone beeps]", "Liam: What?", "Ivy: [Sighs] It's Eric. He, uh -- he wants me down at the photo room. Okay.", "Liam: It's okay. No problem. Whatever. Go do your thing.", "Ivy: Yeah, uh, look, this is, uh -- these are some of the pieces that Aly spoke to you about on the phone.", "Liam: Yes.", "Ivy: So, maybe just have a look-over over those.", "Liam: Okay. I will.", "Ivy: Liam, um, I'm really sorry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: I will love you forever. All of the things that have been taken from us -- they never took our memories.", "[Cell phone rings]", "Hope: Hi.", "Liam: Hey, can you talk?", "Hope: I-I just told Wyatt I'm pregnant. I'm -- I'm staying with him.", "Liam: Oh, okay. I understand. You know it's not possible for me to stop loving you, though.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Hope?", "Hope: I have to let you go.", "Wyatt: So, I was thinking about turning that little office we have into a nursery. It's got a great view for a baby.", "Hope: Yeah. [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: You're tearing up.", "Hope: Yeah.", "Wyatt: The floodgates are just -- I know.", "Hope: I know!", "Wyatt: I still can't believe it -- a baby! We're gonna be a family.", "Hope: Mm-hmm.", "Wyatt: I mean, full steam ahead. No turning back.", "Hope: No turning back.", "Wyatt: Ahh!
