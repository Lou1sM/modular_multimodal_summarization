        "Nick: We've got to tell her. We've got no choice here. We've got to tell your mother. Bridget --",
        "Bridget: I'm sorry, Nick. I know this very well could cost you your marriage. But I just -- I can't help being happy. I'm going to be a mother again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: What am I supposed to do? Really, Hector? I mean, Phoebe still feels guilty because she wants to help Shane. She's the one who hurt him. And Shane hasn't done anything. He hasn't threatened me. In fact, he's been nice.",
        "Hector: Taylor, don't kid yourself. That's just his way of worming into your life.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Stephanie: Hello. Don't we have to start making some plans?",
        "Taylor: Oh, I know, I know. Phoebe's birthday.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, hello, Hector. Are you still living here?",
        "Hector: Nice to hear from you, too, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Did you tell him?",
        "Taylor: About what?",
        "Stephanie: You and Thorne. He needs to know the truth or he's going to think he has the right to stay here. Thorne and Taylor are developing a relationship, Hector.",
        "Hector: Thank you for that, Stephanie. That's very nice. You want something to worry about? There's a person who's more of a threat to Taylor than I am, or ever will be. His name is Shane McGrath and he knows things that we all wish he didn't.",
        "Stephanie: Shane McGrath? What do you mean, he knows things?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Hey, be careful with your hand.",
        "Shane: Hey. Yeah, I know, the doctor told me to keep the circulation moving in it.",
        "Phoebe: Here's your breakfast.",
        "Shane: Whoa, look at that.",
        "Phoebe: Enjoy it.",
        "Shane: That looks really good. Hey, hey, hey, hang on. Phoebe, wait a second.",
        "Phoebe: I have to go, Shane.",
        "Shane: Wait, wait, wait, Phoebe -- Phoebe? Hey, don't be afraid of me. I already told you, I'm not going to say anything about the night that Darla got killed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Oh, there you are.",
        "Brooke: Oh, Jackie, hi. I was just in the middle of something --",
        "Jackie: No, no, no, I'm not going to keep you. I just wanted to say that -- Eric told me a moment ago that you and Nick renewed your wedding vows?",
        "Brooke: Yes, we did.",
        "Jackie: It's a bit unusual, isn't it? I mean, considering the fact you've just been married three months.",
        "Brooke: No, I know. It's just -- it was challenging. Ridge had pushed some buttons and there were some issues. But your son stood by me.",
        "Jackie: That's because my son absolutely adores you.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I wish I had appreciated that more than I did.",
        "Jackie: Well, Brooke, now you do. And I think it's marvelous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Do you think it's wrong for me to be happy about this child?",
        "Nick: No, no, I think that it's natural.",
        "Bridget: Well, how do you feel?",
        "Nick: A child is going to be born. And that's a beautiful thing, and much bigger than who should or shouldn't have what.",
        "Bridget: Yeah -- I just don't know that my mom is going to be that philosophical about it.",
        "Nick: Well, she may surprise you.",
        "Bridget: How?",
        "Nick: Well, we've talked about it, and she doesn't want to have any more children. I've accepted hers as my own and she just doesn't feel this overwhelming desire to be a mother again.",
        "Bridget: But Nick, this baby could cost you your marriage.",
        "Nick: Well, we don't know that. Not if your mother, somehow, understands. Maybe there's something that can work out for all of us here.",
        "Bridget: What are you talking about?",
        "Nick: Well, I don't know. I don't know, some sort of arrangement that suits everyone.",
        "Bridget: Nick --",
        "Nick: Well, we really don't have much choice, do we? I'm not going to lose your mother over this, Bridget. I just won't accept that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: It's just that you could say something, Shane. It's scary. I mean, I would lose my mother, she would definitely go to jail. I could even go to jail --",
        "Shane: Hey, hey, hey, phoebe. Phoebe, that's why I'm not going to let that happen, okay?",
        "Phoebe: Okay, you say that. Okay, you say that, but why would you come and pretend to be our gardener and just -- it doesn't make any sense.",
        "Shane: Listen, listen, all I did was clean up a little bit. I shaved, I combed my hair. It's not a big deal.",
        "Phoebe: Don't treat me like a stupid person.",
        "Shane: I'm not.",
        "Phoebe: You knew something extremely dangerous for my family and you didn't say a word.",
        "Shane: Phoebe, I just want to be your friend, okay?",
        "Phoebe: Do you not get that this is an extremely bizarre way of trying to become my friend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: How does this man know that you killed Darla?",
        "Taylor: Remember the homeless man that tried to help phoebe when her car broke down?",
        "Hector: He creeped her out, so she locked herself in the car until Darla got there.",
        "Stephanie: I remember.",
        "Taylor: That homeless man is Shane.",
        "Stephanie: Has he gone to the police?",
        "Taylor: No.",
        "Stephanie: Has he asked for money?",
        "Taylor: No.",
        "Stephanie: He will. That's what this has be about. Let's just hope that we can fix it with money or we're all going to go to jail. All of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: My marriage is in a very good place. See? I don't even have to knock on wood to say that.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Jackie: I'm so happy for you. And for myself, too. Well, isn't it natural that I should start looking forward to my first grandchild?",
        "Brooke: Yes, it is natural. But it's not going to happen.",
        "Jackie: Oh, don't say that.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry to disappoint you, Jackie.",
        "Jackie: But we both know how much Nick wants to have a child of his own.",
        "Brooke: Nick and I talked about it. He understands that I've already raised Rick and Bridget. And I still have a lot of work to do with Hope and R.J.",
        "Jackie: And you are a CEO of a company, on top of that. I do understand, Brooke. But I would be very careful about assuming that Nick is willing to drop this. It's been his dream for so long. I mean, he wants a child of his own, and you're the only one that can give him that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: You have no idea how much I just wish my mother would accept this pregnancy.",
        "Nick: Well, I've got to get her to accept it. She doesn't want to have children of her own anymore, Bridget --",
        "Bridget: Yeah, but Nick, this is just so different. I'm her daughter -- your ex-wife -- and I'm carrying your child.",
        "Nick: Well, what do you suggest we do? Go find a bridge and jump off of it? Lay our head on the track and wait for the evening train?",
        "Bridget: No, Nick, no --",
        "Nick: Well, then, let's be positive. We're gonna be parents. The two of us. Our DNA, the real thing. And it doesn't matter what mistake led up to this. Your mother will understand. She knows how much I want to have a child. She knows how much I love her. That's the way I look at it. That's the way I choose to look at it.",
        "Bridget: Okay.",
        "Nick: Okay. We'll make it work. I feel these tingling sensations",
        "Bridget: Nick, I feel like you're trying to -- you're even fantasizing about making the best out of a situation that just is not okay.",
        "Nick: Well, let's not forget your mother hasn't lived the most conventional life. If anybody can understand, she can. I say we tell the truth and we hope for the best.",
        "Bridget: Do you want me there when you tell her?",
        "Nick: I should probably do this alone, okay?",
        "Bridget: It's your call. You do know how she's going to react, don't you?",
        "Nick: Well, I'll just have to let her go there. And bring her back safely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Look, if it's help you need, I'd be happy to pitch in. In fact, I would be delighted.",
        "Brooke: Thank you, Jackie. But Nick and I have come to a decision.",
        "Jackie: Are you sure it's not your decision, and that he loves you enough just to go along with it?",
        "Brooke: Well, that happens a lot in a good marriage.",
        "Jackie: You know what I'm saying. When Nick lost Nicole, it was just --",
        "Brooke: Jackie, no. Having a child with me will not replace Nicole in Nick's heart. But helping me raise Hope, that will fulfill his need. You'll see. If Nick really wanted a child, he would tell me. But he doesn't, and neither do I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Phoebe, come on. Admit it. If I'd shown up looking the way I did that night, you guys would have slammed the door right in my face.",
        "Phoebe: But -- but, if you had told us what you saw from the beginning, then none of this would be a problem, right?",
        "Shane: Oh, come on, look at you. You'd be acting the way you are right now, all paranoid. I just wanted to give you a chance to get to know me first. To see that I'm only trying to protect you. Hey, phoebe, I just want to be a part of your life, okay?",
        "Phoebe: Let's just see how it goes, okay? I have to go change. My grandmother's coming to see me.",
        "Shane: Wait, wait, your grandmother's coming?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, she wants to plan my 18th birthday party. Go eat your food. It's getting cold, I'm sure.",
        "[Shane daydreaming]",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, I'm going to be 18. Legally an adult. I can make my own adult decisions.",
        "Shane: We could really have some fun with that.",
        "Phoebe: We could.",
        "Shane: Couldn't we?",
        "Phoebe: Because, my first decision is that I want to be free.",
        "Shane: Yeah?",
        "Phoebe: Grown up. And I don't want you to leave. Ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Stephanie, believe me, I wish Shane knew nothing about any of this. But he's here. I don't know, maybe I'm just trying to convince myself to trust him.",
        "Stephanie: Well, go ahead, but I won't.",
        "Hector: A friend of mine did a background check on him. He's got a restraining order against him in Atlanta --",
        "Taylor: There's an explanation for that, Hector.",
        "Hector: Maybe, Taylor, but have you ever had a restraining order against you? Or has anybody else that you know? I mean, the guy was arrested for theft the same night as Darla's accident, right here in LA, and he never showed up for his arraignment.",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, from everything that he's just said, this boy -- this boy sounds like big trouble. I think we have to get him out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Well, you and my son have only been married for a short while, so who knows? Maybe you'll change your mind.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry, Jackie, it's not going to happen. And Nick understands. The last thing I need in my life right now is another child.",
        "Taylor: What am I supposed to do, Stephanie? I can't just throw Shane out on the street.",
        "Stephanie: Maybe you're right. Maybe that's too dangerous to do.",
        "Hector: If I could see, I'd get a hold of that guy --",
        "Stephanie: No, please. Let's not have any of that. He'll just end up going to the police, and then we really will be in trouble.",
        "Hector: I covered her tracks pretty well.",
        "Stephanie: I think we have to find a way to neutralize this fellow --",
        "Taylor: Just don't do anything to make him angry. Listen, I've got to take Hector to a doctor appointment and we have to go right now or we'll be late. The car's waiting outside, I'm sure. Come on.",
        "Stephanie: I'm going to wait and see phoebe and talk to her about what she wants to do for her birthday.",
        "Taylor: Okay, all right. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Hello.",
        "Shane: Hi. I believe I'm the fellow you're going to neutralize.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, Mr. McGrath. And exactly what is it that you think you want, Mr. McGrath.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Bridget remembering]",
        "Bridget: Oh, you fought so hard.",
        "Nick: I should have been here. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Bridget: It's okay. That's not going to happen to you. Mommy's not going to let that happen. And your daddy won't either. God, please, Nick -- please just convince my mom this isn't the end of the world. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Nicky, we were just talking about you.",
        "Brooke: Your mother's disappointed that we're not having children. Could you please explain it to her?",
        "Jackie: I am not interfering, all right? I just know how disappointed you must be, too.",
        "Nick: I need to talk to Brooke, Mother.",
        "Jackie: You're asking me to leave?",
        "Nick: Would you mind? I love you.",
        "Jackie: You know I love you, too.",
        "Brooke: Bye, Jackie. So, what's up?",
        "Nick: There's something I have to tell you.",
        "Brooke: Okay, well, I have a meeting, but I could cancel it. Is something wrong?",
        "Nick: Yeah, but potentially wonderful, depending how you choose to look at it.",
        "Brooke: Well, I will certainly will do my best.",
        "Nick: I know you will. Life's funny, you know. It can really throw some curve balls. Especially when the unexpected happens. It seems frightening at first, but so many good things can come out of it. And I believe facing it head-on -- is the best way to -- to face those fears. And they turn out to be blessings.",
        "Brooke: Okay, now you're making me a little bit nervous.",
        "Nick: Just remember, we love each other, right? And we've worked very hard at building a life together for you and for me, and for your children. And nothing is going to take that away. I won't let it.",
        "Brooke: Nick, what are you talking about? What are you trying to tell me?"
