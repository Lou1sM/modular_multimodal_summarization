        "Ridge: Hey. You're making me nervous.",
        "Caroline: [Voice breaking] Well, I'm -- I'm the one that needs to be nervous, because I... I have to make you understand. [Exhales sharply]",
        "Ridge: I think I do understand. You want to tell me something.",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: So, did you already pack your bags, or...do I get a chance to try to convince you to stay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: You know, I was afraid to do this short, but... it looks like it works.",
        "Sarah: I noticed you haven't RSVP'd.",
        "Thomas: I think dad's gonna question this neckline a little bit.",
        "Sarah: I hope you're not waiting around for better options. You might hurt my feelings. My birthday this weekend. Have you forgotten?",
        "Thomas: Uh... pool party. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I remember.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, well, unless it's too cold out. Then we'll all just crowd into my hot tub.",
        "Thomas: No. Never too cold. I love a hot tub.",
        "Sarah: Great.",
        "Thomas: Would you...pass some notes down to the sewing room when you're done?",
        "Sarah: Sure thing. Oh, and no presents, please. Seeing you in a swimsuit will be gift enough.",
        "Steffy: She's hot.",
        "Thomas: What?",
        "Steffy: You heard me. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Really. Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: You're...welcome? [Chuckling] What did I do?",
        "Ivy: For supporting me. You do. Everything with Aly and that video. I mean, I really did -- I went off-course, but...you stood by me. And then I lost my job. Everything with Liam and Steffy. I gave you plenty of chances to give up on me, and it probably would have been smarter for you to have done that, but you didn't. So, thanks.",
        "Wyatt: Give up on you?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: No. Not a chance.",
        "Wyatt: I'm here for you, Ivy. You get that, right?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I'm starting to.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not my brother.",
        "Ivy: Oh, I'm starting to get that, too.",
        "Wyatt: Good.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Good. I just -- I don't know. I kind of think maybe...it's hard for you to trust people because of him.",
        "Ivy: Hmm. Now, what would make you say that? Do you think it has something to do with the fact that he professed his love to me with his fingers crossed behind his back while he was waiting for Steffy to come back from Europe? Is that what you're referring to?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Yeah. That's about it. I think you got it.",
        "Ivy: Look, um... okay, Liam did make it very hard for me to trust people, but... I'm not worried about that. 'Cause you're making it very easy again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Oh, tough life you have, fighting off all these beautiful models.",
        "Thomas: It's...not fighting them off.",
        "Steffy: You're taking after Dad, if the legends are true.",
        "Thomas: What?",
        "Steffy: Come on. Remember when he was younger, all those stories of him breaking all these models' hearts?",
        "Thomas: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Steffy: Relax. I'm not trying to insult you or anything.",
        "Thomas: Then maybe don't compare me to Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Please don't. Please don't give up on us. I should have told you about the vasectomy, and I should have told you about --",
        "Caroline: No. I'm not leaving you. I'm your wife. I meant -- I meant every word of our vows. I don't care about the vasectomy. I don't. That's not entirely true. I do. I wish I... I wish you had told me what you meant when you said that you couldn't give me children. I wish... I believe you, because I know that you just didn't want me to worry, and... you thought you could fix it on your own and take care of it. And right now, I really wish that I could do the same for you. There's something that I-I wish that I could protect you from. [Crying] But it's not an easy fix. And I really can't handle it on my own, and I just need my husband. If you're willing, I just need you to --",
        "Ridge: Willing? You're the most important thing in the world to me. I would do anything.",
        "Caroline: Okay, well, I think you might take that back when you hear what I have to say.",

        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: Like, we were -- we were right there in front of each other for so long, and we just didn't see it.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not sure. But... [Clears throat] It doesn't matter. Because we see it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Whoa. What's the matter with you?",
        "Thomas: Nothing.",
        "Steffy: So, you're just foaming at the mouth for no reason at the mention of Dad? Come on. Why are you so down on him? Does he even know you're this angry?",
        "Thomas: Probably, since I punched him in the face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You can tell me anything you want. I'm here for you.",
        "Caroline: I hope so. I-I... I just... but I don't know. I don't know how to say it. I-I... [Sniffles]",
        "Ridge: Um... are you sick?",
        "Caroline: No.",
        "Ridge: Okay, good. Then it can't be that bad. So, what is it? Just tell me.",
        "Caroline: [Sniffles] It's about the night, uh, that you broke up with me.",
        "Ridge: You're still upset about that night, and you should be. You have every right to be. It's -- it's, um --",
        "Caroline: I was just really confused. You know, 'cause I didn't understand. I just -- um, how you could just end things 'cause I wanted a family.",
        "Ridge: I know. I don't understand it, either. You -- you just -- [Sighs] I-I wanted your life to be fulfilled. I wanted -- I have so many regrets about that night.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I do, too. I have a lot of regrets about that night. It was the worst night of my life.",
        "Ridge: Well, if I could do things differently, you know I would. I-I would. I would.",
        "Caroline: I would do things differently, too. You know, I would -- I would -- I would. Starting with the pills.",
        "Ridge: With the pills?",
        "Caroline: I took some -- I took some pills.",
        "Ridge: What do you -- what do you mean? You took pills? What does that mean? You took pills because you --",
        "Caroline: No, no. Not like -- not like that. I was, um -- I was just freaking out, and I was alone in a hotel room. And...I had found some of Pam's pills earlier. And I had them in my purse, because I was gonna give them to her. And I just thought maybe I could just take a few, and they would relax me. Maybe I could sleep or something. And...I just didn't realize how hard they would hit me.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Caroline: Especially if I, um, added some wine to them. And I --",
        "Ridge: You took pills and you drank wine?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I know.",
        "Ridge: Come on.",
        "Caroline: I know. It's stupid. I know. It was stupid. I was just hurting. I was in, um -- in pain.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, because of what I did to you that night.",
        "Caroline: Stop it. Just stop it. Just stop, please. [Sniffles] God. What happened was not your fault. It was just the combination of the wine and pills. And, uh, I-I don't really remember a lot after. Especially after he showed up.",
        "Ridge: After he showed up?",
        "Caroline: I think he was -- you know, he was just trying to comfort me, and -- and... and he misunderstood, and...",
        "Ridge: He spent the night with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Singer: Where did you come from? And where do we go from here? Won't let me out of your arms' reach afraid that I'll disappear forget about everyone else and remember me remember me escape your safe reality join my dangerous dream come a little closer to me crave your skin on my skin you're everything that I shouldn't need so won't you be my sin?

        "Thomas: He started getting all judgmental. He was -- he was just laying into me.",
        "Steffy: Okay, he's our dad. It's part of the job description.",
        "Thomas: I don't deserve that anymore, all right? He started calling me a selfish, entitled, little brat! I've been working hard! I mean, coming from him... could you imagine if I really did take whatever I wanted?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: He didn't realize...",
        "Ridge: Didn't realize what? That you were drunk? Were on drugs? He didn't -- didn't realize it, huh?",
        "Caroline: [Sniffles]",
        "Ridge: Is this what you wanted? Was it consensual? Was it?",
        "Caroline: [Sniffles] I was really, really out of it, and he didn't know.",
        "Ridge: He didn't know, huh? Who did it? What kind of man does that? Who -- who is he?",

        "Caroline: I was just out of it, and... [Sniffles] And he misread everything, and... Ridge, I would never... not even -- not even if we were broken up. I would never...",
        "Ridge: It was me. It was my fault. I-I, uh... I should have been there for you. Should have been me. I should have been there. I'm glad you told me, you know. I -- it's... I wish you would have told me before.",
        "Caroline: I couldn't. 'Cause I was ashamed of it. I couldn't tell you that. How could I tell you that? [Sniffles]",

        "Steffy: Hello! Potential lawsuit! Dad had every right to lecture you!",
        "Thomas: Okay, I shouldn't have punched him in the face. I'm fully aware of that. I crossed a line, okay? But he's acting like I'm some immature brat that's just taking whatever woman I want, which is the last thing... Dad has no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: What do you mean, there's more?",
        "Caroline: I just... if I could put this all behind me and just pretend like it didn't happen, I would. I really would. I want to do that.",
        "Ridge: But?",
        "Caroline: Um... it's really complicated 'cause he's... um...",
        "Ridge: He's what? Look at me. You can tell me. You have feelings for this guy? Is that where you want to be?",
        "Caroline: No. [Sniffles] No. He's a friend. [Sniffles]",
        "Ridge: A friend wouldn't do that to you.",
        "Caroline: I know. He's... [Sighs] It's so hard to say. It's hard to explain. I... [Sniffles] But I have to, 'cause things have changed, and I have to tell you now.",
        "Ridge: What's changed? What has changed? We're married now. You're my wife. That's changed. And you know that we can't have a baby together. That's changed. Is that what that is?",
        "Caroline: In a way.",
        "Ridge: In a way?",
        "Caroline: [Sniffles]",
        "Ridge: You know what? If -- if we can't make this work, if you can't live without having a baby...",
        "Caroline: No, I told you I accepted that, and I was okay with it. I told you that.",
        "Ridge: Then what is it? This guy's back in your life, and -- and what? He changed your mind about me, about us?",
        "Caroline: [Voice breaking] You don't understand.",
