        "Bridget: Is this true, Mother?",
        "Stephanie: It's true. She's trying to take your husband away from you.",
        "Brooke: No, I'm not!",
        "Stephanie: I'm sorry that you had to find out this way. But if the marriage isn't real --",
        "Bridget: I want to hear it from you! Were you with my husband today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: All right, girls, I think these look great. I'm really happy. Thank you for doing this. Um -- this goes down a bit.",
        "Eric: Ridge? What are you still doing here?",
        "Ridge: Hey, Dad. I just got a burst of creative energy tonight.",
        "Eric: Yes, I guess you did. For the teen line, huh?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. What do you think?",
        "Eric: I think Thomas made a big mistake agreeing to this challenge, that's what I think.",
        "Ridge: I hope you're right. This is not just a fashion showdown to me.",
        "Eric: I know exactly what you mean.",
        "Ridge: Girls, thank you. Let's pick this up tomorrow.",
        "Eric: Nerve-wracking, isn't it?",
        "Ridge: I know. There's got to be an easier way to convince your kids to do what's best for them.",
        "Eric: You're telling the man who couldn't protect his own kids from their own mother?",
        "Ridge: Dad, mother did a lot of damage. But I had to take responsibility for my own life. So I agreed to go to counseling with Taylor.",
        "Eric: Really? Oh, good. I think that's a step in the right direction.",
        "Ridge: Well, I had to do something to get my marriage back on track here. And it's something Taylor needed me to do. The truth is, I think I needed it, too. In case you hadn't noticed, I have a few issues.",
        "Eric: Is Brooke one of them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Nick remembering ]",
        "Brooke: Come to me.",
        "Massimo: Dominick?",
        "Nick: Hey, Pop.",
        "Massimo: You all right?",
        "Nick: Yeah, yeah. Just a little lost in thought.",
        "Massimo: About Brooke? Can't seem to get her out of your mind, huh?",
        "Nick: I will.",
        "Massimo: You're a strong man, my son. But you know, you may not be strong enough to fight this battle alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Honey, please, don't get upset. Think about your baby. You really shouldn't be getting stressed out right now.",
        "Bridget: I just want someone to tell me exactly what's going on.",
        "Stephanie: I just did.",
        "Brooke: She's trying to twist everything around. What she said about Nick and me, that is not true.",
        "Bridget: So then you weren't together today?",
        "Stephanie: Answer her.",
        "Brooke: Yes, we were. But we just happened to run into each other.",
        "[ Stephanie scoffs ]",
        "Stephanie: In Big Bear.",
        "Bridget: And this is why you think that they're involved?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous, isn't it? Nick and I were just talking.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I'm sure you and deacon had plenty to talk about, too. Listen to what I'm telling you, Bridget. Don't bury your head in the sand. She's going to take your husband away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Brooke needs to get on with her life. It's time for me to do the same.",
        "Eric: You two are connected, though. You have a child together, a long history together -- a history that your wife is obviously very sensitive to.",
        "Ridge: We'll have to get into all that in counseling.",
        "Eric: Well, be sure you do. If something like that is left to fester, you and your wife could end up like your mother and me.",
        "Ridge: I've been meaning to talk to you about that.",
        "[ Intercom buzzes ]",
        "Eric: Security? Yes? He is? Oh, good. Thank you. Your brother is on his way up. You'd better cover this stuff up. He told security to give us a warning.",
        "Ridge: Great.",
        "[ Knock on door ]",
        "Thorne: All clear?",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Ridge: Thanks for the warning.",
        "Thorne: I had a feeling you two would be burning the midnight oil.",
        "Ridge: Just so you don't have my son doing the same thing.",
        "Thorne: Oh, no need. We're -- we're right on schedule.",
        "Eric: All right, you two. Save the competition for the runway. What brings you by?",
        "Thorne: Well, Darla and I would like to invite you to dinner. See, my wife seems to think that you're going to starve to death living at the beach by yourself.",
        "Ridge: I also heard that mother hired a new cook. So you might swing by there and test out the cuisine?",
        "Eric: What, and risk running into your mother?",
        "Ridge: She's not there.",
        "Eric: You're not saying she moved out?",
        "Ridge: No, she's just staying at the cabin for a little while.",
        "Thorne: You've been in contact with her?",
        "Ridge: She wants to turn over a new leaf, put this vendetta against Brooke behind her.",
        "Eric: And you believe her?",
        "Ridge: Well, I want to, yeah. But it depends if she can accept responsibility for her actions and let go of this obsession she's got for Brooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Massimo: You have got to let this go, son. You have got to forget about Brooke.",
        "Nick: I'm trying! When I focus, if I focus on Bridget, I'm fine. I remember what we have. I remember how special she is, how important the things that we have together are.",
        "Massimo: Yes, but the moment that you are away from her, the first thing your mind goes right back to Brooke.",
        "Nick: No, no I'm not gonna let that happen.",
        "Massimo: What if you're ambushed one day while you're with Bridget, huh? What if you happen to run into Brooke? Listen, Dominick, you're not in control of your emotions right now, okay? They're all upside down. You can't risk a chance encounter like this.",
        "Nick: Now it's too late.",
        "Massimo: Tell me that you didn't go to see her after we talked.",
        "Nick: I left town, like you asked. And you were right, I went away to be alone and think. I went where Bridget and I fell in love, to Big Bear.",
        "Massimo: But Brooke was there.",
        "Nick: We said good-bye, pop. It's over. We said our good-byes.",
        "Massimo: Look at this. But you're still thinking about her. You still want her.",
        "Nick: I do not have to act on every need and desire that I have.",
        "Massimo: But simply suppressing them doesn't make them go away. Dominick, there's only one real solution. You have got to distance yourself from Brooke -- you, Bridget, and the baby. As much as it kills me to say this, you have got to leave Los Angeles, for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Remember the conversation that you and I had the night that you found out you were pregnant?",
        "Bridget: I was upset and confused.",
        "Stephanie: No, no, you saw the truth. For one moment there, you clearly saw exactly who your mother is. Now you know what she's gonna say to you. \"Honey, Nick and I never meant to hurt you. It's not what you think.\"",
        "Brooke: It's not! Honey, you've got to believe me.",
        "Stephanie: What reason? What good reason have you ever given this girl to believe you or trust you?",
        "Brooke: We've had our problems, and I've made my mistakes. But we're past that now.",
        "Stephanie: No, it's happening all over again.",
        "Brooke: No, Stephanie!",
        "Stephanie: Yes! Yes, it is. You know what she's gonna say. \"I'm just following my heart.\" Well, a mother's heart belongs with her child. You know that now. You're carrying your own child. You understand now what that bond is. Your mother broke that bond just like that for a quick roll in the hay! Is this the kind of woman that you really can trust?",
        "Bridget: You're just out to get my mother. You always, always have been.",
        "Stephanie: I know what I saw. And at the hospital, after hope's accident, you know what you saw, too. Only at Big Bear, they weren't afraid someone was going to walk in on them. They thought that they were alone.",
        "Bridget: Did you kiss him?",
        "Brooke: No! No! Damn it, Stephanie! This is enough! You've done this to me too long. The bullying, the manipulation! You destroyed my marriage! Well, I'm not going to let you destroy hers! Get out! Get out! I've had it with you, Stephanie! I won't let you do this anymore!",
        "Thorne: That sounds like mom and Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Oh, no!",
        "Bridget: Mother, stop!",
        "Brooke: I want you out of this office and out of our lives!",
        "Eric: What are you doing?! What are you doing?!",
        "Bridget: Dad, stop them!",
        "Ridge: What the hell's going on?!",
        "Stephanie: Brooke is up to her old tricks again. She's trying to steal Nick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: L.A. is Bridget's home. I can't take her away from her family.",
        "Massimo: You are her family now. You and the child, okay? And you've got to do what is best for them. You've got to get away as far as possible from Brooke.",
        "Nick: Bridget's not gonna want to leave.",
        "Massimo: Well, all right, fine. Make it my decision, all right? I'll send you overseas. I'll give you a new position.",
        "Nick: How am I going to explain this, pop? Think about it. No Christmases here, no Thanksgiving, holidays? Brooke will never see her grandchild? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Massimo: If it means keeping your family together, yes!",
        "Nick: There's got to be another way. There has to be, and I'm gonna find it.",
        "Massimo: What makes you think you're gonna succeed when Eric and Thorne and Ridge never succeeded?",
        "Nick: Because I'm a man of my word, and I gave it to Bridget. These desires for Brooke will go away. Bridget won't have anything to worry about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Brooke, what is she talking about?",
        "Brooke: Nothing.",
        "Stephanie: I saw her today with Nick up at Big Bear.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, we happened to run into each other, by accident. It wasn't planned. It wasn't a rendezvous.",
        "Ridge: Of course it wasn't. That's crazy.",
        "Stephanie: Crazier than two people meeting at exactly the same place at exactly the same time?",
        "Brooke: I needed to go up there and clear my head.",
        "Eric: What was Nick doing up there?",
        "Brooke: He was thinking about Bridget. He said that's where they fell in love.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my god.",
        "Ridge: Mother, what are you doing here? A few hours ago, you swore to me you weren't going to be acting like this. Nick and Bridget are married, they're expecting their first child.",
        "Stephanie: Well, you don't have to tell me. Tell her.",
        "Brooke: I know how much this marriage means to Bridget.",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, you know, but you don't care. Not if it keeps you from getting what you want. You have ruined all of our lives, our marriages, our families. Eric, you have got to keep her from doing this to your daughter again.",
        "Bridget: She's not doing anything to me, or my baby! My marriage is not in jeopardy. It's not. Do you know why I came here tonight? I came here to get these real estate printouts. Nick wanted them. We were having an incredible evening together planning our future -- our family's future. For the sake of my child, I am making a choice to trust my husband, and my mother.",
        "Thorne: Mom, you gotta stop this.",
        "Stephanie: I know what I saw, honey.",
        "Eric: And you didn't waste a second telling Bridget all about it, knowing the pain these doubts cause her.",
        "Stephanie: Better that she knows what's going on.",
        "Eric: What Bridget needs right now is to take care of herself and her baby. And if you're not going to help her do that, then I don't want you anywhere near her. This family has begun to heal since you've been gone. None of us wants you around here if you're going to continue acting like this.",
        "Stephanie: You just can't see it. You just can't see what Brooke's doing, can you, Eric?",
        "Eric: Brooke is a member of this family and of this company. And until you get your priorities straight, you are not.",
        "Stephanie: This family has always been my priority.",
        "Ridge: Then you know what you need to do to be a part of it, don't you?",
        "Stephanie: Yes. I know what I have to do.",
        "Brooke: Don't listen to what Stephanie is saying, all right, sweetheart? Because it's not true. I love you, and so does Nick. And you're going to have an amazing life ahead of you.",
        "Ridge: Is Bridget all right?",
        "Brooke: She said she needed to drive around for a little while.",
        "Thorne: Don't blame her, after the things mom said about you and Nick.",
        "Brooke: Well, she's wrong. I hope you all know that.",
        "Ridge: Are you kidding? That's absurd.",
        "Eric: All right. I just had Stephanie banned from the building.",
        "Brooke: You didn't have to do that.",
        "Eric: I don't want to her here.",
        "Brooke: Well, I should've just left and taken Bridget with me.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, this is your office. Mother had no right to barge in here and accost you like that.",
        "Brooke: Thank you all for believing me, and in Nick and Bridget.",
        "Thorne: Well, right now, I'm more worried about mom. I mean, you would think by the way the family reacted to what she did to Ridge that she would have learned her lesson by now.",
        "Ridge: I thought she had.",
        "Eric: I just hope that what we said had some kind of an impact on her. And hopefully she'll realize how destructive she's being and that she'll put this whole vendetta behind her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Oh, god, this can't be good.",
        "Stephanie: Happy to see you, too, Nick.",
        "Nick: I just -- I mean, you haven't been around much lately, Stephanie. Been kind of nice.",
        "Stephanie: For you and Brooke.",
        "Nick: 'Scuze me?",
        "Stephanie: Nick, I know exactly what's going on. Brooke's in her usual state of denial, but I know you're still in love with her.",
        "[ Nick laughs ]",
        "Nick: Do you ever wonder why no one's happy to see you, Stephanie?",
        "Stephanie: I saw the two of you in Big Bear today. I didn't realize that you were sneaking around behind Bridget's back.",
        "Nick: There's nothing romantic between Brooke and me.",
        "Stephanie: I don't believe you. Unfortunately, Bridget does.",
        "Nick: What do you want?",
        "Stephanie: Leave her, Nick. She can handle the truth now, but you have to tell her. You have to tell her before the baby comes.",
        "Nick: Maybe you don't know this, but Bridget's my wife now. She's having my child. I won't abandon her.",
        "Stephanie: Your good intentions are not helping her.",
        "Nick: And these accusations of yours aren't helping anyone either.",
        "Stephanie: Bridget will listen to you. She'll believe you. Tell her the truth. Tell her you're still in love with her mother.",
        "Nick: Making a lot of assumptions here, aren't you, Stephanie?",
        "Stephanie: I don't hear you denying it.",
        "Nick: Well, do you expect me to dignify this insanity?",
        "Stephanie: You know, I don't blame you, actually, not entirely. You've got to be strong here, honey. You have to do the right thing. You've got to be a man, a real man, and do what is best for your wife and your child.",
        "Nick: That's what I'm doing.",
        "Stephanie: No, you're not. You're deceiving her, and you're deceiving yourself.",
        "Bridget: You?",
        "Stephanie: Hi, Bridget. Believe it or not, I'm here for your own good.",
        "Bridget: No, you're not. Didn't you hear anything that everyone was telling you back there?",
        "Stephanie: Bridget, I can accept losing my family if I know that you're safe, if I know that you see the truth. Nick, tell her. Tell your wife that you're still in love with her mother."
