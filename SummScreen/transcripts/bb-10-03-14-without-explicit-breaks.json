        "Quinn tells Hope that she can't do that. She's the baby's grandmother; she has rights. Hope says she can do it. She does not want Quinn in her baby's life. Perhaps the child will have Quinn's eyes as she can not control that. What she can control is not having her in the baby's life and having anything to do with it's mental wellbeing. And that's the way it has to be. Quinn sees that she is serious. Quinn says she sees Hope is still upset with her. Hope says no, it is more than being upset. Quinn says she knows she was a bad, bad girl and Hope needs to punish her but this is not the way to do it. Someday her child will thank her. Hope says no because she is not going to get that opportunity as Quinn will have nothing to do with her child. Bill repeats what Brooke told him. She is leaving today for the Milan office. He says not without him. She can go home and pack as they are not coming back until they are married. Aly giggles when she tells Oliver that Pam is excited about the dinner tonight and she thinks it has to do with Ivy ..and she is bringing Liam. Ivy thanks Liam for telling her that Hope is pregnant. All along she though Hope was just crazy. They laugh at going to the party tonight and she won't hear of Liam not going and leaving her alone with Pam and her lemon bars. John is welcomed by Eric and then Aly who he says he has not seen since she was a little ankle biter. He makes mention of \"the boyfriend\". Then he looks at the portrait of Stephanie. Eric says she is keeping them in line. John winks and says she always did. Ivy comes in and is surprised to see her dad in town. They sit around and reminisce. Charlie brings out the medieval turkey legs and Aly explains to John about their joisting. John says he used to love that too. Ivy sticks a lemon bar in his mouth before he can go on more about his three marriages and her mom. John tells Pam she should be sharing these. Eric says she does every day. John says he meant with the world. He could set her up in a business. Think big, her face on the box of lemon bars. He says a face like hers could sell anything. She eats it up; Charlie not so much. He seems to approve of Liam as a good kid. Eric says with Aly and Ivy both there this house is like a home again.",
        "Brooke re-emphasizes that she is going to Milan alone. She sees things differently; the way she should have a long time ago. She tells him that Hope is pregnant but not to tell anyone as she might not have told Wyatt yet. And yes she will stay in constant contact with Hope during this time. He tells her that he will also always be there for Will but just not as a couple with Katie. Brooke says sometimes they just need to stop and take a deep breath. She only has one shot in this life and this time she wants to get it right. Quinn tells Hope that obviously her hormones are out of whack. She's not herself speaking to her this way. They are family now and Hope can not exclude her. Wyatt would never allow it. Hope says Wyatt has a wife and a baby now that take priority. They will come first. Quinn can not be shocked at that. And that is where Wyatt is right now. He went to see Quinn to tell her exactly what Hope is telling her. Quinn tells her that Hope joined her family so if anyone is going to be setting boundaries it will be Quinn. Saved by the bell ..the phone rings. It's Wyatt. Quinn tells Hope that she will not leave until Hope apologizes for speaking to her that way. Hope tells Wyatt not to wait at the warehouse. His mother is at their house right now. She's not taking it very well what Hope just told her and that Wyatt would agree, but she thinks she has it all under control. Quinn points her finger at Hope and says Wyatt will never cut her out of his life. That is all Hope and she is not going to let her get away with this. Brooke tells Bill that she wants him to take this time to figure out what is best for him. He says he is looking at it. He explains that he and Katie could never go back to what they were. Brooke is not stealing him from Katie. She is happy with Ridge. Brooke says she does not know that. They aren't married yet. Agitated, Bill tells her Brooke is not in the way. They don't have to fight their feelings anymore. He tells her that she is right. They have one shot in this life so please do not get away from him. She tells him that she is not giving up on anything. She is gaining .gaining insight and respect. That is what she wants Will to see, both parents loving and adoring each other the way they were before Aspen. Bill says there is no chance. She says there is always a chance. She has to go now. He grabs her and says she is not leaving him. He kisses her. She allows him to but then walks out. Liam tells Ivy that he is glad he came. They can't all have fun parents. And that is why he is worried about Hope .because of Quinn. She turns on people and he can't imagine what will happen if she turns on Hope. Quinn tells Hope that she has been the most important person in Wyatt's life since day one. And that is the reason he will never cut her out of his life now with a baby on the way. Hope questions Quinn ever being in therapy and tells her not to be so shocked as it is probably just another lie like so many she has told. Quinn says she loves Hope and she is her daughter-in-law but when she talks like this to her, it makes her so angry. So do not try to cut her out of this baby's life, \"Missy\" as that would be a mistake, a very big mistake!"

        "Quinn: You don't mean that.",
        "Hope: Yes, I do. You won't be in our baby's life.",
        "Quinn: But I'm the grandmother.",
        "Hope: Biologically, yes, you are, so maybe it will have your eyes or something, but that's -- that's what I can't control. What I can control is any influence you have on my child's mental well-being. You cannot be in our child's life, and that is just the way it has to be.",
        "Bill: You're leaving?",
        "Brooke: I'm needed in the Milan office indefinitely.",
        "Bill: Okay. Well, I can work remotely.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] You're needed here, bill. I'm leaving today.",
        "Bill: Not without me, you're not.",

        "Oliver: Pam again?",
        "Aly: Confirming we're pre-heating the oven. She's really excited about dinner tonight -- more than usual. She, uh, said that there's a special surprise.",
        "Oliver: Let me guess -- a new recipe?",
        "Aly: Probably.",
        "Oliver: [Chuckles]",
        "Aly: [Chuckles] Whatever it is, I think it has something to do with Ivy. Pam was all giggly and speaking in a horrible Australian accent when she told me.",
        "Oliver: Ivy's coming?",
        "Aly: Yeah, and Liam, too...",
        "Oliver: Liam.",
        "Aly: ...If she can convince him. [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: Well, I'm glad you told me this. I -- God, I honestly thought that hope was just crazy.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: I mean, to go back to Wyatt and to stay with him, knowing what Quinn had done? Well, I guess that's what happens when a baby is involved.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Hey. You can't say no to this party.",
        "Liam: Uh, well, I think --",
        "Ivy: Come on. It's pam.",
        "Liam: [Groans]",
        "Ivy: Pam is throwing it. We don't know what's gonna happen. There could be medieval knights there with lances made out of lemon bars.",
        "Liam: [Snickers]",
        "Ivy: You gonna let me walk into that alone?",
        "Liam: No. [Chuckling] Ohh. All right.",
        "Bill: You're leaving today? Just like that?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] It's not something I can just put off. I mean, it's a delicate situation. Can't just send anybody. Ridge has to stay here. He has to design, and Rick -- gosh, he's --",
        "Bill: I don't give a damn about Ridge or Rick or anybody else. You're needed in Milan? Fine. Then I'm needed, too. So go home, start packing, make sure you include a white dress, because we're not coming back until we're married.",
        "John: Alexandria! [Chuckles] Darling, the last time I saw you, you were just a little ankle biter.",
        "Aly: Yeah, well, I'm all grown up.",
        "Pam: Tell me the oven is on.",
        "Aly: Yes, yes. Set for 425.",
        "Pam: Okay. Charlie, come on. Let's go.",
        "Charlie: Gangway. Hot stuff coming through.",
        "Aly: I didn't even know you were in town.",
        "John: [Sighs]",
        "Oliver: Ah, this must be Pam's surprise.",
        "Aly: Ah. Oliver, this is my uncle john.",
        "John: The boyfriend, huh?",
        "Aly: Yes, the -- the boyfriend.",
        "John: Eric's brother. Pleased to meet you. I got the looks. He got the talent. [Chuckles] Yowza! Give a man a heart attack.",
        "Eric: Stephanie's keeping an eye on me.",
        "John: Always her specialty.",
        "[Light laughter]",
        "John: Where's my little Ivy?",
        "Aly: Does she know you're in town?",
        "Ivy: Dad? [Chuckles]",
        "John: She does now.",
        "Ivy: Hi!",
        "John: Ah, sweetheart.",
        "Ivy: Oh, good to see you. [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: You're still upset with me?",
        "Hope: No, this is more than being upset.",
        "Quinn: I was a bad, bad girl, and you need to punish me, but this isn't the way to do it. Did I manipulate things? Yes, I did, but I did it for your own good, and some day, your child is going to thank me for it because he or she is alive because of it.",
        "Hope: No, no. My child is never going to have the opportunity to thank you. Believe me when I say you will have nothing to do with our child.",
        "Pam: Yes!",
        "Oliver: Is this...",
        "Aly: Oh.",
        "Oliver: Whoa!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Charlie: Familiar? Familiar?",
        "Oliver: Yes.",
        "Aly: Oh, my gosh, you guys did it. It tastes exactly the same.",
        "Pam: Yes!",
        "Charlie: Told you we'd crack the code. Celery salt.",
        "Oliver: Mmm.",
        "Aly: Um, we like to go to this medieval show with jousting and stuff.",
        "John: Oh, I used to love shows like that.",
        "Pam: You do?",
        "Eric: I had no idea.",
        "John: Jousting -- the sport of kings. When I was living in London, uh, between marriages -- I forget if it was before or after Maggie.",
        "Ivy: Okay, dad. Here -- try one of these. They're Pam's famous lemon bars.",
        "Pam: Yeah, well...",
        "John: Mmm!",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "John: Mmm!",
        "Pam: [Chuckles]",
        "John: Such sweetness. Meyer lemons?",
        "Pam: Yes! Well, see, that way, I don't have to use as much sugar when I make them. Well, it's Charlie's idea.",
        "Charlie: I'M...",
        "John: Brilliant. You should be sharing these.",
        "Eric: She does...every day.",
        "John: With the world I mean.",
        "Pam: Oh.",
        "John: I could build a business around you.",
        "Pam: Oh, I don't know. I'm -- I never thought about anything like that.",
        "John: Oh, think big. Big. Big, pam. Your face on a pastry box. \"Pam's luscious lemon bars.\"",
        "Pam: Oh, what? My face on a box?",
        "John: Face like yours could sell anything.",
        "Pam: Ohh.",
        "Brooke: I'm going alone. I mean, I don't know what I need to say to get you to understand.",
        "Bill: Try.",
        "Brooke: I see things differently now -- the way I should have seen them a long time ago -- the importance of family.",
        "Bill: Yes. Family, marriage. So why are we putting it off?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I guess it's what hope is going through right now. It's given me a different perspective.",
        "Bill: Her marriage to Wyatt?",
        "Brooke: No. She's pregnant.",
        "Bill: You got to be kidding me.",
        "Brooke: This isn't common knowledge, so please...",
        "Bill: No, no, I'm not gonna say anything to anybody. Okay, so I'm even more confused. You have a grandchild on the way, and you're leaving?",
        "Brooke: Hope and I will stay in constant contact. And her baby is just a reminder of how we need to do things right. We need -- we -- we need to love and take care of those that we're responsible for and that we care about. So what is will gonna do if you come to Milan with me?",
        "Bill: Okay, look, Brooke. [Sighs] You have babies on the brain. Hope and Wyatt are starting their little family. You were a witness to will almost choking to death.",
        "Brooke: I was, and you were there, and Katie was there, and you were a family together --",
        "Bill: And we will always be there for will -- just not as a couple.",
        "Brooke: Look, I've had some time to -- to think about this. I've been thinking about you and about me, and -- and I realize that we're the same. We both love adventure. We love to live life to the fullest, and there's nothing wrong with that. Really, there isn't. It's just sometimes we need to slow down, and we need to think, and we need to take a deep breath. That's why I am going to Italy alone. I have one shot in this life... and this time, I have to get it right.",
        "Quinn: Wow. Your hormones must be working overtime, aren't they?",
        "Hope: Excuse me?",
        "Quinn: Well, I mean, obviously, you're not yourself, speaking to me this way.",
        "Hope: I am just trying to set some very clear boundaries.",
        "Quinn: Well, like it or not, we're family, and this baby just reinforces that. You can't exclude me. Wyatt would never allow it.",
        "Hope: Well, Wyatt has a wife now -- a wife and a baby that you carefully orchestrated for him to have, so you cannot be shocked or upset that the baby and I come first. We are his top priority -- not you. Do you know where he is right now? He went to tell you exactly what I'm telling you -- you need to stay away.",
        "John: Is that true?",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Eric: Stop it. Stop it.",
        "Aly: Well, he's making Liam laugh.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, my dad does have that effect on people.",
        "Aly: At least he's keeping Liam's mind off hope.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Aly: Yeah.",
        "Oliver: Uh, do you want to get a beer?",
        "Liam: I'm gonna need one after that story.",
        "John: [Chuckles] Seems like a good kid.",
        "Eric: He is a good kid. He really is. So, john, how long are you staying?",
        "John: Uh, I'm not sure. I don't like to be gone away too long from Ivy's mom.",
        "Eric: Mm-hmm. Well, I'm very glad you finally found a wife you could stick with.",
        "John: Yes, yes. Hey, listen, um, this foxy sister-in-law of yours -- she gets that I'm married, right? Seems to be flirting with me.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: Hello.",
        "John: How's my girl fitting in?",
        "Eric: Oh, she's fitting in like she was born into the business. And it goes way beyond talent. It really does. You have a drive and determination. It's wonderful. And you're poised. You do the Forrester name proud.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Well, thanks. That means, uh -- it means that I'm now very embarrassed.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Eric: Well, don't be. It's all true. It's a privilege to have your daughter staying here with us. In fact, having Ivy and Aly living with me -- it's like a new generation of Forresters here. It makes this house a home again.",
        "Quinn: You joined my family, and if anyone is going to be setting the boundaries for this relationship, it's gonna be me.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Hope: W-wow! We are so done with this conversation.",
        "Quinn: We are done with the conversation after you apologize!",
        "Hope: Oh, look, it's Wyatt. I'm gonna answer.",
        "Quinn: Please do. Let him hear how you're speaking to me.",
        "Hope: Hi, babe. No, don't wait around the warehouse, actually, because she's here. Yeah, I made our position very clear.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] \"Our\"?",
        "Hope: How I feel and that you agree. Not very well, but I think I can handle it. Okay. I'll tell her. Bye.",
        "Quinn: Putting words in my son's mouth?",
        "Hope: Not even a little bit.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, you know what? He would never cut me out of his life -- never. This is all you, and I am not letting you get away with this.",
        "Brooke: Please know this isn't just about me. I want you to take the time, too, to figure out what's right for you.",
        "Bill: I'm looking at what's right for me.",
        "Brooke: Your son, his mother.",
        "Bill: Katie and I could never go back to what we were, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, with me in the picture.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] Okay. Now I get it.",
        "Brooke: Can you just be open to --",
        "Bill: Do you love me?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Bill, that has nothing to do with --",
        "Bill: Do you love me?",
        "Brooke: Always. But I'm stealing you from my sister.",
        "Bill: You're not stealing me from Katie. She's with Ridge. She's happy.",
        "Brooke: No, I don't know that. They're not married, are they? And deep down, I keep thinking she wants to be with you. She wants to be a family again.",
        "Bill: Even if that were true, I would have to want it, too, wouldn't I?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, maybe you do. Maybe you just don't know it. I'm in the way.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] How can you say that? You're not in the way. Katie and I -- we -- we are over, Brooke. We -- we don't have to fight our feelings anymore. You don't have to feel guilty.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: You're right. We have one shot in this life. Please don't run away from it.",
        "Bill: I understand why recent events are making you start to panic.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: You think that will deserves a chance to grow up with his parents together. Family's important. But what good does it do anyone if I'm with Katie when all that I do is think of you?",
        "Brooke: Please don't.",
        "Bill: Will needs to see a true loving relationship. That's more important than parents sticking it out and just faking it.",
        "Brooke: You care about Katie.",
        "Bill: Yes, as the mother of my child, as a woman that I was married to. But that's not the kind of example that I want to set for will. Look, when he grows up some day, and he chooses the woman he wants to spend his life with, I want him to remember -- I want him to remember that his father pursued the woman of his dreams, and he didn't give up until he got her. So run to Italy. Run away from us. That's not gonna make me go back to Katie. Listen to me. You have spent your life as the dutiful sister -- always being there for Katie, fixing all her problems -- but she is a grown-up, Brooke, and she makes her own decisions. And you don't have to give up on your happiness for her.",
        "Brooke: I'm not. I'm not giving up on anything. I'm gaining something. I'm gaining insight. I'm gaining self-respect. If you and Katie could just find your way back to each other -- and I'm not talking about anything forced. I wouldn't want that for will. I'm just saying, if you could be the way you were before aspen -- you were an example to all of us. That's what I want will to see -- his parents loving each other, adoring him, raising him, loving him, embracing each other. Now, if there's just one small chance that --",
        "Bill: There isn't.",
        "Brooke: There's always a chance. I have to go now.",
        "Bill: You're not leaving me. Brooke.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Liam: So, your dad's a fun guy. Happy to meet him.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Liam: I'm glad I -- I'm glad I came.",
        "Ivy: Really?",
        "Liam: Yeah, we can't all be so lucky as to have fun parents.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] You just can't help it, can you? Worrying about hope.",
        "Liam: Yeah, sorry. Force of habit. Ah, it's just with this baby on the way, it's not like she's tied to Wyatt alone for the rest of her life. She's tied to his -- his evil, crazy, psychotic mother. I mean, that -- that's hope's mother-in-law. How could I not be worried about that? Quinn turns on people. That's -- that's what she does, and -- and if one day, she turns on hope, what then?",
        "Quinn: I have been the most important person in Wyatt's life since day one. He's never going to cut me out of it, especially not now, with a grandchild on the way.",
        "Hope: That's exactly why he needs to. He has a child to protect.",
        "Quinn: From me?",
        "Hope: Yes! You tried to kill his brother! Why are you surprised that we don't want you around our baby?!",
        "Quinn: That was before I got help.",
        "Hope: Oh, and what about pushing Ivy into the river? That was after your little stint in therapy, if you ever actually checked yourself in.",
        "Quinn: You're questioning my therapy now?",
        "Hope: Yes, I am. It could easily be another lie. Just add it to everything else you've done. You've been manipulating my life since the beginning.",
        "Quinn: Do you regret being with Wyatt?",
        "Hope: When did I ever say that?",
        "Quinn: Oh, well, of course you don't because you have a wonderful husband and a beautiful baby on the way.",
        "Hope: Who I have a responsibility to protect!",
        "Quinn: I am this baby's grandmother! I have rights! Hope, I love you. You're my daughter-in-law, but when you speak to me this way, it makes me so angry.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Quinn: So don't you try and cut me out of his life or my grandchild's life because that would be a mistake, missy... a very big mistake."
