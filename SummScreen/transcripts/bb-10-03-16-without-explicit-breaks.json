    "Recap": [
        "Ridge assures Brooke that Eric is going to pull through. He admits that he has never been this worried about his dad and it is all on Quinn. Quinn tells the doctor that everyone has been wonderful but she had her hopes up that Eric would come to before now. Back at the office Steffy fills Liam in on what happened. Liam says he knows they were only doing what was best for Eric. She still hears Eric's word of betrayal that there was no family; they were not there. Then she remembers the marriage license; maybe it is still unsigned. Quinn will not hear of Wyatt taking over and her going to rest. She says his family deserted Eric and she will not budge from his side. Carter calls Ridge who is busy and says this is not a good time. Carter tells him the first chance he gets they need to talk; it is very important. Steffy finds the marriage license and it is not signed. She calls Ridge and tells him to come to the office immediately. She has something to show him that could change everything. Ridge gets Brooke to stay with Eric while he slips away. Steffy and Liam are ecstatic that Quinn may not be Mrs. Eric Forrester after all. Quinn tells Brooke that she has asked the doctor if Eric can go home and recuperate there with all the nurses and equipment he will need. She will be a devoted wife to him despite what everyone else says. She tells Wyatt that she will go home and get things in order.",
        "Steffy shows Ridge the papers that Eric did not sign or file. Their marriage is not final. Ridge gloats that he has his dad's POA, and now no marriage means Quinn will never cause them any problems ever again. Though Eric is unresponsive, Brooke tells him that she called Bridget, and she wants to hop a plane and come right there, but Brooke suggested that she wait until Eric is awake. She tells Eric that she loves him so much and thinks of their wedding and when the babies were born. She begs him to come back to them. Liam tells Steffy that she is a tough girl, but they mess with her then they mess with him too. That is the way it always will be. Quinn comes home and finds the movers packing her things. Ridge confronts her and says she will not be here when Eric comes home. He shows her the license and laments that this is her greatest performance ever, but the marriage is not legal. He points to her portrait over the fireplace mantle and says she will never be Mrs. Eric Forrester starting as of today."

        "Ridge: Hey. He's gonna pull through, Logan.",
        "Brooke: Of course, he is. So the doctor's still cautiously optimistic, right?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: And what about Quinn? I mean, I'm guessing she hasn't left his side.",
        "Ridge: She's the only reason he's in there. If she'd just left him alone like we asked her to, but she -- she manipulated her way into marrying him, and now... here we are. I've never been this worried about Dad. It's all on Quinn.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] He's so still. I was hoping by now that he would --",
        "Wyatt: Mom, mom. You heard the doctor. Eric's stable.",
        "Quinn: But unresponsive.",
        "Dr. Andrews: All patients are different. Uh, with brain hemorrhages, we take into account their age, health, severity of the bleed, how quickly they receive medical attention.",
        "Wyatt: Right, and in Eric's case, the paramedics showed up right away. Mom, he's in good hands.",
        "Quinn: I know. I know. Everybody's really been wonderful. I... I guess I just had my hopes up when he came to.",
        "Wyatt: Which is a good sign, right, doc?",
        "Dr. Andrews: It could be that his sleep/wake cycle is returning.",
        "Quinn: We're supposed to be on our honeymoon.",
        "Liam: So listen, I can drive you to the hospital. I can stay here with you. Whatever you need.",
        "Steffy: No, thank you. I just -- I-I needed some space right now. [Sniffles] The family's been there for him since Granddad was admitted.",
        "Liam: I feel so bad for the guy. I mean, [Chuckles] Being married to Quinn, that's bad enough, but to collapse the way that he did, that's...",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it was right... it was right here. He was just so upset with all of us.",
        "Liam: For boycotting the wedding?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] God, if I knew it would come to this, I don't think I...",
        "Liam: Whoa. Steffy, you guys were just doing what you thought was best for him. I mean, and you know Eric. He's a fighter. He's gonna come back from this better than he ever has before. Listen, you know that. You know that.",
        "Steffy: But I can't stop thinking about it. He was there, and he was hurting, and he felt like we betrayed him, and he just -- he just lashed out at us. All he wanted was for us to just support him and his marriage, but... [Sighs] I...",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Eric: You had a chance to support me, to come and witness me committing my life to another person, saying vows in front of God and family. [Voice breaking] Family. There is no family. You weren't there.",
        "Steffy: Wait a minute.",
        "Eric: You're gonna have to respect her. You have to respect her now, because when I sign this, she is Mrs. Eric Forrester! I'm married now!",
        "Liam: Hold on a second. Are you -- you telling me...",
        "Steffy: The marriage license. Maybe it's still unsigned.",
        "Quinn: Doctor, I know you're doing everything possible for Eric, and I really appreciate it, but, um, I was wondering if I could bring him home soon.",
        "Wyatt: Mom!",
        "Quinn: I-I can hire private nurses and get him the best care possible.",
        "Dr. Andrews: I'm sure that's true, but --",
        "Quinn: I-I know Eric. I know he would rather be home than in the hospital. And he'll progress so much -- so much quicker. Won't you, sweetheart? Please, doctor, if there's anything you can do.",
        "Dr. Andrews: I'll, uh, I'll look into it.",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] I, uh, I made arrangements with the hospital. They got a room right next door that also has a bed in it so you can close your eyes, and I'll stay here with Eric.",
        "Quinn: No, I'm going to stay with Eric.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Mom, his family probably --",
        "Quinn: His family deserted him when he needed them the most. Most especially ridge. No. I need to stay vigilant for my husband.",
        "Ridge: Spencer?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. He sends his well wishes.",
        "Ridge: Oh, thank you.",
        "Brooke: So what did the doctor say?",
        "Ridge: No change. Oh, man. Look at her. Loving, committed wife. She took advantage of him. He's just such a good guy. You know, he has a big heart. Mom always said he's a pushover.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Could you imagine the earful she'd give him right now if she were here?",
        "Ridge: Can only imagine the earful she'd give Quinn if she were here.",
        "Brooke: I still can't believe she got Eric to marry her.",
        "Steffy: All this time I tried to get Quinn out of his life, it's like she made me feel bad for not buying that she changed.",
        "Liam: Well, everybody knows she's not capable of that.",
        "Steffy: Not Granddad. She managed to get my grandfather to marry her. But what if it was all for nothing? If there are no signatures on the marriage license, there's no Quinn Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Shouldn't even be in his room, let alone tell everybody that she's Mrs. Eric Forrester.",
        "Brooke: Which she will never be, not in the eyes of the family, anyway.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: Excuse me. Hey. Not a good time. I'm at the hospital with Dad.",
        "Carter: How's he doing?",
        "Ridge: He's, um, the same.",
        "Carter: Sorry to hear that. If there's anything I can do...",
        "Ridge: Thanks, man.",
        "Carter: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Yeah?",
        "Carter: When you get a chance, we need to talk, okay? It's important.",
        "Ridge: Okay, not now, though.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, you really should take a break.",
        "Quinn: No. I want to be here holding his hand when he wakes up.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] That could be a while, Mom. It --",
        "Quinn: I don't care. I'm his wife. The rest of the family might not acknowledge that, but... [Scoffs] They're the ones who broke his heart. I just wish Steffy and the rest of them would have been able to trust Eric's decision, try and support our relationship.",
        "Steffy: Have to be somewhere.",
        "Liam: Is Eric's desk always this cluttered?",
        "Steffy: Well, no. Usually it's organized, but Pam's at the hospital.",
        "Liam: Okay, but we're definitely looking for, like, an envelope.",
        "Steffy: Wait.",
        "Liam: Whoa. Is that...?",
        "Steffy: They didn't sign it.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Brooke: I know it's hard, but don't let her get to you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: It's Steffy. Hey, honey.",
        "Steffy: Hey, how's Granddad? Any updates?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Steffy: Are you with him?",
        "Ridge: Wyatt and Quinn are. Brooke and I are just, uh, right outside. Why?",
        "Steffy: Can you get Brooke to keep an eye on her, stay with Granddad a bit?",
        "Ridge: Why? What's going on?",
        "Steffy: I found something. It could change everything, finally get Quinn out of our lives. Come to the office immediately.",
        "Ridge: I'm leaving now. Hey, can -- can you do me a favor? Can you stay here for a while?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, sure. Of course.",
        "Ridge: Steffy found something, so I'm -- I'm gonna go check that out. I'll be back as soon as I can.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "[Elevator bell dings]",
        "Steffy: Dad's on his way.",
        "Liam: [Sniffs] This could change everything.",
        "Steffy: Is it possible? Quinn isn't Mrs. Eric Forrester after all? [Scoffs]",
        "Pam: Oh, hey, carter.",
        "Carter: Hey. I, uh, just spoke to ridge. Said his dad's hanging in.",
        "Pam: Yeah. I just keep making little batches of lemon bars for him every day to take to the hospital, in case he wakes up, you know. I know it's silly, but I can't stand the waiting.",
        "Carter: It's hard on everyone.",
        "Pam: Everything going on over there.",
        "Carter: Between Quinn and the family.",
        "Pam: Yeah. It's killing Ridge seeing her staked out at his father's bedside, and there's nothing he can do about it, right? What? What are you thinking?",
        "Carter: What?",
        "Pam: No, I mean, you just seemed a little...",
        "Carter: Concerned. I'm concerned. I just, uh, I think that things are gonna get more difficult before they get...better.",
        "Brooke: Did something happen?",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Brooke: Is he awake?",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no, no. But he -- he will be soon, and then I can take him home.",
        "Wyatt: Mom seems to think that Eric will recover faster in a familiar surrounding.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I can get nurses and -- and all the right equipment. Plus, you know, he'll be around all of his favorite things. What? You don't -- you don't think it's a good idea that I bring him home?",
        "Brooke: I didn't say that.",
        "Quinn: You just don't think it's a good idea for me to bring him home.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, come on, okay?",
        "Quinn: You know what, Brooke? Eric's my husband. We made vows to each other in sickness and in health. You know, vows that everyone would have heard if they had simply come to the wedding. All the people that Eric cared most about and they couldn't bother to be there because I'm not who they wanted for him. You know what? You have experience with that, right? Because when you first married Eric, not everybody opened their arms to you. But you fought back. That's what I'm doing. I'm fighting back for Eric, for my husband, because you know what? For me, life is unbearable without Eric in my life. I love him, Brooke. I know ridge has convinced you otherwise, but I will be a devoted wife to Eric as much as I could possibly be. [Sighs] You know what? I'm gonna grab my purse. Could you please give me a ride back to the house? I want to -- I want to make sure I get everything set up for Eric when he comes home.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, of course.",
        "Quinn: Hopefully soon. Dr. Davis, telephone, please. Dr. Davis, telephone, please.",
        "Ridge: All right, what is it? I don't like being away from Dad or the hospital.",
        "Liam: Steffy remembered something.",
        "Ridge: Remembered what?",
        "Steffy: Liam and I were talking, and then it just hit me, what Granddad said before he collapsed.",
        "Ridge: He said a lot of things, how he was betrayed by his family --",
        "Steffy: Do you remember when he was waving this around? He said what was inside makes Quinn his wife.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I remember that.",
        "Steffy: They never signed it.",
        "Ridge: They didn't sign it.",
        "Steffy: No.",
        "Ridge: And they didn't file it.",
        "Steffy: No. Granddad didn't have the chance before he collapsed. They're not officially married.",
        "Liam: Legally speaking, Quinn can't be Mrs. Eric Forrester.",
        "Steffy: So what do we do?",
        "Ridge: Well, let's see. [Sighs] I have Dad's power of attorney. Carter drew it up, gave it to Dad just in case something happened. But this... this ensures that Quinn is not gonna cause any more damage, not to the company and not to Dad. Ever again.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Quinn: I won't be long. I just want to go home and get the house ready for you so you can come home, and then we can start our lives together as husband and wife.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Brooke: I spoke with Bridget. She said she wanted to hop on a plane to come to see you. And I suggested that maybe she wait till you're awake and on your feet again. She really does love you so much. Both of our kids do. I see so much of you in them. Your goodness. Your compassion. They are our greatest gift to each other. You and I, we've been through so much through the years. And we've only gotten closer. I just want you to know how much I respect you, how much I admire you... [Voice breaking] And I do -- I do love you so much. Please. Come back to us.",
        "Steffy: I wish we'd hear something.",
        "Liam: From your dad?",
        "Steffy: He finally has a way to deal with Quinn, but if he goes to the hospital and he confronts her --",
        "Liam: Yeah, I don't think ridge would want to cause a scene in public.",
        "Steffy: At this point, I don't think he cares, and neither do I. All that matters is getting that woman out of my grandfather's life.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, that woman has caused you plenty of misery, too.",
        "Steffy: Well, hey, I'm a tough girl. You know what that means? That means I can do one of these.",
        "Liam: You can do one of those?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: So can I. Mess with you, you mess with me. That's the way it always has been and the way it always will be, no matter what our future holds. Deal?",
        "Steffy: Deal.",
        "Quinn: Hi. Uh, who -- who are you?",
        "Henry: The movers, ma'am. I'm Henry. This is Dante.",
        "Quinn: Movers?",
        "Henry: Our supervisor's pulling the truck around while we start boxing things up.",
        "Quinn: Well, no, no, no, no, no. This is -- this is my house, and, uh, there's got to be some mistake 'cause I didn't hire any movers.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I did that. Upstairs, you guys, please. Thank you. Hey. They're just getting all your stuff out of the house.",
        "Quinn: Are you kidding me? Your father is -- he's -- he's in the hospital, and -- and this is what you're focusing on when you should be focusing on Eric?",
        "Ridge: He is in the hospital because of you.",
        "Quinn: You know what? I-I really don't have time for this right now because I-I left the hospital to come here and get the house ready for Eric. I'm hoping to bring him home soon.",
        "Ridge: I want him to be home, too. But you won't be here.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I will. I live here. I-I got married in that room right there.",
        "Ridge: You sure about that? 'Cause the family wasn't here to witness it, so...",
        "Quinn: Yeah! Ivy was here! Ivy is a Forrester. There was a -- there was a minister, and we exchanged vows!",
        "Ridge: That's irrelevant.",
        "Quinn: What do you mean, irrelevant?! What are you talking about?! He pronounced us man and wife! Eric is my husband!",
        "Ridge: This says otherwise.",
        "Quinn: What is that?",
        "Ridge: It's a marriage certificate. You didn't sign it. He didn't sign it. Didn't get filed. So legally you are not husband and wife. And you know what? It's a real shame, because this, in my opinion, was your greatest performance ever. You convinced my dad that you're not the horrible person that everyone knows you are. And trust me, I tried. I tried to get him away from you, but I couldn't. Couldn't do it. And then this landed in my lap. So let's recap. You are not Mrs. Eric Forrester. You will never be Mrs. Eric Forrester. You will not be with my father, and you will not live in this house, starting today."
