        "Nick: Damn it, Stephanie, stay out of our lives!",
        "Stephanie: Nick, tell her the truth. Tell her you're in love with her mother.",
        "Nick: I want you to take your opinions and I want you to get off of this boat.",
        "Stephanie: She has every right to know what's going on behind her back. Tell her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Mother's convinced there something's going on with you and Nick.",
        "Brooke: Your mother is insane.",
        "Ridge: You're absolutely right about that. She's done some crazy stuff over the years. Including trying to fake a heart attack.",
        "Brooke: I don't want to talk about your mother. I have much better things to do with my life.",
        "Ridge: Like what?",
        "Brooke: Well, I need to focus on myself. I suggest you do the same.",
        "Ridge: Focus on yourself with -- who?",
        "Brooke: Who I date is none of your business.",
        "Ridge: It doesn't prevent me from caring about you, being concerned. Logan, you've always been a very independent, strong-willed woman. In all the years I've known you, you've always had a serious relationship with a man. Obviously that man is no longer me, so if it's not Dante, then who?",
        "Brooke: All right, you want to know who I'm seeing Ridge? Nobody. Now, does that surprise you? Because it shouldn't. That soul mate, destiny thing didn't really work out for me. So I'm going in a different direction. Casual.",
        "Ridge: Casual? Interesting. Because you've always been hardwired to care very deeply for the man in your life. Of course, there's nothing wrong with it. I just hope you're not falling for your daughter's husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Nick! Tell her she's wrong.",
        "Stephanie: I'm not, Bridget.",
        "Bridget: Is it true? Come on, Nick, I would like to know the truth.",
        "Nick: You know the truth. You have known the truth all along. Do you remember the night I proposed to you? We committed ourselves to each other. Held each other all night long right there and conceived our child. Now don't doubt my commitment.",
        "Stephanie: And what about your meeting with Brooke in Big Bear?",
        "Nick: I did not meet Brooke!",
        "Stephanie: It was just a chance encounter?",
        "Bridget: My mother said it was.",
        "Stephanie: A chance encounter, miles away from home in the middle of a national forest.",
        "Nick: Stop it! Now I am not going to let you hurt Bridget the way you've hurt Brooke. Now that golden boy son of yours may let you bully his wife around, but not me!",
        "Stephanie: How dare you even suggest that I would deliberately hurt her. I'm just trying to spare you what I've been through. Bridget, I've lost my husband and my sons to your mother. And if you think just because you're carrying this baby, it's going to change the feelings that they have for each other, it's not.",
        "Bridget: My mother and Nick have promised me that it is over.",
        "Stephanie: It's never over with her.",
        "Bridget: That isn't true.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it is. She's so good at it, no one ever sees it coming. She seduces them and then she throws them away. And they beg for more. Honey, I know you think that -- I know you think jealousy has clouded my judgment. It hasn't. Okay, I've made mistakes. I agree. I understand that. But I'm telling you one thing -- anger has never clouded my vision. I see your mother. I see how she gets under their skin with every single man that she ever wanted. She wants your husband.",
        "Nick: Get out! Now!",
        "Stephanie: It's true, Bridget. Walk away now, honey. Don't end up the way I am. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Walk away now.",
        "Nick: Bridget --",
        "Bridget: No, no, no. Don't say anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Is mother right? Are you in love with Nick?",
        "Brooke: Oh, for god's sakes, Ridge. Do you think I could betray Bridget again?",
        "Ridge: You're not answering the question.",
        "Brooke: What do you want from me?",
        "Ridge: I just want to know what's going on between you and Nick.",
        "Brooke: That's none of your concern.",
        "Ridge: Well, maybe it is. I'm very concerned about Bridget. And I love you.",
        "Brooke: Maybe for the sake of your marriage, you should care a little less about me.",
        "Ridge: I'm not going to deny that I love you, Logan. Not even to Taylor. I suppose if I did, my marriage wouldn't be in shambles.",
        "Brooke: It sounds pretty bad.",
        "Ridge: I've agreed to go into counseling. Maybe that'll help. But no amount of counseling is going to change the love that I feel for you.",
        "Brooke: Ridge --",
        "Ridge: I guess what I want to know is --",
        "Brooke: No, don't.",
        "Ridge: Logan, Logan, look -- after everything we've been through, everything we've meant to each other, I just want to know, have you already replaced the love in your heart for me with Nick?",
        "Brooke: There was a time in my life when the most important thing to me was my happiness. Everything else came second. Even the needs of my own children. And I'm really not very proud of that. But now, Bridget's happiness means more to me than my own. Bridget is with a wonderful man. And there's nothing that I could need or want that would jeopardize the love that Bridget and Nnick share. That's what really matters the most. Keeping the promises that we've made to our children so that their dreams can come true. That is real happiness.",
        "Ridge: I'm impressed, Logan. But when haven't I ever been impressed with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I hate seeing you like this.",
        "Bridget: I hate being like this. I hate hearing that you're in love with my mother.",
        "Nick: Well, I don't blame you. Bridget, do you know why I went to Big Bear? I went up there because I wanted to go the place that we fell in love. I wanted to feel that again. I wanted to remember that. I had no idea that your mother would be there.",
        "[ Phone rings ]",
        "Bridget: Hi, mom.",
        "Brooke: You okay?",
        "Bridget: Outside of being hit by a truck named Stephanie.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Bridget: Yeah, she was here when I got here. Trying to beat Nick up. And he threatened to throw her out, so she finally left.",
        "Brooke: Look, Bridget, about Big Bear --",
        "Bridget: Mom, it's all right. You know, Nick said the same thing you did. It was this chance meeting and -- I believe him.",
        "Brooke: Sweetheart, no matter what Stephanie says -- Nick really does love you. Don't ever doubt that. Do you hear me?",
        "Bridget: Yeah, Mom. Yeah, I hear you. Thanks for calling. And thanks for everything. Mom says I should never doubt your love for me. I really want to trust you and believe that you're committed to this marriage.",
        "Nick: You can. Believe it. Nothing's ever going to change that.",
        "Bridget: It's so wonderful to make love to you. I can completely feel your commitment. I don't know why I let Stephanie get to me. You know, it's just what she does. I can't believe she's still has a vendetta against my mom after everything that's happened.",
        "Nick: I don't know what to say.",
        "Bridget: You know, I believe her when she says that she really doesn't want me to end up like she did. Those years that my dad left her for my mom, they were like a nightmare for her.",
        "Nick: Well, I'm not Eric.",
        "Bridget: I know that. But I'm sure he thought he was going to be a faithful husband, and so did Ridge and Thorne and, you know, they all thought they could resist my mom.",
        "Nick: Stop, stop, stop it. I want you to do me a favor, okay? Can you do something for me? I want you to think really, really hard.",
        "Bridget: What?",
        "Nick: I want you to think back to what we were doing before we started talking about Stephanie, again. Can you think, huh? Remember? Hmm?",
        "Bridget: I think we were doing a little bit of this.",
        "Nick: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think so.",
        "Bridget: I love you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: How dare you. How dare you go into their home and spread your vicious lies! You're destroying my daughter's faith in her marriage.",
        "Stephanie: I am? Oh, it wasn't me playing paddy cakes with Nick in the woods.",
        "Brooke: We ran into each other, Stephanie. It was completely innocent.",
        "Stephanie: Innocent? Oh, bull!",
        "Brooke: Stop it. Nick and I would never betray Bridget. Never!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, please, I know what I saw. I saw the looks on your faces -- desire, yearning.",
        "Brooke: That's what you want, Stephanie. You want me to play the whore. Well, I just won't do it.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you won't sleep with her husband? Why not? You slept with the first one. How many husbands haven't you slept with? Let's see, there was Macy's. Then there was Eric when he was married to me. And ridge, when you were married to Eric. I think I see a pattern here.",
        "Brooke: You see what you want to see.",
        "Stephanie: What I see is an obsession! An obsession on your part. It's like you set out to destroy everyone who loves you. For god's sakes, you could have had Nick! He was free, he was available. But no, you couldn't do that. That wouldn't have been any fun. You had to wait till he married Bridget and then go after him. You're the most destructive person I know in my whole life! I promise you, I'll see the two of us in hell before I let you hurt that girl again!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You're not supposed to drink when you're pregnant, right?",
        "Bridget: No.",
        "Nick: Cheers.",
        "Bridget: Oh, thanks.",
        "Nick: How many of these things did you look at?",
        "Bridget: Well, I stopped counting after 37. I know the house we want is in here, it's just a matter of finding -- you know, finding it. See, look, okay. This -- that one. Look how cute it is. It's like, kinda, you know, the cape cod style.",
        "Nick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bridget: I love it. But then, I like this one, too. It's more the classic Hacienda-style. It's got a mother-in-law suite.",
        "Nick: A what?",
        "Bridget: You know, for when Jackie wants to come live with us.",
        "[ Nick laughs ]",
        "Nick: I don't think so. Let's get rid of this one. And this one.",
        "Bridget: No. No, no, no, no, no, don't.",
        "Nick: That's it.",
        "Bridget: No, don't mess them up. Stop it. Besides, that one had a wine cellar. Look what you did.",
        "Nick: Sorry. Are you happy?",
        "Bridget: Very.",
        "Nick: So be honest with me. How you feeling about, you know, some of the things that were said earlier today?",
        "Bridget: Better. Stephanie caught me off-guard about the whole big bear thing. I'm not my mom, and I never will be.",
        "Nick: I'd never want you to be.",
        "Bridget: Besides, you made me a solemn vow that you will always cherish, love me and be a good father and husband, faithful and true.",
        "Nick: Yes.",
        "Bridget: Even when I'm naughty or nice?",
        "Nick: Naughty? I don't remember naughty in the vows. Did you sneak naughty in there somehow?",
        "Bridget: Oh, yeah.",
        "Nick: I don't think I heard that.",
        "Bridget: Definitely. And you know how much I love being naughty. And having fun.",
        "Nick: Yes, I do.",
        "Bridget: Do you have any idea how great it feels to know that I'm never, never going to be disappointed again? I feel so safe when I'm with you. I know that I'm never gonna lose you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: What's one more promise? It's only a matter of time.",
        "Brooke: Hate me all you want. But don't do this to Bridget. She doesn't deserve it.",
        "Stephanie: You're right, she doesn't. She deserves the truth, which you seem to be incapable of telling.",
        "Brooke: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Stephanie: God, you can't even be honest and truthful with yourself. What do you think you're doing here, Brooke? Being heroic? Suppressing your love, locking away your emotions, sacrificing your love for Nick, forcing him to do the same thing. Forcing him to lock those feelings away so that they eat at him day in and day out, forcing him into a marriage with your daughter that's filled with nothing but empty dreams and promises for her?",
        "Brooke: Stop it.",
        "Stephanie: Stop it? You think you're protecting her by denying what your feelings are? You love him, he loves you. He wants you. Take him!",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, do it now. Now, now, now. Face it and do it now before the baby comes. While she still has a chance to get over him. She's meet some decent, wonderful guy who will really appreciate her and not you.",
        "Brooke: Shut up, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Shut up?! Why the -- why should I shut up? I'm telling the truth. And you know it. Something happened between you two. Something happened when Bridget told you that she had the abortion, she was testing you.",
        "Brooke: Oh, god, we've over this time and time again.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, and she thought you passed the test. Because you -- because you were worried about her. She thought you were worried about her and worried about the baby. You slept with him, didn't you?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, you did. Yes, you did. You tell me the truth.",
        "Brooke: I'm telling you the damn truth!",
        "Stephanie: You're lying to me! She told you she had the abortion and you -- something happened between the two of you, and I'm gonna find out what it is. And when I do, you're gonna lose that girl forever.",
