{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7435 ~ Caroline returns to town, unaware of how much has changed since she left; Ridge is torn between doing the right thing by Eric and protecting his family."], "Recap": ["Steffy and Ridge look over the papers and tell Carter they cannot believe this is right, that Quinn has the POA. She tells her dad that they have to do something. Ridge says they need to prove his dad was not in his right mind when he signed those papers. Carter says that will be very hard to prove in court. He knows they are concerned with Quinn being in charge but there is nothing they can do. The papers give her the power and she is now in charge. Ridge says the hell she does! He tells Carter they can keep this between them. As far as anyone else knows Ridge is the POA. Carter says he is concerned too but that would be highly unethical. He cannot do that. Ridge says it will only be the three of them; no one else will ever know. He says all that power now will go over to Quinn and that is not safe. Steffy begs Carter to do them this huge favor and protect her grandfather. Carter is not emphatic enough and they assume he will keep this secret. Ridge says they can go to the hospital and get Quinn out of their lives for good. Quinn explains to Wyatt that she may not be married to Eric after all. In all the rush they forgot to sign the papers making it official. Wyatt is concerned since it means she is not a family member yet and they could kick her out of here. She says she is not going anywhere even if Ridge has to drag her out of here by her hair. She made a vow to Eric and she will protect him even from his own family. Eric's intentions were clear even without signed papers and she asks Wyatt if he will talk to their attorney and see if she can fight Ridge about this.", "Pam and Thomas sit by Eric and Thomas tells his granddad that he taught him so much growing up, how to draw and how to be a good man and now he needs him to wake up and help another young great grandson. Pam lays Eric's favorite robe over his hospital gown and says she has a fresh batch of lemon bars waiting for him at home. She cries that she hopes he knows how much she appreciates and loves him for accepting her as Stephanie's crazy little sister. She's lost her mother and then Stephanie and she just cannot lose him too. Thomas is finishing up a gown that Sasha is modeling when Caroline comes in. She has just told Thomas that it is so unfair what is happening to his grandpa and she will always be there for him to talk to and even go get an ice cream treat. He appreciates that. He is blown always when he sees Caroline and Douglas and rushes to take him in his arms. Caroline says she had no intentions to come back this soon but she had to when she heard about Eric but she wanted to see Thomas too. Pam tells God that Eric is not done here yet .please make him better and to be okay. Sasha leaves Caroline and Thomas for a chance for them to be alone. Caroline appreciates that and tells Thomas they have a lot of catching up to do. She's given it a lot of thought of what is best for Douglas and for the two of them. Quinn returns to Eric's room where Ridge and Steffy burst in and tell her again that she is not legally married so she is out of Eric's life. They will return him to his home, one where she is no longer welcome. Carter is there and they drag him into it when he says the marriage is not recognized in the state of California. Quinn says she does not care about a name on a piece of paper, she is not going anywhere. Two orderlies walk by and Ridge has then grab her and bodily take her out of the room with her hollering to let her go."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Steffy: There's no way. No, no, no. This can't be right. Quinn? Quinn has power of attorney?", "Carter: She's entitled to make decisions on Eric's behalf -- medical, financial.", "Ridge: My father couldn't have been in the right state of mind when he signed that.", "Carter: It's always a possibility, but that'd be very hard to prove in court.", "Steffy: Dad, we got to do something. We can't let Quinn be in control of granddad's life.", "Ridge: This is exactly why I had you draw up papers. In case something happened to dad, I would be in charge, not Quinn!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: [Sighs] I should be in there.", "Wyatt: Mom, you've been in there all day. Thomas and Pam need some alone time with him, too.", "Quinn: Honey, I just -- I don't like being away from him.", "Wyatt: I know, but you heard the nurse. They'd come and get you if something happened.", "Quinn: I-I get the feeling, though, that he's gonna wake up very soon.", "Wyatt: I bet you're right. He'll be out here dancing around, having martinis before you know it.", "Quinn: [Sighs] Wyatt, I'm so worried. I don't know what I would do without him.", "Wyatt: It's kinda sweet, you know? Seeing you caring for your new husband like this.", "Quinn: Well, actually, he may not be my husband after all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: I never really told you this before... but I used to live for our Saturdays as a kid. I remember I'd even, um... I'd even pretend that I wanted to hang out with my friends just so you wouldn't think I was too excited. Forrester art club. That's what you called it. You'd bring out all the pencils and sketch pads. Your best jazz albums. We'd just sit there for hours and draw, listening to miles Davis. You know, I get my impeccable taste in music from you. You taught me how to be a good designer. How to be a good man. You taught us all that. Your kids. Your grandkids. [Clears throat] And I want you to teach your great-grandson that. I need you around. You got to wake up. You got to come back.", "Thomas: What we did was wrong. It was wrong. We should have been at your wedding. And I'm sorry I disappointed you, that I hurt you. I'll make it up to you, I promise. I do. But I just -- I need you to open your eyes. Can you do that for me? Come on, Granddad. You got to wake up. [Cries softly]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: Hey there. I brought your robe from home, Eric. Hey. It's me. Pammy. You got a fresh batch of lemon bars waiting for you, too. Just the way you like it. Eric. My fiercest ally. I'm so sorry, Eric, that I wasn't there for you when you needed me. I'm sorry. But I'm here now, and I promise you, I will always stand by you. Forever. Everybody loves you so much, Eric. We're your family. Not Quinn.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: What do you mean, Eric may not be your husband?", "Quinn: I mean not technically. We never signed the marriage license.", "Wyatt: What?", "Quinn: What, with all the emotion of the day, nobody showing up for the wedding, and then going through with it, we just -- we forgot.", "Wyatt: Okay, so what does that mean for you?", "Quinn: It means that ridge is threatening to push me out of Eric's life once and for all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: I had you draw up the power of attorney for this exact reason.", "Carson: I gave your father the paperwork.", "Ridge: Then why is Quinn's name on it instead of mine?", "Carter: Eric must have written it in!", "Steffy: Maybe Quinn did it herself.", "Carter: No, I looked at the handwriting and signature. I double-checked, it's his.", "Ridge: Can you believe this?", "Carter: Look, I know you feel about Quinn, and I don't blame you for being concerned, but there is nothing we can do. Quinn has all the power.", "Ridge: Like hell she does.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: How's Eric doing?", "Thomas: Uh, he's still unconscious, but at least he's stable for now.", "Sasha: What are the doctors saying?", "Thomas: They say that, uh, recovery's unpredictable. He could get better, he could fully recover. It could go totally the opposite way. Nobody really knows at this point.", "Sasha: It's so unfair. Eric is the kindest, most wonderful man in the world, and something like this happens to him?", "Thomas: It's really starting to hit me.", "Sasha: I was actually thinking of visiting him, if that's okay with you.", "Thomas: Yeah, we could go together, even.", "Sasha: And maybe afterwards, you'll let me buy you some ice cream?", "Thomas: [Chuckles] Well, it sounds like I'm being asked on a date.", "Sasha: Well, you planned our last one, so...", "Thomas: Ice cream with you right now sounds like exactly what I need.", "Sasha: I'm really sorry, Thomas. I can only imagine how hard this is for you.", "Thomas: Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: You've always taken care of me. Stephanie's crazy little sister, pam. Always looked after me. I know I wasn't always easy, but you never judged me. I hope you know how much I appreciate you, Eric. Appreciate everything you've done for me. My job at Forrester, thanksgiving, Christmas, always saving me a place, always making me feel like I belong. And then when Steph died... you could have forgotten about me. But you didn't. You made me feel safe. Accepted. You're my best pal, Eric. Charlie's sweet. He's my guy. But you're -- you're my family. You're all I've got left. Mother's gone. Stephanie's gone. Please, Eric. I can't lose you, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: So, you're saying you're married in the eyes of God, but not in the eyes of the law.", "Quinn: Exactly. The marriage license is just a piece of paper.", "Wyatt: Uh, it's a pretty important piece of paper, mom.", "Quinn: Yeah, well, I'm not concerned about it, 'cause as soon as Eric wakes up, we're going to sign it, file it, and move on with our lives.", "Wyatt: Okay, but if you're not married, you have no legal rights. You have no say or no control over what happens. If you're not a family member, they could kick you out of here.", "Quinn: I'm not leaving him. Even if ridge has to drag me out of here by my hair.", "Wyatt: Who's to say he won't?", "Quinn: I'm not abandoning my husband. I made a vow to protect Eric always, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Even if it's from his own family.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Giving Quinn any kind of power is a disaster.", "Carter: Ridge, I'm as confused as you are.", "Ridge: No -- okay.", "Carter: Just as concerned.", "Ridge: I'm not blaming you. I'm not.", "Steffy: Carter, you just got to trust us. Quinn is violent and dangerous. You don't even know the half of it.", "Carter: I'm not sure I want to.", "Ridge: She's taken advantage of a lonely, vulnerable man, and you're okay for her to go down that road? You can live with that?", "Carter: What are you talking about?", "Ridge: Our family needs you. Let's keep this between us. No one needs to know what name is on this document. As far as everyone is concerned, I have the power of attorney.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: I meant what I said, Thomas. I just want you to know that I'm here for you, if you want to talk or... whatever you need.", "Thomas: Thank you. Feels good knowing I have your support.", "Sasha: You've got it. You've always been there for me, and now it's my turn.", "Caroline: Surprise!", "Thomas: Caroline! What -- w-what are you doing here? You didn't tell me you were coming back! Oh, my goodness. Is that my little Dougie boy? Hi!", "Sasha: Little Dougie boy?", "Thomas: Hi, hi, hi, hi.", "Caroline: Yeah, it's his new nickname for Douglas.", "Thomas: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. He's so big!", "Caroline: He's huge! He missed his daddy so much. It was all he could talk about on the way home from the airport. Hi, by the way.", "Sasha: Welcome back.", "Thomas: Hey. I'm really glad you guys are back.", "Caroline: Yeah, we weren't thinking of coming back so soon, but then I heard about Eric, and I wanted to see him. But mostly, I wanted to see you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: Please, God... he's not done here. We still need him. Please. I'm begging you. Make him better. Please. Let him be okay. Let him walk out of here. Please.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: No, I'm not gonna lose him, Wyatt. Not because of ridge, not because of the rest of his family.", "Wyatt: Okay.", "Quinn: I don't care that we didn't sign the paperwork. It doesn't matter. Eric and I are bonded in every other way that matters -- spiritually, emotionally, physically. We exchanged rings. The minister gave us his blessing. He pronounced us husband and wife. We made vows to each other, to honor each other in sickness and in health. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. That -- that has to be binding. Eric's intentions are clear. And the family -- all they keep doing is trying to blame me, when all I've ever done is love him. Wyatt, can you please get in touch with our attorney? Find out if there is any way I can fight back against ridge.", "Wyatt: [Scoffs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: You want me to lie?", "Ridge: I want you to protect my father.", "Carter: I wish I could, but this is highly unethical.", "Ridge: You care about him, right?", "Carter: Yes, of course I do.", "Ridge: Okay, well, this woman right here has put him in the hospital. He's fighting for his life because of her.", "Carter: I feel for you. I feel for Eric, but don't do this.", "Ridge: It's just the three of us. No one else will ever know.", "Steffy: I will take this to the grave and so will my father. You have our word.", "Ridge: Carter... it's my dad and his life. His livelihood is in your hands right now. And what do you want to do? You want to give that power over to Quinn? All of that power? It's not safe.", "Carter: I don't disagree. I was worried when I heard about her and Eric, too, but to do what you're suggesting...", "Steffy: You'd be saving my grandfather and doing us a huge favor. Please, carter. Please help us out.", "Ridge: Everyone already assumes that I have power of attorney. Let's just keep letting them think that.", "Steffy: Thank you. Thank you.", "Ridge: Thank you. You won't regret it.", "Carter: I hope not.", "Ridge: Now, the three of us, we're gonna go to the hospital. Get Quinn out of our lives for good.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: So Eric still hasn't woken up?", "Thomas: No. The doctors are still somewhat optimistic, though.", "Caroline: So he isn't out of the woods yet.", "Thomas: No, they don't know what's gonna happen -- if he's gonna make a full recovery or not.", "Caroline: Oh, my God. Oh, poor Eric. That must have been so hard to see.", "Thomas: Yeah, the whole thing just sucks. Family's fighting, everything's a mess. Everybody feels guilty. I mean, you've -- you've seen it, right? It's -- it's a mess.", "Sasha: Yeah. It's a bit of a mess.", "Caroline: Oh, well, lovely. That means I came back just at the right time.", "Thomas: Yeah, well, at least I get to see this little munchkin. Mmm.", "Sasha: Hey, so, how was new York?", "Caroline: Um... it was needed. [Chuckles] And it's always good to spend time with my moms.", "Sasha: Yeah, I bet. Well, you know, it is great to see you. I think I should give all of you some time to catch up.", "Caroline: Yeah. We definitely have some catching up to do.", "Thomas: Man, did I miss you.", "Caroline: [Giggles]", "Thomas: You know, video chatting eight times a day, it's just -- it's not enough. All I wanted to do was squeeze you and kiss those pudgy little hands. Mwah. Is it -- is it possible that he got cuter, or is that just me?", "Caroline: Oh, no, no, no. I wake up every day, and he's at least 10 points cuter on the cuteness scale.", "Thomas: We made a handsome little guy, didn't we?", "Caroline: Uh, yeah, we did.", "Thomas: Yeah.", "Caroline: I mean, we may be a little bit biased, but...", "Thomas: No. No. Nope. Mnh-mnh. No, we're not.", "Caroline: I'm really glad that we're getting a chance to talk.", "Thomas: Uh-oh.", "Caroline: I've just -- I've been giving some things a lot of thought. About what's best for Douglas, and... ...what's best for you and me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I know you can hear me. I feel you listening to me. You remember our vows? My vow to you? I promised you I will always be here and here with you. I'd like a few more minutes alone with my husband, please.", "Steffy: He's not your husband.", "Quinn: I don't want to do this in front of Eric. If you want to talk, let's go outside.", "Ridge: So it turns out, your marriage wasn't legal. You're not part of this family.", "Quinn: I don't care about a couple of names on a piece of paper. I know Eric meant his vows. I know what we feel for each other.", "Steffy: You played my grandfather. You targeted him, just like you target everyone.", "Ridge: He's in that room because of you.", "Quinn: No, he's in that room because of you and you and the rest of your family! You broke his heart! If you could have just respected his decision and tried to accept us...", "Steffy: There's no \"us.\" It's over.", "Ridge: Okay. Okay. Here's what we're gonna do. When he gets better, we're gonna take him home. His home. His family home. Not yours. Never was. Never will be.", "Quinn: I'm not gonna let you tear me away from my husband.", "Steffy: Stop saying that. He's not your husband. Tell her, carter.", "Carter: I'm sorry, but the license wasn't signed. Your marriage isn't recognized by the state of California.", "Quinn: Your father would be so hurt if he knew what you were trying to do.", "Ridge: My father gave me power of attorney so I can take care of his affairs, and that means you out of this hospital and out of his life.", "Quinn: I'm not going anywhere.", "Steffy: You're not going -- you're not going in there. No, you're not. Is there a problem, Mr. Forrester?", "Ridge: Yeah, this woman is harassing my father.", "Quinn: No, I am Mrs. Eric Forrester. I am his wife!", "Steffy: No, she's not. She's not --", "Ridge: She's unstable. Get her out, please.", "Quinn: Eric... I'm sorry, ma'am. You're gonna have to come with us.", "Quinn: No, I'm not going. Stop it. No! Let me go. Let me go! What are you doing? Eric! Let me go! Let me go!"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6WCVeXp9_0"}
