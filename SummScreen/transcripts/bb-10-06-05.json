        "Eric: You are not going to Bridget.",
        "Stephanie: You know, your idea of concern for your daughter is something that I will never understand.",
        "Eric: Of course not. You idea of concern is inflicting pain on other people.",
        "Stephanie: Her mother and her husband have declared undying love for one another. That is not my doing.",
        "Eric: Look, the decision has been made and it has been accepted. Nick has married the woman to whom he wants to be married. The whole point of telling you this is that it's over. There will be no other shoe to drop.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, when Brooke drops a shoe, the pantyhose are not far behind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Don't get all cubist on me and put two eyes on one side of my nose or anything like that. I want to surprise Nick, not give him nightmares.",
        "Dante: If your cell phone rings again, I'm going to give you two noses.",
        "Bridget: I told you I already turned it off. Geez. I thought I was the one that was supposed to have mood swings.",
        "Dante: I don't blame you for it. You know, Stephanie running around crying wolf.",
        "Bridget: I know. And it's so obvious that Nick and my mom are going to end up running into each other, whether it's at the gas station or at Big Bear. But I'm the one he married, and I'm pregnant with his child. And we're buying a house. Nothing is going to push me back into that emotional seesaw.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I just want to give you fair warning as to what might come down. You know what kind of person we're dealing with.",
        "[ Brooke remembering ]",
        "Brooke: Maybe I wasn't meant to be with Ridge after all. Maybe that isn't my destiny. Bridget knew that before we did. And that's why I had to deny my feelings for you. I had no other choice.",
        "Nick: Thanks. All I can say is thanks. I'll call you later. Well -- you heard what I had to say. If Stephanie goes to him, she's going to run into a stone wall.",
        "Brooke: I was just thinking about the night on the boat.",
        "Nick: What about it? How you wished it wouldn't happen?",
        "Brooke: You don't really think that, do you?",
        "Nick: No, I don't think that. I don't wish that.",
        "Brooke: It makes me strong. It gives me a kind of peace that I can't really explain. But I don't want to have to explain it to Bridget, either. It's ours. It's private.",
        "Nick: Well, let's just hope it's private enough, huh? Because Stephanie is going to try to pry this out of someone.",
        "Brooke: Well, thank god the people who know are the people that we can trust.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Why is it so hard for you, of all people, to accept that a woman would willingly sacrifice her own happiness for that of her daughter?",
        "Stephanie: Because the moment that she thought Bridget wasn't pregnant, she made a play for Nick. Now, where's the morality in that?",
        "Eric: It's an imperfect situation handled with grace and dignity. But I was a fool to think that you would ever recognize that. Leave it alone. Bridget is happy.",
        "Stephanie: Happy? Why? Because you're filling her head with fairy tales? Eric! If you saw your daughter driving off a cliff, wouldn't you yell, \"jump\"?",
        "Eric: You made me a promise. I'm holding you to it!",
        "Stephanie: And you made me a promise to love me till death us do part. It's quite a world, Eric, for people like you and Brooke, you can swallow your own lies and not never even notice. Well, Bridget and I are not like that. And I am not going to let you and her mother railroad her into the kind of life that I had -- sleeping next to a man who dreams about being in another woman's bed. It's too late for me, but it's not for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: I'm going to tell you something, but I don't want you to move.",
        "Bridget: Okay.",
        "Dante: I went to see nick. What did I just say?",
        "Bridget: Sorry. Was he overjoyed, as always?",
        "Dante: He thinks I'm a pest. And this time I actually was. But, you're right to trust him and you're right to trust your marriage.",
        "Bridget: Dante, did you give him the third-degree about mother? I know you're just looking out for my best interests, which I appreciate, but is that really fair to do to nick?",
        "Dante: It was totally self-serving. Nick's got you fair and square. But if he ever loosens his grip, I mean if he ever -- I want to be the first one to know. Now please, don't move. Now Stephanie's got it backwards. There's a guy kissing up to your mother who'd rather be with you.",
        "Bridget: Well, it's nice to know there's at least one man out there that doesn't look at me as a consolation prize after being passed up by my mother.",
        "Dante: Well, two. Two men, right?",
        "Bridget: Oh -- and Nick. That's what I meant. Of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I've given Bridget no reason to doubt me.",
        "Brooke: I don't think she does.",
        "Nick: Let Stephanie do whatever she wants to us. We can handle it.",
        "Brooke: We have no reason to feel guilty.",
        "Nick: You know, I keep buying stuff for the kid.",
        "Brooke: Like what?",
        "Nick: Stuff. You know, toys, a catcher's mitt. I get out of here, I get in my car and I just say to myself, \"why don't you go get something for the kid?\" That's probably what I'm gonna do when I leave here. You want to go? I'll probably just go home.",
        "Jackie: Hello, hello -- oh, hello. Sorry. I'm so bad about just barging in.",
        "Nick: No, no, no. You're not barging, you're fine, Mom.",
        "Jackie: Oh, good. Well, I put the wedding photos in an album and I thought I'd just drop them off and --",
        "Brooke: Actually, you're just the person we wanted to see.",
        "Nick: Close the door, Mother.",
        "Brooke: I know that Eric told you about that night. The night that I went over to Nick's boat.",
        "Jackie: And you and Nicky thought that you could finally be together. Yes, he did.",
        "Brooke: You understand what happened to change that?",
        "Jackie: Of course. I admit, it took me a little while to realize it was finally for the best, but then I saw how happy Nicky is and --",
        "Nick: You didn't anybody about that evening, did you?",
        "Jackie: No. Of course I didn't. I mean, why would the subject even come up?",
        "Nick: Because there's somebody holding a crowbar right now that would beat it out of you. Stephanie's found her crowbar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I demand that you give this up. Bridget is my daughter. She's not even related to you. Thank god.",
        "Stephanie: All the more reason why you need to act like a father to her. Listen, you may have thought that I was overly protective of our children. But what do you call this?",
        "Eric: Respecting her decisions.",
        "Stephanie: Respecting her decisions? You're treating her like a child. Have you told her about Santa Claus?",
        "Eric: What would our marriage have been like all those years if I had told you the unvarnished truth every day?",
        "Stephanie: Well, it couldn't have been any more excruciating than letting me think that you loved me and then pushing me aside so you could marry your slut.",
        "Eric: It was never any big surprise that she was better than you in bed. The big surprise is that she's a better mother than you. Brooke's finally gotten to the point where her children are more important to her than she is to herself. She only wants for her kids what they want for themselves, not what she has planned for them from birth. Now, Bridget's marriage is in no trouble from anyone. Except you.",
        "Stephanie: And you don't think -- you don't see anything remotely disturbing about this model mother of hers being in love with Bridget's husband?",
        "Eric: Marriage is a lot more than just love. It's about shared goals. It's about children. It's about plans for the future.",
        "Stephanie: And it's about trust -- trust, trust, trust, and being faithful. Of course, you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? You're still -- you're still so lustful after Brooke that you've convinced yourself that what she's doing to her daughter is some noble, selfless and beautiful thing. Oh, my god.",
        "Eric: Look at you. This isn't about protecting Bridget. This is just a device for you. This is about Brooke. This is about getting back at Brooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Jackie scoffs ]",
        "Jackie: Does that woman never learn? I M mother. And she's going to claim she's doing it to save Bridget.",
        "Jackie: Well, I hardly think that Stephanie will look to me for help.",
        "Brooke: She might. She knows that you wanted Nick and me together. We were too much in denial to notice. But Bridget is better for nick than I am.",
        "Jackie: And Nicky loves her.",
        "Jackie: I didn't think that nick could get over you, Brooke. You both had to make some very, very difficult decisions. I respect them. And he still has you in his life. You're family, Brooke, to both of us. Stephanie will get no ammunition from me.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Jackie: Well, I have some groveling to do with my daughter-in-law. So I'm going to take this album to Bridget.",
        "Brooke: Watch out, Stephanie might be hovering.",
        "Jackie: Well then, I'll be just the dragon slayer that Bridget needs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Brooke exposed your fake heart attack -- wanna talk about a fog of lies -- and all you're trying to do now is get back at her. And what better way than to turn her daughter against her?",
        "Stephanie: I am trying to save your daughter's dignity, which the rest of you don't give a hoot about. Now, whether Nick was technically unfaithful to her, or not, he has been betrayed her, emotionally, all along the way.",
        "Eric: Nick loves Bridget. He tried to marry her three times before he finally was successful. Yes, he and Brooke admitted their love for one another, but he went right back to Bridget and he hasn't strayed since. And that's where he will stay if you'll just leave them alone.",
        "Stephanie: Leaving Brooke for you?",
        "Eric: Brooke's future is up to Brooke.",
        "Stephanie: Oh. You would actually let your daughter be in a loveless marriage, just so you could get your little hot hands inside that bimbo's blouse again. You rutting old goat.",
        "Eric: Stephanie. You go anywhere near my daughter with this, I will hate you for the rest of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Sweetheart?",
        "Bridget: Oh, mom, please don't tell Nick you saw me here.",
        "Brooke: Where's Dante?",
        "Bridget: I think the cutting room. But Dante's drawing a portrait of me kind of as a late wedding gift for Nick.",
        "Brooke: How sweet.",
        "Bridget: But it is a surprise, and I know how you are with secrets.",
        "Brooke: When would I see Nick to be able to say anything to him?",
        "Bridget: You might.",
        "Brooke: Bridget.",
        "Bridget: You might, mom.",
        "Brooke: Please don't tell me that Stephanie has you thinking that nick and I would plan a secret rendezvous behind your back.",
        "Bridget: No, of course I don't think that. But when you do see him --",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Bridget: Can we put all of our defenses and our fears of misunderstanding each other aside? And just speak honestly with each other while there's no one here to hear us? Stephanie's wrong about a lot of things. We both know that. But when I do see you with my husband, I see what she saw. You still have feelings for Nick, don't you Mom?",
        "Brooke: Bridget, why are we revisiting this?",
        "Bridget: Because I think you're holding back. I think you're afraid that I can't handle the truth. But Mom, it wasn't that long ago that you told me that you still had feelings for Nick. Do you expect me to think that they'd just vanish that easily, just because I have a wedding ring on my finger? I know that Nick is an incredible man. I couldn't blame any woman for being a little bit in love with him. As long as she knew that she had to keep her distance. This isn't an accusation. I know that every marriage is based on trust. But mine is also based on trusting you.",
        "Brooke: Yes. Nick is a wonderful man. And that's shown itself over time. Nobody's been a better friend, more loyal, more kind. And now I see him with you -- how loving he is, how strong. How devoted. And that makes me so happy. Nothing means more to me than to see you happy. So, yes. Yes, I guess you could say that I love Nick, for loving you. For me to want anything more than that would be just to poison the reason why I love him. So that can never, ever happen.",
        "Bridget: Wow, thanks Mom. That's all I needed to hear. I just needed the truth. I didn't need you to evade it or spare any of my feelings. And now that I have it, I won't ask you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Jacqueline.",
        "Jackie: You. No one's home.",
        "Stephanie: I'll wait.",
        "Jackie: Nick's at the office. Bridget's at the hospital.",
        "Stephanie: No, she isn't. I already tried there.",
        "Jackie: Well, I know that they have plans this evening, and I don't think they're going to be coming back here first.",
        "Stephanie: I'll wait. It doesn't matter. And please, don't feel you have to keep me company.",
        "Jackie: I really don't. What do you want, Stephanie? This isn't your home. You're not welcome here.",
        "Stephanie: And it's not going to be Bridget's home for very much longer, either. What's this? \"Dear Bridget. Sorry I missed you. Hope you like the --\" Oh, wedding photos. \"Love, Jackie.\" Ah, how sweet it is. I wasn't invited to the wedding, you know.",
        "Jackie: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Stephanie: Why, I'm tearing out photos from this album of a wedding that should never have taken place.",
        "Jackie: If you weren't so vindictive, you would be pitiful.",
        "Stephanie: You and Brooke deserve one another, you know. You've probably known the whole time what's going on, don't you?",
        "Jackie: What?",
        "Stephanie: About Brooke and nick still being in love with one another. And you probably think it's perfectly fine that they're playing Bridget for a patsy, carrying on behind her back.",
        "Jackie: Okay, you have come unhinged. Nothing of the sort has ever happened. Nick knows what honor is, and Brooke -- she knows that a mother has to make sacrifices --",
        "Stephanie: \"Sacrifices.\" If I hear that word one more time, you and Eric -- well, we'll just see if Bridget thinks the same way that you do.",
        "Jackie: I am not going to let you torment that girl with your sick imaginings.",
        "Stephanie: Bridget deserves to know the truth. I thought you were a champion of the truth. Or is it that you're just a champion of the truth when it comes to humiliating me? Bridget is going to know that there is one person in this world she can trust. I'll let her move in with me, and I'll help her with the baby.",
        "Jackie: No! You are talking about my grandchild. And if you think that I'm going to let you do to my family what you've done to yours, you are gravely mistaken.",
        "Stephanie: How are you going to stop me?",
        "Jackie: I exposed you before for the liar that you are. This time, I will expose the very root of your ugliness. A woman so obsessed, so determined to demonize Brooke Logan, it's consumed her for years. So much so that she's allowed this disease to infiltrate and divide her family, and you are not going to spread that to mine. Nick, Bridget and the child that she's carrying -- they're mine, Stephanie. They will never be yours. They are mine."
