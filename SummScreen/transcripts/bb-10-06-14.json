        "Hope repeats again to Quinn that she is protecting her child and she wants Quinn to have nothing to do with the baby. Quinn acts shocked and says the baby is blood kin and she would never harm it. Hope tells her that she does not trust her and neither does Wyatt. She opens the door and says she is only going to say it one more time. She is not welcome here. Quinn tells her like hell she isn't. She says Hope can not keep her from her son or grandchild and so if she doesn't change her tune quickly things will get ugly around here. She knows her son would never say those things. Hope says they need to curb this to another time. Quinn says no, they will settle it right now and she will not leave until Hope takes back every filthy, disgusting word she said. This is not a game and she can not shun her from her family. And Hope won't want to know what will happen if she tries. Wyatt comes home and immediately wants to know what is going on. He asks Hope if she is okay and then his mom what is she doing. Quinn immediately goes into her mode of just coming over to congratulate Hope. Wyatt says he and Hope need some time alone. Hope tells Wyatt that she explained to his mother that she was uncomfortable around her and then Quinn threatened her. Quinn denies it and says Hope did not let her finish. They argue and poor Wyatt is caught in the middle. Quinn says what Hope said was very hurtful but out of respect she will back off. Hope tells Wyatt Quinn is lying again right now. Quinn tells Wyatt that he is the most important person to her and she was just begging Hope to not cut her out of their lives. Wyatt tells her that he will hear her out, but she has to understand that Hope is having his baby and she has to respect her. Wyatt shows her the door and says they will discuss it later.",
        "John tells Eric that the fashion industry is exciting, but there is a whole other world out there. Eric has more money than Trump and he can travel anywhere he wants, they can go together. He could come down to Australia and do some catching up. Eric says he would like that. Liam tells Ivy that he has enjoyed being here and meeting her dad. He is the life of the party. Charlie brings out more lemon bars. John says they are the cat's pajamas and he will take a dozen to go. He says he has to get his order in before she goes global. He flirts outrageously with Pam while Charlie glares at him. Pam tells Charlie not to be jealous. He says he can't help it. John likes her \"cupcakes\" too much. Ivy and Liam discuss the situation of the mother-in-law from hell that Hope has now. But Ivy doesn't think Quinn will really harm Hope as Wyatt would never forgive his mother. Oliver thinks it is cute that Aly is playing cute little matchmaker for Ivy and Liam. John calls Liam Prince William when he spies him on the terrace with his daughter. He asks Aly if he should hide his wallet. Weddings aren't cheap. John whisks Liam away and pours him some fine Russian vodka. He tells him to sit down. He says that daughter of his is his pride and joy and he just wants to make sure she ends up with a good guy. Liam says he understands, one like good old dad. John says good lord no, he's a bon vivant and Liam strikes him oddly as a genuine type fellow in this spray- tanned city. Quinn comes home and finds candles, wine and a single rose. It takes her a minute to figure it out but she tells Deacon she is not in the mood. She tells him that his sweet little daughter is trying to kick her out of the family. Wyatt laments to Hope that it seems he is always apologizing for his mother. She says she knows and it is really not his fault what his mother does. But she frightens her and does not know what to expect of her next. She knows Wyatt would never let his mother harm them but says his mother is unhinged and that is putting it nicely. She says Wyatt is wonderful putting up with Quinn's behavior. But after what happened tonight she just can not be a part of their lives. She will not back down on this. Wyatt says he will speak to his mother again and tell her to give them some space. Deacon tells Quinn just to sit down and relax, chill out. She rants that she did all she did to get Hope and Wyatt together and she doesn't get it. Deacon says her living her life for her son and unborn grandchild is a little obsessive. If she would just give Wyatt and Hope some space this will all work out. And in case she hasn't noticed there is another guy who is trying to get her attention. If she would just look around and get out of the psycho-mommy mode and into the dating mode. She asks if this is a date and if having the right man around is the answer to all her problems. He says two wrongs might make a right. She says two wrongs can make a right if he will help her. He's Hope's father so perhaps he can get through to her. He wants to stay out of it. She reminds him there was a time he wasn't freely allowed to see Hope so he knows how it is to be kept from his family. He finally says if she will not hurt Hope or the baby he will try, but no promises. He kisses her and says whatever this is must stay between the two of them. If Hope knew she would never speak to him again. She coos that it will be their little secret. He kisses her again. Ivy thinks her dad and Liam have been outside a long time. Aly convinces her to walk over behind a plant and listen. Ivy hears Liam tell John that it has been a real pleasure getting to know his daughter. He explains that he just got out of a very serious relationship but Hope ended up marrying his brother. John says she jilted him, that's a tough break Romeo. Liam goes on and on about how Ivy has been there for him. She's easy to be around and puts him at ease. He felt it when she gave him a little kiss in Paris. He realized them just how special she is. She's kind and bright and funny and he wants to thank John for raising one of the finest women he has ever met. He looks around and John is snoring on the couch."

        "Hope: I am protecting my child. I cannot risk putting our lives in danger any more.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] My god! Hope, you are so paranoid! This baby is my blood. Like I would ever do anything to hurt it!",
        "Hope: Okay, well, Quinn... I don't trust you. And neither does Wyatt, so I am going to say this one more time, and then you have to leave.",
        "Quinn: Don't do this.",
        "Hope: We are done with you, and you are not welcome in this home.",
        "Quinn: Like hell I'm not. You think that you're gonna keep me from my son, from my grandchild? I'm not going to let that happen, so you had better change your tune and quick, because if you don't, things are gonna get ugly.",
        "Ivy: Well, I guess Quinn has finally got what she's always been scheming for.",
        "Liam: Yeah, really. Hope and Wyatt married, expecting a baby.",
        "Ivy: Double win for Quinn.",
        "Liam: I just feel bad for hope. I mean, can you imagine a worse mother-in-law than that?",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "Liam: I mean, this is the grandmother to her child. I mean, Quinn has already tried to kill a few people. What happens if she succeeds?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Look, she is a nightmare, and she is a monster-in-law, but I really don't think she's gonna hurt hope, because she'd know that Wyatt would never, ever forgive her.",
        "Liam: Yeah, no, you're right. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, now that Quinn has finally gotten everything that she's ever wanted, maybe she's not a danger to hope anymore.",
        "Aly: Liam and Ivy have been out there for awhile.",
        "Oliver: You're so cute. You little matchmaker.",
        "John: Everybody, I've lost my daughter. Anyone seen her?",
        "Aly: Well, I think she's still out on the terrace.",
        "John: Ah, still outside with prince William, I see.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles]",
        "John: So tell me. Just how serious are they?",
        "Eric: Oh, I think it's still pretty new.",
        "John: Give me the real scoop, kiddo. Should I hide my wallet?",
        "Aly: Why?",
        "John: Weddings are not cheap, my friend.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles]",
        "Oliver: Liam and Ivy are still in that getting-to-know-you stage.",
        "Aly: But it's going very well.",
        "John: Bill Spencer's son.",
        "Pam: Yes, but Liam's really nothing like his dad or like his brother, Wyatt.",
        "Charlie: Now there's a guy you want to watch out for. And his wacky mother.",
        "Aly: Liam's had a hard time lately. Ivy's really been there for him. I think that they have a lot of potential.",
        "Ivy: You're right to worry. Quinn is totally unpredictable.",
        "Liam: Yeah, and you know something? As much as she thinks she wants Wyatt to have a woman in his life...",
        "Ivy: Yeah, it's just -- she's so weirdly possessive. I can't even imagine what she would be like as a grandmother.",
        "Liam: Oh, no. Hope is tied to her forever. I mean, there's no chance she's getting rid of Quinn now.",
        "Quinn: I have been there for you, hope, done nothing but support you, and now you turn your back on me?",
        "Hope: Wyatt and I both agreed that it's dangerous for you to be around the baby.",
        "Quinn: My -- my son would never say such a thing!",
        "Hope: I think maybe we should have this conversation at another time.",
        "Quinn: No, we are gonna settle this right now. You are gonna take back every word that you said to me -- every filthy, disgusting word. Do you think that this is a game? Shunning me from my family? Believe me, you don't want to know what will happen if you try.",
        "Wyatt: Hey! What the hell is going on here?! off.",
        "Hope: Wha of wh, viyayoav",
        "Wyatt: Are you okay?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: What are you doing?",
        "Quinn: I was congratulating her on the exciting news. I mean, you guys are having a beautiful baby, you know? I'm gonna be a grandmother. I just -- I thought that we could celebrate together.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, well, I think hope and I need some time.",
        "Quinn: I know. I understand that you're still upset, you know? And I don't blame you. Going to paris and interfering was wrong. I just --",
        "Hope: Wyatt. Wyatt, all I tried to do was explain to her that I was very uncomfortable having her around the baby, and instead, she threatens me.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Hope: Yes, she threatened me, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Did you threaten her, mom?",
        "Quinn: No, I didn't -- hope didn't give me a chance to finish.",
        "Hope: Yes, she did.",
        "Quinn: What I was trying to say was that -- [Sighs] Even though what you were saying was very hurtful, I understand where you're coming from, and out of respect, I would love to give you some space and back off.",
        "Hope: What?! She's lying! Oh, my god, she's lying to you right now!",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Okay. Well, good. I'm glad you understand that hope and the baby need a calm and peaceful environment right about now.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, there's nothing more important to an expectant mother.",
        "Hope: Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Are you really trying to say that you didn't tell me things were going to get ugly?",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Hope: And are you saying that you didn't tell me that I'd regret keeping her away from our family?",
        "Wyatt: Are you kidding me right now?",
        "Hope: Yes, that's exactly what she said to me.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, what I --",
        "Hope: Yes, it is!",
        "Quinn: You are the most important person in the world to me, Wyatt. You and now my grandchild. You are my family. You're everything that I have.",
        "Hope: Oh, my god.",
        "Quinn: It was extremely painful to hear that you didn't want me around anymore, so I was begging with her.",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Quinn: I was pleading with her not to drive a wedge between us.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, okay. I will hear you out. But you have to understand that hope is having my baby, and you need to respect her. No matter what. Do you understand?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Of course I do, sweetheart. I just wanted to have --",
        "Wyatt: Great. We'll discuss that later.",
        "Quinn: I hope you guys enjoy the rest of your evening.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: I'm sorry.",
        "Hope: I -- [Sighs]",
        "John: Los Angeles is okay. The fashion business is exciting, but there's a whole world out there, Eric.",
        "Eric: John, I love my work. More than ever, actually.",
        "John: Let it go. You got more dough than trump and Timberlake combined. You go travel somewhere. We could do it together. Come on, Ricky boy. What do you say? Let your kids run the business. Come down to visit me in Australia. Let's spend some time catching up. I'd like that.",
        "Eric: So would I. I'd like that a lot.",
        "Ivy: Aw. You look so handsome with a smile on your face. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I am having a really good time. Being here with you.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: And getting my mind off things, and meeting your dad. Life of the party, right?",
        "Ivy: I know. Never a dull moment.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I bet. [Chuckles]",
        "Charlie: Here we go. Another fresh batch.",

        "John: I got to get my order in before you go global.",
        "Pam: Oh, stop, john.",
        "Charlie: Well, old blue eyes isn't quite sure of her business plans yet.",
        "John: Ohh, those peepers. Pammy D.",
        "Eric: John, john.",
        "John: I can't help it! I love women. I took me several marriages to realize you could look, but you can't touch.",
        "Charlie: John.",
        "John: Yes, chuck?",
        "Charlie: You're touching.",
        "John: Oh, right! [Chuckles]",
        "Deacon: Surprise.",
        "Quinn: Deacon, I am not in the mood.",
        "Deacon: Okay, I'll bite. What's wrong?",
        "Quinn: Did you know that hope was pregnant?",
        "Deacon: Yes.",
        "Quinn: Well, your sweet little daughter is trying to kick me out of my family.",
        "Deacon: [Scoffs]",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Eric: Here we are.",
        "John: Did you ever notice her eyes follow you?",
        "Eric: Yes, I've noticed that. I-I've been getting tipsy every night, drinking two of these martinis. One for me and one for her. I've given you Stephanie's tonight.",
        "John: You sure she doesn't mind?",
        "Eric: If she does, she'll say something.",
        "John: [Chuckles] I can't imagine that this picture helps with the ladies. I mean, a shrine to your deceased wife.",
        "Eric: Well, I have to tell you, every time I try to kiss another woman in front of her, she comes crashing to the floor.",
        "John: Ha! That's a good one.",
        "Eric: I'm serious.",
        "Charlie: Can't believe the nerve of that guy.",
        "Oliver: Are you jealous, Charlie?",
        "Pam: Don't be. I can't help it if he likes my baked goods.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, especially your cupcakes.",
        "Pam: He likes my cupcakes?",
        "Charlie: [Scoffs]",
        "Aly: Looks like your dad and Liam are having a little one-on-one.",
        "Ivy: Oh, no. What are they talking about?",
        "John: Sit down, champ.",
        "Liam: Uh, okay.",
        "John: [Sighs] I've poured you a glass of the finest Russian vodka.",
        "Liam: Oh. Wow. Thank you.",
        "John: That is a gift from Vladimir himself.",
        "Liam: Are you serious?",
        "John: Let me tell you something. I've sailed around the globe. I've climbed mount Kilimanjaro. I canoed up the Nile, took a sharp left turn and sailed down the lovely Mississippi river.",
        "Liam: Are you sure those are the same -- okay.",
        "John: What I'm trying to say is this daughter of mine is my pride and joy. And I just want to make sure that she ends up with a guy --",
        "Liam: Oh, I completely understand. A guy just like her father.",
        "John: Oh, lord, no. I'm a bon vivant. You on the other hand, you strike me as an oddly genuine type of guy to be living in this spray-tanned city. What gives?",
        "Liam: Uh...",
        "Wyatt: It always seems like I'm apologizing for my mother.",
        "Hope: It's not your fault. You have no control over what your mom does, but -- [Sighs] Wyatt, now that I'm pregnant... it changes things. She terrifies me. I have absolutely no idea what she's gonna do.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, hey, hey. Hope. You know I would never let anything happen to you or this baby, okay?",
        "Hope: I know. No, I know you wouldn't. But...the thing is, you can only protect us so much. Your mother...is unhinged. She's disturbed. And I'm sorry, but I feel like I'm putting that nicely.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, she's got a lot of issues.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, do you have any idea how wonderful you are?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: I'm serious. I fully appreciate everything that you've gone through. Always covering for her, putting up with her behavior.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: You have had to be so incredibly patient. And -- and it's one thing to put up with that as her son... but especially after everything that just happened here tonight... she can't be a part of our lives.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, I think you need to just relax a little bit. You know, just chill out. Come on. Sit down.",
        "Quinn: I am not up for this right now, deacon. Your daughter is trying to get between me and my son and my grandchild.",
        "Deacon: Okay, just calm down.",
        "Quinn: The only reason that they're together is because of me, but she doesn't get that. She doesn't realize how hard I have fought to give her everything she wants. Cut me out!",
        "Deacon: Hey, will you just take a deep breath?",
        "Quinn: I don't even get what's going on here.",
        "Deacon: [Scoffs] Living your life for your son and for a grandkid that isn't even born yet -- I mean, it's like beyond obsessed. I just thought maybe you -- maybe you'd shift your focus a little bit. Give hope and Wyatt a little bit of space and maybe this thing will work itself out.",
        "Quinn: Just sit by and let my son slip away?",
        "Deacon: In case you haven't noticed, there happens to be another guy who's trying to get your attention. You know? Look around. See anyone?",
        "Quinn: Not really.",
        "Deacon: Really? Well, maybe if you opened your eyes. I mean, the problem is that you can't get yourself out of psycho mommy mode. I'm trying to get you into dating mode.",
        "Quinn: [Snorts] That's what this is? This is a date?",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: So what you're saying is the right man is the answer to all my troubles?",
        "Deacon: No, actually, what I'm saying is the wrong man is the answer to your troubles. See, contrary to popular belief, sometimes two wrongs make a right.",
        "Wyatt: She goes to extremes, no doubt, but...she's always supported us.",
        "Hope: I understand that. But tonight was... different. I just -- I have a really bad feeling about it.",
        "Wyatt: Hope. You don't really think she'd hurt you, right?",
        "Hope: Yes, I do. And I would feel so much safer if she were not around. Like -- like, out of L.A.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I doubt she'd agree to that.",
        "Hope: Well, what other choice do we have? We have to do something, and I'm so sorry, but I -- I'm not gonna back down on this.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. You're right. I'll go talk to her. I'll tell her to stay away from us for awhile or something.",
        "Hope: Okay. I'm sorry. I can't imagine what you must be going through, and I -- I hate asking you to cut yourself off from your mother. I do. But think of everything that she's done. I don't want her around me or anyone in my family, and especially nowhere near our baby.",
        "Quinn: Well, two wrongs can make a right. Especially if you're willing to help me.",
        "Deacon: Help you how?",
        "Quinn: Well, you're hope's father. You can get through to her.",
        "Deacon: [Laughing] No, no, no, no, no. I'm staying out of this one.",
        "Quinn: You know getting between a parent and a child is unacceptable. You know how that feels. I mean, there was a time you weren't able to freely see hope.",
        "Deacon: This is different.",
        "Quinn: How? Don't let the situation get any worse. You can talk some sense into hope. Please. Help me, deacon.",
        "Deacon: You would never hurt hope, right? I mean, she is your daughter-in-law. She's -- she's carrying your son's child, right?",
        "Quinn: Oh, are you kidding me? I would never lay a hand on her. Please, deacon. Don't look at me like that. It's hard. All right. I'll -- all right, look, I'm gonna try, but, you know, no promises, okay?",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Deacon: And this -- whatever this is -- this stays between us. Because hope would never talk to me again if she found out.",
        "Quinn: Oh, no. It'll be our little secret.",
        "Deacon: Well, in that case.",
        "Aly: You know, I should probably help Oliver in the kitchen. Pam and Charlie are probably talking his ear off.",
        "Ivy: So, Liam and my dad have been talking for awhile now. Do you think that's a good sign or a bad sign?",
        "Aly: Well, you know, they're just right there. Go listen.",
        "Ivy: No! I couldn't.",
        "Aly: Oh, come on, Ivy. You know you're dying to find out. Come on.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: It really has been a pleasure getting to know your daughter.",
        "John: She's my little didgeridoo.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Liam: Yeah, I, uh... I don't know if you heard this. I-I-I just came out of a pretty serious relationship, and the girl ended up marrying my brother.",
        "John: Faith? Charity?",
        "Liam: Hope.",
        "John: Ah.",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "John: Name's not important. What's important is she jilted you, Romeo. [Chuckles] Tough break. Tough, tough break.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. Ugh. Well, you know, with the help of your daughter, I'm -- I'm getting through it. There -- there is something about Ivy that is, I don't know. She just makes you feel good. She puts you at ease. [Laughing] I can't -- I can't tell you how supportive she's been, how patient with me. And, you know, because of the whole circumstance with hope, I really haven't been able to give her more than my friendship. I don't know. I mean, I -- I feel like the tide's maybe turning and I'm not sure if she still feels the same way, but if she does, I'm lucky. I, uh, I had a feeling in paris, when I pulled her out of the seine. She -- she kissed me on the cheek, just really quick, but... I don't know. It kind of made me realize how special she is. She's so sophisticated. And kind, and bright, and funny. I don't know. I just, uh... I want to thank you for raising one of the finest women I've ever met.",

        "Liam: Mr. For-- okay."
