{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7436 ~ Wyatt takes a surprising stance in the war between his mother and his wife; having already lost her home, Quinn learns the extended consequences of crossing a Forrester."], "Recap": ["Thorne tells Ridge that Quinn is not going to stand for this. Ridge says she has no choice. She is not legally married and she is not going to be allowed in Eric's room or this house. Ridge tells them he has had new codes surrounding the complex and they will keep Quinn out. Quinn charges into Forrester and confronts Steffy that she is not going to erase her from Eric's life. Steffy says oh yes she can. She is not legally married and Ridge has power of attorney so she no longer is part of Eric's life. Caroline tells Thomas that she will go see Eric but she wanted to see him first. And Douglas missed his father. Steffy tells Quinn that everything she is doing is more than justified so her time is over. Quinn calls Wyatt who shows up and Quinn says they cannot do this to her. They argue. Steffy says she needs to leave as she needs to get back to the hospital. Quinn will have to respect Ridge and Steffy's decision. Ridge says to make sure all goes well he is going to move back into the house and take care of his dad. Caroline tells Thomas that until she left she doesn't think she really appreciated how great he has been throughout all of this. Now this is their chance to be a family. She missed him and it wasn't just because of Douglas. He is special and he means a lot to her. She thinks they ought to try. She wasn't sure she was ready, but now she is. He cannot believe she is saying this.", "Quinn charges into the house and tells Ridge he cannot do this. He says he is moving back in and Quinn has nothing to worry about. He will take care of his father. Quinn says he cannot hate her that much. She did not trick his father into marrying her. Eric wants her in his life and Ridge needs to respect his wishes. They will always love each other and he will wake up eventually and not stand for this. Steffy tells Wyatt that his mom had to go. Quinn no longer works here and she will not be in Eric's life. He says he really thinks his mom has changed and he feels badly for her but Steffy does not want her here so she will have to respect this. Ridge has power of attorney and he cannot argue with that, so he is on their side. His mom is out of Eric's life now so it is time for her to come home. She moved out because of Quinn but now that is over. His mother cannot do anything now and they can get back to old times. The law is the law so there is no getting around it. He asks her will she come home. She finally says yes. Quinn tells Ridge they both love Eric and she knows he thinks he is doing the right thing but he is not. Eric wants her in his life not evicted. Ridge says Eric only wanted companionship but Quinn will never get to his father again. He will get a restraining order if he has to. She says he does not have a shread of decency within himself. He is not Eric's son. He goes straight to the mantel and takes down the Quinn portrait. Rick and Thorne come in and want her to leave. She says they better not touch her and they cannot keep her away from her husband."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Ridge: So you if see Quinn at the hospital, you call security.", "Rick: She's not allowed to visit dad at all?", "Ridge: Not his wife.", "Thorne: They had a wedding.", "Ridge: They don't have a marriage license.

She's a little quicker than I thought.", "Quinn: I work here.", "Steffy: No, you don't, Quinn.", "Pam: Okay, Charlie, just take her out.", "Charlie: All right. Let's go.", "Quinn: Don't.", "Steffy: It's fine. Give us a minute.", "Charlie: I'll be right outside.", "Quinn: You can't just erase me from your grandfather's life.

Still no change with Eric?", "Thomas: [Sighs] No. Doctors say we need to stay positive and keep holding on.", "Caroline: What can I do?", "Thomas: You're here.

Douglas needs to be with his daddy again.", "Caroline: Being with my family was wonderful, but... I missed L.A.", "Thomas: Everybody missed you, too.", "Caroline: I was thinking about coming back for a while, but when I heard about Eric, I knew it was time.", "Thomas: You're here.

You have no right.", "Quinn: You have no right!", "Steffy: Oh, same old Quinn.", "Quinn: So you think I shouldn't be upset?", "Steffy: I've boxed up your things. You can get them when you leave the building. I told you for months to stay away from me and my family. You took advantage of my grandfather, and now he's in a hospital fighting for his life because of you. Everything I'm doing is more than justified. So your time here and in my family's life is over.", "Steffy: I don't want the spectacle of Charlie and his team throwing you out, but I'll do it if I have to.", "Quinn: Just listen to me.

I don't care that ridge has power of attorney. I don't care that Eric didn't sign the marriage license. He proposed to me. You were invited to the wedding. You would know how he feels about me if you showed up!", "Steffy: He gave you a chance, and now he paid a price.", "Quinn: No!", "Steffy: I knew you were gonna hurt him, Quinn!", "Quinn: This is hurting him! This is hurting him!", "Wyatt: Mom --", "Quinn: No! She knows I'm right!", "Wyatt: This isn't helping right now.", "Steffy: Quinn, you need to leave because I have to go to the hospital.", "Quinn: I need to go to the hospital!", "Wyatt: Yeah, well, I think you want that, yeah! And I know your feelings for Eric are genuine, mom. But this -- this is the Forresters' decision right now.", "Quinn: Keeping me away from Eric is not going to make him any better.", "Wyatt: Yeah, well, that's the way it is and you kind of have to accept it!", "Quinn: No! They're the ones who abandoned him. He asked them to be there for him and they didn't show up.", "Wyatt: They are taking care of him, and you have to let them do that.", "Quinn: That is my job. I promised him!", "Wyatt: Mom! Stop! Don't make this harder than it already is. Just go! That's the best thing that you can do right now, for everybody.

I-I think it was good for me to get some distance, um... and just try to make sense of everything.", "Thomas: Mm.", "Caroline: What happened with us and Douglas and... my marriage to ridge.", "Thomas: Some big changes.", "Caroline: It was just a lot all at once. But when I was finally able just to kind of stop and really think about everything, I --", "Thomas: Hey. You what?", "Caroline: I think that... I was able to re-evaluate everything, and until I left -- I don't think I appreciated how great you have been through all of this.", "Thomas: I -- I don't know about great.", "Caroline: The way that you fought for your son, not wanting somebody else to raise him...", "Thomas: Honestly, I can't even believe that I even considered that. It just -- it seems impossible.", "Caroline: Douglas is so lucky to have you as a father. And I am so grateful to have you in my life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "[Door slams]", "Ridge: The movers left a while ago.", "Quinn: Why are you doing this?", "Ridge: Doing what? Getting you out? Because you don't belong here!", "Quinn: You can't throw me out of your father's house.", "Ridge: This is our family's me. The man I love had a brain hemorrhage. We're in the middle of a terrible crisis, and you and your daughter are just making it worse!", "Ridge: My father's gonna be just fine. I'm moving in, taking care of things. So you have nothing to worry about.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: Caroline, you've been -- you've been gone for a while.", "Caroline: I know. And I -- and I know that you had to move on with your life. I mean, you couldn't sit around and wait for us to come back. But we are back now. Your son and...me. This is our chance. To be a family.", "Thomas: What are you saying?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: You can't hate me this much -- kicking me out of here, out of the hospital.", "Ridge: None of this had to happen if you'd just stayed away from him.", "Quinn: [Scoffs] Eric and I fell in love!", "Ridge: You played him! You turned him against his own family!", "Quinn: You turned against him when you boycotted the wedding!", "Ridge: What wedding? You're not married. None of this means anything.", "Quinn: It meant something to Eric. You would have known if you'd have been there.", "Ridge: Here. Call these guys. They have your stuff. Now get out of my house.", "Quinn: I am not the enemy. I have never wished you any harm. I didn't manipulate your father. I didn't trick him into marrying me. All I've ever done is encourage him, is support him, is show him love. Eric wants me in his life! I know his intentions. You just need to honor them. You need to respect his wishes!", "Ridge: My dad just couldn't see what you were doing. I do.", "Quinn: This is wrong, ridge. Eric is gonna wake up, and when he does, he's not gonna stand for this. You can try and keep us apart, but Eric and I are always gonna love each other!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I warned him. I knew -- I knew Quinn was gonna hurt him. I knew it.", "Wyatt: I --", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: You don't have to explain it to me, Steffy.", "Steffy: She had to go. She couldn't work here any longer.", "Wyatt: I know.", "Steffy: She shouldn't have been working here in the first place.", "Wyatt: I know. That's why I told her to leave.", "Steffy: You backed me up.", "Wyatt: Well, it shouldn't be a surprise to you.", "Steffy: You're right. It shouldn't.", "Wyatt: Look, do I feel bad for my mom? Of course I do. Look, I -- I really do think she has genuine feelings for Eric. And she's scared to death for him, but we all are. And you -- you don't want her to be here. So she has to respect that. Mom and Eric aren't legally married. And it doesn't matter if it's a technicality. She's not his wife. Ridge has power of attorney, and I can't argue with that and neither can she. But I never wanted to argue with you about any of this. I've always been on your side. I -- I hate that my mother's become such an obstacle between us. But she's out of your grandfather's life now, she's -- she's out of the company, and I'm assuming she's out of the house.", "Steffy: So... you support me?", "Wyatt: Of course I do. You need to feel secure. I want that. If this is what you want, then it's a hell of a lot better than living apart from you. You wanted my mother out. You got it. She has no say in the company. She's not living at Eric's anymore. That's it. It's time for you to come home.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: We're already a family, Caroline. Douglas -- he's our son.", "Caroline: Yeah, but... he's not our only connection.", "Thomas: No.", "Caroline: And I don't want to -- I don't want to run from that. I don't want there to be secrets between us, Thomas. I don't want to keep any from myself. From the moment that I left L.A., I wondered if it was the right decision. And the longer that I was gone... ...the more I missed you. And I told my moms how amazing you were, how you stepped up for Douglas and how you protected me from the press. And it just made me realize how special you are. How much you really mean to me.", "Thomas: Caroline.", "Caroline: It wasn't possible then, but I -- I think we should try.", "Thomas: I can't believe you're saying this.", "Caroline: And I should have said it sooner. But -- my marriage was ending, and there was just so much scrutiny, and I needed time to think. I wasn't ready. But now I am.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: You moved out because of my mother. Remember? That's what you said.", "Steffy: Yeah.", "Wyatt: That you weren't just gonna stand by and let my mother manipulate your grandfather and push her way into your family.", "Steffy: Quinn wouldn't stop and my grandfather wouldn't listen. I was -- God, I was -- I was scared, okay? And I was really frustrated.", "Wyatt: I know that. But it's over. My mother can't do anything to any of you. Ridge can protect Eric and make the right decisions for him, and we, Steffy -- we can get back to our lives. We don't know what Quinn's gonna do, and we don't know how she's gonna react --", "Wyatt: Yeah, well, that's something that she's just gonna have to deal with. 'Cause the law is the law, and there's no getting around that. Look, they didn't sign the marriage license, and ridge has power of attorney. That's it. But... what I really want to get back to is what we were talking about. You promised me that once Quinn was out of the picture, you would come back to me. I need you back in my life, Steffy. Will you come home?", "Steffy: Yes.", "Wyatt: Yes? So you're coming home?", "Steffy: I'm coming home.", "Wyatt: Yeah?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Both laugh]", "Quinn: We both love Eric. I know why you're doing this. You think you're helping, but you're not.", "Ridge: Tell me something. Tell me one good thing that's happened to my father since you guys got involved.", "Quinn: [Scoffs]", "Ridge: Because before, he was happy, he was healthy. He didn't have to worry about family or the company.", "Quinn: We both want Eric to recover, ridge.", "Ridge: What I want is to undo all the bad things you've done.", "Quinn: Your father wants me in his life, in his house, not evicted from it!", "Ridge: You preyed on him.", "Quinn: No!", "Ridge: A lonely, vulnerable man -- he was looking for companionship.", "Quinn: Eric needed to feel vital again. You just pushed him aside and you put him on a shelf. I saw that he wasn't done. I saw the fire that he still had inside of him. I still see it! I just need to be with him.", "Ridge: Absolutely not.", "Quinn: I can reach him, ridge.", "Ridge: No, no. You're never gonna be anywhere near my father ever again.", "Quinn: I'm not a monster. Eric knows that.", "Ridge: Get out.", "Quinn: I'm not going anywhere.", "Ridge: Then what do you want me to do? [Sighs] Get a restraining order? I can.", "Quinn: Do you hear yourself? Listen. Listen to what your father said to you in that office. He is the most compassionate man I have ever met in my entire life, and if you can't find just the smallest bit of decency to show me... then you're not his son!", "Ridge: Wow. You don't listen.", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "Ridge: I tried talking to you. I did. I used words. It just didn't -- it didn't work. How about this?", "Quinn: Stop. Stop!", "Ridge: How about this?", "Quinn: You can't do that.", "Ridge: You're out of my father's life for good.", "Quinn: No. Eric wants me in his life. You can't do that!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thorne: Hey. What's going on?", "Ridge: Quinn is leaving. Get out of the house!", "Quinn: No, I'm not leaving!", "Thorne: All right. Come on.", "Rick: It's time to go.", "Quinn: Stop. Stop it! Don't touch me. Eric needs me. And you cannot keep me away from my husband.", "[Door slams]"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcAdxn50ZKo"}
