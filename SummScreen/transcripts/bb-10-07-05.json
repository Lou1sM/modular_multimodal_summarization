        "Jackie: What are you doing, Stephanie? Put those things back.",
        "Stephanie: Bridget will be in no shape to pack after she hears what I have to say.",
        "Jackie: You are not taking her things off this boat, and you are not going to say one word to her about Nick and Brooke.",
        "Stephanie: Listen to me. She's being lied to, by the two people in this world who are supposed to love her the most, the people that she's supposed to trust. Now, you can stand by and watch her have her heart broken, but I will not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Nick remembering ]",
        "Brooke: I can't forget about you. I can't stop wanting you. My love for you will never change. And that can't change, either.",
        "Nick: And what way is that?",
        "Brooke: By loving your wife too much to betray her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Knock at door ]",
        "Bridget: You wanted to see me?",
        "Nick: Yes. Yes, I do. I do.",
        "Nick: Andrea, hold all my calls, will ya? My wife's in my office. I don't want to be disturbed.",
        "Bridget: Wow, what's up?",
        "Nick: I'm what's up. 'Cause I'm on top of the world because of you and this child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Any luck?",
        "Megan: Not yet.",
        "Eric: We're running out of people to call. Somebody must know where Bridget is.",
        "Brooke: Eric, what's going on?",
        "Eric: Have you seen Bridget?",
        "Brooke: She just left to spend the evening with her husband.",
        "Eric: I've been trying to call her.",
        "Brooke: Maybe she turned her phone off. She wants to be alone with nick.",
        "Eric: So she's with Nick?",
        "Brooke: Yes. You said that. Is this about Bridget? You said it was urgent.",
        "Megan: You know what? I should let you talk.",
        "Eric: Yes, Megan, thank you. Thanks. Thanks for your help.",
        "Brooke: What is it, Eric? What's going on?",
        "Eric: It's Stephanie. Look, we have to stop her from stirring up Bridget's insecurities about you and Nick.",
        "Brooke: We've already dealt with that.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, she's gonna bring it up again, and worse.",
        "Brooke: It won't do any good. She has no credibility.",
        "Eric: She will now. Oh, Brooke, I think I made a big mistake.",
        "Brooke: What did you do?",
        "Eric: I gave Stephanie the benefit of the doubt. She's been causing so much trouble for Bridget, I just wanted it to stop. I thought if I could convince her that you and Nick have Bridget's best interests at heart, that she would just stop this whole thing. And so I told her about -- I told her about that night on the \"Marlin,\" the night that you and nick confessed your love for each other.",
        "Brooke: Eric -- no!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: You want to stop Bridget from being hurt? Then you leave her alone!",
        "Stephanie: She needs to know what's going on between her husband and her mother.",
        "Jackie: They've moved on, Stephanie. So should you.",
        "Stephanie: For god's sakes, they've confessed their love to each other!",
        "Jackie: That was before Nick and Bridget were married, after she told him the relationship was over.",
        "Stephanie: Now it will be!",
        "Jackie: Stephanie, she loves him. She's carrying his child.",
        "Stephanie: Too bad he's carrying a torch for her mother.",
        "Jackie: That is not true.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, please! He fell into Brooke's arms the first chance he had. You think that isn't going to happen again? It'll happen any day now, I'm telling you! And where does that leave Bridget, home with a brand-new baby while her husband is in bed with her mother?",
        "Jackie: Nick wouldn't do that.",
        "Stephanie: Brooke would, and she has! And she practically drove that girl over the edge once before!",
        "Jackie: That is exactly why you can't say anything!",
        "Stephanie: And that is exactly why I have to tell her! I want her to get on with her life. I want her to walk away from this sham of a marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You told Stephanie about my night with Nick? Eric, what were you thinking?",
        "Eric: Look, Stephanie doesn't believe that you're capable of putting your own daughter's needs before your own. I wanted her to see what you and Nick were willing to give up. Look, I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Brooke: You thought you could reason with her?",
        "Eric: Yes, that you had right in your hands, you had this whole future with Nick there, and you chose not to do that, that you can make the right decision. I thought she would understand.",
        "Brooke: You know Stephanie's never had faith in me.",
        "Eric: Yeah. Yeah, I told you, it was a big mistake. I admit that. I'm going to rectify it.",
        "Brooke: So you're looking for Bridget?",
        "Eric: Yes, because Stephanie is determined to tell Bridget what she knows.",
        "Brooke: Eric, she can't.",
        "Eric: She will. If she finds Bridget before we do, she will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: No one is going to hurt Bridget -- not my son, not Brooke, and especially not you.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you just can't see it, can you? You just can't see how badly this all can end.",
        "Jackie: Yeah? It will if you get involved.",
        "Stephanie: And -- and Brooke and Nick and the way they're carrying on, sweeping their feelings under the rug? You think that it's just all going to go away?",
        "Jackie: If they're determined, then --",
        "Stephanie: Then it will work out, right? [ Stephanie laughs ] They'll be no consequences, no fallout. Why, I'm not surprised that you would think that way. Eric does, too. But then people who cheat think that they can have their fun and get away with it.",
        "Jackie: This is about Brooke.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yeah, Brooke, too. Yes. [ Stephanie laughs ] You know, she's never been accountable for her actions. But of course, that's the difference between people that have morals and people like you and Brooke.",
        "Jackie: This isn't about morality or your high and mighty principles. What we're talking about is Bridget. What you're going to do is going to affect her life.",
        "Stephanie: It's already affected her life. She's been driven to distraction, practically to a breakdown by the duplicity of your son. For god's sakes, she lied to them about the abortion because she thought she'd test his love. And she thinks they've passed the test. They failed miserably! I am not going to let them fail her again.",
        "Jackie: You make it sound as though they slept together.",
        "Stephanie: I think they did.",
        "Jackie: They didn't.",
        "Stephanie: Well, they will. No matter how much he professes that he loves Bridget, this marriage is just a disaster waiting to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I almost forgot -- presents.",
        "Bridget: Presents?",
        "Nick: Yeah, I went by one of those little baby stores to pick some things up.",
        "Bridget: Wow. Did you clean the place out?",
        "Nick: This is the thing that I really thought was great. It's -- it's one of those things where you can like -- you can record, you know, the baby's heartbeat, you know? So it also has -- yeah, honest. You know, you can put music in there, too. It's got little speakers in there so you can play music.",
        "Bridget: Oh, wow.",
        "Nick: And it's supposed to stimulate the child's brain. Huh? I like that. Oh, oh. I like this. See this deal, you just wind this up, and it gives you a little version of \"row, row, row your boat.\"",
        "Bridget: Oh my gosh. That is so adorable.",
        "Nick: Check this out. I got a couple of little things to wear, you know?",
        "Bridget: Oh! I see for a boy or a girl.",
        "Nick: Well, you can't be too prepared, right? You really don't know.",
        "Bridget: Look at this. This is so cute.",
        "Nick: Oh, I didn't get all kids stuff either, by the way. I got a little something for mommy.",
        "Bridget: Oh, I see. Hmm? Here's all your toys.",
        "Nick: Thanks.",
        "Bridget: Oh, my goodness. I think this is for daddy.",
        "Nick: What are you doing?",
        "Bridget: Well, I think I should put this on right now, don't you?",
        "Nick: Now?",
        "Bridget: Oh, honey, I don't think I'm going to be able to wear this thing much longer.",
        "Nick: Well, I certainly don't think you're going to be wearing it very long today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Thunder crashing ]",
        "Stephanie: Why can't you see that what I'm doing is what I think is best for Bridget?",
        "Jackie: And what do you expect to happen when you go to her with this information?",
        "Stephanie: Well, I'm hoping she'll walk away from this fiasco and get on with her life.",
        "Jackie: Ah, by leaving Nick, raising her child with you, miserable and missing the man she loves?",
        "Stephanie: She'll get over him. She will meet a wonderful boy, and she will be the healthier and the happier for it.",
        "Jackie: You are assuming that she can't be happy with Nick. But she can, Stephanie. I've talked to him. He's completely committed to her.",
        "Stephanie: For how long?",
        "Jackie: Well, nobody knows that, do they? Marriage is about faith. It's about two people believing that they can just get through anything, no matter what, together. And sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't. And I don't have to tell you about that, do I?",
        "Stephanie: Marriage is also about trust. And if I can keep Bridget from being disappointed and hurt, I feel I have an obligation to tell her the truth.",
        "Jackie: Even if it's not what she wants?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, Jackie, you don't know what she wants.",
        "Jackie: Neither do you. Hearing all this talk about morality and preserving the truth -- that is not what this is about, is it, Stephanie? It's about revenge -- driving a wedge between Brooke and Bridget, destroying my son's marriage. You're trying to get back at Brooke and me for turning your family against you.",
        "Stephanie: You think this is about you?",
        "Jackie: I think you need to back off and let Bridget make her own decisions.",
        "Stephanie: She will make a decision -- a well-informed decision, after I give her the information. She'll come at it with her eyes wide open, and she will see her mother for exactly what she is.",
        "Jackie: Okay. I will admit Brooke has not been the perfect mother. She has made mistakes. But at least the mistakes that she's made have been out of love, and I would rather have my grandchild raised around someone like that than a bitter, hate- filled woman like you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: All right, Megan. No, no. You don't have to keep trying. Just put Bridget through to me when she returns my call. All right, thanks.",
        "Brooke: We can't let Stephanie get to Bridget.",
        "Eric: No, we have to talk to Bridget before Stephanie does.",
        "Brooke: I promised her that nothing was going on between Nick and me. Now, if she thinks that I'm making excuses and trying to justify my actions, she's going to have reason to doubt. Eric, she can't find out anything about that night. Bridget is happy now. She's very secure in her marriage. If she finds out, she's going to be devastated",
        "Eric: Stephanie's going to turn this whole thing into you and Deacon all over again.",
        "Brooke: Well, I won't let that happen.",
        "[ Phone rings ]",
        "Stephanie: Hello, Eric.",
        "Brooke: It's not Eric.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Stay away from my daughter.",
        "Stephanie: You know I would, if you'd stayed away from Nick.",
        "Brooke: Where are you? We need to talk.",
        "Stephanie: I'm down at the boat. I'm packing Bridget's things. And the only person that I am going to talk to is Bridget.",
        "Eric: What did she say? Brooke? Brooke, where are you going?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: I love you so much, Mr. Marone.",
        "[ Bridget laughs ]",
        "Nick: I love you, Mrs. Marone.",
        "Bridget: I can honestly say that I am so incredibly sure of that.",
        "Nick: You should be. I am committed to you and this child 100%.",
        "Bridget: I know. I don't want you to keep having to reassure me though, baby.",
        "Nick: I'm not saying that to reassure you. I'm saying it because it's true, and I'm going to keep on saying it over and over and over again until you tell me to stop.",
        "Bridget: I am never, ever going to tell you to stop.",
        "Nick: I was hoping you'd say that.",
        "Bridget: It's not just like a feeling though. It's -- you know, I just trust you. I trust you 100%. After everything that we've been through, all the misunderstandings and mistakes, look at us. Look at us. We're still together. No matter how hard I ever tried to test you or push you away, you never wavered, 'cause you just never gave up. And I didn't either. And now, I just know that nothing will ever, ever make me doubt you again. Not my family, not Stephanie -- nobody.",

        "[ Brooke remembering ]",
        "Stephanie: You slept with him, didn't you?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, you did. You tell me the truth.",
        "Brooke: I am telling you the damn truth!",
        "Stephanie: You're lying to me! She told you she had the abortion, and you -- something happened between the two of you, and I'm going to find out what it is. And when I do, you're going to lose that girl forever.",
        "Brooke: Damn you, Stephanie. I will not let you destroy my daughter's marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Oh, Eric, thank god.",
        "Eric: Jackie, what's going on?",
        "Jackie: Where's Brooke? We've got to get her in here right now.",
        "Eric: Brooke just left.",
        "Jackie: Well, what about Bridget?",
        "Eric: She's with Nick, I think.",
        "Jackie: Oh!",
        "Eric: Oh, my god, it's Stephanie, isn't it?",
        "Jackie: She knows, Eric. She knows about the night on \"The Shady Marlin.\"",
        "Eric: Yes, I know.",
        "Jackie: I tried to get through to her, but she is determined to tell Bridget about the night when Brooke and Nick confessed their feelings for one another.",
        "Eric: Wait, you -- you saw Stephanie?",
        "Jackie: On the boat. She was waiting for Bridget.",
        "Eric: That -- that's got to be where Brooke took off to then.",
        "Jackie: Well, I don't think that Brooke is going to have any more luck with Stephanie than I did.",
        "Eric: Well, let's hope she does. God, I'd hate for Stephanie to be there when Bridget and nick get home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Bridget doesn't need these, Stephanie. She's not going anywhere.",
        "Nick: What the hell is this? That's your mother's car, isn't it?",
        "Bridget: And Stephanie's.",
        "Nick: Is there any chance they're planning a baby shower in there?",
        "Bridget: None. Goodness, we were having such a good day, too.",
        "Nick: Well, nothing has to change. Hey, we're solid, right?",
        "Bridget: Yeah, of course we are. But that doesn't mean I want to get into an argument with her.",
        "Nick: Well, that's not going to happen. I think it's best if you go to Chuck's, huh, and I'll handle this.",
        "Bridget: No, sweetheart, I don't want you to have to deal with her alone.",
        "Nick: I just think it's best. I'll come and get you when she's gone.",
        "Bridget: No. We're in this together, and we'll face Stephanie together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I know what Eric told you, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: He only confirmed for me, Brooke, what I believed. But he gave me the ammunition for Bridget.",
        "Brooke: Your word against mine hasn't really been working lately.",
        "Stephanie: You mean you're deliberately going to lie to her?",
        "Brooke: I would do anything that I have to do to protect my daughter's marriage from your interference!",
        "Stephanie: You -- you promised that you would not act on your feelings for Nick, and you did. She has no idea about what happened that night.",
        "Brooke: If you really loved Bridget, you would just leave this alone! [ Creaking sounds ] Oh, my god, I think that's Bridget.",
        "Stephanie: Well, you still have time if you want to sneak out the back.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, don't do this.",
        "Stephanie: She deserves to know exactly what's going on here.",
        "Brooke: Nothing is going on!",
        "Stephanie: What do you mean, nothing's going on? You and he have confessed your undying love for one another? God, Brooke, face it. Deal with it.",
        "Brooke: We did. We're over that! We've dealt with it. Bridget is happy now. She's having a child with Nick. Don't take that away from her. You hate me. You want to hurt me. Well, don't hurt Bridget!"
