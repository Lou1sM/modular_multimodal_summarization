        "It's a little frosty in the office and Thomas asks Steffy if this is the way it is going to be now. She is not sure; depends on if he has apologized to his dad. He says not yet but he's been working on the new line and that is why he is letting her present it to Ridge and not him. She says his problem with their dad has nothing to do with the collection so meet up with him today, apologize and get past it. He says his own dad has made more than his share of mistakes. And he did not pink slip Thomas or disown him, so he will get over this. Caroline tells Ridge all she wants is him and to have a family. He says that is just what they will do then .everything he promised her but Thomas can not know about this baby. Eric tells Ivy that surely she did not think he would march in and tell Steffy to give her job back. He wants to broker a truce and have them both in the room at the same time. Ivy says Eric said he would plead her case and she can not ask for more than that. Thomas excuses himself when Eric walks in and tells Steffy they need to talk. He still does not understand why Ivy is no longer working at FC. On the Sky Lounge Quinn sits down with Liam. He motions there are other seats besides these. She says she did not want others as he might think she was stalking him and go whine to his girlfriend. She is confident of her designs but she misses Ivy's creative input. Wyatt walks out and hears his name and comes over. He tells them that Ivy is with Eric as they speak getting her job back. Quinn says she knows she pushed Ivy off the bridge and she hated her for a long while. But now Ivy trusts her and they work well together. Now Ivy is on the other side and looking for a second chance. Liam reminds them that Eric is practically retired so do not look for too much help there. Wyatt says Eric still has a lot of influence around here. Liam doesn't think Ivy has much a chance once Eric knows what Ivy did for Steffy to fire her. Eric, Ivy and Steffy all have their say but Steffy says Ivy does not have to apologize to her, the answer is still no. She can not work with Ivy. Eric says but Ivy thinks she can. Steffy says no because Ivy was blackmailing her. In her defense, Ivy says she was just trying to get justice for Aly. Steffy tells her version how that night Aly tried to run her down with her car, then attacked her with the tire iron and they fought over it. Then Aly picked up a rock and was going to hit her over the head with it. She fell at this point and Steffy said she freaked out and swung at her with the tire iron. It happened so quickly but she never meant to hurt her. And Ivy recorded all of this on her cell phone. And she threatened to go to the police if Steffy did not do as she said. Eric asks about the video and Ivy says she deleted it. She knows she took this too far, but Steffy wasn't the only one traumatized. Aly was her best friend. The real tragedy is Aly's death not this rift and she is now trying to fix it. All Steffy needs to do is give her another chance. Eric hears enough and says this is ending. What happened was inappropriate and disturbing but they need to stop now and get past this. He knows it is hard to build trust, it will take time but he wants them to let this go right now. Aly was family and this is what she would want. He orders Steffy to give Ivy her job back.",
        "Thomas tries to apologize to Ridge but Ridge says that a couple of I'm sorry's is not going to do the trick. Thomas tells Ridge that he lost control. This has been building up for a while and he could not hold back. Ridge says he knows; Thomas wanted his shot and he got it. He finally got his attention. Thomas says things were said and old wounds opened up. But that is no excuse and he was disrespectful and he is sorry for that. Caroline says perhaps he should come back later. Thomas says no, he does not want to drag this out. He reacted in anger and his emotions took over and he is ashamed of that. He overstepped and now he wants to apologize. Ridge says they have had their father and son problems but he does not even know him anymore. And he is needed elsewhere \u0096 Paris. Thomas is shocked that this is coming out of the blue and they have never talked about it. Ridge says he and Caroline can finish the collection so Thomas needs to go home and pack and leave for Paris today. Steffy tells Ivy that Eric has spoken and she will do as he says as long as Ivy respects her authority. Eric tells her that he is proud of her. Sincerely Ivy says she will not take this for granted. She will respect Steffy's position. She knows she has to prove herself so she will do whatever Steffy wants her to. She is willing to do anything to make FC as successful as it can be. Steffy says she is glad to hear that. She thinks she knows exactly what Ivy can do."

        "Caroline: I know. And I'm not saying that I don't. It's just... I'm the one that has to -- to carry this secret inside my body. I mean...",
        "Ridge: It's not your fault. It's... Thomas took advantage of you.",
        "Caroline: All I want is to be with you and have a family.",
        "Ridge: That's what we'll do. We'll have that family, everything I promised you. But Thomas can't know about this baby.",

        "Thomas: Is this how things are gonna be from here on out?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. [Sighs] Have you apologized to Dad?",
        "Thomas: Not yet. Been busy working on this new bedroom line.",
        "Steffy: Oh, I like it.",
        "Thomas: Enough to forgive me?",
        "Steffy: You punched Dad in the face.",
        "Thomas: Which is why you will be presenting this line to him and not me.",
        "Steffy: Okay, your problem with Dad will not be a problem for the collection. So meet up with him, say you're sorry, and work it out... today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I hope we can get this taken care of quickly today.",
        "Ivy: Me, too.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Uh, maybe -- it might be easier for you to talk to Steffy alone.",
        "Eric: No, I'm trying to broker a truce here. I want them both in the room at the same time.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Eric: You didn't think I was gonna go in there and just order Steffy to give you your job back, did you?",
        "Ivy: No, no, I didn't. Look, you've said you're gonna help me try and plead my case. I'm so grateful for that, Uncle Eric. I couldn't ask any more than that.",
        "Eric: She can be stubborn, I know. But I think if we can get everything out in the open, and if we talk freely, I think you can get your job back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Snickers] You -- you realize there are other seats, right?",
        "Quinn: Well, if I sat over there, you'd think I was stalking you, and then you'd whine about it to your girlfriend.",
        "Liam: Touch\u00e9.",
        "Quinn: What do you think?",
        "Liam: You're asking my opinion?",
        "Quinn: I guess the better question is what will Steffy think?",
        "Liam: Ah, there we go. Steffy has an issue with Ivy, not with the jewelry you two make together.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I'm not questioning my designs, Liam. I don't need anyone to tell me how good they are. [Sighs] But I do miss having Ivy around, her creative input.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you don't have Wyatt to bounce ideas off of?",
        "Quinn: My son should be doing other things besides critiquing his mother's jewelry.",
        "Wyatt: Did I just -- did I just hear my name?",
        "Quinn: We were talking about Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Oh.",
        "Liam: Your mom misses her.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, well, then, I have good news, 'cause she's downstairs right now, getting her job back.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: It was a reaction.",
        "Steffy: It didn't just happen, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: [Stammers] You're acting like I thought about it. I didn't plan to hit Dad.",
        "Steffy: Okay, you just need to fix it.",
        "Thomas: I can't take back the truth. He has made his share of mistakes. All right, yeah, I feel bad about it. But he didn't disown me. I-I didn't find a-a pink slip in my desk. Dad will get over it.",
        "Steffy: What are you doing here?",
        "Eric: Ivy's family, Steffy. The three of us need to talk, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: I have somewhere to be.",
        "Steffy: Ivy and I have said everything we need to say to each other, so...",
        "Eric: Well, then, maybe you could explain the situation to me, because I don't understand why Ivy's no longer working at Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: We don't have to go in.",
        "Ridge: Oh, yes, we do.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] We were up really late, and maybe we should just give ourselves a little bit of time --",
        "Ridge: Waiting's not gonna help, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: I know, but there's nothing wrong with us just giving ourselves some time to process things, 'cause there's a lot.",
        "Ridge: What my son did to you makes me sick. I don't want to go face him, but I have to, for you... for an innocent, little baby inside of you. Just got to keep moving forward, you know? Stick to the plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Having Ivy back would be good...for me, creatively speaking.",
        "Liam: Yeah, don't start rearranging office furniture just yet.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on, man. If Mom and Ivy can work past their issues...",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: ...You and Ivy can do the same.",
        "Liam: It's not about me, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Steffy and Ivy, then. Whatever!",
        "Quinn: I pushed Ivy off a bridge. I mean, all I'm saying is she hated me for a very good reason. But over time, we learned to respect each other as artists, you know? I mean, I proved myself, you know? And she learned to trust me.",
        "Liam: This is so different.",
        "Quinn: Not really. Ivy is now on the other side, and she's looking for that second chance.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. And with Eric's help, she just might get it.",
        "Liam: Okay, but Steffy is president of Forrester. Eric is practically retired at this point.",
        "Wyatt: No. He founded Forrester Creations. Uh, it doesn't matter what it says on his business card, man. He still has influence around here.",
        "Liam: As much as Steffy loves and respects her grandfather, she doesn't trust Ivy. And she probably never will.",

        "Eric: Steffy, you and Ivy are confident, talented Forrester women. You're the future of this company.",
        "Steffy: Ivy doesn't work here anymore.",
        "Ivy: I want to, though, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Which you've made that clear...repeatedly.",
        "Eric: You don't think she can make a contribution?",
        "Steffy: Well, I already have a jewelry designer, so...",
        "Eric: But she's family.",
        "Steffy: Did Ivy ask you to come here?",
        "Eric: More importantly, I promised her father and mother that I would take care of her. I welcomed her into our family and our company, and she's come through for us.",
        "Steffy: I'm not denying that.",
        "Eric: But you won't rehire her.",
        "Steffy: No.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] Steffy, I-I've said that I'm sorry. I don't know how many more times you need to hear it.",
        "Steffy: I don't want you to apologize to me.",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, then, just don't accept my apology. Just let me come back. Give me a second chance to prove that things can be different.",
        "Eric: That seems like a reasonable request. Steffy, you're president of the company, and your father is the CEO. And all I can really offer is advice and support.",
        "Steffy: And, Granddad, every time you give me advice, I am thrilled. But this situation is more complicated than you realize.",
        "Eric: I see that. Maybe I can help.",
        "Steffy: Ivy and I can't work together.",
        "Eric: She thinks you can.",
        "Steffy: Well, I can't work with Ivy.",
        "Eric: Why not?",
        "Steffy: Ivy didn't tell you the whole story. Did she?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: She says it has to do with the night that Aly died. What happened?",
        "Steffy: You want to know why I fired Ivy? I fired Ivy because she was blackmailing me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Whoa, man, your eye. Look, I know you're angry. I get it.",
        "Ridge: Angry doesn't even begin to describe what I'm feeling right now.",
        "Thomas: All I need is a minute.",
        "Caroline: Now is really not the best time.",
        "Thomas: I want to apologize, all right? I-I don't want what I did to come between us.",
        "Ridge: What you did is not gonna go away with a couple of \"I'm sorry\"s.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: This could turn out to be a very bad idea, dude.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, Eric agreed to help.",
        "Liam: I -- hey, I hope he does. I mean, it'd be great if Steffy and Ivy can get past this. Nobody would be more supportive of that than I would. But you said it. It's a risk.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] One that she is willing and needs to take.",
        "Liam: There are other jobs.",
        "Wyatt: What are you talking about? Forrester Creations is her family company. She belongs here.",
        "Liam: Oh, what -- and she's just gonna prove that by forcing Steffy's hand again, this time dragging Eric into it?",
        "Wyatt: If Eric thinks he can convince Steffy to give Ivy her job back, so be it.",
        "Liam: Yeah, except that Ivy didn't tell Eric the whole story, did she? See, exa-- you -- you and I both know that Eric is never gonna side with Ivy if he knows what she did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Ivy was blackmailing you?",
        "Steffy: Ivy forced me to make her the face of Forrester. And now she's using you to get her job back.",
        "Eric: She asked me to speak to you on her behalf to see if you could get things back to --",
        "Steffy: No, not after what she did to me, no.",
        "Ivy: Oh, come -- I was after justi-- I was -- I was looking for justice for Aly, Eric.",
        "Steffy: And a fat, new job position. The night Aly died... the night Aly tried to hit me with her car, Aly attacked me with a tire iron. And we fought for it. And then Aly picked up a rock, and she was gonna slam it on the top of my head, so I had to defend myself.",
        "Eric: You said that she -- she fell. She hit her head.",
        "Steffy: She did. She did. She -- when she picked up the rock, she fell, and then I freaked out, and I-I grabbed the tire iron.",
        "Eric: You hit her?",
        "Steffy: It was self-defense, and it all happened so quickly. I never wanted to hurt Aly.",
        "Eric: And you saw all this?",
        "Steffy: She recorded it on her cell phone.",
        "Eric: Oh, my -- what?",
        "Ivy: That -- that footage, Eric, it doesn't show Aly holding a rock. All it shows is Steffy holding a tire iron.",
        "Steffy: She was threatening to use that video against me. She was gonna go to the police if I didn't do what she said.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: I can't work with somebody like that.",
        "Eric: Did you -- you didn't tell any of this to the police?",
        "Steffy: No, when I -- when I gave my statement, I was so freaked out that I -- there was things that I forgot. And then when I started to remember, I-I was too afraid to change my story.",
        "Eric: Where's this video now?",
        "Ivy: I-I've deleted it. It's gone. Look, I-I know. I took it all too far. But Steffy wasn't the only one traumatized by that night. Aly was my best friend.",
        "Steffy: I didn't want Aly to die.",
        "Eric: Of course not. The real tragedy here is Aly's death. Now, this rift... between the two of you, this loss of trust between you --",
        "Ivy: That's exactly what I'm trying to fix. All I need is Steffy to give me a second chance.",
        "Steffy: Oh, you didn't give me a chance. When I tried to explain myself, you wouldn't even --",
        "Eric: This is finished now, all of it! This is enough. What's happened between the two of you is inappropriate, and it's -- it's disturbing. Now, you need to let this go, and you need to be able to move on. I know it's hard to build trust. It takes time. But I'm telling you both... let this go. Aly... Aly loved this company, and she loved this family. And when she was well, she understood that the best thing we can do is stand together. We need to move on. Steffy, I'm telling you to bring Ivy back into the company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Look, what I did was wrong.",
        "Ridge: You keep saying \"what I did.\"",
        "Thomas: I mean, I -- it's not a secret.",
        "Ridge: Not anymore.",
        "Thomas: Okay, I lost control. I lost my temper. I should've just -- just walked away.",
        "Ridge: You wanted a shot, you took it.",
        "Thomas: Hey, things had been building up for a while now. There's no denying that. You know, I-I came back to LA hoping to reconnect with you, that things would be different, to reconnect with you the way that Steffy reconnected with you. You know, uh, but the way that you've been riding me, what you did to my first design --",
        "Ridge: What I did to your design? What -- did I hurt your feelings?",
        "Thomas: Okay, that was --",
        "Ridge: You wanted my attention. Well, now you have it.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] Things were said. Old wounds got opened up. A-and that's not an excuse. What I did was disrespectful, and I am sorry.",
        "Caroline: Thomas, I think that maybe you should just come back --",
        "Thomas: No, I-I want to take responsibility for this. I don't want to drag it out. I overstepped. I'm sorry.",
        "Ridge: You overstepped. You stepped way out of bounds.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Eric doesn't need to know everything that happened between Ivy and Steffy, all right?",
        "Liam: You don't think Eric's gonna ask how Ivy lost her job?",
        "Wyatt: No, it doesn't even matter now. The fact of the matter is, Ivy wants back. And -- and she wants to put all this behind her. And I have to believe that Steffy wants to do the same, 'cause Ivy wants to do everything she can to make that happen.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah, like going to Eric for help.",
        "Wyatt: Support, Liam. And I expect you to give her some support, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Steffy, if there is anything I can say --",
        "Steffy: I think Granddad just said it all. Forrester is your company. You have the ultimate voice here, so if you want me to give Ivy her job back, then I will.",
        "Eric: Can you work together?",
        "Steffy: That depends.",
        "Ivy: Well, I'm -- I'm willing to try.",
        "Steffy: So am I. If you respect my authority.",
        "Ivy: Yes, of course.",
        "Steffy: I won't forget you threatening me, the fear I felt. But if there's a way to move past this, then... I hope we can.",
        "Eric: I'm proud of you, Steffy.",
        "Ivy: Thank you, Steffy. And thank you, Uncle Eric. I know that that wasn't easy to hear.",
        "Eric: It's time to move forward.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, I know I have a lot to make up for. But I won't take this chance for granted. I'll respect your position. I'll listen. I'll contribute. I'll do whatever you ask of me. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make Forrester Creations the most successful company it can be.",
        "Steffy: I'm glad to hear that, Ivy. Because I have an idea. You want to prove yourself? I know how you can do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I wasn't thinking. I lost it.",
        "Ridge: You knew what you were doing.",
        "Thomas: A-and I wish I hadn't. But all that pain that you caused to Mom, all those times that I needed you there and you weren't, all right, I finally called you on it. And the way that you were looking at me, it's the same way that you're looking at me right now. I get it. You're angry. And I understand why.",
        "Ridge: Do you?",
        "Thomas: Dad --",
        "Ridge: You wanted to be the big man, didn't you?",
        "Caroline: All right, that's enough. Thomas, you wanted to apologize, and you have --",
        "Thomas: No, I'm not done.",
        "Ridge: You are done.",
        "Thomas: Dad, you got to let me explain. If I could take all of this back, if I could do it over again --",
        "Ridge: You can't.",
        "Thomas: I acted on emotion, and I am ashamed of that.",
        "Ridge: You should be ashamed of yourself.",
        "Thomas: What do you want me to say? What do you want me to say -- that your relationship is important to me? I know that an apology won't be enough, so what can I do? I-I don't know what else to say. Don't you want to get past this? Don't you want to let go of all of this bad blood, this resentment that we have for each other? Dad, this doesn't have to be another reason that you and I don't get along. God, we got everything out there. It's over. It's done. It was brutal, but we did it. So accept my apology, and let's move forward, the three of us working together. Look, this doesn't have to be a lingering effect on our relationship. I'm sorry. Come on. I overreacted.",
        "Ridge: We've had our problems. Fathers and sons. I don't even know you anymore.",
        "Thomas: I'm your son. And I'm asking for forgiveness.",
        "Ridge: You came to LA because you wanted to earn a spot on the design team.",
        "Thomas: And I did. My work here has been exceptional.",
        "Ridge: Well, now you're needed somewhere else.",
        "Thomas: What are you talking about? Where?",
        "Ridge: Paris.",
        "Thomas: We have never talked about this. I-I've never heard about this.",
        "Ridge: I'm telling you now.",
        "Thomas: But we have the entire collection that we still have to finish.",
        "Ridge: My wife and I are gonna finish the collection. You should go home and pack. You're leaving for Paris today."
