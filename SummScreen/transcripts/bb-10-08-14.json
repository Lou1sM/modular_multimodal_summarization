        "Ridge tells Rick that he can't fire him. Rick puffs up that he won't have to. Ridge will resign. Quality and integrity is what their clients have come to expect. Ridge says his designs will do that. Rick says yes but only due to his wife. Ridge has done nothing since his accident in Abu Dhabi. Caroline has been covering for him since he can not draw. Ridge admits she has been helpful. Ricks tells him the collection is late and he has put the company in jeopardy because he could not tell the truth. He says Ridge took credit for Caroline's designs and that makes him a fraud. Ridge laments that if Rick has a problem, then he can talk to Eric. And if Eric has a problem then he can talk to Ridge. Rick asks if he will then fix it. Ridge says yes if necessary. Rick presses Ridge more than once to pick up the pencil and make a few changes. He goads him that he is passing off Caroline's designs as his own and he wants to see the great genius at work. Donna visits Katie and hears that Will swallowed a coin and could have choked. Thank God, Bill had the good sense to get it dislodged. Donna asks Katie if they have set a wedding date. Katie seems disappointed but says not yet. Ridge has been focusing on his work and his recovery. Rick has really been on him at the office to get this collection in. Donna says if Rick has a problem then he should talk to his wife. Katie isn't sure what that means. Donna says she is at the office and she sees things and Ridge is spending an awful lot of time with Caroline. Katie says but it is all work. He's usually worked alone before but now he and Caroline are a team. He's mentoring her and giving her guidance and it is helping him too. Donna says that makes sense. Katie tells her that Caroline and Rick are happily married and she and Ridge are engaged and as soon as this collection is over they will be married too. Their feelings haven't changed. They have just had some delays. Donna says good; she just wants both of her sisters to be happy. She wants her to marry Ridge and move on with her life. Caroline barges in and asks Rick why is he attacking Ridge. Rick tells her all Ridge had to do was tell the truth and he won't. She's stunned when she hears that Rick tried to fire Ridge. She tells him that she loves him but on this he is over-reacting. Rick fires back that no he is not. He is President and he can't allow this to put FC in jeopardy. Caroline begs him to calm down. She's a better designer with Ridge's help and the collection is good. Rick argues that Ridge is not helping her. He is telling everyone they are his designs. Caroline says they are. They came from his mind; his ideas. She apologizes to Ridge. Rick is furious of why she is apologizing to him. She opines that she is getting hands-on instructions from a fashion visionary. He has shown her things that no other designer could ever describe or explain. Rick says Ridge is using her; he could not do it without her. She admits she could not do it without him; they are a team. She knew what she was being asked to do and she went along with it. Rick says the arrangement is over as of now and Ridge's tenure has ended. Rick says he could have been honest and told his dad even. He said he had the designs ready and they weren't. Then he said they were his and they weren't. Ridge tells them that he cares more about this collection than anyone. Rick calls him unprofessional and selfish. Caroline begs again for him to not do this. She tells Ridge he is not being selfish. He has been very generous with her. What they have done together is amazing. Ridge says yes but he should not have asked her to keep it a secret and lie to her husband. Rick gets a call from a vendor and says he must run. He will see Caroline at home and he tells Ridge he might want to get a jumpstart on that resignation. Caroline tells Ridge that she will talk to Rick later. He says Rick will not like that. Caroline says Rick sees things in black and white, who's on top and who gets credit. She says they have created something and she feels plugged into something bigger than both of them ..a creative energy that she has never felt before and she is not ready to give up on that.",
        "Ridge goes home and Katie is surprised to see him early. He says he had to get out of the office. Rick knows and he even stuck a pencil in his face and demanded he draw. Katie says Rick has been questioning her too but she never thought Caroline would tell him. And now he wants Ridge to resign. But Caroline is going to talk to him and maybe there won't be a problem. And Rick has always wanted him gone so that is not news. He says but Caroline does not want him gone and she realizes how special their combined gift is. Caroline comes home and it is a bit frosty. She says again that working with Ridge has been amazing and Rick humiliated him. He shoved a pencil in his face and that was not fair. She doesn't want this to be a big deal and asks him to come give his wife a kiss. He turns and leaves and says he has to clear his head. Ridge tells Katie to stop blaming Caroline. He did this. He told her not to tell Rick so this is not fair to blame her now. Ridge says he is not quitting and Rick will not go to his dad and tell him before the line is finished and on the runway. He doesn't know when he will be able to draw again but until then he is going to see this through. He thanks Katie for understanding. Caroline goes to bed alone. The door opens and she sits up expecting Rick. A man walks toward her. He sits on her bed, she runs her hand up his arm and he pulls her nightgown strap aside and Ridge kisses her. Suddenly Caroline is awakened when Rick comes in. He sits on her bed and apologizes that he got so worked up. He admits that he was a bit jealous she was spending so much time with Ridge and then to hear her talk about how he fulfills her and maybe he wants to be that person that fulfills her. With a frown on her face, they hug. She admits that she is sorry and did not mean to make him feel that way."

        "Ridge: You can't fire me.",
        "Rick: I'm not gonna have to. You're gonna resign. You see, quality and integrity -- that's what our clients have come to expect from us, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: And that's what they get.",
        "Rick: Not from you. Not since you had that accident in Abu Dhabi.",
        "Ridge: The collection is good.",
        "Rick: Thanks to my wife.",
        "Ridge: She's been very helpful, yes.",
        "Rick: She's been covering for you because you can't draw. You know, Ridge, I knew something was up. You told me to be patient, and I would get those designs.",
        "Ridge: And you did.",
        "Rick: Because of Caroline. You have put this company and this collection at risk because you couldn't tell the truth. You took credit for her drawings... and that makes you a fraud.",
        "Donna: One event can really change everything.",
        "Katie: Oh, thank God bill was there. He knew exactly what to do.",
        "Donna: Thank goodness.",
        "Katie: It was terrifying.",
        "Donna: I mean, he couldn't breathe at all?",
        "Katie: No. But he's fine now, right? Right? You're fine now.",
        "Donna: Yeah. What about you?",
        "Katie: I'm -- I'm relieved. I'm grateful.",
        "Donna: So, you're good, then?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Donna: It's okay if you're not. I mean, you can tell me.",
        "Katie: Tell you what?",
        "Donna: I don't know. I just -- I-I feel like ever since will's accident and Brooke's surprise trip to Milan...I haven't really talked to you at all.",
        "Katie: We talk almost every day.",
        "Donna: I know, but I don't really know what's going on.",
        "Katie: Nothing's going on.",
        "Donna: So, no plans? You and Ridge haven't set a wedding date?",
        "Katie: You know, Ridge -- he's been very focused on his work. He's got a lot of deadlines to meet.",
        "Donna: So, no wedding plans?",
        "Katie: No, not yet.",
        "Donna: But soon, right? I mean, right? I'm sorry. I-I don't mean to bring up a bad subject if it is one.",
        "Katie: No, we've had other priorities, and we've been focused on his recovery, his work.",
        "Donna: You don't have to tell me he's busy. I-I get it.",
        "Katie: He makes time for me and for will and R.J.",
        "Donna: But his mind's at the office.",
        "Katie: Well, he -- he's under a lot of pressure to deliver this collection. I mean, Rick's really been on him.",
        "Donna: [Chuckles] If Rick has a problem with the collection, he should talk to his wife, not Ridge.",
        "Katie: Well, what's that supposed to mean?",
        "Donna: I'm at the office, Katie. I-I can see what's going on. Look, you say Ridge is focused on the collection... but he's spending a lot of time with Caroline.",
        "Ridge: If you have a problem with the collection, you can talk to dad about it. If he has a problem with it, he can talk to me.",
        "Rick: And then what? You'll fix it?",
        "Ridge: If I find it necessary, yes.",
        "Rick: All right, then show me. Do it. I asked you to do it before. Please.",
        "Ridge: The designs are fine the way they are.",
        "Rick: You mean the way that Caroline drew them.",
        "Ridge: We worked on them together.",
        "Rick: No, you're passing her designs off as your own.",
        "Ridge: No, I'm not.",
        "Rick: Prove it. Come on. Take the pencil. My wife's always going on what a genius you are. I'd love to see the genius at work. Come on, Ridge. Go ahead. Draw something.",
        "Caroline: Rick, stop. What are you doing? Leave him alone.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Donna: Will's okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, he's fine. He's just fussy, and I'm jumpy.",
        "Donna: Well, who can blame you, right? I mean, will's accident, and... here I am making you uncomfortable.",
        "Katie: You're not making me uncomfortable.",
        "Donna: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to suggest anything with Ridge and Caroline.",
        "Katie: It's just work. That's all.",
        "Donna: I know, but Ridge usually works alone.",
        "Katie: He's collaborated with people in the past -- you know, Eric and Brooke.",
        "Donna: So, he and Caroline are a team, then?",
        "Katie: Yeah. You know, he's giving her guidance, and it's been good for him, too. It's opened up his process and forced him to focus on the fundamentals.",
        "Donna: Yeah, of course. You know, when you put it that way, it actually kind of makes sense.",
        "Katie: Listen, Rick and Caroline are happily married. Ridge and I are happily engaged, and after this collection is over, then we'll be happily married, too.",
        "Donna: I know. I know. I wasn't, uh -- I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: No, don't be. Listen, our marriage or our wedding has gotten sidetracked because Ridge went missing in Abu Dhabi, and we've had to focus on his recovery and this collection, but it's just temporary delays.",
        "Donna: So, nothing's changed?",
        "Katie: No. Our feelings for each other haven't changed.",
        "Donna: Okay. I just -- you know, I just want my sisters to be happy. I want you to get married to Ridge, and I want you to move on with your life.",
        "Katie: Believe me -- that's all I want, too.",
        "Caroline: Why are you doing this?",
        "Rick: All he had to do was tell the truth, and he won't.",
        "Caroline: You're attacking him.",
        "Rick: He's lying.",
        "Ridge: I'm not resigning.",
        "Caroline: You asked him to resign?",
        "Ridge: He didn't really ask, did he?",
        "Caroline: Whoa. Baby, look, I love you, but you are overreacting.",
        "Rick: Overreacting? He's putting Forrester in jeopardy. As president, I can't allow that.",
        "Ridge: I'm not jeopardizing anything. The collection is good.",
        "Rick: My wife is a good designer.",
        "Caroline: And working with Ridge has made me a better one. Rick, please, you know how much this means to me.",
        "Rick: He's not helping you, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: Yes, he is!",
        "Rick: He's telling everybody that these designs are his!",
        "Caroline: They are his designs. They're his ideas. They came out of his mind.",
        "Rick: Okay, who put them on paper?",
        "Caroline: I am so sorry.",
        "Rick: Why are you apologizing to him?",
        "Caroline: Because this isn't fair! Ridge has suffered a terrible loss.",
        "Rick: I see. It's all -- it's all coming to me now. Is that what you did? You conned her into feeling sorry for you?",
        "Caroline: I am getting hands-on instruction from a fashion visionary. Ridge has shown me things that no other designer could -- could possibly explain or describe. He's sharing his instincts with me.",
        "Rick: He's using you, Caroline. He couldn't do it without you.",
        "Caroline: I couldn't do it without him! We're a team.",
        "Rick: He asked you to keep a secret. He didn't want anybody to know about it. I mean, what were you gonna do, Ridge? You were gonna call her up on the runway and thank her in front of everyone? Show your gratitude? No. 'Cause your ego can't handle that.",
        "Caroline: I knew what I was getting myself into, and I agreed to go along with it.",
        "Rick: It's not going any further. This arrangement's over... as is your tenure at Forrester.",
        "Caroline: No, I don't need credit.",
        "Rick: You know, you could have just told us. You could have been honest with us. You could have told dad. You -- you could have told everyone. They would have understood. Dad would have helped you. But you tried to pass these designs off as yours. You told us that you had them, and you didn't. You told us that the work was yours, and it wasn't.",
        "Ridge: I care about this collection more than anyone.",
        "Rick: You're unprofessional and selfish.",
        "Caroline: No, you're wrong. Okay? Don't do this.",
        "Ridge: Let him get it off his chest.",
        "Caroline: No. You're not selfish. You've been incredibly generous with me. What we have done together is amazing. This line -- you can feel the focus and precision of every stroke. Every detail is essential. And we did that together.",
        "Ridge: But I shouldn't have asked you to lie to your husband.",
        "Rick: [Scoffs] Wow. That's the first true thing I've heard you say all month.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rick: It's a vendor. I've got to take this. I'll see you at home. If I were you, I'd get a jump start on that resignation. Yeah, this is Rick.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Caroline: I'll talk to him.",
        "Ridge: You've done enough.",
        "Caroline: No, we have to keep going.",
        "Ridge: He doesn't want that.",
        "Caroline: That's because Rick sees things in black and white. He -- all that matters to him is who's on top, who gets credit. But he doesn't understand. We're creating something that has never existed before, and, yeah, maybe it's in a way that no one has ever tried, but when we draw together, I feel plugged into something bigger than both of us -- a creative energy that I have never felt before -- and I am not ready to give that up.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Hi. You're home early.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Yeah, I had to get out of the office.",
        "Katie: Hey. Mm. I wish I had known. I would have had will stay up. You could have seen him before he went to bed.",
        "Ridge: I'll go check on him. Can I talk to you for a minute... about me and Caroline?",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Rick knows.",
        "Katie: About you?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. He stuck a pencil in my face and asked me to draw something.",
        "Katie: Why would he do that?",
        "Ridge: Because Caroline told him that I couldn't.",
        "Katie: She what? She told him?",
        "Ridge: She feels terrible about it.",
        "Katie: How did this happen? It couldn't have just slipped out. I mean, you've worked so hard to keep it a secret.",
        "Ridge: I -- he was suspicious, and he just, uh, kept forcing the issue.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I told him not to worry about it.",
        "Ridge: What do you mean you told him not to worry about it?",
        "Katie: Well, he was asking questions. He's been wondering what you've been doing with Caroline. I can't believe she would tell him.",
        "Ridge: Well, she did, and now he wants me to resign.",
        "Katie: He wants you out of the company?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Katie: You delivered a collection. That's what he wanted. You did what he wanted.",
        "Ridge: It was a good collection, but he thinks it was all Caroline's work and that she should have all the credit.",
        "Katie: So, is that what this is really all about?",
        "Ridge: No, no, it's -- no. [Sighs] No. Uh, she's gonna talk to him.",
        "Katie: She's gonna talk to him? She's the one who caused this problem.",
        "Ridge: Well, maybe when she talks to him, hopefully, there won't be a problem.",
        "Katie: \"Hopefully\"? Ridge, what she's done could ruin your career.",
        "Ridge: What she's done is help get my designs on paper.",
        "Katie: Her husband wants you gone before they hit the runway.",
        "Ridge: He's always wanted me gone. That's not news.",
        "Katie: Well, thanks to Caroline, that could happen.",
        "Ridge: But she doesn't want me gone. She appreciates what we have and how special it is, and his temper and jealousy's not gonna interfere with that.",
        "Caroline: I stopped by your office before I left. The call didn't take very long.",
        "Rick: I cut it short. My head wasn't in it.",
        "Caroline: Sorry.",
        "Rick: No more apologies, all right?",
        "Caroline: You don't think that you owe me one?",
        "Rick: Caroline, I was just looking out for you.",
        "Caroline: After you accused Ridge of using me -- as if I would ever let that happen. And then you berated him and threatened his job.",
        "Rick: I gave him an opportunity to tell the truth. He didn't want to.",
        "Caroline: You tried to humiliate him by forcing a pencil in his hand. He didn't deserve that.",
        "Rick: I can't believe you're still defending him.",
        "Caroline: Ridge and I are artists. I understand what he's going through. But what we do -- it -- it's more than that. It's -- it's who we are. It's -- it's what we're made of. So not being able to draw -- it's like not being able to breathe.",
        "Rick: He should have told Dad.",
        "Caroline: He didn't want to tell anyone. He wasn't gonna tell me. I just figured it out. And then when I found out that I could help, I had to do it.",
        "Rick: Because he made you feel that way.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God. Hi. I'm sorry. Have we ever met? Caroline Spencer- Forrester. Super nice to meet you. No one makes me do anything. The choices that I make -- yeah, maybe they're not always right, but they are always mine. Working with Ridge has been amazing. It is the most fulfilling thing in my entire career.",
        "Rick: As president of this company, I have to see what kind of effect it'll have on the business.",
        "Caroline: Okay, but I don't want it to have an effect on us.",
        "Rick: And neither do I.",
        "Caroline: Okay. So then why do we have to make this such a big deal? Why can't we just put this all behind us? You just get so worked up sometimes. You -- baby, you get so intense, especially when it comes to things about me. I... just come give your wifey a kiss.",
        "Rick: I have to clear my head.",
        "Caroline: Rick?",
        "Katie: I just can't believe that this is happening. I know how fiercely you guarded this secret.",
        "Ridge: I tried.",
        "Katie: You kept it from your father. I kept it from my sisters.",
        "Ridge: I thought it was gonna come back to me. I thought this thing with Caroline was gonna be a breakthrough.",
        "Katie: You trusted her.",
        "Ridge: Can you stop doing that? It's not her fault.",
        "Katie: How can you say that? She knows your history with Rick. Every time the two of you butt heads, she takes his side.",
        "Ridge: Well, not today.",
        "Katie: Because she's already handed him all the ammunition he needs.",
        "Ridge: Please listen to me. I did this. I told you what was going on, and I asked her not to tell Rick. That's not fair.",
        "Katie: Okay, so now what?",
        "Ridge: I'm not quitting.",
        "Katie: Rick could go to your father.",
        "Ridge: He's not going to my father. He's a businessman. He's not gonna start off some scandal before the line is finished.",
        "Katie: What about after?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. Maybe I'll learn how to draw again. But until that happens, I have to see this through with Caroline.",
        "Katie: You've been giving this an awful lot of your attention.",
        "Ridge: And you've been great. Thanks for understanding. [Sighs]",
        "Katie: I think I'm just beginning to realize how important this is to you.",
        "Rick: Caroline? I'm sorry. You're right. I can get worked up. I can get -- I can get intense because of you. [Chuckles] I guess -- I guess you don't have to be an artist to be passionate about things. All this time that you're spending with Ridge and -- and how you talk about him and how he fulfills you -- did you ever think that -- that maybe I want to be the person to fulfill you...and that maybe I'm a little bit jealous?",
        "Caroline: I-I didn't mean to make you feel that way. I'm sorry."
