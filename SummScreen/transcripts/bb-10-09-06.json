Brooke tells Ridge she can't look for safety and security anymore, that isn't Nick anyway. She needs to look for passion and the thrill. Nick rushes in and wants to explain that the pregnancy has nothing to do with him; it's not his child. Ridge tries to throw him out, but Nick shouts at him to butt out! Nick asks for forgiveness, but she says there is no excuse for his behavior. Ridge makes his pitch in front of Nick \u0096 to end her marriage and reach out and take what he has to offer."

        "Ridge: I still don't understand. What happened? You left Nick? For good? Why?",
        "Brooke: I have no choice, Ridge. I could never live with Nick after what he did.",
        "Donna: Your husband loves you so much, Brooke. And you love him. What would he do that you can't get past?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Answer -- answer it! It's going straight to voice mail. Brooke -- Brooke, it's me. There's been a big mistake. Bridget's baby, it's not mine. I'm not the father. We've got to talk about this. I'm coming straight to the house. Don't go anywhere.",
        "Bridget: Wait, Nick, she's not there. She doesn't want you to find her. Trust me, she knows that's the first place that you'll look.",
        "Nick: Well, I'm not gonna sit around here and do nothing.",
        "Bridget: Nick, I think Ridge is expected back tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Come on, Stephanie. Let's get away from the window, all right? Come on.",
        "Stephanie: No, I want to know what's going on in there.",
        "Eric: It's none of our business.",
        "Stephanie: Of course it's our business. I want Ridge and Brooke together again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You don't have to tell me anything, not until you're ready.",
        "Brooke: I can't believe all this -- I mean, how could I have been so wrong?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Donna: Forrester guesthouse.",
        "Nick: Is Brooke there?",
        "Donna: Nick, yes, she is.",
        "Nick: Put her on, please?",
        "Donna: Brooke, it's your husband.",
        "Brooke: I don't want to talk to him.",
        "Donna: Will you give the man a chance?",
        "Brooke: Forget it!",
        "Donna: She doesn't want to talk to you.",
        "Nick: Put her on the phone.",
        "Ridge: The lady says she doesn't want to talk to you. I don't know what you did, but Brooke's a wreck. So just stay the hell away from her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You're right, Forrester is back. I gotta get over there.",
        "Bridget: I'm coming with you.",
        "Nick: No, no. I gotta handle this myself. I gotta get to Brooke before this guy causes any more damage.",
        "Brooke: Thank you. I didn't want to hear nick's voice.",
        "Donna: I have to say, your husband sounded very concerned. He wasn't angry, he just wanted to talk to you.",
        "Brooke: I'm finished with him, Donna. He's a man of all words. He makes promises, but he doesn't deliver.",
        "Donna: Would you at least tell me what he did?",
        "Brooke: No!",
        "Ridge: Donna --",
        "Donna: No, please, don't ask me to leave. I have a stake in this. You were over Ridge. You were totally into Nick, and finally he was starting to break free of you. Why are you doing this? Why are you coming here crying on his shoulder? When you have a problem with your marriage, you work it out with your husband. That's what being married means.",
        "Ridge: Donna --",
        "Donna: No, what about you? Look at my sister's hand. That is a wedding ring! She's married to Nick Marone. Why are you letting her drag you into this melodrama?",
        "Ridge: No one's dragging me. I know exactly what I'm doing.",
        "Donna: Really? Do you know she won't be running back to him tomorrow? Ridge, please, don't -- don't let her do this. Brooke, you are being spoiled and selfish.",
        "Ridge: Donna, please -- please, let me talk to Brooke alone.",
        "Ridge: Look at you.",
        "Brooke: I'm a mess. I gave my heart to Nick, and I just didn't think he would betray me. But he did.",
        "Ridge: Look, we're alone now. I really want to know, what did he do to you? Tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Temper, temper, temper. What did they do, give you the boot?",
        "Donna: I just needed some air.",
        "Stephanie: Ridge isn't home five minutes, and Brooke is here?",
        "Donna: Stephanie, could I just be alone, please?",
        "Stephanie: Honey, read the handwriting on the wall very carefully. It says Ridge is just killing time with you until your sister comes to her senses.",
        "Donna: That's not true. Besides, my sister is married to Nick, who has no intention of giving her up.",
        "Stephanie: It doesn't matter what his intentions are. Ridge arrives here and Brooke is here five minutes later. That tells me everything I need to know.",
        "Donna: And why do you need to know, Stephanie? Have you ever asked yourself that?",
        "Stephanie: Many times. Because the people I love, I want to see that they're happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Honey, honey, what is it? What is it? What's wrong?",
        "Bridget: Daddy --",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Bridget: I just made such a mess of things.",
        "Eric: What is it, sweetie? What have you done that's so horrible? What is it?",
        "Bridget: I'm pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Logan, what did Nick do?",
        "Brooke: I was afraid that I would love you too much. Of how hurt I would be if I lost you again. And I couldn't handle that.",
        "Ridge: You went looking for security, but there's a price to pay for that.",
        "Brooke: No, I was afraid of being abandoned. And with Nick, I thought that I had found that safe place. But you know what? He is just a man. He is not perfect. My god, he is far from perfect.",
        "Ridge: I'm not perfect either.",
        "Brooke: No, no one is. Do you know what that means? That means you can't live your life looking for security, because it's just an illusion. We have to look for passion, for the thrill. And you were always so patient with me, Ridge. You even asked me to come back to you. But I didn't. I didn't because I was living that illusion. But not anymore. Nick is definitely not that safe place for me. He's not security. He doesn't exist in my life anymore.",
        "Nick: Brooke!",
        "Brooke: Nick, don't talk to me. Go away!",
        "Nick: I made a mistake, one that I'm very sorry for.",
        "Brooke: Sorry? So that makes it better?",
        "Nick: I need you to listen to me, please.",
        "Ridge: You heard the lady, she doesn't want you here.",
        "Nick: This is between me and my wife, Forrester.",
        "Ridge: I'll throw you out myself.",
        "Nick: You need to hear this, Brooke. It changes everything.",
        "Brooke: Oh, let me guess. You just dreamed that you slept with Bridget. Oh, that's funny, she had the same dream, too!",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Nick: No.",
        "Ridge: All right, that's it. You're outta here!",
        "Nick: The pregnancy's got nothing to do with me. It isn't my child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: I don't care whether you like me or not. That isn't the point.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, yes, it is. Because we're a very tight-knit family.",
        "Donna: Is that your term for a family with a domineering mother who won't let her children grow up and make their own decisions?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, and your experience with motherhood might be, what, exactly? Let me ask you a question. What's important to you? What really matters? Is it just how you look? Because what's going on here is a lot deeper than that.",
        "Donna: I'm going in there and talking to Ridge, telling him that he's making a big mistake --",
        "Stephanie: Stop. Donna, stop wasting everyone's time. Especially your own. You're never going to have Ridge. Ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: You're pregnant? For god's sake, Bridget!",
        "Bridget: Dad --",
        "Eric: How can a girl who's so smart -- smart enough to graduate from medical school in record time -- be such a slow learner?",
        "Bridget: Dad, it's not like this baby is from some stranger at a bar.",
        "Eric: Well, whose baby is it?",
        "Bridget: Well, I thought that it was Nick's.",
        "Eric: You -- Nick's?",
        "Bridget: Just -- Dad, listen to me. It was just -- it was one of those moments where mom ran to Ridge again. And Nick thought his marriage was over. I happened to be there. Dad, you know that I never stopped loving Nick. You should have seen him. He was in so much pain, and I wanted to comfort him and just hold him and try to -- I wanted to take that pain away from him. Then one thing led to another and -- we were gonna try to keep this between us, but I found out I was pregnant.",
        "Eric: Does Brooke know?",
        "Bridget: She does now. Nick told her that the baby was his. He confessed everything.",
        "Eric: But the baby is not Nick's?",
        "Bridget: No.",
        "Eric: Bridget, for god's sake, who's the father of this baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Oh, this is incredible. You sleep with Brooke's daughter, you get her pregnant, and now you come back here trying to cover your tracks?",
        "Nick: I want to talk to Brooke alone.",
        "Ridge: Get out!",
        "Brooke: It -- it isn't your child?",
        "Nick: No. None of this would have happened if you'd just leave her alone.",
        "Ridge: Oh, that's right, Nick. Try and blame it on me.",
        "Nick: Well, you should take a little blame, Forrester. You just wouldn't let her go the whole time. You've been butting in all along.",
        "Brooke: Stop it. Stop fighting! Nick, just tell me the truth.",
        "Nick: The doctors confirmed it. The timing's wrong. It's not my child. We don't have to live with that.",
        "Ridge: You think people are just gonna forget being betrayed?",
        "Nick: Where do you get off, Forrester?",
        "Ridge: I never cheated on Brooke, the entire time we were married.",
        "Nick: Oh, please, you climbed into her bed when we were engaged! A marriage is between two people. But you never let her go, did you, Forrester? You just never let her out of your mind.",
        "Ridge: I've got news for you, Nick. She still hasn't let go of me, either.",
        "Nick: We're gonna work this out. The two of us, Forrester. You're not involved in this relationship anymore. So butt out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: You really want Brooke and Ridge together again, don't you?",
        "Stephanie: Yes.",
        "Donna: My sister said you always hated her.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I did. That's true. But then I had a realization. She makes him happy. And as domineering as you might think I am, I do respect his feelings. I want him to be happy.",
        "Donna: And the fact that Brooke is married to Nick? You don't see that as an obstacle?",
        "Stephanie: Not an insurmountable one. Donna, the best thing that you could do would be to leave, for your own sake.",
        "Donna: I am not leaving until Ridge tells me to leave.",
        "Stephanie: Hang on to your dignity and your self-respect. Do you really want to hear him say that? It'll be so hurtful. Don't put yourself through that. You know what's going on in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: It's Dante's.",
        "Eric: It's Dante's.",
        "Bridget: When we were still together, we thought that we were pregnant, and then we thought that we weren't because the test was negative. But it turns out that I was pregnant.",
        "Eric: Bridget --",
        "Bridget: I can't imagine how disappointed you are in me.",
        "Eric: I'm trying really hard not to be. Have you told Dante?",
        "Bridget: I just found out.",
        "Eric: And Felicia?",
        "Bridget: Oh, my god. Oh, Felicia -- she's gonna want to kill me.",
        "Eric: Yeah. Yeah, she's gonna want to kill you. I'll do my best to try to keep that from happening. She loves you, honey. Look, let's just focus on you right now. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Bridget: I wish there was, dad.",
        "Eric: Yeah, so do I.",
        "Bridget: I wanted a baby for so long, I just never -- I just didn't want it like this. Oh, god, I feel like I have ruined everything.",
        "Eric: All right. Come here. Come here a second. Come here. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Okay, so Bridget's child might not be yours. I see that as just a technicality.",
        "Nick: I'm asking for forgiveness.",
        "Ridge: You don't deserve it.",
        "Nick: I made a mistake that I'll regret the rest of my life. But I cannot have you running to this man time and time again. It's too much for me. It pushed me to the edge.",
        "Brooke: There are no excuses for what you did, Nick. You let me down, like everybody else. And I thought you were different.",
        "Nick: I'm sorry. But the life we want, the future we dreamed of, it's right there, Brooke. It's still there ahead of us. You gotta find it in your heart to forgive me.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, until next time.",
        "Nick: Stay out of this!",
        "Ridge: Logan, there's a future here for you and me, too. You came to me tonight because you believe that we're meant to be together.",
        "Nick: Oh, my god. How many times have you let this woman down?",
        "Ridge: I have let you down. This is true. But not like this. Never like this. All this man's ever had to offer you is a little security, a little safety. Well, he's failed at both. You know what I offer you. And you know it's what you want. So end this marriage now. We can have the life that we've always wanted, Brooke. It's right here, right here in front of you. And all you have to do is reach out and take it."
