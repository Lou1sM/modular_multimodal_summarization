    "Recap": [
        "Zende and Nicole share kisses at work and he teases her about the other interns he has kissed. Maya springs the news on Rick that she is ready to start a family and she'd like a baby. Rick thinks that is fine and says he has already been looking into adoption since it worked out so well with Zende. She agrees but asks how he would feel abut surrogacy as then it would be part of both of them. Ivy assures Steffy that she will do whatever she wants. Steffy hands her a little almost nothing and tells her to get ready to walk the runway, she will model the bedroom lingerie line. Ivy shows it to Wyatt and says it was Steffy's idea, classic and she walked straight into it. She is scared of staring at everyone in her underwear. Wyatt says this is exactly the reaction Steffy wants out of her, pulling her strings. She should not let her do that. She is gorgeous and Ivy does not have to be self conscious. Whatever she wears will fly off the shelves. He dares her to put the outfit on or he will. Liam is shocked that Steffy assumed Ivy would want to do this or die trying. He knows what she is doing \u0096 making Ivy's life a living hell just because she can. She's having too much fun.",
        "Rick thinks Maya's plan can happen. She says she has been reading too and it might be unique but not impossible. Nicole would be the answer if she would do it. Wyatt waits anxiously for Ivy and she walks out and does not disappoint. She looks WOW. Not only can she do this, she will be the sexiest model they have ever seen on the runway. That is his unbiased opinion. Hot dayum! Nicole comes home and Maya and Rick say she is right on cue and they would like to talk to her. She is surprised they want to start a family and they have been looking into it. She is behind them 100% and says they deserve happiness. But she is stunned when Maya asks if she will be their surrogate and give them a baby."

        "Rick: Well, maybe we shouldn't head back to the office after all. Maybe we should just head upstairs.",

        "Rick: Suddenly came down with the flu?",
        "Maya: Would never work.",
        "Rick: Why?",
        "Maya: Pam. She'd run over here with her famous chicken soup, trying to nurse us back to health.",
        "Rick: Well, just bolt the door, keep her out.",
        "Maya: She would climb in through the window.",
        "Rick: Then we'll get a ferocious guard dog. Wait. Cancel that. Pam's got a way with dogs.",
        "Maya: Does she?",
        "Rick: You've never heard of Tiny. He was, like, Pam's beloved Doberman. It was like her baby.",
        "Maya: Well, maybe we should have one of those.",
        "Rick: A dog?",
        "Maya: A baby.",

        "Zende: Come on, girl. Enough rehydrating. It's time to pump some iron.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] And mess up my new workout clothes? Which, by the way, you have not commented on them.",
        "Zende: How are you able to afford new workout clothes on an intern's salary?",
        "Nicole: I budget. 90% of my income goes towards the essentials.",
        "Zende: That's right -- makeup, shoes, handbags.",
        "Nicole: Hey. Who needs food anyway?",
        "Zende: Speaking of which, you're still letting me cook dinner for you tonight, right?",
        "Nicole: You really want to?",
        "Zende: Absolutely. But there's only one problem. I don't really know what you like most. Or...maybe I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Okay. How does this sound? \"Effective immediately, Ivy Forrester will be rejoining our team, again working alongside Quinn Fuller on the jewelry line in addition to being the face and the body of the bedroom line.\"",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: What? Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] I mean, I've had all kinds of second thoughts. Traipsing around in my underwear -- Steffy, I've said it before. It just -- it doesn't feel like me.",
        "Steffy: Okay. If you want to drop out of this, then...",
        "Ivy: I'm not dropping out. I'm not dropping out. I-if you want me to model lingerie, then I will be modeling lingerie.",
        "Steffy: Okay. That's great. I like to hear that.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: So, let's choose this one.",
        "Ivy: What is that?",
        "Steffy: You're gonna have to feel free on and off the catwalk and in front of the camera. Whatever inhibitions you have, you need to lose them, like, now. So, try it on. Actually, in fact, try it on for Wyatt. Just get comfortable with it, okay?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Thanks.",
        "Steffy: All right. See you later.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",

        "Liam: What was that?",
        "Steffy: Oh, it's just first-day jitters. She'll be fine. I think.",
        "Liam: Well, you seem okay with it. Ivy being back, I mean.",
        "Steffy: I'm not okay, but I'm making the most of my situation.",

        "Wyatt: Why aren't you at the office? I-I thought you would have been there since the crack of dawn.",
        "Ivy: Oh, no. Yeah, I was.",
        "Wyatt: Did you make nice with Steffy?",
        "Ivy: Do you, uh -- do you recognize this?",
        "Wyatt: Um... [Clears throat] Not really.",
        "Ivy: Okay, interesting. Because you will when you see me modeling it on the runway.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Wh-what?",
        "Ivy: It's my new job -- modeling the bedroom line. And guess whose brilliant idea that was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Do you always kiss your workout partners?",
        "Zende: Only the cute ones.",
        "Nicole: How many cute ones have there been?",
        "Zende: Uh, let's see. There was Brit.",
        "Nicole: Brit.",
        "Zende: Oh, there was Samantha. There was Vanessa. Uh, there was that cutie with the gorgeous blue eyes. What was her name again?",
        "Nicole: You are so full of it.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: If there is one thing you are not, Zende Forrester, it's a player. You're too sweet. And if anyone should know, it's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: What do you think?",
        "Rick: A baby?",
        "Maya: We've talked about children, starting a family.",
        "Rick: I see that look on your face every time you see a mother with a stroller. I love that look.",
        "Maya: We're married. We're happy.",
        "Rick: Happier than I've ever been in my life.",
        "Maya: Me, too. I want a family, Rick. I want a baby with you.",

        "Liam: Because I can read you. Come on. Out with it.",
        "Steffy: It's not a big deal. I just took Ivy at her word.",
        "Liam: About...?",
        "Steffy: She said she'd do anything to prove herself, so I -- I made her the face of the bedroom line.",
        "Liam: What?!",
        "Steffy: What do you mean what? Well, I-I'm too busy at work, not to mention I'm the president of this company, so --",
        "Liam: Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. You -- are you kidding me right now? You -- you expect Ivy to model our lingerie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: A lingerie model?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. It was Steffy's brilliant idea, of course.",
        "Wyatt: Wait, you think she did this to you on purpose?",
        "Ivy: What else am I supposed to think?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: She tells her granddad that she and I can work together again, and then, the second he leaves the room, she comes up with this idea. It is classic Steffy, and I walked straight into it.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, okay. So, what -- what is your point?",
        "Ivy: My point is...I'm terrified of doing this, Wyatt. I don't want to be stared at by everyone in my underwear.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Ivy: It's a nightmare of mine, okay? I've actually had nightmares about this. And I don't want to do it.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, calm -- calm --",
        "Ivy: I don't want to stand up there on a runway in this. And if that's what it takes for me to be a part of Forrester again, then I don't -- I don't want to do that. I don't want to be a part of that.",
        "Wyatt: This is exactly the reaction Steffy wants out of you. Okay? She wants you to react this way. You know, she's -- she's pulling your strings, Ivy. Are you gonna let her do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: You still at it?",
        "Zende: Couple more, and I'm done. Time to hit the showers. Uh, you want to scrub my back?",
        "Nicole: I'm kind of not dressed for it.",
        "Zende: Well, I mean, that's kind of the point. You get undressed.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, I take it back. You're not all that sweet.",
        "Zende: Uh-oh. [Chuckles] I better redeem myself.",
        "Nicole: But how?",
        "Zende: Dinner. Tonight. I really want this to be special for us, if you know what I mean.",
        "Nicole: I might be otherwise occupied.",
        "Zende: Since when?",
        "Nicole: Since Pam texted me that Rick and Maya did not return from lunch.",
        "Zende: And you're worried something's wrong?",
        "Nicole: Not really, but I'm gonna head home anyway. Maya and I haven't had a long talk in, like, forever.",
        "Zende: Well...I hope you only have nice things to say about me.",
        "Nicole: Oh, by the way, I'm not a picky eater. Except for mushrooms. I hate mushrooms.",
        "Zende: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You're really serious about this.",
        "Maya: I know we haven't been married long, but why wait? Family's important.",
        "Rick: Absolutely.",
        "Maya: And I know my family has had its ups and downs, but honestly, that makes me even more excited to start our own family so that we can show our little son or daughter all of the unconditional love and support that we have to give.",
        "Rick: Can I make a confession? I've already been looking into adoption.",
        "Maya: Really?",
        "Rick: Well, it was so great for Zende. And there's so many kids just waiting for a good home. And who knows? We get the ball rolling, we could be lucky enough to have a child by Christmas.",
        "Maya: That sounds great. And I am a huge proponent of adoption.",
        "Rick: But...?",
        "Maya: I was hoping the baby could be part you and part me. How do you feel about surrogacy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, you don't understand. What Steffy's asking of me is -- it's just -- it's crazy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, it's something you don't feel comfortable doing. I get it.",
        "Ivy: No. It's not about being uncomfortable. It's like what I just said. This is my worst nightmare coming true.",
        "Wyatt: But see, that's just it. It shouldn't be.",
        "Ivy: [Groans]",
        "Wyatt: Ivy, look at you. You are gorgeous. You have no reason to be self- conscious. Trust me.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: These designs are gonna be flying off the shelves because of you. You're gonna be every man's fantasy. You're mine already. Seriously. So... what do you say... to giving me a little sneak peek?",
        "Ivy: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "Wyatt: Seriously?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Fine. I'll give you one.",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I'm not shy.",
        "Ivy: Oh, my God.",
        "Wyatt: I'm gonna look damn sexy in some pretty lace like this.",
        "Ivy: [Laughing] Oh, my God. You're actually being serious.",
        "Wyatt: I am serious. The only way that I am not gonna put this on is you put it on first. So, what's it gonna be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: This is so not a good idea.",
        "Steffy: You know, the bedroom line needs a spokesmodel. And now that Ivy's been rehired thanks to my wonderful granddad...",
        "Liam: Yeah, which is what this is really about, isn't it? Because you wouldn't have rehired Ivy.",
        "Steffy: The point is she's here. She's free. She's available. Why not put her front and center? I mean, she's wanted to be the face of Forrester, so much so that she blackmailed me for the position. So, not only will she be the face of the bedroom line, she will show off her entire body. What's the problem here?",
        "Liam: You do realize Ivy's not like you, right? I mean, she's shy. Prancing around in tiny underwear in front of cameras is not exactly her thing.",
        "Steffy: She'll get over it.",
        "Liam: Yeah, or she'll die trying.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] She'll be fine.",
        "Liam: You keep saying that, Steffy, but what if she's not?",
        "Steffy: You have nothing to worry about.",
        "Liam: I know what you're doing.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Liam: You are making Ivy's life a living hell, because you can.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Surrogacy.",
        "Maya: I want our child to be part of you, ideally part of both of us. What do you think?",
        "Rick: I think that would be great. But it can't really happen.",
        "Maya: Maybe it can. I've been reading online about surrogacy. And obviously our situation is unique, but it -- it might not be impossible. Would you be willing?",
        "Rick: Yeah. First we'd have to find a suitable surrogate mother, someone we trust, someone who's comfortable with us, someone we're comfortable with.",
        "Maya: I-I might be a step ahead of you.",
        "Rick: Have you already contacted someone?",
        "Maya: No, no. I wouldn't do that without talking to you first. But I do have someone in mind.",
        "Rick: Someone that we know?",
        "Maya: Someone who would make it possible for our baby to be both Avant and Forrester, who has the genes and the eggs -- the only person who could really do that for us.",
        "Rick: Uh, you're talking about...",
        "Maya: Would you be okay with that?",
        "Rick: Well, I haven't really -- haven't really thought about it. I think it would be a great answer.",
        "Maya: I think so, too.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Nicole: Oh, thank God. Pam had me convinced that you two had been taken hostage or kidnapped by aliens or something.",
        "Rick: Well, that's what we get for playing hooky.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Nicole: Oh, playing hooky, huh? Like I don't know what that's really about.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Should I go? I mean, I don't want to interrupt anything.",
        "Rick: No, you're fine. In fact, your timing couldn't be better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hey, I get it. I do. You're still resentful toward Ivy over the video thing.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I -- yeah, I'm pissed. My granddad wants us working together, but it's gonna take some time for her to earn back my trust.",
        "Liam: By...modeling lingerie for you?",
        "Steffy: If she wants to be a team player, I'm gonna throw her into the game.",
        "Liam: Okay, which proves that you're thinking of this like a game.",
        "Steffy: This is a huge opportunity for Ivy. Once she gets past her insecurities, who knows where this could lead.",
        "Liam: You're having too much fun with this.",
        "Steffy: It's lingerie. What's the big deal? There's no reason for Ivy to be insecure. That's why I told her to take some lingerie and wear it for Wyatt. If anyone's gonna talk her off a ledge, it's her boyfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Ivy? You okay in there? Yeah. There it is. Let's get it. Yeah.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Wow.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: You look... wow.",
        "Ivy: Thanks. Where we you when I was battling all my body issues?",
        "Wyatt: Trust me. You won that battle. And then some. Look at this.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I -- it's just -- look, modeling this in front of my boyfriend is one thing, but in front of photographers, on a runway, on television... do you actually think I can do this?",
        "Wyatt: Not only can you do this, you are gonna be the sexiest spokesmodel Forrester has ever seen.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Steffy who? Brooke what?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: That is nonsense. Okay. And I'm not trying to pressure you.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: I promise.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: This is totally your, like -- this is your decision. But in my unbiased opinion... [Chuckles] Hot damn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Are you sure I'm not interrupting something?",
        "Maya: Actually, you are.",
        "Nicole: Well, then, I will head back to the office.",
        "Maya: No, no, no, no. You live here, and besides, we wanted to talk to you about something.",
        "Nicole: Okay...",
        "Rick: Your sister and I were just discussing our future.",
        "Maya: Obviously, we're very happy together. And if our lives stayed the way they were right now, I would still feel so blessed.",
        "Nicole: Listen, I don't know what this is about, but I --",
        "Maya: It's about family. It's about sisters and how close we've become and...how much I love you.",
        "Nicole: I love you, too.",
        "Maya: And I know I wasn't always there for you, but I am now.",
        "Nicole: Me, too. Whatever you need.",
        "Maya: I hope you mean that.",
        "Rick: Nicole, what would you say if Maya and I told you that we're having a baby?",
        "Nicole: What?",
        "Maya: Rick and I want to start a family of our own.",
        "Nicole: Really?",
        "Maya: Yeah. We're -- we're both ready for it, and -- and it's something that we've been looking into.",
        "Nicole: Wow. That's awesome. I mean, you two would be great parents. And with all of the kids that need adopting --",
        "Maya: Well, yeah. Adoption is a way to go. But we're also thinking about surrogacy so that our little one can be part Rick.",
        "Nicole: A Forrester child.",
        "Maya: And I wanted to tell you first because of how much you mean to me and all of the support that you've given me and -- and how you've defended me and",
        "Nicole: Hey. What are little sisters for? Besides, you're the brave one. If anyone deserves to have their dreams come true, including a baby --",
        "Maya: A baby with both of our genes -- Rick's and mine -- so that it can be completely part of our family.",
        "Nicole: Right, I mean, that's certainly doable for Rick. Only it's not really possible for you.",
        "Rick: That's what I thought, too, until your sister suggested otherwise.",
        "Nicole: I don't understand.",
        "Maya: A baby that is part Avant and part Forrester. And since I can't do that... honey, I-I know that you're young, and you just moved to LA, and you're just starting your life. And I know that this is a huge thing for me to ask. But it would be the best and biggest gift that you could possibly give me. Would you be my surrogate? Would you have our baby?"
