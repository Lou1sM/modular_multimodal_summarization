        "Ridge: Tighter. Squeeze tighter!",
        "Brooke: Squeezes you any tighter, you're not going to be able to breathe. You really missed him?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Think he knows how much?",
        "Brooke: Oh, yes, he knows.",
        "Ridge: Even with his old man halfway around the world?",
        "Brooke: I always tell him how important he is to his daddy.",
        "Ridge: That's what makes us love mommy even more, doesn't it, sport? Okay. Here you go. Play with all of these. Check this out here. Yeah. Still, it's not really the same as being here with him every morning. Getting him dressed, making our breakfast together as a family, like we loved doing. And we know who to thank for that, don't we?",
        "Brooke: Ridge, if you're gonna launch in on Nick --",
        "Ridge: No. No, actually I don't have to. Popeye's screwed up the best thing in his life all by himself. And the truth is, I did the same thing when I walked out on you, Hope and R.J. But now, my love, we have the chance to be that family again, to have the life again. And this time, it will be forever. Because the thought of losing you ever again -- god, I want you back so much.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, just -- I just need you to be a little patient with me. I mean, this is a critical time in my life, and the children's lives. So I -- I need to do what's best for them.",
        "Ridge: I completely understand. I meant what I said. I'll give you the time to figure things out. But I know in my heart, the sooner we're together again -- okay, all right. I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead here.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Hey, come on, sport. Let's you and I mosey on down to Forrester and give mommy the time she needs. Come here.",
        "Brooke: You be good for daddy, you hear me? You be a good boy. Give me a kiss. Big kiss, okay?",
        "Ridge: I love you. I love you so much. Don't ever forget that. What do you think of that, sport, huh? Is that cool? I think so. Yeah, come on. Let's go to Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Oh, Nicky, I know you feel horribly. But you didn't sleep with Bridget to hurt your wife. You thought --",
        "Nick: It doesn't matter what I thought, Mother. I can't change what happened that night, or what's happened since. Bottom line is I'm not giving up on this marriage.",
        "Jackie: Where are you going?",
        "Nick: She needs space. I understand that. But if I know ridge and that dragon lady mother of his, they're moving in for the kill. And I'm not gonna let that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Attorney: Stephanie, you do realize how unorthodox this is, having me draw up divorce papers without either party present?",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I do. But you know, Eric did the same thing to me, so -- I just don't want to take the time to wait for Brooke to -- to take the initiative.",
        "Attorney: Why are you in such a rush?",
        "Stephanie: I want to see my son happy. I want to see a reconciliation. And the sooner that happens, the sooner I can get control of the company again.",
        "Attorney: So, this is really all about getting the stock back?",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's a small part of it, Ben. I really want to see Ridge and Brooke and their child together. That really is the most important thing for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Taylor remembering]",
        "Alexandria: I love you.",
        "Phoebe: Mom, Uncle Thorne should be here soon. Are you really gonna go through with this?",
        "Taylor: I have to.",
        "Phoebe: Because you've fallen in love with him?",
        "Taylor: Because I can't look in his eyes and deceive him anymore, sweetheart. I hate myself. I hate myself for what I've done to your life, and all of our lives. [Knock at door] Okay. Go ahead.",
        "Thorne: Hey, Phoebe. I realize I'm a little early, but -- well, hello, gorgeous. Are you ready to head up the mountain?",
        "Phoebe: I love you, Mom.",
        "Taylor: I love you, too, sweetie, so much.",
        "Thorne: Is everything okay?",
        "Taylor: It will be very soon. I'm ready.",
        "Thorne: All right, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: You're getting way ahead of yourself with this.",
        "Stephanie: No, I'm not. She is not going to take Nick back after he slept with Bridget.",
        "Ridge: Hey, hey, hey, look who's here?",
        "Stephanie: Well, hi! And the big guy is here.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I picked him up on my way over here. I figured we'd spend the day together, make up for some lost time. Come here, big guy --",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's wonderful, honey. Was Nick -- was nick there when you picked him up?",
        "Ridge: He slept elsewhere.",
        "Stephanie: Good.",
        "Ridge: I can't believe how big he's gotten. We have been missing out on time here.",
        "Stephanie: Not for much longer.",
        "Ridge: I know that tone. What are you up to?",
        "Stephanie: Nothing. I just want to see --- look, I want you and Brooke and the baby together again. I want to see you happy.",
        "Ridge: So do I. But this is Brooke's life and Brooke's decision. Do not push her, understand?",
        "Stephanie: I do. Absolutely. I'd love to spend the afternoon with you, but I have a hair appointment --",
        "Eric: Stephanie --",
        "Stephanie: Love you. Love you. And the matter of fact, I love the baby, too.",
        "Ridge: I'm wasting my breath here, aren't I, asking her to give Brooke some space?",
        "Eric: Yes, I'm afraid you are. Ridge, her heart's in the right place.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, yeah, I know. But Nick's isn't. That SOB is major trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: That looks like trouble!",
        "Hope: Nick!",
        "Nick: Hey! Oh, sugarplum! I have missed you.",
        "Hope: You weren't at breakfast.",
        "Nick: No, I wasn't. 'Cause I was out getting these. Look!",
        "Hope: Doughnuts!",
        "Nick: Doughnuts. I figured you'd just take these to the park with you, huh? That's where you're going?",
        "Catherine: Yeah, we are. Ridge took R.J. to the office, so it's just us gals.",
        "Nick: Oh.",
        "Hope: You can come with!",
        "Nick: Well, I have to talk to mommy. I love you.",
        "Hope: Love you more!",
        "Nick: Okay. There, take your doughnuts. If you don't eat 'em all, I'll have one later.",
        "Hope: Bye, Nick!",
        "Brooke: Catherine, did you forget -- ?",
        "Nick: We've spent a night away from each other. Today's a new day. We got to get this figured out. So that's what we're gonna do. I know I was wrong to let what happen happen. But we're still married, Brooke, and we have a beautiful family.",
        "Brooke: You should've thought about that before you slept with my daughter.",
        "Nick: Which there's no excuse for. I've already told you that. But I'm not gonna share you with ridge. I'm not gonna share my marriage with him. And for a few moments, Bridget gave me the one thing -- the one thing I've so desperately wanted from you -- to just be the only man in your world.",
        "Brooke: I know I asked a lot from you --",
        "Nick: Including my forgiveness for the mistakes that you've made along the way, and I've given it to you every time. Because when you love somebody the way that I love you, you forgive them when they ask. So, I'm asking you now, as genuinely as I can, to let me make up for the damage I've done. And I know trust isn't rebuilt overnight. But I want you to be able to look at me, and not see the man who let you down, but see the man who regained your trust. I'm never gonna let you down again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Don't worry. I had the caretaker open up and build a fire.",
        "Taylor: That isn't all you had him do.",
        "Thorne: Yellow roses. They're your favorite, right?",
        "Taylor: I don't deserve this.",
        "Thorne: Hey, beautiful lady, you deserve this and a lot more. Besides, a guy's gotta set the mood, right? Listen, I know you thought I brought you up here for some time alone, but there's something else, too. But you're not gonna get it out of me until I'm ready. [Taylor sobs] Taylor, Taylor? Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong? Something I said? Is everything okay?",
        "Taylor: Thorne, you are the kindest. You are the most wonderful man -- it isn't you. It isn't anything you've done. It's me. It's something that I have done. I just -- I just pray you won't hate me when I tell you what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I swear I will do right by you, by us. If you just give me another chance. You're my wife. This is my family, my home.",
        "Stephanie: Not anymore. Not after you sign these papers.",
        "Nick: Brooke's not signing anything.",
        "Stephanie: There he goes again, telling you what to do.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, please, this is between Nick and me.",
        "Stephanie: There isn't any Nick and you anymore, not after what he's done. That's why I had the divorce attorney draw up the papers for you. One quick signature, and this whole, ugly mess will resolve itself, once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Hate you? I could never hate you. Taylor, I love you.",
        "Taylor: I don't -- I don't deserve your love.",
        "Thorne: Honey, come on. Nothing's that bad.",
        "Taylor: It is.",
        "Thorne: Come on, Taylor. I know you, okay?",
        "Taylor: No, no, you don't know me. You don't know everything. You don't know this.",
        "Thorne: What if I said I did? What if I already know what you're trying to tell me?",
        "Taylor: Then you'd be wrong.",
        "Thorne: You've taken a drink, or you're about to.",
        "Taylor: No, no, that isn't it. Not that I haven't been tempted.",
        "Thorne: But you're fighting it. Taylor, you're fighting it. And you're going to keep on fighting it, because you're one of the strongest people that I know.",
        "Taylor: No, Thorne. You are the strong one. I mean, you just lost your wife. This was the woman you adored. She was the mother of your child. And you've pulled it together. You've somehow been there for Ally, and then you've been there for me. You helped me.",
        "Thorne: With your help, Taylor. Ally and I would not be where we are today without you.",
        "Taylor: I wish I was the woman you believe I am, but I'm not. I've done things. Things I know I'm going to regret for the rest of my life. And when -- when I tell you what I know, it's going to hurt you terribly. And I'm -- I'm deeply, deeply sorry. But I owe you the truth. And I don't care if you end up hating me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You have got a hell of a nerve, lady.",
        "Stephanie: This from the man who sleeps with his wife's daughter?",
        "Brooke: Stop it, both of you! This is the last thing I need right now.",
        "Stephanie: You're right. You need a fresh start, and that's what these divorce papers are all about.",
        "Nick: This is about a mother who can't stay out of her grown son's life.",
        "Stephanie: The way your mother stays out of yours?",
        "Nick: I don't see her here fighting my battles for me.",
        "Stephanie: Nick, this isn't a contest. This is about Brooke's future.",
        "[Nick laughs]",
        "Nick: Her future? Right back in the bosom of the Forrester family again.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, with a family that loves her and respects her. You will never understand that.",
        "Nick: Oh, I understand. I understand this is a bunch of crap. I can't believe you can say it with a straight face.",
        "Stephanie: Brooke knows I mean this. I support you and Ridge 100%.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, please. Please, stop shoving those divorce papers in my face! This is a decision that involves the rest of my life and my children's lives. So, I need to make this decision. Not you, not Nick, not Ridge, not anybody.",
        "Nick: Brooke --",
        "Brooke: No, I want you both to leave. I mean it. I need to be alone. Go!",
        "Nick: You do realize you'll need my signature on those, too.",
        "Stephanie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nick: After you.",
        "Stephanie: I parked out back.",
        "Nick: I love you, always.",
        "[Brooke sighs]",
        "Stephanie: You knew I wouldn't leave. You knew I wouldn't. Not with your future, and R.J.'s and Ridge's future in the balance. Honey, I know -- I know you're concerned about Hope, because she adores Nick. But she loves Ridge, too. Sweetheart, this is a chance for you to reclaim your family, to put it all back together again, without any interference from me. Listen to your heart, please. You belong with Ridge. This marriage with Nick, it happened for all the wrong reasons. Come back. Come back to the man who loves you. Please, come back. You know I won't take no for an answer."
