He asks her to turn over and says it is hot in here. Slowly he removes his shirt showing off his tight rippling abs. She sits up and says he is so handsome; she cannot believe he does not have a girlfriend to which he replies he just has not found the right woman yet. She says his hands are magic and she could go on like this for hours. She is all his, every inch of her right there. Their lips are almost meeting. Mateo gives a sigh and comes out of his daydream. Bill lets Brooke in and she says texted him that she had made a decision.

Because of him she can now walk and hike and do all sorts of activities. Sheila calls Mateo to get a check up on his activities. He says he just finished with another session with Mrs. Forrester and she enjoyed it. Sheila says of course she did; she cannot resist temptation. He also says she is upstairs now with her husband; these things are gonna take more time. She says okay but it will happen. He says not to worry; he knows what he is doing. Bill tells Brooke that before she says anything he wants her to know that he has never loved a woman like he loves her. Yes they have had their obstacles but they finally made it to the altar and she accepted him complications and all and he knows they love each other. The vows they said were for better or worse and this is their test, the biggest test ever. He did not just let her down but compromised her trust in him as her husband and now he is left with a lot of anger at himself, at Liam and the world. He says he wants to fix that. He feels like he is losing himself and he needs her. He says he lost his head, his judgment but he swears he will never do anything like that again. He will be the husband that she can respect and count on. He pulls out her ring out of his pocket and says please put it on so they can lead the rest of their lives. She looks at him and one single tear falls."

        "Justin: Yeah, but she doesn't love what you did.",
        "Bill: I've apologized for that over and over again! I mean, I practically begged for her forgiveness. What am I supposed to do?",

        "Bill: No, the longer we're apart, the likelier it is that we'll stay apart for good.",
        "Justin: What about forrester? I know you told him not to exploit the situation. Any idea if he's listened or is he in hot pursuit of brooke?",
        "R.J.: Hey. [ Snaps fingers ] Dad. Have you heard anything I've said?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, no, I-I -- yeah, I've heard every word.",
        "R.J.: Okay, so we agree? I move to europe with coco.",
        "Ridge: What? No, you're not doing that. What are you talking about?",
        "R.J.: For the past 10 minutes, I've been trying to sell you the idea to hire more interns to gear up for the holidays. And your mind has been somewhere else. It's mom. She's the reason why you're distracted, right? Did something new happen with you guys? Is mom making it official, divorcing spencer?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. I hope so.",
        "Brooke: This is really impressive, katie.",
        "Katie: Thanks. I mean, it's still in its preliminary stages, but i thought about show it to ridge.",
        "Brooke: You're gonna drive a lot of interest with this new campaign.",
        "Katie: I hope so.",
        "Brooke: So is that what this is about?",
        "Katie: What? What this is about? I don't know what you're talking -- [ Laughs ]",
        "Brooke: This glint in your eye and this constant glow.",
        "Katie: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Brooke: You do. You have that smile on your face, that little smile that you've had for days.",
        "Katie: I am sorry. Did I not smile before?",
        "Brooke: You know what I'm talking about. Just tell me what's going on. I'm sure it's not just about work. Is there a man in your life?",
        "Katie: [ Scoffs ]",
        "Quinn: [ Sighs ]",

        "Eric: Wait, you're still in the dark about why your mother left bill?",
        "Rick: I'm afraid so. And we know what he's capable of.",
        "Maya: [ Scoffs ] No one more than me. But I do have to say, to be fair, that hearing bill's vows to brooke on her wedding day, i mean, I've never heard a man more in love. Well, with the exception of one.",
        "Rick: [ Laughing ] Yeah, you better believe it.",
        "Maya: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Still, I have to say, if it's a question of mom staying married to spencer or getting back together with ridge, I have to say I'm torn.",
        "Katie: Okay, just because I'm happy and I happen to have a glow, as you say, doesn't mean i have a man in my life.",
        "Brooke: You're deflecting. I'm your big sis! I know you better than anybody. So tell me. Who is he, hmm?",
        "Katie: [ Sighs ] You know what? If -- if you want to talk about men, how about you go first? Where do things stand with you and bill?",
        "Justin: Okay, don't want to go out today. I have a better idea. Tomorrow night, pizza, wings, thursday night football. Eagles versus panthers, huh?",
        "Bill: I appreciate that. And it might be the only thing to get my mind off my world imploding.",
        "Justin: What are you doing?",
        "Bill: It's been hard enough losing my company. But watching brooke take this ring off her finger, the way she looked at me when she did it, I won't give up, justin. I can't give up on brooke and me.",
        "Rick: So, dad, how's quinn's back?",
        "Maya: Yeah, we heard she, uh, hurt it moving furniture.",
        "Eric: [ Chuckling ] No, she did. She was actually in a lot of pain. And she still would be probably if it weren't for mateo's magic hands.",
        "Quinn: Well, I wish I'd known you were a certified masseur a few weeks ago.",
        "Mateo: Why's that?",
        "Quinn: Oh, we had an unwelcome guest who had me tied up in knots. Could have used your expert hands to help me relax.",
        "Charlie: You know, sheila, eric is a married man these days. I mean, we're talking \"happy as a clam\" married. You're just setting yourself up for a whole heap of heartbreak.",
        "Sheila: Eric is the great love of my life. And I know I could be his, as well, if he would just truly see his wife for the amoral person she is.",
        "Charlie: Okay, toots, listen up. I know you were banking on the quinn/ridge merger, but you know what? That deal is off. And as a matter of fact, the ridgester is spending a lot more time with lady logan now that she and -- and buck and a quarter bill have split.",
        "R.J.: Dad, I'm not a kid. You can be straight with me. Is the reason why mom married bill in the first place instead of you, is that all behind you? Or is she still worried that you might disappoint her again --",
        "Ridge: I'm not gonna disappoint her again. It's not gonna happen. Your mom needs our undivided devotion.",
        "R.J.: And love.",
        "Ridge: She has that. Always will.",
        "Brooke: Short answer -- I'm not sure where things stand between me and bill.",
        "Katie: Well, I know you don't like being in limbo. I mean, you're at your house, you're separated. I know that's not where you want to be. I'm not saying that you need a man in your life to be happy.",
        "Brooke: No, I know. It's just not fair to me and to bill and to ridge. So I need to clarify things.",
        "Katie: Are you texting bill?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, it's time.",
        "Katie: Time for what? To end your marriage or to go back to him?",
        "[ Text message sends ]",
        "Bill: This ring would still be on brooke's finger if it wasn't for that blackmailing son of mine. And I swear, justin, if -- [ Cellphone whistles ] It's brooke. She's on her way over.",
        "Justin: Guess I'll be watching football alone tomorrow.",
        "Bill: My wife is coming back to me.",
        "Justin: You know, I hope so, bill. Why don't you give her some time --",
        "Bill: No, look, I gave her time. I gave her the time she needed to gain some perspective. Obviously she's done that.",
        "Justin: Okay, but that doesn't mean that... all right, may-- maybe you're right, bill. Um, maybe she's thought it through. She realizes that you're a chastened man and that you'll never do anything like what you did to sally spectra again.",
        "Bill: I gave her my word, and I won't go back on it. But if for some reason brooke decides she can't get past it and she wants to end things permanently... I will strike liam so hard. My turncoat son had better hope that brooke and I can find our way back to each other, or he will feel pain like he can't even imagine.",
        "Rick: So, mateo is a certified massage therapist?",
        "Eric: Yeah, he is.",

        "[ Chuckles ]",
        "Eric: Actually, I surprised myself a little bit with this.",
        "Maya: Really?",
        "Eric: The idea of a young man with his hands rubbing my wife's half-naked body on a massage table upstairs, in my own house. [ Chuckling ] I arranged it myself. Not that I don't trust quinn.",
        "Maya: Quinn has had other massages before.",
        "Eric: Yes, she has. I-I think it's just because i know the person who's giving her the massage. I think --",
        "Rick: You don't trust mateo.",
        "Eric: I spoke to him firmly, but, uh, subtly about how important loyalty is to me.",
        "Sheila: It's true. I was really counting on ridge and quinn to rekindle their sordid affair, but remember who we're talking about here. I can assure you someone else will get their hands on quinn.",
        "Quinn: Oh, yes, yes. Oh, no, no, no. Don't stop.",
        "Mateo: Turn over. It's getting hot in here.",
        "Quinn: You're so handsome, mateo. I can't believe you don't have a girlfriend.",
        "Mateo: I guess I just haven't met the right woman.",
        "Quinn: Your hands are like magic. So strong and soothing. I can go on like this for hours.",
        "Mateo: I don't mind.",
        "Quinn: I'm all yours. Every inch of me. Right there, mateo. Oh, right there, mateo.",
        "Katie: Uh, if I'm interrupting, I can come back.",
        "Ridge: No, you're not. It's fine. We're talking about your sister.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, uh, dad seems to think mom still has feelings for him.",
        "Ridge: Not exactly what i meant.",
        "R.J.: Have you spoken to my mom? Has she told you what she's thinking?",
        "Katie: Um, yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact, I was just with her, and I think she's made a decision.",
        "Bill: I was happy to get your text. I hope it means what I think it does.",
        "Brooke: You've been reaching out, wanting to talk.",
        "Bill: And I understand that you haven't been ready. Until now.",
        "Brooke: I know that being in limbo hasn't been fair to either one of us. So I made a decision.",
        "Quinn: Look at me. Almost no pain. Mateo is really gifted.",
        "Eric: You really are feeling better, aren't you?",
        "Quinn: Yes! No meds, no relaxants. Just a few massages.",
        "Eric: Massages from a young, very attractive man. You know, maybe I should have my head examined, allowing a hunk like mateo to be in the same room with my half-naked wife, let alone putting his hands all over your body.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no, no. My dear, sweet husband, you don't have a thing to worry about. You're the only man I want and ever will want.",
        "Eric: Is that right?",
        "Quinn: It is. It is right. But we do owe mateo a debt of gratitude. Because of him, I feel like i can walk, I can hike. I'm ready for all sorts of activities.",

        "Mateo: I gave mrs. Forrester another massage. I think she enjoyed it.",
        "Sheila: [ Chuckling ] Of course she did. She can't resist temptation. Where -- where is she now?",
        "Mateo: Upstairs with mr. Forrester.",
        "Sheila: Poor eric. The sooner I expose this vile woman, the better.",
        "Mateo: Well, it's gonna take time. It can't be rushed.",
        "Sheila: I'm well aware. But it will happen.",
        "Mateo: Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.",
        "R.J.: I'll see you guys later.",
        "Katie: [ Sighs ] I didn't mean to run R.J. Off.",
        "Ridge: You didn'T. So you talked to brooke?",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah, about her future. And then she texted bill and said that she wanted to see him.",
        "Ridge: What do you think she'll do?",
        "Katie: I have no idea what she's going to do.",
        "Bill: Before you say anything, I need you to know -- you do know that I've never loved a woman the way that i love you. It took us so long to be together, so many obstacles. But when we finally made it to that altar, I looked at you, and I thought, \"this is it. I found a person who gets me, complications and all, and loves me in spite of all of them.\" Wedding vows talk about for better or worse, marriages being tested. Well, this is our test, brooke, the biggest test we'll ever face. Because I didn't just let you down. I compromised your trust in me as your husband. And now I'm left with... I'm left with anger at myself, at liam, at the world, because i don't know how to fix it or if you even want me to. All I know is... I feel like I'm losing myself, and I need you. I made a horrible mistake. I lost my head. I lost my -- my judgment. But I swear -- I swear on my own life I will never do anything like that again. And I will be a good role model to R.J. I will be the husband that you can expect and count on. I will regain your trust. Let me put this ring back on your finger so we can get on with the rest of our lives. Come back to me. Be my wife. Be my partner. ."
