    ],
    "Recap": [
        "Maya and Rick discuss Nicole being a surrogate with her. Obviously there are other avenues but this way the baby would be part Forrester and Avant. Maya laments they both want this so now it's just a matter of how. Zende has something special planned for Nicole tonight but takes a few hints from Charlie and Pam. When they hear that he is going to make a special dinner all by himself and not at a restaurant they offer their culinary services. Katie and Bill have dinner at Liam's. Steffy says she did not have time to cook so they are having takeout of steak and tofu. Bill has brought red and white wine so all can choose. He reminds them that Liam is so busy with two executive positions and Katie chimes in too bad that Wyatt doesn't. Liam realizes she thinks Wyatt is being short changed. Meanwhile Wyatt kisses Ivy who he is trying to convince will be more comfortable and be able to rock this modeling the lingerie for Steffy. Ivy wants to go change since the pizza will soon be here. Wyatt says it is his dream so he wants her to keep the lingerie on. She says if she does, then he has to drop his pants too so he laughs and does.",
        "Maya and Nicole are still discussing the details and Nicole admits that she is getting closer and closer to Zende. He might just be the one. Maya is not sure Nicole would even want to consider having a baby right now then. Zende walks in and wonders what is going on. Bill is shocked but thinks the idea brilliant that Ivy will be the new lingerie model. He wants to be there for a front row seat at the coming out showing. Katie thinks she was coerced into it and does not sound like Ivy's thing. The pizza guy gets a huge thrill when Ivy opens the door and gives him $20 and he gets to keep the change. Looking at her he does not even need a tip. Maya hopes she has not ruined the night for Nicole with Zende, bad timing. Nicole picks at her food but finally answers Zende that all she has is because of Maya. And now Maya needs one little favor from her. He agrees that whatever it is then she would do it. Then she drops the surrogate bomb on him."

        "Maya: We want a baby that is both Avant and Forrester.",
        "Rick: Since your sister can't have a baby... we know that this is a lot to ask. I-it's a huge emotional and physical sacrifice.",
        "Maya: And there are other ways that we can do this. But... ideally, we would wish for you to have our baby. Because... I don't know -- it would feel more like mine. We all live here. And we would go through the pregnancy together. We would help you every step of the way. With your help, Nicole... we can do this.",

        "Pam: Yeah, but lose the popcorn. That's not good for hand-holding.",
        "Zende: Uh, okay, uh, but --",
        "Pam: Have we forgotten anything else?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, there's, uh, one more thing, sweetheart. At the end of the movie, you lift her chin like this, you look into her eyes, and you say, \"Here's looking at you, kid.\"",
        "Pam: Oh. [Laughing] Charlie...",
        "Zende: Thanks for the advice, guys, but we're not going to the movies. I have something special planned for tonight.",

        "Liam: Nice -- you unlocked the vault.",
        "Bill: Steak, tofu -- all bases covered.",
        "Liam: All right! Except it's, uh, quinoa tonight, not tofu.",
        "Bill: Oh, great. [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah, sorry, guys. I didn't have time to cook, so I got all this.",
        "Liam: Yeah, oh, but don't worry. I got -- I got you a steak. It's on the grill.",
        "Katie: Don't worry about it. I'm sure you're busy, you know, running Forrester.",
        "Bill: And you're helping her, as well as Katie. One son, two executive positions.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Oh, talk about having all the bases covered.",
        "Katie: Too bad the same can't be said for Wyatt.",

        "Ivy: Mmm.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. You seem more comfortable with this.",
        "Ivy: Well, that's because this isn't modeling.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, definitely not. No, mnh-mnh.",
        "Ivy: Oh, I just [Sighs] I just -- I can't believe Steffy. She knows I'm gonna be so uncomfortable modeling lingerie.",
        "Wyatt: Of course she does. That's why she gave you this job, but you're gonna be great.",
        "Ivy: No, no, I'm gonna be horrible.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, right now... you're killing it.",

        "Bill: [Laughs] Yeah. You see, my wife is of the opinion --",
        "Liam: That Wyatt is being short-changed. I know.",
        "Steffy: Liam clearly has more executive experience.",
        "Katie: Maybe Wyatt would get some experience if he had the opportunity.",
        "Bill: So, let him go find one.",
        "Katie: I think he also feels like Ivy's been treated unfairly.",

        "Ivy: You do have a way of making this sound... more palatable.",

        "Wyatt: I like that word in this context.",

        "Ivy: But still, I'm not -- Wyatt, I'm not ready to strut my stuff on some runway, not even -- not even in designer underwear.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, don't tell Steffy that.",
        "Ivy: Oh, God, but she would just love to see me mortified in front of all those people, all those cameras.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: That woman is so transparent, thinking that this is an opportunity.",

        "Zende: Nope.",
        "Pam: [Gasps] Oh, oh! I have the perfect idea! Give Nicole an evening... that she will never forget.",
        "Charlie: [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: That's the plan.",
        "Pam: And we... have the wardrobe for it.",
        "Zende: Wardrobe?",
        "Charlie: Oh, you are a genius. Are you thinking that...",

        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Zende: That's funny. You guys are kidding, right? Oh, you're not?",
        "Charlie: Um, uh, maybe this isn't the ticket for them, you know?",
        "Zende: Relax, guys. I already have the perfect plan. It's called dinner.",
        "Both: Oh.",
        "Pam: Okay. What, like, fancy restaurant?",
        "Zende: Think a little more private.",
        "Pam: Oh. Charlie... he's cooking Nicole dinner. Aww! And you, young man -- lucky young man -- happen to be in the presence of two culinary experts at your service.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I know we caught you off guard.",
        "Nicole: No, it's not that. Um... well, actually, yeah, it is.",
        "Rick: It's not your everyday request. We're not just asking you to be a surrogate. We're asking you to be an egg donor.",
        "Nicole: You're...serious about this? You are.",
        "Maya: We both want this, Nicole. We want to have a baby. It's just a question of how. You could be the answer.",

        "Pam: You are?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, starts out with, uh, fresh tomato soup.",
        "Pam: Wait, you went out and got fresh tomatoes?",
        "Charlie: Bought the cans this morning.",
        "Pam: [Sighs]",
        "Charlie: And then the coup de r\u00e9sistance -- a grilled cheese sandwich. Gruy\u00e8re, of course.",
        "Pam: [Sighs]",
        "Zende: Wait, why Gruy\u00e8re?",
        "Charlie: Little-known factoid -- you combine aged Gruy\u00e8re and fresh tomatoes, and it makes for... enhanced romantic notions.",
        "Pam: You... mean like an aphrodisiac?",
        "Charlie: Bingo. And then the coup de fromage moment. You cut it into little triangles to make it easy to sensually sop up the soup. And this really works, my friend. It does.",
        "Pam: Wait. You sopped soup with someone before me?",
        "Charlie: Yes, I did. But that's as far as it went.",
        "Zende: Right. Uh, I was actually thinking of an old Forrester recipe. Pepper steak.",
        "Pam: Oh, good choice! That's Ridge's favorite.",
        "Zende: Yeah.",
        "Pam: Would you like some lemon bars for dessert?",
        "Zende: I actually think I got it covered, Pam. Thanks, anyway.",
        "Pam: Ah.",
        "Zende: Okay, shoot, uh, I got to get cooking, uh, but... thank you, guys, for the... interesting ideas.",
        "Charlie: Ah.",
        "Zende: All right.",
        "Pam: So, um, what kind of soup did you serve her?",
        "Charlie: No, no, no, she -- she was just my little soup du jour.",
        "Pam: You never t--",
        "Charlie: Y-you're my consomm\u00e9.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, you were talking about Ivy and how you somehow fixed the problem.",
        "Steffy: I gave her a job.",
        "Bill: After you fired her?",
        "Steffy: She went over my head to my grandfather, and it -- it worked.",
        "Bill: Well, he can't force you to re-hire her.",
        "Liam: He didn't force Steffy. I mean, it's still her decision.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, sort of, but it all worked out. She said she'd do anything I asked, so I gave her a job... modeling the Bedroom line.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: All right, well, pizza is on the way, and I'm gonna go get changed.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no, no.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, come on.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no, no. Pizza and lingerie -- this is a dream of mine.",
        "Ivy: Oh. [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Don't ruin it. [Laughs]",
        "Ivy: Okay. Okay.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: Well, two people can play at this game, so if I have to walk around this house naked, that means...",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Ivy: Uh-huh.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] Okay.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Fine.",
        "Ivy: Ooh, thanks.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I thought that you wanted me to go to the grocery store, pick up some laundry when you said you had a big favor to ask, but I had no idea.",
        "Maya: It's a lot to ask. We know.",
        "Nicole: You've done so much for me. Both of you have.",
        "Rick: Nicole, listen, you don't owe us anything.",
        "Nicole: My life has changed for the better since I came to LA, and that's... largely thanks to you two. But to have a baby...",
        "Maya: You don't have to give us an answer now.",
        "Rick: So... how are you and Zende? [Chuckles nervously]",
        "Nicole: Oh, he's [Sighs] Actually cooking me dinner tonight.",
        "Maya: Mmm. When a boy makes you dinner...",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] We're getting pretty close. Well, really close.",
        "Maya: I'm happy for you.",
        "Nicole: He's the real deal, Maya. He might even be... the one.",
        "Maya: So... maybe not the time to have your sister's baby.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[Keys jingling]",
        "Zende: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Talk about dropping a bomb on someone.",
        "Rick: Think Nicole handled it well.",
        "Maya: Yeah, she'd do anything for me. But this... I don't even know if I had the right to ask.",
        "Rick: I think she would've been disappointed if you didn't.",
        "Maya: You know I would love any child we raise together. It doesn't have to have my genes.",
        "Rick: Be nice if it did.",
        "Maya: I just hope I didn't freak her out.",
        "Rick: Nicole? No. I think she was touched, maybe even a little flattered.",
        "Maya: I didn't even think about Zende, and I probably should have.",
        "Rick: Ah, he's a great kid. You know, they make a good couple.",
        "Maya: I just wonder how he'll feel about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: Then Charlie tells me to make grilled cheese dipped in tomato soup. [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: T-that sounds more like lunch.",
        "Zende: And before that, he suggested I make breakfast for dinner.",
        "Nicole: I've done that.",
        "Zende: Would you rather I do that?",
        "Nicole: Oh, no! I mean, over your famous pepper steak? Don't think so.",
        "Zende: Actually, the first time I've ever made it. Got this salad here to back me up just in case. You okay?",
        "Nicole: Yeah -- of course. I mean, you're cooking me dinner. That's a first.",
        "Zende: Really?",
        "Nicole: What, you think I let anyone cook me a meal?",
        "Zende: Well, I'm sure you've had offers, though.",
        "Nicole: I won't embarrass myself by saying I've had none, but that's pretty close to the truth.",
        "[Beeping]",
        "Zende: Pasta al dente. I hope. [Chuckles] It's really hot.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: We should try it.",
        "Nicole: Okay.",
        "Zende: [Laughs]",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You made Ivy a lingerie model?",
        "Steffy: She said she'd do anything I asked. We have a new bedroom line. We need a new model, so...",
        "Katie: That doesn't really seem like Ivy's thing, hmm?",
        "Bill: It's brilliant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Yeah, good.",
        "Wyatt: More comfortable now?",
        "Ivy: Uh, I am, actually. Are you?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I'll even take it to the next level.",
        "Ivy: You first.",
        "Wyatt: Mnh-mnh.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: In fact, I am such a good guy, I am going to help you out of yours.",
        "Ivy: Oh, thanks.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Mmm. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Mm-hmm.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, the pizza.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Go answer the door.",
        "Ivy: Wha-- in this?!",
        "Wyatt: Yeah!",
        "Ivy: Are you crazy?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, you got to get used to it.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt!",
        "Wyatt: Next week, the whole world is gonna see you, so come on.",
        "Ivy: [Sighing]",
        "Wyatt: Come on.",
        "Ivy: Fine.",
        "Wyatt: It's gonna be great!",
        "Man: You order a... oh, my lanta! Pizza?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Yeah, thanks. Uh, this is $20. You can keep the change.",
        "Man: Oh, no need for the tip, ma'am. You have it covered. Wow! Tomorrow, we're having a special with...",
        "Ivy: Uh-huh.",
        "Man: ...Clams and linguini. I can come back, same time!",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, thank you very much. Bye! Take it!",
        "Wyatt: That was awesome. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Crickets chirping]",
        "Katie: So [Sighs] I'm assuming that Ivy didn't exactly embrace this idea?",
        "Steffy: Embrace? No, no, she didn't embrace it.",
        "Liam: But she did accept it.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Well, of course, she did. I mean, it beats selling her trinkets in the park.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs]",
        "Bill: Well done, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Bill: How'd she react?",
        "Liam: So, you don't think -- you don't think we've... exhausted this issue?",
        "Bill: What's wrong with you? All right, when's the coming-out party? I mean, that is one fashion show I don't want to miss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] I mean, the look on that guy's face when you opened the door... like, we're gonna sell this lingerie faster than we can even sew them...",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: ...Let alone pizza for a year. You should've seen that guy's face! Ha! He'll be here every night!",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, I won't be. Not dressed like this, I won't.",
        "Wyatt: Well...",
        "Ivy: You're really getting a kick out of this, aren't you?!",
        "Wyatt: I'm... adm-- look, okay. You are just that much more confident, aren't you? Empowered?",
        "Ivy: Eh.",
        "Wyatt: Admit it. You're a little bit more comfortable with this whole thing. I bet you could probably go down to the convenience store and -- and pick up another six-pack or something or put gas in the car, except there's gonna be a long line of people outside the gas station if you're wearing that.",
        "Ivy: Okay, Wyatt, Wyatt, I have a feeling you should just stop speaking and start eating. Here you go. Eat that. [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: [Muffled] Mm-hmm. There it is. That's good.",
        "Ivy: Shh.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: That's nice.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: You can be very exhausting.",

        "Maya: Do you think Nicole will tell him?",
        "Rick: I don't see why she would keep it from Zende.",
        "Maya: Oh, I hope I didn't ruin their night. I-it's just the timing, you know? She walked in, and we were talking about it.",
        "Rick: Hey, hey, it's okay. They'll -- they'll talk it through.",
        "Maya: It's a big sacrifice to ask of her.",
        "Rick: Absolutely. Nicole's got a lot to consider. She's gonna need time. We need to talk more. Heck, we all have to agree. Even if not, just like we said, there are other options.",
        "Maya: I know. But imagine if we could have a child that carried both of our genes.",
        "Rick: Sure, I mean, it would be great. He or she would have your beauty and my brains.",
        "Maya: Oh, I was thinking the other way around.",
        "Rick: Okay, your beauty and your brains.",
        "Maya: [Laughs]",
        "Rick: I'll just provide the attitude.",
        "Maya: Thank you.",
        "Rick: You know, we're gonna be the coolest parents on the block.",

        "Rick: Challenges? Yes. But I am so up for it. And you...",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: ...Are gonna be an extraordinary mother.",
        "Maya: I will cherish our child no matter how it comes to us. But to have a baby that's part you and part me... it's in Nicole's hands now.",

        "[Soft music playing]",
        "Zende: Not bad.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] If you do say so yourself.",
        "Zende: What do you think?",
        "Nicole: Right.",
        "Zende: I was wondering if you were ever gonna eat.",
        "Nicole: It's good.",
        "Zende: Babe... it's me. You've been somewhere else ever since I got here. It's pretty obvious I walked in on something between you and Maya.",
        "Nicole: Oh, we were just, uh...",
        "Zende: Hey, you know you can open up to me.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] You have been so good to me. And I don't think I've ever been this happy. When I first came to LA, I was pretty unhinged. I enrolled into UCLA, tried to get into computer programming, but it wasn't me. None of it was. Until I connected with Maya again... and then met your family, and then my whole world changed. And now I have you. And all of it... because of Maya.",
        "Zende: She is pretty spectacular.",
        "Nicole: She asked something of me today.",
        "Zende: Do it. Whatever it is.",

        "Nicole: She asked for me to be the surrogate for their child.",
        "Zende: Sorry, uh... what?",
        "Nicole: Rick and Maya want to have a baby, and... she asked me to help make that happen by being their surrogate.",
        "Zende: Uh, what'd you say?",
        "Nicole: I don't know. What do you think? Should I do it?"
