        "Phoebe: She's not here. \r\n\t",
        "Stephanie: Oh, when you called \r\n\tsaid that's what this was about. ",
        "Phoebe: I know, I just -- I \r\n\tneeded to talk to someone. I'm going crazy here by myself. ",
        "Stephanie: Is she out with \r\n\tThorne? ",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, they're spending \r\n\tthe day together. ",

        "Phoebe: I'm worried. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, honey, I think \r\n\tthat's perfectly natural. If you see your mother's becoming involved with \r\n\tsomeone -- someone other than your father -- ",
        "Phoebe: No, no, no, grandma. It's \r\n\tnot about dad. I'm happy that mom and Thorne together -- planning their \r\n\tfuture. ",
        "Stephanie: Is that what your \r\n\tmother said? ",
        "Phoebe: Well, they were talking \r\n\tabout it, but she says that it's not possible if they can't be honest with \r\n\teach other that you can't love someone and continue to lie to them. \r\n\t",
        "Stephanie: Oh, God, you mean -- \r\n\tyou think she's going to tell him the truth? ",
        "Phoebe: She's telling him, \r\n\tGrandma. She's telling him right now. ",
        "",
        "Taylor: Thorne -- ",
        "Thorne: You were driving? The \r\n\twoman that I proposed to. The woman who has been supporting me and my \r\n\tdaughter. Counseling us. The woman that I have fallen -- please, please, \r\n\tTaylor, for God's sake, tell me that you're making this up. Please, tell me \r\n\tthat you're lying. ",
        "Taylor: The only lie is the lie \r\n\tI've been living. I tried -- I tried telling myself it was that right thing \r\n\tnot to tell you, Thorne, but I knew that it wasn't. God, I wanted to tell \r\n\tyou! I tried to tell you so many times! ",
        "Thorne: It was you. It was you. \r\n\tYou -- you hit Darla. You murdered my wife. ",

        "Phoebe: Mom's gonna try to \r\n\texplain to him that it was an accident. ",
        "Stephanie: It doesn't matter. \r\n\tOnce he finds out the truth, he won't hear anything else that she has to \r\n\tsay. ",
        "Hector: What's going on in here?\r\n\t",
        "Stephanie: Hector, did you know \r\n\tabout this? ",

        "Phoebe: Mom's telling Thorne \r\n\tabout Darla. ",
        "Hector: What? And you didn't stop \r\n\ther? ",
        "Stephanie: I didn't know about it \r\n\tuntil just a few moments ago. ",
        "Hector: Damn it! I knew -- I knew \r\n\tthis was gonna happen. She can't handle the guilt, Stephanie. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, please, the guilt. \r\n\tThe mistake was that -- that she agreed to this lie in the first place.\r\n\t",
        "Phoebe: Would you just stop \r\n\targuing? It's not gonna make a difference, she's telling him right now.\r\n\t",
        "Hector: Well, if that's true, \r\n\tthen their relationship is over. ",
        "Stephanie: No, it isn't. What we \r\n\thave to figure out is how we keep the police out of this. Where are they?\r\n\t",
        "Phoebe: Mom wants to do this on \r\n\ther own. ",
        "Stephanie: Phoebe, you didn't \r\n\tcall me up and ask me to come over here because you thought I wasn't going \r\n\tto do something about this. Now, where are they? ",
        "",
        "Thorne: You helped me tell \r\n\tAlexandria that her mother was dead. You lied to her. That little girl \r\n\twanted to know what happened to her mother. Who did this to our family. It \r\n\twas you! You did it Taylor! You killed the woman that I love -- the mother \r\n\tof my child! ",
        "Taylor: You wanted to confront \r\n\tthe person responsible, here I am. Here I am. Thorne, please, I need you to \r\n\tunderstand how this happened. Please, listen to me. I told you it was dark \r\n\tand it was foggy. I couldn't see. I was driving down the PCH. I was \r\n\tsearching for her car. And I had been drinking. All I could think of was \r\n\tthat my baby was in trouble and I just had to get there. I needed to help \r\n\ther. Maybe I could've swerved. Maybe if my reaction time wouldn't have been \r\n\tslow, maybe I could've swerved when Darla fell. ",
        "Thorne: When Darla fell? \r\n\t",
        "Taylor: Yes. ",
        "Thorne: When Darla fell? \r\n\t",
        "Taylor: Yes, that's what \r\n\thappened. ",
        "Thorne: You tried to blame this \r\n\ton Darla? ",
        "",
        "Stephanie: Please tell me where \r\n\tthey are. If I can talk to Thorne face to face, maybe I can do something.\r\n\t",
        "Phoebe: Mom wants to handle it on \r\n\ther own, okay? ",
        "Stephanie: Why -- why now after \r\n\tall the months of lying? ",
        "Phoebe: We all have. She's just \r\n\tthe only one brave enough to admit it. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, she's decided to \r\n\tbe brave? Well, that's good. I hope she's gonna be brave when she goes to \r\n\tprison. ",
        "Phoebe: Are you trying to scare \r\n\tme or something? ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I am because I \r\n\twant you to understand the gravity of this situation. ",

        "Stephanie: Then tell me where \r\n\tthey are. Phoebe! ",
        "Phoebe: Big Bear. ",
        "Stephanie: Thank you. Stay here \r\n\twith Hector. I'll try and do something about this. ",
        "[Door bell rings] Lieutenant?\r\n\t",
        "Lt. Baker: Mrs. Forrester. \r\n\t",
        "Stephanie: I'm sorry, forgive me, \r\n\tI'm just on my way out. ",
        "Lt. Baker: Well, don't let me \r\n\tstop you. I'm just here to see Taylor. Phoebe and Hector. ",
        "Phoebe: My mother's not here.\r\n\t",
        "Stephanie: Perhaps you could come \r\n\tback later. ",
        "Hector: Lieutenant, we've had \r\n\tenough of your questions. ",
        "Lt. Baker: I don't have any \r\n\tquestions, Hector. And I don't have anymore patience for the games you \r\n\tpeople have been playing. Your mother was driving the car that hit Darla \r\n\tForrester. That's the truth and we all know it. Now you people fess up right \r\n\tnow or when I get my proof, and I will, your mother's going down for a very \r\n\tlong time. ",
        "",
        "Thorne: You're telling me that \r\n\tthis was Darla's fault? That she fell into the car? That this was an \r\n\taccident? ",
        "Taylor: It was. But I -- I had \r\n\tbeen drinking and driving. It's my fault. It's my fault. ",
        "Thorne: You killed her, Taylor!\r\n\t",
        "Taylor: And I didn't own up to \r\n\tit. It's unforgivable. I keep seeing Darla's face in my windshield. I just \r\n\t-- I just see her eyes looking at me in utter shock and confusion and all \r\n\tshe was trying to do was help my daughter. For that -- for that to happen to \r\n\ther -- ",
        "Thorne: Happen? Happen? Oh, this \r\n\tdidn't just happen, Taylor. You're responsible. ",
        "Taylor: I'm sorry. ",
        "Thorne: Sorry? I wanted to marry \r\n\tyou. Raise my daughter with -- with the woman who killed her mother? How \r\n\tcould you let me love you? How, Taylor? How could you let me plan a future \r\n\twith you? I can't even stand to look at you. ",
        "Taylor: You hate me -- I hate \r\n\tmyself. But at least you know the truth. And it's time for everybody to \r\n\tknow, I -- I'm turning myself in. I've been so lost and you were the only \r\n\tperson that reached out to me. And you helped me. You took me to AA and you \r\n\tlet me be a part of your life. And you loved me. I love you, Thorne. I do. \r\n\tAnd I love Ally. I love both of you. When Ally asks why I don't come around \r\n\tanymore, will you please tell her that I miss her, please? Because I will. \r\n\tI'll miss you -- I'll miss you both. May I speak to lt. Baker, please? This \r\n\tis Taylor Hayes calling. Yeah, he'll know why. Oh, he's not there? Okay, \r\n\tthen, please just patch me through to his cell. It's urgent. Please, I have \r\n\tto speak with him right now. ",
        "",
        "Lt. Baker: I may not have enough \r\n\tevidence to close this case, but I do know who did it. ",
        "Hector: It's theory, Lieutenant. \r\n\tIt's not enough to arrest her. ",
        "Stephanie: You've just got to \r\n\tstop these baseless accusations, please? ",
        "Lt. Baker: No, I'm tired of \r\n\twasting my time and the taxpayer\u2019s money doing this dance with you people.\r\n\t",
        "Phoebe: You're giving up? \r\n\t",
        "Lt. Baker: No, I'm giving notice. \r\n\tYou had a chance to level with me. If your mother had come forward earlier, \r\n\tI might have let her plead out. Or asked the D.A. to make a sentencing \r\n\trecommendation. I could have made this a whole situation a whole lot simpler \r\n\t-- a whole lot less difficult. You could've done the same for me, but you \r\n\tdidn't. So I say it again -- when I get proof that Taylor was driving the \r\n\tcar that hit Darla, I'm gonna have her prosecuted to the fullest extent of \r\n\tthe law. Baker. A call from who? Yeah. All right, go ahead. Put her through.\r\n\t",
        "Taylor: Lt. Baker. This is Taylor \r\n\tHayes. ",
        "Lt. Baker: Yes, ma'am. What can I \r\n\tdo for you? ",
        "Taylor: I have to talk to you. I \r\n\tthink you know what it's about. ",
        "Lt. Baker: Go ahead. ",
        "Taylor: I'm the one responsible \r\n\tfor Darla Forrester's death. ",
        "Lt. Baker: That's very \r\n\tinteresting, Dr. Hayes. Would you care to say that again for the record?\r\n\t",
        "Taylor: This is Taylor Hayes and \r\n\tI'm making an official statement that I was driving the car that hit Darla \r\n\tForrester. I killed her. ",
        "Lt. Baker: Thank you, Dr. Hayes. \r\n\tWould you tell me where you are right now please? Stay there. I'm coming to \r\n\tbring you in. ",
        "Taylor: I'm not going anywhere.\r\n\t",
        "Lt. Baker: Orbach, this is Baker, \r\n\tI need you to call Big Bear PD. I want them to arrest Dr. Taylor Hayes. \r\n\tGross, vehicular manslaughter. Obstruction of justice. Driving under the \r\n\tinfluence. Leaving the scene of a crime. ",
