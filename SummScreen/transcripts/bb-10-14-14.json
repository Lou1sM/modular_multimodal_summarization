        "Caroline rushes away from Ridge. He follows and she says she needed a moment. He says he is flattered that she is flustered every time she is around him and he will let it go. She asks him to stop looking at her like that with those eyes. It is getting hot in here. She is not going to risk her marriage to Rick by being a team with Ridge. She just can't. Ridge is mentoring her and giving her all this attention but she has a husband that she loves. She needs to be happy with what she has. So maybe they are confusing their passion for work for passion with each other. He needs to keep his hands to himself and she will keep her lips to herself. That is just the way it has to be. Aly seeks out Hope and says she has not had much time to talk to her. She thought for sure she would go back to Liam once she knew the truth. She says she and Ivy have become close and if Hope isn't going to be with Liam then she'd like Ivy to be. So Hope needs to stake her claim now if she intends to. She still has time to change her mind. Hope says no, there is no chance. She is not going to change her mind. She confirms that she is pregnant. She had a feeling all day so just went ahead and took the test. Aly understands now. Hope was going back to Liam but knowing she was pregnant changed everything. Ivy and Liam have lunch at the commons on the rooftop. He says he is enjoying getting out of his office and being with her, but no way is he going to take off his shirt and pump iron. He asks if her father is still here or gone back to Australia. She says he has, probably having lunch with the Prime Minister. He tells her that he had a really good time at her party that night, the best one he has had in a really long time. She confides in him that Caroline should be happy while collaborating with Ridge but she seems a little frazzled. Liam asks if she has seen Wyatt lately. He is sure that he will be making the big announcement about the baby soon. He probably will even have a gigantic press conference and say look what the diamond did. Liam says he has a plan and she needs to come to his house tonight and he will explain it all to her. He's mysterious but she says ok. Hope tells Aly that she is in love with Wyatt, there is no going back to Liam. Aly says she understands but she knows she was right that Hope intended to go back to Liam. Hope says she is married to Wyatt and she is expecting his child. She is sorry that this hurts Aly, but tells her to quit saying she is in love with Liam as it makes her sad, so do not bring it up again.",
        "Caroline tells Ridge that he will be okay soon and not need her at all. She is just going to pretend none of this is happening. He says the possibilities are endless. She gets it, he wants to be CEO and will do anything to get her to side with him so he can be top dog. She says she is not stupid. Ridge says everybody is replaceable. Rick does not have the passion to run the company and he doesn't even know how to satisfy her. She can do better. He says he does want to be CEO and he wants to run the company with her. She says he is trying to take advantage of her. How dare he. He kisses her passionately and says he does not lie. She grabs him and kisses him passionately but then runs out. Aly catches up with Ivy and says she has been talking to Hope. All makes sense now as Hope is pregnant with Wyatt's child. Hope runs into Liam before he leaves. She tells him that Aly was just here and she knows now. She also states that he was spending a lot of time with Ivy so she assumes they are dating. He stammers and she says she just wants him to be happy. She asks what happened to them. They almost made it. She leans her head on his shoulders and then gives him a hug."

        "Ridge: Hey. What are you doing? Why are you running out of there like that?",
        "Caroline: I-I needed a moment.",
        "Ridge: You got something on your mind?",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I mean, you could say that.",
        "Ridge: So, what are you thinking about? You thinking about us?",
        "Caroline: There is no us, okay? I am married -- very happily married.",
        "Ridge: Okay, shh. Then why are you so flustered every time you're around me? Don't fight it. We're a team. It's what we are. I'm not gonna let that go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: Hey. Hope, you -- you got a minute?",
        "Hope: Yeah, yeah, sure.",
        "Aly: I haven't really had the chance to talk to you lately.",
        "Hope: I know. I've, uh, had a lot going on.",
        "Aly: Yeah, about that -- look, I know you're married and everything, but I thought once you found out that you were manipulated by Wyatt's mother that you'd go back to Liam, and I'm just a little surprised that you didn't.",
        "Hope: Um... I couldn't do that.",
        "Aly: Hope, Ivy and I have become really close. I mean, she's great. And if Liam can't be with you, then I'd like to see him with her. And I know it's none of my business, but if there is even the slightest chance, you better do something and do it now before Liam falls in love with Ivy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Laughs] No, no. I'm sorry. There's no chance.",
        "Ivy: Why not?",
        "Liam: Because I'm not taking my shirt off and pumping iron.",
        "Ivy: Hey, no. I didn't say anything about taking your shirt off. Although now that you mention it...",
        "Liam: Yeah, no, I think I'm gonna sit this one out. Thank you. Thank you. [Sighs] Honestly, I'm just really happy to get away from the office for a minute, hang out with you.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, this is a nice place to come to get some fresh air, stay away from the drama. Have I mentioned to you that there is a lot of that around here?",
        "Liam: It's Forrester creations. Man, it's part of the charm.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, it takes a little getting used to.",
        "Liam: Is your, uh -- is your dad still in town? I really enjoyed meeting him.",
        "Ivy: Mnh-mnh. He went back to Australia.",
        "Liam: Ah. Lunch with the prime minister?",
        "Ivy: Actually, I think he's snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that makes sense. [Chuckles] I had a good talk with him.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, he, uh -- he said that. It's nice to hear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] Is the air-conditioning not working in here? It's hot.",
        "Ridge: It feels good to me.",
        "Caroline: Will you quit looking at me like that?!",
        "Ridge: Like what?",
        "Caroline: With those eyes. It just -- [Sighs] It's confusing.",
        "Ridge: We're building something extraordinary, something very special, and to give up on it -- that's not an option.",
        "Caroline: It is the only option.",
        "Ridge: What we have here, whatever this is, comes along once in a lifetime.",
        "Caroline: No. I can't, okay? I am not going to risk my marriage to Rick to be a team with you. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: So, did I mention your dad dosed off on me, mid-conversation? Fell asleep, like, snoring -- totally dead to the world.",
        "Ivy: Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.",
        "Liam: No. It wasn't -- I-I may have been talking his ear off.",
        "Ivy: Mm, he was probably jet lagged, as well.",
        "Liam: Or...Eric's martinis.",
        "Ivy: You know what? They can take some of the blame.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: I had a really good time that night. I think I -- I think I came away from that party feeling better than I have in a really long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: I just don't want you missing the chance to get your life back with Liam.",
        "Hope: That's not going to happen.",
        "Aly: Hope, Ivy's developing real feelings for him. I mean, I know it's early and everything, but I think he's interested in her, too.",
        "Hope: Okay. I'm sorry. I don't know why you're telling me this.",
        "Aly: Because there's still time for you to change your mind.",
        "Hope: No. No, there's not.",
        "Aly: Why not? Hope, why are you with Wyatt when you are in love with Liam? It doesn't make any sense. Hope... is this yours?",
        "Hope: Yep. I'm pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Liam: I'm concerned. My cousin Caroline hasn't posted a photo in over an hour.",
        "Ivy: Oh. [Chuckles] Well, that shouldn't be too much of a surprise. She's been pretty busy designing.",
        "Liam: Yeah, isn't that a good thing?",
        "Ivy: Well, yeah, you'd think so, but I saw her earlier, and she seemed kind of frazzled.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I mean, well, Caroline's always been kind of...",
        "Ivy: [Laughs] Yeah. Yeah, well, she's been collaborating with Ridge, so...",
        "Liam: Ah! Well, there you go. Uh, have you -- have you spent much time with Ridge? He's, like, super-intense, hyper into his work. I'm sure that's why she's stressed out.",
        "Ivy: Huh. You know, I didn't realize there was so much animosity between the brothers.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah. Like, huge rivalry there. They're about as close as Wyatt and me. [Chuckles] Speaking of which, have you seen Wyatt around here lately?",
        "Ivy: Nope. I haven't, not recently.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] I am bracing myself for the big announcement. I know any minute now the whole world's gonna know Hope is pregnant with his baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: So, does Liam know you're pregnant?",
        "Hope: Yeah. He was one of the first people I told.",
        "Aly: Wow. So, he's known for a while... even at the dinner party. He didn't let on.",
        "Hope: Well, I don't know why he would. He's not gonna go around telling people. He knows that's my job.",
        "Aly: So, when did you find out?",
        "Hope: Um...right after I found out about Quinn pushing Ivy into the seine.",
        "Aly: Wait, you -- you took a pregnancy test that same day?",
        "Hope: Yeah. I, I, you know, had a feeling all day, so I just wanted to be sure.",
        "Aly: Wow. This is all starting to make sense now -- why you're still with Wyatt.",
        "Hope: What are you talking about?",
        "Aly: You're only with him because of the baby.",
        "Hope: That's not true.",
        "Aly: You were gonna go back to Liam, and then you found out that you were pregnant, and that changed everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Look, I enjoy working with you, Ridge. It's...incredibly inspiring. It's an absolute dream come true, but it has to end.",
        "Ridge: Well, it can't. You can't quit halfway through a race.",
        "Caroline: See, I'm afraid to even be on this road. I don't know where it's going.",
        "Ridge: It's going all the way to the top.",
        "Caroline: Would you quit doing that? Would you quit pretending like this is all business? We kissed. Each other. Okay? That is so not okay. I am -- I am incredibly disappointed in myself. You know what? Maybe this is just a phase -- a passing.",
        "Ridge: A passing, what?",
        "Caroline: I-I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.",
        "Ridge: Then stop over-thinking it.",
        "Caroline: I-I can't. You know, you're mentoring me, and...giving me all this attention.",
        "Ridge: Well, maybe Rick should give you more attention.",
        "Caroline: No. He is wonderful to me. I have a husband that I love. And I'm having these feelings that I should not be having, and I just need to be happy with what I have.",
        "Ridge: Why?",
        "Caroline: Rick is a wonderful man. He's gonna be C.E.O. of Forrester one day, and you -- you are engaged to Katie. So maybe we're just confusing our passion for work for passion for each other.",
        "Ridge: Is that what we're doing?",
        "Caroline: Wh-why are you asking me so many questions? Ridge, we need to stop talking this way, and we need to not feel this way. You -- you need to keep your hands to yourself. And I need to keep my lips to myself, and that is just how it has to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You know, I haven't read any rumors about Hope being pregnant yet.",
        "Liam: I think only a few people know.",
        "Ivy: Well, they've done a very good job of keeping that a secret.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Wyatt's probably planning some giant publicity stunt to break the news. \"Look what the Hope for the Future diamond's done now! It created a human!\"",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] You know what? I'm glad that you can joke about this, because there is absolutely nothing funny about what you're going through right now.",
        "Liam: What's the other option? Just miserable all the time? I got to move on, you know? I got to live. I got to have some fun. In fact, I do have a plan.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Do you? That's good.",
        "Liam: Mm. And you're included.",
        "Ivy: I am?",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Ivy: When?",
        "Liam: Tonight.",
        "Ivy: Ooh, what have you got in mind?",
        "Liam: I'll...explain it to you when you show up at my house.",
        "Ivy: Is that my only clue?",
        "Liam: There's food involved.",
        "Ivy: Ooh. Interesting.",
        "Liam: Interesting?",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "Liam: So, are you in?",
        "Ivy: Well, gee, I don't know. I'm gonna have to check my calendar.",
        "Liam: Oh, come on!",
        "Ivy: [Laughs] Would you look at that? I'm free. I'm totally free.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Ivy: All right. Well, I guess I'll be seeing you at your place tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: You want to be with Liam.",
        "Hope: [Scoffs] I'm in love with Wyatt.",
        "Aly: [Chuckles] Hope, I am not saying that you're not in love with Wyatt. I know you are. And this baby is such a precious gift, but what you and Liam share --",
        "Hope: Is in the past.",
        "Aly: Look, Hope, I just -- I want you to know that I understand. I know why you had to change your mind -- because of the pregnancy.",
        "Hope: I never said that.",
        "Aly: But I'm right. Aren't I? Does Liam know that you were planning to go back to him?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Look, Aly, I am carrying Wyatt's child. We are going to be parents, and I'm really sorry that you're disappointed that it didn't work out for Liam and me, but it's time that we look past that, okay?",
        "Aly: Look, I don't care about me, and I'm not trying to attack you. I just -- I feel awful for you and Liam. You were cheated out of a life together.",
        "Hope: But now I have a life with Wyatt. Please stop telling me that I'm in love with Liam. Stop telling me that he's the one I want to be with, because now you have me thinking about him, and I don't understand why you're bringing it up. All it does is make me sad. So let's not talk about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: And what would I do without you? You're my right hand.",
        "Caroline: I've seen you trying to draw. It's slowly coming back to you.",
        "Ridge: It's not there yet.",
        "Caroline: Yes, but it will be soon, and then you won't need me at all.",
        "Ridge: But I do need you.",
        "Caroline: What about Katie? She's your fianc\u00e9e. You go home to her every night. And need I say it again, I am married to Rick.",
        "Ridge: You married the wrong man. I'm sorry.",
        "Caroline: You know, I'm just gonna pretend that you didn't say that.",
        "Ridge: He's not on your level and never will be.",
        "Caroline: Ear muffs.",
        "Ridge: You like what's going on here or you wouldn't be jumping out of your skin. The possibilities are endless. Be my partner and run this company with me.",
        "Caroline: There. You said it again. It's always about the company, about making sure that you get C.E.O. You're using me, aren't you? You want me to side with you over my own husband so that you can be top dog around here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Uh, no. It's fine. I'm sure Aly's in here. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I know when I'm being used, Ridge. I'm not stupid.",
        "Ridge: No, you're not stupid. You're right. I'm doing all this because I want something from you, and you don't feel anything.",
        "Caroline: Rick and I --",
        "Ridge: It's not about Rick. It's not about him or his place in this company. Everyone's replaceable.",
        "Caroline: See, no. You're wrong. He has contributed so much to Forrester. He's great at what he does.",
        "Ridge: He doesn't know what it takes to run this company. He doesn't know the passion it takes. And he doesn't know how to fulfill you. He doesn't. Not his fault, he just can't. And you can do better.",
        "Caroline: With who? You? You're only saying this stuff to me because you want me to tell Eric that we are the future of Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Yes. I want to be C.E.O., and I want to run this company with you.",
        "Caroline: See, and that's what I'm afraid of. Because I want that, too. And you know that. And that's why you're trying to take advantage of me. God, you know what? Talk about cold and unfeeling and -- and calculating. I mean, how dare you? How dare you just sit here and lie to --",
        "Ridge: I don't lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: [Clears throat]",
        "Ivy: Hey. Where have you been?",
        "Aly: Talking to Hope. It all makes sense now.",
        "Ivy: What does?",
        "Aly: Why she's still with Wyatt. She's, um, pregnant with his child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Uh, Aly was just here.",
        "Liam: Yeah, she wanted an early coffee. [Clears throat]",
        "Hope: Yeah, okay. She knows. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: That you're...",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Uh, she also said that you've been spending a lot of time with Ivy. I hear you met her father.",
        "Liam: I did. Yeah.",
        "Hope: So, are you two, like... are you dating?",
        "Liam: I don't know what to say. I don't -- I wish things were different.",
        "Hope: I just want you to be happy. You know, it's not easy for me either.",
        "Liam: Oh, no. I know that. I know.",
        "Hope: Well, we almost made it.",
        "Liam: Hey. [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: Almost got our life back. God! What happened to us?"
