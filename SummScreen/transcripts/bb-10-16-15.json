    "Recap": [
        "Maya tells Rick that if he has any reservations he needs to say so now. All three of them need to be on the same page. At the end there will be no going back. But Nicole has not agreed to anything yet so they do not need to set themselves up for disappointment. Zende kisses Nicole and says he wants to be honest with her. She says she is not good at guessing so please speak his mind. He has an opinion and this will affect him as well. This will be a decision that can change all of their lives, it is a huge sacrifice. She says Maya has changed her life so she does not know how she can even say no. Zende reminds her that he is adopted so there are other options. But she has to do what she feels is right. They have a great future between them and he just hopes that she will make them the priority. Ridge tries to answer Steffy's accusations of why he sent Thomas to Paris. She is President yet he did not give her a heads-up and she is not buying this excuse from him. He is holding something back. What they are telling him makes no sense. Thomas's apology was not enough so he is now banished to another continent. Ridge tells her she is too protective of her brother. She reminds him that Thomas is more than staff, he is family. Ridge ends by saying the subject is closed; Thomas is staying in Paris. Caroline tells her to accept Ridge's decision.",
        "Ridge tells Caroline that Steffy can be relentless. Just then Thomas calls and he lets his dad know that he made it to Paris safely. He wants to apologize again but Ridge says he can not talk and hangs up. He tells Caroline this is their baby and their secret and no one, especially Thomas, can know. She assures him that she wants a baby with him and she will do all she can do to keep it that way. Nicole tells Maya that she needs to talk to her alone. She knows she is waiting on an answer and this is the biggest decision she has ever made. She does not want to let Maya down but Zende is part of this too. They feel the same about each other so this will be a ride together. Maya says she does not want her to sacrifice her life for them. Nicole says Maya inspires her and she knows they will be great parents and yet that is the one thing Maya can not do. Maya says there is no pressure intended, she just had to ask. Nicole says everything she has she owes to Maya. The bigger sacrifice would be missing out on this opportunity that no one else could give her so she would be honored to be her surrogate. Nothing is more important than doing this for her, even if it involves Zende. She wants to do this. Not just as an egg donor but to carry the baby. They hug."

        "Steffy: What did I just walk in on? It looks like you're about to explode. Does this have something to do with Thomas?",
        "Ridge: Why would you assume that?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. Because maybe he got shipped back to Paris. And I have no idea why. What's going on between my father and my brother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I don't want to jump too far ahead. But the thought of being able to have a child together, it's incredible.",
        "Rick: We need Nicole. And there's no guarantee. And if she says no, I mean, we can't make her feel guilty, even a little bit.",
        "Maya: Agreed. We have to control our reactions and never forget how much we're asking of my sister.",
        "Rick: Yeah, we're asking a year of a life that's just starting.",
        "Maya: The emotional, physical realities of carrying someone else's child. I'm really glad that we talked to that doctor because now that we have solid information, I feel more comfortable asking Nicole to... carry our child, Rick. [Chuckles] Yours and mine.",
        "Rick: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I like what you said earlier, about wanting me all to yourself.",
        "Zende: What man in his right mind would want to share you? Besides, we're brand-new.",
        "Nicole: Hmm. I've known you for a while now.",
        "Zende: Yeah, but we just started kissing like that.",
        "Nicole: Like what?",
        "Zende: Forgot already?",
        "Nicole: Bad memory. Sorry.",
        "Zende: Okay. Guess I will have to remind you, then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: If you have any reservations going forward, you got to speak up. All three of us have to be 100% committed.",
        "Rick: Have a baby with you?",
        "Maya: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Oh, you can count me all the way in.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Rick: You know, when my mother first found out that you were a trans-woman, her biggest concern was that we weren't able to have children together.",
        "Maya: Well, with my sister's help, we're pretty darn close. And we couldn't ask for a more perfect surrogate.",
        "Rick: Here's to hoping that Nicole feels the same way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: I know this is a big decision, and I'm probably sounding selfish.",
        "Nicole: Yeah. But it's about me, so it's okay.",
        "Zende: I just want to be honest with you.",
        "Nicole: I need that. There's nothing worse than having to guess where someone's coming from, and I'm not good at it.",
        "Zende: Neither am I. So, that's a ground rule, all right? Honesty first.",
        "Nicole: Cosign.",
        "Zende: Look, I don't -- I don't want it to seem like I'm bossing you around. You carrying Maya and Rick's baby is totally your decision, no one else's.",
        "Nicole: You get to have an opinion, too, because it affects you, as well.",
        "Zende: I just know how much you love Maya and what it would mean for you to give her a baby that she can't have.",
        "Nicole: It would be the greatest gift ever. It would change her life, after the way she's changed mine.",
        "Zende: But taking you right out of yours now. You have to look at it from your perspective, too, not just Maya's. This is a huge sacrifice. I get it. Time goes fast. But a year is a year. There's no way you carrying Rick and Maya's baby wouldn't affect our relationship.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Nothing's going on. I just needed Thomas in Paris. That's all.",
        "Steffy: For what?",
        "Caroline: California Freedom had great momentum coming out, and now we just have to keep it up, so having Thomas in Paris is an excellent way to jump on European trends.",
        "Steffy: Oh. And you two decided this?",
        "Ridge: I decided that.",
        "Steffy: I'm president of this company. You didn't think either one of those things warranted a heads up?",
        "Ridge: I should have said something. I didn't. It's done now. I'm sorry.",
        "Steffy: I still don't understand why.",
        "Ridge: I just told you why.",
        "Steffy: Well, I'm not buying it. I know you. And I know you're holding something back. So just tell me. What is going on between you and Thomas?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I'm glad that you set that up with the doctor.",
        "Maya: It seems like it might be intense for Nicole -- the tests, evaluations, paperwork, schedules, exams, not to mention the fact that fertilization might not take right away.",
        "Rick: She has to know everything going into it so she can make a fully informed decision, because eventually in the process, there's no going back.",
        "Maya: I want the absolute best for Nicole -- the best doctors, medical facilities.",
        "Rick: That goes without saying. We'll make that happen. After all, that's our baby in there.",
        "Maya: I am so excited if this works out.",
        "Rick: Yeah, me too. But let's not set ourselves up for disappointment. Nicole hasn't agreed to anything yet.",
        "Maya: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I hear you. It's... if I get pregnant with Rick and Maya's baby, it'll definitely cramp our style.",
        "Zende: For a long time.",
        "Nicole: But how do I say no?",
        "Zende: Just like that. You say, \"I'd like to help, guys. I'm sorry, but it's too much.\"",
        "Nicole: But my sister will never be able to have a baby with her DNA if I don't step up.",
        "Zende: I love that about you, how you're so eager to help. You know, most women wouldn't even consider it.",
        "Nicole: Maya's changed my life. And maybe I'm meant to return the favor.",
        "Zende: Not this way. And if you decide that you don't want to carry or even donate your eggs, Maya and Rick can still adopt. And they can still have a strong family foundation. I know this.",
        "Nicole: And I'm sure they would. But if there's a possibility of Maya having a child with her own genes...",
        "Zende: Your life will stop.",
        "Nicole: And we will, too? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Zende: It won't be the same. How could it be?",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Zende: It's Carter. He needs to see me. Listen, you have to do what feels right. They're not pressuring you. Neither am I. We have a great future ahead of us, Nicole. Do anything we want, go anywhere we want, make amazing memories. I just hope you make us the priority.",

        "Steffy: I'm not backing off until you tell me why Thomas got shipped back to Paris.",
        "Ridge: I just told you.",
        "Steffy: What you and Caroline said made absolutely no sense.",
        "Caroline: Why? Why doesn't it make any sense that we need eyes in Europe?",
        "Steffy: We have eyes. Thorne is in Paris. Hope is in Italy. I thought you and Thomas were partners.",
        "Ridge: This is the partnership right here.",
        "Steffy: Okay. So you're really that mad that Thomas punched you?",
        "Ridge: He was out of line.",
        "Steffy: And he apologized.",
        "Ridge: Apologizing sometimes is just not enough.",
        "Steffy: That's why you sent him away?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Did I enjoy my son punching me? No, I did not. But he's in Paris because that is where I need him right now.",
        "Steffy: How can he work on California Freedom and be part of the design team if you two are here and he's on another continent? It's not fair to him. You know what? I think this is rejection, and he doesn't deserve that.",
        "Ridge: You're always so protective of your brother.",
        "Steffy: He's proven his loyalty.",
        "Ridge: Yes, he has. He's proven how loyal he is.",
        "Steffy: Wait. Why are you taking Thomas out of the mix? I thought you were so invested in his success.",
        "Caroline: He can still be successful. This is an international design house, and sometimes staff is just needed elsewhere.",
        "Steffy: He's not staff! He's family! And he's good at his job! He's learning from you! He is taking what you're giving!",
        "Ridge: Yeah, taking and giving. That's the point, isn't it? Sometimes the son takes things and then the father takes something.",
        "Steffy: Okay, I don't even -- I don't get it. I don't get it.",
        "Ridge: You don't get it?",
        "Steffy: No.",
        "Ridge: It means he's staying in Paris.",
        "Steffy: Dad, I really wish you'd reconsider.",
        "Ridge: I won't. Subject closed. This here -- this campaign's not gonna work. I think we, uh, moved too fast on this. We got to try and find another angle. Let you know when we have one.",
        "Steffy: Why does it feel like you've banished my brother?",
        "Ridge: It's not about feelings. It's about business. He needs to be in Paris right now.",
        "Steffy: Okay, if you have a problem with Thomas, then use me. I can buffer.",
        "Caroline: Just let it go, Steffy. Ridge made his decision.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: The last thing that I want to do is pressure my sister or make her feel like she has to fulfill my needs.",
        "Rick: I don't want that, either.",
        "Maya: I'm asking so much. Maybe it's too much, Rick.",
        "Rick: You have to ask in order to get.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] That is a Forrester mind-set.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Maya: It is. It is! We were taught to be grateful and not greedy. We already have pretty much everything.",
        "Rick: This is definitely the best time in my life.",
        "Maya: The only thing that would make it better is a baby. And we could adopt, and it would be wonderful.",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Maya: But, oh, Rick, if we could have a child that has both of our genes... but Nicole would be the one making the sacrifice.",
        "Rick: And the call.",
        "Maya: Yeah. And the call.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Nicole: Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Maya: Don't tell me you're still apologizing for walking in your own home.",
        "Rick: You don't still feel like a guest here? Because if that's the case, I have failed you miserably.",
        "Nicole: I don't. Got a minute?",
        "Maya: Of course.",
        "Rick: I'm gonna -- just gonna get out of your guys' hair. [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: Do you want something to drink?",
        "Nicole: No, no, I-I'm good. I know that you've been waiting to hear from me, and I asked for some time.",
        "Maya: No pressure. I want you to take all the time you need. This is an enormous decision.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] Biggest I've ever made.",
        "Maya: \"Made\"? Are you saying you have an answer about being our surrogate?",
        "Nicole: Yes. I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: You have to breathe sometimes. You know that? Got to breathe or else you're gonna implode.",
        "Ridge: Steffy can be relentless, can't she?",
        "Caroline: She is your daughter. But you're good so far. Thomas hitting you is more than a valid enough reason.",
        "Ridge: That's only gonna hold water for so long.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Hey. How's it going, Dad?",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Thomas: I, uh, I sort of expected to hear from you by now.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I was getting to that.",
        "Thomas: Okay, um, well, I wanted you to know I got to Paris safe. And, look, Dad, I don't understand why I'm here.",
        "Ridge: You're where you need to be.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, you -- you keep saying that, but if this is about the punch, I'm -- I'm sorry about that.",
        "Ridge: Can't talk.",
        "Caroline: What'd he want?",
        "Ridge: He wanted answers. Why he's in Paris, why I'm angry with him. But he can't have them. No one can. Hey. This is our secret. This is our baby. And no one, especially Thomas, can ever know the truth.",
        "Caroline: It is the truth. It's our truth. It's our baby.",
        "Ridge: It's gonna be hard, you know. You might be tempted to tell somebody.",
        "Caroline: No. I want a family with you. And I'll do anything. We're in this together, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I have a lot to say. First, I love you so much, Maya. And I never want to let you down or disappoint you. But I have to think about my life, too.",
        "Maya: I understand.",
        "Nicole: And Zende -- he's a big part of it. And I really like him.",
        "Maya: I know you do.",
        "Nicole: And he feels the same about me. And we both want to take this ride and see where it goes, and if I'm pregnant...",
        "Maya: I don't want you to sacrifice your happiness for me.",
        "Nicole: And I'm not sure. Maybe that's what I'd be doing, and I had to face that, accept it. Which led me to the only decision that I can make. You are so awesome. What you've been through... I admire you so much. Your strength and your courage. You inspire me. And now you're married to Rick, and you're gonna have this kick-ass life together.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: And you'd be great parents. Except...that's the one thing you can't do.",
        "Maya: Hey. You are the best little sister ever. And I love you so much. And you deserve the most glorious life, full of love and adventure and fun, and I want all of that for you. And I don't want to be the reason that you don't have that. Okay? So I meant what I said. There is no pressure intended. I had to ask. But if this is too much of a sacrifice for you, Nicole, I get it.",
        "Nicole: I know. And you've told me that. Thank you. Maya, you've given me the world. I mean, look at the way that I live, where I work, the people that I know, including Zende. And that's all because of you. Your generosity. But most importantly, I have my sister who turned out to be my very best friend. The bigger sacrifice would be missing out on this incredible opportunity to give you something that no one else can.",
        "Maya: Nicole... what are you saying?",
        "Nicole: I'd be honored to be your surrogate.",
        "Maya: [Voice breaking] You would?",
        "Nicole: [Voice breaking] Yes.",
        "Maya: What about Zende?",
        "Nicole: We'll work it out. But nothing is more important than me doing this for you.",
        "Maya: Listen, you need to know that Rick and I spoke to a fertilization specialist to get more information.",
        "Nicole: Okay.",
        "Maya: And there are other ways that we can go about doing this. We can harvest your egg, and we can get someone else to carry the baby.",
        "Nicole: I know. But I know that you and Rick would rather me carry your baby.",
        "Maya: No, honey, no. Only if it's okay with you. There is no pressure.",
        "Nicole: We've spent so much time apart. And now look how close we are. Just...imagine the connection. I want to do this. Be your surrogate. I want to carry your baby.",
