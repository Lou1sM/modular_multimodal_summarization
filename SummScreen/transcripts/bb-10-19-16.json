{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7445 ~ Ridge gives Eric a second chance to do the right thing for their family; Liam & Steffy get the chance to act on their feelings for each other."], "Recap": ["Ridge shows his dad the documents. It has his name on it as POA and all Eric has to do is sign it. He's not happy with Quinn being here but they will talk about that later. Right now they just need to talk about her not being POA and trying to take care of this house and the company. It can't be Quinn; it has to be Ridge. Quinn tells Pam once again that she loves Eric and she will be here all the time to take care of him. Liam tells Steffy that having her here in his arms in their house where all their memories are, he needs her here now. He says she does not have to bring everything over but just the essentials. He does not want her to leave. They can be discreet. He does realize she is trying to be sensitive to Wyatt. She says yes and that is why she would like to keep this just between them for now. She cannot move in now but she is ready to move forward. Without saying a word, he takes her hand and guides her to the bedroom. RJ tells Brooke that he is not that insecure little boy who wants his parents back together. But he knows how much they truly love each other and his dad is more than Bill will ever be to her. Rick walks in and tells Brooke that he would like an answer to what she and RJ were talking about. He realizes that she does not want to discuss her love life with her son. She reminds him that RJ does not like Bill anyway so she does not want Rick to add to that by talking badly about him too. They need Bill's shares. Rick says so far all of Ridge's ideas have been bad.", "Ridge keeps on about the POA until he upsets Eric and he calls out Quinn's name and finally manages to get to the panic button to get Quinn. She rushes in and Eric barks at Ridge to just go home. Steffy and Liam start to disrobe each other and he carries her to the bed. Afterwards he muses that everyone told him just to move on but he couldn't. She was always in his heart. She says even when things got rough she never stopped loving him either. Ridge tells Quinn that she has manipulated her way into a pretty nice situation. She says what situation she would like is that they get along. She is Eric's POA. Ridge tells her that he is going to continue to run the company and she will stay out of his way and he will give her a little office for her jewelry business. He will run the business and she can handle his father. He will check with the nurses and if she does one thing wrong she will be out of here as fast as she moved in. Eric has always let women snow him when they get their claws in him. None of them are here. She may have wrapped Eric around her little finger for now but it will fall to pieces and he will forget her. And make no mistake, her time is over here and Ridge will get rid of her."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Ridge: This is a new power of attorney. It's got my name on it. All you have to do is sign it. Dad, we can't afford any more disruptions. And with me at the helm, there won't be. So just sign this paper. It has to be me. It can't be Quinn.", "Quinn: Did you just bake those?", "Pam: Yeah. Eric always lets me use the kitchen. I just made them for when he gets strong enough to eat again.", "Quinn: Okay.", "Pam: Uh...", "Quinn: I know how you feel about me, pam. But I love Eric, and I'm gonna be here to take care of him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: I'm worried about him, Mom.", "Brooke: I am, too, R.J.; but your grandfather's doing great. He's alert and he's responsive and he is improving.", "R.J.: Yeah, well, I'm just glad I got to see him.", "Brooke: I think it meant a lot to him.", "R.J.: Me, too. You know, for a lot of reasons. It was good to be there with you and Dad together. Got to be next to Granddad's side. It was a real family moment.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: This feels right. You know why? Because we belong together.", "Steffy: I feel that, too. But you have to understand.", "Liam: I know. I know what you're gonna say. We'll be discreet. And Thomas is not gonna rat you out.", "Steffy: You also said that you were glad I wasn't ready to move in.", "Liam: Uh, yeah. Yeah, I was. But God, I mean...", "Steffy: [Chuckles]", "Liam: Having you in my arms like this, it's like... I mean, this is our home, Steffy. All of our memories, all of our plans for the future, they exist here.", "Steffy: And eventually I'll be here. But legally I'm still married to Wyatt.", "Liam: I know. But the reason you left him is because you wanted this.", "Steffy: Yeah. I do. And I don't want you to doubt that for a second. I don't want to be apart from you any longer.", "Liam: You don't have to bring over all your stuff. Just -- just, uh, the essentials that I don't already have.", "Steffy: I'm here now.", "Liam: Oh, come on! You know you want this! You know you do. Okay. Hear me out. Waking up together, coffee on the deck before we go to work, long weekends where we don't even get out of bed.", "Steffy: Okay, that is so not fair.", "Liam: I know, I know. It's so unfair. It's so unfair.", "Steffy: [Chuckles]", "Liam: But I don't want you to leave.", "Steffy: Okay, well, what are you doing the rest of the evening?", "Liam: I'm all yours.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "R.J.: Don't give me that look.", "Brooke: What look, sweetheart?", "R.J.: You don't need to worry about me anymore, all right? I mean, I'm not an insecure, little boy who's desperate about bringing parents back together. I just want you guys to be happy. That's all.", "Brooke: Ridge and I will always be here for you, R.J.", "R.J.: But who's gonna be there for you? Spencer? I mean, look at his track record. You can't depend on him. Do you count on Bill the same way you count on Dad, the same way Dad counts on you? You guys care for each other.", "Brooke: Yes, we do. And we always will.", "R.J.: You guys love each other, and it's obvious. You guys have patched stuff up before. Why can't you do it again?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: I'd like to know the answer to that question myself.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: Ridge is still up there with him?", "Quinn: Yeah.", "Pam: That worry you?", "Quinn: No. Eric needs his family around him. He loves you, despite everything you've all done to him. And I'm not threatened by that, because I know Eric loves me. Eric trusts me, pam. I wish you could, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Shouldn't have...", "Ridge: Shouldn't have what, Dad? I shouldn't have tried to protect the family, protect this company? There was no time to be diplomatic. I did what I thought was right for the -- for the family, for all of us. Look at you. You're getting better every day. And in a little while, you're gonna be running Forrester again, but until then, let me do it. Just sign this paper. No, I'm -- I'm not happy with Quinn being in your life. I'm not. No one is. But that's not what we're talking about right now. Just think about it. Take your time.", "Eric: Should not have done this.", "Ridge: All right. You're too upset with me. Let rick do it. Let Brooke do it. Anyone but Quinn. She can't be in charge of this company, our family, the family assets, this house.", "Eric: My...wife.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: I know that, um, you want to be sensitive to Wyatt.", "Steffy: Wyatt really did. He tried to control his mom.", "Liam: But you can't control how you feel.", "Steffy: [Sighs] Can we just keep this between us for a little while?", "Liam: What? No status update? No photo? I think we can take a selfie. We can take a selfie. I think I have my phone somewhere.", "Steffy: No, no. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Don't do that.", "Liam: But you look so happy.", "Steffy: So do you.", "Liam: I'm happier than I've been in a long time.", "Steffy: I know we can't pick up like nothing happened. But I'm ready to move forward. I want to be with you, Liam.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Waves crashing]", "R.J.: You can't deny it. Things have been different.", "Rick: And Ridge has been spending more time here.", "Brooke: The situation with Eric has been very stressful, and he's needed somebody to talk to.", "R.J.: He relies on you, Mom. He's told me that. What I don't understand is why it doesn't seem to matter.", "Brooke: Of course, it matters, R.J.", "R.J.: Then what are you doing with Bill? And why doesn't Dad seem to have a problem with it?", "Brooke: It's complicated.", "R.J.: Or it's none of my business, huh?", "Brooke: It affects you, R.J., and I want to respect that.", "R.J.: Or you don't want to discuss your love life with your kid.", "Rick: Hey, R.J., consider yourself lucky. I spent my entire childhood hearing about it.", "R.J.: I'll be in my room. Tell me if there's an update on Granddad.", "Brooke: All right, honey. I will.", "Rick: So you're telling me that R.J. doesn't know about Ridge's plan? You marry Bill, he gives you his shares of Forrester.", "Brooke: No.", "Rick: Don't you think R.J. is curious to why Ridge is okay with you and Bill?", "Brooke: If Ridge gets through to Eric, he's not going to need Bill's shares to control the company.", "Rick: And you won't need to marry Bill.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Dad.", "Eric: My...wife.", "Ridge: She's... [Groans] Okay. Your wife. You want to think about her that way, that's great. That's not even the issue right here. The issue is our company. That's why you have to sign this paper.", "Eric: Quinn.", "Ridge: Quinn isn't capable of running it. You can't do this to us, Dad.", "Eric: Quinn!", "Ridge: All right, you want her to take care of you, we can discuss that. We can --", "Eric: Quinn!", "Ridge: Dad, please. Calm down. What are you doing?", "Eric: Quinn!", "Ridge: This isn't good for you. Dad, please.", "Eric: Quinn!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Call button beeps]", "Quinn: Eric?", "[Call button beeps]", "Ridge: Dad, calm down. Don't do this. I'm telling you, this is too much responsibility for one person.", "Quinn: Eric, are you all right? What's going on?", "Eric: Wife. My wife.", "Quinn: It's okay.", "Quinn: You're upsetting your father.", "Ridge: Not my intention.", "Quinn: Do you need me to call the nurse? I think you should leave.", "Ridge: My dad asked me to stay.", "Quinn: No, he needs his rest.", "Eric: No. No.", "Quinn: No, no. The doctor was really clear, Eric. It doesn't matter what you have to say to Ridge. Your health comes first.", "Eric: You thought I wasn't there. I was. I knew. You kept Quinn away.", "Ridge: Because of this. Because she's trying to get between you and your family, like she's doing right now.", "Eric: Go.", "Ridge: Dad, I --", "Eric: Go!", "Quinn: Shh, shh, shh, shh.", "Ridge: We'll finish this later.", "Eric: [Breathing heavily]", "Quinn: It's okay. Shh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: If there's another way of handling this, I'm all for it. Forget Spencer's stake in Forrester. I never wanted you with that guy anyway.", "Brooke: [Sighs] I don't want you talking like that around your brother.", "Rick: What? R.J. doesn't want you with him, either.", "Brooke: He doesn't dislike Bill the way you do, and I don't want him to.", "Rick: You don't think I have a reason? A dozen reasons? What he did to Maya?", "Brooke: Bill regrets that.", "Rick: I know you want to help Ridge, and we all want to protect Dad. But marrying Bill shouldn't be a part of that. It's not why you commit the rest of your life to someone anyway.", "Brooke: I didn't accept Bill's proposal just to get the shares.", "Rick: You should have said no. To Bill, to Ridge, to all of it.", "Brooke: If Ridge gets Eric to see reason, Bill's shares aren't going to be an issue.", "Rick: Yeah, but Dad gave Quinn his power of attorney.", "Brooke: That was a mistake.", "Rick: Yeah, I agree. It's bad enough she has control over Dad. Now she's gonna have control over us, too?", "Brooke: Ridge will fix it.", "Rick: Well, so far all of ridge's great ideas have only made this situation worse.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: You're still here.", "Ridge: Has Dad calmed down?", "Quinn: You really upset him, Ridge. I can't let that happen again. I think you should go.", "Ridge: No. You're the one that's leaving. I'm gonna make sure of it.", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: [Sighs] You knew we'd be back here. You never gave up.", "Liam: I don't think that was a possibility. You're kind of it for me, you know. It's funny -- everybody said, \"you should move on. Find somebody else. There's plenty of beautiful, accomplished, attractive, sexy women in the world.\" That's great, but... you're all of that plus something else. Something I can't live without.", "Steffy: I thought I lost you, Liam.", "Liam: After everything we've been through, don't we always find our way back?", "Steffy: You held on. All this time, you waited. I guess you could say this is your \"I told you so\" moment.", "Liam: [Chuckles]", "Steffy: You believed in me. You believed in us. And you never stopped loving me, even when things got rough. Here we are. We're back together. Well, not -- not officially, but... that day will come.", "Liam: Yeah.", "Steffy: And when it does, it'll be my turn to say \"I told you so.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Oh, Quinn, Quinn, Quinn. You've manipulated your way into a pretty comfortable situation, haven't you?", "Quinn: I would be more comfortable if you and I can figure out a way to get along.", "Ridge: And I would be more comfortable if you took your gold-digging ways on the road. How about a different state? Alaska, maybe. No? Well, then here we are. I'm gonna move my stuff back into Dad's office because you don't know the first thing about running a company as large and as complex as Forrester creations. And I know I can't throw you out of the building, so we'll find you a little corner where you can make your jewelry. Stay away from my kids, okay?", "Quinn: I have Eric's power of attorney.", "Ridge: And I have decades of experience. I have the trust of my clients, my employees, and more than that, I have a responsibility to my family, so I'm gonna run this company, and you're gonna stay out of my way. Are we good? Good. Now... you're taking care of my dad. All right. I'm gonna talk to the nurse every day, and if I find out that for one second you do something that is not in his best interest, I'm gonna move you out of this house faster than you moved into it.", "Quinn: I am here, Ridge, because I love your father. We're committed to each other. We're making a life together.", "Ridge: My father -- he's a funny cat, isn't he? He lets himself be snowed by women like you. It's always been like that. They turn his head and they put their claws in him. Do me a favor. Look around for a sec. You notice something? None of them are here. And listen, I don't want to take away from your journey from your dirty, little apartment all the way to Monte Carlo all the way to here to the altar, right in this room. Fantastic. You made small work of him. You wrapped him around your finger. Well, you know what? It's not gonna last. When it all falls apart, we're gonna be there. The family's gonna be here to pick up the pieces. And Eric is gonna forget all about you, the same way he forgot about all the others. Make no mistake, Quinn Fuller. I'm gonna get rid of you.", "[Door opens]", "[Door closes]"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eyROF8Eh9w"}
