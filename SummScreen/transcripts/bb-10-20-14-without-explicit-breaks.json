        "Hope repeats it again. She meant it when she said she did not want Quinn anywhere near her family and that includes Deacon too. She will never change her mind on that. Quinn is not welcome in this family. Wyatt tells them that Hope has a right to her feelings. Quinn gives her side that maybe Hope needs to understand her more before she judges her. Hope says Quinn has no moral center for any life and she wants no part of her. She is shocked also that Deacon is now into it. He tells Hope that it may come as a surprise but they have been living together for some time now. Hope can't figure how Deacon could have anything to do with this woman after all she has done to her. Quinn says all she wants is her rightful place in her new grandchild's life. Hope again says no. Deacon tries again to beg Hope to just forgive Quinn. Hope says she has, more times than she deserves and it just keeps happening. She is not going to live like that looking out for her crazy MIL. And if Deacon is smart he would walk away right now before she pulls a sword on him too. Deacon begs again that please for him, do not shut Quinn out. He admits that Quinn has issues but she is working on it. Hope says she can not believe he is so blind toward Quinn. She tried to kill Liam and pushed Ivy in the Seine. Quinn tells Wyatt to defend her, he should defend his mother. He says that makes it hard with all the things she does. Quinn says she knows she has gone too far but she never would hurt Hope or her family. She can not wish that away now that they are family. Hope says she will always feel this way. She cares about Deacon and that he is in her life and that is something she always wanted but her loyalty is to her husband and her child. So it's Deacon's decision. If Quinn is going to be part of his life, then he can not be part of her life. It is either Quinn or her.",
        "Caroline laments to Ivy that she loves her husband and she should not be having these feelings for Ridge. She should be kissing the ground that Rick walks on and not thinking of Ridge. What is wrong with her? Ridge pulls away from his kiss with Kate and she notices and asks what is wrong. He tells Katie that he only has one more design with Caroline and then he will be finished, no more working together. Ridge calls Caroline and says he wants to work today and finish things ..but not at the office. They need more privacy so he suggests the cabin on Brooke's place. He explains there that he doesn't want interruptions like Rick popping in every five minutes. Brooke is not here now so no interruptions. They can finish their collaboration as it is not right to continue to lean on her. Katie tells Ivy that Ridge is telling Caroline today that their working has come to an end. Ridge tells Caroline that he loves Katie and he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. This is dangerous ground they are on and he has leaned on her too much. This divides him and Rick and he should not have asked her to do this. He says he enjoyed what they had together and what they produced and he does not know how to thank her for that. He says he needs to find his way back and he knows that sounds like he is throwing her aside, but he just thinks it is time. She says she will always be grateful for working with him. He has changed her as a designer and as a woman. Ridge tells her that Rick is lucky to have her and he hopes he knows that. She says okay; she is ready for one last time. He takes the pencil and puts it in her hands with his guiding hers. He leans closer and smells her hair from behind. Finally he grabs the pencil and tosses it away and kisses her again and again and she responds despite her resolve."

        "Hope: I have never meant anything more than what I just said. I don't want Quinn anywhere near me or my family, and that includes you.",
        "Quinn: With all due respect, your father is a grown man, and he can be with whoever he wants.",
        "Hope: I don't accept this.",
        "Deacon: Don't you think maybe you're being just a little harsh here?",
        "Hope: Me? After everything she's done? I-I think I'm showing enormous restraint.",
        "Quinn: Use your influence.",
        "Wyatt: Hope feels how she feels, mom.",
        "Hope: And that is never gonna change. You are not welcome in my family.",
        "Caroline: What is it?",
        "Katie: Are you all right?",
        "Ivy: This is a lot to take in -- you and Ridge.",
        "Caroline: God, no, there is no me and Ridge.",
        "Ivy: Well, it kind of sounds like there is something going on between you guys.",
        "Caroline: And it has to stop. Okay, I'm -- I am married to the man of my dreams. Rick is a wonderful husband. We're happy. God, why would I risk it all by kissing Ridge?",
        "Ivy: Well, it's because you're obviously attracted to him.",
        "Caroline: So what? It doesn't mean I should act on it. God, I-I thought I had worked through all of this -- being selfish and ungrateful. I thought I'd become a better person.",
        "Ivy: Caroline, no. You are a beautiful person.",
        "Caroline: I'm an idiot.",
        "Ivy: Ohh.",
        "Caroline: Rick is this amazing husband who loves and supports me. What I should be kissing is the ground that he walks on. Instead, every day, I can't wait to see another man...who, by the way, is engaged to Rick's aunt. What is wrong with me?",
        "Katie: What is it? You pulled away. What's wrong?",
        "Ridge: Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong.",
        "Katie: Well, then what happened?",
        "Ridge: I thought about what you said about Caroline and thinking that I'm using her and that that's more like what bill would do, and you're right, and I'm -- I'm better than that.",
        "Katie: You are. You are.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] So I'm gonna finish it with her. I'm -- I'm just gonna finish it and remove all temptation.",
        "Katie: What about the collection?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, we have one more design. We'll -- we'll do that, and then that's it. I'm -- I'm gonna set that in motion right now.",
        "Katie: Okay, good. I-I think that's a wise choice. I'm gonna go check on will.",
        "Ridge: Okay. [Sighs]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Caroline: Ridge. Hey. What's up?",
        "Ridge: I need to finish the collection.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, sure. I'm, uh, at Forrester right now.",
        "Ridge: I don't want to go there. We need to go somewhere more private. [Sighs] There is a cabin on Brooke's property.",
        "Caroline: I know it.",
        "Ridge: Meet me there.",
        "Quinn: I know that I have done some things -- things that are incomprehensible to you. But you have no idea what it's like to be me. You're manor-born into this warm, wonderful family, given every opportunity, every single advantage. Well, I had none of that.",
        "Hope: What is your point?",
        "Quinn: My point is, maybe you need to understand me before you can judge me.",
        "Hope: Oh, you no mystery, Quinn. You are a scheming, conniving, dangerous woman with no moral center and no regard for human life. You play your son shamelessly and tell him it's love.",
        "Quinn: He's my son, and you can't keep him away from me.",
        "Hope: I wouldn't be so sure about that. And what the hell is this?",
        "Wyatt: Curious about that myself.",
        "Deacon: Well, the fact of the matter is, uh, Quinn and I have been living together for quite some time now.",
        "Hope: I can't believe this. You have been living with Quinn this whole time.",
        "Deacon: Somehow, I just didn't think you'd take it so well.",
        "Hope: God, you were always so vague about where you were staying. Did you target my father?",
        "Quinn: What? Of course not. How would I?",
        "Hope: The same way you do everything -- underhandedly.",
        "Deacon: Okay, it wasn't like that.",
        "Hope: How would you have any idea? Quinn has this master-of-deception thing down cold. She doesn't leave any clues behind.",
        "Quinn: Well, I-I resent that.",
        "Wyatt: I wouldn't if I were you. You earned this.",
        "Hope: You know, the more I think about it -- Quinn pretending not to know you on sight, insinuating herself into your life with her lies and manipulations.",
        "Quinn: To what end, hope?",
        "Hope: To this -- this. What's happening right now. I shut you out of my life, so you pull the father card out of your back pocket to fight your battles and get back in.",
        "Quinn: No. No. See, you give me way too much credit, and I-I frankly don't know whether to be flattered or insulted. Maybe now you can understand our reluctance at coming forward.",
        "Hope: How can you feel anything but anger towards this woman after everything she's done to me?",
        "Quinn: What is so wrong with your life? You're happily married. You have a baby on the way. You have a doting family surrounding you. That's as it should be. I'm part of that family. I'm your husband's mother. I'm your baby's grandmother, and all I'm asking for is that I get my rightful place in that.",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Katie: Hmm. Those look nice.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Thanks. I have a feeling these aren't going to be right for this collection, though.",
        "Katie: What are you talking about? This stuff is gorgeous.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, it's just -- it's just it's not quite right. We're doing a lot of guesswork. We were kind of winging it, you know, until we got something off of Ridge.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, that's not a problem anymore.",
        "Ivy: No, not at all. Ridge and Caroline have been producing like crazy. You know, I have a feeling this could be the start of a more permanent collaboration.",
        "Katie: No. I don't think so. In fact, I know it's not.",
        "Caroline: Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Hey. You're here. Good.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I'm just still not sure why.",
        "Ridge: Well, we have one more design.",
        "Caroline: Why here and not your office?",
        "Ridge: 'Cause I don't want the interruptions. I don't want Rick coming in every five minutes. [Sighs] And besides, this place is pretty special. Brooke and I -- we created a few cool things in here when we were together.",
        "Caroline: It's nice.",
        "Ridge: Well, she's not here, and, um, no one's gonna interrupt us, so we can -- we can finish our last design, and then -- then we can -- we can finish this collaboration... 'cause it's not right.",
        "Caroline: You're feeling something, too, aren't you?",
        "Deacon: Quinn's right whether you like it or not. She's Wyatt's mother. And she's a part of this family you're starting, and she's with me now.",
        "Wyatt: This is weird. The two of you together -- it -- it's -- it's weird.",
        "Deacon: Look, we're definitely not perfect parents, but we love our kids like crazy. Hope, please. You are so forgiving and so compassionate. I mean, who would know better than me, right? There have been a thousand times that you could have kicked me to the curb, and you would have been justified. I mean, look -- I don't have to remind you of how I interfered, right, with your plans with Liam. And what'd you do? You forgave me. Please -- why -- why can't you just forgive Quinn?",
        "Hope: Because it never stops. I have forgiven her plenty of times -- more times than she's deserved -- and it just keeps happening. It's pointless. I just have to forgive her the next time she crosses a line, and I'm not gonna live my life like that -- always looking over my shoulder for my crazy mother- in-law. I am not going to inflict that on my child. And if you were smart, you would walk away right now...before she pulls a sword on you while you sleep.",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. Don't be ridiculous.",
        "Hope: Are we just gonna pretend that what happened with Liam didn't happen?",
        "Quinn: I-I already admitted that I was wrong for doing that. I appalled myself. It's why I got treatment.",
        "Deacon: Listen to me, hope. Please. We have a shot here, guys, of being a real family. This child that you're carrying inside of you -- it connects all of us. I -- okay, I get it. You know, Quinn's done some questionable things, but she is that kid's blood. Please, for me, don't shut her out.",
        "Ivy: Is there a problem between Ridge and Caroline?",
        "Katie: No, no. Nothing like that. It's just that the collaboration is ending, and that's actually why I'm here. I wanted to talk to Rick.",
        "Ivy: Oh. So, Ridge isn't happy with Caroline's designs?",
        "Katie: I think he thinks she's a very talented designer.",
        "Ivy: So, why not keep working with her?",
        "Katie: Well, the collection is almost finished. There's no reason to.",
        "Ivy: Right. Does Caroline know this?",
        "Katie: If she doesn't yet, she will. Ridge is telling her today.",
        "Caroline: I can look at you and see that I'm not alone in this. You're starting to have feelings for me, too.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Well, no, I'm -- I'm not gonna lie to you. I-I think about you all the time, and -- and I have crazy thoughts. But I love Katie. I really do. And I want to marry her and spend my life with her, so I -- we're not gonna -- this is not gonna derail that.",
        "Caroline: You think it could?",
        "Ridge: I-I think this is very dangerous ground, and I'm responsible for that.",
        "Caroline: I've been in the room, too.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] But I-I think maybe I leaned on you too much, and -- and this fight is between me and Rick.",
        "Caroline: And I-I can't go against him. As much as I...like and respect you, he's my husband.",
        "Ridge: And I shouldn't have asked you.",
        "Caroline: It's just you being Ridge -- single-mindedly going after something you want.",
        "Ridge: And now I'm single-mindedly stepping away from it.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, it's best.",
        "Ridge: Man... [Sighs] I enjoyed what we had together and what we created together and the connection we had and -- and -- and how unselfish you were with me. I don't know how to thank you for that. And look. Ta-da.",
        "Caroline: It's -- it's wonderful.",
        "Ridge: It's not, but it's a start. But I-I got to -- I got to try to find my way back, you know?",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I-I knew the day would come when you wouldn't need me anymore.",
        "Ridge: Don't say that. I -- don't make it sound like I used you, and now I'm throwing you aside, 'cause that's not --",
        "Caroline: No, no. It's been incredible. [Chuckles] Yeah, I will leave this cabin a much better designer than I ever thought I could be, and that's because of you, so... thank you for choosing me. I will be forever grateful for this experience. And now you'll rock your designs, and I'll rock mine.",
        "Ridge: When we kissed...",
        "Caroline: No. Hey. No one else needs to know.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, you and hope remember the party after you guys were married, right? Everyone was there. There were Forresters, Spencers, Logans, and then there was me and Quinn, and you know what? Here's the amazing thing about it -- nobody got excluded. Nobody was made to feel like less. Honey, I have to tell you -- that -- that night -- it meant so much to me. I mean, there's no reason that it can't be like that all the time.",
        "Hope: No rea-- Quinn. Quinn is the reason, and it really worries me that you're so blind to that fact. Dad, I-I realize that you're frustrated that you're not with mom, so, okay, find somebody else. Find anybody else. Please, just not her.",
        "Deacon: Look, I get it, all right? Quinn's got issues. Hell, she's got volumes. But you know what? She's working on it. I mean, she'll be the first to admit it, but she's at least learning how to manage it.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I-I've been doing really well, and deacon gets props for that. He keeps me centered.",
        "Hope: Don't believe her, dad. Do not believe this normal act. She is a threat. She attacked Liam. She pushed Ivy into the seine.",
        "Deacon: I know.",
        "Hope: Okay, so then how do you expect to bring her here, telling me that you're in a relationship and think that we're just gonna hug it out? How can you do that?",
        "Quinn: You know what? Just speak up, okay? Anytime. Stand up for your mother. Defend me.",
        "Wyatt: You make that very hard after all the things you've done.",
        "Quinn: For you!",
        "Hope: No!",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my --",
        "Hope: No. Do not put your crazy onto my husband. He has carried that burden around for years, and it stops now.",
        "Quinn: Look, I know that sometimes, I go a little too far. [Sighs] I never was going to hurt you. You are my son's wife. You're the mother of my grandchild. I'm involved with your father. We're family. I mean, nothing is going to change that. You can't wish it away.",
        "Hope: Nothing you're saying matters right now -- nothing. My opinion is never going to change. I will always feel this way. I don't want you around my child. Dad. Dad, I care about you. I love that you're in my life. I love that we're getting closer. That means so much to me. It is something that I have always wanted. But my responsibility is to my child and my husband.",
        "Quinn: My son.",
        "Hope: So I think you have a decision to make.",
        "Deacon: What -- what are you saying, honey?",
        "Hope: If she is going to be a part of your life... then you can't be a part of mine. It's either her or me.",
        "Ridge: It's best this way.",
        "Caroline: I know. I just -- I'll miss us -- what we created together.",
        "Ridge: You always say that I taught you. Well, you taught me things I didn't even know about myself. And you made me see things through somebody else's eyes.",
        "Caroline: Same here. And your perspective changed me as a designer...and as a woman. I'll always treasure our time together.",
        "Ridge: Me, too. Your husband's very lucky to have you. I hope he knows that.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] He does.",
        "Ridge: If he ever forgets, you know, he can call me, and I'll...",
        "Caroline: I don't think that that's a good idea. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Shall we?",
        "Caroline: One last time."
