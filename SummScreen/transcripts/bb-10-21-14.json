        "Rick is not happy with the latest design. Maya walks in and questions it and wonders why neither Ridge or Caroline's car is in the parking lot. She wonders where they are. Rick says it makes no difference as long as they are designing more lovely pieces. Ridge and Caroline continue the kiss but then she gets another pencil and gives it to him and says he can do it. Deacon asks Hope if she is giving him an ultimatum. She opines that she has good reason to keep Quinn from her family and if Deacon chooses Quinn then he needs to know he will be out of Hope's life. Quinn manipulates people to get what she want. Right now she is using him. Hope tells Deacon that he is smarter than that. He should see through this con. Deacon and Quinn leave and Wyatt holds Hope. He brings her some herbal tea. He hates to see her stressed out. He says he knows she does not like his mom and her dad together, but maybe that is a good thing to keep her away from them. Quinn tells Deacon that she is only trying to bring peace and love into this family. She should be knitting, picking out names or helping with the nursery but this is the way that Hope treats her. She is being completely unreasonable throwing these temper tantrums. Maya tells Rick that the pairing of Caroline and Ridge goes way beyond the sketch pad. Rick tells Maya that this is enough. If she has something to say then just spit it out. She says she just wants him to open his eyes and be aware. She has not said anything specific until now, but she caught them in each other's arms. They were not designing. Ridge takes the pencil and finishes the sketch all by himself. Wyatt asks Hope if she meant it when she said Deacon had to chose. She says she hopes by saying that he will take another look and realize what this will cost him. Wyatt agrees that his mom is using Deacon as much as he is using her. They simply can not worry about what their parents do. The baby is all that matters, keeping her or him happy and safe. They just need to live their lives and let their parents lead theirs.",
        "Quinn comes on to Deacon and says Hope does not realize what they have, how they touch. He is Hope's father and can be useful but they have gotten past that. He will just be letting Hope get away with this by being paranoid and letting Hope inside his head. He starts to leave and she says wait, he is not going anywhere. She starts peeling off her clothes. She tells him to close the door. He's staying and she is not going to stop until he sees exactly what else she has to offer. It doesn't take any encouragement; he follows her to the couch and she pushes him back on it with her stilettos on his chest. Maya puts more seeds of doubt in Rick's mind about Caroline and Rick. Caroline is happy to see that Ridge is getting his groove back. She comes to him and is \"thisclose\" to his lips but then says goodbye and leaves."

        "Rick: I don't mind Caroline and Ridge taking risks, but this? I mean, no, no, no. What is this even supposed to be -- a bow? Because it looks like a bird flew into the dress and died. If we remove it entirely, maybe -- maybe I'll include it in the line. That'll be all. Thank you.",
        "Maya: You a designer now?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rick: I'm president of the company, hoping to be C.E.O. soon, involved in all facets of the business.",
        "Maya: That was one of Ridge and Caroline's?",
        "Rick: Yes.",
        "Maya: The happy little design team. Where are they right now, anyway?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Honey, are you giving me an ultimatum here?",
        "Hope: I don't want to.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but that's what this is. He chooses me or you.",
        "Deacon: I'm finally back in your life. I mean, I'm -- I'm actually feeling like a father to you, and you would do this?",
        "Hope: I have a responsibility to protect myself and my family, and that means keeping her far away. But if you are choosing a life with her, to be in a relationship with her, then... I have loved getting closer to you --",
        "Deacon: Okay, stop. Just -- just stop. Hope, think about this.",
        "Hope: No! You need to think. This is what she does. She manipulates. She uses people to get what she wants. She's using you. I tell her that she can't be around my baby, and suddenly, she's interested in you? Doesn't that seem suspicious?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I knew this would be a waste of time. Thanks for trying. She hates me too much to understand.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Mom, come on. You've interfered in her life so many times. Can't you see why she'd be upset by all this?",
        "Deacon: Okay, Wyatt, upset is one thing. We figured that, but, honey, this is too much. I mean, being with Quinn shouldn't mean giving you up.",
        "Hope: She's manipulating you to get to me. That's what this is.",
        "Deacon: Right, 'cause, you know, why else would she want to be with me?",
        "Hope: That's not what I said. I know you're upset that it didn't work out with mom. I'm sorry. But that doesn't mean you should turn to Quinn. You're smarter than that. You, of all people, should see through this con.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, you two need to leave.",
        "Deacon: Okay, you know, just in a minute. Let's talk about this.",
        "Wyatt: No. Now.",
        "Quinn: She needs to calm down.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I'm not sure where Ridge and Caroline are. Maybe my dad's office or perhaps the sky lounge.",
        "Maya: Nope. Neither of their cars are in the parking lot.",
        "Rick: Well, then they must be working someplace else. It doesn't really matter, as long as they're sketching.",
        "Maya: She doesn't tell you when she's leaving?",
        "Rick: My wife and I both have very busy schedules. We don't keep tabs on each other throughout the day.",
        "Maya: Seems like I'd want my husband to know what I was up to.",
        "Rick: [Sighs]",
        "Maya: Unless...I didn't.",
        "Rick: Meaning?",
        "Maya: They've been spending so much time together.",
        "Rick: A design team tends to do that.",
        "Maya: With a team like Caroline and Ridge? There's no limit to where their creativity might lead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I'm gonna miss this -- our collaboration.",
        "Caroline: You don't need me anymore.",
        "Ridge: Don't be so sure about that.",
        "Caroline: Go ahead. You can do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Thanks.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Give me these.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] This is so messed up.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Just try to put them out of your mind, okay?",
        "Hope: This is my dad and your mom. It's wrong on so many levels.",
        "Wyatt: I know. It's a little strange, but it doesn't do us any good to worry about it, and I don't like seeing you stressed out, especially now. Look, I understand you have your issues with my mom, and I don't blame you, but maybe her focusing on something other than me and this baby just might be a good thing.",
        "Hope: But that's not what this is. She's not focusing on something else. This is her worming her way back into our lives.",
        "Wyatt: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Hope: She picked my dad. Of all the people she could have picked, she picked my dad.",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Hope: It's obvious what she's doing. If Quinn were in a relationship, that would be a good thing. Of course. It would mean that she is away from us. You know, she would have her own life.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: I would welcome that. But not my dad. He's got to know that she's using him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: [Exhales deeply] You know Hope's just trying to protect her kid.",
        "Quinn: From its grandmother?",
        "Deacon: Well, granny does have a history of threatening people with swords.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: I mean, come on, baby. It's not like you're spending your afternoons knitting.",
        "Quinn: Well, I can knit. I could learn if she gave me the chance... if she gave us the chance. [Sighs] I am trying to bring peace and harmony into this family. I'm her mother-in-law. I'm this baby's grandmother. [Sighs] I should be throwing her a baby shower, helping her pick out names, helping her decorate her nursery, and this is how she treats me? And you -- you poor man. I mean, you were just -- you were trying to get her to understand that there's somebody special in your life. What kind of a person gives her father an ultimatum like that? She can't dictate who you spend time with. In a matter of months, she is going to be a mother, and she's throwing these huge temper tantrums. It's -- it's ridiculous. She's being completely unreasonable.",
        "Deacon: Is she?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: I mean, after everything you've done to her?",
        "Quinn: Come on. Don't tell me she's getting to you.",
        "Deacon: Is Hope right? I mean, are you... are you just using me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Why are you doing this?",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Rick: Causing trouble.",
        "Maya: Me?",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Maya: I'm not the one missing in action around here. That's your wife. If anyone's causing trouble, it would be her.",
        "Rick: Is she off somewhere with Ridge? Yeah, well, she better be. They have a collection to finish. They're partners.",
        "Maya: A partnership that goes way beyond the sketchpad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Take the big, bad pencil. Don't be afraid. Do it, Ridge. Show me what you got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Is there something specific you'd like to tell me? Because if there is, I would prefer it if you just, you know, spit it out.",
        "Maya: Just be careful. That's all. Be aware.",
        "Rick: Of Caroline?",
        "Maya: And Ridge and whatever it is they're doing.",
        "Rick: Enough! All right? That's enough attacking my wife like this.",
        "Maya: Okay, I have been keeping my mouth shut, but there's something you need to know about.",
        "Rick: No, here's what I know. You're upset about what happened between you and Carter, and you think if you can drive a wedge between Caroline and me, that it just might make you feel better.",
        "Maya: I caught them.",
        "Rick: Excuse me?",
        "Maya: I walked in on them.",
        "Rick: On...?",
        "Maya: Caroline and Ridge. And they were doing a lot more than designing. She was in his arms.",

        "Wyatt: Did you mean it? Telling your dad he had to choose?",
        "Hope: Yes. I think so.",
        "Wyatt: I know how much it means to you, having him back in your life again. You know?",
        "Hope: And I really don't want to lose him. I am praying that he will not choose a relationship with Quinn -- that he will take a good look at her and realize what she's up to, that she's using him. [Sighs] God, I hope I got through to him.",
        "Wyatt: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: I mean, is this just some elaborate con? You know, just a way for you to get me to go to bat with Hope?",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Deacon: I mean, here I am -- I'm -- I'm with a person that I barely know, and I'm telling my daughter that we're seeing each other.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Aren't we?",
        "Deacon: So you can have access to Hope, to the baby?",
        "Quinn: There's more to it than that. I mean, these past few weeks of you living here, spending time together, sharing a few beers, a few laughs, getting to know each other -- did any of that seem fake to you?",
        "Deacon: No.",
        "Quinn: Then why are you letting Hope's extremely skewed opinions about me get to you? She doesn't know what she's talking about. She doesn't know how we relate, how we touch.",
        "Deacon: All right, let me ask you a question. If I'm just some Joe Schmoe off the street, you know, no relation to Hope, would you have asked me to move in here? I mean, you know, rent-free? Full refrigerator?",
        "Quinn: Of course not. Don't be stupid. I let you move in here because you're Hope's father, because I thought you could be useful, and you were, but don't you think we've gotten past that?",
        "Deacon: I think I've overstayed my welcome.",
        "Quinn: Deacon.",
        "Deacon: Look, I'm not gonna jeopardize my relationship with my daughter.",
        "Quinn: You are letting her get away with this.",
        "Deacon: Nobody cons me... not even you.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You are being paranoid. You're letting her get inside your head.",
        "Deacon: It's about time. I'm out of here.",
        "Quinn: Deacon, wait. You're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: My dad is vulnerable right now.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Deacon Sharpe can handle himself. There is nothing vulnerable about him.",
        "Hope: He's upset that things didn't work out with my mom.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: I know he is. She turned him down, and she left for Italy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: As tough as he would like to come across, he's hurting. So Quinn shows him a little attention. I get it. I-I get why he would go to her.",
        "Wyatt: Or he's having a good time using her as much as she's using him, and there's nothing wrong with that. Okay, look, I-I don't want to talk about our parents anymore, okay?",
        "Hope: It's -- it's just --",
        "Wyatt: No. Mnh-mnh.",
        "Hope: It's hard --",
        "Wyatt: Shh! Shh!",
        "Wyatt: Look, we can't worry about what our parents do. This is what matters, okay? [Chuckles] The future, our family, our baby -- keeping him or her happy and healthy and safe.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: My mom, your dad -- whether they're using one another or not -- who cares? Let them deal with it. You and I -- we just need to live our lives. And that's it. We'll be the, uh -- the parents we never had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Close the door.",
        "Deacon: That doesn't mean I'm staying.",
        "Quinn: Oh, you're staying.",
        "Deacon: You gonna make me?",
        "Quinn: I'm not gonna let you leave until you experience a little bit more of what I have to offer.",
        "Deacon: I'm listening.",
        "Quinn: That's right. You're gonna listen, and then you're gonna do exactly what I say.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Tell me your safe word.",
        "Deacon: Diamonds.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Caroline was in Ridge's arms?",
        "Maya: Yes.",
        "Rick: Where?",
        "Maya: Here. In the office. I walked in on them.",
        "Rick: Hugging?",
        "Maya: Yes, in an embrace -- an intimate embrace.",
        "Rick: It could be for any number of reasons.",
        "Maya: You didn't see it, Rick.",
        "Rick: I hug people all the time. It doesn't mean that I'm trying to jump in the sack with them.",
        "Maya: They were alone.",
        "Rick: I am not worried about my wife hugging her design partner, Maya.",
        "Maya: You don't want to believe me. That's fine. Caroline doesn't appreciate you. She doesn't appreciate you or the life that you've given her, and that's apparent. But you don't want to see it. If it were me -- if I were your wife -- I would appreciate you. You would never find me in another man's arms.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: It's a little rough.",
        "Caroline: No, no. It's -- it's -- I'm happy for you. The greatest designer I've ever known -- he's -- he's back.",
        "Ridge: And our partnership is...",
        "Caroline: Yeah. What we shared in design... [Sighs] I can only imagine... I guess we'll never know.",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Caroline: Goodbye."
