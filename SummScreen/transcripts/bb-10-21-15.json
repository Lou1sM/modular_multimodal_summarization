    "Recap": [
        "Brooke listens to Ridge go on and on about Caroline really being pregnant. She questions him about the vasectomy and him being sterile and clearly she is not really buying what he is saying and wonders who's the father of this baby. He laughs and makes light of himself as Ridge Forrester, the super stud. She says she only wants him to be happy and if this is it, she will congratulate him. They hug. Steffy puts her feet in Liam's lap as if she wants a foot rub. He hopes she is not upset that he went over her head. She says of course not. She only outranks him at work. He was doing his job; here they are equals. Pam and Charlie fawn over Caroline trying to encourage her to sit down and get comfortable. Pam does tell her that she couldn't help herself; she told Brooke the big news. Caroline frowns.",
        "Ivy hopes Wyatt is not jealous of Liam and him taking Ivy's side against Steffy. He claims he is not but he is feeling guilty for how she felt parading around in her underwear. She feels he owes her and challenges him to taking off him pants and just wearing his underwear. She suggests the show room. Wyatt takes off his shirt and dances sexily around and then takes off his jeans really slowly while Ivy slips a dollar in his underwear. Pam and Charlie storm in both laughing and Charlie even takes several pictures. Wyatt puts his pants back on while Pam is encouraging him to twirl around more. She starts to hand out lemon bars but Wyatt tells them to leave and he slams the door. Charlie says now he knows what women mean that they are just a piece of meat. Wyatt gets it; underwear is pretty scary. But he thought Ivy did good and that is one of the reasons he loves her. He said it \u0096 he loves her. She kisses him. Ridge walks into the loft while Caroline is looking on her phone at the wedding photos and thinking how Ridge has talked her into accepting this baby and not letting Thomas know. She asks about Brooke and Ridge says she finally came around to believing him, so all is okay. Caroline does not need to stress out at all. No one will ever know the truth."

        "Ridge: I told you I had it reversed.",
        "Brooke: Against your doctor's wishes. He advised you against it because of your condition. There's no viable --",

        "Charlie: Yeah, you're okay? Pammy, she needs another pillow. Pillow? Pillow?",
        "Pam: She's on it.",
        "Charlie: Oh, okay.",
        "Caroline: You guys, I'm -- I'm just pregnant. I'm not an invalid.",
        "Charlie: Uh-huh. Right. You still barfing a lot?",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Pam: [Laughing] Don't mind him. Are you feeling better, sweetheart?",
        "Caroline: Yes, uh, thank you. Um, I was actually on my way home.",
        "Pam: Oh, well, you should go home. Come on. Get some rest. We'll get you back up.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Pam: You're a mommy-to-be.",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Pam: I really wish that Steph could be here to see another little Forrester baby on the way. Speaking of which, um... I sort of did something.",
        "Caroline: Yeah?",
        "Pam: I just couldn't help myself. I-I told Brooke about the news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Ooh!",
        "Wyatt: Oh, okay. Yep.",
        "Ivy: I'm so happy!",
        "Wyatt: I know. You're squeezing me a little too tight here.",
        "Ivy: Am I actually?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Ivy: Oops. I'm sorry. It's just, I'm so happy. I feel so free.",
        "Wyatt: Free?",
        "Ivy: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Free of the heavy burden of lingerie modeling?",
        "Ivy: You know how badly I didn't want to do that.",
        "Wyatt: I know! I know now. It's just, I'm feeling -- I don't know -- a little guilty, here.",
        "Ivy: Why?",
        "Wyatt: I didn't want you backing down from Steffy. And I-I hated that she was intimidating you. And -- and I just -- I want you to understand that I never would've pushed you into something if I knew you were uncomfortable.",
        "Ivy: No, I know, and I do -- I understand.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Ivy: But I'm a big girl, remember? And I do make my own decisions.",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: It's just a shame, though.",
        "Ivy: What's a shame? I already know...",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: ...What you're about to say.",
        "Wyatt: I just had these fantasies.",
        "Ivy: [Laughing]",
        "Wyatt: I was dating a lingerie model. And all the private showings I was gonna get when I got home...",
        "Ivy: Look, just -- just -- [Laughs] Just because I'm not gonna be a lingerie model anymore doesn't mean I can't still be a customer.",
        "Wyatt: Oh.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: I see what you did there.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Mm. Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Ohh. Ugh, what a day.",
        "Liam: Was it that bad?",
        "Steffy: No, no, not bad, just eventful. I mean, first, you pull the plug on Ivy modeling the lingerie line, which was a good thing to do. Thank you.",
        "Liam: You're welcome.",
        "Steffy: Ah, yes.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Steffy: No, just... to go from butting heads with Ivy and, uh, to try to make an effort to get along, it's just... and then finding out that Caroline is pregnant, that I could have a little baby brother or sister? It's just -- it's a lot.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: A lot to handle, you know?",
        "Liam: Well, how do you feel about that, by the way -- your dad having another kid?",
        "Steffy: How do I feel about that? I don't know. I feel like... feel like a foot rub.",
        "Liam: Foot rub. Okay.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Liam: All right.",
        "Steffy: Ahh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: You told Brooke?",
        "Pam: I really tried super-duper hard to keep it a secret. But, you know, it just kind of slipped out.",
        "Caroline: Oh. [Laughter] So, how di-- uh... how did Brooke take the news?",
        "Charlie: Strangely. [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: Strangely?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Pam: She really seemed... well, awfully surprised by it.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I mean, weird, huh? I mean, it's not exactly a big bombshell.",
        "Pam: I know.",
        "Charlie: I mean, you and Ridge are married. You've been talking about having kids. You know, I don't understand why she would think it was so hard that you were actually doing it.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles nervously]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: This is my child.",
        "Brooke: It can't be.",
        "Ridge: Are you kidding me right now?",
        "Brooke: Ridge, you would've told me if you had a reversal.",
        "Ridge: Why would I tell you anything? Uh, I-it's really none of your business. You know what people do when they find out that someone is pregnant? They say congratulations. That's what they say.",
        "Brooke: I will say congratulations when I believe it's yours. Right now, I am not buying this story one bit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Hey, you aren't feeling jealous or anything, are you?",
        "Wyatt: Of?",
        "Ivy: Well, of Liam, the fact that he stood up for me against Steffy, which he hasn't done.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, it kind of made me feel happy. But I just -- I want you to know that it didn't stir up any old feelings.",
        "Wyatt: It didn't even occur to me that it would.",
        "Ivy: Okay, good.",
        "Wyatt: Good.",
        "Ivy: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: You know what the best part of this is?",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Ivy: I think it's almost the end of this whole \"choosing between Steffy and Ivy\" thing.",
        "Wyatt: What do you mean?",
        "Ivy: We agreed to try to get along.",
        "Wyatt: Let me guess. This was an agreement brokered by Mr. Hero himself.",
        "Ivy: Well, Liam was somewhat instrumental in the whole thing, yes.",
        "Wyatt: Yay! Liam saves the day again! Yay!",
        "Ivy: Well, everyone needs a hobby, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Boy, does he ever.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: But good for him.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: You know? And I'm glad he found a way to try and make up for letting you down.",
        "Ivy: Now, if only there was a way I could figure out how to make it up to you for letting you down.",
        "Wyatt: What are you talking about?",
        "Ivy: Well, I just -- you know, I was thinking...",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Ivy: Just -- poor thing. You were probably very excited about watching me walk around in my underwear all day.",
        "Wyatt: I was!",
        "Ivy: I know.",
        "Wyatt: A lot of fantasies that just went [Whistles] Right out the window.",
        "Ivy: I get it.",
        "Wyatt: But there's always home.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I can give you a private screening.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I'm okay with that.",
        "Ivy: But there might be a price to pay.",
        "Wyatt: Price?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I feel like you kind of owe me.",
        "Wyatt: I owe you?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: What do I owe you?",
        "Ivy: Well, it's just, I've been walking around in my underwear for a really long time.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: And you haven't.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, what is going on in that beautiful Aussie head of yours right now?",
        "Ivy: It's just, I can't get this thing out of my head that you said. You said that it'd be really easy, prancing around in my underwear, right?",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Ivy: So you do it.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: Strip.",
        "Wyatt: Strip?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Seriously?",
        "Ivy: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Here.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, we could go to the showroom. Do you want to go to the --",
        "Wyatt: No. No, no. I mean, uh, we're fine here in the office.",
        "Ivy: Cool!",
        "Wyatt: Wait, so, this is my ticket to a private show tonight. That's what you're saying?",
        "Ivy: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: If I do this, I get a private showing?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, fine.",
        "Ivy: Yes!",
        "Wyatt: All right.",
        "Ivy: This is the best. Hey, that was actually a lot easier than what I thought.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, of course, it was.",
        "Ivy: Good to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Lemon bars! Whoa!",
        "[Record scratches]",
        "Pam: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Um...",
        "Liam: So, do you think Thomas will be upset?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, he had feelings for her. I'm sure it's gonna be hard for him to see Caroline and my dad together, and now that she's pregnant?",
        "Liam: So... are you gonna tell him?",
        "Steffy: No. No, that's -- that's something my dad and Caroline should do. I'll let Thomas hear the news from them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Weren't you telling me not too long ago that you were sterile?",
        "Ridge: And then I told you I had a reversal.",
        "Brooke: But your doctor said that --",
        "Ridge: My doctor was skeptical. But I said, \"I really want to have a baby with this woman.\" And I thought, what the hell? Why can't we do this? And he said, \"Yes, okay. Let's do it.\" And I was lucky. It worked out. Why are you doubting me?",
        "Brooke: Okay, so, she got pregnant just like that?",
        "Ridge: Yes, just like that. I'm sorry about what I said earlier. It is your business. You're my friend. You listen to me. And I confided in you, and you helped me. You gave me advice. I didn't say anything because... I didn't want to get my hopes up, you know? It was an impossible situation, and -- and I thought if I said it out loud, it would just jinx it. I understand that you're skeptical and that you don't believe me. I don't believe it myself. Maybe it's my turn, you know? It's been a rough couple of years. Maybe it's -- it's my turn to be happy now. So, that's it. You understand, right? I'm... I'm having a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Looking good, Wyatt!",
        "Charlie: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. If I had time to do sit-ups all day long, I'd look like that, too.",
        "Pam: Wyatt, do a little turn for us. Show us what you got.",
        "Wyatt: No, I am not doing --",
        "Pam: Work it. Work it.",
        "Wyatt: I'm gonna put my pants on.",
        "Pam: Oh, wait. Hold on one second. Before you put your pants on, get your camera out, Charlie. Take a picture. I think those underpants are so cute. Charlie, you should get a pair.",
        "Wyatt: Charlie, phone down. Oh, my God. Phone down.",
        "Charlie: Actually, that's a good look for you, much better than tightie- whities. Wait a minute. So, this is what bothers women, so -- feeling like a piece of meat, huh?",
        "Ivy: Ugh! Finally! Thank you. See, Charlie gets it. Now you know exactly why I wasn't so thrilled about walking around in my underwear.",
        "Wyatt: You -- Charlie, what are you doing?! Phone, man! Come on! Look out for your fellow man here!",
        "Charlie: No, I'm sorry. If Pammy likes these, I got to make it happen. And, hey, do those fit to size? How does that --",
        "Wyatt: Out. Out of here. Get out. Out of here.",
        "Pam: Do you guys want the lemon bars?",
        "Ivy: I'm just gonna steal one. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!",
        "Pam: Really cute.",
        "Wyatt: Out.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Ivy: [Inhales deeply] What?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, this is funny for you.",
        "Ivy: A little bit, uh-huh.",
        "Wyatt: This is funny. Good.",
        "Ivy: Do you remember when the pizza guy showed up last week? What did you say? You said, \"Go on out to the door, 'cause you need to feel very comfortable in your underwear in front of other people.\"",
        "Wyatt: Okay, you made your point.",
        "Ivy: I know. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: What... just happened? Underwear is scary.",
        "Ivy: Mm?",
        "Wyatt: It's very, very scary.",
        "Ivy: I know it is. See? You get it now, hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Feet are good?",
        "Steffy: Mm, yeah, my feet feel great.",
        "Liam: You want me to do your back?",
        "Steffy: No -- no, you've already done so much for me today. Let me do something for you.",
        "Liam: I mean, I'm not gonna argue with that.",
        "Steffy: Hmm?",
        "Liam: Although I don't think I did that much.",
        "Steffy: Are you kidding me? You stopped me from forcing Ivy to model lingerie.",
        "Liam: Ah.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: That.",
        "Steffy: Yes, that. Thank you.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: I'm not proud of my choices that I've made lately, especially when it comes to Ivy. But you shook some sense into me.",
        "Liam: Well, I think it just needed to be said.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. It's like your magic talent -- one of them.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] What is?",
        "Steffy: You always know what I want to hear.",
        "Liam: Oh, I know what a lot of people want to hear. You're just the only one I care about enough to say it out loud.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You're pregnant? With Thomas' child? My beautiful wife... and my son... are having a baby. Thomas is not gonna be part of that life. He's not gonna be anywhere near that kid. It's our child now. Our secret. I didn't think I could give Caroline a baby, but you can't count me out, huh? Ridge Forrester, super stud.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, fighting back against those vasectomies and immobility.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I thought the swimmers retired, but they just needed to rest, you know? Once more unto the breach. And there they were. There's too much life in me. You should know that better than anybody. So, what do you say? Are you ready to congratulate me?",
        "Brooke: So, it's really your child.",
        "Ridge: Yes. And what are you saying? Think about it. What -- what are you accusing Caroline of?",
        "Brooke: Oh, no. No, no. I'm -- I'm not doing that. I'm not. I -- I know she's devoted to you. [Sighs] I know that by now, Ridge. It's just... it's a little confusing. I just want you to be happy. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: I am happy.",
        "Brooke: Good. So, this is it, right? This is... you're bringing another child into this world. [Chuckles, sniffles]",
        "Ridge: Yes, I am.",
        "Brooke: Well, there's only one thing I can do, or say. Congratulations. [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: Come here.",
        "Brooke: [Sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I definitely get it now.",
        "Ivy: Get what, exactly?",
        "Wyatt: Your reluctance to model...lingerie.",
        "Ivy: Oh!",
        "Wyatt: Okay? Pam was totally treating me like a piece of meat just now.",
        "Ivy: Well, of cour-- of course, she was. Of course, she was, babe. You're hot.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but... so were you at the photo shoot. Just, you don't -- you know, you don't want to get ogled.",
        "Ivy: Exactly. See? Oh, you do get it.",
        "Wyatt: I do.",
        "Ivy: Mm.",
        "Wyatt: And you are a great teacher. You know that?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: One of the many reasons why I love you. I said it. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Okay. Question. You really weren't upset with me?",
        "Steffy: Why would I be upset? Because you -- you told me that Caroline's pregnant?",
        "Liam: No, no, no. The -- the shutting down the photo shoot. Oh, shut up.",
        "Steffy: I was not upset about that. No, you did -- you did the right thing.",
        "Liam: I mean... VP going over the president's head...",
        "Steffy: I only outrank you at work. At home, we're equals. In our relationship, we're equals. You saw me acting out, so you rightfully reined me back in. That's what makes you such a strong man. You make me a better person.",
        "Liam: Just doin' my job, ma'am.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: Hey. Did you, uh, find Brooke? Because she knows.",
        "Ridge: Brooke found me.",
        "Caroline: Okay, well, what did you say? Did you convince her?",
        "Ridge: It wasn't easy, but yes, I did. She believed that's my baby.",
        "Caroline: Good. Good, 'cause I was really worried.",
        "Ridge: Why were you worried? I told you I'd handle it.",
        "Caroline: I know. You know me. I get, like, just -- I always go to worst-case scenario. She's gonna find out, and she's gonna tell Thomas, and --",
        "Ridge: No, no, stop stressing. You're stressing me out. You're stressing out my baby, our baby.",
        "Caroline: Ours.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, ours. You're still okay with that, right? We're on board? We're doing this together?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. We can do this, right? We can -- we can pull this off.",
        "Ridge: We have pulled it off. Brooke was the last hurdle. It's done. I convinced her, so now we just... no one can ever know the truth, especially Thomas. It's our secret. To the grave."
