        "Caroline slips home in a somber mood, picks up a picture of her and Rick but thinks back on the kiss with Ridge. Ridge also is thinking of the encounter when Katie comes in and catches him staring into space. She asks if they are through and that is why he is in this mood. Caroline must be very disappointed now. He says they created some beautiful designs together but she knew it had to end. Katie reminds him that he told her that Caroline had a crush on him and he was even thinking of using that to get the CEO position. He said that was only in passing and he would not have done that to her. She says good as she was concerned when he first told her. Ridge says he loves her, do not ever doubt that. She says she won't. He's honest and loyal and that is why she loves him. Maya slithers into Rick's office to find Carter there. He tells her he is sorry that Rick is not there as he knows that is who she came to see. And that he is probably home by now with his lovely wife as it should be. Maya declares that Caroline and Rick are not a super couple. Carter points out they have been married almost a year and they would be fine if everyone would give them their privacy. Maya mouths that Caroline is giving all her private time to Ridge nowadays. And what she saw would not be construed as work. Carter scolds her for eavesdropping and she denies it at first ad then admits okay she was snooping, but they were practically making out in the office. She says Ridge is not the saint that Carter thinks he is. Carter says maybe not but he's not stupid either. If Maya doesn't behave herself her career is in jeopardy. He's livid when he finds out that not only does Ivy know but she told Rick her suspicions as well. She is out to cause trouble and that is the truth. He tells her she is nothing but a gold digger. She's hurt and says he is mean-spirited. He says he likes her .she's beautiful and charming and has a lot to offer this world but her perspective is a little skewed. And now she is making a play for a married man. Just admit it, she is after Rick's money and a life of leisure. She barks that she still loves Rick and she could make him happier than Caroline ever could. So she will just wait until Caroline self destructs and she will have Rick again. Carter scoffs at her for thinking Caroline and Ridge, not a chance, it's ridiculous and dangerous.",
        "Rick does come home and almost has a heart attack that Caroline is there and not working around the clock with Ridge. She tells him they are finished. He apologizes and says he should have been more supportive but this CEO thing hanging over his head is a bit intense. But Ridge lost it all and could not design anymore and Caroline rescued him and gave him back his confidence. She hesitates then says she needs to tell him something about her and Ridge. She starts slowly with their work then finally blurts it out that his talent is coming back. Rick is delighted and says she must have had more of an influence on Ridge that he realized. He says if it is making her a better designer then he's all for it. She admits it was wonderful while it lasted, but it is over. She and Ridge have agreed their collaboration has to end and her focus now will be on Rick. He hugs her and says she is doing this for them and their life together. Ridge holds Katie and says Caroline helped him rediscover who he was and he will always be grateful to her for that. Katie slips out to take care of Will. Rick is in the shower so Caroline calls Ridge. She says they got caught up in something but it will never happen again. He says he knows. It is behind them now, forgotten. She says Rick must never find out. She's a little emotional ad teary-eyed when Ridge tells her goodbye."

        "Katie: Ridge? What are you doing?",
        "Carter: Sorry.",
        "Maya: For what?",
        "Carter: For not being Rick. I know that's who you were hoping to see.",
        "Maya: Do you know where he is?",
        "Carter: He's at home... with his wife.",
        "Rick: [Gasps] You're home! [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: And you're observant.",
        "Rick: What you got there? Oh. One of the better days of my life.",
        "Caroline: Me, too.",
        "Rick: You're early.",
        "Caroline: We're finished.",
        "Rick: Completely?",
        "Caroline: Yeah.",
        "Rick: I thought you and Ridge would be at it all night.",
        "Katie: Lost you there for a second.",
        "Ridge: I got a lot on my mind. I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I can imagine. Did you wrap things up with Caroline?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Katie: So, the two of you finished your final design?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: I see.",
        "Ridge: See what?",
        "Katie: Why you're in this mood. Caroline was upset, wasn't she, when you ended your collaboration?",
        "Maya: They are not a supercouple, carter.",
        "Carter: They've been married for, what, less than a year?",
        "Maya: All the more reason that it's not too late for them to reassess.",
        "Carter: They don't need to reassess. What they need is some privacy.",
        "Maya: [Scoffs] Tell that to Caroline! She's been giving all her private time away to Ridge these days.",
        "Carter: Maya, we're behind schedule. We need those designs. That's why they're working so much.",
        "Maya: [Scoffs] What I saw would not be construed as work.",
        "Carter: You're asking for trouble, Maya.",
        "Maya: What have I done? Nothing. Are you sure?",
        "Maya: I walk in on an intimate moment between Caroline and Ridge.",
        "Carter: You were eavesdropping!",
        "Maya: No, I wasn't!",
        "Carter: Maya.",
        "Maya: What difference does it make? So I was snooping a little bit. The point is they were practically making out!",
        "Carter: I'm sure that's an overstatement.",
        "Maya: Ridge is not the saint that you believe he is.",
        "Carter: He's no saint, but he's not stupid, Maya. You keep this up, you're gonna ruin your career.",
        "Maya: For telling the truth?",
        "Carter: Wait. Telling the truth? Maya, who exactly have you told?",
        "Maya: Well, Ivy knows.",
        "Carter: Anyone else? Maya?",
        "Maya: Rick.",
        "Carter: You -- Rick?! How -- how did he find out?",
        "Maya: You don't think he has the right to know?",
        "Carter: Maya, you are -- you are deliberately out to cause trouble!",
        "Maya: That's not fair!",
        "Carter: It's the truth. You're trying to break up their marriage so you can have Rick. Maya, you're nothing but a gold digger.",
        "Katie: So, how's Caroline taking it?",
        "Ridge: Well, she feels as I do -- it had to end.",
        "Katie: Must have been difficult.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. We created some beautiful designs together.",
        "Katie: Well, sure, but, I mean, difficult in other ways. You said yourself she has a crush on you. You were even thinking of using that crush to get the CEO position.",
        "Ridge: Well, that -- that was -- that was a passing thought. I wouldn't have done that to her.",
        "Katie: Good. Good. I'm glad to hear that, because I was concerned when you first told me.",
        "Ridge: Hey. I love you. Don't ever doubt that.",
        "Katie: I don't. I just didn't like the thought of you manipulating someone. I mean, that's not you. That's not the kind of man you are. You're honest and you're loyal, and that's why I love you.",
        "Rick: So... I have you to myself tonight? Thank you, Ridge!",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Rick: Let me guess -- he wanted you to stay, but you insisted on coming home.",
        "Caroline: No, no. He -- he knew that we both had to stop.",
        "Rick: Well, maybe there's hope for him yet.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] I really wish you two would get along.",
        "Rick: Well, until dad settles this whole CEO position, uh...",
        "Caroline: I know. I just -- it's silly because we're all family. You two squabbling over a title --",
        "Rick: A very important title. But you're right. You're right. I have been a little intense lately about the time that you spent with Ridge.",
        "Caroline: I have been spending too much time with him.",
        "Rick: You had to, Caroline. You guys were working on the couture collection.",
        "Caroline: I-I am so sorry.",
        "Rick: For what?",
        "Caroline: For --",
        "Rick: For saving the entire line?!",
        "Caroline: For being distracted, putting my attention elsewhere.",
        "Rick: I get that now. You and Ridge -- you two are artists. You were creating.",
        "Caroline: It was. It was amazing. It affected me in ways I never could have imagined. But... it also took my time away from you.",
        "Rick: I blame myself for that.",
        "Caroline: Why?",
        "Rick: I should have been more supportive. Ridge lost it all. He lost his ability to draw, his confidence. And then there you were. You came to the rescue. I mean, what would the guy have done if you hadn't helped him? But I still couldn't get past my own ego.",
        "Caroline: Rick... there's something I need to tell you.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Caroline: It's about Ridge and me.",
        "Maya: Will you stop with this? I am not a gold digger! Do I want a better life? Who wouldn't?! But it's not Rick's money that I'm after. I happen to love him.",
        "Carter: You loved me, too. It's just that my pockets weren't deep enough. All I'm saying -- it's good to know who you are, what you are.",
        "Maya: You can really be mean-spirited.",
        "Carter: [Sighs] I care about you, Maya, okay? You're beautiful. You're charming. You -- you have so much to offer this world.",
        "Maya: But I'm a greedy gold digger?",
        "Carter: Your perspective's a little skewed.",
        "Maya: Oh, that's so much more flattering.",
        "Carter: You're king a play for a married man.",
        "Maya: Whose wife is not --",
        "Carter: Is loyal! Caroline is loyal!",
        "Maya: Carrying on behind Rick's back? That's a strange definition of \"loyalty.\"",
        "Carter: Were they making love? Were they even kissing? No. You saw a friendly embrace.",
        "Maya: It was more than friendly.",
        "Carter: So back off. Let them work it out. If there's a problem, then they'll break up. Then go after the guy.",
        "Maya: I don't want to wait.",
        "Carter: Why?",
        "Maya: Because this is my opportunity, carter.",
        "Carter: For a lifetime of leisure. Admit it, Maya -- you're in love with Rick's money.",
        "Rick: Caroline, what is it?",
        "Caroline: Ridge and I had been working so well together --",
        "Rick: And I've been seeing it firsthand, although I do have my notes. The designs that have been coming my way are -- they're incredible. They really are.",
        "Caroline: He's -- he's taught me so much -- I mean, a whole new way of looking at everything, and I've never worked that closely with such talent before. It's just a very unique experience.",
        "Rick: I support you as a growing artist. The work that you guys have been doing -- it's amazing, although I know that most of it is you because he can't exactly design.",
        "Caroline: Ridge's -- Ridge's talent is coming back.",
        "Rick: Are you sure about that? Well, it seems you've had a much bigger impact on him than I thought.",
        "Caroline: More than I realized. And he's had one on me.",
        "Rick: I'm just gonna put this out there. If it's working for you and if it's making you a better designer, I am all for that now.",
        "Caroline: It is. But it's -- it's time for me to refocus.",
        "Rick: Refocus?",
        "Caroline: On -- on you, our marriage. The collection is finished, and... Ridge and I have agreed to end our collaboration.",
        "Rick: You have?",
        "Caroline: It was wonderful while it lasted, but it's taking my time away from you.",
        "Rick: Are you sure that you're okay with this?",
        "Caroline: It's necessary, Rick. I don't want to go any further with Ridge.",
        "Rick: You're doing this for me, for our life together.",
        "Katie: So, how did you leave things with Caroline?",
        "Ridge: Hmm? What do you -- what do you mean?",
        "Katie: Well, did you talk? Did you discuss her feelings for you?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, we talked. Sure.",
        "Katie: How serious was it?",
        "Ridge: Come on. It's -- it's over now. It's in the past.",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm not so sure. I mean, I had a crush on you for years, and I certainly couldn't forget about it.",
        "Ridge: Well, thank you. Thanks for not getting me out of your system. Thank you.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Hopefully, it's easier for Caroline.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. I mean, she's got a husband that loves her, and -- what did I just say? It's over. It's done -- finished.",
        "Katie: Were you gentle?",
        "Ridge: I would never want to hurt her. She helped me rediscover what makes me who I am. And I will always be grateful for that, so...",
        "Katie: Well, I'm grateful, too. And I'm sure Caroline's grateful for the time that she had with you. I'm sure she'll never forget it. It was the perfect collaboration. You both got a lot of out of it.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, we did.",
        "Katie: And it was the right time to end it... before she developed real feelings for you.",
        "Ridge: My beautiful fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Katie: I have to admit... I was a-a little bit jealous -- just a little bit -- for a minute.",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: I would never want to hurt you, Katie.",
        "Katie: I know. And I guess I'm lucky, too, 'cause I have you in my life.",
        "Ridge: I'm the lucky one. It's funny, isn't it -- how things happen? Some silly accident, falling out of a helicopter... recovering. You were there the whole time for me. And Caroline helped me, and I'm -- I'm not the man I was. But I love you. That's never gonna change. It won't.",
        "Maya: Why do you insist on thinking the worst of me?",
        "Carter: Because that's what you show me, Maya. Are you evil? No. Misguided? Most definitely.",
        "Maya: You don't think I'm capable of loving this man?",
        "Carter: Of course you are, when you're not obsessed with his bank account.",
        "Maya: Rick's bank account is not what I'm obsessed with!",
        "Carter: Okay -- his name, his reputation.",
        "Maya: And what's wrong with wanting a man with a name?",
        "Carter: I would hope that you want a man because you love him.",
        "Maya: I do love Rick. And there was a time when he loved me, too.",
        "Carter: And now he's with Caroline. I know it's hard to accept, but --",
        "Maya: He's with the wrong person. I can make him happier than Caroline ever will.",
        "Carter: Rick doesn't want you. Keep pestering him, Maya, and you'll end up back on the street. You remember what it's like back there?",
        "Maya: Of course I do, only too well! Why do you think I want Rick -- his life, this life? And I will have it, carter. This is my chance. I'm just waiting for Caroline to self-destruct, if she hasn't already.",
        "Carter: With Ridge? Maya! Do you honestly believe that Caroline would give up a husband she adores for a man who's engaged? I mean, come on! You got to stop this! Maya, this gossip you're stirring up -- it's not only dangerous, it's ridiculous! Ridge and Caroline? [Scoffs] There's not a chance.",
        "Katie: I love you.",
        "Ridge: I love you.",
        "Katie: Mm.",
        "[Will crying]",
        "Katie: [Groans]",
        "Ridge: [Groans]",
        "Katie: [Laughs] I'll go check on the boy.",
        "[Will babbling]",
        "[Water running in distance]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: Hi.",
        "Caroline: Hi.",
        "Ridge: You okay?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. I, um... I just wanted to call.",
        "Ridge: Where are you?",
        "Caroline: Home. Uh, Rick's in the shower. Uh, you?",
        "Ridge: I'm home. Katie stepped out.",
        "Caroline: Look... we got caught up in something.",
        "Ridge: Caroline --",
        "Caroline: No, it'll never happen again, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: I know. I know.",
        "Caroline: Rick can never find out.",
        "Ridge: It's all behind us now.",
        "Caroline: Right. It's behind us.",
        "Ridge: It's all forgotten.",
        "Caroline: Is it?",
        "Ridge: Has to be. Goodbye, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: [Voice breaking] Bye, Ridge.",
