        "Caroline looks at the sketches and is pleased but she can not stop thinking about Ridge guiding her hand and the kiss. Rick walks in and says his dad has made his decision on who will be CEO, him or Ridge. Maya speaks with Carter and says today is the day. She is sure Rick will win the job he has always wanted, being CEO. She is sure that Caroline and Ridge are involved and this will not bode well with him. Eric is distracted while talking to Hope but he says he has made his decision ..one will be very happy and the other disappointed. That comes with the territory of being in a family business. She agrees they need to get out there and precede any gossip to the press. Maya tells Carter that what she saw was not blown out of proposition and Rick will understand that when he hears. She tells Carter that she really wanted to marry him and it was not about money or bling that she wanted Rick. She had just ignored her heart for a while and the closer she got to her wedding date with Carter she knew she could not go through with it. Caroline tells Rick that he can always count on her. Her feet are firmly planted on the ground by his side and no one can change that. Katie feels all things are going well. Ridge will be named CEO and she will be by his side. Curiously she asks if Rick knows that Caroline has had a crush on Ridge. He's a very perceptive guy so he might have picked up on that. Ridge says that is in the past so there is nothing for him to pick up on.",
        "Hope tells Eric whatever decision he has made will be the right one. Eric tells Ivy that he hopes whichever son he doesn't pick will take it well. But they have not always gotten along so this might just add fuel to the fire. Maya can't wait to tell Carter that Caroline and Ridge have ended their collaboration. She thinks they are now running from each other. Sometimes emotional affairs are worse than physical ones. Caroline is making a fool of Rick and she is not going to let her get away with it. Carter tells her she is the one making a fool of herself. He can see that fevered little brain of hers working overtime. She says she knows what she saw and Rick and Katie deserve to know even if she has to call Caroline out in the meeting. Ridge spies Caroline kissing Rick. Rick says he has heard that Ridge's drawing skills have come back and things will be back to normal around here once Rick is CEO. Donna drops by on Katie and asks if she is nervous. After all, it will mean her seeing less of Ridge when he is CEO. Maya catches Rick and tells him big day and she is definitely Team Rick. Caroline walks up and Maya asks Caroline if she is Team Rick or Ridge, whatever he is to her. Eric conducts the meeting and says he is not going away, just stepping down and taking his brother's advice to get out and see the world. He will leave the company in their good hands and one of his sons will lead the company as CEO. He praises Ridge first as the best designer in the world and helped by Caroline. But Caroline's partner is her real life husband, Rick, and he's had international experience and he is very proud of him, he is proud of them both. Both of them are highly qualified and both gifted but one of them is going to be deeply disappointed. But he wants to see them as partners and brothers. He will have it no other way. The new CEO of Forrester is ."

        "Rick: Hey!",
        "Caroline: There's my handsome hubby.",
        "Rick: Today is the day that everything changes. I just heard from my dad. He's made his decision.",
        "Caroline: The CEO position?",
        "Rick: Will it be me... or will it be Ridge?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Big day. In a few hours, you will take your rightful place as CEO of Forrester Creations.",
        "Ridge: I love your confidence.",
        "Katie: Well, I know what my man has to offer. You are the complete package. You have honed your business skills, and now your ability to draw has come back.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Not a minute too soon, huh?",
        "Katie: This collaboration with Caroline was a good thing. And now you don't need it anymore. We can move on with our lives.",
        "Ridge: Right. Move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Someone's dying to know who Eric picked for CEO, huh?",
        "Maya: Isn't it obvious?",
        "Carter: Yeah, I guess it is.",
        "Maya: It's wonderful being able to watch Rick achieve his goals. He's wanted that position for a long time.",
        "Carter: [Laughs] Eric's picking Ridge.",
        "Maya: No -- Rick. He's a better businessman.",
        "Carter: Debatable, but even if I give you that, Ridge is a designer. Look, I know you'll be disappointed when Rick doesn't get the job, but I don't think you need to get involved, you know -- make Ridge look bad.",
        "Maya: If Ridge looks bad, it won't be my fault.",
        "Carter: You're thinking, aren't you? If Rick loses, you'll stir up some drama -- spin your ridiculous theories about Caroline and Ridge.",
        "Maya: You don't have to believe me, but I know that Ridge and Caroline are involved, now more than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: So, I spoke to Caroline. She said she and Ridge finished their collaboration, so Hope for the Future should have her back full-time.",
        "Eric: Good.",
        "Hope: Yeah. I want to start thinking about the summer line, maybe schedule a meeting. Eric?",
        "Eric: Hope, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Hope: I'm sure that you've made the right decision.",
        "Eric: Everyone will not think so. One of my sons is about to be very happy and the other one very disappointed. Downside of running a family business -- the choices you make for the company can hurt your kids.",
        "Hope: Comes with the territory. But we all understand that. I think that Ridge or Rick will be upset for a while, but he'll get over it.",
        "Eric: Look, after I announce, we're gonna need some kind of a strategy for the press. There's all kinds of rumors out there.",
        "Hope: Agreed. We have got to get ahead of them. Anytime we have a chance to preempt gossip, we need to take it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: It was not gossip. I saw it -- Ridge and Caroline clinging to each other.",
        "Carter: So, now they're clinging? You're taking an innocent expression of affection and you're blowing it up.",
        "Maya: What I saw was not innocent, and I'm glad I told Rick. At least now he won't be blindsided when he finds out that his wife is involved with Ridge.",
        "Carter: Wow. You never stop digging, do you?",
        "Maya: How could you be with me for so long and still call me a gold digger?",
        "Carter: By your actions now, not then. And that's where I get tripped up. Which is the real Maya? I guess it's the one I'm looking at.",
        "Maya: So, you won't take it back?",
        "Carter: No.",
        "Maya: Well, that makes me really sad. But I guess I'm getting a glimpse of how much I hurt you.",
        "Carter: If we weren't gonna work, it's best to know before making vows one of us couldn't keep.",
        "Maya: I really did want to marry you, Carter. It wasn't an act. I wasn't biding my time until I could get back with Rick. I know it doesn't look that way right now, but... the truth is my feelings for Rick surprised me, too. I thought I was over him and moving on with wonderful you.",
        "Carter: What changed?",
        "Maya: I guess I did. The closer we got to setting a wedding date -- I don't know -- I just started thinking about what I really wanted, and it wasn't the cash or the bling. I was ignoring my heart. And that wouldn't have been fair to either of us.",
        "Carter: That's cool.",
        "Maya: You weren't a mistake, Carter. And just because it ended doesn't mean it wasn't sweet for a while.",
        "Carter: It was sweet.",
        "Maya: Can you try to remember that when you're tempted to think the worst of me?",
        "Carter: What do you want from me, Maya?",
        "Maya: Be my friend.",
        "Carter: That's a tall order. This right here, right now -- it's -- it's the best I can do.",
        "Maya: I'm patient. I'll wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Sexy tie.",
        "Rick: Oh. You like?",
        "Caroline: Uh-huh.",
        "Rick: My wife gave it to me.",
        "Caroline: Oh! Well, she has good taste in ties and in husbands.",
        "Rick: Oh.",
        "Caroline: Mm.",
        "Rick: You know this is a real turning point for us.",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm. The younger son ascends.",
        "Rick: No, not just me -- we. We're in this together, just like Stephanie and my dad. You are still up for it, right?",
        "Caroline: Of course. [Chuckles] This is it, Rick. It's the beginning of living our dream.",
        "Rick: I told you. I told you we would run Forrester as a team.",
        "Caroline: I just -- I want you to know you never have to doubt it. You can always count on me.",
        "Rick: Why would I doubt?",
        "Caroline: Well, I'm so flighty and my head's always up in the clouds that I can barely feel my feet on the ground. But they are, Rick. They are firmly planted in the ground, right by your side. And nothing and no one could ever change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You know, I feel like our lives together are finally taking shape. You're gonna be CEO. Your talent is coming back. Caroline really came through for you.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. The collection wouldn't be here without her.",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't know about that. I mean, who's to say you wouldn't have had a breakthrough if you really had to?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Hey. I got this for you. Good-luck gift.",
        "Ridge: Thank you. Luck, huh?",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: You think I'm gonna need it?",
        "Katie: No. No, I don't. You're a designer, and Rick isn't. He's gonna have to deal with that. Do you think he knows that Caroline has a crush on you? Rick's a perceptive guy. He's very in tune to Caroline. Do you think that he picked up on her crush?",
        "Ridge: Hey... we created something together. It was exciting. It's nothing that he needs to pick up on, be told about, because the collaboration's over, and it's time to move on. Nothing to dwell on.",
        "Katie: That's right -- onward to bigger and better things.",
        "Ridge: That's the plan.",
        "Katie: That's what's going to happen, because I have faith in you. And so does Eric. He's gonna make the right choice, Mr. CEO.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: It's almost time. You ready?",
        "Eric: No.",
        "Hope: Whatever decision you have made, it's the right one.",
        "Eric: For the company, absolutely, but, uh, for the family...",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Hope: Sorry. I'm sorry. I have to take this.",
        "Eric: Mm. Okay.",
        "Ivy: Ah. Big day around here.",
        "Hope: Don't remind him.",
        "Ivy: How are you feeling? You all right? A lot of pressure, having to choose between two sons.",
        "Eric: I just hope the one I didn't pick takes it well.",
        "Ivy: It's a business decision. This is your responsibility.",
        "Eric: Ivy the practical.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: They've just never gotten along. This will just add fuel to the fire.",
        "Ivy: Eric, you are the fairest person I know. Whatever decision you make, that is the way forward.",
        "Eric: [Chuckling] Okay.",
        "Ivy: Aww. Okay. You ready?",
        "Eric: Yes, I'm ready, Ms. Forrester. Let's do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: So, friend... have you heard? The dream team split up. Ridge and Caroline ended their collaboration.",
        "Carter: They finished the collection. Don't make something out of nothing.",
        "Maya: You want to know what I think?",
        "Carter: Not particularly.",
        "Maya: They're running from the attraction.",
        "Carter: Maya, I-I'm really, really worried about you. This obsession you have with Rick and all things Forrester -- it's making you sound crazy. Ridge and Caroline hugged, okay? People hug.",
        "Maya: What I saw was not friendly. Caroline is cheating on Rick!",
        "Carter: So, now they're having an affair? Do you hear yourself?",
        "Maya: Well, if it's not a physical affair, then maybe it's an emotional affair. That counts, too. And sometimes that's more destructive. Either way, Caroline is making a fool of Rick, and I'm not gonna let her get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You've come to concede?",
        "Ridge: Well, that's the only way you're gonna get the job.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Caroline: Hi.",
        "Rick: Caroline tells me that your collaboration has ended.",
        "Ridge: The collection's finished, so, yeah, I'm gonna take over from here.",
        "Rick: Couture will be in good hands. My wife also tells me that your drawing skills are coming back.",
        "Ridge: Just in time.",
        "Rick: That's great timing, actually -- that you won't be needing my wife's help anymore, because I'll need her full support as soon as dad names me CEO.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: I see that fevered little brain of yours working away.",
        "Maya: I should just end it -- call Caroline out at the meeting.",
        "Carter: In front of everyone? Maya, you can't be serious.",
        "Maya: Why not?",
        "Carter: If you go into that meeting slinging accusations with absolutely no proof --",
        "Maya: I may not have proof, but I have instincts and eyes. I know what I saw. Ridge and Caroline are involved, and Rick and Katie deserve to know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm not gonna tell you what to do, little brother, but if you face the facts now, maybe you won't be crushed completely when dad hands the reins to me.",
        "Rick: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Ridge: Okay. You know, I always valued what you do as president. There's no reason we can't work together.",
        "Rick: Gee. That's, uh -- that's real big of you, Ridge. But I think you need to reverse that scenario, and you want to know why? Because I have Caroline. And you may have partnered with her briefly, but she's my partner for life. We're a team, just like dad and Stephanie. You know, that's what he wants. So, why don't you just save some face now and concede?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Katie: Hi!",
        "Donna: Hi! Looks like everybody's making decisions today, huh?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Well, when Will sleeps, I try to make progress on the guest bedroom. What's going on? Has Eric named a successor?",
        "Donna: Oh, no, no. Just started. Pam told me to take a long lunch -- probably has her ear pressed up against the door as we speak.",
        "Katie: Sounds about right.",
        "Donna: Are you nervous?",
        "Katie: A little. Mostly confident.",
        "Donna: Well, your life will change, too, if Eric picks Ridge. For starters, you're gonna see a lot less of him. If you think Caroline monopolized his time, just wait till you see what this job does.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Donna: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Ready to go?",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: I'm gonna chat with your sister. Good luck, okay?",
        "Rick: Thanks.",
        "Hope: ...Go over the knuckle. Hi.",
        "[Indistinct conversation]",
        "Maya: Important day, huh?",
        "Rick: [Sighs] Life-changing.",
        "Maya: Well, I just want you to know that I am 100% team Rick.",
        "Rick: I appreciate that.",
        "Maya: You're not only the best man for the job, but... you're the best man I've ever known.",
        "Rick: Maya.",
        "Maya: Just take the compliment, okay?",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Caroline: What are we thanking Muriel for?",
        "Rick: Well, Maya was just saying how much she supports us.",
        "Caroline: Hmm.",
        "Maya: Actually, I support Rick. And how 'bout you, Caroline? Who do you support, your husband or your -- what is Ridge to you exactly, anyway?",
        "Eric: All right. Everybody's here. Let's sit down, please. I want to start.",
        "Carter: Yes, sir.",
        "Eric: Thank you. Look, we all know why we're here. I'm about to announce the next CEO of Forrester Creations. It's a big transition. But we're a team. That's why I wanted everybody here. My brother, John, reminded me recently that life is balance. It can't be spent exclusively in an office, and I'm gonna subscribe to that. I'm gonna get out in the world. I'm gonna do something or nothing -- whatever appeals to me at the moment. But I'm not stepping down completely. I'll still be a presence here. I'll still be designing and mentoring and watching over you. But it's time to allow for the future of Forrester and to announce the CEO. Who's gonna take us there. And it's gonna be one of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I know what it's like to be CEO, and, yeah, it means that Ridge won't be around as much, but I've had a trial run.",
        "Donna: When Ridge was designing with Caroline?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Donna: What?",
        "Katie: I-I wasn't gonna say anything.",
        "Donna: Tell me.",
        "Katie: Well, when they were working so closely together, something happened.",
        "Donna: Happened happened?",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. No. Caroline developed a bit of a crush.",
        "Donna: Oh. Is it serious?",
        "Katie: Apparently moderate to mild. Anyway, Ridge talked to her, and whatever feelings she had ended with their collaboration, and Rick doesn't know about it. Thankfully, he doesn't have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: This has not been an easy decision for me. I sought input from a lot of different people in this building and even outside the building, and from some of you. I appreciate the input and your opinions. This is my company. It's my choice. You have given this company your talents and your dedication -- whatever we needed -- for years and years. Your eye for design is impeccable. It's unrivaled. I think you're the best designer in the world... as proven by your recent collaboration with Caroline. But Caroline's real partner in this world is her husband, Rick. Rick, you've grown by leaps and bounds. Your tenure at International -- while you were there, you learned how to run a business, and you brought all that expertise back to Forrester. We benefited from that. Thanks. Thanks very much. And you had the great good sense and the great good luck to marry a wonderful, wonderful woman who complements you on every level. I'm proud of you, son. I'm proud of you, son. That's why this is so difficult. You're both highly qualified. You're both gifted. The thing that makes this so agonizing is that one of you is gonna be deeply, deeply disappointed. But in spite of that, I'm gonna make certain that the two of you rise to the occasion and that you function as partners and as brothers. I won't have it any other way. Now, having said that, the new CEO of Forrester Creations is..."
