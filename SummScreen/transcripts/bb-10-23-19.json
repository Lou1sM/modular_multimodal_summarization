    "Recap": [
        "Steffy's at work and Ridge shows her Thomas's designs. She thinks not bad. He says a compliment from her would mean the world to Thomas. She says she cannot just forgive him like that for what he did. He says the same old; they are family and it is not easy but necessary. She says Thomas uses people and he uses his own son too. He says he is happy to see her working but it should be with her brother too. She tells him that Hope was way out of line and she has no business dictating who will raise Douglas. She's not even blood kin. He tells her he moved out of Brooke's so he could be closer to her and to Thomas. She reminds him not to wreck his marriage. He says he knows he and Brooke are on opposite sides of the fence. She says and if Brooke talks Thomas into letting go of Douglas then there are going to be many more rough days ahead. Thomas tells Brooke that she wants him to give away his son; he is not going to sign over his son. Hope wants to talk to Thomas alone. Brooke does not agree but gives in and says she will be right up the hill. Liam is not happy to hear that Hope is alone with Thomas. Brooke tells Liam that he needs to speak up if there is any chance they can get Douglas. Thomas tells Hope that hurting her is the biggest regret of his life. He's not used to rejection and it threw him a little when he knew she did not want him. He was too stubborn to admit it and he was ashamed. And letting Douglas stay with her does not mean he does not love his son. He would only sign those papers for Hope. He lost his way but he has been trying to better himself. If he cannot have that life with Hope then maybe Douglas still can. She reminds him that he wanted her to be Douglas's mother. So she begs him to sign the papers and let her and Liam have him permanently. She just wants to give him all the love and support that he wanted. If Thomas wants to make up to her for what he did then sign these papers.",
        "Liam is not against Douglas; he likes the little boy a lot. Brooke says this is the way it has to be. Thomas could snap at any time. Hope continues to beg, she loves Douglas and she can be his mother. That is what she wants. Thomas says he made decisions that he cannot justify but he never meant to hurt her or Douglas. She says Douglas needs this security and only Thomas can make that happen. He says he is confused. He needs to think. She sees this as a good sign and tells him to think seriously. He zooms in on her lips, then her eyes and how she drives him insane and gets to him. Hope is still talking about him signing the adoption papers and he says he will seriously consider it. He opines for what it is worth he lays awake at night thinking of the things he did wrong. He is sorry for what he did to her and he will spend the rest of his life proving how much he cares about her and can win her trust. They both look at each other like they have different agendas in mind."

        "Steffy: These aren't bad, actually.",
        "Ridge: Well. Positive critique of your brother's work. It's a start.",
        "Steffy: He's oddly talented when he wants to be.",
        "Ridge: He gets the oddly part from me. I'm glad you can keep this professional after everything that he's put you through. I'm thinking of working on this hemline a little bit, though, right? Maybe keep it, uh, asymmetrical. That do you think?",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm. That could work.",
        "Ridge: You know, a compliment from you would mean the world to Thomas. Give him a call, maybe?",
        "Steffy: Mm, yeah, I don't think so.",
        "Ridge: Come on, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: I know you want to bring the family back together, but Thomas betrayed me. I can't just forgive and forget.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Thomas, this is your chance to at least begin to repair the damage that you've caused. Do the right thing for a change.",
        "Thomas: You want me to give away my son.",
        "Brooke: We want you to do what's best for Douglas. You're not emotionally equipped to raise that little boy, so why don't you let somebody who is give him the life that he deserves?",
        "Thomas: I'm not gonna sign over my kid.",
        "Hope: Mom, can you give us a moment?",
        "Brooke: I don't think that's a good idea, sweetheart.",
        "Hope: I really think I should talk to Thomas alone. And besides, this is between him and me. Mom, please. It's okay.",
        "Brooke: Okay. I'll be right up at the house if you need me.",
        "Thomas: Wait. Before you say anything... I just want you to know... hurting you... is the biggest regret of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You can't give up on family. We got to forgive each other.",
        "Steffy: You say it like it's easy.",
        "Ridge: No, I'm not-- I don't mean that at all. I know it's not easy, but it's necessary, not for just Thomas, but for you. He's your brother.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, exactly, and where was Thomas? Where was sibling loyalty when he kept the secret about Beth from me?",
        "Ridge: He knows he was wrong.",
        "Steffy: He didn't just hurt me, Dad. He hurt Hope. He hurt Liam. He hurt Kelly. Beth was taken from the only home she's ever known, and I was left with a hole in my heart where Phoebe used to be. And that doesn't even take into account the way Thomas used his own son.",
        "Ridge: Thomas made a lot of mistakes, but one thing I know for sure. He loves his little boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: No, no, no, no. No.",
        "[ Video game sounds ]",
        "Douglas: Score! Win!",
        "Liam: This is not fair. You know, when I was your age, these things had actual, like, buttons we could physically press.",
        "[ Chuckles ]",
        "Douglas: I'm the champ.",
        "Liam: I know you're the champ. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.",
        "Douglas: I like being here.",
        "Liam: Oh, I like having you here, too, pal.",
        "Douglas: Is Dad still here?",
        "Brooke: Your dad is down at the cabin talking to Mommy Hope.",
        "Liam: Uh, you left them alone?",
        "Brooke: It's what she wanted.",
        "Douglas: Shall I go see him?",
        "Brooke: Not just yet, sweetie. Your dad and Hope are talking about some very important plans for the future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I know how it sounds, um, but I'm not used to rejection. And it threw me a little knowing that you didn't want me. But I knew. On some level I just... I was... too stubborn and proud to admit it. I'm ashamed. But look, I need to make one thing absolutely clear. Me letting Douglas stay here with you, that does not mean I don't love him. I love that kid with everything I've got.",
        "Hope: So what are you getting at?",
        "Thomas: If I were to ever sign adoption papers, it would be for one reason and one reason only. You. I might sign them for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: This looks fantastic. And do we have a time frame when this campaign will launch?",
        "Monica: We're still strategizing on the exact date because we want to coordinate for both social and print.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Well, I really want to push this on our digital platforms.",
        "Monica: For sure. Prior to launch, we'll release some BTS posts to hype it up, too.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Monica: And we're working on those now.",
        "Steffy: It's great. Thank you, Monica. And we really appreciate you stepping up while Katie's recovering.",
        "Monica: I'm honored for the opportunity.",
        "Steffy: I checked in with her earlier on today, and it seems like she's getting stronger. And she's really thankful for all that you're doing.",
        "Monica: Well, I'll work on these notes. Thanks, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Thank you. What?",
        "Ridge: I just never get tired of watching you work. That's why I hired you here. It's why Grandpa wanted you, Grandma wanted you working here with your brother. You guys were really close. You miss him?",
        "Steffy: I miss Phoebe.",
        "Ridge: He needs your forgiveness right now.",
        "Steffy: No, no.",
        "Ridge: He needs your forgiveness, and he needs your strength.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Not to be--",
        "Steffy: Okay. Don't you see? His betrayal was so hard for me because Thomas and I were so close. He knew Beth was Phoebe. He knew that she was Hope's daughter, not mine, and instead of preparing me, giving me time to say goodbye, he allowed Beth to be ripped from my arms. Like, how am I supposed to forgive him?",
        "Ridge: I don't know how. We have to find a way. I'm here. We're family. He went about this completely the wrong way, but he was trying to create an instant family for Douglas 'cause he lost his mom. But he's trying to get better, and maybe you could find a way to support that?",
        "Steffy: He's been texting me. I know he's trying to make things right.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Let him try. He's still your big brother, and he's still the guy who wants to raise his own kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Brooke's not having it. She wants Hope and Liam to raise Douglas.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, she made that very clear.",
        "Steffy: She is way out of line. She's in no position to dictate who raises Douglas.",
        "Douglas: Daddy and Hope are making plans?",
        "Brooke: Exciting ones.",
        "Douglas: Then what kind of plans?",
        "Liam: Uh, well, um, uh, you know what? You're gonna find out soon enough, but right now, I actually need you to get ready 'cause Andy's mom is gonna come pick you up, so do you want to get your bag together downstairs?",
        "Douglas: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: You're a good boy, Douglas. You're always gonna be surrounded by people who love you.",
        "Liam: [ Sighs ] So, uh, you weren't gonna tell him, huh?",
        "Brooke: No, of course not. We don't want to confuse him or get his hopes up for nothing. Besides, it's not really my place. If he is going to be adopted, you and Hope need to say something, or Thomas.",
        "Liam: Good. Right. Yeah. So Thomas and Hope are just... alone down there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: This is nice. [ Chuckles ] Just the two of us having a civil conversation. It's been a long time.",
        "Hope: It has.",
        "Thomas: It's my fault. I know that. I just... look, I'm not making any excuses, but everything I did I did for my son.",
        "Hope: Well, I mean, there is a way to try and move past it for Douglas' sake.",
        "Thomas: That's what I want. I want to do everything for Douglas. It's what I've been trying to do. Look, losing Caroline was a huge blow to all of us, and it was a blow we didn't expect, and... I--I had to come up with a new plan, okay? And that plan was you-- creating this family with you and Douglas-- and that's the family I thought that he needed. Look, back then, I had this vision of myself as this good, honest person, and I think I was at one point, but then, somewhere along the way, I--I lost my way, and... look, I'm telling-- telling you. I've been trying to better myself, okay? That-- that's what I've been working on.",
        "Hope: Well, I'm really glad to hear that.",
        "Thomas: It's a start, right? If, um... if I can't have that life with you that I wanted, well, maybe Douglas still can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: There is a little tension between Brooke and me.",
        "Steffy: She doesn't get to decide who raises Douglas. She's not even blood. Is the friction between you two the real reason you moved out?",
        "Ridge: I moved out because I wanted to be present for Thomas and for you. Once we've figured all this out, I'm gonna move back in with my wife.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. For your sake, I--I hope it's that easy.",
        "Ridge: What do you mean?",
        "Steffy: It just seems that you and Brooke are on this collision course that could really affect your marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You know, they-- they really shouldn't be alone down there.",
        "Brooke: Hope insisted I let them talk, just the two of them.",
        "Liam: Uh, well, yeah, but, uh, like, did you object?",
        "Brooke: Well, I did say it wasn't a very good idea.",
        "Liam: You were absolutely right. What is she thinking?",
        "Brooke: I was trying to be calm and reasonable, but Thomas is well aware of my feelings for him, so Hope thought she could appeal to Thomas better than I could. Once you and Hope have legal rights to Douglas, it'll be much better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I want what's best for Douglas.",
        "Thomas: I believe you do. But what about Brooke? I mean, does she actually care about Douglas, or is this just payback for--for what I put you through?",
        "Hope: My mother's name isn't on those adoption papers. Mine is. And you wanted me to be a mother to Douglas, remember?",
        "Thomas: Of course I remember. I remember everything. Every word that we shared, uh, it's seared into my memory. It's been hard, Hope, not being with my son. But for the first time since Caroline died... he genuinely seems happy, and that's because of you. He needs a mother, and that's a role I can't fill.",
        "Hope: I... I know this is asking a lot of you. But I have come to love Douglas as if he were my own. So please just let him stay permanently with me and Liam, the family that he has grown to be a part of.",
        "Thomas: I would do anything for you, Hope. I think I--I proved that but in all the wrong ways.",
        "Hope: Yeah, you caused a lot of heartbreak.",
        "Thomas: For you especially.",
        "Hope: And Douglas, too.",
        "Thomas: I never meant to hurt my son.",
        "Hope: Do you trust me?",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Enough to know what's in his best interests? 'Cause that is all I care about. I just want to give him all the love and support and attention he needs to be his best self, so please just... please just let me do that... like you wanted. And if you want to make up for what happened, then do something good for him. Put Douglas' needs first and sign these papers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: No, I admit it's been challenging with Brooke. We're on different sides of the fence when it comes to Thomas. I think he's doing better, and she thinks he's irredeemable, and... I don't know what to do about it. Maybe a little distance will be good for all of us. And, um... I could use your help, too.",
        "Steffy: Mm-mm. I doubt it. Brooke doesn't even listen to me.",
        "Ridge: That's not what I want. I want you to listen to Thomas.",
        "Steffy: Wow. You are persistent.",
        "Ridge: Just listen to him. He wants to apologize. Let him do it.",
        "Steffy: And what about you and Brooke? If she expects Thomas to let Hope and Liam raise Douglas indefinitely, there's a lot more rough road ahead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I love Douglas. There's no question about that. He's an exceptional kid. He's smart and brave and kind and funny, and he--he brought Beth back to us.",
        "Brooke: He's thriving under your care.",
        "Liam: That's what I'm saying. That--that doesn't have to change. I mean, Thomas is basically going along with the living conditions so far.",
        "Thomas: Thomas is erratic and unpredictable. That's exactly why Douglas needs to live with you and Hope.",
        "Liam: But he is. He is living with us. That's--that's kind of my point. So when you, you know, took out the adoption papers and threw them down and demanded Thomas sign, it kind of threw me because, if we rush into this...",
        "Brooke: Liam, this is the way it needs to be. Thomas is dangerous. He could snap at any minute over god knows what. Douglas needs to be protected. And the four of you are living together already. You're a sweet little family-- you and Hope and Douglas and Beth. Now you just need to make it legal. And with any luck, that is what Hope is doing right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You made a promise to Douglas after Caroline died that I would be like a new mother to him.",
        "Thomas: That's how it was supposed to be-- you, me, Douglas, this happy family.",
        "Hope: Only it didn't work out that way, except for the fact that I did grow to love Douglas as if he were my own son, and that is what you wanted. Like you said, he needs a mother, and I can be that to him. I am that to him, and I will be if you let me. I think you know deep down that this is where he belongs, where he is happy and safe, and he's like a big brother to Beth, and, if you want to make up for the harm that you caused Douglas and me, then...",
        "Thomas: That--that--that-- that is what I want. Okay, look, I made decisions I can't justify, but I never meant to hurt you or Douglas.",
        "Hope: Prove it. Sign the papers. Let me take care of him. Let me nurture him because at this point I need to know that he's safe with me, that he's mine, that he's not just gonna be ripped away, and Douglas needs that security, too, and you have the power to give that to him.",
        "Thomas: What you're asking for is huge. I love my son. I want to do what's best for him. Having you as a mother-- obviously I know that you'd be a great mother. I just--I don't know-- I'm not saying that that's not best for him. I... I just... I need to think, okay?",
        "Hope: So Y... you'll consider it? I mean, you'll seriously... consider letting me adopt him? I know that this is the hardest decision you will ever have to make.",
        "Thomas: Your mother destroyed my family.",
        "Hope: And I am...",
        "Thomas: You broke my heart.",
        "Hope: ...So, so, sorry...",
        "Thomas: Twice.",
        "Hope: ...It's come to this.",
        "Thomas: I was done with all the Logan women. I would have been happy to never see any of you again.",
        "Hope: ...Stability and the love...",
        "Thomas: But being here with you...",
        "Hope: ...With Liam and me...",
        "Thomas: ...Like this, looking in your beautiful eyes.",
        "Hope: ...Consistency...",
        "Thomas: Hearing your sweet voice being gentle... needing something from me. I just want to kiss you. You drive me insane. How--how do you always get to me?",
        "Hope: Will you, Thomas?",
        "Thomas: What? What?",
        "Hope: Will you take what I'm saying to heart and seriously consider signing the adoption papers?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. I will, um... I will seriously consider... you adopting my son.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Thomas: For what it's worth, I stay awake nights thinking through all the things that I did wrong. I mean, how hard would it have been to just-- to just do the right thing, you know? And--and even... even if you had left me... you'd still respect me. I'm sorry, Hope. I am so sorry for what I did to you, okay? And I will spend the rest of my life proving to you how much I regret it, how much I regret what I did, okay? And showing you that I care about you, how much I will always care about you."
