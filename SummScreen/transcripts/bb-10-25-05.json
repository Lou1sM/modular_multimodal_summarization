        "Thorne: You're saying good-bye?",
        "Ridge: You're leaving L.A. For good?",
        "Thorne: You can't be serious.",
        "Stephanie: I'm going to sell the house. I'm going to move to Florida.",
        "Eric: Florida?",
        "Stephanie: Yes. We have old college friends from -- live down there. My father's estate is just outside of Boca Raton. It's been rented for years, but it just became available again. I'd say that's rather propitious, wouldn't you?",
        "Ridge: Oh, come on, mother, you're not going anywhere. This is crazy.",
        "Stephanie: No, it isn't. It's the sanest thing I've done in years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Intern #1: How much longer?",
        "Intern #2: I've got a stack of in-take charts to finish tonight.",
        "Intern #3: He said he'd be right back.",
        "Intern #4: Which means whenever he damn well pleases.",
        "Intern #2: Face it, the guy loves torturing us.",
        "Intern #5: We're interns. Torture's part of the territory. Right, Forrester?",
        "Bridget: I'm sorry, what?",
        "Intern #4: Hey, let's take a quick five. Grab some java before dr. Killjoy gets back.",
        "Intern #2: Let's go.",
        "Intern #3: Hey, coming, Bridget?",
        "Bridget: I'm just gonna study my notes a little longer, but thanks.",
        "Orderly: Dropping like flies tonight. Sorry, lame joke.",
        "Bridget: \"Dying to be with you.\" Well, let's see. What do you know? The next procedure is a vasectomy. Hmm. Good thing the scalpel's nice and sharp. Not that he would feel anything since he's already dead. [ Bridget gasps ] Oh, my gosh.",
        "Dante: You see something you like?",
        "Bridget: Dante!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: You're not an impulsive person, Mother.",
        "Stephanie: I don't think that this is an impulsive decision. Honey, I've got a lot of regrets. The first of many was you ever leaving Forrester in the first place.",
        "Massimo: Stephanie, look, we all have regrets. But to do something this extreme.",
        "Stephanie: Mass, timing is everything in life. The second is knowing when to quit.",
        "Darla: Stephanie, is this because of what happened with Bridget?",
        "Stephanie: No, I don't have any regrets about telling Bridget the truth about her mother and her husband. I don't care how painful it is for her. No one deserves to be lied to like that, and I will never understand why you, both of you, never saw that. But you see, that's the problem. That's part of the problem. Every time I try to guide my family, you all think of it as interfering and controlling. So I've just -- I just realized, you know, whatever's going to happen is going to happen. I still believe something, though, that my parents instilled in me. An unprincipled life is an empty life. And therein lies the rub. My thinking seems to cause a lot of conflict in the family, and I don't want that. I don't want any more conflict with the people that I love.",
        "Taylor: Or with yourself.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I just -- I just want what I've always wanted. What's -- what's best for this family.",
        "Eric: Even now that Brooke's a part of it?",
        "Thorne: Dad --",
        "Stephanie: That's all right, Thorne. It always comes back to Brooke. I know when to call it quits.",
        "Ridge: Why, because Brooke won and you lost? So you're running off to Florida. Stephanie Forrester -- a quitter. Never thought I'd see the day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: All right, maybe if I raise the hemline a little bit. Huh-uh. Hm-mmm. Mmm. All right, here, wait, take this off. All right. No. No, no! Damn it, this is still all wrong.",
        "Gaby: Hey, babe, you've been at this nonstop. Okay, maybe you should take a break.",
        "Thomas: And wait for inspiration to strike? Yeah, like that's gonna happen.",
        "Gaby: Hey, you're putting too much pressure on yourself, okay? Look at me.",
        "Thomas: If we tank, not only will Spectra lose big, but you could be deported. And I can't let that happen. But I'll be damned if I know what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Shouldn't you be getting ready for your first fashion show tomorrow?",
        "Dante: You're more important than any fashion show.",
        "Bridget: Oh, Dante -- you're sweet. You're a very sweet man. But the last person you want to get involved with is me. Especially right now. My life is just such a mess. My father just remarried my mother to try to give me a little more reassurance. And it's not helping anything. Nick is still in love with my mother. Which is exactly why --",
        "Dante: Why what?",
        "Bridget: I know that I'm better off, obviously, and I deserve so much better than the way I was treated, but you know, it's like that fool's paradise that Stephanie said she was trying to save me from, it just -- it just doesn't look so bad right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I'm leaving because it's a much needed change.",
        "Darla: Couldn't you make that change here?",
        "Thorne: Of course she can. We're here for you, mother. Let your family be here for you.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, honey, if I stay, something will happen. And I just won't be able to walk away from it. My brand of truth has always been very challenging. It's served the family well for a long time, but believe me, not without a price.",
        "Thorne: But you did what you thought was right.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, but I've come to understand -- I've come to realize at what cost. To me and to our family. I don't want to be that way anymore. I don't want my life to be about that anymore.",
        "Ridge: So you go thousands of miles away?",
        "Sally: Your family is your world, highness.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, Sally, but I've become so consumed with trying to protect everyone, that I just -- I've lost my perspective.",
        "Taylor: Your mother needs to make a life of her own, and not live through her children.",
        "Stephanie: I can't do that, not the way things have turned out. I cannot, in all honesty, welcome Eric's wife into the family. And I cannot go into the office day in and day out, and pass Brooke in the hall, or sit in a boardroom meeting with her, and deny that I -- and deny that I hurt. I can see where this family's going. I can see what's going to happen to the family and the company, and I know myself. I would not be able to keep my mouth shut. And that will only alienate the people that I love more. And I don't want that. That, Ridge, is why I'm leaving. As painful as it is, and believe me -- believe me, sweetheart, it's painful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dante: You don't really believe that, do you?",
        "Bridget: It certainly would make things more simple.",
        "Dante: Yeah, for now, maybe. But then, later it's gonna be all different.",
        "Bridget: I know.",
        "Dante: You know, I wish you could just let me take you away from all this, you know?",
        "Bridget: Before or after you go get dressed?",
        "Dante: No, I'm serious. I love you. And I will love this child like it was my own. Listen, we could have such a wonderful life together, me and you. And I could take you away from all this mess, you know?",
        "[ Pager beeping ]",
        "Bridget: Oh. I gotta go. Thank you -- thank you for being such a dear friend.",
        "Dante: I want to be more for you. If you'd just let me.",
        "Bridget: I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You do realize that mother wouldn't be leaving if you hadn't married Brooke?",
        "Eric: You're going to blame me for your mother's decision?",
        "Stephanie: Ridge, no more blaming. And no more recriminations. It doesn't change a thing. Believe me, I've learned that. Honey, it isn't as though we're not going to see each other. You'll come and visit me, I'll visit you. Sally, you'll come and see me, won't you?",
        "Sally: Your highness' every wish is my command. As long as it includes a free round trip ticket and a muscular cabana boy named Raul.",
        "Stephanie: The ticket is yours. [ Whispering ] The cabana boy I'll work on when I get to Boca Raton.",
        "Massimo: Are you sure that this is something you want to do?",
        "Stephanie: I'm sure that this is something that I have to do. I have to do it, mass. But knowing that you're here, and you'll keep an eye on Ridge, it'll be all right. Darla, as long as I know that you're here for Thorne and your beautiful baby. Thank you so much. Thank you for making him so happy.",
        "Darla: I love you, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: I love you, too, honey. And you, sweet boy. Don't ever think that you were second in my heart. I'm very proud to be your mother. A mother couldn't be blessed with two more wonderful boys.",
        "Ridge: You're really gonna do this, huh?",
        "Stephanie: Ridge, always remember what a miracle Taylor's return is. And treasure what you have.",
        "Ridge: Man, you just never give up, do you?",
        "Stephanie: Huh-uh.",
        "Ridge: I love you.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, honey, I love you. I just pushed you right into her arms, didn't I? I'll always love you. I'm going to miss you all. The whole bunch.",
        "Massimo: Don't give up. [ Massimo sighs ] You are not defeated. Hmm? Stephanie, Stephanie. Stephanie Forrester. Stephanie Douglas will rise from the ashes again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: It definitely looks better buttoned up. Maybe we should actually bring the back in a little bit.",
        "Gaby: He's been like this for days. He -- he doesn't eat and he doesn't sleep. All he can think about is if Spectra loses the challenge. And you know, rumor has it that his dad has a blockbuster line. And with Thomas' granddad remarrying Brooke, Forrester has all the momentum. Which, I'm sure, that you couldn't be more than pleased about.",
        "Taylor: You're wrong.",
        "Gaby: Come on. I'm sure this is the only time in your life that you want to see your son fail.",
        "Taylor: No, Gaby, that is not true.",
        "Gaby: Because then -- then, you'll be rid of me forever. Because that's what this is all about.",
        "Taylor: No, Gaby, I have told you many times before, that is not what this is about. This is about my son being married at too young of an age.",
        "Gaby: Right. And you won't be happy when they put me on a plane and take me to a country where I don't know anyone?",
        "Taylor: No. No, I wouldn't be happy.",
        "Gaby: Just do me a favor. Just don't lie to me.",
        "Taylor: I am not lying.",
        "Gaby: I don't believe you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Stephanie remembering ] Memories like the corners of my mind misty water colored memories of the way we were scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind smiles we gave to one another for the way we were can it be that it was all so simple then or has time rewritten every line if we had the chance to do it all again tell me would we",
        "Stephanie: I'll always love you. Could we",
        "Thorne: You really have to go?",
        "Stephanie: You came back.",
        "Thorne: You okay?",
        "Stephanie: I am now. I was just sitting here, thinking about all the wonderful things that we've done in this house.",
        "Thorne: Yeah. It's not too late to change your mind.",
        "Stephanie: You'll be fine without me.",
        "Thorne: Just know that no matter where you are, I will always love you, Mother. Never forget that.",
        "Stephanie: I won't. I couldn't. My sweet, baby boy."
