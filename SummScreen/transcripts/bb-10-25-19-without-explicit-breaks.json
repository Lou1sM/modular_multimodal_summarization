        "Ridge tells the group that he thought they were going to be civil about this and give Thomas time and support him until he gets back on his feet. Brooke counters with and who is going to care for his son while he does this. Thomas says he has been struggling ever since Caroline died but this is his son and he is not ready to give him up. He won't be signing the papers. Liam jumps in and tells Ridge to put the custody aside for now as this is where Douglas wants to be and feels safe. Ridge understands but says they are taking Douglas now. Brooke gets more forceful and says that Douglas is thriving here with Hope and Liam and NO one is going to take him away from that. They argue more but in the end Ridge points at Brooke and Hope and says they are not the parents, Thomas is and he is trying his best. He is getting help but refuses to say what when Brooke asks. Surely hanging out with Vinny is not helping matters. Ridge tells Hope that if Thomas needs help then he can call on her but he will be taking Douglas home with him. Ridge reminds her that this is much like when she got Beth back. She went into Steffy's house and took Beth. Ridge did not like that and Steffy did not like that either but she had every right to take her and now like Thomas deserves his son. Donna looks for Ridge but runs into Eric instead who informs her that Ridge will not be back today. He went to get Douglas to stay with Thomas. He hates what this is doing to Hope but after all Douglas is Thomas's son. Ridge tells Brooke that Thomas won't be doing this alone. Eric and Quinn have agreed to take in Thomas and Douglas. And Ridge is moving in too. There will be four generations of Forrester men under one roof, all trying to help Thomas heal. Hope gets a call that Douglas will be dropped off by the mother of one of his friends. Brooke rushes toward Thomas and tells him do not go to the cabin to get him. Thomas pulls back and reminds Brooke what happened the last time she pushed him. She and Ridge get into it again about the Forrester's. She knows he does not think of her as a Forrester despite that she is his wife. He thinks of her as a Logan. She can see it in his eyes and is channeling Stephanie now so he might as well say it and call her the slut from the valley and not worthy of raising a Forrester. Thomas does meet Douglas and both are happy to see each other. Thomas tells him the good news that they will be living together soon. Thomas says Hope and Liam have done a great job taking care of him but now it is time for Douglas to live with him. He is going to prove to him that he can trust him and he is not mad at him. Douglas hugs him and says he has missed him. Thomas says he was wrong to keep Beth's secret but he is going to be the daddy now that Douglas needs him to be. Douglas hugs his dad again.",
        "Ridge tells Brooke that she is wrong. This is not Logan's against Forrester's. Hope adds that Douglas is here right where he wants to be. Ridge argues that Thomas has been raising his son for years and now suddenly Hope has him for a couple of months and she is the expert. Liam jumps in and says he knows they are frustrated and Ridge's son messed up and he is trying to get him back on the path of redemption but forcing Douglas back with him is not going to do that. Brooke breaks it up by saying if he lets Thomas walk out of here with Douglas Ridge asks yes, what will she do. She says she has tried over and over to be patient and Ridge says he will get Thomas help but he has not done that. Thomas is sick and needs some serious help. Ridge is jeopardizing Douglas's safety and she will not allow that. He repeats that \u0096 will not allow it? She does not get to decide where the boy lives. She is livid and says she will not allow Thomas to take another child away from her daughter. She gets in his face and takes off her ring and holds it up to him and says he might as well take them too. He is so blinded by his son and he cannot see that she is trying to protect this family. She opens his hands and puts the ring in it and says he promised to love and cherish her above all else but he didn't. He is not capable. He replies that maybe she is not capable .not capable of forgiveness. But Thomas is not going to lose his son over this. She says he may lose his marriage over this. Thomas and Douglas come in and want to say goodbye. Hope goes to Douglas. He tells her that his dad says he has to go but will she still be his mommy. She says of course. She does not want him to go and wishes he could stay here. He says he misses his dad and he does want him now. Ridge tells him he can visit Hope any time he wants. Douglas gives her one final hug and his favorite stuffed animal. Thomas tells Hope he will be back tomorrow for the rest of Douglas's things. Once gone, Hope breaks down with Liam holding her. She lashes out at Ridge of what she might do if Thomas puts Douglas in harm's way. Ridge says he will look out for him. He holds up the ring to Brooke but she shakes her head so he leaves. She goes to Hope and they console each other."

        "Ridge: I thought we were gonna try to be civil about this. I thought you were gonna give me time to help thomas get back on his feet.",
        "Brooke: And while you're helping thomas, who's helping his son? Hope and liam have been nice enough to help give him a safe place...",
        "Ridge: Yes, but that was temporary. It was always temporary.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, you told me when you moved out you were gonna convince thomas to sign over custody.",
        "Ridge: I also told you it was a bad idea. But it tom for some reason thinks it's a good idea, he'll call a lawyer, not you.",
        "Hope: Look, I understand how you might think my mom's overstepping...",
        "Ridge: Might think? What does that mean?",
        "Hope: Look, this is about douglas' well-being, right? Where he's happy. And I think that is here in a home with liam and me. This is about supporting douglas.",
        "Ridge: Yes, it is, and you should support him. Keep supporting him, but not as his parent. As his friend, maybe. It's not your kid. This is thomas' son.",
        "Donna: Honey bear. Ah. Oh. Um... we're alone, right?",
        "Eric: Yeah, if quinn were here, you would have been slapped by now.",
        "Donna: [ Chuckles ] What can I say? Old habits.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Donna: Um, actually, I'm looking for ridge. Um, I'm supposed to patch him into a conference call in, um, five minutes, I think.",
        "Eric: Uh, bad news for you. He just, uh, he just left. He's not gonna be back today, I don't think.",
        "Donna: Oh. Okay. Um, do you know why?",
        "Eric: I ran into him and thomas on their way out a while ago.",
        "Donna: What's going on?",
        "Eric: They're picking up douglas. Thomas is taking him back.",
        "Ridge: Thomas isn't signing his rights away.",
        "Brooke: Shouldn't that be up to thomas?",
        "Ridge: It is up to him, but he's struggling right now.",
        "Thomas: Look, look, yes. I am struggling. I've been struggling for a long time, ever since caroline died. Okay? But does that mean I'm unfit to be a parent? No. Now, hope, look, I'm so thankful for everything you've done. I don't know how I would have gone through the last few months without you, okay? But this is my son we're talking about.",
        "Hope: We all want what's best for douglas. You get that, right?",
        "Ridge: We all get that, hope. You've done a wonderful job. Now you've got to focus on beth. Don't take his son 'cause you want to punish him.",
        "Hope: This is not about punishment. This is about what's in douglas' best interests.",
        "Ridge: And that's why he needs to leave this house.",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Liam: Okay, hold on. Hold on a second. Ridge. Ridge. Just put custody aside. This is where douglas feels safe, this house.",
        "Ridge: He feels safe with his dad. That's why he's leaving the house today.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, that's not happening. Do you hear me? This is where douglas wants to be, and this is where he'll stay.",
        "Donna: If thomas and ridge snatch douglas away from...",
        "Eric: No, they're not snatching douglas. It's not a kidnapping. It's thomas' son. Ah, I hate how much this is hurting hope.",
        "Donna: You know, even though beth is back now, all those months apart really made a permanent scar, and--and bonding with douglas saved her. Thomas has to know that.",
        "Eric: It's just a terrible situation, no matter how it turns out.",
        "Hope: You can do the right thing for douglas. Please sign the papers.",
        "Brooke: He's thriving here, thomas, with hope and liam and beth.",
        "Liam: It's true. He loves beth. He treats her like a sister.",
        "Ridge: And he can keep doing that. Just not as your child. What do you want out of this? What is it, you want more children now? Is that what you're doing?",
        "Liam: You--you think I'm not conflicted? I'm split between two families already. But douglas is my family. I mean, he's my cousin's son, right? And I believe caroline would have wanted me to look after him if need be. You know, we've-- we've been talking about this, right? Everybody knows I do not like him. But if douglas has a small chance of having a stable father one day...",
        "Brooke: But he's not stable.",
        "Liam: I know. I'm--",
        "Ridge: Can you stop saying that about my son, please?",
        "Thomas: Hey, hey, it's okay. Try not to be upset with brooke. I understand where she's coming from. It makes sense. It's just-- look, brooke, I've been-- I've been doing a lot of soul searching, okay? I'm trying to make myself better and be more self-aware.",
        "Brooke: Really? How are you doing that? By going to the office or hanging out with vinny?",
        "Ridge: We're trying. Everyone is trying. He knows he needs help. He's getting help. You know what doesn't help? You undermining everything he does. You know what else? It doesn't help when somebody else wants to take his kid away.",
        "Liam: Can we please not keep overreacting to the papers?",
        "Ridge: Overreacting?",
        "Liam: It's like...",
        "Ridge: Hey, liam, how would you feel if somebody walked in here and said, \"I want to take one of your daughters away\"? How would you feel?",
        "Liam: Ridge, I know, I know. Not great. I wouldn't like it. I got it. But we're all here for the same reason, right? We're all trying to do what's best for douglas. So while we're figuring this out, why on earth would he not stay here where he's safe and comfortable? For god's sake, the kid's got school in the morning.",
        "Ridge: His dad can take him to school.",
        "Liam: Oh, come on.",
        "Hope: I am the one who takes douglas to and from school. I pack his lunch every day. I'm the one that the teachers know, that asks douglas how he's--",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. Can we take-- just take a breath here? If thomas needs you, he can call you. You guys can go together. But you, you are not the parent. Thomas is.",
        "Hope: But he calls me mommy hope for a reason, and that's because I have been a mother to him. I have been the adult that stepped up for him after caroline died, not the one who went off the rails and kept my own daughter from me. And now you want to take away douglas, too. After he finally has some peace and I do, too, you want to take that away from us? You're really gonna make me go through the pain of losing a child again? After everything you've already put me through? All of the lies... please don't do that. Hahahahahaha. Hahaha.",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry, hope. But you need to understand that douglas is not your child.",
        "Brooke: Not biologically, but she has been functioning as his mother.",
        "Hope: And liam like a father. We have been providing a home for him here. We've been raising him. You can't just storm in here and rip him away from us.",
        "Ridge: Just so I understand, you're saying that taking beth out of the only home she's ever known was a mistake?",
        "Brooke: Oh, my...",
        "Hope: That is not fair. That is an entirely different circumstance.",
        "Ridge: How is it different? You walked into steffy's house, you claimed what was yours, and you walked out. I didn't like that. Steffy didn't like that. But you had every right to do that.",
        "Thomas: I am sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. I still don't want to hurt you.",
        "Hope: You are always going to be a father to him, thomas. I just think that he should be in my care. So please just let me do that. Just let me be a mother to him.",
        "Thomas: I wanted that. I wanted that to be with me, not instead of me. Now look, he's my son, and I miss him. And douglas misses me.",
        "Brooke: You are crashing at your friend's apartment. How is that a good environment?",
        "Thomas: You won't let me in this house. I mean--",
        "Ridge: Thomas, thomas, stop. I talked to dad. I talked to quinn. They're gonna stay there for a while, and I'm gonna move in with them, too.",
        "Brooke: [ Scoffs ]",
        "Ridge: It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be the forrester men, four generations under one roof. [ Phone buzzes ] And try and heal.",
        "Hope: Um...",
        "Liam: What is it?",
        "Hope: It's, uh, andy's mom. She's dropping douglas off soon.",
        "Thomas: Where? Down at the cabin?",
        "Hope: Thomas, please don'T.",
        "Brooke: No, you're not gonna do this.",
        "Thomas: Whoa! Remember the last time you pushed me?",
        "Liam: Oh, god.",
        "Brooke: You can still fix this, ridge. You can do right by your grandson. Thomas is dangerous, and you know that. Don't let him do this. Don't let him walk out of this house with douglas.",
        "Donna: The thing is this doesn't just affect hope and thomas. I mean, whatever happens will have a huge impact on ridge and brooke, too.",
        "Eric: Yeah. They're both trying to do what's best for their own child.",
        "Donna: It's gonna cause tension.",
        "Eric: They've survived a lot over the years. I just hope this won't be too much.",
        "Brooke: Oh, wow, this is, uh, this is beyond cruel.",
        "Ridge: This is what douglas needs. Think about it. He's gonna be with his father. He's gonna be with me, his great-grandfather. It's gonna be all the forresters. It's where he belongs.",
        "Brooke: All the forresters. Yeah, as opposed to the logans, right? Ridge, I'm your wife. I am a forrester. But you don't see me that way, do you? No, you don'T. Thomas and douglas are your family, but not me and hope?",
        "Ridge: How-- how are you getting that? I didn't say any of this.",
        "Brooke: Yes. You are saying that. I can see it in your eyes. This is exactly the way stephanie used to look at me. Go ahead. Might as well say it. No slut from the valley is worthy of raising a forrester.",
        "Thomas: Right, so what did you and andy do? Hmm?",
        "Douglas: His mom took us to the arcade together.",
        "Thomas: Oh, fun. Wow. Well, I should call her and thank her. And maybe I can take you and andy there next week, make it up.",
        "Douglas: You have her phone number?",
        "Thomas: Well, I can get it from hope. I got some news, actually. Uh, we're gonna live together again.",
        "Douglas: You're coming back?",
        "Thomas: Well, actually, you're gonna come live with me.",
        "Douglas: But I thought this was supposed to be my home now.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Well, look, liam and hope have been doing a great job taking care of you, but it's time for you to come live with me, okay? And I know that you might feel like you can't trust me, but I'm gonna prove to you that you can. I missed you so much.",
        "Douglas: I've missed you, too, daddy. But you're not mad at me?",
        "Thomas: No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not mad at you. I was mad at myself for keeping that secret. It was wrong, and you helped me realize that I should be better, and I will be better. I'm going to be the daddy that you need me to be. Ok everyone!",
        "Ridge: How can you say that? This is not about forrester versus logan. This is about what douglas needs.",
        "Hope: If you really cared about what he needs, you'd let him stay here where he wants to be. Ridge, you know thomas isn't ready for this.",
        "Ridge: Thomas isn't ready what? He's been raising this kid for years, and now, all of a sudden, you come in, a couple of months, and you're an expert?",
        "Liam: All right, all right, all right. I know you're-- you're upset, and you're frustrated, and your son messed up, and you're trying to put him on the path to redemption, but forcing him back into douglas' life is not gonna do that.",
        "Ridge: So what are you suggesting, a long transition?",
        "Liam: I don't know.",
        "Ridge: That's not good for the kid. He needs to be with his father now.",
        "Brooke: If you let thomas walk out of here with douglas, I swear I'll...",
        "Ridge: You swear you'll what?",
        "Brooke: Ridge, I have tried to be patient, and I've tried to be understanding ever since you took your son's side in all of this. And you promised me that you were gonna get him the help that he needs. But you haven't done that. Instead, you've just given him whatever the hell he wants. He needs some serious help. Thomas is sick. He is a sick man, and he shouldn't be anywhere near douglas. And you are jeopardizing douglas' safety, ridge, and I will not allow that.",
        "Ridge: Will not allow it? You don't get to decide where that boy lives.",
        "Brooke: So that's it. That's where we stand. Damn it, ridge, you're gonna allow your son to take another child away from my daughter? You're gonna allow that? Well, go ahead. Why don't you just take this, too?",
        "Ridge: What are you doing?",
        "Brooke: You are so blinded. You are being so manipulated by your son, and you can't even see that I'm trying to protect this family.",
        "Ridge: And taking your ring off? That's gonna protect our family? It's gonna protect us?",
        "Brooke: You promised to love and to cherish me above all else, but you can'T. You're not capable.",
        "Ridge: Because I-- I won't allow your daughter to steal my grandson? Maybe you're not capable. You're not capable of forgiveness. Thomas made a mistake. You've made mistakes. I've made mistakes, but we're still here. Thomas is not gonna lose his kid over this.",
        "Brooke: And you want to lose our marriage over this?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Go ahead. Hey, uh, douglas wanted to say goodbye.",
        "Douglas: Daddy says I have to go now, but will you still be my mommy?",
        "Hope: Of course I will. I hope you'll always think of me that way.",
        "Douglas: I didn't do anything wrong, did I?",
        "Hope: What do you mean?",
        "Douglas: To make you want me to go.",
        "Hope: No. Not at all. I wish you could stay here.",
        "Douglas: Me, too. But I miss my daddy. He says he wants me now.",
        "Ridge: You'll see a lot of hope. You can visit whenever you want.",
        "Douglas: I love you.",
        "Hope: I love you, too, douglas. All right.",
        "[ Chuckles ]",
        "Thomas: Okay, bud, uh, we better get going, huh? I'll, uh, I'll be back later for the rest of his stuff. Yeah.",
        "Hope: God...",
        "Liam: I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.",
        "Hope: I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Ridge: It's his son, hope.",
        "Hope: The son that he used, the son that he abandoned!",
        "Ridge: He didn't abandon him.",
        "Hope: He was scared to death of his father. He was confused and afraid, and I know that you have all seen the change in him these past few weeks when he's been under my care. He's happy now. He's healthy. He's no longer having nightmares. And now all that progress, all that growth is just gonna be thrown out the window. Is that what you want, ridge? I swear-- swear if thomas does anything to put that boy in harm's way...",
        "Ridge: He's not gonna do that. He's not gonna...",
        "Brooke: You better make sure of it.",

        "Hope: Peanut butter? I can't take peanut butter. He's your favorite. You sleep with him every night, and--and your mommy gave this to you.",
