Ridge says she is an adult, there is nothing they can do. RJ repeats that Ridge stopped her once before when Bill was not right for her and he is still not right for her now. RJ is dumbfounded to hear that Ridge and Brooke have a plan, so there is more to it than RJ thinks. Ridge fills him in about the shares they need from Bill. RJ thinks that is stupid for even letting his mom be near that man for one more day. Ridge tells him eventually he and Brooke will be back together but they need to get Quinn out of the company now to save the legacy that he wants RJ to get. RJ asks if he really wants to play this game. He knows about the shares now but what about Brooke. She will be marrying Bill for what she thinks is life, not just for a day to get back the shares. That is risking the life of the woman he loves. He says this is Ridge's last chance and if he does nothing he could lose her for good. He keeps hammering away at his dad that all the gold in the world is not worth this trying to keep Quinn out and giving his mom over to Bill. Ridge says he is sick of it just like RJ is so he admits he is right.", "Donna feels Brooke is being distracted and asks if anything is wrong. Brooke finally says it is Ridge. He has a plan. She swears her to secrecy. She fills her in on the shares at FC and that Ridge even kissed her. Donna reminds her that she loves Bill and they have taken a long while to get to this point so all she needs to do is focus on Bill and not Ridge. Wyatt tells Bill that he will be the best man he ever had. Bill says he only wants the last one as this is his last wedding. It means a lot to him for Wyatt to be there at the altar with him. Wyatt assures him that he will take care of everything so Bill just needs to focus on his bride, he will take care of everything else. Bill says good. He only has one thing on his mind and that is to get Brooke to be his wife. Donna tells Brooke that she will say those vows and they will last the rest of her life so do not even think about Ridge and his kiss. She starts to leave when Ridge bursts in the door and practically throws Donna aside. He tells a surprised Brooke that he loves her ..come home with him ..and do not marry that guy. He loves her and they can be a family again. He knows he has made some monumental mistakes but he wants her and he knows she still is in love with him too .so go get rid of Bill right now."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["R.J.: Mom is gonna marry Spencer today. I mean, you have to stop her. You can't let this happen.", "Ridge: Your mother is an adult, R.J.", "R.J.: You know this is a mistake. You've stopped her before. When you guys went to Dubai --", "Ridge: Abu Dhabi. A lot has changed since then.", "R.J.: But Spencer hasn't. He wasn't right for her then, and he's not right for her now.", "Ridge: There's more to it, son.", "R.J.: Like what? You and Mom love each other. If there's a way you can make this work... you just can't let her do this, Dad.", "Ridge: Your mom and I have a plan.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Birds chirping]", "Donna: Dad is crazy. No matter how many pictures Marcus sends of Rosie, he always wants more. And then he sends them to me. Even the ones I already have. Oh, I can take some photos if you want. But I'm sure Bill's already got that handled. He's so excited. It's kind of cute. That's...a funny expression to be wearing on your wedding day.", "Brooke: Oh. Sorry.", "Donna: Is something wrong? R.J.?", "Brooke: It's Ridge.", "Donna: What now?", "Brooke: He wants me to marry Bill. He has a plan.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Hey.", "Wyatt: Hey.", "Bill: You ready to do this?", "Wyatt: I'll be the best best man you ever had.", "Bill: Best and last.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "Bill: Brooke and I are getting married for good this time.", "Wyatt: I'm proud to be a part of it, Pop.", "Bill: Having you at the altar means a lot to me.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Hey, this is about you and Brooke today. You focus on your wife. I will take care of everything else. No distractions.", "Bill: No need to worry about that. My mind is on one thing -- Brooke finally becoming my wife.", "Wyatt: Hey, have we heard from the minister yet?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alison: He just texted that the 405 is backed up, but he's almost to the exit.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: It's all right. No rush. Brooke's still upstairs getting ready.", "Justin: \"No rush.\" Listen to this guy. Marriage is softening him up already.", "Bill: Hey, you know what, Justin? It took Brooke and me a long time to get back here. Now that we have, I'm gonna savor it.", "Justin: You almost sound sentimental, dollar Bill.", "[Laughter]", "Justin: All kidding aside, man, I'm really happy that you're happy.", "Bill: Well, that's the effect Brooke has on me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: This is strictly between us. You can't say anything.", "Donna: I don't even know what you're talking about. Ridge has a plan?", "Brooke: To get control of the company.", "Donna: What does that have to do with you marrying Bill? Ridge can't want that. Bill is giving you shares of Forrester creations. Ridge wants them.", "Brooke: Yes.", "Donna: But he can't want them that badly. He's never thought that Bill was even right for you.", "Brooke: He still doesn't. He hates the idea of us being together.", "Donna: So you marry Bill today and Ridge gets the shares. [Sighs] What lips do you want?", "Brooke: There's more. Ridge kissed me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Bill owns part of Forrester. I need those shares to get Quinn out of the company.", "R.J.: Okay, but what's that have to do with Mom?", "Ridge: The shares are gonna be a wedding present for her.", "R.J.: You're not gonna stop the wedding because of a couple shares of Forrester Creations?", "Ridge: We need to get Quinn out of here. She's gonna destroy this company, everything I worked for, everything I want for you.", "R.J.: Yeah, but what about Mom?", "Ridge: [Sighs] We'll be together again.", "R.J.: How?", "Ridge: It's Bill Spencer, R.J. He does stupid things. He's gonna say something stupid, do something stupid, and she's gonna leave.", "R.J.: This is crazy, all right? You're leaving this up to a \"what if\"? How could you let her be his wife for even one day?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Reverend, I want you to meet my son and best man, Wyatt.", "Wyatt: It's great to have you.", "Reverend Brown: My pleasure.", "Bill: My assistant Alison, who, of course, you've spoken to on the phone.", "Reverend Brown: Hey, Alison. It's nice to finally put a face to that voice.", "Alison: Lovely to see you.", "Bill: And my best friend, Justin.", "Justin: Yes, sir. I'll be handling all the paperwork.", "Reverend Brown: Hey, Justin.", "Bill: Ah, who is also my attorney.", "Reverend Brown: Well, it seems you have everything well taken care of.", "Justin: Yes, sir.", "Bill: Well, this wedding has been a long time coming, so I didn't want to leave anything to chance.", "Alison: It's gonna be a wonderful ceremony.", "Wyatt: Yeah, we're all very excited about it.", "Justin: No more than this guy.", "Reverend Brown: And the bride.", "Justin: Oh, yes.", "Reverend Brown: Has she arrived?", "Bill: Oh, yeah. She's, uh, she's upstairs getting ready.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: I've told you everything, and I've got to get ready. We've got to do my hair and get dressed.", "Donna: But none of this makes sense. I...I don't understand. He -- he kisses you, yet he expects you to marry Bill, get the shares, and then leave him?", "Brooke: I told him that's not happening. He's hoping I'm gonna have a change of heart.", "Donna: I can't believe Ridge.", "Brooke: I know. I know. It's crazy. But if you saw the hold that Quinn has on Eric...", "Donna: Don't even get me started on that fiasco.", "Brooke: That's why Ridge is acting this way. Everything is heightened because of Quinn and how R.J.'s back in town and all these residual feelings are coming up because I'm getting married today. [Sighs]", "Donna: But you don't have those feelings for him, right?", "Brooke: I love Bill.", "Donna: Good. God. How many times has Ridge done this? Swooped in at the last minute to throw your life into chaos. You can't let him do this to you again.", "Brooke: I know.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: R.J., I'm talking to you, because I know you're mature enough to understand.", "R.J.: Okay, but it doesn't make sense.", "Ridge: It doesn't make sense to me, either. But that's the situation we're in.", "R.J.: Okay, then change it! I mean, go over to her!", "Ridge: It's not that simple. We need the shares.", "R.J.: Dad, what type of person has a plan like this?", "Ridge: This is about our company! It's about our future, son!", "R.J.: It's about our family. We could have been together again, and you're just gonna throw that away?", "Ridge: No, we can still have that.", "R.J.: [Scoffs] I know you love Mom, Dad. You got to stop her from marrying Spencer. This is insane!", "Ridge: No, it's not insane! It's extreme! Your grandfather won't listen to me. And Quinn can't have this kind of power, but Brooke -- your mother has made a decision to marry that tool. We got to respect that and just hope that the marriage won't last.", "R.J.: [Scoffs] Did Mom tell you that? 'Cause I've talked to Mom. And she didn't say anything about being unsure or shares or you, Dad. She talked about Bill Spencer, starting a life with him, how much it meant to her. She's actually becoming Mrs. Bill Spencer right now, and you're just standing here.", "Ridge: You think I like this?", "R.J.: Then change it. She's really marrying Bill. But this time it's forever.", "Ridge: Well, we'll see about that.", "R.J.: You really want to play this game? Do shares mean that much to you? Sure, protecting the company, but risking a life with the woman you love? [Scoffs] This is your last chance, Dad. This is it. If you don't do something about this now, you can lose her for good.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Birds chirping]", "Bill: I do like this suit.", "Wyatt: Thank you.", "Bill: You have the rings, right?", "Wyatt: They're in my pocket. They're right here till the minister asks for them.", "Bill: All right, just checking.", "Wyatt: You're not getting nervous, are you, Dad? I'm just asking. I'm just making sure.", "Bill: I'm your dad, right?", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Bill: So you know me.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Bill: Am I the most patient man?", "Wyatt: [Scoffing] No.", "Bill: But I don't give up, either.", "Wyatt: Hmm.", "Bill: So, if I have to wait a little while longer to make Brooke my wife, it'll be well worth it.", "Bill: Tell me you agree, that you know this is right. Love will prevail. We will prevail.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Donna: I found it!", "Brooke: Oh! [Laughs] It looks like you found some champagne, too.", "Donna: Oh, and...", "Brooke: And some...", "Both: Water.", "Brooke: Yes.", "[Both laugh]", "Donna: Oh, so the necklace was on the floor in the backseat. Must have fallen out on the way over. And as for this, I figured, um, you know, it's a day for celebration.", "Brooke: Mm-hmm.", "Donna: We could, uh, toast the occasion, talk about your husband-to-be, how lucky he is. [Chuckles]", "Brooke: Yeah, he is pretty lucky.", "Donna: Yeah. [Chuckles] To my big sis. [Sighs] May you have a lifetime of happiness with Bill. Sure took you guys a long time to get here, but you faced it together. And you will -- everything from now on as husband and wife. I'm really happy for you, babe.", "Brooke: Cheers.", "[Glasses clink]", "Donna: Cheers.", "Brooke: Hmm! I got to freshen my lips.", "Donna: Oh.", "Brooke: Where is that?", "Donna: Oh, oh, here it is. Here. Let me do that.", "Brooke: Mm-hmm.", "Donna: [Sighs] Here you go.", "Brooke: I really do appreciate this.", "Donna: Come on. It's nothing. Nothing at all.", "Brooke: I mean it. It -- it means a lot to me.", "Donna: Of course. Can't have you thinking about Ridge today. [Sighs] Did he realize how unfair he was being?", "Brooke: He's just looking out for my best interests, you know. He just can't believe that I want a life with Bill.", "Donna: So he -- he kisses you.", "Brooke: Look, I-I thought you didn't want me dwelling on Ridge.", "Donna: I don't. I'm -- I'm sorry. I just -- I -- [Scoffs] I'm just surprised. You know, I... I hope you set him straight.", "Brooke: Yeah, I think I did, for the most part. Mm-hmm. Anyway, uh, Bill is waiting, so I need to get ready.", "Donna: Brooke, look at me. You said you -- you love Bill.", "Brooke: Yes, I do.", "Donna: That's the only thing you should be thinking about right now, not -- not Ridge, not Eric or Quinn. Just...you and Bill, starting the rest of your lives together. Today marks the beginning of forever.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: I'm not losing your mother forever, R.J. I just -- I have to let this play out.", "R.J.: Yeah, yeah, until you get Bill's shares, right? But what if Bill's shares are the only thing you get? Mom wouldn't just say vows if she didn't mean what she says. Think about what you're asking. She's not making a commitment until things get tough. She's thinking long term. She's thinking forever. You're just gonna let it happen? As they start a life together, you just sit, cross your fingers, and hope that she changes her mind? Are the shares that valuable to you? I mean, you have loved Mom since you saw her catering a party at Grandma and Granddad's house. I mean, how many times have you told me that story?", "Ridge: [Chuckles]", "R.J.: You two are meant to be with each other.", "Ridge: Yeah, maybe we are.", "R.J.: But you're letting her marry another man? A man you despise? So you're okay with this? The wedding, the romantic honeymoon on his yacht, building a future together?", "Ridge: No, I'm not okay with it! It makes me sick!", "R.J.: Well, it makes me sick, too. But I can't do anything about it. You can. What means more to you, Dad? The company or Mom?", "Ridge: Come on. Your mother.", "R.J.: Then treat her that way. I don't care if it's for all the gold in the world. You can't be this obsessed with getting rid of Quinn. Do you want Mom? Do you want Mom?!", "Ridge: Yes!", "R.J.: Then go and get her! Stop the wedding before it's too late.", "Ridge: You're right, R.J. You're right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Birds chirping]", "Wyatt: I forgot. Am I giving a reading? 'Cause I think there were some words about love being patient.", "Bill: Come on! What's the hold-up? You know waiting doesn't suit me.", "Alison: I have spoken to the caterers, and we're gonna combine the reception with the cocktails as soon as the ceremony is over.", "Bill: Well, who knows when we're gonna get started?", "Justin: Donna's probably up there talking Brooke's ear off, so...", "Bill: I'm gonna find out what's going on.", "Alison: I think it is prudent for the groom to stay put. A woman wants to look her best on her wedding day, so you will wait right here and look appropriately dazzled when she arrives.", "Bill: [Groans]", "Wyatt: I can go sneak up the back stairs if you want me to. Hmm?", "Bill: No. No, no, uh, Alison's right. Everything's been planned, and it's gonna happen this time. I've waited this long, right? I guess I can wait a little bit longer to see my -- my beautiful bride come walking down those stairs.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Donna: You're a beautiful bride on her wedding day. So much to look forward to. The promises you make today, they're supposed to last a lifetime. You have to mean them.", "Brooke: I will.", "Donna: You can't let Ridge or the thoughts of the kiss get in your head.", "Brooke: I won't. Ridge is just acting on old feelings 'cause R.J.'s in town. But I'm here because I love Bill. We could have an incredible life together. And there's nothing he wouldn't do for me or for the children.", "Donna: Exactly. You can only do this if you mean it. No thoughts of Ridge or -- or shares.", "Brooke: Okay.", "Donna: You're ready?", "Brooke: [Laughs] Yes! Yes, I'm ready.", "Donna: Okay. All right. Okay, I'll go down and tell them.", "Brooke: Okay.", "Donna: [Chuckles] Oh!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Hey, hi. I'm sorry.", "Brooke: Ridge, what are you doing here?", "Ridge: I got to talk to you.", "Brooke: What --", "Donna: I think she's a little busy right now.", "Ridge: You can't do this.", "Brooke: What?!", "Ridge: You can't marry Bill.", "Brooke: He is downstairs waiting.", "Ridge: I know where he is. Just call it off.", "Brooke: What about the shares?", "Ridge: I don't care about the shares. No, I do. I do care about the shares. But I-I care about you more. So at this point, I'm -- I'm just hoping that my dad will come to his senses, the same way that I've come to mine.", "Brooke: What are you saying?", "Ridge: I'm saying that destiny is a real thing. It's been going on for months now. You know, we're getting closer. We're -- we're reconnecting. R.J.'s in town and... man, we can have our family back. I know I've made mistakes. I know. [Sighs] I have had some pretty hurtful misunderstandings. But I don't want to live my life like that. I-I don't -- I don't want my hatred for Quinn or my -- my concern for this company blind me to what is right in front of me, and you are right in front of me. And I love you. I always have. So the better or for worse, in good times and in bad. I want to be with you, so don't marry that guy. Spend the rest of your days with me.", "Brooke: [Gasps] [Exhales deeply]"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIMSnIltY6E"}
