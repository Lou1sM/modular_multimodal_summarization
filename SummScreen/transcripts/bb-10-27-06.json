        "Nick and Ridge both ask Brooke which one is she going to choose to spend the rest of her life with?

Stephanie urges a stunned Donna, who saw the accident, to get the kids back home and away from all of this. Phoebe visits her mother in jail on her 18th birthday. Taylor wants her and her sister and brother to carry on as normal with their lives. Thorne stops by and has some of his own questions he wants to ask Taylor about the so-called accident. He doesn't want people to call his wife a nitwit. He admits deep down he too was very furious with her for doing what she did and not just bringing Phoebe home that night. Eric, Thomas, Shane, Harry, Hector, Dante and Felicia gather for a scaled down birthday party.",
        "Bridget gives all of them Jackie's prognosis. Nick sits and talks to his unconscious mother, vowing she will be alright. Stephanie gives her version of the night's events without implicating herself in Jackie's fall except that it was a terrible accident. Nick warns that his mother better be okay or Stephanie will live to regret it. She tells Brooke that Jackie will be okay and Brooke doesn't have to put her life on hold because of this. She and Ridge can be together now. Ridge literally pulls Brooke into a linen room and begs her to tell him that she is ready to spend the rest of their lives together."

        "Stephanie: I don't know. What are you doing here?",
        "Donna: I couldn't leave. Her car was blocking me.",
        "Stephanie: Yes. Yes, 911. This is the Forrester residence. Yeah, we've had a terrible accident, please. Someone's fallen down a whole flight of stairs. We need the paramedics, we need the fire department, right now! Thank you. Oh, my God.",
        "Stephanie: Why are you looking at me like that? Donna! Take the children, and take them to their mother's home. I don't want them to see the ambulance come up, they'll be frightened. Go now, go! Take the keys and go! Go, Donna! Oh, my God. Jacqueline \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Happy birthday, sweetheart. I just can't believe you and your sister are 18. I wish it was under better circumstances.",
        "Phoebe: No, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, I wasn't really in a party mood, anyway. Especially with you in here.",
        "Taylor: What, you don't like my new digs?",
        "Phoebe: No.",
        "Taylor: Hey, but they do have visiting hours here. And I'm not going anywhere. Look, I just want you and your brother and your sister to go on with your life like everything's normal, no matter what happens, okay? And if it gets to be too much, just think of all the great times we've had together, think of all the great memories we've shared. It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Thorne: Phoebe -- happy birthday.",
        "Taylor: Thank you for that. Thanks for coming by.",
        "Thorne: I keep replaying in my head what Shane said in court and what you told me up at big bear, about how Darla fell into the road that night. I know you said you wouldn't let storm make this out to be about my wife. But how can it not be about her, if it really was an accident? So, that's why I'm here. Because I have some questions of my own. Questions only you can answer.",

        "Felicia: Listen, guys. We all realize it's a far cry from the big bash we planned before Taylor wound up behind bars, but",

        "Thomas: You really came through for my mom, man.",

        "Jackie: Don't you dare walk away from me!",
        "Stephanie: I asked you to leave!",
        "Jackie: Not until you understand --",
        "Stephanie: Oh, for God's sake, dear, this is called trespassing.",
        "Jackie: Oh, like you trespass into people's lives?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, Jackie, for God's sake!",
        "Jackie: That means nothing to you, does it? No, because you are the most despicable --",

        "Nick: Stephanie, where is she? Where's my mother?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, Nick, I'm glad you're here. She's in there. The doctors are examining. And Bridget's there, too.",
        "Nick: What happened?",
        "Stephanie: Well, there was an accident.",
        "Nick: What kind of accident?",
        "Stephanie: At the house. Your mother came over to the house and she followed me up the stairs, and she fell.",
        "Nick: She fell, as in down the stairs fell? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Brooke: Oh, Bridget, how is she?",

        "Brooke: Oh, thank God.",
        "Bridget: Unfortunately, the ct scan didn't come back quite as positive. And Jackie's suffering from an acute subdural hematoma.",
        "Nick: Well, what's that?",
        "Bridget: It occurs when a blood vessel ruptures and blood collects in the brain between the brain and the brain's outer lining. The longer that she remains unconscious, the more grave the effects could be, including permanent neurological and cognitive damage.",
        "Nick: Oh, God. I want to see her.",
        "Bridget: Okay. Come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: God, none of this would have happened -- none of this would have happened if she just hadn't shown up at the house the way she did.",
        "Brooke: So, are you saying that this is her fault? You had nothing to do with any of this?",
        "Stephanie: There's no blame to shift. What are you implying?",
        "Ridge: Come on, Brooke's not implying anything. We just want to know how this happened.",
        "Stephanie: Well, Jackie came to the house unexpectedly. She threw it in my face that you had invited nick over to your house. Anyway, we got into a whole big thing, and finally, I just said to her, \"please leave, okay?\" She wouldn't. So then I finally -- I said to her, \"well all right, I'm going to go up to my room. You leave whenever you want to.\" And she followed me up the stairs. We got up to the top of the stairs, we got into another big argument, and -- well, that's when it got ugly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Out of my sight for a few minutes, you go tumbling down the stairs on me. Doctors are doing everything they can, so you just take your time and rest. You're going to be fine. You're going to be just fine. And I'll never let anything happen to you again. Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Listen, my wife was not stupid, nor was she a klutz. But that's how it sounded to me when you told me what happened that night, like it was all Darla's fault.",
        "Taylor: No, Thorne, I didn't mean --",
        "Thorne: I know, I know. But that's what I heard, Taylor. Because that's what people had said about her all her life. Well, this time, she couldn't defend herself, Taylor. So I did. Because that is what a husband does, he protects his wife. Even after she's gone. I couldn't have people thinking that she was some nitwit when she was just trying to help a scared girl who was stranded on the side of the road -- who needed her. Truth is -- deep down inside, there was a part of me that is so furious with her, because all she had to do was bring phoebe back to the house instead of changing the damn tire. But still, what Shane said and what you and phoebe have been telling me about how she fell back into the road that night, my heart doesn't want to believe it. Not even now. Was it an accident, Taylor? A terrible, tragic accident?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harry: I'm not sure what I could possibly get you, but --",
        "Shane: Hold up there, sailor boy. I mean, aren't you jumping the gun here a little bit? The girl hasn't even cut the cake yet.",
        "Phoebe: Actually, we're waiting on dad and Stephanie. Granddad's trying to track them down now.",
        "Eric: God --",
        "Felicia: Dad, what is it?",
        "Eric: This is Bridget. Something's happened to Jackie Marone.",
        "Phoebe: What?",
        "Eric: I'm not sure, but she's in the hospital. It must be -- it must be something serious.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You're saying it got ugly?",
        "Stephanie: Well, I asked her to leave the house. Honestly, I asked her very politely, and she wouldn't. She was like a dog with a bone. You know, she came tearing up those stairs after me, ranting and raving when she grabbed me. You know, it got physical. And she was standing by the banister and --",
        "Nick: And what? Go on, I'm waiting. What happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Hey.",
        "Phoebe: Hi.",
        "Shane: Sorry that the party fizzled out like that. Especially after your grandfather got that really bad phone call.",
        "Phoebe: It's fine. I wasn't really in the party mood, anyway, with my mom not here.",
        "Shane: I know. Listen, Phoebe, this is -- this is a really important day for you, you know? I mean, you're turning 18. You're going to be a woman now. What could be better than that, right?",
        "Phoebe: Lots of things. You, for one, coming in and telling everyone that mom hitting Darla was an accident.",
        "Shane: Me?",
        "Phoebe: I wish there was some way I could repay you.",
        "Shane: Maybe there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Taylor -- I'm going to ask you this one time and one time only -- what happened that night?",
        "Taylor: Everything just happened so fast, I -- I didn't have time to react. You know, but that still doesn't excuse what I did -- covering it up and then letting you believe a lie. I should've been honest with you right from the start. But I did try to tell you. I tried -- I tried, Thorne, so many times. Only, then we started to get closer. And then it got harder, because I was trapped. I knew if I told you that it would mean losing you. And that was the last thing I wanted. I mean, you know, that would be a relationship built on a lie, and you deserve better than that. I just wish I could've, I don't know, found a way to tell you without it -- I just wish \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I told you to keep your hands off of my mother.",
        "Stephanie: Nick, it was an accident.",
        "Nick: Well, for your sake, you better hope it was. Because if she doesn't make it or is impaired in any way, I will make sure that you live to regret it.",
        "[Brooke sighs]",
        "Brooke: Nick, wait. I just want you to know, whatever you need, I am here for you. I am here.",
        "Stephanie: I can understand that Nick's upset and angry with me. But he's got to understand it was an accident. You don't have to worry about him, you know. He's a strong man. He'll get through this. He'll handle this very well. Bring in the best specialists for her and Jackie's going to be fine. You don't have to put your life on hold because of this, Brooke. You know, you and ridge have waited a long time to be together, and now -- now, here it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Logan --",
        "Brooke: Ridge --",
        "Ridge: Come in here, come in here, come in here.",
        "Brooke: No, no, let me out of here.",
        "Ridge: No, come on, just hear me out. Please, just hear me out. Listen, too many things have come between us the last long while. I don't want to let that happen anymore. I want our families reunited. I want you. I need you. You're ready to trust me again, spend the rest of our lives together. So, tell me -- tell me -- tell me that you're ready to. Tell me."
