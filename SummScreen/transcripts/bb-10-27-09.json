        "It's a feeding frenzy and the reporters hound Katie about her wedding day. Bill wants it to be as soon as possible. Brooke is asked about the transition and she gives the typical statement that she supports her sister all the way. Bill assures them that both Donna and Brooke will play a bigger role; he has expanded the Royalty line. And he's happy to still have Eric and Ridge on board. Ridge grouses to Taylor that Bill owns them now, but this was the only way to keep the company afloat. Rocco invites Ridge to the shooting of the Royalty line, but he passes. Steffy and Thomas tell Ridge they understand why he had to accept what happened and it will affect all of them. Bill explains to Katie's parents, Stephen and Beth, that this was a sudden engagement, but they can blame it on Katie; she took his breath away. Justin slips up and calls Marcus son, but Marcus says it's cool. He just wants to remind him this is a family business.",
        "Stephen explains to Donna that her mom has good days and bad ones, but today is a good one. Justin tells Donna that the shoot took him back to when she was the Homecoming Queen. He felt like he lost something precious that night, but now he has some of it back. She tells him they are leading different lives now and they have to leave the past alone. Ridge assures Steffy and Thomas that the company is their birthright and Bill Spencer will not take that away from them. He can't design though and feels like he is sinking. Brooke apologizes but says she had to do the Royalty line otherwise it would have made her sister look bad on her first day with reporters around. He admits he is not sure he can work for Katie and Bill. It's wrong the way Katie has moved into Eric's office. He doesn't want to speak ill of her, but it feels like she has stabbed them in the back. Eric won't even come to the office. Brooke tries to soothe him; she doesn't want to lose him again. She begs him to design his heart out, but hang in there. It is for their future, their family. Bill whisks Katie away and takes her outside for a surprise \u0096 new logo for the buildings that says Forrester Creation, a division of Spencer Publications."

        "Taylor: Oh, my gosh. It's a feeding frenzy out there.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. For once, I'm glad Mother's working at Jackie M. I don't know how she'd deal with the circus out there. It would break her heart.",
        "Taylor: Well, how about you? How are you doing?",
        "Ridge: Well, making this deal was the only way to safeguard our company, Doc, for our children.",
        "Taylor: But it would cost you.",
        "Ridge: Maybe I should have kept fighting. Maybe there was some other way to keep this legacy out of Spencer's hands, but he owns us now. And the thought of it just makes me sick.",

        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Thomas: Hey, guys. Bet you're not a big fan of Spencer Media Day, Dad.",

        "Man: Then why hasn't your husband released a statement?",
        "Bill: We're going to let Ridge's designs speak for him. I trust that you will be very impressed with the new line. I also want to point out that the Logan sisters are going to play an even greater role now that Forrester is expanding. As a matter of fact, I have scheduled a new Royalty shoot for later this afternoon, and you are all welcome to attend.",
        "Katie: (Laughs)",
        "Woman: Thank you.",
        "Bill: This is a very exciting time here at Forrester. Now that it has the backing of Spencer Publications, it has muscle, and it has capital. The sky is the limit. There will be a permanent place here for all of Forrester's very talented employees. And I would like to say that, uh, I am thrilled to have Eric and Ridge Forrester onboard along with their unbridled enthusiasm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I know you did this for us.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, so we could have a place in the company. So if Katie has your job as C.E.O., then where do you fit?",
        "Taylor: So do you become the president?",
        "Ridge: I guess that's up to Katie. She can give me whatever title she wants or none at all. She and Bill are calling the shots anyway.",

        "Thomas: Well, how did Katie go from being head of P.R. to the new queen of Forrester?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. Maybe Katie will surprise us all. Who knows? Maybe she'll be the best thing that ever happened to this company. I'm not sure of anything anymore.",

        "Bill: Yeah. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the Royalty line was Katie's inspiration and one of the first things that impressed me. It made me realize that her vision can shape the future of this company. Thank you for supporting our new C.E.O. And for supporting our new merger.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Dad, this whole thing is so unfair.",
        "Thomas: You deserve to keep running the business.",
        "Taylor: You have worked for this for years, Ridge.",
        "Thomas: And now Katie's taken your place? That's not right.",
        "Ridge: Look, I want this company to be yours someday. It's your birthright. We're not gonna let Katie Logan or Bill Spencer take it away from you. You understand me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: You decent?",
        "Donna: Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. (Laughs) So... how did you like the shoot?",
        "Justin: (Sighs) Oh, it took me back to homecoming night long ago.",
        "Donna: When I-I was crowned queen? Oh, my god. I almost forgot about that. I-I was... (Laughs) I was so surprised when they called my name.",
        "Justin: I wasn't.",
        "Donna: You always saw the best in me.",
        "Justin: We were so close until that phone call ended things.",
        "Justin: It felt like I lost something precious that night. I've just found it again. I want to spend some time alone with you to hear about all those missing years. Maybe that way, I'll get a piece of them back.",
        "Donna: Justin... too much time has passed. It's... we're living different lives now. Let's just leave it alone.",
        "Justin: By the way, you looked beautiful today.",
        "Donna: (Sighs)",
        "Justin: Then again, you were always the most beautiful woman in the room.",
        "Donna: (Sighs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Mm. Everything is working out just the way you said it would. Even Brooke. She was against the takeover at first, but she stood up for me today. I just hope it doesn't put her in a bad position with her husband.",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Bill: Hmm. Excuse me.",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. (Rings)",
        "Bill: Yeah? Great. Great. Okay. We're on our way. Come with me.",
        "Katie: Where are we going?",
        "Bill: You'll see.",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: (Sighs) Oh, man.",
        "Ridge: Ah, my beautiful wife, just the distraction I needed. How was the shoot?",
        "Brooke: Please don't be upset. I had to do it. If I refused, it would have put Katie in a bad spot.",
        "Ridge: Logan, I'm not upset at you. I'm upset with this whole situation. I just feel like I'm sinking here.",
        "Brooke: Just give it time.",
        "Ridge: I'm trying. I'm trying.",
        "Brooke: I know you, Ridge. You are a survivor. I'm sure you'll find a way to make the best of this.",
        "Ridge: I've been trying to tell my children that very same thing. I think they're buying it. The truth is, Logan, I don't think I can work for Bill Spencer or your sister. I just don't know if I have the heart for it. I know she's your sister.",
        "Brooke: (Sighs)",
        "Ridge: But she's not qualified to be C.E.O.",
        "Brooke: (Sighs) Don't let this come between us, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: It's wrong, the way she's moved into Dad's office before his seat's even cold. Look, I don't want speak badly about your sister, but it feels like Katie really stabbed all of us in the back.",
        "Brooke: I know. (Sighs) I know. I'm just trying to give her the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Ridge: Dad won't even come around the office anymore. It hurts too much. And look at this. Spencer's branded everything in sight.",
        "Brooke: (Sighs) I know it's hard. But don't let this drive a wedge between us. I couldn't bear to lose you again.",
        "Ridge: I'll never let that happen, Logan. I'm just trying to make this all work. I'm trying to be a good soldier and support this company, but it's not our company anymore. I feel like we've lost our identity and lost our soul.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, but we could do it somehow. We could thrive in this setup. With you and me together, we could make it bearable.",
        "Ridge: We've lost control. Spencer owns this place, and he owns all of us in it.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, I will block Spencer from you so you can design your heart out. But, please, just hang in there for our family, for our future.",
        "Ridge: Even if it's killing me?",
        "Brooke: (Sighs) Oh, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: I'm staring at a blank page, Logan. Nothing comes. I feel like I'm dead inside. I never should have handed Forrester over to that egomaniac. I'm sorry. It's just killing me inside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Truck beeping)",
        "Katie: So, uh, why are you bringing me out here?",
        "Bill: I just thought we should get some fresh air.",
        "Katie: Uh, that's probably a good idea. It was awfully tense in there. I'm just glad my sisters are supporting me.",
        "Bill: Well, maybe they're finally starting to see what I see when I look at you-- a woman who's a born leader.",
        "Katie: Does that turn you on?",
        "Bill: There's nothing more beautiful... except maybe this. Let her go, boys!",
