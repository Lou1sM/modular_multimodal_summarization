        "Rick: You and him?",
        "Caroline: [Crying] I wanted to tell you.",
        "Rick: Don't you think it's a little late for that?",
        "Hope: Ridge?",
        "Eric: Is this true, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: It was nothing.",
        "Rick: It was what?",
        "Hope: Nothing?! She just admitted it!",
        "Ridge: What Maya felt the need to share with everyone was nothing. It wasn't an affair. It was two people working. So, what did you do -- you follow us up to brook's cabin?",
        "Rick: This happened at my mother's cabin?",
        "Caroline: It was wrong. And we were just -- we were just caught up in the moment. It was a few kisses.",
        "Hope: You are a married woman. I cannot believe this.",
        "Ivy: I-I-I can't stay here for this.",
        "Caroline: [Crying] It was -- there was no more to this. There was...",
        "Rick: [Crying] How long has this been going on, Caroline?",
        "Maya: I am so sorry, Rick. I tried to warn you.",
        "Caroline: Ohh.",
        "Carter: You and I don't belong here. You know why she's doing this. We all do.",
        "Maya: Because I care about you.",
        "Ridge: You got to be a little careful, Maya. Your agenda is showing.",
        "Rick: You know what?! I don't give a damn... about any one of you.",
        "Caroline: [Crying]",
        "Ivy: I'm kind of hiding out.",
        "Hope: I'm gonna wait here for Rick.",
        "Ivy: Do you really think he's gonna come back here?",
        "Hope: I don't know. I don't know what he's gonna do. That was awful.",
        "Ivy: You know what? I-I really don't think it had to be.",
        "Hope: What do you mean?",
        "Ivy: Well, Maya aimed for maximum effect, and she pretty much got it.",
        "Hope: You think that my brother overreacted?",
        "Ivy: No. No, I don't. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that I don't think there's really anything serious going on between Caroline and Ridge.",
        "Hope: What do you know about it?",
        "Carter: Hey.",
        "Ivy: Is it all over?",
        "Carter: No, but I was done.",
        "Hope: What do we think Eric's gonna do?",
        "Carter: He wasn't looking happy.",
        "Eric: You were deliberately using Caroline?",
        "Ridge: I was compromised. She was helping me.",
        "Rick: I don't even want to hear the rest of this!",
        "Caroline: I'll come with you.",
        "Maya: You've done enough!",
        "Caroline: Some foolish things happened, but we came to our senses, and that is the end of it.",
        "Rick: No. No, Caroline. This is the end of it.",
        "Caroline: No.",
        "Ivy: So, what do you think Rick will do?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Well, I think the odds of him willing to work for Ridge just got even more remote.",
        "Carter: For the sake of the company, they'll have to settle it. Rick and Caroline are both too valuable to lose.",
        "Ivy: Well, the question is... is Ridge?",
        "Caroline: Rick, don't. Please, don't! Could you please give us a minute alone?",
        "Rick: What the hell for?! You've already humiliated the both of us!",
        "Caroline: Look, you are -- you are upset, and you have every right to be.",
        "Rick: Are you telling me my rights?! And all this buildup, this big decision -- it was all just theatrics for you, wasn't it, dad? Why did I fall for it? [Crying] Because I did. Because I actually thought for a chance in my life, all my hard work and my ambition would finally pay off. But you knew. You always knew who you were gonna choose -- the anointed one.",
        "Eric: That's not true. I never lost respect for you, ever.",
        "Rick: Will you stop?! Okay? You never seem to have a problem finding the right words. Let me ask you something, dad. Is this out of loyalty to Stephanie that you would choose her son and not your son as blood relation? Or -- or is it because you're too ashamed to admit that you ever had another family with another woman, a woman you two shared? What did you guys do? You guys high- five each other after that?",
        "Ridge: [Snickers]",
        "Rick: Oh, did I say something that was inappropriate? Come on! It's always been there! Well, what about me, huh?! Who am I? Am I still that little kid to you?!",
        "Ridge: So, what do you think -- dad made me C.E.O. Because you weren't good enough?",
        "Rick: He's not your father! And I would think that you would want a son you could count on, one that wouldn't just leave for paris for a year, say, \"to tell with it.\" I'd certainly think that you would want one you could trust.",
        "Ridge: Oh, grow up.",
        "Eric: No, you're in the wrong here, Ridge. You hang on to some dignity.",
        "Ridge: Really? And how do I do that? I had a daughter who's dead because of him, and I have another one who wishes she had never put eyes on him. How do I dignify any of that?!",
        "Rick: Not by sleeping with my wife.",
        "Caroline: Oh, stop it! This is not about every bad thing that ever happened! This is about a betrayal -- a betrayal by you and a betrayal by me, one that you have to forgive. Please. Please forgive us.",
        "Ivy: Okay. So, what should we do? Should we try and do some work or something?",
        "Hope: On what? I mean, we're not even gonna know what we're supposed to work on until they're done in there.",
        "Carter: Or who we'll be working for.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I wonder if Maya will still be around once the smoke clears.",
        "Hope: She can't get fired for telling the truth.",
        "Carter: But she didn't.",
        "Hope: She told a version of it. I think that that's better than knowing and not saying anything.",
        "Carter: Is it? It seems to me like this is a completely unnecessary crisis. It sounds like Caroline got wise to herself and made a course correction before it was too late.",
        "Hope: But how do we know that's true? That's what she says, but I've been around a lot of people who have said, \"I'm so sorry. I will never do it again.\" And they always meant it from the bottom of their heart, but then --",
        "Ivy: How do you do this? How do you come to work every day with your ex here who you clearly still have feelings for? I mean, that's how it looks from the outside.",
        "Carter: Well, I don't -- I don't know. I-I guess in some ways, our relationship's better now. At least she's honest with me.",
        "Hope: So, you do appreciate her honesty? That's what just happened, and now she's being condemned for it.",
        "Carter: It's about her motivation. Her motivation is to be with Rick, to be part of your family. And I get it. Anyone who's not a Forrester, Logan, or Spencer -- they want that feeling of belonging, but to get your way by hurting people like that?",
        "Caroline: Rick, Maya is blowing this way out of proportion, okay? You know why she is doing this. You know what her motives are.",
        "Maya: It's always about me, isn't it, Caroline? Not this time.",
        "Caroline: Rick, baby, baby, please. This is -- this is not helping, all these people, okay? Let's just go home and talk.",
        "Rick: Whose home?",
        "Caroline: Ours.",
        "Rick: Why don't you go back to the cabin with him?",
        "Caroline: I will never do anything like that again.",
        "Rick: You shouldn't have been there in the first place! Did he ask you to go?",
        "Caroline: I just thought that --",
        "Rick: Did you ask him why then?",
        "Caroline: No, I didn't. It was a short phone call. I di--",
        "Rick: Then what did you think, Caroline?",
        "Caroline: I thought that Brooke let him use the place.",
        "Rick: You didn't think about all the guilty kissing you'd be sharing? You didn't think about throwing a bed in the mix this time?",
        "Caroline: No!",
        "Rick: Did you think about me? Did you think about coming home to me? Did you think about touching me with the hands that you touched him with, kissing me with the lips you kissed him with? This was gonna be my big day, my reward for being sent away all those years. I really thought this was the last time I'd be walking through my father's office because it was gonna be mine, and my beautiful -- my beautiful, talented wife would be there to carry on the tradition with me.",
        "Eric: That could still happen, Rick.",
        "Rick: No. You two made your choice.",
        "Eric: There has been no family conspiracy against you.",
        "Rick: It wasn't really necessary, was it? Like a school of fish or a pack of wolves... you all know when to turn, all at the same time. And you certainly knew your target.",
        "Caroline: Wait! Where are you going?!",
        "Rick: What does it matter?! You're where you want to be.",
        "Caroline: No. I'm coming with you.",
        "Rick: No. No.",
        "Caroline: No, please, Rick! I love you! Please!",
        "Hope: Well, Eric's door is still closed.",
        "Ivy: All right. Well [Sighs] I can't just sit around here. I'm so bad at waiting.",
        "Hope: I don't know what else to do.",
        "Ivy: You know what? I'm a newcomer here, and I feel like every corner I turn, there is a new booby trap waiting from the past that I just have no idea about.",
        "Carter: It's hard to be new here.",
        "Hope: I know that feeling/ I felt the same way when I first started working here, and I have known all these people my whole life.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, I haven't. I feel like I'm not entitled to an opinion or to at least take sides.",
        "Hope: Well, I think it's pretty clear-cut this time.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Well, I think that's what we're all telling ourselves.",
        "Eric: Some things I didn't want to say in front of Maya.",
        "Ridge: You knew this wasn't gonna be an easy day. Rick thought you were gonna hand it all to him.",
        "Eric: I don't think that was an unrealistic idea. In fact, I think I'm gonna retain my right to maybe change my mind.",
        "Caroline: Can I please just go?",
        "Eric: No. God! I knew today was gonna be hard, but I had no idea I was gonna find out something like this about the two of you!",
        "Ridge: The only thing you found out was a whole lot of nothing. If Maya wasn't such a drama queen --",
        "Eric: Now, wait a -- wait a minute. This whole arrangement with Caroline -- was this kind of a seduction?",
        "Ridge: Was it what? No!",
        "Eric: I think maybe it was. I think maybe you wanted to present me with a credible design partner while your impairment lasted with the added bonus of sending Rick into a tailspin!",
        "Ridge: Oh. You think I'm that calculating?",
        "Eric: Oh, I know. I know how calculating you can be.",
        "Ridge: This... you remember this. This is artists working together, late hours, and [Sighs] I don't know. Yes, maybe there was a lapse in judgment, but that's over now. Caroline and me -- we know who we are to each other, what kind of team we can and can't be. And Rick -- he'll get over it. He'll be fine. He'll realize that he's not gonna throw away his wedding vows over... some foolish infatuation.",
        "Eric: Is that right, Caroline? Is Rick gonna get over this?",
        "[Slow music playing]",
        "Rick: Did you just say that you love me?",
        "Caroline: Yes.",
        "Rick: I love you, too.",
        "[Music continues]",
        "Rick: [Grunts] [Grunts] [Grunts]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Caroline: Rick? [Crying] Where are you? Can -- can you hear me?",
        "Rick: [Crying] We were just newlyweds.",
        "Caroline: I know. I know. And I have learned from this, and it is gonna make me stronger.",
        "Rick: You let him run all over us.",
        "Caroline: No!",
        "Rick: Of all people, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: Rick? Please don't hang up.",
