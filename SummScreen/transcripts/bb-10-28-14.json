        "Rick rises from the floor amid the broken glass mess and asks Maya if she is following him. She laments that she is not letting him go through this alone and thought he would be here. Caroline tells Ridge and Eric they need to find Rick. He does not need to be alone. Eric says it should not surprise her. Eric tells Ridge this is his brother's wife and he should have had the maturity to walk away and not give in to his passion. He does not want to hear another word. He says at least Caroline has the good sense to feel awful. But Ridge has betrayed all of them. Ridge accuses him it is back to that. Rick is the real son and Ridge isn't. He says little Ricky is embarrassed and hurt but he will be just fine. Eric says he hopes so for both of their sake. Hope tells Carter that she wants to be with Rick but she also understands that he wants to be alone. Carter tells her that Maya also has left the building. One guess where she is. She is with Rick. She would not miss that opportunity. Hope says she understands when a person feels like they should be with another, you do crazy things. Hope can't believe Caroline did this and with Ridge of all people. Ridge tells his dad that he could apologize and make them feel better but he is not. He lost who he was and Caroline helped him. Eric says he can not blame this all on work. Either one of them could have stopped the kissing.",
        "Caroline calls Rick. He tells her to stop calling. He does not want to talk to her or hear what happened. She asks if he is home. He looks at Maya and says no. Then she asks if he will meet her there and again he says no. Ridge tells her Rick needs time. Eric says he is not sure even time will do it. He sure knows that he may need more than time. They have given him a lot more to think about now. Caroline rails at Ridge for only worrying about the CEO position and here her marriage is falling apart. He tells her none of this would have happened if she did not confirm Maya's suspicions. Caroline asks Ridge if he was playing her. Was he just using her for his designs so he could be CEO. He admits yes he thought he could benefit. But he did not go home and brag or laugh about it to Katie. He says it is not a joke. He could not get the smell of her hair out of his head, but he should have stopped it and so could have she. But he hopes he has not messed it up for her. Rick knows what he has in Caroline. Little Ricky may be hurt right now but he is not stupid. What they had was pretty amazing. But the lines got blurred. And for the record the time they spent together was some of the most magical times of his life and he is sorry if he hurt her. Rick tells Maya that he should thank her for standing up for him and telling the truth. Caroline could have kept on lying and playing him for a fool. Maya said he had a right to know. With Caroline she is first and everyone else is an afterthought. Rick takes off his ring and says his marriage is over. Thank God he does not have a child. He pours himself a drink. Maya watches and moves closer and says she never stopped thinking of him not even when she was with Carter. She kisses him and says she loves him. She keeps kissing him as he guides her to the couch. She pulls him closer."

        "Rick: Were you following me?",
        "Maya: I just thought you'd be here -- scene of the crime.",
        "Rick: I keep picturing them... right there... their hands, their lips. You should just go.",
        "Maya: I'm not letting you go through this alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I have to find Rick. I-I need to explain to him --",
        "Eric: Leave him alone.",
        "Caroline: But he's so angry.",
        "Eric: Does that surprise you, after what the two of you did?",
        "Ridge: We kissed. That's it.",
        "Eric: She's your brother's wife. Don't try to downplay this.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: Was this to spite him and to just rub his face in what you knew you could take away from him?",
        "Ridge: What? No.",
        "Eric: Were you that afraid that he was gonna get the CEO job and you just wanted to hurt him?",
        "Ridge: What are you saying -- that I planned this, that we planned this? Dad, we're -- we're two passionate people, and -- and...",
        "Eric: [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: ...One thing led to another. It just -- passionate people, Dad. We're artists, and --",
        "Eric: Well, the other artist is your brother's wife! You have the maturity to walk away!",
        "Ridge: I've been more than mature about all of this! I'm still here! I didn't run away like a child!",
        "Eric: Not another word. Not another word! I can't imagine how Rick is feeling right now -- this betrayal by both of you. At least Caroline has the decency to feel horrible about this. You could at least pretend.",
        "Ridge: Okay. No, I do. I feel horrible --",
        "Eric: Look, you betrayed everyone here -- Rick and me. All these hours that the two of you were spending together, ostensibly for the betterment of the company, and all you were doing -- you hurt him. You betrayed me, and you betrayed him. Rick's my flesh and blood. When you hurt him, you hurt me.",
        "Ridge: And we're back. He's your real son, and I'm not, right?",
        "Eric: Don't play that card. You know I don't care about that. What I'm saying is that when you see your child suffer --",
        "Ridge: This is suffering?! Is he dying in your arms right now? I know what it's like to watch your child suffer. Little Ricky -- he's gonna be just fine. He's embarrassed, he's a little hurt, but he's gonna be just fine if he chooses to be fine.",
        "Eric: I hope so... for both of your sakes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Carter: Hanging in there?",
        "Hope: I'm trying. [Sighs] I don't know what to do. I want to be there for Rick. I want to help him. But...I guess I understand if he wants to be alone.",
        "Carter: Something's telling me he's not alone.",
        "Hope: Why?",
        "Carter: Maya left the building.",
        "Hope: You think she went after him?",
        "Carter: Knowing Maya?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I can't believe it. We were newly married. And Ridge. It happened here. This is where my marriage ended.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: There. Officially unfollowed.",
        "Carter: Caroline?",
        "Hope: Yeah. I really don't feel like looking at her selfies right now, and if she's gonna cheat on my brother, it's fine. I'll just hit her where it hurts.",
        "Carter: Oh, that's cold. You know it's not too late, right -- that she and Rick still have a chance?",
        "Hope: I don't know. You saw how hurt Rick was. Their marriage could be over. Oh, God! Why did Caroline have to do this -- and with Ridge?! With Ridge, of all people!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So, what is it? What do you want from me? You want me to admit that I made a mistake? I can do that. I could. But I don't want to. I got hurt, and I lost who I was. And Caroline helped me find that again. I could draw through her hands. She helped me.",
        "Caroline: We helped each other. I've never designed like that before.",
        "Eric: There were feelings. I understand that. But you both bear responsibility here. One of you could have stopped what was happening. I could have stepped in -- Felicia. There are a number of ways you could have finished this line without kissing your brother's wife! You can't blame this on work!",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: Is it Rick?",
        "Caroline: No. I have to call him. I-I need to try.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rick: Stop calling me. I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Caroline: No, please. Just give me a chance to explain.",
        "Rick: You don't have to explain anything. I understand what happened.",
        "Caroline: No, you don't, see. Where are you? Are you at home?",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Caroline: Can you meet me there?",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Caroline: Are you drinking? I can come pick you up. Do you need me to come pick you up?",
        "Rick: I'll be fine.",
        "Caroline: Rick, please don't hang up.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Caroline: He won't even let me try to explain.",
        "Ridge: Ah, he just needs time.",
        "Eric: I'm not sure time's gonna solve this for Rick. I'm not sure time's gonna solve this for me.",
        "Ridge: What does that mean?",
        "Eric: It means the two of you have given me a lot to think about today.",
        "Caroline: I can't believe this.",
        "Ridge: He's gonna reconsider.",
        "Caroline: Is that all you care about -- the CEO position?!",
        "Ridge: It's very clear he could change his mind.",
        "Caroline: I am talking about my marriage!",
        "Ridge: Shh. Now, why did you have to say anything?",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Ridge: Why did you feel that you had to confess?",
        "Caroline: Maya said it.",
        "Ridge: You confirmed it.",
        "Caroline: Because it was already out. I had to tell the truth! Rick thinks that you're conning me. Is that true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: So, you think Maya is with Rick right now?",
        "Carter: [Chuckling] She is. No doubt, man. That girl's not one to pass up an opportunity.",
        "Hope: She really never got over him?",
        "Carter: No.",
        "Hope: At least you found out before you got married.",
        "Carter: Clue number one should have been all the millions of ways she avoided planning the wedding.",
        "Hope: Oh.",
        "Carter: I don't know. I think she was just biding time, waiting for Rick and Caroline to implode.",
        "Hope: Well, implosion in progress.",
        "Carter: Maya didn't even know if Ridge and Caroline crossed the line. I mean, she suspected it, but it was her word against theirs. She gambled. If she'd been wrong, making accusations like that, they'd have fired her.",
        "Hope: Well... when you're in love and you really feel like you're supposed to be with someone, you -- you do crazy things. You take big risks.",
        "Carter: Paid off for Maya. She got exactly what she wanted. I'm not making excuses for Caroline and Ridge. I just wish it wasn't at their expense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Did you play me? The whole time that we were designing together, the connection we had -- were you just using me?",
        "Ridge: Yep. Of course I was. I couldn't draw. I needed your hands.",
        "Caroline: Deeper than that. Were you playing me?",
        "Ridge: I don't really know.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles] That means \"yes.\"",
        "Ridge: We were a great team, and we created something amazing. And I knew what it was doing to you. I knew how you felt emotionally and where this partnership was going. And I thought I could benefit from it, sure.",
        "Caroline: Was I just a joke to you? Did you go home to Katie and laugh about it -- the girl with the crush?",
        "Ridge: No, not at all.",
        "Caroline: Naive Caroline... making a big fool of herself.",
        "Ridge: You were never a joke to me. I'd be in my car after one of our sessions, and... I couldn't get the smell of your hair out of my head. That's not a joke. But I should have stopped this before it went too far, and, to be fair... you should have, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You know, I should thank you... for standing up for me, telling the truth.",
        "Maya: Are you sure?",
        "Rick: Yeah. I mean... she would have just kept on lying. She would have kept on playing me for a fool.",
        "Maya: You cannot keep torturing yourself.",
        "Rick: But my wife and Ridge!",
        "Maya: You had the right to know.",
        "Rick: But she would have never confessed. She would have -- she would have just kept on designing and fawning all over him and coming home as if I mattered.",
        "Maya: Oh, Rick, you do matter. I don't doubt that. It's just it's Caroline. And she always comes first, no matter what. Everybody else -- other people are just an afterthought to her.",
        "Rick: Yeah, even her husband. I should have never married her.",
        "Maya: She was -- she was at the right place at the right time when we were having trouble. [Voice breaking] And I understand why you fell for her. She's beautiful. And I'm sure she said all the right things.",
        "Rick: Maybe it was a safe choice. Forrester-Spencer, you know... it just seemed right. Thank God we didn't have a child. My marriage is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I hope I didn't mess this up for you.",
        "Caroline: It's like you said. We're both at fault.",
        "Ridge: Rick knows you love him.",
        "Caroline: What he knows is that I've been kissing you.",
        "Ridge: He'll come back.",
        "Caroline: You saw him leave. You saw how angry he was.",
        "Ridge: He's a hothead. He's always done that. He gets angry, he storms off, and then he blows off some steam and he comes back. He knows what he has in you.",
        "Caroline: How? I don't even know. I don't even know what I am to him now -- just some wife that he doesn't trust.",
        "Ridge: Trust comes back. And little Ricky is a lot of things, but he's not stupid. He's not gonna walk away from someone like you.",
        "Caroline: How could he stay... wondering when we're alone, designing together, if something more is happening?",
        "Ridge: Well, that's over now. We're not doing that anymore.",
        "Caroline: I know.",
        "Ridge: What we had, though, was pretty amazing. But we got carried away, and the lines got blurred. But Rick's been in this business a long time. He knows that sometimes things like that can happen. And for the record... the time we spent together -- those were some of the most magical moments of my life. And I didn't mean to hurt you. It wasn't my intention.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: All of our plans -- a family -- just didn't matter to her.",
        "Maya: I never stopped caring about you, Rick. Even when it seemed like I should give up, I couldn't. And I tried to move on with Carter, but I knew that it was going nowhere because the way that I feel about you, Rick... I-I love you. Ever since the first day that I met you at Dayzee's -- do you remember that? I thought you were a waiter, and I fell for you. I had no idea who you were. But Caroline was disappointing you even then. And that is why you turned to me. Turn to me now."
