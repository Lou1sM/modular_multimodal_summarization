        "From the office, Caroline frantically tries to call Rick who is lying asleep in a bed by Maya. She is thinking to herself she can not believe she is here. She thought she had lost him but never again after last night. Caroline asks Eric if he has heard from Rick as he is not returning her calls. Eric says he is not surprised after what was revealed. But Rick knows she is calling and he will call when he is ready. He needs time. Caroline says she can not sit by and give him that time before things get more complicated. Likewise Ridge tries to explain to Katie. It was not an affair but it was more than a kiss. She gets it, two artists who speak their own language, but is he making a fool of her.... for wearing that silly little red ribbon every day to remind her that Ridge loves her and they are meant to be together.

        "Caroline: Rick? Rick, it's me. Where are you? I've been texting you. I just left the house. Can you just call me back, please? I'm -- I'm at the office. Have you heard from him?",
        "Eric: No. No, I haven't.",
        "Caroline: Did you try calling him? 'Cause he won't answer me.",
        "Eric: For good reason, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: Okay, I know. I know I was an idiot. I can't believe I let this happen. I betrayed my husband. Getting drawn to Ridge... God.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Katie: Good morning.",
        "Ridge: Hey. You didn't wake me.",
        "Katie: Well, you got in so late last night, I couldn't wait up. Thought maybe we could celebrate or something. Congratulations, Mr. C.E.O.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Katie: How does it feel?",
        "Ridge: Not as good as I thought it would.",
        "Katie: Your dad put you in charge. I thought you'd be thrilled.",
        "Ridge: I should be thrilled, yes.",
        "Katie: Rick was upset.",
        "Ridge: Yes, he was. And I need to tell you why he was upset.",
        "Katie: Well, I know why. He wanted to be C.E.O., obviously.",
        "Ridge: When he didn't get it, Maya accused us, Caroline and me, of having an affair.",
        "Katie: You've got to be kidding. She said that in front of everyone at the meeting? [Scoffs] You know, this vendetta she has against Caroline, it has gone on way too long. It's out of control. I'm so sorry. I mean, that was your moment, and she stepped on it. She did the same thing to me. She came to me and she accused you of being involved with Caroline, which is ridiculous. Ridge?",
        "Ridge: We kissed. It's all it was, but we did. We kissed.",
        "Caroline: It wasn't an affair. Rick needs to understand that.",
        "Eric: It was duplicitous, and it was hurtful. Look, what you and Ridge did --",
        "Caroline: Shouldn't have happened. You know Maya. You know how she feels about me, how she feels about Rick. She wants our marriage to fail. That's why she made it sound so bad.",
        "Eric: There's nothing you can do about it right now.",
        "Caroline: I have to do something. Where is he?",
        "Maya: [Thinking] I can't believe it. I'm here. It's really happening.",
        "Rick: Maybe it was a safe choice. Forrester, Spencer. It just seemed right. Thank God we didn't have a child. My marriage is over.",
        "Caroline: It's not too late to fix this.",
        "Rick: Caroline, Rick knows that you're trying to get in touch with him, all right? When he's ready to talk, he'll call. He just needs some more time.",
        "Caroline: No, I can't -- I can't give him time. We have to resolve this before it gets even more complicated.",
        "Eric: With Ridge and Katie, you mean.",
        "Caroline: I don't want this to cause problems for them.",
        "Eric: I can't imagine that it won't.",
        "Caroline: If Katie just lets Ridge explain -- see, Rick won't let me explain. He won't listen.",
        "Eric: His wife got involved with another man. That's a very difficult thing to hear.",
        "Caroline: There is no excuse for what I did.",
        "Eric: Well, you're not the only one to blame. Ridge played a part in this, too.",
        "Katie: You said it was a crush.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Katie: But you weren't gonna play on her feelings for you because you don't manipulate people like that and you didn't need her.",
        "Ridge: It wasn't like that. I'm... [Sighs]",
        "Katie: Why don't you tell me what it was like?",
        "Ridge: It was working. We were collaborating. [Sighs] Katie, I was drawing again.",
        "Katie: But you ended it.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. I did. We're not working together anymore.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Ridge: You know why.",
        "Katie: Well, I-I thought I did, but maybe I was mistaken. Because now you've told me that you and Caroline have kissed, and I guess I'm just wondering if there's not more to it than that. Is there? Have you been making a fool out of me, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: No, don't. I don't want you thinking that.",
        "Katie: Because there is more to it, isn't there?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I had a chance to stop it. I could have made better choices, and...",
        "Katie: But you didn't.",
        "Ridge: No, I didn't. Collaborating together, it's -- it has... there's an intimacy that develops. And... did I get drawn in? Yeah, I did for a moment. It's not who I am. It's not who I want to be. What I want is you.",
        "Ridge: I love you. I do. Never changed.",
        "Katie: So, what happened didn't mean anything.",
        "Ridge: I'm concerned about what it means to us. And -- and this... and this thing, working with Caroline, that confusion has been dealt with.",
        "Katie: So, you and Rick and Caroline have worked it all out. No hard feelings, everything's fine.",
        "Ridge: I don't know. [Sighs] I don't know. And -- and I don't want to minimize any of this. I-I was wrong. I made a mistake. It was a lapse in judgment. And I take full responsibility for it. I've been a designer for so long. I know what it's like when you put two people in a room and they're creating things together and they're excited about a line, and -- and I should have put a stop to it. And I-I did not, and... all I can do is promise that it'll never happen again.",
        "Caroline: I won't blame this on Ridge.",
        "Eric: He allowed it to continue. He kept working with you.",
        "Caroline: Because I wouldn't let him stop. I thought that what we were doing was too important. Eric, you're a designer. You know what it's like. When -- when you're in the middle of something and -- and ideas are flowing, you can't just stop. We should've. I know that. But in the moment... nothing is more valuable to me than my -- my marriage, okay? So that's why I have to do something. I can't just sit around and wait for Rick to show up or for him to call me back. I-I have to find him.",
        "Maya: I thought I lost you. Now I'm here. And I will never lose you again.",
        "Ridge: The last thing I wanted was to hurt you in any way.",
        "Katie: I don't think you have any idea how much this hurts me.",
        "Ridge: We didn't have an affair.",
        "Katie: No, but it wasn't just a kiss, was it?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: But I shouldn't be upset. Because you and Caroline are -- are artists. You speak your own language. You can't help yourself because that's just the way you are. You got wrapped up in each other's talents.",
        "Ridge: I know how it sounds, but it was part of it.",
        "Katie: I'm not really sure I want to hear the other part.",
        "Ridge: Caroline and I crossed a line, and it didn't go any further than that.",
        "Katie: Is that supposed to make me feel better? Is that to reassure me? Because everything's fine now and there's nothing to worry about. Do you know how many times I've heard that? Do you know how many times I believed it and was wrong?",
        "Ridge: I'm telling you the truth. That's...",
        "Katie: You know, I tie this on my finger every morning. And I'm sure that there are a lot of people out there that think it's silly that I'm still doing it after all this time, but I don't care what they think because this -- this is supposed to remind me that you love me... ...and that we were meant to be together. I guess I'm not the one who needed reminding. Maybe I should have tied a string around your finger to remind you not to make out with your muse.",
        "Ridge: Katie, I --",
        "Katie: This had nothing to do with us, right, Ridge? It was just a little crush.",
        "Ridge: She's not a threat to our relationship.",
        "Katie: You don't think so? Was it just a ploy? You needed Caroline on your side so you could be C.E.O.? Because I'm not sure I really want to hear that, either. [Sighs] I-I-I don't get it. I just don't get it. How can such powerful, powerful men have such little control over themselves?",
        "Ridge: I'm not bill.",
        "Katie: No. No. Because you're so much better than him. Caroline was your brother's wife! But you needed her, and she was there for you. God, I thought you were different.",
        "Ridge: Stop.",
        "Katie: Why? Why do I keep making the same mistakes over and over again?!",
        "Ridge: That's not what this is. History is not repeating itself. I-I know why you think that way. But I'm here. And we're fine.",
        "Katie: No. No, we're not.",
        "Rick: Hey. [Clears throat]",
        "Maya: Good morning, sleepy head.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: French press, just the way you like it.",
        "Rick: Boy, could I use this. [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: I'll bet. Rick... I know yesterday was hard, but last night... it was...beautiful.",
        "Rick: I took my ring off.",
        "Maya: You did. I know it couldn't have been easy. You defended Caroline for so long.",
        "Rick: I don't want to talk about her.",
        "Maya: And we don't have to. Let's just -- let's just put that all behind us.",
        "Rick: Ridge and Caroline? Right under my nose. And my dad makes him C.E.O.?",
        "Maya: You don't deserve to be treated that way, and I couldn't let that happen. I couldn't let them get away with it.",
        "Rick: And they would have if you hadn't said anything.",
        "Maya: I had to. Even if they denied it. Ridge could have fired me. I didn't care. I knew something was going on. And I couldn't let them hide it.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Maya: Who --",
        "Rick: One guess.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Maya: Ignore it.",
        "Caroline: Oh, God. Rick, thank God I found you.",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah?",
        "Caroline: Is there suddenly no cell service up here? You can't return a text?",
        "Rick: I've got nothing to say to you.",
        "Caroline: I want you to know how sorry I am and how stupid I feel. I am your wife. I love you, and I-I broke your trust, and I will never do anything like that again. I promise. But you just have to let me explain. You just... what... what is this? What... why is she here? No. You didn't. You two didn't --",
        "Rick: I just have two words for you. Screw you."
