    "Recap": [
        "Zende tells Nicole this is not about Maya or even her dad. It's about the two of them. She wants him to be totally honest with her. If she carries her sister's baby will it be over for them? He admits he could never do that. Maya tells her dad that Nicole and Zende are on the same page. Julius is not so sure since he talked to Zende himself. Rick walks in and sees the situation but tells Julius they have an appointment with the fertility doctor. Quinn is giddy happy that Wyatt admits he is falling in love. She's come a long way from pushing Ivy in the Seine and she likes her. Thomas tells Ivy that a woman who doesn't know she is beautiful is refreshing. It's too bad, she would have sold a lot of merchandise if she had modeled the lingerie. He shows her a photo and reminds her they are not blood related. Pam and Charlie drag out all the decorations for the Halloween office party. Wyatt laments to his mother that Ivy is a keeper and she is totally devoted to him. Thomas comes on to Ivy more and she reminds him there is the question of Wyatt, that guy she is devoted to. He claims he does not see a ring. The doctor discusses the results of Nicole's tests. She declares Nicole to be in a clean bill of health so a perfect candidate. This is a very big undertaking and she wants to be sure all three are on the same page ..now for the next step.",
        "Julius catches Zende helping Pam and Charlie do the decorations. Julius says Nicole is being bamboozled into carrying that kid. Maya tells Nicole again that it is not too late to back out if she has any reservations at all. The doctor tells her they have been tracking her cycle and it is getting close to her ideal time to be fertile. Thomas questions Ivy more if she is seeing Wyatt, like sneaking off not just at the office. First Liam and now his brother. Wyatt walks in and asks if something is going on. Zende tells Julius that he and Nicole will be fine. Julius reminds him that in six months Nicole will be walking around with a bowling ball in her stomach so this is a bad decision for everybody except for Maya. Put a stop to this. Do not let Maya take this from the two of them. Nicole tells the doctor Zende was shocked at first but very supportive now. The doctor tells her that pregnancy does not correspond with stress and it will affect both of them."

        "Nicole: Dad -- what a piece of work.",
        "Zende: He cares about you, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, well, he should care about Maya, too.",
        "Zende: Yeah, he should. But this isn't about Maya or your dad, either.",
        "Nicole: He wants you to convince me not to be the surrogate for Maya.",
        "Zende: He thinks it'll be the end of our relationship if you do.",
        "Nicole: Is that what you think? I need you to be completely honest with me. If I carry my sister's baby... is it over for us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: You're taking advantage of your sister. You know she would make any sacrifice for you, including giving up the man that she loves.",
        "Maya: You're being dramatic. Nicole and Zende have spoken. They're on the same page.",
        "Julius: Want to bet? I had a little talk with Zende myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: So, you're having a good time and she makes you happy. You know what that sounds like to me?",
        "Wyatt: A relationship? Gee, Mom, yes -- we're having a relationship.",
        "Deacon: I think what your mother's trying to say is she's --",
        "Quinn: Oh, you're falling in love! I am so happy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: So...",
        "Ivy: Hmm?",
        "Thomas: ...Where you do get it?",
        "Ivy: Get what?",
        "Thomas: Your optimism.",
        "Ivy: Ohh. I definitely get that from my dad.",
        "Thomas: Mmm! You get your good looks from him, too?",
        "Ivy: No. I get those... [Chuckles] Were you about to pay me a compliment?",
        "Thomas: Wow. A woman who doesn't know she's beautiful. You know, that's really refreshing.",
        "Ivy: You are very good with the ladies, aren't you?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, come on. Don't act like you don't know you're beautiful. Lingerie model?",
        "Ivy: Was a lingerie model, for like a minute.",
        "Thomas: You know, it's too bad. You really would have sold a lot of merchandise.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: Idea, though.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm?",
        "Thomas: Maybe you should reconsider.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Oh.",
        "Pam: [Laughs]",
        "Carter: Pam, where have you been?",
        "Pam: Oh, we've been downstairs in storage.",
        "Carter: Well, I need these distributed.",
        "Pam: Okay. I'll get to it.",
        "Carter: What's all that?",
        "Charlie: Decorations for the party.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Carter: What party?",
        "Pam: \"What party\"? Dude! The Halloween party!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: What are you, the president of Ivy's fan club or something?",
        "Quinn: Oh, I admit I wasn't always big on the girl, but...",
        "Deacon: Hey, that -- that was back in the day.",
        "Wyatt: Back when she pushed her in the Seine!",
        "Quinn: No, no. That was way more about Liam than it was about Ivy, and we've come a long way since then! And apparently... so have you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: My modeling days are over, thank you very much.",
        "Thomas: That's a big mistake.",
        "Ivy: No. I think the big mistake was forcing your sister's hand. Using that video against her -- that was just -- it was stupid.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, well, I mean, Steffy doesn't really hold grudges, so...",
        "Ivy: Well, I hope not. I just want us all to get along. I mean, we're family.",
        "Thomas: Sort of technically not us.",
        "Ivy: No, right. Ridge and Taylor are your parents, and Ridge is technically Marone blood, not Forrester blood, so... we aren't related at all.",
        "Thomas: Which is why I have no problem envisioning you in this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You talked to Zende?",
        "Julius: Yes, and he assured me that he and I are on the same page.",
        "Maya: Is that what he said or what you told him to say?",
        "Julius: He is head over heels over your sister, but how are they supposed to get together if she's got your husband's baby in her belly?",

        "Vivienne: Where are you going?",
        "Rick: Doctor's appointment.",
        "Vivienne: What doctor?",
        "Rick: Fertility doctor. Nicole had some tests done. We're meeting her there to find out the results.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Please... don't hold back. I just need you to tell me how you're feeling.",
        "Zende: You know what I'm feeling, Nicole, and have been for a while.",
        "Nicole: I just need to ask again. If I become pregnant... Maya's surrogate... will you leave me?",
        "Zende: No. I could never do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Nicole?",

        "Zende: I want you, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: I'm here.",
        "Zende: No. That's not what I meant.",

        "[Chiming continues]",
        "Nicole: It's Maya. She's reminding me that she's picking me up. Um, I have a few things I've got to do before I go, and you should probably get going on helping Pam with the Halloween party.",
        "Zende: Right.",
        "Nicole: But first... I want you to promise me something. We can't...let this surrogacy thing come between us.",
        "Zende: We won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Charlie: This party's gonna be great, and it's my favorite holiday!",
        "Pam: Yeah. It's one of mine, too. But come on, Charlie. We -- we got to get decorating.",
        "Carter: Well, good luck, guys. Good luck.",
        "Pam: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Carter. You're coming with us. Meet me backstage, Charlie, and bring the boxes!",
        "Charlie: Okay.",
        "Pam: Come on! We need you!",
        "Charlie: Hi, there! Hey, listen, you want to help me with these? Little extra pay, you know. Well, maybe not.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, guys, this has been, like, tons of fun, but I got to get to work.",
        "Quinn: I meant it when I said I'm happy for you.",
        "Wyatt: Well, don't get ahead of yourself, okay? But you're right. She's a keeper, and she's totally committed to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: See, now, can you actually imagine me in something like this?",
        "Thomas: Oh, I have, many times.",
        "Ivy: Thomas!",
        "Thomas: What? Come on. You're smokin' hot. Give me a break.",
        "Ivy: Look, it's just you flirt with every single girl you come across, so I'm not quite sure if I should be flattered or insulted.",
        "Thomas: Right now I am only seeing one girl. Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: That's me.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. It's just, um... have you forgotten about someone -- maybe Wyatt, that guy that I'm very happy with? Do you remember?",
        "Thomas: Oh, right, right, right, right -- Wyatt. Yeah. No. I can't flirt with you because of the wedding ring on your --",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: Oh. Because of the engagement ring on your -- hmm.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",

        "Dr. March: How is everyone?",
        "Rick: Great!",
        "Maya: We're very excited.",
        "Dr. March: And you, Nicole?",
        "Nicole: I feel honored to be doing this for my sister and her husband.",
        "Maya: And Rick and I couldn't be more grateful.",
        "Dr. March: Why don't we all sit down? Nicole, why don't you take that stool there? And we can discuss your test results from the screening. So, your Chem panel, vitals -- everything looks normal. The infectious-disease exam shows no contagion. Pap smear is negative, and your uterine lining shows no abnormalities, so, in short, you have a clean bill of health to be a surrogate.",
        "Maya: That's wonderful.",
        "Rick: Yeah. One step closer.",
        "Maya: And the psychological evaluations?",
        "Dr. March: Well, they were signed and sent back, so I assume they went well. Nicole, how did you feel about it?",
        "Nicole: Well, the doctor explained that, typically, a surrogate has had children before, which, obviously, I haven't.",
        "Dr. March: Are you okay with that?",
        "Nicole: I understand the concerns. There's no guarantees with any pregnancy.",
        "Dr. March: There could be potential complications.",
        "Maya: Though that's unlikely, right?",
        "Dr. March: True, but we just need to be sure that Nicole knows exactly what she's taking on. There are other avenues.",
        "Rick: And we've discussed those. Adoption would be great.",
        "Maya: Or we could find a gestational carrier.",
        "Nicole: Doc, they haven't once tried to convince me to do this. Rick and Maya have a very unique relationship, as you know... and they want a Forrester- Avant baby carried by me. I want to do this for them.",
        "Dr. March: I know you do, Nicole. But as your doctor, I just need to make sure that, you know, you've thought it through and that you're all on the same page. This is a very big undertaking.",
        "Nicole: I realize that, and, um...I'm ready to do my part.",
        "Dr. March: Well, if that's the case, everything is in order for the next step.",
        "Nicole: Let's do this.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",

        "Charlie: Oh, wow! Oh, there she is.",
        "Pam: Hello.",
        "Charlie: Hi.",
        "Pam: Oh, good.",
        "Julius: Hey. Any work going on in this building?",
        "Carter: Apparently not.",
        "Pam: And are we stressing over it?",
        "Julius: Apparently not. Hey, uh... you got a minute?",
        "Zende: Yeah. Sure. What's up?",
        "Julius: I'll tell you what's up -- your girlfriend is being bamboozled by her sister, who could care less about her happiness.",
        "Zende: Look, Mr. Avant, I really don't want to --",
        "Julius: Zende, Rick and Maya -- they're good. They got each other. Why should you and Nicole be deprived of that? And you will be if she carries that kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. March: First off, let's make sure everyone understands their roles.",
        "Maya: Well, mine's easy -- take care of my sister.",
        "Dr. March: That's a very important part.",
        "Nicole: It's already all been explained to us. We talked with the psychologist and the lawyer, so...",
        "Dr. March: Any questions with that?",
        "Nicole: Nope.",
        "Dr. March: So, you've really thought it all through?",
        "Nicole: Yes, absolutely. But...",
        "Dr. March: But?",
        "Nicole: ...It's just, um, completing all the tests and getting the results back -- it's becoming...very real for me.",
        "Dr. March: But you still want to do it, right?",
        "Nicole: Oh, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Maya: Nicole, it's not too late to back out.",
        "Nicole: Maya, stop.",
        "Maya: No. I need you to hear me out. We only want you to do this if you are completely comfortable, so if you have any doubts at all, you have no obligation to me and Rick. You know that, right?",
        "Nicole: Yes. So, what's next?",
        "Dr. March: Well, as you know, we've been tracking your cycle.",
        "Nicole: So that you know when my eggs are ready for...",
        "Dr. March: Insemination. Right.",
        "Nicole: Yeah.",
        "Dr. March: So, we will take a specimen from Rick and inseminate directly into the uterus.",
        "Maya: And when might that be?",
        "Dr. March: Well, uh... let's see. Judging from your chart, you're getting very close to the ideal time. In fact, we can make an appointment for you today on your way out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: So, what's the deal with you and Wyatt? Are you guys, like, dating?",
        "Ivy: I don't even know what that term means.",
        "Thomas: Do you guys see each other every day?",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah, because we work in the same building.",
        "Thomas: No, no, no. Do you see each other? Do you, like, sneak off to the janitor's closet -- that sort of thing?",
        "Ivy: [Laughs] No. I try and stay away from the janitor's closet because I'm scared you'll be in there.",
        "Thomas: Oh. If I knew you were coming, I would totally be there. Ohh. Okay. So, you like the guy. First Liam, now his brother. You know, it's a good thing Will isn't old enough to date.",
        "Ivy: Oooh!",
        "Thomas: Oooh. You do know marrying him, though, would mean Quinn as a mother- in-law, right?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Yeah, but, you know, Quinn and I -- we're a lot cozier these days. And marriage isn't even in the cards for us. I'm legal. I can live here.",
        "Thomas: Oh, right. You only marry a Spencer when you need a green card.",
        "Ivy: Oooh.",
        "Thomas: Oooh. Ow. Good news for me, though.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Why? You're glad that I don't have to be deported?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Saves me a lot of flying back and forth to Australia.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles]",

        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Something going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Am I interrupting something?",
        "Thomas: Oh, no. We were just talking about the Bedroom Line. Ivy changed her mind.",
        "Ivy: Uh, Thomas!",
        "Thomas: What?",
        "Ivy: No! Obviously, I didn't.",
        "Thomas: No. I heard she was a huge hit.",
        "Ivy: That's impossible! Where did you hear that? I was so nervous!",
        "Thomas: No, no, no. I've seen the test shots. I have to disagree.",
        "Wyatt: Are you campaigning?",
        "Thomas: For what?",
        "Wyatt: For Ivy to be a lingerie model.",
        "Ivy: Well, if nominated, I will not run, and if elected, I will not serve, because my days as a lingerie model are over.",
        "Thomas: Too much of a lady for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: [Chuckles] Charlie, that's so much candy!",
        "Charlie: What are you talking about? It's Halloween!",
        "Pam: You've got enough candy here to keep every dentist in town busy.",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah. Well, you know, it's trick-or-treat, Pammy, and I opted for...treat. [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: Nicole and I will be fine.",
        "Pam: Hey.",
        "Julius: Zende... you haven't thought this thing through. In six months, your girlfriend's gonna be walking around with a bowling ball in her stomach. That's gonna put a damper on things, right?",
        "Zende: I'll be there to support her.",
        "Julius: You don't have to be there to support her. Just tell her not to do it, plain and simple.",
        "Zende: I did.",
        "Julius: When?",
        "Zende: When the idea first came about. Look, it doesn't matter anymore, okay? Nicole is set on giving Maya a child. I have to respect that.",
        "Julius: You don't have to. It's a bad decision. It's bad for you. It's bad for Nicole. It's bad for everybody except Maya. Zende, please, don't let her ruin my little girl's life. Put a stop to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Wow. It's, um...really happening.",
        "Rick: Well, now that we've cleared all the preliminary steps, how long does it normally take?",
        "Dr. March: Well, the percentage of women who become pregnant after one cycle of intrauterine insemination ranges between 10% and 20%.",
        "Nicole: So, we're talking, what, a year?",
        "Dr. March: That's a realistic amount of time, but, depending on how long it takes you to become pregnant, it could be longer. Last time you mentioned a boyfriend.",
        "Nicole: Yes. Um, we've recently started dating.",
        "Dr. March: How does he feel about this?",
        "Nicole: Uh, he was definitely shocked at first, um... but he's trying to be supportive.",
        "Dr. March: If this young man is important to you...",
        "Nicole: He is. He's very important. I've never felt like this about anyone.",
        "Dr. March: ...Then he's going to play a significant role.",
        "Nicole: How?",
        "Dr. March: Pregnancy does not mix with stress. You are going to need the unqualified support of everyone you're close to, especially this young man. This is not only going to affect your life, it's going to affect his, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Listen, you're being unrealistic. Think about Nicole, big as a house, with Rick's child. Tell me that's not gonna send you heading for the hills. Listen, I know my daughter, and she cares a lot about you. Please, don't let Maya take that from the two of you."
