        "Brooke tells Hope that this whole night seems like a nightmare but she should be at the cabin with Liam and Beth. Brooke says she did not want to take off her rings but Ridge gave her no choice. Ridge is embraced in a lip lock with Shauna both finding themselves in the Forrester guest house. Thomas thanks Eric for letting him stay there. Eric says he and Douglas are family so they are welcome here any time. Eric says Douglas is an exceptional little boy and Eric's only concerns is how Thomas was acting. Thomas interrupts and says he only did those things out of love. He still loves Hope. Shauna apologizes for the way she looks in the mask which some pieces are still attached and her old pajamas, she is going to burn. And then she will kill Quinn for not telling her about others on the premises. She is so embarrassed for standing there in front of him of all people. Ridge says Quinn did not know. She asks why he moved out of his house to here. He tells her about the adoption papers and she is sorry. He says he wants his marriage and his wife but not at the expense of his son. Thomas explains to Eric that he wanted a mother for Douglas and Hope was that mother he wanted. He still does. Hope gets a call from Douglas who wants to tell her good night. He'd like to come home but his dad says he can't. He misses her and she repeats it to him. She says if he ever feels alone or scared he can touch his heart and know she will always be there. They both say they love each other. She then tells Brooke this boy is like her son so she has to get custody of him. She thinks it over and tells Brooke perhaps there is some way to protect Douglas and get custody like she wants. Shauna tells Ridge that she and Brooke are not that different. They both came from homes with no money. Shauna says she had a tiny little boutique in a casino and Brooke took shortcuts too when she married Ridge.",
        "Hope tells her mom that she might think this is crazy but she knows how much Thomas still loves her and if she is careful and pretends this might work out. He might sign the adoption papers. Douglas is vulnerable but worth the effort. She loves Liam and Beth of course, but she has to do this for Douglas. Brooke is more skeptical since Hope can barely stand to even talk to Thomas now, much less be around him. Ridge tells Shauna not to take this the wrong way but Brooke used to have this mischievous twinkle in her eye but he has not seen that in a long time. She asks which one is going to leave. He replies no one. She wonders if he wants a redo of the Bikini night. He says no, he did not even remember that. What he needs now is a friend. She says she can be his friend if that is what he wants. But she has been told she has assets that might distract one and then there is her sexy pajamas. He quips that he will take his chances. Hope reminds Brooke once again that Thomas is not fit to be a parent and she has to keep Douglas out of harm's way. Thomas thinks of his wedding to Hope and calls her on the pretext of letting her know that Douglas is settled in and in bed already. He makes it quick and says good night. She is delighted and tells Brooke that she is positive that Thomas still loves her and she can tap into those emotions and try to change his mind and he will sign the adoption papers. It's a risk but she can be careful and not even let Liam or Steffy know. It's a huge secret but Douglas is worth it. It will work, it has to work!"

        "Brooke: Honey, you don't have to worry about me. You should be down there with liam and beth.",
        "Hope: Beth is asleep, and I will be with them soon enough.",
        "Brooke: This whole night seems like a nightmare, the way ridge and thomas barged in here and dragged douglas out of here, a nice, loving, warm home that you and liam provided for him.",
        "Hope: It's heartbreaking to think that I won't be able to tuck him in tonight and to read him his favorite bedtime story, to listen to him say his prayers. It just... it feels wrong.",
        "Brooke: I know. It's terrible. The worst part is how ridge reacted. He doesn't want to believe that his son is disturbed. I keep trying to tell him, but there's no point. I didn't want to take off my ring and give it back to ridge. But he gave me no choice.",
        "Thomas: Oh. Hi, granddad.",
        "Eric: Thomas, how was your workout?",
        "Thomas: It was good. It's nice having the gym right here in the house.",
        "Eric: Yes, I like that.",
        "Thomas: I--I have to thank you again for letting us stay here. I owe you big time.",
        "Eric: No, no. That's enough of that. You're my grandson, and you and-- you and douglas are family. This house is yours any time you need it. How is the little one? Is he settling in okay upstairs?",
        "Thomas: Oh, yeah. He should be asleep right now.",
        "Eric: Thomas, you know, he's, um... he's an exceptional little boy.",
        "Thomas: Yes. And he deserves an exceptional father, which I have not been.",
        "Eric: Thomas, you're my grandson. I love you. I support you. And my only concerns were the way you behaved...",
        "Thomas: You should. You should have concerns. I did things that I never would have imagined myself doing. As misguided as it was, given all the extremes that I went to... I did it all out of love. Yeah, I, uh... no matter what anybody thinks, I still do love hope.",
        "Hope: Mom.",
        "Brooke: Ridge is my life. And to have it come to this, all because of thomas...",
        "Hope: But giving up on your marriage, though?",
        "Brooke: No, no. I haven't given up on my marriage. I just had to do something so ridge knows how serious I am.",
        "Hope: I know that, and I love that you are fighting for douglas and wanting to protect him, but... are you sure you haven't pushed ridge too far?",
        "Shauna: Did I accidentally bite your lip?",
        "Ridge: That wouldn't be the worst thing.",
        "Shauna: Was it the face masque?",
        "Ridge: This one?",
        "Shauna: Oh, my god. There are still pieces? That is so--",
        "Ridge: This stuff is weird.",
        "Shauna: I know. It's embarrassing, though. The only thing worse would be you catching me, like, in curlers or something.",
        "Ridge: So you have curlers as well? What else?",
        "Shauna: No. You know what I mean. No woman in her right mind would want to be caught looking like this, especially by a man like you. I could kill quinn.",
        "Ridge: For what?",
        "Shauna: For not warning me that this could happen.",
        "Ridge: All right. In her defense, quinn didn't know that douglas and thomas and i were gonna be here. She would be as surprised as...",
        "Shauna: Um, both of us.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. [ Shauna chuckles ] And listen, you want flo to have some time, and you just were sleeping here. It...makes sense.",
        "Shauna: Yeah, but-- but, you know, if I had any idea that, um, that you... [ Chuckles ] That we would've... uh, well, you know. [ Chuckles ] I'm gonna burn these pajamas.",
        "Ridge: Don't do that. You never know when you're gonna move to florida.",
        "Shauna [ Laughing ]: Stop. I would have just been a little bit more prepared.",
        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "Shauna: You know. So is your marriage really over?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. It's--it's complicated. Um, I'm not sure what-- what is what, and I'm not gonna lay all that on you.",
        "Shauna: I told you that I would always be there for you. And I am.",
        "Shauna: I feel ridiculous. I have seen you on hundreds of magazines. You're this deliciously talented, amazing ridge forrester.",
        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "Shauna: And here you are, and here I am... [ Chuckles ] Face masque, looking ridiculous in these pajamas. I'm just so embarrassed. You know what? I am just gonna stick this on my head because I can't even look at you after you catching me like this. Don't laugh.",
        "Ridge: I'm not. Hey.",
        "Shauna: It's embarrassing.",
        "Ridge: Hey, where'd you go? Hi.",
        "Shauna: I'm in here.",
        "Ridge: I'm not laughing at you.",
        "Shauna: I'm embarrassed, though.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Don't be. Just I was laughing at this situation, us being here like this.",
        "Shauna: Well, I swear I had no idea that you were gonna come by here.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I didn't know that, either. Ahem.",
        "Shauna: Ahem. With both of your rings off, does that have anything to do with thomas?",
        "Ridge: Brooke had adoption papers drawn up. She wanted hope and liam to take thomas' boy away from him.",
        "Shauna: What?",
        "Ridge: I don't understand. I--I can't wrap my head around that this is my wife, my partner. And my boy, my little boy. How do you...",
        "Shauna: I am so sorry.",
        "Ridge: Me, too. I want my marriage, and I want my wife. But not at the expense of my son.",
        "Thomas: If only we had do-overs in life, things would be so different. I would be so different.",
        "Eric: As a father, you mean.",
        "Thomas: I wanted... my son to have a mother, and hope is the mother I wanted for him. I still do.",
        "Hope: Why don't you call ridge? Or you could go over there.",
        "Brooke: Why? He'll just justify again what he's done. In the meantime, there's a little boy who--",
        "[ Phone rings ]",
        "Hope: Oh, it's douglas.",
        "Brooke: Oh.",
        "[ Phone beeps ]",
        "Hope: Hi, douglas. Hi, sweetie.",
        "Douglas: Hi, mommy. Can I still call you that?",
        "Hope: Of course you can. Why are you still up?",
        "Douglas: To say good night.",
        "Hope: I wanted to say good night to you, too. That's so sweet, honey. Actually, there is someone else here who wants to wish you a good night, hon. Ahh. Look who it is. [ As peanut butter ] Hello. I was just about to head to bed meself.",
        "Douglas: Sweet dreams, peanut butter. Hope [ As peanut butter ]: Sweet dreams to you, too, sir. Mwah.",
        "[ Hope giggles ]",
        "Douglas: I want you to be my mommy, hope.",
        "Hope: Oh, douglas.",
        "Douglas: I like being at great-granddad's, but I want to come home.",
        "Hope: Did you tell your dad that?",
        "Douglas: I told him that I want to be with you and beth, but he says I can'T. I missed you.",
        "Hope: I miss you, too, but we are always going to be together, even when we're apart. How about this? Can you do something for me?",
        "Douglas: Sure.",
        "Hope: All right. If you are ever feeling alone or scared, go on and touch your heart right here and know that I'm always going to be here with you. Can you do that? Okay. Good. Sweet dreams, honey. I love you.",
        "Douglas: I love you, too.",
        "[ Phone beeps off ]",
        "Hope: I can't take this. He wants to come home, and I--I am a mother to him, and he is like my son, so I need custody of him.",
        "Brooke: I know, but if thomas won't agree...",
        "Hope: You know, if ridge hadn't intervened, but... what if...",
        "Brooke: What if what?",
        "Hope: What if there was a way to protect douglas and a way for me to still be his mom? Great riches will find you when liberty mutual",
        "Shauna: I honestly don't understand brooke. For her to manipulate you. Your son needs you, and from everything you've told me, he needs his little boy, too.",
        "Ridge: Thomas loves douglas. He wants to be there for him.",
        "Shauna: And you love both of them very much. You don't want to see a father and his son separated. And that's very admirable.",
        "Ridge: Not to brooke.",
        "Shauna: You know, brooke and I weren't so different before she got involved with the forresters. Neither one of us came from money. You know, I was a single working mom. Owned a tiny little boutique in a casino. It was very challenging, but, you know, I did it because I had to. You know, and brooke, she took a shortcut when she married you. You know, you gave her a life that she's never lived before. And for her to give all of that up? I mean, all I can say is, if it were me, I would gladly spend my days marveling at your talent and making sure you are a very, very happy man.",
        "Hope: I feel like I was so close to convincing thomas to sign those adoption papers to give me full custody because he knows that I'm a wonderful mother to his son. But then, you know, ridge intervened and stopped thomas from doing the right thing.",
        "Brooke: Ridge thinks that douglas belongs with his father, no matter what thomas does.",
        "Hope: But what if I could work around that? What if I could find a way to work around ridge?",
        "Brooke: What are you saying exactly?",
        "Hope: What if I spent time with thomas and douglas like the family that he wants us to be? I mean, I can maybe eventually convince him to sign the papers and give me custody.",
        "Brooke: What are you suggesting? I mean, spending time alone with thomas, and you can barely even speak to him.",
        "Hope: I know. But this is for douglas. And besides, I really do believe that thomas is still hoping that I might eventually forgive him for everything he did to me, that the life that he wanted with me is...",
        "Brooke: You're not gonna have a life with thomas. You have a life with liam.",
        "Hope: But what if I... could maybe convince him that it's still a possibility?",
        "Brooke: By playing on his obsession with you?",
        "Hope: If I play into that, maybe I can get him to sign the papers. I mean no, it's not gonna happen overnight, but I'm gonna have to be really convincing and really careful, but thomas is vulnerable when it comes to me. Look, I don't want a life with him. I love liam. I love beth. That's who I care about. But I need to do this for douglas, mom. I need to keep him out of harm's way, and I don't see any other way to do this. I have to. Copd makes it hard to breathe.",
        "Shauna: Well, here's the thing. I have met a lot of men in my life, and nobody comes close to you. Your--your talent, your commitment to your family. Okay, your good looks.",
        "Ridge: [ Laughs ]",
        "Shauna: If women still swooned-- do women still swoon?",
        "Ridge: Okay, I don't know if they--I don't know. Don't take this the wrong way, but brooke used to have this... mis-mischievous twinkle in her eye when she looked at me. And I haven't seen that in a very long time. But I see it when you look at me, and I think that's very nice, so...",
        "Shauna: It's getting late. Who's gonna leave?",
        "Ridge: Nobody's leaving.",
        "Shauna: Oh. You want to have a repeat from the night above bikini?",
        "Ridge: I don't even remember that night. You know what I need right now? I need you to be my friend.",
        "Shauna: I can do that. I can be your friend... if you can handle it.",
        "Ridge: If I can handle it?",
        "Shauna: Yeah. Yeah I--I've been told that some of my assets might be a distraction.",
        "Ridge: Assets?",
        "Shauna: Yes. And my sexy pajamas.",
        "Ridge: Oh, yeah. No, I know all this stuff you hide behind that golden mask of yours, yet I don't, uh... even notice that.",
        "Shauna: And I want you to know that I am not gonna take advantage of you. I know you're dealing with a lot. You need friendship, tenderness. I can give you that.",
        "Brooke: I realize you want to do this for all the right reasons, but...",
        "Hope: Douglas wants to be with me, not thomas. Yes, he loves his father, but as of right now, thomas is not fit to be a parent, the way he's been acting. I mean, I've seen firsthand how unstable he is and...",
        "[ Phone rings ] [ Ring ] It's thomas. [ Ring ] Ahem. Thomas, why are you calling?",
        "Thomas: Hope, hey, yeah. I, um, I know it's late. I just wanted you to know douglas has settled in here. I know it was hard on you when I took him, but I hope you understand I just--I had to do it.",
        "Hope: You have no idea.",
        "Thomas: I don't want to hurt you. I never want to hurt you again.",
        "Hope: Um... it's late. I understand. I, uh, I just had to call. Good night.",
        "[ Phone beeps off ]",
        "Hope: Do you see? The tone of his voice? I mean, mom, I think he still loves me.",
        "Brooke: He's obsessed with you, you mean. Hope!",
        "Hope: No, I can do this, mom. I can. I just-- I need him to open up to me. I can--if I can get him to trust me again, then...",
        "Brooke: Okay, well, what would you say to liam?",
        "Hope: I wouldn't say anything to liam. Liam, ridge, steffy, they can never know.",
        "Brooke: Oh, boy. You're talking about keeping a huge secret.",
        "Hope: I know. But this is for douglas' sake. I am a mother to beth, thank god. But I'm a mother now to douglas, too, and--and I want to keep him out of harm's way. He's my little hero. He was the only one that told the truth about beth to me. I mean, he went up against his own father and saved me from all of that despair and that grief, and so I am going to save him from thomas. Mom, I have to do this. I mean, I think we'd regret it if we didn'T. We're talking about a child's future. So I am going to convince thomas. I'm going to tap into his emotions for me and try to get him to give me custody. It will work. It has to work."
