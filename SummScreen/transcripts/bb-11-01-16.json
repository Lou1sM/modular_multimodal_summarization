{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7454 ~ Wyatt blows the whistle on Brooke & Ridge's plan to a stunned Quinn & Eric; deeply hurt by Nicole's disregard for his feelings, Zende plans an impromptu trip with Sasha."], "Recap": ["Rick can't thank Nicole enough for her agreeing again to be their surrogate. They hug. She confides in him that Zende walked out and it was her fault. She had agreed with him she would not do this again but she changed her mind. She loves Zende and she knows he is upset right now. He loves her too and the woman he loves has to do this. He just needs to blow off some steam and he will return. Zende comes on strong to Sasha but she pulls away and says she cannot do this to her sister. He says Nicole does not care. Not only did she do this one time, but twice. He cannot keep waiting around for her to have kids for Rick and Maya. He is tired. It is time for him to be a man, a Forrester man. He makes a quick phone call and then tells Sasha that they are going to Hawaii. Eric is well enough to come downstairs and sits at the piano and starts tickling the keys. She tells him she knows he is going to come all the way back. Wyatt comes in and tells them there was no wedding. Eric says he knew Ridge was still in love with Brooke. Wyatt says there is more. He is not sure Eric should hear this but Eric insists. Wyatt says Ridge was planning a coup to take over FC. He fills them in on the plan with Bill giving Brooke his shares. Eric is livid that Ridge begged to be POA all the while knowing he was going to do this. Quinn says Ridge failed but maybe he learned something so Eric needs to take a breath. She says this is his CEO talking. She and Wyatt will handle this and Eric does not have to worry about it.", "Rick and Nicole hug again and she says she is sure Zende will stay mad for a while, but he will come back to her. Sasha tells Zende that he knows how she feels about him, but she cannot be his rebound again. She cannot do this to her sister again. He says this time he is breaking up with Nicole, so it won't be the same. Maybe Nicole is too serious for him. With Sasha there is no complications and all he is asking her to do is fly off to Hawaii with him, they can have fun. Quinn tells Wyatt they have a lot of work to do with a big fashion show coming up. Eric says he knows they can handle it. He is very grateful that Wyatt is here now. He needs him. Wyatt says for now he will stay and they will see how that goes. Eric tells Quinn that he knows Ridge will not stop and will keep trying this so Eric has to come back strong now and keep the company. Quinn says she is so looking forward to her husband doing just that. Sasha cannot get over that here she is on a jet, more than that a private Forrester jet. Nicole calls Zende and says she is home now and would like to talk. He says there is no reason. She is having another baby. She says they can work this out. He admits he loves her but hangs up. At the last minute Sasha says perhaps they should not go, it is not too late for him to go home and work this out. It is his decision as to what he wants to do."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Quinn: Look at you! Out of bed and downstairs.", "Eric: Look at me.", "Quinn: Mmm. There you go. [Sighs] Yeah, it's so good to see you out and about.", "Eric: Almost, huh?", "Quinn: You know what, you got a ways to go, but you, mister, are improving. I'm gonna get you a glass of water. I'm telling you, this is a day that I have been praying for. I know you're probably laughing. Quinn, praying? But, yeah, I do. I pray. And I've been praying for you to get better and just --", "[Piano plays]", "Quinn: Oh! Eric! It's wonderful! Come on. Come on.", "[Music stops]", "Quinn: No! What?", "Eric: This is terrible.", "Quinn: What, my dancing?", "Eric: No. No. The -- this.", "Quinn: Oh. No, no, no, no, no. The fact that you're even playing at all is marvelous. It shows that you're making so much progress. You are gonna come back. 100%. To the business, to dancing with me. You're gonna be everything you were before all of this happened.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: We seriously can't thank you enough.", "Nicole: Maya gave this to you?", "Rick: That's how she told me.", "Nicole: Precious.", "Rick: Yeah, that's the same word that we've used to describe you. You're giving us another baby. Thank you, Nicole. Thank you. I want to thank Zende. Where is he?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: Wait, no. Zende. I'm sorry. We can't -- we can't do this. You're with my sister.", "Zende: Am I? She doesn't even want me.", "Sasha: That's not true. How can you even say that?", "Zende: Look at what she's doing, Sasha! She tells me she loves me and then does what's best for her sister. Not once, but twice.", "Sasha: Look, okay. Um... let's get out of here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I'm not sure where Zende is.", "Rick: I thought you guys were going to the Forrester party.", "Nicole: We were.", "Rick: So, he's waiting for you over there, or...?", "Nicole: I doubt it.", "Rick: You told him about being the surrogate. He's upset.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: [Scoffs] We're supposed to be at the party.", "Sasha: Zende, I know you're upset with my sister. You're hurting, and I-I'm here for you, but... what just happened downstairs, as much as I want that, I know you don't.", "Zende: It doesn't matter what I want. Not to Nicole.", "Sasha: [Sighs]", "Zende: Why would she do that? You know -- have another baby? We're supposed to be a couple, you know? We're supposed to make decisions together, do things together! I mean, isn't that what being in love is all about?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Pretty soon, you're gonna have physical therapy, and then we'll be able to go on walks together, and then bike rides together. We'll bike ride --", "Eric: Stop. You're wearing me out.", "[Cell phone chimes]", "Quinn: [Laughs] You're gonna have plenty of time to rest and -- oh, it's Wyatt. He keeps telling me he wants to talk to me, but he doesn't want to intrude, so...", "Eric: Tell him to come in. He lives here.", "Quinn: I know, that's exactly what I just said to him. I said, \"come on in,\" but I don't know.", "Wyatt: Hey.", "Quinn: Oh! Were you just standing outside the door?", "Wyatt: Pretty much, yeah. Eric! You're out of bed! That's -- that's great!", "Quinn: He certainly is! And he gave me a little mini concert.", "Eric: Yeah, I tried.", "Quinn: Mm-hmm. So, how was the wedding?", "Wyatt: Wedding didn't happen. Ridge showed up.", "Quinn: Oh, no.", "Eric: Still loves Brooke.", "Wyatt: Yeah. But there's more. Listen, mom, can I, uh, maybe talk to you about this upstairs?", "Quinn: Why? Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Eric.", "Wyatt: Okay, well, Eric, you might not want to hear this, but you should. There's no easy way to say it. Ridge was -- ridge was planning a coup, a hostile takeover of Forrester creations.", "Wyatt: But that was the plan. Dad marries Brooke, he gives her his shares of Forrester as a wedding present.", "Quinn: And then she hands them over to ridge.", "Wyatt: And with dad's shares, he would have had the controlling interest of the company.", "Eric: Ridge was so... deceitful. He begged me for power of attorney. He was so sincere.", "Wyatt: And all the while, he knew that if it didn't work...", "Eric: He had a plan B. A takeover. Who else knew?", "Wyatt: I don't know. Maybe Steffy? Rick?", "Eric: Everyone who had shares. They're all against me. All of them.", "Quinn: No. No! Don't you go there. Ridge failed. Maybe -- maybe he learned something, okay? Let's just all take a moment, all right, and just breathe.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: I'm so sorry.", "Nicole: Please. Don't be. It was my decision.", "Rick: Can I ask you how upset he is?", "Nicole: He walked out on our conversation.", "Rick: [Sighs]", "Nicole: But it's my fault. I told him that I would never be a surrogate again, and that's what we agreed on. But after talking with my sister... ...holding Lizzy. Looking into those little eyes. Anyway. It just overcame me. The bond that Maya and I share. How much I look up to her. There's nothing else like it in life. And when I was holding Lizzy, I wanted that for her. I want her to experience that closeness, that sharing. And that's when I knew what I had to do.", "Rick: But your relationship with Zende...", "Nicole: I love him. And, yes, he's upset right now. And I understand that. But Zende loves me, rick. The woman I am. And the woman I've become has to do this.", "Rick: There's one thing that I know for sure. He'll never, ever find another woman like you.", "Nicole: That's what I'm hoping. He just needs to blow off some steam, and eventually, he'll accept this. Like he did the first time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Maya's needs come first with Nicole -- always.", "Sasha: That's not true. Yes, Nic should be more responsive to your needs, but Zende, come on.", "Zende: Hold on. Wait. Can we get real here for a minute?", "Sasha: Sure.", "Zende: Nicole has agreed to have another baby for rick and Maya. I'm not expected to wait around while she keeps having kids for them!", "Sasha: But you love her, Zende. I, above everyone, know you love my sister.", "Zende: You know, I want to quote a clich\u00e9 I hate. \"Love ain't always enough.\" Look. I'm tired, Sasha. The first time, you know what? I should have been more supportive, but I beat myself up over that more than enough times. This time? No! It's too much. It's time for me to stop treading water and act like a man. A Forrester man.", "Sasha: What are you doing?", "Zende: You look good tonight. Anybody tell you that? Hey, Jeremy. It's Zende. What's the schedule looking like? Oh, perfect! I need it. Yeah, tonight. Stock it with pineapple, macadamia nuts, and the best rum you can find. Flight plan? Yeah. Hawaii. We'll be at the airport soon. You ever been to Hawaii?", "Sasha: [Laughing] What?", "Zende: That's where we're headed.", "Sasha: Z-Zende, I -- I can't go to Hawaii with you. You're dating my sister.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Wyatt and I are gonna handle this. I don't want you thinking about anything.", "Wyatt: Yeah, your only job is to get better, Eric.", "Quinn: That's an order. From your interim C.E.O.", "Eric: You're the only person I trust. And you.", "Quinn: Well, give it time. Your family may come around, and eventually, you can trust them again.", "Eric: Maybe. Until then, you're in charge. You have to be my eyes and my ears.", "Wyatt: What about the upcoming fashion show?", "Eric: Handle it. Both of you.", "Quinn: We can do that.", "Eric: I'll be back.", "Quinn: Of course you will.", "Eric: Talk to the attorneys. Don't let them throw me out.", "Quinn: Hey. Never, Eric. Never.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: I can only imagine how he's feeling.", "Nicole: Betrayed. I went against what we decided together.", "Rick: You know, you're right, though. He loves you.", "Nicole: I don't make it easy, do I?", "Rick: [Scoffs] We're Forresters. We like women who give us a challenge.", "Nicole: Then he certainly found the right woman in that regard.", "Rick: Talk to him. You know, get together. Maybe you guys can put this behind you.", "Nicole: You know, we will. You don't worry about this, rick. You and Maya have plans to make. A new nursery. Zende and I will get through this. I'm sure he'll come back to me tonight.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Hawaii. You've never been, right?", "Sasha: No. I'm -- I mean, I've always dreamed of going, but... no! Zende, I --", "Zende: No, listen! Hold on. Hawaii is like a different world. I mean, the culture, the food, the air -- everything about it. You are gonna love it.", "Sasha: Zende. You know how I feel about you.", "Zende: You know how I feel about you.", "Sasha: Yes. But it's different from the way you feel about Nicole. I'm sorry, I -- I can't go through that again.", "Zende: Go through what? What do you mean?", "Sasha: I can't be your rebound again!", "Zende: I would never do that to you.", "Sasha: Really? Because it is exactly what happened.", "Zende: Well, not this time. Because I'm gonna break up with Nicole.", "Sasha: Shut up, you don't mean that.", "Zende: I do. Look, you and I hit it off from the very start. Sexy, cool, smart. No complications. I mean, maybe Nicole's too serious for me. Look, Sasha, I don't want to debate this.", "Sasha: Maybe we should.", "Zende: Maybe you're overthinking it. Look, I am just a guy asking you to fly off to Hawaii with him. Right now. Come on. Let's go. Let's do this.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: We have a lot of work to do. It's a big fashion show.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Yeah. This'll be interesting.", "Eric: You can handle it.", "Wyatt: [Scoffs] I-I appreciate the vote of confidence, Eric, but, uh...", "Eric: More than that. You're loyal. You told your mother about the power of attorney, you told us about the takeover here today. I'm very grateful that you're here.", "Wyatt: Thank you.", "Eric: You'll stay, won't you?", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I'm sure Dad'll be thrilled.", "Eric: I need you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: See? Eric really wants you to stay. He wants us to be a family.", "Wyatt: Let's see how it goes. I'll see you guys later.", "Quinn: Okay.", "Wyatt: All right.", "Quinn: Love you. Mmm! Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Wyatt. He's a good person.", "Quinn: Mm-hmm. He is.", "Eric: He gets that from you.", "Quinn: Oh, yeah, definitely. He gets the good from me.", "Eric: He does.", "Quinn: [Giggles]", "Eric: My company, I -- I have to come back.", "Quinn: You will come back. It's your company. No one is gonna take it from you.", "Eric: Ridge won't stop trying.", "Quinn: No, ridge is angry. I don't even think he knows what he's doing.", "Eric: Thank God I have you.", "Quinn: Of course you have me. You don't have to worry about a thing. I am here. I'm gonna take care of you. I'm gonna take care of everything. You're gonna walk right into Forrester creations a C.E.O. The vibrant, powerful, generous man that I am so lucky to be married to. My husband. The jet is stocked, as you requested, sir.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Thank you. Sasha.", "Sasha: Hmm?", "Zende: Want a drink?", "Sasha: Um, you know, just water for me.", "Zende: Oh, come on. Live a little. A-loha.", "Sasha: Thanks.", "Zende: So, what do you think?", "Sasha: Mm! Well, it's -- it's unbelievable. You know, I mean, it's me. On a private jet -- I'm sorry, a Forrester jet -- and going to my dream destination, Hawaii.", "Zende: Happy to make your dreams come true.", "Sasha: Yeah.", "[Cell phone rings]", "Sasha: You should -- you should definitely get that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Hello?", "Nicole: Zende, I'm at home, and I want to discuss this.", "Zende: What is there to discuss? You told me you're having another baby.", "Nicole: I am. But we can make this work.", "Zende: No, I don't think so, babe.", "Nicole: Please come over.", "Zende: [Sighs] I can't.", "Nicole: Zende --", "Zende: Nicole, listen. You're incredible, all right? Your generosity, your loyalty to Maya -- really, it's beyond me. I've never met anyone like you, and I doubt I ever will.", "Nicole: Just come over and we can talk.", "Zende: I can't do it.", "Nicole: We can work this out.", "Zende: No, we can't.", "Nicole: Yes, we can.", "Zende: I love you, Nicole. Goodbye.", "Nicole: Zende? Zende! Mr. Forrester, we've been cleared. Are you ready, sir?", "Zende: [Sighs] Yeah. Let's do it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: Hey. You know, um, maybe -- maybe we shouldn't. Leaving Nic, going to Hawaii. It's a big step, and like I said, Zende, I -- I can't be your rebound. But if you really care about me, okay, then yes, let's do it. We'll go. But it's not too late to go home to Nicole and try to work this out. It's your decision, Zende. What do you really want to do?"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfmJwLSXEiQ"}
