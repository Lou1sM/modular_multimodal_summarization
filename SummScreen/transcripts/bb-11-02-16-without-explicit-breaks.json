    "Recap": [
        "Pam serves coffee to Steffy and Ridge when Quinn and Wyatt lead Eric down the stairs. Steffy says she knew he was making progress but she was not expecting this. Ridge wants to help but Eric says he can manage. Pam says with him up on his feet and Thanksgiving just right around the corner makes them even more thankful this year. Steffy speaks up and asks why did Eric want them here. Slowly he says they boycotted the wedding and now this latest insult to stage a takeover, a coup, and they have to ask? Nicole tells Maya and Rick that she knows how badly they want to give Lizzy a little brother or sister and she has already had the paperwork once so there is no reason now to delay. They want to make sure she has told Zende now that she has made this decision. She nods yes for all the good it did. But that was last night. Maybe he will feel differently today. Sasha tries to get Mr. Rise and Shine to get up but he does not even know where he is. She makes light of it that maybe it was all the mai tais they had on the plane or even those shots of tequila that he had. She laughs and asks how does he say hung over in Hawaiian. Then she addresses him as Dracula and says she knows vampires do not dig sunlight but they are in Hawaii and she wants to take advantage of it. He apologizes and says he knows he promised her a good time with a lot of partying but he just is not in the mood. Disappointed, she says she gets it. He is still thinking about Nic and her decision to be a surrogate again. And frankly she does not blame him for feeling this way. Quinn tells Eric maybe this is not the time to be doing this. Wyatt says just maybe it is. Ridge wants to know why Wyatt is even there and speaking. Eric says Wyatt is part of the family now and is moving in with his blessing as he thinks of him as another son. They still do not accept how Quinn makes him feel and Wyatt has. He is capable and supportive. And he is loyal unlike Ridge. Ridge says he is sorry that his dad is questioning his loyalty. Quinn says it is hard not to with what he has been planning on doing behind his father's back, not once but twice. Ridge says and yes Wyatt felt like he had to bring that to Eric's attention. Wyatt says yes it needed to be said. Ridge says leave Brooke out of this. But Eric says she was just as involved as they all were to get those shares from Bill. And he thought he used to be able to count on Pam but even she turned against him on this while she was not personally involved and .Ridge and Steffy were the ringleaders in manipulating everyone to think it was a good idea to boycott the wedding. They came up with this scheme to steal the company and then lied to everybody about his POA. So do they think he should forgive them, Brooke, Thomas, Maya, Rick, Pam and Zende for having no respect for him. What do they expect from him, his own family. He mentions the fashion show is coming up and Quinn is in charge of everything. Quinn is the one he trusts. He is not asking this of them; he expects it of them for everyone to trust and accept. It will be Quinn and Wyatt. The fashion show is very important. Ridge says he knows. He has poured his heart and soul into the showstopper but Eric says he has made his intentions clear. This is not a game they are playing. He dismisses them all but when Ridge starts to leave Eric says not him; there is more he wants to say to him. Maya suggests that Nicole call Zende again and Rick agrees, they do not want to jeopardize what she and Zende have. Sasha tells Zende that any woman who would not listen to her man in a situation as important as this, she does not think he would want to be in that relationship. Eric tells Ridge that his coup failed and his threats to Quinn were empty. It is now time for him to get on board with the way things are now. Eric puts his arms around Quinn and looks at Ridge and says he loves her. She has changed his life. So Ridge needs to turn the page now and accept who is head of this family.",
        "Steffy catches up with Wyatt and says she did not know that he was living here now. He says he assumed she did but then she had been awfully busy with his brother, pretty much out of touch. She sighs and asks if he is doing this because of her ..because she ended their marriage. He replies no and wrong for her to even think that. She says she does not know what to think now. She accuses him of telling her that his mom would not be in their lives but she is constantly front and center. He claims he tried his damnest to stop her but she and Eric cannot be stopped. They love each other and Wyatt says he did everything he could for him and Steffy. He says he followed all of her demands, even asked his mom to move away and he did not even go to her wedding in respect for Steffy and her position. He did that for Steffy because he loves her. Now shock of all shocks, his mom fell in love with Eric so he is doing this for them now. Steffy argues that Quinn took advantage of Eric's vulnerabilities and made a fool of Wyatt in thinking she could change. She says Wyatt really let her down. He charges back that she let him down. She walked away from him. She is the one who walked away from their marriage. He did nothing wrong there. She argues back that the marriage was doomed from the start because of his mom. Now just look at all the devastation she has caused. Sasha tells Zende that she would love to be doing more than just talking right now but she gets it; he is a deep guy and wants to do more than just jump in the sack with her. His phone rings and it is Nicole. Sasha tells him he should get that. Nicole tells Zende that she needs to talk to him about this. He says he is not in LA so now is not a good time. She asks him where he is and is surprised when he says in Hawaii. He just got drunk and took off. She asks who he is with. Again a surprise when he says Sasha but if Nicole has changed his mind he will come straight home .otherwise all bets are off. She curtly tells him bye. Then tells Maya that Zende made his decision and she made hers. She still wants to be the surrogate. And she wants to do it right away. Wyatt tells Steffy that he is here for one reason only and maybe she thinks he is an idiot but he sees what she won't allow herself to see ..they are good together and make each other happy. He would do anything he could to get their marriage back, her back. He meant every word of his vows and despite Quinn he believes Steffy did too. But he will give her the divorce as long as she knows that he will always love her. Quinn asks Ridge if he needs help in finding his way out. He says no he is just peachy. She says he is a great liar. He retorts that she is a greater liar and that is why Eric is where he is now. His dad doesn't see a lot of things like how Quinn really is. He tells her do not take this wrong but how does this miserable, horrible person just breeze in here and take over and know all the right things to do when apparently the rest of the family does not know how to. She thinks for a minute and says in the past she might have used a lot of four letter words but she will just use one now \u0096 love. She says she finally found love. He says that makes him want to throw up in his mouth. She says as corny as that may sound she will do anything for their love and to protect Eric. He claims that she is keeping Eric away from his family. Quinn says family \u0096 ah there it is. But his mother is gone and she is sorry about that but it is the truth and Ridge needs to accept that she is now the Forrester matriarch. They are having a big fashion show and Eric wants her and Ridge and all of them to work together. And she intends to meet Ridge half way for the sake of the family now, her family now. She just needs to know he will do the same."

        "Maya: We didn't even know you scheduled an appointment.",
        "Nicole: I know how badly we all want to give Lizzy a little brother or sister. And since I was your surrogate before, all the paperwork's been handled, and there's no reason to delay. Unless...you guys are having second thoughts.",
        "Rick: Not a chance.",
        "Maya: Yeah, we want this so much.",
        "Nicole: Well, uh, we still have to check if the timing's right, and then we can make an appointment for the procedure.",
        "Maya: And what about Zende? Rick told me what happened. Have you talked to him since you told him the news?",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] For all the good it did.",
        "Sasha: Aloha!",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Sasha: Time to rise and shine, Dracula. [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: Where am I? [Clears throat]",
        "Sasha: Oh, well, you're in paradise.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, you said you wanted to come down and hear the sea. It was very meta, very moving. But then you fell asleep. [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: Oh, wow. Wow. Okay. Uh... so, why -- why don't I remember that?",
        "Sasha: Geez, I don't know. Maybe it's the mai tais we had on the plane or the welcome drink or, ooh, maybe it's those six shots of tequila you had. [Chuckles] Hmm. How do you say \"hung over\" in Hawaiian? [Laughs]",
        "Maya: You should call him again. He's had some time to think about it.",
        "Nicole: Zende said he loves me. But he just can't go through with the whole surrogacy thing again. Still, that was last night. Hopefully he'll feel differently today.",
        "Sasha: Okay, Mr. Dracula, I know that vampires don't usually dig the sunlight, but come on. We're in Hawaii. Let's go for a dip in the ocean. It will help clear your head. You didn't have that much to drink last night.",
        "Zende: [Sighs]",
        "Sasha: Okay, well, yeah, you did, but --",
        "Zende: Okay, look, Sasha, I'm sorry, all right? I know I promised you this fun vacation, a lot of partying, but I don't think I'm in the mood.",
        "Sasha: I get it. You're still thinking about Nic and her decision to be rick and Maya's surrogate again.",
        "Quinn: You know you're doing so well. Maybe now isn't the time to be doing this.",
        "Wyatt: Maybe it is.",
        "Eric: Wyatt knows.",
        "Ridge: Here's what I don't know. Why is Wyatt speaking?",
        "Steffy: This seems like a family meeting.",
        "Eric: Wyatt's family now, isn't he? I'm married to his mother. And I...I think of him as another son, and he's staying here.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Eric: You still haven't accepted how happy Quinn makes me. But Wyatt has. And he is capable and he's supportive and he's loyal. Unlike you...ridge.",
        "Rick: As much as Maya and I would love for you to be our surrogate again, we don't want you sacrificing any more than you already have or to feel pressured in any way.",
        "Maya: Yeah. I know we've said it before, honey, but we really can't say it enough. You and Zende are so important to us. I think you should try and talk things through with him.",
        "[Knock on door] Aloha.",
        "Sasha: Aloha. Uh, complimentary gift from our hotel management. We hope you enjoy your stay, Mr. Forrester.",
        "Zende: Thanks. If there's anything else you need, please --",
        "Sasha: Oh, yes, um, I would love some of those little fluffy towels. Of course. And you're in the room next door?",
        "Sasha: Yes. Mm-hmm.",
        "Zende: Oh! Sorry. Uh, where's my wallet? Oh. Sorry about that. Here. I'll let you out. [Clears throat] Thanks, man. [Door closes] You haven't posted about our trip, right?",
        "Sasha: No. I mean, I-I figured you wouldn't want me to, knowing that Nic would freak out if she knew you were here with me. Look, I know you're dealing with a lot, and I don't want to add to it with a bunch of unrealistic expectations, okay? I didn't want you to be alone. Plus I get to see Hawaii. [Chuckles] So it's a win/win. [Sighs] But seriously, Zende, I just -- I just like being here with you, hangover and all. But if I'm being honest... what my sister is asking you to do, I don't blame you if you've had enough.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm sorry you still question my loyalty.",
        "Quinn: Well, it's kind of hard not to when you've been plotting against your father behind his back -- not once, but twice.",
        "Steffy: Is that how you see it, too?",
        "Wyatt: Is there another way? There was a coup in the works, wasn't there?",
        "Pam: Well, yes, but it wasn't sinister, Eric. Ridge was just trying to --",
        "Ridge: Pam! It's all right. Wyatt obviously brought it to dad.",
        "Wyatt: I kind of felt like he needed to know.",
        "Ridge: Is that what you felt?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Telling him something that ultimately made no difference?",
        "Quinn: Not from your lack of trying, on your part and on Brooke's.",
        "Ridge: You leave Brooke out of this.",
        "Eric: Brooke was just involved with all of this just as much as everybody else.",
        "Ridge: Not everybody else. Pam had nothing to do with it.",
        "Eric: Is that right, Pam?",
        "Pam: You know how I feel about you, Eric.",
        "Eric: I know I used to be able to depend on you, rely on you. Until you walked away from our wedding and stood with the rest of them against me. And you two? You -- you manipulated everyone into thinking that it was a good idea to boycott our wedding. Then you came up with this scheme to -- to steal the company. And then you lied to everybody about my power of attorney. Shall I forgive you for that? [Breathlessly] Shall I forgive everyone -- Brooke and rick and Maya and Thomas and Zende even for having no respect for me... and my marriage... and my authority? After everything --",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Eric: What do you want... from me? You're my family, and I don't trust you. A fashion show is coming. My wife is in charge of everything. Quinn...is the one I trust.",
        "Steffy: Granddad, what you're asking --",
        "Eric: I'm not...asking. I expect everyone to cooperate. I trust Wyatt and Quinn. This upcoming fashion show is very important.",
        "Ridge: We're all well aware of that, and I've poured my heart and soul into the showstopper. But if -- if she's running it, if Quinn --",
        "Eric: I've made my intentions clear.",
        "Ridge: Fine. We'll play along until you come back.",
        "Eric: Not a game we're playing, is it? Go. Go on.",
        "Ridge: Come on.",
        "Eric: Not you, ridge. Not you. I have... I have something more I want to say to you.",
        "Maya: Call him, sis. Reach out to Zende again.",
        "Rick: Maya and I, we don't want this decision to jeopardize what you two have.",
        "Sasha: I don't get my sister. Because any woman who wouldn't listen to her man about something this major? Zende, I just -- I don't think that's the kind of relationship you want to be in. I mean, no tea, no shade. It's just -- just my honest opinion.",
        "Eric: Your coup failed, ridge, and your threats to Quinn were empty. It's time for you to get on board with the way things are now. I love her. She has changed my life. You need to turn the page now. And you need to get on with the way things are with our family.",
        "Ridge: Family, yeah?",
        "Eric: Yes, ridge. Our family.",
        "Steffy: So you're living in my family home with your mom.",
        "Wyatt: Temporarily. Everyone else knew about it. I just assumed you did, too.",
        "Steffy: I didn't.",
        "Wyatt: Well, that's because you've been too busy with my brother. Out of touch, right?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Let me ask you, Wyatt. Are you doing this because of me? Because I ended our marriage?",
        "Wyatt: No, and for you to even think that is ridiculous.",
        "Steffy: I don't know what to think. You told me that your mom was gonna be out of our lives after we got married, but she's constantly front and center.",
        "Wyatt: Which I have done my damnedest to prevent. I tried to stop her and Eric, but they can't be stopped, Steffy, because they love each other.",
        "Steffy: So you're supporting this?",
        "Wyatt: I did everything I could for us. I followed all of your demands about my mom. I-I asked her to leave us alone, I asked her to move away. Hell, I even stood by you and I didn't even go to her wedding! For you! For us! Because I love you! So, I'm doing this for them. Surprise. Shock of all shocks. My mother found love with Eric.",
        "Steffy: No. She exploited a good man's vulnerabilities. And she made a fool of her son into thinking that she could change. You really let me down, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: You let me down. You walked away from me when I did nothing wrong. You left me, remember? You're the one who ended our marriage.",
        "Steffy: Our marriage was doomed from day one because of your mom! And now you're living in this house! Don't -- don't you see that she's devastated so many lives? Including ours!",
        "Zende: I just can't make sense of it, you know? Nicole and I, we talked about this so many times about how being a surrogate once was a beautiful thing. But to do it all over again, it's -- [Scoffs] I was so sure we were on the same page.",
        "Sasha: Hey, listen. It's okay to talk to me like this. And sure, yeah, I'd love to be doing more than talking, but I get it. You're a deep guy. You're not just looking to jump in the sack with me, and I am sincerely not looking to be your good time. [Sighs] Man, but if Nicole, if she goes through with this --",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Zende: [Sighs]",
        "Sasha: Hmm. Speak of the devil. Nicole. Yeah, you should take that.",
        "Zende: Hello?",
        "Nicole: Zende, I've been calling you. I want to get together and talk about this.",
        "Zende: Yeah, well, I can't.",
        "Nicole: Why not?",
        "Zende: I'm not in L.A.",
        "Nicole: Well, where are you?",
        "Zende: Hawaii.",
        "Nicole: Hawaii? Are you alone?",
        "Zende: No.",
        "Nicole: Who's with you?",
        "Zende: Sasha.",
        "Nicole: Sasha? Are you kidding me?",
        "Zende: I was hurt. I got drunk. But you shouldn't be making these decisions on your own, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: Did you sleep with her?",
        "Zende: Of course not! Listen. I'll come home right now if you tell me you won't go through with the surrogacy.",
        "Nicole: I can't believe this. The first thing you do is get drunk and take off with Sasha?",
        "Zende: You shouldn't have told Maya yes. Listen, Nic, if you do this...",
        "Nicole: What, Zende?",
        "Zende: All bets are off.",
        "Nicole: I've got to go.",
        "Maya: Are you telling me Zende is in Hawaii with Sasha?",
        "Rick: I'm gonna call my nephew and try and knock some sense into him.",
        "Nicole: No, rick. Zende made his choice. And I've made mine. I want to do this for you two, especially for Lizzy. And I want to do it right away.",
        "Wyatt: I'm here for one reason -- because I still believe in Eric and my mother, and you might think that I'm an idiot for doing so, but you know what? I can see what you won't allow yourself to see. They are -- they are good together. They make each other happy, just like I tried to make you happy.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, you did make me happy. It's never been about us. It's been about Quinn. I... come on. I don't want to go through all this again.",
        "Wyatt: Neither do I.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Look. I would do anything to get our marriage back, to get you back. And manipulation by my mother or not, I meant every word of my vows to you. And I believe you did, too. But I'll give you your divorce. But just so you know... I will always love you.",
        "Quinn: Do I need to help you find your way out?",
        "Ridge: How's my dad?",
        "Quinn: He's resting. How are you?",
        "Ridge: Oh, I'm peachy.",
        "Quinn: Ha! You're a terrible liar.",
        "Ridge: But you, you're a great liar. That's why my dad is in the trouble he's in now.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. Eric doesn't see it that way.",
        "Ridge: My dad doesn't see a lot of things. He doesn't see you for who you really are, so... tell me something.",
        "Quinn: Happily.",
        "Ridge: And please don't take this the wrong way, but... how does someone like you... a horrible, awful person like you, just breeze in here, breeze in my dad's life, and become the savior, become this -- this good, decent person who just wants to do all the right things for my dad, when the family apparently doesn't know how to?",
        "Quinn: Well, ridge, there was a time that I would have answered that question with a bunch of four-letter words. But this time I'm just gonna use one. Love.",
        "Ridge: Ahh.",
        "Quinn: I finally found love.",
        "Ridge: But that's the kind of stuff that makes me want to throw up in my mouth. Don't you get that? If we're gonna talk like grown-ups, let's do it. Let's not lie to each other.",
        "Quinn: Well, I'm not lying. The power of love, your father's love, has transformed me, and I will do anything I need to do to protect him.",
        "Ridge: Even keep him away from his own family.",
        "Quinn: See? Family. I mean, listen, ridge, your mother is gone. I'm very sorry about that. But I'm now the Forrester matriarch. I know that makes you want to throw up in your mouth a little bit more, but it's the truth. We have a big fashion show coming up, and your father wants you and I, all of us, to work together, and I am willing to meet you halfway for the sake of your father and for the family -- my family now. I just need to know that you're gonna do the same."
