        "Nick sits with his mother and Dr. Hillman explains to him that her recovery still could mean a whole host of problems and she might never be the woman she once was. Donna is concerned that since Brooke's marriage to Nick is over, she will go back to Ridge. Brooke assures her she needs time alone to heal first, but there are plenty of eligible men in L.A. for her. Donna keeps lamenting that Stephanie pushed Jackie and should pay for her crimes. Stephanie is happy for Ridge, but thinks it is Nick who broke the marriage vows and Ridge should not be punished and be made to wait. Ridge is content for now that Brooke will be coming back to the office and they will be working together. Eric visits Jackie in the hospital and Stephanie thinks he is accusing her for the accident and tries to defend herself.",
        "Donna gives a stunned Nick all the details that it was NO accident, Stephanie pushed his mother over the railing. He runs out with fire in his eyes. Ridge must go back to the office, leaving Stephanie alone in the house. Brooke tries to call Nick on his cell, he won't answer. Donna doesn't understand why Brooke would even half way try to defend Stephanie after all the things she has done to her in the past. Eric joins the fray and is upset when he hears it was Stephanie's fault. Brooke wants him to go back to his house, but he calls first and tells Stephanie to lock the doors ..better yet just get in the car and go, Nick is heading over. She maintains that she can handle him. After much angry pounding on the door and Stephanie telling Nick to leave and go home, Nick goes around and crashes through a glass door. Glaring at Stephanie he tells her he knows what she did. She firmly but politely tells him to leave otherwise she will call he police. That does not deter him; he moves even closer until finally she goes up those stairs again and he follows, grabbing her by the scruff of her jacket and has her head like a dangling participle over the railing until her face turns red. He is like a madman wanting her to admit her guilty all the while with her hollering no, she will admit nothing."

        "Brooke: Oh, Stephanie was wrong in firing you. I'm the CEO of Forrester Creations, not her.",
        "Donna: I don't want to fight her, Brooke. She's out of control. The way she treats me -- intimidating me, calling me names. But it's nothing compared to what she did to Jackie.",
        "Brooke: Look, if you're not absolutely certain about these accusations you're making, then don't make them.",
        "Donna: It wasn't an accident. Stephanie pushed her over that railing. Come on, Brooke, don't be surprised. You of all people know what Stephanie is capable of. She has terrorized our family for years. Finally, we have the ammunition to fight back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: This is what I hoped would happen.",
        "Eric: So Nick and Brooke are over?",
        "Stephanie: I'm so happy for you.",
        "Ridge: Look, it's gonna be awhile before Brooke's ready to make another commitment.",
        "Stephanie: Of course. But then, she always says that, doesn't she?",
        "Ridge: Well, this time she means it.",
        "Eric: Well, given everything that's happened, I'm not at all surprised.",
        "Stephanie: Well, wait a minute, Nick's the one that broke the marriage vows. He should be punished, not you.",
        "Ridge: Mother, it's not about being punished. It's just something she needs to do for herself right now. For her kids, for her.",
        "Stephanie: Well, R.J.'s your child as well.",
        "Ridge: Yes, and someday his parents will be together. Just not right now.",
        "Stephanie: You do believe that's still going to happen then?",
        "Ridge: Well, Mother, I have not given up here. I just have to be patient. And so do you.",
        "Stephanie: Okay. But I have to say, I'm relieved she's free of Nick, and his mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: How's she doing?",
        "Nick: She's trying to talk. It's gonna take time, that's all.",
        "Donna: Nick, I'm so sorry that Stephanie did this to your mother. Did you get my message?",
        "Nick: No.",
        "Donna: It wasn't an accident.",
        "Nick: What do you mean?",
        "Donna: I was there. I saw the whole thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: It took Brooke longer than I thought it would to acknowledge that that marriage was a mistake. I mean, all those rules and regulations he would give her, all those ultimatums.",
        "Ridge: That's not exactly a recipe for marital success, is it?",
        "Eric: Or any kind of success.",
        "Stephanie: Especially for our business. I mean, the idea that a CEO of the company would be running the company from some other place, not even allowed to talk to the head designer -- I mean, it was just silly.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, it's gonna be good having Brooke back in the office.",
        "Eric: You two make a good team.",
        "Ridge: I can't wait to get back to work. I've got a few new designs. I've brought them with me. I was hoping you could take a look at them now.",
        "Eric: Well, I want to, but I can't right now. I'm going to visit Jackie in the hospital.",
        "Stephanie: Well, then I'll look at them.",
        "Eric: Don't do that. Don't make my visiting Jackie in the hospital something it isn't. She was injured in our home.",
        "Stephanie: I know she was injured in our home. Because she wouldn't leave. That's why she's in the hospital.",
        "Eric: You know, what I don't get is that that railing is, like, waist-high. I don't understand how she could just fall.",
        "Stephanie: What are you suggesting?",
        "Eric: You said the two of you were arguing?",
        "Stephanie: Yes, we were arguing. So what are you suggesting? That I picked her up and threw her over the rail?",
        "Eric: I have to go.",
        "Stephanie: I know what happened. It was an accident. And I don't care what anyone says or thinks. I know what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You saw my mother fall?",
        "Donna: She didn't fall, Nick. She was pushed.",
        "Nick: Pushed?",
        "Donna: Hard.",
        "Nick: Stephanie pushed my mother?",
        "Donna: I can only tell you what I saw.",
        "Nick: Well, then you do that. You tell me exactly what you saw. Tell me.",
        "Donna: I was trying to get in from the terrace, and I saw Stephanie and Jackie arguing on the landing. It got physical, and then Stephanie shoved her. And your mother went over the banister. It was horrible. Stephanie called the paramedics right away, but the damage had already been done.",
        "Nick: She shoved my mother?",
        "Donna: Yes.",
        "Brooke: Are you certain?",
        "Donna: Positive.",
        "Nick: She said that she fell, that my mother fell. She lied!",
        "Brooke: No, they were struggling.",
        "Nick: She said that it was my mother's word against hers, but you saw what happened.",
        "Brooke: Donna was out on the terrace looking through the patio door.",
        "Donna: I wouldn't say anything if I wasn't certain.",
        "Jackie: Nick --",
        "Nick: Mother? Mother, is it true? You heard what they said. Is it true? Did Stephanie push you?",
        "Nick: All right. I'll handle it. Now, I want you to get some rest. You're doing so much better. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Why would anybody think that I would deliberately hurt Jackie? And my own husband thinks that?",
        "Ridge: You do admit you were arguing, though.",
        "Stephanie: I've never denied that. We were arguing because she wouldn't leave the house.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ridge: Forrester. When do they have to go out? Okay, I'll be right there. Thanks, Sally. I got to go by the office and sign some papers. You can let me know what you think of those when I get back, okay?",
        "Stephanie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Brooke: Nick, it's me. Look, I know you're upset, but we really need to talk about this, so please call me back. Bye. He's not answering his phone. What did I tell you about making accusations against Stephanie?",
        "Donna: Nick deserved to know what happened.",
        "Brooke: So you just blurt it out? Where do you think he's going right now?",
        "Donna: It's about time somebody stood up to Stephanie.",
        "Brooke: Well, the way that he ran out of here, I don't think he's going to just talk to her.",
        "Donna: She has to be held accountable.",
        "Brooke: And what about Nick? He's going to be held accountable, too, for what he does to Stephanie.",
        "Donna: Oh, he's angry, he's not homicidal.",
        "Brooke: I know Nick, and I know how much he loves his mother. And I'm afraid, if we don't stop him, there's no telling what he might do.",
        "Donna: Please tell me you're worried about Nick, not Stephanie. After everything she's done to you \u0096",
        "Eric: Brooke, what's going on?",
        "Brooke: Where's Stephanie?",
        "Eric: Stephanie's at the house with Ridge. Why?",
        "Brooke: Donna told Nick something that really upset him.",
        "Donna: I was at the house the night of Jackie's accident. Stephanie pushed her over the railing.",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Donna: They were arguing, and she pushed her.",
        "Brooke: Eric, listen to me. Nick was really upset when he heard this. He went ballistic and he ran out of here. Now, I can't reach him on his cell phone, and I'm really concerned that he might be going over to your house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Stephanie: Hello?",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, listen to me. It's Brooke. Nick should be there any minute, and just don't let him in. He thinks that you're responsible for what happened to Jackie.",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's not exactly breaking news.",
        "Eric: Stephanie, look, I want you to go around, I want you to look all the doors.",
        "Stephanie: Eric?",
        "Eric: No, better yet, just get in your car and go, now.",
        "Stephanie: Look, if Nick shows up, I'll handle him.",
        "Eric: Look, you don't understand.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I do understand. If I can handle your accusations, I think I can handle Nick's.",
        "Eric: Stephanie!",
        "Nick: Stephanie!",
        "[Pounding on door] Stephanie, I know you're in there! Open this door!",
        "Stephanie: Nick, go home! I'm terribly sorry about what happened to your mother, but I'm not going to let you in my house. I don't want to argue with you.",
        "Nick: I know what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Eric, we need to go to your house, now.",
        "Eric: No, Brooke. Ridge is there. He's not going to let Nick do anything to Stephanie.",
        "Brooke: Putting Ridge in Nick's way is only going to make this situation worse.",
        "Donna: Ridge can take care of himself.",
        "Eric: Donna, are you sure that what you said to Nick is true?",
        "Donna: It wasn't an accident. Jackie was pushed.",
        "Eric: My god. Stephanie could do something like this? Jackie could have been killed.",
        "Brooke: Given their history, it's easy to jump to conclusions. Nick did. But I think we really should just take a minute and think about this.",
        "Donna: Why are you defending her?",
        "Brooke: Because maybe it was unintentional.",
        "Eric: Look, I just believe that Stephanie would be capable of something like this.",
        "Brooke: I think you should go home and talk to Stephanie.",
        "Eric: I will. There's something I've got to do first.",
        "Brooke: Oh, god. I've got to go find Nick. What you told him --",
        "Donna: It was the truth.",
        "Brooke: And your feelings for Stephanie didn't color it at all?",
        "Donna: Jackie Marone was a vibrant, confident, capable woman. Stephanie took that away from her.",
        "Eric: Oh, god, if my wife did this to you -- I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Have you lost your mind? Look what you've done.",
        "Nick: You said my mother's fall was an accident.",
        "Stephanie: Have you been drinking?",
        "Nick: You said it was an accident.",
        "Stephanie: Get a hold of yourself, Nick.",
        "Nick: You pushed her.",
        "Stephanie: I want you to leave, or I'll call the police.",
        "Nick: Get them over here! I'd love to have a talk with them.",
        "Stephanie: I want you to go. You're trespassing.",
        "Nick: Oh, what? What are you gonna do about it?",
        "Stephanie: Nick, I'm asking you politely. Please leave.",
        "Nick: Well, I'm not leaving. I am not going to let you twist and turn things anymore. I'm in control now!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, well, clearly not of yourself.",
        "Nick: What did my mother ever do to you? She's lying in a hospital bed right now and may be that way the rest of her life because of you!",
        "Stephanie: No, not because of me. Now, please, believe me, it was an accident!",
        "Nick: Stop lying! I know the truth.",
        "Stephanie: No, you don't!",
        "Nick: Donna saw you through the window. I've got an eyewitness!",
        "Stephanie: I don't care what Donna saw, I don't care what Donna thinks that she saw. I know what happened.",
        "Nick: What did my mother say, huh?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my god!",
        "Nick: Something that bothered you. You wanted to shut her up for good -- don't you run away from me!",
        "Stephanie: Stop! I mean, this is so ridiculous.",
        "Nick: I won't let you walk away from what you did to my mother.",
        "Stephanie: I cannot believe that you --",
        "Nick: Admit it to me.",
        "Stephanie: I'm not going to admit --",
        "Nick: Admit what you did. Tell me!",
        "Stephanie: I didn't do anything to your mother! I didn't!",
        "Nick: Tell me what you did! Tell me you threw her over this rail. Admit it! Admit what you did!",
        "Stephanie: No! Nick, no!",
        "Nick: Admit it!",
        "Stephanie: Nick, stop!",
        "Nick: Admit it!",
        "Stephanie: I didn't! Nick!",
        "Nick: Admit what you did!"
