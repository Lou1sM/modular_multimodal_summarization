    "Recap": [
        "Nicole thanks Zende for his support. Maya too says it means a lot for him to show up. Rick says this might take some time and they appreciate he has made a sacrifice as well. The doctor says let's get going. Julius tells Eric that he and Vivienne have been looking forward to having grandkids but not like this. He has prayed about it and it seems so wrong. Vivienne is afraid Nicole will be making a mistake that will cost her the rest of her life. Vivienne believes Rick and Maya will make perfect parents but some other way. Eric reminds him that Nicole is an adult and Julius can not stop this if her mind is made up. Vivienne knows that Nicole is the emotional one in the family and states that it will devastate her to hand over a child she has carried for nine months. This will be her first born. Brooke says she knows Maya is not pushing this on Nicole. But they do want to start a family and get on with their lives. Julius says Zende is on board right now but he can feel it in his bones, he will be running in five or six months. Vivienne laments that her daughter is kind and she is doing this to make up for what Maya went through growing up.",
        "The Avants are aghast when Brooke tells them talking to Maya now is too late. The procedure was scheduled today. Julius jumps to the phone and calls Nicole who tells him she is busy and can not talk and hangs up. Eric offers to take the Avants to the office but Julius says this is something he needs to attend to himself. Brooke wonders if they need to call and give Rick a heads up. Eric thinks that would not be a good idea. Nicole asks Zende to stay with her until the procedure begins. The Avants show up. Nicole asks them to leave but Julius says he is not going to let this happen. Maya says today is supposed to be positive and she has given Nicole plenty of chances to get out of this if she wishes to. Julius pleads again that there has to be another way. This will not have a happy ever ending story. Maya says it never is for him as he is too controlling and he can not do that anymore. He argues that he knows what he is talking about and this will definitely be big trouble. The doctor comes in and he tells her that Nicole is not going through with this."

        "Nicole: It means a lot to me that you're here.",
        "Maya: Your support is important to Nicole, Zende. Thank you for showing up.",
        "Zende: She's determined to do this. This is what she wants. It feels like I should be here.",
        "Rick: Nicole's making a huge sacrifice, being our surrogate, and you're her boyfriend. This -- this process -- it could take some time. Maya and I just want you to know that we appreciate the sacrifice you're making, too.",
        "Zende: I try not to look at it like that.",
        "Dr. March: You're all doing this together.",
        "Maya: I can't tell you how grateful I am, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: You don't need to. I already know.",
        "Dr. March: Your specimen has already been prepped and washed in the lab, standard for intrauterine inseminations.",
        "Maya: The procedure's relatively painless for Nicole, right?",
        "Dr. March: You might feel some light cramping when the catheter enters your uterus, but it's very brief. The whole thing only takes a few minutes.",
        "Maya: Good.",
        "Rick: Excited?",
        "Maya: I can't believe we're doing this.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: We're making a baby! [Laughs]",
        "Dr. March: So, everyone's still on board?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: I got to be honest with you. I've prayed about it. Nicole cannot do this.",
        "Eric: Nicole has agreed to be their surrogate.",
        "Julius: Well, it's not too late for her to change her mind. And I could really use the help of your two guys.",
        "Brooke: We'd like to help. Just not sure there's anything we can do.",
        "Julius: Vivienne and I have been looking forward to having grandchildren, but not like this. Our youngest carrying our oldest's child? It's just wrong on so many levels.",
        "Brooke: You said you have the same concerns.",
        "Vivienne: I can't make peace with it -- the effect it's gonna have on Nicole.",
        "Eric: Legally, Nicole's an adult. Now, I realize, to you, she still seems very young.",
        "Julius: Too young to realize the mess she's getting herself into.",
        "Brooke: I'll admit she hasn't had much time to think about it.",
        "Vivienne: Yeah, everything is happening so quickly. You know, I'm afraid Nicole is gonna make a mistake that's gonna ruin her entire life.",
        "Eric: She is, of course, absolutely certain. You know, Rick and Maya would have it no other way.",
        "Julius: Listen, whatever we do, we got to come together as a family and stop this.",
        "Vivienne: They deserve the chance to be parents, just like everybody else.",
        "Julius: Viv and I never said that we didn't think that Rick and Maya should have a family.",
        "Vivienne: No, no. I know that they would make the most loving and devoted parents.",
        "Eric: I understand. You just wish it could happen some other way.",
        "Vivienne: Mm.",
        "Julius: Any other way -- egg donation, uh, surrogacy, adoption, you know, whatever. I mean, we would support whatever they wanted to do, just not our baby girl. That's off-limits.",
        "Vivienne: I can't imagine what they're gonna tell the child. That your aunt is really your birth mother? Oh! My goodness.",
        "Julius: [Chuckles] No, there's not gonna be explaining anything to anybody 'cause it's not happening.",
        "Vivienne: I just think of Nicole having to watch that baby grow up, you know, knowing that she carried it for nine months, that she's really the birth mother but she's not really the moth-- I -- [Sighs]",
        "Julius: Maya would have to be naive to believe that this wouldn't mess with Nicole's head.",
        "Vivienne: Maybe if she were older, you know?",
        "Julius: It still wouldn't be right.",
        "Vivienne: [Sighs] Oh, God. Well, Nicole has always been our sensitive and emotional child. It'd be devastating for her to have to hand over that baby.",
        "Eric: Extraordinarily difficult, yes.",
        "Vivienne: I want everybody to be okay. I want everybody to have what they want. I just can't help but being concerned about Nicole and the impact it's gonna have on her, her future, even her relationship with -- with Zende.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. March: Before we get started, do you have any questions? Any concerns?",
        "Nicole: No. No questions.",
        "Dr. March: Okay. Well, then I think we're about ready to get started. I'll be back shortly.",
        "Rick: Thank you, Dr. March.",
        "Nicole: Are you freaking out yet?",
        "Zende: Me? No. I mean, you're the one who has to worry about the medical stuff.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: But at least it's relatively quick and painless. I-I would hate if you had to feel a lot of pain on top of everything else.",
        "Nicole: Uh, talk to me when I'm in labor, Sis.",
        "Maya: Oh, that's a good point.",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm.",
        "Maya: Sorry. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: Why don't we just take it one step at a time?",
        "Maya: Call me crazy. I think it's gonna work on the first time. I do.",
        "Nicole: Here's to hoping, right? [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: Nicole, what you are doing for us, what you are giving to me and Rick -- I will never be able to repay you. [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: I wish Dad could be more understanding. Then maybe he'd be here with Mom, sharing this experience with us.",
        "Maya: We were just with Dad and Mom and Rick's parents before we got here.",
        "Zende: Wow. The whole crew.",
        "Rick: Your parents don't know that we're doing this today.",
        "Maya: No. No. We didn't want to deal with Dad's disapproval again.",
        "Rick: Not just your father's.",
        "Nicole: Mom's concerned, too?",
        "Maya: She has some issues. She actually echoed some of the things that Dad has been saying. And -- and I get it. She's looking after you. She realizes that what you're doing could mean a huge sacrifice, including sacrificing your relationship with Zende.",
        "Nicole: Well, he wouldn't be here if it was a problem for us.",
        "Maya: I know that the fact that you're here means that you completely support Nicole.",
        "Rick: Support is key. We're lucky to have that. That's how we're gonna get through this confusing time.",
        "Maya: Yeah. It's just like Dr. March said. We're -- we're all in this together. We're a team. And when this is done, the two of you will go on and live your lives and be even stronger. And Rick and I will have a child. I mean, Nicole, what -- what you're doing... like, way back in the recesses of my mind did I let myself dream that I could have a child with my genes. Never in a million years did I think that was possible. And now that -- that I could possibly hold an Avant baby and raise him or her with Rick, that's all because of you. I would love it if Dad and Mom could be on this journey with us. But I don't think they'll ever understand what we're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: We understand where you're both coming from.",
        "Brooke: It is a lot for Rick and Maya to ask of Nicole, but we know they're not pushing it on her.",
        "Vivienne: Well, Nicole idolizes Maya. She would do anything for her.",
        "Julius: I just wish they would slow down. Okay? Take a step back. You know what I mean? Consider their options. I don't know what the big rush is.",
        "Brooke: They want to start their family. They want to move ahead with their lives.",
        "Vivienne: Yeah, while Nicole's life comes to a grinding halt.",
        "Julius: Yeah. I mean, she's thriving. She's thriving at her job. She's thriving with -- with Zende. I mean, she stands to lose everything.",
        "Eric: We'll do everything in our power to make sure that doesn't happen.",
        "Julius: Her life has already fallen apart.",
        "Vivienne: Julius, don't say that. Don't put that energy out there.",
        "Julius: Viv, I can feel it in my bones. I mean, Zende's on board right now, but five, six months from now, it's gonna send that boy running like he's doing the 100-yard dash.",
        "Brooke: They won't go through with this if Nicole isn't in complete agreement.",
        "Eric: They've both given her every opportunity to say no. She's not being forced into anything.",
        "Vivienne: Well, Nicole may say she doesn't feel pressure, okay? But I know my daughter. This is her way of doing something kind for Maya to make up for the struggles Maya had growing up.",
        "Julius: Listen. Nicole may be grateful to Maya for this lifestyle, but I don't care about the lifestyle. It's still not a good enough reason for her to carry her baby.",
        "Brooke: We respect your opinions and we share your concerns. But ultimately, this comes down to your two daughters. We want what's best for everybody, no matter which path is taken. And you really need to talk to Nicole and share your apprehension. She needs to hear this from her mother.",
        "Eric: And this is a conversation you need to have with her right away.",
        "Vivienne: Maybe we should take the girls to dinner tonight.",
        "Brooke: Tonight? I think it's gonna be too late.",
        "Vivienne: What?",
        "Julius: What do you mean?",
        "Brooke: The appointment was scheduled for the clinic today.",
        "Julius: All right. Thank you. Nicole is not at work.",
        "Vivienne: You think she's at the doctor's office already?",
        "Brooke: Rick said the appointment was this afternoon.",
        "Vivienne: Call her cell. We have to find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: How about Violet? After aunt Violet?",
        "Nicole: I mean, that's cool and all, but how about Nicholas if it's a boy and Nicole if it's a girl?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rick: Nicole's on the short list for sure.",
        "Maya: [Laughs]",
        "Rick: Really? Violet?",
        "Maya: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: It's Dad.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Julius: Nicole, where are you?",
        "Nicole: Uh, doesn't matter where I am. Hey, look, I can't talk right now, so I've got to go.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Julius: Wait. Hello?",
        "Vivienne: What did she say?",
        "Julius: They're at the clinic.",
        "Vivienne: She told you?",
        "Julius: I could tell in her voice.",
        "Vivienne: So, what do we do?",
        "Julius: What do you mean what do we do? We got to stop this.",
        "Vivienne: We don't even know where she's at.",
        "Brooke: It's Dr. March's office.",
        "Eric: We'll take you.",
        "Julius: No. Just give me the address. We need to handle this ourselves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: What did he say?",
        "Nicole: Asked me where I was. Obviously, I didn't tell him.",
        "Rick: He doesn't know we're here.",
        "Maya: No, no. Only your parents know.",
        "Rick: It's not too hard to figure out why Julius was calling.",
        "Zende: Maybe he doesn't go about it so well, but your dad's just looking out for you.",
        "Nicole: I'm not a kid. I don't need him breathing down my neck.",
        "Maya: Dad lives in his own world. But he's also very protective of you, and so is Mom. No matter how much growing up you do, you'll always be their baby.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "Dr. March: Rick, we're ready for you. You need to fill out the insurance forms.",
        "Rick: Okay. Almost there.",
        "Maya: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Do we call? Do we give Rick a head's up?",
        "Eric: No. Let's not interfere. It'll be good for Nicole to hear what her mother has to say, even if she doesn't agree with it. And very good for Vivienne to get a last chance to say what she wants to say.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, definitely. I didn't realize she was so concerned about Nicole being their surrogate.",
        "Eric: Well, Julius doesn't make it very easy for his wife to express her opinions.",
        "Brooke: I just hope it all works out for them. It's gonna be a very difficult road for that family.",
        "Eric: Rick and Maya want a baby, and, uh, Nicole wants to carry it for them. Julius and his wife want what's best for both of their girls.",
        "Brooke: And what's best for one of them may not be necessarily right for the other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You sure we can't get you anything? Soda, bottle of water?",
        "Nicole: I'm good. Thanks.",
        "Zende: I saw those sour gummies that you like in the vending machine. Actually, uh, I think I have quarters.",
        "Nicole: That's okay. Ma-maybe after.",
        "Zende: Is it okay if I go when the time...",
        "Nicole: Well, babe, I'm not gonna make you stay in here during the I.U.I. That'd be...a bit much. But, um, could you hang in with me until then?",
        "Zende: Of course.",
        "Nicole: Thanks. I'm a bit nervous.",
        "Maya: I-I know I don't need to say this again, but --",
        "Nicole: Maya.",
        "Maya: You would tell me if you're having second thoughts, right? Because we don't have to do this today. Or ever.",
        "Julius: We're not too late, are we?",
        "Maya: What are you doing here?",
        "Julius: Nicole, listen. You're about to make a terrible --",
        "Nicole: Dad, stop. Please leave. You have no right barging in here.",
        "Julius: I told you. Your mother and I are not letting this happen.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Well, this is a pretty unique situation -- you and I aware of the very moment that our son might be starting a new family.",
        "Brooke: A very exciting prospect. Another beautiful grandchild.",
        "Eric: Yes. And an added bonus -- he'd be local.",
        "Brooke: Or she. She would be very local, living in this very house. [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: Get to see that baby every day.",
        "Brooke: And I will come visit every single day.",
        "Eric: I would love that. And we wouldn't have to settle for the occasional holiday visit the way we have to with little Logan.",
        "Brooke: But little Logan isn't so little anymore. He sent me a Christmas list, and you know what was on the top?",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Brooke: A little baby cousin.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] Come on.",
        "Brooke: I'm serious. It would be wonderful... if it really happens.",
        "Eric: Yeah. Rick and Maya will make spectacular parents, no matter how they get there.",
        "Brooke: You're right.",
        "Eric: But it's out of our hands. We can offer advice and our opinions, if asked, but that's all we can do.",
        "Brooke: You know, I feel kind of bad being excited about this. You and I would be grandparents again, and our son would have a little baby.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: But the Avants...",
        "Eric: The Avants have a lot to go through here. This is very big.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, this could be tough for them. There's a lot at stake for Maya and Nicole. But if this does happen, if they go through with it, they're gonna be more connected than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Mom, you can stay, but, Dad, you've got to go. I don't want you here. Today is supposed to be positive.",
        "Julius: Nicole, your mother and I stand here today as one. We are not leaving. We are not gonna let you throw your life away.",
        "Maya: Nicole is old enough to make her own decisions. You don't have to understand them, but you do have to respect her judgment.",
        "Julius: Zende, you're here? Don't you remember what I told you earlier? Maya, you don't realize it, but your sister feels indebted.",
        "Nicole: That -- that is not true. You don't know what you're talking about. That's not why I'm doing this.",
        "Julius: You don't see it, honey, because you're trying so hard to please your sister. You want to give her this gift.",
        "Maya: No. Nicole has not been pressured, not by me and not by Rick. This is 100% Nicole's decision, and if she wants to walk out that door right now, she can do it.",
        "Nicole: Do you really feel this way, Mom? Maya said that you did. Are you really standing by Dad?",
        "Vivienne: I wouldn't be here unless -- unless I was worried about you.",
        "Julius: Look, Maya, I get it. You and Rick want to have a family. That's fine. All we're asking is that you leave Nicole out of it. Let her life grow. Let her flourish. Let her have a-a relationship with this wonderful young man. Give her a chance. Please, don't do this.",
        "Vivienne: There's got to be a better way. I mean, there just has to be.",
        "Julius: Listen. This is not gonna be a happily-ever-after ending story. That is not how life is.",
        "Maya: Maybe not for you. You never learned how to be happy. You were too busy trying to control everything and everyone. And you know, that's all this is. Your concern? It drives you crazy that you can't control us anymore.",
        "Julius: No! That's not what this is about. I'm telling you. I know what I'm talking about. Baby, I can promise you, if you do this, this is gonna be big trouble.",
        "Rick: Whoa. Didn't realize everyone would be here.",
        "Dr. March: We're ready to get started when you are.",
        "Julius: Doctor... we're Nicole's parents. This will not be happening. Nicole... you're not going through with this."
