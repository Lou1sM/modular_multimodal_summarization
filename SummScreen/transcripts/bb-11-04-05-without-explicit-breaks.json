        "Brooke: Your place is with \r\nBridget. She is my daughter. You could never betray her any more than I could. \r\nAnd no matter how much I love you, Nick -- I can never be with you. I can never \r\nbe with you. ",
        "[ Cell phone rings ] \r\nHello? ",
        "Eric: Brooke, it's me. \r\nLook, I've been at the office all night. We have a big emergency here. I need \r\nyou to get in here right away. ",
        "Brooke: What's going on?\r\n",
        "Eric: I'll explain when \r\nyou get here. Hurry. ",
        "\r\n**************************************************************************",
        "Stephanie: It's mine. It's \r\nall mine. Forrester Creations is mine. ",
        "\r\n***************************************************************************",
        "Eric: Stephanie cannot \r\nstrip me of my own company. Not after all the years I spent making Forrester \r\nCreations a success. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm afraid she \r\ncan. ",
        "Eric: I don't want to hear \r\nthat, Jonathan! ",
        "Jonathan: I realize that. \r\nBut my top attorneys and I have gone over every line of this trust. ",
        "Lawyer #1: We even tracked \r\ndown the trustee, Katherine Chancellor. ",
        "Lawyer #2: Who verified \r\nshe's done nothing to alter the original document. ",
        "Lawyer #1: I'm sorry, Mr. \r\nForrester, but this document is legal and binding. ",
        "Eric: Damn it! There must \r\nbe some kind of a loophole. ",
        "Jonathan: Eric, you're not \r\nhearing us. We've gone over every avenue that we can. Not only is Stephanie sole \r\nowner of this company, but there's even more to worry about. If she chooses to, \r\nStephanie could make a criminal case of fraud against us for concealing the \r\ntrust. Which means you and I could wind up in jail for quite some time. \n",
        "\r\n*******************************************************************",
        "Sally: Geez Louise. Would \r\nyou lighten up a little bit, people. Things cannot be that dire. ",
        "Clarke: The heck they're \r\nnot. I just came from the warehouse. We're up to our rafters in inventory. \r\nNothing is moving. ",
        "Thorne: And that surprises \r\nyou after the trouncing we took? I think this about sums it up, don't you?\r\n",
        "Sally: All right, I'll \r\nadmit it. I made a royal mess of things, okay? This wasn't any old fashion \r\nfisticuff. Ridge designed his heart out to get his son back home. And Tommy boy, \r\ngod bless him, he managed to hit a sophomore slump at the worst possible time. \r\nAnd add to all of that, the media hoopla surrounding king Eric's remarriage to \r\nBrooke, and out of nowhere, the launch of the \"Forrester reunited\" campaign. But \r\nstill, if we do go belly up -- ",
        "Thorne: You still have \r\nsome of the money that I paid you, Sally. But I bet my entire inheritance on \r\nspectra. And I could lose it all. Every last cent. ",
        "\r\n************************************************************",
        "Massimo: I won't even ask \r\nif you slept well last night. ",
        "Stephanie: I never even \r\nwent to bed. I have so much to do. ",
        "Massimo: New plans for \r\nForrester Creations, huh? ",
        "Stephanie: Going to change \r\nthings around, shake things up. ",
        "Massimo: Yeah, I'm sure \r\nfor certain people. ",
        "[ Knock at the door ] \r\nExpecting someone? ",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, come \r\nin, come in. ",
        "Taylor: Stephanie, I have \r\nbeen so worried about you. I mean, when I encouraged you to focus on yourself, I \r\ndidn't mean for you to move all the way to Florida. ",
        "[ Stephanie chuckles ]\r\n",
        "Massimo: There's been a \r\nchange of plans. ",
        "Taylor: Massimo? \n",
        "Massimo: Hi, Taylor.\r\n",
        "Taylor: What's going on?\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Everything is \r\nfine. I'm just not going anyplace. ",
        "Taylor: Well, that's \r\nwonderful. How did that come about? ",
        "Stephanie: This. \n",
        "Taylor: \"Stephanie Douglas \r\ntrust?\" ",
        "Stephanie: I found it by \r\naccident in Eric's office in the safe. My father had it drawn up years ago, and \r\nhe just -- he never had the opportunity to tell me about it. I'm the \r\nbeneficiary. ",
        "Taylor: Beneficiary of \r\nwhat? ",
        "Massimo: Taylor, my dear \r\n-- you are looking at the sole and rightful owner of Forrester Creations. \n",
        "\r\n************************************************************",
        "Brooke: Eric, what's going \r\non? I saw Jonathan and the other attorneys out there. What's wrong? ",
        "Eric: We have trouble, \r\nBrooke. We have big, serious trouble. ",
        "Brooke: \"The Stephanie \r\nDouglas trust.\" What is this? ",
        "Eric: It's a document that \r\nStephanie's father had drawn up before he would give us the money to start the \r\ncompany giving sole ownership of fForrester Creations to his daughter. \n",
        "Brooke: What? No, that's \r\nimpossible. I never even -- wait. Did you know about this? ",
        "Eric: Yes. I never told \r\nanybody. It's been in my safe in all these years. But now that Stephanie knows \r\nabout it, she's convinced that the company is all hers. ",
        "Brooke: Eric, I don't care \r\nwhat she's convinced of! She's not going to do this to us. You and I are the \r\nceo\u2019s of Forrester Creations, and some paper written a zillion years ago isn't \r\ngoing to change that. Go get Jonathan. Okay, fine, I will. ",
        "Eric: No, Brooke -- it's \r\ntoo late for that. Stephanie has complete power over this company now and she's \r\ngoing to come after you and me -- like she never has before. ",
        "\r\n***************************************************************",
        "Sally: Listen, I know that \r\nSpectra has lost its shirt more times than Brooke has shed tears and we've \r\nalways lived to design again another day. And we will this time, too. Heaven \r\nforbid, if that doesn't happen, then -- ",
        "Thorne: You still walk \r\naway with a cushy nest egg to live on. I have a family to support, sally. I have \r\na wife, I have a little girl, who are counting on me. And what do I do? I gamble \r\naway their security. The two most precious things in my life. And that's how I \r\nprotect them? What kind of father does that? What kind of husband? ",
        "\r\n*********************************************************************",
        "Brooke: Even if Stephanie \r\ndid try to use this document to cause trouble, she wouldn't get anywhere. Not if \r\nwe talk -- ",
        "Eric: Look, she's already \r\nplanning our demise, Brooke. She fired me yesterday. ",
        "Brooke: Eric, she can't \r\nfire you. This company would be nothing without you. ",
        "Eric: Without us. You've \r\ngiven this company as much as I have. And that's our strength -- that's this \r\ncompany's strength. But Stephanie is determined to take it all away from us.\r\n",
        "Brooke: And from our \r\nchildren. That's what you're trying to say, right? That my stock and the stock \r\nthat we gave our children is reverting all back to Stephanie? ",
        "Eric: I'm afraid so.\r\n",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god, Eric. \r\nThis can't happen. We need to fight her. ",
        "Eric: And we will, Brooke, \r\nwe will. All of us together. Forresters standing together. ",
        "Brooke: Who else knows \r\nabout this? ",
        "Eric: Jonathan has filled \r\nin Ridge on this and Rick is on his way back from Milan as we speak. He'll be \r\nhere any minute now. ",
        "Brooke: What about \r\nBridget? ",
        "Eric: I don't think she \r\nneeds to know about this -- yet. ",
        "Brooke: No, she needs to \r\nthink about her baby. She doesn't need to be more stressed out. ",
        "Eric: No, it's the last \r\nthing any of us needs right now. I'm just afraid that -- ",
        "Ridge: That all hell's \r\nabout to break loose? ",
        "Eric: So Jonathan filled \r\nyou in? ",
        "Ridge: I never knew a \r\ntrust existed. ",
        "Eric: Your grandfather \r\nDouglas drew it up before he would give us the money to start the company.\r\n",
        "Ridge: Is this thing still \r\nlegit? ",
        "Eric: Yes, it is. That's \r\nwhy it's imperative that the three of us and Rick all stand together here. We \r\ncan't let Stephanie change anything. This company is our legacy. ",
        "Brooke: And our \r\nchildren's. ",
        "Eric: That's right. We \r\nbuilt it, and we made it great. We need all of us working together here. Now, if \r\nshe pulls this family apart, the company will disappear. We have to make her \r\nunderstand that. ",
        "Ridge: There's no way \r\nmother is going to take this company away from her kids and grandkids. She'll \r\ncalm down. And, when she does, we'll just work this out. ",
        "\r\n**************************************************************",
        "Taylor: I just absolutely \r\n-- I cannot get over this. Forrester Creations is all yours? ",
        "Stephanie: And it has been \r\n-- from day one. ",
        "Taylor: But Eric kept it \r\nfrom you all these years? ",
        "Stephanie: Yes. \n",
        "Taylor: I cannot imagine \r\nhow you feel. You must be -- ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I am -- I'm \r\nso upset. I mean, he has betrayed me on such a level. I never would have thought \r\nthat he was capable of this. I'm really, really hurt and I'm deeply offended. \r\nThere's going to be some changes. I want to tell you about them. First, there \r\nare gonna be changes concerning your children\u2019s' trusts. But believe me, in the \r\nlong run everything will be straightened out. And eventually, they will be very \r\nwell taken care of. Will you trust me on this? ",
        "Taylor: Yes. ",
        "Stephanie: Thank you. \r\nDiscovering this document, Taylor, has given me a real sense of purpose. This \r\nisn't just about business, it's just so much more than that. It's about the \r\nthings that you and I stand for. You know that I have always believed that \r\ngoodness and morality prevail in the long run. Some people think I'm a little \r\nnaive, but that's what I believe. And you have to have luck. Luck. Luck has \r\nbrought me to this moment in my life. This document and luck have brought us to \r\na new day. A new day for my family and my company. A new day, Taylor. \n",
        "Taylor: I -- I don't get, \r\nwhat do you mean you're making major changes? ",
        "Stephanie: I'm going to \r\ntake over the company, I'm going to run the business. I have a vision of what I \r\nwant to do, and I believe I can turn that vision into a reality. ",
        "Taylor: To bring Forrester \r\nCreations back to what it used to be? ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, a company \r\nthat was synonymous with style, class and dignity. I have a purpose now, but I \r\nwant you to help me. ",
        "Taylor: Well, you know I \r\nwill. I mean, I'm totally with you. I think Brooke has practically destroyed the \r\nimage of this company. ",
        "Stephanie: Good, I knew I \r\ncould count on you. Forrester is going to be a kind of company that we can be \r\nproud of again. ",
        "Massimo: You were right. \r\nEric did send for Rick. He's there at Forrester Creations with his parents and \r\nRidge. ",
        "Stephanie: Wonderful. \r\nGives me the opportunity to explain to them what I want to do with the company.\r\n",
        "Taylor: You're going over \r\nthere right now? ",
        "Stephanie: Yes. I want you \r\nto come with me. I think that you're going to find that what I have in mind is \r\nfascinating. In more ways than one. ",
        "\r\n*********************************************************************",
        "Darla: Thorne -- sweetie \r\n-- ",
        "Thorne: I shouldn't have \r\ngone off on Sally like that. I mean, it's not like I didn't know how she \r\noperates when I signed on as a partner. It's just that everything was going so \r\nwell there for a while -- maybe I took it for granted. Maybe the truth is, I was \r\nnever meant to be a success. ",
        "Darla: Baby \u2013 ",
        "\r\n**********************************************************",
        "Brooke: It's so good to \r\nhave you home, sweetheart. ",
        "Rick: It's good to be \r\nhome. I think. ",
        "Eric: I appreciate you \r\ngetting here as soon as you could. I know it's very short notice. ",
        "Rick: So, the reason you \r\nhad me fly here so quickly -- ",
        "Eric: Look, our company is \r\nunder attack. I needed all of our key players here to do battle. ",
        "Ridge: Come on, aren't you \r\nbeing a little melodramatic? ",
        "Eric: Your mother is, but \r\nI'm not. ",
        "Rick: You know what, Dad, \r\nactually, I'm not all that surprised. After you and mom got married I kinda \r\nfigured Stephanie would do whatever she could to stir things up. ",
        "Brooke: Stephanie has \r\nalready fired your father. ",
        "Ridge: What? ",
        "Eric: In the heat of the \r\nmoment, yes. Look the point is there's no predicting what your mother's gonna \r\nwant to do here. Or when. Whatever it is, we have to provide ourselves with a \r\nunited front. She cannot use Forrester Creations as a weapon in her vendetta \r\nagainst your mother, or as something to get back at you and me because of our \r\nremarriage. ",
        "Brooke: She can't run this \r\ncompany without any of us. So if we just stand together then -- ",
        "Eric: There's not a damn \r\nthing she can do. Nothing -- ",
        "[ Door opens ] ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I'm so glad \r\nyou're all here. ",
        "Eric: Stephanie, hello.\r\n",
        "Ridge: Taylor, what are \r\nyou doing here? ",
        "Stephanie: She's with me.\r\n",
        "Eric: Uh, we're in a \r\nmeeting here. If you want to see us, you'll have to wait outside my office.\r\n",
        "Massimo: Her office.\r\n",
        "Eric: Oh, I see. Is that \r\nwhat this is all about? Look, let's get something straight here. You may have \r\nfound that old document, but you can't come in here and start shoving people \r\naround. We're not going to take it. This family is not going to take it. \n",
        "\r\n********************************************************",
        "Darla: You listen to me, \r\nThorne Forrester. I am not going to let you do this to yourself. Yes, things do \r\nlook bleak right now. And they might not turn around. But if that happens, \r\nhoney, it's not because you failed this company or your family. You have put \r\nyour heart and your soul into this place. You alone have brought it \r\nrespectability and class. Not to mention giving Sally and everybody else that \r\nworks here a sense of pride and accomplishment -- something that they have never \r\nhad before. You did that, Thorne. By being the wonderful, wonderful, sweet, \r\ncaring man that you are. The man that I fell in love with. The man that I will \r\ncontinue to love until I breathe my last breath. And if it doesn't work out here \r\nat spectra, well then, baby, it just wasn't meant to be. But I do know something \r\n-- your best days are ahead of you. ",
        "[ Thorne scoffs ] \n",
        "Thorne: How can you be so \r\nsure? ",
        "Darla: Please, because I \r\nhave faith in you. Absolute, all-consuming faith that you will find your way. Or \r\nit'll find you, baby. Maybe sooner than you think. ",
        "\r\n*********************************************************************",
        "Stephanie: Good speech, \r\nEric. ",
        "Eric: Just want to be sure \r\nthat we all understand each other. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I \r\nunderstand you. And I'm not surprised that you called in the troops. Rick, it's \r\nreally good to see you, thanks for coming. I'm sure your father has told you \r\neverything that's happened -- his version, anyway. ",
        "Rick: Yeah, you're trying \r\nto challenge the family for ownership of the company? ",
        "Stephanie: No, that's not \r\nmy intention. I had hoped that your father would have told you the truth. \r\nObviously, he didn't, so -- let's just get right to it. I think maybe you'll \r\nunderstand better when you realize that he kept this knowledge from me through \r\nour entire marriage. The knowledge being who really owns Forrester Creations.\r\n",
        "Eric: Oh, come on, \r\nStephanie. Forrester creations is something a lot more than just a piece of \r\npaper. It's the creativity, the talent of the four people that you saw in this \r\nroom here and many others. Rick at international. Ridge's designs. Brooke's \r\ncontributions. ",
        "Brooke: Eric's creativity. \r\nThere wouldn't even be a company to fight over if it weren't for his incredible \r\ntalent. ",
        "Eric: Not that there's \r\ngoing to be a fight. Because we're all standing because we're all standing here, \r\nthe four of us together, to assure you that we will accept no changes in this \r\ncompany. ",
        "Stephanie: It's so typical \r\nof you to hide behind your bride and your children. ",
        "Ridge: Come on, Mother.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Well, I think \r\nthis is just a perfect example of how far a field the company has gone. I'm \r\ntaking over. ",
        "Rick: You're taking \r\ncontrol of Forrester Ceations? ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, Rick. And \r\nI would like very much for you to stay at international. I want very much for \r\nRidge to stay on as the head designer. As for your parents, Rick -- ",
        "Eric: Brooke and I are co-ceos \r\nof this company. ",
        "Stephanie: No, you were \r\nfired yesterday. And you were terminated today officially. ",
        "Brooke: You can't do that, \r\nStephanie. ",
        "Stephanie: My lawyers \r\nassure me that I can. Mass? ",
        "Massimo: Well, I don't \r\nthink I have to say anything. But I'm sure Jonathan told Eric the same thing. \r\nHow total power in the company now resides in her hands. ",
        "Stephanie: I'm going to \r\ntake Forrester back to what it once was -- before Brooke arrived here with her \r\nsmut and her debauchery. ",
        "Eric: Stephanie, just stop \r\nthis. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you can \r\nstand there and you can huff and puff, but you're not -- you're not going to \r\nchange anything. I am taking control. I own Forrester. I have all along. And \r\nthat means, Brooke, quite simply, that you are out of the company. ",
        "Brooke: The hell I am.\r\n",
        "Eric: Brooke, don't --\r\n",
        "Brooke: No, Eric. \r\nStephanie can \"huff and puff\" all she wants, but she's not going to throw me out \r\nof a company that I've spent years helping to build. I don't care about your \r\nlittle piece of paper and what your lawyers are going to do. I am going to hire \r\nmy lawyers to take care of this. You are not going to take Forrester Creations \r\naway from my children. Because it's as much their legacy as it is yours, \r\nStephanie. No matter how much you hate me, you're not going to do that. I will \r\nput a stop to this. I swear to god, I will. "
