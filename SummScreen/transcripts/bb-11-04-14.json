        "Deacon tries to get amorous but Quinn says not now, she has other things on her mind. Their children are working at FC and they need to make sure that continues to go well. There is a new CEO shakeup. She has missed out on several things, like today is Wyatt and Hope's first ultrasound. She starts to head out and Deacon says he can't believe she is going to crash Hope's appointment. Quinn says she can not miss out despite what Hope says. He wishes her luck and says she is going to need it. Eric calls another meeting and tells them this is really, really important. Liam stops by just before Hope is going to her ultrasound. She only mentions that she is not going to the meeting because she has her own appointment. It is when Wyatt comes in that he mentions the ultrasound. He tells Liam that Ivy is pretty and very talented so he's happy for the both of them. Ivy talks to her dad about going on another fishing trip and he wishes her well with her showing of jewelry in Amsterdam. He questions her about how many dates she has had with Liam. Then he interrupts the meeting and practically drags Eric out to go to Oregon and catch their supper. Rick takes over and asks if anyone else needs a break as he won't judge them. Things could get a little difficult around here. He reminds them that they all betrayed him but they are going to carry on. He tells Ridge that if he needs Caroline's hand to guide him, he does not care. He tells Caroline that his attorney will be in touch with her. Carter tells Rick to be careful what he says now. He needs a little more cooling off period. Rick tells him to be careful also as he knows he is loyal to Ridge. Carter says he is loyal to FC and says Maya is a money hungry Rick stops him and says one more word and he will be gone. He says she is the only one who told him the truth and anybody who has a problem with Rick or Maya can get the hell out. Ridge asks if this is the way he is going to throw his weight around. Rick says if Ridge doesn't like it don't let the door hit him. Rick says he doesn't care what anybody thinks except for his lead model. He asks Caroline to design another piece for Maya despite the fact that they already have a show stopper. He wants one that really showcases her beauty. Caroline glares at him then refuses. She says she is not giving up on their marriage but Rick is trying to rub her face in this newest decision and make it as painful as possible.",
        "Rick calls a halt to the meeting and tells them to get out. Maya stays and Rick tells her that he is CEO and they will have to learn to respect that. She says she is proud of him. Maya leaves for a little while but comes back with champagne and caviar since they have not celebrated. In time he will forget all this ugliness. He toasts \"to us\". Ridge asks Caroline if she is okay. She thanks him for taking up for her when it looks like Rick is punishing her. She says Rick is leaving her and taking up with Maya. What is she supposed to do? The doctor tells Wyatt and Hope there is not much to see at this stage. They will not be able to tell if it is a boy or a girl and when it is time they will need to let her know if they want to know or keep it a secret. Holding Hope's hand, Wyatt kisses her a few times and looks on in wonder at the picture before then, like a kid on Christmas morning. Liam can't concentrate on work and he texts Hope of how did it go."

        "Ivy: Oh, yeah. The big fishing trip with Eric.",
        "John: We'll have dinner when I get back.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, that'd be great. You know, he's so excited to spend some time with you.",
        "John: If he'll ever get out of this meeting. And I'm excited about you -- my little girl, a big-time jewelry designer. Launching her own line in Europe.",
        "Ivy: Yep.",
        "John: Where's the first stop?",
        "Ivy: Amsterdam.",
        "John: Oh, lots of bridges there. Watch your step.",
        "Ivy: I know. I've got a game plan already. I'm just gonna stick right down the center and avoid all the sides.",
        "John: Good plan. Unless this Liam fellow can jump in after you, in which case, go for a swan dive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You're not getting dressed today?",
        "Deacon: Just seems like a waste of time to me.",
        "Quinn: What are you talking about?",
        "Deacon: The clothes are just gonna end up on the floor.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Well, that's part of the fun, ripping your clothes off.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, see, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. How many buttons am I supposed to lose? I mean, my very favorite t-shirt, it's in tatters thanks to you.",
        "Quinn: Aww! Poor baby! No. No, no, no. My mind's on other things right now.",
        "Deacon: Like what?",
        "Quinn: Like Forrester Creations.",
        "Deacon: And there you go. Completely out of the mood. Thank you.",
        "Quinn: Well, Wyatt told me that there's a shake-up going on down there.",
        "Deacon: So what? Who cares?",
        "Quinn: So, our children work there. We have to make to sure no matter what they come out on top.",
        "Deacon: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Of course Rick is upset. But he'll get over it eventually.",
        "Caroline: If Maya ever gives him a moment alone. She's got her hooks in him. You have to get rid of her.",
        "Rick: [Clears throat] Is there a problem?",
        "Eric: There shouldn't be... if the three of you will focus on getting along. Ridge, good. Come in. Sit down.",
        "Ridge: Do I need to be here? I got other stuff I got to --",
        "Eric: Ridge, I asked you to sit down. Will you sit down please? Look, I called this meeting first and foremost to make an announcement, but before I do, I just want to remind everybody that this is a family business. I didn't work all these years to make this a successful fashion house to have it fall apart because of the tension between two brothers. Now, I want you to work together. Designer...and CEO.",
        "Ridge: You got to be kidding me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: CEO trauma at Forrester? Come on, Quinn. Whatever happens, you know, it's gonna shake out fine for our kids.",
        "Quinn: You think?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, of course, I do. I mean, Ridge and Rick -- they're smart guys, right? They both recognize that Forrester needs Hope for the Future.",
        "Quinn: I suppose.",
        "Deacon: But let me guess. There's still something stressing you out.",
        "Quinn: Well, I thought Wyatt would have been able to convince Hope by now.",
        "Deacon: Convince her of what?",
        "Quinn: To stop excluding me!",
        "Deacon: Will you give it time?",
        "Quinn: I have given it plenty of time, and I am missing out on all sorts of grandmotherly duties. Like today -- do you know what today is? It's their very first ultrasound.",
        "Deacon: Oh, well, of course, you would have been invited for that.",
        "Quinn: Who says I need an invitation?",
        "Deacon: This will end well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I think Liam made quite the impression on you.",
        "John: Well, he'll never measure up to that McGough boy, though.",
        "Ivy: Dad, that was in the fifth grade. We didn't even hold hands.",
        "John: Oh, well, I liked the way he called me \"Sir.\"",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, I didn't appreciate the way he slurped his juice box, so that relationship was going nowhere.",
        "John: Oh, Liam, on the other hand? Mm-hmm. Well, my advice to you, young lady -- don't give Liam a juice box any time in the near future. Keep that magic alive as long as you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: So apparently there's a lot of action around here lately.",
        "Hope: Oh, you have no idea. Just a crazy amount. There's a meeting going on right now, actually, that's --",
        "Liam: Oh, don't let me keep you.",
        "Hope: No. Oh, no, no, no. I'm not going.",

        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Let's rock 'n' roll. It's, uh, ultrasound time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: So you're going on another fishing trip, hey? You know what? I don't think this is a very good look for Beverly Hills.",
        "John: Well, I'll be knee-deep in the Rogue River before sundown. Picked up a few new flies on the way in.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Very good. You know what? I'm glad to hear that these are not gonna be used in the Forrester koi pond.",
        "John: Koi? Oh, no, too bony. I am taking my brother up to Oregon. In a couple of hours, we'll be catching our dinner. If he ever finishes with this meeting.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. There's a lot happening at Forrester right now.",
        "John: Ah! I can still boss him around. Don't worry. He'll come.",
        "Ivy: Oh, really? You think so?",
        "John: Well, if not, I'll invite Liam to join me. Get to know your gentleman caller a little better. Tell me, how fast can Liam gut a fish?",
        "Ivy: You know what? I have no idea.",
        "John: Really? Well, how many dates have you had?",
        "Ivy: Well, clearly, Dad, not enough. I just keep forgetting to ask that question.",
        "John: Well, look, if you ever need a chaperone to, you know, steer the conversation around to --",
        "Ivy: You know what? Thanks, but I think I'm gonna be all right.",
        "John: With Liam... I think you will.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah, it's our first one.",
        "Liam: Wow! That's --",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, it's a big day, you know? Getting a look at our little bambino. Or bambina, right?",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I saw Ivy out there. You know, out in reception.",
        "Liam: Oh, great. Oh, good. I was actually hoping to see her, so...",
        "Wyatt: Well, I'm glad you're spending a lot of time with her, you know? She's very talented, and she's very pretty, and good for you.",
        "Liam: Uh, thanks.",
        "Wyatt: But I think we ought to go.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. Yep.",
        "Liam: Okay, enjoy.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: We will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not seriously gonna do this.",
        "Quinn: I have to. This is my grandchild we're talking about.",
        "Deacon: You're gonna crash Hope's appointment?",
        "Quinn: I am not missing anything in my grandchild's life, despite what Hope says.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Come on. Wish me luck.",
        "Deacon: You're gonna need it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Look, this is really, really important. Our company is depending on all of you to get this --",
        "John: And my stomach's depending on you getting a move on. What the heck is taking so long in here?",
        "Eric: John, will you just give me a few minutes, all right, please?",
        "John: Excuse me, everyone. Eric and I are flying out to Oregon and fishing for our own dinner. Come on, Eric. They're starting to bite right now. I can feel it!",
        "Eric: Look, I'm afraid you're gonna have to go without me, John. I've got so much to handle here.",
        "John: Didn't you just name a new CEO?",
        "Maya: Yes, he did. Rick.",
        "John: And why did you do that? So you could attend boring meetings or so you could jump on a plane with your brother? Come on! You suckered Rick into taking the job. Let him do it. Incidentally, congratulations, Rick. You're gonna do a great job.",
        "Rick: Thank you. Dad, go. We'll be fine.",
        "Eric: Not the company I worry about so much. It's you. It's you and Ridge.",
        "Rick: We'll work it out.",
        "John: They'll work it out! Come on, Eric. Sundown is fast approaching. You're gonna love the guys. The sound of crackling wood. That little tavern in Shady Cove. Incidentally, they call it Shady Cove for a reason.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Eric: Is that so?",
        "Rick: Have a great trip, Dad. Well... dad's gone fishing. Some well-deserved R&R. Does anyone else, uh, need a little break? There's the door. I'm not gonna judge. Might want to think about it, because things aren't gonna be easy around here... for any one of you. Because as far as I'm concerned, you've all betrayed me. You, I'd like some worthwhile designs. And if you need to hold her hand to do it, that's fine. I don't care. And, you. You'll be hearing from my attorney.",
        "Carter: As an attorney, I strongly suggest a cooling-off period.",
        "Rick: You've always been loyal to Ridge. That better change if you want to stay around here.",
        "Carter: I'm loyal to Forrester Creations. And I'd like to advise you legally to be very careful about the decisions you make. Maya's all over you. She's a money-grubbing --",
        "Rick: One bad word against her -- you're gone. Maya's the only one who's actually been truthful to me. And if anyone has a problem with Maya or me, I suggest you get the Hell out. Because there is no place for you here at Forrester Creations.",
        "Ridge: So, really, that's what you're doing? You're gonna throw your weight around?",
        "Rick: If you don't like it, don't let the door hit you.",
        "Caroline: Can we please just talk? Just the two of us alone?",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Ridge: I have an idea. I got her into this. Don't take it out on her.",
        "Rick: Don't tell me what to do.",
        "Ridge: Okay. I'm just suggesting maybe you should talk to your wife.",
        "Rick: I don't care what any of you think... except for our new lead model.",
        "Maya: Lead?",
        "Ridge: Oh, God.",
        "Maya: Oh, thank you. Thank you.",
        "Rick: Caroline, I'd like you to get to work on a dress for Maya -- a showstopper.",
        "Ridge: We've already designed a showstopper.",
        "Rick: Yeah, it's pretty basic, actually. I really want something that showcases Maya's beauty.",
        "Caroline: No.",
        "Rick: Excuse me?",
        "Caroline: You're just rubbing this in my face. You're trying to make it as painful as possible.",
        "Rick: This is your job.",
        "Caroline: It was a few kisses! That is it! And I know that it was wrong. But you are seriously losing it. Think about what you're doing. You are latching yourself onto Maya? You are hurt, and you are upset, and you are angry. But this is no way to handle it. It is not too late for us. I am not giving up on our marriage.",
        "Rick: This meeting is over.",
        "Caroline: Can we just please --",
        "Rick: Leave. All of you!",
        "Maya: It's good that you stood up to them.",
        "Rick: I'm CEO. They'll learn to respect that.",
        "Maya: They already are.",
        "Rick: Can I get a moment alone?",
        "Maya: Okay. I'm proud of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: [Exhales deeply]",
        "Doctor: You ready for this?",
        "Hope: Well, I think so, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, what exactly are we gonna see?",
        "Doctor: Not much at this point.",
        "Wyatt: Ah.",
        "Doctor: It's too soon to tell whether it's a boy or a girl, if that's what you're asking.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so, no rush then, right? [Chuckles]",
        "Doctor: Maybe at the next appointment. Now, make sure to tell me whether you want me to keep it secret.",
        "Hope: Uh, I don't know. I think we have to talk about it. I don't know.",
        "Doctor: You know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You okay?",
        "Caroline: No.",
        "Ridge: I wish Rick could see the mistake he's making taking this out on you.",
        "Caroline: Thank you for what you did in there. Sticking up for me.",
        "Ridge: It's the truth. It's my fault.",
        "Caroline: No. It's -- it's both our faults. I... I just got caught up in... you. Designing. Now he's...leaving me. He's hooking up with Maya. What am I supposed to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Ready for visitors?",
        "Rick: Sure.",
        "Maya: It's settling in, isn't it? The job is really yours.",
        "Rick: Yeah. What's in the bag?",
        "Maya: Well, we never properly celebrated, so... champagne and caviar.",
        "Rick: Whoa! My favorite.",
        "Maya: You're CEO. I'm lead model. If ever there were a time to celebrate...it's now.",
        "Rick: Should I open the champagne?",
        "Maya: Please?",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Maya: Uh, wait. I just want you to know... you'll forget her. In time. You will. If you just...focus on us. Now pop that cork!",
        "Rick: All right! You read my mind. [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: Ooh, watch out. There. To us.",
