        "Rick and Maya hug and he says this is really happening. He is ready for his part in the procedure. Sasha tells Zende that she has not given up on him yet. There is something special coming up tonight here in Hawaii. Sadly he says he can't. He has to get back to LA tonight. He tells her that he knows it is not fair to her and he is crazy but he cannot stay here moping over Nicole. She says he is crazy if he thinks he can leave her here all alone. Nothing this good is worth separating from him so she will be returning with him. But Hawaii has not seen the last of her. The doctor gives Steffy some instructions and tells her to stay out of the sun as much as possible and he will see her on her next visit. She tells Liam that she is erasing this ring as well as her marriage to Wyatt. He makes her sit down and insists on her drinking more water like the doctor said. She keeps wanting to talk about Wyatt. He says it was as much his fault as he made her think he did not want her in his life anymore. Now he wants to get her home and her leave one home and into his. Zende tells Sasha maybe there is still hope. Maybe Nicole has changed her mind, but they do need to go back to LA. Then Maya posts and Sasha tells Zende that the procedure will begin soon. Nicole tells Maya that she keeps hoping this whole Hawaii thing is a joke and when she has another baby that Zende will be there like he was for her first.",
        "Nothing Sasha can do will cheer Zende up. He says there must be something wrong with him if he cannot see the goodness in all of this. Liam drags in boxes and boxes of Steffy's stuff. He's pretty excited as this is her house. He announces this to the house ..kitchen, this is Steffy .patio this is Steffy, neighbors this is Steffy. She's back! As the procedure is about to begin Nicole suddenly says she cannot do this. She cannot lose Zende. It is wrong and she should not have let it get this far. Maya says no need to apologize; they understand. She needs to call Zende as soon as possible and let him know. Sasha tells Zende that Nicole signed up for this as she thinks it is a gift. Nicole is a saint but they cannot all feel that way. And if she will ask this of him what else might she ask. She is taking him for granted. And if he were her man she would be thanking him every damn day of her life. She kisses him ..and then again. Nicole calls Zende but only gets voice mail. She says she has a lot to tell him so just call as soon as he can. Liam drags Steffy back into the house after telling the sand that Steffy is home and now he is going to put a real ring on her finger."

        "Maya: Almost time.",
        "Rick: Are you ready?",
        "Dr. March: The question is, are you?",
        "Rick: Now?",
        "Dr. March: If you'll follow me...",
        "Rick: This is really happening.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] [Sighs contentedly] Thanks to my sister.",
        "Sasha: Ahem.",
        "Zende: Oh. Hey. Uh, how was the beach?",
        "Sasha: Well [Sighs] It would have been more fun with some company. But don't worry. I haven't given up on you yet. There's a luau tonight that, yeah, I'm dragging you to. What? What is it?",
        "Zende: I can't, all right? I-I got to get back to L.A.",
        "[Clicking] You hanging in there?",
        "Steffy: Yep. Yep. Easy-peasy. Okay, this is not the most comfortable thing in the world.",
        "Liam: Uh-huh. Good news is we're almost finished.",
        "Steffy: Yes? With the first session.",
        "Steffy: Ohhh. Just remind me the next time I want to get a tattoo how much this hurts, please?",
        "Liam: I'll remind you the next time you want to get a new husband. How's that?",
        "Steffy: You are so funny. So funny. Time to let your immune system do a little work. It's best to limit alcohol. Drink plenty of water.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Liam: So, how many more treatments? Hard to say. Black ink tends to be easier to remove, so that bodes well. Here's the antibiotic ointment. Use it. Keep your hand out of the sun as much as possible. It might blister or scab. Please don't pick.",
        "Steffy: Yep. You got it. I won't.",
        "Liam: So, is this your first wedding-band tattoo? In this town? Getting rid of ring tattoos paid off my mortgage. I'll be in touch to schedule your next appointment. Call me if you have any questions.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Liam: Whoo! You did great.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Thank you. I was trying so hard not to swear like a sailor. I just didn't want you to think I was, like, some kind of wimp. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Uh, nobody thinks that.",
        "Steffy: Except Wyatt, maybe.",
        "Liam: Yo. Where's that coming from?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. I guess it's just all sinking in. I'm erasing this ring. I'm erasing my marriage. But as painful as it is, I had to do it, 'cause I'm where I'm supposed to be... with you.",
        "Sasha: You want to go back to L.A. Right now?",
        "Zende: You can stay, all right? I'll make sure you're taken care of. I just can't be here, moping around, thinking about Nicole, all right? It's unfair to you, and I'm ruining your trip.",
        "Sasha: Hey, no. You're not ruining anything. And you're crazy if you think I'm letting you get back on that plane all on your own. You are way more important than any luau. Call the pilot, okay? I'll go pack my things.",
        "Maya: Are you nervous?",
        "Nicole: No. You?",
        "Maya: Yes.",
        "Nicole: Oh, come on. You've done this before. Old hat, right? Wake me when I'm pregnant.",
        "Maya: It's not too late, you know? I won't be upset if you change your mind.",
        "Nicole: Maya, we're here. I'm in the gown.",
        "Maya: Yeah. Well, as important as this baby is to me and rick, it is not worth sacrificing your happiness. We have other options.",
        "Nicole: This gets you exactly what you want. So I want that, too.",
        "Liam: All right. Okay. Stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Let me -- let me do this.",
        "Steffy: No. I'm just a little sore. I'm com-- I am fine.",
        "Liam: Let me do this.",
        "Steffy: It's a tattoo removal. It's not like an appendectomy.",
        "Liam: You need to sit down and have some water, right? Didn't he say that was important -- the water, huh?",
        "Steffy: Yes.",
        "Liam: It's not an appendectomy, although the two are, uh, similar in some ways. They're both getting rid of something no longer useful.",
        "Steffy: Ouch.",
        "Liam: What? What, is that bad?",
        "Steffy: You're saying Wyatt is useless.",
        "Liam: No, I'm not talking about Wyatt. Not that hand.",
        "Steffy: I know. I know. I know.",
        "Liam: I'm talking about the marriage.",
        "Steffy: Ohh. Wyatt and I -- we needed each other. I think the mistake was to think that the marriage was gonna last forever. The other mistake was to think that you were never gonna come back.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I mean, you can't really blame yourself for that, 'cause, obviously, I did something to make you think it.",
        "Steffy: We hurt Wyatt, and... I didn't think you were coming back, and we lost so much time.",
        "Liam: Says the girl who made me wait and wait and wait and wait.",
        "Steffy: Some things are worth the wait.",
        "Liam: Yes! Yes, they are, like you moving back in with me.",
        "Steffy: Oh, which reminds me -- we need to go back to the loft. I got to get some stuff out of the hall closet.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Okay. Ready when you are.",
        "Steffy: Look, I just want to, um... I want to thank you for understanding and knowing that I just don't want to rush in to this. I just didn't want to, like, go out of Wyatt's door and immediately into yours.",
        "Liam: I know.",
        "Steffy: The divorce is in process, and... this ring is coming off.",
        "Liam: You had to wait until you felt free to be with me. And now you do. Let's get you home.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Sasha: Well, I am all packed.",
        "Zende: Wish I could have lived up to my promise and showed you the island.",
        "Sasha: Well, I make the best of things. That's what I do. Oh, but I promise I will be back. Hawaii has not seen the last of me.",
        "Zende: I realize you're just trying to make me feel better, but I know this is not exactly what you expected.",
        "Sasha: You know, it could be worse. At least you're not having me keep it a secret.",
        "Zende: No. Nicole knows I brought you here. I'm sure probably everybody knows. I know Maya will have an earful for us.",
        "Sasha: Oh, please. She's too busy posting every damn step of the surrogacy.",
        "Zende: Any new updates?",
        "Sasha: The last one was just a goofy picture of rick in the hospital cafeteria.",
        "Zende: Maybe there's still hope. Maybe Nicole will change her mind.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Sasha: Is that her?",
        "Zende: No. The jet's ready. Let's go. Let's go back to L.A.",
        "Maya: You promise you don't feel pressured?",
        "Nicole: Not at all. What I feel... is how strongly you and rick want to have another baby. If I can do that for you... give Lizzy another sibling... I will.",
        "Maya: And what about Zende?",
        "Nicole: He can still come around.",
        "Maya: Like he did when Lizzy was born, showing up to the hospital?",
        "Nicole: I keep wishing he'll pull that off again... that this whole Hawaii thing is a joke... that I'll look up... and he'll walk in wearing scrubs.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Dr. March: Looks like we're almost ready. Any last-minute questions or concerns?",
        "Maya: No. I think we're good.",
        "Zende: I appreciate you doing this on such short notice. No problem. Settle in. We'll be taking off soon.",
        "Sasha: Hey. Do you want a magazine? I mean, they're mostly girly, but I'm sure I've got something in here that's fitness-related if you want to look at that.",
        "Zende: What's wrong with me?",
        "Sasha: What do you mean, what's wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with you.",
        "Zende: Why can't I see the good in this? Why can't I appreciate this tremendous sacrifice that she's making, if she's making it?",
        "Sasha: Oh, boy.",
        "Zende: What?",
        "Sasha: Uh, well, Maya just posted.",
        "Zende: And?",
        "Sasha: And... they're about to start.",
        "Zende: It's happening. She's doing it. It's over.",
        "Dr. March: I'll be right back.",
        "Rick: Oh, okay.",
        "Maya: Do you need anything -- water? Hi!",
        "Rick: Hi.",
        "Maya: Just think... nine months from now, we could be holding a brand-new baby.",
        "Rick: Little brother or sister for Lizzy.",
        "Maya: I guess we'd better not get ahead of ourselves.",
        "Rick: Well, we kind of got spoiled the first time.",
        "Maya: Yeah.",
        "Rick: What do you think, Nicole? You thinking one time and pregnant?",
        "Nicole: With any luck.",
        "Dr. March: Okay. All set. Nicole, let's get you as comfortable as possible.",
        "Nicole: Oh. Uh...okay.",
        "Dr. March: If you're ready.",
        "Maya: Nicole?",
        "Nicole: Wait.",
        "Liam: All right. And... we're done.",
        "Steffy: Ah! Ah! Ah! Watch the finger! Watch the finger!",
        "Liam: Oh, sorry! Oh, my god! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Did I hurt you?",
        "Steffy: It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, wow. You're excited.",
        "Liam: I'm really sorry.",
        "Steffy: No, no. It's okay.",
        "Liam: I am excited, though. I am pretty excited 'cause you're home.",
        "Steffy: I am.",
        "Liam: You are home. Do you hear that, house? Do you hear that?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, house.",
        "Liam: Steffy's home.",
        "Steffy: Did you miss me? You miss me?",
        "Liam: Oh, did it miss you? Every room in this house missed you. Hey, living room, we had a lot of conversations about this, did we not? You were begging for her to come back, and now she's back. Kitchen! Oh, kitchen!",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Look who it is! Huh? Look at that face. Hey, patio! Patio! I got something to show you! Hey, neighbors! Hey! Hold on a second. Hey, neighbors! No, they're not even home now. What am I doing? Um, hey, sky! Sky! And, uh, oh, oh, oh, ocean! Hey, ocean! And, um, what's in the ocean? Whales and dolphins and seagulls and sea horses. Do we have sea horses in California? I'm not sure. But Steffy's back! She's back, baby! She's better than ever! Aren't you?",
        "Steffy: I love you.",
        "Liam: I love you.",
        "Maya: Is something wrong?",
        "Nicole: I can't do it. Part of me really...wants to, but...I can't.",
        "Maya: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Rick: You don't need to explain yourself.",
        "Nicole: I can't... lose Zende. And him taking off to Hawaii with Sasha...really opened my eyes to how much this is hurting him. He shouldn't have done it. It's wrong. But... I understand. I'm telling him that he's not important, that he can wait.",
        "Maya: It's okay, honey. We get it. We do.",
        "Nicole: I'm sorry.",
        "Maya: Don't apologize.",
        "Rick: We don't want you doing this even if you have the slightest doubt.",
        "Maya: Let me get your phone, okay? You need to call Zende. Tell him you changed your mind. We've reached our cruising altitude. It's now safe to unbuckle and move about.",
        "Sasha: Hmm? Want to play?",
        "Zende: No. I can't concentrate right now.",
        "Sasha: Good. Then I guess I'll win. [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: I keep thinking about Nicole.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, I can tell.",
        "Zende: This choice she's making.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, and, uh, it is her choice. She... she signed up for this. She sees it as some beautiful gift.",
        "Zende: It was beautiful -- her giving birth the first time. It was life- changing. Why can't I feel that way now?",
        "Sasha: Because you're a normal human being. Nicole is the saint, but she can't expect us to be that way. She certainly can't expect her boyfriend to be jumping up and down for joy when she wants to give away her body again. How much can she expect of you, Zende? And don't get me wrong -- I don't want to badmouth her. She's my sister. She's my best friend. But come on. If she's willing to ask this of you, what else is she willing to ask?",
        "Zende: She's not thinking ahead. She's - she's just doing what she thinks is right.",
        "Sasha: At your expense. She's taking you for granted. And it's a shame. [Scoffs] If you were my man, I would be thanking my lucky stars every damn day of my life.",
        "Zende: You would?",
        "Sasha: Every...damn...day.",
        "Nicole: Come on. Pick up. Pick up the phone.",
        "[Ringing]",
        "Zende: Hey. It's Zende. Leave a message. I'll get back to you.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Nicole: Hey. It's me. We have to talk. I... I have so much to tell you, and... just come home, please. We'll get through this. All you have to do is call me, okay? Just call me as soon as you can.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Will you stop shouting?",
        "Liam: No. No. Sorry. No can do -- not until everybody knows.",
        "Steffy: All of Malibu knows.",
        "Liam: Uh, no. I'm not so sure about that. I haven't told...the sand. Hey, sand. Hey, sand. Guess what. Did you know Steffy's back? Did you know that?",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: What? Come on. It's been a long time coming. I'm allowed to be a little excited, don't you think?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, you are. You definitely are.",
        "Liam: Well, guess what. If you think this is excited... wait until you hear how loud I shout... when this heals... and there's no... bruising and there's no discoloration... and I put a ring here -- a real wedding ring that you wear for the rest of your life.",
        "Steffy: Well, then, I'll be shouting right there with you.",
        "Liam: I love you, Steffy."
