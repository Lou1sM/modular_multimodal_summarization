    "Recap": [
        "Liam puts the girls to bed and then realizes how late it is. Steffy tells him the girls are out so he can stay as late as he wants. He can only think about that he is surprised that Hope has not called the whole night. She is with Thomas and that does not bode well. Hope is with Thomas who has made the proposal he will give her custody of Douglas if she will give him what he wants. When she has this deer in the headlights look he says or they can forget this. Perhaps she is not as committed to Douglas as he thought she was. He opines she wants to be Douglas's mother and he is his father so it only makes sense that they .Ridge is pacing the floor when Shauna walks in and wants to know what he is doing. He says just waiting for Thomas who is upstairs with Hope still. Liam confides in Steffy that his dad has laid down hints and he thinks he wants him to come back to Spencer Publications. She says that is his birthright and she thinks he really should forgive his father and join him again at work. Hope feigns a sore back and Thomas guides her to the couch and starts massaging her neck. He says he never thought they would be like this and not in his bedroom. She makes specific mention that others are in this house and it is better than staying at Vinny's. Here he has Ridge, Eric, Quinn all watching out for Douglas. As he eases up she says the soreness is a little further over convincing him to keep massaging. Ridge calls Brooke and says the party has been over for a while but Hope is still here and in fact up in Thomas's room. He just hopes she is not trying to push the adoption papers on him again. Brooke says oh no, she is sure she is not. She says Donna is there so she better go. But she misses him. He tells her please do not let their children divide them again. Steffy thanks Liam for bringing Beth over and for the hundredth time he reminds her that he will always be in her life. She gets a phone call and puts it down right away but Liam realizes it must be a dating site. She covers by saying she might not need a man in her life but sometimes she does need a man. Thomas finishes his massage and asks Hope if that is easing her tension. Then he wants to get right back to the thought at hand. He puts himself closer to her as Hope has moved away a little. He tells her that her skin is so soft and leans in to kiss her neck. She pulls away and he says he must have been getting mixed signals.",
        "Hope says no she did not mean to. She does want to help raise Douglas but she and Liam will eventually get married and she has Beth with him and will live with them and co-parent Douglas with Thomas. No he wants more. He wants to be the man in her life. She has what she wants, he will have what he wants. They can be adults about this and even seal the deal tonight. Liam is besides himself if there is a whole new person in Steffy's life. And if it is not the first date there will be another. Any man on the planet would want her. She says she will not be with anyone who does not understand how important Liam is to her. Shauna tells Ridge that she wishes he did not have these issues with Brooke. She would be on her side if it were her in those overpriced shoes. She tells Ridge goodnight. Thomas repeats to Hope they can make everything right tonight. She interrupts and says she wants to help raise Douglas with him but anything else is not an option. He says he is on to her. He knows why she came tonight. And anything less than her is no option for him either. So she can go now. It was fun and perhaps they can do it again another time with Douglas. Bring the papers. She looks hopeful but then he asks for one last hug. He won't bite her ..unless she wants him to. He hugs her and whispers again that they can both have what they want tonight."

        "Liam: Huh?",
        "Steffy: You okay?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Just, um, I'm a little surprised that hope hasn't called me yet, 'cause, like, that party can't still be going, right? So, like, why wouldn't she get in touch with me? And why would she stay out this late with thomas and douglas? Like...",
        "Hope: What are you saying?",
        "Thomas: You heard me. You give me you... I give you douglas.",
        "Hope: You want me... in exchange for a place in douglas' life?",
        "Thomas: Not if you don't want to. Look, maybe we should just forget this.",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, the whole thing, the custody, everything. I mean, maybe you're not as committed to this as I thought you were.",
        "Brooke: We all know that thomas isn't fit to be a parent to that little boy.",
        "Donna: Yes. But the con that hope's trying to pull--it's risky.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, it worries me.",
        "Donna: It's risky to you, too. Your marriage to ridge.",
        "Ridge: [ Exhales deeply ]",
        "Shauna: Hi.",
        "Ridge: Hi.",
        "[ Door closes ]",
        "Shauna: Sorry. I came to raid the pantry for a bottle of water.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, raid away.",

        "Shauna: What are you doing?",
        "Ridge: Thomas is up there with hope.",
        "Shauna: She's still here?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, she's still here, and they're in his room. Makes me think she's up to something.",
        "Donna: I'm already worried about your marriage to ridge. And now I find out you and hope are keeping this secret.",
        "Brooke: I don't wanna keep a secret from ridge. But what am I supposed to do? He's not seeing things clearly. He doesn't see the danger that douglas is in.",
        "Donna: If ridge finds out...",
        "Brooke: Not just ridge. Liam can't find out either. He'd be really upset with hope. She might be making a huge mistake tonight.",
        "Liam: I mean, I know that there's probably no reason to be concerned. It's just a little weird, right, that hope is over there right now with your brother.",
        "Steffy: Well, thank you for trying to be the voice of reason with them.",
        "Liam: I mean, douglas is caroline's son. I-I feel protective of him. I feel like he's my responsibility. I just don't agree that us adopting him is what's in his best interest.",
        "Shauna: You really think that hope's up to something?",
        "Ridge: I do, which means that brooke is up to something as well.",
        "Shauna: Involving thomas?",
        "Ridge: They better not be trying to...",
        "Shauna: What?",
        "Ridge: Trying to take douglas away from my son.",
        "Hope: What are you talking about? I-I...I thought we both wanted what was best for douglas.",
        "Thomas: I thought so, too. I did. Uh, but maybe I was mistaken. Look, douglas loves you, and you want to be his mother, and I'm his father. I think it just makes sense that we would...",
        "Hope: I'm just confused. I'm just trying to process...",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Hope: ...This.",
        "Thomas: Maybe a backrub would help.",
        "Hope: Uh... [ Chuckles nervously ] Actually, I-I'm fine.",
        "Thomas: You will be fine... with me. I'm truly amazed at the effect that it has on people.",
        "Steffy: I don't trust thomas with much right now, but I do trust him to do right by his son.",
        "Liam: Thanks. Cute. Well, I-I don't trust him, not necessarily, not yet, but-- but it's not just thomas. I mean, ridge is around.",
        "Steffy: And my granddad and quinn.",
        "Liam: Right, see? Okay. So this is what I'm saying. I mean, the more loving adults in douglas' life, the better, even--even quinn.",
        "Steffy: She did raise your brother, and he turned out halfway decent.",
        "Liam: Halfway, huh?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, he'd take it as a compliment.",
        "Liam: Yeah, he probably would.",
        "Steffy: Tell wyatt I miss seeing him around at the office, and I'll never forgive him for going back to spencer publications.",
        "Liam: Oh, I will. I will. So speaking of spencer publications...",
        "Steffy: Oh, no. You?",
        "Liam: Yeah. My dad, you know, he's been...s-sprinkling little hints here and there. He wants me to come back.",
        "Steffy: And?",
        "Liam: I don't know. I don't know if that's what's right for me.",
        "Steffy: Well, as your boss, I'd hate to lose you. You're invaluable to forrester. As your friend, I... I say go for it. It is your birthright.",
        "Liam: It's taken a long time for me to get to a place where I would consider working with my dad again.",
        "Steffy: You know I would do anything to take back--",
        "Liam: Steffy...",
        "Steffy: You know that.",
        "Liam: Steffy. Forgive yourself, really, 'cause I have. Forgive and move on.",
        "Steffy: I'm trying. Maybe it's time for you to move on, too. Forgive bill. Go back to spencer publications. And it would be good for pam, cut her baking time in half.",

        "Brooke: She is?",
        "Ridge: I'm hoping she's not trying to convince him to sign over custody of douglas. It'd be a big mistake.",

        "Thomas: Yeah, I do. I do want what's best for him. I mean, that's why I want us to be together, close. You know, raising him together. But you know, hmm. I can't just put away my feelings. [ Chuckles ] You know, I just... I have to be close to you when I'm with you, but that's okay, right?

        "Hope: Sometimes, but...",
        "Thomas: I still say liam's better off with steffy.",
        "Hope: No, because that's not going to happen. Liam and I are probably going to get married, and you and i will be co-parents.",
        "Thomas: No, hope. I want more. I want a relationship. I want to be the man lying next to you at night. Come on. I have what you want. You have what I want. Let's be adults about this. Hey. We can seal the deal tonight.",

        "Liam: No, it's not--it'S...",
        "[ Groans ] [ Chuckles ] It's not easy to think about because...a man in your life means a man in--in kelly's life. That's a whole new person with opinions and--and parenting theories. Oh, my god. I hate him already. I hate him so much.",
        "Steffy: Okay, you're getting all worked up about a hypothetical guy that doesn't even exist.",
        "Liam: He's gonna exist. He's gonna exist, and it's gonna be sooner than later because you're a catch. Steffy, the--there's not a guy on the planet that wouldn't swipe right, trust me.",
        "Steffy: I do trust you. Maybe I'll have you write up my profile.",
        "[ Laughter ]",
        "Liam: I feel like having the ex-husband write the profile might, I don't know, scare off a guy or two. I'm not sure.",
        "Steffy: Well, I'm not gonna date anyone who doesn't understand how important you are to me, how important you'll always be.",
        "Shauna: I hate seeing you get so worked up over this.",
        "Ridge: Well, it's frustrating. And it's disrespectful.",
        "Shauna: I know. I mean, you're thomas' dad. You know him better than anyone. And brooke should know that. She should trust you. I would if I were in her overpriced shoes.",
        "Ridge: Well, it's late, so she's probably in overpriced slippers at this point.",
        "Shauna: That's true. Aw, it's good to see you still smiling.",
        "Ridge: Seems to happen a lot with you around.",
        "Shauna: Speaking of late, uh, I should get my water and head back to the guest house because, you know, I have a whole beauty routine that I have to do tonight, as you know.",
        "Ridge: I know.",
        "Shauna: [ Laughs ] Good night, ridge.",
        "Ridge: Good night.",
        "Brooke: Ohh. God, I don't like this.",
        "Donna: I don't either. You and ridge should be working together, trying for common ground. He's gonna be so upset if he figures out what hope is doing.",
        "Brooke: Ridge doesn't think that thomas is dangerous, but he is. And now my daughter's alone with him.",
        "Thomas: Let's do this starting tonight.",
        "Hope: I want you in my life. I do. But in a healthy, nurturing way to douglas. Anything else isn't an option.",
        "Thomas: Okay. Then co-parenting isn't an option.",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Thomas: Why are you doing this? [ Chuckles ] Why are you here wasting my time?",
        "Hope: Wasting your time? Thomas.",
        "Thomas: [ Laughs ]& Look, I see right through you. Come on, hope. You come here tonight. You're being nice to me. You're flirting. Look, I get it. You want custody of my child. Okay? You're doing what I would do, but that's not you. And I am being open and honest about what I want, okay? What I need. You have to show me there's a-- there's a possible future for us. That's what it would take for you to have my son.",
        "Hope: And you somehow think by doing this, this is gonna bring us closer together? Bribing me for a life with your son for sex? You're doing the opposite.",
        "Thomas: Fine. Go. Go ahead. It was a nice night. [ Chuckles ] We should do it again soon. You, me, and douglas. [ Door opens ] Hey. Bring those papers.",
        "Hope: I'd like that.",
        "Thomas: One last hug? I promise I won't bite. Unless you want me to. You need douglas. I need you."
