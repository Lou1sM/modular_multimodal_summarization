        "Nick continues to hold Stephanie tightly by the scruff of her jacket dangling her head over the banister. But, he pulls her back and admits he's not like her. She manages to run to her bedroom with him close behind. He kicks in the locked door, breaking it from the hinges. He looks at Stephanie and finds himself staring down the barrel of a loaded gun. She says she will use it and denies pushing Jackie; it WAS an accident. Ridge, Eric and Brooke all agree they need to get to the house as Stephanie is alone with Nick. They arrive and run up the stairs just in time as Stephanie puts a bullet through the wall over Nick's head. She warns him to get out or they will take him out in a body bag. Eric takes the gun from Stephanie and they all convince a reluctant Nick to leave and go be with his mother. Donna stays behind at Brooke's house and calls Storm. He comes over and confirms that Stephanie could be charged with aggravated assault even if Jackie was at Stephanie's house uninvited. But he feels she just wants the Royal Family to finally have the Queen's head on a platter. Brooke and Nick argue over \u0091the facts' and the fact that she already knew. He's livid and vows to use that information to bring Stephanie down once and for all. Storm advises Nick that he could press charges against Stephanie and perhaps send her to prison. Meanwhile, Stephanie has to defend her actions again to Eric and Ridge. Then she calls Donna and reads her the riot act for starting all of this; Nick and Brooke hear all on the speaker phone. Donna is very excited about bringing Stephanie down, quibbling with Brooke over the difference in justice and revenge. Nick too seems very interested in the idea of making Stephanie pay."

        "Nick: Tell me, you said it was an accident. You lie, you lie!",
        "Stephanie: I'm not lying!",
        "Nick: You don't give a damn who you hurt!",
        "Stephanie: Nick, please, you're frightening me. You're hurting me. Let me go, please!",
        "Nick: It would be so easy -- it would be so easy. But I'm not like you. And neither is my mother. Don't you run from me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I still can't get through to Nick.",
        "Donna: How's Jackie?",
        "Eric: She's sleeping.",
        "Brooke: He should be here. His mother needs him.",
        "Eric: I'll try Stephanie again.",
        "Donna: Maybe Nick didn't even go over there. We would've heard something if he did.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Any change in Jackie's condition?",
        "Eric: Ridge? What are you doing here? I thought you were with your mother.",
        "Ridge: I just had to sign some papers at the office. And I thought I'd check in on Jackie on my way home. Why? What's wrong?",
        "Eric: Stephanie's alone.",
        "Brooke: Nick went over there. He's furious.",
        "Donna: I told him your mother pushed Jackie over the railing.",
        "Ridge: What? Why would you do that?",
        "Brooke: Donna was there.",
        "Ridge: Look, I know mother was irritated with Jackie. They argued, but she would never --",
        "Donna: She did. I've ran the moment in my head 100 times, and there's no doubt about it. Jackie didn't fall, she was pushed.",
        "Ridge: Dad, you're not buying this, are you?",
        "Brooke: Jackie confirmed it.",
        "Donna: I know you don't want to hear this about your mother, but it's true.",
        "Ridge: And you're the one who told him this?",
        "Donna: I'm sorry.",
        "Ridge: We've got to get over there.",
        "Eric: Yeah, we do. Brooke, come with us. You're probably the only one who can calm Nick down. Come on.",
        "Brooke: All right. Donna?",
        "Donna: No, you handle it. I've got to take care of something.",
        "Donna: Hey, it's me. I need to talk to you right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie! Open the door! You are going to face what you've done! You are going to face what you did! You are going to face it and you are going to pay for it!",
        "Stephanie: You son of a bitch.",
        "Stephanie: I will shoot.",
        "Nick: Tell me the truth. Tell me you pushed her.",
        "Stephanie: No. I did not push her. I begged her to leave.",
        "Nick: You are going to admit what you've done, and you are going to be held accountable!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Donna remembering]",
        "Donna: You are gonna regret treating me this way, Stephanie. I mean, really regret.",
        "Stephanie: He destroyed that marriage all on his own.",
        "Jackie: No, you! You! You were the one!",
        "Stephanie: I'm telling you, stop this. I'm warning you. Oh, shut up, Jackie! Let go of me!",
        "[Jackie screams]",
        "Donna: Is she alive?",
        "Stephanie: I don't know. What are you doing here?",
        "Donna: I couldn't leave! Her car was blocking me.",
        "Stephanie: Yes. Yes. 9-1-1 -- yes, this is the Forrester residence. Yeah, we've had a terrible accident. Please. Someone's fallen down a whole flight of stairs. We need the paramedics, we need the fire department, right now! Thank you. Oh, my god! Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Donna: Storm, thanks for coming.",
        "Storm: Oh, I got here as fast as I could. A mysterious, urgent phone call from my sister. What's up?",
        "Donna: Look, I know you're busy working on Taylor's defense, but I need to pick your brain about something.",
        "Storm: Oh no. No, no, no. If this is about Ridge and Brooke, I plead the fifth.",
        "Donna: Actually, it's about Jackie Marone. You heard what happened.",
        "Storm: The accident at the Forrester house, yeah.",
        "Donna: It wasn't an accident, Storm. Stephanie shoved her over the railing. I saw it. I was there.",
        "Storm: You're saying it was deliberate?",
        "Donna: Stephanie and Jackie were arguing on the landing, and Stephanie just shoved her!",
        "Storm: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I know Stephanie's done a lot of horrible things --",
        "Donna: Stephanie is telling everyone that Jackie fell.",
        "Storm: And what does Jackie say?",
        "Donna: Well, Jackie can barely talk. But she nodded when Nick asked her about it. Is that enough?",
        "Storm: Enough for what?",
        "Donna: Prosecution.",
        "Storm: Donna --",
        "Donna: Stephanie is blaming this whole thing on Jackie, said that Jackie was trespassing. Stephanie told her to leave, but she wouldn't.",
        "Storm: Well, that's immaterial. If Stephanie intentionally pushed her, it's assault, whether Jackie had permission to be there or not.",
        "Donna: So that's a criminal charge?",
        "Storm: A case could be made for aggravated assault. Normally, that involves a weapon. But I'm sure a jury could be convinced that pushing someone off a second story landing would definitely result in bodily harm.",
        "Donna: So Stephanie Forrester could go to prison? And she couldn't hurt anyone else ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Nick, this isn't helping your mother. She needs you. Leave!",
        "Nick: I'm not afraid of you. And you know it.",
        "Eric: Stephanie? Stephanie?",
        "Ridge: Mother?",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Brooke: Oh! Oh, my god!",
        "Stephanie: Leave. Or they'll take you out of here in a body bag.",
        "Eric: Stephanie? Stephanie?",
        "Ridge: Mother!",
        "Brooke: Nick!",
        "Eric: Stephanie, stop this! Stop!",
        "Ridge: Look, he's not worth it. It's not going to accomplish anything.",
        "Eric: It's all right now. It's all right. Everything's okay now. I'm here, you're safe. Give me the gun.",
        "Ridge: You, get out of here!",
        "Nick: I want her to admit what she did! Admit what you did to my mother! Admit it!",
        "Eric: You know where you are, Nick? You know where you are? This is my house!",
        "Brooke: Nick, please -- if Stephanie is responsible for what happened to Jackie, we'll deal with it. But not like this! Go to the hospital. Be with your mother.",
        "Nick: I want the truth. I want you to admit what you did!",
        "Ridge: You came here to try and bully her into confessing what she didn't do.",
        "Nick: She's guilty!",
        "Stephanie: I'm not.",
        "Brooke: Please, go to the hospital.",
        "Nick: The next time you shoot -- don't miss.",
        "Stephanie: I wont.",
        "Brooke: Stephanie, Donna saw you.",
        "Stephanie: Your sister has an axe to grind with me. What do you mean, she saw me?",
        "Brooke: Are you calling her a liar?",
        "Ridge: Mother, Donna said she saw you through the window.",
        "Stephanie: I don't care what Donna saw. I didn't do anything wrong!",
        "Brooke: There's a witness. You can't deny what happened.",
        "Ridge: Brooke, do you honestly believe mother deliberately pushed her over the balcony?",
        "Brooke: Did you?",
        "Stephanie: No, Brooke. Now, I've already told you -- we were arguing. She grabbed me. She was pulling at me. Was it my intention for her to fall over a balcony onto a marble floor below? Of course not. I was trying to get away from her. Why do you think I came up the stairs in the first place? I was defending myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Dr. Hillman? It's Nick Marone. Yeah, just glad I caught you. Just checking in on my mother, to see how she's doing, any changes? Well, that's great. That's great news. Thank you. Listen, you've got all my numbers. If anything happens, just keep me posted.",
        "Brooke: Nick? Oh, god, I caught you before you left. Can we talk, please?",
        "Nick: I don't want to talk.",
        "Brooke: Are you okay?",
        "Nick: Other than the fact that she pulled a gun on me?",
        "Brooke: She was scared, obviously.",
        "Nick: Because I was going to throw her over the same landing my mother went over, but I didn't.",
        "Brooke: Attacking Stephanie is not going to help your mother.",
        "Nick: Why are you defending this woman? My mother's in a hospital bed because of her.",
        "Brooke: I know. And if she is responsible --",
        "Nick: She is responsible! Did you not hear what your sister said? Unless, of course, you think she's lying.",
        "Brooke: I just want to be cautious until we know all the facts.",
        "Nick: Oh, please. We know the facts. Stephanie tried to kill my mother. Those are the facts.",
        "Brooke: This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.",
        "Nick: What does that mean? What does that mean? Did you know about this? You did, didn't you? When you were at the hospital, you knew that Stephanie tried to hurt my mother. Your sister told you beforehand, didn't she?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Nick: Why wouldn't you tell me?",
        "Brooke: Because, Nick, I didn't want you to come over here and threaten Stephanie, exactly the way that you did. You could've been killed!",
        "Nick: I can't believe you wouldn't tell me. Hasn't this woman gotten away with enough? For god's sake, somebody's got to stand up to her! She keeps pushing and pushing, like she's above the law. And my mother's the one paying the price for it. Well, no more! The information that your sister has -- what she saw -- I will use that to take Stephanie Forrester down once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Storm: I said Stephanie could be charged. I never said anything about guaranteed conviction.",
        "Donna: But there's enough evidence to make a case.",
        "Storm: That would be up to the DA.",
        "Donna: Well, I saw what happened.",
        "Storm: You really want to see Stephanie Forrester put in jail, don't you?",
        "Donna: She committed a crime, storm.",
        "Storm: You know, when you first moved to LA, you were talking about the Forresters like they were the royal family. Now, all of a sudden, you want to see the queen's head on a platter?",
        "Donna: I just want her to pay for what she's done.",
        "Storm: To you, or to Jackie? Oh, come on. You already told me how she's been treating you lately. And you know what? To be honest, you have every right to be angry, you know?",
        "Donna: Stephanie Forrester doesn't give a damn about anybody but herself. To her, we're just pawns in her game. And if she can't use us, she just knocks us out of the way. Just like she did to Jackie. And just like she's trying to do to me. Only now, she can't, because I've got her. And this is checkmate.",
        "Storm: This could be a significant problem to Stephanie, but it could be problematic for you, too.",
        "Donna: How?",
        "Storm: Well, with Ridge, for one.",
        "Donna: Yeah. Well, I already told him what I saw.",
        "Storm: And?",
        "Donna: And the truth is the truth. It doesn't matter what Stephanie's family thinks about it.",
        "Storm: Hmm. So, that's all he is to you now? Just part of Stephanie's family?",
        "Donna: Should I let Stephanie get away with what's she's done because I was involved with Ridge? No. She's gotten away with too much already. What she did to Mom and Dad -- sending them off to Paris, splitting our family apart. And what she's done to Brooke all these years. Stephanie has never respected a Logan. We don't owe her a thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Brooke: Donna's told you everything.",
        "Nick: I want to talk to her again.",
        "Brooke: Storm?",
        "Donna: I called him.",
        "Nick: I don't need a lawyer.",
        "Donna: Stephanie might.",
        "Storm: You know what, Nick? I understand your rage. I've felt if myself for everything that Stephanie's done to my family. But if you really want to get back at Stephanie, I know what to do.",
        "Nick: I'm listening.",
        "Storm: Well, with Donna as a witness, you could press charges against her for aggravated assault.",
        "Nick: Prosecute her?",
        "Brooke: Send her to prison?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Oh, my god. I can't believe he threw a chair through the window!",
        "Stephanie: He was crazy.",
        "Eric: Stephanie, look at me. Did you push her over that balcony?",
        "Stephanie: No, Eric. And don't you ask me that again. I told you, she grabbed me and she would not let go.",
        "Ridge: We know you didn't mean to hurt her.",
        "Stephanie: Of course not. The tragedy of the whole thing is it wouldn't have happened if she just left.",
        "Eric: Don't blame this on Jackie. She's the one in a hospital bed. She may never walk again.",
        "Stephanie: Well, you're not believing Donna. I mean, who would believe anything Donna would say? Listen, Eric, I am not the person that's crashing through windows and breaking down doors. I didn't start this with Jackie. I didn't push into her home.",
        "Ridge: All right. Let's get this stuff cleaned up.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I guess I have a little something of my own to clean up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Aggravated assault?",
        "Storm: Well, the DA might not want to take it that far. But I think a case could be made.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Donna: It's Stephanie.",
        "Nick: Maybe she wants to sell you the other half of Forrester Creations.",
        "Donna: Hello?",
        "Stephanie: Well, hello, Ms. Opportunity.",
        "Donna: Well, hello to you, too, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Feeling pretty good about yourself, are you?",
        "Donna: I'm feeling better than Jackie Marone.",
        "Stephanie: Donna, I do not want you repeating what you've been telling everybody. Do you hear me?",
        "Donna: Oh, yes, Stephanie. I hear you loud and clear.",
        "Stephanie: I don't want my reputation damaged by your baseless accusations.",
        "Donna: You think I'm lying?",
        "Stephanie: Yes. You're just like your mother. A social climber. I don't even understand why you're involved in any of this tragedy. I mean, what do you think? You're going to parlay it into something? Money, revenge? Why would you get Nick riled up like that and then turn him loose?",
        "Donna: You threw his mother off a second floor landing. Of course, he's going to be angry.",
        "Stephanie: No, I did not. And he's angry because of what you told him.",
        "Donna: Stephanie, I saw you.",
        "Stephanie: I don't care what you think you saw. Jackie came after me. What happened to her is her own damn fault!",
        "Nick: Amazing. No remorse. None.",
        "Brooke: She's just protecting herself, Nick. Whatever you said to her must have really freaked her out.",
        "Storm: This is how Stephanie acts when she's scared.",
        "Donna: Stephanie doesn't get scared. She gets even.",
        "Nick: Well, now it's our turn.",
        "Storm: You know, Nick, criminal prosecution isn't your only option. You have an even better case for a civil suit.",
        "Nick: No, I don't want the Forrester's money.",
        "Storm: Stephanie would have to pay for your mother's care. Plus, in the public's eyes, a judgment against Stephanie means she's guilty.",
        "Nick: I want her locked up. I want her locked up the way my mother's locked up in her own body.",
        "Storm: Well, all we have to do is go to the DA with Donna's information.",
        "Donna: Jackie confirmed it. Lt. Baker is already asking questions. We could do this. We could bring Stephanie Forrester down.",
        "Brooke: All this talk about revenge and getting even isn't going to help anybody. Least of all Jackie.",
        "Donna: No, you're right. This is bigger than revenge. This is about justice. People need to know what Stephanie is capable of, Nick. They need to see what she's done. Not only to your mother, but to our family. It's time finally somebody holds her accountable for what she's done. We can do that. Finally, we can make Stephanie pay. And put her behind bars for a very long time."
