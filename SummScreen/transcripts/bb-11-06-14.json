        "Rick tells the group that nothing changes, he will not be with them this time like in Paris but Amsterdam will be looking forward to them. He wants no tension between Ivy and Hope; Ivy says no problem. Rick does not invite Ridge or Caroline and they walk in wanting to know why they were excluded. Rick says Ridge is not needed, Rick is CEO now and he made the decisions. He says they have to finish their meeting so he needs them to leave. Ivy slips off and asks Liam if he will come with her. Liam says this is not just a photo shoot but the launching of her new line so she will be super busy. Also Wyatt and Hope, he and Ivy, he doesn't think this is a super idea. She says he could make an exclusive interview out of this. This does not have to be awkward. She had a chat with Hope and she is busy with her future with Wyatt so it won't be awkward. He says she makes it hard to say no. He finally says yes, Amsterdam here they come. Hope catches up with Ivy and says there is so much tension in the office but she thinks this trip will be good for the three of them. Ivy says four, she has invited Liam. Hope does not have a smile on her face. She simply says she was surprised by this. She thinks Ivy talked him into it. Ivy says she thought this was a chance for the four of them to move on. They have talked about this and they agreed Liam needs to move on. Hope says she is not exactly comfortable with this. Ivy says this is an exciting time for all of them and surely they can all get along on a plane for a few hours. She really thinks they can do this. Hope says she guesses they will find out. Maya tells Rick not to let Caroline and Ridge bother him. And if he needs to go to Amsterdam then he should; she could go too. Take the jet, give good press and just hop around. He informs her that he is not leaving L.A. The most important thing he can do now is stay here and stake his claim.",
        "Wyatt is the last one to know that Liam is coming along when he comes onboard. Wyatt tells Hope that he wishes she could have given him advance notice. Yes he was on phone the entire time but she could have pantomimed it to him. Maya seeks out Carter and tells him they have to get Caroline and Rick's marriage over today. Caroline goes to see Rick and says she just has one question. How did they get here? She knows she hurt him and she is sorry but he won't listen to that. Surely what they had means something to him. He says they have to work together but he doesn't have to like it. She laments she can hear the distain in his voice. She wants him back. He does care too otherwise he would not be acting like this. She is furious. She made one mistake and they are going to work this out so he better get Maya out of their lives. She wants him to come home."

        "Carter: Thorne already has a team in Amsterdam.",
        "Hope: And they're gonna meet us?",
        "Rick: As soon as you get there. We've got a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time. You need to hit the ground running. Communication is key on a project like this. I want you two talking. That was the point in Paris. I'm not gonna be there with you guys this time.",
        "Carter: I saw that on the manifest.",
        "Maya: Well, now that Rick is CEO, he has to stay here.",
        "Rick: But nothing changes. It's still the same game plan. Amsterdam is already in love with the Hope for the Future diamond, and it's a perfect time to launch Ivy's jewelry.",
        "Wyatt: And they already love the woman who'll be wearing it.",
        "Rick: Hope, Ivy, I want you two out front. You're a team.",
        "Hope: You got it, coach.",
        "Rick: All kidding aside, if you guys need to clear the air, do it. I don't want any tension between you two.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Understood.",
        "Hope: We all want this collection to be as successful as it can be.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. If we can have a little fun while selling it, why not, right?",
        "Ivy: Couldn't agree more.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Ivy: Oh. Uh, look, I'm really, really sorry to do this, but I have to go and sort something out before we leave, so I'll be up in the sky lounge.",
        "Ridge: Hi. Heard there was a meeting about Amsterdam.",
        "Rick: Were you copied on the memo?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Rick: Then there's no reason for you to be here.",
        "Ridge: I'd like to know what you have planned.",
        "Caroline: Someone said that you weren't going.",
        "Rick: Hope's handling the photo shoot. After all, it is her collection. That's all you need to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Liam: Hey! I got your text.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I'm sorry about all of the exclamation points. I just was worried that you weren't gonna make it.",
        "Liam: Oh. What's the matter? You couldn't leave without saying goodbye?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I--I want you to come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Rick, if you want, I can fill them in.",
        "Rick: No, Carter. There's nothing really to discuss.",
        "Caroline: You are taking the hematite necklace with the floral print, right?",
        "Hope: No, the crystal.",
        "Rick: Everything has been approved and packed for the trip.",
        "Ridge: Approved by you?",
        "Rick: I'm CEO.",
        "Ridge: I'm the designer, so if there's a creative decision --",
        "Rick: You'll be consulted if needed. You're not.",
        "Caroline: Rick, don't do this. We have to be able to work together.",
        "Rick: We are working together.",
        "Caroline: It doesn't have to be this way.",
        "Rick: We have to finish, so I'm gonna need you two to leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: If you leave right now, you can pack your bag and meet me at the jet.",
        "Liam: Ivy, you're going to Amsterdam to work.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I know, but there'll be time for some museums and some bike riding along the canals.",
        "Liam: What?! This is not just a photo shoot. I mean, Forrester's launching your line. You're gonna be really, really busy.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I know that, and pressure will be high, but with you there, I'll feel like myself, like I can relax, and, at the end of the day, that's what Rick wants.",
        "Liam: Rick? So, Rick is okay with me tagging along?",
        "Ivy: Actually, he has to stay behind -- the new C.E.O. and all.",
        "Liam: Ah. Okay. So, it's just you and Wyatt.",
        "Ivy: Uh...no. He's sending someone else in his place.",
        "Liam: Hope?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Well, the line is called Hope for the Future.",
        "Liam: Okay. So, okay. So, you, me, Wyatt, and Hope on a great big Dutch adventure? Ivy, I love the idea of traveling with you. I don't think this is a good idea.",
        "Ivy: If you don't get going, you won't have time to pack.",
        "Liam: I haven't even said that I'm going!",
        "Ivy: You know what? You could actually cover the launch for the magazine. In fact, I could hook you up with an amazing interview with the head jewelry designer.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: Really?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Not an exclusive, though? I see how it is.",
        "Ivy: Well, is an exclusive what you want? 'Cause I can talk to Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Okay. That right -- that's what I'm getting stuck on. I mean, Wyatt and Hope and us all stuck in a jet together -- [Stammers]",
        "Ivy: It doesn't have to be awkward.",
        "Liam: Oh. Are we gonna be flying through an alternate universe? Because that's the only way I can imagine it not being awkward.",
        "Ivy: No. Look... I had a chat with Hope. She understands. She -- she doesn't want to make things weird for us. She's too busy focusing on her future with Wyatt.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Liam, come on. Just come to the airport with me.",
        "Liam: You -- you -- you make it very difficult to say no.",
        "Ivy: Well, why don't you make it easier for yourself and just say yes?",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Ivy: Really? You'll go?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Amsterdam, here we come.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Did you tell Ridge about the meeting?",
        "Carter: What?",
        "Maya: Is that how he and Caroline found out?",
        "Carter: Everybody knows about the photo shoot. It's not a secret, Maya.",
        "Hope: Oh, God. I wish I had more time to prepare.",
        "Rick: Come on. Nobody knows this line better than you do.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and nobody markets jewelry better than me.",
        "Rick: I have the right people on this. I trust you guys. I just wish I could say that about everyone around here.",
        "Hope: Um, yeah -- about that. Caroline actually had a good point. I know that this is -- it's hard.",
        "Rick: It's not gonna be a distraction. I'm focused on the photo shoot. You should be, too.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Well, uh, we got a plane to catch, so wish us luck and we'll get out of here.",
        "Hope: Oh, I got to go get Ivy.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: The crystal is wrong for that dress. It doesn't pop the same way the hematite does.",
        "Ridge: A designer would know that.",
        "Caroline: This is just ridiculous. Rick can't shut us out. He needs us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Hey! There you are!",
        "Ivy: Hey! Is the meeting over?",
        "Hope: Yep. Yeah. You, uh, ready to go to the airport?",
        "Ivy: I am. I just have to go and get my things.",
        "Hope: Great! Um... I just -- I just wanted to say to you that I-I think that this trip could really be a step forward for us.",
        "Ivy: Yes. So do I.",
        "Hope: There's so much tension in the office as it is. You know, I just want you to know that I'm not trying to add to that.",
        "Ivy: Hope, that's -- that's really good to hear.",
        "Hope: Honestly, your jewelry deserves the best introduction we can give it.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Actually, I'm really excited about this.",
        "Hope: Yeah. The three of us are gonna have a good time.",
        "Ivy: Well, the -- the four of us.",
        "Hope: Oh, no. Remember? Rick isn't going.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. It's just, uh, you know, no one likes being the third wheel, and I figured that you and Wyatt would be spending a lot of time together, so I invited someone.",
        "Hope: Your dad?",
        "Ivy: Liam.",
        "Hope: You invited Liam to come to Amsterdam?",
        "Ivy: I did. He's meeting me at the jet.",
        "Hope: Liam is coming to Amsterdam?",
        "Ivy: He is. He just ran off to pack a bag.",
        "Hope: Wow. You -- you didn't mention that in the meeting.",
        "Ivy: No, that's -- I only just asked him.",
        "Hope: Oh, just now?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. Look, he -- he knows that I'm there for work. He's not going to interfere.",
        "Hope: He understands that he'll be coming with you and Wyatt and me?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. He does.",
        "Hope: Okay. [Chuckles] Uh, I -- sorry. I'm just a little surprised by this.",
        "Ivy: To be honest, Liam was, as well. He actually didn't think it was a very good idea.",
        "Hope: I might have to agree with him.",
        "Ivy: But then he, uh -- he changed his mind, so...",
        "Hope: Did you talk him into it?",
        "Ivy: No, I just --I explained to him that you and I had had a conversation. Hope, we -- come on. We just agreed that, you know, this is a great chance for us to move forward.",
        "Hope: I know. I know. But, you know, the four of us confined on a jet together -- don't you think that will be... hard?",
        "Ivy: Well, if he thought it was going to be hard, why did he say yes? Hope, come on. We've talked about this. We need to -- we need to let Liam move on. You have to try to accept that relationship together.",
        "Hope: I know, but you never said anything about taking a trip together. I think that's a little different, and, to be honest, I'm not entirely comfortable with it.",
        "Ivy: Okay. Well, I appreciate your honesty. But we have to find a way to move beyond this. This is exactly what Rick just said.",
        "Hope: No. Rick was talking about work, talking about what's doing best for the line.",
        "Ivy: Hope, you're married.",
        "Hope: I know.",
        "Ivy: You're married to Wyatt. You're expecting his child.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: And I'm -- I'm starting this new relationship with Liam. I mean, this is a very exciting time in all of our lives. We should be able to be happy for each other. And I get it. I get it, okay? I'm not expecting an invite to your baby shower, and I'm sure Liam's not gonna call you both up over for a barbecue. But can't we at least get along on a plane for a few hours?",
        "Hope: You know, it's a big first step.",
        "Ivy: Hope, I really think we can do this.",
        "Hope: Hey, everything that you're saying makes sense.",
        "Ivy: You know, I wasn't... just saying what I thought Rick wanted to hear. I really do think we can get along. Don't you?",
        "Hope: I guess we'll find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Are you miserable yet?",
        "Caroline: Rick obviously wants me to be.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I think that's the point. He wants to make you pay, at home and at the office.",
        "Caroline: Things are okay with you and Katie?",
        "Ridge: She'll be okay.",
        "Caroline: Unlike Rick. I can't believe that he's leaving me for... that gold- digging opportunist.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: Don't let them ruin this for you.",
        "Rick: They won't.",
        "Maya: Seeing Ridge and Caroline bothered you.",
        "Rick: It's my office now. He can't just barge in whenever he wants to.",
        "Maya: Caroline isn't welcome, either.",
        "Rick: I don't want to deal with either one of them, but they work for the company that I run.",
        "Maya: You know, you don't have to stay here and keep watch over them if that's why you're not going to Amsterdam.",
        "Rick: I'm not going because I don't have to go.",
        "Maya: Well, if you wanted to, you could. I could come, too. You could take a little time, reset after everything that's happened.",
        "Rick: I don't need to reset. I just -- I just need to work.",
        "Maya: You would be working. This trip is all about introductions. We're launching Ivy's new line. You could introduce yourself as the new C.E.O. of Forrester -- do some press, take the jet, go to some other countries, visit your mom in Milan. I mean, that -- that's the beauty of having a private jet, right? You can just hop around and --",
        "Rick: I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving L.A. Launching Ivy's jewelry line -- it's super important. Going to Amsterdam with you, seeing it -- that would be amazing. But the most important thing that I could do right now is stay here and stake my claim.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Yep. We're off on another adventure.",
        "Hope: Well, I hate to break this to you, but it's a business trip.",
        "Wyatt: Well, everything with you is an adventure.",
        "Hope: [Laughing] Ohh.",
        "Kyle: Excuse me.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Kyle: I was wondering if you had an ETA for our last passenger.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, no. Rick's not coming. Uh, we're all here.",
        "Kyle: Uh, I removed Mr. Forrester earlier. There's been a last-minute addition to the manifest.",
        "Wyatt: Who?",
        "Hope: Um, I-I was gonna tell you this earlier, but you've been on the phone for a while, so I didn't get a chance --",
        "Liam: Hey. Made it.",
        "Ivy: Hey!",
        "Kyle: Mr. Spencer, good to see you.",
        "Ivy: Finally, you made it!",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Kyle: As soon as they finish loading your luggage, I'll call tower for clearance, all right?",
        "Liam: Cool.",
        "Wyatt: Hey. What are you doing here?",
        "Liam: I'm going to Amsterdam with Ivy. For a second, I thought you didn't tell them.",
        "Ivy: Why would I do that?",
        "Liam: I don't know. Wyatt looks pretty surprised to me.",
        "Ivy: Well, Hope said she was gonna tell him on the way to the jet, but he was on the phone the whole time.",
        "Wyatt: You couldn't have written me a note, done some pantomiming or something?",
        "Hope: What would that have looked like?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. \"Liam is coming on the plane.\" I don't know. Are you okay with this?",
        "Hope: I don't...know. Rick told me that we needed to get along and work together as a team.",
        "Wyatt: Liam is not a part of that. He's on vacation.",
        "Liam: Uh, technically, I'm here to support Ivy -- make sure her jewelry gets the coverage it deserves, so...",
        "Wyatt: No, that's why I'm here. I handle the marketing for the jewelry, and that is not your job, okay? We shouldn't even allow him to be here. Does Rick know that there's a reporter on the plane?",
        "Liam: It's a little late to throw me off now, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Dad hasn't taken you sky diving yet?",
        "Ivy: Okay. You know what? Rick suggested we go to the boutique as soon as we land, so... look, it's been a long day. Why don't we just get some sleep?",
        "Hope: Great idea. Let's go to bed.",
        "Wyatt: Fine.",
        "Hope: Come on, babe.",
        "Ivy: Well, good night.",
        "Hope: Good night.",
        "Liam: See you in the morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I've been looking for you.",
        "Carter: I didn't tell Ridge about the meeting.",
        "Maya: I need your help.",
        "Carter: With what?",
        "Maya: We have to get Rick and Caroline's marriage annulled -- today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Oh, well, thank you. Thank you for the support. It means a lot. All right. Until then.",
        "Caroline: I just need a minute.",
        "Rick: Is that supposed to be funny?",
        "Caroline: Yes.",
        "Rick: It's not.",
        "Caroline: It got me in the room, so...",
        "Rick: What do you want, Caroline?",
        "Caroline: Another chance. Look... I'd settle for an answer to one question. How did we get here?",
        "Rick: I think you can answer that one yourself.",
        "Caroline: No, I know what happened. I know what I did, how much I hurt you, and I can't tell you how sorry I am, but you -- you don't want to hear it, and, see, and -- now, that's what I don't understand. Isn't what we have worth saving? Doesn't it mean anything to you? How can you be so cold?",
        "Rick: We have to work together. I don't have to like it.",
        "Caroline: This is what it's gonna be like now -- the way that you look at me, the disdain in your voice? Having to face it every day is so much worse than not getting to see you.",
        "Rick: If you need to work from home, that could be arranged.",
        "Caroline: No. What I want is my husband back. I know that you're not indifferent. You wouldn't be this upset if you didn't care. I am sorry. I am -- I am so sorry that I messed things up. But I am not the one that walked away. And I could be upset about that, too, you know. I could be furious -- I am furious -- because I made one mistake, just one mistake, and... Maya was right there, ready to pounce, and you -- you let her. So, whatever it is that you have with Maya, I want you to end it, because we are gonna work this out. Come back to our marriage. Please. Let's just forgive each other. I love you. Please come home."
