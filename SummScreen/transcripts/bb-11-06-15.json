        "Wyatt tells Liam that Tommy boy can whine all he wants to but the Spencers are in the building so he better get used to it.

Steffy watches Ivy and Thomas banter back and forth and finally has all she can take and asks to have time alone with her brother. She questions his taste in women, Ivy! She says he has made some really bad decisions regarding women and she does not want to see him make another .all this oozing charm with Ivy, it has to stop .just look what Ivy did to Steffy. Thomas defends Ivy that she was confused and lashed back. Ivy tells Liam and Wyatt that they are exaggerating about Thomas when talking about the Spencers. Wyatt tells her that Thomas is hitting on her and he does not like it. Thomas asks why Steffy thinks he is making bad choices. She tells him that Ivy is his cousin and besides she should be off limits because she is with Wyatt.",
        "Thomas laments that he does not take Wyatt seriously since there is no ring. Steffy tells him Bill owns 12 \u00bd% so as long as he does there will be Spencers here. Yet all Thomas wants to talk about is how bad the Spencers are. He says Ivy is hot but he is not actively pursuing her. It is just innocent fun and flirting and there is no harm in that and he needs her to relax and chill. As they kiss Steffy tells Liam that she likes this working thing and never wants to go back to when they had to sneak away to meet. Liam says he thinks Thomas was out of line. She agrees that he is interested in someone he ought not to be. Ivy can't believe that Wyatt thinks Thomas is hitting on her just because he saved her from the boom light. He thinks Thomas got another guy to creme his car so he would have to leave Ivy alone with him at the Halloween party. She says she does not have to have a light fall on her head to know it is Wyatt that she wants. Ridge and Caroline meet the intern who is going to do the ultrasound. Meanwhile Thomas is in the hospital and looking up the floor for the doctor's office. Caroline is crushed with joy when she sees the baby pix and hears the heartbeat. Thomas walks by the door just as the doctor walks in so he sees Caroline and Ridge and the ultrasound baby on the monitor. Thomas stands there a little too long and Caroline frowns as she spots him."

        "Caroline: How'd I get so lucky, huh, to get a man that's so good?",
        "Ridge: Mnh-mnh. Just a man who loves his wife.",
        "Caroline: I know. Just... knowing everything that you and I...",
        "Ridge: All I know is I get to raise a kid with the most beautiful woman in the world. That's all I know, and that's all I need to know. That's all that anyone needs to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Thomas, thank you so much again. I mean, that light -- I can't stop thinking about what could have happened.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, no. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's pulling women out of the way of falling objects. I am the guy you want around in a meteor shower.",
        "Ivy: Oh, good. I'll remember that.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, snowball fights, too. Got you covered there.",
        "Ivy: Also a very good fact to know because of how much snowfall we have in Los Angeles.",
        "Thomas: Oh, no, no, no, no. Come on. Up in Big Bear. Big Bear, they break out all the time, right? Right, Steff? Snowball fights? Huh?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah. We've had our fair share.",
        "Ivy: All right, well, very good to know. I'll make sure to have you around when there's falling lights, meteor showers, and snow.",
        "Thomas: Good. You got it. Well, now that we got that covered, there's, uh, something else I want to protect you from. Being involved with a Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: \"Has Wyatt already told his father about it?\" I mean, annoying.",
        "Liam: So annoying.",
        "Wyatt: And then all that talk about selling magazines.",
        "Liam: I know. \"You're -- you're still a Spencer. That's -- that's something to consider.\"",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God. Right? Poor, little Tommy Boy. He can whine and stomp his feet all he wants. But the Spencers are in the building, and he better get used to it.",
        "Liam: I mean, I don't think Thomas will ever actually get used to having Spencers around.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but he needs to. He needs to stop undermining us and undermining my relationship.",
        "Liam: Okay, but do you think that's actually what he's doing?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, totally!",
        "Liam: Because he's interested in Ivy?",
        "Wyatt: Or he's just interested in taking her away from me for fun, because that's who Thomas Forrester is -- the entitled, spoiled, little rich kid who thinks that he can just take whatever and whomever he wants.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] You know what this sounds like? Kind of sounds like stories of his dad back in the day.",
        "Wyatt: Exactly. But I'm not letting history repeat itself. No. This little mini Ridge is not getting away with making moves on my girlfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Better be careful, Thomas, because your sister is also with a Spencer, so are you gonna save her when you're done saving me from Wyatt?",
        "Thomas: No, some people are beyond help.",
        "Steffy: [Mocking laugh] That's so funny. So funny. It's not.",
        "Thomas: No, it is, it is. You, on the other hand, you still have a chance of seeing the light.",
        "Ivy: Huh.",
        "Steffy: Ivy, I'm -- I'm sorry. Can I just, um, have a moment alone with my brother?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. See? I told you. She wouldn't like that comment.",
        "Thomas: Oh. What, Steff? It was a joke.",
        "Ivy: Okay, I'm gonna leave you two to rash it out. I will see you later.",
        "Thomas: No, wait. Don't. Don't go. Oh, come on, Steff. You know my sense of humor.",
        "Steffy: It's not about that.",
        "Thomas: Okay.",
        "Steffy: It's about your taste in women. Really? Ivy?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Good. You excited? Me, too.",
        "Dr. Li: Hello, Caroline. Papa came, too, I see.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, Dr. Li, is it okay that I'm here?",
        "Dr. Li: Definitely. Always wonderful to see the fathers-to-be.",
        "Caroline: I know, especially today, because you said that we could potentially hear the heartbeat and see the baby?",
        "Dr. Li: Yes. You're far enough along. Ready for your first ultrasound?",
        "Caroline: Yes.",
        "Ridge: Okay, here we go.",
        "Dr. Li: Blood pressure looks good.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Dr. Li: How is the morning sickness?",
        "Caroline: Uh, it's much better.",
        "Dr. Li: Great. Any other complications I need to know about?",
        "Caroline: Hmm, no.",
        "Dr. Li: Has she been having strange cravings, sending you on midnight runs to the grocery store?",
        "Ridge: Not yet.",
        "Dr. Li: Well, Caroline, you better get on that. You have the hard part of growing his baby. Get him working, too.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Dr. Li: Dads like to go on errands. Makes them feel involved.",
        "Caroline: Oh, I'm very happy to report that he is very involved.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, anything you need, any strange foods, I'm your guy.",
        "Dr. Li: That's what I'm talking about. The husband doing his part. Proud father-to-be.",
        "Ridge: And that's exactly who I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: What -- what is this?",
        "Kristina: It's the chocolate mousse pie recipes that you wanted. You wanted 20 copies, correct?",
        "Pam: But did you even bother centering the recipe on the copier?",
        "Kristina: Well, um, when --",
        "Pam: Look how crooked. And it wouldn't hurt to enlarge the image. I mean, I thought that was kind of obvious.",
        "Kristina: Right.",
        "Pam: I can barely read the measurements.",
        "Kristina: Absolutely.",
        "Pam: Um, the ladies in the baking club don't have the best eyesight, you know?",
        "Kristina: Yeah.",
        "Pam: We're starting at 7:00 tonight, if you'd care to join. Maybe ask a few other interns.",
        "Kristina: Okay.",
        "Pam: And, Kristina, love the sweater.",
        "Kristina: Thank you.",
        "Pam: Maybe try it with pearls next time.",
        "Kristina: I could never look as good as you.",
        "Ivy: Pam! Hey! Have you seen, uh, Wyatt or Liam?",
        "Pam: Oh, yeah. They're both in the office there. The Spencer lounge.",
        "Ivy: Ooh. What is that? Sounds fancy.",
        "Pam: I just don't really understand why Wyatt and Liam aren't working with their father over at Spencer Publications.",
        "Ivy: Ah, yeah. You know what? I heard that their receptionist over there is horrible at baking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You could swagger.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, totally. That's what I'm saying.",
        "Ivy: Hey. Am I interrupting?",
        "Wyatt: Huh?",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Wyatt: No!",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Wyatt: What? No, we're -- no, not at all.",
        "Ivy: The energy feels a little tense in here.",
        "Liam: No, that's -- what -- what that -- we're just decompressing from the meeting.",
        "Ivy: Oh, right. You're talking about Thomas, you mean.",
        "Wyatt: Yes. Yeah. He's been a royal pain in the --",
        "Ivy: Okay, I get it. His comments were a little unnecessary.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, a lot unnecessary.",
        "Ivy: But --",
        "Wyatt: \"But\"? What are you \"butting\"? No \"butting.\"",
        "Ivy: He's a Forrester, Wyatt. This is his family's business.",
        "Wyatt: Are you defending Thomas?",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You're interested in Ivy.",
        "Thomas: Never said that.",
        "Steffy: You don't have to. It's obvious. You were just oozing charm.",
        "Thomas: Wow. Oozing.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Really? Come on. Charm is my natural state. So what if I flirt a little bit? You and I both learned that from Dad.",
        "Steffy: Harmless flirting, fine. But what you did had intention. You like Ivy.",
        "Thomas: So what if I do?",
        "Steffy: After what she did to me?",
        "Thomas: She was confused, Steff. She is grieving the loss of her cousin.",
        "Steffy: Do not get involved with Ivy. Please. For your own good.",
        "Thomas: For my own good?",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas: Really?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Now you sound ridiculous.",
        "Steffy: I'm worried about you, and if that sounds ridiculous, then fine. But you need to hear this, because you don't seem to see --",
        "Thomas: See what, Steff?",
        "Steffy: That you have made some really bad decisions regarding women. Do not make another one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You think Thomas was right in saying that stuff?",
        "Ivy: No, not necessarily, but I think he was giving you two some perspective.",
        "Liam: Spencers aren't allowed at Forrester -- that's Thomas' perspective.",
        "Ivy: Oh, you're exaggerating. Come on.",
        "Liam: Yeah, not really.",
        "Ivy: Look, if you think about what he was trying to say and what he's actually up to --",
        "Wyatt: Oh, no, no, I know exactly what he's up to and what he was trying to say. Am I right, bro?",
        "Ivy: What -- what are you talking about?",
        "Liam: I actually -- I think I have a, um -- I'm gonna let you two talk.",
        "Wyatt: Are you serious?",
        "Liam: Yeah, I got to go.",
        "Wyatt: You're serious right now?",
        "Liam: I'm out.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, what -- what is going on?",
        "Wyatt: Ivy, Thomas is hitting on you. And I don't like it.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: I don't even know what you're talking about.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: How am I making bad choices in women?",
        "Steffy: Really, Thomas?",
        "Thomas: Yes, really.",
        "Steffy: Really?",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: You're going after women who are unavailable. The question is why.",
        "Thomas: And how is Ivy unavailable? And don't even say that it's because she's some unrelated distant cousin. There's no blood relation between us.",
        "Steffy: No! No! Ew! I wasn't even thinking about that! I was talking about your uncanny ability to go after women who are off limits.",
        "Thomas: No, I don't!",
        "Steffy: The intern?",
        "Thomas: Okay, maybe I do.",
        "Steffy: Hope?",
        "Thomas: What was wrong with Hope? She was single.",
        "Steffy: Not emotionally, and you knew that.",
        "Thomas: That --",
        "Steffy: What about Caroline?",
        "Thomas: What about her?",
        "Steffy: She's with Dad.",
        "Thomas: Not at the time that I --",
        "Steffy: And now Ivy is with Wyatt!",
        "Thomas: Yeah. They're dating.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my -- it's more than dating.",
        "Thomas: Is it, though? Really? Is there a ring on the finger?",
        "Steffy: Thomas!",
        "Thomas: What? Until then, I don't take them seriously. I don't take Liam or Wyatt or any of the Spencers seriously. Why are we accommodating them so much, huh? This is Forrester Creations. It doesn't say Spencer on the outside of the building, does it?",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] First off, Liam is my boyfriend.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: Secondly, Bill Spencer owns 12.5%. So like it or not, Spencers have a voice here.",
        "Thomas: Whoop-de-freakin'-do. A whopping 12.5%. They're gonna ride it for all it's worth, and we both know why. It's because they're scared.",
        "Steffy: They're scared?",
        "Thomas: Yes. Being in publishing these days? Come on, Liam and Wyatt would way rather be over here at a successful, established clothing company.",
        "Steffy: Okay, I know what you're doing, all right?",
        "Thomas: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: You're trying to change the subject.",
        "Thomas: What are you talking about?",
        "Steffy: We were talking about Ivy, and all of a sudden, we're talking about how awful the Spencers are.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] Okay. Fine. Want to talk about Ivy?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Great. I think you're getting way ahead of yourself, all right? It's just a little flirting. So what if I like her? But I'm not actively pursuing her. Yeah, I think she's hot. She's got that sexy Aussie accent thing going for her.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Thomas: But it's not like I'm trying --",
        "Pam: Sorry to interrupt, but Dr. Lang called for you, Thomas, to confirm your appointment.",
        "Steffy: What? Are you -- are you sick or something?",
        "Thomas: No. It's just my annual physical.",
        "Steffy: Go. You made your point. I made mine. You can leave.",
        "Thomas: Go ahead. You can confirm it for me, Pam. Thank you.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Thomas: Steff, I know you have your issues with Ivy. But I need you to relax, please. It's just innocent fun. It's a little flirting. There's nothing wrong with that.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Are you nervous?",
        "Caroline: No. I'm excited. Wait, should I be nervous?",
        "Ridge: The gel is -- is not warm.",
        "Caroline: I do hate being cold.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: I-I do think you're gonna survive.",
        "Caroline: Yeah?",
        "Ridge: I think so. You're strong.",
        "Caroline: [Laughs] I am glad that you've -- I'm glad that you've done this before, you know, so you can kind of talk me through everything, you know, and just be with me for the entire process, from the first ultrasound all the way to cutting the umbilical cord. You know, experience matters.",
        "Ridge: No. Not here.",
        "Caroline: Mnh?",
        "Ridge: Mnh-mnh. There's nothing to prepare you, seeing your baby on the monitor for the first time. I can't wait to see your face light up when we see our baby.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: This whole \"working with you\" thing? I'm liking it.",
        "Liam: I know, right? Remember when I had to used to drive across town just to be able to kiss you during the work day?",
        "Steffy: Those are the dark days.",
        "Liam: Never going back.",
        "Steffy: No. I suppose we should get back to work.",
        "Liam: Uh, fine.",
        "Steffy: Hey, did you get that e-mail from Rick? I mean, he has a point. Maybe we should schedule a meeting.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. Actually, speaking of meetings, I want to go on record about something.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Liam: [Clears throat] Meeting earlier, with your brother...",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah, yeah. Thomas said a lot.",
        "Liam: He was out of line. You don't think so?",
        "Steffy: No, no, I definitely do. More than you know.",
        "Liam: What does that mean?",
        "Steffy: There's somebody he's interested in. Somebody he shouldn't be. Ivy.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You really think he was hitting on me?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, yeah! Obviously!",
        "Ivy: Does this have something to do with Halloween and the light falling on my head? Because from where I stood, it looked like he was saving my life and not trying to make moves.",
        "Wyatt: I know, and I'm totally grateful for that, even if there is a part of me that's pissed off that I wasn't the one pulling you out of harm's way.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, you would have saved me, too, if you were there.",
        "Wyatt: I know, but I wasn't! And then he was yukking it up with James and the shaving cream on my car and all the -- oh, my God.",
        "Ivy: Wh-what?",
        "Wyatt: He put James up to it. Pranking me.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: He's the one who did it! He wanted me out of there! He wanted you alone with him! He was making all those comments all night, complimenting you, Ivy, and then taking shots at me.",
        "Ivy: Well, it's just -- that's very funny, 'cause I didn't notice that at all.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I did, okay? And I shouldn't have gone. I shouldn't have cared so much about my car, and I just... I-I want to be the one who's there for you.",
        "Ivy: You are, okay? I already know that, and I don't need a light to fall on my head to tell me that. Okay?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Ugh!",
        "Wyatt: What?",

        "Ridge: It's funny to you? This is funny. Here we go.",
        "Caroline: [Squeals]",
        "Geri: Mrs. Forrester?",
        "Caroline: Yes.",
        "Geri: Hi. I'm Geri. I'll be doing your ultrasound.",
        "Caroline: Oh, so nice to meet you.",
        "Geri: Dad, I assume?",
        "Ridge: I'm Ridge, yes. Hey. How are you?",
        "Geri: You ready for this, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Sure, I'm ready.",
        "Geri: Another patient of Dr. Li's was admitted to labor, so she's gonna check in here after she's finished checking in on her.",
        "Caroline: Oh, okay. Well, I mean, I don't -- I don't want to take her away from --",
        "Geri: [Chuckles] You're not. There are hours to go.",
        "Caroline: There's h-hours?",
        "Geri: There's a reason it's called labor.",
        "Ridge: But I will hold your hand for all those hours 'cause I hear it helps, right? Doesn't it? Yeah.",
        "Caroline: Okay, well, as long as you're prepared for a death grip.",
        "Geri: Chances are you'll be cursing him out, too, that he's the one who did this to you.",
        "Ridge: You can squeeze all you want. I'm here.",
        "Geri: And we are ready. Now, if you'll lift your shirt just a bit. This gel might be a little cold.",
        "Caroline: Okay. [Winces] So cold.",
        "Geri: And... if you'll take a look right over here...",
