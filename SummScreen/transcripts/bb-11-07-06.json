        "Nick: That's it. Nice and easy. Good. Are you sure it's not too soon for her to be on her feet?",
        "Dr. Hillman: Your mother is a very determined woman.",
        "Nick: I know.",
        "Dr. Hillman: Well, we've seen marked improvements, not just with the walking, but her speaking has improved immensely.",
        "Nick: Are you all right?",
        "Jackie: I'm dizzy.",
        "Dr. Hillman: All right, let's get her back in bed. That's good. That's it. Just a little slow. Easy. Get her, grab her feet.",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Dr. Hillman: I'll have the nurse bring something, okay? Okay.",
        "Nick: Hey, Doc, she's going to be all right?",
        "Dr. Hillman: As I told you, these things are gonna take some time. The headaches, the chronic pain, the dizziness, these -- these things may stay with her.",
        "Nick: There you are.",
        "Jackie: Nicky -- no. Your wedding ring --",
        "Nick: Brooke ended the marriage. She needs time to herself. To be with her children.",
        "Jackie: Stephanie -- they've won.",
        "Nick: Shh -- don't worry about that. My concern is you. And my concern is what Stephanie did to you. She's going to fall, mother. She's just not gonna fall quite the same way you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I didn't know if you'd be coming in today. Especially after all the excitement last night.",
        "Brooke: With Nick and your mother, you mean --",
        "Ridge: Who knew the guy would wig out like that, huh?",
        "Brooke: You don't think he had reason to?",
        "Ridge: I think we should talk about you and me instead. And how amazing this is.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: It feels like we're coming full circle here, Logan. You back here where it all started for us. Where we actually defined ourselves, really. It's kind of like we're picking up where we left off.",
        "Brooke: I thought you weren't going to pressure me.",
        "Ridge: I'm not. I'm not. I'm just telling you I'm glad to have you back where you belong -- at Forrester and in my arms.",
        "Stephanie: Well, obviously Forrester Creations is working its magic again. Only this time, nothing's gonna get in the way of your happiness, is it? Especially, your lunatic husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Harry?",
        "Harry: If I'm overstepping by coming here, just say so, and I'll --",
        "Taylor: No, no, not at all. It's not like I have to worry about getting ready when a visitor comes over. It's just when the guard told me that I had a visitor --",
        "Harry: You thought it might have been phoebe. I know.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, she is waiting outside? Is she coming?",
        "Harry: Actually -- actually, no. But she's the reason I'm here.",
        "Taylor: Is everything okay? Is there a problem?",
        "Harry: Yeah, there's a problem. Shane McGrath. The guy is -- he's bad news and Phoebe thinks she can handle him, but I'm worried because she can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: There you are. You know, I've been searching everywhere for you. You've been here the entire time? Yeah. You know, I think maybe you left me hanging a little bit earlier about the dinner date we are gonna have tomorrow night. I mean, is that still gonna happen? Are we gonna do that? Yes, no?",
        "Phoebe: I don't know. I might have plans.",
        "Shane: Wait, wait, wait. You might have plans? Wow, that sounds like maybe I'm getting the old brush off. I wouldn't be getting the brush off, would I? Being that your mother's trial has just been moved up and all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: I've always been wary about Shane. I mean, I knew it was strange the way he came into our lives.",
        "Harry: He's valuable to your defense, which is why he's still hanging around. But the problem is, McGrath's using that to get your daughter.",
        "Taylor: Get to her how? What are you telling me, he's interested in her -- physically, romantically?",
        "Harry: Yes, only Phoebe's not interested in him. But she's so afraid of alienating the guy, she can't tell him to take a hike --",
        "Taylor: I know, I know what you're telling me. She's worried. She worried that she'll blow the case. Oh, god.",
        "Harry: So far, she's handled him okay. But with a guy like that -- I just think Phoebe's getting in over her head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: No one's giving you the brush off, Shane.",
        "Shane: Good. Good. Because I would hate to think that someone was doing that. Hey, hey, let me get that for you. Wait, wait, I got it. I got it. I got it. Ow! Man!",
        "Phoebe: What's wrong? What happened?",
        "Shane: I just -- I just twisted my back. Can you help me out here? Right here. Let me see your hand. Can you, right here? Just rub it right there. Right there. Just, good. Good. Just go a little lower. Little lower. Right there. Ah, that's the magic touch, right there.",
        "Phoebe: Shane, stop. I need to do my homework. What are you -- stop it, Shane!",
        "Shane: Did I mention I was the captain of my high school wrestling team?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You couldn't resist, could you?",
        "Stephanie: It was your husband who broke into my home and attacked me.",
        "Ridge: Look, we all know what a hothead Nick is. I think if we just let him cool down for a while, this will blow over.",
        "Brooke: I wish that were true. But nick has turned to storm for some legal advice. And my sister will testify against you, Stephanie, so, you could be facing a civil suit charge and criminal charges.",
        "Stephanie: Well, this is preposterous. It was an accident.",
        "Eric: It doesn't matter how preposterous it was, we have to be prepared as well. That's why I've asked Eli Donovan to join us. I'm hoping he'll help us handle this whole thing before it gets any worse.",
        "Brooke: It's gonna get worse. This is tearing Nick apart, seeing his mother in pain like that. Knowing that it could be for the rest of her life. Nick is not gonna let go, Stephanie. He's not gonna give up on this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: The medication should help.",
        "Nick: Thank you.",
        "Jackie: Thank you.",
        "Storm: Is this a bad time?",
        "Nick: Hey, Stephen. You know, later might be better.",
        "Storm: Yeah, okay, say no more. Just let me know when you've made any decisions, okay?",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Jackie: Decisions?",
        "Nick: You know, Stephen, I guess now is a good time. Mother, this is Stephen Logan Jr., Brooke's brother. He's also an attorney from San Francisco.",
        "Storm: Hi, Jackie. I've heard a lot of wonderful things about you. From my sisters and from Nick, of course. I'm just sorry we had to meet under these circumstances. Well -- just so you know, Donna's prepared to go to the D.A. If you decide to pursue criminal charges. And I'm prepared to handle the civil suit. If that's what you want.",
        "Nick: What I want is for Stephanie Forrester to suffer the same way that my mother's suffering. I want to hit her where it hurts the most.",
        "Jackie: Forrester --",
        "Nick: What did you say, mother?",
        "Jackie: Get -- the company. Get Forrester Creations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: You're claiming self-defense, then.",
        "Stephanie: Wait, Eli, I'm not claiming anything. I want to say this, and make it very clear, there was no malice aforethought. It was not my intention for her to go over that banister.",
        "Eli: But the point is, will a judge or jury believe that? Especially if Donna Logan testifies to seeing you shove Ms. Marone.",
        "Eric: That can't happen. Jackie was injured in our home and my wife is at least partially responsible. Now, if we can come up with some kind of financial settlement here --",
        "Stephanie: Oh -- what -- you're gonna give up as usual, aren't you? Without a fight? Why can't we at least let her sue first.",
        "Eric: I'm trying to protect both of you.",
        "Stephanie: No, you're not. No, you're not. You're willing to let me look as though I'm guilty from something that I haven't done because you're still vulnerable to that little English -- I don't know why. Or maybe I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Forrester Creations is Stephanie's most prized possession. That and that ken doll son of hers. That's why she wants Brooke back in the fold. That's why she wants her back in the family, so the company can be all in the family --",
        "Storm: Wait a second, are you saying that's the only reason Stephanie wants my sister to be with Ridge?",
        "Nick: She hates Brooke. She may say differently now, but it's all about the company.",
        "Jackie: Leverage, Nicky. Use it to get Brooke away from them -- forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Shane, stop it! Stop it!",
        "Shane: Hey, hey, hey --",
        "Phoebe: You're hurting me, Shane.",
        "Shane: Wait, wait, I'm sorry -- hey. I would never hurt you. All right, I'm serious about that. I'm not kidding. Are you okay?",
        "Phoebe: Obviously you are. Your back doesn't hurt?",
        "Shane: Phoebe, all I said was, you got the magic touch. That's it.",
        "Phoebe: Look, I need to make something clear to you. I'm just -- I'm afraid you'll take it the wrong way. And I don't want that.",
        "Shane: You know something? You smell good. Have I ever tell you that? I love the way you smell.",
        "Phoebe: If you can't control yourself, you should leave.",
        "Shane: Leave? What, LA? Is that what you want? I'm the key witness in your mother's trial. Is that what you want?",
        "Phoebe: No, no, no. I meant, leave, go like, inside, leave. Besides, I know you'll protect my mom, I mean, tell everyone that it was an accident. You're a decent guy.",
        "Shane: You are a beautiful woman. You're so pure, innocent. You're so sweet. How can I not to be attracted to you? Come on. All I wanted to do was to show you what it's like to be in a real adult relationship.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Well, if that's what you really want, I'll draft a settlement offer, and have it to you by the end of the day. But, given ms. Marone's son's behavior last night, Stephanie, you have a cause of action against him, if you choose to pursue it.",
        "Nick: I'd like to see her try.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, hello, Nick. Did you think you'd come by today and try to finish what you started last night?",
        "Nick: No, then I'd be stooping to your level and that's just not gonna happen. Not when I believe there's another way to get justice for you robbing my mother of the life she may never have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harry: I'm glad phoebe's dad moved back into the house. But he can't be there 24/7. And Hector -- look, I'm not trying to freak you out. Phoebe is a smart girl. And she's not gonna anything she doesn't want to do. But like I said, the trial is so close, she can't tell Shane to get lost either. Of course, as soon as he testifies --",
        "Taylor: There's no reason for him to be in the house anyway. And he won't be, soon enough. You know, if you really think Phoebe might be danger, you really have to tell me. Because I want to cancel this whole thing.",
        "Harry: No, don't worry. I'll keep a close eye on phoebe.",
        "Taylor: Okay, will you promise to come back and tell me if anything is wrong?",
        "Harry: You can count on me. Just don't worry, McGrath is not gonna pull anything. Not while I'm around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Listen, Phoebe, I thought there was something going on here between us. There was something, you know, special happening here.",
        "Phoebe: I'm a teenager, Shane. I'm not looking to get in a relationship like that.",
        "Shane: Like what? You mean, something sexual? Is that what you're talking about?",
        "Phoebe: Look, when I sleep with a guy, first of all, I'm gonna be in love with him.",
        "Shane: Okay, why don't you give me a chance here, give me half a chance. You'll fall in love with me, Phoebe. I promise you. Maybe you've already done that. Maybe it's already happened. Maybe it happened the first time we met.",
        "Phoebe: Shane, please --",
        "Shane: Okay, okay. All right, listen, I don't want you walking around here and feeling all weird about me. Okay, so if you just want to hang out, we'll just hang out. That's fine. There's no pressure. On one condition, okay? That you have to go to dinner with me tomorrow night. Because I made all these special arrangements and I can't cancel that, okay? Listen, I just want to have a little more fun before I have to go get on the stand and get grilled by the lady prosecutor. There's nothing wrong with having a little innocent fun.",
        "Phoebe: Dinner's -- dinner's good. Dinner's on.",
        "Shane: Okay, yes. Yes.",
        "Phoebe: I have to finish my homework.",
        "Shane: Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Here. All right, bye.",
        "Phoebe: If I don't play along, he might run. I need his testimony for mom's trial. After that, even though he's kind of -- I can't. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I think we should all sit down and discuss this ole thing calmly and rationally.",
        "Nick: You make it sound like it's a business negotiation, Eric. Like you can, what, throw money at this and it's going to go away? There's no amount of money that's gonna fix this.",
        "Eli: Which the Forresters realize, of course. But if we want --",
        "Nick: Who the hell are you anyway? One of those ambulance chaser of this family pays a lot of money to --",
        "Ridge: All right. Obviously you're not willing to work with us on this. Which isn't really a big surprise since Brooke's warned us you were considering legal action.",
        "Stephanie: I guess that explains why there's yet another Logan here.",
        "Brooke: Look, it wasn't as much as a warning as it was an effort to stop a lot of people from getting hurt. Now, you have every right to feel the way that you do. But to put Stephanie behind bars is not gonna change what happened to your mother.",
        "Ridge: Or help with her recovery in any way.",
        "Nick: Well, you're always stuck in the middle again. I'm starting to think you like it that way.",
        "Ridge: She's not in the middle of anything, Nick --",
        "Eric: Let's not get off track here. Jackie's been injured. I'm anxious to make amends.",
        "Nick: Are you?",
        "Eric: Yes. And I'm prepared to be generous.",
        "Nick: I told you money is not gonna to make this go away.",
        "Ridge: Then what will?",
        "Nick: I want Forrester Creations.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Eric: You're kidding?",
        "Stephanie: You are delusional.",
        "Nick: Well, then, let's get real. I will drag your name through the mud. With a criminal suit, and then a civil suit. Everyone in this business will know exactly what you did. So, you got two choices. You give me Forrester Creations or you go to jail. What's it gonna be, Stephanie?"
