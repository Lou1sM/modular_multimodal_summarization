{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Hope, Wyatt, Ivy and Liam on the jet wake to small talk of how their sleep went and how exciting it is going to Amsterdam. Wyatt gets a text from his mom. He tells Ivy that his mom was good at her designs but Ivy's are definitely holding up. They have a smashing photo shoot on the streets which will be romantic and later in the studio. While Wyatt shows Liam the itinerary, Ivy asks Hope how she is feeling and she doesn't want this to remind her of Paris, no drama or angst. Hope says of course not; she is completely focused on this. Caroline confides in Carter that Rick did not come home again last night. He is shacking up with Maya and she has her money hungry claws in him and there is not much Caroline can do about it. Carter asks Maya what does she want to know. He tells her the lady has her rights and in California she could get half of what Rick has. Maya doesn't think this is a laughing matter, he can't let that happen. Carter says it won't happen as Caroline wants nothing; she does not want the divorce. Maya says he better make it happen. She wants that annulment today. She does not want him to fight her on this. She will be the future Mrs. Rick Forrester. Rick is in a lot of pain and he needs to be free of Caroline. He tells her she is the one in pain and it scares her to death.", "Quinn shows Deacon the pix of the ultrasound. He's afraid she is going to go running off to Amsterdam until he tells her that Liam is along for the ride too. Rick tells Caroline that Maya has his best interest at heart and did not stab him in the back like she did. Quinn tells Deacon this is perfect. Liam is with Ivy and this is exactly what Hope needs to see. Wyatt can take action now and make sure that Liam moves on with Ivy. The four arrive at the Square and are greeted by Lars who shows them around to all the streets, canals and bridges. Quinn calls and tells Wyatt that the last string between Hope and Liam are right there and he needs to make sure Hope cuts them. Caroline says Maya is just using Rick and he ought to be smart enough to know that. Caroline professes that she loves Rick and they can get past this. Wyatt talks to Lars and finds out he has a boat on the canal and wonders if he might use it as sort of a Love Boat for Ivy and Liam."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Ivy: Here.", "Liam: Thank you.", "Wyatt: Goedemorgen. That's \"good morning\" in Dutch.", "Ivy: Hmm. Well, good morning, mate. That's \"good morning\" in Australian. How'd you guys sleep?", "Wyatt: Uh, well, the three of us slept comfy. What about you two?", "Ivy: Yeah, it was like sleeping on a cloud.", "Wyatt: Well, good. Then we're all geluk. That's --", "Liam: \"Happiness\" in Dutch. We know. Thank you.", "Ivy: Ja, ja.", "Liam: Ja.", "Wyatt: That's funny. I'm learning Dutch, thank you very much.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: If we're all done impressing each other with our Dutch, uh, can we talk about the work in Amsterdam?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Right, Amsterdam. Just the four of us. A bonding experience with no interference.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Mm.", "Deacon: How do you manage to do that?", "Quinn: Do what?", "Deacon: Sneak out of bed without me noticing.", "Quinn: I have a very busy day ahead.", "Deacon: Yeah. What do you say we get it started right?", "Quinn: [Chuckles] We did that at midnight, if you recall.", "Deacon: Oh, honey, trust me. I recall.", "Quinn: Well, then let the memory suffice.", "Deacon: All right, so what do you got on your plate today, huh? A little grand theft, a little larceny?", "Quinn: Ever been to Amsterdam?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: The permits are finalized. I've always wanted to go to Amsterdam. It's gonna be a cool trip. [Chuckles] Are you okay?", "Caroline: Yeah, sorry.", "Carter: Any contact with Rick?", "Caroline: I talked to him yesterday.", "Carter: Well, that's a start.", "Caroline: Or an end. He didn't come home again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Yeah, yeah, just give me a call as soon as they hit the ground, which, now that I think of it, should be sooner than later. Oh, no, the itinerary's all set. They'll be shooting in town -- some in studio. Right. Uh, thanks, diederik. We'll talk soon. All right, bye.", "Maya: Mm, early morning.", "Rick: Yeah. Full plate.", "Maya: Yeah, C.E.O.-Size.", "Rick: [Chuckles] Yeah, I guess that's how it's gonna be from now on.", "Maya: Not if I have a say. It's Caroline. You're still thinking of her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: He's shacking up with Maya.", "Carter: She turned your world upside down, didn't she?", "Caroline: I played my part. But you're supposed to...learn from your mistakes, aren't you? I mean, that's what I keep telling Rick.", "Carter: She exploited that mistake and used it to her advantage.", "Caroline: I played right into her gold-digging hands. And now she's got her claws into Rick. What do I do, carter?", "Carter: I don't know. [Chuckles] I don't expect her to let go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Caroline talked to you, didn't she?", "Rick: Yesterday.", "Maya: And she told you how much she wanted you and how much your marriage meant to her.", "Rick: [Sighs] It meant a lot to both of us.", "Maya: No. No, Rick, only to you... because you are loyal and true, and that isn't Caroline.", "Rick: She wants us to try to work through this.", "Maya: Work through what? Her infidelity? Her adultery?", "Rick: I don't think that it went that far.", "Maya: It would have if I hadn't called her out. Rick, you're the C.E.O. Now. You have to make the tough decisions. Do you want a woman who you can't trust or someone who supports you...who loves you? You can't go back, Rick. So make it official. End this marriage.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: Amsterdam?", "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Hope and Wyatt are on their way there right now.", "Deacon: [Sighs] Yeah, she told me.", "Quinn: You spoke to your daughter?", "Deacon: Briefly.", "Quinn: And...?", "Deacon: Your name didn't come up. You're not thinking about flying over there, right?", "Quinn: Tempted.", "Deacon: I'm sure they'll be thrilled with that.", "Quinn: No, but I don't really have to go over there when I have this...to fawn over. Say hello to your grandchild.", "Deacon: So, you really crashed the ultrasound?", "Quinn: Yes. I was dressed as a nurse.", "Deacon: Hang on a second. Wait, like, white stockings, high heels.", "Quinn: In scrubs. Relax. I got busted, though...by Hope. She was really angry. Well, come on. There was no way I was gonna miss my granddaughter's coming-out party.", "Deacon: So, you're sure it's a girl?", "Quinn: No, it's too soon to tell, but, yeah, I know. I know. I mean, maybe. [Chuckles] But I spoke to Wyatt afterwards.", "Deacon: Yeah? You think you got through to him?", "Quinn: I hope so. He realizes that Hope can't keep me away from my grandchild.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: So, Ivy, um, you're probably going to be getting a lot of attention while we're there.", "Ivy: Well, it -- I mean, it's your line, Hope.", "Hope: No, I know, but you should just be prepared because it is your jewelry that we're featuring. What's up?", "Wyatt: Hmm? Nothing. Uh, just a text from my mom.", "Hope: What does she want?", "Wyatt: The usual.", "Hope: [Sighs] Did you tell her no?", "Wyatt: Do you even think this is realistic?", "Hope: Yeah, I do. She's not allowed anywhere near us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Freaking hope not.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Did you talk some sense into her?", "Carter: Who?", "Maya: Blondie. I just saw her leaving.", "Carter: You really messed her up.", "Maya: She messed herself up.", "Carter: What do you want, Maya?", "Maya: I want to know. Come on. Spill it. What'd you two talk about in here?", "Carter: Her marriage.", "Maya: What does she want?", "Carter: Want?", "Maya: In terms of a settlement.", "Carter: Well, in California, she can get half of everything Rick owns.", "Maya: You can't let her do that.", "Carter: May not have much of a say in it. Lady has her rights.", "Maya: That's not gonna happen.", "Carter: How would it look if your married boyfriend lost half of his net worth, maybe even half of Forrester creations?", "Maya: You think this is funny?", "Carter: I'm not laughing. Does it look like I'm laughing? Well, yeah, I guess I am laughing.", "Maya: Carter!", "Carter: Relax. She doesn't want anything.", "Maya: She doesn't?", "Carter: No, because she doesn't want a divorce. The word never came up.", "Maya: Well, it better come up. I told you I want their marriage annulled today, and I mean it, carter.", "Maya: This belongs to you. Rick doesn't want it anymore.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: You know, I should send a copy of this to Liam -- remind him to stay away from Hope.", "Deacon: [Sighs]", "Quinn: Hmm? Oh, come on. Don't ruin my fun. You know I like tweaking the little twerp.", "Deacon: No, it's not that.", "Quinn: Then what?", "Deacon: You haven't heard.", "Quinn: Heard what?", "Deacon: So, Hope's trip to Amsterdam -- it's for the launch of Ivy Forrester's new line, right? She's going, too.", "Quinn: That little thief who stole my job? Oh, lovely.", "Deacon: Yeah, well, she's, uh, bringing a friend.", "Quinn: Who's she -- no.", "Deacon: [Chuckles] Yeah, she's bringing Liam. Can you imagine? The four of them all together on a plane right now, flying together over to Amsterdam.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: So, Eva arranged our contact in Amsterdam.", "Ivy: Wait, who is Eva?", "Hope: She's our international publicist for Forrester.", "Wyatt: Yeah, she's the one who coordinated the, uh, paris photo shoot. So, Lars will be our local liaison. There's been a change. We'll meet him at dam square after we land. That's where we'll do the photo shoot. But the close-ups of the jewelry won't be done until after. We'll shoot them in the studio. So, this location is about glamour and beauty and capturing the Hope for the Future line.", "Liam: I've actually been getting texts from the office. This photo shoot is already creating a buzz.", "Wyatt: Well, wait till we unveil the Hope for the Future diamond at the boutique. It's an excellent tie-in for your line, Ivy. My mom's good, but your designs are holding their own.", "Ivy: Thank you.", "[Intercom beeps]", "Wyatt: Yeah? Okay, thanks. We'll be landing shortly.", "Ivy: Well, I'm getting pretty excited about Amsterdam.", "Wyatt: I know. I am very excited for this shoot, too. Let's make this better than paris, huh?", "Liam: Huh.", "Ivy: Hmm.", "Liam: Uh, actually, Wyatt, do you have a shooting schedule?", "Wyatt: Uh, a tentative one.", "Liam: Yeah?", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Hey, uh, are you okay?", "Hope: Yeah. Why?", "Ivy: You know, just the mention of paris. Look, I just -- I really want us just to all get along on this trip.", "Hope: I know.", "Ivy: Yeah, no jealousy, no drama, no nothing.", "Hope: I know. We have a lot of work to do, and that is my main focus.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carter: An annulment?", "Maya: You're an attorney. Get it done.", "Carter: A corporate attorney.", "Maya: I don't care. I want this marriage over today.", "Carter: It's not like canceling a hair appointment, Maya.", "Maya: I wouldn't fight me on this.", "Carter: Is that a threat?", "Maya: From the future Mrs. Rick Forrester.", "Carter: We're getting full of ourself these days, huh?", "Maya: Rick depends on me to get things done.", "Carter: Oh, well, you did him in. There's no question about that.", "Maya: You know what? Rick's in a lot of pain, carter, and he needs to be free of Caroline.", "Carter: No. You need him to be free of Caroline. Rick still loves her, and that scares you to death, doesn't it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: I put some files on your desk.", "Rick: You and Ridge at it again? [Sighs] I'm sorry. I won't bring him up.", "Caroline: Thank you.", "Rick: But that's what it's come down to, Caroline. Every time I see you, I see him.", "Caroline: Well, that's why I was just trying to sneak in and sneak out. I don't want to cause you any more grief.", "Rick: Thank you. I appreciate that.", "Caroline: You spent another night with Maya.", "Rick: She's helping me cope.", "Caroline: I'm sure she's loving that.", "Rick: Thanks to Maya, I'm up to speed. She may be a little superficial.", "Caroline: You think?", "Rick: But she has my best interest at heart.", "Caroline: No, Maya has Maya's best interest at heart.", "Rick: Well, at least I can trust her. At least she didn't stab me in the back...the way that you did.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Liam is with Ivy? That is perfect. That's exactly what Hope needs to see.", "Deacon: You're not thinking about flying over there, right?", "Quinn: What? To push Ivy into a canal? No, don't be silly.", "Deacon: No, of course not.", "Quinn: Oh, no, but -- but Wyatt, on the other hand -- Wyatt -- he needs to take some action.", "Deacon: Um, what kind of action are we talking about here?", "Quinn: Anything. Anything to make sure Liam moves on with Ivy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Mid-tempo pop music plays] Ooh yeah ah, yeah ooh", "[Singing in native language]", "[Bell clangs] Yeah ah", "[Continues singing]", "[Music stops]", "Wyatt: Lars!", "Lars: Wyatt, well, finally, we meet!", "Wyatt: I know, after all the video chats, right?", "Lars: Yeah.", "Wyatt: This is my wife, Hope.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Hi. Nice to meet you. Your voice has been in our living room for so long.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lars: My pleasure. [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: That is my brother, Liam. He's the vice president at Spencer publications. And Ivy Forrester.", "Ivy: Hallo, leuk je te ontmoeten.", "Lars: [Speaks Dutch] Well, it's very impressive, ms. Forrester. Nice meeting all of you. Welcome to Amsterdam.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Lars: You're standing at the heart of our city, dam square. Or you can call it de dam.", "Ivy: It is -- it's so beautiful.", "Liam: This square -- this used to be a dam, right?", "Lars: Well, someone's done their homework. [Chuckles] Yeah, around 1280, this was first a dam on the amstel river.", "Liam: Oh, which is why the city is called Amsterdam.", "Lars: Correct.", "Liam: Got it.", "Wyatt: Okay, so this is your thought for the photo shoot, then?", "Lars: Lots of people, activity, beautiful architecture that you will only find here in Amsterdam. So, let me show you around.", "Ivy: Yeah.", "Lars: All right.", "Liam: Shall we?", "Lars: Well, and there it is, guys -- the amstel river.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: Oh.", "Wyatt: Oh, sweet.", "Hope: Oh, I love it. And I totally get it now. It is the Venice of the north.", "Wyatt: Yeah, and there's a lot of bikes around.", "Hope: Oh, my gosh.", "Lars: Do you know there are more bikes in Amsterdam than people?", "Wyatt: What?", "Hope: Are you serious?", "Lars: Amsterdam has more than 100 kilometers of canals and about 90 islands linked by about 1,200 bridges.", "Wyatt: Oh, that's a lot of bridges.", "Lars: Yeah.", "Ivy: Yeah, and that's the last thing we need -- more bridges.", "[Cell phone rings]", "Wyatt: Um...I'm just gonna...", "Hope: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Hi, honey. How's it going?", "Wyatt: Well, we just got here. I'm kind of busy.", "Quinn: Yeah, uh, I heard about Liam.", "Wyatt: Yeah, he's tagging along.", "Quinn: Is Hope okay with that?", "Wyatt: Not really.", "Quinn: So then you need to do something about it.", "Wyatt: That's easy for you to say.", "Quinn: I'm serious. Wyatt, take some action. Make sure that Liam hooks up with Ivy and leaves you and Hope alone.", "Wyatt: What am I supposed to do, huh?", "Quinn: Do I need to come over there and show you?", "Wyatt: No, no. I'm fine. Trust me.", "Quinn: The last string between Hope and Liam needs to be cut. Do it right there in Amsterdam. Baby, don't be afraid to make some waves.", "Wyatt: Mom, I got to go, okay? Let me -- I'll talk to you later.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Liam, how romantic would this be?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Oh, yeah. Beautiful boat.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Make some waves?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Caroline: Haven't we hurt each other enough? [Voice breaking] I'm sorry for what I did. I am deeply, sincerely sorry. But can't we just go on? Can't we just chalk it up to a few bad days?", "Rick: Just that simple, huh?", "Caroline: No, it is not that simple. We both have to learn to forgive -- me and Ridge kissing and you and Maya -- she -- she's just using you. She's an opportunist, and you are smart enough to see that. But I love you. I love you, Rick. I know that you love me, too. Hey, Lars.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lars: Hey, man. [Chuckles]", "Wyatt: Do you know that guy?", "Lars: Well, that is the captain of my boat.", "Wyatt: That's your boat?", "Lars: Yeah.", "Wyatt: Whoa, that's...", "Lars: It's from the 1930s, and I've worked on it for, like, a couple of years. It's my pride. It's my joy.", "Wyatt: Wow.", "Lars: Do you like it for you and Hope?", "Wyatt: No, actually, I want it for them. I want to do a nice romantic evening with Liam and Ivy. You know, some champagne, some hors d'oeuvres -- just really nice.", "Lars: Like a love boat.", "Wyatt: Exactly.", "Lars: Cool.", "Wyatt: The love boat."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nblDRCRKzvo"}
