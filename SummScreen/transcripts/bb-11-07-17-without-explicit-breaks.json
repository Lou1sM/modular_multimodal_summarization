    "Recap": [
        "They all stand around and Grams tells Justin that if her granddaughter does not come out of there in one piece, so help him. What kind of man is Dollar Bill? As Steffy and Bill make their way around the remains of the building that is left standing it starts shaking. They keep looking and soon Steffy spots what she thinks is a body .it turns out to be a mannequin. Sally and Liam are still pinned under the rubble and he cautions her not to move lest they bring down more on top of them. Surely his father knows they are in the building now and will send rescuers. She says okay but she wants him to know she meant everything she said \u0096 she loves him. Katie brings Wyatt the latest on the internet about the building and Wyatt instructs more on the phone to give him any information they can. At least the rescuers are there and that is a start. Justin calls him and says now Bill and Steffy are also in the building. Wyatt says he has to come down there. Justin says no, that won't do any good. He is more effective being where he is as the media will be calling and he can handle it there. Grams tells Saul and Darlita that Sally is going to come out. She will not listen to Saul's talk that they will pay for this mistake with their lives. Finally Liam and Sally hear Bill and Steffy calling them and direct him in their direction. Bill finds them and tells Liam to be calm; they will get them out. More beams start falling.",
        "Bill calls back to the main crew and says he found them. The man is there to tell the group even though family they must move out of the way. He hears the call from Bill and Grams says just get them out alive. Katie tells Wyatt they are not going to think like that; they will all get out alive. Justin calls and gives Wyatt the good news. They are still trying to get them all out but they are trapped for now. Liam tells Bill to get Sally first. Bill and Steffy take a long plank to make leverage so a beam will move and allow her out. Then it's Liam's turn but his is a little more tricky without risking more falling on him. Wyatt tells Katie the rest may have to get out. The rubble will only hold up for so long. The crew tells Grams that too. It's only a matter of time before it all comes down with the weight. Bill tries again and makes a little headway pulling Liam free just in time for another beam to come crashing down. With a lot of fuss being made Liam looks toward Sally and locks eyes with hers."
