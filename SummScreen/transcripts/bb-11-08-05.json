        "[Eric groans]",
        "Thorne: Oh, my God, Dad, are you okay?",
        "Brooke: Eric!",
        "Ridge: Oh for God sakes', Mother, are you out of your mind?",
        "Brooke: How could you do this to him?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, what are you worried about? You don't even want to have sex with him.",
        "Eric: Look, I'm okay...I'm okay.",
        "Massimo: All right, come on, take it easy, he just had the wind knocked out of him.",
        "Brooke: You are sick!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you don't think I have a right to be angry?",
        "Taylor: You didn't need to resort to violence, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: On the contrary, Taylor. I think this is a reaction that has been long overdue.",
        "Rick: You kneed him in the groin.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, well if he'd made one single decision with his brain, I would've slapped him in the head.",
        "Ridge: Oh Mother, stop it!",
        "Darla: Everybody just needs to calm down.",
        "Rick: Stephanie should get the hell out of here.",
        "Stephanie: Oh really? I think it's my office now, Rick.",
        "Brooke: It's all about power and territory with you.",
        "Stephanie: It's all about what I deserve.",
        "Ridge: You think Dad deserved this? He spent his whole life making Forrester what it is today. And you want to oust him on a technicality.",
        "Stephanie: My father set this company up in a trust, when he gave us the money to start this company. I am the sole beneficiary of the trust.",
        "Ridge: John Douglas did not make Forrester a success, that man did.",
        "Stephanie: You're right, and I agreed with everything that Eric did, until she came along.",
        "Brooke: Again, your vendetta against me!",
        "Ridge: Taylor, you can't condone this. Tell me you --",
        "Stephanie: I am going to take this company back to its roots. And anybody that cannot get on board with that can leave. Thorne, we have a lot of work to do. We're going to start with the ad campaign for reunited, cut it. And anything, any kind of work that has begun on Brooke's bedroom line, cut it.",
        "Ridge: That was one of our most profitable lines, Mom.",
        "Stephanie: Not any more.",
        "Eric: You want Forrester to fail.",
        "Stephanie: I want this company to be a success. I want this company to represent women that are great, and sophisticated, and have style.",
        "Eric: You're not going to get away with this.",
        "Brooke: We're not giving up.",
        "Stephanie: You probably won't, but you are leaving. You have 30 minutes to clear your things out of the building. Good-bye.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you for staying.",
        "Taylor: Stephanie, if this is some kind of",
        "Taylor: Stephanie, if this is some kind of vendetta --",
        "Stephanie: It is not, Taylor. This is a fresh start for Forrester. Fresh ideas, and a fresh face. Thank you Mass, for your help.",
        "Massimo: Yes. About that Stephanie, I think we should talk about your plan.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I know. It isn't everything that I hoped it would be. I wanted everyone in the family to be on board. Thank you for staying, thank you for your support. Some people in this room haven't always gotten the respect and dignity due them. Well, guess what? This is our chance to earn that respect all on our own. We're going to make this company great, together.",
        "Ridge: This company is doomed.",
        "Brooke: We should've asked Rick to stay, Eric.",
        "Eric: We need somebody we can trust at International.",
        "Ridge: Trust to do what?",
        "Eric: Ridge, I appreciate your loyalty, but you don't have to leave.",
        "Ridge: I'm not staying.",
        "Eric: You're still head designer, nobody's asking you to leave.",
        "Ridge: Dad, Forrester Creations is a sinking ship here. I'm getting out for my own good. Mother's gone nuts, and she's taking the whole damn company with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[ Stephanie remembering ]",
        "Brooke: The queen herself,",
        "Ridge: Put it on her finger.",
        "Massimo: Relishing your victory?",
        "Stephanie: No, it's too soon. There's too much work to be done. I really am completely committed to restoring prestige to Forrester. And Mass, thank you for your help.",
        "Massimo: I appreciate that. But Stephanie, I didn't do it just for you. I also did it for our son. You know, there was a time there when I thought maybe Ridge might make a go of it at Marone, but he loves fashion. And he happens to be great at it. Which is why I expected you to recognize his contribution when you took over. But instead, what did you do? You made Thorne president.",
        "Stephanie: Because I know exactly where Thorne stands.",
        "Massimo: Well, Ridge belongs here as more than just the head designer.",
        "Stephanie: I agree with you, Mass. And he will be -- eventually. But right now, Brooke just exerts too much control over him. He's got to put that aside. When he does that, there's no end to the possibilities and opportunities for him at this company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I am not leaving. I don't care what Stephanie says. There have to be other avenues that we haven't explored.",
        "Eric: Brooke, Jonathan tells me I'll be very lucky if I'm not brought up on charges. I could easily be prosecuted for keeping that trust a secret all these years.",
        "Ridge: What were you thinking to do that?",
        "Eric: I was thinking of our family. With your mother's temper, and the questionable decisions that she's made over the years, I thought that your inheritance would be safer in my hands.",
        "Ridge: It's in her hands now, isn't it?",
        "Brooke: So our stake in the company, and our children's legacy -- it's just gone?",
        "Ridge: Well, if it's not now, it will be, especially with Thorne in charge.",
        "Eric: Ridge --",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry, Dad, but this is just too much. Thorne deserted us for Spectra. He doesn't give a damn what this shake-up is going to do to our company. Not to mention what it's going to do to my marriage. I can't believe Taylor went along with this. Look, I've got to talk to her.",
        "Eric: Go, go.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I thought we had put this favoritism thing behind us.",
        "Brooke: Leave it to Stephanie to dredge all this up. This is only the beginning, Eric. Now that Stephanie is in charge, she's going to make us pay. And pay dearly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darla: I think I'm in shock. I don't know what to say.",
        "Thorne: I don't either. I mean, I'm thrilled, of course --",
        "Darla: Me, too, baby.",
        "Darla: Well, I'm sure you'll find a way to make everything right. Now that you're president!",
        "Thorne: I can't believe that Mother promoted me over Ridge.",
        "Darla: Did you see the look on his face? He was completely sure that she chose him.",
        "Thorne: I know, he was. But she didn't. She chose me.",
        "Darla: That's right, baby. See? Didn't I tell you -- good things were right around the corner for us?",
        "Thorne: Honey, we were this close from being down and out. This close.",
        "Darla: I know, I know, I know. And, in an instant, everything just turned around, and we are back on top. Right where we belong. Honey, you are going to be the best president that Forrester has ever had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Is this still my office, or has Mother given it to you?",
        "Taylor: I was waiting for you.",
        "Ridge: I was afraid you'd still be in Dad's office, plotting Forrester's demise.",
        "Taylor: No, I think we're all going to need a little bit of time to digest what's happened.",
        "Ridge: Well, I hope you told Mother you're not going to be a part of this.",
        "Taylor: I told her she was out of line for attacking Eric.",
        "Ridge: Taylor, all of this is out of line.",
        "Taylor: Eric hid that trust from your mother their entire marriage.",
        "Ridge: Look, I wish he had done this differently -- I do. But, I don't think it's right for her to throw him out of his own company.",
        "Taylor: Her company.",
        "Ridge: Don't tell me you're buying into this.",
        "Taylor: Ridge, I think your mother has a lot of good ideas.",
        "Ridge: All she wants is revenge on Brooke.",
        "Taylor: No. Stephanie doesn't agree with what Brooke's influence has done to this company. And neither do I.",
        "Ridge: Taylor, this company has become a great success thanks to our leadership.",
        "Taylor: But she thinks she can do better.",
        "Ridge: Well, I don't know how. And I don't care. Because I'm not going to be working here, and neither are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: This goes.",
        "Massimo: Okay.",
        "Stephanie: This one goes. That stays. That stays. This goes. And this advertising campaign, which I've always thought was terrible --",
        "Massimo: Uh-huh.",
        "Stephanie: That goes. Finished. This goes.",
        "Massimo: Ah, Brooke's bedroom.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, or perhaps something Brooke wore for Eric's inspiration. I don't know, and I don't care.",
        "Massimo: It's over.",
        "Stephanie: You have some reservations, though, about what my plans are, don't you?",
        "Massimo: I would rather Rridge be a part of it.",
        "Stephanie: He will be. As soon as he understands that what I'm trying to do for the company is the right thing.",
        "Massimo: Well, I hope for your sake it happens sooner than later. I've got to get going. Have a good day, darling.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you. Thank you again, Mass. Travis, hi. Yes, it's Mrs. Forrester. Would you send one of the boys upstairs, please? I have some stuff I'd like to have you take over to Brooke's office. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Does Stephanie even know what she's doing to our children? To her children?",
        "Eric: Don't worry, I'll take care of the kids.",
        "Brooke: Eric, we're all going to be penniless if Stephanie has her way.",
        "Eric: Well, she won't.",
        "Brooke: We need to fight her.",
        "Eric: Let me handle Stephanie, all right?",
        "Brooke: She's doing this because of me.",
        "Eric: That's part of it. And that's why I want you to stay away from her. But Stephanie blames everyone for the way her life is turning out. Everyone except herself.",
        "Travis: Mrs. Forrester?",
        "Brooke: Yes?",
        "Travis: The other Mrs. Forrester wanted me to give you these. She wants you to vacate the premises immediately. If you fill the boxes, I can send them to your house with Mr. Forrester' things.",
        "Brooke: You're kidding, right?",
        "Travis: I'm sorry, ma'am.",
        "Brooke: No, I'm sorry, Travis. Stephanie never should have put you up to this. If she has something to say, she should say it to my face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Wow, I -- I can't tell you how good I feel.",
        "Darla: You should feel good. This is a huge step for you.",
        "Thorne: President of Forrester Creations --",
        "Darla: Ridge's boss.",
        "Thorne: Ridge's boss.",
        "[ Darla laughs ]",
        "Darla: If he stays --",
        "Ridge: No, he may not. He's not so thrilled with Mother at this point.",
        "Darla: Well, obviously she's thrilled with you.",
        "Thorne: She trusts me, Darla. Even though I left, even though I went to work for Spectra, I'm the one she wants by her side.",
        "Darla: She has faith in you, honey.",
        "Thorne: I know. That's what she said. She supports me, she's proud of me, but those were just words. I never felt it, Darla. I never felt it. Not until today. Today, I know it's true.",
        "Darla: Of course it is. It always has been. Your mother loves you, baby. Just as much as I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Ridge, we're only going to make the situation worse if we all overreact. We all need to just sit down and take a deep breath, and let everybody find a way to deal with what's happened.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm not going to deal with this.",
        "Taylor: Come on, Ridge. Just let Stephanie enjoy some power for a day or two.",
        "Ridge: She's abusing her power.",
        "Taylor: She's going to ask Eric to come back. And the minute she does, I'm going to be there to encourage and support that decision.",
        "Ridge: This company needs Dad right now.",
        "Taylor: This company needs you right now.",
        "Ridge: Not gonna happen.",
        "Taylor: You're the only designer Forrester has!",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well Thorne's going to have to bring someone in from Spectra, because I'm sure as hell not working for him.",
        "Taylor: We're all part of the same team.",
        "Ridge: This is not a team, Taylor. Dad, Brooke and I are a team -- this is a disaster waiting to happen. Thorne's already run spectra into the ground. The only thing mother has ever organized are charity events. And you have absolutely no experience whatsoever, so --",
        "Taylor: Your mother doesn't see that as a drawback.",
        "Ridge: Because she doesn't care about the company. All she cares about is punishing Brooke, and anybody who's had any support for her.",
        "Taylor: No, Stephanie seems to think I have something to contribute.",
        "Ridge: Taylor, you're a psychiatrist. You have no experience in the fashion industry.",
        "Taylor: I know what women want. I know that they're sick of being told that they aren't sexy or confident unless they wear a size zero and have their assets hanging out. Ridge, it's the truth. Clothes can actually change the way a woman views herself. And your mother wants to instill confidence and class in fashion. And I'm very flattered that she wants me to be a part of that.",
        "Ridge: But you can't help her. Nobody can. Because the woman's gone crazy!",
        "Taylor: Why do you always have to do that? Why do you have to diminish anything you don't agree with? For once, can't you just believe in me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Put that back.",
        "Stephanie: Excuse me?",
        "Brooke: I won't let you do this, Stephanie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: I mean, really, is that too much to ask? To have a little support from the man who's supposed to love me?",
        "Ridge: I do love you, Taylor.",
        "Taylor: Ridge, you just said that your mother would have to be crazy to hire me at Forrester.",
        "Ridge: That's not what I meant. And I'm sure you didn't mean to infer that the work I've done for the last two decades is demeaning to women.",
        "Taylor: No, but I do agree with some of the changes your mother wants to make.",
        "Ridge: What, to get rid of Brooke?",
        "Taylor: No. To restore Forrester to a mentality of class and dignity.",
        "Ridge: The only thing mother wants to restore is her dominance over Brooke. And she's using you to humiliate her.",
        "Taylor: Stephanie offered me a position, and I am very excited about it, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: A position that's not even going to exist six months from now, Taylor, when this company goes under. And it will, because you can't run a fashion house with a bitter woman set on vengeance, a proven loser and a psychiatrist.",
        "Taylor: Why does this have to be such a bad thing? Really, maybe it'll be good for Eric and Brooke to go take some time off and maybe go have their honeymoon. Focus on their new marriage, spend some time with their children?",
        "Ridge: As long as they are together, Mother will never let dad in here again.",
        "Taylor: Well, wouldn't that be all the more reason for you to stay? Keep an eye on things? I know I would love working with you. I really do think this plan stands a chance, Ridge. Think about it. The two of us working side by side, I know we could make this company into something amazing. For me, will you please just give it a try?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You have the company, Stephanie. You have the power. You don't need to create all this havoc.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I'm not going to work with people that aren't loyal to me.",
        "Brooke: You mean you're not going to work with people that are connected to me.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I mean, for example -- Eric, you've just turned his brains to mush.",
        "Brooke: You're so determined to hurt me that you're not thinking clearly. You really think it's a good thing to have Thorne and Taylor running the company?",
        "Stephanie: Well, of course I do! The three of us are going to bring back the respectability of this company.",
        "Brooke: Rick is not going to take orders from somebody who fired his mother and his father. And Ridge is not going to work for Thorne. So you don't have a designer. You're going about this the wrong way!",
        "Stephanie: Well, I'm sorry you think so. I just feel that I'm doing what has to be done.",
        "Brooke: No, you're doing whatever you have to do to make yourself feel better. But you're not doing what's best for the company!",
        "Stephanie: Well that's none of your concern anymore, though, is it?",
        "Brooke: It is my concern because this is my children's legacy, Stephanie! Don't take that away from them, please. Just to spite me -- don't do that. And don't take it away from Eric! Look, you can have my shares, instead.",
        "Stephanie: Another misguided sacrifice.",
        "Brooke: I am willing to meet you halfway. But if you don't accept my offer, I will have to fight. And I will, Stephanie. I will fight you, every step of the way. You're going to wish that you had gone to Florida.",
        "Stephanie: If you keep standing there, ya-ya-ya'ing, you're going to wish you never set foot in this office!",
        "Brooke: You don't scare me, you old bat. How many years have you tried to scare me, with your hatred, and your bitterness? It didn't work then. And it's not working now."
