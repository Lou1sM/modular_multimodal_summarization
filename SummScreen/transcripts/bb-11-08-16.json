{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7459 ~ Brooke reveals to Ridge her request of Bill, & Ridge then surprises her with a kiss; Quinn shares her plan for the upcoming Forrester Creations fashion show, much to Ridge's dismay."], "Recap": ["Alison tells Bill that the silence is killing her. He should have heard from Brooke by now. He reminds her that it was he that left Brooke at the altar but she will eventually be his wife. Katie stops in on Brooke and she says she still wants Bill as her husband but RJ is standing in the way right now. She wants to right that first. Katie says there is no drama in her life and well ..some things never change. Brooke has two men fighting over her and she can pick who she chooses while Katie reads a book. Brooke laughs that she has always needed a man in her life but she has always wanted to be more like Katie so self sufficient. Katie says now she is back in the game. Bill walks in so Katie leaves. He tells her that he is still pretty pissed that Ridge interrupted their wedding. Brooke says she did not invite Ridge in to do that. It was Bill that left her at the altar. Quinn corrects Ridge. It is not Quinn Fuller .it is now Quinn Forrester. She informs them she wants to go over the fashion show. Ridge finds that hard to believe that she would know anything about fashion. And he points to Wyatt and says he knows nothing about this business so he does not know why he is even here. Quinn says again she thinks Ridge needs to hear her thoughts. She says she wants to highlight the jewelry again as its own commodity. It will be a small part of the show, not focusing on it. He thinks it is the worst idea he has heard. And no he is not going to design for it.", "Bill tells Brooke that while he left her at the altar, it was she that left him downstairs while he was cooling his jet. He has a plan now. No wedding ceremony. They will start over and he will fire up his jet and they will run off and get married. Quinn says then she wants to be sure they are on the same page. Is Ridge refusing to design for her. She calls for a vote and Wyatt makes it in her favor. Ridge finds that hilarious. He thinks it is asinine and will not be able to look at people and keep a straight face. She asks the others to leave and wants to speak to Ridge. She tells him she knows he does not like her here but he can hold his nose and go along. He tells her he appreciates her sitting in that chair and keeping it warm but he will be back in it soon. She soon will just be another bad chapter in his dad's life of failed relationships. There is only one love of his life and she is not here. Bill tells Brooke that he is only going to ask her one more time does she still have feelings for Ridge. She says her love for Bill has never wavered but she can't answer the question of how she feels about Ridge. Bill says they have waited long enough ..he has waited long enough so he leaves and Ridge just happens to walk into her office the next instant. She tells him Bill came to whisk her away and Ridge wants to know why then is she still here. She says they both left each other at the altar and it was Ridge's fault. He says he is not apologizing. And if Bill is pressuring her just let him know. Maybe that is why Bill just rushed out. Maybe she will change her mind and come back to him and RJ and they will be a family again. He informs her that RJ wants a steak tonight and since Quinn is still at the mansion he expects to do it in Brooke's kitchen, so be ready tonight. Quinn tells Wyatt that Ridge can be gruff at times but she too can be relentless so they should all hang in there. She practices her little speech which Wyatt tells her she must make .Ridge is spying behind the curtain."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: Done. Call list?", "Alison: I can return most of these myself, but you're gonna have to deal with Joe Armstrong.", "Bill: I'm sick of pulling that guy off the ceiling! What else?", "Alison: I was expecting you to hear from someone by now, but radio silence.", "Bill: Who's that?", "Alison: Brooke. Silence is getting a little loud. Are you concerned?", "Bill: No. You think I should be?", "Alison: I can't imagine how it felt, I mean, especially for a heartbreaker like Brooke just being left at the altar.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Nice of you to stop by.", "Katie: You're not even supposed to be here. So you didn't marry bill?", "Brooke: It wasn't my decision.", "Katie: What happened?", "Brooke: Ridge showed up.", "Katie: For the shares?", "Brooke: For me.", "Katie: [Laughs]", "Brooke: Oh, Katie, come on. Don't do that. I didn't invite ridge over to barge in and break up my wedding. Everything is still as is planned. I want to be bill's wife.", "Katie: So what's stopping you?", "Brooke: R.J., for one. He's not completely on board, and that bothers me.", "Katie: How much of this has to do with ridge?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: And there it is, the Forrester creations brain trust. God help us.", "Quinn: [Sighs] Good morning, ridge.", "Ridge: Good morning, Quinn. So what do we have here? Little diamond thief, my turncoat cousin from down under, and the quintessential wicked witch of the west coast. My father's latest and greatest mistake, Quinn fuller.", "Quinn: Hmm. Forrester. The name is Quinn Forrester.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Anything else?", "Alison: So you haven't heard from Brooke?", "Bill: No. And let's get something straight. I was the one left at the altar while she was upstairs indulging the dressmaker.", "Alison: She was so close to becoming your wife.", "Bill: She will be my wife.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: What's that look?", "Katie: If Forrester creations could bottle what you've got, they'd make millions.", "Brooke: Are you teasing me?", "Katie: A little. You mind?", "Brooke: No, actually, I don't. It's been a long time since you've felt this comfortable, comfortable enough to fall back into our old rhythms. And that's all my fault. I've been a horrible sister to you. The fact that you're standing here talking to me shows what an amazing person you are.", "Katie: I could never cut you out of my life for good, Brooke. You know that.", "Brooke: I'm relieved to hear that.", "Katie: And it appears that all is right with the world again. We are both in our proper places. I go to bed with a book, and you go to bed with whomever you choose. [Chuckles] I-I really don't have anything to complain about. I mean, I've got a beautiful, happy, healthy son and no drama in my life. Unlike you. It seems you have two men fighting over you again. Some things never change.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: So, why did you summon me, Elphaba?", "Quinn: [Sighs] Because we have work to do. We have a fashion show to put on. Oh, and your designs are terrific.", "Ridge: Thank you. It means a lot coming from the interim C.E.O.", "Quinn: Eric's are better, of course.", "Ridge: Always have been. Why did you need me?", "Quinn: I wanted to go over the show rundown with you.", "Ridge: The one that you decided.", "Quinn: Well, with the help of my team.", "Ridge: Yeah, your team. Uh-huh. All right, this looks pretty normal. Cocktail on to full length. What is -- what is this here? You have a-a jewelry pass? What is that?", "Quinn: It's an idea I had.", "Ridge: You had an idea about fashion?", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I guess this is why I've always wished I was more like you.", "Brooke: [Sighs] Katie.", "Katie: No, you always have this flurry of male activity surrounding you. You make men crazy.", "Brooke: Well, I'm not sure that's really something to wish for. But since we're on this topic, I've always wanted to be more like you.", "Katie: [Laughs]", "Brooke: Self-sufficient, independent. I've always needed a man in my life. It was hard for me to adjust to being alone. But I think I finally got it. I could be happy by myself.", "Katie: And now you're back in the game. Two men want to marry you.", "Brooke: Yeah. But the one I said yes to left me at the altar.", "[Door opens]", "Brooke: Bill.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I thought we should talk. Hi, Katie.", "Katie: Hi, bill.", "Bill: How's will?", "Katie: He's great.", "Bill: Well, tell him I can't wait to see him.", "Katie: Will do. I'm gonna go.", "Brooke: Thanks for stopping by.", "Katie: Sure. You bet.", "Bill: You and Katie in a good place?", "Brooke: Yeah, I guess. How about us?", "Bill: Truthfully, I'm -- I'm still pretty pissed about ridge interrupting our wedding.", "Brooke: [Sighs] I am, too. I didn't invite him over, bill. In fact, I kicked him out. And I told you I still wanted to be your wife. I had the minister start the ceremony, and you stopped it. You left me at the altar.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: So let me get this straight. You have an idea about fashion even though you don't know the first thing about fashion. Or you. You don't know the first thing about anything. So it's got to be you, huh? You got family in the business, so you have to be the leader of this...idea band.", "Quinn: Doesn't he have a great sense of humor? I mean, somebody should give you your own late-night television show. You would have them rolling in the aisles.", "Ridge: Thank you. But the only thing that's funny around here is you trying to make an artistic decision for this company.", "Quinn: Yeah, and yet here I am, so why don't we just make the best of it, okay? As C.E.O., Sometimes I come up with the occasional idea, hence the jewelry pass. Would you like to hear my thoughts?", "Ridge: I don't -- okay, sure.", "Quinn: Okay. Well, our jewelry line has always been profitable, but it's always been seen as an accessory, an afterthought. I would like to change that. I'd like to highlight the jewelry as a commodity in its own right, and I think the fashion show is the perfect place for that. I'm thinking that all of the models will wear matching gowns so that they virtually disappear and they become a backdrop. And then you and I can collaborate on the designs, you know. Would the models wear their hair up, minimal makeup so as to showcase the pieces.", "Ridge: So that's your idea?", "Quinn: Yeah.", "Ridge: Front of a fashion show all about jewelry?", "Quinn: No. I didn't say that. Not all about jewelry. A small part of the show. I think it would be very interesting.", "Ridge: Ohhh. Okay, now I get it. I'm sorry. Yes. So, that has to be the worst idea I've ever heard. And before you ask me, no, I'm not gonna design for it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Well, that's funny, but my memory of our almost-wedding is a little bit different than yours.", "Brooke: Really?", "Bill: Before I...so-called left you at the altar, you left me downstairs cooling my jets while you were upstairs engaging with Forrester.", "Brooke: I shouldn't have done that.", "Bill: No, Brooke, you really shouldn't have. But I don't want to rehash what happened yesterday. That's behind us. I'm all about moving forward.", "Brooke: So you have a plan.", "Bill: You bet I have a plan. We're gonna get on my jet, we'll fly to the Stella Maris, and get married there. The captain will officiate, and we'll already be in place for our honeymoon. We'll start over.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: So, just to make sure that we're all on the same page here, you're refusing to design for me?", "Ridge: Yes. And this jewelry pass is stupid.", "Quinn: Ah. Okay. Well, why don't we put that to a vote? Yours is duly noted. And, ivy, I'm just gonna let you abstain so you don't have to get in the middle.", "Ivy: Hmm. Thank you.", "Quinn: Wyatt?", "Wyatt: Jewelry pass? Definitely.", "Quinn: Oh. Well, that's a yay for Wyatt. And as C.E.O., I'm gonna say yay, so I guess that means you're out-voted and jewelry pass is in.", "Ridge: So Oedipus agreed with his mommy. That's a shocker.", "Quinn: You know what? Eric gave me his trust to run this company as I see fit. Stop fighting so hard against me. Come on. A jewelry pass is a great addition to an already fabulous show. I ran it by Eric last night, and he loved it.", "Ridge: And now I have the idea of you convincing my dad in my head.", "Quinn: [Sighs] Can't we just stay on point? I'm trying to make this the best show possible.", "Ridge: And how are you doing that? By doing -- what -- a jewelry pass? How am I gonna explain that to people? It's asinine! I have to greet people and keep a straight face!", "Quinn: Well, luckily, you don't have to worry about that because I will be making the introductions.", "Ridge: You?", "Quinn: Can you guys give us a minute, please?", "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Sure.", "Ivy: [Sighs]", "[Door opens]", "[Door closes]", "Quinn: I know you hate my presence here. But maybe you can just hold your nose and try to get through it, because Eric will be back soon. I will see to that.", "Ridge: I know it doesn't look that way, but I'm trying, Quinn. I'm trying. Trying to see what my dad sees in you. I get it. It's fantastic. But all of this means nothing because your soul is the darkest thing I have ever seen. And soon my dad's gonna realize that, and you're gonna become just another ridiculous chapter in his book of failed affairs. There's only one love of his life. She's not here anymore. You can't replace her. And I think somewhere in all that darkness, you know that. So come on. I can't design things for you. It's a waste of time for both of us. You're not gonna be here. And as far as you sitting in that chair, keeping it warm, I appreciate it. 'Cause I'll be back soon. I promise you.", "Quinn: Ridge.", "Ridge: Yeah?", "Quinn: All of this means everything.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door closes]", "Bill: The Stella Maris is waiting. We can be married by tomorrow.", "Brooke: [Sighs] Bill, you really hurt me when you walked out on our wedding.", "Bill: Brooke, hurt's a two-way street. I mean, when I walked in on you and ridge in my bedroom on our wedding --", "Brooke: Yeah, but I kicked him out. I wanted to marry you. The wedding started, and then you left. And now today you're saying you want to marry me.", "Bill: I never didn't want to marry you. I just didn't want to have our wedding day tainted by the presence of that pathetic loser.", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "Bill: Yet again. But that was then, and this is now. And now it's just the two of us. So yes, you bet I want to marry you today. Of course I do. Brooke, I asked you weeks ago if you had any residual feelings for Forrester, and I told you to own them if you did. You swore to me that you didn't. But since he sold you with that destiny, blah, blah, blah crap, did he get to you? I'm only gonna ask you this once more. Do you have any feelings for Forrester?", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "Bill: After everything that we have been through all these years. I end my marriage. I end my family for us. My love for you has never wavered.", "Brooke: And my love for you has never wavered. I do love you, bill. And I do want to marry you.", "Bill: And I want to marry you. But not under these circumstances. No way. We have waited long enough. I have waited long enough.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: [Sighs]", "Ridge: Hey. I saw bill leave in a huff. He didn't seem happy. Hopefully 'cause you told him that no man leaves you at the altar.", "Brooke: Yeah, well, he wouldn't have left me at the altar if you didn't barge in and break up our wedding.", "Ridge: Well, I hope you're not gonna hold that against me. I'M...trying to help.", "Brooke: Okay.", "Ridge: What happened between the two of you?", "Brooke: [Scoffs] Well... he wanted to whisk me away and marry me.", "Ridge: So why are you still here?", "Ridge: You're upset because bill left you at the altar, and I don't blame you. It says a lot about the guy.", "Brooke: He's upset with me, too. And you and your part in all of this.", "Ridge: I'm not apologizing. I was fighting for my family.", "Brooke: Katie has a family. And they were happy together until I came along and messed everything up.", "Ridge: Don't do that.", "Brooke: You know, if bill and I do get married, at least that would justify what happened to Katie and will. [Sighs] What am I doing, ridge?", "Ridge: You're taking your time, trying to make the right decision. It's good. And if Spencer's pressuring you, let me know. I'll just --", "Brooke: No, he just -- he walked out.", "Ridge: He'll be back.", "Brooke: I'm not so certain.", "Ridge: That's not necessarily bad news, though.", "Brooke: You know, he asked me a little while ago if I still had residual feelings for you. And I told him no, that I was completely committed to him. And then he asked me again earlier.", "Ridge: And what did you say? Maybe that's why he stormed out. It's, uh, what's -- what's the word? It's encouraging to think that maybe one day he'll be out of your life and you'll come back home to me and R.J.", "Brooke: When did I say that?", "Ridge: Just now. I can see it right in there. Give it a month.", "Brooke: Before I marry bill?", "Ridge: Before you marry me. You know, I hate to think that -- what's his name? Bill Spencer is right about anything. He's right about us. We will be together again. Oh. R.J. Wants pepper steak, and Quinn, the bad witch, is still at the Forrester house, so I'm gonna have to use your kitchen tonight. Medium well, right?", "Brooke: Ah --", "Ridge: Okay.", "Brooke: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: All right, well, the prep's all coming together.", "Ivy: Hey, what's gonna happen if ridge doesn't design for the jewelry pass? I mean, what then?", "Quinn: Improvise. I can be really good at that.", "Wyatt: Let's not remember.", "Quinn: Oh, just because I've changed doesn't mean that I've eliminated all of my useful skills. You know, improvisation is a good quality in a C.E.O.", "Wyatt: I agree. You've been a great C.E.O.", "Quinn: Aww.", "Wyatt: You didn't even let ridge throw you off.", "Quinn: Oh, well. He can be angry and gruff sometimes, but he's gonna come around.", "Ivy: Uh, I don't know. Ridge can be kind of stubborn.", "Quinn: And I can be relentless. Don't worry. Everything is gonna be great.", "Wyatt: Hmm. Well, we were just out in the showroom. It looks great. It looks amazing.", "Quinn: Yeah. I know. This is all so exciting. It's my very first Forrester creations fashion show run by little, ol' me with the help of my team, of course. Hey, you guys, thank you so much for sticking by my side.", "Ivy: [Chuckles] Hey, are you nervous?", "Quinn: Of course. Who wouldn't be?", "Wyatt: Well, Mrs. Interim C.E.O., you better get up there and practice the speech 'cause you're gonna have to have one at the end.", "Quinn: No, I didn't write anything. I mean, I don't know that I'm even going to.", "Wyatt: What did you just say about improv?", "Quinn: Ugh! All right! Okay! Uh, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Forrester creations' fashion show. We have some amazing designs for you to see today. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the artistry. My name is Quinn fuller, and -- my name is Quinn Forrester, and I am the C.E.O. of Forrester Creations. [Laughs] That's all I came up with.", "Wyatt: Yeah! That's great!", "Quinn: Yeah?", "Ivy: That's good!", "Quinn: [Laughs]", "Wyatt: I'm so proud of you.", "Quinn: Oh, thank you so much. That means everything to me.", "Wyatt: It's gonna be really good."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHje3hRqi80"}
