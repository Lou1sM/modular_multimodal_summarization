        "Eric: Your mother and I have a history, Ridge. ",
        "Ridge: Okay. And what, inertia keeps you going? ",
        "Eric: Yeah, that. And the fact that I'm fascinated by her. Look, I needed \r\nher, Ridge. I needed her ferocious will and her obsessions, even. And in that \r\nway, I thought I could have both lives that I wanted, as an artist and as a \r\nfamily man. But I see now that I yielded too much. She kept me estranged from my \r\nchildren and she ran my business with an iron fist, and then she took it away \r\nfrom me the first chance she got. ",
        "Ridge: Well, you could have walked when we were all grown up. You did. Okay, \r\nyou yielded to what we thought was Felicia's dying wish -- you remarried. But \r\nFelicia's okay now. ",
        "Eric: There's love there, Ridge. You've seen that. And if there were 50 words \r\nfor love, I might choose another, but there's love there. I stay with your \r\nmother because it's too hard for me not to. And I consider that a weakness. \r\nEverything that's most important to me, every relationship, every affinity, \r\neverything in my life is in a web that your mother is right at the center of. \r\nHow many times have you told her to get the hell out of your life and stop \r\nrunning it? And yet, here you and I are, just waiting to hear from her on the \r\nphone to see if our life's work is forfeit or if you will ever be able to share \r\nyour life with Brooke again. ",
        "Ridge: She fights our battles, that's for sure. Mine, too. But she'll eat \r\ncrow if she has to. Now everything depends on that. ",
        "",
        "Stephanie: I see, you want to keep the world safe from me. ",
        "Jackie: That's right. ",
        "Stephanie: Too bad those surgeons, while they were tinkering around in your \r\nhead, didn't put some real character into you. ",
        "Jackie: I've said all I have to say to you. ",
        "Stephanie: I can see that these aches and pains of yours are going to become \r\nquite a convenience for you. ",
        "Jackie: Do I have to call security? ",
        "Stephanie: A convenience that will enable you to line your pockets. And keep \r\nBrooke away from my son by blackmailing us into giving you the company. ",
        "Jackie: Blackmail? ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, blackmail. You think you've got me in a situation where I \r\nwill do just about anything to get out of it. I know my temper gets the best of \r\nme sometimes. But at least I face things straight on. Is it my fault if other \r\npeople are sometimes afraid, weak-willed? You know, I think I'd rather be a \r\nbully than an ineffectual person like you, who's never faced anything head on.\r\n",

        "Brooke: Nick, I don't think you've thought this out. Who will run Forrester?\r\n",
        "Nick: My mother and I. She knows fashion, I know business. And you, if you \r\nwant to be part of it. ",
        "Brooke: And this is how we will make decisions? What you say goes, and what I \r\nthink doesn't? I do own 50% of the company, you know. ",
        "Nick: And I was willing to try it your way. I agreed to all of your terms, \r\nand I said I'd give it my best, be more sensitive, more respectful. Where did \r\nthat get me? It got me in a horse race with Ridge, again! While you sit back and \r\nyou weigh your options, and you decided you didn't want to be with either of us. \r\nWell, that's not the kind of man I am. And I don't think that's the man that you \r\nfell in love with. ",
        "Brooke: I see. If you want to take their stock and you want to kick them out \r\nof their own company, I can't stop you. But you'll have to do it without me. ",
        "",
        "Eric: I'm thinking that no news is not good news. ",
        "Ridge: If mother strikes out with Jackie, then we're going to have to take \r\nthis to court. ",
        "Eric: Ridge, your vote carries as much weight as mine, but I vote against \r\ngoing to court. ",
        "Ridge: Hey, it's all evidence. Any jury is going to see what Nick and Jackie \r\nare really trying to do here. Nick's trying to kill two birds with one stone. He \r\nthinks he can destroy us and separate Brooke from me, but I think it's gonna \r\nbackfire. I think Brooke will finally see nick for who he really is. Any \r\nfeelings she might still have left for him will all turn to dust. ",
        "Brooke: You can't do this Nick, force that family out of their own business. \r\nIt's wrong. ",
        "Nick: If Forrester Creations comes to me, it will be a legitimate business \r\ndeal, and there precious matriarch will go unpunished again. But if they choose \r\nto keep the company, I will not rest until Stephanie Forrester pays the full \r\nprice for what she's done to you and my mother. I'll protect the ones I love at \r\nany cost. 'Cause it's all I have. So be prepared to see a side of me you never \r\nknew existed. ",
        "",
        "Jackie: What exactly was your mission here, Stephanie? Make nice? Maybe \r\nJacqueline will say it was all a mistake? You're so wonderfully clever at \r\ncontrolling people, except yourself. ",
        "Stephanie: Careful. Remember my temper? ",
        "Jackie: Tempted to finish the job? ",
        "Stephanie: I never started the job. ",
        "Jackie: You know what galls you the most? It's the prospect of losing Brooke, \r\nisn't it? Because without Brooke's humanity and her warmth, your company doesn't \r\nwork. It's nothing. Your family is nothing. Pity it took you so long to see \r\nthat. But don't worry about Brooke. Nick will take care of her. ",
        "Stephanie: She has left him. She's not going to come back, not after this \r\nblackmail fiasco. ",
        "Jackie: My decision is made. It's time for you to make a choice -- Forrester \r\nCreations or your freedom, you choose. But either way, it doesn't matter, \r\nbecause your reign of abuse and bullying people, it's over. ",
        "Stephanie: This is not going to work, Jackie. You don't have anything over \r\nme. What are you going to do, prosecute? I don't care, go ahead. In the end, \r\nyou'll end up with nothing. They're not going to send me to jail, because it was \r\nan accident. And my family is not going to turn over Forrester Creations to you \r\nand your son. Never. Never! Never."
