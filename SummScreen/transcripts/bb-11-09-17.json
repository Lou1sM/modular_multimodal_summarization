{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7712 ~ Wyatt offers Bill his absolute and steadfast allegiance after having seen Bill and Liam's fallout; Liam visits Sally and they rehash their moments in the collapse, which has bonded them forever."], "Recap": ["Liam thinks about the Sally kiss in the rubble. She is thinking about it too. Coco makes her some lunch for the most important person in her life. Bill asks Wyatt if he has talked to his brother this morning. Wyatt says he was in the shower so he missed the call. Surely Bill knows it was not Liam's and Sally's fault but neither was it Bill's as he thought they had left the building. Bill says Sally is more pathetic than she was before she lost the building. And Liam is right there in his feeling beholden to her. Sally tells Coco that she was really afraid she was not going to make it out of that hole alive and never see Coco again. But Liam is her guardian angel and she had to tell him how she felt. Liam talks about Bill's obsession and Steffy reminds him that he has one too over Sally. She almost lost him because of it. He says he wishes things could be better with his dad over this but he does not see it. She tells him just to go back to his trust and understanding the way he was a few days ago. He rants that Bill has to win at all costs especially over his own sniveling son. He has to compromise all his own feelings. Steffy says he does not trust his dad and she does not trust Sally but she is glad she is okay. Listen to her \u0096 she thinks he needs to cut all ties to Sally Spectra. Suddenly he says he needs to go. Wyatt tells Bill whatever he needs he will do. He is proud to be Bill Spencer's son. Bill says he has been more than loyal and certainly more than his other son. No good will come from that.", "Liam shows up at Sally's and Coco makes herself scarce. Sally says when they are young they do not think of danger. She has never had anyone do what he did before in trying to save her. He tells her the building may be gone but the talent is still there. She says maybe but she doubts it will be here in L.A. She says she told him she loved him and said too much and she will keep her mouth shut. Steffy shows up at Bill's and said Liam ran out on her so she thought she would check up on him. He gives his account of Brooke being there and what he said made no difference. This time they are finally over. He takes off his wedding ring and throws it on the table. Steffy says she is sorry. He wishes Brooke could be as understanding as Steffy. He says he will always love her but she could not give him her love and support when he needed it like Steffy does. She does not jump to conclusions like others do. She tells him he is a leader and a renegade but Liam is sensitive and that's why she loves him. Bill wonders how she can be so wise. Liam tells Sally that she will make it absolutely clear to Steffy that none of this was Sally's fault but he can't not tell her. He has broken his loyalty vow and he cannot break this one too. She wonders why he would take that chance. She can take this to her grave. She does not expect anything from him. He is a wonderful man and she wants to do what he wants. But she does not have a good feeling about this \u0096 do not tell Steffy."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Liam: [ Coughs ]", "Steffy: I got a text from my dad! [ Coughs ] He just wanted to make sure you're okay.", "Liam: Well, tell him -- tell him I am.", "Steffy: I did. I told him you were the luckiest man alive.", "Liam: Okay. Okay.", "Steffy: Oh, my god, liam...", "Liam: Hey. Hey. I'm okay.", "Steffy: [ Sighs ] Are you? After everything you've been through? After what you and sally have been through, are you really okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: I love you, liam.", "Coco: I made all your favorites, sis. Well, almost all of them. We didn't have any chocolate chips for the pancakes, so I had to improvise.", "Sally: You should not have gone through all this trouble.", "[ Coughs ]", "Coco: Are you kidding? You're my big sis and my roomie. I almost lost the most important person in my life.", "Sally: But you didn'T.", "Coco: Thank goodness. But we did lose spectra. And I will never forgive bill spencer for that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Have you talked to your brother this morning?", "Wyatt: He was in the shower when I called. Steffy said that he's a little sore, coughing a little, but he'll be okay. Physically, at least. What about you? You said you talked to brooke. How'd that go?", "Bill: She's more or less written me off. No, correction -- she has written me off.", "Wyatt: Geez. Dad.... [ Scoffs ] What happened to liam and sally wasn't your fault. You had no idea they ran back in the building. Brooke understands that, right?", "Bill: I don't think she wants to, wyatt. And liam? He's done with me, too.", "Wyatt: What exactly happened at the hospital between you and liam?", "Bill: Oh, your brother just kept going on and on and on, not pulling any punches, just defending sally spectra. You know, it's like she's got the hold over him.", "Wyatt: What do you mean, the hold?", "Bill: The hold, wyatt.", "Wyatt: The hold. Yeah.", "Bill: Yeah. Right? Look at his behavior, the decisions he's been making. Everything about propping up sally and spectra. And that was before the explosion. Well, now that she's lost the building, imagine how insufferable he's gonna be. I mean, she's more pathetic than she was before.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: Hey, do you want jam for your toast? We're out, but I could probably borrow some from mrs. Everhart.", "Sally: [ Coughs ] The lady across the hall who has six cats all named zoey?", "Coco: Yeah. Hey, we should get a pet. Like a sweet little stray from the local shelter. Hey, liam's still a part of that, right? Like, uh, the animal rescue?", "Sally: How'd you know about that?", "Coco: Steffy must have mentioned it, or maybe it was R.J. Anyway, it's yet another wonderful cause that liam champions. Besides spectra. And you. You have mentioned multiple times that he's your guardian angel.", "Sally: [ Coughs ] Our guardian angel. But you're right. I mean, yeah, without liam... I was really scared that i wasn't gonna make it out of there alive. That I was never gonna see you or grams ever again. But if that had been my last moment, at least I said what i needed to say to liam. I told him how I feel.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: My dad just never should have authorized the --", "Steffy: Shh.", "Liam: [ Coughs ] He shouldn't have done it. There were -- there were other options on the table, and I was trying to convince him, but no, leveling the building right now was just non-negotiable for him. It'S... it's an obsession.", "Steffy: What about your obsession? You defending sally at every turn. Going toe-to-toe with your father over sally, that wasn't enough? You staged a sit- in, liam. You staged a sit-in, something i knew that was gonna end badly, and it did, and for what? For sally spectra? Liam, I could have lost you.", "Liam: Trust me, I wish things could be different with my dad, but after this, they're not gonna be.", "Steffy: Baby... don't say that. [ Coughs ] He's your father and he loves you.", "Liam: Yeah, he loves me in his own way. But I meant what I said at the hospital.", "Steffy: Okay, emotions were high, all right? Let's just go back to a place of forgiveness and understanding like you were only a few days ago with your father.", "Liam: How am I supposed to do that when I don't trust him? You understand? I don't trust my own father because he almost killed sally and me. And all of that was preventable. But, no! Oh, no! Big dollar bill spencer, he can't look like he's caving in, especially not a puny little sit-in. He has to win, right? He has to win at all costs. That's his thing, and that's exactly what happened. Spectra's gone. Now he gets to build his...idiotic skyscraper and just bask in the glory of that to his ego's content. Well, I don't want to be a part of that, steffy. [ Coughs ] Especially if it means compromising what I stand for, which is righting wrongs like this.", "Steffy: Wrongs done to sally spectra in particular? A woman who have strong feelings about, a woman who has crossed so many lines and undoubtedly will again? You say you don't trust your father. Well, hey, I don't trust sally. Look, I'm glad that she's okay. I know that you two went through something very intense together. [ Sighs ] I'm just -- I don't want you to feel like you need to help her anymore. Liam... I get it, okay? You've been a friend to her. [ Coughs ] You've been.... you've been a real, real good friend. Baby... listen to me. I think you need to cut ties with sally spectra. You need to kiss her goodbye.", "Liam: Hey, steffy. I, um... I need to go.", "Steffy: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: You know I'm here for you, right? Whatever you need me to do...", "Bill: Wyatt, listen... you've already shown me so much support and understanding. You've been more loyal than a father could ever hope for.", "Wyatt: Well, I'm -- I'm proud to be bill spencer's son. I mean, you've given me a ton of opportunities and an amazing life and everything. Running this company with you and liam is a dream.", "Bill: Well, liam's turning his back on that. You know, he'd rather continue playing the knight in shining idiot to sally's damsel in distress. I promise you this -- no good is gonna come from it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: I read somewhere that people in life-or-death situations tend to share things that they otherwise wouldn'T. Is that what happened with you, sis? You thought you and liam wouldn't make it out alive, so...", "Sally: [ Coughs ]", "[ Knocks on door ]", "Liam: Hey, sally. It's me.", "Coco: No, I'll get it.", "Sally: [ Coughs ]", "Coco: Hey.", "Liam: Hey, coco. How's your sister?", "Coco: See for yourself. But first, I just -- I want to thank you again for everything you did for sally. I'm gonna go see if the cat lady has any jam.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: [ Sighs ] [ Coughs ] I know why you're here. The kiss. I get it. Look, it never happened.", "[ Coughs ]", "Liam: Sally...", "Sally: No, liam. The things that I said, the crazy-frightening circumstances, I honestly did not think we were gonna make it out of there alive. You know, when you're young, you don't ever think about dying. You just take risks because you think it'll all be all right, no matter how much the odds are against --", "Liam: Sally, the sit-in was my idea. I take full responsibility --", "Sally: No, no, no. Look, I don't blame you for any of that, okay? [ Coughs ] You were trying to save spectra because you knew how much it meant to me and my family, and you were not gonna let bill destroy it without a fight. I have never had anyone in my corner like that ever before.", "Liam: I'm sorry I couldn't stop him.", "Sally: Me, too, you know? But we gave it our all. And then some.", "Liam: Well...", "Sally: [ Coughs ]", "Liam: Hey, the building may be gone... [ Coughs ] ...But the talent behind it -- it's still there. You can find a way back from this, sally.", "Sally: Maybe. But I doubt it will be here in L.A.", "Liam: Why not?", "Sally: I told you I loved you, liam. And I said a lot of other things, none of which I want to retract, but... I will keep my mouth shut. About the kiss, about all of it. Steffy does not need to know.", "Liam: Actually, um... I think she does.", "Sally: Why?", "Liam: I have to be honest with my wife, sally.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I called alison. She said you were at the office and then you left.", "Bill: Yeah, I wasn't getting much accomplished, so... here I am. I thought you would be with your husband.", "Steffy: I was. And then he had to run out, so i just wanted to check up on you.", "Bill: Appreciate it. And as you can see, I'M... fine and dandy.", "Steffy: I talked to liam. I'm really trying to get through to him.", "Bill: Yeah, let me guess.", "Steffy: I'm not giving up, bill. The spencer family, we need to heal.", "Bill: What's left of the spencer family. Brooke's already bailed.", "Steffy: Have you spoken to her since --", "Bill: I almost blew my son and his favorite redhead to smithereens. Yeah, she was here. To give me an earful about all of it.", "Steffy: Well, did you tell her it was an accident?", "Bill: Well, of course I told her. It didn't make any difference. This time, brooke and I are finally over.", "Steffy: I'm really sorry, bill.", "Bill: Yeah. Me, too. I'm sorry that brooke couldn't be more understanding. Like you.", "Steffy: Brooke and I are very different. I don't always get her, but the one thing I do know is that she loves you. Despite everything.", "Bill: Well, I'll always love her, too, but the fact is, when I needed her, when I needed her support, she couldn't give it. Not like you.", "Steffy: Maybe because I've seen what you've gone through firsthand and brooke hasn'T. She left you. She walked away before all of this happened.", "Bill: You're incredible, you know that? You don't judge. You don't jump to conclusions. You really try to see all sides.", "Steffy: I really just want peace in this family, bill. I really do. You, wyatt, and liam -- you are all phenomenal men. I mean, yeah, you guys are different, but you really need to just value and appreciate those differences. Don't use them against each other. You're a leader, you're a renegade, and, yeah, okay... liam is sensitive. But he's committed. And that's why I love him, you know? His commitment, especially to our marriage.", "Bill: How can you be so wise?", "Steffy: Because I come from a marriage with rock-solid foundation. I see the goodness in people. And that's really because of liam. He's opened my eyes to see the importance of devotion and trust in every relationship. Especially a marriage.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Liam, you can'T.", "Liam: I have to. Sally, I -- I have to. I can't -- I can't be keeping secrets from my wife.", "Sally: I know! I know, okay? But the second she finds out that it was me that you kissed...", "Liam: I promise you I will make it absolutely crystal-clear it wasn't your fault. I mean, it wasn'T. It came out of this life-or-death situation.", "Sally: [ Coughs ] Which it did. It did, okay? But steffy will never understand that, especially when she feels about me the way that she does. If it was any other woman, maybe, but the fact that it was me...", "Liam: I can't not tell her. I mean, I -- I already broke the loyalty vow. I'm not gonna break the honesty one, too.", "Sally: Even if it could tear you two and your marriage apart?", "Liam: I don't think it'll come to that. I -- [ Scoffs ] I have to believe it won't come to that.", "Sally: Well, I hope not. For your sake. But why even take that chance? Look, I'm not gonna breathe a word to anyone -- not to my grams, not to coco. I will take this to my grave. Look, liam, people have their moments, their secrets. I don't expect anything from you. I feel nothing but gratitude and respect for you.", "Liam: I -- I appreciate that. But it's not really about you. It's about me, my principles, and the vows I made to steffy when we were married. I -- [ Scoffs ] I couldn't sleep last night.", "Sally: [ Sighs ] Oh, my god. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.", "Liam: No. Don't be.", "Sally: No! I never wanted to hurt you or to haunt you. You are a kind, good man who has been nothing but wonderful to me, and I want for you what you want. Which is steffy. I just don't have a good feeling about it. I really don't have a good feeling. Please don't tell her, liam. Do not tell steffy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Liam is loyal and committed. And you two can have that again. Just like liam and I do in our marriage, and we always will."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLUgGQPJSgg"}
