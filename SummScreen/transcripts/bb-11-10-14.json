        "Wyatt urges Lars to set up a romantic trip down the canal but not to tell Hope. Just let Liam and Ivy think it is a special Dutch welcome. Quinn confides in Deacon that if Wyatt can set something up maybe it will speed things along from just the handholding stage with Ivy and Liam. She even proposes a trip to Amsterdam for her and Deacon. He shows her a pix of the sonogram of her grandson and how this would be a terrible idea to interfere more. She is her own worst enemy. She will screw up Wyatt's relationship behind the scenes. He says it makes sense to get Ivy and Liam together but she is pushing too hard. She says she can not stand around and do nothing. He says they will always be there for them when they need them, but Wyatt and Hope need space. Let Hope come to her. Eva says Ivy is the mystery behind the jewelry and she should be in front of the camera too. Hope and Wyatt are not exactly for that but say they will get back to her. Hope tells Wyatt that enough is enough and she does not want Ivy moving in on her life anymore. That includes modeling and being with Liam too. She says she is sorry. Wyatt says he is not jealous. She says it's not like she can say no so she will deal with it.",
        "Ivy tells Liam that Hope does not want her modeling and to tell the truth she thinks Hope is having a tough time seeing them together. He gets a call that he must go take so he says he will meet up with her later. Quinn agrees with Deacon and says she will not go to Amsterdam. But she does call to make sure that Wyatt and Hope have checked into their rooms.....and then manages to ask if Ivy and Liam have checked in. She is not happy at all to find they have separate rooms and tries to change it for a room together. When Wyatt leaves, Ivy tells Hope that she knows she is still upset that she is along on the trip with Liam as she is not over him yet. Hope says she really does not want to go there again and does not want to hear Ivy's accusations. She just thinks Ivy ought to be a little more concerned. Ivy says from the start Hope said they should give Liam more time to get into a relationship, but how long is that going to take. Hope rails at her that yes it hurts. Yes she still has feelings for Liam and if that bothers Ivy then it's too damn bad. It's going to take more time."

        "Lars: I will make the arrangements to borrow my boat.",
        "Wyatt: Ah, fantastic. And maybe after work, when we're done with the photo shoot and everyone's chill, just -- it's got to be romantic. On the canal in that beauty?",
        "Lars: Oh, definitely, but not for you and Hope -- for Liam and Ivy, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yes. Yes. Liam's into Ivy. He just needs that extra little push. You know what I mean?",
        "Lars: So, you're playing cupid, huh?",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: I guess I am.",
        "Liam: Oh. Are you cold?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: A little -- little friction, little rubdown, yeah? How 'bout double speed?",
        "Wyatt: But look -- I don't want anyone to know about our arrangement, okay? Not even Hope.",
        "Lars: But what if Liam and Ivy ask about --",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no, no. Then it's your idea. It's a special Dutch welcome to celebrate Ivy and her new line, right?",
        "Lars: Okay. I got it.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks.",
        "Lars: See you later.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, man.",
        "Wyatt: Well, this'll do the trick. Bon voyage, bro.",
        "Deacon: So, what did Wyatt say when you told him he needed to take action?",
        "Quinn: Were you listening in to the tail end of my conversation?",
        "Deacon: Hey, I got a horse in this race, too. I just -- I want my daughter to be happy.",
        "Quinn: She is happy. My son makes her very happy.",
        "Deacon: Mm. And what about Liam? Because I know there is nothing you would like more than for Liam and Ivy to return from Amsterdam all hot and heavy.",
        "Quinn: That is true, but I don't believe that's going to happen. But if Wyatt can create the right ambiance, then maybe those two can get past the hand- holding stage.",
        "Deacon: You know what I think? I think you need to stay out of it. Just focus yourself on other things.",
        "Quinn: What if those other things involve taking a trip?",
        "Deacon: Do you want to get out of here?",
        "Quinn: Yeah! Why not?",
        "Deacon: Where?",
        "Quinn: Well, Europe is beautiful this time of year -- London, Berlin...",
        "Deacon: Amsterdam.",
        "Quinn: ...Amsterdam.",
        "Deacon: Stay away from the kids.",
        "Quinn: Or what?",
        "Deacon: I'm serious. Don't interfere.",
        "Quinn: Come on. Where's your sense of adventure? I'm gonna book us on the next flight. We're gonna be in Amsterdam --",
        "Deacon: This is a bad idea. You know what? If you need another reminder, I'm gonna show you something. Take a look at this. Huh?",
        "Quinn: Mm. Hmm. That's my grandbaby.",
        "[Bells ringing]",
        "Hope: Oh, my gosh! This looks great!",
        "Wyatt: Ah, nice.",
        "Hope: Oh, I love it.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Eva: Hope. Wyatt.",
        "Hope: Hi!",
        "Wyatt: Hi!",
        "Eva: Good to see you!",
        "Hope: Oh, my gosh! You, too! First paris, now Amsterdam? We keep meeting in these beautiful cities.",
        "Wyatt: And thank you for hooking us up with Lars. He's been setting up all the stuff on the ground for the photo shoot.",
        "Eva: Just doing my job.",
        "Hope: Uh, you guys -- you know Eva. She does international publicity for Forrester.",
        "Eva: You must be Ivy. I love your jewelry.",
        "Ivy: Oh, thank you! That's so nice! Thanks!",
        "Wyatt: And this is Ivy's traveling companion -- my brother, Liam, big wig at Spencer publications.",
        "Eva: Like I don't know Liam Spencer. It's a pleasure to finally meet you.",
        "Liam: Nice to meet you.",
        "Eva: Oh, and, uh, congratulations, Mr. And Mrs. Spencer.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Eva: You could have told me that you were running off to Monte Carlo to get married. Think of all of that publicity.",
        "Hope: Sorry. It was kind of, um, spur of the moment.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Eva: You're a very lucky man. Beautiful bride.",
        "Wyatt: Don't I know it?",
        "Hope: Uh, so, where's the Hope for the Future diamond?",
        "Eva: Arriving shortly. Getting ready to make its big debut here. Amsterdam has a long history of diamond trade and industry. The buzz surrounding the Hope for the Future diamond and Ivy's designs is really exciting.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. That's what we like to hear, huh?",
        "Eva: Hope for the Future has made a real impact on young women here. They loved what you did at the Trocadero gardens in front of the Eiffel tower.",
        "Hope: Good.",
        "Wyatt: Well, hopefully, we can do a lot more of that, 'cause this is a style shoot. All the close-ups of the jewelry will be done in studio, and this will be about glamour, beauty, sophistication, and everything that Hope represents as a spokesperson and lead model for the line.",
        "Eva: And Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Eva: This is a jewelry shoot. Everyone is asking, \"who is Ivy Forrester?\" It's time to put yourself out there. You need to get in front of the camera.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: Well, um -- [Clears throat] Sorry. Are -- are you suggesting that Ivy model, too?",
        "Eva: Absolutely.",
        "Deacon: Has anyone ever told you that you're your own worst enemy?",
        "Quinn: Has anyone ever told you to mind your own business?",
        "Deacon: You know what? Don't listen to me. Go ahead. Go to Amsterdam, all right? You're gonna completely screw up Hope and Wyatt's relationship, all right? I mean, she already thinks you're certifiable. Now you just pop up out of nowhere in amster--",
        "Quinn: Give me some credit. I'm not going there to interfere.",
        "Deacon: No, no. You're just gonna work your black arts from behind the scenes.",
        "Quinn: Liam needs to pull the trigger. Hope is lost to him forever, and, meanwhile, poison Ivy is there. She's ripe for the taking.",
        "Deacon: Okay, listen -- I get it. I understand why you want the two of them together. I even think it makes sense. But you're pushing too hard. And that's generally when things start to, you know, go south for you.",
        "Quinn: Can't expect me to just stand around and do nothing.",
        "Deacon: Honey, our kids are married now. I mean, they're starting a family of their own, right? Just because we're giving them some space, it doesn't mean that we're not gonna be there for them if they need us. You want Wyatt and Hope to have the best life possible, right?",
        "Quinn: Of course!",
        "Deacon: Okay, and you also obviously want to be a doting grandmother to the baby, right?",
        "Quinn: Obviously.",
        "Deacon: Okay. Then don't give them any reason to shut you out. Just play it smart. Come on. You know, let Hope come to you. Stay the hell away from Liam and Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Me?!",
        "Hope: You want Ivy to model?",
        "Eva: Yeah. There is a certain mystery surrounding Ivy, the Forrester who's eschewed the public spotlight until now.",
        "Ivy: Well, I wouldn't say I've exactly eschewed it. I mean, I have been designing jewelry for years. But you're right -- I have avoided the public spotlight, so...",
        "Eva: So, why not make the most of it? You and Hope, a Forrester and a Logan, working side by side for the good of the company.",
        "Liam: I will say this -- Spencer publications would be all over that.",
        "Eva: So, it's settled, then.",
        "Wyatt: Well, let's think about it and we'll get back to you, okay?",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Eva: Excuse me. The diamond just got here. I'll be back.",
        "Liam: Um...question for you about these over here. Um...are these -- are these actually the ones that you will be modeling?",
        "Ivy: Uh, yes.",
        "Wyatt: You are way too quiet, and I'm pretty sure I know why.",
        "Hope: I don't want Ivy modeling. I get that it could be really great publicity, but enough is enough. I don't want her moving in on my life anymore.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Eva: Let's put the diamond directly in the case. Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: Uh... Hope...",
        "Hope: You know how I feel. Ivy is stepping into my life, and it has to stop.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. What does that even mean, exactly -- \"Ivy's stepping into my life\"? Is it modeling or is it Forrester creations?",
        "Hope: Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Is that it?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Or are we talking about Liam, too?",
        "Ivy: Well, I'm pretty sure I know what that's about. She doesn't want me modeling. And maybe Hope's right. I mean, I-I haven't modeled before. Why would I choose one of the biggest photo shoots of the year to start learning?",
        "Liam: You are fantastic at everything you do. Give me your hands. Give me your hands. Give them to me. Give 'em. Come here.",
        "Ivy: Ooh. Oh, yeah.",
        "Liam: You know what I see? You know what I see?",
        "Ivy: Hmm?",
        "Liam: I see beauty. I see poise. I see class. And that's just me.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Liam: You have all those qualities and so much more.",
        "Ivy: You know what? I don't think Hope agrees. I mean, before we left for this trip, we spoke about making in tension-free, and, to be honest, I think she's having a tough time seeing you and me together.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well... oh.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Liam: Oh, shoot.",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Liam: Uh, I have a conference call, and I can't really take it here.",
        "Ivy: No, go. Go back to the hotel, take care of things, and I'll catch up with you later.",
        "Liam: Mm...you sure?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Yes, go. I'll -- I'll be fine.",
        "Deacon: Will you promise me that you're not gonna do anything impulsive?",
        "Quinn: Fine. I won't go to Amsterdam. Satisfied?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, if you stick to it. I mean, Wyatt is a grown man, all right? He can handle this, so let him. Trust me -- you're gonna score a lot more points with Hope this way.",
        "Eva: Thank you so much.",
        "Liam: You think that he gave you this diamond for the whole world to see for business? No. He did it because he believes that that diamond has a hold on you, Hope. Now you tell me -- does it?",
        "Hope: They shouldn't even be in Amsterdam together.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] It gets to you, doesn't it -- seeing them together? It's okay.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: It's how I used to feel seeing you and Liam together, okay?",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I-I don't want you to think that just because I'm talking about --",
        "Wyatt: Don't even worry about it, okay? I'm not jealous. Why would I be jealous? I have nothing to be jealous about. I'm not jealous. Okay? So... Ivy and the shoot -- what do you want to do?",
        "Hope: Mm. Um... it's -- it's not like I can say no. Then it's gonna look like I'm doing it out of spite.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Um...",
        "Ivy: Uh, Eva wants to ask us a few questions, Hope.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. Where's Liam?",
        "Ivy: He's on his way back to the hotel.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Maybe I should, uh, do the same, unless you need me to stick around for anything.",
        "Hope: No. No. That's okay. Bye.",
        "Ivy: Look, I-I think we both know why you're upset. You still can't let go of Liam, can you?",
        "[Water running in distance]",
        "Quinn: Hallo? [Clears throat] Hi. Do you speak English? Uh, yes. I'm checking in on my son and his wife -- Wyatt Spencer and Hope. Have they checked in to their room yet? Yes. Would you like me to connect you?",
        "Quinn: No, no. That's okay. I'm gonna let them settle in. Anything else?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. The couple that they're traveling with -- Liam Spencer and Ivy Forrester -- have they checked in to their room, as well? Mr. Spencer and ms. Forrester have separate rooms.",
        "Quinn: What? No. No, no, no. That's a mistake. They should be in the same room. No, ma'am.",
        "Quinn: Can I make that change for them? Uh [Chuckles] I'm afraid not. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Uh -- uh, wait. Wait a second. Wait a second. Sorry. Um, these bags -- these are my friend Ivy Forrester's. I think they belong in her room.",
        "Wyatt: Problem, bro?",
        "Liam: Uh, no, no. It's fine. It's just Ivy's bags got taken to my room. Can you handle this? Right away, sir.",
        "Liam: Oh, awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Um, I mean dank je wel. Bent u welkom.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Enjoy your stay.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: Huh.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Wyatt: Don't know. Nothing, I guess. It's just... did you ever wonder if fate is trying to tell you something?",
        "Eva: No, no. Tell Shaun to meet me in dam square. No, in an hour. Can -- I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second? I'm so sorry, ladies. I have to deal with this.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eva: Yes. We have to do the location set today.",
        "Hope: I really don't want to go here again.",
        "Ivy: Oh, well, you're not exactly denying it.",
        "Hope: I -- [Chuckles] No, I-I-I did when you accused me of not being honest with myself.",
        "Ivy: Hope, that wasn't an accusation. I have eyes. I can see that you're struggling with this.",
        "Hope: I'm not...struggling. I just think that you could be a little more considerate.",
        "Ivy: How? How, Hope -- by not flaunting my relationship with Liam in front of you? Because I don't feel like I'm doing that. From the very start, you have said it's too soon for Liam and I to get into a relationship. But how long is this gonna go on for? When are you eventually gonna let him go?",
        "Hope: I am. I am doing that. I'm married, and I'm pregnant.",
        "Ivy: Yes, exactly, but it still obviously bothers you, seeing us together, so that just leads me to believe that you still have feelings for him --",
        "Hope: Of course, I do! Of course, I do, Ivy. What do you want me to say? It hurts. It hurts seeing the two of you together, okay? Yes, I want Liam to be happy. Yes, I want what is best for him. But it takes...time. It's going to take some time to get over what we had, and if I am not doing that fast enough for you, well, that's just -- that's too damn bad."
