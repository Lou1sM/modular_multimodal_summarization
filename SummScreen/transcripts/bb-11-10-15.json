    "Recap": [
        "Maya fixes Nicole a healthy breakfast even if she is pregnant or not. She thinks she has the kindest sister in the world. She can even stay home and take it easy. Nicole says no, she'd like to go to work and spend some time with Zende. Eric and Brooke discuss it with Zende and he says he is going in to work to support Nicole. Eric tells Maya and Rick all is going to be fine. From what he just heard Zende is completely devoted to Nicole. Zende welcomes Nicole and asks if she feels any differently. He has missed her like crazy and thinks about her all the time. During a quick meeting Liam tells Ridge that he is tired of Thomas's insults bringing up the Spencer brothers. But Caroline is getting fat so suddenly Thomas does not seem so important. Ridge tells Caroline this is their baby and it does not matter what Thomas might suspect. And they don't have to worry what Brooke knows either. She thinks he had the vasectomy reversed.",
        "Brooke ends up working with Liam as he is on computer. He jokes that he sees she has been researching vasectomies. And then he mentions Ridge and sees that frozen look on her face. She laments that she shouldn't say anything and it does not matter any more but ..when Ridge was in Paris he had a mastectomy. He had it reversed as he did not want to disappoint Caroline. He had the procedure and it took and Caroline is now pregnant. So it turned out the way it was supposed to be. Zende tells Nicole that all he knows is he wants her right now and they can't. Rick tells Maya that Zende is a good guy. He made a commitment and he will honor it. Maya catches Nicole kissing Zende in a darkened photo room and steps back. Liam walks in as Caroline is looking at her ultrasound picture and questions her. He is very happy now that he knows how it took her and Ridge a ways to get here. He found out her secret today. She says perhaps he should just come out and say what he is referring to. He mentions the vasectomy and that at some point she was not sure Ridge could be the father. Caroline is stunned."

        "Nicole: What is this?",
        "Maya: It is a healthy breakfast.",
        "Nicole: We don't even know if I'm pregnant yet.",
        "Maya: Just the fact that you could be.",
        "Nicole: We did it.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Your baby could be growing inside of me right now.",
        "Rick: You'll never know just how grateful we are.",
        "Nicole: Oh, I-I do. You're always telling me that I'm doing such a wonderful thing for you. But to help you have a child is -- is huge for me, too. I am so honored to carry your baby.",
        "Maya: Well, I have the kindest, most loving sister in the whole world. And she's all mine.",
        "Rick: The three of us, bonded forever.",
        "Nicole: Soon to be four.",
        "Rick: We should head in.",
        "Maya: Oh, okay.",
        "Nicole: Oh, I'm right behind you.",
        "Maya: Are you sure you don't want to stay home, maybe rest up, take it easy?",
        "Nicole: No, I think it's best to stay busy until the upcoming appointment.",
        "Maya: Yeah, I'm about to jump out of my skin.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] Besides, I want to spend some time with Zende.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Any word?",
        "Zende: No, not yet.",
        "Eric: Must be kind of nerve-wracking waiting around for these results of this procedure.",
        "Brooke: It's quite an amazing situation.",
        "Zende: You're telling me.",
        "Brooke: Not all that you bargained for?",
        "Zende: I certainly wasn't expecting Nicole to carry Rick and Maya's child, but what can you do? She's determined to help her sister. So I'm gonna go with it and support her.",
        "Brooke: You're an extraordinary young man. She's lucky to have you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Well, you're right. It's a good catch, Liam. Well done.",
        "Liam: Yeah, no problem.",
        "Ridge: Is there something else?",
        "Liam: Yeah, actually. Uh, okay, you know I respect Thomas as a designer, but the whole attitude thing is getting real old.",
        "Ridge: Attitude about what?",
        "Liam: Oh, I don't know. The barely submerged hostility towards Wyatt and me just for being Spencers. We've contributed a whole lot to this company, and for Thomas to insinuate otherwise is, frankly, insulting.",
        "Ridge: Okay, I know. But Thomas is not the one you need to impress. The guy you have to impress already is impressed with you and Wyatt. Plus you guys are this one's cousin, so you're family. Doesn't matter what Thomas thinks.",
        "Liam: Okay, all right. On to the good stuff. How's the pregnancy?",
        "Caroline: It's amazing. It's kind of like the best thing that's ever happened to me, besides this one.",
        "Liam: Can I see? Can I?",
        "Caroline: Yes. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Ahh. You are fat.",
        "Caroline: I -- [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: Well, yes, she's --",
        "Caroline: A little. I actually, uh, wish I was fatter. I want to be the size of this whole room. I just want a giant --",
        "Ridge: I don't want that -- no, I do. Yeah. [Laughter]",
        "Caroline: 'Cause you know what? I love everything about carrying our baby.",
        "Ridge: Yeah?",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: How about morning sickness? You like that, too?",
        "Caroline: I do, actually. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Suddenly worrying about Thomas doesn't seem so important.",
        "Ridge: No, it doesn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Hey. Any news?",
        "Maya: No, not until our next appointment.",
        "Eric: Well, use this time to be alone together, because once she delivers that baby, your lives will be changed permanently.",
        "[All chuckling]",
        "Maya: You know what I say?",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Maya: Bring it on.",
        "Rick: We're ready for this.",
        "Eric: You're gonna be terrific parents, the two of you. I can't wait to see you grow into this whole phase in your lives.",
        "Rick: We really appreciate all the support, Dad.",
        "Maya: Yeah, it hasn't come from all directions.",
        "Eric: Your mom and dad, you mean.",
        "Maya: \"Serious reservations\" would be putting it mildly. Bottom line -- I just, I want the surrogacy to go as easily for her as possible, especially around Nicole's personal life. I mean, Zende is amazing, but for him to stand by her and still be there on the other side?",
        "Eric: Well, from what I just heard, I think everything's gonna be just fine. That young man is completely devoted to your sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: [Sighs] [Sighs] [Clears throat]",
        "Nicole: Guess who.",
        "Zende: Um, Charlotte?",
        "Nicole: No.",
        "Zende: Uh, Sarah.",
        "Nicole: Better not be.",
        "Zende: Oh. Quinn.",
        "Nicole: Quinn?",
        "Zende: Hey, hey. Missed you like crazy.",
        "Nicole: You just saw me last night.",
        "Zende: Yeah, I know, but it wasn't enough time. You know, it wasn't enough... this. You know, I think about you all the time. I can't get you out of my head. So, uh, how you doing? Do you feel any different?",
        "Nicole: The same.",
        "Zende: But you could be pregnant, like, right this second. I still can't believe you actually went through with the procedure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Well, Liam is gonna make a fabulous big cousin. And Wyatt, too.",
        "Ridge: And maybe between the two of them, they can make Bill a little happier.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] I don't know why, but uncle Bill's always going to be crabby when it comes to you. But let me tell you something. Bill Spencer loves babies, and he's gonna love this baby even if it is yours.",
        "Ridge: I like how you said that.",
        "Caroline: It is. You're the only father that this kid will know. I think it's still bothering me, you know, like we go to have our first sonogram and then... I look up and I see Thomas. And it made me feel scared, you know, like somehow he was putting all the pieces together and figuring everything out, and...",
        "Ridge: Hey, hey, hey. It doesn't matter what Thomas thinks or Thomas suspects. We stick together on this, and the world's gonna know this is our baby. [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You need to take the computer with you?",
        "Liam: Uh, no, no, no. I can fix it here, unless am I in your way?",
        "Brooke: Oh, gosh, no. It's fine. We can catch up.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I-I just came from, uh, Ridge and Caroline. They're all giddy about the baby.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] It's an exciting time for them.",
        "Liam: Yeah. It's nice to see Caroline happy. I think the breakup with Rick really shattered her for a while there.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I remember.",
        "Liam: I think it just takes a minute to bounce back, although I didn't suspect she'd ever end up with Ridge. That was -- that was weird. Hey, um, I'm gonna need to delete some of your cookies and browser history. Is that okay?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, that's not a problem. Whatever you need to do.",
        "Liam: Oh, well, look who's been researching vasectomies. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: I'm just...I'm blown away.",
        "Nicole: Freaks me out a little, too [Chuckles] When I stop and think about it.",
        "Zende: You sorry you did the procedure?",
        "Nicole: No. I want to help Rick and Maya have a child. What?",
        "Zende: You. You check all the boxes. You're beautiful and smart, kind of funny, sexy, and you're about to give Rick and Maya the baby that they never thought they could have. It takes a special kind of person to do that.",
        "Nicole: But you wish I wouldn't.",
        "Zende: Doesn't matter. You're doing this crazy-generous thing. I admire you for that. I just want you to know that.",
        "Nicole: Thank you for not bailing. This roller coaster ride won't be half as scary if you're riding it with me.",
        "Zende: I'm all yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: That is one good-looking kid.",
        "Caroline: Right? Are you sure that you're okay with not finding out the sex? 'Cause I'm -- I think maybe I might not be okay with it.",
        "Ridge: I'm -- I'm okay either way. I mean, I'd be partial to another little princess running around that looks like her mommy.",
        "Caroline: Might be better that way.",
        "Ridge: Come on. Don't worry about that. It's gonna be fine.",
        "Caroline: Except for eagle-eyed Brooke, who already knows so much.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Well, Brooke knows that I had a vasectomy, there were some complications, we had it reversed, and then bam, you got pregnant.",
        "Caroline: Okay. All right. [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: It's your journey. It's your first kid growing inside of you. I want you to enjoy it.",
        "Caroline: Yeah. Can you imagine just, like, in a few months, our baby's gonna be here with us?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I know.",
        "Caroline: And you're gonna be there, right? In the delivery room?",
        "Ridge: I would like to see the man who's gonna stop me from being there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Well, this is a bit awkward.",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Did you, uh, find the answers you were looking for?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Liam: Are you considering a career change?",
        "Brooke: Hardly.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I know what it is. No, you -- you're mad at a guy, right?",
        "Brooke: Ha ha.",
        "Liam: Like you and Ridge. You got into a fight and he set you off, and so you went online to get out your aggression with a little revenge fantasy. Am I right? I'm -- I'm kid-- Brooke, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding. You don't have to look at me like that.",
        "Brooke: Well, I'm not looking any particular way.",
        "Liam: Well, you can't see it, but I can, and, I mean, we were just talking about vasectomies, right, and then I bring up Ridge and your face totally froze, like I hit the nail on the head, which makes no sense because Caroline's pregnant, so...",
        "Brooke: Let's just drop it, okay?",
        "Liam: I -- yeah, I would, but Caroline's my cousin, you know?",
        "Brooke: I'm not supposed to say anything. I don't even know what it matters anymore because the end result is just fine.",
        "Liam: Yeah, so...",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] So... when Ridge was in Paris, he had a vasectomy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: Does it bother you that I worry?",
        "Ridge: You know what's weird?",
        "Caroline: Hmm?",
        "Ridge: Not a single thing about you bothers me.",
        "Caroline: You know, there's a reason.",
        "Ridge: All right. Tell me.",
        "Caroline: It's just I... I never could have imagined my life like this, you know? Just being this happy and feeling this fulfilled. And so I don't want that to change. And the idea that it could kind of terrifies me.",
        "Ridge: Maybe you should take that idea and throw it out of your head, 'cause we got this. You and me.",
        "Caroline: Is it corny if I say \"and baby makes three\"?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Yeah, that's awful.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Wait a second. Ridge had a vasectomy back in Paris?",
        "Brooke: Yes. But then he had it reversed.",
        "Liam: But Caroline wanted a family all along. I mean, if she knew that was impossible, why --",
        "Brooke: Oh, but she didn't know. See, Ridge didn't want to disappoint her, so he thought he would go ahead and fix the problem and then tell her after the fact. But then the doctor said he had a condition and he might not be able to have kids even if he had a reversal.",
        "Liam: But -- well, then how -- how --",
        "Brooke: Oh, he just went ahead with it anyway. He figured what did he have to lose, right? It's a good thing he did because look. I mean, [Chuckles] It took, so...",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Caroline is happily pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: This feels so good.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] I could stay in your arms all day.",
        "Zende: I want more than this.",
        "Nicole: Me, too. [Chuckles] When we're not together, I can't stop thinking about the next time. And I know you're wondering if things will change once I'm pregnant. The answer is no. We get the final say, and we won't let it.",
        "Zende: This is killing me, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: Hey, once I'm officially pregnant, then...",
        "Zende: Okay, so what are we supposed to do with all these feelings?",
        "Nicole: We're creative. We'll think of something. Unless...",
        "Zende: No. No \"unless.\"",
        "Nicole: Well, will you still want me, touch me, and kiss me like this?",
        "Zende: You may not want me, too.",
        "Nicole: Impossible.",
        "Zende: Look, there's no way to predict how either of us will react once the baby's inside. All I know is, I want you right now. Like, right now.",
        "Nicole: Me, too.",
        "Zende: Hmm. We can do better.",
        "Nicole: I doubt it.",
        "Zende: Yeah. Hold on. Uh... see? Better.",
        "Nicole: Genius.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Ooh, what do you got there?",
        "Caroline: Come and see. It's baby's first close-up!",
        "Liam: Oh, my God! You're packing kid!",
        "Caroline: I am.",
        "Liam: Oh!",
        "Caroline: It's our little miracle baby.",
        "Liam: You know what? I'm only just now starting to realize what a miracle this baby really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Maya: This is such uncharted territory for all of us. I mean, who knows how carrying that baby will affect Zende and Nicole's relationship?",
        "Rick: He's one of the good guys. He made a commitment. He'll honor it.",
        "Maya: You're right. You're right.",
        "Rick: What else did you expect?",
        "Maya: Well, I got to get to that photo shoot.",
        "Rick: Yeah, you better get on out of here.",
        "Maya: Thanks.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] I love you.",
        "Zende: I love you, too. I want you so bad.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] I've never felt like this before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Of course the baby's a miracle. They all are.",
        "Liam: Well, okay, yeah, but Ridge was really straightforward with you about not wanting another family.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, and thankfully he changed his mind.",
        "Liam: Caroline, you know I care about you, right?",
        "Caroline: Yes. We're cousins. We're family. You have to.",
        "Liam: It goes deeper than obligation, and you know that.",
        "Caroline: Oh. I feel the same way about you.",
        "Liam: Okay. You're happy, right? You finally have the baby you've always wanted, and I couldn't be more ecstatic for you. But especially... now that I know what it took for you and Ridge to get here.",
        "Caroline: What do you mean?",
        "Liam: I learned a-a secret today that you and Ridge have been keeping.",
        "Caroline: What secret?",
        "Liam: Oh, my God. Caroline, really? You have so many, you don't remember?",
        "Caroline: Liam, why don't you just tell me what it is that you think that you know?",
        "Liam: Ridge had a vasectomy in Paris?",
        "Caroline: Where did that come from?",
        "Liam: Where did it come from? It's true, isn't it? It's true. There was a moment there where you didn't know if Ridge could be the father of your child."
