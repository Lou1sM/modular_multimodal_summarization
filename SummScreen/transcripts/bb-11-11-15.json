        "Liam keeps hammering Caroline that he is not trying to pry but something is up with Ridge. He knows he is right. She is not sure what he wants her to say and thinks it weird that he is even asking. Liam excuses it by saying they are family, they tell each other everything. He knows Ridge had a vasectomy and a condition and now a baby coming so it's like a small miracle. Caroline says she and Ridge are not hiding anything and the vasectomy is personal and nobody else's business. Liam reiterates again that Ridge did not tell Caroline at the time so he knows it must have been a shock to learn that. Ridge drops in on Thomas and Thomas asks for his help with a design. Ridge tells him to just lose the pleat. Thomas says he sees it is pretty obvious that Ridge is still angry with him. He says he is sorry that he might have ruined the moment when he saw them at Caroline's first ultrasound. Curtly, Ridge says he explained himself already the way he always does.",
        "Brooke walks in and realizes Thomas saw the ultrasound. She says it is amazing that there is a baby on the way as it took them all by surprise. Ridge quickly changes the subject back to the designs. Liam tells Caroline that he is probably making this out to be more than it is. Everything turned out all right so all is good. He's happy for her and knows she will make a great mom. Nicole and Zende slip off to themselves in the photo shoot room and exchange kisses. Maya spies them and finally comes out of the shadows. She addresses Zende and says what a good guy he is and though Nicole is trying to give them a baby it should not come at the expense of their relationship. She wants everyone to be okay with this. Nicole says Zende knows how special he is to her. Caroline confides in Ridge that Liam knows about his vasectomy so he should be freaking about now. Ridge says unless he knows about that night then he knows nothing so Caroline just needs to calm down. Caroline says Brooke must have told him so Ridge says he will text her. Their secret is safe. Brooke goes to Ridge's office and he tells her to close the door. He thought he made it clear that his procedures were nobody else's business and to be kept private. It wasn't up to her to share it with anybody. Nicole tells Maya that she doesn't have to keep thanking her for this precious gift. They hug and say they love each other. Maya says that will be even if they do not get the answer they want with this."

        "Liam: I'm right, though, aren't I, about Ridge?",
        "Caroline: Liam, what -- what's happening right now? What is with all the questions?",
        "Liam: I'm not -- I'm not trying to pry. I know it's between you and Ridge, but when you show me a sonogram like that, I can't help thinking it is pretty amazing, considering...",
        "Caroline: I-I don't know what you want me to say. I think it's weird that you're even asking me.",
        "Liam: What are you even doing right now acting all offended that I'm asking? I mean, we're cousins. We're family. We tell each other everything anyway. Look, Ridge had a vasectomy. Correct? But he also has this... condition. Okay. I'm gonna take that as a yes. Which means that it is kind of a small miracle that you're having this child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Oh, Dad. Good. Glad you're here. Um... wanted to run a few things by you. I've been sketching the bodice on this dress for...honestly, longer than I care to admit. I just can't seem to -- to get everything to drape right. You, uh -- you got any ideas about that?",
        "Ridge: Too much fabric. Lose the pleats.",
        "Thomas: Okay. Cool. Ah. I'll, uh -- I'll revise and take another swing at it.",
        "Ridge: Good.",
        "Thomas: Dad, look, um... there's been a lot of tension between us. It's pretty obvious you're still really angry with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Uh...we're gonna get in trouble.",
        "Zende: Nobody's around.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] No, I mean, us. We're -- we're gonna get ourselves in trouble.",
        "Zende: Okay. Is that really such a bad thing?",
        "Nicole: Right now, yeah, it is.",
        "Zende: I just want to be normal -- a normal couple just like everyone else our age.",
        "Nicole: Nothing about this is normal. But it will be after I have the baby.",
        "Zende: I just feel like our life is on hold.",
        "Nicole: In some ways, it is. But...it's all worth it to me. Being able to give my sister and Rick such a beautiful gift -- I wouldn't trade it for the world.",
        "Zende: I get it. And even though I-I want you so bad I can hardly stand it... I admire you. What you're giving your sister is beyond generous and completely selfless. I admire you for what you're doing, Nicole.",
        "Maya: I do, too.",
        "Nicole: Um... [Chuckles] Maya, what -- what are you doing here?",
        "Maya: I'm sorry. I-I wasn't eavesdropping. I just -- I walked in, and I accidentally overheard.",
        "Nicole: Sure you did.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] What you said, Nicole -- I appreciate every word. More than you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Look, what happened the other day at -- at the doctor's office- you know, that was Caroline's first ultrasound, and I'm sorry. I-I felt like I kind of ruined a moment that should have been with you and her.",
        "Ridge: It's okay. You explained yourself. You always do.",
        "Thomas: You know, looking at that monitor, though... that was -- that was pretty crazy, sing what would one day be my little brother or sister.",
        "Brooke: You got to see the baby?",
        "Ridge: He uh...yes. My wife had a sonogram.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, yeah. No, I-I just happened to be, um, getting a physical on the same floor. So... it's crazy, though, hearing that little heart beat.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, it's amazing to think there's a little baby on the way. I mean, the news took us all by surprise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Who are you even talking to?",
        "Liam: All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm clearly crossing some kind of line. Forget I-I brought it up.",
        "Caroline: Okay. Ridge and I are not hiding anything. Yes, it is personal, and it's really nobody else's business but Ridge's and mine.",
        "Liam: I know.",
        "Caroline: But, yeah, he did. He had a vasectomy when he was in Paris. And that was a long time before he and I were ever involved. So...",
        "Liam: Okay. But he -- but he didn't tell you that.",
        "Caroline: No. Not at first. He didn't think it was gonna be an issue.",
        "Liam: Right. Until he realized how important it was for you to have a family. See, that's all -- that's all I'm saying, Caroline. It -- it must have been a shock to learn that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: You might be the only person that feels that way.",
        "Brooke: About...?",
        "Thomas: Caroline's pregnancy. Why -- why would it be that big of a shock? I mean, she's always wanted kids. I mean, dad wasn't on board at first, but now he is. They're -- they're committed. They're married. Why would them having a kid be that big --",
        "Ridge: Brooke clearly thinks I'm too old to have another kid.",
        "Thomas: That's -- it's all a state of mind, though.",
        "Ridge: You said you had something else for me to look at. What is it?",
        "Thomas: Oh. Yeah, yeah. Right. Uh...it's just these two. Right here. So, you know, I'm trying.",
        "Ridge: You're on the right track.",
        "Thomas: Thanks. Hey, Dad. Again, about the ultrasound, I'm -- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there. That should have been a private moment between the parents.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. No, I'm not gonna be able to look at it tonight, but in the meantime, just, uh, do me a favor and shoot Katie the draft. Right. No, she'll be there.",
        "Caroline: Why are you here?",
        "Thomas: I-I wouldn't do that to you.",
        "Caroline: No. Don't touch me!",
        "Ridge: I had a vasectomy.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Ridge: I can't be the father to your kid.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Sorry about that. Anyway, you know, I'm probably making a bigger deal out of it than it is. I just -- I just thought you must have been taken aback when Ridge finally told you.",
        "Caroline: It wasn't something I expected to hear.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I can imagine. But, hey, you know, he got the vasectomy reversed, which, uh -- which apparently is a pretty common procedure.",
        "Caroline: Yep.",
        "Liam: So, uh... everything's good. It all worked out for the best.",
        "Caroline: It sure did.",
        "Liam: Well, I've -- I've said it before and I'll say it again. I couldn't be more excited for you, and I know you're gonna be a great mom.",
        "Caroline: Aww. Thank you, cousin.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: At the risk of embarrassing my sister, I need to say something.",
        "Nicole: Oh, no.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] You're a really good guy, Zende. Having your support through all of this makes the entire experience so much easier for Nicole. And knowing that you're in her life takes a huge weight off of my shoulders. Because she's what matters. And having a baby would be wonderful and I pray it happens, but not at the expense of my sister. And I hope you know how much she cares about you and how important you are to her life, to all of our lives.",
        "Nicole: He knows how special he is.",
        "Maya: 'Cause I love you guys. And I don't want you to give away your happiness for Rick and me. I want everyone to be okay with this, truly okay.",
        "Zende: Thanks for looking out.",
        "Nicole: We're good. Don't worry about us.",
        "Maya: Oh, I can't help that. [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: Uh, I should let you ladies have some sister time. I'm gonna go. Text me later?",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm.",
        "Zende: Okay. Bye.",
        "Maya: Bye. Well, you two are pretty darn cute.",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm. Spill it.",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Nicole: How much did you actually hear, you know, when you were getting your spy game on earlier?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: So, guess what I just saw. Caroline's ultrasound. Pretty exciting.",
        "Brooke: Apparently, Thomas was there when it was taken.",
        "Thomas: By accident. My doctor's appointment was just down the hall.",
        "Brooke: So, you just happen to find yourself in their exam room?",
        "Thomas: Oh, trust me. It was -- it was awkward. Yeah, especially since Dad and I haven't been on great terms for the past few weeks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Oh, there she is -- the beautiful mother of my unborn child. Hi.",
        "Caroline: Hi.",
        "Ridge: What's wrong?",
        "Caroline: Liam knows.",
        "Ridge: Liam knows what?",
        "Caroline: He knows that you got a vasectomy. He knows our secret, Ridge. How are you not freaking out right now?",
        "Ridge: Because I'm not sure exactly what it is that you're saying. He -- he knows everything? He knows that? What's he know?",
        "Caroline: No, no. [Sighs] But he just -- he kept going on and on about how shocked I must have been and -- and how what a big surprise that must have been for me and --",
        "Ridge: Okay, how is any of this his business?",
        "Caroline: I think he's just trying to be supportive. I don't know. But he was being very pushy, so I had to admit that it was true.",
        "Ridge: He was pushy? What? He already knew this? He came in with this information?",
        "Caroline: Yes. And then he just assumed that you got a reversal, and then he said, you know, he was happy for us.",
        "Ridge: So, he's happy. So, he's no suspicious of anything else.",
        "Caroline: Not that I know of. Not right now. But...",
        "Ridge: Why are you doing that? Don't do it. We're good. Just calm do-- can you calm down? Is that okay?",
        "Caroline: It was Brooke. Brooke had to have told him, 'cause how else would he have found out? What are we gonna do?",
        "Ridge: I'm -- I'm -- I will text her and have a word with her.",
        "Caroline: I'm just feeling really scared. I just -- everything feels like it's a bad sign right now -- seeing Thomas at the sonogram and now Liam finding out about your procedure -- and I am feeling just really vulnerable and very scared.",
        "Ridge: Can you take a breath?",
        "Caroline: [Exhales]",
        "Ridge: Everything's gonna be okay. We've got this. Our secret's safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: It's not what I heard, per se. More like what I saw.",
        "Nicole: Oh, my God. How long were you standing there?",
        "Maya: Probably longer than you would have liked.",
        "Nicole: Okay!",
        "Maya: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I swear I was -- I was coming down to prep for a photo shoot. I had no idea you and Zende were in here. And you have no reason to be embarrassed. You weren't doing anything wrong. There's no reason to be ashamed.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] Luckily, we knew when to put the brakes on.",
        "Maya: Well, it can't be easy. Look, you and Zende are adults. You're in a committed relationship. You're very attracted to each other. Of course, you're gonna want to express your feelings and take your relationship to the next level.",
        "Nicole: Wow. You are so ready to be a mom. [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: Do I sound like one? [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Yes. But not like our mom. She would be driving me to the convent right now.",
        "Maya: After what I just heard? [Chuckles] You better believe it.",
        "Nicole: Girl, please. It was not that bad. Could have been worse.",
        "Maya: Okay, mm. Um, [Chuckles] No, but really, I-I get it. You're having to push down all of these feelings and emotions and put them on the back burner because of this sacrifice you're making... because of this precious gift that you're giving Rick and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Uh, I think it would be awesome to be there for Caroline's ultrasound. Why is that awkward?",
        "Thomas: Uh, you wouldn't get it, man.",
        "Liam: Right. Yeah. I wouldn't get it. 'Cause I'm a Spencer, and Spencers are dim, and we're the enemy, and we can't be trusted and...",
        "Thomas: You're still whining about that meeting?",
        "Liam: Well, you said some pretty pointed things, Thomas. Don't forget -- your sister is dating a Spencer. Ivy is practically living with a Spencer.",
        "Thomas: Look, all I said is that you and Wyatt have gotten a little too comfortable here. I don't want that affecting your ability to do your job. You got one foot over here and one foot back at Spencer. All right? Not to mention the conflict of interest.",
        "Liam: I know, Thomas. You've mentioned that a few times now.",
        "Thomas: Good. I'll get back to work, then.",
        "Liam: Do you understand that Caroline is a Spencer, too? You get that, right? Your father's wife, future mother of your little brother or sister -- I mean, she's just as much a Spencer as Wyatt and me.",
        "Thomas: No. She's different. She's nothing like you or your brother.",
        "Liam: [Laughing] Okay. Okay. Right. Because if she were, you wouldn't have dated her back in the day? Are you sure that's not what this is about? That's not the reason you and your dad have been butting heads?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Brooke: I got your text. What did you want to see me about?",
        "Ridge: Close the door, please. I thought I made myself clear. My surgery and everything surrounding it is private. It wasn't up to you to share that with anybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: You don't have to keep thanking me. [Chuckles] I mean, what woman wouldn't want to do this for her sister? All that you've been through and how you've shown so much strength and perseverance and kindness and patience. No one deserves this more than you.",
        "Maya: And you will be the most wonderful auntie in the whole world.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Nicole: I can't wait.",
        "Maya: Well, it won't be long until we go back to that doctor. Hopefully, she'll tell us we're pregnant.",
        "Nicole: And the journey begins.",
        "Maya: Yeah. But even if we don't get the answer that we're hoping for, the fact that you were willing to do this is... Nicole, I love you so much. And I am proud of who you are.",
        "Nicole: I love you, too."
