    "Recap": [
        "Before a meeting, Ridge tells a worried Caroline that he talked to Liam about his vasectomy and had it reversed .now a baby on way so no story. Liam comes in and sees they are alone. Ridge says yes he wanted to be sure that Liam understood what he said the other day. He doesn't want people to gossip or the press to hear about it just yet. Liam looks a bit puzzled but says he gets it, no more from him. Julius tells Vivienne that he tossed and turned all night and got no sleep. This is just not right if Nicole has Rick's baby in her belly. Father Knows Best never worked on Maya but it used to with Nicole. He's been praying that she is not pregnant while Vivienne says she prayed that Nicole will have the strength to get through this. He says she is right, they are their flesh and blood and they have to love them. He's going to look out for both of them. Rick offers Nicole herbal tea to calm her and Maya says the doctor confirmed their appointment. They may know today if she is pregnant or not.",
        "Steffy wonders why her dad is changing the subject of the meeting. He says the designs are not quite ready, he did not sign off on them. Liam surprises them by talking about an article on Eye On Fashion about Caroline and Ridge. Steffy says it is about him expecting a family and how he is looking forward to it. Ridge is not a happy camper and says it is a problem with the press since he did not know about it. Thomas speaks up and says it caught a lot off guard but it is news. He just wishes they would all ease up and he'd like to know more about his designs ..why Ridge is not okaying them. Okay he will make some changes but one thing for sure Ridge knows how to crank out babies. He stays behind after the meeting and tells Ridge that he will work on the designs but he'd like to say again that he is not sure where all this anger is coming from. He admits he messed up and disrespected Ridge and he is sorry for that. Caroline speaks up and says Ridge knows that and it does not have to be discussed again. Thomas adds that he wants to be family again and not adversaries. When that little baby comes into the world he wants to be part of that life. He wants peace between all of them. Steffy tells Liam there is nothing wrong between Ridge and Thomas other than a clash of the Titans. Ridge reminds Caroline that everyone wants peace so that is not unusual for Thomas. She wonders what would happen if Thomas knew the truth. Ridge says there would be a scandal. Thomas would suffer and the one the most would be the baby as his friends, family, playground, school would follow him or her everywhere. Nicole is nervous but Dr. March says they will put a rush on the blood work so it won't be long before they know the results. Nicole tells Maya that she hopes and prays that today is the start of making her baby."

        "Ridge: There's nothing for you to be concerned about.",
        "Caroline: But I know my cousin.",
        "Ridge: So do I. I talked to him. I told him about the vasectomy and that I had it reversed and now -- now you're having a baby, so there's no story.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, but if he mentions it -- just even mentions it.",
        "Ridge: He won't. He won't mention it. I talked to him about it.",
        "Liam: Thought we had a meeting.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Just wanted to see you, uh, before we got started.",
        "Liam: Oh. Why?",
        "Ridge: I wanted to make sure you heard me the other day when I talked you about the things that Brooke told you.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Ridge, I --",
        "Ridge: Because I don't want people to gossip about it. I don't want the press to hear about it. We don't need that right now.",
        "Liam: I promise you. I got it.",
        "Ridge: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivienne: You were tossing and turning all night.",
        "Julius: Yeah, I won't rest until this mess is settled.",
        "Vivienne: Our daughter might be pregnant already.",
        "Julius: Please don't say that. It's not natural, Viv. Now, listen, I ain't got nothing against surrogacy. But not with Nicole. She's too young. And God help us if she's got Rick's baby in her belly. Our child's life would never be the same.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Herbal tea helps to settle the stomach.",
        "Nicole: My stomach's fine.",
        "Maya: Tired?",
        "Nicole: [Chuckling] I'm always tired in the morning. You know that.",
        "Maya: Any more tired than usual? It -- it's just -- it's an early sign of conception.",
        "Nicole: Oh. You know, now that you mention it... [Chuckles] I'm just kidding. [Laughs] But I would love some rocky road ice cream if you have any.",
        "Maya: Oh.",
        "Rick: I'll go out and get it.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] No, I'm just kidding. You guys are so sweet.",
        "Rick: What we're doing for you doesn't even compare to what you're doing for us.",
        "Nicole: I haven't done anything yet. Not until there's a baby growing inside of me.",
        "Maya: I can't believe we're gonna find out today. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: It's been hard enough dealing with Maya's transition, but now what she's doing to Nicole --- it's just wrong.",
        "Vivienne: They're adults.",
        "Julius: All the more reason. Nicole is vulnerable. I mean, she would do anything for Maya. And her sister knows that. I've been praying, Viv.",
        "Vivienne: So have I. I'm praying that Nicole will find the strength to get through this.",
        "Julius: No. I'm praying that she doesn't get pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: So, what do you think?",
        "Rick: A one in six chance? I think I'll take those odds.",
        "Nicole: Well, I want this, Rick. I really want this to happen for you two.",
        "Rick: I wasn't sure at first.",
        "Nicole: I wasn't either, but now I'm all in.",
        "Maya: That was Dr. March's office confirming the appointment.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] I'm nervous.",
        "Maya: Don't be. I am enough for all of us.",
        "[Both chuckling]",
        "Maya: We'll know pretty soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: You're changing the schedule?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Can I ask why?",
        "Ridge: I'm pulling some of Thomas' designs.",
        "Thomas: Wait. Which ones?",
        "Ridge: The cocktail dresses.",
        "Thomas: Caroline said that those were good to go.",
        "Ridge: Well, they're not. They're not finished.",
        "Thomas: Did you know about this, Caroline?",
        "Caroline: Thomas...",
        "Thomas: No, look, I'm just trying to figure it out. Because you guys both signed off on this.",
        "Ridge: I didn't sign off on anything.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: Thomas, just fix the designs. And, Liam, what's -- what's going on with the article?",
        "Liam: Um... yeah, it's, uh -- it should be on the web today and then on --",
        "Ridge: Wait, wait, wait. What? What article?",
        "Thomas: It's Eye on Fashion. It's about you and Caroline.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, the baby you're expecting, how much you're looking forward to being a father again. It's not the end of the world but it might feel like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: \"Father knows best\" never worked for Maya. But Nicole -- she used to listen to me.",
        "Vivienne: They've grown up, Julius.",
        "Julius: I'm looking out for them -- not just Nicole -- Maya, too. Yes, she's a little older, a little bit more experienced. I mean, she's lived on the street. She's got to know that this is not right for her sister.",
        "Vivienne: Honey, I don't think she does. I mean, not the way those two feel about each other. They really believe that they can conquer the world, that there's nothing they can't do. Come on. We got to love them for that.",
        "[Both chuckling]",
        "Vivienne: Look, you got to understand -- they don't see any limitations, no boundaries, because they love each other that much -- as much as we love them.",
        "Julius: You're right. They're our flesh and blood, and we got to -- we got to love them.",
        "Vivienne: Mm-hmm.",
        "Julius: I'm gonna look out for them. Both of them.",

        "Nicole: Kale salad, yogurt, yum.",
        "Rick: All righty. What's next?",
        "Nicole: Uh, let's see. Conception yoga or baby chanting. I-I'm just joking, you guys. Please don't. You guys are the best. I-I feel so...taken care of.",
        "Rick: Get used to it.",
        "Nicole: Well, you guys might change your mind after seven or eight months. I can get pretty moody in the best of circumstances.",
        "Maya: Really? You? Huh.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Maya: Oh, it's the doctor. This is Maya. Yeah. Really? There was a cancellation.",
        "Rick: Oh, good.",

        "Maya: Well, a patient rescheduled, so they pushed up our appointment.",
        "Rick: This is it.",
        "Maya: Could be. You ready?",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] Let's do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: \"I didn't expect this or plan for it, but Caroline and I are both thrilled.\"",
        "Ridge: I may have said that, but not to a reporter.",
        "Liam: No. No, no, no. It's on the Forrester website. The reporter just grabbed it.",
        "Ridge: And you knew about this -- this article -- you knew about this?",
        "Liam: Is that a problem?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, it's a problem. I don't like people talking about me when I'm not aware of it.",
        "Thomas: Dad, that's not always possible. I mean, it's the news. You and Caroline are having a baby. It kind of caught a lot of people off-guard.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it does mention your happiness at being a father again, more than once.",
        "Ridge: Well, at least that's the truth.",
        "Thomas: So, that's the truth. So...some of it's a lie? Geez, Louise. Man, ease up a little bit, guys. Look, the issue with my work -- I got to wonder where that's coming from. It's a little off-the-wall, man.",
        "Ridge: It comes from experience.",
        "Thomas: You sure about that?",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God. Thomas, he just wants you to make some changes. Just do it. He does it to me all the time.",
        "Thomas: Easy. I'll make the changes. One thing's for sure -- may not get along around here, but dad knows how to crank out babies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Steffy: Ah.",
        "Liam: Hi.",
        "Steffy: Some meeting.",
        "Liam: Yeah, tell me about it. Your dad couldn't even pretend to be happy about the article in Eye on Fashion.",
        "Steffy: Well, no, he wasn't happy, but I don't think he was that upset.",
        "Liam: Good, 'cause he shouldn't be. It's not a negative article. And it's not like everybody on the planet doesn't know he's having a baby anyway.",
        "Steffy: I don't know. He's just -- he's been a little squirrelly about that lately.",
        "Liam: Any idea why?",
        "Steffy: Probably the whole age difference. Having a kid with someone young enough to be his own kid.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I suppose.",
        "Steffy: What? What, you think there's more? I see those wheels turning.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Tell me.",
        "Liam: Just...his general mood lately and the way he's been coming down on Thomas.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but they have issues. They always have, and they always will. And you know Thomas punched my dad.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Yeah, I heard about that. It's just... [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Liam: I wonder what else is going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Have Wyatt go over the schedule with marketing, and, uh, fix those designs if you want to.",
        "Thomas: All right. Will do.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Thomas: Hey, Dad... I just wanted to say, before I leave, I'm sorry for giving you a hard time in the meeting.",
        "Ridge: Well, I can take a punch. As you know.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I figured that out, didn't I?",
        "Ridge: Is there anything else?",
        "Thomas: No, I guess not.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Thomas: You know what? Wait. Yeah, yeah. There is, Dad. I-I feel like there's -- there's all this residual anger, and I'm not sure where it's coming from. I mean, yeah, sure, a lot of it's in my head or something, but I-I just want to resolve this once and for all. I messed up. I disrespected you. And I feel awful about that.",
        "Caroline: Thomas, your dad knows that. I just -- it really doesn't need to be discussed anymore.",
        "Thomas: But I-I want to discuss this. I want to address it.",
        "Ridge: So, what is it? What do you have to say?",
        "Thomas: Look, I want us to be a family again, not adversaries. I mean, you and Caroline are bringing a baby into this world, and I meant what I said earlier that I'm happy about what you were able to give to her. When that little guy does come into this world, I-I want to be a part of that. I'm getting a new little baby brother or sister, and I-I want to show them the ropes. But I can't do that if we're throwing grenades back and forth at each other. So, I want to go on record saying I will do my part. You know, your happiness and this baby mean a lot to me. You know, I want -- I want peace.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: That's all I have to say.",

        "Maya: You ready?",
        "Nicole: Yep.",
        "Rick: Who are you calling?",
        "Maya: Mom and Dad.",
        "Nicole: You sure you want to do that?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Vivienne: Oh. Hi, honey.",
        "Maya: Hey, Mom. Is Dad with you?",
        "Vivienne: He's in the lobby. Why?",
        "Maya: Uh, I just -- I wanted to let you know this is the day, um, we're gonna have the appointment to see if Nicole's pregnant.",
        "Vivienne: I see.",
        "Maya: It's a big day for all of us, you and dad included.",
        "Vivienne: I wish I could share your enthusiasm.",
        "Maya: Can't you just be happy for me? Dad, I've given up on, but you?",
        "Vivienne: I always wanted what was best for you, Maya. Always. But Nicole -- I don't know. [Sighs] I don't know how this could affect her. I'm sorry.",
        "Maya: Okay. Well, um...I guess that's all I have to say. I'll let you know what happens.",
        "Vivienne: Okay.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Julius: Who was that?",
        "Vivienne: Oh. Maya. They're gonna see if, um, Nicole is pregnant today.",
        "Julius: Let's hope to God she isn't, for everybody's sake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: You okay?",
        "Maya: About you and me? Yeah. About them? I probably never will be. Let's go.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Going all sleuthy on me, love?",
        "Liam: No, I'm just... wondering.",
        "Steffy: There's nothing going on between my father and my brother other than the usual clash of the titans.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: I know you newsboys like a good story.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: Yeah, some intrigue or a secret. You want something.",
        "Liam: I wouldn't really call myself a newsboy.",
        "Steffy: Mm, then what? A journalist?",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm not really that, either.",
        "Steffy: Then what do you consider yourself?",
        "Liam: I like your word -- titan. Let's go with that. Titan.",
        "Steffy: And I'm your Pandora.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: I like that. But Pandora has a meeting.",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Another one?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, unfortunately.",
        "Liam: Oh.",
        "Steffy: Okay, save it for later, baby.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: Bye.",
        "Liam: Bye.",
        "[Liam's flashback]",
        "Liam: Think we figured out your secret. You're pregnant -- you and Caroline are having a baby.",
        "Brooke: When Ridge was in Paris, he had a vasectomy.",
        "Liam: It is kind of a small miracle that you're having this child.",
        "Ridge: I know it's not important to you. It's important to me and my wife. This is our kid. It's private.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Well, you are very prolific when you're pregnant.",
        "Caroline: Yes, lots of energy these days.",
        "Ridge: Keep it up. But don't do too much.",
        "Caroline: Hey... about what Thomas said earlier...",
        "Ridge: Yeah? What about it?",
        "Caroline: You know, it didn't, like, kind of bother you?",
        "Ridge: Oh, you mean about wanting peace? Everybody wants peace.",
        "Caroline: No, like what he -- like, when he started in about our baby and everything.",
        "Ridge: Our baby. That's right. It's our baby.",
        "Caroline: I know. But...",
        "Ridge: But what? What is it? What do you think would happen if Thomas found out the truth?",
        "Caroline: It'd be a scandal.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, it'd be a scandal. And people would suffer, all of us -- you, me, even poor old Thomas would suffer. But you know who would suffer more than anybody else? It's this little baby right in here. 'Cause this scandal would follow him or her everywhere -- playground, school, friends and family. So, I understand. I understand it's tough for you. It's tough for me, too. We'll do what we can to give this child a normal life, or as normal as it can be. So, do me a favor. Stop worrying about what's going to happen to Thomas. Worry about the kid. I've got another meeting.",
        "Liam: You okay?",
        "Caroline: Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Um...just a lot on my mind from that meeting.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Uh, me, too.",
        "Caroline: Uh, we have a lot of work to do on the line. So, I'm just...busy. Did you, uh -- did you need something?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Uh, yeah. Just a -- just an answer to a question. Is everything all right with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Was there something else I could have done?",
        "Vivienne: I ask myself the same question over and over.",
        "Julius: I know, with Maya, I wasn't there for her, and I realize that now. But Nicole -- she was my shining star. She was my hope for something good. And now look.",
        "Vivienne: Stop. We don't know yet. She might not be pregnant.",
        "Julius: Yeah. I guess we'll know soon enough, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. March: How's everyone feeling?",
        "Maya: Pretty excited.",
        "Rick: A little nervous, too.",
        "Dr. March: And you, Nicole?",
        "Nicole: I'm...ready to grow a baby.",
        "Dr. March: Any pain or cramping since the IUI procedure?",
        "Nicole: None at all. My sister has been checking my symptoms every hour, on the hour.",
        "Maya: Oh, com-- I haven't been that bad. Have I?",
        "Rick: Yes.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: No, Dr. March. I mean, I-I feel fine. I haven't had any symptoms. Maybe I'm not pregnant.",
        "Dr. March: Well, let's get some blood work and find out, hm?",
        "Maya: How -- how soon will we have the results?",
        "Dr. March: I put a rush on it, so shouldn't be too long.",
        "Maya: Thank you. You sure you're okay?",
        "Nicole: Yeah. I'm just nervous.",
        "Rick: We all are. This is a big leap of faith.",
        "Nicole: I just hope the test is positive, because if it's not --",
        "Rick: If it's not, we'll talk.",
        "Nicole: What's there to talk about?",
        "Maya: Honey, we know this has to be emotionally exhausting for you. And you've gone above and beyond. You've proved your love and your loyalty. If you're not pregnant, there's no pressure to do this again.",
        "Nicole: Maya, I --",
        "Maya: No, no. Regardless of what happens today, I am so deeply grateful to you for the sacrifice that you're making, for your incredible generosity. I love you so much, Nicole, and I've never felt closer to you.",
        "Nicole: Let's hope and pray that I'm pregnant. Let's hope that today's the start of your baby."
