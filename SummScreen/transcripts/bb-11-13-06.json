        "Phoebe: You can't make someone love you, Shane.",
        "Shane: I know that, I know that. But at least I can -- you know, I can wine you and dine you still, and admire you and try to impress you and make you fall head over heels for me, huh?",
        "Phoebe: Well, where did you get those?",
        "Shane: Oh, those? I just -- I found those lying around the house in a shoebox. Don't you think they're too pretty to be lying around in a shoebox? Why do I need pictures, though, when I've got the real thing right here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: How are you doing, sweetheart?",
        "Alexandria: Good.",
        "Thorne: Yeah? Are you almost done?",
        "Alexandria: I miss Taylor, Daddy.",
        "Thorne: I know you do, sweetheart.",
        "Alexandria: She'll get these soon, promise?",
        "Thorne: I promise.",
        "Alexandria: When is Taylor gonna be home?",
        "Thorne: I don't know, sweetheart. Come here. Daddy loves you, okay? Daddy's always going to love you. Now, why don't you go get on your PJs? Catherine will be here soon, okay? All right.",
        "Thorne: Taylor's trial starts tomorrow. Our daughter's come to depend on her so much. And whether it was an accident or not, Taylor's the one who took you from us. Where's the justice in that? Nothing's ever going to bring you back to us. But I don't want Taylor to go to prison. And it all depends on one man's testimony. Shane McGrath.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Taylor remembering]",
        "Harry: Just don't worry. McGrath is not gonna pull anything. Not while I'm around.",
        "Storm: I'm sorry that took so long. Thanks. All right, I'd like to talk a little more about Shane. I still think we'd get more impact by calling him last.",
        "Taylor: Absolutely not. I want Shane on the stand first.",
        "Storm: And this is all because of your concern for your daughter?",
        "Taylor: I just can't believe I even let him move in the house. I can't believe I let phoebe convince me to do that. I knew it was wrong. I just wanted her to be able to do something right. I knew that she needed that, and -- obviously, now Shane's misread her intentions.",
        "Storm: Which is why you want him out of her life ASAP?",
        "Taylor: Yes, yes! I'm just glad -- I'm glad Harry's on to him. At least I know I can count on him to protect her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phoebe: Hey, you've reached Phoebe's cell phone --",
        "Harry: Damn it! It was her voice mail again!",
        "Hector: I am aware that he doesn't work for your landscaping company anymore. But you have to have McGrath's address on a file, somewhere. I know that. Like I said before -- wait, wait, don't put me on hold! Don't -- damn it.",
        "Harry: This is insane. Phoebe could be in trouble. I called her cell and she's not answering. We need to get the address and get the cops over there right now.",
        "Hector: Look, Harry, normally I would agree with you, okay? But if the cops show up, McGrath could overreact, fear he's got nothing to lose --",
        "Harry: I know, and Phoebe could be in more trouble than she's already in.",
        "Hector: Right. Plus, if he bolts, he won't be there to testify on Taylor's behalf.",
        "Harry: Look, I know what's at stake here. This is Phoebe's safety we're talking about here, and I promised her mother I would never --",
        "Hector: Hold on, hold on -- you have the address? What -- 900 North Eugene, Apartment 6.",
        "Harry: I got it!",
        "Hector: Thank you. Hey, be careful. You don't know what you're walking into.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Hey, hey, hey, Phoebe, Phoebe -- why were you talking to Harry just now?",
        "Phoebe: Well -- I'll be honest with you, I was calling for a ride home.",
        "Shane: Home? You don't want to stay? I mean, we haven't even had dinner yet.",
        "Phoebe: I changed my mind.",
        "Shane: Changed your mind? What, about dinner? Wait, wait, about the whole evening?",
        "Phoebe: I know, I'm -- I'm sorry. I really am sorry. I just --",
        "Shane: No, no, no. It's the photos. It's the photos -- I know, they freaked you out.",
        "Phoebe: No, I -- well, I mean, it's cute, you have a crush on me. But, I just --",
        "Shane: No, no, no, there's no buts about it. I know you're freaked out. You're here in a man's apartment and you don't know what's going to happen, and you feel a little uncomfortable. But Phoebe, listen -- you got to trust me. Okay? These photos here, it's nothing. They're just a tribute to a beautiful, sweet girl who charmed me the moment I woke up in that hospital bed. Remember that, when I almost got my hand cut off?",
        "Phoebe: Yes, I remember that.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Shane: Listen, it was -- there you were. You were so gentle, and you had so much compassion. I remember what you told me. You said you'd stay by my side for as long as I needed you. And what kind of man is going to resist a sweet angel like that? Come here. You are very, very, very special. At first, I didn't think I'd be worthy enough to be with you. But now I think I can measure up. I can be the kind of man that you deserve. Okay? And you deserve the very best. And that's exactly what you're gonna get from me. The best. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Storm: So, let me get this straight. You think Shane's a possible flight risk.",
        "Taylor: Which is another reason we need to get him on the stand first.",
        "Storm: You do realize he's the only one who can corroborate Phoebe's claim that it was an accident.",
        "Taylor: I don't want Phoebe on the stand, storm.",
        "Storm: I know, but we're just going to have to see how it goes.",
        "Taylor: Oh, geez --",
        "Storm: Look, Taylor, I realize you're trying to protect your family. You didn't want a trial because of the impact on Thorne and his daughter. But hey, you agreed to let me defend you. You've got to let me do my job, so I can get you home to your family and everyone else who needs you, okay?",
        "[Door opening]",
        "Thorne: Am I interrupting?",
        "Taylor: Thorne --",
        "Thorne: If you and Storm are in the middle --",
        "Storm: No, no, it's okay.",
        "Thorne: Well, how does it look for tomorrow?",
        "Storm: Good.",
        "Thorne: Jury been selected?",
        "Storm: Earlier today.",
        "Thorne: And?",
        "Storm: Well, I'm happy with the choices. All I can ask is that any juror hears the evidence and weighs it with an open mind.",
        "Taylor: Thank you. Thank you so much, Storm. I couldn't ask for a better or more understanding attorney, or friend. And I want you to know I mean that, no matter how this turns out.",
        "Storm: Thanks. And you're welcome.",
        "Thorne: I won't stay long. I know you have a lot on your mind.",
        "Taylor: I am a little surprised to see you. It's been a while since you're last visit.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, well, there's been a reason for that. Not that we have to get into it now, but -- how are you holding up? The truth.",
        "Taylor: So much is riding on Shane's testimony, you know?",
        "Thorne: You still have reservations about this guy?",
        "Taylor: I know the prosecutor isn't going to give him a free ride. She's going to be doing everything she can to discredit him. And even though storm is happy with the jury, it doesn't mean anything. It's still unpredictable. It doesn't matter how convincing Shane is, it doesn't mean that they're going to believe it was an accident. But that you do, Thorne -- that you believe it -- that's really all that matters to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?",
        "Phoebe: Nothing, nothing. I just -- with Mom's trial tomorrow, it's hard to feel romantic.",
        "Shane: Phoebe, I told you. I'm going to come through for her, okay? Look at me. I will. You believe that, don't you?",
        "Phoebe: I want to.",
        "Shane: Hey, come here.",
        "Phoebe: I -- I can't. I can't.",
        "Shane: Phoebe, Phoebe, yes, you can.",
        "[Pounding on door]",
        "Harry: Phoebe, it's me. Are you okay? McGrath, open this door or I'm going to break it down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: I should have known that it was an accident. I'm sure Darla did.",
        "Taylor: I know you still miss her.",
        "Thorne: And I always will. She wouldn't want this, Taylor. You behind bars, a trial, everything that we've all been through. Losing Darla was devastating, but to have it compounded by -- anyway, one of the reasons why I came by -- here. It's from Ally. She talks about you all the time. She even wants to be a psychiatrist. Not that she knows what it is.",
        "Taylor: Dear, Taylor --",
        "[Taylor imagining]",
        "Alexandria: I miss you bunches. Daddy misses you bunches, too. I can't wait till you're home from London. Love, Ally.",
        "Taylor: You told her I was in London?",
        "Thorne: Visiting Steffy. She even drew the London Bridge, with a little help from her old man. It's her favorite game in preschool.",
        "Taylor: She's such a sweet little girl. And she's so special, just like her mom. And her daddy.",
        "Thorne: I didn't know how to tell her why you haven't been around. I couldn't tell her the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harry: Open this door, McGrath, or I'm gonna break it in.",
        "Shane: I said get lost, sailor boy.",
        "Harry: Not without, Phoebe! Open up!",
        "Shane: I said beat it, man.",
        "Harry: Where is she? I want to talk to her.",
        "Phoebe: Harry, I'm right here. I'm okay.",
        "Shane: See? She's fine. Now, get out of here!",
        "Harry: I want to see for myself!",
        "Shane: Forget it, man!",
        "Harry: Are you okay? I got here as soon as I could.",
        "Shane: Hey! Hey, get your hands off of her!",
        "Harry: Are you kidding, man? She doesn't want to be anywhere near you.",
        "Shane: That's a lie.",
        "Harry: Tell him, Phoebe.",
        "Shane: Is that true, Phoebe? Because if it is, then I'll just get on the bus and head out of here. You'll never see me again.",
        "Harry: Oh, and there it is. There it is. Holding your testimony over your head so that you can get her to --",
        "Phoebe: Stop it, for god's sake!",
        "Harry: This guy thinks he's holding all the cards. But you've been subpoenaed. That means you have to testify. Let's go.",
        "Shane: Oh, now look who's being dense. She doesn't need some wiry kid like you coming here and trying to look after her.",
        "Harry: Listen to him, Phoebe. This guy is dangerous. And he knows you're scared about your mom, and he's using that to get to you.",
        "Phoebe: I know what I'm doing.",
        "Harry: What you're doing is playing with fire, and I'm not going to let you.",
        "Phoebe: I need you to go.",
        "Harry: Why?",
        "Phoebe: I can handle this.",
        "Harry: If that were true then you wouldn't have called me and told me to come get you.",
        "Shane: Is that true, Phoebe? Am I just a means to an end to you? After I testify and your mom walks free, you're just gonna do away with me, toss me right out of your life? Is that it? Tell me the truth here, Phoebe!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Of course you would want to protect her from the truth. I mean, it hasn't been that long since she lost her mother. And then to add to it telling her where I am --",
        "Thorne: I just -- I couldn't hurt her that way. But there's another reason, too. I was hoping, when this was all over, that you would be able to spend time with Ally again the way that you used to. You're so important to her, Taylor.",
        "Taylor: I want to do that. I do, if by some miracle I'm acquitted. I mean, I realize that it doesn't mean everything's fine and everything's going to go back to the way it was between us. But just the fact that -- that you protected me in her heart, I mean, I don't even deserve that.",
        "Thorne: I wish I could say that I've come to terms with this, but there are days when I want to shout why. Why Darla? Why that night? Why you? Only, I'll never know. But I do know that I'm looking at a woman who would never intentionally hurt my wife. And I believe that. I believe that in my head, and I believe it in my heart. And when storm presents his case and Shane testifies, I have to believe that the jury will see it, too.",
        "Taylor: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harry: I'm taking you out of here.",
        "Shane: No, you just answer the question for me, Phoebe. Please, are you just giving me enough to keep me from running? Enough just to get me on that witness stand for tomorrow? Or is there something between us? Because I feel it, and I gotta know if you feel that, too. Before you answer that, can we just get this guy out here, please?",
        "Phoebe: Harry --",
        "Shane: Man!",
        "Phoebe: Harry's leaving.",
        "Harry: All right. But if you lay one finger on her, I'm coming after you myself with the hedge clippers.",
        "Shane: All right. All right, all right, all right. All right. Bye.",
        "Phoebe: The truth. I told you I'm attracted to you, okay? But I also told you that I'm young. I'm not ready for all this -- to be completely honest, I'm concerned about what'll happen to my mother if you don't come through for her tomorrow.",
        "Shane: I am gonna come through for her, and you're going to see that. Look, Phoebe, let's just -- oh, man, let's just forget about all this, all right? Let's pretend like you didn't make that phone call, let's pretend that sailor boy didn't come by here and try to rescue you. We could still have a really, really special evening here.",
        "Phoebe: And forget how nervous I am, and how my mom's -- everything is at stake tomorrow.",
        "Shane: Phoebe, listen -- you just need to relax, okay?",
        "Phoebe: I'm sorry, I can't. I can't. Okay, you know what? Tomorrow, after you've testified and told the jury the truth about what happened, after it's all over, then we can celebrate.",
        "Shane: Now we're talking."
