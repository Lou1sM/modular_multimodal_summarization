    "Recap": [
        "Liam pulls the old family card on Caroline and says he knows her hormones are out of whack because of the pregnancy ..but he has eyes and he knows something else is wrong. Why all the tension between Thomas and Ridge .and why Ridge wants no one in the press to know any details of the pregnancy. All await the blood test for Nicole to see if she is pregnant. Julius and Vivienne go to the Forresters and hope they are not butting in, but they could not stay in the empty hotel room any longer. Julius has a few more crude remarks to make about Rick and Nicole's baby but then hand it over to Maya. Steffy asks her dad to do more than think about it. Thomas made some mistakes and he has apologized for it so she and the company need Ridge to ease the anger and tension. That is not who he is. He needs to move on and forgive. Caroline tells Liam that it does not matter. Ridge is her rock and Liam does not need to worry about him causing her stress. Yes he and Thomas have issues but they will work it out. Liam still persists that something is wrong and she needs to come clean and tell him. Ridge says he is not worried about Thomas making the same mistake. He will not give him that opportunity.",
        "Steffy tells Thomas all this over a stupid punch doesn't seem right, she bets he would like to take that back. Caroline tells Liam all of this does not matter but he keeps saying it all seems a little strange. She says only because she got forced to tell all she was pregnant way before she wanted to. She loves him and she is fine, so let it drop. The vasectomy is nobody's concern. Eric tells Zende with Julius there that he is proud of Zende and he owes no one an answer how he will feel if and when Nicole becomes pregnant. He has always been behind her 100%. Maya says her parents can believe what they want but this pregnancy will not be negative. It will strengthen their bond, Nicole so loving and giving can not be anything but positive. Thomas is listening at the door when Caroline talks to Ridge and he says Thomas must never know. Brooke tells Zende they are alone so tell her how he really feels. Dr. March tells Maya, Rick and Nicole that they put a rush on the tests, congratulations she is going to have a baby. Maya says they will take good care of Nicole and not leave her side. The doctor will see them in two weeks. Maya is ecstatic. She hugs Rick as tears roll down his face."

        "Maya: Doing okay?",
        "Nicole: Uh, yeah. Actually, I-I've never been so nervous to get blood drawn before in my life.",
        "Rick: I've never been so nervous about somebody else getting a blood test.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, I know, right? I just hope I don't disappoint.",
        "Maya: The fact that you even agreed to do this -- I am so proud, I am so humbled, to be your sister. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Hope we're not interrupting.",
        "Eric: No, not at all.",
        "Vivienne: We couldn't bear sitting around that motel room waiting to hear.",
        "Eric: Shouldn't be long now, though, before we find out if Rick and Maya are having a baby.",
        "Julius: You mean Rick and Nicole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Hey, do we need to call for a meeting, or can you discuss these revisions with Quinn on your own?",
        "Thomas: Oh, Steff, I'm a big boy. I can handle Quinn.",
        "Steffy: Ooh, I don't know. She gets intense. It's sometimes nice to have Dad in the room for backup.",
        "Thomas: And I'm also part of the design team. I don't need Dad to convey my notes.",
        "Steffy: You're getting all tense every time Dad's mentioned, more than usual. What's going on?",
        "Ridge: What'd I miss?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: No, really. Are -- are you all right?",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm just busy, you know?",
        "Liam: Are you sure?",
        "Caroline: I don't -- [Chuckles] Why are you even asking me this?",
        "Liam: Because I know you, Caroline. And I can see with my eyes that something is wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: All due respect, if Nicole's pregnant, the baby isn't hers.",
        "Julius: Oh, I see. So we're all supposed to pretend that it's Maya's, even though we all know the truth.",
        "Vivienne: Well, biologically, the child is Nicole's.",
        "Brooke: She'd be carrying the child for Rick and Maya.",
        "Julius: Giving up nine months of her life, giving up her body, for what? So that she could ultimately have a child of her own flesh and blood, and then be forced to give it up to her brother -- her sister. I mean, how cruel is that?",
        "Eric: Nicole is fully aware of what she signed up for.",
        "Julius: How? How could she be aware of what it would be to give birth to a child and then walk away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Dr. March: Nicole, you ready to get that blood drawn?",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] Ready.",
        "Dr. March: If you'll just follow Debbie.",
        "Maya: Do you want me to come?",
        "Nicole: I'll be fine.",
        "Maya: Okay.",
        "Dr. March: Won't be long now. You'll know if you're expecting a baby.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Go ahead. You got something to say?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah, I-I mean, I've apologized, told you I want peace. I was out of line. I'm just trying to get your respect back.",
        "Steffy: And you will. It was wrong to punch Dad, and you know that. And it was wrong to be so cavalier about what went down between you and that intern. That's what this is about? Dad, you will forgive him, because that's what the company needs. That's what our family needs. Can you do that?",
        "Ridge: I'm working on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: I'm feeling a little bit off, yes. But I feel like that's allowed due to the millions of cells currently multiplying inside my body.",
        "Liam: So, that's what this is? You're just -- you're just pregnant?",
        "Caroline: Oh, I'm just pregnant, Liam? Do you have any idea what an emotional roller coaster pregnancy is?",
        "Liam: Yeah, Caroline. Actually, I do.",
        "Caroline: Oh, you do?",
        "Liam: I have been watching you, how you are with Thomas, how you are with Ridge -- the tension between the two of them. And now there's all this secrecy about the pregnancy, and Ridge is acting like the press can't be involved at all. Now, w-why would he think like that? Why would he do that? I'm your family, Caroline. You can talk to me. I'm here for you. What is going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Did they call?",
        "Julius: No.",
        "Brooke: Some tea?",
        "Vivienne: Oh, thank you.",
        "Julius: I just keep praying that it fails.",
        "Vivienne: Don't waste your prayers on that. Pray for understanding, no matter how it turns out.",
        "Eric: Must be confusing, being very happy for Maya, the fact that she may be a mother, and then terrified for Nicole.",
        "Vivienne: You know, it's definitely confusing. I mean, please don't get us wrong. We are happy with the idea. I mean, it's wonderful that Maya can get a chance. I mean, just 'cause she's a-a transgender doesn't mean that she shouldn't be a mother. But it's complicated. If Nicole gets pregnant, we'll just have to figure out how to deal with it. What else can we do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: How'd it go?",
        "Nicole: Uh, quick and easy.",
        "Rick: Have a seat. Sit down.",
        "Maya: Oh, what a gentleman.",
        "Nicole: I just got blood drawn. It's not surgery, Rick.",
        "Rick: You better get used to it. If you're carrying my baby, I'm gonna be wrapping you in bubble wrap for the next nine months.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Nicole: I just wish I felt sick or something.",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Nicole: Well, I mean, if I had a sign -- morning sickness, I don't know, feeling extra tired -- something that would make me believe I could be pregnant.",
        "Maya: Odds are, you aren't, right? That's the reality. The percentages of a successful first IUI attempt are low. But...even though I wish you were crippled with the worst morning sickness right now, I still choose to think positively.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Dad... I need you to do more than just work on it. Thomas made some bad decisions. He knows that, right?",
        "Thomas: Yes. Honestly, if I could take it all back, I-I would.",
        "Ridge: Some things, you can't take back. Some things, you can never make right.",
        "Steffy: Even when it's your own child? Thomas made mistakes, and he apologized. You're gonna waste all this time holding a grudge? You have a baby on the way, a wife who needs her husband to be happy and stress-free. Think about your wife. Think about your unborn child. All this anger, all this tension -- that's not who you are. That's not who you want to be. You need to move on. You need to forgive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Ridge and Thomas are going through a very difficult time right now. Some things happened that shouldn't have. But they're trying their best to move forward and put it all behind them, so it doesn't really matter.",
        "Liam: N-no, it does. It does matter, because you're pregnant, and you have to be taking it easy.",
        "Caroline: I am!",
        "Liam: Caroline? Is Ridge stressing you out?",
        "Caroline: No. That man is my rock, so you don't need to worry about him.",
        "Liam: Okay. Thomas, then.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Liam: Something is the matter. If it's not Ridge, maybe it's Thomas.",
        "Caroline: I really don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Liam: You -- you are not yourself lately. And the more you try to convince me otherwise, the less I believe you. Come clean, Caroline. Tell me the truth. What is wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I appreciate your concern, Steffy. And I agree. My priority's got to be my wife and my kid. Being angry doesn't help anybody. You think I like this? You think I like being at odds with you?",
        "Thomas: Dad, look. If you're -- if you're worried that I'm gonna make the same mistake again --",
        "Ridge: No, I'm not worried about that, because I'm not gonna give you the opportunity.",
        "Steffy: I know bad feelings don't go away overnight. But some things are too important to let feelings get in the way. Family is important.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Steffy: This is all because of a stupid punch? [Scoffs] I bet you wish you could take that back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: Why are you acting like this?",
        "Liam: Acting like what -- concerned? Look, I'm sorry. I don't mean to pressure you. But, uh, this whole thing is a little odd, and, Caroline, if you need help --",
        "Caroline: Uh, I don't! I am fine.",
        "Liam: You're fine. You're fine! You're fine. I want to believe that. I really do. But the way that you and Ridge have been acting from the very beginning of this thing --",
        "Caroline: From the very beginning? You mean when Pam and Charlie basically ambushed me into admitting I was pregnant?",
        "Liam: Yeah, actually. A-and then the vasectomy thing?",
        "Caroline: Oh, what is -- why does that even matter? He got it reversed, and obviously, it's not an issue.",
        "Liam: Okay, but can you -- can you at least -- from my point of view, can you understand why this seems a little strange? A-and then you add to that this weird tension between Ridge and Thomas.",
        "Caroline: Excuse me for not jumping up and down with excitement when I get forced into telling everybody that I'm pregnant way before I wanted to. And the whole vasectomy thing is no one's business. It's really personal. Look. I get that you're concerned, and I appreciate it. And I love you. But I am fine, Liam. I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julius: Zende... I want you to be honest with me.",
        "Zende: I have been.",
        "Julius: How are you gonna feel when Nicole's got Rick's baby inside her?",
        "Eric: I don't think it's fair for you to ask Zende to feel any one certain way about this situation. I mean, he's given Nicole his full support, even though this whole situation is a little uncertain. I'm proud of you.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Eric: Who is it?",
        "Brooke: It's not Rick.",
        "Eric: Mm.",
        "Brooke: Not yet, anyway. Do you think I should text him?",
        "Eric: No, no, no. He'll call as soon as he knows anything.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I know. I'm just eager. I can't wait to become a grandma again.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I wonder what will be harder -- telling our parents that I'm pregnant or that I'm not.",
        "Maya: If you are, they'll have those disapproving looks.",
        "Nicole: And if I'm not, they won't be able to hide their relief.",
        "Maya: I wish they could be more supportive. [Sighs]",
        "Rick: It'll be difficult to take their reaction either way, but we have to remember they're your parents. They're only acting this way out of concern.",
        "Maya: But they don't have to be concerned. Instead of making it so difficult on all of us, they could've... I just don't understand, when you have this situation, this -- this opportunity for all of us to be closer as a family, why they would choose to be negative and -- and to believe the worst.",
        "Nicole: We can't let them affect us, Maya.",
        "Maya: I won't. Our parents can believe whatever they want to believe -- that this pregnancy will destroy you, our relationship, your chances at a shot with Zende. But we know better. We know that their negativity will not affect us and that as hard as this process might be at times, it's only gonna strengthen our bond. My sister, carrying a child for my husband and me? How can something so loving and beautiful as what you're choosing to do for us be anything but positive for all of us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. March: I have your results.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: What -- what's wrong?",
        "Liam: What? Nothing. N-- um...",
        "Steffy: Liam, what's wrong?",
        "Liam: [Sighs] All right. I was talking to Caroline. And she's not herself lately. S-something is weighing on her.",
        "Steffy: Did you -- did you ask her about it?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: I did. She -- she denied it.",
        "Steffy: Well, you realize she's -- she's pregnant, right? She's not herself. She's in a minefield of hormones.",
        "Liam: I know that, but, still.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, you're a good cousin, and that's really sweet of you, but... Caroline's fine. She has the man of her dreams. She has a baby on the way. I don't think you have anything to worry about.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.",
        "Steffy: Probably? I'm always right.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: You seem tense.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] It's just, Liam's picking up on things. You know, with the way that we reacted about the vasectomy, and the hostility between you and Thomas, I-I can just see his wheels turning.",
        "Ridge: So you think Liam is a problem?",
        "Caroline: I think I can convince him not to worry. But, baby, you have to help me out a little bit. You've got to relax a little bit around Thomas.",
        "Ridge: I'm trying. I look at him. All I see is his hands on you.",
        "Caroline: I just really hate this tension. You know, and -- and keeping secrets, it's very -- it's stressful.",
        "Ridge: Well, then, maybe it's not a secret. Maybe it's just the truth. We're having a baby.",
        "Caroline: Can we really do this -- I mean, just not tell anyone?",
        "Ridge: Of course, we can. We're starting a family. Thomas will never know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Don't let Julius get to you.",
        "Zende: I'm not.",
        "Brooke: It's okay to be conflicted. Come on. Open up. It's just the two of us. How do you really feel?",
        "Zende: I want to believe that I'll be excited for Nicole, you know, happy that she's helping Rick and Maya. I don't know, man. Part of me is -- is believing maybe Mr. Avant is right. I mean, how much am I really giving up? How am I really supposed to react? How am I supposed to react when -- if Nicole tells me she's pregnant?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: You already have the results so fast?",
        "Dr. March: Yeah, I think Steve down in the lab is a little afraid of me, or he has a crush on me. I can't tell. But when I put a rush on something, he is on it. Congratulations. You're having a baby.",
        "Maya: It worked? It really worked!",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "Maya: It really worked.",
        "Dr. March: It did. Nicole, are you okay?",
        "Nicole: Yeah. [Chuckles] I'm just a-a little shocked, you know? We did it.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Dr. March: I know I've given you a lot of information to read, but do you have any specific questions?",
        "Nicole: Uh, y-yeah, like a zillion. But, um... I can't really think of any right now.",
        "Dr. March: Well, you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's to be expected.",
        "Maya: Don't worry. We're gonna take good care of Nicole. We're not leaving her side.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Dr. March: I don't doubt it. Now, keep taking your prenatal vitamins. I want to see you back here in two weeks so we can check your levels.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, of course.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Dr. March: Congratulations again, to all of you.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: I haven't done much yet.",
        "Maya: What?!",
        "Rick: Giving us a child of our own? We can't thank you enough.",
        "Maya: The fact that you even tried to agree to -- but -- but now that there's a baby, I -- my sister is giving me a baby. I can't even... how far we've come -- I mean, years of not knowing you, o-of wondering if I would ever see you again, and now not only are you a part of my life, but you're giving me one. My husband's baby that's also a part of me? I -- I never let myself believe I -- [Laughing, crying] We're having a baby!"
