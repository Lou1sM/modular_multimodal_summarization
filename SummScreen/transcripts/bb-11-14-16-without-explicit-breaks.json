        "Eric tells Katie that he is pleased with the show; he thinks his wife was wonderful and all that matters is the applause, not who was wearing the show stopper. He feels it has something to do with Ridge. But the important thing is Quinn came through for him. She did not let him down. Quinn and Ridge continue to exchange words under their breath with smiles on their faces on the runway. Backstage Quinn wants to toast the occasion but Ridge passes. But that too is shot down when several buyers come back stage and praise them and say they will be buying more in force. They say the jewelry line was superb. And Ridge's designs are always great but this surpassed with an extra edge to them. Steffy and Ridge are floored. Quinn asks them to stay when the buyers leave.

        "[Applause]",
        "Ridge: You're proud of yourself, aren't you?",
        "Quinn: Well, it's your design. You pulled it from the show. I just wanted the whole world to see it.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, you're full of it.",
        "Quinn: I love you, too, Ridge. Now smile for our guests.",
        "Ridge: Oh, I'm smiling.",
        "Wyatt: We did it!",
        "Ivy: I know! What a show!",
        "Steffy: Never ceases to amaze. I'll give her that. But we don't know anything until we see orders. And the buyers seemed confused about the jewelry pass. They're applauding because of my father's designs.",
        "Wyatt: And the woman wearing it.",
        "Ivy: Which you were supposed to be wearing, right? You know, I wonder what Eric thinks, watching from home.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I'm sure he's as proud of her as we are.",
        "Katie: Oh, man, I wish I could read lips.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] I wish I could, too.",
        "Katie: What do you think they're saying to each other?",
        "Eric: I hope they're complimenting each other. The dress is spectacular, and my wife looks wonderful in it.",
        "Katie: She does look beautiful. But wasn't Steffy supposed to wear the showstopper?",
        "Eric: Yeah, she was. I'm a little curious about that myself. But the only thing that really matters is the applause, all right? The gown and the whole -- the whole showing is a great success, and I knew it would be with Quinn spearheading it. She didn't let me down. She never will.",
        "Zende: Sasha, you decent?",
        "Sasha: Oh, more than decent. You know, my first Forrester fashion show. Does it get any better than this?",
        "Zende: You wowed. You did really well.",
        "Sasha: Well, I don't know about that. I think Quinn's the one who wowed. And why wouldn't she? When she came out in that gown...",
        "Zende: Yeah, that gown almost didn't make it to the runway. What's going on between you and Maya? You two seemed like you had words.",
        "Sasha: Well, she's upset about what happened between you and me and what it's doing to Nicole. Which I totally get. I didn't -- I really didn't mean to hurt Nicole. It was a total misunderstanding completely. That's exactly why I need to talk to her. I mean, I know she's furious at me, but she -- she's still my sister, right?",
        "Zende: Look, I think maybe you should steer clear of Nicole for a while. Maybe we both should.",
        "Sasha: You know, Zende, you still -- you still haven't answered my question from before. Where does all of this leave you and me?",
        "Eric: I still have to wonder what happened with the showstopper. I imagine it has something to do with Ridge.",
        "Katie: Are you concerned?",
        "Eric: Yes, I am, actually. I just wish he would reach out, reach out to Quinn and cooperate the way I asked -- I asked him to. The important thing is that Quinn came through for me. The way I knew she would.",
        "Quinn: I feel like celebrating. Why don't you make a toast?",
        "Ridge: To you?",
        "Quinn: Of course to me. I saved your bacon up there.",
        "Ridge: No, you saved your own bacon with the dress that shouldn't have been out there.",
        "Quinn: You were trying to sabotage me. But all is forgiven. Everyone loved your design.",
        "Ridge: No one liked your little jewelry pass. They didn't know what to make of it.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, maybe at first, but once everyone understood what was going on...",
        "Steffy: I'm not sure they did.",
        "Ivy: Why do you say that?",
        "Steffy: Well, I was watching. There was a lot of confused expressions.",
        "Pam: Some, uh, very special people would like to meet with you, Ridge...and Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Oh.",
        "Ridge: Gianfranco, hey.",
        "Salvestro: Good to see you again, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Salvestro, how are you? Simone. Thank you all for coming.",
        "Gianfranco: Sorry Eric couldn't be here with us.",
        "Simone: He is doing better, though, n'est-ce pas?",
        "Ridge: He is, yes. Thank you. We're all very happy about that.",
        "Salvestro: As are we.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, so, what did you all think of the show?",
        "Gianfranco: Well, I think I can speak for the other buyers when I say Ridge's lines were inspiring, as usual.",
        "Ridge: Thank you, man.",
        "Salvestro: And, Quinn, such beautiful jewelry. I've never seen it highlighted in a major fashion show like you did.",
        "Quinn: You liked it?",
        "Salvestro: Liked it? [Chuckles] You can expect a very substantial order, my dear.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Really?",
        "Salvestro: Really.",
        "Quinn: Oh! Thank you. Thank you so much. You have no idea what this means to us. [Laughs]",
        "Salvestro: Forrester fashion shows never disappoint.",
        "Gianfranco: But this was bolder, more cutting edge, if that's possible.",
        "Simone: Obviously you and Quinn make a very good team.",
        "Ivy: They do, don't they?",
        "Simone: The showstopper was sublime, Ridge.",
        "Salvestro: And the jewelry line -- bellissima, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Oh, ho, ho!",
        "Salvestro: Forrester was definitely smart to showcase it like you did.",
        "Gianfranco: I agree wholeheartedly. You can expect a large order from me, as well.",
        "Quinn: Oh! Gianfranco, Salvestro, if I wasn't already blissfully married, I would kiss you both. Oh, what the hell? I'm gonna do it anyway.",
        "Salvestro: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: Thank you. And, Simone. Thank you.",
        "Gianfranco: Speaking of Eric, he must be very proud of his new bride, stepping in at such a critical time.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, we're all very proud of my mother, aren't we?",
        "Salvestro: Please give Eric our best, and congratulations again, Ridge and Quinn.",
        "Simone: Quite a triumph for the Forrester collections.",
        "Pam: Okie dokie. Time to wrap this up. So, uh, if you'd all please follow me out? Thank you.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. Thank you so much. Um, Ridge, would you and Steffy stay for a minute? There's something I want to say that I'd like both of you to hear.",
        "Zende: [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: [Gasps]",
        "Zende: Nicole? Nicole! Nicole, wait, wait. Let me explain.",
        "Nicole: [Sobbing] You're in bed with her.",
        "Zende: I am so sorry.",
        "Nicole: Do you know what that did to me? It was cruel, Zende. You knew how much that would hurt me.",
        "Zende: I never wanted to do that to you, Nicole. I love you. More than I've loved anyone else. But for you to ignore me, for you to make that decision on your own...",
        "Nicole: I didn't do it.",
        "Zende: What?",
        "Nicole: That's what I was coming on the jet to tell you. I didn't go through with the procedure. I'm not pregnant, Zende. I changed my mind. For you. For us.",
        "Sasha: Listen, if it feels like I'm pressuring you, I swear I'm not.",
        "Zende: Look, I get it. You want to know where we stand. But honestly, Sasha, I can't think about anyone else or anything right now but Nicole, how much I've hurt her.",
        "Sasha: Yeah.",
        "Katie: You know, when you said to me the other day that you want me to get to know the Quinn that you know, I was... a little skeptical, I will admit. But I'm willing to give anyone the benefit of the doubt, and maybe she really has changed. She certainly changed you, put a smile on your face.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: I just want each and every one of you to know how humbled and honored I am to have been able to represent Forrester creations today. And I know it was a team effort. Without Ridge's and Eric's and Thomas' impeccable designs, we wouldn't have had a show at all. And I'm not being boastful, but I'm very proud of my jewelry designs.",
        "Wyatt: And you should be.",
        "Quinn: And [Chuckles] How well they were received.",
        "Ivy: They'll be talking about this for years.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Can I ask you about your cheering section? Do they follow you everywhere?",
        "Wyatt: Only when things need to be cheered. And mom really came through for Forrester today.",
        "Ivy: And Eric.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: Well, we all came through for Eric, at least I hope we all did. And, you know, I have to admit that I was a little nervous. You know, pulling something this major off was a bit daunting. But, you know, despite a few little glitches, we did it. [Laughing] We did it. And I just -- I just want to thank you, Wyatt and ivy, for your loyalty and your support. I-I am so grateful for it.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, of course.",
        "Quinn: And you know what? I know that Eric was watching at home, and I cannot wait to get there 'cause I just want to hear what he thought about it all! And I'm sure that nothing that happened today is gonna change the way you feel about me, and I'm not sure that anything ever will. But I'm gonna keep trying for my husband's sake, because I know how important family is to him, that we all support each other and that we get along. And what's important to Eric is important to me. I just wanted this to be a success for Forrester and for the family. But most of all, for my husband, because I love him. And I just want him to be proud of me.",
        "Katie: I should go. I don't want to wear out my welcome.",
        "Eric: Well, nonsense.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: I'm very grateful that you came by.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm grateful that my son is enrolled in school, thanks to you.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: The last couple months haven't been easy, and I'm -- I'm so thankful for my son, but this was nice. I get lonely.",
        "Eric: Well, you're never alone. I'll always be there for you, Katie Logan. Don't you forget that.",
        "Katie: I won't.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I still can't believe it, can you?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] What? That Ridge tried to put the kibosh on the whole showstopper thing?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and he almost got away with it, too.",
        "Ivy: If he'd gone up against anyone other than your mother, he would have gotten away with it.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] My mom really did shine tonight, didn't she?",
        "Ivy: Oh, my gosh. When she came down that runway in that gown...",
        "Wyatt: Oh!",
        "Ivy: What a moment.",
        "Wyatt: One I'm sure Ridge will never forget.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. And Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. You know, I get that she loves her dad. Hell, in her eyes, he can practically do no wrong. But in this case, he's wrong about my mother and Eric.",
        "Ivy: I'm just glad you've seen the light.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I know, I know. I had my huge doubts at first. I mean, come on. They're -- they're a pretty unlikely pair, right?",
        "Ivy: Well...",
        "Wyatt: Somehow they work.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: You know? And as much as I want today to be the turning point of how Ridge views my mother and Eric... [Scoffs] I'm not gonna hold my breath.",
        "Ridge: No, that's -- that's great. Thank you very much. Thank you.",
        "Steffy: Another order?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, they keep coming in. Pam's phone won't stop ringing.",
        "Steffy: How does Quinn manage to do this? Like, she always pulls a rabbit out of the hat.",
        "Ridge: I don't know. Company's doing well, and ordinarily I'd be very pleased. But there's nothing ordinary about this. Quinn is running the place.",
        "Steffy: Temporarily. Until granddad's well enough to come back.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, looking forward to that. But what's gonna change, really? They're still gonna be married, and she's still gonna have his ear.",
        "Steffy: Do you think she's gonna tell granddad about the showstopper?",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Why she wore it instead of me?",
        "Ridge: I think that's gonna be the first question out of his mouth.",
        "Steffy: How do you think she's gonna answer it?",
        "Ridge: Any way that makes her look like the savior she thinks she is.",
        "Quinn: Eric! Where are you?! Hello!",
        "Eric: You looking for me?",
        "Quinn: Hey! Oh, I thought you would be upstairs resting.",
        "Eric: No, I've been waiting for you.",
        "Quinn: Yeah?",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: Well, I would have been home sooner, but I... so did you see it?",
        "Eric: The show? Yeah, I saw. I saw the whole thing from start to finish.",
        "Quinn: Yeah? Well, uh, I mean, what did you think? You just... is -- is everything okay?",
        "Eric: Yeah. Why would you ask?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckling] It's the way you're -- you're talking to me. And, well... so you saw the show. What did you think?",
        "Ridge: I pulled the showstopper because I can't endorse Quinn and her role in this company. She turned the tables on us.",
        "Steffy: Dad, look, I know you're thinking about the family and Forrester, but I got to admit, what Quinn did, wearing the showstopper, she really saved us.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: Can you just imagine the reaction if we just ended it with the jewelry pass? We need buzz to generate sales, and that was a showstopper. I mean, that would have been a huge financial hit.",
        "Ridge: I know, I know, I know, I know. I get all that, and that's why I didn't disagree with Gianfranco when he said that Quinn and I make a great team and how well we work together. If they knew what was going on behind the scenes and the turmoil of this company, it could be detrimental to us. But meanwhile, you have Quinn with even more control over Forrester. It means our family and our lives.",
        "Wyatt: My mother wore that showstopper for Eric. She risked everything to come through for her husband today. And I know I fought against them for a very long time, but after today... I'm even more of a believer in my mom and Eric.",
        "Quinn: You're probably wondering about the showstopper and why Steffy wasn't wearing it.",
        "Eric: I assume it has something to do with Ridge.",
        "Quinn: Yes.",
        "Eric: But you're not gonna tell me.",
        "Quinn: Well, if I do, then I'm throwing Ridge under the bus, and it's something I really don't want to do.",
        "Eric: Tell me anyway.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Well, Ridge pulled the showstopper at the very last second. He didn't want to follow the jewelry pass, and he convinced Steffy not to wear it.",
        "Eric: And so you wore it.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I tried to get anybody else to wear it -- ivy, the models. They're all so tall and thin. And, you know, it was fit to Steffy, so...",
        "Eric: But it fit you.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. It did. I couldn't let the show be a failure. I couldn't let you down, so [Laughing] I ended up doing the only thing that I never thought I would do, which is put on the showstopper and walk down the runway. [Laughs] And the buyers? They promised orders, Eric. They promised really big orders. And everybody sends their best regards to you and... but the most important thing -- I mean, the only important thing right now is -- is what did you think of the show? And I can't tell, Eric! Eric!",
        "Eric: I love you.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I know! I love you, too! I do! I love you! But what did you think of the show?! You can be honest with me!",
        "Eric: I love you. And I loved the show. It was sensational. I am so proud of you.",
        "Quinn: You are so proud! Oh! Eric, you have no idea what that means to me. You realize that the only thing I wanted more than anything is to make you proud.",
        "Eric: Oh, you did. You did. Now, come on. Come upstairs, Mrs. Forrester. We have a lot to celebrate.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Wait, no, just -- I, um... I want to check my phone just once before I go upstairs.",
        "Eric: You're gonna start counting the orders?",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I guess I am, so -- [Laughs] I'll be right up.",
        "Eric: Good.",
        "Quinn: Oh, God."
