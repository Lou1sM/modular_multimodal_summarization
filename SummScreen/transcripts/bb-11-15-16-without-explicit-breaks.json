        "Brooke looks up and there stands Ridge in her kitchen. He wants to tempt her. Turns out he has a pint of ice creme in his hand and they sit and share it. He can't help but say this is the worst most successful showing they have ever had. And Quinn will get all the credit. She tries to assure him all will work out okay. He stares at her and says yes he knows he has more important things to think about. Quinn holds the champagne glass where she notices a big red lipstick print. She questions Eric later about it. He tells her Katie dropped by and watched the fashion show with him. She digs it out of him that she has stopped in several times lately. He was so excited about the show that he forgot to mention it. She mentions that she saw the glasses downstairs so that explains it. Eric says he worked too hard on his recovery so he did not drink any but they opened the bottle and Katie had a small sip. He hopes that Quinn does not mind. He should have cleaned it up. She says she trusts him completely so she is only disappointed in that Eric could not be with her at the showing but he was sharing it with another woman. Eric apologizes and says Katie is an old friend and she did not come over here to criticize Quinn. She has a Logan on her side.",
        "Katie drops in on Rick and tells him she was impressed by the show and thought it was a big success. Rick knows his dad will give Quinn credit and he just cannot stand that. She tells him that Eric helped her with Will so that is one other thing that she now has off her plate. Now she needs to find an agent and get another house. He says he can help her. They look online and he finds one right next door to Eric's and says he knows the place well and it is ideal and she will love it. They make plans to see it tomorrow. Ridge asks Brooke about Bill and she shows him that she still has his ring, but says he is still upset with her. Ridge says they can take care of that ring situation very quickly. She says she knows they have all put their lives on hold. Ridge says he will always be right there and Spencer is right, she cannot have two men in her life so when she chooses Ridge it will have to be Spencerless. Quinn contemplates it and then calls Katie. She says she is really glad Eric had company to watch the show but she did not think it was appropriate while she was away. She is glad Eric could help her get her son into school and she is not concerned but it doesn't look good. She says she admires Katie and would like to know her better herself so next time call with a heads up so she can be there as well."

        "Rick: You sure I can't get you anything, aunt Katie?",
        "Katie: No, no, I just wanted to swing by and congratulate you on the fashion show.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Um, everybody kind of ducked out early after it was over.",
        "Katie: Well, I can imagine. It must be very stressful.",
        "Rick: It was. It was, uh, it was stressful, and it was a little crazy, too.",
        "Katie: Well, it looked like a huge success. I was watching it with your father.",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah, no, the collection was amazing. But Quinn wearing the showstopper? [Chuckles] I swear you never know what that woman's gonna do.",
        "Eric: There you are. I was wondering if I was gonna have to come find you.",
        "Quinn: I was downstairs.",
        "Eric: Yeah, for far too long.",
        "Quinn: What is all this?",
        "Eric: We're celebrating your success. I am so proud of you. I wish I'd been there. It wasn't the same watching it on the live feed here.",
        "Quinn: You watched the whole show?",
        "Eric: I did. It was riveting. And you were right. The jewelry pass was sensational. It surprised the whole audience. It was great.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Were you alone?",
        "Eric: No, Katie Logan watched it with me.",
        "Brooke: Tempt me?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. With something sweet and delicious.",
        "Brooke: [Gasps] Oh! Okay. [Laughing] I see. I'll have some of that.",
        "Ridge: Cool. Sit down. Where are your spoons? Ah. Here.",
        "Brooke: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: There are only two things in the world that would make me feel better about this day. And now I get to enjoy them both.",
        "Brooke: After that fashion show, you should have brought a gallon of ice cream, not a pint.",
        "Katie: I can understand why your family has issues with Quinn.",
        "Rick: We can't get rid of her. No matter what we do, she always comes out on top.",
        "Katie: Well, you can't be upset that the fashion show was a success.",
        "Rick: I hate that my dad is gonna give her credit for it.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Rick: He already did, didn't he?",
        "Katie: He -- he's very proud of her.",
        "Rick: In his eyes, she can do no wrong.",
        "Katie: He seems to love her. I mean, I just spent the whole afternoon with him, and his feelings are genuine. He loves Quinn.",
        "Rick: Yeah. That's what scares the hell out of me. And the rest of my family.",
        "Quinn: Katie Logan was here with you?",
        "Eric: Yeah. She stopped by.",
        "Quinn: Out of the blue?",
        "Eric: Well, the last time I spoke to her, she was worried about will and about him getting into a really good school, and I told her she didn't have to worry. Will's a bright, little boy. He can get into any school he wants.",
        "Quinn: So she was here before?",
        "Eric: Yesterday she came by, and so I called Westside and I spoke to the headmaster, and then today she came by to thank me and, uh, to tell me that he got accepted.",
        "Quinn: How very kind of you.",
        "Eric: She didn't really need my help. I think it just made Katie feel better. I was so excited about the showing, I forgot to mention it.",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Brooke: The buyers are excited about the collection.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. Can't complain about that. Or the press. This is the worst most successful fashion show we've ever had.",
        "Brooke: Well, it was good and it was bad.",
        "Ridge: Uh-huh. And if Quinn weren't involved, I'd be thrilled.",
        "Brooke: Your showstopper got rave reviews.",
        "Ridge: It did. But Quinn was standing up there. And mark my words, she's gonna try and take all the credit for it. When the dust settles and the numbers come in, she's gonna convince my dad it was all because of her. We're gonna be out of the loop even more.",
        "Brooke: It's not permanent.",
        "Ridge: They're married.",
        "Brooke: So? There have been other women in Eric's life, and other people have run Forrester creations. We've been through this before. I know you love Eric and you want to protect him from Quinn and protect the company. But you will. We'll get through this.",
        "Ridge: So I shouldn't worry about it.",
        "Brooke: No. How many crises have we survived? Eric will come around. When he does, we'll just add Quinn's name to the list of people who've tried to take advantage but failed. Everything's gonna work out. You'll see.",
        "Ridge: Ah, maybe you're right. I shouldn't waste my time thinking about stuff like that. There's more important things to think about.",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Rick: I'm just thrilled that will is enrolled. Got to keep up the ol' family tradition.",
        "Katie: Well, it's really all because of your father. I brought him a bottle of champagne to thank him.",
        "Rick: Well, let me guess. He said that wasn't necessary.",
        "Katie: He did, and that we should just keep it between ourselves.",
        "Rick: Oh, okay. Well, in that case, [Whispers] Go wolverines!",
        "Katie: [Laughs] It's just nice to have it off my plate. You know, now I can focus on the 10,000 other things that I have to get done. I really, really need to find a permanent home for will and me.",
        "Rick: Are you looking for something near the campus?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I want something close by, that way when he makes friends, they'll be in the neighborhood.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Oh, pfft, I had my friends over after school all the time.",
        "Katie: That sounds fantastic.",
        "Rick: Well, what have you seen so far?",
        "Katie: I have an agent, but I haven't really started looking. I just keep on putting off appointments.",
        "Rick: Well, let's see what's out there.",
        "Katie: Right now?",
        "Rick: Yeah, I've got some time before London opens.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Rick: And who knows. You might even see something that you like.",
        "Quinn: Katie wanted to thank you?",
        "Eric: Yes, but she didn't have to. It was only a phone call.",
        "Quinn: But she wanted to see you.",
        "Eric: Yes. It was very sweet, actually. She brought me a bottle of very fine champagne.",
        "Quinn: You had a drink with her?",
        "Eric: Yes, we did. A toast to will's acceptance. But water only. I worked too hard on my recovery to have a relapse at this point.",
        "Quinn: Well, that explains it.",
        "Eric: Explains what?",
        "Quinn: Two glasses downstairs, one with, uh, lipstick on the rim.",
        "Eric: Ah. That. I'm sorry. I forgot it's Linda's night off. I should have taken all that away.",
        "Quinn: Hmm.",
        "Eric: Hey. This doesn't bother you... does it?",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Rick: \"Historic charm.\" Hmm. You know what that means.",
        "Katie: No. What?",
        "Rick: Mirrored walls, shag carpet.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Rick: [Laughs] Look, there's a lot of beautiful, old homes in Beverly hills, but you and will, you guys -- you guys want something move-in ready, right?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm renovating my house. I don't want to redo my kitchen.",
        "Rick: Yeah. No, there's a few out here. Let me see. Oh, yeah. Not that one.",
        "Katie: Why not? That one looks nice. It's not too big.",
        "Rick: It's haunted.",
        "Katie: Haunted?",
        "Rick: Yeah, a buddy of mine lived there. His family moved out like three months later.",
        "Katie: Oh. Okay, next.",
        "Rick: Yeah, okay. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. No, this one. This -- this one here is your house.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Why do you say that?",
        "Rick: 371 willow hill road?",
        "Katie: That's Eric's street.",
        "Rick: [Laughing] Yeah. I practically grew up in this house. It's beautiful. My friend Ben lived there. In fact, if you were playing tennis and the ball went out of the court, it would land in their backyard.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Oh, boy. Look at the price.",
        "Rick: I'm surprised it's not more. The renovations are first class. Got an amazing view. You've got to see this.",
        "Katie: I don't know.",
        "Rick: What do you mean? You kidding me? It's perfect. Quarter mile from school, uh, big backyard, and plus you'd be right next to dad. You run out of flour, you can always go get a cup from him. He owes you. Come on. You got to check it out.",
        "Katie: Rick, come on.",
        "Rick: Text your real-estate agent. It's no obligation. Just go look at it. I think you're gonna love it. But you won't know until you see it.",
        "Eric: Does it bother you that Katie was here?",
        "Quinn: I'm just surprised you didn't mention it, that's all.",
        "Eric: Oh, I did tell you how happy I was about the fashion show, how pleased I was.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, yeah. I was, too. It was, uh, it was a wonderful day. I-I-I couldn't help wishing that you were there by my side to share it with me. Then, of course, I came home to find out that you shared it with somebody else.",
        "Eric: I would much rather have been there with you.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Listen, don't -- don't get me wrong. I'm not accusing you of anything. I trust you completely.",
        "Eric: Quinn, I want you to. I want you to know that I am, uh, I'm your devoted, faithful husband. I will always tell you the truth. Here's the truth. Katie Logan's an old friend. I've known her almost all her life. I did her a little favor, and she came by to thank me for that. Fashion show was starting. I invited her in to see it with me. She was very impressed, you know. She thought the whole presentation was -- was very innovative and unique. She loved your jewelry.",
        "Quinn: She said that?",
        "Eric: Yes, she did. Quinn, I know it hasn't been easy feeling that you're being scrutinized and attacked all the time. But Katie didn't come over here to criticize you. It seems that you have a Logan on your side.",
        "Ridge: Oh! You thought I was gonna -- no, you had a little something on the --",
        "Brooke: Ohhh, right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I'm serious, Ridge. You and bill both mean so much to me. I care about both of you.",
        "Ridge: But only one of us is in your kitchen eating ice cream.",
        "Brooke: I could ask you to leave.",
        "Ridge: You haven't.",
        "Brooke: I'm still wearing bill's ring.",
        "Ridge: We could take care of that in a jiffy.",
        "Brooke: I think that's something I should talk to him about, not to you.",
        "Ridge: Have you talked to him?",
        "Brooke: He's still upset with me.",
        "Ridge: He's upset with you? He left you at the altar.",
        "Brooke: Because you crashed our wedding.",
        "Ridge: Let's leave me out of this. That's not -- the important thing is, that he left you standing there, and now your life is on hold. Your whole family is on hold. You know how much R.J. wants this.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. That's all he seems to talk about. What about you?",
        "Ridge: What about me? I'm -- I'm here. And I brought you your favorite ice cream. Talk about commitment.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Eat it.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Oh, God.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: Thank you for this.",
        "Rick: Anything to help.",
        "Katie: Like father, like son. I'm gonna get out of your hair, okay?",
        "Rick: No, no, it's fine. I mean, I do have to run down to shipping and check on some coding.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Katie: Oh. Huh. Guess you're not the only person working late. My real estate agent Amy says she can show me the house tomorrow. That's kind of quick.",
        "Rick: It's a great house. And in this market, it's not gonna last long. You need to check it out. What do you say? I'll go with you.",
        "Katie: You will?",
        "Rick: Yeah! It'll be fun.",
        "Katie: Okay. All right. I'm in.",
        "Rick: And who knows? If you like it, you might end up being dad's next-door neighbor.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: I'm so proud of you, Quinn. You took charge of the company, and -- and you made this wonderful success for us once again.",
        "Quinn: I did it for you. But this was my first and last fashion show. I was the pinch hitter. You're gonna be back in charge at Forrester before we know it.",
        "Ridge: Ready?",
        "Brooke: Uh...no.",
        "Ridge: One more. Come on. Don't be a quitter. We're almost finished.",
        "Brooke: No. [Chuckles] Yeah, that's the problem. We ate that whole thing.",
        "Ridge: Well, then maybe... we should do something else. Or not. I'm sorry. It's okay. You -- you don't have anything to feel guilty about.",
        "Brooke: No, it's just you said so yourself. You said that I'm putting my life on hold and your life and R.J.'s, Bill's.",
        "Ridge: I don't care about Spencer. I care about you. You make the right decision for your life, your future.",
        "Brooke: And that would be you.",
        "Ridge: For sure. But I want it to be your decision when you're ready. But you know what? Bill said something, and he's right about that. You can't have two men in your life. So, when you choose your future with me, I would like for it to be Spencer-less.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] In other words, I have to make a decision.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. When you're ready. I'll be right here. I mean, right here.",
        "Brooke: Right here?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Katie: Hello?",
        "Quinn: Hi, Katie. This is Quinn Forrester.",
        "Katie: Hi, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.",
        "Katie: Uh, no. No. Um, I saw the fashion show today. It was wonderful.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. Thank you. I heard that you watched it with Eric.",
        "Katie: Yes, I did. I think Eric was very pleased at how it all turned out.",
        "Quinn: Yes. So was I. And I am really glad that Eric had company to watch the show. But, um... I don't really think it was appropriate.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. Excuse me?",
        "Quinn: Well, you coming by and entertaining my husband when you knew his wife would be away.",
        "Katie: Uh, Quinn, um, I-I really hope you don't think that...",
        "Quinn: No, no, no. Don't think I'm taking it in any wrong way. Eric told me about, uh, getting will into that fancy school, and I'm really glad everything worked out for you. But I'm just saying next time let me know that you're gonna come by. I'd like to be here. You know, we can all hang out together. I like you, Katie. I've -- I've always admired you.",
        "Katie: Thanks, Quinn. That's awfully nice of you to say that. Um, listen, Eric and I have known each other for many, many years. I don't think you need to be concerned about our friendship.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I am not concerned. It just, um... it just doesn't look good, you know, you coming by when you know I'm not gonna be here.",
        "Katie: I really think you've got this all wrong. There's no reason to feel insecure.",
        "Quinn: Oh, that's not the way I feel. I feel very secure about my marriage. I'd just like a heads up next time.",
        "Katie: Okay, then. If I overstepped, I apologize.",
        "Quinn: Thank you, Katie. I'm glad we understand each other. Bye-bye. Bitch. [Sighs]"
