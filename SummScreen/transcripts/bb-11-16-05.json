And if you don't respect me enough to put me in charge, Brooke and I are going into business together. ", "Brooke: Ridge and I have always made an incredible team. ", "Ridge: We'll give Forrester all the competition it needs. ", "Brooke: And we'll enjoy every minute of it. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*******************************************************", "Nick: You're not the one I'm here to talk to. ", "Dante: Hey, hey, hey. She doesn't want to see you, okay? She's resting right now. ", "Nick: Oh, so you're acting as bodyguard and doctor, too? ", "Dante: I promised Bridget that I was going to take care of her and the baby. ", "Nick: Well don't forget one thing -- that's my child, too. ", "Dante: After it's born, I'm sure she'll let you see the child. Until then, leave her alone! ", "Nick: You know, you're walking on thin ice with those words. ", "Dante: Haven't you caused her enough pain? Don't you get it? She doesn't trust you, okay? She doesn't want you back. She knows how you feel about Brooke. And she knows how I feel about her. ", "Nick: And how's that?", "Dante: I'm in love with her. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "**************************************************************", "Eric: I shouldn't be venting to you, Taylor. If Stephanie knew I was even in the building, she'd have a fit. ", "Taylor: Well, you're lucky she's in a meeting at the moment. ", "Eric: Do you know with whom? ", "Taylor: No. ", "Eric: God knows what she's telling our clients. Most of them are probably furious. ", "Taylor: Well, I'm sure she can deal with it. ", "Eric: Well, I'm not. Fact is, I'm not sure of anything these days. A few weeks ago our business was booming, and then, out of nowhere, my vindictive ex-wife commandeers my business and my office! ", "Taylor: I sympathize with you, Eric, I really do. I think it's safe to say, though, we're all under a great deal of stress right now. ", "Eric: Well, we shouldn't be. None of us should. Brooke and I are newlyweds -- we should be enjoying ourselves. So should you and ridge. ", "Taylor: Well, Ridge and I are in a better place than we have been in a while. ", "Eric: This new position of yours at Forrester hasn't caused any tension? ", "Taylor: He's not happy about it, but we can handle that. To tell you the truth, I can deal with just about anything, now that I don't have to worry about Ridge and Brooke.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*******************************************************************", "Stephanie: Are you going to let this tramp threaten your marriage? ", "Ridge: No one's threatening anyone, Mother. I'm offering you a choice. ", "Stephanie: Some choice! If I don't give you complete control of the company, you will deliberately destroy your marriage and your family? ", "Ridge: Brooke and I are business partners, working as a team. ", "Stephanie: This is a bluff. You will never be satisfied with a start-up company. You want Forrester Creations. ", "Ridge: You're absolutely right -- I do! But I want all of it, Mother. I've earned it, and I deserve it.", "Stephanie: And what do I deserve, honey -- after all of my years of devotion to your father? ", "Ridge: There's always going to be a place for you at Forrester -- ", "Stephanie: Oh, thank you!", "Ridge: But I should be the one who's running it. ", "Stephanie: But I've already guaranteed you that you will. I told you I would make you co-president with your brother. I promised you, in time, I will hand this company over to you. ", "Ridge: And what are you going to hand over to me, huh? I'll tell you what, you'll hand over a mess. Because I guarantee you, when you and Thorne and Taylor get through with it, that's all that's going to be left! No, Mother, I want it. And I want it now. Today. Or I swear to you, I'm out of here. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*******************************************************************", "Nick: So you're in love with my wife? ", "Dante: Yes. ", "Nick: That's understandable. She's an amazing woman. ", "Dante: She deserves to be appreciated. But you -- you've been chasing her mother. ", "Nick: And you want to protect her? Well, that's nice. But if you want to be in her life, as a friend, just stop the knight in shining armor act. Get on your horse and face the facts -- that her future is with me. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "**********************************************************************", "Eric: Well, it sounds like you and ridge are back on track. ", "Taylor: Yeah. Things couldn't be better. How's it going with you and Brooke? ", "Eric: Well -- I have to admit that things are a little dicey right now. This is a relationship built on extenuating circumstances. I want this relationship to last, Taylor, I really do. And now that nick is recommitted to Bridget, and you and Ridge are doing well, then I see no reason why it can\u2019t. ", "Taylor: You didn't see Ridge as a threat, did you? ", "Eric: No, no, not really. It's just that Brooke and I are at a very fragile place right now. Our relationship needs to be nurtured. And, if it is, I think in a few months everything could be wonderful. I can't let anything or anyone interfere with that. Look, I think in a few months we can be right where you are -- where you and ridge are -- committed. Committed to our future. But I admit, I'm a little paranoid right now. Any distraction is a threat to our future. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*******************************************************", "Ridge: Brooke and I aren't bluffing. Give me the company, or we'll start our own. ", "Stephanie: What does your husband think about this little plan of yours? What does your wife think of this? It wasn't that long ago that you were berating me for wanting to hire Taylor without discussing it with you first. And here you are, going into business with Brooke. Have you discussed it with her? What about Eric? You're always saying to me, \"you can't take the company away from him.\" And here you are, you're going to start a business, and the two of you have kept him completely out of the loop. ", "Ridge: That's not true at all. He's going to stay on as head designer. I'll just be in charge. ", "Stephanie: And it will be business as usual? You'll do the reunited ad campaign, and you will reinstate Brooke's bedroom line? ", "Ridge: I see no reason to abandon something that's been an obvious success for us. ", "Stephanie: But it wasn't that long ago that you -- you -- were concerned about her influence on this company. ", "Ridge: Ancient history, Mother. ", "Stephanie: I can only imagine how she's persuaded you to do this. Parade around in your underwear, did you? ", "Brooke: Oh, my god, Stephanie. Enough about the underwear! ", "Stephanie: As long as I am in control of Forrester Creations, you -- and your ideas -- are not welcome here. ", "Ridge: So that's it? You're not budging? As long as I work with Brooke, I'll never be CEO of Forrester, is that it? ", "Stephanie: That's right.", "Ridge: Is that why you installed Thorne as president? So you can wage your little war right here in this office against Brooke, and he won't say a thing? ", "Stephanie: I am waging a war against filth and smut. All of the things that have tarnished Forrester's image. ", "Ridge: Well, wars cost money, mother. A lot of it, too. You start investing Forrester's capital in that little game of yours, you're going to regret it. ", "Stephanie: I'm not going to touch the capital, or any capital investments. I'm going to sell the belief patent. ", "Brooke: What? You can't do that -- that's my invention! ", "Stephanie: And it's my business. I don't want any reminder of you in this company -- period. ", "", "Ridge: Okay then. I've got my answer. It's you and me, Logan. Destiny Designs is a go. ", "Stephanie: You'd better think about your wife. You really want to do this to her, and to your family?", "Ridge: It's too late, Mother. It's too late. I know what I've got to do. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "******************************************************************", "Eric: You have a box of my things. ", "Stephanie: No, actually I don't. But Megan knows where everything is. ", "Eric: Taylor says you had a meeting. ", "Stephanie: Jealous? ", "", "Eric: No. ", "Stephanie: You should be. If I were you, I would be. ", "Eric: Went that well, did it? ", "Stephanie: Not for you.", "Eric: Are you and lawyers cooking something else up for me? You've already taken my company, and my children's legacy, what else is left? ", "Stephanie: I think you might be more vulnerable than you realize. ", "Eric: Is that a threat?", "Stephanie: No, just a warning. But then, of course, a person in your position shouldn't have to be warned, should you? I mean, we all know, older man, younger woman -- ", "Eric: Leave Brooke alone.", "Stephanie: Where is that naughty little vixen? Home, trying on underwear for your next conjugal visit? You are sleeping together, aren't you? Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Have I kneed another sensitive spot? ", "Eric: Brooke and I are very happy. We're growing closer every day. ", "Stephanie: Well, you must be very close then to have given your blessing to her new endeavor. Destiny Designs? You haven't heard? She and ridge are going into business together. They're going to form a new company. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "***************************************************************************", "Brooke: I can't believe that Stephanie is going to sell belief just to start this ridiculous new line of hers. If she wanted to hurt me, it's working. ", "Ridge: Well, there's no looking back now. We've got to move forward. Look, when I proposed this bluff, we knew there was a chance it might not work, right? What if it wasn't a bluff? What if we actually did it? ", "Brooke: Start our own company? ", "Ridge: Yeah, make Destiny Designs a reality. We could do it, Logan -- you and me, together again. What do you think? ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*********************************************************************", "Dante: I don't know what you're waiting for, but I told you -- Bridget is asleep. ", "Nick: I'm waiting for you to start packing. ", "Dante: I'm not going anywhere. ", "Nick: Why am I not getting through to you? Maybe it's the language thing. I should be speaking Italian. What is it, \"ciao\" or \"adios\"? ", "Dante: Listen, I think you're the one who's not getting it, okay? I told you, Bridget is trying to move on. ", "Nick: And she will. With me. ", "Dante: Just because you ran out of options doesn't mean she has. ", "Nick: I made a commitment to Bridget and our child. ", "Dante: Bridget deserves a man who loves her for who she is, not because she's carrying your child. ", "", "Nick: Hey! I don't have to justify myself to you. ", "Dante: You won't have to justify yourself to her, either. Sooner or later, she'll see your lies and excuses, and just tell you to get lost. But, you know what, you won't have that conversation with her today. Because you are leaving. ", "Nick: I'll be back later. And I'll expect you to be gone. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "******************************************************************", "Eric: Ridge and Brooke? Their own company. Where did you hear this? ", "Stephanie: They were just in here together. They gave me an ultimatum. If I don't give ridge control of Forrester Creations, they're going to start a brand new company together. ", "", "Eric: Why would they do that? ", "Stephanie: Well, you know, it seemed to me that she was baiting me. But then I got to thinking, long nights in the executive suite, putting on shows for the press, destiny designs -- I realized they probably will achieve their destiny together right on the floor of the brand new offices. ", "Eric: That's not going to happen. ", "Stephanie: It has before.", "Eric: Ridge will respect my marriage. ", "Stephanie: Your marriage is a sham. She's already looking for new conquests. I wouldn't be surprised if she was home conquering him right now. ", "Eric: I'm not going to listen to this, not from you. ", "Stephanie: Make sure you knock before you barge in! You old fool! ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "************************************************************", "[ Lamp falling ] ", "", "Nick: Sorry. ", "Bridget: Nick? ", "Nick: You were sleeping, weren't you? ", "Bridget: What are you doing here? ", "Nick: I had to see you.", "Bridget: If this is about last night, I'm pretty sure that everybody said everything they needed to say.", "Nick: Well I didn't.", "Bridget: Nick, I know that you think you want to try to get back, but -- ", "Nick: No, I said what I had to say to you. I'm here because I'd like to have a word with my child. You mind? Excuse me, but this is a private conversation. ", "Bridget: Oh, of course, go ahead. ", "Nick: Hey -- whatever your name is gonna be. It's your dad. And I'm here to give you a little advice -- stay in there as long as you can. It's nice and warm, and safe, just floating around. Instead of choppy seas with me and your mom out here, so -- but that's not for you to think about right now. Hopefully, I'll have that all smoothed out by the time you make your big entrance. Or exit, depending on how you look at it. I'll be right there to catch you. And I'll put you in your mom's arms. Just the three of us, together, that's how I want it. No doctors or hospitals, drugs, epidurals, none of that. We just need a nice, sharp knife and a bucket of hot water, and some clean towels. We can do it on the Shady Marlin -- that's my boat. You know, water births are really big now, you know? I guess what I'm trying to say is, I sure hope the three of us are together when you come around. Actually, that's all that matters -- that we're together. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "*************************************************************", "Brooke: Ridge, it's a good idea, but we've tried that before. ", "Ridge: It'd be different this time. We'll start from scratch, build it from the ground up. ", "Brooke: That means a lot of work, and more hours for us. ", "Ridge: That never bothered you before. ", "Brooke: Yes, but it might bother Taylor, and even your father. ", "Ridge: Oh, you're sounding like my mother now. ", "Brooke: You're just finding your footing with Taylor again. And Eric and I, we're just beginning.", "Ridge: You shouldn't be married, you know that. ", "Brooke: Let's just focus on business, okay? ", "Ridge: He doesn't make you happy, neither does Nick. ", "Brooke: It's a complicated situation. ", "Ridge: It's always complicated when we're not together, you know that. ", "Brooke: Ridge, it was complicated when we were together. ", "Ridge: But you were happy.", "Brooke: See? This is why we have to be careful. We could fall into the same old patterns. ", "Ridge: I'm not going to let that happen. But we can't deny the chemistry, Logan. I mean, it's always going to be there. That's what makes us a great team. ", "Brooke: Yeah, well, it's too dangerous. ", "Ridge: I think we just have to be honest about it. You're right, we have to talk about this with Taylor, and with dad. But the thing we have to think about and decide -- can we do this? ", "Brooke: I'm not sure I can. I want to, I do. I want to help. And I want to stop Stephanie from destroying Forrester. But I just don't think I can go into another battle with your mother. I've had so much on my mind lately, with the finances, and the kids, and my marriage. And, you know, hope had a play at school last week, and I totally forgot about it. I just didn't show up. And then, of course, this thing happened with my arm -- there's so much going on that I just can't even deal with. Ridge, I don't know -- ", "Ridge: Hey, Logan, Logan, Logan. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay, you are definitely overwhelmed here. You need to take a few breaths, just slow down -- breathe, breathe -- ", "Brooke: Yeah -- ", "", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Let her go, Ridge. I said get your hands off my wife! "], "Transcript Author": [], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtazMjVevj8"}
