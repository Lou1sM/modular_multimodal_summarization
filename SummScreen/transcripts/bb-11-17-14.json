He is wrong the way he is treating her now is unacceptable. Caroline said she did this so she can not make excuses for him, he has that right. Ridge says yes they made a big mistake but not even Rick has a right to talk to her that way. She says Maya is right there to pick up the pieces, she has a Forrester now. Rick gives Maya another present, a gorgeous set of large diamond earrings. She tries them on but he says they clash with the dress she has on, in fact everything she has on.

He calls and makes a flight. He tells Hope that he is sorry. He realizes now that it looked like he was meddling, but he did it for all of them. He did it for his brother but for them too so they could be alone .the sad puppy faces and looks across the room had to stop. He says she said she wants Liam to move on so she should be okay with this. Ivy can do them a favor. He did not threaten them or hurt anybody so what did it hurt.",
        "Liam asks Ivy how did she know he needed this trip? She laments she knows it was not easy having a front row seat being with Hope and Wyatt but she hopes it has been worth it. Wyatt makes the flight and he and Hope are out of Amsterdam. She comments this has been a very difficult trip for her but she did see Liam kissing Ivy so that seems to be his future. She is sorry she was so upset with Wyatt. She puts her hands in his and squeezes it. Eric cut his trip short and tells Ridge and Caroline their designs on paper were great but even more fantastic on the actual gowns. They are a fantastic team. Liam shows Ivy to her room and it is all romanticized with candles all aglow. He pretends to be tired from steering the boat and is going to leave. She grabs him and tells him not to even think about that. She pulls him in for a kiss. Rick holds Maya in his lap but thinks of the day he met Caroline and when he proposed. She says Caroline betrayed his trust. She tricked him. Eric tells Caroline he wants those designs to take FC back where they used to be. They can fix this with Rick and they will. Just do the work, that's all. Liam tells Ivy that she has a cute giggle, she's smart, pretty and classy and that accent .suddenly he realizes he doesn't think he can live without all of that. They continue to kiss and he pours more champagne. Hope feels badly as she accused Wyatt of being like his mother. He says it is those pregnant hormones. He accepts it and now they just need to focus on their baby. She sheds a few tears as she thinks of Liam, then the leap of faith with Wyatt and seeing her baby's sonogram. Liam calls attention to something new about him. Ivy picks up on it and sees it is the necklace she made for him. He is wearing the new version of the sword necklace. He says it is a new beginning for him and he will wear it all the time and see the changes in his life starting right now."

        "Hope: [Gasps]",
        "Maya: What's that for?",
        "Rick: Can't the CEO have a drink in his office?",
        "Maya: Sure he can. I just hate seeing you so angry.",
        "Rick: You don't think I have a right to be?",
        "Maya: You have a lot more reasons not to be. Don't you?",
        "Rick: I'm not angry with you. It's Ridge and Caroline. The way that he went to her defense, as if she was some kind of victim.",
        "Maya: They are not your problem anymore. Why do you still let them get to you like this?",
        "Caroline: Rick still loves me.",
        "Ridge: He's got a strange way of showing it.",
        "Caroline: I hurt him.",
        "Ridge: I understand that. And mistakes were made and... I'm not denying it, but... but he's wrong. The way he's treating you right now is unacceptable.",
        "Caroline: I'm not making excuses for him.",
        "Ridge: Mm, you kind of are.",
        "Caroline: I did this. I made Rick act that way.",
        "Ridge: No, you didn't.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Rick lost control. He's berating you like he's some child with a tantrum. He can't do that anymore. He's a grown man. He should know better.",
        "Caroline: Can't you say the same about us? Didn't we know better?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. We should have. Made a mistake. But, hey... nobody, not even Rick, gets to talk to you that way. I'm not gonna allow it.",
        "Hope: Hey. I want to go home.",
        "Wyatt: Come on, Hope. We can work this out.",
        "Hope: No, it's -- it's just the shoot is over. You know, there's really no reason for us to be here anymore.",
        "Wyatt: Fine. But the jet's unavailable.",
        "Hope: Okay, well, can you book us a flight?",
        "Wyatt: Sure. What about Liam and Ivy?",
        "Hope: I don't care. Let them stay. Enjoy themselves.",
        "Wyatt: If that's what you want.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] That is a boat ride I will not soon forget.",
        "Liam: Yeah, sights and sounds of Amsterdam.",
        "Ivy: Well, that, too, I guess.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: Maya's the one that doesn't respect me. She never has.",
        "Ridge: But she didn't force Rick to leave you.",
        "Caroline: No. But she was right there waiting when he did. And now she's got him. She's got her Forrester.",
        "Maya: What can I do to cheer you up?",
        "Rick: By letting me do something for you.",
        "Maya: Mm? What's this?",
        "Rick: Open it.",
        "Maya: Another present? [Chuckles] Diamonds.",
        "Rick: You like them?",
        "Maya: They're gorgeous. I love them. [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: Go ahead. Try them on.",
        "[Lock engages]",
        "Maya: Well?",
        "Rick: The diamonds are beautiful, but they clash with that dress.",
        "Maya: Really?",
        "Rick: In fact, they clash with everything that you're wearing.",
        "Wyatt: Dank je wel. What time do we need to be there to check in? Thanks. All right. We'll be there. I just booked us a flight.",
        "Hope: Okay, your suitcase is on the bed.",
        "Wyatt: Hope, I'm sorry. I know that it seems like I was meddling by hiring the boat for Ivy and Liam.",
        "Hope: I just thought you were hiring it for us.",
        "Wyatt: I -- I planned a romantic evening right here.",
        "Hope: Not before you planned theirs, made sure they were alone first.",
        "Wyatt: To get them out of our hair! I'm sorry. I can't tiptoe around this anymore. Yes, I wanted to do something nice for my brother. But I also did it for us. I want Liam to move on. I want us all to move on. Don't you? Aren't you sick of the sad puppy faces? Those looks of regret and remorse from across the room? And if Ivy can help in that and if Ivy can do something about that, then why don't we just let her do us a favor? And maybe I got a little impatient. But come on. I just got them a private boat ride to see Amsterdam. I didn't threaten anybody. No one was in danger. I mean, really. Who did it hurt?",
        "Liam: How did you know?",
        "Ivy: Know what?",
        "Liam: That this trip was exactly what I needed.",
        "Ivy: I just -- I just knew.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Ivy: Look, I know that the four of us traveling together -- you've had front- row seats to the newlyweds. I know that that hasn't been easy for you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know, but -- but you -- you've got me looking to the future now.",
        "Ivy: Future?",
        "Liam: With you. With you, Ivy Forrester, the newest supermodel of Forrester creations.",
        "Ivy: [Laughing] I know. I can't believe I did that.",
        "Liam: I know!",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] You know what? If they don't use a single shot, I'll be fine with it.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Ivy: In fact, I actually hope that they don't use a single shot.",
        "Liam: Stop it.",
        "Ivy: Oh, my gosh. So much has happened to me in such a short period of time. I moved from Australia. I'm working at Forrester creations now. I met you. My love.",
        "Ridge: Come here.",
        "Caroline: I don't want to draw right now. And we're not -- we're not doing that anymore.",
        "Ridge: I just want your opinion on something.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Eric: There you are.",
        "Ridge: Hey, you're back.",
        "Eric: Yeah, I cut my trip short. Look, I want to talk to you about the collection.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm not changing anything.",
        "Eric: No. No, you're not. Look, these designs -- they were fantastic on paper, but now that I see the actual gowns? These are absolutely groundbreaking. You two are one hell of a team.",
        "Rick: Whew.",
        "Maya: [Sighs, chuckles] That was unexpected. [Laughs]",
        "Rick: I was gonna surprise you at dinner.",
        "Maya: Well, I'm glad you didn't wait.",
        "Rick: You've waited long enough. I never realized what I had with you, how lucky I was. I've just been let down so many times in my life -- amber, my father.",
        "Maya: Caroline.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I asked her to quit. She wouldn't.",
        "Maya: If she loved you as much as she claims she does, she would have.",
        "Rick: I defended her.",
        "Maya: Because that's the kind of man you are. As long as she was loyal to you, you were gonna stick by her. But she wasn't loyal, Rick. And you don't owe her anything. You don't have space in your life for people like that anymore. You have me now. All of me. Always.",
        "Wyatt: You've barely said a word since we left the hotel.",
        "Hope: I've just been thinking. I don't have to tell you that this...was a really difficult trip for me.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I know. And I could have made it easier for you. I should have been more focused on you. The boat ride was such a bad idea, I guess.",
        "Hope: When I went out onto the balcony before we left... I saw Liam and Ivy's boat. And they were kissing.",
        "Wyatt: How did that make you feel?",
        "Hope: Guilty. I shouldn't have overreacted. And I'm sorry.",
        "Ivy: Well, here we are.",
        "Liam: Allow me, please. Please.",
        "Ivy: Hey, thanks for a wonderful day today.",
        "Liam: Oh. Is it over? Yeah, no, I'm sure. I'm sure you, uh...want to get some sleep.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Liam!",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Ivy: I mean, how did you do this?",
        "Liam: I, uh... I got friends in high places.",
        "Ivy: Oh, really?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Well, you know, it's pretty late. I'm getting pretty tired, too. All the walking and the boating and the, you know, photographing. So I'm gonna go ahead.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, don't -- [Chuckles] Don't you dare.",
        "Maya: Caroline tricked you, Rick. She gained your trust and then she betrayed you. I never will.",
        "Caroline: You want me to keep working with Ridge.",
        "Eric: What I want is for these designs to take this company back where it used to be.",
        "Caroline: You think the collection is that good?",
        "Eric: I think that this is a real moment for Forrester creations.",
        "Caroline: But Rick --",
        "Eric: We can fix that. We can fix that!",
        "Caroline: I -- I don't know that you can.",
        "Eric: Well, we can. All of us. And we will.",
        "Ridge: Dad.",
        "Eric: Just...do the work. And that's all.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Caroline: Did that just happen?",
        "Ivy: Okay, so -- so when did you do this? How did you do this?",
        "Liam: Well, I didn't set up the boat, so I...just wanted to show you how much I appreciate you.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Liam: Your strength and your support and your grace. And your modesty.",
        "Ivy: Yes. Yes. Go on.",
        "Liam: And...",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Liam: And your giggle. That giggle. That one right there. Your accent. Mm. It's -- I don't know. It's funny. It's amazing how quickly these things have become something I don't think I can live without.",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "Hope: The way I reacted wasn't fair. I'm sorry. I accused you of being like your mother. I acted -- I don't know --",
        "Wyatt: You're a stressed-out pregnant lady.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Beautiful and gorgeous. I like this stressed-out pregnant lady. [Chuckles] [Sniffles] I don't think we can blame this on hormones.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] No, but, you know, having Liam around was hard. I get it. And then we're heading home. We have to focus on our marriage. That baby inside of you -- that's our future.",
        "Hope: Yeah. That's what I want. That's what I want to do.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Hope: [Sighs] [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Back.",
        "Ivy: Hey. You look a little mischievous.",
        "Liam: You know, I was going for \"mysterious,\" but I like the way you say \"mischievous\" better.",
        "Ivy: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Notice anything different?",
        "Ivy: Well, yeah, everything is different.",
        "Liam: No, no. Go a little more specific.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] You're wearing the necklace I made you.",
        "Liam: Yeah. First time I've worn it.",
        "Ivy: What, is it a special occasion?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. In a way. This is, um... it's a new beginning for me, and I'm gonna wear this all the time now, as a reminder of you. A symbol of the change you've made in my life. A life that, in a lot of ways, is starting right now. What do you say, mate?",
        "Ivy: Aye, aye, captain.",
