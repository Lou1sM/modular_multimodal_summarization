    ],
    "Recap": [
        "Ivy tells Thomas that he can not kiss her like that. He reminds her that he seems to remember her kissing him back. And yes he invited her to model the dress thinking she might need help in showing him how she felt about him. Steffy laments to Wyatt that her dad is way harder on Thomas than he has been on her. Wyatt reminds her that she used to be someone else until she got hooked up with Liam again. He is not coming on to her but he is just pointing out life's little ironies that at one time he thought she was interested in him. She says she still does appreciate him. He's cute and sexy and smart. He says yes at times he thinks they would have been a good team. She's not sure there is one perfect match but she goes home and there he is. Bill and Katie drop in on Liam and Bill says one word \u0096 Greece, not the movie but the country, he wants him to go tonight. Liam points his finger and says he is not hijacking him tonight. Liam says someone else can do this but not him. Bill says it has to be a Spencer.",
        "Ivy says she could be offended if she thought about it. Thomas says he knows she thinks he is hot. She says yes but she sees a lot of hot men and she does not want to put her hands on all of them or take their clothes off. She knows he is not interested in her but just in hurting Wyatt and those Spencer boys. He would like to put them in their place. Thomas says Wyatt has nothing to do with it. All he does is work with rocks. Liam dumped her and she was convenient for Wyatt to swoop in. She says it did not happen like that at all and she is very happy with Wyatt. He still maintains that he dazzles her just a little. She says he knows nothing about her at all or what makes her tick. He says even on her worst day she outshines everyone else. He just wants to kiss her as she drives him nuts. Bill offers Liam the jet for his night out with Steffy. Liam nixes that idea, he wants to be alone with Steffy here at home. Katie finishes up the dozen roses arrangement complete with white bow and says she thinks Liam must be going to propose to Steffy. Wyatt questions Ivy of how it went with Thomas. She says he was all right but she was a little uncomfortable. Thomas tells Steffy that Ivy is pretending to be mad at him but he knows she is not as she kissed him back. Liam tells Bill that he doesn't want just to fall into marriage like most expect of him. They have gone from the impossible to the possible. He does not want a skywriter but still not just the ordinary. Ivy tells Wyatt he is so wonderful and she does not feel she is exactly a good girlfriend. Steffy tells Thomas that everyone knows that Wyatt is with Ivy so do not even think of moving in there or undressing her with his eyes. He wants to make a wager that he can do Ivy. Wyatt asks if there is something Ivy wants to tell him. She says kiss her and not ask if Thomas kissed her."

        "Ivy: [Sighs] Why do you think you can do that?",
        "Thomas: Because you let me.",
        "Ivy: Because I'm not screaming or busting down a door, you think that gives you permission?",
        "Thomas: I'm not keeping you from going out that door right now.",
        "Ivy: You know, I'm beginning to think you may not be a very nice person, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: I have big ambitions. Being nice isn't always one of them.",
        "Ivy: You can't do that. You can't kiss me like that.",
        "Thomas: It's funny. I seem to remember you kissing me back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Dad? He's not here. Neither is Thomas.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Well, maybe the two of them took a few of the models out for drinks, huh?",
        "Steffy: Okay, can you not compare Thomas to my father?",
        "Wyatt: You seriously don't see it?",
        "Steffy: Okay, Thomas might be exactly like my father's younger self...",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: ...But my dad has worked really hard to put those times behind him. That's probably why he's tough on Thomas, way more than he's even been with me.",
        "Wyatt: Or it could be because Thomas is a spoiled, manipulative little brat.",
        "Steffy: Aww, poor Wyatt. So unappreciated.",
        "Wyatt: Hey. You used to appreciate me, at one time or another, as I recall.",
        "Steffy: Okay, nobody says that you have to like my brother.",
        "Wyatt: Nobody said you had to move in with mine, either.",
        "Steffy: Okay, are we changing the subject? What -- what is the subject even about?",
        "Wyatt: You. You. I mean, what -- what happened to you? You used to be this wild, crazy, fun girl doing great things at Forrester International in Paris. And then you come back to L.A. And what? You're driving to work with Liam. You're driving back to Malibu with Liam. You're having these little espresso shots on Saturday with Liam.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I mean, wasn't there someone you used to want to be?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: \"Strip off all leaves below water line.\" Okay.",
        "Bill: Son!",
        "Liam: I meant to close that. Yeah.",
        "Katie: Does your gardener know you cut all those flowers?",
        "Bill: I have one word for you -- Greece. Not the movie, the country.",
        "Liam: What about it?",
        "Bill: You're going there. Tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Like Hell I am.",
        "Katie: You got to ease him into it. How do you expect him to react to that?",
        "Bill: With gratitude for the opportunity.",
        "Liam: Unh, unh, unh, unh. You are not hijacking me, not today.",
        "Katie: See, there's this magazine in Greece --",
        "Bill: Very popular tabloid, right up Spencer's alley.",
        "Katie: Circulation within the millions, published in three different languages.",
        "Liam: Okay. What do you need me for? Buy it. Wire them the money.",
        "Bill: Can't do it. They want an actual Spencer there shaking hands with the publisher on the front page.",
        "Liam: Okay. So, get Wyatt or Caroline.",
        "Bill: They don't work for me.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Karen. Katie. Katie can do it. What? They said no? All right. You go. You go.",
        "Bill: I shake hands with heads of state, not publishers. Except maybe Rupert, if I'm in a good mood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: So I'm boring now.",
        "Wyatt: Domesticated.",
        "Steffy: Because of Liam?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. I mean, does anyone ever say that Liam is a party animal or adventurous or spontaneous, even?",
        "Steffy: Oh. Oh, I see.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Unlike you. So, what you're saying is my life would be way different if I had taken a ride with you? You better hope Ivy is way more than loyal than you are to her.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs] Okay, I-I-I am not coming on to you. I am just pointing out life's little...ironies. And on that note, I am gonna get back to work.",
        "Steffy: Wait. Did you ever stop to think that a restless party girl, which I used to be, isn't as restless when she has what she wants?",
        "Wyatt: Fair point.",
        "Steffy: Still... doesn't mean I don't appreciate you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Can we talk about this honestly for a minute?",
        "Ivy: Oh, honestly. You mean, like, convincing me to come up here for a fitting, honestly?",
        "Thomas: Okay, so I wanted a reason to kiss you.",
        "Ivy: Being honest about a lie doesn't count, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Oh, I just thought you needed help.",
        "Ivy: Help to do what?",
        "Thomas: Show me the way you really feel.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Well, I'm sure you guys can find your way out. Hint, hint. Door's over there. Thank you, Katie, for coming over.",
        "Bill: And you're criticizing my manners?",
        "Katie: I am gonna take a wild shot in the dark and say that Liam's probably got something going on tonight, so we should just go.",
        "Bill: That involve the entire contents of his refrigerator?",
        "Liam: Hey! Florists put flowers in refrigerators. Don't they?",
        "Bill: What is with the flower arranging? Why don't you get a florist?",
        "Liam: I can't do that. This has to be personal.",
        "Bill: Steffy's not gonna give a damn. What, you -- what's going on with your hand? You -- you have blood specks on it.",
        "Liam: They're thorny.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Okay. All right. Just step aside. Let me.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Tell me more. How do you appreciate me, exactly?",
        "Steffy: Well, you're cute and you're smart.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Steffy: Hey, I don't know.",
        "Wyatt: Well, it takes one to know one, sweetheart.",
        "Steffy: You're consistent.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Steffy: And I like that in men.",
        "Wyatt: Dare I say I see a few bumps on the road ahead for you and my brother?",
        "Steffy: Oh, really?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Sometimes I think that you and I would have been a good couple. But then sometimes... I think every day might have been a dual to the death.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Well, sometimes I think there's no such thing as one perfect match.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Steffy: But then I go home every night, and there he is.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I wonder.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Wyatt: Well, I don't want to jinx it. But I wonder if Ivy could be that for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I think I would be offended if I actually knew what you were talking about.",
        "Thomas: Okay, um, I'll try again. You think I'm hot.",
        "Ivy: So what? So what, Thomas? The world is full of attractive people. You just happen to be one of them. Every single woman in this office would agree, and probably a third of the men.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: I mean, look, I walk past good-looking people here all day, every day. It doesn't mean I want to put my hands all over them or trick them into somehow taking their clothes off.",
        "Thomas: I don't think it's that big of a deal. I mean, you -- you've seen the way that I look at you.",
        "Ivy: You look at every female that way. The only reason I've tolerated it for so long is because we're cousins.",
        "Thomas: Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not actually family. We're not blood related. And we've seen each other, what, twice in our entire lives until you moved here?",
        "Ivy: Okay. All right. I haven't really been counting.",
        "Thomas: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: And yes, you're right. We're more like strangers than we are like family. Which is why you have to stop pretending that you can read my mind. Because you can't.",
        "Thomas: It wasn't your mind I was reading.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Thomas... you're not interested in me. You're interested in hurting Wyatt. You think those Spencer boys have gotten too big for their boots. And us Forresters -- we're cool and we're classy and we're cultured. And Spencer money is just tacky and it's built on sensationalized headlines, right? And you want to put Wyatt and Liam in their place, which, in your mind, is second place. It's something like that, right? That's what you're trying to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Wyatt?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas: He's not even in the equation for me. He does, what, order rocks? And pick up women that his brother's dumped and try to marry them, if he can.",
        "Ivy: Wow. That's really ugly, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: But is it untrue? Come on. Maybe I'm trying to save you from that fate.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt loves me.",
        "Thomas: Does he, though? Or are you just convenient?",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Thomas: Look, Liam dumped you the way that Liam does, okay? And -- and then Wyatt swoops in, being all sympathetic and the almost-familiar shoulder for you to cry on. He prevented you from having to be alone. All right? From moving forward, from dating again. Enter me, from Paris.",
        "Ivy: It didn't happen like that at all, actually. Wyatt and I are very happy together.",
        "Thomas: Are you, though? Would you be standing here, trying to convince me of that?",
        "Ivy: Okay, look, do I have to remind you that I'm not Charlotte the intern. You don't exactly dazzle me, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I do. Just a little.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] Okay. All right. What is it? Tell me. What is it that you're so interested in with me? I mean, you don't know me. You don't know what makes me tick. You actually don't know anything about me at all.",
        "Thomas: Maybe knowing is overrated. All right? You walk into a room, and something changes inside of me.",
        "Ivy: Oh, come on. That doesn't happen.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, it does. Look, even on your worst day, you outclass everyone in the room.",
        "Ivy: Well, that's because Americans like to romanticize accents.",
        "Thomas: You don't have to say a word. I can't help but look at you.",
        "Ivy: No. Don't.",
        "Thomas: I just want to kiss you. You drive me nuts.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, you must be nuts to think that anything would ever happen between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Why didn't you just say you were planning a special night with Steffy?",
        "Liam: Uh... sorry. Thought it'd be obvious.",
        "Katie: Boys, boys, boys...",
        "Bill: I'm offering you the jet.",
        "Liam: Thank you. I'm staying home.",
        "Bill: Gee. A night on the couch. What more could a girl want? You could wake up tomorrow morning on the Stella Maris. Breakfast in bed, fresh coffee, fruit, croissants.",
        "Liam: Dad...",
        "Bill: Then you stroll on the deck with Steffy.",
        "Liam: Dad...",
        "Bill: Surrounded by the Aegean.",
        "Bill: Dad, no croissants! No fruit. I'm not going to Greece.",
        "Katie: I'm not too keen on flying ten time zones for my cup of coffee, either.",
        "Bill: Why am I being ganged up on for trying to do something nice?!",
        "Katie: All right. There you go. Voil\u00e0.",
        "Liam: Thank you, Katie.",
        "Katie: What? Looks like you think it should be adjusted.",
        "Liam: N-no. Uh...just... [Sighs] It feels like something's missing.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] For God's sake, do you have any ribbon?",
        "Liam: [Gasps] Ribbon. Yes. Uh...I think Steffy has some from a thing I gave her. And white -- white is good. White is really appropriate for -- for what --",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. You're gonna propose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Hey.",
        "Ivy: Oh, hey.",
        "Wyatt: How'd it go?",
        "Ivy: How did what go?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, the fitting.",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah, yeah. It was -- it was all right, I guess.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Oh, is that the gown?",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. It's nice.",
        "Ivy: Mm. Yeah. He's, uh -- he's pretty talented.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I guess he's good for something, right?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Eh, Thomas is all right.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, can I see it on?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, you know what? I'm kind of over it.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. So, he, uh, behaved himself?",
        "Ivy: Oh. [Chuckles] Yeah. It's just -- the whole thing kind of made me feel uncomfortable.",
        "Wyatt: Stop. Don't do that.",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Wyatt: Put yourself down like, \"I'm not a model.\" Okay? Because you are as good and more beautiful than anyone in this building. Okay? Why? What did you think I meant?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Where did you come from?",
        "Thomas: Nowhere.",
        "Steffy: Oh, God. How was whatever you were doing with Ivy?",
        "Thomas: Oh, I'm a genius.",
        "Steffy: Was that Ivy's expert opinion?",
        "Thomas: Well, it probably is by now, but she was pretending to be mad at me.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, she goes from zero to 60. Why is she mad now?",
        "Thomas: Oh, that when I kissed her, she kissed back.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You can't tell anybody.",
        "Bill: What are you worried about? People already think you're married.",
        "Liam: I know. I hate that.",
        "Bill: You know what? Think of it as -- as a-a testament to how...right and natural it is between the two of you.",
        "Katie: Aww. Sometimes you say the sweetest things.",
        "Liam: It's -- it's not, though. It's not. I don't want to just fall into marriage because that's what everybody expects of me. I want it to be big and romantic and life-changing, and I want it to make us excited to wake up every morning.",
        "Bill: You're not now?",
        "Liam: That's not what I'm saying. But when Steffy first came to town, I mean, there was a part of me -- I'm sure there was a part of her, too -- that thought it would be impossible for us to ever get back together again. And then, suddenly, it was possible. So, here we go, from impossible to -- to ordinary. You know? Brush your teeth, set up the coffee maker, don't hog the covers.",
        "Katie: Well, there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, routine can be wonderful.",
        "Liam: Not -- no. Not this. Tonight can't be routine.",
        "Bill: I'll hire a skywriter.",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Thank you. But it's supposed to rain.",
        "Bill: I'll stop the rain.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: All right, listen. Again, Stella Maris.",
        "Liam: I'm not going to Greece.",
        "Bill: You have a ring?",
        "Liam: I do. I have a ring. I have roses. What I don't have is an original thought in my head.",
        "Bill: All right. Stop that. You're a wonderful son.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Hey, are you -- you all right?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Yeah, I guess sometimes I just -- I don't feel like a very good girlfriend.",
        "Wyatt: What are you talking about?",
        "Ivy: Well... it's just, Wyatt, you're so good to me, you know? And I don't know what I bring to the party.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, you. You. You are the party. You are the -- I'm just gonna dance all around you. That's what it is.",
        "Ivy: Oh, I love you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: You keep doing that. You need to tell him that you want to keep that dress, because that is something else. That is -- that is so you.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, that's what -- that's what Thomas said.",
        "Wyatt: I'm sorry. What? What? What do you mean?",
        "Ivy: Well, he said that while he was designing it, he was thinking of me.",
        "Wyatt: Yuck. You tell him to think about the interns. That's it. That's all he's allowed to think about.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt...",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm? I'm kidding. I'm jo-- it's a joke.",
        "Ivy: Can you remind me of something?",
        "Wyatt: What? What's that?",
        "Ivy: Can you remind me of -- of what we're wishing for?",
        "Wyatt: What we're wishing and hoping for?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: What we have. That's what we're wishing for, isn't it?",
        "Steffy: Are you informing me of something or just being disgusting?",
        "Thomas: Disgusting? It was a - it was a kiss.",
        "Steffy: Okay, can you find another superpower that doesn't put the moves on women who don't belong to you?",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] Belong? What century is this?",
        "Steffy: Everyone knows that Wyatt is with Ivy. They are in a relationship. And he is a really nice guy. Don't think about hurting him.",
        "Thomas: Oh. Women marry nice guys. They don't have affairs with them.",
        "Steffy: You...[Chuckles] Are not having an affair with Ivy.",
        "Thomas: You want to bet?",
        "Steffy: What are you, like, 12? You're, like, regressing in front of my eyes.",
        "Thomas: Right back down the evolutionary ladder. That's me.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Right back down to being the player that you were in high school.",
        "Thomas: You know, you lost all the bets then, too. Don't you want to end your losing streak?",
        "Steffy: I'm not gonna bet you on doing Ivy. End of story.",
        "Thomas: I will take that as a yes. [Clicks tongue]",
        "Steffy: Ugh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You need to go home early?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, and -- maybe. I...",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Is -- is there something you want to tell me?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Yeah, don't -- don't make me.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, now you have to tell me. Because you're gonna be messing with my mind all night. So, you got to tell me now.",
        "Ivy: Don't make me tell you to kiss me."
