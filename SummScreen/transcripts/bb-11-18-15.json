    "Recap": [
        "Thomas won't let up. He keeps badgering Steffy to bet with him that he can be successful in taking Ivy away from Wyatt. Quinn and Wyatt have an overnight business trip and he kisses Ivy and says he needs a few more of those to tide him over. He wishes she could go along but she laments she has designs due on Ridge's desk tomorrow morning, so no can do. He does warn her to stay clear of Thomas as much as she can while he is gone. She even says she will not spend the night in the beach house as being alone there would creep her out. She will stay with Uncle Eric at his house. Katie congratulates Liam, and Bill is happy. He always said that Steffy was the woman for him and now he is going to do something about it. So don't screw this up. He just hopes Wyatt will be as smart in finding his woman. Katie says perhaps he already has.",
        "Steffy won't make the bet with Thomas, not for money, dinner, nothing. She sees how happy Wyatt and Ivy are and thinks this is wrong. He takes that as a challenge. Besides Wyatt has not put a ring on her finger so Thomas feels justified in going after anyone he wants. Steffy tells him this is not a game. She sees Wyatt before he leaves for San Francisco and asks about him and Ivy. He wishes she were going with him but can't this time. Thomas hangs up from talking to a late night booty call when Ivy walks into the house. Steffy walks into the cliff house with lighted candles everywhere and dozens of roses. She thanks Liam while kissing him, then goes to change into something more comfortable. Liam can tell her mind is still at the office and he wants all of her. She mentions Wyatt and Ivy and he sees she cares about them too. Liam laments he thinks they are good together also. Wyatt is a good guy even though he is misguided at times. Ivy comes downstairs to find that Thomas wanted to share a special meal with her since it is her first time back in a while. He has ordered her favorite meal from a restaurant and pours drinks and wants to offer a toast. She asks about the phone call she heard him hang up on. He wonders if she is jealous. He says he cancelled those plans the second he saw her walk through the door. He can not stop thinking about their kiss and here they are alone in this big old house and it could be a night to remember."

        "Thomas: Then why the hesitation? All right, if you're so sure of Ivy's commitment to Wyatt, then bet me. Bet me. Bring it.",

        "Thomas: Then do what you always do. Call my bluff.",
        "Steffy: No, this doesn't -- this doesn't feel right, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Look, all I'm asking you to do is own your position. You don't think I can take Ivy away from Wyatt. I know I can. Bet me.",

        "Wyatt: Oh, I needed that.",
        "Ivy: Well, it wasn't a hardship.",

        "Katie: Congratulations.",
        "Bill: I couldn't be happier, son. Haven't I always told you that Steffy's the woman for you? I'm glad you're finally doing something about it.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Well, it hasn't been a straight road. Steffy and I have had a lot of ups and downs. But hey, what that's taught me is that I don't want to live without her. So, tonight I ask Steffy to marry me. She'll say no.",
        "Katie: So, are you nervous?",
        "Liam: Uh...[Chuckles] Maybe a little.",
        "Bill: Steffy's not gonna say no, Liam.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Yeah, no chance of that.",
        "Liam: Well, I don't want to assume. I mean, I'm reasonably sure she'll say yes, but, uh, there could be something else going on.",
        "Katie: Like what?",
        "Bill: Another guy?",
        "Liam: No, not that. No. Steffy's with me and only me. But the female mind is a mysterious thing, and just when you think you know all the answers, you're ducking a curveball, so...",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, I don't think you have to worry about that.",
        "Liam: Yeah. And I'm not. I'm not. I mean, Steffy and I do belong together, and we both know that.",

        "Ivy: San Francisco?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, Mom and I have to go meet with some West Coast suppliers.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Why wouldn't she tell me that?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, have you checked your messages?",
        "Ivy: Uh, no, not recently.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. There you go.",
        "Ivy: So, how long are you gone for?",
        "Wyatt: It shouldn't be longer than overnight. Unless you come with me.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, why -- why don't you come? We'll make it a long weekend. We'll rent a car, go to Big Sur.",
        "Ivy: Ooh! I haven't been there yet! I'd love that!",
        "Wyatt: Okay, well, then pack a bag, you know? I'll -- I'll tell the jet to wait.",
        "Ivy: Look, it's really tempting, but Ridge wants new designs on his desk by end of work day tomorrow, and now that you guys are going, I'm gonna have to stay here and do everything.",
        "Wyatt: I know, I know. It was -- it was worth a shot.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Okay, we can bet anything you want. Money, uh, dinners, mundane tasks.",
        "Steffy: I'm not making this stupid bet.",
        "Thomas: Why not?",
        "Steffy: Because it's childish.",
        "Thomas: Oh, come on. We've made tons of bets as adults.",
        "Steffy: Okay, but this one is just wrong. I was with Wyatt earlier, and he and Ivy seem genuinely happy together.",
        "Thomas: Well, if they are solid, then, you know, nothing I do will matter.",
        "Steffy: Okay, are you targeting him?",
        "Thomas: What's that even mean?",
        "Steffy: It means that you said you have issues with anyone named Spencer.",
        "Thomas: Okay, may-- maybe this is all about Wyatt for you, but this is all about Ivy for me. And until he puts a ring on it...",
        "Steffy: Wow. No, you need to back off. Wyatt is a really good guy, and he doesn't deserve you going after his girlfriend just to prove you can. And little miss prim and proper, she'll shoot you down, because she is not a player. And she's committed to Wyatt.",
        "Thomas: You know what? That sounds like a great challenge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: So, Wyatt and Ivy are still going strong?",
        "Katie: Doesn't look casual from what we've seen.",
        "Bill: Well, you're around them a lot more than we are. What do you think?",
        "Liam: Yeah, uh, they seem tight. They're into each other.",
        "Bill: Wyatt could do a lot worse. In the meantime, we have a wedding to look forward to.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Look at the man you've become. Becoming proactive.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Like me. It looks good on you. I like it.",
        "Liam: I got to say, it's been really fulfilling working with Steffy. You know, managing and delegating and problem-solving. It's -- it's fun.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it could be double the fun. You know, if your temperaments are right, it can be a real turn-on.",
        "Bill: Speaking of which...",
        "Katie: We should go. We should go. You've got a big night to plan.",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah, you know, I wouldn't want to hold you up, you know.",
        "Liam: Right.",
        "Bill: Might be a small moment, but it's a -- it's a big occasion. Make a memory.",

        "Ivy: So, when are you leaving?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, as soon as I get to the airport. My mom's already on the jet.",
        "Ivy: Ohh. Just when I was getting used to spending every night with you.",
        "Wyatt: How -- how can you miss me if I don't ever go away sometimes?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] I know. Just don't make a habit of it, okay?",
        "Wyatt: Okay. You can stay at my place.",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: You know, be around my things, smell my shirts like a crazy person.",
        "Ivy: Uh...",
        "Wyatt: [Laughs]",
        "Ivy: No, I probably won't be doing that.",
        "Wyatt: What? Shh, shh, shh. Don't spoil this image for me, okay? I picture you on your side of the bed just longingly throwing looks over your shoulder at mine, at my pillow, just...",
        "Ivy: [Laughs] Okay, well, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna give you that.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Ivy: But I'm not gonna stay at your house.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, why not?",
        "Ivy: No, I don't know. Something about your house -- it creeps me out being there on my own.",
        "Wyatt: Ahh. Well, we don't want that, now, do we?",
        "Ivy: No. I might just stay at Uncle Eric's.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, that's a good idea.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, you can spend some time with him. I'm sure he'd love that. I've been monopolizing your time a lot lately.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Well, not that I'm complaining.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, now that you mention it, I haven't heard any.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Hey, can I tell you something?",
        "Wyatt: Yes. You like me.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Ivy: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Aww. Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: Hurry back, okay? You can come back and monopolize me some more.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I'll monopolize you all you want.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: Really?",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: If you go after Ivy, you'll make a fool out of yourself.",
        "Thomas: Because she's so committed to Wyatt?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, she is. She's the kind of woman who takes her relationship seriously. She's not a cheater.",
        "Thomas: She kissed me.",
        "Steffy: I didn't say she was perfect.",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Steffy: But one kiss from you doesn't change her core. She's loyal to Wyatt.",
        "Thomas: Wyatt is a rebound. I think she knows that, you know? How long after Liam did they hook up?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it was fast, but it doesn't mean it isn't real.",
        "Thomas: Well, if Ivy and Wyatt are solid, then there's no game.",
        "Steffy: Okay, that's what's wrong with this. This isn't a game, Thomas. Wyatt and Ivy are in a relationship.",
        "Thomas: Which if they are as strong as you say they are, you'll be right and I'm wrong. Think -- think of this bet as -- as a favor for a friend. You know, if Ivy's just stringing Wyatt along -- he's a good guy like you say he is -- you know, she's waiting for the next guy to come along, and you don't want him to get in too deep, do you? I mean, you're the one who's always saying you have trust issues with Ivy. And now you don't even question her intentions here? Just saying. If you like Wyatt, maybe you want to know where she's coming from.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, maybe.",
        "Thomas: Come on, Steff. Take me up on that bet. I know I can get her.",
        "Steffy: No. You're not gonna get her.",
        "Thomas: Sounds like a bet to me. You want to shake on it? Come on.",
        "Steffy: Get out.",
        "Thomas: Steff.",
        "Steffy: Out.",
        "Thomas: Shake. Love you.",
        "Steffy: Out!",
        "Thomas: Love you!",
        "Wyatt: Oh! I-I didn't realize anyone was in here. I just got to get a couple things.",
        "Steffy: Oh, uh, San Francisco suppliers meeting?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Uh, Mom's waiting for me on the jet.",
        "Steffy: Ivy going with you?",
        "Wyatt: I asked her. She said she had work to do.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Are you okay?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, just a little distracted, that's all.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Madam president and all that.",
        "Steffy: That I am.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: So, are things going well with you and Ivy?",
        "Wyatt: Just grateful we're together every day.",
        "Steffy: I imagine she feels the same.",
        "Wyatt: I would think so, he said modestly.",
        "Steffy: Ah, yes.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: What's not to like?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, you found me eminently resistible.",
        "Steffy: Okay, barely.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: But Liam's your guy, right?",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] And you're happy with Ivy, and all is well.",
        "Wyatt: This is nice.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Wyatt: I mean, you being supportive of my relationship with Ivy, and I know it hasn't been easy for you two.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but we said we were moving forward, and that's what we're doing.",
        "Wyatt: It's good. I mean, look at all of us. So adult.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, what about you and Liam?",
        "Steffy: Just when I think I couldn't be crazier about him, he says something, he does something, makes me fall in love with him even more.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Steffy: It's like when I think about all that time I was away, all that -- all that time wasted. Never again. Never.",
        "Wyatt: You don't have to worry about Liam. He's right where he wants to be.",
        "Steffy: For Ivy, too, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, she says so. Yeah.",
        "Steffy: No reason not to believe her.",
        "Wyatt: Not at all. We're in a good place, and we're just getting better all the time.",
        "Steffy: That's really good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: No, really. You did look amazing in that dress. It was -- it was fantastic. Okay, sounds good. I'll pick you up at 9:00. Actually, um, I need to call you back. Are you the most beautiful hallucination I've ever seen?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Thomas: Just a second. Wait a second. Oh, my gosh, you're real, you're real. Are you stalking me?",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah, you wish.",
        "Thomas: I kind of do.",
        "Ivy: Well, it turns out Quinn and Wyatt had to go to San Francisco for business, and I don't like staying at the beach house by myself, so here I am.",
        "Thomas: Here you are. You going to bed already?",
        "Ivy: Uh, no, I want to go upstairs, change into something comfortable. I haven't eaten yet, so I'll come back down and make soup or something simple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Steffy: Wow. You got roses for me?",
        "Liam: Yeah. I followed an impulse.",
        "Steffy: Ohh. Thank you. Hmm.",
        "Liam: Sure.",
        "Steffy: They're gorgeous. And you give great impulse.",
        "Liam: Oh, thank you. Well, we've been so busy, I just thought it would be nice to return the focus to us, you know?",
        "Steffy: How did you know this is exactly what I need?",
        "Liam: Hmm. Well, either I'm psychic, or I just know you better than anyone.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Come here. Nice coming home to you.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Working with you. Waking up to you.",
        "Liam: Life together sure is good, isn't it?",
        "Steffy: Oh. Couldn't be better.",
        "Liam: Well, that I don't know about.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Ooh. I know that look. You're still at the office.",
        "Steffy: Oh, no, I'm, uh -- I'm sorry. Just... yeah, uh, just a little distracted, but it's fine.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Well, not allowed. You're home now. This is sanctuary. And I want your attention right here.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt and Quinn left for San Francisco.",
        "Liam: Supplier meeting?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I kind of thought Ivy would go, but she's here. Would have been nice for them, change of scenery.",
        "Liam: Is that concern I hear for Ivy and Wyatt?",
        "Steffy: Uh, would it be bad if it is?",
        "Liam: No, it's just surprising given everything that's happened.",
        "Steffy: Well, I want us to work together, and I want us to get along. I want us to be concerned about each other.",
        "Liam: You are wonderful. Do you know that?",
        "Steffy: Darling, tell me more.",
        "Liam: No, I'm -- I'm serious. You could have easily walled yourself off from both of them and nobody would have blamed you. But instead you're letting go of the past and moving forward with compassion.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but that's because of you.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: You make me a better person. And I have to live up to that wonderful status.",
        "Liam: Oh, trust me, you do without even trying.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Besides, I like your brother. He's smart and he's nice and he's resourceful. He has been overcoming Quinn all his life.",
        "Liam: Ugh! Can't even.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but instead of letting her define him and damage him, he's become his own man, and I-I admire that.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you know, I think it's, um, I think sometimes it's hard for me to see that. Maybe it's just 'cause he's my brother and he knows how to push my buttons more than anyone. And let's be honest -- annoyance beats admiration. But you're right. He is one of the good guys, even though he is a little misguided on occasion.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but who isn't?",
        "Liam: Touch\u00e9.",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "Steffy: So, do you think Ivy really cares about Wyatt?",
        "Liam: From everything I've seen, yeah. Why? You don't?",
        "Steffy: No, no, no, I-I do. I think they're both equally committed. I just wanted to know your opinion. You know better than I do.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, well, Ivy's... Ivy's just serious, you know? And I'm not saying she doesn't let loose and have fun. She can do that. But she's not a casual person, especially when it comes to relationships. I mean, she makes a commitment and she really sticks to it. And I think that's why Wyatt really has a shot at happiness with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: What's all this?",
        "Thomas: Uh, well, it's your first night back in awhile, and you said you were gonna have soup for dinner. Yeah, I can do you one better than that.",
        "Ivy: Okay. I'll bite.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] Cute. I like that. I made a call to the chef at the Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Oh, you did?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, of course, I know that's your favorite restaurant in the whole, wide world because of the name. Funny. Yeah. Um, and they're gonna have the food delivered here shortly.",
        "Ivy: It's very thoughtful of you.",
        "Thomas: Well, it's my pleasure.",
        "Ivy: Very friendly.",
        "Thomas: I'm a friendly guy. Uh, while we wait...",
        "Ivy: Oh, thanks.",
        "Thomas: Good for you?",
        "Ivy: Mmm.",
        "Thomas: You like that?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas: Good. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! First, a toast. Geez.",
        "Ivy: Mm. What are we toasting to?",
        "Thomas: Uh, let me think about that. To success in all of our endeavors.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I like that.",
        "Thomas: And -- and to the elegance and grace of the woman sitting across from me.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Okay. [Chuckles]",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "Ivy: Hmm. You know, you really didn't have to go to all this trouble.",
        "Thomas: Oh, it's no trouble at all.",
        "Ivy: Unless, of course, you're in some. I heard you on the phone earlier trying to make plans for this evening.",
        "Thomas: Ah. That.",
        "Ivy: So, who is she? Is she a model? Famous actress?",
        "Thomas: Is that -- that jealousy that I'm hearing in your voice? Because it sounds a lot like jealousy.",
        "Ivy: Why would I be jealous?",
