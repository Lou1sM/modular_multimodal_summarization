        "Over Stephanie's gravesite, Ridge tells Brooke that RJ is back and they can have their family together. She has flashbacks of her last days with a dying Stephanie. She's just glad at the end they got over their differences and loved each other. Ridge tells her to be with him as she cannot be part of the Forrester's if she is married to Bill. Brooke admits she did not make it easy but in the end Stephanie accepted her and put her in charge of the family. Ridge says yes they both screwed it up but they can make it right now. Meanwhile Bill is showing RJ his office and tells him to sit down in the big boy seat and look at Spencer Publications. RJ seems impressed. Liam drops in. He tells RJ to keep an open mind; Bill might surprise him. He's an acquired taste but his mom gets him and they are good for each other. In bed, Eric tells Quinn that he was next door with Katie as she is thinking of buying the place. She would be crazy not to. Katie puts in her bid with her realtor who tells her this is ideal as she already knows her neighbor. Eric asks Quinn if there is a problem with Katie living next door. Quinn says there could be. She does not think it is appropriate for a woman, any woman, to keep dropping by to see him especially when Katie knows she is not there. She knows she had a good reason once but then she keeps showing up and now buying the house so she is suspicious.",
        "Eric starts to say Quinn is his wife so there is no concern. Quinn interrupts and says he just cannot see how this looks. He says he does see. But no other woman can come waltzing in here with red lipstick on her lips so no more concern for Katie. Quinn says the old Quinn would be seeking revenge right now and putting Katie in her place, but she is not going there. Quinn goes downstairs and happens to check Eric's phone. He has a text from Katie who tells him she is next door and making an offer on the house. She ends it with XO. Katie is surprised to find Quinn at the door. She says Rick told her about the place and it is ideal. Quinn says that is good but she could have looked longer and found a better one suited for her. She asked her to stay away and she will not let her buy this house. Wyatt finds it interesting that Katie has bought the house next door and wonders how Quinn will welcome Katie. Brooke tells Ridge that they never worked out so it probably won't now just because Ridge decrees it. She says what she has suddenly found is that she does not need anybody. He surprises her when he pulls out a box and it has Stephanie's ring. She asks if he is asking to marry her?"

        "Ridge: It's not too late. R.J.'s back, and we can have our family. It's always what she wanted for us. Tell her, Mom.",
        "R.J.: Thanks for the tour. It's been...eye-opening.",
        "Bill: You're welcome. All right, if my safe room didn't speak to your sensibilities, maybe this will. Sit down in the big dog's seat. This you're gonna appreciate. Videos, memes, digital content.",
        "R.J.: Okay.",
        "Bill: Check this out.",
        "William: Welcome to the world of Spencer Publications. I'm William Spencer, C.E.O. and founder of the largest media conglomerate...",
        "Bill: #Welcometospencer.",
        "[Fanfare plays]",
        "Wyatt: Look at these orders, huh?",
        "Rick: Impressive.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rick: I suppose.",
        "Wyatt: Come on! You got to admit the show was a hit!",
        "Rick: Don't tell me it's because of the interim C.E.O. Our company was a success in spite of your mother. Not because of her.",
        "Quinn: You were next door with Katie Logan?",
        "Eric: She's thinking of buying the place, and, uh, she asked my opinion.",
        "Quinn: What did you tell her?",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] I told her she'd be crazy not to buy it. It's a great house.",
        "Katie: Thank you for meeting me here again, Amy.",
        "Amy: Of course. Any time.",
        "Katie: Have you heard anything from the sellers?",
        "Amy: Well, I know they've received two or three other offers so far and are planning on reviewing all of them later today.",
        "Katie: Oh, there are multiple offers. I, um -- I can't really imagine a better place for me and my son. I really want this house, so maybe we should increase our offer?",
        "Amy: You got it.",
        "Bill: Pick-me-up here. This is good stuff. Wheatgrass shot.",
        "R.J.: Okay.",
        "Bill: Cheers. [Glasses clink] It's good for you. Hmm? Oh, come on. It's not that bad.",
        "Liam: R.J.",
        "R.J.: Hey, Liam.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Liam: I didn't expect to find you here.",
        "Bill: Yeah, my, uh, future stepson and I are spending the day together.",
        "Liam: Oh, really?",
        "Bill: Hmm.",
        "Liam: I can't imagine how much fun you two are having.",
        "Bill: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: Tell me again about her last day.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] You should have been there for her, ridge.",
        "Ridge: I know.",
        "Brooke: She loved you more than anybody.",
        "Ridge: You sang to her.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. I did.",
        "Brooke: When Irish eyes are smiling 'tis like the morn in spring in the lilt of Irish laughter you can hear the angels sing",
        "Brooke: It was very special for me to be there for her. After all those years of fighting and searching for her love and her respect.",
        "Ridge: It must have been hard. It's a lot of years, a lot of history, and a lot of memories. You'll never have that with bill.",
        "Amy: We can raise your offer. And, you know, Katie, writing a letter about yourself and giving it to the sellers, talking about you and your son, it could really help to entice them.",
        "Katie: Okay, all right. Fine. Give me a pen, a piece of paper. I will get started.",
        "Amy: I appreciate your enthusiasm.",
        "Katie: Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding me? That view from the veranda is amazing, from the ocean to the city. I just can't get over this house.",
        "Amy: You're going to adore living here. And just think -- you're already friendly with the neighbors.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: You told Katie to get the house?",
        "Eric: I encouraged her, yes. Would that be a problem?",
        "Quinn: If she moved next door? It could be. I could see it being a huge problem.",
        "Wyatt: Katie's buying a new house? Where?",
        "Rick: Beverly Hills. Right next to my dad.",
        "Wyatt: Nice. Wait, so you mean like right next door?",
        "Rick: Like if Dad runs out of sugar, he could always borrow a cup from Katie.",
        "Amy: Okay, sign here.",
        "Katie: Okay, now do you think we have the highest offer?",
        "Amy: You never know, but, you know, even if not, you wrote an all-cash offer, and that really does give you an advantage.",
        "Katie: Okay, here's my letter. Hopefully that'll help.",
        "Amy: Did you mention you know Eric?",
        "Katie: Of course, I did.",
        "Amy: Great. I have a feeling being connected to Eric Forrester could really work in your favor.",
        "Eric: Quinn, are you upset about this? Katie said that you called her and...",
        "Quinn: Well, I didn't think it was appropriate for Katie to be here. Now, call me old-fashioned, but I don't think it's okay for any woman to come by unannounced and spend time with my husband, especially when they know that I'm not home. And Katie is -- she's really close with the rest of your family, and right now you're -- you're the only person that I fully trust.",
        "Eric: Sweetheart, we're talking about Katie here. I mean, I've -- I've known her forever. There's no reason for you to worry about her coming by for a visit, especially if she has a good reason to come here.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, she had a good reason once, okay? That was fine. But then she shows up the very next day with a bottle of champagne, and now she's buying the house next door, and you wonder -- you wonder why I'm suspicious?",
        "Liam: Theoretically, you should be honored that he showed you that safe room, because nobody sees that.",
        "R.J.: Guns, money, scotch. It was odd.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. My dad, he's -- he's different.",
        "R.J.: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: And he's not like anyone you've ever met, but maybe that's why your mom fell for him. And he fell for her, too. Just try to keep an open mind, 'cause they might surprise you.",
        "Ridge: Tell me your favorite memory.",
        "Brooke: Of Stephanie?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] I don't know. Oh, there's so many. But they're all there. They're all a part of me.",
        "Ridge: If you had to pick one.",
        "Brooke: Skid row. I just remember her standing there holding that baby. We learned so much, and the good that it did for the charity. Then, of course, there was riding that roller coaster, as frightening as it was.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, hang on tight. This is gonna be great. Yeah!",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: I still can't believe she got you on that thing.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Every fashion show.",
        "Stephanie: From Eric Forrester, his magnificent showstopper.",
        "Brooke: And every Christmas. I'm just so glad that we were able to get over our differences and become close.",
        "Ridge: She cared about you. And she said you were the one to lead this family forward.",
        "Stephanie: You're gonna be in charge of my family, because it's now your family, okay? Can you do that? You can. I know you can. I know you can. I love you, honey.",
        "Brooke: I love you so much.",
        "Ridge: But how can you be in charge of us Forresters if you're married to bill Spencer? Don't give up. Don't throw away everything we fought for. Be with me. Give her what she wanted.",
        "R.J.: Liam, I like you, all right? You are nothing like your dad.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Yeah, yeah, he's -- he's an acquired taste. I think most people don't get him, but, um -- but, hey, your mom does. And he gets her, too. They're good for each other.",
        "Brooke: I always wanted her to be proud of me. My second mother.",
        "Ridge: She very much saw you as her daughter.",
        "Brooke: I remember the first time she called me that.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, you've been so wonderful to me these past few weeks. I'll never forget it. You've been like a daughter. I love you.",
        "Brooke: It felt so good, like I finally belonged. Stephanie tried. She did. Even after all of our battling, she really did try. And I know I didn't make it easy. But she did accept me. She accepted us.",
        "Stephanie: I'm not gonna be here forever, all right? I'm gonna be gone sooner rather than later. And you are going to be here and you're gonna be in charge of the family. You've got all these people that you're going to have take care of and love and look out for. You'll do that with ridge. Don't lose faith.",
        "Ridge: We screwed it all up, didn't we? Right into our old patterns. But it's not too late. We can fight right now for everything that matters, everything that we fought for before, convincing Stephanie to be on our side. We don't want to just throw all that away, do we? Do we, Logan?",
        "Eric: Quinn, look at me. You're my wife. All right? I'm committed to you. I understand your concerns.",
        "Quinn: No, listen, I-I trust you. But Katie -- I mean, she knew that I would be -- I would be busy with the fashion show, and she chose to come over here, wearing lipstick.",
        "Eric: Lip-- lipstick? A lot of women wear lipstick.",
        "Quinn: A naughty shade of red. And now she wants to buy the house next door. And rick, who is not my biggest fan, he's the one helping her. And just, I mean, you don't see?",
        "Eric: I see you, Quinn. I love you. You're my wife. I'm committed to you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. And no other woman can come waltzing in here with an expensive bottle of champagne and -- and some naughty shade of red on her lips and do anything to change that. And I highly doubt that Katie is in cahoots with rick and the rest of my family.",
        "Quinn: You're right. You're right. I know you're right.",
        "Eric: No more concerns about Katie?",
        "Quinn: The woman that I used to be, she would be plotting right now to figure out how to put Katie in her place, but... that's not who I am anymore. I am not gonna show you old shades of Quinn. I don't want to see old shades of Quinn. I made you a promise, and I'm gonna keep it. Being wary and suspicious is not who I am anymore.",
        "Eric: Does that mean you'll let this go?",
        "Quinn: Let what go? What? Oh, see? There. It's already gone.",
        "Eric: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: Let go.",
        "Eric: Okay. Great. What are you doing? Are you...",
        "Quinn: I thought that I would just go downstairs, get us something to drink.",
        "Eric: Well, if it's champagne, bring two glasses and, um, think about wearing a naughty shade of red.",
        "Quinn: Too soon.",
        "Katie: Okay, um, if you don't mind, I would love to take another look upstairs, maybe do some measurements?",
        "Amy: Oh, sure, yeah. That's fine. I actually have some calls to make, so I'll go out to my car and do that. And while I'm there, I'll submit your updated offer. I'll come back and lock up in 20, 30 minutes?",
        "Katie: That's great. Thank you. [Sighs] This is all working out.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Quinn: \"Next door. Putting an offer on the house. Thank you so much. Xo, Katie.\" Xo? [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Katie living right next door to your dad? That -- that could be... interesting.",
        "Rick: What's the matter, Wyatt? You seem concerned.",
        "Wyatt: No, I'm -- no. I'm not. I, uh... I can't wait to see how my mom's gonna welcome her to the neighborhood.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Quinn: Hi.",
        "Katie: Um, Quinn, what are you doing here?",
        "Quinn: I was just about to ask you the same thing.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. What?",
        "Quinn: May I?",
        "Katie: Sure.",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Come on in. Um... you look cozy. Are you getting ready for bed?",
        "Quinn: Well, I was just spending a little quiet time with my husband at home.",
        "Katie: Great.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. And then he told me that you're thinking about buying this house.",
        "Katie: Yes, yes. Rick told me about this place, and he thought that it might be a good fit for me and my son, and he was right.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Good, old Rick helping you out. You know, I -- but I got to say, you shouldn't settle for good. There are thousands of houses listed for sale in Los Angeles. You can go check out the valley. You should find the right house for you.",
        "Katie: But I like this house.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, you know, this is not going to happen. See, I asked you very nicely to stay away, and this is how you respond? You're not buying this house, Katie. I won't let you.",
        "R.J.: You really think my mom and your dad could last?",
        "Liam: Yes. I mean, you want your mom to be happy, right?",
        "R.J.: Of course.",
        "Liam: I don't mean, like, right now. I mean for the rest of her life.",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Okay, 'cause from what I've seen, it hasn't happened with your dad.",
        "R.J.: Did you think it would happen with your dad?",
        "Liam: At first, no. But I do actually. I really do.",
        "Brooke: It seems like most of my life I dreamed of being with you, a happy marriage, raising a family. And I don't know if I can believe that anymore, if I believe you when you say we should be together.",
        "Ridge: Well, the good news is, you don't have to believe me. You can believe her. She always knew better than we did, anyway.",
        "Brooke: I'm in love with Bill.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, we've both tried that. We've tried finding happiness with other people. It never worked out.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] We never worked out.",
        "Ridge: Until now, maybe.",
        "Brooke: Why? Because you suddenly decree it?",
        "Ridge: No, no. Because all these years have led us here. And yes, you want to convince yourself you want to be with bill. But really what you're doing is avoiding what you need.",
        "Brooke: You?",
        "Ridge: Yes, me. Hi.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] You know what Stephanie helped me realize is that I don't need anybody. I don't need you, I don't need bill. I just need myself, and I need to be strong, a good mother, and do good in this world. And if there's some man out there that wants to join me on life's great adventure --",
        "Ridge: I want you to have an adventure, but it's not balloon rides and camel rides, you know?",
        "Brooke: Ridge --",
        "Ridge: Whatever bill is offering you is -- it doesn't compare to the history we have. Look, we're at my mom's grave. She's watching us. She wants us to be happy.",
        "Brooke: What are you saying? Stephanie's ring.",
        "Ridge: She's had it for years. Now I want you to have it.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Are you asking me to marry you?"
