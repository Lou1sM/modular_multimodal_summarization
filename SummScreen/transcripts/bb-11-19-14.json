        "Maya tells Madison that this is the first showing with Rick as CEO so everything must be perfect and failing is not an option. Maya tells Rick that she is a little nervous as she has never walked couture before. But mostly she is excited as it is a big day for Forrester ..and for Rick. She says he is very sexy as she watches him work. He's a great CEO. Ridge interrupts and asks what does Rick want now. Rick says he is sorry if he drug him away from Caroline. Ridge retorts that he's not going to get into this with Rick today. If he wants to help him put on this show, fine, if not, that's okay too. Maya pipes up that Ridge is so disrespectful. Rick is his boss and CEO of this company and he should not be talking to him like this. Ridge asks again what does Rick want. He answers that he has tweaked the lineup a little. Ridge says he has already done that. Rick says and he will continue until he is satisfied. Ridge looks at it and tells Rick that he is the designer, not Rick, so this is his job. Rick says he listened to his comments but he has final decision and it stands. And he makes decisions as he sees fit and if Ridge doesn't like it, then move on and take his girlfriend, Caroline, with him. Maya says sounds like a great idea to her. Ridge barks that she is not in this conversation. Ridge says that is rich, having his model girlfriend make decisions for the company. He better get it together or he is going to sink this company and lose Caroline for good. Yes he kissed his wife. That is on him. He should not put this on the company or Caroline. Stop being so stupid. He should blame Ridge not Caroline. He gets it. Rick doesn't tolerate disloyalty but don't make Caroline suffer anymore. The trust has been broken but they can fix that so don' throw it all away with this beautiful, smart, amazing woman. Dump Maya and go back to his beautiful wife. He says they are brothers and have not always got along but it would kill him to think that Rick would throw away the best thing in his life for something Ridge should not have done. So just do him a favor and after the showing tonight give Caroline five minutes and let her have her say. He owes it to Caroline and to himself. Bill hugs Caroline and congratulates her on her first showing for couture, yet says she looks so sad. She admits that she and Rick are not in a good place. Bill says he knows .because of Ridge. Katie told him. She walked out on Ridge but she is back now. He really wants to know with everything Caroline had at sake why this happened. He will not judge her. He just wants to understand .when she had her career, her family, her marriage and yet allowed herself to fall for Forrester. She tries to explain her crazy connection with Ridge while they were designing together .this creative rush and excitement, nothing like she had ever felt before. It's like their creative souls melded together. Bill says she must have had a little crush on him. She says she doesn't know, it was all so stupid now. Bill adds and Ridge used that to strengthen his bid for CEO. He takes her silence as a yes. She asks him not to blame Ridge as she was involved as well. Bill steams and says he sure as hell does blame Ridge as he is older and knows better. He does not get a pass on this one.",
        "Bill finds Ridge on The Rooftop and sidles up to him and says they have some business. Maya tells Rick that today she will be walking for him. As he leaves Caroline comes back stage and Maya corners her and says Rick is busy and besides does not want to see her. Caroline says she knows they aren't really friends but she thought now they were cool. Maya answers that she could not sit by and watch while she and Ridge carried on behind Rick's back. Caroline threatens that Maya should ease up some and better not start a fire she can not put out. Ridge asks Bill what does he possibly want with him ..and he has no time for this, the fashion show. Bill says he is not giving him a choice. That is his niece, young, impressionable and easily swayed by a predator like Ridge. He says Ridge collects women and then discards them when another looks his way. He wants to tell him something. He will do everything in his power to keep her from being his next victim. If he messes with Spencer women he will be in his face and that is a promise. And that means Katie as well. Surely Mr. Poetry remembers her with the little red string on her finger. Ridge says yes and he loves her. But Bill wasn't there when two artists worked and it came off the page and now it is done. Perhaps his throwing Ridge out the helicopter had something to do with it. Bill is incensed and tells him to lay off and stop freaking crying about that or is he going to play the victim forever. Ridge started that party and Bill finished it yet now is trying to blame all of this on Bill. That works as long as he gets what he wants. Ridge Forrester, Mr. Designer Extraordinaire, Mr. Entitled, Mr. Untouchable. Maybe he does not think anyone will stand up to him against those women. Well there was only one miscalculation, and that would be him. He hauls off and sucker punches Ridge."

        "Ridge: Hey. I know you're upset, but you got to pull yourself together.",
        "Caroline: I know. The preview.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, it's a big day for us. Could have been a bigger day if Rick hadn't changed stuff around.",
        "Caroline: I know. He's angry, and he's hurting, and it's my fault.",
        "Ridge: Not your fault. I was there, too, so...",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Ridge: Okay? Oh, come on. Really?",
        "Caroline: Is it Rick?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. He's got another change for us. God help us. Hey. You're gonna be?",
        "Caroline: No, I'll be fine. Just go.",
        "Ridge: Things have a way of always kind of working themselves out. Okay.",
        "Caroline: Uncle bill?",
        "Bill: I thought you might need me.",
        "Rick: Now, I know you know this, but it bears repeating. A lot is riding on the success of this preview. Couture needs it. Lord knows I need it.",
        "Maya: This is our first big fashion event with Rick as C.E.O. Failure on any level is not an option. Understood. Everything is set. Ready to go.",
        "Rick: Oh, I sent you another e-mail. I changed the lineup again. Please get it to the models right away. Got it.",
        "Rick: Thanks. Mm-hmm.",
        "Maya: [Sighs] I'm getting some butterflies. I've never walked couture before.",
        "Rick: You're not nervous, are you?",
        "Maya: A little. Mostly excited. It's a big day for Forrester.",
        "Rick: Mm.",
        "Maya: For you.",
        "Rick: Yeah. I need this preview to wow.",
        "Maya: It will.",
        "Rick: You have been overseeing every single detail, and I cannot tell you how sexy it is to watch you work. You give great C.E.O.",
        "Rick: Oh, no fair, distracting me.",
        "Maya: Well, just consider it a preview of what's to come tonight.",
        "Rick: Mm.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ridge: Okay. Now... what is it now?",
        "Rick: You sound irritated. What did I do? Tear you away from Caroline?",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Bill: So... a big show for you. Able to get through it?",
        "Caroline: I have to.",
        "Bill: What do you mean, \"I have to\"? What's with the lack of enthusiasm? You should be excited. Your first designs for couture. And yet you're sad.",
        "Caroline: Rick and I aren't in a good place.",
        "Bill: I know. Because of Ridge.",
        "Ridge: I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna get into it with you. If you want to help me put this show on, great. If you don't, you don't. It's fine.",
        "Maya: You are so disrespectful. Rick is your boss and C.E.O. Of this company.",
        "Ridge: Shhhhh! What's this change you have now? What is it?",
        "Rick: I tweaked the lineup a little bit.",
        "Ridge: You've already done that.",
        "Rick: Yeah, and I'll keep doing it till I'm satisfied.",
        "Ridge: You can't -- [Sighs] You're changing two and four? You're gonna dissipate the whole impact of the line. Why would you do that?",
        "Rick: I disagree.",
        "Ridge: You disagree with -- no, you can't disagree. I -- [Chuckles] [Sighs] I'm a designer. This is my job, not yours.",
        "Rick: You don't have to like it. Fact is, I have final say.",
        "Ridge: And I don't weigh in at all?",
        "Rick: I heard your opinion, Ridge. The decision stands.",
        "Ridge: Why are you doing this? Why are you sabotaging a whole company?",
        "Rick: That's your own paranoia. I've got just as much riding on this couture line as anyone else does.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, but if you could sacrifice this line and sacrifice me, that would be okay, right?",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] Yeah, it's not always about you. I make decisions as I see fit. If you don't like it, move along. Oh, and take, uh, your girlfriend with you. What's her name? Caroline.",
        "Maya: Sounds like a great idea to me.",
        "Ridge: You're not in this conversation!",
        "Maya: Oh, but here I am.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Here you are. Yet another example of you losing the plot. Having your -- your model girlfriend make decisions for the company. Rick, you got to get it together or you're gonna sink this place. And you're gonna lose Caroline for good.",
        "Caroline: You know about Ridge and me?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Caroline: How?",
        "Bill: Katie.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God. That must have been an earful. And she probably hates me, too.",
        "Bill: Not even close.",
        "Caroline: She walked out on Ridge.",
        "Bill: Well, she's back now. Katie does that. But you are not responsible for her reaction to a situation that Ridge created. Tell me what happened.",
        "Caroline: I'm sure that Katie covered it.",
        "Bill: From your perspective. I'm not here to judge you, Caroline. I just really want to try and understand how with everything you had at stake -- your career, your family, your marriage -- how you would allow yourself to fall for Forrester.",
        "Rick: All right. You got the changes to the lineup. I think we're done.",
        "Ridge: The order worked. You don't need to change it.",
        "Rick: Ridge, discussion closed.",
        "Ridge: Is that what you're gonna do? That's how you're gonna run this company? With this huge vendetta against me? If you kill this line, it's not just gonna hurt me or Caroline. It's gonna hurt all of us.",
        "Maya: Rick is doing what he thinks is best for Forrester. I'm sorry. Can we have some privacy, please?",
        "Maya: You can't kick me out of this office.",
        "Rick: No, he can't. But you need to get ready. The show is about to start.",
        "Ridge: Hey, Maya. You go ahead and break a leg. [Sighs] [Sighs]",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Ridge: You're angry and you feel betrayed.",
        "Rick: About to tell me why I shouldn't?",
        "Ridge: I kissed your wife, Rick. I did that. So you place that anger on me. Not the company. Not Caroline. And stop -- just stop making stupid choices. Changing the lineup, changing the pricing. Maya. Just get rid of her. Just dump her and go back to your beautiful wife.",
        "Caroline: It wasn't that I fell for Ridge, exactly.",
        "Bill: Were you unhappy in your marriage?",
        "Caroline: No. And that's what makes this so incomprehensible, so stupid.",
        "Bill: You weren't in that room alone, Caroline.",
        "Caroline: There was just... this crazy connection. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before or could even imagine. At first, it was this creative rush, you know, this excitement. The honor of being the way that Ridge could draw. It was like our creative souls melded together and -- and it wasn't just me drawing or Ridge, but it was...a combination of both of us. It was just... really, really powerful.",
        "Bill: Right. Really, uh... powerful. Well, the guy's got game. I will -- I will say that. Losing his, uh, talent or lack there of, to dazzle you, knowing that it would, preying on your sympathy, your hero worship.",
        "Caroline: It wasn't like that, okay? We were just working.",
        "Bill: Until it became something more. You had a crush on him, right?",
        "Caroline: I don't know! Maybe something more.",
        "Bill: And Forrester used that, didn't he? Answer me, Caroline!",
        "Bill: Forrester used that to strengthen his bid for C.E.O. I'll take that as a yes.",
        "Rick: This impassioned plea for my marriage might actually be touching if it wasn't coming from the guy who actually blew it all to hell.",
        "Ridge: Can I talk to you for a minute? [Sighs] We kissed, yes. We did. But it came from a different place. It was an innocent place. It was two people working together, creating something -- artists, you know?",
        "Rick: Because artists can't be held accountable for betrayal, because they're so much more advanced, so much more right-brained than us regular folks.",
        "Ridge: I'm saying hold me accountable -- me! I did that. [Sighs] Caroline made a mistake. We all make mistakes. You're making a mistake right now with Maya.",
        "Rick: I don't need to justify my relationship with Maya to you. I trust her. That's all you need to know.",
        "Ridge: Well, but then you're a fool, because what she wants is to use you as a gateway to a lifestyle that she -- [Sighs] Okay. We all get it. We understand. [Sighs] Rick Forrester doesn't tolerate disloyalty. I got it. Caroline got it. So don't do this. Don't punish her anymore. Don't make her suffer anymore. It's enough.",
        "Rick: Is that what you think I'm doing?",
        "Ridge: That is what you're doing! And part of me gets that. Yes, trust was broken, but you can rebuild that. Don't throw all that away, what you have with her. She's this beautiful, amazing, smart woman who loves you.",
        "Rick: A great kisser. Forgot to mention that. You don't have to list her qualities for me, Ridge. I know.",
        "Ridge: Rick, we're brothers. And we don't always get along, but it would -- [Sighs] It would kill me to think that you threw away the best thing in your life because of something that I shouldn't have done. Do me a favor. Try -- just try to find a little bit of forgiveness in you. Talk to Caroline. Hey, maybe tonight. Maybe after the show. Maybe you can talk to her and just... let her have five minutes. Let her have her say. You owe that to her. You owe it to yourself.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Bill: Why can't you give me an answer? Seems simple enough to me. Did Forrester use you? Yes or no?",
        "Caroline: Yes. There was some using in the beginning, but it changed.",
        "Bill: How?",
        "Caroline: The feelings weren't one-sided.",
        "Bill: Forrester say that?",
        "Caroline: He didn't have to. We were working so intimately.",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Caroline: Not physically. Except for the kissing. Oh, my God. It's too hard to explain.",
        "Bill: Try, because I -- I really want to understand how much Forrester took advantage of my daughter -- my niece.",
        "Caroline: What does it matter why or how or what happened, okay? It's over. My only focus now is getting back my husband. If it's even possible. Uncle bill, I messed up so bad.",
        "Bill: Not you.",
        "Caroline: You can't blame Ridge.",
        "Bill: I sure as hell can blame Ridge, and I do blame Ridge. He is older and he knew better. Now, you may have married Rick, but you are a Spencer. And as such... Forrester doesn't get a pass on this one.",
        "Rick: [Sighs]",
        "Maya: Safe?",
        "Rick: Ridge left.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Rick: How's it feel out there?",
        "Maya: Buzzy. Lots of energy. Anticipation. The dresses look amazing.",
        "Rick: That's good.",
        "Maya: Why do you feel so far away from me?",
        "Rick: It's just -- I've got a million things on my mind.",
        "[Indistinct conversation]",
        "Bill: We've got some business. Okay, so we just got a new order for the models.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Maya: I am gonna make you so proud of me.",
        "Rick: I know you will. Uh, Rick.",
        "Rick: I've got to go. Good luck.",
        "Maya: Hey. I'll be walking for you. Hey, um, I need to show you something in the showroom.",
        "Rick: All right. Okay.",
        "Maya: Let me guess. You're looking for Rick.",
        "Caroline: Oh, you're good.",
        "Maya: Well, he's working. So leave him alone. Besides, he doesn't want to see you.",
        "Caroline: Mm-hmm. Because he's hurting. That's how you can tell he still loves me.",
        "Maya: Well, I understand why you need to believe that. You're not ready to let go.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, you know when that's gonna happen? Never. You know what? How could you, Maya? You know, I thought that we were, if not friends, at least cool with each other.",
        "Maya: Me telling Rick about you and Ridge was nothing personal against you.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Maya: I'm just honest to a fault. And I couldn't let Rick stay in the dark knowing that you and Ridge were carrying on behind his back. I want Rick to enjoy his life, his work, his wealth.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, with you right there for the ride, of course.",
        "Maya: Well, that goes without saying.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, all of the Forrester perks and privileges.",
        "Maya: Rick knows I'm excited about it. I don't hide who I am from him. He knows that when he's with me, what he sees is what he gets. No earth- shattering surprises like he got from you.",
        "Caroline: And I bet you remind him of that every chance you get. You know, you should ease up on that a little. Quit fanning every tiny little flame, because there's a lot of volatile personalities here, relationships on the line, and people willing to fight for them. You don't want to start a fire that you can't put out.",
        "Ridge: Oh, bill. I don't have time for that right now.",
        "Bill: Right. Fashion show. Well, I'm not giving you a choice.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] What could you possibly want from me? Ah. You found out about Caroline and me.",
        "Bill: Two words that should never come out of your mouth. That is my niece, who is like a daughter to me. She is young and impressionable and easily swayed by a predator like you.",
        "Ridge: Predator? That's new.",
        "Bill: Yeah, you collect women. Then you discard them as soon as another one throws a look your way. Let me tell you something. I will do everything in my power to keep Caroline from being your next victim.",
        "Ridge: Does she know you're here right now?",
        "Bill: No, and she's not going to know, because you're not gonna tell her.",
        "Ridge: Okay, say your piece and then leave. I got work --",
        "Bill: You mess with Spencer women and expect me to be in your face. That is a promise. And that means Katie, as well. You do remember Katie, right? You know, the woman you're engaged to, Mr. Poetry? With the little red string on her finger? The woman you're supposed to love?",
        "Ridge: I do love her.",
        "Bill: But you start messing around with my niece. Using her.",
        "Ridge: What do you know? Were you there? You weren't there, right?",
        "Bill: Oh, is this the part where I vomit, as you wax on about your feelings for Caroline?",
        "Ridge: You weren't there. You didn't see what happened. It was amazing. It was a beautiful thing. I don't expect you to understand. There's two artists, and we created something together. It came off the page. And now --",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Now it's done. You still here, Mr. Self-righteous? Do you think that maybe you throwing me out of the helicopter had something to do with it?",
        "Bill: Oh, come on! Will you stop freaking crying about that?! Are you gonna play the pathetic victim forever or maybe take ownership of what happened to you?",
        "Ridge: Ah.",
        "Bill: You showed up on the beach that day. You started the party and I finished it. Now here we are again, and you want to blame me for something that is entirely your fault. You are engaged to Katie. You made a commitment to her. But you turn around and start making out with my niece. Using her. She is young, she is susceptible, and she is married. But it makes no difference to you. What do you care if there's a couple of casualties along the way as long as you get what you want. Ridge Forrester. Designer extraordinaire. Mr. Entitled. Untouchable. You don't think there's anybody who's gonna stand up to you in defense of those women? Well... there was only one miscalculation. And that would be me."
