        "Ann okays going with Stephanie to stay with Taylor. But in leaving, she has a twinge of pain and almost doubles over. They sit down and Stephanie inquires if she has any medication. Ann lies and says she took it all; they might get her some of that medical marijuana. Stephanie calls Taylor to ask if she might bring Ann there and have Taylor even look at her. Stephanie tries to get Ann to lie down at Taylor's, but she's her grumpy old self and they can't do anything right. Pam smiles when her mother quips to her to remember all those fantasies when she wanted to smother her with a pillow, well now would be a good time. Taylor tells Stephanie that if Ann has pancreatic cancer then it has spread all over her body and all they can do is make her as comfortable as possible. Steffy tells Brooke that she really doesn't know her great grandmother that well at all, but she's looking forward to seeing her and getting to know her. Pam paints Ann's nails. Ann tells her that she knows Pam wasted her youth on her. She loved her for it at the time, but Pam was right to get out of Chicago and try to find a new life. Suddenly Ann has a violent reaction and Pam tries to call Stephanie and then an ambulance. Taylor and Stephanie are at the pharmacy trying to get Ann more medication. Pam is reluctant for the paramedics to take her mom to the hospital since they promised no hospital, but she has no choice as this is life threatening, perhaps a blood clot.",
        "Stephanie is livid when she realizes that Pam called 911 and their mother is at the hospital. The doctor explains that she had an embolism and they are far more prepared to take care of her there than with them at home. She can be released in a couple of days and then do as she wishes. Stephanie and Pam look over their mother in bed hooked up to machines and tubes. Pam says they have to do what the doctor says. Stephanie says no, they have to do what their conscious says. Ann wakes up long enough to beg Stephanie and Pam to let her out."

        "Taylor: I really don't know Ann that well.",
        "Steffy: Well, I know they don't have vegetarians in Chicago, so I got to get back to work. I'm gonna ask Dad to join us, okay?",

        "Ann: Honestly, Taylor, I don't want to be any trouble. Didn't I tell you to adjust those blinds?",
        "Pam: Oh, sorry.",
        "Stephanie: Mother, stop ordering Pam around, please. Why don't you just lie down and close your eyes?",
        "Ann: I will when I want to. Aah! (Groans)",
        "Taylor: You're in a lot more pain when you lie down? What were you taking in Chicago?",

        "Stephanie: Well, how do you know it wasn't a side effect of the cancer?",
        "Ann: Because I know.",
        "Taylor: Is there anything else you were taking?",
        "Ann: I stopped everything.",
        "Taylor: I'm going to prescribe you the top-of-the-line drug, okay? But pain management is as far as my acute care manageability goes. I-I'll go to the pharmacy right now and--and pick it up.",
        "Stephanie: I'll drive you. I'll drive.",

        "Taylor: I still think she should be in a hospital.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, no. She doesn't want to go to the hospital. She made us promise her that. She doesn't want to go to a hospital because she doesn't want to die there.",
        "Taylor: With pancreatic cancer, by the time you find out about it, it's already spread all through your body. I mean, given her age and her condition, her diagnosis, I-- I'm sorry.",
        "Stephanie: It's not as though we're close.",

        "Steffy: Well, I actually wanted to talk to my dad about dinner. My great- grandmother is in town. But you already knew that. You were there when Donna told us.",
        "Brooke: Right. That surprise visit from Ann. That's so unusual. Have you learned anything more?",
        "Steffy: On why she's here? No, but I'm just hoping my dad could join us for dinner. You know, it'd be four generations of us.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, that's a great idea.",
        "Steffy: Really? You--you think so?",
        "Brooke: Family's very important-- those connections.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: It's a lot warmer here than it is in Chicago. Mom, your hands are so pale. You let your nails go.",
        "Ann: (Sighs)",
        "Pam: That's not like you. Hey, I got polish in my bag.",
        "Ann: (Sighs)",

        "Ann: Is my hand steady?",
        "Pam: Perfectly.",
        "Ann: I remember your father's hand at the last. I'd--I'd say, \"John, stay still.\" He'd say, \"I am.\" He'd let the cup drop... (Sighs) or tell me to refill it with scotch. (Chuckles) (Sighs) You look the same, Pammy.",
        "Pam: Do I? So do you.",
        "Ann: What's the good of traveling halfway across country if it doesn't change so much as your hairdo?",
        "Pam: (Chuckles)",
        "Ann: (Sighs) You were looking for something. Romance? Happiness? Lord knows. (Sighs) Did you find it?",
        "Pam: Sometimes it's fun, you know, just being on your own, low-key.",
        "Ann: You always did take after me.",
        "Pam: Do I?",
        "Ann: (Sighs) The homebody.",
        "Pam: (Chuckles) That's me.",
        "Ann: The sort of woman who needs to devote herself to someone superior. I'm not at all sure-- and I'm saying this now only to you, not to your sister. I'm not at all sure your father was that. Smarter, wealthier, obviously. Superior? I think not. And I'm quite sure I was nothing of the kind.",
        "Ann: You wasted your youth taking care of me, Pammy.",
        "Pam: (Sighs)",
        "Ann: I loved you for it, but you were right to leave. (Sighs)",
        "Pam: Well, it-- it doesn't feel so right now.",
        "Ann: Oh, you wouldn't have made any difference. I did miss your damn dog...",
        "Pam: (Laughs)",
        "Ann: A whole lot, though. Isn't that odd? (Chuckles) Aah! Aah!",
        "Pam: Mom! Mom, what is it?",
        "Ann: Aah! Aah!",
        "Pam: What? Mama, what?",
        "Ann: Aah!",
        "Pam: Mom, what?",

        "Woman: You understand, I have to ask, Dr. Hayes.",
        "Taylor: I know. I-I'm a psychiatrist. Fentanyl isn't a drug I usually prescribe.",
        "(Cell phone vibrates)",
        "Woman: You say Mrs. Douglas isn't your patient? Her home address is your home address.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Steph, please answer the phone!",
        "Ann: (Gasping)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: The patient is my mother. She's dying of cancer, and she flew here from Chicago. Perhaps that was a bad idea, but... would it help if, um, you spoke to her doctor in Chicago?",
        "Woman: That way, I could also get her Medicare information.",
        "Stephanie: Fine. I happen to have the phone number.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Tell me what to do! I don't know what to do!",
        "Ann: Aah!",
        "Pam: Oh, God.",
        "Ann: (Groaning)",
        "Pam: Yeah, I need an ambulance. It's my mother. Please hurry!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: It'll take 24 hours for the patch to achieve an effective blood level. And from what her doctor in Chicago says, she might need two.",
        "Stephanie: Oh.",
        "Woman: In the meantime, you can cover her with these-- one by mouth every four hours. You might think about getting hospice in.",
        "Taylor: That was my next call. Thanks.",
        "Woman: I'm sorry to keep you waiting.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, what's a few minutes now one way or the other? It doesn't matter much, but thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ann: Aah! (Groaning)",
        "Pam: What did you just give her?",
        "Woman: Morphine for pain. Safe. Fast-acting. It will give her some relief until the doctor can examine her.",
        "Pam: Wait, what doctors?",
        "Woman: Heart rate 180.",
        "Pam: Oh, that's incredibly high. Is it her heart?",
        "Woman: Pulmonary embolus?",
        "Woman: Has Ms. Douglas recently had a period where she was immobile, like a hospital stay, long plane trip--",
        "Pam: Well, yeah, both.",
        "Woman: Really?",
        "Pam: But pulmonary what?",
        "Ann: (Groans)",
        "Pam: No, no, no, you--you can't take her to the hospital.",
        "Woman: We have to, ma'am.",
        "Woman: Your mother's condition could be life-threatening.",
        "Pam: Oh, she knows that, but she made us promise--",
        "Woman: This isn't about her cancer. An artery in her lungs may be obstructed. It's probably a blood clot. They can dissolve the clot, but if you don't act now, she could die.",
        "Pam: But we promised.",
        "Ann: Oh! Aah!",
        "Woman: Wouldn't you rather let us take care of this now and have some quality time with your mother after?",
        "Ann: (Groaning)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Have you heard from my dad?",
        "Brooke: Uh, no, not yet.",
        "Steffy: Well, I hope everyone gets along. From what I've heard, Stephanie's relationship with her mom is complicated.",
        "Brooke: Yes. (Chuckles) Yes. Yes, it certainly is. For Stephanie to drop everything and go pick up her mother the minute she comes in town, I think that says a lot. I hope that they can get past some of those hurts and really start to heal. It's just so important to cherish that relationship between mother and daughter. And I think Ann coming in town-- I-I think that's the reason she's doing it. She wants to make that happen. And for Stephanie to forgive her, well, that would be absolutely remarkable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: That woman is wearing red. Mother never wears red. She hates red.",
        "Ann: Your grandmother made me wear red almost every day as a little girl. It was her favorite. I think your grandmother would like to see me in red.",
        "Pam: Mom, Grandma's been gone for over 30 years now.",
        "Ann: I'm dying. I've had enough of doctors and needles and pills. I will not go to the hospital. That is my one wish, and you will honor it!",
        "Stephanie: (Whispers) Pam. Pam, we're here.",
        "Taylor: No, wait. Wait. She might be sleeping, but we do need to get that patch on her right away.",
        "Stephanie: (Normal voice) Yes, and, I-I read that, uh, this medication has to be taken with food.",
        "Taylor: Okay, I'll get some crackers and soda. That'll be fine. That's plenty.",
        "Stephanie: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Taylor: I'll be right up.",
        "Stephanie: (Sighs)",
        "Pam: You didn't answer your phone.",
        "Stephanie: Why? What happened? Mother?",
        "Pam: They thought it was her heart, but it was a clot in her lungs.",
        "Stephanie: Who's-- who's \"they\"?",
        "Pam: They said they can fix it. They promised.",
        "Stephanie: Where is she?",
        "Pam: I called 9-1-1. I couldn't stand to see her like that. It was awful! It was awful!",
        "Stephanie: You let them take her to the hospital?!",
        "Pam: You should have answered your phone!",
        "Stephanie: What have you done?! What have you done?",
        "Pam: You should have answered your phone.",
        "Stephanie: My God, Pam!",

        "Pam: Oh, well, is-is Mom okay? Did you find her?",
        "Stephanie: Did you find her?",
        "Pam: Is she furious?",
        "Taylor: They're just running some tests. They don't even have a room assigned for her yet.",
        "Stephanie: What?",
        "Dr. Lewis: Dr. Hayes?",
        "Taylor: Yes.",
        "Dr. Lewis: You were inquiring about Ann Douglas?",
        "Taylor: Yes, these are her daughters.",
        "Pam: Hi. How do you do?",
        "Taylor: This is Pamela. This is Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Doctor, this is all a terrible mistake.",
        "Pam: It's my fault. I admit it.",
        "Stephanie: My mother has stage four pancreatic cancer.",
        "Dr. Lewis: Yes, we saw her medical alert bracelet, and we were able to have her records sent electronically.",
        "Taylor: Excellent.",
        "Stephanie: Well, then-- then is there anything in that about her wishes? Because she was very specific with us. She does not want to be hospitalized.",
        "Dr. Lewis: Yes, there's an advance directive and a D.N.R. order.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, great, well, then we can get her released and we can take her home.",
        "Dr. Lewis: Uh, Ms. Douglas--",
        "Stephanie: I'm sorry. Forgive me. Dr. Lewis, I'm Mrs. Forrester.",
        "Dr. Lewis: The situation's not so clear-cut. The paramedic and the E.R. doctor believes she has a pulmonary embolism.",
        "Taylor: Oh, my-- oh, my goodness.",
        "Pam: See, that--",
        "Taylor: She has a blood clot blocking flow to her lungs.",
        "Pam: That's what I was telling you at home, Steph.",
        "Dr. Lewis: Which may have more to do with her age and inactivity than her cancer.",
        "Stephanie: Well, be that as it may, my mother doesn't want to be hospitalized.",
        "Dr. Lewis: Releasing her now is out of the question. I won't do it. Untreated, the embolism will surely be fatal. Just let us resolve it, and she will be out of here in a couple of days.",
        "Woman: Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender.",
        "Taylor: Excuse me. Um, what about the D.N.R. order?",
        "Pam: What?",
        "Stephanie: You know, \"Do not resuscitate.\"",
        "Dr. Lewis: She's not unconscious. She's just sedated so that we could do a lung scan, a C.T. You can see her anytime. She's in I.C.U. 3. They just brought her up from radiology. We really are much better prepared to take care of her here than you are at home. (Telephone rings)",
