        "While the behind the scenes are going on for the fashion show, Bill punches Ridge and tells him to say the hell away from his niece. As he walks off, Ridge catches him and throws him to the ground. Bill gets up and hits Ridge again and kicks him in the stomach. Eric is surprised but glad to see old friend, Gloria from Genoa City and welcomes her to the showing where she is aghast at the sticker prices. Pam insists that Gloria have a lemon bar but only after Gloria finds out she is not just hired help but Stephanie's sister. Caroline helps the models and of course Maya plays the lead model to the hilt by telling the others what to do and follow her lead. Eric tells Rick that Caroline could use her help as that is what good CEO's do, but Rick says they all have their specific jobs and she will be all right.",
        "As the fashion show progresses, Bill and Ridge continue going after it by pummeling each other. Bill asks if they are done. That little dunk in the ocean was child's play ..Ridge knows what he can do to protect his family. Next time he won't see it coming he sucker punches him again in the tummy. Caroline tweaks Maya's gown to her liking but not to Maya's but it is Caroline's design so Maya has to acquiescence. She walks the runway. Ridge goes to the showing and practically falls into Caroline's arms when she sees him. He tells her to get out there and get the credit she deserves. He doesn't want to go like this, clothes bloodied and torn. Caroline goes and takes a bow while Ridge smiles and Rick broods. Ridge hugs Caroline and Rick notices. He tells her that he couldn't be more proud of her. They lock hands, hand in hand after she cleans up his wounds."
