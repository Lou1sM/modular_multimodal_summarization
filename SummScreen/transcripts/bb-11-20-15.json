        "Wyatt tells his mom that it does not bother him that Ivy and Thomas are staying under the same roof. The house is so big there is no reason for them to even cross paths. Now Thomas flirting with Ivy does bother him. Liam pours wine and says looks like a lot of rain is on the way. Thomas tells Ivy that he could not sleep and he was wondering if she was lying awake too thinking what he was. There must be more to do than just sleeping across the hall from each other. Steffy calls Wyatt to make sure everything is okay. He says they are coming back right after the meeting and he will fill her in then. He just wishes Ivy were here. Ivy tells Thomas perhaps they can play a card game .but bridge takes four, something like chess maybe with just two. People rarely beat her. The lightening scares Ivy and she lands in Thomas's waiting arms. She says playing games is not going to help either of them. She goes upstairs to bed. Thomas says he is going to make a snack but he doesn't. He texts Steffy that she is going to lose the bet.",
        "Steffy clears the text when Liam says he wants all of her, no more messaging. She laments that she never wants him to underestimate his importance in her life. He says she energizes him like no one else does. He wants to hold her tight and hold her safe. That is the only woman he can say that about. He wants to spend the rest of his life with her if she will let him. Suddenly he pulls out a box with a huge ring and asks if she will marry him. She says yes as she kisses him. He slips the ring on her finger and she kisses him again. Wyatt debunks Quinn's idea that Ivy, sweet Ivy, is a lot like his former goody two shoes Hope. He sees nothing wrong with that. Quinn just wants him to be happy and if that is Ivy then she is okay with that. He says Steffy came back to town with one thing on her mind \u0096 Liam, so he never had a chance with her. He is with Ivy and he is committed to her now. Thomas knocks on Ivy's door and without covering up she tells him to come in. He comes closer and asks her if Wyatt appreciates her the way he does. She lets him kiss her and returns the kiss. But she tells Thomas she can not do this. She is with Wyatt. He tells her to be a little crazy, be crazy with him. He kisses her again and she returns it. He lays her back on the bed while nuzzling her neck. Wyatt is on the phone texting her but she is paying no attention to the phone."

        "Ivy: So, you, uh, you can't sleep?",
        "Thomas: No. Not with my mind racing. Was, um... was thinking about you. Was wondering if you were awake, thinking what I was, imagining that, well, maybe there's something better than sleep that you could be doing with the person across the hall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Is that what's bothering you?",
        "Wyatt: Ivy and Thomas under the same roof? No. Why would that bother me?",
        "Quinn: Because he's been flirting with her.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, that bothers me, yes. And he needs to stop. But them living under the same roof? No. That doesn't bother me. Ivy can handle herself. Besides, the place is so huge. It's, like, I get lost in it sometimes still. They're probably staying in opposite wings of the entire estate. Like, there's no reason why they should ever cross paths with each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: More wine?",
        "Steffy: Hmm? Yeah.",

        "Liam: Did you hear that?",
        "Steffy: Is it raining yet?",
        "Liam: No, but probably soon, which is good for the drought.",
        "Steffy: Oh, bad for the commute tomorrow if it's still going on.",
        "Liam: Well, you know, maybe we can stay in. Celebrate.",
        "Steffy: Ooh. Thank you.",
        "Liam: Yep.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. Where do you think you're going? You're on cuddle duty.",

        "Steffy: You all ready for the meeting tomorrow?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, uh, Mom and I just have a few notes to look over.",
        "Steffy: Oh, it's too bad Ivy isn't with you on your trip instead of your mom.",
        "Wyatt: I know. Can you do something about that next time, please, Madam President?",
        "Steffy: Oh, maybe I will.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Did you call her, by the way, wish her good night? Chicks love that kind of stuff.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, do they?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it'll score you some points.",
        "Wyatt: That's good to know.",
        "Steffy: Well, good luck on the suppliers meeting and call me once it's done, all right?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, or I'll just, uh, tell you in person, 'cause we're gonna fly back right after the meeting anyway, so...",
        "Steffy: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Liam: Was that Wyatt?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Are you nervous for him?",
        "Steffy: No, I just -- I just wanted to call and make sure everything was okay.",

        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "[Thunder rumbles]",
        "Ivy: Ooh. [Clears throat] So, thoughts of me were keeping you awake, huh? Were we playing a game of bridge?",
        "Thomas: Uh, y-yeah, doesn't that require four people?",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Thomas: No, no, no, I was thinking something more along the lines of like a two-person activity.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, okay, so something more like chess.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah. You any good?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, quite.",
        "Thomas: Wow. Me, too. Actually, honestly, I don't think I've ever lost a game of chess.",
        "Ivy: Wow. Well, that's interesting.",
        "Thomas: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. We should definitely play sometime. You know, most people, they don't -- they don't last very long with me.",
        "[Thunder crashes]",
        "Ivy: Whoa! [Clears throat]",
        "Thomas: You okay? Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, it's just lightning.",
        "Thomas: You seem a little scared.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, a little bit.",
        "Thomas: Then maybe, uh, maybe chess is a good idea. What do you think? My room? Yours?",
        "[Thunder rumbles]",
        "Ivy: Wow. [Clears throat] You really are something, aren't you?",
        "Thomas: Is that, uh, is that a good thing?",
        "Ivy: I don't know yet. But what I do know is that us playing games isn't gonna help either of us sleep.",
        "Thomas: That's debatable. I mean, I think it just depends on how heated things get.",
        "Ivy: Do you normally get into arguments when you're playing games?",
        "Thomas: Things tend to get a little crazy, but my opponent never really complains. I mean, you'll see.",
        "Ivy: Maybe. But not tonight.",
        "Thomas: Well, if you change your mind...",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Hey. I thought you were gonna make a snack.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, maybe later, um, if I get hungry.",
        "Ivy: Well, uh, well, good night. I'll see you in the morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Steffy: Will you hate me if I take this?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I kind of feel like \"hate\" would be a slight overreaction on my part.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Will you be mildly annoyed?",
        "Liam: Um...no, 'cause it will give me a chance to see if the Clippers won. You okay?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.",
        "Liam: Steffy.",
        "Steffy: It's just my brother being my -- my brother.",
        "Liam: Oh.",
        "[Thunder rumbles]",
        "Liam: Well, I hear that. I understand sibling annoyance more than most. You know something? Um, I think I changed my mind. Uh, what do you say -- what do you say no more cell phones tonight?",
        "Steffy: Okay. Tune the world out.",
        "Liam: Tonight is about us, and I kind of want all of you.",
        "Steffy: Okay. There. Off. You have all of me. For better or worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Oh, I'm getting sleepy. I think I may head to my room.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Don't stay up too late sexting Deacon. We do have a meeting bright and early tomorrow.",
        "Quinn: Same goes to you and Ivy. [Chuckles] [Laughs] Never mind.",
        "Wyatt: That is -- that is rude and hurtful.",
        "Quinn: What? Oh, come on! You know! Well, you got to admit, sweet Ivy sexting? It just -- I mean --",
        "Wyatt: Wha--",
        "Quinn: Okay, come on. You're telling me that she doesn't remind you of some other goodie two-shoes that you used to hang around with? Hmm?",
        "Wyatt: Who?",
        "Quinn: You're telling me that you don't think Ivy is a lot like Hope?",
        "Wyatt: What?! Because they're both moral and decent people? And how is that a bad thing, by the way?",
        "Quinn: Well, how did things turn out with you and Hope?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, that doesn't mean that this isn't gonna turn out! What are you -- Mom, come on! You got me in my head about this again!",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Wyatt: Yes! I am with a loyal, honest, trusting woman. I know that's a foreign, boring concept to you, but I happen to like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Thunder rumbles]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[Thunder rumbles]",
        "Ivy: Come in.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Honey, all I have ever wanted is for you to be happy, and if that's what Ivy does for you, then I'm all for it. I'm just saying that I wonder if her Pollyanna personality is gonna hold your attention in the long run, especially since there was another woman on your mind just recently.",
        "Wyatt: Are you talking about Steffy? Okay, look, there was never a chance for Steffy and me. She came back to town with one thing on her mind, and that was Liam, and she got exactly that. There was no way that I could change her mind.",
        "Quinn: Ugh, it's so annoying. That dangerous, sexy woman like Steffy wasting her time on a spineless twit like your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: We should make a habit of this. Putting our phones away, unplugging.",
        "Liam: No argument here.",
        "Steffy: Have I been... I've been too distracted lately?",
        "Liam: I mean, not Caroline level distracted, but...",
        "Steffy: If I'm ever posting as much as her, feel free to take my phone and just throw it away.",
        "Liam: Duly noted.",
        "Steffy: No, I just -- I don't want to be that couple.",
        "Liam: What couple?",
        "Steffy: You know, those couples and they go to a restaurant and both of them are on their phones, and they're just completely ignoring each other, you know, forgetting about what -- what brought them together in the first place.",
        "Liam: I don't think that'll ever happen to us.",
        "Steffy: It happens all the time. So many of my friends, one minute they're so into each other, so in love, and then the next, the world takes over and their relationship takes a backseat. I just never, ever want you to underestimate your importance in my life.",
        "Liam: I won't. But can I tell you something? I am not worried about us losing our connection. And, you know, after the honeymoon and kids and jobs and all the headache, we'll still find time for rainy nights like this.",
        "Steffy: That's exactly what I want. I just want to forget about text messages and e-mails and... did you say honeymoon?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Do you need something?",
        "Thomas: I think we both do.",
        "Ivy: I don't need anything.",
        "Thomas: Sure about that?",
        "Ivy: Thomas, I'm with Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: He's in a different city tonight.",
        "Ivy: That doesn't matter!",
        "Thomas: Does he appreciate you?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Does he tell you how -- how beautiful you are?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas: Does he tell you how insanely sexy you are, how elegant? See, a guy like Wyatt couldn't possibly appreciate you the way that I do.",
        "[Thunder rumbles]",
        "Ivy: No. Ugh! Thomas, I... [Sighs]",
        "[Thunder rumbles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: What are you saying?",
        "Liam: I'm saying I agree with you. I don't want to lose sight of what's important, but the thing is, knowing us, I don't think we ever will.",
        "Steffy: Even...kids, you mean?",
        "Liam: Oh. Especially then. I mean, I don't want to make assumptions. Maybe we won't have kids. But if we do, I don't want to lose nights like this. When you were in Paris, it was -- it was these quiet moments that I missed just as much as the wild ones.",
        "Steffy: Oh, the wild ones.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you do.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: And I think you would agree that we've experienced a lot. We've lived a lot. And that's because of you, my love. You have energized me. You have made me take chances that I never would have taken otherwise. [Sighs] Kind of like the one I'm about to take now.",
        "[Thunder rumbles]",
        "Liam: Steffy, you've brought spirit to my life.",
        "[Thunder rumbles]",
        "Liam: Take this thunderstorm for example. There are two things, two very different things, that you inspire me to do right now. One is to hold you tight and keep you safe and smell you and touch you and quietly drink you in. And the other is to grab your hand and drag you outside to dance in the rain and laugh and scream and live. And, you know, you're the only woman I can say that about. You're the only woman who brings out both of those instincts in me. It's why I think we'll be great parents. It's why I think we'll succeed in a relationship that balances out the quiet moments with the stormy ones. And that's why I want to spend the rest of my life with you. If you'll let me. We have made so much history together. I just want to keep making more of it.",
        "Steffy: [Gasps]",
        "Liam: Will you marry me, Steffy?",
        "Steffy: Liam. [Chuckling] Yes!",
        "Liam: Yes?",
        "Steffy: Yes!",
        "Liam: Yes?",
        "Steffy: Yes, of course! [Sobs, sniffles] Oh, my God.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Implying that I should be with Steffy, calling Liam spineless -- I mean, you're not about to do anything weird again, are you?",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Wyatt: Okay, good. Good. I'd like to believe that. I just have to check in every now and then. Look, things didn't work out the way I wanted with Steffy, but I don't want you thinking that I'm upset about that. Why would I be? I'm with Ivy. I'm happy.",
        "Quinn: You're really committed to her, aren't you?",
        "Wyatt: Yes, I am. I love her, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Thomas, I can't.",
        "Thomas: Why not?",
        "Ivy: I've told you. I'm not interested in this. I'm not interested in you, not -- not like that.",
        "Thomas: So you're not feeling the way that I'm feeling right now?",
        "Ivy: I'm with Wyatt.",
        "Thomas: Ivy, we're young. This is the time of our lives to do something daring, to be a little crazy. So get a little crazy with me."
