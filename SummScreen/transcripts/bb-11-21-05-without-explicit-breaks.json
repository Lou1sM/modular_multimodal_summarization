        "Dante: Sign these papers. \r\nYou're holding on to a marriage that's already dead. ",
        "Nick: It's just beginning. \r\nBridget, please don't give up on us. ",
        "Bridget: You pledged your \r\nlife to my mother. You've been acting like such a devoted husband -- so excited \r\nabout having a child with me. This whole time, you've been longing for her? And \r\nnow that the divorce papers come, you just want me to forget about all of that, \r\nand believe that you've changed overnight. ",
        "Nick: This isn't \r\novernight, and you know it. Search your heart, stay true to that. ",
        "Bridget: So, you just \r\nexpect me to come around after you've lied to me, you've hid things from me? \r\nNick, I don't want a life full of insecurity and games. ",
        "Nick: Well, neither do I! \r\nBut don't forget, I'm not the one who started this. I think somebody ought to be \r\na man and step up and own their part in this. ",
        "Bridget: What -- Dante?\r\n",
        "Nick: What about the lies \r\nabout the abortion? Those tests that you put me through? You know, those weren't \r\nmy ideas. And I don't think they were yours, either. I think I know you a little \r\nbetter than that. ",
        "Dante: She was unhappy \r\nlong before that. You told her you loved her mother. ",
        "Nick: Because I was trying \r\nto be honest about everything. And, believe it or not, we had a loving, truthful \r\nrelationship before you came to town. And I want that back. No more fake \r\nabortions, no more fake love sessions by the pool or fake marriages or fake \r\nrelationships. I want to start a new beginning. And I know that you do, too, I \r\ncan feel it. I want to get back to what we talked about, back to the way we felt \r\nabout our relationship and this child. We can have that back. I'm tearing these \r\npapers up. ",
        "Dante: Like hell. You're a \r\nson of a bitch. That's all you've ever been. ",

        "Eric: Here's to a new \r\nunderstanding. A deeper commitment on my part to fulfilling your deepest \r\ndesires. ",
        "Brooke: Eric. ",
        "Eric: No, no, no. This is \r\nmy night. You don't talk until it's over. You're wonderful. You're amazing. And \r\nyou affect me in a way that no other woman ever has, or ever will again. You \r\nignite this passion in me, it's something I can't even control. My god -- I'm \r\nable to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Flying to Las Vegas, you and I, \r\ngetting married again for Bridget, to restore the family name -- for the company \r\n-- that idea was filled with greatness -- and risk, I know -- but I didn't care. \r\nBecause I was starved for you. I was tortured watching you deal with your \r\nyearnings there. ",
        "Brooke: Eric -- \n",
        "Eric: No, no. So now, I'm \r\ngoing to fulfill those needs in a way you never thought possible. ",
        "Brooke: Please -- \n",
        "Eric: No, don't need to \r\nthank me. Plenty of time to thank me later. When I told Stephanie about us, she \r\njust laughed at me, she told me that I wouldn't be able to hold on to you. And I \r\ntold her that, if it only lasted a week, it would be the happiest week in my \r\nlife. And, sure enough -- you give me more happiness, more joy, more of \r\neverything than I ever could have expected. It didn't turn out as I expected, it \r\nreally hasn't. But then, nothing really does with you, does it? So -- here's to \r\nthis marriage -- this madcap, wonderful, ill-conceived marriage. And here's to \r\n-- and here's to it's conclusion. Here's to you, honey. To your freedom. \n",
        "[ Glasses clinking ]\r\n",
        "Brooke: Our marriage? Are \r\nyou saying you're leaving me? ",
        "Eric: Leaving you? For me \r\nto leave you, young lady, would imply that I had actually had you. ",
        "Brooke: Eric -- \n",
        "Eric: Look, we -- we tried \r\nto do something wonderful -- something wonderful for Bridget. It was not a very \r\ngood idea, actually. I mean, she never bought it. In fact, it didn't work for \r\nus, either. And I think you probably were coming here to tell me exactly the \r\nsame thing. ",
        "Brooke: I felt so horrible \r\nfor everything that I put you through. ",
        "Eric: Don't do that. Don't \r\ndo that. No regrets, okay? This was fun. And we're going to have good -- more \r\ngood times together, we will. As grandparents. I cannot wait to hear that little \r\nbaby call you \"Gramma.\" And we have new bridges to build, we do. Forrester \r\ncreations -- I'm going to get the company back from Stephanie. I've got some new \r\npeople lined up, I have a whole new plan of attack. ",
        "Brooke: You're incredible. \r\nAnd there is a woman that is lucky enough to deserve you. She is out there.\r\n",
        "Eric: I believe she is, \r\ntoo. And so, our wild ride -- part two -- comes to an end. Damned if I don't \r\nstill love you. ",
        "Brooke: I love you, too.\r\n",
        "Eric: Yeah, yeah, I know. \r\nWell, now that the pressure's off, you know, I really hate to see this bed go to \r\nwaste. Any interest in that at all? ",
        "\r\n************************************************",
        "Dante: I know about \r\nfamily. And I never wanted yours to be torn apart. Listen, it's only a question \r\nof now or later. I mean, how many times has this guy hurt you, huh? And I don't \r\nwant him to do it again. You know, there's clever people in this world, okay? \r\nThey take advantage of other people. They use other people. And there's others \r\n-- not many -- okay, that have generous hearts, that are forgiving. I mean, \r\nBridget, when you're happy, you're extraordinary. I mean, if there are words in \r\nEnglish to describe it, I don't even know what they are. But, when you're sad, \r\nthat light inside you -- it's like, it's gone. It just dies a little, you know? \r\nHow many times are you going to let him do that to you? I mean, do you want to \r\nend up like Taylor -- married to a man who can't let go of your mother? \n",

        "[ Stephanie scoffs ]\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Dante's right. \r\nYou may believe you're not, but you're not any different than the rest of them.\r\n",
        "Nick: I am. I'm not like \r\nthem. I'm not like any of them. ",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, you keep \r\nsaying that. But I've seen Brooke get under men's skin. Strong, determined men \r\nlike you. ",
        "Dante: I love you, \r\nBridget. And I don't love anybody else! ",
        "Nick: Bridget -- I know \r\nthat I have to win your trust back. And I will do whatever it takes for how long \r\nit takes, but it can't happen if he's here. ",
        "Bridget: He has no place \r\nelse to go. ",
        "Nick: They have plenty of \r\nhotels in L.A. I'll take him myself. ",
        "Bridget: He's not going \r\nanywhere tonight. ",
        "Nick: Okay, fine, fine. \r\nLet's pack a bag for you. I want you to stay at the boat. ",

        "Stephanie: Don't you do \r\nany such thing! ",
        "Dante: Sign the papers!\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Dante will help \r\nyou raise this child. ",
        "Nick: Nobody's raising my \r\nchild. ",
        "Bridget: Oh, for god's \r\nsakes, just stop it! Stop! ",
        "Nick: I need to talk to \r\nyou for five minutes. That's all I ask. Alone! ",
        "Nick: This is wrong, \r\nBridget. What's going on in there, this arguing and bickering and this high \r\nmanip -- ",
        "Bridget: You have no right \r\nto tell me you can or cannot stay in my house. ",
        "Nick: No, I don't. \n",
        "Bridget: Okay. ",
        "Nick: But that is my \r\nchild. And I do have a right to raise my child. But I don't want to do that \r\nwithout you. We've lost a lot of time, you know. A lot of precious time. I don't \r\nwant to do that anymore. I'm asking you to trust me and let me be in your life. \r\nThe way it should be. The three of us. And you won't regret it. And I'm going to \r\nsay this 'till I'm blue in the face, because I mean it. I will never disappoint \r\nyou again. Never. ",

        "Jackie: Eric. ",
        "Eric: Something elegant \r\nfor someone very dear to me. I'd like to be able to give it to her tonight.\r\n",
        "Jackie: Well, you're going \r\nto have to shop somewhere else. There are plenty of other places that are not \r\nclosed. ",
        "Eric: None of them as \r\nspecial as yours. ",
        "Jackie: Having something \r\nmade up at Forrester not an option? Yes. Yes, it is a bit awkward with Stephanie \r\nin charge. But that's no reason to come here and torment me. ",

        "Eric: No, no, I actually \r\nhad something else in mind. Something a little more elegant. Something with a \r\nlittle more class. ",
        "Jackie: Pearls before \r\nswine. ",
        "Eric: Something like this.\r\n",
        "Jackie: That wouldn't fit \r\nBrooke. It wouldn't even suit Brooke. ",
        "Eric: Fine, I'll take it.\r\n",
        "Jackie: Brooke wouldn't be \r\ncaught dead in this. But if it's what you want, just be sure to read the return \r\npolicy. ",
