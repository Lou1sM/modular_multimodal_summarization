        "Caroline helps Ridge clean up his bloodied and bruised face. He says Bill was defending her honor. She says Ridge is in a committed relationship and she is happily married and yet she fell for him. Now other people she cares about are suffering. He holds her hand tenderly. He says do not take all of this on herself. Rick is having a tantrum and that is different. She cries all of this is her fault and she has to get out of Los Angeles and go back to New York as she has caused too much damage. She brushes past and he can't stop her. When Rick is shown all the orders from the showing, Maya grabs them from his hand and toots her own horn by saying she guesses the lead model knew how to strut her stuff. He says they were Caroline's idea so she gets credit. Maya says but Rick is CEO and he is the one who will get filthy rich. He snaps yeah he will get filthy rich because his wife was unfaithful; he has the golden touch. He says he hates this. At these prices the whole line should have sunk. Eric walks in to hear that. Eric says he wants to talk to his son. Maya pipes up how great the showing was. Eric tells her to give them the room. She looks at Rick who gives her the okay nod to leave. Eric tells him to stop this foolishness now! He laments that Rick set them up to fail. Rick counters that it was a win/win. Either it would be a flop or FC would get rich. Eric gets in his face and tells Rick to knock that smug smile off his face. Those temporary sales won't mean a thing if the public finds out the CEO is acting like a petulant child. Eric points his finger at Rick and tells him to stop this foolishness right now ..shacking up with Maya and flaunting it in front of Caroline and everyone .and now to the point of sabotaging the whole collection. He barks at Rick that he is humiliating himself and the company and he is CEO so act like it. Rick glares at him and says his personal relationships has zero bearings to his capability to being CEO. Eric reminds him that he is married to the designer yet sleeping with the lead model so of course it has bearings. Rick says why should FC profit from something so tainted and dirty. Ridge and Caroline created that line so they can sink with it. He sees no reason that he should want her to succeed. Eric says Rick loves Caroline and that is why he is lashing out but he is making terrible decisions for the company and for himself as well. And Maya is using him. Rick says no, if anything he is using her. Eric tells him do not lose his marriage over this. Rick can't get past that Caroline lied to him. Eric says she made a mistake but she has apologized and he suggests that Rick accepts it and gives it to her. And if he doesn't reconcile Eric will fire him as CEO.",
        "Maya tries to get amongst the press and they all leave. Carter stands close by and laughs at Maya that they seem clueless just how important she is. She gloats to him that she and Rick are solid so there is no way he is going back to Caroline. The CEO and his lead model; it's a fairytale romance. Carter says be careful Cinderella; it might just be that she is the stepsister trying to cram her foot in Caroline's shoe. Rick tells his dad that he can't fire him over this with Caroline. Eric says but he can for not doing what is best for this company. A couple of kisses for Caroline and now Rick wants to move Maya into his mother's house! He should drop to his knees and be thankful that Caroline still wants to be married to him. She apologized for what she has done but what Rick has done is much worse. So he better honor his commitment to her or he will fire him. Caroline is a big part of this company and he won't be surprised if she is head designer one of these days. Shaking his finger again and in his face Eric tells Rick that he promised him that he would run this company fairly from the inside and he would not let his feelings for Caroline and Ridge get in the way and clearly that is not what happened. Rick's eyes tear up when Eric tells him that he is so disappointed in him. Rick says Eric still does not understand what this did to him ..Ridge of all people. Eric says he knows this was hard for him but be a man. He knows he was hurt but if he keeps making decisions like this he can not depend on him to run this company. Now go reunite with Caroline and show him what kind of man he is, disciplined and dedicated. Show him that he can bounce back stronger than before because if he doesn't, then he is done. Ridge catches up with Caroline on the Sky Lounge. He tells her running away is not going to make Bill a better man or change the way Rick feels right now. He tells her she is sort of freaking out and that isn't going to help either. Running away is not the answer; just stay here and work through it. He holds her and says he wouldn't be here now if it weren't for her. Rick throws it to his father that being CEO he has not spent entirely in marital bliss. He points out his mother and Donna and all the other flirtations in between for Eric. He wasn't sipping martinis with Stephanie all these years. He remembers it differently. Now he's trying to hold Rick up to standards that he could not live up to himself. Eric tells him that is exactly what he is doing. Marriage can be hard and things happen. That is what this has been with Caroline making a mistake. But Caroline loves him, that he knows. And he admits he did not have a real good appreciation of Stephanie until the end. He does not want Rick to wait that long. Do this now; man up and get it done. Rick says this is different and starts to speak, but Eric hushes him and then walks out. Rick finds Caroline with Ridge and says he needs to talk to her about \"us\". She says there is no us, he has made that painfully clear. There is just Maya now. Rick asks Ridge to give them a moment. Caroline grabs his arm and says Ridge is not going anywhere. Rick says that is fine. He will say it in front of everyone. He braces himself and admits to Caroline that he made a mistake. He over- reacted. He was filled with hurt and jealousy. He does not want to lose their marriage. That would be like losing everything he cares about in life. He says he needs her and he needs her to forgive him."

        "Ridge: I am -- I'm proud of you. What we accomplished with this showing today is pretty amazing.",
        "Caroline: You know, what happened today... I'll always remember it.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, well, me, too. My face is all messed up.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my God. [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: What's wrong?",
        "Caroline: I cannot believe that my uncle bill did that. I mean, what am I saying? Of course my uncle bill did that.",
        "Ridge: To be fair, he was defending your honor.",
        "Caroline: It's all because I let myself -- I -- you're committed to someone, and I-I was happily married. But I allowed myself to... I've fallen for you. I have.",
        "Rick: How is this possible? Here are more orders and messages. Congratulations, Mr. Forrester.",
        "Rick: Thank you.",
        "Maya: Wait. These are orders already?",
        "Rick: Pouring in.",
        "Maya: Well, I guess your lead model sure knows how to strut her stuff.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] You did great, and I knew that you would, but these prices -- are people crazy?",
        "Maya: Do you know what these orders mean? You are a success.",
        "Rick: No. No, it means that Caroline and Ridge are.",
        "Maya: You're CEO. You're the one who's gonna be filthy rich off this.",
        "Rick: I'm gonna be making money because my wife was unfaithful?! Yeah, lucky me! I must have the golden touch! This whole line should have sunk! I mean, these prices -- they're laughable! I hate this!",
        "Eric: I want to talk to my son.",
        "Maya: Oh, wasn't the show fantast--",
        "Eric: Give us the room, Maya.",
        "Maya: Okay.",
        "Eric: Stop this foolishness now. When all the models were on the stage. I definitely have a cover.",
        "Maya: Hello. Hi. Oh. Take care. Have a good one.",
        "Carter: [Laughs] It's almost as if they have no clue how big and important you are.",
        "Maya: Sounds like you're still a little clueless yourself.",
        "Eric: You set them up to fail.",
        "Rick: Either it would flop, or Forrester would get rich. So it's a win-win.",
        "Eric: You call this a win? Pricing them out?",
        "Rick: Dad, it's not like --",
        "Eric: You're sabotaging the whole line?",
        "Rick: We are receiving orders for record-setting prices, so, yeah, I would say that's a win-win.",
        "Eric: You wipe that smug smile off your face right now. A temporary boost in sales is not gonna mean one damn thing if people realize the CEO of this company is acting like some petulant child. Now, you end this foolishness right now -- shacking up with Maya, flaunting her in front of everybody, in spite of the fact that you're a married man. You're so determined to hurt Caroline that you'd sink the whole collection. You've humiliated yourself, and you're humiliating the company. Now, you're CEO now. Act like it.",
        "Ridge: You don't mean that. You're being emotional. I understand it. It happens. You know --",
        "Caroline: No. [Sighs] It's true. You know, and maybe that's why Rick's acting the way that he is. You know, he could sense that there's something more -- you know, at least for me. I've fallen for you. And now the people that I care about are suffering.",
        "Maya: I was just with Rick.",
        "Carter: No, really?",
        "Maya: Champagne, please. You would not believe the orders that are coming in already.",
        "Carter: Is that why you came back here? To score a couple interviews as the model responsible for the success of the line?",
        "Maya: I wanted to make myself available. Thank you. I didn't expect the room to clear so quickly, but I guess they have reports to file. \"House of Forrester wins again.\" Cheers.",
        "Carter: Thanks to the designs, not the sashaying on the runway. You do get that, right?",
        "Maya: Thanks to the CEO, who wisely priced the gowns high.",
        "Carter: Yeah, well, I'm not exactly convinced he did that for the good of the company.",
        "Maya: [Clears throat]",
        "Carter: Wait, I'm -- am I right?",
        "Maya: He may not be thrilled that the partnership between Ridge and Caroline is paying off, but he sees the bigger picture -- orders plus sales equals money. The company's gonna make a fortune.",
        "Carter: Hoping to add more overpriced jewelry to your collection?",
        "Maya: Maybe Rick's shopping right now.",
        "Rick: My personal relationships have zero bearing on my capabilities as CEO.",
        "Eric: You're married to a designer, and you're sleeping with a model. Of course it has bearing, and you tried to kill Caroline's line.",
        "Rick: Why should Forrester profit from something that is so tainted and so dirty? Ridge and Caroline -- they created that line. They can sink with it. The great partnership that ended my marriage -- why the hell would I want her to succeed?",
        "Eric: Because it's your job. [Sighs] God, Rick. You love Caroline. That's why you're lashing out like this and making terrible decisions for this company, son. And more importantly, you're making terrible decisions for yourself as a man, as well. You're shoving Caroline aside, latching on to Maya. She's using you.",
        "Rick: No, she's not. If anything, I'm using her.",
        "Eric: For what? To try to forget Caroline? Don't lose your marriage over this.",
        "Rick: Dad, she lied to me. She snuck off with Ridge.",
        "Eric: Ah, she just made a mistake, that's all. She got out of control for a while. She's apologized for that. She's asked for your forgiveness, and I suggest you give it to her.",
        "Rick: Why should I?",
        "Eric: Because she's your wife, and if you don't reconcile, I'll fire you as CEO.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Don't do that. Don't put that on yourself. No one is suffering because of you.",
        "Caroline: Rick is.",
        "Ridge: He's having a tantrum. It's very different.",
        "Caroline: No, he's hurting, and look at you. God, look at your face. My uncle did that to you because of me. It's my fault.",
        "Ridge: Let it heal a little bit. It might be an improvement.",
        "Caroline: I've caused you nothing but trouble.",
        "Ridge: That's not true.",
        "Caroline: Yes. Trouble and pain.",
        "Ridge: You didn't hit me. Bill hit me.",
        "Caroline: Because of me.",
        "Ridge: Because he's a pompous ass who doesn't mind his own business.",
        "Caroline: I can't help but think what if I would have just never come to los Angeles? None of this would have happened in the first place.",
        "Ridge: That's true. You're right. It wouldn't have. If you hadn't come, I wouldn't know how to draw, and we wouldn't have this line.",
        "Caroline: No, you would have gotten help. You would have -- you would have reached out to your father. You would have done --",
        "Ridge: That wouldn't have worked. There's something about you. Man, there's something about you. [Sighs] The way we connect, and it's -- it's just -- it did something.",
        "Caroline: It's the connection that -- that caused all those problems. It's the connection that is pushing Rick away from me. It's gonna probably push Katie away from you, and it's all my fault, and I have to -- I have to get out of here.",
        "Ridge: All right, let me drive you.",
        "Caroline: No! I have to get out of los Angeles. I have to get out of here. I need to go back to New York. I need to get away from all of you people. I need to get away from Forrester.",
        "Ridge: This is a good thing.",
        "Caroline: No, I have caused so much damage. I have to --",
        "Ridge: Hey, stop.",
        "Caroline: I have to go!",
        "Carter: Breaking up isn't always permanent, you know.",
        "Maya: [Sighs] Carter. You're a great guy, but I just don't feel that way anymore.",
        "Carter: I'm not talking about us. I'm talking about Rick and Caroline.",
        "Maya: Oh.",
        "Carter: Geez, Maya.",
        "Maya: Well, there's no way that's gonna happen. Rick and I are solid. The CEO and his lead model -- it's a fairy-tale romance.",
        "Carter: And you're Cinderella at the ball. [Chuckles] Be careful, Maya. It might turn out you're just a stepsister trying to cram your foot in Caroline's shoe.",
        "Rick: You can't fire me over whether or not I'm with Caroline.",
        "Eric: You're not working for the benefit of this company. I could fire you for that.",
        "Rick: Let me put it a different way. I wish to be with Maya.",
        "Eric: Oh, stop it. A couple of kisses between Caroline and Ridge, and you want to move another woman into your mother's house? You should drop to your knees and thank God this girl still wants to be married to you.",
        "Rick: She betrayed me.",
        "Eric: Oh, she -- she got out of hand there for a while. It's no big deal. She apologized for that. What you've done is much worse. Now, you honor your commitment to her.",
        "Rick: Or what? You'll fire me?",
        "Eric: Yes. Now, Caroline's gonna be a big part of the future of this company. If she continues on the way she is, being mentored by Ridge, it wouldn't surprise me at all if she were the head designer of this company one day.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I don't deny that, dad, but it doesn't mean that I have to be married to the woman.",
        "Eric: You promised me! You promised me that you would run this company fairly from the inside. You promised me that you would not let your feelings for Ridge and Caroline get in the way. Well, clearly, that has not happened. I'm -- I'm so disappointed in you.",
        "Rick: [Voice breaking] You just don't understand, do you, Dad? You don't understand. You don't understand what this did to me. I mean, Ridge -- Ridge, of all people? God. [Sighs]",
        "Eric: Be a man, Rick. Come on. I know this was hard for you. I know. I know it hurt, and I know it embarrassed you. But if you keep making decisions like this, I'm not gonna be able to depend on you to run this company. I'm not.",
        "Rick: You would really push me out?",
        "Eric: Absolutely. Now, you -- you reunite with Caroline. You show me the kind of man you are -- dedicated, disciplined. You show me that you're the kind of man that bounces back from adversity stronger than he was before. You show me that, 'cause if you don't -- if you don't stop this foolishness, you're done.",
        "Caroline: [Panting] [Inhales, exhales deeply]",
        "Ridge: Hey. You came to help me clean up. Thank you.",
        "Caroline: God. Is this where?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I think he wanted to throw me over the edge, but...",
        "Caroline: God, see, this is exactly why I have to leave.",
        "Ridge: Running back to new York's not gonna make your uncle a better man, and it's not gonna make Rick forget about the pain he's feeling, either.",
        "Caroline: But he won't have to see me, and I-I won't have to see you.",
        "Ridge: You're gonna have to forget about me.",
        "Caroline: I can't. Don't you understand? I-I can't. What have I done?",
        "Ridge: Hey, hey. What are you doing? Try and pull it together, all right?",
        "Caroline: [Breathes deeply]",
        "Ridge: I know this is hard. It's complicated. But running away's not gonna fix it, all right? And freaking out's not gonna help.",
        "Caroline: I am not freaking out.",
        "Ridge: You kind of are. You got to breathe. Hey, look at me. You have a lot to be grateful for and a lot to be proud of.",
        "Caroline: I messed everything up. I failed Rick. I failed our marriage.",
        "Ridge: Running away is not gonna fix it.",
        "Caroline: What else can I do?",
        "Ridge: You can stay here. And you work through it and make Rick realize he's the one that's screwing up this marriage.",
        "Caroline: What about us? You don't need me anymore. You can design on your own. You -- you probably never needed me in the first place.",
        "Ridge: I wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for you.",
        "Rick: Your reign as CEO was not spent in marital bliss. You say my running around with a model is tarnishing the company. What about you? What about you, dad? What about the marriages to my mom and Donna and all the other flirtations in between? Have you convinced yourself that it was just you and Stephanie happily sipping martinis all these years? Because I remember it differently. It's as if you're trying to hold me to some standard that you were never able to live up to yourself.",
        "Eric: That's exactly what I'm doing. Marriage -- marriage can be hard. Bad things happen, and that's what this has been. Look, Caroline made a mistake. But one thing is clear -- she loves you. I did not develop a real appreciation of Stephanie until right at the end there. I don't want you to wait that long to tell Caroline how much you feel for her.",
        "Rick: This is different.",
        "Eric: You do this now, or you're done.",
        "Rick: Dad.",
        "Eric: Man up, Rick. Man up.",
        "Ridge: Caroline.",
        "Caroline: I begged Rick. You know, at first, I thought he was just lashing out, you know, and Maya was taking advantage of him. And I-I-I was willing to forgive that, but it just keeps going on. You know, and I'm -- am I supposed to let that drive me away from here, from this, from my job, from...you? You know, and maybe part of me is glad that he showed this side of himself, that -- you know, and jumping to Maya, because maybe it just tells me that I... shouldn't go back to Rick. I should move forward. All these weeks, you know, we're hand in hand, creating. It's like nothing I've ever experienced before. It's this intimacy that I didn't even know was possible. You know, and... I haven't let myself admit it, but in this very...bizarre way...it's kind of like it's coming full circle -- Ridge Forrester and -- and Caroline Spencer.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ridge: Oh, great. Got to get beat up again.",
        "Rick: I'd like to talk to you...about us.",
        "Caroline: There is no us. You made that very clear -- wanting a divorce, Maya.",
        "Rick: Could you please give us a moment?",
        "Caroline: No, he's not going anywhere.",
        "Rick: All right, that's fine. I'll say it in front of him. [Sighs] I made a mistake. I overreacted. I was filled with -- with hurt and jealousy. I don't want our marriage to end, Caroline. To lose you -- it would be like losing everything I care about in life. I need you. Could you please forgive me?"
