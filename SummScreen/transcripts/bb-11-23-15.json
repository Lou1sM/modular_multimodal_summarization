{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7203 ~ Steff regrets the wager she made with Thomas about a conquest with Ivy; Nicole's favor to Maya & Rick begins to have an adverse effect on her relationship with Zende."], "Recap": ["Next day Ivy thinks about the night before with Thomas. He walks into the office and says he is thinking about last night too. She pretends to just be focusing on the office business. He kisses her and she stops him and says last night was fun but it will never happen again. She does not want him to get the wrong idea. She does not do that, ever in her life. She says she is glad he did not push her to the next level. She feels like she did something so terribly wrong but right at the same time. He said they needed that. She wonders what does she say to her boyfriend. Wyatt tells Steffy that it was a successful trip. The jewels were exquisite, but Quinn adds not as much as that ring on her finger. Zende shows up to see Nicole and says he had his first business trip. She says it is the first time that he has seen her pregnant, so does she look any different, like a glow or something. He says he is still trying to wrap his head around it but she looks the same. She wonders if there is a change in him or how he feels now that she is pregnant. He says he has not lied to her and he will not start now. He wishes she were not pregnant. He wants them to grow together but that can not happen now. She has another top priority now. He wants her all to himself, not share her just yet. The baby should be #1 and he wants her to be proud of her decision. He still supports her and that won't change. She says it has changed. He has not seen her in days and he still has not kissed her. Maybe it will gross him out now that she is pregnant.", "Wyatt is distracted thinking about Ivy and can not focus on the meeting with Quinn and Steffy. He excuses himself. Thomas tells Ivy that there is no need to tell Wyatt anything, just will get her in trouble. Just believe in serendipity. If they had gone all the way then they would still be in bed right now. He wants a repeat of last night and invites her back over to prepare Thanksgiving. Wyatt walks in and Ivy and Wyatt gravitate to each other's arms despite Thomas being there. Wyatt says he hopes she enjoyed last night as he has big plans for tonight. Thomas says they were in the middle of something, designing his dress with her jewels. Wyatt says he will fire up the grill and get a bottle of wine and be ready for tonight. Alone, Thomas says she is a free agent. There is no ring and no commitment so she does not have to say anything to Wyatt, just let this play out. Wyatt speaks with Steffy and she questions him of what he is doing tonight. He needs to tell Ivy that he missed her and is making it up to her tonight. Thomas says Ivy needs to spend more time with him and figure this out who she really wants to be with. She says she loves Wyatt so she should not even be considering this. He says she is beautiful and young and they can be a little crazy. She says she has never been attracted to two people at the same time so she does not know what to do. He kisses her passionately and she definitely does not pull away but kisses him back."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Thomas: Yeah, I was thinking about it, too.", "Ivy: [Sighs]", "Thomas: Door was open.", "Ivy: Mm-hmm.", "Thomas: How you doing?", "Ivy: Good. Functioning. What about you?", "Thomas: Yeah. Good. Barely functioning.", "Ivy: Yeah, I think that's an overstatement. So, do you, uh, do you need something or...", "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah, actually, I-I do.", "Ivy: Okay, Thomas, Thomas, last night, it was -- it was so good. It was so good but --", "Thomas: But incomplete.", "Ivy: [Sighs] Why do you guys always want more?", "Thomas: Because kissing is kind of like -- it's kind of like taking one lick of an ice cream cone.", "Ivy: [Inhales sharply] Whoa. You need to be careful of your metaphors from now on.", "Thomas: [Laughs] Come on. You didn't want any more?", "Ivy: Thomas, look, it was great. It was fun, but it shouldn't have happened.", "Thomas: Wrong. It should have happened. And it should happen again and again...and again.", "Ivy: I have a boyfriend.", "Thomas: Oh, yeah. Yeah, you do. Me.", "Ivy: Not you. Wyatt.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Sounds like a successful trip.", "Quinn: Yeah, we brought back a case of samples.", "Wyatt: Yeah, here's a few of them right here, and the rest are locked up in the vault, so...", "Quinn: Yeah. The stones are beautiful, but... not nearly as exquisite as the one on your finger!", "Wyatt: Whoa!", "Steffy: Yeah. This old thing? Yeah.", "Wyatt: I can't leave you alone for one night.", "Steffy: It was -- it was totally unexpected.", "Quinn: Well, I guess congratulations are in order.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Steffy: Oh, thank -- yeah, thank you.", "Wyatt: Liam's a lucky guy. Then again, so is his brother, right?", "Steffy: Wait. You haven't seen Ivy since you got back?", "Wyatt: No, not yet. But, uh, I can't wait.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: So, your first business trip. I'm really proud of you.", "Zende: Yeah, it's pretty exciting.", "Nicole: Oh, around here, too. [Chuckles] I mean, do I look any different?", "Zende: [Chuckles]", "Nicole: What?", "Zende: Nothing. Uh, I was thinking about that on the plane.", "Nicole: Well, I mean, it's the first time you've seen me pregnant. What do you think? I'm supposed to have some special glow, right?", "Zende: That's what they say, isn't it?", "Nicole: Well?", "Zende: I don't know. I'm still wrapping my head around it. Um, I mean, I still can't believe it worked on the first try.", "Nicole: Has there been a change?", "Zende: No, not really. I mean, you look pretty much the same.", "Nicole: [Scoffs] In you. Has there been a change in you, Zende? Do you feel differently about me now that I'm pregnant? I guess the better question to ask is, do you wish that I weren't pregnant?", "Zende: Do I wish you weren't pregnant? Of course. Of course I do. Look, I haven't lied to you, and I'm not gonna start now.", "Nicole: I would hope not.", "Zende: This is all still very new to me, these feelings. I want to be with you. I want to do things. I want to grow together. You want the same things, right?", "Nicole: Of course I do.", "Zende: Well, it can't happen, at least not now.", "Nicole: Yes, it can.", "Zende: Look, Nic, this -- this whole thing, you and me, it's not top priority. You have a baby to think about now. And I know it sounds selfish, but I wanted you all to myself. We are just beginning. I don't want to share you, not yet.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: That is one hell of a rock.", "Wyatt: Yeah, my brother did a great job.", "Quinn: As did you, sweetheart.", "Wyatt: Indeed. Thank you.", "Quinn: I can't wait for Ivy to see these stones that we brought back.", "Wyatt: Yeah, you know, I mean, she's gonna want to get right to work. We can wait a little bit. I just -- I have a little catching up I'd like to do first.", "Steffy: How was she when you talked to her last night?", "Wyatt: She was a little preoccupied. But I guess I caught her in the middle of work.", "Steffy: Was she at the office?", "Wyatt: No, the Forrester house, where she lives with rick and Eric and Maya.", "Quinn: And Thomas lives there, too.", "Wyatt: Seriously?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: You know, last night was really unlike me.", "Thomas: You're telling me this why?", "Ivy: Well, I just don't want you getting the wrong idea, that's all.", "Thomas: That we had fun, that we enjoyed ourselves? That wrong idea?", "Ivy: Now, I'm trying to tell you that I don't do that ever. Never in my entire life.", "Thomas: Hey, it was just a few kisses. Whatever.", "Ivy: Actually, I wanted to thank you for that.", "Thomas: You don't have to thank me for kissing you, Ivy.", "Ivy: No, I want to thank you for not pushing things to the next level, if you know what I mean.", "Thomas: Wait, did you want me to?", "Ivy: No!", "Thomas: Oh, well, gold star for being a gentleman.", "Ivy: [Chuckles] God, I just -- I feel like -- I feel like I've done something so terribly wrong and something... so right all at the same time.", "Thomas: Well, you're 50% correct about the \"right\" part. Come on. You needed that. We needed that.", "Ivy: Can you answer me something?", "Thomas: Hmm?", "Ivy: What do I tell Wyatt? What do I say to my boyfriend?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Hey, I'm -- I'm sorry, okay? I didn't mean to bring you down.", "Nicole: I only want you to be honest with me.", "Zende: Is everything okay with the pregnancy?", "Nicole: Good so far.", "Zende: Do you feel any different?", "Nicole: Not yet. Well, I mean, maybe a little. I'm aware of something that I wasn't aware of before.", "Zende: Yeah? What's that?", "Nicole: Life. Life that is more than my own. I've never felt responsible for anyone but myself. And I always prided myself in my independence. I did what I wanted, and nobody controlled me but me. And now suddenly I'm not responsible for just me anymore. There is a life growing in here. And it just... changes your perspective on things. Does it change anything for you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Oh, wow. They're exquisite.", "Quinn: Yeah. What's exquisite is the way I negotiated the price. Isn't that right, Wyatt?", "Wyatt: Huh? Oh, yeah, Mom was a real shyster. I mean, I-I felt bad for those dudes.", "Quinn: Do you want to try and pretend to be part of this meeting?", "Wyatt: What? I'm sor-- I'm a little -- okay, I'm a little preoccupied.", "Quinn: He was like this all last night.", "Wyatt: How was I like this -- what are you talk-- I missed her.", "Quinn: Okay, I think it's a little bit more than missing her.", "Steffy: Really?", "Quinn: Yeah, yeah. Your brother has a wandering eye, but I'm sure you know all about that.", "Wyatt: Okay, can we stop this, please?", "Steffy: I-I don't -- I don't get involved in my brother's personal life.", "Quinn: Well, that's very smart, because I'm sure it would take up a considerable amount of your time.", "Wyatt: Okay, I think that's it for me. Uh, Steffy, are you gonna be okay alone with my mother here?", "Steffy: We'll be good. Go find Ivy for your welcome home.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "[Door closes]", "Thomas: Why tell Wyatt anything about last night?", "Ivy: Oh. [Sighs] I don't know. Just a little thing called, uh... actually, you've probably never even heard of it.", "Thomas: What?", "Ivy: Honesty.", "Thomas: Oh, yeah, no, no, I've heard of it. It's, uh, it gets you in trouble.", "Ivy: No, it's the opposite, actually. It keeps you out of trouble.", "Thomas: Okay, what are you gonna tell Wyatt that keeps you out of trouble?", "Ivy: Uh, I don't know. I'll just tell him it was just a few kisses.", "Thomas: Few kisses. Yeah. Few very hot kisses. Honesty.", "Ivy: You're not helping.", "Thomas: I ju-- I just think you're overthinking this. Come on. Are you one of those people that believes in serendipity?", "Ivy: Yeah.", "Thomas: So, last night...", "Ivy: So, last night I learned that I really missed Wyatt.", "Thomas: And did you learn that while you were kissing me?", "Ivy: I learned that in retrospect.", "Thomas: In retrospect, we should have gone a lot further.", "Ivy: That would have been a disaster!", "Thomas: Trust me -- if we would have gone all the way last night, we wouldn't be having this conversation. We would still be in bed.", "Ivy: I don't even know how I let this happen.", "Thomas: Well, come back to the house tonight and we can kind of figure it out.", "Ivy: Oh, yeah, right. Mm-hmm.", "Thomas: Yeah. Why not? Just say you're helping prep for thanksgiving dinner.", "Ivy: Lie to him again?", "Thomas: Well, yeah. It's not lying. I mean, we can actually do some things in the kitchen.", "Ivy: Do some things in -- in the kitchen? I can't even imagine what that means.", "Thomas: So, call Wyatt and tell him that Pam needs help. He'll go for it. I want a repeat of last night, and so do you.", "Ivy: Thomas, that can't happen.", "Thomas: It can, and it will.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Hey, hey!", "Ivy: Hey!", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "Ivy: Hello.", "Wyatt: Hi.", "Ivy: Hmm. Hmm.", "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.", "Thomas: So, how was your trip?", "Wyatt: Mnh-mnh. Excuse me a second. I am kissing my girl here, thank you very much.", "Ivy: Aww.", "Wyatt: Hmm. You could not have missed me more than I missed you, okay? And the trip was amazing. We got some incredible gemstones.", "Ivy: Oh.", "Wyatt: I hope you finished all your work last night, because I have big plans for us tonight. Hmm? [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Does this pregnancy change anything, Nicole?", "Nicole: Of course, it does. [Clears throat]", "Zende: You said it yourself. You're responsible for another life now. That's a huge commitment.", "Nicole: But it's not my only commitment.", "Zende: Maybe not, but it's your biggest. It has to be. Look, I don't want to compete with that. I can't. That baby should be number one.", "Nicole: And that's a problem for you?", "Zende: No.", "Nicole: But?", "Zende: No buts. Look, I want you to be proud of the decision that you made. No, it doesn't help our situation, but that doesn't detract from the fact that you're doing this amazing thing for rick and Maya.", "Nicole: It's only amazing because I have your support.", "Zende: I still support you. That hasn't changed.", "Nicole: Something else has.", "Zende: What?", "Nicole: The way you're looking at me. I mean, I haven't seen you in days, and you haven't even kissed me. You want to talk about huge? That's...huge. I don't really feel like I'm attractive to you right now. Does it gross you out... knowing that I'm pregnant?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: We're kind of in the middle of something right here.", "Wyatt: Oh. Oh, yeah? What you doing?", "Thomas: Accessorizing this dress.", "Wyatt: Oh. Well, that should take all of about five minutes. I can wait.", "Thomas: It's one of 10.", "Wyatt: That's the only one I see in here.", "Thomas: I'm having the rest of them brought up.", "Wyatt: Are you really now?", "Thomas: Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Hey, tell me about san Francisco.", "Thomas: Yeah, did you leave your heart out there?", "Wyatt: Nope. I left it right here.", "Ivy: Aww. What about the gemstones?", "Wyatt: Oh, it was great. Uh, I'm gonna tell you all about that later tonight, though. Speaking of which, how was it staying at the Forrester mansion again?", "Ivy: Oh, you know, it was just the usual.", "Wyatt: Usual, yeah? Getting reacquainted with your bedroom?", "Ivy: Yeah.", "Wyatt: Snuggling all alone -- that can't be very fun.", "Ivy: [Chuckles]", "Thomas: Oh, I heard it builds character doing that. You should do it more often.", "Wyatt: Ha ha! I've been gone for one night. It feels like a month. [Chuckles]", "Ivy: I know. It does.", "Wyatt: I'm gonna make it up to you, though, okay? Fire up the grill, open a bottle of wine, just totally chill. Does that sound good?", "Ivy: Mm-hmm. It does.", "Wyatt: God, I missed you.", "Ivy: Hmm.", "[Cell phone chimes]", "Wyatt: Huh? Oh, Steffy needs me. Uh, I will catch you later. Is that okay?", "Ivy: Yeah.", "Wyatt: All right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thomas: Ivy, there's no ring, no commitment. There's no reason to feel all this guilt.", "Ivy: Thomas, I don't know what to do.", "Thomas: Nothing. Let it play out.", "Ivy: Let it -- let it play out? I don't even know what that means.", "Thomas: You're a free agent. Listen to the offers.", "Ivy: And what are you offering me, Thomas?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Gross me out?", "Nicole: Does it?", "Zende: What? All because I didn't grab you when I walked in the door?", "Nicole: You didn't even touch me!", "Zende: I've been going through something, Nicole.", "Nicole: Yeah. That's what I was afraid of.", "Zende: You knew how I felt about you being a surrogate.", "Nicole: You were against it.", "Zende: But do you see me running for the hills? I'll do my best.", "Nicole: That doesn't answer my question. Do you still feel the same about me? Do you still want me?", "Zende: Do I still want you?", "Nicole: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Dad and Caroline are gonna love these new stones. They're perfect for the Couture line.", "Wyatt: All right. Anything else?", "Steffy: I-I think that's it, yeah.", "Wyatt: All right.", "Steffy: Actually, uh, uh, wait. Um... uh, what are you doing tonight?", "Wyatt: Uh, just hanging out with the lady.", "Steffy: Oh, that's -- that's nice.", "Wyatt: Yeah. I think she needs it just as much as I do, so...", "Steffy: Why?", "Wyatt: What do you mean, why? She wishes I'd taken her to San Francisco.", "Steffy: Oh, she -- she said that?", "Wyatt: No. But she just wasn't acting herself, and I'll just -- I'll fix that tonight.", "Steffy: Yeah, you do that.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Steffy: Let her know how much she means to you.", "Wyatt: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Thomas: We had a great time last night, didn't we?", "Ivy: Yeah, against my better judgment.", "Thomas: All I'm saying is, do what you want to do, not what you're supposed to do.", "Ivy: I don't know what I want to do anymore because of you.", "Thomas: Well, there's your answer. Let's figure it out.", "Ivy: But how do I do that? By spending more time with you?", "Thomas: Yeah, why not?", "Ivy: What is that gonna lead to?", "Thomas: Figuring yourself out, self-realization. Isn't that what we all want?", "Ivy: Mm-hmm.", "Thomas: Yeah? So, what are you gonna do? You gonna go home with Wyatt and think about me, or are you gonna go home with me...", "Ivy: And think about Wyatt.", "Thomas: Don't think that'll happen.", "Ivy: [Sighs]", "Thomas: Come on. The thanksgiving idea is a great idea. He'll go for it.", "Ivy: Oh, my God. I can't even believe I'm -- I'm considering this.", "Thomas: But -- but -- but you are. You are. And we both know why. Come on, we are both attracted to each other.", "Ivy: I love Wyatt. What the hell am I doing?", "Thomas: It's okay, it's okay. Calm down, all right? You're a lady. It's one of the reasons I'm crazy about you. This is -- this is new to you. But you're not married, you're not engaged, you're not committed right now. You're young. Now's the time to be a little crazy.", "Ivy: No. I-I don't know! I don't know. I've never been in this position before. I've never been attracted to two people. It doesn't feel like me.", "Thomas: But it is you.", "Ivy: [Sighs heavily]", "Thomas: The answer is simple, Ivy. What do you want?", "Ivy: I -- [Sighs]", "Thomas: Hey. What do you want, Ivy?"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_W016dQP78"}
