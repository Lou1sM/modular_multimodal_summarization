{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7722 ~ Thorne returns to Los Angeles from Paris, much to the dismay of his older brother, Ridge; confused by the sudden change in dynamic within his family, Wyatt demands answers from Bill."], "Recap": ["Brooke, Ridge and Eric discuss this was the best Thanksgiving yet. Eric says he does not want to put words in their mouths but he would like to see them as happy as he and Quinn are. Surprise \u0096 Thorne walks in. Brooke gives him a hug and Ridge manages a \"welcome home little brother.\" He asks how has Paris been treating him. Eric wants to know why he did not let them know and get here in time for Thanksgiving. Thorne says it was more fun this way. Bill thinks back to Steffy telling him that she and Liam renewed their wedding vows. Wyatt walks in and says he has to know \u0096 now they are all one big happy family! Seems on Thanksgiving he and Liam were all hunky dory again, so he just wants to catch up on the situation. Liam asks Steffy what is on her mind; a penny for her thoughts but he would be selling her short. She says she was happy that he and his father made up. He says yes and he would not have done that except for his tenacious wife. He knows he can speak for his father too that they are both so grateful to her. He says he almost lost everything \u0096 his dad, his job, even Steffy and he is so sorry that he caused so much pain. It is his first day back in the office and he wants her to go with him. It is a big day, a new beginning with more male bonding and she is responsible for that. He asks her to please say she will come.", "Wyatt says he is the son who has never betrayed Bill so he'd like to get a straight answer. Steffy found a way to forgive Liam as she is like that. Bill agrees that she is in a class by herself. Wyatt says Liam is back now where he belongs. Thorne admires the portrait of Quinn who is not there at the moment but Eric tells him how happy he is with her. Thorne says after Aly died he had to get away; there is an emptiness inside that will never go away but he realizes now that it is time \u0096 time for him to move back to L.A. He misses all of them, his home and his job here in L.A. He tells Brooke that he heard she was divorcing Bill and asks if she and Ridge are back on. Ridge says yes about the same time that Brooke says not really. Ridge says they will make it right the way it should have been in the beginning. Liam walks in and then Steffy, saying she needed to be here on his first day back. Family comes first and there is nothing more important than that and he gets it now thanks to Steffy who never gave up. Bill says he is still committed to Spencer but also Skye too and to getting Sally in a new location. He'd like to sit down with Sally personally and get her thoughts. Liam does not even have to be involved. Liam says he knows he went too far with Sally so he is okay with Bill now taking over. He may not always agree with Bill but he will give him his respect. Thorne tells Ridge that he noticed he was not as enthusiastic about his return as the others, especially the little brother thing that he'd like to be dropped. Ridge says he is coming here with a big chip on his shoulder trying to antagonize him and that won't work. And he will not call Thorne half- brother as they all know he was raised in this same house and where they all came from."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Eric: This was a good thanksgiving.", "Brooke: They always are.", "Eric: It still fills my heart.

Makes me wonder if, um...", "Brooke: Wonder what?", "Eric: Well, I don't want to put either one of you on the spot, uh, but I really would like to see you happy, as happy as quinn and I are, preferably together.", "Ridge: See, that would work for me.", "Eric: Now, see? And I would welcome you into the family very gladly.", "Brooke: [ Chuckles ] Okay. Did you put him up to this? You did.", "Ridge: Absolutely not, but now that you guys are talking about it, I would very gladly spend the rest of my days with you, yes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: [ Laughs ] Oh, my.", "Thorne: [ Clears throat ]", "Brooke: [ Gasps ]", "Thorne: Surprise.", "Brooke: Thorne!

I can't go back. So, yeah, I am very serious. I love you, steffy.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you, dad.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Last to know, checking in.", "Bill: What?", "Wyatt: What the hell is going on around here? All of a sudden, we're, what, one, big happy family?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: I have to say this, steffy. I have to say this. You are the most important thing in my life.

And you look as beautiful as always.", "Brooke: Handsome as ever.", "Eric: You're a welcome sight, thorne.", "Ridge: So... how is paris treating you, little brother?", "Thorne: It's been good. What I needed. How are things with you?", "Ridge: I can't complain.", "Eric: So why didn't you let us know you were coming?", "Thorne: Because it's more fun to surprise you, dad.", "Eric: Oh, you did that!", "Brooke: We're just happy to have you back home, thorne. Oh!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Chuckles ]", "Bill: Are you objecting to something?", "Wyatt: How about me constantly having to put the pieces together about my own family?", "Bill: What the hell are you talking about?", "Wyatt: You and liam are always keeping me out of the loop on everything! And it's hard to keep up with the back and forth and back and forth.", "Bill: I tell you all kinds of things!", "Wyatt: No, you don't! Like at thanksgiving! You and liam are all of a sudden all hunky dory, all's forgiven? I'm just trying to keep up here.", "Bill: We're putting the past in the past. That's all, okay?", "Wyatt: Okay, so, what? The spencers are making a fresh start?", "Bill: That's exactly what it is. And exactly what I want.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You okay?", "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah. I'm just, uh...thinking about everything that happened lately.", "Liam: Yeah, well, it's been a lot.", "Steffy: So much at stake.", "Liam: And not just for you and me. I mean, [Chuckles] I almost lost my father. I really couldn't see a way back from all of that. The fire was bad enough, but when he demo'd the spectra building with sally and me inside, that was it. I mean, I was done. I was never gonna speak to him again. I was never gonna set foot inside the spencer building again. [ Sighs ] Hey.", "Steffy: I'm just, uh... I'm just happy that you and your father made up. I know this has been really hard for you both.", "Liam: Yeah, but, steffy, I-i wouldn't have forgiven him if it weren't for my tenacious wife, who happens not to know the meaning of the phrase \"lost cause.\"", "Steffy: Yeah, I guess some people call that stubborn.", "Liam: Yeah, well, I call it working a miracle. Listen, I know I can speak for my dad when I say we are both so grateful to you.", "Liam: I could have saved us all a lot of time and grief by listening to you in the first place.", "Steffy: You might want to remember that.", "Liam: I almost lost everything. My dad, my job, you. Steffy, I am so sorry for what happened with sally, and I am so -- I am so grateful that you chose to forgive me. And I promise I will never betray you like that again. Never. We should go.", "Steffy: We?", "Liam: Uh, I want, uh, I want you to come with me to spencer.", "Steffy: Why?", "Liam: Well, first day back at the office. I, uh, I have some things to say to the family.", "Steffy: Oh, well, you know, I've been there, you know, enough, and I think maybe it'll be good for the three of you. Spencer male bonding.", "Liam: Yeah. [ Laughs ] I'm sure there will be plenty of that, but -- no, but it's a big day. It's a new beginning for our family, and that includes you, steffy, the person responsible for bringing us all back together, remember? I really, really need you there with me. Please say you'll come.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: What's with the cross-examination? Aren't you happy that your brother and I are finally getting along?", "Wyatt: What? That's not what I said. What I said was there's a piece missing, the bridge between, uh, \"I never want to see you again\" and \"oh, oh, can you please pass the gravy?\"", "Bill: What difference does it make how it happened?", "Wyatt: Are you kid-- you remember me? I'm your son that's always been on your side! I've never betrayed you! You remember? Why can't I get a straight answer for once?", "Bill: You're making a bigger deal out of this than it is, wyatt.", "Wyatt: Oh, okay. Then you'll excuse my paranoia.", "Bill: All right, look, liam was finally coming to terms with this obsession with sally and what it was costing him, namely his wife.", "Wyatt: Right. Steffy found a way to forgive him because she's amazing like that, even though he betrayed her with, like, the worst possible enemy that he could. She found a way to take him back. And now they renewed their vows. And, you know, that goes to show you what kind of woman steffy is.", "Bill: Yeah. She's in a class by herself.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Birds chirping ]", "Eric: You're admiring my beautiful wife. That's all right. I do that myself sometimes.", "Thorne: Quinn around?", "Eric: No, no, she isn't, but she's gonna be just as happy to see you as I am.", "Thorne: You look happy, dad.", "Eric: Good. I wake up every morning so glad to spend another day with this beautiful woman. She's been a real gift to me, a gift I never expected. So, happy? Happy doesn't begin to describe it.", "Thorne: Well, it's good enough for me.", "Eric: [ Chuckles ] Good.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: So, how have things been with you, thorne? How is life in paris?", "Thorne: Well, it's paris, right? How bad can it be? After aly died, I-I needed time to mourn, so I threw myself into work.", "Eric: I'm not at all surprised.", "Brooke: I know that you miss her. I do.", "Ridge: We all do.", "Thorne: There's an emptiness inside that can never be filled. But life goes on, right? Even when it's a struggle. And I've realized it's -- it's time.", "Ridge: It's time for what?", "Thorne: I'm moving back to L.A.", "Brooke: [ Laughs ] Are you serious?", "Eric: What?! I couldn't be happier! I would love that!", "Ridge: Seems a little sudden, doesn't it?", "Thorne: Not sudden. It's something I've been weighing. Paris is amazing. But my family's here. And I miss you guys. I miss the company. This is home.", "Eric: I'd be very glad to welcome my son back. And -- and we can use you at forrester. Right, ridge?", "Ridge: Hmm.", "Eric: So, what are you gonna do? You want to move in here for a while?", "Thorne: Dad, come on. You and quinn need your space. I wouldn't want to intrude.", "Brooke: So where are you gonna stay?", "Thorne: I'm not sure yet. I'll probably just get a room until I figure it out.", "Brooke: Okay. Well, the important thing is that you're home, thorne.", "Eric: [ Chuckles ] Come here. Come here.", "Thorne: I didn't mean to interrupt when I came in. Were you guys in the middle of something?", "Ridge: Brooke was discussing how she wants to spend the rest of her life with me. Right?", "Thorne: I heard you're divorcing bill.", "Brooke: Sadly, yes.", "Thorne: So you two are back on?", "Brooke: No.", "Ridge: Oh, yeah. What are you...", "Brooke: Uh, I just didn't want to rush anything.", "Thorne: Sounds like a plan.", "Ridge: Don't discourage her. It's not helping.", "Thorne: Dare I ask what happened?", "Brooke: Uh, unlike eric and quinn, bill and I were not a perfect match.", "Ridge: And I told her that from the very beginning.", "Eric: The divorce will take a few months. Give brooke some breathing room, will give her a chance to work things out.", "Ridge: And give her a chance to find her way home. Our home.", "Brooke: Ridge.", "Ridge: Put our family back together. R.J. Would be thrilled.", "Eric: And I would be, too.", "Ridge: We'll make things right, the way they should have been from the very beginning.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: It still blows me away. I mean, liam spent what he thought were the last moments of his life making out with sally spectra.", "[ Scoffs ]", "Bill: Not liam's finest hour. Hit steffy hard.", "Wyatt: You know, well, he's lucky that she even took him back. But I guess walking out on him probably made him come to his senses, right? Do you know how long she was gone, where she went? Ah, doesn't matter. She's back home now, and they are newly committed to each other. I doubt anybody's ever gonna come between them again.", "Liam: Hey.", "Bill: Ah! [ Chuckles ] Welcome back, son.", "Wyatt: Steffy. Didn't expect to see you here. That is not a complaint, by the way.", "Liam: [ Chuckles ] I, uh, it's my first day back at spencer, and I-I kind of wanted to bring my wife since she's the reason I'm here.", "Steffy: Well, I-I don't have to stay.", "Wyatt: Come on. You stay as long as you want. We don't mind having you around. Right, dad?", "Bill: Always.", "Steffy: Liam insisted I come.", "Liam: Of course I did. I mean, you're the one. You're the one who fought for my father and me. You pounded it into my thick head that family comes first. And I really -- I really did feel that at thanksgiving, looking around the room and seeing all the people I belong to, and I get it. Family does come first. There's nothing more important than that. And I thank you for not letting me throw it away.", "Wyatt: Okay, before we give hugs all around here, uh, there is an issue that's still on the table. The plans to build are still on schedule, aren't they?", "Bill: Oh, uh, absolutely. I'm fully committed to sky. Uh, but equally committed to spectra, getting them up and running. I'll spare no expense.", "Wyatt: You mean that?", "Bill: It's the right thing to do.", "Liam: I really appreciate you extending a hand.", "Bill: I'll get the spectras relaunched in a new location, a good one. I want to see to it they are made fully whole.", "Wyatt: And you're good with this?", "Steffy: Yeah, whatever keeps the peace.", "Bill: Uh, I'd also like to, um, you know, sit down with sally personally, get her thoughts, her input.", "Liam: Oh, my god, I think that's -- that's an excellent idea.", "Bill: And you don't even have to be involved. I'll have alison set it up.", "Liam: [ Chuckles ] That's great! Thank you. Thank you.", "Wyatt: Okay, I feel like I'm in a parallel universe here.", "Liam: Why? 'Cause dad and i are actually getting along?", "Wyatt: Yeah, it's kind of taking me by surprise here.", "Liam: Well, I mean, look at her. I mean, steffy really made me realize some things. First of all, I-I did. I went -- I went too far in my defense of sally and her company. And it's not that I don't believe in their cause. I do. But I just -- there had to be a solution that didn't involve me destroying my own relationships, going up against my father and ousting him from his company. I betrayed you. That was -- that was a betrayal, and it won't happen again. And I may not always agree with you or your methods, but I will give you my respect. And I will give you my loyalty, like you've always given me yours.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thorne: I couldn't help but notice you weren't as enthusiastic about my homecoming as dad and brooke. If you have a problem, now's a good time to say so.", "Ridge: Really? And you would just get on a plane and leave?", "Thorne: No, but at least I'd know where we stand.", "Ridge: You know where you stand. This is family. I always assumed you liked paris. If you want to come home, of course you can. You're always welcome here, little brother.", "Thorne: Hey, ridge, about the, uh, \"little brother\" thing, let's drop it, okay?", "Ridge: Are you kidding me right now?", "Thorne: No, I'm not.", "Ridge: Wow, I didn't mean to offend you. It's just -- when did you become so sensitive? What happened?", "Thorne: No, no, not sensitive. Just a grown man. You're equal. I don't need you calling me little anymore.", "Ridge: It's a term of endearment.", "Thorne: It's condescending. I mean, if you have to call me something brother, then try \"half.\"", "Ridge: Half?", "Thorne: Half-brother more accurately describes what I am to you.", "Ridge: Really?", "Thorne: Yeah, well, I'm not the one walking around with marone dna, am I?", "Ridge: You're gonna say that to me in the house where I was raised?", "Thorne: None of us should ever forget where we came from.", "Ridge: No, absolutely not. You come in here with this big chip on your shoulder trying to antagonize me. It's a bad idea. A really bad idea... little brother."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFVnsB2Er2k"}
