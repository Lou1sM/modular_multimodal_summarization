{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7724 ~ Eric is caught off guard by Sheila's continued employment at Il Giardino, and by her sincere apology; Thorne reveals to Brooke a secret about what he's been up to while living in Paris."], "Recap": ["Thorne has coffee with Brooke and says he knows she does not want to discuss why she did not marry Ridge in Australia but he has a feeling it always has to do with another woman and he cannot understand that. And while Ridge is not his dad's biological son, he is talented like Eric so he will give him that. Then he shows Brooke some of his own designs that he has been working on. Charlie brings in lunch but Pam says she already had hers before she went to the cemetery. She asks if he believes in rehabilitation \u0096 the reason \u0096 she just ran into Sheila. He has an unhappy look on his face. But he laughs and says so she is still in town. He hopes Pam did not invite her to see her more often. At the restaurant Sheila sees Eric talking to Carter about some contracts and he will have them signed by the end of the day. Eric looks up and is surprised to see that Sheila is still in town. She says some of her happiest times have been here in L.A. and she just could not leave. And this thing with Mateo she could not help herself. She did wrong but she had to test Quinn to make sure she was worthy of Eric so she is not going to apologize. Ivy is pleased with some jewelry pieces that Quinn and Ridge show her. Ridge places a piece around Quinn's neck and says it makes her eyes sparkle and he could even design a dress to go with it. This could be their finest collection. Somewhere in the conversation he mentions that he does not want Thorne to find out what happened between the two of them.", "Brooke is shocked by Thorne's collection and he says he started right after he left when Aly died. He met another designer and decided to give it a shot, even took some classes and with encouragement he continued. She's so happy for him. He explains the Aly label is his. In a way she inspired him. She gives him a hug and says she is so proud of him. He cannot wait until he hears Ridge's and Eric's opinions. Then he tells her she is a little different. She tries to shrug it off to her new shorter hairdo but he swings it around again to why she did not marry Ridge. Pam tells Charlie that she has looked in the mirror and everyone deserves a second chance, even Sheila. Charlie says Pam is Mother Teresa compared to Sheila and he does not believe she will change. Sheila says she has no reason to believe she can ask Eric this but if he has not burned her portrait she would like it back. He says it is still there in the closet. Brooke states to Thorne that he is starting a new career and she does not want him to be thinking so much about her. She tells him to check in and make himself comfortable. Pam tells Charlie that second chances are what life is all about. Charlie says the only second chance Sheila wants is with Eric. Quinn tells Ridge that Thorne will not hear about them from her; no one is even talking about it anymore so there is nothing to worry about. She is grateful for where they both are now. She has Eric and he will have Brooke someday. At that moment Brooke walks in and sees them through a slightly open door. Ridge is adjusting or touching something around Quinn's neck. Brooke gets the wrong impression."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["[ Birds chirping ]", "Brooke: Since when did you become a tea drinker, thorne?", "Thorne: Something I picked up in europe.", "Brooke: Oh, yeah? Anything else you pick up in europe? Or should I say, anybody else?", "Thorne: [ Chuckles ] Well, i am a forrester. Nothing like my brother, but... sorry.", "Brooke: Don't be silly.", "Thorne: Look, I know you don't want to talk about the reasons you and ridge didn't get married in australia. It's because of something he did. And knowing my brother, it involved another woman. [ Seagulls calling ] It just upsets me that he can't appreciate what an incredible person you are and that he always has to turn to another woman.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: Wow.", "Quinn: Hmm.", "Ridge: I'm inspired.", "Quinn: I inspired you? That's a compliment.", "Ridge: I could design a dress just around that.", "Quinn: Really?", "Ridge: Mm-hmm.", "Quinn: Huh.", "[ Door opens ]", "Ivy: Quinn. Oh, uh, sorry to interrupt.", "Quinn: No, no, you weren't interrupting anything. What's up?", "Ivy: Quinn, I just wanted to say that these pieces you were working on yesterday -- amazing.", "Ridge: They are indeed.", "Ivy: Mm-hmm.", "Quinn: Would you say they are inspiring?", "Ridge: Oh, come on. I meant what I said.", "Quinn: Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: Hey, hon.", "Pam: Yeah?", "Charlie: Brought your lunch.", "Pam: Isn't that what you fixed me for breakfast?", "Charlie: It's the last of the turkey day leftovers. And I want you to have it.", "Pam: Thank you very much, but I actually already had lunch at the restaurant before I went to the cemetery.", "Charlie: Oh, you had lunch?", "Pam: Mm-hmm.", "Charlie: Well, I haven'T.", "Pam: Charlie. Let me ask you something.", "Charlie: Uh-huh.", "Pam: Do you believe in rehabilitation?", "Charlie: What? You mean like a -- like a leopard changing his spots? Oh, yeah. No. I don't know. Why?", "Pam: I ran into sheila at il giardino.", "Charlie: [ Coughs ]", "[ Indistinct conversations ]", "Charlie: Sheila carter, huh? Still in town.", "Pam: Working at the restaurant.", "Charlie: Well, I hope you didn't invite her to sit down.", "Pam: Charlie, she was my waitress. But we did have a chat.", "Charlie: What, uh, what about?", "Pam: It was interesting.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Thank you.", "Carter: I'll get you those contracts by the end of the day.", "Eric: All right. Run them by ridge and steffy first, will you?", "Carter: Will do. See you at work.", "Eric: Maybe, maybe not.", "Carter: Ohhh. Life is good, isn't it?", "Eric: I am married to my beautiful quinn. Better than good.", "Carter: Heh. Later.", "Eric: Okay. Sheila? You're still in town?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: It's beautiful.", "Ivy: [ Gasps ] Quinn, I just -- god, I love this piece.", "Quinn: You do it justice.", "Ivy: Oh, why, thank you. Hey, is it true that thorne is home?", "Ridge: It's true.", "Ivy: Oh. Your dad must be very glad. He loves it when all the forresters are back in town. I mean, you must be happy, too.", "Ridge: Oh, i am happy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Thorne: Ridge is a talented designer. I'll give him that.", "Brooke: He has the gene. He gets it from his father.", "Thorne: Well, he's not my father's biological son, brooke, so I don't know where he gets it from. But he is talented. I'll give him that.", "Brooke: Oh, okay. So out of you kids, then, who gets eric's talents, would it be felicia?", "Thorne: Let me show you something.", "Brooke: Who did these? You?", "Thorne: What do you think?", "Brooke: They're beautiful, thorne.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: You said you were leaving, sheila.", "Sheila: That is true, but there's something about los angeles. The happiest my life has ever been was here...at times.", "Eric: And at other times not.", "Sheila: No. I think of the misery that i caused so many lives, especially yours.", "Eric: So you can understand --", "Sheila: Why you're skeptical of -- of my motives.", "Eric: Yeah, at the very least.", "Sheila: You know, it's really sad to think that my legacy with you carries so much pain with it.", "Eric: Most recently this business with mateo.", "Sheila: I couldn't help myself, eric.", "Eric: You couldn't help yourself?", "Sheila: No, I needed to test your wife. I know it wasn't my place, but in a way, it was, given the feelings that I have for you. What quinn did with your son was terribly wrong, and she somehow has made up for that. But I needed to make sure she was worthy of you. And for that, I will never apologize.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: You did some great work here, lady.", "Quinn: Oh, come on. You're just saying that.", "Ridge: Just take a compliment, would you?", "Quinn: [ Chuckles ]", "Ridge: Try this one on.", "Quinn: Okay.", "Ridge: Let's see it.", "Quinn: Mm-hmm.", "Ridge: All right, so how did this happen?", "Quinn: I don't know. Maybe knowing that sheila was out of the picture helped. For good this time.", "Ridge: It would help me, too, if this is what happens when you're in that kind of space. Wow.", "Quinn: Do you really see a difference?", "Ridge: In your work? Yes, absolutely. And I hope it's something more positive than just sheila not being around anymore.", "Quinn: I mean, life has been really good with eric.", "Ridge: Must have been really good.", "Quinn: Yeah.", "Ridge: This is -- this is -- it's fantastic. It makes your eyes sparkle.", "Quinn: Really? I hadn't noticed that.", "Ridge: It's stunning.", "Quinn: Thank you.", "Ridge: Thank you. I meant what I said. I could design a dress around this piece. You could wear the two of them together, I think.", "Quinn: Or you could design it for someone.", "Ridge: Someone. Yeah, of course, someone. But whoever wears it is gonna sparkle. This is your finest collection ever.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Thorne, how long have you been at this?", "Thorne: Awhile. I started just after aly died.", "Brooke: I'm sorry. To lose a daughter...", "Thorne: Yeah, I was a mess for a while, but I'm okay.", "Brooke: I did call.", "Thorne: I was off the grid. I didn't take anyone's calls or return texts. Until one day I ran into pierre montbaun.", "Brooke: The designer?", "Thorne: Yeah. Of course, I tried to avoid him like I was avoiding everyone else, but he insisted, so we talked.", "Brooke: He lost a son a few years back.", "Thorne: Yeah. He said his work was the only thing that got him through. Some of his best designs came from that period, so I thought, \"what the hell. Give it a shot.\" Better than feeling sorry for myself, right?", "Brooke: [ Sighs ] I just never knew you had this kind of talent.", "Thorne: Well, neither did I. But I had help. I studied. I took classes. It certainly doesn't hurt that europe has some of the best designers. Felicio, langer. They, uh, all took me under their wing, encouraged me. I'll never forget what they did for me.", "Brooke: I am so happy for you. [ Chuckles ] This is quite the surprise.", "Thorne: Well, I have another one. Have you heard of aly's fashion?", "Brooke: Is that that small label that's getting all the buzz in europe right now? Are you saying...", "Thorne: It's my label.", "Brooke: What?!", "Thorne: The aly line is mine. But I want to keep it under wraps. I don't want anyone else to know.", "Brooke: I am speechless right now. Okay, wait, so you're a designer, and you have a new label that's in the marketplace, and it's selling!", "Thorne: It's always been a dream to design. In a way, my daughter inspired me to do this, to take a chance. Anyway, that's why I'm back in L.A. -- To share my dream with you and the rest of the family.", "Brooke: I am so honored to be the first to know. I'm so proud of you, thorne. Really, I -- [ Both laugh ] I'm so proud of you!", "Thorne: Thank you so much.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: I don't know, pammy. In my mind, sheila is incapable of changing.", "Pam: I used to feel that way, until I looked in the mirror. A lot of people thought that i could never change.", "Charlie: Would you stop comparing yourself to sheila carter? You are mother teresa next to her.", "Pam: You've never really talked with her, charlie. I have.", "Charlie: Okay. That is the kind of talk that worries me.", "Pam: Oh, come on! I'm not gonna let her pull the wool over this girl's eyes.", "Charlie: Really? Well, it seems like you already have.", "Pam: Charlie, what could she possibly do to us? She can't cause any more harm to eric and quinn. Everybody's eyes are wide open now. Her only hope is to mend her ways. I've been to the bottom of that barrel, and I know what she's going through. We all deserve a second chance, charlie, even sheila.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Thorne wants to see me.", "Sheila: Oh, he's back in town? You must be excited.", "Eric: He surprised us all.", "Sheila: Well, he does know you're remarried, right?", "Eric: Yes, he does. He's like everybody else in my family. He wants me to be happy.", "Sheila: That's what I want. That's all I've ever wanted.", "Eric: I'm gonna hold you to that, sheila.", "Sheila: Well, you don't have to work too hard to do that. You know, it's hard to believe with my latest blunder, but... you know, I was wondering...", "Eric: What?", "Sheila: I'm embarrassed to even ask you this, eric, but my portrait. Obviously I was getting a bit ahead of myself there.", "Eric: A bit? Yeah.", "Sheila: Okay, a lot. A lot. If you and quinn haven't burned it already, I...", "Eric: It's in the closet.", "Sheila: You didn't get rid of it?", "Eric: No.", "Sheila: [ Sighs ] Can I have it back?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: My finest collection ever?", "Ridge: No question.", "Quinn: Wow. I live for words like that from you.", "Ridge: Well, it's well-deserved.", "Quinn: Yes, of course, if you weren't C.E.O., That would just probably fall on deaf ears.", "Ridge: It's all about the title with you, isn't it?", "Quinn: Oh, no, you could be an intern and I would still -- i would still love to hear that from you. So, thorne. Is he here to stay?", "Ridge: I don't know. I think he might be.", "Quinn: Hmm.", "Ridge: I-I don't, um... I don't want him to know about us.", "Quinn: I understand.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: You are certainly full of wonderful surprises. Just wait until ridge and eric see your work.", "Thorne: I'm looking forward to their opinions. I mean, I would love to work with both of them.", "Brooke: Yeah, I can imagine.", "Thorne: You know, it's always been a dream of mine to be on the team.", "Brooke: Oh, you are a part of the team, thorne.", "Thorne: Yeah, I was a logistics guy. It's different when you're a designer, especially in this family.", "Brooke: Yeah, I guess. So, I'm assuming you're gonna be the one to break the news?", "Thorne: Absolutely.", "Brooke: Okay. You better do it quickly 'cause I won't be able to contain this excitement.", "Thorne: Okay. There's something different about you.", "Brooke: My new hairdo? No? Well, I have been through a lot since I saw you.", "Thorne: And it started with sydney. Come on, brooke. What happened there? You were supposed to marry ridge.", "Brooke: Uh... it was silly, thorne, really.", "Thorne: Silly?", "Brooke: Yeah. It was a silly kiss.", "Thorne: It ended your relationship, then you married spencer. Sounds like there's a lot more to it than \"a silly kiss.\"", "Brooke: [ Sighs ]", "Thorne: I know you don't want to talk about this, but I'm concerned.", "Brooke: And I appreciate that. It was wrong, but it's over. And I don't want you to get on your brother about this. What's done is done. It's in the past, and we're moving forward. It was just one of those things.", "Thorne: Another one of those things. When you're hurting, my brother is usually the cause.", "Brooke: You are starting a new career, and I don't want you to get distracted about this.", "Thorne: You're not a distraction.", "Brooke: Well, I will be if you obsess over this. Come on, thorne. I know you. Just let it go. That's what I'm gonna be doing.", "Thorne: Just a kiss, huh?", "Brooke: Just a kiss.", "Thorne: Well... that kiss must have been with someone pretty upsetting for you to call off the wedding.", "Brooke: I'm gonna go. And you are gonna make yourself comfortable. See you later.", "Thorne: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Door opens ]", "[ Door closes ]", "Pam: Second chances, charlie. That's what life's all about.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Charlie: Mm-hmm. You know, you can talk about giving sheila second chances all you want, but the only second chance she wants is with eric.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Sheila, I need to get going.", "Sheila: Can I -- can I hope for a little forgiveness?", "Eric: Sheila, stop.", "Sheila: I-I know with what i did with mateo was -- was disgraceful.", "Eric: What you did with mateo, convincing him to seduce my wife? Outrageous.", "Sheila: Yeah, I-i disappointed you again, and that was not my intention.", "Eric: Well, whatever your intention was, it doesn't excuse your behavior.", "Sheila: Eric, I wanted to make sure you were with a good woman.", "Eric: Is any woman other than you ever gonna be the right woman for me?", "Sheila: Well, if it's any consolation, she passed the test. So she must be good for you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I don't think you have to worry. Thorne isn't gonna hear about what happened between us from me. And I doubt your father's gonna tell him, either.", "Ridge: I just want it to be behind us, you know?", "Quinn: Well, it is behind us. Eric forgave you. It's over.", "Ridge: Yeah. Thorne has a way of just...", "Quinn: Oh, come on. I don't think you should be worrying about this. Nobody's even talking about it anymore.", "Ridge: That's what I'm hoping. I want a future with brooke. I really do.", "Quinn: I know you do. I want that for you, too. I have to say, I'm really glad we kept this friendship.", "Ridge: Hmm. The way we started out, it's surprising we have anything at all.", "Quinn: I hated you.", "Ridge: I hated you more.", "Quinn: Ohh. But I'm so grateful that -- that we're here now.", "Ridge: So am I. I don't have a friend like you.", "Quinn: See, I don't have any friends like you, either. I don't really have any friends at all, so...", "Ridge: Hmm.", "Quinn: I don't want to give this up.", "Ridge: Me neither.", "Quinn: The good news is, we don't have to.", "Ridge: Because you have dad.", "Quinn: Yeah. And you have brooke. Or you will someday. And nothing's ever gonna happen between us again.", "Ridge: It's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBpYsjRb5TM"}
