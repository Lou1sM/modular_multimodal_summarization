        "Brooke: Is there something I can do for you, Stephanie?",
        "Stephanie: Leave my building?",
        "Brooke: Sorry, no.",
        "Stephanie: So, you like working down here in the basement?",
        "Brooke: Well, I'd like it more if I didn't have to see you.",
        "Stephanie: I should think it would feel just like home for you -- surrounded with your old husbands and lovers, just a stone's throw away from the gutter.",
        "Brooke: What's the matter? You ran out of people to push around upstairs? You need somebody to show you how to be a real C.E.O?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, what's going on with you? Have you had a meeting with a lawyer I should know about?",
        "Brooke: If you must know, it has nothing to do with me. It's about Bridget.",
        "[ Stephanie laughs ]",
        "Stephanie: When has it ever been about Bridget for you? What have you done to her now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: The role of \"Felicia Forrester\" is now being played by Leslie Kay.",
        "Taylor: Felicia? I am so excited to see you! I'm so glad you're here. Everybody's going to be so happy.",
        "Felicia: Yeah, well, I don't know how long I'm staying. I haven't even checked into a hotel yet.",
        "Taylor: Oh, no, a hotel? Are you kidding? No, you're staying here.",
        "Felicia: No, I'm not going to intrude. You obviously weren't even expecting me.",
        "Taylor: Well, no. When you didn't respond to the job offer --",
        "Felicia: Hey, if it's no longer on the table, I can go right back to France.",
        "Taylor: No, I just -- I didn't think you were interested. When I didn't hear back from you, I --",
        "Felicia: Not interested? Mom takes over Forrester Creations, makes brother Thorne president, sends dad and Ridge to the basement? You bet I'm interested. Tell me every gory detail.",
        "Taylor: I'll tell you about that in just minute. But what I want to know right now is, how is Felicia Forrester -- the world traveler, the party girl on the party circuit? We were so worried about you. I mean, you were -- I couldn't find you for months, and then I had to practically send out a search team to find you. We really were worried about you.",
        "Felicia: There's so much going on. Who has time to worry about me?",
        "Taylor: Well, Ridge told me you had left town, and your cancer was in remission, but I thought maybe that had changed. You've been kind of secretive with us in the past, and so I just thought, are you hiding something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hi.",
        "Bridget: Hey.",
        "Nick: Is he gone?",
        "Bridget: Yeah.",
        "Nick: How did it go?",
        "Bridget: Oh, it was okay. But he was -- he was hurt.",
        "Nick: Bridget, it's okay that you want to be with the father of your child.",
        "Bridget: I know, of course, but -- he was a really good friend to me.",
        "Nick: Well, if he's a really good friend, he won't be disappointed that that's all he's ever going to be.",
        "Bridget: Well, of course he'll be disappointed. I don't blame him. For a while there, it really did look like --",
        "[ Nick whispering ]",
        "Nick: Hey -- I'm here now. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: Taylor, I'm fine. My cancer has been in remission for quite a while.",
        "Taylor: I just hope you can understand why we'd all be concerned. It was like you fell off the map.",
        "Felicia: Well, I did, in a way. I've holed up in the French countryside. No phone at the farmhouse. No t.v. It's like going back in time.",
        "Taylor: Sounds peaceful.",
        "Felicia: Sometimes.",
        "Taylor: So, have you been designing? I know it's been a while since you were at Spectra.",
        "Felicia: I got out while the getting was good.",
        "Taylor: You know how much Sally overextended herself.",
        "Felicia: I just needed to slow down, get off the treadmill, put my energy somewhere else.",
        "Taylor: So, have you given up on designing then?",
        "Felicia: No. No, I've done some sketches. But mostly, I've just been reading, taking long walks, naps.",
        "Taylor: Napping? You?",
        "Felicia: My life has completely changed, Taylor. My priorities are so different than they were when I left L.A.",
        "Taylor: Oh, well I can see that you've definitely changed.",
        "Felicia: I really wanted to come visit when you returned.",
        "Taylor: I know, and I told you not to worry about that. It was just nice talking to you on the phone that day when I first came home. But you know, even then, I could tell that something about you was very different. You seemed a little more laid back and centered.",
        "Felicia: Facing your own mortality can do that to you. Well, I don't have to tell you.",
        "Taylor: I'm glad you're taking care of yourself. It's just that when I couldn't get in touch with you, I did start to immediately wonder if it wasn't the cancer. But then, I also wondered if maybe it wasn't that you were a little more devastated by the breakup with Nick than you let on with me.",
        "Felicia: Please don't tell me I came all this way to be grilled about Nick. What, not only are you working for mom, you've turned into her, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: You know you can't keep any secrets from me. I'll talk to Bridget, and she'll tell me everything.",
        "Brooke: You leave her alone.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you don't want me to hear her side of the story.",
        "Brooke: She's having a girl.",
        "Stephanie: A baby girl?",
        "Brooke: I'm sure she wants to tell the rest of the family, so don't go blabbing.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my gosh, a grandchild. A baby girl. No wonder you're in such a good mood. Pretty soon, she'll be here in high school, bringing all the hotties home -- why, you must just be dying with anticipation.",
        "Brooke: Only you could take good news and turn it into an insult.",
        "Stephanie: I'm telling you right now, I won't let you do anything to this new baby girl like you've done to her mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You know, to be honest with you, I feel sorry for the guy.",
        "Bridget: You do?",
        "Nick: Yeah. Look what he doesn't get. He doesn't get to look at that beautiful face everyday. Torture! I mean, torture.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, well, not everyone can be as lucky as you are.",
        "Nick: Amen! I thank my lucky stars every day, because I get to watch you walk through the door, I get to kiss you in the morning, and you get to make my breakfast and get my beer for me, and light my cigar, and be a good little wife. Kidding. Kidding.",
        "Bridget: You'd better be.",
        "Nick: Hey, I might not be able to, you know, speak Italian, or paint pretty pictures, or cook Italian. But I will take care of my two best girls. You'll have nothing to worry about in the world.",
        "Bridget: Whoa, wait, did you just say you don't cook?",
        "Nick: Takeout.",
        "Bridget: Cleaning?",
        "Nick: Swabbed the marlin.",
        "Bridget: Changing diapers?",
        "Nick: Diapers?",
        "Bridget: Diapers.",
        "Nick: We have a few months to work on that. You know what, we have a few months to work on a lot of things. Like our marriage, getting back in sync -- and I don't mean the kitchen sink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I'm that child's grandmother, Stephanie, and I'm going to spend time with her, whether you like it or not.",
        "Stephanie: Well, Bridget's not going to like you hanging around her husband.",
        "Brooke: Bridget's put that behind her.",
        "Stephanie: If she knows what's good herself, she'll put you behind her, too.",
        "Brooke: Well, we have some work to do.",
        "Stephanie: Work to do? You're poison to that girl.",
        "Brooke: We've overcome our problems before.",
        "Stephanie: You don't honestly think she's going to forgive you?",
        "Brooke: Why not? She forgave Nick. Bridget and Nick are back together.",
        "Stephanie: You're still trying to convince yourself that this is all going to work out and just be \"happily ever after,\" aren't you? You and Nick and Bridget and a new baby girl -- one big happy family? It's not possible, honey. It's just not possible. There's been too many mistakes made.",
        "Brooke: You're wrong. Nick and Bridget are back on solid ground. They're expecting a child, they're planning their future. And I'm not going to let you or anybody else interfere with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: You don't want to talk about Nick.",
        "Felicia: I thought you called me here to talk about a job?",
        "Taylor: I did.",
        "Felicia: So, are you Forrester's new head of human resources?",
        "Taylor: No, your mother asked me to talk to you about the job offer --",
        "Felicia: Because she knows if she did, I probably wouldn't take it.",
        "Taylor: No, because she wanted me to --",
        "Felicia: Soften me up, head-shrink me a little?",
        "Taylor: No. No, no. She just thought that I would be the best one to explain this whole thing to you objectively.",
        "Felicia: But you're not objective, Taylor, you're on her side.",
        "Taylor: No, I -- look, I want what's best for Forrester Creations. And right now, we are in serious need of an experienced head designer.",
        "Felicia: In other words, you're desperate. You'd have to be to hire me.",
        "Taylor: Are you kidding? We would be lucky to have you. You're one of the most talented designers in the world.",
        "Felicia: And the most avant-garde. Taylor, you called my agent. You said that mom was determined to take Forrester back to its classical roots.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, we are.",
        "Felicia: Which makes me think you've called me here for something else. You, mom and Thorne against dad, Ridge and Brooke? Maybe just one more player would turn the tables in your favor?",
        "Taylor: No. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, see -- no -- okay, well, maybe it would easily --",
        "Felicia: Ah, you still can't lie, can you? Trust me, it's not that hard. I've got it down to a science.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: So this is what you meant when you said you wanted to get back in sync?",
        "Nick: Well, you know, until we have a place of our own, I just wanted to get to know the whole house.",
        "Bridget: Oh, starting with the bedroom, of course, huh?",
        "Nick: I plan on spending a lot of time in here when I move in.",
        "Bridget: Is that so?",
        "Nick: Yeah. It's been a long time -- [ Bridget laughs ] Since I've had a good night's sleep.",
        "Bridget: Oh, right, mm-hmm.",
        "Nick: Oh, comfy! Ah, this feel's good. Come on.",
        "Bridget: Are you sure you're ready to become a land lover?",
        "Nick: The ocean's right outside.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, but you can't sail away in it without a boat.",
        "Nick: The ocean has been my lady for long enough. I'm ready for a change.",
        "Bridget: No regrets?",
        "Nick: Regrets? Look at the deal I'm getting. I'm trading her in for two very special ones.",
        "Bridget: She's going to be so gorgeous.",
        "Nick: She is, isn't she?",
        "Bridget: She's going to look just like her daddy.",
        "Nick: Oh, please. [ Nick shudders ] Let's just hope and pray that she looks just like you.",
        "Bridget: Oh, honey -- the baby.",
        "Nick: The baby's gonna be gorgeous. Gorgeous baby.",
        "Bridget: No, I know, I know, but -- sweetheart, remember, the doctor said that we shouldn't, you know --",
        "Nick: Right.",
        "Bridget: Just for a few days. You understand.",
        "Nick: Oh, yeah.",
        "Bridget: Are you sure you're all right?",
        "Nick: Oh, yeah, fine. Whoo.",
        "Bridget: Well, all right. I am sure that, if we put our two little heads together, we can figure out something else to do.",
        "Nick: Okay. [ Bridget whispering ] Oww.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: So, you're to be the guardian of their relationship? Why, that's like the fox guarding the henhouse.",
        "Brooke: My involvement with Nick is over. It has been for a while.",
        "Stephanie: My dear, you should never speak of any man that you have slept with in the past tense.",
        "Brooke: Just because your husband never got over me, doesn't mean that nick hasn't. She and Nick are happy. They are moving on, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: I wish I could believe that.",
        "Brooke: Just pretend you didn't hear it coming from me, okay?",
        "Stephanie: You know, there's a little too much pretending going on here. She's pretending that she trusts him again, he pretends that he's over you, and you're pretending you're happy about this whole thing.",
        "Brooke: I am.",
        "Stephanie: Just because they're together doesn't absolve you. And it doesn't guarantee the marriage is going to last.",
        "Brooke: There are no guarantees in any marriage, Stephanie. And every relationship has obstacles and challenges. And Nick and Bridget are going to have theirs.",
        "Stephanie: Uh-huh, well, more than their fair share, if you're around.",
        "Brooke: I will be there to support them -- not that I think that they need it, because they've been through a lot to get here. But, Nick and Bridget have finally found their way back to each other, and nothing is going to derail them now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Okay, fair game. But, have you been lying to me, Felicia?",
        "Felicia: Maybe I've been lying to myself.",
        "Taylor: About what?",
        "Felicia: Coming back here. Hoping things would be different.",
        "Taylor: Between you and your mother?",
        "Felicia: And the rest of our messed up family.",
        "Taylor: Well, I won't lie to you about that. Things are not ideal at Forrester Creations. There is a lot of tension.",
        "Felicia: Your barking up the wrong tree, if you think I can defuse it.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, but, if you could just help us get some designs on the drawing board, I really think it would be great. And, you know what they say about idle hands.",
        "Felicia: Mom's driving everybody crazy?",
        "Taylor: Well, I think, if we could just get things moving forward, it would help. And I really think you're the person to do it. Besides, I really think that you would be so good for your mother. She's all alone right now in the big house, and at the office --",
        "Felicia: So get her a dog. I'm the last person on earth who she'd want playing nursemaid.",
        "Taylor: You know, did it ever occur to you that maybe the reason the two of you don't get along is because you two are so much alike?",
        "Felicia: I thought you were trying to convince me to take the job, not scare me off?",
        "Taylor: Felicia, I think that you would be perfect for this job. It's a great opportunity for you. And you've always said that you wanted to work with Forrester more. And, if you're worried about your father, I know he would completely understand.",
        "Felicia: Dad's never been able to hold a grudge.",
        "Taylor: Then what is it? Is it being back in L.A.? You don't like the smog, don't like the traffic? Maybe running into Nick?",
        "Felicia: I told you, I don't want to talk about Nick.",
        "Taylor: That is still painful for you, isn't it?",
        "Felicia: No, you know what? It's pointless. I'm not hung up on Nick. I don't want anything from him.",
        "Taylor: I didn't say you did.",
        "Felicia: Just drop it, okay, please? Besides, believe me, I have a lot more important things to worry about than Nick Marone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I missed you.",
        "Bridget: I missed you, too. Especially that crazy sense of humor.",
        "Nick: Well, I want to put more than just a smile on your face. You know that, don't you?",
        "Bridget: It's pretty important, though, you know?",
        "Nick: It doesn't compare to what you've done for me. You're the rudder that steers my ship when I needed steering.",
        "Bridget: Got a little off course there, huh?",
        "Nick: I shouldn't have expected you to be here when I turned it around, but you were.",
        "Bridget: You did a pretty good job of convincing me you needed a second chance.",
        "Nick: I never believed in second chances. When you're manning a tanker in heavy seas, you can't afford them. Everybody has a job -- you do it right, or people get hurt. You don't get points for it and you don't get anything that you haven't earned.",
        "Bridget: You don't think you've earned my forgiveness, do you?",
        "Nick: Not yet, no.",
        "Bridget: You go it.",
        "Nick: Part of me feels like I don't deserve it, like I've only been half there.",
        "Bridget: Well, you're all here now.",
        "Nick: And I'm going to be -- for you and the baby, as long as you'll have me. And I'm not doing it because of duty, or because it's the right thing to do. But I'm doing it because, when I look in your eyes, I want to be that guy. I want to be that guy that you see now.",
        "Bridget: You are that guy.",
        "Nick: But I haven't been that for a while. But I'm gonna be. Tonight -- for the rest of our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: On the next \"Bold and the Beautiful\" --",
        "Eric: You and Ridge and I are going to put together a line that is going to knock her dreams right off the runway. Stephanie can take away the company, she cannot take away what really counts.",
        "Thorne: We have to find a way to stop all the bickering. No more surprises.",
        "Felicia: Hey, sailor. I haven't forgotten about you, Nick.",
        "Nick: Felicia, I married Bridget."
