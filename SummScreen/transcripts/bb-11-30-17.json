She says she really regrets what she did, walking out on him but she is so happy now. Yet a half second later she is thinking of her romp in the sack with her father-in-law, Bill. Bill too remembers her telling him that she has to tell Liam and he says no; he must never know. Sally thinks back on what she told Liam while they were trapped in the rubble. She tells Coco that she is going to see Liam but she wants to be sure she does not run into Steffy. She doesn't want anything bad to happen but she does need to speak to Liam. Liam tells Steffy that today he is working from home. Liam mentions Christmas and says he is actually looking forward this year to it, He knows she will want to be with her family and he wants to spend more time with his dad.", "Sally goes to see Liam. She says he and Steffy looked very happy at Thanksgiving. He says yes she is very happy and is very understanding. Sally says she knows. She expected Steffy to stick the turkey in her face but she didn't. Liam says yes Steffy was obviously mad but it is like overnight she found this acceptance and they even renewed their wedding vows. It's like she left one woman but came back another. Steffy goes to see Bill and says she is not being honest with her husband and this will haunt her the rest of her life. Bill says they must take that risk. Steffy wonders why they did not stop themselves before it went too far. Bill reminds her that Liam told her that he shared a connection between him and Sally. She says it was still a mistake and no reason to do what they did. She knows that she owes Liam the same honesty and integrity that he gives her. Bill says she will lose him then if that is what she wants. Sally tells Liam that she has to be honest with him and she is happy he is back with Steffy but she cannot forget when they were together in the rubble. Bill reminds Steffy again that if she tells Liam he will feel betrayed. They made love and they both felt that way about it. He cannot pretend that he does not feel they were made for each other. He cannot deny what he knows. They were meant to be."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Liam: Do you know how lucky i am, starting each morning like this with my beautiful, amazing wife in my arms? You know, if it weren't for you...", "Steffy: Please don't do that.", "Liam: I... what?", "Steffy: Just, uh, put me on a pedestal and make me sound like I'm perfect.", "Liam: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say you were perfect? You hog all the sheets, you put dirty dishes in the sink. It's disgusting. And frank-- wait. Nope. Nope. That'd be me. Hmm. Still, when it counts...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: When it counts, couples don't compound their mistakes and make even bigger ones. I never should have walked out on you. No, I-I shouldn't have. I really regret it. But we renewed our vows, and we're starting over. I'm so happy I'm mrs. Liam spencer.", "Steffy: This is killing me. This never should have happened. There's nothing we can do to erase that night. Nothing! I betrayed my husband. I betrayed my vows, my marriage.", "Bill: And I'm trying to make it right. I'm trying to make amends with liam, unite the family.", "Steffy: Okay, then, maybe --", "Bill: But I'm telling you, steffy, his wheels are turning.", "Steffy: Maybe I should just tell liam. I can just confess everything.", "Bill: No! You can--", "Steffy: I can't keep this from him!", "Bill: You can't do that. We made a pact, and we're gonna keep it. Liam cannot know. So we have to keep this secret between us. No one will ever know.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: [ Sighs ] Is this too much?", "Coco: Hmm. Depends. Are we going back to the carnival circuit?", "Sally: Fine.", "Coco: [ Chuckles ] Where are you going?", "Sally: How about these?", "Coco: It's better. What? You're not gonna say where you're headed?", "Sally: I mean, it's really no biggie. I'm just gonna drop in on liam and see for myself how he's doing.", "Sally: Words can't express how much I appreciate you and what you have come to mean to me. I love you, liam. In an innocent way. In a beautiful way. With all of my heart. For who you are and for what you have done. And I will never meet anybody like you ever again.", "Coco: Does liam know you're coming?", "Sally: No. But I will make sure that I do not run into steffy.", "Coco: Yeah, well, that can complicate a lot of things if you did.", "Sally: [ Scoffs ] I know. And I don't want to do anything to upset things for them, okay? I know that steffy's forgiven him and they're moving on from what happened.", "Coco: What about you, sis? Have you?", "Sally: I don't want to create more problems for liam. I just... I just need to speak to him.", "Coco: You really can't get that guy out of your mind, can you? You fell really hard for the guy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Just imagine it. Our own private island, sailing, no demands, no schedules.", "Liam: So cell service?", "Steffy: I mean, we would be cut off from the rest of the world. I know it's kind of short notice, but I think we should do it.", "Liam: You don't have to convince me. I'm on board. Although... I mean, with christmas right around the corner, I know you like to be with your family. And I'm actually -- I'm looking forward to spending some time with my dad after everything that's happened. I know that's something you'd like, right?", "Steffy: Yeah, we can, uh, talk about it later. Don't you have to go to the office?", "Liam: Uh, well, today I'm working from home. I'd love it if you did, too.", "Steffy: No, I-I actually have a meeting.", "Liam: Hey. Steffy, you -- you okay?", "Steffy: Yeah. No, I'm -- I'm fine. I'm fine.", "Liam: Well, your hands are shaking.", "Steffy: No, it's -- it's just the chills. It's nothing, really.", "Liam: Are you sure about that? 'Cause if it's something else...", "Steffy: Uh-huh.", "Liam: Okay, come here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Train horn honks ]", "Darlita: Where did sally go?", "Coco: She went to liam'S.", "Darlita: Why?", "Coco: They're friends.", "Darlita: And possibly more?", "Coco: Excuse me?", "Darlita: I have eyes, coco. I mean, I know everyone thinks I'm this dim dora.", "Coco: No one thinks that.", "Darlita: But I'm pretty sharp when it comes to certain things, like when a girl likes a guy, only she pretends she doesn't because she knows if she admitted it, let alone acted on it, she would cause all kinds of trouble. But then she gets trapped in an explosion with that guy, and something happens, something that sally could have never predicted. How am I doing so far?", "Coco: You put all this together yourself?", "Darlita: I'm very intuitive. All of the women in my family are. We also read a lot of romance novels. Anyway, I'm guessing this all came to a head in that explosion. Maybe sally bared her soul thinking she had nothing to lose, and liam... liam I haven't figured out quite yet. But being the good guy that he is, I can't see him crossing the line with her -- oh, my god. Are you saying he and sally did cross a line?", "Coco: [ Sighs ] Okay, they -- they thought they were gonna die, so, yes, they -- they shared a few kisses.", "Darlita: Really?!", "Coco: But you have to promise not to tell anyone. You have to promise me, darlita.", "Darlita: Of course. This is just all so romantic. And scary all at the same time.", "Coco: Yeah, for sally, mostly.", "Darlita: What do you mean?", "Coco: The explosion's behind her, but her feelings for liam... my sister just has a lot to work through.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: So, to what do I owe the, uh, random drop-in?", "Sally: Uh, I hope you don't mind me coming by.", "Liam: No, no, not at all. I-I just -- how did you know I'd be here and not at the office?", "Sally: Um, I called spencer. They said that you were working from home today.", "Liam: Ah. Right.", "Sally: Your house is incredible. Look at this view. You and, uh, steffy looked really happy on thanksgiving.", "Liam: Yeah. Uh, yeah. Yeah, we are. It's actually, um, kind of surreal how understanding she was.", "Sally: She really loves you.", "Liam: And I betrayed that love. She forgave me, thankfully.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I can't do it, bill. I can't keep this secret any longer.", "Bill: Yes, you can. You're a strong woman. We made a pact, steffy.", "Steffy: I know! But it's wrong! I'm not being honest with my husband.", "Bill: Normally I would agree, but considering the circumstances --", "Steffy: I overreacted that night. At least liam told me what happened with sally. He was honest with me.", "Bill: About a few kisses. Our situation is totally different.", "Steffy: Yes, and there's no coming back from that. I have to lie to liam over and over and over.", "Bill: All right, look, look, I know that it's hard. But just give it some time and you will see --", "Steffy: What? It's just gonna go away? This is gonna haunt me for the rest of my life.", "Bill: It'll haunt you even more knowing coming clean cost you your marriage, the man you want to spend the rest of your life with. Are you willing to take that risk?", "Steffy: [ Voice breaking ] Bill, what am I supposed to do? [ Sniffles ] I'm just gonna pretend that everything's wonderful between me and my husband.", "Bill: It can be wonderful if you just let this go.", "Steffy: My mind won't let me.", "Bill: You have to try harder. We both do, for everyone's sake.", "Steffy: So I'm just gonna continue to lie to my husband.", "Bill: To protect your marriage, our family. I don't want to lose my son, either, steffy.", "Steffy: I know. But why didn't we think about that before we did what we did? Why didn't we stop ourselves?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Darlita: I knew I was right. Sal's had the hots for liam all along. And she's with him right now?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: Yes. But not to cause trouble for liam. She just wants to get some answers.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: You know, I, uh, got to give the princess props. I expected a completely different reaction from her on thanksgiving. Clearly she didn't know I was coming 'cause she never would have allowed it. But she rose above. You know, it was classy, considering...", "Liam: You really expected her to give it to you, huh?", "Sally: I expected her to shove my face in pam's sweet potato casserole is what i expected, but she didn'T. But I'm not letting my guard down just yet, 'cause I expect to have a reaming coming after what I did.", "Liam: After what we did. I'm just as responsible as you are.", "Sally: No, it was more me, and steffy knows that, which is exactly why she came back so quickly. Anyway, I know why she hates me.", "Liam: Uh, actually, that's -- that's the thing. I mean, she was obviously mad at first, but it's like overnight she found this -- this peace and acceptance and -- and it allowed us to renew our marriage vows, and now --", "Sally: Now you're off on this new, incredible chapter of your lives.", "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, we are. It's just the way that steffy handled the whole thing. It's like she left one woman and came home another.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: You didn't set out to betray liam, and neither did I. Hell, I thought you were done with him, that you were leaving him. God knows you had good reason. The man you trusted, your husband, just confessed to you that he shared a connection with, kisses with a woman that you loathe, that's been your enemy from day one. Now, sure, the circumstances were extraordinary, but they also revealed a connection between liam and sally that i don't think he was ready to fully admit to until that moment.", "Steffy: Look, nothing excuses what happened between us. It was a mistake, bill. It was a horrible lapse in judgment.", "Bill: That will be compounded if you tell liam everything. You do realize that.", "Steffy: What I realize is that I need to give liam the same kind of integrity and honesty that he gives me. Our marriage deserves that.", "Bill: You won't have a marriage if you tell him. He will leave you. You will lose liam forever. Is that what you want?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Darlita: No wonder you want me to keep this hush-hush. If steffy ever found out --", "Coco: Oh, no, she already knows. Liam told her everything.", "Darlita: Seriously?", "Coco: And she's forgiven liam, even renewed their wedding vows.", "Darlita: Wow. That's love.", "Coco: Yeah. Pretty exceptional woman, huh?", "Darlita: I'll say. Wait. If liam and steffy are back together and happy, where does that leave sally?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Couples fight. They make up. I'm just glad what happened didn't cause any permanent damage.", "Liam: Yeah. Me, too. Me, too. Uh, although it wasn't even a fight, so much as when she left, I was scared it was for good.", "Sally: She would not do that. No woman would. I certainly wouldn'T. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. The last thing I want to do is to make you feel uncomfortable. I just have to be honest with you, liam. I can't stop thinking about what happened between us. And I know I shouldn'T. I shouldn'T. You're back with steffy, and that's right where you belong. Meanwhile, I have spectra to focus on, you know, get it back up and running again with your father's help. Surprise, surprise.", "Liam: [ Chuckles ]", "Sally: So I guess that makes me lucky. Not as lucky as steffy, but... anyway, I'm happy that you're happy, that you have a loving woman like the princess who is true and faithful to you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: If you tell liam what happened between us, it may ease your conscience, but the damage it will do to your marriage, not to mention my relationship with my son? We are finally starting to heal. If you open this up... you're my son's wife, steffy. If you tell him we were together, that's all he's going to hear. It's not gonna matter that we thought your relationship was over. He will feel betrayed.", "Steffy: He was betrayed.", "Bill: And I hate myself for it. But it wasn't intentional from either of us. And what happened between us, it wasn't tawdry. It wasn't dirty. And it wasn't an accident. We made love, and we both felt that way about it.", "Steffy: Bill, stop. Please stop. Please.", "Bill: I can't stop. I wish I could. I really do. But I can'T. I can't lock those feelings away again. I told you that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. I said it years ago, and I said it again after we made love. I can't pretend like I don't feel that we were made for each other. We understand each other. We're connected. We always have been, and we always will be. I can't deny what I know. We were meant to be. You and I, we're meant to be."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7mpy_zzSh0"}
