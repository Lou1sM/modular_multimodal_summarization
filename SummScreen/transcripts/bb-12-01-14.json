{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["While Pam, Ivy, & Aly start to discuss Hope's baby shower, Eric interrupts and says Rick has made some questionable things of late but sending Hope and Ivy to Amsterdam to model was a brilliant idea. Later he tells Hope that he appreciated the way she handled Amsterdam with Liam and Ivy. Hope admits it was pretty difficult. She loves her family and she loves her marriage but seeing Liam there was not easy. It wasn't that long ago that she and Liam were making wedding plans. She was manipulated by Quinn but she is trying hard to get past that. He tells her she will as she is a strong girl. He thanks her for being honest with him. Deacon tells Quinn that she ruined his surprise for breakfast in bed. She admits this is kind of good. With Wyatt, she never thought she would be sharing her house with another man. She grouses about not being invited to the Forrester Thanksgiving dinner and being asked to leave. They are treating the grandma worse than a stranger. Deacon warns her again just cool it and play it low key for now. She can not push Hope. She wonders how much time is she to give Hope or how many holidays she will have to miss.", "Wyatt drops in on Liam to see if all is okay. He hopes they managed to all get along at Thanksgiving. And it's girls only at the baby shower so he and Liam are all alone now. Liam admits it was a good trip to Amsterdam and he had a good time with Ivy after Hope and Wyatt left. Wyatt is not subtle. He says Liam and Ivy are good together. Everybody sees it so if he would relax and let go, they could have a great life together just like he and Hope have. Quinn overhears Deacon talking to Pam on the phone about Hope's baby shower. He knows he is not invited but Pam didn't want him just dropping by unannounced. Quinn's ears perk up. Deacon tells her do not dare; stay away from the shower as she is not invited. Before the baby shower, Hope stops by to see Liam. She admits she looked off her balcony and saw him and Ivy. He admits he got caught up in the moment and probably was insensitive since it was right outside her hotel. She tells him it was Wyatt that arranged that just trying to do something nice. He says Ivy told him she loved him. Hope asks what did he say? His face says it all, and she understands. She says Ivy is a wonderful girl and it was just a matter of time for them to get close and she wants him to be happy."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Ivy: I thought it was a lovely way to celebrate the holiday.", "Hope: Thank you, Ivy.", "Pam: You know, we should have a game like that at your shower.", "Aly: Yeah. Best wishes for the baby. Everyone goes around and says something hopeful and positive.", "Hope: Aww. I love that. Yeah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Hold on, ladies. Before you go on, I'd like to say something to you about these.", "Ivy: We just -- before you start, can you just remember that that was my first time modeling?", "Eric: Well, you did an exceptional job. Hope, you were both really beautiful. Rick's made some questionable decisions lately, but sending the two of you to Amsterdam was a very good idea.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Hey.", "Liam: Hi.", "Wyatt: You, uh, in the middle of something?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: Let's see here. Let's see. Oh! Hey! [Chuckles] You ruined the surprise.", "Quinn: Breakfast?", "Deacon: No, breakfast in bed.", "Quinn: Oh. Deacon, if you wanted to surprise me in bed --", "Deacon: I just thought you'd be kind of hungry after last night.", "Quinn: I am.", "Deacon: [Chuckles]", "Quinn: This is nice.", "Deacon: Nice?", "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Yes, it is. It's been just me and Wyatt for so long. Never thought I'd be sharing my life with somebody else.", "Deacon: We're gonna be a family now.", "Quinn: Not if your daughter has anything to say about it.", "Quinn: You said Hope would come around.", "Deacon: Eventually.", "Quinn: She wouldn't let me see my son on thanksgiving.", "Deacon: You tried to crash their dinner.", "Quinn: I should have been invited!", "Deacon: Maybe if you would stop trying to force the issue, you will be next year.", "Quinn: I brought yams.", "Deacon: You got to give her some space.", "Quinn: I wasn't going to stay. I was just gonna drop them off. What? You know what? You weren't there last year. You didn't see how everybody got along so well, and I thought maybe -- maybe with the baby coming, but no. I am that child's grandmother, and your daughter treated me worse than a stranger.", "Deacon: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: I think my modeling days are over for a little while.", "Aly: Are you kidding? You are more beautiful than ever.", "Eric: I agree.", "Hope: Thank you. But we want the focus to be on Ivy's jewelry and not my little bump.", "Aly: You'll be getting all the attention at your baby shower.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: And thank you for letting us use your house again, Eric.", "Eric: It'll be like old times. There were weeks when Stephanie and I entertained almost every night.", "Pam: Well, don't get any ideas, mister. This soiree's for ladies only. No menfolk allowed.", "Eric: Understood.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Alison told me you were working from home.", "Liam: You need something?", "Wyatt: Just touching base. Kind of felt like things were warming up at thanksgiving. Everybody getting along, giving thanks. One big, happy family. And who knows? Once this baby comes, maybe we can make that a regular thing. Would, uh, you and Ivy be up for that?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: You're a smart girl. You knew what would happen.", "Quinn: Oh, that's what I get for giving your daughter the benefit of the doubt.", "Deacon: You can't push her.", "Quinn: She could have told Wyatt that I was there.", "Deacon: And what? Put him in the middle again?", "Quinn: No! He wasn't even there! She wasn't with him! She was with Liam in the living room admiring his new sword necklace, no doubt.", "Deacon: What -- what necklace?", "Quinn: Oh, well, Ivy -- ha! -- She made him a new necklace to replace the old one.", "Deacon: Okay, you know what? Now you're just being --", "Quinn: What? You say I am supposed to give Hope space, give her time. How much time am I supposed to give her? How many holidays am I supposed to miss with my son, with my grandchild? What are you doing? Don't -- don't do that.", "Deacon: [Chuckles] What?", "Quinn: I'm angry.", "Deacon: Yeah, but you're not angry with me.", "Quinn: Well, no, not yet.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Thanks for staying, Hope. I won't keep you long. I know you have a party to plan.", "Hope: Hey, my only job is to open presents.", "Eric: You don't want to be late for that.", "Hope: No. [Chuckles] Uh, what is it that you wanted to talk about?", "Eric: I want to compliment you on, uh, the way you handled yourself in Amsterdam, this shoot with Ivy. I know there was some tension between the two of you before you went, but you didn't let it, uh, get in the way of doing your work. I appreciate that. Unlike your brother.", "Hope: I don't know if you can really compare our situations.", "Eric: No? Rick did let his personal issues cloud his judgment.", "Hope: You know, Eric... I-I actually -- I don't know if I handled myself as well as I could have in Amsterdam. Seeing Liam and Ivy together was...really pretty difficult.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Hey!", "Pam: Hey!", "Ivy: What are we doing?", "Aly: A diaper cake.", "Pam: It's kind of a tradition. You can't really have a proper baby shower in America without a diaper cake.", "Ivy: Okay. I thought you were making lemon bars. [Chuckles]", "Pam: It's a decoration.", "Ivy: Oh.", "Aly: [Laughs]", "Pam: Okay, girls, be serious. If you can't be serious, I can do this by myself.", "Ivy: Ohh.", "Pam: I can see why Rick didn't send the two of you to Amsterdam together. That would have been a big mistake.", "Ivy: Pam, I'm -- I'm sorry.", "Pam: Okay.", "Aly: I still wish I'd been there. The photo shoot must have been so exciting.", "Ivy: Are you kidding me? I've never been so nervous in my entire life. Although, you know, Liam was there, so he helped me focus and relax.", "Pam: So it's a good thing you brought him along.", "Aly: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Tell me you did not come over here to find out how things are going between Ivy and me.", "Wyatt: She said some pretty great things about you at thanksgiving.", "Liam: Aren't you supposed to be at a baby shower?", "Wyatt: Girls only. Which means you and I are on our own, brother.", "Liam: Dude, I -- [Sighs] I got -- I got work to do.", "Wyatt: Did you get the proofs?", "Liam: I did, actually.", "Wyatt: Yeah?", "Liam: It's good. It's really good. I, uh, I'm gonna give you a two-page spread.", "Wyatt: I'm sorry. A two-page spread?", "Liam: Yeah.", "Wyatt: Come on! That shoot deserves a cover. Ivy and Hope were fantastic out there.", "Liam: Yeah, they were.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Liam: They really were. This, uh, this campaign's gonna be a huge success. And in fact, I'll say it. It was a good trip.", "Wyatt: Yeah?", "Liam: What -- what?", "Wyatt: Did you and Ivy get a chance to enjoy Amsterdam after Hope and I left?", "Liam: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: I wondered about that when I heard that Liam was going along.", "Hope: Yeah, Ivy invited him right before we left.", "Eric: You didn't think that would be an issue?", "Hope: I did think it would be an issue. I was not okay with it. But I-I tried not to let it affect us, and... [Sighs] Eric, I love my family. I love my marriage. But Amsterdam... was not easy.", "Eric: Well, you made it look easy.", "Hope: Uh, I think Ivy and I both tried to be professionals.", "Eric: But you'd rather not have to go out of town with Ivy for a while.", "Hope: After what happened with Rick and Caroline, I feel like I should be very honest with you. I know that I'm married and I'm having a baby, a baby who I am already so head over heels in love with. And Wyatt and I, we -- we can't wait to be parents, but at the same time... it wasn't long ago that Liam and I were making the exact same plans. And then Quinn came along, and she ruined everything. And -- and -- and it still just feels very... unfair.", "Eric: You were manipulated. If Quinn hadn't interfered, you -- you'd still be with Liam, wouldn't you?", "Hope: I'm trying really hard to get past that.", "Eric: You can. You will. You're a strong girl.", "Hope: I want to be.", "Eric: Good. Thanks for being honest with me.", "Hope: Thank you. [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: You and Ivy seemed to be having a great time out there, that's all.", "Liam: Oh, yeah. You keeping an eye on us?", "Wyatt: It's kind of hard not to notice how into you she is. And the feeling looked pretty mutual at thanksgiving, like something might have happened over at Amsterdam. Like maybe you took my advice. So did you?", "Liam: Subtle. Real subtle.", "Wyatt: I'm saying -- you and Ivy are good together, and everybody sees it.", "Liam: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: You moving on doesn't have to be this heavy thing. It's already happening. You just got to relax and let go.", "Liam: Follow the current, huh?", "Wyatt: Exactly. Liam, you and Ivy can have a great life together. Just like the one that Hope and I have.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: [Sighs] There we go. Do you think Pam will approve?", "Aly: [Chuckles] Totally. Thanks for helping, Ivy.", "Ivy: You know, I just -- I really want Hope to know that she has my support. I think she's gonna make an amazing mother.", "Aly: Well, who knows? If things work out with you and Liam, you could be an amazing aunt.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Hope doesn't get to choose her child's family. She chose Wyatt. And like it or not, I am part of that deal.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: Well, if it makes you feel any better, she's not exactly fond of grandpa bill Spencer, either, so...", "[Cell phone rings]", "Deacon: Yeah, Sharpe.", "Pam: Uh, deacon? It's Pam Douglas.", "Deacon: Hi, pam.", "Pam: Um, I'm just calling to tell you that we're giving a baby shower for Hope later this afternoon at Eric's house.", "Deacon: Okay, well, baby showers aren't exactly my thing, but, uh, if Hope wants me there, sure.", "Pam: Uh, well, you see, that's the thing. Um, it's a female-only function.", "Deacon: Okay, so if I'm not invited, why you telling me?", "Pam: You have a habit of dropping by unannounced. I'd rather you didn't.", "Deacon: Thanks for the heads up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Hope's having a baby shower today?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: Don't. Don't even think about it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Hey.", "Hope: Hi. I'm sorry. I should have called first.", "Liam: Stop it. Come on in.", "Hope: Thanks.", "Liam: Yeah. Um, aren't you, like, supposed to be at your baby shower?", "Hope: I am. I'm -- I'm on my way, yeah. Uh, I was just at the office talking to Eric, and I realized I should probably be talking to you.", "Liam: Ah. Yeah. Um, photos turned out amazing.", "Hope: They did?", "Liam: Yeah.", "Hope: Yes. Not why I'm here. Um...", "Liam: Oh.", "Hope: But I-I do want to talk about Amsterdam.", "Liam: Yeah. You and Wyatt left early.", "Hope: [Sighs] I saw the two of you together. I'm sorry. Um... I saw you and Ivy on the boat kissing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Deacon: Hate to point out the obvious, but Hope would have invited you if she wanted you to come to the baby shower.", "Quinn: Do you really think I want to go and subject myself to an entire afternoon of lemon bars and stupid party games?", "Deacon: That's a good point.", "Quinn: Thanks for breakfast.", "Deacon: No problem.", "Quinn: What to wear to a baby shower.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: I love you. I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just put you on the spot --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: I love you, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Aly: How's it look?", "Ivy: It looks delicious.", "[Both laugh]", "Aly: It's good to see you so happy, Ivy.", "Ivy: Is it really? I'm not -- I'm not annoying you? It's just -- I-I feel like an idiot. All I do is smile.", "Aly: You're in love.", "Ivy: [Sighs] You know, I-I still can't believe I said it, but the words just flew out of my mouth.", "Aly: You got swept up in the moment. Who wouldn't?", "Ivy: It was everything you could possibly want that moment to be. I'm on the most incredible ride of my life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hope: It was a fluke. I mean, I just -- I-I walked out onto the balcony, and I looked down, and...there you are.", "Liam: Yeah. You know... we noticed the hotel coming up. I just -- I didn't -- I didn't see you. I'm sorry.", "Hope: I know. No. Why would you?", "Liam: That why you left?", "Hope: Well... you know, the flight over was awkward enough.", "Liam: Yeah. Yeah. But things have been pretty good since we got back. I mean, thanksgiving, that was -- that was nice.", "Hope: Yeah. Yeah. And Ivy's been really friendly, really upbeat around the office, and... she seems really happy.", "Liam: Well, it was good. You know, it -- it was a good trip. Everything. The -- the photo shoot, and we even topped it off with a mystery boat ride. I still don't know who arranged that, by the way.", "Hope: I do.", "Liam: Who?", "Hope: Your brother.", "Liam: My brother. Yeah. Wyatt.", "Hope: He was -- you know, he was just trying to do something nice. He -- he got this idea in his head that if he got the two of you alone that something would happen, the right atmosphere, a little privacy. It looked really beautiful. I'm sure it was hard not to get swept up in it.", "Liam: Ivy told me she loved me.", "Hope: Wow. What did you say? You told her you love her. Yeah, well... why wouldn't you? She's a wonderful person. She's...she's exactly the kind of woman that you should be with. She really appreciates you, and that is... it's exactly what I want for you. I know you wouldn't have said it if you didn't mean it, Liam. You guys have been spending a lot of time together. She's been there for you through everything, so... it was really just a matter of time.", "Liam: [Sighs]", "Hope: I'm happy for you."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUN2jZjSvHg"}
