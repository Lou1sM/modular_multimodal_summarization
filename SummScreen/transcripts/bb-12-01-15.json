    "Recap": [
        "Steffy repeats again that Wyatt needs to know what Ivy did the minute he left town. Ivy tells Wyatt that Thomas was devastated of course but he accepted it that she is with Wyatt now. And she wants him right here. Bill tells Katie that she is totally hot in the kitchen and he kisses her right there. He can have his pasta and his wife. It's the greatest feeling in the world and he wants his grown sons to experience the same feeling. Maybe they will be throwing a double wedding before they know it. Wyatt tells Ivy that she is amazing and he knows what he has and he is not worried about Thomas. Liam interrupts before Ivy can say more that might have happened with Thomas. Steffy tells Thomas that he does not like Wyatt so that is why he is going after his girlfriend. Thomas laments nothing is happening anymore. She says but it did and that is cheating. If Ivy's feelings were real this would not have happened. She is supposed to be loyal to Wyatt and he deserves to know they both crossed the line. Thomas says he told her that in confidence and she can not betray that. It is nothing Ivy needs to be publicly shamed over. He says it started out one way but he really likes her. They made out a little bit but it stopped there so just let them go back to their lives. She says sorry, she can not do that.",
        "Bill thanks Katie for making him a better man, a man worthy of her. They start making out in the kitchen complete with baring all down to their bare essentials. Ivy drags Wyatt into the design room and plants kisses on him. She says she is so grateful for him and she wants him to know that. He says she is sexy and funny and entertaining .they were best friends first and they learned to trust each other right off the bat and he still does. She says she wants to deserve that and she will. She does not want to lose him. He kisses her and opines that he is going nowhere. Steffy's thoughts are on her face and Liam asks what is wrong. She tells him Ivy is wrong ..she has been cheating on Wyatt right under his nose. Ivy suggests to Wyatt they get away for a couple of days. He says yes, maybe a big old bed and not leave it. Thomas spies them kissing and says he hates to interrupt but he needs to see Ivy. Liam does not want to hear this about Ivy and he can not believe Thomas told Steffy that something almost happened. He says Thomas sees the world through his own ego so just stay out of this and let them work this out. She says Wyatt is a good guy and he deserves better than this. Liam says she does not know all the facts, they just have what Thomas said. He says even if it is true, Wyatt does not need their help. He says they are grownups and it is none of their business. He has to leave but the last words he says out the door is stay out of it! Ivy tells Thomas that whatever he needs he can say it in front of Wyatt. Thomas says no, not this time. She leaves, and Wyatt says again that there is no room in this equation in this for Thomas. Ivy is committed to him, period. Steffy calls Ivy into her office and reminds her that she is spending a lot of time with Thomas and it seems more personal than just the jewelry. She knows women are drawn to Thomas and she knows they kissed and had a private moment on Thanksgiving. She confronted Thomas and he said it was nothing, but then she heard Ivy say she felt guilty .so she knows when Wyatt was in San Francisco she made out with her brother. Ivy says this is not her business. Steffy says if Ivy does not tell Wyatt then she will."

        "Thomas: You're overreacting, Steff. Nobody cheated.",
        "Steffy: You just said the minute Wyatt left town, Ivy made out with you.",
        "Thomas: Well, not the minute.",
        "Steffy: You're not cute, no matter what she tells you.",
        "Thomas: I'm just trying to lighten you up, Steff. It wasn't a big deal.",
        "Steffy: Bet Wyatt would think so. Ivy's committed to Wyatt, or at least that's what he believes. If that's not true, then Wyatt needs to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, God. I wish I could've seen Thomas' face when you shot him down. I mean, that dude needs a dose of humble.",
        "Ivy: Well, right now, he is very aware that you are the only man in my life.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: How'd he take that?",
        "Ivy: Oh, he was devastated, of course.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I would be, if you told me to go away.",
        "Ivy: That's never gonna happen.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Mnh-mnh, 'cause I want you right here.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: You look hot.",
        "Katie: Is this because I'm barefoot in the kitchen, getting ready to serve you?",
        "Bill: I think so, yeah.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] You're such a throwback.",
        "Bill: And you are the embodiment of a thoroughly modern woman.",
        "Katie: Mm. Yin and yang. Is that why we work so well?",
        "Bill: Don't analyze it. Just kiss me like you mean it.",
        "Katie: [Giggles] Do you want your pasta or not?",
        "Bill: I want my wife.",
        "Katie: Well...the two are not mutually exclusive.",
        "Bill: I can have both?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Nice.",
        "Katie: See, that's what kind of devoted wife I am.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: But you should eat. You'll need your strength.",
        "Bill: Sounds promising.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] This is what it's all about. My gorgeous, sexy, intelligent wife keeping me grounded. A child we're raising. I come home at the end of the day and...here I am... with the people I belong to. It's the greatest feeling in the world. And I want my grown sons to experience that exact same thing.",
        "Katie: Well, I don't know how grounded she'll keep him, but Liam's on his way. He's marrying Steffy.",
        "Bill: Yeah, and Ivy and Wyatt seem happy, committed. Who knows? Maybe we'll be throwing a double wedding before you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: See? Even Thomas can't touch this. Because I know what we have.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: And I know you, and you are not that kind of woman. You are amazing.",
        "Ivy: Ugh.",
        "Wyatt: You are --",
        "Ivy: Okay, p-please don't put me on a pedestal, 'cause I heard that the fall can be quite painful.",
        "Wyatt: Don't worry, 'cause I'd catch you. What? What just happened?",
        "Ivy: No, I -- ugh, look, Wyatt, I -- look, there's something that I --",
        "Liam: Oh, sorry. Sorry. Thought you guys were done in here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Why were you in Ivy's bedroom, much less kissing her?",
        "Thomas: It's where we ended up. What do you want me to say?",
        "Steffy: Oh, I don't know. Maybe you have the slightest bit of remorse for duping Ivy into making out with you?",
        "Thomas: Trust me. She wasn't duped.",
        "Steffy: You don't like Wyatt because he's a Spencer, so you go after his girlfriend to hurt him.",
        "Thomas: This isn't about Wyatt. I told you that. It's about Ivy. I like her. All right? Uh, she's -- she's gorgeous. She's stunning. I-I find her different, okay? But you heard her, all right? I-it's over. Nothing is happening anymore.",
        "Steffy: But the point is, Thomas, it did happen. Ivy was fooling around with you when she's supposed to be exclusive with Wyatt. That's cheating.",
        "Thomas: It's a moment that got away from us.",
        "Steffy: If Ivy's feelings for Wyatt are real, this wouldn't have happened.",
        "Thomas: We kissed. We made out, okay? But we didn't cross any major lines.",
        "Steffy: Don't you get it, Thomas? Both of you crossed a line, and it is a major line. She is supposed to be loyal to Wyatt. Wyatt deserves to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Everything okay in here?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, Ivy was just about to tell me s--",
        "Ivy: Oh, no. We're fine. Um, d-do you need the office?",
        "Liam: I do, but, uh, I don't need you to rush off or anything. I think working with other people in the room seems to be a Forrester skill.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, ain't that the truth.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Hey, uh, you and Steffy -- you guys make any wedding plans yet, or what?",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] I'm still getting used to the engagement part.",
        "Wyatt: It must be great, though, just knowing you're getting married to your woman of choice after all this time.",
        "Liam: Yeah. You know, it is. It's kind of hard to believe.",
        "Ivy: Well, I guess it's a good thing, you know? If someone keeps coming back to you, you know that they're yours.",
        "Liam: Well, yeah. Well, you know, at this point, I can say Steffy and I are definitely meant to be together. I'm just, uh, not gonna tempt fate again, you know?",
        "Wyatt: That's a good policy. You know why? 'Cause you have what we're all looking for.",
        "Ivy: Mm?",
        "Wyatt: You know, a solid, trusting relationship, just safe harbor with someone you just -- you trust. You know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: You can't take this to Wyatt.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt deserves to know.",
        "Thomas: I told you about that night in confidence. You can't betray that.",
        "Steffy: I wouldn't throw that word around if I were you.",
        "Thomas: [Scoffs] Come on, Steff. Stop being melodramatic, okay? Nobody got betrayed. Ivy and I made out a little bit, but it stopped there, all right? It's -- it's nothing that Ivy needs to be publicly shamed over.",
        "Steffy: This is really interesting. What should I take from this valiant effort to protect Ivy? That you genuinely care about her?",
        "Thomas: Okay, yes, it started out that way. But I like her, all right? And I think she can do a Hell of a lot better than Wyatt Spencer.",
        "Steffy: And I think Wyatt can do a lot better than a girlfriend who makes out with the first guy who flirts with her.",
        "Thomas: Steffy, come on. All right, yeah, we made out a little bit, but it stopped there. It's not going any further, so just -- just pretend like you never saw anything, like you never heard anything. Let Wyatt and Ivy go back to their lives.",
        "Steffy: I'm sorry. I don't think I can do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Mmm.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] So, does it meet with your approval?",
        "Bill: Like everything you do.",
        "Katie: So full of compliments today. What do you want?",
        "Bill: Just appreciating the moment.",
        "Katie: I know what this is about. This is about you closing that deal right before you walked in here.",
        "Bill: Hell yeah.",
        "Katie: Mm.",
        "Bill: But what it's really about... the small things, the things that make up the fabric of our life. You taught me that, so thank you. Thank you for the pasta.",
        "Katie: Mm.",
        "Bill: For your grace, your style, most importantly, your good humor, because that's what allows you to put up with me.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] Yes.",
        "Bill: Thank you for making me a better man... a man finally worthy of you.",
        "Katie: You make you worthy of me.",
        "Bill: Yeah? Get over here.",
        "Katie: [Giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Hey, Lance. Uh, did those shipments from Italy come in?",
        "Lance: Oh, yeah. It came in this morning.",
        "Thomas: How do they look?",
        "Lance: They look really good.",
        "Thomas: Oh, great. Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. No, I got it. I'll figure it out. Don't worry about it. What?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] What?",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Ivy: Hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: I'm so grateful for you. I just -- I want you to know that.",
        "Wyatt: Me, too. You've changed my life.",
        "Ivy: Ugh.",
        "Wyatt: You warmed the cold spots. You brought charm and fun to everything.",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm such a riot.",
        "Wyatt: You are, more than you know. Trust me. You're funny. You know, your perspective on things, your unique take on them is amusing and enlightening and always entertaining.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: I'm -- I'm glad that we're together.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "Wyatt: You know what I like about us?",
        "Ivy: Mm?",
        "Wyatt: We were best friends first. Like, we knew everything about each other, and we just -- we -- we learned to trust each other right off the bat. And I do. I-I trust you more than anything.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but... look, I-I want to deserve that. And I will, okay? I promise.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Hey, before Liam came in, you -- you wanted to tell me something.",
        "Ivy: Oh, um...no, it was -- it was just -- it was just this. Just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you. And I don't want to lose you. Mm. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Now, does that feel like I'm going anywhere? I'm going nowhere.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: I've taken all the boxes to shipping. I'll let you know when the truck leaves.",
        "Steffy: Great. Thank you so much, Adam.",
        "Adam: Thanks.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: What's wrong?",
        "Steffy: I was wrong... about Ivy's commitment to your brother. She's been cheating on Wyatt right under his nose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I love times like this. We've never been happier together.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: Will is thriving.",
        "Bill: What is the deal with that kid?",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Bill: It's like he grows an inch every time we leave the house.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] He's such a little man, trying hard to be like his daddy.",
        "Bill: We have to keep an eye on that.",
        "Katie: Mm?",
        "Bill: He has to be better than me. That's where your genes come in.",
        "Katie: Oh, you didn't do so bad. Wyatt and Liam are great, you know? They're...creative and ambitious.",
        "Bill: And now Liam and Steffy are getting married.",
        "Katie: And who knows? Maybe Wyatt and Ivy are next.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] I am so lucky to have you by my side - my wife, my best friend, my partner. The future never looked brighter.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Ivy: I've been thinking.",
        "Wyatt: Uh-oh.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] I've been thinking maybe we should, uh -- maybe we should get away for a couple of nights. We've just been working so hard on this line.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. I like where this is going. Couple nights away, maybe a cabin in Aspen. You and me, me and you, large bed, just can never leave it.",
        "Ivy: That -- oh, that sounds amazing.",
        "Wyatt: Mm?",
        "Ivy: Can we do that tonight?",
        "Wyatt: I wish.",
        "Ivy: Oh, I wish it was that easy. There is nowhere on the planet I would rather be than just somewhere isolated with you.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Thomas: Yo.",
        "[Both groan]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat]",
        "Thomas: Hate to interrupt.",
        "Wyatt: Sure, you did.",
        "Thomas: I need to talk to you alone. It's important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Ivy cheated on Wyatt? That can't be true.",
        "Steffy: I went to see Thomas, but then Ivy was there. She was all emotional and frantic. So I waited for Ivy to leave, and then I confronted Thomas. He played like it was nothing, but then I threatened to -- I threatened to go to Wyatt, and he told me everything.",
        "Liam: Do I really want to hear this?",
        "Steffy: When Wyatt was in San Francisco, Ivy and Thomas stayed at the house. And then Thomas went into the bedroom, and they made out.",
        "Liam: What?! And you believe him?",
        "Steffy: I mean... yeah. But Ivy shouldn't be doing any of this. She's committed to Wyatt. He doesn't deserve that. Now she's playing him.",
        "Liam: Hold -- hold -- wait. Hold on a second. Don't -- don't jump to conclusions, okay? Uh, you know how Thomas sees the world -- through the lens of his own ego. Ivy could have a completely different story, right? I mean, you know what they say about truth.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Somewhere in the middle.",
        "Liam: Exactly, which is where you don't have to be. Don't -- just -- just stay out of it, okay? Let them work this out on their own.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt is a good guy. He deserves someone who values him. And, you know, I could think of a hundred girls who would.",
        "Liam: Hold on. Do you -- you see how far ahead of yourself you're getting? You got to slow down. You don't know all the facts. All you have is Thomas' interpretation, which you know could be tainted by his dislike of all things Spencer.",
        "Steffy: Okay, Thomas and I, we tell each other the truth. Ivy's cheating.",
        "Liam: [Sighing] Okay. Okay, fine. Let's -- [Sighs] Fine. If that's true, it's between Ivy and Wyatt. They don't need your help.",
        "Steffy: Wow. I thought you'd be more upset for your brother. So, what -- we're supposed to just sit and watch Ivy play Wyatt?",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs]",
        "Liam: Yes, Steffy. They're grown-ups, and it's none of our business. So please -- please... don't say anything about this to Wyatt.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Liam: Okay, I got to -- [Sighs] I got to go take care of something. Stay out of it, okay? Stay out of it. Okay? Stay out of it. Stay out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of Wyatt.",
        "Thomas: I don't think you want that.",
        "Ivy: Well, Wyatt and I are together.",
        "Thomas: Oh, I know.",
        "Ivy: We don't keep secrets from each other.",
        "Thomas: Interesting.",
        "Ivy: You know what? I'm gonna leave.",
        "Wyatt: It's okay. I got this.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I'm gonna need you to hear what I'm saying. Absorb the words. Process it, even if it takes you a minute. I get why you're attracted to Ivy. I mean, what man wouldn't be? But I'm gonna need you to back off. Ivy said she's not available. She is in a relationship with me, committed to me. Do you understand? There is no room in this equation for you.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Ivy: Steffy? Hey, just want to let you know, Pam scheduled a meeting for tomorrow, 3:00 P.M., with our Bayside suppliers.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, that should work. Ivy, uh, wait.",
        "Ivy: What's wrong?",
        "Steffy: Um, I just -- I -- I need you to clear something up for me.",
        "Ivy: Oh, okay.",
        "Steffy: You've been spending a lot of time with Thomas lately.",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah, because I've been choosing jewelry to go with his dress designs.",
        "Steffy: It seems like it's getting a little more personal than that. You know that. I know that.",
        "Ivy: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Steffy: It's just that, um, women are drawn to Thomas, and I just want to know if it's happening to you.",
        "Ivy: Where are you going with this, Steffy?",
        "Steffy: Okay, I'll tell you what I know. I know that you and Thomas kissed. And I know that you had a private moment at Thanksgiving. It didn't seem work related. And it seemed like it was... more than friends. So I confronted Thomas about it, and he said it was nothing.",
        "Ivy: Well, I hope you listened to him.",
        "Steffy: Okay, that's the thing, Ivy. I-I did. And then I was on the way to the design office, and I overheard you saying some things. You said that you feel guilty, and it should never happen again. So I went back to my brother, and he told me everything. When Wyatt was in San Francisco, you made out with my brother. Did you?",
        "Ivy: It's not what you think, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: It's not what I think. It's what I know.",
        "Ivy: I don't have to explain myself to you, Steffy, because it's none of your business.",
        "Steffy: This is Wyatt's business. He's a good guy, and he's gonna be my brother-in-law soon. What you're doing to him -- he does not deserve that.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, it's a little bit more complicated than --",
        "Steffy: Save the justifications for Wyatt. Because if you're not gonna say anything to him, guarantee you, I will."
