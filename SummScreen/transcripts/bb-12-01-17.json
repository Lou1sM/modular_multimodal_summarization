Liam tells Sally that she is taking this brush-off pretty well considering. Darlita tells Coco that it is sort of like a little love story on its own that now both Liam and Sally have the Spectra dust in their systems. If Steffy were gone he would be automatically drawn to that women who he shared so much with. Bill tells Steffy that he is not asking for anything. She can walk away as he understands this is killing her. But she needs to think twice about telling Liam. He is not going to let her paint what they had without goodness and caring. She says he deserves to lose his son. Liam deserves to know so just be prepared for anything. Sally says goodbye and thanks Liam for not slamming the door in her face. He says they are friends. She says she knows but she also knows they are not going to be hanging out together and that is okay. She does make this promise that if he needs her at all she will be there and she doesn't care who knows.", "Steffy goes home and Liam asks if she is okay. She says no.

But he can see that she is really unhappy about something so just tell him. Whatever it is she can tell him. It cannot be that bad. Sally tells Coco that Liam seems even happier than before. His wife came home and sounds like a new and improved wife. Sally says this time she knows what to look for. She learned her mistakes with Thomas and then Liam. She wants to be strong like Steffy and never give up. Bill cannot stop thinking about his night with Steffy and how they were meant to be. Liam reaches out to Steffy and she pushes him away and won't let him touch her. She cries that she cannot help herself. He asks if she is sick. She says no but she cannot pretend anymore. He thinks he knows that she must feel trapped. He put that whole renewal vows on her without giving her a chance to say no. She cries out that she cannot forget. He wants to know what she wants him to do. She replies just love her. He says he does. She cries out this has to do with his father."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["[ Birds chirping ]", "Steffy: [ Sniffles ] \"Meant to be\"?

My relationship with my son... it's older than time, the dance of dna through the ages. I will honor it. I will be a good and loyal father.", "Steffy: If he'll let you.", "Bill: Don't do what you're thinking of doing, steffy. Nothing good will come from liam knowing about that night.", "Steffy: At first you were shocked I didn't tell him. What's the difference now?", "Bill: You are. Remember the first time we were wrapped up in each other, before marriages and bloodlines pushed us to our separate corners? But then we made love.", "Steffy: Bill, stop calling it that.", "Bill: I can'T. I won'T. If you want to be in denial about it, fine. We'll -- we'll go back to the way things were. We'll keep the lie going with liam. But I can't lie to myself, and i can't lie to you about what it meant to finally be with you that night.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Uh, can I get you some more coffee or tea maybe or --", "Sally: No, really, i should -- I should definitely get going.", "Liam: Okay, well, I mean, i also have peanuts. I have, uh, peanuts and --", "Sally: Are you trying to be a good host or you testing me for allergies?", "Liam: [ Chuckles ] I -- yeah. I'm trying really hard not to do anything that could be taken as a brush-off while patiently waiting for you to give me some clue as to why you're here. I mean, you're having doubts about us helping spectra get back on their feet, I completely understand that.", "Sally: No. No, no, no. Not at all. I mean, your father made that promise in front of way too many witnesses at thanksgiving.", "Liam: Uh, so...", "Sally: So... I am about to embarrass myself again. Fancy that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coco: Isn't that too many?", "Darlita: How many does shirley usually deal out?", "Coco: I don't want to learn poker from grams. She cheats.

Is it the cushions?", "Darlita: Remember when your sister and liam went to the hospital for swallowing all that demolition dust?", "Coco: Yeah, how could i forget? What? You think we have dust?", "Darlita: No. It's just kind of sad and beautiful that now they both have spectra stuck in their internal organs forever. It's kind of like a little love story all on its own. Wouldn't it be terrible if liam's wife was lost at sea in a tragic boating accident?", "Coco: [ Chuckles ] Steffy's my boss. We don't wish that on her.", "Darlita: No, of course not. But last night, I saw a show where a woman was swept out to sea and then rescued by a beautiful island boy. And they fell in love.", "Coco: I don't really see steffy with an island boy.", "Darlita: Whatever.

I'm really not saying this right.", "Liam: No, you're doing fine.", "Sally: Just that things really are okay. Yes, I know you guys said you renewed your vows. And that's great, you know.

I'm just really relieved to know that I didn't do that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I shouldn't have come here.", "Bill: But you did. I'm not asking you for anything.", "Steffy: No?", "Bill: You feel what you feel, and that's your business, even if you don't know what it is. I understand that this is killing you. But you better think very carefully before you do what you're thinking of doing to my son.", "Steffy: What? Being an honest wife to my husband? I can't leave liam and come running to you, so can you just get that thought out of your head?", "Bill: So you say. But be too honest a wife to him, and he'll leave you.", "Steffy: No. No, you're wrong.", "Bill: I'm not. Don't make any decisions until you're more emotionally in control.", "Steffy: Liam will forgive me!", "Bill: It's too much to expect.", "Steffy: One mistake is not gonna end the marriage, but a lie? A lie will! Just give it time!", "Bill: Lying to each other is the price of happiness, and we all willingly pay it.", "Steffy: Well, maybe that's true for you.", "Bill: You're lying to yourself right now. There was nothing indecent about what happened between us.", "Steffy: You're my father-in-law, bill.", "Bill: Yes. But there was a time for us when I wasn'T. Look, you want to stay married, I'm not going to fight you on your decision. But I'm not gonna let you paint what happened between us as something that was without goodness or caring... or love.", "Steffy: [ Voice breaking ] I wish it never happened.", "Bill: That's a wish I can't share.", "Steffy: Well, I'm sorry. I-I can't listen to this right now.", "Bill: I have a stake in this, too. Liam and I just reconciled. You tell him, and I will lose my son.", "Steffy: And you deserve to! Bill, I...

What are we, then?", "Sally: I mean, we're not gonna be hanging out together. You and steffy are not gonna have me over for pizza and beer and bowl games, and we're gonna be very aware of who's watching us whenever we do run into each other.", "Liam: I mean, yeah, okay. It'll be like that for a minute, but in time --", "Sally: In time, the things that brought us together are no longer gonna be there. Look, it's okay. It's how it has to be. But I do make this promise to you. If you need me for any reason at all, I will be there, and I do not give a damn who knows it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Door closes ]", "Coco: How about jacks? Do you have any jacks?", "Darlita: Go fish.", "Coco: [ Scoffs ] I can't really concentrate on cards.", "Darlita: Yeah, me either.

You okay?", "Steffy: No.", "Liam: Something happen at work?", "Steffy: I didn't make it to work.", "Liam: Oh. Well, what, then? You -- you look not yourself.", "Steffy: Hypocrisy will do that to you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Please tell me you didn't let grams come over and trounce you in blackjack.", "Coco: [ Chuckles ] No. Darlita came by. Hey, I-I might have told her some personal things that she kind of already guessed.", "Sally: Coco, my life is an open book to you and you alone.", "Coco: I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but she won't say anything. You know how much she adores you and stories involving kisses. Hey, was liam happy to see you?", "Sally: Well, he didn't slam the door in my face. But you should see his house. It is on a cliff in malibu.", "Coco: Did you run into steffy?", "Sally: No. No. I'm trying to avoid trouble. I just -- I wanted to go over there to make sure that they actually were okay, and... they are. I don't know if liam was happy to see me, but he's happy.

And I had every intention of telling you, I promise.", "Steffy: I'm not worried about you and sally.", "Liam: Oh. Why am I a hypocrite?", "Steffy: No, you're not. [ Sighs ] What did she want?", "Liam: Uh, well, you didn't work her over with brass knuckles at thanksgiving, so she thought something was wrong. I mean, you know how people are. They -- they do something they feel guilty about. They expect to be punished. Maybe they even insist on it, think it's gonna make them feel better. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn'T. But...", "Steffy: Well, she's out of luck, because my brass knuckles are at the cleaners.", "Liam: Well, she had you on a pedestal before. Now you might go from princess to empress.", "[ Laughs ]", "Steffy: I'm just sick of people looking at me like that.", "Liam: Yeah, well, it's your fault. Stop being so amazing. You know every time you pass someone in the hallway at forrester, they fall in love with you. Hell, I fall in love with you every time you walk through the -- okay, you are really unhappy about something.", "Steffy: It's just so crazy how everything can just change. Just a few words and what you had is just...it's gone.", "Liam: Who's gone? Who's gone? I'm not gone. Steffy. Whatever it is, you know you can -- you can tell me, right? I mean, it can't be that bad.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sally: Have you ever gotten the sense that life is trying to give you a clue about what your future might be?", "Coco: You mean like a horoscope?", "Sally: No, like... I've always known that I never needed a man to make me happy. But these past few months, i have been really torn up about first thomas and now liam, and I -- honestly, I could not have picked up the pieces without you. But I just finally realized that the next time I let a man into my life, I know exactly what he has to be like.", "Coco: I just -- I think you've got it bad.", "Sally: No, coco. No. I have got it great. Look, there were things that i thought I saw in thomas that weren't really there, you know, and that's not his fault. It happens. But I just don't think I'm ever gonna make that mistake again because now I know what to look for. And you don't have to be sad for me. I'm not. Liam has brought nothing but good into my life, and now i know the person I have to be to deserve a man like that. Someone who never gives up.", "Coco: Sally, you already are.", "Sally: I just want to be stronger, you know? I want to be someone who never gives up, no matter how bad things are. I mean, do you really think that steffy's like, \"oh, I can't be who you want me to be, so I'm just gonna give up\"?", "Coco: Maybe when nobody's listening.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: The truth is that you and I are more alike than you and liam will ever be. We belong together. We have always belonged together. And deep down inside, you know that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[ Cellphone chirps ]", "Liam: Okay, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna make you some tea.", "Steffy: No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can't waste any more time.", "Liam: Before what?", "Steffy: [ Sniffles ] [ Voice breaking ] I just don't want you to forget. I want you to love me.", "Liam: Okay, steffy, you're -- you're really scaring me.", "Steffy: I'm scaring myself, too, but I just c-- I can't help it.", "[ Sniffles ]", "Liam: Are you sick? Are you sick?", "Steffy: No.", "Liam: Well, 'cause you left for a little bit. You came back, and you're crying and you're shaking.", "Steffy: You want me to pretend, but I can't pretend anymore!", "[ Sniffles ]", "[ Sighs ]", "Liam: I know. I know. I get it. This is about -- you feel trapped.", "Steffy: Yes.", "Liam: You feel like you had no choice, right? I knew -- god, I knew I would screw that up.", "Steffy: No, no, no, no, no, no! No, it's not you! It's not you!", "Liam: No, I'm not even talking about breaking our marriage vows. I'm talking about what I tried to do to make up for it.", "Steffy: It's not about sally!", "Liam: Springing that whole vow-renewal thing on you.", "Steffy: What?", "Liam: Yeah, I totally sprung that on you. You had no choice. You felt like you had to say yes, right? Well, maybe you didn't actually want to stay married.", "Steffy: No, of course I do!", "Liam: I'm trying to sweep it under the rug 'cause that's what the guilty party always wants to do.", "Steffy: That's -- that's exactly what I felt. Like, I-I felt like I had to pretend! I just can't pretend anymore!", "Liam: I am so sorry. I am so sorry.", "Steffy: Can you just let me finish?", "Liam: No, but the thing is, I-I thought --", "Steffy: I just can't let you forget, okay?! I just can't let you forget.", "Liam: What do you want me to do?", "Steffy: Just... just love me.", "Liam: Steffy, you -- you have that. You will always have that. I'm just trying to figure out how to make amends.", "Steffy: No, this isn't about you! This isn't about you.", "Liam: Okay, then what is it?
