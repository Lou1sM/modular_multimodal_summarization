        "Nick: \"I'll have ya walkin' the plank, I will.\" \"Don't ya talk to me that way.\" \"I can talk to ya anyway I --\" I love these guys. Oh, look at this thing. Opens three bottles at once. My crew gave me this the first time I was out as first mate.",
        "Bridget: Wow, so it's not only a labor saving device. It also has sentimental value.",
        "Nick: These are my suits. I actually get more use out of this than those.",
        "Bridget: Gosh, they're really dusty. [ Gasps ] Is that mildew?",
        "Nick: It could probably use a little airing out.",
        "Bridget: Oh, lord, I think I'm just going to call my dad and have him deliver some suits from Forrester. Ah, that's the island fertility god? The one made in Hong Kong?",
        "Nick: Have you ever been to Hong Kong? Wall-to-wall people. They have no problem with their fertility.",
        "Bridget: Well, I don't think we have a problem with fertility, either. Junk.",
        "Nick: You think you can find a place for this?",
        "Bridget: Oh my gosh, that is so -- adorable. Oh sweetheart, ooh! I love it. I love it.",

        "Ridge: So, Felicia in my job, huh?",
        "Taylor: Oh, it's not your job. You're in your job.",
        "Ridge: Am I? You never know, it's like a parallel universe down there in that basement. It my turn yet?",
        "Taylor: Cheater. Ten minutes, I'm timing you.",
        "Ridge: So Felicia's going to be heading up mother's design team?",
        "Taylor: Well, that was the offer. She didn't say yes, and she didn't say no.",
        "Ridge: You're never going to convince me that this was mother or Thorne's big brainstorm.",
        "Taylor: Felicia's designs are a little bit edgy, but your mother did say she thought it was something she could work into these new classical designs.",
        "Ridge: You know, you think you're so clever. You do. I can read you like a book.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, Braile, maybe.",
        "Ridge: I got your Braile.",
        "Taylor: Aah, okay! Okay, okay.",
        "Ridge: You're just trying to bring the lamb back into the fold. I know what you're doing.",
        "Taylor: Oh, Felicia is definitely no lamb. Don't you think it would be good to have her back? Really, I mean, your mother's all alone in that great big house.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I wonder why.",
        "Taylor: Okay, I'm not saying she isn't reaping what she sowed. But at least Felicia's detached from this whole thing. And your mother wouldn't have to be on her guard all the time.",
        "Ridge: Are you kidding? If you're expecting those two to live under the same roof, you'd better hide all the knives and put away everything that says \"poison.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Felicia.",
        "Felicia: You should be ashamed of yourself.",
        "Stephanie: No hug for your mother?",
        "Felicia: When I get my inheritance back, maybe.",
        "Stephanie: Have you gone through your trust fund already?",
        "Felicia: No. But I was counting on having my lifestyle take a quantum leap when you croak.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I'm going to redistribute the stock eventually. In the meantime, would it kill you to work?",
        "Felicia: For you, it'd surely do one of us in.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I understand that you were looking favorably on our job offer. Taylor said you didn't turn it down.",
        "Felicia: No, I'm doing that now.",
        "Stephanie: You flew all the way back here to turn down the job.",
        "Felicia: Mother, I have a life and a home to get back to, and this isn't it.",
        "Stephanie: What life, what home? Tell me about it.",
        "Felicia: If I want to be disapproved of, I'll send you a postcard. You know, it's getting late.",
        "Stephanie: Don't do this. I almost lost you to cancer, didn't I? Now you can be angry with me, you can make fun of me, I don't care. But don't do this again. Now why can't you come back and live in Los Angeles? Obviously you were tempted, that's why you came. Something changed since you're back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Did Felicia say anything about me?",
        "Taylor: Well, she seemed amused -- well, I wouldn't say -- yeah -- no. She seems happy, that you're banished to the basement.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I'm sure she loves that one.",
        "[ Taylor chuckles ]",
        "Taylor: Well, it's not a thing out of spite. It's more like that big brother, little sister thing. She adores you.",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Taylor: Okay, so it's my turn.",
        "Ridge: I wrote to her when she was in France. She didn't write back. Well, she did, but her letters never really said much. I think nick Marone messed with her head.",
        "Taylor: I kind of got that feeling, too -- that she wasn't just here because of the job offer. I mean, that door's been open for a long time.",
        "Ridge: Why do you think she came to see you, and yet she wouldn't stick around to see me?",
        "Taylor: Me, she can keep at an arms length. You, she has to get real with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: You want to explain to me why the clothes that you don't wear are so pristinely folded, yet the clothes that you do wear are all balled up?",
        "Nick: Pristine comes from the cleaners, honey. I wanted to mention to you, when I went over to the boat, Felicia was there.",
        "Bridget: Felicia? My half-sister?",
        "Nick: Yeah, in the flesh.",
        "Bridget: I don't hear from her in how long, and then she shows up?",
        "Nick: I think she got a job offer from the new and improved Forrester Creations.",
        "Bridget: Is her health okay?",
        "Nick: So she says.",
        "Bridget: But you don't believe her?",
        "Nick: No, I -- yeah, I guess so. It's hard to tell with her. It always has been.",
        "Bridget: It's pretty clear. She just shows up out of the blue on your doorstep. She's investigating her possibilities. And you used to be a possbility for her.",
        "Nick: Well that was over before she left.",
        "Bridget: Well, maybe it wasn't as over for her, as it was for you.",
        "Nick: I think she's just surprised I got so lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: So I hear your new battle cry for Forrester Creations is \"women of the world, cover up.\"",
        "Stephanie: Oh. I want to have beautiful, stylish clothes. That's why I'm wooing you.",
        "Felicia: Really? Not because no other big name in design would sign onto your sinking ship?",
        "[ Stephanie chuckles ]",
        "Stephanie: Well, if you think the ship is going to sink, then why don't you come and work with me? Protect your inheritance.",
        "Felicia: Better yet, why don't you and I go to Fiji? Let dad do it. He's the one that turned the place into a cash cow.",
        "Stephanie: Well, he's still working at the company.",
        "Felicia: Yeah, in the dungeon, I hear. You are too much. Why would I want to work with you, Mother? You'd be digging a sub-basement to keep me in.",
        "Stephanie: Look, you packed a suitcase. You got on the plane, and you came. So I must mean something to you. Or maybe it's that you're filled with grief over the trouble that you gave me as a teenager. Or maybe it's because I'm alone, and you're alone, too. Or maybe it's just that you want me to say out loud that I need you. Okay, I need you. Will you stay?",
        "Felicia: Can't.",
        "Stephanie: Won't.",
        "Felicia: Can't.",
        "Stephanie: All right, you just wanted to hear me beg out loud. You just wanted to come here and see me all alone in the big house. I mean, I understand gloating can be fun. But was it really worth a transatlantic flight?",
        "Felicia: There were people I wanted to see.",
        "Stephanie: Am I one of them?",
        "Felicia: Am I here?",
        "Stephanie: Your behavior makes absolutely no sense.",
        "Felicia: Did it ever?",
        "Stephanie: No, no, no, no. You were either always flaunting something or hiding something. Which is it now? You determined to go back to Paris to see someone? Ah. You're trying to avoid someone here.",
        "[ Phone rings ]",
        "Felicia: Hello?",
        "Renee: I'm afraid we have a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: You know, I never really knew Felicia all that well.",
        "Nick: A lot of people could probably say that. Do you mind if I move some of your stuff out so I can move mine in? Would that be okay?",
        "Bridget: Yeah.",
        "Nick: Here. Thanks.",
        "Bridget: Didn't she have a major thing for you?",
        "Nick: Oh, we had some laughs.",
        "Bridget: Oh. I mean, I don't mean to pry, but wasn't her way of having a few laughs a little wild?",
        "Nick: Well, you know how people get reputations. It's kind of silly. I found some pills in her bag once, and I just jumped to the conclusion that she had a problem.",
        "Bridget: What were they?",
        "Nick: Chemo. For her cancer.",
        "Bridget: Oh, gosh. I can't imagine going through something like that alone. She's got to be really tough.",
        "Nick: She acts tough, but I think the truth is she doesn't feel as though the family supported her. Especially Stephanie, you know? You can't count on people you can't count on.",
        "Bridget: I bet you were there for her.",
        "Nick: Uh, well, you know -- I did what I could. Maybe not the way she hoped, but in the important ways.",
        "Bridget: Okay, end of grilling.",
        "Nick: Were you grilling me?",
        "Bridget: It would've degenerated into that. But you know exactly the right way to talk about someone that you were involved with. Kindly and respectfully, without a lot of detail.",
        "Nick: Thank you.",
        "Bridget: Just make sure there's not a lot of them, okay?",
        "Nick: Could you grab my black book o on the desk, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Time's up.",
        "Ridge: Spoilsport. Hey. Thank you for bringing my baby sister back.",
        "Taylor: Well, I wish I could tell you for sure that she was going to stay.",
        "Ridge: You're very subversive, you know that?",
        "Taylor: I thought I was upstanding. But I'll take subversive.",
        "Ridge: You go under the guise of enlisting yourself with my mother's team, here. What you're really try to do is patch things up with my family.",
        "Taylor: That would've happened with or without my help. You're all so -- I don't know, what's the word -- connected.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, our hands are around each other's throats.",
        "Taylor: Exactly! Exactly, you can't leave each other alone.",
        "Ridge: Is that love?",
        "Taylor: It's a side effect.",
        "Ridge: Any word from Hector?",
        "Taylor: No.",
        "Ridge: Then you guys can leave each other alone?",
        "Taylor: Yes.",
        "Ridge: Must not be love then.",
        "Taylor: I never said it was.",
        "Ridge: You know, I'd rather you chastise me, throw me out of the house, then kiss some other guy.",
        "Taylor: I'd rather those not be my only two choices.",
        "Ridge: You could always just -- you know -- like me.",
        "Taylor: I do like you. You're such a guy.",
        "Ridge: You've got too many clothes on, you know that?",
        "Taylor: See what I mean? You're such a guy.",
        "Ridge: Don't you forget it.",

        "Felicia: What do you mean you can't find a room?",
        "Stephanie: Who needs a room?",
        "Felicia: Renee, it's Los Angeles. There are more hotels than Chinese restaurants.",
        "Renee: Yes, but not all of them will take us. We have special circumstances, remember?",
        "Stephanie: Stay here, stay at the house.",
        "Felicia: Thank you, Mother, but I prefer to have some privacy.",
        "Stephanie: You can stay in the guest house. I won't come within 50 yards.",
        "Felicia: Fifty yards? You promise?",
        "Stephanie: I swear on the bible.",
        "Felicia: Renee, you remember where you dropped me off? Okay, there's a little guest house about halfway up the driveway. I'll meet you there. Bye. It'll only be for a night.",
        "Stephanie: Stay as long as you want, honey.",
        "Felicia: Thank you.",
        "Stephanie: So it'll be you and -- Rrenee?",
        "Felicia: Mother, I'm serious. I don't want to be disturbed.",
        "Stephanie: I understand. But, I mean, you could bring him at least to the door so I could meet him.",
        "Felicia: Who?",
        "Stephanie: Renee. I'm assuming he's the fellow that -- and the reason that -- you want to go back to France.",
        "Felicia: Stop assuming, Mother. Renee is not a man.",
        "Stephanie: A woman?",
        "Felicia: Still as sharp as a tack. Are the beds in the guest house made?",
        "Stephanie: Did you really think you couldn't have this conversation with me? Of course your girl -- Renee, is welcomed here.",
        "Felicia: That's great, Mother. Thank you. But you're never going to lay eyes on her, so it doesn't matter.",
        "Stephanie: Sweetheart, is this the reason that things never worked out with you and Nick, and the other men in your life?",
        "Felicia: Mother please, don't get all tolerant on me.",
        "Stephanie: Tolerant? You're my daughter. I love you, I want you to be happy. I'm thrilled that you've met someone.",
        "Felicia: I'm not a lesbian, okay? She travels with me. She helps me out.",
        "Stephanie: I know lesbians. Whatever you want.",
        "Felicia: I'm too tired for this conversation. Can we table it?",
        "Stephanie: I'm glad we had this talk.",
        "Felicia: You had it, not me. But still, for us, it's not bad. Goodnight, Mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: You know I only married you for the sex.",
        "Ridge: That's all I'm good for, anyway.",
        "Taylor: Well, you're a pretty good father.",
        "Ridge: As long as the kids' votes don't count.",
        "Taylor: Mmm. You're kind of talented.",
        "Ridge: I'm a hack. That's how I make money. Don't stop, what else do you like about me?",
        "Taylor: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: Hey! Hey.",
        "Taylor: You're not a quitter. I think I like that best.",
        "Ridge: I like throwing a tantrum and storming out, though.",
        "Taylor: Yeah, but you always come back.",
        "Ridge: What choice do I have? If you took me at my word, and booted me out -- you could do better you know.",
        "Taylor: Sweetheart, if I ever made you feel like I don't love you the way you are, I am sorry.",
        "Ridge: Ah, there is hope.",
        "Taylor: I must be awful to live with.",
        "Ridge: Totally agonizing.",
        "Taylor: Mm-hmm. Well, I'm always analyzing and finding fault.",
        "Ridge: Mine are easy to find.",
        "Taylor: I personally like to hide mine.",
        "Ridge: You don't have any.",
        "Taylor: See? You're totally snowed. You are so snowed.",
        "Ridge: I've got to be the luckiest lughead in the world to be lying here next to you. Nobody's going to convince me otherwise.",
        "Taylor: Hmm. Well, in that case, you're right.",
        "Ridge: Those have got to be the two favorite words in the English language for me. You don't say them nearly enough. What was it -- what was it?",
        "Taylor: You're right.",
        "Ridge: One more time.",
        "Taylor: You're right.",
        "Ridge: We're okay, Doc. We're going to be okay.",

        "Nick: Why?",

        "Nick: Wait till they hear my clothes are folded. Ah!",
        "Bridget: Ah! I think this is how love works. You just screw up beyond repair and say 100 unforgivable things -- and you just open your eyes one day, and the other person's still there. And you think, \"huh, this must be the one.\"",
