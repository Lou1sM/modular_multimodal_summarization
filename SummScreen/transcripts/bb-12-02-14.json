        "Hope: No. No. I'm so glad you didn't. We're -- we're being honest with each other. That's good. And you know that you -- you can tell me anything. [Sniffles] Oh, it's just so much has happened for both of us so fast.",
        "Liam: A lot to take in, isn't it?",
        "Hope: Yeah. I want you to be happy.",
        "Liam: And you know I want the same for you, right?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Even though we can't be together... I am comforted in knowing that you're with someone like Ivy. She's a good person. And she loves you, and... that's what you deserve.",

        "Ivy: Yeah. Yeah. Mimosa?",
        "Caroline: Oh, don't mind if I do.",
        "Pam: I wanted to go with a medieval theme, but Miss Aly wouldn't let me.",
        "Ivy: It's a baby shower, Pam.",
        "Pam: There were babies in the medieval times, Ivy.",
        "Caroline: So, who's all coming?",
        "Pam: Well, I didn't think we could not not invite Maya, you know, so I hope that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable.",
        "Caroline: No, I'm fine.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I mean, it may be a little awkward on her end, but I'm fine.",
        "Aly: Easy for you to say. Uncle Rick dumped her and came back to you.",
        "Caroline: He did, didn't he?",
        "Ivy: So, is Hope's monster-in-law coming?",
        "Aly: No way. Hope would be livid if Quinn showed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: After everything Quinn has done, I don't blame Hope for wanting to shut her out of their lives.",
        "Caroline: Pushing you in the seine.",
        "Aly: Manufacturing this life for Hope.",
        "Ivy: You know what? I think she should keep Quinn far away from that little baby.",

        "Katie: Geez, Donna, I said I would help you.",
        "Donna: I know.",
        "Katie: Can you believe this?",
        "Aly: Hey, guys.",
        "Donna: Can you help me, please?",
        "Pam: Geez, Donna. What'd you do? Buy the entire baby store?",
        "Donna: No, no. Just help, please.",
        "Pam: All right.",
        "Donna: Okay, ready. One, two, three, down. [Sighs] No, it's from Brooke and Katie, too. Then, oh, this is from Bridget. She sends her love.",
        "Pam: Good.",
        "Katie: Yeah, the aunts are taking over for the mother today.",
        "Donna: Yeah. What about the other grandmom?",
        "Ivy: Oh, well, actually, that's really funny, 'cause we were just talking about her.",
        "Pam: Yeah. Hope made it pretty clear. She is not welcome at this baby shower.",

        "Deacon: Hey. What -- what is that?",
        "Quinn: What is what?",
        "Deacon: The -- the outfit.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Well, these are called clothes, Deacon. I know you've grown accustomed to seeing me without them, but...",
        "Deacon: Please tell me that you're not going to crash Hope's baby shower.",
        "Quinn: I can't get dressed up every now and again without you getting suspicious?",
        "Deacon: Quinn! Argh! Look, I get that you desperately want to be a part of Hope and the grandkid's life, but unfortunately, that's not what Hope wants right now. Honey, look at me. Hey. The best thing you can do is just stay away from my daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: It would be unfair of me to expect you not to move on. I mean, Liam, I knew it was inevitable.",
        "Liam: Hey, I feel the same way when I see you and Wyatt... with...his child growing inside you. But you're gonna -- you're gonna have a baby. You're gonna have a family, and, wow, that's really special, isn't it? That's -- that's something you've always wanted.",
        "Hope: I can't wait. [Laughs] I think my hormones are a little crazy right now, but, Liam, I'm -- I'm so excited. I'm -- I'm excited for this baby, and I'm excited about Wyatt and our future. [Sighs, chuckles]",
        "Liam: You know, someday... someday, everything we've been through, as hard as it's been, is gonna make sense.",
        "Hope: Hmm.",
        "Liam: Somehow.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Somehow. When you're holding that child in your arms, I mean, just imagining how much joy that's gonna bring you, that -- that makes me smile because that makes all of this bearable. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: I'm so sorry I'm late. My fitting ran over.",

        "Ivy: And before you ask, no, Quinn is not coming.",
        "Maya: I figured.",
        "Pam: I can't even imagine what it would be like to be cut off from your grandchild.",

        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deacon: You're so fixated on Hope, trying to win her over.",
        "Quinn: There's a lot at stake. My relationship with my son, my grandchild.",
        "Deacon: You got to ease up.",
        "Quinn: I can't.",
        "Deacon: Just try, you know. I mean, just -- just stop obsessing. Why don't you, you know, try putting the focus on us?",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] That isn't self-serving at all.",
        "Deacon: Okay, all right, tough guy. You know what? You can pretend all you want that you're not as into this as I am, but I know the truth.",
        "Quinn: I wouldn't go that far.",
        "Deacon: Come on, Quinn. Stay with me.",
        "Quinn: I have plans.",

        "Quinn: [Chuckles] [Sighs] There's only one problem.",
        "Deacon: What's that?",
        "Quinn: Why do I always fall for the wrong guy?",
        "Deacon: What? You think I did any better? Honey, you are downright scary.",
        "Quinn: I am, aren't I?",
        "Deacon: Hmm. Bad to the bone.",
        "Quinn: Save me some whiskey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You know, there are so many things in my life that I'm unsure of. But I've always known you'd be an excellent mother.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Liam: Yeah. And hey, it's -- I mean, I can see the changes happening already. I mean, your devotion, the connection you have to this baby. This... this child means everything to you, and I think that's great. I think that's the way it should be.",
        "Hope: It is an incredible feeling. It really is. I wish I could describe it.",
        "Liam: Oh, you -- you don't have to.",
        "Hope: No?",
        "Liam: You got the glow.",
        "Hope: Is it that obvious?",
        "Liam: It's a little obvious, yeah.",
        "Hope: [Laughing] You can see it?",
        "Liam: You've never been more beautiful.",
        "Hope: I'm already so in love with this baby. I...I guess that's one really great thing that came out of all this.",
        "Liam: Hey, definitely. Yeah.",
        "Hope: Well, I should probably get to my baby shower. I think I'm already running late.",
        "Liam: Um... Quinn's not coming, right?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Hope: No, no, no. She's the last person I would invite.",
        "Liam: Okay. Good.",
        "Hope: Yeah, she's not allowed anywhere near me or my family.",
        "Liam: Hey, Hope?",
        "Hope: Yeah?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I don't -- I don't know if... would it be okay if I could -- I haven't really -- I haven't had a chance to, um...",
        "Hope: Do you want to feel the baby?",
        "Liam: Could I do that?",
        "Hope: Of course. Yeah.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Oh. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Deacon: Ha ha! You forget your keys again? At least you changed your mind about dinner. Hey, baby. What are you doing here?",
        "Liam: What are you doing here?",
        "Deacon: I... oh, geez. Um, c-come on in. You, uh, you want a glass of whiskey or something?",
        "Liam: No, I'm good. You didn't answer my question.",
        "Deacon: What does it look like?",
        "Liam: Oh, God! Oh, God! You and Quinn?!",
        "Deacon: Come on. What's the big deal?",
        "Liam: What's -- what's the big deal? She's insane, she's dangerous. What are you talking about?",
        "Deacon: Tell me something I don't know.",
        "Liam: Deacon, Deacon, you -- you know what she's capable of, right? She came after me with a sword. She -- she pushed Ivy off of a bridge, not to mention the countless times she's hurt your daughter.",
        "Deacon: I understand, okay? But just 'cause I'm in a relationship with her, it doesn't mean that I condone any of that.",
        "Liam: [Gasps] It's a relationship now?! This is a thing?!",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I suppose it is. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Well, does Hope know?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I came clean with her. Yeah, she knows.",
        "Liam: And?",
        "Deacon: She wasn't exactly supportive, which I get. But on the other hand she is still talking to me, so I guess things could be worse. You sure you don't want a glass of hooch, you look a little tense.",
        "Liam: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait where is Quinn now?",
        "Deacon: No clue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I cannot believe that you guys put this together so quickly.",
        "Pam: Well, Ivy and Ally helped a little.",
        "Ivy: A little.",
        "Ally: We wanted to make sure you had a special day.",
        "Hope: Thank you for helping.",
        "Ivy: We're all really excited for you Hope.",
        "Katie: Your mother sends her love.",
        "Hope: Oh yeah, I just talked to her on the way over. I--I miss her so much. (Laughs) But this is, it is so special, I'm so happy you're all here.",
        "Caroline: Oh, well we wouldn't miss it for anything in the world. My sweet sister-in-law.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Pam: Alright, who is ready for some games?!",
        "Katie: Games, already?",
        "Pam: Well, yeah there's a lot to do Katie.",
        "Donna: Come on, Katie, get with the program.",
        "Pam: OK, everybody take a card and write down on the card whether you think Hope is going to be having a boy or a girl.",
        "Everyone: Oohhh.",
        "Ally: I say girl.",
        "Ivy: Yes I agree.",
        "Maya: Really? No boy, defiantly.",
        "Pam: No, no, wait, wait, wait. Everybody don't yell it out. You're supposed to write it down.",
        "Hope: (Whispers) Sorry.",
        "Pam: And then that after that, write down the due date guesses. Alright go nuts guys.",
        "Donna: How about inches and weight?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Quinn lurks around outside the baby shower)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Oh, shucks! I just bought these.",
        "Ivy: Pam, it's fine. I mean, we don't really have to write anything down.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Pam: What?",
        "Katie: Well, I'm guessing boy, because when I was pregnant with Will, I carried very low.",
        "Donna: Yeah, but I think that's a myth. A boy low, girl hi-- or wait. Is it the other way around?",
        "Hope: You know what? Either way, I'm not even close to that stage yet, but you know what? Wyatt and I did feel a little flutter the other night.",
        "Pam: You did?",
        "Hope: Yes! And I don't know if it was, like, a kick or -- or what. I don't know. But it was -- it was pretty exciting.",
        "Maya: That is so sweet.",
        "Katie: Well, enjoy your pregnancy, because before you know it, two years will have gone by, and if it's a boy, watch out.",
        "Hope: Oh, man. Well, trust me, I'm savoring every moment.",
        "Aly: That is going to be one extremely cute baby.",
        "Hope: Yes, it is. [Laughter]",
        "Caroline: I'll tell you, Spencers make adorable children, I'm just saying.",
        "Ivy: Are you trying to tell us something?",
        "Hope: Am I gonna be an aunt? Please tell me I'm gonna be an aunt.",
        "Caroline: No, no, no.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: But, uh, I can't imagine that that's very far off.",
        "Maya: Well, it's Hope's day, so does anyone else want to guess?",
        "Pam: You know what? Why don't we eat? We have so much food. And you girls did such a good job helping with it.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "[Chatter]",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: There's knives, like, right there out in the open!",
        "Deacon: I like to cook. By the way, you hungry?",
        "Liam: What if she -- what if she loses it one night and decides to come after you? What then?",
        "Deacon: That would suck.",
        "Liam: \"That would suck.\" You're just -- so you're just not afraid of her at all?",
        "Deacon: Oh, no, she scares the hell out of me. It's part of her charm, though.",
        "Liam: Oh, wow.",
        "Deacon: Look, as long as she doesn't hurt anybody that I care about or my daughter, I'm not worried about Quinn.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you.",
        "Deacon: What makes you think I don't?",
        "Liam: Okay, you know that Hope doesn't want Quinn anywhere near her baby, right?",
        "Deacon: [Clears throat] Yeah, I know.",
        "Liam: And -- and you know that Hope's friends are throwing her a shower today.",
        "Deacon: Yep. I'm aware.",
        "Liam: To which Quinn was not invited. That's why I came over here, to make sure she doesn't show up.",
        "Deacon: I told her not to go.",
        "Liam: Okay, so you're saying it is possible that she went to that shower?",
        "Deacon: [Sighs] I'm saying that I honestly hope that she didn't. But you know what? That woman, she does whatever she wants, and I ain't stupid enough to try and control her.",
        "Liam: She better not be at that shower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: No, but wait. What are you trying to say? Do you think Pamela's not a good name?",
        "Hope: Uh...",
        "Pam: It's a wonderful name.",
        "Hope: Don't you worry. It is already on my list.",
        "Pam: Really, Hope? [Laughter] That's so mean!",
        "Caroline: What? Wait. What about boys' names?",
        "Ivy: Hey, I've -- I've always loved Dashiell.",
        "Hope: Oh, that's kind of -- that's interesting. I could call him Dash.",
        "Aly: Fancy. But I'm -- I'm kind of partial to Oliver.",
        "Hope: Oh, my -- could you imagine?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Maya: Wyatt Jr.",
        "Hope: Oh, Wyatt Jr. Little baby Wyatt.",
        "Donna: Or by the grandfather's name.",
        "Pam: Not Deacon.",
        "Donna: No, no, no, no, no. The other grandfather. Baby Dollar Bill.",
        "Katie: No. No. This world has plenty of Bill Spencers, thank you.",
        "Hope: Yeah, Donna, I'm so sorry, but that's a hard pass. I am not naming my future child Bill Spencer.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Ivy: Hey, but you are -- you are gonna find out the sex, right?",
        "Hope: Yeah, we are. I don't think I can wait much longer. I want to know. [Laughs]",
        "Pam: You know, speaking of waiting, I should wait 'cause we're about to do presents, but I just wanted to give you this.",
        "Hope: Aww.",
        "Pam: I've been working on this ever since I found out you got pregnant.",
        "Hope: Yeah?",
        "Pam: I hope you like it.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh! Look at this!",
        "Pam: It's gonna be a wise baby.",
        "Hope: Oh! Oh, my God. Did you make this?",
        "Pam: I did. I made it myself. The -- the crocheting of the owl took like ages.",
        "Hope: I love this.",
        "Aly: Oh, my God!",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Katie: Oh, my God.",
        "Pam: What are you doing here?",
        "Katie: How did you get in?",
        "Pam: You weren't invited.",
        "Quinn: I just wanted to be here. Share this experience with you.",
        "Donna: Have you been watching all this?",
        "Pam: Do you want me to call the police?",
        "Quinn: I won't cause any problems, I promise.",
        "Ivy: No, you won't, because you're leaving.",
        "Quinn: Hope, please stop shutting me out.",
        "Katie: Hope wanted you to stay away.",
        "Quinn: I can't. I needed to be a part of this. I'm appealing to you, Hope, one last time, from one mother to another. I didn't have any family when Wyatt was born. I raised him all by myself. I did the very best I could. And -- and I was a mother that Wyatt could be proud of. But I know I regressed, and I threatened Liam with a sword, I pushed Ivy in the -- in the river. But I have learned from all of that. I really have. I would never cause you or my grandchild any harm. I just want to love you both so much. Can any child have too much love? Please, Hope.",
        "Katie: Okay. That's enough. You need to leave.",
        "Hope: Wait. Stay. Mom."
