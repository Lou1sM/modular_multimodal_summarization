        "Steffy tells Ivy that she is busy and there are things she should be doing but Wyatt is her friend and she won't stand by while she is cheating on him. Ivy needs to tell Wyatt or she will. She admits what Steffy knows that she was alone in the house with Thomas. It was a mistake and will never happen again. She is not that kind of person; she does not cheat. In the end she agrees that she will tell Wyatt right now without Steffy being involved. Thomas plays coy and asks Wyatt if he is telling him to stay away from Ivy. Liam walks in and Thomas invites him to come in and make this a family affair. Wyatt repeats again that he needs to back off as Ivy is not available. They are practically living together so Thomas needs to go find another woman. Thomas makes a slam that he doesn't know what Ivy sees in Wyatt. Nowhere in there does Wyatt hear Thomas say he will back off and leave his girlfriend alone. Ivy walks in and is not happy to see them both together. Thomas leaves but says he was just telling Wyatt how lucky he was. Wyatt hopes he got through to him and they can now move on with their lives. Ivy admits she has a problem with Thomas. Bill and Katie continue their love fest in bed. She is glad to hear that he thinks his sons are getting their lives together. She won't go as far as saying Steffy is the right woman for Liam but she does want him to be happy. Liam goes back to Ridge's office and is sorry to hear that Steffy confronted Ivy about Thomas. He had asked her repeatedly to stay out of their business. She hopes he is not too mad at her; Ivy came in and it just tumbled out of her mouth. But she agrees with Liam, even though Ivy is untrustworthy, she needs to be the one to tell Wyatt the truth. So either Ivy tells Wyatt or she will.",
        "Wyatt listens as Ivy says she and Thomas have worked together and gotten closer especially after the falling light incident. Wyatt doesn't feel she needs to explain. He trusts her and doesn't want her to take the blame for what Thomas does. Thomas thinks everyone is interested in him but no more talking about him. They are going to have a special night .Indian food, a bottle of wine and the ocean. She reminds him they need this talk and Wyatt says they can continue over dinner. Liam responds to Ivy's text and goes to Wyatt's. He says he knows about Thomas. She explains that it didn't go very far but she has no excuse for that it went as far as it did. Liam assures her that Steffy is going to give her time to tell Wyatt herself. Ivy knows he will be shocked and hopes he will understand and she won't lose him. Wyatt takes some papers in to Steffy to sign. He mentions taking off for a special night with Ivy. Steffy mutters that she hopes Ivy appreciates all he does for her. And wonders if he knows Ivy as much as he thinks he does. He replies that Thomas can hit on Ivy all he wants to but he knows his girlfriend would not betray him. Steffy suggests that he talk to her anyway. When Wyatt pushes further, she stands up and says Ivy has been unfaithful and cheated on him with Thomas."

        "Ivy: This is none of your business, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Trust me -- I don't want to be involved. There's plenty of other things I'd rather be doing, but Wyatt is my friend, and I care about him.",
        "Ivy: Ugh! This is so typical of you to find something just to hold over me again.",
        "Steffy: Typical of me?! Ivy, you cheated on Wyatt! I overheard you talking to Thomas, and then Thomas confirmed it. My only question now is when are you gonna tell Wyatt? Because if you don't, I will.",
        "Thomas: So, you want me to stay away from Ivy. Is that what you're telling me?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Oh, look. It's a family affair. Come on in.",
        "Wyatt: Just stop flirting with Ivy. That's all I'm asking. Stop making moves on my girlfriend. Ivy's already told you she's not available, she's not interested in you, and she's my girlfriend. So back off.",
        "Bill: Do you hear that?",
        "Katie: Silence.",
        "Bill: He must be taking a little nap -- fell asleep.",
        "Katie: Ohh. You know he sleeps like a rock, just like his father.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Well, his father's not gonna be doing any sleeping right now.",
        "Katie: Oh, no?",
        "Bill: And you're not gonna get any, either -- sleep, I mean.",
        "Katie: I always thought sleep was overrated.",
        "Bill: This is what I needed -- a little one-on-one time with my wife.",
        "Katie: It's nice to spend some time -- quiet time -- alone.",
        "Bill: Not too quiet.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] It's got everything. It's got everything in here. Even the much-maligned \"the phantom mascara\" and \"jar jar blush.\" Of course, I'm a grown man. I would never wear this make-up, but Darth Vader would.",
        "Katie: I'm liking the new you.",
        "Bill: The extra hours I'm putting in at the gym? Is that what you mean?",
        "Katie: [Laughing] No.",
        "Bill: [Grunts]",
        "Katie: No, although your biceps are quite impressive. They re-- they are.",
        "Bill: All right. I'm a little sensitive.",
        "Katie: No. I've just -- I've noticed a difference lately, and it's nice.",
        "Bill: You know what? I've been spending way too much time worrying about Liam and Wyatt making the right decisions, finding the right woman. All the concerns -- they're just finally starting to disappear. I think my boys are -- I think they're getting their acts together.",
        "Katie: Good.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy is committed to me -- we're practically living together -- so why don't you just go find another woman -- someone who's single, someone who you might actually have a chance with? Because Ivy is off limits. She doesn't want anything to do with you.",
        "Liam: Well, I think you've made your point, Wyatt. I mean, nobody wants to think that their relationship is being threatened. It's not a very nice feeling. And I'm sure Thomas would agree.",
        "Thomas: Look, I'm not trying to cause problems between you and me, but I just don't get what Ivy sees in you. I get what you see in her. She's a smart, beautiful, sophisticated woman. I hope you know how lucky you are.",
        "Steffy: Just admit it, Ivy. You and Thomas were alone at my grandfather's house. Wyatt was in san Francisco. Thomas went into your bedroom, and one thing led to another.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, nothing happened.",
        "Steffy: But you guys made out, and you didn't seem to push him away.",
        "Ivy: It was a mistake, Steffy. I've told Thomas it will never happen again.",
        "Steffy: I hope you mean that. But you can't erase the past.",
        "Ivy: If I could take all of this back, I would, but I can't.",
        "Steffy: Ivy, I know you feel bad about this. But Wyatt is your boyfriend. You should tell him the truth. He deserves to know.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, this isn't the sort of person I am. I don't cheat. I can't even believe I've betrayed Wyatt. I can't believe I'm in this position.",
        "Steffy: Ivy, we all have regrets. We make mistakes, bad decisions. I'm not trying to attack you, and I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I'm just standing up for Wyatt... because he has no idea what's going on behind his back, and if I were him, I would want to know. Wouldn't you? See? It's only fair.",
        "Ivy: I know that, and I know that you probably don't believe this, but I am committed to Wyatt and he is the man I want to be with.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Then why did you kiss my brother?",
        "Ivy: Ugh! I don't know! I don't know. It's just -- there's just something about Thomas, you know? I got -- I got caught up in moments with him. But that doesn't change my feelings for Wyatt and how deeply I care for him.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt trusts you. You were unfaithful.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, I feel awful.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt's been honest with you. You need to be honest with him. Tell him.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I will -- right now.",
        "Steffy: Really?",
        "Ivy: Yes. I'm gonna do it -- not you. He's my boyfriend, this is my relationship, and you need to let me do this by myself.",
        "Bill: So, are you finally willing to admit that Steffy's the right woman for Liam?",
        "Katie: Ohh, and we were having such a nice time.",
        "Bill: Listen, I know you have your reservations.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. You know what? I'm done with all that. Liam loves her, and that's all that matters.",
        "Bill: Well, in that case, what do you think about them getting married right here on our grounds?",
        "Katie: I think that they should get married whenever and wherever they want to.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] My boy. Before you know it, he's gonna be a married man.",
        "Liam: Hey. Did you get those comps I sent you?",
        "Steffy: No. No, but I, uh -- I did something else.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Steffy: Okay, just remember that you love me and you just proposed to me.",
        "Liam: Should I be sitting down for this?",
        "Steffy: I tried not to say anything, okay? I really, really did.",
        "Liam: What did you do?",
        "Steffy: You know how you told me to stay out of Ivy and Wyatt's business?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Well, after you left the office, Ivy came in the room, and then she --",
        "Liam: Oh, no. No. Steffy, you didn't tell her you know about Thomas? Ohh.",
        "Wyatt: I'm kind of getting the feeling that you're not taking me very seriously here. Um, in fact, I still haven't heard you say that you're gonna drop this whole thing and stop this stupid game of pursuing my girlfriend.",
        "Thomas: Hmm? Are we still talking about this?",
        "Wyatt: Ha. My thoughts exactly. I think this is getting old, don't you? Ivy's not interested in you. Don't you think it's time to give it a rest?",
        "Thomas: You know what?",
        "Ivy: You're both still in here.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: Yeah. I was just telling Wyatt how lucky he is to have you. If you'll excuse me...",
        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Hopefully, I got through to him and then we can all just move on with our lives, you know? What? What is it?",
        "Ivy: It's Thomas.",
        "Bill: You know, if you really think about it, Liam has had a pretty rough road. The way his marriage ended to Steffy was pretty tragic. All the drama with miss goody two shoes...",
        "Katie: Okay, I know you're not talking about my niece.",
        "Bill: Katie, uh, you got to admit, I mean, hope put Liam and Wyatt through the wringer.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Okay. They've both been through a lot, sure -- especially Liam.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm glad for him. I'm glad he's finally settling down. He deserves some happiness -- some happiness... like this.",
        "Katie: Mm.",
        "Bill: I just hope that he is half as happy as I am.",
        "Katie: You really mean that, don't you?",
        "Bill: I do.",
        "Steffy: You're not mad, are you?",
        "Liam: Well [Scoffs] I thought we agreed you weren't gonna get involved.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. I wasn't planning on it. I was gonna keep my mouth shut. And then Ivy came in to the room, and then I just blurted it out.",
        "Liam: Oh, what -- what did you say specifically?",
        "Steffy: I told her that I got a vibe form them at thanksgiving and that I overheard her talking to Thomas. It's not like I attacked her. I actually handled it pretty graciously.",
        "Liam: Okay, okay, but what is the point of letting her know that you know about Thomas? It's none of our business, Steffy! It's not our place.",
        "Steffy: I was looking out for your brother! Wyatt needs to know what Ivy's been up to.",
        "Liam: Fine. What did -- what did she say when you confronted her?",
        "Steffy: Well, she denied it at first, and then she realized she couldn't -- that Thomas confirmed everything was true. So I told her to tell Wyatt and if she didn't, then... I would.",
        "Liam: Oh, my god, Steffy!",
        "Steffy: She never would have confessed! She needed a little pressure! And I'm happy that I did it because she promised she'd tell Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Okay. All right. Great. That's done. What time is the meeting with the south Africans?",
        "Steffy: Even though she's completely untrustworthy. I highly doubt she'll go through with it.",
        "Liam: Steffy! You got to let this go. You have to let Ivy be the one to tell Wyatt. Promise me. I'm serious.",
        "Wyatt: What about Thomas?",
        "Ivy: Well, it's just we've gotten a lot closer lately. Um... I think when the light fell, it really bonded us, and we've also been working very closely on the line together, so I think that that's why there's some, uh -- some --",
        "Wyatt: Okay. [Laughing] Ivy, look -- you don't need to explain. I get it. We all know that Thomas has been sniffing around, and I can't blame him. I mean, look at you! You're gorgeous, you're gifted, you're talented, you're smart.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Like the way you are with me -- just so trusting and loving -- I have never felt that in any other relationship ever. So don't do that. Don't take the blame for what Thomas is doing right now. Just a second ago, I told him -- and I made it very clear -- that you are in a serious relationship.",
        "Ivy: Look, it's not all Thomas' fault, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy, it's Thomas' problem for misreading you. He's so used to the models just drooling over him that he just assumes that everybody's interested in him. But let's just stop talking about Thomas, okay? No more talking about Thomas, especially not today.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, I just --",
        "Wyatt: Why, do you ask?",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: Because it's a special day, okay? I was just thinking we'd get some food from our favorite Indian place, little bottle of wine, maybe, you know, jump in the ocean. Hmm?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I mean... sounds great, but we really -- we really have to talk.",
        "Wyatt: Then, yeah, let's talk over dinner.",
        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Yeah. You're such a wonderful, kind man. I really hope you know how much I appreciate you. I'm so happy with you.",
        "Wyatt: I kind of have an idea. [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: We should definitely do this more often. I know I haven't had a chance to tell you, but I really appreciate what you said at thanksgiving. It was so wonderful to be there, surrounded by all that love and warmth. It's amazing I didn't start crying into my mashed potatoes.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: I love you. You always make me feel appreciated and valued, and... I can't thank you enough for that.",
        "Bill: I love you, too. And this new, improved version that you like so much --",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm?",
        "Bill: It's just a by-product of having such a phenomenal wife.",
        "Katie: I am so happy we're here... in each other's arms, with our beautiful boy asleep down the hall.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: It doesn't get any better than this.",
        "Bill: No, it doesn't.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Ivy: Thanks for coming.",
        "Liam: Sure. I was, uh... surprised, to say the least, to get your text.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Well, I wouldn't have texted you if it wasn't very important.",
        "Liam: Everything all right?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Look, it's, um -- it's about your brother and Thomas. Something happened between Thomas and I.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Steffy told me.",
        "Ivy: Great. Look, it didn't go very far. You know, we didn't sleep --",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. But... regardless...",
        "Ivy: I don't even have a reason. There's not even an excuse for what I did.",
        "Liam: Does Wyatt know?",
        "Ivy: No. I'm telling him tonight. He's planned this amazing evening for us, and he has no idea the bomb I'm about to drop on our relationship.",
        "Liam: Oof. I was [Chuckles] I was just with him. He was reading Thomas the riot act for flirting with you.",
        "Ivy: Great. Great. Can't wait to tell him it went beyond flirting.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I imagine he'll be pretty shocked.",
        "Ivy: Am I doing the right thing by telling him? I mean, Steffy said if I don't say anything, then she's gonna tell him.",
        "Liam: She's not gonna say anything. I asked her not to.",
        "Steffy: Thank you. I mean, Steffy does have a point. I-if we're ever gonna get past this, I just have to put it all out there. Can't keep secrets from Wyatt. I just have to hope he can forgive me, I guess. Look, Liam, I-I asked you over here because you're his brother and I really need to know. Am I gonna lose him?",
        "Wyatt: Have you seen her tablet in here?",
        "Steffy: Hold on. Wait. Isn't -- isn't that private?",
        "Wyatt: Ivy and I don't keep things from each other.",
        "Wyatt: Hey. Uh... [Clears throat] So, I'm just placing the orders with the suppliers. I didn't know if you wanted to check -- take a look at these before I send them.",
        "Steffy: No, it's good. I'm sure it's fine.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. Okay. That was...easy -- almost too easy. What's up with you?",
        "Steffy: No, nothing. I'm just -- I'm just, uh, busy. That's all.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Well, I'm gonna take off early. Tonight's kind of a special night for Ivy and me.",
        "Steffy: I hope Ivy appreciates everything you do for her. Sometimes I wonder if you know your girlfriend as well as you think you do.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I thought everything was all good with you and Ivy. You guys talked and now you agreed to try and be nice to each other.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. I thought so, too, but... I guess I still have issues with her.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Well, whatever it is, like, don't get all caught up in it. It's not healthy. It's not worth it.",
        "Steffy: You're looking out for me?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, you know, I guess so.",
        "Steffy: I'm trying to look out for you, too.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. How so?",
        "Steffy: Just in general, I guess.",
        "Wyatt: This is about your brother, isn't it? Look... I know your brother is the resident playboy here. I also know that he's been hitting on Ivy. But that doesn't matter to me, because she's loyal to me. And I find it very cute that you're concerned about me -- I really do -- but it's not necessary. And as much as I want him to stop doing that, he can hit on Ivy as much as he wants, because she's just gonna shut him down.",
        "Steffy: What makes you so sure about that?",
        "Wyatt: Because she's not that kind of person -- that she'd cross a line and betray me. She has too much respect for herself and for me. Despite what you think, she's -- she's great, okay? She wouldn't jeopardize what we have together.",
        "Steffy: Then maybe you should talk to her.",
        "Wyatt: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Steffy: I just think you should talk to your girlfriend.",
        "Wyatt: Steffy, what are you implying here?",
        "Steffy: Ivy promised she would tell you.",
        "Wyatt: Tell me what?",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, I admire you, and I hate seeing you being treated this way.",
        "Wyatt: What way?! Steffy, tell me! Whatever you think you know, just tell me!",
        "Steffy: It's about -- it's about Ivy and my brother. She's been unfaithful. Ivy cheated on you with Thomas."
