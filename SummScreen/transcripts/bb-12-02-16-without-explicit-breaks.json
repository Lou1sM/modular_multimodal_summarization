        "Quinn tells Eric this is her favorite time \u0096 those small, quiet moments they have together. He says no moment with her is small. She asks if it is not time for him to go back to work. He is not sure he wants to; he likes this peace and quiet. Wyatt walks in and says he cannot compete with them but he also cannot keep thinking about her. Quinn says she is sorry and wishes there was something she could do. Quinn tells Eric that he did nothing wrong but Steffy left Wyatt anyway. She has to do something. Eric says he likes Wyatt too so if there is anything he can do, do not be quiet. Meanwhile Steffy and Liam are cuddled in each other's arms on the couch exchanging passionate kisses. Before she leaves Bill ..a sullen Bill walks in and tells them that Brooke has gone back to Forrester. Ridge and Brooke go over the significance of Bridge and now they are on that bridge that is destiny. Steffy tells Bill that for whatever it is worth, she believes Brooke does love him. Bill says yes but Ridge and RJ just got in her head with the guilt. Liam says he will offer scotch and not a pep talk. He tells Bill that he knew Steffy was the one and he never gave up and neither should Bill. RJ welcomes Brooke back with a hug and she says she is back. Ridge adds they are back. RJ tells his mom that she made the right choice. Now they are a real family again .group hug. Ridge tells Brooke later that when he came back from Paris his first thought was to get back with Brooke but it just was not their time. Now is their time.",
        "Wyatt gives Eric Quinn's special ugly glass of special nutriments. He mentions Steffy and that Quinn wants her to be the CEO and Eric says he could be too if he wants it. While Quinn is alone Steffy stops by to see Eric but Quinn stops her and wants to talk to her first. She says she and Eric were talking and he is talking about not coming back to work as he is happy with his life right now. Steffy guesses that she is angling for herself to be CEO. Quinn replies no, she had Steffy in mind. Eric tells Wyatt not to give up on Steffy, he has to fight for her even over his brother Liam. He has nothing to lose. Bill asks about Liam and Steffy and says just because his relationship did not work out does not mean he is not interested in Liam's. Liam says nothing will stop them this time. They just need to get the divorce from Wyatt. Steffy feels like this is just a ploy of Quinn's to put Eric off track so that she can get control of the company. Quinn says no, Steffy is qualified and was once just a heartbeat away from being CEO when she was President. She is more than qualified. She does not think Eric will disagree with her. And all together they could take this company way into the future. This can all happen. Forrester needs new blood at the top if Eric does not come back and that is Steffy."

        "Quinn: Small, quiet moments",
        "Liam: You taste like the ocean.",
        "Quinn: This is my favorite thing about us.",
        "Eric: What's that?",
        "Quinn: Small, quiet moments that we make.",
        "Eric: No moment with you is small.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: Each one is vastly significant.",
        "Quinn: [Giggles]",
        "Eric: You make me very happy. I'm happier than I've ever been in my life.",
        "Quinn: Well, I am so glad because I feel the exact same way about you. You have given me so much, including control of your company against your family's wishes. Oh!",
        "Eric: Well, I trust you. You're the only one I do trust.",
        "Quinn: Ohh. And I love that. But don't you think it's time?",
        "Eric: I absolutely do. Come on.",
        "Quinn: No! Not that. I mean, don't you think it's time for you to go back to work?",
        "Eric: I'm not sure I want to.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Eric: You know, I like this. I like being away from all the drama and all the pressure. It's nice. You know, we'll talk about it.",
        "Quinn: Hi, sweetheart. It's really good to see you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I live here, remember?",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, you've been keeping to yourself lately.",
        "Eric: Something on your mind? Someone on your mind?",
        "Wyatt: It's just -- I can't compete with how happy you two are. And I... I can't stop thinking about her.",
        "Ridge: You're not wearing his ring, so you and Spencer -- it's over. You're home. You're finally home.",
        "Quinn: I'm so sorry, honey. I wish there was something I can do. I mean, you probably think that I've done enough already, because if it wasn't for me, you and Steffy would still be together.",
        "Wyatt: What's done is done, right? She's with Liam, and... life goes on somehow. But I'll tell you what does make me smile... how happy you two are. All domesticated and at peace. Ugh. I'm happy for you guys. And I'm hungry. So I'm gonna go raid the fridge.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] [Sighs]",
        "Eric: You worried about him?",
        "Quinn: I can't help it. He didn't do anything wrong, and Steffy left him anyway. You know? And I can see that he's hurting. I want to do something for my son.",
        "Liam: Where you going, hmm?",
        "Steffy: Mmm. I was gonna go see my granddad. I won't be long.",
        "Liam: Is this about Quinn?",
        "Steffy: After boycotting the wedding, I'm just happy I was able to give my granddad, like, a peaceful, nice holiday. But my feelings for her, they have not changed.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Liam: Oh. Gee, Dad, please, come on in. What can I get you? Cookies? Coffee? What -- what's wrong? Are you okay?",
        "Bill: Brooke's going back to Forrester.",
        "Ridge: So... hi.",
        "Brooke: Hi.",
        "Ridge: I was talking to R.J. earlier about -- about the significance of \"bridge.\"",
        "Brooke: Our combined names.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, and I told him how that's a connection between us, and -- and, anyway, I just had to leave the office. I was walking, I was thinking about you and thinking about Bill and...I ended up here on -- on this -- on this bridge, and... I don't know. What do you call that?",
        "Brooke: You know what I call that.",
        "Ridge: That's destiny.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt gave Steffy his whole heart. I know how much he's hurting.",
        "Eric: Well, if there's anything I can do, you have to let me know. He means a great deal to me, too.",
        "Quinn: Well, if I think of anything, I won't be shy.",
        "Wyatt: Have you ever been a day in your life? Ooh, good pie.",
        "Quinn: You would be surprised.",
        "Eric: I will, uh, leave you two alone for a while. I'll go upstairs.",
        "Wyatt: Better grab some rest while you can. It'll be a fond memory once you get back at Forrester.",
        "Eric: I'm not sure I'm gonna do that. I'm enjoying my life here a little too much. You know where to find me.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Did he really mean that? He's not gonna take the reins back at Forrester?",
        "Quinn: That's what he says.",
        "Wyatt: But if he's not C.E.O., then who is? Ridge?",
        "Quinn: Oh, no, I doubt it. Not after the way he betrayed Eric.",
        "Wyatt: Well, then, rick? Who?",
        "Quinn: No, no, no. Not rick. Steffy.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I guess I do question everything now.",
        "Liam: Well, don't do that. Don't minimize what you guys had. Hey, sometimes things don't work out despite everybody in the situation wanting them to.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, for what it's worth, I believe she loves you.",
        "Bill: I know she does. I guess not -- not as much Ridge/family and \"doing what's best for the children,\" as she said.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I mean... Ridge and R.J., they just... got in her head with the guilt.",
        "Liam: All right, well... I -- what can I do?",
        "Bill: Scotch.",
        "Liam: How about a pep talk? Scotch.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I feel like I'm caught in a whirlwind.",
        "Ridge: But we're here. Together. The way it was always supposed to be. Are you okay?",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: I know that can't have been easy. But we're here now. Got to focus on our family and the future. So tell me you're here with me in this moment.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Yes. Yes, I am. I am here with you in this moment.",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Brooke: I'm back! [Laughs]",
        "R.J.: Mom...",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: We're back.",
        "Wyatt: So you're suggesting Steffy take over C.E.O. if Eric doesn't come back?",
        "Quinn: She's more than qualified, and bonus round -- you'd get to see her more.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Why is that a bonus?",
        "Quinn: I'm your mother. I can still read you, and I can see that you still love her.",
        "Wyatt: Come on, Mom! The divorce is a go. Steffy's already in the process of removing her ring tattoo.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I know. Look, it kills me. I'm -- I'm so happy with Eric, but our happiness is built on your broken marriage.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, I don't blame you for taking your shot. Not anymore. Not after realizing how good you two are together.",
        "Quinn: In addition to you, Eric is the most wonderful thing that's ever happened to me. And I want that for you so much, Wyatt, and -- and it can happen. It's just -- you know, your marriage doesn't have to be over. Couples go through difficult times and they work through them.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, it's a little too late for that, Mom. She's already back with Liam.",
        "Quinn: So what? Doesn't mean you have to give up on her, so don't! Don't give up on Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Liam: I don't know what to say, Dad. I mean... yeah, I know about Ridge and Brooke's legendary connection, but I've also seen your connection with Brooke, and... I thought she was all in.",
        "Bill: She was all in. Brooke loves me. That doesn't just disappear.",
        "Liam: Wow, she really did a number on you. Listen, can I give you some advice?",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Liam: Don't give up. When I was in your shoes, I didn't. I couldn't. I mean, I knew Steffy was the one, and I wasn't gonna let her go no matter what. And neither should you.",
        "Bill: You're right. Forrester got in her head. I underestimated him. And he's underestimating me if he thinks I'm gonna go away.",
        "R.J.: I can't believe it. You know what? No. No, I can believe it. You know why? 'Cause you two are meant to be together. You just forgot that for a while. Mom, you made the right choice. For me, for Dad, for this family. God, I love you so much.",
        "Brooke: Oh, honey, I love you, too.",
        "R.J.: We're a real family again.",
        "Ridge: I like this day.",
        "Brooke: It's a good one.",
        "Ridge: One more hug. Come on.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Another hug.",
        "Wyatt: What is this?",
        "Eric: Oh, this is your mother's special blend. It's full of, uh...nutrients. All different things. Something.",
        "Wyatt: It looks awful.",
        "Eric: Yes. I don't ask.",
        "Wyatt: Smart. Hey, did you, uh -- did you mean what you said earlier about not returning to Forrester as C.E.O.?",
        "Eric: Yeah. You want the job? Take it.",
        "Wyatt: Is that a yes?",
        "Eric: Yes. It is.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Quinn: Oh, hey. Steffy! What a surprise!",
        "Steffy: Quinn. Hey.",
        "Quinn: Uh, so, your grandfather and I were just talking about thanksgiving and how wonderful it was to have the whole family gathered here, so thank you, again.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I was doing that for my grandfather. My feelings for you haven't changed.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Yeah, I know. It really saddens me that you are incapable of seeing that I have changed.",
        "Steffy: Can we not do this? Just tell my granddad to call me, all right?",
        "Quinn: Okay, but wait, Steffy, there's something that I would love to talk to you about.",
        "Steffy: What, that you're a better person? How good you are with my grandfather? I mean, I've heard it all and I don't believe it.",
        "Quinn: No. Steffy. This is not about me. This is about you and your future in Forrester. You know, being in charge over there was an amazing experience for me.",
        "Steffy: What's your point?",
        "Quinn: Eric and I were talking about who would eventually run the company. My position there was always meant to be temporary.",
        "Steffy: Well, I'm glad you realize that, that you'll be out of the C.E.O. Chair once my grandfather comes back.",
        "Quinn: Well, see, that's the thing. Um... Eric's talking about maybe not coming back.",
        "Steffy: I don't understand.",
        "Quinn: Well, he's been through a lot, and he's really happy with the way his life is right now.",
        "Steffy: Oh, I get it. I see where this is going. You're angling to become permanent C.E.O.",
        "Quinn: Uh, no. No, no, no. There's somebody else that I intend to push for.",
        "Steffy: All right. Who?",
        "Quinn: You.",
        "Ridge: Hey. It's all about timing, isn't it?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: When I first came back from Paris, my instinct was to find you. Be with you. But it wasn't our time. This is our time. Time to put our family back together.",
        "Brooke: And I want that. More than anything.",
        "Eric: I feel for you, Wyatt. I know what it's like to lose the woman you love. But if death doesn't take her, then, uh, there's still a chance. Don't give up on Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, that's exactly what my mother says.",
        "Eric: Well, you should listen to her. She's a wise woman.",
        "Wyatt: There's just one small problem, Eric. Steffy went back to Liam.",
        "Eric: Liam. Yes. I like Liam. I have a lot of respect for him. But my advice to you -- you got to fight for Steffy, all right? I mean, if your mother and I hadn't fought for what we wanted, we wouldn't be enjoying this wonderful life right now.",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Eric: So the odds are against you. That just means you have nothing to lose.",
        "Bill: All right, enough about Brooke and me. How are things going with you and Steffy?",
        "Liam: Uh...that's kind of awkward to talk about, considering what you're going through, don't you think?",
        "Bill: No, I don't. Life doesn't stop, Liam, just because my relationship is over...for now. Doesn't mean I don't want to know how yours is going.",
        "Liam: Okay, um, it's fantastic. Steffy and I are closer than ever. And, um... and then there's Wyatt, who's kind of the sacrificial lamb in this whole thing, and I feel really bad about that. But, I mean, once their divorce is final, Steffy and I can get married, and... I am telling you, nothing will stop us this time.",
        "Steffy: You think I should run Forrester.",
        "Quinn: Who better? You're more than qualified. You've been groomed to take over, and you were a heartbeat away from C.E.O. When you were president.",
        "Steffy: Until you unseated me.",
        "Quinn: I may have acted hastily, but that is a mistake that is easily rectified.",
        "Steffy: If my grandfather steps down, my father was the prior C.E.O.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, that's not going to happen. He's betrayed Eric one too many times.",
        "Steffy: And I haven't?",
        "Quinn: Well, no. Not to the same extent. One can argue that Ridge swept you up in things that you would have thought twice about.",
        "Steffy: Okay. You're trying to put a wedge between my dad and me?",
        "Quinn: I am trying to make a plan for the future that's beneficial to the company and won't rip the family apart.",
        "Steffy: This is just a ploy to get me off track so you can get in my grandfather's ear about running the company yourself.",
        "Quinn: Why would you assume that I want to?",
        "Steffy: You're saying you don't?",
        "Quinn: You know, Eric put so much faith in me -- you know, putting his legacy into my hands -- and I swore to him that I wouldn't betray that trust, and I haven't. The fashion show, the re-launch of the jewelry line, adding the accessories. I am so proud of all of that. But the person who's going to take over as C.E.O. of Forrester needs to have been born a Forrester. They need to be smart and strong and confident. They need to inspire trust and loyalty and... you fit all of that criteria.",
        "Steffy: Have you talked to my grandfather about this?",
        "Quinn: No. Not yet. I wanted to run it by you first. But I'm not worried about Eric. He and I have been in sync lately, and I don't think he's gonna disagree with me. Look, I know that you and Ridge were trying to get Bill's shares so that you can take over the company. Well, you're not gonna need to do that anymore. Not if you'd be willing to work with me and Eric.",
        "Steffy: Partner with you?",
        "Quinn: And Eric. And then we, together, can take the company and the family into the future, kicking and screaming, if need be. Come on, Steffy. We would be such a formidable team, if you could just let go of your animosity towards me and realize that I'm not the same person I used to be. I am still your mother-in-law. I love you. I would love to be close with you. And I want your grandfather and you to be closer than ever, and it can happen. If Eric decides not to go back to being C.E.O., then... Forrester's gonna need a makeover. New blood at the top. And that's you."
