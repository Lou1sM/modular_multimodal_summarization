        "Hope hugs Quinn and calls her mom. Liam continues to tell Deacon that Quinn crashing the shower is a very bad idea. And if Deacon knew about it he is the one that needs to head her off. Deacon counters with that Liam knows Quinn and no one tells her what to do. He says they have a relationship and the way it works is he does his thing and Quinn does her thing. Liam can't understand how he can be with a woman like that who has hurt his daughter so many times. She is not a minor irritation. She is a full blown sociopath who does not care about the damage she inflicts emotionally or physically. She needs to be locked up or at the very least put on meds. Deacon laments that he does not condone what she does but she's had it rough raising her son and had to fight back and sometimes she fights dirty. Liam warns that Deacon can not trust her; she will turn on him too. Deacon says he knows, but he is a man with wants, needs and desires and meantime Quinn checks those boxes. And maybe he can actually broker peace between Quinn and Hope. Liam tells him that is a fantasy of his but he has to move out of here as Hope will never accept Quinn. Quinn is happy for a moment as Hope lets her feel her tummy. The gals welcome her into the family. Then Quinn is jarred back to reality by hearing them all laughing when opening up the presents for the baby. Deacon tells Liam that he realizes he has had several bad experiences with Quinn but he is telling him that people can change with a strong enough motivation and he can't help but think being a grandmother might qualify. She just wants to be loved like anyone else. She gets hurt, she is outraged and that is when the crazy kicks in but that wouldn't happen if people accepted her in the beginning. Liam says it is admirable that he is willing to give her more chances but the rest of them can not. The more he thinks about it the more he thinks crashing the shower is what Quinn would do. He calls Ivy who assures him all is okay. Deacon asks about Ivy. Liam says here's the deal. Hope will always be very special to him. They tried to make it work and it didn't. But feelings do not just die and his first instinct will always be to protect her. Ivy understands and that is what is so great about her. She doesn't push or hurry him along. He is lucky to have her. And he is not settling for Ivy. They have built a relationship and they are committed. Deacon says he is a damn good man and he would have been proud to have him as a son-in-law. He is sorry that didn't work out. Deacon says he has errands to run and asks Liam to please try to cut Quinn some slack. She is really trying.",
        "When the party guests are on the patio playing games, Quinn sneaks down and admires all the gifts, holds some baby clothes up to her face and then she slices a huge hunk of cake for two before slipping out the door. Ivy tells Hope about Liam calling and that she doesn't mind. Anyone who wants a relationship with Liam has to know it will always include Hope. Quinn returns home to find Liam and asks why he is there. He starts in on her being with Deacon. She says that is none of his business. He wants to know where she has been. She says just out. He spies the cake and says he knows she crashed the shower despite her story about going to a bakery. He says he is so sick of her. She says he is crazy but she is just misunderstood. He says she has manipulated him and Hope over and over and yet she is relentless and keeps on coming and coming. He says he warned Hope many times what she would be getting into with Wyatt and now she is married and pregnant and all because of what Quinn managed to do in Paris. Quinn says he is still whining about that. It's time to move on. He says he knows that is what she would like him to do so she can keep on terrorizing Hope, but his eyes are fixed on Quinn and as long as he is breathing he will protect Hope from her."

        "Quinn: Say it again, Hope.",
        "Hope: Mom. [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: And your child's...",
        "Hope: Grandmother. [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Quinn crashing Hope's party -- very bad idea, which is why if she went over there, deacon, you -- you need to be the one to head her off.",
        "Deacon: Have you met Quinn? Nobody tells that woman to do anything.",
        "Liam: I understand, but you have some new influence, right?",
        "Deacon: Okay, look, yeah, we -- we've got a relationship, but, I mean, the reason it works, you know, Quinn does her thing, I do my thing. Look, I don't think you need to sweat this, all right? I really, honestly don't think she went over to the shower.",
        "Liam: Oh, really? 'Cause it sounds like classic Quinn to me -- barging in where she's not wanted, no regard for Hope's wishes.",
        "Deacon: Okay, look, I told her to back off, all right? I said, just, you know, \"you know, give it some time. Let Hope come around.\" I told her that.",
        "Liam: That is not gonna happen.",
        "Deacon: Come on, Liam. You don't know that. I mean, Hope is a forgiving, compassionate woman, right? She's married to Quinn's son. He's got to miss his mom.",
        "Liam: That's not -- Quinn has done things that can't be forgiven, deacon, which is why I don't understand how you can be with a woman like that, a woman who's hurt your daughter so many times.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: I know you weren't there for most of it. You kind of missed out on all the fun. But Quinn is not some minor irritation, deacon. She's a full-blown sociopath and she doesn't care about the damage she inflicts emotionally or physically. She needs to be locked up, or at the very least heavily medicated, and you -- you knowing everything she's put Hope through, how can you be with someone like that? I don't condone her methods, all right? I don't even condone the lengths that she goes to. But I understand it, and I'll tell you why. She is a single mother and she has had to fight for every single thing that she has, Liam, and you know what? Sometimes she fights dirty.",
        "Liam: She'll turn on you, too. You know that. You can't trust her.",
        "Deacon: Well, you may be right there, my boy, but I'll tell you something. In the meantime, I'm a man with wants and needs and desires, and between you and me... Quinn checks the boxes.",
        "Liam: Oh. Oh.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Okay, so, what? So Hope's needs don't matter?",
        "Deacon: Of course they matter. I adore my daughter. Think of it this way, okay? I may just be in a unique position to run interference. You know, maybe I can actually broker peace between Quinn and Hope.",
        "Liam: No, that right there -- that's a fantasy that you're selling yourself. If you value your relationship with Hope, you got to move out of here. You got to cut off ties with Quinn, because, deacon, I promise you, Hope will never accept her.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] I'm gonna be a grandma.",
        "Hope: Yes, you are.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Hope: Come here. I c-- I can't wait to see your face when you hold your grandchild for the first time. And are -- are you gonna be there for the delivery?",
        "Quinn: Before, during, after -- whenever you want me.",
        "Hope: Yeah?",
        "Katie: Well, I guess... welcome to the family.",
        "Donna: Congratulations.",
        "Pam: The power of forgiveness.",
        "Ivy: Well, I guess your days of snooping on the stairs are over.",
        "Aly: Welcome, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. May I?",
        "Hope: Yeah, of course.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Hope: It's a common thing. Everyone knows that, right?",
        "Donna: Of course.",
        "Hope: Everybody knows that.",
        "Katie: I can't wait to meet that baby.",
        "Hope: I know! Me too. And Wyatt -- I have to peel him off the ceiling.",
        "Katie: That's awesome.",
        "Donna: You guys are gonna be such amazing parents.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Donna: This is one lucky boy. Or girl.",
        "Hope: Or a girl. I know. You know what, guys? I have thought about being a mom my whole life.",
        "Katie: It's the best experience you'll ever have.",
        "Donna: You are having a baby!",
        "Katie: You are!",
        "Hope: I am! I know!",
        "Katie: Oh, my gosh!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Aly: So...wild guess. You're thinking about Liam?",
        "Ivy: Uh... yeah. You caught me.",
        "Aly: Yeah, I recognize the look.",
        "Ivy: Oh, yeah? And what look is that? All sappy and silly?",
        "Aly: I wear it from time to time when I think about Oliver. [Chuckles] You happy?",
        "Ivy: My mind has just been blown, you know? I can't believe Liam actually said he loves me.",
        "Aly: It's still sinking in, huh?",
        "Ivy: I mean, it's everything I could ever have wanted, but I just -- I didn't expect it to happen so soon.",
        "Aly: Well, it makes sense to me. You've been solid for Liam. And plus you're pretty terrific, so what's not to love? [Chuckles]",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Aly: You're not feeling insecure, are you?",
        "Ivy: No, I -- [Sighs] Even though Liam and I might be together, I still have to come to terms with the fact that... he'll always have feelings for Hope.",
        "Pam: Okay, ladies! Let's gather! After all, baby showers are not about fabulous finger food and mimosas, they're also about presents!",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Pam: So, come on, mommy. Sit. Sit, sit.",
        "Hope: Don't worry. I'm just drinking orange juice, I swear.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Hope: Oh, my gosh! You guys! Look at all of this!",
        "Aly: And don't even say we shouldn't have.",
        "Ivy: Yes, you have to open it.",
        "Katie: Okay, well, we're gonna go first, because we couldn't wrap it, so you have to close your eyes.",
        "Hope: Okay. They're closed.",
        "Katie: Keep them closed.",
        "Hope: I can't promise anything.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "[All gasp]",
        "Katie: Everyone's -- okay, open your eyes. Open your eyes.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God! You guys! This is amazing. And it's beautiful! I love it. Thank you so much. Oh, my God! These are so cute!",
        "Ivy: I actually -- I made that. Well, I didn't make the booties, but all the little gems are hand placed.",
        "Hope: Are they real?",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Hope: Okay, who is this one from?",
        "Caroline: That's me, that's me.",
        "Hope: That's Caroline. This is huge!",
        "Caroline: Thank you!",
        "Hope: This is crazy. Okay, I'm just gonna rip this.",
        "Caroline: Just get into it.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Caroline: Look, I've got my baby cousin when it comes to wardrobes, okay?",
        "Hope: Look at this! Aah!",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Deacon: I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. I'm trying something new. It's optimism over pessimism. It's kind of like -- what do they call it? Like a social experiment? I'm trying to see if perspective and state of mind can affect the outcome of events.",
        "Liam: Hope is never opening her door to Quinn again. She's too dangerous. Sorry.",
        "Deacon: Not to her grandkid.",
        "Liam: Well, I guess we'll never know, will we, because Quinn's not getting anywhere near that kid.",
        "Deacon: Liam, with all due respect, that's not your call.",
        "Liam: I know. I know. It's Hope's, and she already made it.",
        "Deacon: Listen. I get that you've had some really unfortunate experiences with Quinn. And I also understand that you don't think she's capable of change, but I'm here to tell you people can change. They can. You know, if they've got a strong enough reason and motivation, and I got to believe being involved in her grandkid's life qualifies.",
        "Liam: Well, maybe she should have thought of that before she started trotting the globe terrorizing people.",
        "Deacon: Oh, come on, man. She's just like everybody else. She just wants to be loved, you know? And she gets hurt when that doesn't happen, and then that turns into outrage. That's, you know, when the crazy kicks in. But it wouldn't happen if people accepted her in the beginning.",
        "Liam: That's an interesting theory. How does that account for her locking me in the steam room and coming after me with a sword and pushing Ivy into the seine?",
        "Deacon: Bad impulse control?",
        "Liam: Oh, come on. Listen, okay, all right, I'm sure it's commendable that you're going to such great pains to understand a raging psychopath. I really do. But for the rest of us, Quinn has more than earned our mistrust, deacon, and -- in fact, the more that I think about it, crashing Hope's party is exactly what Quinn would do. I got to check in.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Aly: These eggs are amazing. They're so delicious.",
        "Ivy: Hey, you.",
        "Liam: Hey. Uh... how's it going over there?",
        "Ivy: It's really nice.",
        "Liam: No surprises?",
        "Ivy: Uh, no. Apart from gifts. [Chuckles] Why? What's going on?",
        "Liam: Just a feeling. I'm over at Quinn's, and she's not here, so...",
        "Ivy: No, she -- I mean, she wouldn't dare --",
        "Liam: It's Quinn. Trust me. She'd dare.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Deacon: You still love her, don't you?",
        "Liam: Excuse me?",
        "Deacon: Hope.",
        "Liam: Uh... well, I mean, I'm with Ivy now, so...",
        "Deacon: And she's beautiful, but, uh, doesn't exactly answer the question.",
        "Liam: Okay, fine. Here it is. Hope is very special to me. We shared a lot. We wanted a future together. Didn't work out. But feelings like that, they don't just die. I mean, Hope is a part of me. She always will be, and my first instinct will always be to protect her.",
        "Deacon: How's Ivy feel about that?",
        "Liam: She understands. That's what's so great about Ivy. She's patient, she's accepting, she doesn't push me or hurry me along. I'm lucky to have her.",
        "Deacon: But you still wish you were with Hope.",
        "Liam: It's not really an option anymore. And don't -- don't get me wrong, deacon. I'm not settling for Ivy. We've built something together, too, and we're committed. But will I always have feelings for Hope? Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Deacon: You're a good man, Liam. I would have been damn proud to have you as a son-in-law. I'm sorry it didn't work out that way.",
        "Liam: Appreciate that.",
        "Deacon: Listen, I don't want to be rude, but I go to go run some errands.",
        "Liam: Actually, yeah, um, I was thinking, do you mind if I take you up on that drink? I got to make a phone call to Spencer, anyway.",
        "Deacon: Help yourself. Tell your old man I said hi.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Deacon: Hey, um, you might just consider cutting Quinn just a little bit of slack. I mean, she really is trying.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] All of your stuff better be out of my house. Anything that I find that doesn't belong to me? Trashed.",
        "Maya: I knew that was coming.",
        "Caroline: You lost, Myrna. You gambled that you could steal my husband, and look where that got you? Dumped. Humiliated. Alone.",
        "Maya: Rick's come back to me before.",
        "Caroline: I wouldn't count on that happening again.",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Hope: Hey.",
        "Ivy: I just wanted to say thanks for including me.",
        "Hope: Oh, yeah, well... we're family.",
        "Ivy: And not rivals?",
        "Hope: Rivals need something to dispute and... I am in love with Wyatt and you are with Liam.",
        "Ivy: Well, that's, uh... that's fair enough. I guess we can just leave it at that.",
        "Hope: Be good to him. He deserves it.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I will.",
        "Pam: Okay, everyone! Who is ready to play pin the stork on the cradle?!",
        "Katie: Oh, I know I am. Count me in.",
        "Pam: Follow me! Outside!",
        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Donna: Whoo!",
        "Ivy: You are -- you're guest of honor, so I'm gonna follow you out there.",
        "Hope: I guess I should get out there, huh? Thanks.",
        "Hope: Thank you so much! Thank you for everything! For your generosity, for -- for being here. There is such a tremendous amount of girl power in this room. I love it! And I am going to be calling on all of you for help.",
        "Pam: And we will be there.",
        "Hope: Thank you! It's all I ask. It's just -- this is amazing. It's so fantastic to me to think that Wyatt and I -- we made this. You know, we made this little person, and it's -- you know, he or she is making itself known in all these weird little interesting ways. And so soon enough, you know, this baby will be here, and it's just -- wow! [Laughs]",
        "Katie: Wow, indeed.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Hope: Anyway, I'm talking a lot. The point is, thank you. Thank you so much for my baby shower, but more importantly, thank you for being the warrior women that I can count on! Thank you so much! This is great. Thank you. I love you.",
        "Katie: I love you.",
        "Hope: I love you.",
        "Katie: Mwah!",
        "Hope: Thank you. Oh, my gosh!",
        "Caroline: Ooh, you got that leftover food!",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Ivy: Hey, do you want me to help you with the gifts?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah, that would be really great. Thanks.",
        "Ivy: Well, it's quite a haul you got there.",
        "Hope: I know. Everyone was so generous.",
        "Ivy: I know, and everyone's so creative.",
        "Hope: That, too. [Laughs] Um... thank you for being here.",
        "Ivy: Oh, honestly, I wouldn't have missed it. Hey, I just want to let you know that Liam called, and he was a little concerned.",
        "Hope: Oh, why?",
        "Ivy: He thought -- he thought that Quinn might have crashed.",
        "Hope: Oh, yeah. I was a little worried about that, myself. But we got through it! [Laughs] I...hope it doesn't bother you that he called.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Liam making sure that you're all right? No. Hope, any woman that wants to be with Liam needs to accept that you are a part of his life.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Hi, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: What are you doing here?",
        "Liam: Actually, I came to see you. Imagine my surprise when I found deacon instead. Really, though? I mean, really? Hope's father?",
        "Quinn: It's none of your business.",
        "Liam: How do you think Hope feels about this living arrangement?",
        "Quinn: It is none of your business, but you're free to ask her.",
        "Liam: Where you been?",
        "Quinn: I'm sorry. I must have been absent the day I agreed to start answering to you.",
        "Liam: Where you been?",
        "Quinn: Out, Liam.",
        "Liam: What's this? Is this for me? Oh, it's cake! Huh!",
        "Quinn: Yeah. You're an amazing detective. Went to a bakery. I have a bit of a sweet tooth. You should have me arrested.",
        "Liam: You went, didn't you? I mean, you know how Hope feels, you know what she asked you, but you don't care. You just do whatever the hell you want to do anyway. She doesn't invite you to her baby shower, yeah, you'll just crash it, right?",
        "Quinn: You are getting dangerously close to the edge, Liam. You know, I'd catch yourself if I were you.",
        "Liam: Right, right, right, right, right. 'Cause I'm crazy and you're just misunderstood.",
        "Quinn: Now you're getting it.",
        "Liam: God! I am so sick of you. I'm so sick of this -- the total disregard for anybody's feelings. You have been -- you have been manipulating Hope and me over and over and over, and when she finally has enough, she finally tells you to stay away, no. You don't listen. You refuse to listen. You just keep on coming because you're relentless.",
        "Quinn: I didn't do anything.",
        "Liam: No! No, of course not! Because the trail of chaos you leave behind you just magically creates itself. You know, I warned Hope. I warned Hope so many times about getting involved with Wyatt, that you were part of the package, that she would get sucked into the insanity, and how here she is. She's married, she's pregnant with his kid, all because of what you engineered in paris.",
        "Quinn: Oh, you are still whining about that? It's over. Liam, move on.",
        "Liam: Move on? You'd like that. You'd like me to move on. You would like me to walk away and let you keep you bullying and terrorizing and threatening Hope into doing what you want, but that's not happening. My eyes are fixed on you, and as long as I am breathing, I will protect Hope from you."
