        "Wyatt tells Steffy that he is disappointed ..that she would hate his girlfriend so much that she would make up these lies about her and Thomas. There is no way Ivy would cheat on him with Thomas or anyone else. Quinn shows Thomas some designs and then asks if she can get personal. She knows he had a thing for Ivy. Het tells her to cut to the chase. He doesn't imagine much is awkward to her. She points out that Ivy is her son's girlfriend. Liam tells Ivy that he knows who she is, very loyal and he still thinks that. She says she has not changed for the worse but she does make mistakes. He asks if she still loves Wyatt and she replies yes. And she still does not know how this happened. She knows Wyatt will be devastated but she has to tell him. She says Thomas was a perfect storm. He saved her from that falling light and then Wyatt left town and left them alone together. She did not resist him the way she should. It started with kissing. Liam says she should not even be in the same office with him must less a house. Quinn tells Thomas that he is irresistible with women, well not all, she does not think so but Thomas believes it. It's his ego. But Wyatt is better suited to his sister so she will not fight for Ivy. Thomas tells her that her little romance novel has one glitz, Steffy is in love with Liam. She says it is still something to think about.",
        "Steffy fills Wyatt in with a few more details and Wyatt says Thomas would tell her anything to help break them up. She tells him what Ivy said in guilt, that it could never happen again and then Thomas admitted something happened. It was not the deed itself but nonetheless she cheated on him. Liam tells Ivy that all she can do is be open and honest. She says Wyatt has to forgive her. She can regain his trust. That is what they do. He hugs her and says he has a shoulder if she needs it. Steffy laments to Wyatt that she is sorry. She told Ivy that she had no choice but to come clean. She is surprised she has not told him yet. He seethes that Ivy has kept this from him all this time. She says again that she is sorry but now he knows the truth. He opines that he feels like such an idiot. Steffy says no, he is not the idiot. It is Ivy who turned her back on him. Quinn tells Thomas that she does not approve of what he is doing but she also does not really approve of Ivy either. She likes her but not as a girlfriend for her son. She is beneath him ..but not for Thomas as all women are beneath him. Liam returns and tells Steffy that he just came from seeing Ivy. He tried to be a friend as she is upset. Steffy says she ought to be upset, not for telling Steffy but from cheating on Wyatt and keeping it from him. Wyatt returns home on the down side. She hands him some wine and he remarks that she seems jittery. She wants to relax first and he says he is relaxed. So she starts that there is something she needs to tell him. She does not want him to doubt that she loves him. He comments they have had each other's backs. That is their strong suit, what their relationship is based on. He trusted her so deeply and they have been through so many disappointments and rejections. This was supposed to be their fresh start, at least he thought so. He knows he has made light of the whole Thomas situation and he did not need that assurance because he had total faith in her, but he guesses that was misplaced. He was so wrong. She cries that it was so wrong, a bad mistake and Wyatt is the only man she is in love with .so please do not give up on them."

        "Steffy: That's not what this is about!",
        "Wyatt: Obviously it is! You're trying to tell me that Ivy's been unfaithful with Thomas?! You -- you can't believe that that's true. And if you do, you're just deluding yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] I can't believe I let this happen.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: He's your brother, Liam. Obviously he's gonna freak out, but do you think I'm gonna lose him?",
        "Liam: Why would you do that? Why would you cheat on Wyatt? With Thomas, of all people?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hey. Can I run something by you?",
        "Thomas: Sure. Wow.",
        "Quinn: Peridot?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, yeah, uh, perfect.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Little bit of brushed silver. It'll be great for California Freedom.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Well done.",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm. There something else?",
        "Quinn: Can I get personal?",
        "Thomas: What do you have in mind, Quinn?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] You trying to make me blush?",
        "Thomas: I imagine that would be a first for you.",
        "Quinn: Ivy. I know you have a thing for her, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Cut to the chase, why don't we?",
        "Quinn: That's me. So, you don't deny it?",
        "Thomas: That would have been awkward.",
        "Quinn: Not for me.",
        "Thomas: I don't imagine much is awkward for you, Quinn, from what I've heard.",
        "Quinn: And I don't think you take too many things seriously.",
        "Thomas: The drought, world hunger.",
        "Quinn: I don't think you care very much about those things, either.",
        "Thomas: So, Ivy.",
        "Quinn: You and Ivy. My son's girlfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Don't get judgmental on me.",
        "Liam: Trust me, I am no saint in this department. I'm just... can we -- can we -- can we talk as friends? Can we do that? Is that who we still are?",
        "Ivy: Y-yes, yeah, that's why I asked you here.",
        "Liam: You're a good person, Ivy. You're loyal, you're trustworthy. That's what I know about you. That's who you are.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but I'm not the same person you were involved with, okay? I've changed since you left. I... I'm not saying I've changed for the worse, but I... I have, and -- and I make mistakes.",
        "Liam: You still in love with Wyatt?",
        "Ivy: Yes! Yes, I am. I am.",
        "Liam: Okay, then explain it to me. How could you let this happen? And why would you let it happen with Thomas?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Do you think I'd be telling you if I didn't know it was true?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God.",
        "Steffy: I wanted Ivy to tell you, but obviously she didn't.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy would not cheat on me with Thomas or with anyone else! Stop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: God, I just wish he'd get home.",
        "Liam: You ready for this?",
        "Ivy: No, I'm not. He's gonna be devastated, but I have to tell him.",
        "Liam: You want me to stick around?",
        "Ivy: No, I don't, but thanks. God, I just keep asking myself why.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm having a little trouble with that myself. What -- [Chuckles] Tell me something. What is it? What is it about Thomas?",
        "Ivy: It was just... a perfect storm, okay, I guess. He -- he saved me from that falling spotlight, and then Wyatt left town, and we were just alone in the house together.",
        "Liam: Was he just really aggressive with you?",
        "Ivy: No. No, not at all. He was a gentleman, actually.",
        "Liam: A gentleman? Ivy, gentleman don't hit on unavailable women. So, what? Was it you making a move on him, then?",
        "Ivy: No!",
        "Liam: Okay, well --",
        "Ivy: Liam. Look, I just -- I didn't resist as much as I should have, okay? God! I don't know what it is about him. He's just -- he's got this swagger with women, and then... before I knew it, we were kissing. And I know. I know that sounds really bad.",
        "Liam: Not as bad as it could have been.",
        "Ivy: I never would have gone all the way with him.",
        "Liam: But he would have wanted to. So you should stay away from him.",
        "Ivy: Yes, I know that.",
        "Liam: I'm not kidding, Ivy! You shouldn't even be in the same damn office as him.",
        "Ivy: Look, it's not gonna happen again, Liam. I've made that very clear to Thomas.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: So you're still fighting Wyatt's battles, huh?",
        "Quinn: Is that what this is? A battle for Ivy?",
        "Thomas: You seem to think so.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] But you never have to battle for anyone. I mean, you're irresistible to women.",
        "Thomas: You think?",
        "Quinn: No. But you do.",
        "Thomas: I guess not all women, then. Case in point.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] You wouldn't be able to handle a woman like me.",
        "Thomas: Ooh. Is that a challenge?",
        "Quinn: Such a charmer.",
        "Thomas: It's working, though, just a little.",
        "Quinn: Ooh. Such an ego. And no, no, I'm not interested in defending my son's relationship with Ivy. I just don't want him to get hurt. And nothing against Ivy -- I've learned to really like the girl -- but, well, truth be told, Wyatt is better suited for your sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Thank you for looking out for me, but of all the women I have ever been close to, Ivy has been the most trustworthy. Her loyalty is beyond question.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, I know you don't want to hear this. But they kissed.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: They kissed in the building. Thomas told me. I told Thomas to back off, to respect yours and Ivy's relationship.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks. But I still don't believe you.",
        "Steffy: And when you were in San Francisco with Quinn, Thomas and Ivy, they stayed at my grandfather's house.",
        "Wyatt: I know. So what? Thomas said something happened there? Big surprise. I mean, he'd say anything to break us up.",
        "Steffy: He didn't at first. But then I overheard them in the office.",
        "Wyatt: Overheard?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Ivy was all emotional and guilt-ridden, and she told Thomas it could never happen again.",
        "Wyatt: \"It\" can never happen again?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I was wondering the same thing, so I asked Thomas.",
        "Wyatt: And?",
        "Steffy: He admitted it. Something did happen between he and Ivy at my grandfather's house.",
        "Wyatt: Something happened? I mean, did they, uh...",
        "Steffy: No. No. But it definitely wasn't innocent. She betrayed you. I confronted Ivy, and Ivy confessed. Ivy cheated on you with my brother.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: So, my sister and Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: Two brilliant minds, two incredible talents.",
        "Thomas: Ah, you're -- you're half-right there.",
        "Quinn: I know that you have no respect for Wyatt, which is why you're going after his girlfriend. And actually, I don't really think you're interested in syrupy, little Ivy except that she belongs to my son.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles] Sounds like you have no respect for Ivy at all.",
        "Quinn: No. I like her.",
        "Thomas: Hmm.",
        "Quinn: She's a talented designer. But that Steffy, man -- she's a powerhouse.",
        "Thomas: Like your son?",
        "Quinn: Well, they did have mutual interest in each other.",
        "Thomas: Well, it's just -- it's too bad your romance novel has a bit of a glitch. See, Steffy loves Liam.",
        "Quinn: Why, I'll never know.",
        "Thomas: Long, extensive history together.",
        "Quinn: One that she never seems to learn from.",
        "Thomas: And thus is doomed to repeat.",
        "Quinn: Something to think about -- Wyatt and Steffy. Sure would open up the field for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I've put you in a pretty awkward position, haven't I?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Wyatt and I have our issues, but I still want what's best for him. And I thought that was you.",
        "Ivy: It is me, Liam.",
        "Liam: Right. Well... I'm not the one you have to convince.",
        "Ivy: Betrayal is a pretty hard thing to come back from.",
        "Liam: I know. It's the downside of being a good person.",
        "Ivy: Well, I'm human just like everybody else.",
        "Liam: Is that gonna be your go-to argument?",
        "Ivy: Mnh-mnh. It's pretty weak, isn't it?",
        "Liam: Yeah, a little bit.",
        "Ivy: I just -- I don't want to lose him over this.",
        "Liam: Listen. You be open and honest. That's it. That's all you can do. It's your only recourse.",
        "Ivy: What if that doesn't work?",
        "Liam: Then you tell yourself it wasn't meant to be.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] God, how could I hurt someone I love so much? No. No, Wyatt has to forgive me. It's gonna take some work. It's gonna take some time, but I can regain his trust. That's what we do. We work through things together.",
        "Liam: Let me know if you need a shoulder.",
        "Ivy: Thanks.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I'm sorry, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy admitted it?",
        "Steffy: I told Ivy I overheard her with Thomas, and she had no choice but to come clean. I told her that you deserve to know. She promised that she would tell you, but I don't know if she will.",
        "Wyatt: She's been keeping this from me ever since I got back from San Francisco. Are you sure that they didn't, uh, have sex?",
        "Steffy: They kissed. They made out. But what's the difference? Ivy shouldn't be doing any of that. Look, Wyatt, I-I didn't -- I didn't want to tell you. But I can't keep this from you. You know, when I overheard them in the office, I just kept thinking, \"she's -- she's lying, she's cheating, she's keeping this from Wyatt, and it's not fair.\"",
        "Wyatt: Okay, just stop. Okay. Fine. Thanks. [Clears throat]",
        "Steffy: I'm sorry all of this has been dumped on you. And I know you love Ivy. But now you know the truth. Where is she?",
        "Wyatt: She's at my place. We're, uh, supposed to have a night together.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: God, I'm -- I feel like such an idiot.",
        "Steffy: No. No, look at me. You are not -- Wyatt, you are not an idiot. You love her. You've been supporting her, and you've believed in her. She's the idiot for turning her back on you.",
        "Wyatt: I guess I got to go talk to her then, huh? [Clears throat] Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Very calculating, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Thomas: I suppose you would take that as a compliment, wouldn't you?",
        "Quinn: I do want you to know that I don't approve of what you're doing to Wyatt.",
        "Thomas: But you also don't approve of his girlfriend.",
        "Quinn: I just want my son to be happy. And he is.",
        "Thomas: Huh.",
        "Quinn: He's in love. I don't really know why I'm telling you that, but... well, truth be told, I think she's beneath him.",
        "Thomas: But not me?",
        "Quinn: Well, all women are beneath you, right? I mean, you treat them all the same, like pleasure pieces.",
        "Thomas: That's just not true.",
        "Quinn: So, you could be serious about a woman?",
        "Thomas: Wouldn't be the first time.",
        "Quinn: A woman like Ivy?",
        "Thomas: You would like that, wouldn't you? Just another piece in your calculated puzzle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You got to let this go. You have to let Ivy be the one to tell Wyatt. Promise me. I'm serious.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Liam: Well, that was uncomfortable, to say the least.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Liam: I just went over to Wyatt's. Ivy asked me to come over.",
        "Steffy: Why?",
        "Liam: I don't know. She needed a friend, I guess.",
        "Steffy: Well, you're a very good friend.",
        "Liam: I try to be.",
        "Steffy: What did she want?",
        "Liam: Well, you know, she's upset about what she told you.",
        "Steffy: Ivy should be upset. But not for telling me -- for cheating on Wyatt.",
        "Liam: No, that -- that is why she's upset.",
        "Steffy: Well, I'm sure she won't admit it to Wyatt.",
        "Liam: No, she will. She's waiting for him to come home, and then she's gonna tell him.",
        "Steffy: I see.",
        "Liam: Poor guy. You know, his mind is gonna be blown.",
        "Steffy: No, it won't. Wyatt knows. I told him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Hey. I-I-I poured us some wine. I didn't want to start without you, though.",
        "Wyatt: You seem jittery.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, we, uh, we really have to talk.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] About what?",
        "Ivy: Um... do you want to relax first? Just chill out?",
        "Wyatt: I'm relaxed.",
        "Ivy: It's a stupid idea, right? [Chuckles] Um, there's been something I've been wanting to talk to you about that's been weighing on me a bit.",
        "Wyatt: That bad, huh?",
        "Ivy: But, um, before I start, I just... um, I just -- I just want you know please don't doubt how much I love you. Okay, your loyalty and your support -- it means everything to me. You've been so good to me, and you've been so good for me.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I mean, we've been -- we've been both good for each other, right, Ivy?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: It didn't matter what the world threw at us. We could take it. Because we had each other's backs. And that only comes with honesty and trust. I mean, that -- that was our whole strong suit. That was what our relationship was based on.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I remember you saying right here in this room that you would never give up on me, you'd never give up on us. Right now, I really need to know that you meant that.",
        "Wyatt: I don't say things I don't mean. You know that. Not for someone I care so deeply for, someone who I trust so deeply. You and I, we've -- we've been through it, you and me, the disappointments and the rejection and being kicked to the curb. This was supposed to be our fresh start. I-I-I... I thought so. I mean, I think about the past few weeks, about how I made light about the whole Thomas situation. Him flirting with you and coming on to you and... and I was flattered. I was flattered. I was like, \"This guy has the hots for my girl.\" And then I told him, I said, \"just keep it in check. Back off.\" 'Cause you assured me that it wouldn't be a problem, and I didn't need that assurance because I had total trust in you. I had total faith in you. But I guess that faith and trust was -- was misplaced, right? I-I was -- I was so sure and so wrong. Thomas?",
        "Ivy: No, Wyatt --",
        "Wyatt: Of all people? Thomas?",
        "Ivy: No, I'm so -- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It was stupid. It was dumb. It was -- it was a mistake. I... I don't even know how it happened. I'm so in love with you. You're the only man I want to be with, okay? I... please, Wyatt, don't... don't give up on me. Don't give up on us. Don't give up on us."
