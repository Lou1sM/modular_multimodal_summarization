        "There's a photo shoot. Oliver is snapping the photos of Hope in sexy, provocative poses. Wyatt is enjoying watching and of course shadow girl is taking notes and watching the expressions on everyone's face. Mostly doom and gloom in Liam's office, he's throwing paper airplanes around when Katie walks in. He tries to find out how her day is going but quickly it gets turned around that Hope had a thing today, one that he is not too happy about surmises Katie. He grumbles that suddenly it's like Wyatt is in charge of the entire PR department just because he offered some designs for Hope's line. He feels like he is losing her. Brooke is back at work and Bill suddenly strolls in. She tells him that he can not be here. He says he owns part of this company. He has every right to be here. He starts to close the door and she tells him to keep it open. He makes a point of closing it and locking it. She tells him this is not funny. He says it could even be hysterical if she calls security and tries to have him escorted out of here. She says it doesn't make any difference; he's gonna do what he wants to anyway. He tells her she can't pretend that she doesn't know him ..every part of him. That's why he is here. They have unfinished business in her bedroom. She says he is disgusting. He says Brooke's Bedroom .the biggest selling line in FC. My my, Brooke's mind tsk tsk! Katie tells Liam okay, here goes. He has lost Hope but not to Wyatt. It has to be obvious even to Liam that Hope is not that same uncertain young woman that he fell in love with. Hope's had success, she's had failure and then even greater success and more failure when she lost Liam. These had major impacts on her. They force you to grow up and be self reliant. She points out that Hope doesn't need him like she used to and that is not a bad thing. He wonders if that means he has nothing to offer Hope anymore. She says no, she just thinks he wants it the way it used to be; him and Hope against the world. And he's the dragon slayer. But the world is on Hope's side now and she can slay those dragons all by herself. So stop poking around in Hope's mind and poke around in his own. He needs to know what he needs. Then she asks him about Thanksgiving Day. She hopes she didn't come off acting like a basket case. She pries a bit if Bill has seen or talked about Brooke at home with him. He assures her that he hasn't. Katie asks if Brooke has come over to see Bill. Again Liam replies no. He's like a crazy person as he gets up every morning like he has am army to command but there is nothing for him to do or nowhere for him to go. Katie says the real kicker is those kind always win. If he's made a strategic target on Brooke then she better watch out. Oliver takes lots more shots of Hope then Wyatt calls in Maya and offers some suggestions to pose as best friends, as rivals, as sisters. Wyatt then says somebody needs to break this up and he joins the girls in the shoot and asks if anyone ordered a plumber. Aly looks uncomfortable. Against Wyatt's wishes, Oliver wants Wyatt to get made up and take a few more shots.",
        "Brooke tells Bill to just give it a rest. He says he only wants to talk business with her. She says FC is doing just fine so he just needs to collect his dividend check and be grateful. He tells her that HFTF surprised him and they are trending but it will have a short shelf life and then the public will be looking for the next big thing. Brooke says Hope has resurrected that line twice from the grave so she is not so worried about it. Someone knocks on the door so Bill has to unlock the door and let them in. It's Aly and she stammers that she is sorry that she interrupted. Brooke says great. It took months for people to stop talking about them and now they are going to be talking again. He's amused that she wants to live her life so nobody finds any fault with her. She says no that is not what matters. She doesn't want them to be right. He says she was all in favor of dusting off and rebooting the bedroom line when he first suggested it. She says they did but then it fizzled. He says that was because she could not be the lead model and had to back away. She says he does not have to bring that up now. She was pregnant with his child and that disqualified her as a model and as a sister and as a human being. She says she realizes he has a ton of time on his hands lately that he can waste, but she doesn't really have that so will he please go. He says there has to be a way that they can be in the same room. That is what he wants. She asks how that is working out for him. He says he screwed up. He knows it, Brooke knows it. Surely she doesn't want him to come crawling on his belly. That isn't going to happen. She says she just doesn't want him to keep making all these excuses to see her or talk to other people about her. It only makes things worse for her. She admits it hurts her when she has to push him away. He says then don't. He puts his hand out to cover hers and tells her just be herself. She says she can't. She won't be that person that she can't trust anymore. He reminds her that his niece is married now to her son. They are going to be in the same spaces. She says maybe but never again behind closed, locked doors. He says he can not accept that as to never touch her again or lie down next to her again or wake her up in the middle of the night. He touches her arm and she flinches and tries to hold it together. He says so he is supposed to tell himself that the best months of his life are now over. She says she can not help what stories he tells himself. He wants to know what she tells herself when she is alone each night. She says, \"goodnight, Bill, that what I tell myself.\" He walks out. She sighs heavily and the tears fall. Oliver takes a lot more shots of Wyatt and Hope, him behind her running his fingers over her necklace, touching her neck, he even dips her and kisses her. Again Aly looks mighty uncomfortable. Oliver says they have some great shots here. Hope tells Aly that was her first photo shoot and she hopes she liked it. Aly said it didn't take as long as she expected. Hope says she should have known Wyatt would be good at it since he is such a ham. Aly says some of those pictures Hope may not want to use since Wyatt kissed her. Hope responds that yeah, sometimes Wyatt takes things a little far but she thinks that is part of his charm. Aly says she is surprised that Hope would be charmed by that. Hope wants to know if Aly is worried about her. Aly says she knows that Hope knows what she is doing. Hope says she hopes Aly doesn't think that Wyatt will take advantage of her; she can manage him. Aly asks isn't Hope afraid of what Liam will think. Hope says it's true Liam and Wyatt don't like each other but there is nothing she can do about that. Aly says maybe Hope doesn't see it but on Thanksgiving she got the impression that Wyatt likes to upset Liam. Hope says she sees it too and she knows it looks strange to Aly. But she spent a very long time with Liam planning weddings and always afraid that Steffy would come back into his life. She is just now taking some time for herself to have fun and enjoy herself. Aly agrees that makes sense. But she needs to hear Hope says that once she gets her line re-established, she will be with Liam. Hope says Liam really doesn't know what a cheerleader he has in her. Wyatt, Oliver, Hope and Aly all gather their iPhones and make sure they have all the photos. Wyatt especially likes the kissing one and thinks the world wants to see that. Hope jokes around but ends up deleting it from the considerations. Wyatt tries to persuade Oliver to get it back. Alone Aly goes through all the pictures on her iPhone and stops on the kissing picture. She hesitates but ends up sending it in an e-mail to Liam and says she thought he should know."

        "Katie: How did what go?",
        "Liam: Uh, I just thought -- you had a meeting?",
        "Katie: Did you think I was Hope? Because she's the only one that would just come strolling into your office unannounced, except for, perhaps, your boss.",
        "Liam: She had a -- she had a thing today.",
        "Katie: Sounds like you're not too happy about that thing.",
        "Liam: Yeah, that thing -- it was a photo shoot. Wyatt felt inspired to showcase some new jewelry for the line. Is he, like, a photographer now? Seriously. Did Forrester put him in charge of the entire P.R. department? What's the deal?",
        "Katie: Well, I'm sure Hope wouldn't have done it if she didn't think it was a good idea.",
        "Liam: Has Hope ever thought Wyatt had a bad idea?",
        "Katie: It's just a photo shoot.",
        "Liam: Then why do I feel like I'm losing her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Brooke: You can't be here.",
        "Bill: I own part of this company.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, that's what you always say.",
        "Bill: Maybe I should just grab a few sewing machines and a couple of bolts of chiffon and call it even. What do you think?",
        "Brooke: Whom were you here to see -- Rick or Eric?",
        "Bill: Whom do you think?",
        "Brooke: Leave the door open. Leave the door open.",
        "[Lock clicks]",
        "Brooke: Do you think this is funny?",
        "Bill: Could be hysterical if you called security and tried to have me escorted out of here.",
        "Brooke: What difference does it make? You'll do what you want to do anyway.",
        "Bill: There's no use to pretend like you don't know me. Every part of me. That's why I'm here. We have unfinished business.",
        "Brooke: I think you're mistaken.",
        "Bill: In your bedroom.",
        "Brooke: You can be really disgusting.",
        "Bill: Brooke's Bedroom. The biggest-selling line in the history of Forrester Creations. Brooke, your mind... [Clicks tongue]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay. Here goes. You have lost Hope. But not to Wyatt. That's not what I mean. It has to be obvious, even to you, that she's not the same uncertain young woman that you fell in love with.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I mean, we're both a little older, a little wiser than we were last year. I mean, I hope we can say that every year. She's still the same girl I fell in love with.",
        "Katie: She's had success, and she's had failure, and then she's had even greater success and even greater failure when she lost you. Those kind of experiences have a huge impact on a woman's life. They force you to grow up. They force you to be self-reliant. She doesn't need you the same way she used to, and that's not a bad thing.",
        "Liam: Are you saying that I have nothing to offer Hope anymore?",
        "Katie: I'm just saying that you want it to be the way it used to be -- you and Hope against the world, and you're the dragon slayer. But the world is on Hope's side now, and she slew all of her dragons all by herself. Stop worrying about what's going on in Hope's mind and start poking around your own. What do you need?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Camera shutter clicking]",
        "Wyatt: Okay, Maya, you get in there. Yeah. All right. You're sisters. Yeah.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: You're sisters.",
        "Hope: Obviously.",
        "Wyatt: You're rivals, then. You're rivals. Huh? There it is. You're best friends. You're best friends. Ha! Yes! Show her the diamond. Show her the black diamond. Oh, what? There could be a catfight here.",
        "Hope: Oh.",
        "Wyatt: Oh! Hey, you know what? Somebody's got to break this up.",
        "Maya: Oh, okay.",
        "Wyatt: Somebody order a plumber?",
        "Maya: Wow! Hey!",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Oliver: There you go.",
        "Wyatt: There it is.",
        "Oliver: Oh. Fantastic. Hope, where'd you get this guy?",
        "Wyatt: In the woods. Yeah.",
        "Hope: The truth.",
        "Wyatt: Running around.",
        "Oliver: Let's make him up for a few shots.",
        "Wyatt: Like a \"Beauty and the Beast\" thing? Come on.",
        "Hope: Yes. Aly, will you see if my mom or your dad has something that he could throw on?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, God. What have you done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Just give it a rest, Bill.",
        "Bill: I can't even talk business with you?",
        "Brooke: Forrester Creations is doing just fine, so collect your dividend check and be grateful.",
        "Bill: Hope for the Future is trending. I freely admit I didn't see that coming.",
        "Brooke: I'm not about to push our -- our buyers into a different direction.",
        "Bill: Well, not at the moment. But the clock's ticking. Hope for the Future has a shelf life, and before you know it, everybody's going to be looking for the next big thing.",
        "Brooke: Hope has resurrected that line twice from the grave, so I'm not so worried about it.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bill: Okay, I'll get it. Hi.",
        "Brooke: Alexandria, come in.",
        "Aly: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Brooke: Wait, Aly!",
        "Bill: Aly! Aly! Aly is gone.",
        "Brooke: That's great. It took months for people to stop talking about you and me, and now they're gonna start talking again.",
        "Bill: Do you really want to live your life so that no one finds any fault with it?",
        "Brooke: It's not really a matter of that. I just don't want them to be right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Oliver: Yeah, that's nice. There you go. Yeah, there you go. Kind of touch her neck a little bit.",
        "[Camera shutter clicking]",
        "Oliver: Get behind her.",
        "Wyatt: I'm gonna grab this and then I'm gonna dip you.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: This.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You were all in favor of dusting off and rebooting the bedroom line when I first brought it up.",
        "Brooke: We did a relaunch and it fizzled.",
        "Bill: Well, that's because you couldn't be the lead model. You had to back away.",
        "Brooke: Do you really want to bring that up now, knowing why I did?",
        "Bill: It wasn't a criticism, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I was pregnant with your child. So that disqualified me as a model. And as a sister. And as a human being.",
        "Bill: That was our baby, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Look, I realize that you have a ton of time on your hands lately, time that you can waste, but I don't really have that, so... could you please go?",
        "Bill: There has to be a way.",
        "Brooke: Yeah? What -- what way?",
        "Bill: Being in the same room.",
        "Brooke: So, is that what you want?",
        "Bill: Yeah, that is what I want.",
        "Brooke: So there has to be a way to get what you want. How's that working out for you, Bill?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Camera shutter clicking]",
        "Oliver: Awesome job. Gonna have some great images here.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah!",
        "Hope: So... so, that was your first photo shoot.",
        "Aly: Yeah, it wasn't what I expected at all. I thought it would take longer.",
        "Hope: Oh, well, yeah. That's the beauty of having a team that's worked together for so long.",
        "Aly: But Wyatt's new, like me.",
        "Hope: Yeah. I should've known he'd be good at it, though. He's such a ham.",
        "Aly: Some of those pictures you probably don't want to use.",
        "Hope: Why?",
        "Aly: He kissed you.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Sometimes Wyatt takes things a little far, but -- I don't know -- I guess that's part of his charm. What?",
        "Aly: Oh, I'm just surprised you'd be charmed by it.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, normally, I don't get in the middle of these things, you know?",
        "Hope: Aly, are you worried about me?",
        "Aly: I know you know what you're doing.",
        "Hope: Are you afraid that Wyatt is gonna take advantage or something?",
        "Aly: Is he?",
        "Hope: Don't worry. I can manage him.",
        "Aly: But aren't you afraid that Liam will think that...",
        "Hope: [Breathes deeply] Well, the two of them don't get along. And there's not much I can do about it. Believe me. I've tried. What?",
        "Aly: I just noticed on thanksgiving Liam seemed a little... you may not see it, but I think Wyatt likes to upset him.",
        "Hope: I see it. I do.",
        "Aly: I shouldn't have said anything.",
        "Hope: No, no. It's fine. It's... I can understand how this whole thing I have with Liam and Wyatt may seem confusing or strange, but... the thing is, I spent a very long time with Liam, constantly worrying and planning weddings and afraid that Steffy was gonna come back and interfere in our relationship, and... I'm finally taking time for myself. You know, I'm finally taking this time to have fun and enjoy my life. Does that -- does that make sense to you?",
        "Aly: Yeah, yeah, I see.",
        "Hope: Does it make you feel any better?",
        "Aly: But once you have the line and everything the way you want it, you're gonna be with Liam, right?",
        "Hope: Mm. Well, Liam really doesn't know what a cheerleader he has in you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Okay. Well, you killed one of my features for \"Eye on Fashion.\" Any other death-dealing you want to do? Where is that African violet?",
        "Katie: Ha. Actually, I think it's time for an evaluation.",
        "Liam: Really? Today? 'Cause, I mean, Dad's evaluations were always like, \"Well, you suck a little less this year than last year.\"",
        "Katie: He really should have been a motivational speaker.",
        "Liam: I know.",
        "Katie: Anyway, I'm not talking about you.",
        "Liam: Who are we evaluating? 'Cause there's... you?",
        "Katie: How do you think thanksgiving went? I mean, did I seem like a total basket case?",
        "Liam: Well, I can tell you, you were a lot more composed than my dad or Brooke.",
        "Katie: Did Bill... say anything? I mean, I know the two of you are living together. So you can tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I screwed up. You know it. I know it. The world knows it. What do you want me to do, Brooke? Want me to crawl on my belly? That's not going to happen.",
        "Brooke: I just want you to stop making inane excuses to see me or to talk to me, to speak to other people about me. It just makes things worse.",
        "Bill: What things? I'm no more despised or rejected than I was when I walked in here, am I?",
        "Brooke: Okay. It makes things worse for me. And what if Katie had decided to stop by?",
        "Bill: You and Katie aren't on visiting terms these days, are you?",
        "Brooke: What if I don't like that feeling of pushing you away? It hurts me, too, you know?",
        "Bill: Then don't. Just be yourself.",
        "Brooke: I can't. I -- I won't be that person that I can't trust anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Okay. You now have file access to low-to-medium-resolution shots waiting for you on the server.",
        "Hope: Awesome.",
        "Wyatt: Got it.",
        "Hope: And now so does Aly.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Wyatt: All right.",
        "Oliver: All right, here you go. Check these out.",
        "Aly: That's gorgeous.",
        "Hope: She looks stunning.",
        "Wyatt: Oh.",
        "Oliver: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: That's cute.",
        "Wyatt: Oh! That! See, now, that's the one. That's the one the world wants to see, right there.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I think I want to find the delete button for that one.",
        "Wyatt: What did you do?!",
        "Hope: I don't know. Something happened.",
        "Wyatt: Get it back. Can you get it back, please? I love that -- that's a good picture.",
        "Oliver: I don't know how this works.",
        "Wyatt: Are you kidding?! You made the slide show! This is ridiculous!",
        "Hope: You can't have it back. It's gone forever. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Uh, nothing.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Liam: I mean Dad said nothing about thanksgiving, about you, nada.",
        "Katie: Well... you know, I walk around constantly feeling judged. I really have to break that habit because, apparently, no one is thinking of me.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Katie: What about Brooke?",
        "Liam: What about her?",
        "Katie: Does she ever... come over to your house?",
        "Liam: Oh. No.",
        "Katie: Does Bill ever see her?",
        "Liam: Katie...",
        "Katie: What? Come on, Liam. Am I putting you in a tough position?",
        "Liam: All right, fi-- yeah, he -- he did ask if she's back at Forrester working full time.",
        "Katie: And what did you tell him?",
        "Liam: Oh, I didn't know. He just assumed that Hope told me, but she doesn't tell me everything anymore.",
        "Katie: He's still lovesick over here, isn't he? Brooke?",
        "Liam: It's kind of like he's a crazy person now. I mean, he wakes up every morning so full of purpose, like he's got an army to command, but there's nothing for him to do, nowhere for him to go.",
        "Katie: He's always commanding armies that aren't there, sending them into battle. You know what the kicker is? They win. If he's made a strategic target out of Brooke... she better watch out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Bill: We have to figure this out.",
        "Brooke: We already have. We made a mistake, and now it's over. So, maybe you should just travel around the world or jump out of an airplane, have your life flash before your eyes.",
        "Bill: My niece is married to your son. We're going to be seeing each other.",
        "Brooke: Well, never behind a closed, locked door in a room, alone. Never again.",
        "Bill: I can't accept that I'm never going to touch you again, never going to lie down next to you again... wake you up in the middle of the night.",
        "Brooke: Well, you know, life is funny that way. Things happen, and...life is short.",
        "Bill: How much time did we have? How many weeks?",
        "Brooke: I wasn't counting.",
        "Bill: So I'm just supposed to tell myself that those few months were the best of my life and now they're over?",
        "Brooke: I -- I can't really help you with a story that you tell yourself.",
        "Bill: And what do you tell yourself, Brooke... when you're alone at night?",
        "Brooke: Goodbye, Bill. That's what I tell myself. [Sighs heavily]",
