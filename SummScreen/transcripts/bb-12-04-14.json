        "Liam accuses Quinn of lying about being at the shower and he wants her to admit it. She says he is the one being relentless. He's like a dog with a bone. She's been treated like a pariah and not the doting grandmother that she really is. This baby changes everything. She will never be a threat again. Liam says yes she will as long as she insinuates herself where she is not wanted and Quinn will never be free of him protecting Hope. Justin advises Bill just to fly to Milan and drag Brooke home. Bill says he is not that kind of cave man. Wyatt interrupts. Bill pours him a drink and asks about Hope. Wyatt asks him about baby showers with girls only and men not allowed. Bill says that is not what he is there for. Wyatt admits it is about his mom. She is shacking up with Deacon for one thing. But he feels bad cutting her out of his life with his first child and all. He has taken steps but nothing ever works. Bill says he must take a stand as this kind of stress is not good for Hope or the baby either. He calls Justin. Hope tells Ivy that she knows her relationship has gotten a lot closer with Liam and they both have told each other they love each other. She says she is committed to her family and to Wyatt and this child, so all of these might have beens rolling around in her head don't help.",
        "Liam calls Ivy and checks about the cake and is certain that the one he is looking at is one Quinn lurked around at the party and then took as a souvenir. She vows again she just wants to be part of the family and nothing more. He says she almost sounds sincere but he knows it is only because she is caught. It won't change anything. She keeps stalking Hope. She keeps insinuating herself into Hope's life. Just know this as long as she is a threat to Hope's happiness that Quinn will never be free of Liam. He says and just wait until Hope hears about this. Quinn tells him to stop with all the negativity to Hope. She shouts that she is a mother and grandmother and does not want to be ostracized from the family that means the world to her. Can't they all just come together for everyone's sake? He says he and Hope do not believe one word that comes out of her mouth as she will say anything to get what she wants. She says all she wants is to put her family together. He says maybe but they would be better off without her as she has impulse issues and is unbalanced. He feels really sorry for her son. She says Hope and Wyatt have moved on but Liam can't or won't. He says moving on does not mean that he doesn't look out for Hope or care for her and yes even love her. If it weren't for Quinn he would be married to her right now. And yes Bill meddled with him and Hope but he learned from it. Quinn is not sorry until she gets caught. He threatens that he has always felt she was a danger to Hope and if she does it again she will have to deal with him. Wyatt is a little reluctant but finally comes around when Bill has Justin draw up a restraining order for Quinn. He agrees that is the only way as he can not get through to her. He says he is doing it for Hope as that is what a good husband does. Bill hugs him and says he is a good husband and son too. Liam calls Hope and asks her to meet him. It's about Quinn and important. Hope suggests Brooke's house since she is out of town. When he tells her that he has no proof but he went to Quinn's and she had a piece of cake just like Ivy said they had at the shower, Hope panics. Liam tells her she should not have to live her life looking over her shoulder and he wants her to know he will never stop caring about her."

        "Liam: You're lying. You were at Hope's baby shower.",
        "Quinn: This is getting old.",
        "Liam: Just tell me the truth, Quinn. Just, for once in your life, tell me the truth. That's all.",
        "Quinn: The truth? The truth is I am being maligned.",
        "Liam: Oh, by me?",
        "Quinn: Yeah, by you. You're being relentless.",
        "Liam: I'm -- I'm protecting Hope.",
        "Quinn: She has a husband for that. And she doesn't need protection.",
        "Liam: Okay, what is this? What -- what's this? Explain this, please. Hmm?",
        "Quinn: I told you -- I went to a bakery. I have a sweet tooth.",
        "Liam: No, you didn't. You ignored Hope, you crashed her shower, and you brought back cake as a memento. Why can't you just admit that? Admit it.",
        "Quinn: Or what?",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Oh, my God.",
        "Ivy: Well, I know we all tossed around baby names before, but is there anything you and Wyatt really like?",
        "Hope: Um...I don't know if we have a favorite, but I was thinking that, if it's a girl, we could name her Beth.",
        "Ivy: After your grandmother.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Luckily, we still have time. [Chuckles] It's very early, which is good, because we have not even started on the nursery.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Well, judging by this loot, your little one, boy or girl, will lack nothing.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Ivy: It'll have a lot of family and friends who will be there for him or her.",
        "Hope: Mm.",
        "Ivy: Just like they will be for you, Hope.",
        "Hope: You know, I-I was thinking about what you said when Liam called to ask if I was all right and...how you said that any woman who's with Liam will have to accept that I am also a part of his life.",
        "Ivy: Well, you two share a history. You're gonna be connected... forever. And that's one of the things that I really love about Liam -- how protective he is, how loyal he is. I really want your baby to get to know him -- what a wonderful man he is and what a great uncle he will be. That won't be a problem, will it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: Was that Brooke you were just on the phone with?",
        "Bill: What are you, my keeper?",
        "Justin: Why don't you fly to Milan and drag her home?",
        "Bill: What do you mean \"drag her home\"? What am I, a caveman?",
        "Justin: Uh, well --",
        "Bill: Funny.",
        "Justin: Okay, fine. You don't want to talk about Brooke, so why don't you fill me in on you and Ridge? I heard you two duked it out.",
        "Bill: Look, not fashion boy or anybody else messes with my family and gets away with it. You know that.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Justin: Very true.",
        "Bill: Go away!",
        "Wyatt: Okay, but that kind of treatment's not gonna get you my vote for father of the year.",
        "Bill: Obviously I didn't know it was you. Come on in. Justin was just leaving.",
        "Wyatt: How are you?",
        "Bill: You want one?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Uh, sure.",
        "Bill: There you go.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Bill: What's going on? Everything okay with Hope and the baby?",
        "Wyatt: Explain something to me.",
        "Bill: Shoot.",
        "Wyatt: Baby showers.",
        "Bill: Yeah?",
        "Wyatt: What really goes on when it's \"girls only\" and guys aren't allowed?",
        "Bill: Well, they talk about... I don't know what the Hell they talk about. What, is that where Hope is?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Pam and Aly organized it. I know. I got a text from Hope, though. Apparently, a good time was had by all.",
        "Bill: That's not why you're here, though. There's something on your mind. What is it?",
        "Wyatt: I'm concerned about mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Hey, I want you to know...I went and saw Liam before coming to the baby shower. Um... I told him that I-I saw the two of you kissing in Amsterdam when you were on the boat. I know that your relationship has...gotten a lot closer. I know that you told him you love him.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I do.",
        "Hope: And he loves you, too.",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I'm sorry. I don't buy that you were at the bakery.",
        "Quinn: Tough. I was.",
        "Liam: Well, which bakery, then? Give me a name. Give me an address.",
        "Quinn: Oh, my God, Liam! Just let it go, okay? You're like a dog with a bone.",
        "Liam: No. Sorry. Not as long as you're stalking Hope.",
        "Quinn: Why would I do that? I love Hope and the baby she's carrying. They're my family.",
        "Liam: No, they're not. No, you were exiled, and it's driving you crazy.",
        "Quinn: No. What it is doing is it is ripping my heart apart -- being treated like a pariah instead of a loving, doting grandmother-to-be.",
        "Liam: I hope you're not suggesting that that is Hope's fault, after everything that you've done to her.",
        "Quinn: What I have done is make it possible for Hope to be married to a man who idolizes her, someone who's never gonna give another woman a second look, not like you did when you were juggling Hope and Steffy Forrester. Now, look, I may have been overzealous.",
        "Liam: You may have been overzealous?",
        "Quinn: But that all changed when Hope got pregnant. This baby changes everything. It made Hope and Wyatt's marriage secure. I-I will never be a threat again.",
        "Liam: And yet you keep stalking her. You keep insinuating yourself where you're not wanted. What is it gonna take to get through to you, Quinn? Know this -- as long as you are a threat to Hope's happiness, you won't be rid of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: I know this baby changed the course of everything -- your life and Liam's.",
        "Hope: Actually, Quinn did that when she pushed you into the river and...",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: Oh, God. I have to stop doing that. Quinn obviously played a part in things, and she is paying for it now, but... all of these might-have-beens that keep rolling around in my head -- they're not helping anybody. And I want you to know that I-I am committed to my family -- to Wyatt and -- and this child.",
        "Ivy: And it'll be wonderful. Hope, you're gonna be an incredible mother.",
        "Hope: That's what Liam said.",
        "Ivy: Well, he said it because he knows you so well and because he cares.",
        "Hope: And I care about him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: You should be concerned, Wyatt. Quinn's unpredictable, to say the least.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] You don't know the half of it.",
        "Bill: Enlighten me.",
        "Wyatt: Well, for starters, she's been shacking up with Deacon Sharpe.",
        "Bill: Mr. Mug Shot. Yeah, I know. What else?",
        "Wyatt: Hope. She's taken such a strong stance. She's insisted that mom not be a part of our lives or our baby's.",
        "Bill: Right. I know that, too.",
        "Wyatt: How?",
        "Bill: Quinn came to me to solicit my support, which I, of course, wouldn't give her. So Hope has every reason to be wary after all the stunts that she's pulled. I appreciate that it puts you in the middle, and that's a tough spot to be.",
        "Wyatt: I just -- I feel bad cutting her out of my life, especially with the first grandkid on the way, but Hope is my wife, and --",
        "Bill: And you got to tell Quinn to steer clear.",
        "Wyatt: I have, for all the good that it's done.",
        "Bill: You better take a stand.",
        "Wyatt: How am I possibly gonna take a stand?",
        "Bill: Get a restraining order.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: You got to show Quinn that you mean business. If you don't, she's gonna keep badgering you and Hope, especially Hope. And that kind of stress is not good for a mother-to-be... or for the baby she's carrying. Justin, get to my office now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: What are you doing?",
        "Liam: I'm done wasting my time with you. I'm going to the source.",
        "Quinn: You're calling Hope?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Ivy: Hey. Two calls in one shower. Do I rate or what?",
        "Liam: Uh, you definitely rate. Party over?",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah.",
        "Liam: How was it?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, it was, uh -- it was pretty great. Hope really enjoyed herself.",
        "Liam: No sign of Quinn?",
        "Ivy: No. No, thank goodness.",
        "Liam: Uh...was there cake? Vanilla with fresh berries?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Uh, yes. How do you know?",
        "Liam: I'll fill you in later.",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Quinn: It's not what you think.",
        "Liam: No, it's exactly what I think. You snuck in to Hope's party without anybody noticing. You -- you lurked in the shadows like the creepy stalker that you, and apparently, you couldn't leave empty handed, so you swiped this sucker and took it home with you. I mean, my God! When -- when Hope finds out what you've been up to --",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on! Would you stop it?! Would you stop running to Hope, filling her head with negativity about me?! God. I am not a threat, Liam. I am a mother and a grandmother who doesn't want to be ostracized from the people, from the family that means everything in the world to her. Can't you understand that? Can't you have just a little bit of empathy? Can't we just -- we just all come together for everyone's sake, especially for Hope and her baby?",
        "Liam: Well, I'll give you one thing. You almost sound sincere this time.",
        "Quinn: I am sincere.",
        "Liam: No, you're not, though. You're just manipulating like you always do, because you got caught in yet another deception.",
        "Quinn: No, you don't understand.",
        "Liam: Just don't -- don't bother. I-I don't believe a word that comes out of your mouth, and neither does Hope. That's why she doesn't want you around anymore. Because you will say or do anything, whatever it takes, as long as you get what you want.",
        "Quinn: What I want is to put my family together.",
        "Liam: They're better off without you.",
        "Quinn: That's not true.",
        "Liam: Yes, it is. You have impulse-control issues. You are unbalanced. You don't think about the consequences of your actions. I mean, I-I feel really sorry for your son.",
        "Quinn: You can't help yourself. You can't stay out of his marriage. You can't accept that he's married to her and not you, that she's carrying his child, not yours. Hope and Wyatt have moved on. Why won't you?",
        "Liam: Do you think that moving on means that Hope is no longer an important part of my life? Because I'll always look out for her. I'll always care for her.",
        "Quinn: You'll always love her.",
        "Liam: Yes. Yes, I will always love her. I'd be married to her right now if it weren't for you.",
        "Quinn: Your father interfered in your relationship with Hope, too. And you forgave him. Why won't you do the same thing for me?",
        "Liam: Because my father learned from his meddling. He was genuinely sorry about it, Quinn. You're not. You're just sorry whenever you get caught. You know, I've always believed that you were a danger to Hope, and I still do. And if you come near her again, you'll deal with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Get right on it. No delays.",
        "Justin: Sure thing. Just need Wyatt's okay.",
        "Wyatt: A restraining order against my own mother. It's...",
        "Bill: Wyatt, come on. I mean, you've tried everything, right? You've given her how many warnings?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and it's really starting to get to Hope. She keeps doing stuff like this.",
        "Bill: So, why you hesitating?",
        "Wyatt: I'm not! It's just that --",
        "Bill: All right. Look, look, look. You love her. She's your mother. I get it. The restraining order isn't permanent. If she is behaving herself, we can have it lifted.",
        "Justin: Plus, it'll give a chance for your mother to prove to you and Hope that she can play by the rules...with a little help.",
        "Wyatt: You know, you're right. Do it. I can't get through to mom any other way.",
        "Bill: Call Judge Herman. Tell him we need that restraining order A.S.A.P.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Ringing]",
        "Hope: Liam, hi.",
        "Liam: Hey. You still at Eric's?",
        "Hope: Uh, yeah. I'm just on my way out the door.",
        "Liam: Um, can you meet me?",
        "Hope: Where?",
        "Liam: I don't know. Some place private.",
        "Hope: Okay. What is this about?",
        "Liam: Quinn. It's kind of important.",
        "Hope: Uh, yeah. Yeah. Well, my mom is still in Italy, so why don't we just meet at her house?",
        "Liam: Okay. Uh, I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "(Wyatt's flashback)",
        "Wyatt: You don't really think she'd hurt you, right?",
        "Hope: Yes, I do. And I would feel so much safer if she were not around, like -- like out of L.A.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, I doubt she'd agree to that.",
        "Hope: Well, what other choice do we have? We have to do something, and I'm so sorry, but I-I'm not gonna back down on this.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. You're right. I'll go talk to her. I'll tell her to stay away from us for a while or something.",
        "Hope: Okay. Sorry. I-I can't imagine what you must be going through, and I-I hate asking you to cut yourself off from your mother. I-I do. But think of everything that she's done. I don't want her around me or anyone in my family, and especially nowhere near our baby.",
        "(Present time)",
        "Bill: You've given your mother chance after chance. A restraining order is the logical next step.",
        "Wyatt: And what if she can't stay away?",
        "Bill: Well, you have to hope that she has learned more self-control than we give her credit for.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I know this isn't easy for you, son, but it needs to be done.",
        "Wyatt: I'm doing this for Hope, to make sure she feels safe. That's what a good husband does.",
        "Bill: And you are a good husband... and a good son, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Okay. I don't need that. [Sighs]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Hope: Hi.",
        "Liam: Hey. Thanks for meeting me.",
        "Hope: Yeah. What -- uh, what's going on? You said this was about Quinn.",
        "Liam: Yeah. You know, I can't -- I can't stop worrying about her.",
        "Hope: You mean like what she's gonna do next?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Yeah. I-I'm right there with you, and that's why I took such a hard line with her, you know? I-I hate coming between Wyatt and his mom.",
        "Liam: You're not. You're not. Quinn is, because she keeps continuing to harass you.",
        "Hope: I know, I know. But she doesn't see it that way. She thinks that I'm being unfair.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, you know what? You're being a protective mother. You're looking after your baby like any good mom would do.",
        "Hope: Thank you. So, sorry, what -- what's going on?",
        "Liam: Um...that's what I wanted to find out, so I went over to Quinn's place.",
        "Hope: Uh, you went to Quinn's? Why?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Uh...you have every right to be worried about her.",
        "Hope: Do I have even more reason to be worried about her now?",
        "Liam: Well, okay. All right, I think she was at your shower.",
        "Hope: What?!",
        "Liam: Yeah. I mean, I-I know you didn't invite her, but -- but --",
        "Hope: No, no, no, no. Liam, I -- trust me. No. She was not invited, and I was afraid she was gonna pull something, too, but she didn't. She didn't show up.",
        "Liam: That you know of.",
        "Hope: What do you mean?",
        "Liam: Okay, so I go over to Quinn's place. She's not there. So, um...I waited, and she comes back. And she's holding a slice of cake. Now, she tells me that she was just at the bakery, but I don't know. I call Ivy, and I ask her, \"What kind of cake is at the shower?\" It's exactly the same kind -- vanilla with fresh berries.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Oh, my God. Oh, my God!",
        "Liam: Listen. Wait, wait, wait. Listen.",
        "Hope: That's so creepy!",
        "Liam: I know that it's not absolute proof that she was there, but come on. I mean, I confronted her.",
        "Hope: Wh-wh-what did she say? Did she deny everything?",
        "Liam: Yeah, of course she did. But I don't how she slipped in without anyone noticing. That's the thing. That -- look, she's unstable. We both know that. But for her to do this after you were so clear with her about staying away -- it's -- this is supposed to be a happy time in your life, Hope. You're not supposed to be looking over your shoulder all the time, wondering what Quinn is gonna do next, and so I want you to know I put her on notice. If she ever comes near you again, if she so much as shows up in a place where she's not supposed to... I'm just saying I have your back. I'll never stop looking out for you, I'll never stop protecting you, and I will never, ever stop being concerned about you."
