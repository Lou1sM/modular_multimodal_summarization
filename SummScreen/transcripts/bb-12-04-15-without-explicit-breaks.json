        "Liam is devastated that Steffy told Wyatt. She said she had no intention but she had no choice. Liam said she did not give Ivy the chance to tell Wyatt on her own terms. It was Ivy's business to tell and now Wyatt is coming home and will probably toss her out on her ass. She had no right to interfere. Ivy tells Wyatt that Thomas had nothing to do with them. She is trying to find the right words to fix this but he won't let her try. He is important to her and she wants it to work. He still grills her why she turned to Thomas. They were in a committed relationship and he said he trusted Ivy and how devoted she was to him so he can not buy this that she was lost and could not fight the attraction. She cheated on him with Thomas. He goes berserk that she had more kisses with that spoiled little brat that hits on every female within sight. He does not have the answer to what Ivy can do now. Thomas tells Quinn that she is pushing hard being the matchmaker between Wyatt and Steffy. She says nothing against Liam but Wyatt would be a better fit. Pam rushes in and informs them there is an electrical fire backstage. She returns to her thoughts that Liam needs to be rescued from Steffy and Wyatt is just the man to do it. Jake goes with the repairman to look at the problem. Liam and Steffy happen along and they stay while Jake goes to show the repairman where the breakers are. Ivy says if she could take this back she would, but she can't. She says she hates that she hurt him and would do anything to make it right. She wants to deserve his trust. He says she should not even use the word trust around him. She always laughed it off about Thomas every time they talked. And he was only gone one night and she cheated on him. Ivy is disgusted that Steffy feels it was her duty to tell him. He tells her that if she wants Thomas, then she has him. He is not going to look over his shoulder and wonder about her every time Thomas or any new man comes into view.",
        "Steffy tells Liam that she just did what she thought was right. He is not asking for forgiveness; it is Ivy and Wyatt that is suffering. He wants her to do him a favor \u0096 just let the situation play out without doing or inciting the situation further. And in the meantime stay away from Ivy. Wyatt had taken a walk and finds Ivy gone when he gets home. Ivy makes a beeline to the office to have it out with Steffy. She hears about the electrical malfunction and heads there as the electricity zaps overhead. She finds Steffy and blasts her for telling Wyatt and twisting the truth and he has now walked out on her. Steffy tells her this is not about her; this is about Wyatt. Ivy betrayed him, not her. Steffy walks away and Ivy grabs her. Steffy shakes loose and tells her to get her hands off of her. Ivy takes Steffy's phone and throws it into the tangled wires. Steffy goes to retrieve it and Ivy is pushed and falls into it, electrocuted. Steffy cries for help."

        "Ivy: I messed up.",
        "Wyatt: You think?",
        "Ivy: This doesn't have to be the end. Please, d-don't give up on us.",
        "Wyatt: Why not? You did.",
        "Liam: You told Wyatt?",
        "Steffy: Yes.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I-I don't understand! Why?!",
        "Steffy: Ivy betrayed him. He needed to be told.",
        "Liam: Yes -- by Ivy!",
        "Steffy: I didn't want to be the one. Ivy had a chance to tell Wyatt, but I don't think she would have ever confessed, and that's not fair to Wyatt. Look, I had no intention of telling him, but Ivy gave me no choice.",
        "Liam: No choice?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: You had no choice?! Steffy, Steffy, you knew how important this was to me.",
        "Steffy: Ivy didn't tell him.",
        "Liam: You didn't give her the chance.",
        "Thomas: You're saying you don't mind if I end up with Ivy?",
        "Quinn: If you're a better match for her, sure.",
        "Thomas: A better match than your own son?",
        "Quinn: I'm not worried about Wyatt. He'll bounce back.",
        "Thomas: With Steffy.",
        "Thomas: You're pushing hard for this, aren't you -- matchmaking Steffy and Wyatt?",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no, no. It's not my place to play matchmaker. I'm just an observant mother who notices things, like how some people are better suited for each other than others.",
        "Thomas: Okay. Steffy and Liam?",
        "Quinn: Terrible.",
        "Thomas: Wyatt and Ivy?",
        "Quinn: Tolerable... if she really makes him happy. But Steffy... would be a better fit for him. And...nothing against Liam, but Wyatt...would be a better fit for your sister.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: You're angry.",
        "Liam: Oh, I am -- what did you expect, Steffy, after you did the exact thing I asked you not to do?",
        "Steffy: I thought you would trust my judgment.",
        "Liam: I thought you would trust mine! It was ivy's business to tell. That's exactly why she went over to his place. I was with her. She was preparing to tell him, and now what's gonna happen? What's gonna happen, Steffy? Wyatt is gonna come home seething, ready to toss Ivy out on her ass. You want to talk about fair? How is that fair? She deserved the chance to break it to him gently, to tell him her side of the story, and you robbed her of that. God! Why -- why do you have to interfere?!",
        "Ivy: I know that you're hurt. Please know that... this wasn't me giving up on us, okay? It actually had nothing -- it had nothing to do with us.",
        "Wyatt: What?! If you really believe that, I don't even think that I ever really knew it.",
        "Ivy: Don't say things like that. Don't say things like that! I'm trying to find the right words to fix things! I'm freaking out here! I don't know what to do!",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, I don't think you can fix it, so...",
        "Ivy: Well, can I at least try?",
        "Wyatt: Why?",
        "Ivy: Because you're important to me and I'm trying to figure out how to make this work.",
        "Wyatt: No, why... did you turn... to Thomas?",
        "Thomas: You've decided Wyatt and Steffy should be together.",
        "Quinn: I think that they would both be way better off.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Pam: Ridge, Steffy, you in he--",
        "Thomas: Uh...no.",
        "Pam: Darn. I was just hoping for an exec.",
        "Thomas: Is there something I can help you with?",
        "Pam: [Sighs] I don't think so. I just got a text from Jake, and he said that something terrible's happening backstage, like the electrical system is on fire or something.",
        "Thomas: Wait, wait, wait. What? What? What?",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Pam: Wait. Never mind. Good. Oh, Jake got in touch with Steffy, so we're good. Okay. Never mind. Carry on.",
        "Thomas: Huh.",
        "Pam: Would either of you care for a lemon bar?",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Thomas: No. No.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Thomas: Please tell me you did not start a fire backstage.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Thomas: Oh, come on. I've heard the stories.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Ha. No, I'm reformed.",
        "Thomas: Right, right, after everything you just told me about Liam.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Liam...is a goody-two-shoes, and he's as annoying as hell, but I'm not setting any fires around him.",
        "Thomas: Stabbing attempts, though.",
        "Quinn: Ohh.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: Well, you've done your homework. [Sighs] I have no ill will towards Liam the rescue ranger -- none. But I will say this -- some women need to be rescued. Your sister isn't one of them. But the one thing Steffy does need to be rescued from is Liam himself.",
        "Thomas: And you think Wyatt is the man to do that?",
        "[Electricity zaps] Whoa! Watch out! Let's go down there.",
        "Jake: Yeah. I was not exaggerating. Yeah. It's a good thing you called, actually.",
        "Jake: So, you can fix it? I think so.",
        "Steffy: I'm not avoiding the conversation. Let's just see what Jake's text is about, okay?",
        "Liam: All right. Fine.",
        "[Electricity zaps]",
        "Steffy: [Gasps]",
        "Liam: Oh. Okay. Know what they meant by \"problem backstage\" now.",
        "Steffy: Whoa! What the heck is going on? That, uh -- that's what I'm trying to figure out. First thing I need to do is cut the power, so can you show me where the main breaker is?",
        "Jake: Sure. Sure. You guys mind keeping a watch until we get back?",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah. No problem.",
        "Steffy: Sure. Sure. Okay. Just please make sure that nobody gets near this, because it's very dangerous.",
        "Liam: Yeah, of course. No problem.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Yeah.",
        "Jake: Okay. This way.",
        "Liam: Thank you guys. You got it.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Are you laughing right now?",
        "Steffy: I'm just thinking about the lightning storm the other night. And now we're guarding this possessed, shorted-out board. I'm just saying, you know, even when you're mad at me, we still have electricity between us, right?",
        "Liam: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: Right?",
        "Liam: You're ridiculous. [Electricity zaps] Okay. We're going. This is it.",
        "Wyatt: If you really loved me and you loved spending time with me and if I meant anything to you at all, why would you ever look twice at Thomas -- or any man, for that matter?",
        "Ivy: I don't know.",
        "Wyatt: Not good enough, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: What do you want me to say? What's the right answer here? Yes, there was an attraction. Is that it?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. He's good-looking. He's good-looking, isn't he? But so is every other model that walks through Forrester. But I'm in what I would like to think of as a committed relationship, which means I don't let my attractions dictate the choices that I make. You know what I was saying to my mom when we were in san Francisco and you were too busy kissing Mr. Abs?",
        "Quinn: Don't do that.",
        "Wyatt: She asked if I was worried -- if I was worried about Thomas flirting with you, if I was concerned that the two of you were spending the night together alone under the same roof, and you know what I said? I said, \"I trust her.\" I told her how good you were to me, how loyal and devoted you were to me.",
        "Ivy: I'm still that person.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Ivy: Yes. I-I just -- I was a little lost.",
        "Wyatt: Lost?! Again you were lost?! I mean, I believed it the first time, after everything that happened with Aly and the attack on Steffy and the blackmail. But I guess it's no anomaly, is it? Because you're lost again. You -- you cheated on me with Thomas! And I bet that wasn't the first time. It wasn't the only night, right? There were more nights?",
        "Ivy: There were a couple of other kisses.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God! Seriously?! Do you want to be with an entitled, spoiled little brat?!",
        "Ivy: No!",
        "Wyatt: He just wants to sleep around, and that's what you want?! You want to be with a guy who's just gonna have a one-night stand with you?!",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, I don't want to be with him! I want to be with you! I'm in love with you! That's what I'm trying to tell you! Just tell me what to do!",
        "Wyatt: I don't know.",
        "Quinn: I think Wyatt understands Steffy better than Liam does. That's all.",
        "Thomas: You might be right. And maybe if things don't work out for Ivy and Wyatt...",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas: ...Maybe your wish for Steffy and Wyatt can come true.",
        "[Electricity zapping]",
        "Steffy: [Gasps]",
        "Liam: They've got to get that under control.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Look, do you still want to talk about this?",
        "Liam: I don't even know what there is to talk about. You went against my wishes right after telling me you wouldn't.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] [Gasps]",
        "Liam: Must have had to cut the power.",
        "Steffy: Could have been our moment.",
        "Liam: Are you kidding me right now?",
        "Steffy: I'm playing with you. I'm just playing.",
        "Liam: Well, don't. Don't joke. Don't do anything.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Of course. You're the hero.",
        "Liam: That's not -- there you go again, doing the same thing. Typical Steffy.",
        "Steffy: And you know what? Ivy doesn't even need protecting. She needs protecting from herself. She's the one that cheated on Wyatt. And if it's any consolation, it's not like I blurted it out. I tried to avoid it, and Wyatt just pulled it out of me. Should that have happened? They found the breaker?",
        "Liam: None of this should have happened.",
        "Ivy: I know what I did was wrong. I know that. Wyatt, if I could take this back, I would, but I can't. I can't do that, but what I can do is promise you that it will never happen again. You have to trust me.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, \"trust\" isn't a word you should be using right about now.",
        "Ivy: I've hurt you, and I'm sorry. But I will do anything to figure this out -- anything. I want to deserve your trust again. I know it's gonna take a lot of work, but I don't want to lose you.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, I-I was gone for one night -- one night -- and then you turned to Thomas.",
        "Ivy: I know what I'm asking of you is huge.",
        "Wyatt: You're asking me to constantly look over my shoulder, is what you're asking me to do -- wonder if some guy that you're attracted to is just gonna say one nice thing and it's gonna get you into bed.",
        "Ivy: No! Come on, Wyatt!",
        "Wyatt: I thought we had something.",
        "Ivy: We do.",
        "Wyatt: After all that crap that you went through with Liam, you wanted a relationship that was based on honesty just as much as I did.",
        "Ivy: I do want that.",
        "Wyatt: Really? You knew that I was upset about what Thomas was doing -- flirting with you. But you just laughed it off. You made me feel like there was nothing wrong, that you had absolutely no interest in him. And that was being honest with me?",
        "Ivy: I didn't even think I realized at the time.",
        "Wyatt: And then you didn't even have the decency to tell me! I had to find out from Steffy, of all people!",
        "Ivy: Wait. What did you just say? Did you say Steffy told you?",
        "Wyatt: Yes. Thankfully, yes. She let me in on the whole situation 'cause she's looking out for me.",
        "Ivy: Steffy told you?! I told her not to say anything.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Ivy: Oh, my God. I told her to stay out of this and that you needed to hear this from me first.",
        "Wyatt: Are you seriously upset at Steffy for something you did?!",
        "Ivy: This is none of her business, Wyatt!",
        "Wyatt: She is my friend. She was looking out for me -- something you're not doing right about now.",
        "Ivy: It is completely self-serving, what she's doing. Why does no one see this?! This girl doesn't like me! She went to you first because she didn't want me to have a chance to do it the right way.",
        "Wyatt: Wow.",
        "Ivy: Don't let her win this, Wyatt. Don't. Don't let this end because of her.",
        "Wyatt: She's not the one doing that.",
        "Ivy: Oh, and I am?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Ivy: Ohh!",
        "Wyatt: I will not share you with Thomas or any other man, for that matter. I'm not gonna wonder who you're thinking about when you're with me.",
        "Ivy: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Wyatt: You want Thomas?! You got him.",
        "Liam: I just -- I thought you were done with all the animosity.",
        "Steffy: I'm trying, Liam.",
        "Liam: Well, okay. See, you say that, and then you turn around and you do something like this. So, you tell me, what am I supposed to think right now?",
        "Steffy: I'm -- I'm just doing what -- what I thought was right.",
        "Liam: I know. I know.",
        "Steffy: Forgive me?",
        "Liam: It's not me you should be asking for forgiveness, Steffy. I mean, Ivy and Wyatt are the ones suffering right now.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Judging by his reaction, I'm guessing their relationship is over. [Gasps]",
        "Liam: There it goes again.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: J-- look, just -- just do me a favor.",
        "Steffy: Huh? Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Liam: Let the situation play out however it's gonna play out, okay? Don't get involved. Don't say anything. Don't do anything. Don't incite the situation.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Liam: One more thing.",
        "Steffy: Hmm?",
        "Liam: In the meantime, you should probably stay away from Ivy. No, I mean it. Stay away from her.",
        "Ivy: Pam, is Steffy in her office?",
        "Pam: Uh, nope. She's backstage. She's dealing with some electrical malfunction.",
        "Ivy: Okay, good. Well, if you need me, that's where I'll be -- dealing with Steffy's personality malfunction.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy?",
        "[Electricity zaps]",
        "Steffy: That's so weird. [Sighs]",
        "[Electricity zaps]",
        "Steffy: [Gasps]",
        "Ivy: Hi, Steffy. What are you doing here all by yourself? Are you trying to plot who else to break up?",
        "Steffy: Did you and Wyatt break up?",
        "Ivy: You just couldn't resist, could you? You couldn't let go of the opportunity to potentially hurt me.",
        "Steffy: I didn't plan on telling him, and I certainly didn't want to hurt you.",
        "Ivy: Oh, okay. Sure.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt had the right to know.",
        "Ivy: From me.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[Electricity zaps]",
        "Ivy: Look, if I'd had the opportunity to tell him first, I could have explained things better.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but I had to tell him the truth.",
        "Ivy: He got your twisted version of the truth, which resulted in him walking out on me.",
        "Steffy: Okay. I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Ivy: Oh, really? Are you?",
        "Steffy: But this is not my responsibility. That's on you.",
        "Ivy: Obviously, I made a mistake, Steffy. But when you found out, you were so quick to confront me, and you just couldn't wait to blab it to Wyatt.",
        "Steffy: You know what? I'm gonna leave. I was waiting for Jake, but I'm gonna go. You just stay here.",
        "Ivy: You're actually enjoying this, aren't you? You love watching me get hurt.",
        "Steffy: This isn't about you, Ivy. This is about Wyatt! He doesn't deserve being lied to by his girlfriend. So do not blame me. Just take responsibility. You betrayed him, not me.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] [Sighs] Listen to what I'm trying to tell you.",
        "Steffy: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Get your hands off of me!",
        "Ivy: Oh, come on!",
        "Steffy: I am done talking to you. I have nothing left to say to you. You cheated on Wyatt. You're a liar. And what's so crazy is that you think you're so innocent when you're really not. You're not.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, because you're so innocent?",
        "Steffy: I'm not -- I have to watch. You go.",
        "Ivy: You took Liam off me without consideration to our relationship. You're trying to take Wyatt. You took Aly.",
        "Steffy: Just leave me alone.",
        "Ivy: Just listen to what I'm saying! It's like you get pleasure from trying to hurt me!",
        "Steffy: Do you not realize how this is so dangerous right now?!",
        "Ivy: You just push me and you push me. It's like your whole...",
        "Steffy: You're so immature, Ivy!",
        "Ivy: ...Is to just ruin my life!",
        "Steffy: No! No! This is not funny!",
        "Ivy: [Gasps]",
        "[Electricity zapping]",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God! [Breathing heavily] Ivy. Ivy! [Whimpers] [Gasps] Somebody!! Somebody help me!! Somebody!! Ivy! Ivy, wake up! Ivy! Ohh! Ivy, wake up! Somebody help me!! Somebody!!"
