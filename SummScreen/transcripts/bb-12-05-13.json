        "Hope drops in at Liam's office but only finds Katie. She says she thinks Liam left for the day. Aly drops by unannounced at Liam's Malibu house. He invites her in and she immediately apologizes for sending him the photo. She says she realized it was a big mistake the minute she sent it. It was so totally not her business. She just thinks he is such a good guy and knows how much he loves Hope and thought he should know. She hopes he is not too weirded out. He retorts that the only one he is weirded by is his brother. She corrects \u0096 half brother. Quinn and Wyatt are taking a break on the rooftop at FC. Wyatt is looking through the pictures from the photo shoot and commenting on how gorgeous Hope is. Quinn agrees and says he is so much better for Hope than Liam. Wyatt just needs to be patient and she will see this, so don't give up on Hope. Wyatt says Liam will just have to accept that he isn't going anywhere. Quinn replies that he certainly wasn't too pleased that they were invited to Thanksgiving dinner. And she adds neither was Bill for that matter. Wyatt says oh, he thought it kind of nice that he was seeing his parents at the same table for the first time. She says and that will be the first and last time. He is oddly okay with that. Quinn tells him that Hope created a very special evening. Wyatt comments that everything Hope does is special. Quinn says he feels good in the position they are in now. She feels they are in a unique place with their business expanding and their lives have changed. They can not lose this opportunity. Wyatt says why would they? They are just getting the ball rolling. There is no limit where the two of them can go from here. Katie tells Hope that she had a talk with Liam earlier and it seems he is getting a little impatient. Hope says she knows, she feels badly but she doesn't know what to do. Katie points out that she has been spending a lot of time with Wyatt. Hope puts that more in the work category. Katie says she thinks Liam sees if differently. Hope says she has been completely honest with Liam. She wants to focus on her work. She needs that time especially after all he put her through with Steffy. And she thinks that deep down Liam knows that too. With her line doing so well it would be foolish to give that up. She likes her life right now and thinking of herself first. She has to give some credit to Wyatt too and now Aly is on board, her little shadow who is so sweet. Hope says Aly is shy and she doesn't think she has dated much, so she'd like to show her around and have some fun and help bring her out of her shell. She does speak her mind though. She had told Hope that she thought she was stringing Liam along and knew that Wyatt was really into her. So just how long was she going to wait before marrying Liam. Hope says she tried to explain but she didn't think she was old enough or experienced enough to understand. Katie says don't get her wrong. She likes both Wyatt and Liam a lot, but she's been with Liam for so long and wanted to get married for a long time. Now she can; Steffy is gone. There is nothing standing in the way.",
        "Hope tells Katie that Wyatt cares about her. He's spontaneous and gorgeous and has no Steffy baggage. He's fun and she likes being with him so tell her what is wrong with that. Katie says nothing but does she love him or ever see herself married to him. Hope says she is not sure she wants to marry anyone right now. She was ready a few times and Liam wasn't. She's not trying to hurt him now or punish him, but she doesn't think it is asking too much to have a little patience. Katie responds that life is about balance. She has Will and this company but she is lonely. She knows it is exciting being with Wyatt but Liam is struggling and she doesn't want to see her lose him. Hope says she doesn't think it will come to that. Maybe they will get married but in the meanwhile Liam will be okay. She thinks he will understand and be willing to wait until she is ready. Liam confides in Aly that Hope has made it clear they are not in a committed relationship so she can pretty well do what she wants. She says when she saw Wyatt kissing Hope she over re-acted. Liam says please don't give it another thought. And that kiss wasn't the first one. Wyatt has done it a lot .once right there and he punched him. Aly says she is not surprised that they'd be fighting over Hope, she is amazing. He agrees and adds that he is 100% committed but there is only so much a guy can take and something has got to give. He gets a text that a buddy can't make it over to hit a few balls. He's been trying to improve his tennis game as it relieves a little stress. Aly volunteers that she can help hit him a few. He declines and says it really needs to be a guy hitting some pretty intense balls out there. She says she has clothes out in the car so they should go for it. He finally agrees and says he will meet her out on the court. Liam starts with some fairly easy lobs across the net. Aly misses a lot of them and he keeps saying it is okay. Then he lets her serve. Within a minute she is whizzing them past him. He goes to the net and says he is being hustled. He chuckles while throwing the racket down and says he is finished; he has been hustled. Wyatt tells Quinn that Liam is living up there in his big old mansion and he's used to getting everything that he wants. But Hope has said she is not ready so Wyatt is not being too pushy but he is starting to think that might be a big mistake. He needs to do something. He wants to be respectful of Hope's feelings but he can't just sit by and not do anything especially while Liam is pouting. Quinn says that Wyatt knows her motto. You don't get anywhere in life if you don't take risks or be proactive. You have to go after what you want. He says he wants Hope. There is nothing he is more sure of. He just has to figure it out. He needs to plan something special and romantic and memorable for Hope like when he took her to Mexico for the diamond. Aly brings up the picture again. She says Liam is so sweet and funny .most guys aren't like him. She starts to say if she were Hope .then she stops and says forget everything she said. Liam chuckles and says it is forgotten. He looks out over the water and she just stares at his profile."

        "Katie: Well, maybe to Liam, it seems like more.",
        "Hope: Well...[Sighs] I've been completely honest with Liam. I have. He knows that I want to focus on my line right now. It has to be my number-one priority. I need this time. I need it, especially after everything he put me through with Steffy. I think, deep down, Liam knows that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hope has made it very clear that we're not in a committed relationship right now, so she can kind of do what she wants.",
        "Aly: When I saw Wyatt kissing her, I just didn't think it was fair to you, and I overreacted.",

        "Liam: Yeah, she is. She's -- she's spectacular. I-I mean, I can't say this whole thing isn't -- isn't frustrating, but she's enjoying the attention, and I get that. But I am 100% committed to her, and -- and there's only so much a guy can take, so something's got to give, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Aly: Oh, yeah. I-I saw the tennis court outside -- hard to miss.",

        "Quinn: ...At Eric Forrester's house... [Chuckles] ...Was a defining moment for us.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Quinn: I mean, I really feel like we're part of something unique. You know, our business -- it's expanded exponentially. Our lives have changed. [Sighs] We cannot lose this opportunity.",
        "Wyatt: Why would we? Mom, we are just getting the ball rolling. Things are starting to happen for us. [Sighs] There is no limit to where you and I can go from here.",

        "Katie: I'm so proud of you -- everything you've accomplished.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Katie: I mean, Hope for the Future is leading the industry. It's the number- one-selling line in your demographic. Things must be going so well over at the company.",
        "Hope: I know. It's -- it's crazy. I mean, what if I never get another opportunity like this? It -- it would be so silly of me not to make the most of it. As much as I love Liam, I like where my life is right now. I like that I'm putting myself first.",
        "Katie: It feels good, doesn't it?",
        "Hope: It feels wonderful. Although I have to give some of the credit to Wyatt. He has some brilliant ideas. I mean, the diamond -- that -- that was a huge success.",

        "Katie: Well, she should. She's a smart girl.",
        "Hope: She's so cute, and she's shy. You know, I don't think she's dated a whole lot, so I'm -- I'm hoping to bring her out of her shell -- you know, teach her how to have a little fun.",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Okay, so I-I brought you a racket.",
        "Aly: I might be a little rusty.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] No, don't worry about it. It's easy. It's all about setting up early and moving your feet and just having a good follow-through.",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Liam: Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Well, Liam doesn't see it that way.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, Liam doesn't see anything he doesn't want to see his way. He likes being in his big fantasy world in his big beach house. You know, he can't believe that Hope isn't bending over backwards to marry him right now.",
        "Quinn: I hope she realizes what a big mistake that would be.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, well, she hasn't admitted it, but she knows Liam isn't good for her. She has to. Otherwise, she'd be walking down the aisle with him as we speak.",
        "Quinn: Well, Liam's video to Steffy put an end to that.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: Looks like indefinitely.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Oh, hey, Robin. Would you mind taking these down to Eric? Tell him I'm doing just a few adjustments but that I'm open to his ideas.",
        "Robin: Yeah, of course.",
        "Quinn: Thanks.",
        "Robin: Sure.",
        "Wyatt: Look, Hope's made it very clear that she isn't ready, at least when it comes to Liam. [Chuckles] I could literally feel his frustration.",
        "Quinn: Oh, it was palpable at dinner.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you could cut the tension with a carving knife.",
        "Quinn: It's a shame, you know? I mean, all that time she wasted, waiting for Liam to get over Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: You think he could return the favor, right? Be understanding.",
        "Wyatt: Well, he's used to getting what he wants. Look, Hope said that she needs time to herself, and that's why I'm -- I'm playing it cool. I'm not being too pushy. But I'm starting to think that that might be a mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Don't get me wrong -- Aly's not afraid to express her opinion.",
        "Katie: Really? What'd she say?",
        "Hope: Oh, she -- she pulled me aside at the photo shoot and told me that she was afraid that I was stringing Liam along.",
        "Katie: Wow. That's rather bold.",
        "Hope: But she was cute about it. She said she couldn't help but notice how bummed Liam looked at dinner.",
        "Katie: Mm.",
        "Hope: ...And how obvious it is that Wyatt is into me. She asked me how long I was planning on making Liam wait before I married him. I-I tried to explain the situation to her as best I could, but I don't think she's old enough or has experienced enough to understand it.",
        "Katie: Well, maybe she has a point. Don't get me wrong -- I like Wyatt. I like Liam, but you've been in love with Liam for so long, and he's always the one that you've wanted to marry, and now you can. Steffy's gone. Nothing's standing in your way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You ready?",
        "Aly: Yep.",
        "Liam: This one's gonna be soft. It's okay. It's okay. You'll get another one. That's okay. It's okay. We'll get there. Oh, good job. Good job. Better -- better job than me -- That's what that was. That -- yep. All right. No problem. You serve me. Why don't you serve me? That'll be -- that'll be fun. Okay! That's -- [Grunts]",

        "Liam: Okay. What was that?",
        "Aly: I'm sorry.",
        "Liam: You're -- you're hustling me.",
        "Aly: No. [Chuckles]",

        "Wyatt: I got to make a move with Hope. I mean, I want to be respectful of her feelings, but I can't just sit by and not do anything, especially while Liam's pouting.",
        "Quinn: You know my motto. You don't get anywhere in life without taking risks and being proactive.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: You have to go after what you want.",
        "Wyatt: And I want to be with Hope. There is nothing I am more sure of. I just got to figure it out. I got to plan something special -- something romantic -- to show her how I really feel about her.",
        "Quinn: What are you thinking?",
        "Wyatt: Well, it has to be meaningful.",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Taking her to Mexico to get that diamond was an unforgettable experience. She still talks about it. I got to do something big like that again. I just have to make it beautiful and memorable for Hope and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Wyatt cares about me. He's spontaneous and gorgeous, and he doesn't have any Steffy baggage. And -- and I enjoy his company. We have so much fun together. So, tell me -- tell me what's wrong with that?",
        "Katie: Nothing, but do you love him? Could you see yourself marrying him?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] I don't -- I don't know if I want to marry anyone right now.",
        "Katie: Well, you know what I'm talking about.",
        "Hope: The thing is, yeah, I-I always pictured marrying Liam. I always thought that he would be my husband someday. I was ready a few times, but he wasn't, because of Steffy. I'm not trying to hurt him. I'm not trying to punish him. But I-I-I don't think it's asking too much for some patience.",
        "Katie: I understand what you're saying, but life is about balance. I mean, look at me -- I've got Will. I've got this place. But it's lonely. I know that the attention that Wyatt's giving you is exciting, it's new, and it's so easy to get drawn into that, but at what price? Liam is trying to be understanding, but he's struggling, and I know how much you care about him. I don't want to see you lose him.",
        "Hope: Well, I-I don't -- I don't think it'll come to that. I mean, yeah, Liam's a little discouraged right now, but he'll get through it. He'll be okay. Who knows? Maybe it will happen. Maybe -- maybe we will get married, but I think that Liam will be okay with giving me the time until I'm ready.",
