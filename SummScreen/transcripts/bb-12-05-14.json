        "Despite Hope knowing that Quinn was at the baby shower, Liam sits Hope down and says he is not going to let Quinn anywhere near her. She thinks that is so weird; where was Quinn? Liam says he is thinking about hiring someone, some security as he is not going to let Quinn stalk her and right now that is exactly what she is doing. Quinn is looking at the ultrasound and tells Deacon that is as close as she is going to get to that child. Deacon says Liam was here and accusing her of being at the shower. Quinn does not want to be questioned but she does beg Deacon to please talk to Hope. She just wants to be part of that family. Deacon says he will do what he can. Wyatt tells Bill that he wishes there was some other way than the restraining order for Quinn. Bill says she doesn't have to like it, but she does have to accept it. Patience is not her strong suit .nor Bill's. Wyatt says that must be where he gets his from. He just wants to fix this. He can't let his wife live in terror like this. Bill says no, it is not good for a pregnant woman or the baby either. Hope tells Liam that she appreciates his caring about her and wanting to help, but confronting Quinn at her place was not the smartest thing he might do. He says he knows but he does not want to see Hope hurt. Deacon calls but Hope says she is with Liam and can't talk now. Liam tells her that Deacon is living with Quinn so she can't tell him too much. He makes her promise that she won't try to confront Quinn by herself. Right now all that matters is that she is left alone and has a healthy baby. He will take care of Quinn.",
        "Quinn gets it out of Deacon that he called Hope but she had company and it probably was Liam. Deacon warns her to stay away from Hope until that baby is born. She has to show Hope she respects her privacy. Justin gives the restraining order to Wyatt, a 30 days one and it is not effective until he serves it to Quinn. Bill tells him to give it to her and leave, no discussion. Hope puts her jacket on, picks up her purse and is about to leave. At the front door stand Quinn with those big innocent eyes. Liam goes to Bill and complains about Quinn being at CakeGate. Bill informs him he just might get his wish as Justin has given papers to Wyatt and he is delivering them as they speak. Wyatt only finds Deacon at Quinn's. Deacon is evasive but finally admits that Quinn is not there. Wyatt explains that he will find out soon enough, but he is serving a restraining order on Quinn. Hope tries to close the door on Quinn, but Quinn begs her just for a minute for her to explain. She walks on in and says she knows it is Liam. She has done some very regrettable things. Hope is in an outrage when she realizes that Quinn was at the baby shower spying on them, after sneaking into Eric's house somehow. Quinn is frantic that Hope understands and will let her show her that she does have a heart and restraint. Hope gets more agitated that Quinn can even use that word restraint when she can not obey the simple fact that neither she nor Wyatt want to see her. Three times she asks Quinn to leave her house. Quinn still wants to explain and says perhaps they should go out in the garden and discuss this more. She heads that way and Hope follows. Wyatt calls Bill and says he tried to serve the papers but Quinn was not home. Bill tells him to wait for her. As soon as Liam hears Quinn is not at home, he makes a mad dash for the door. He tries to call Hope to warn her but just gets voicemail. He leaves a message to watch her back, Quinn may be coming. Hope follows Quinn and tells her to leave the property. Quinn says Hope needs to calm down so they can have a rational conversation. She just wants her to know she will not bother her anymore. Hope says she could have phoned that to her or e-mailed, but okay thank you, now she knows and can go. Quinn walks away, Hope sits down for about 20 seconds and gets up to go back in the house when her high heeled shoe sticks in a concrete crack and she tumbles all the way down a flight of concrete stairs and lands hitting her head at the bottom. She lays unconscious. Quinn turns around to see this and calls out Hope's name."

        "Liam: I'm thinking about hiring someone.",
        "Hope: Who?",
        "Liam: Security.",
        "Hope: You -- you mean like a guard to follow me around?",
        "Liam: Well, I'm not gonna let the woman stalk you. And right now, that's exactly what she's doing.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: Hey, babe. Got you something from the food truck.",
        "Quinn: Thanks.",
        "Deacon: What's the matter? Ah, the ultrasound.",
        "Quinn: It's the closest I'm gonna get to this child.",
        "Deacon: Well, it's the closest anyone's gonna get because the kid isn't born yet. So, you had a visitor. Liam.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I know. He was here when I arrived.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, he thought maybe you were gonna crash the, uh, shower.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, he was all over me about that.",
        "Deacon: So, was he right? Did you go?",
        "Bill: Good, Justin. The restraining order's filed? Great. Get it over here.",
        "Wyatt: He got it?",
        "Bill: He's on his way with it.",
        "Wyatt: Mom's not gonna like this.",
        "Bill: She doesn't have to like it. She just has to get the message.",
        "Wyatt: I just wish there was some other way.",
        "Bill: Look, Wyatt, you -- you have talked to her and talked to her to no avail.",
        "Wyatt: She just wants to be a part of the family, Dad.",
        "Bill: And Hope wants the opposite. Can you blame her, Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Wyatt: If only she'd back off...",
        "Bill: Your mother doesn't know what that means.",
        "Wyatt: I know! A couple of months! That's all it would take! Just stay away and let Hope settle in!",
        "Bill: Patience isn't her strong suit. Of course, it's not mine, either.",
        "Wyatt: I guess that's where I get it. I just want to fix this.",
        "Bill: You are fixing it, with the restraining order!",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but it's just -- it's so extreme, Dad.",
        "Bill: Wyatt, do you have any other ideas?",
        "Wyatt: No. I can't have my wife living in --",
        "Bill: Terror?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Pretty much.",
        "Bill: Not good for a pregnant woman.",
        "Wyatt: Which is why I have to do this. I need to keep her away from my wife.",
        "Bill: I agree. Hope needs to be protected.",
        "Wyatt: Even if it is from my own mother. Great.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Deacon, please don't question me.",
        "Deacon: You did, didn't you? You crashed the -- the shower.",
        "Quinn: Grandmother has every right to be at her daughter-in-law's baby shower.",
        "Deacon: Then Hope threw you out, didn't she?",
        "Quinn: Hope didn't throw me out.",
        "Deacon: Okay, so what happened?",
        "Quinn: Who said I was there?",
        "Deacon: [Chuckling] Oh, yeah, you were there. Yeah, you were, like, looking in the windows or doing something creepy.",
        "Quinn: I wouldn't stoop to that.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, don't you see how counterproductive this is? I mean, it's like every time you go near Hope, you take 10 steps backwards.",
        "Quinn: It's only because of that heartsick, little puppy dog who keeps following her around. You know what I would do to Liam if I --",
        "Deacon: Stop. Stop. Stop right there! That's exactly the kind of talk that's gonna get you a 51/50 again.",
        "Quinn: It's my family. I want to be a part of their lives. Deacon, please. Please help me talk to your daughter. You can get through to her. Please.",
        "Deacon: I'll see what I can do, Quinn.",
        "Liam: I talked to your dad.",
        "Hope: Uh, when?",
        "Liam: When I went over to see Quinn, um, he was there.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] You -- you have no idea how much I appreciate how protective you're being, but I want you to be really careful. Going over to Quinn's may not be the best idea. Out of everybody, she hates you the most.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, I'm not backing down, but -- but she's your mother-in-law, Hope. I mean, you're the one who has to be careful. I don't want to see you hurt.",
        "Hope: Well, I know that you have to go to work, so thank you for stopping by, and thank you for being concerned.",
        "Liam: I'll never stop being concerned.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Hope: [Clears throat] Sorry. Hello?",

        "Deacon: You free? I need to talk to you.",
        "Hope: No, I'm not. Um, is it important?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, kind of. Uh, where are you?",
        "Hope: Mom's.",
        "Deacon: Are you alone?",
        "Hope: No, I'm with Liam. Um, um, but, look, actually, I got to go, so maybe I'll call you tonight if I have time.",
        "Deacon: Okay, honey. I love you.",
        "Hope: Bye.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you can't -- you can't be doing that.",
        "Hope: What?",

        "Hope: Oh, God, you're right, you're right.",
        "Liam: You just have to be careful. You just can't take anything for granted, that's all.",
        "Hope: You know, when I think about the fact that Quinn was probably at my baby shower, I just feel... I don't know what I'm gonna do, Liam. I don't know what I'm gonna do if she tries to come near this baby.",
        "Liam: Okay, well, don't confront her. You leave Quinn to me, right?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Hope: You know, you're wrong.",
        "Liam: About what?",
        "Hope: There is one thing I can take for granted. You. You're always gonna be here for me.",
        "Liam: I always have been. This -- this baby. This -- this baby is really all that matters. You giving birth to a happy, healthy child. And she will be. She will. Or he.",

        "Hope: Thank you. [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Hey. Hey, did you do it? Did you set up the meeting with Hope?",
        "Deacon: I tried.",
        "Quinn: What do you mean, you tried?",
        "Deacon: She couldn't talk.",
        "Quinn: Why? Was she at work?",
        "Deacon: No, no, she was -- she was home. She was at Brooke's place.",
        "Quinn: Then why couldn't she talk?",
        "Deacon: She had someone over at her place. I-I --",
        "Quinn: Well, who?",
        "Deacon: I don't -- does it matter?",
        "Quinn: Oh, man, it was Liam, wasn't it? [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: Okay, listen.",
        "Quinn: Come on. That little snit -- every time Wyatt goes to work, he shows up.",
        "Deacon: Will you relax?",
        "Quinn: He was probably there filling her head with garbage about me.",
        "Deacon: Okay, enough, baby. Enough, all right? Listen to me. I talked to her. She's gonna call me tonight, okay? I mean, we've got, what, months before the kid's born? Trust me. This is -- this is -- it's all gonna work out.",
        "Quinn: All right. Okay. You know what? Maybe I was -- I was overreacting. All right. You know what? I'm just -- I'll just keep doing really nice things for her.",
        "Deacon: No! No! You're gonna -- you're not gonna do anything for her. You are gonna stay away from her until that child is born. Do you understand that Hope's biggest fear is that you're gonna be stalking her or something? You know, we've got show her that you're gonna respect her privacy, okay?",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",
        "Quinn: Okay, I'm gonna respect her privacy.",
        "Deacon: Okay. Thank you.",

        "Justin: This is good for 30 days, then it has to be renewed.",
        "Bill: Only 30 days?",
        "Justin: We had to fast-track it. We're lucky we got anything at all.",
        "Wyatt: No, no. A 30-day restraining order is fine for now.",
        "Justin: It doesn't take effect until you serve it to Quinn.",
        "Wyatt: Which I'm going to do right now.",
        "Bill: Give it to her and leave. No discussion.",
        "Wyatt: It's gonna be a shock for her. I got to help her digest it, Dad.",
        "Bill: No, you really don't. And call me if you need some moral support, all right?",
        "Wyatt: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Bill: Good luck.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Are you hungry, little one? I know Mommy is. What do you say we go get some food? What are you thinking? Maybe like a hamburger or... no, you wouldn't want that. We're gonna do fruit and yogurt and something very healthy for you. [Gasps] What are you doing here?",
        "Singer: When our song came on, I was thinking of you miles from home on highway 82 You cranked up the tune and let it blast I didn't care if you drove too fast Rock and roll makes me lose control I got you by my side you plus me can't get hotter than that All this heat is on So, baby, shine, let it shine h-o-t-t hotter than that h-o-t-t hotter than that",
        "Bill: So, is this a holiday, Liam? I don't think it's a holiday.",
        "Liam: I know. I know.",
        "Bill: So where have you been?",
        "Liam: Listen, I want to talk to you about Quinn...",
        "Bill: [Groans]",
        "Liam: ...Because she was told -- listen. She was told to stay away from Hope's baby shower.",
        "Bill: She was there?",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm almost certain. We -- we have evidence. There's this piece of cake that was served, and yeah.",
        "Bill: What is this? Cakegate?",
        "Liam: Dad, I want Quinn out of Hope's life permanently.",
        "Bill: Well, you may be about to get your wish. Justin got a restraining order.",
        "Liam: Has she been served?",
        "Bill: She's about to be. Your brother's on his way over to see her right now.",
        "Wyatt: Mom's not here?",
        "Deacon: Nope. You want a drink?",
        "Wyatt: Nope. Where is she?",
        "Deacon: Well, she was down at the workshop hammering out a piece of jewelry for your beautiful wife. Come on, Wyatt. She -- she does want to play nice.",
        "Wyatt: It's a little late in the game for that.",
        "Deacon: Is it?",
        "Wyatt: You know the history, deacon.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, but I also know that she wants to do right.",
        "Wyatt: And I want that, too. But she can't get that by harassing Hope.",
        "Deacon: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Harassing?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, she needs to stay away from her, at least for now. Look, I'm gonna go find her in the work room. Thanks, but no thanks.",
        "Deacon: She's not there.",
        "Wyatt: I thought you just said that she was down there.",
        "Deacon: Well, I just checked, and she's not. Look, maybe she went out for some coffee or something, all right? Why do you want to talk to her, anyway?",
        "Wyatt: She's my mother. Do I need a reason?",
        "Deacon: I don't suppose it has anything to do with that envelope in your hands, now, does it?",
        "Wyatt: I guess you're gonna find out sooner or later. I'm serving her papers.",
        "Deacon: What kind of papers?",
        "Wyatt: A restraining order to keep her away from Hope.",
        "Deacon: [Exhales sharply]",
        "Quinn: I just want to talk.",
        "Hope: Quinn, no.",
        "Quinn: Oh, please, Hope! Just for a couple of minutes.",
        "Hope: What do you not understand? Wyatt and I don't want you around. You are not welcome.",
        "Quinn: It's Liam. He hates me, and, look, I completely understand. I have done some really regrettable things.",
        "Hope: Liam thinks that you were at my baby shower. Were you? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You were. Oh, my God! How did you even get into Eric's house?!",
        "Quinn: I-I snuck in. I-I did -- I watched from the top of the landing.",
        "Hope: Oh, my gosh!",
        "Quinn: Well, it's my first grandchild! And -- and it's a baby shower! How can I not be there?",
        "Hope: You -- you can't be there because you don't deserve to be there! You've done too many things!",
        "Quinn: But I just wanted to see all the presents you got for the baby. Hope, you looked so happy.",
        "Hope: Stop it, Quinn. Stop it!",
        "Quinn: I wanted to show you that I have a heart, that I could show restraint!",
        "Hope: Restraint?!",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Restraint would be respecting my wishes! You're obviously not doing that!",
        "Quinn: No, no! That's exactly why I'm here right now!",
        "Hope: What?! You're a threat. You're a threat to me, to my family, to my baby. Get out of my house!",
        "Quinn: I'm not, but okay.",
        "Hope: Quinn, go!",
        "Quinn: I'm going to leave. I will. I just want to tell you this one last thing.",
        "Hope: Oh, damn it!",
        "Quinn: No, please, plea. I just want to have --",
        "Hope: Get off my property!",
        "Quinn: Just calm down. You know what? I'll tell you this. Maybe -- maybe it'll be better if we go talk in the garden, okay?",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Quinn: Come on. Let's just go talk outside.",
        "Hope: What are you -- God!",
        "Liam: So Wyatt is serving his own mother with a restraining order.",
        "Bill: As we speak, I believe.",
        "Liam: Well, that's gonna be fun.",
        "Bill: Your brother knows it has toe done.",
        "Liam: Yeah, and he's right, 'cause more and more, that woman is o of control.",
        "Bill: I agree. So, how is Hope? I assume that's why you weren't at work today.",
        "Liam: Yeah, um, you know, she needs a lot of support lately.",
        "Bill: She has something called a husband, Liam.",
        "Liam: Yeah, Dad. She also has a really good friend who's never going to abandon her, not as long as Eva Braun is on the loose. [Cell phone rings",
        "Bill: Wyatt. Hey, what's going on? Did you serve her with the papers?",
        "Wyatt: Not yet. She isn't here.",
        "Bill: Where is she?",
        "Wyatt: Don't know. She must have stepped out.",
        "Bill: All right, well, wait for her. And call me and let me know how it went.",

        "Liam: Hope.",
        "Deacon: Seriously? A restraining order?",
        "Wyatt: She doesn't listen.",
        "Deacon: So you went to a judge? Come on, man. It's your mother.",
        "Wyatt: And Hope is my wife! Your daughter, deacon! She's pregnant and scared because my mother won't leave her alone. What do you want me to do, huh?",
        "Deacon: I talked to her! She promises that she's gonna give Hope the space she asked for.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on. That's not gonna work and you know it.",
        "Deacon: All right, look, come on, man. Just give me a little bit of time.",

        "Hope: Quinn! Stop! Get off of my property!",
        "Quinn: Not until you calm down so we can have a rational conversation.",
        "Hope: You are trespassing. This is not okay. I -- I'm going to call security or the police or something. You have to leave.",
        "Quinn: I just wanted to tell you that I am not gonna bother you anymore.",
        "Hope: You came here to tell me that?",
        "Quinn: I-I just wanted you to know how sincere I am. I promised your father, and I meant it.",
