        "Brooke and Ridge kiss and he tells her that he missed her. He thinks they need to get out of here. She says he has work to do; he replies he certainly does. He needs her house key to give him a head start. Quinn tells a surprised Steffy that she is the only viable person to carry on her granddad's legacy and she should be CEO. Eric tells Wyatt do not give up on Steffy. Zende congratulates Liam for being back together with Steffy. He just wishes it were that easy with him and Nicole. Steffy stays and runs into Wyatt. She says Quinn is persistent if nothing else. He quips about her ring tattoo and says that he figured his would be faded and gone too after about 50 years of marriage. They talk about the office and Steffy tells him that she feels it is ridiculous what Quinn proposed and she is just dangling that in front of her to keep her with Wyatt. Quinn goes upstairs and tells Eric that her time with Steffy went well and she did something she hopes Eric will be okay with. She wants to keep Steffy with Wyatt and that is why she offered the CEO chair as a power house to FC. Steffy would be perfect for the job. She belongs strongly in this. Steffy is the one who can help heal and bring this family together. Wyatt tells Steffy that she sure has her blinders on tightly. Quinn does not want to be CEO so this is not a ploy for her to get Steffy on her side. Eric and Quinn walk downstairs and he wants to talk to Steffy alone. Eric repeats again that Quinn has changed. He would like not having to keep saying that. What Steffy fells is simply untrue. Wyatt has accepted the transformation and their marriage so who better to judge than her own son. Eric says Quinn has never hinted to him that she wants to run the company so who else besides Steffy.",
        "Brooke comes home to find rose petals strewn all over the floor up to the bedroom and in the bed. Ridge is inside and hands her a perfect rose with many candles aglow. She kicks off her heels, he unbuttons her blouse. She takes off his shirt and gets in the bed. Ridge starts by kissing her leg and works his way up. Steffy can not believe that Eric would even entertain the idea of what Quinn is offering. He assures her it is true and that Rick and Ridge and even Thorne will always have a place in the company but he agrees that Steffy should be the one. She cannot blame Quinn for marrying Wyatt or leaving him. He does not want to tell Steffy how to choose her life partner but her marriage to Wyatt is not over and she needs to give that more time before making a rash decision. She can be the next CEO of FC so just think it over. Afterwards, Ridge says he has never been happier. It does not matter how they drifted apart, only that they are back together now. It does not get more exciting than that. He loves this room, some things stay the same. She knows him better than anyone and this is their journey. He remembers the first time he saw her \u0096 his Logan."

        "Steffy: Me? Run Forrester?",
        "Quinn: As CEO. How do you feel about that?",
        "Steffy: Your idea?",
        "Quinn: Yes.",
        "Steffy: You realize how transparent you are?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Yeah, well, I'm not surprised that you would see it that way.",
        "Steffy: You want me back with Wyatt as part of the deal, right?",
        "Quinn: Yes and no. Would I like you back with Wyatt? Of course I would because it's clear you two still love each other. But no, Steffy, it's not part of the deal. In my opinion, you are the only eligible candidate to carry on your grandfather's legacy.",
        "Wyatt: So, your best advice is to stay the course?",
        "Eric: Yes. Unless you're willing to move on without Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: Look, your brother's a good man. But in my humble opinion, you and Steffy belong together.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Someone should tell her that. She's already filed for divorce.",
        "Eric: But it's not final. Don't give up on her.",
        "Liam: Thanks for bringing these by.",
        "Zende: Yeah, of course. Hope you like them.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, your proofs are usually passable.",
        "Zende: High praise. Wow, I mean, you're starting to sound like your old man.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Zende: How's he doing?",
        "Liam: You heard about that, huh?",
        "Zende: I did. He broke up with Brooke. Yeah, R.J.'S sort of spreading it all over the building. Well, not literally, but... sort of.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Yeah, well... it's a tough time for the Spencer clan.",
        "Zende: Except for you. Congratulations, by the way. I mean, I'm happy you and Steffy are back together.",
        "Ridge: [Exhales sharply] I think we should get out of here.",
        "Brooke: Don't you have work to do?",
        "Ridge: I have a lot of work to do, but I'm ready. You know what I need? I need your house keys. Give me a head start.",
        "Liam: I appreciate the support.",
        "Zende: You got it. You and Steffy -- match made in heaven.",
        "Liam: Thank -- see? No argument here.",
        "Zende: [Laughs] Besides, the way Steffy feels about Wyatt's mother...",
        "Liam: Yeah, and now she's got to deal with her on a daily basis.",
        "Zende: Yeah, that cannot be fun. You know, I kind of feel sorry for Wyatt. Quinn as his mother -- I mean, there's no way Steffy could stay in that marriage.",
        "Wyatt: When'd you get here?",
        "Steffy: Not too long ago. I came to see my granddad. Ran into your mom.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. How'd that go? Or do I even need to ask?",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] She's persistent. I'll give her that.",
        "Wyatt: I guess that's where I get it.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, you're persistent, too.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, between her and my dad, I -- I'm swimming in it.",
        "Wyatt: How's that going?",
        "Steffy: Um... it's -- it's fading.",
        "Wyatt: I -- I figured mine would, too, someday. You know, after 50 years of marriage. All tattoos eventually fade, right?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] How's my -- how's my granddad? [Clears throat]",
        "Wyatt: He's good. He gave me some good advice, too.",
        "Steffy: His specialty. I hope it sticks.",
        "Wyatt: It might.",
        "Quinn: You counseled my son?",
        "Eric: Yes, I tried.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. Was he resistant?",
        "Eric: Not to what I had to say, no.",
        "Quinn: Uh-huh.",
        "Eric: You were talking to Steffy downstairs?",
        "Quinn: Yes.",
        "Eric: How did that go?",
        "Quinn: Well, I ran something by her, and I hope you're not upset with me, Eric.",
        "Liam: Here you are, sir.",
        "Zende: Thank you. Wait. To you and Steffy.",
        "Liam: I'll drink to that.",
        "Zende: And better days at Forrester.",
        "Liam: Uh... that -- I don't know. Maybe. Maybe once the wicked witch is gone. But until then, I don't think so. Steffy can't coexist with Quinn.",
        "Steffy: Pretty bold of her, wouldn't you say?",
        "Wyatt: Why? I could see you running the company.",
        "Steffy: It's ridiculous. If anyone deserves to be C.E.O., It's my father.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] I don't think he made the short list, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: And I did?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: That makes me wonder.",
        "Wyatt: About what?",
        "Steffy: Your mom's motives.",
        "Wyatt: Ugh.",
        "Steffy: It's like she's dangling this, like some irresistible piece of bait.",
        "Wyatt: And what would she hoping to catch?",
        "Steffy: A stop to our divorce proceedings.",
        "Wyatt: Well, that doesn't sound awful. I mean, is there any irresistible piece of bait I might dangle in front of you?",
        "Quinn: I need some kind of breakthrough with Steffy.",
        "Eric: Give it time, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: I have given it time. She is suspect to every kind word I say to her.",
        "Eric: Yeah, she's as stubborn as her namesake.",
        "Quinn: Well, she certainly doesn't get that from you.",
        "Eric: No, I'm putty in everybody's hands, especially yours.",
        "Quinn: And then there's Wyatt.",
        "Eric: He wants his marriage back so badly.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] So do I. More than you can know. The only reason that they're not together is because of me. I have to get through to your granddaughter. But I need help. And that's why I...made this proposition.",
        "Eric: What was it?",
        "Quinn: I suggested that she might be made C.E.O. Of Forrester.",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Quinn: Well, okay, you've already made it clear that you may not want to go back, and I know you're not gonna give it to ridge because of everything that he's done to you and to the family, and -- see, Steffy is a powerhouse, right? I mean, she embodies everything that Forrester stands for -- class, beauty, youth. If she joined forces with you and with me... she'd be perfect for the job.",
        "Eric: It might bring her and Wyatt back together again.",
        "Quinn: Well, yeah, that thought did cross my mind. I mean, it's not gonna hurt their relationship. And the sooner, the better, before the divorce is finalized. Honey, I know I am being presumptuous here, but... I believe so strongly, just like I did during thanksgiving, that Steffy is the one who can heal this family and brings us all together.",
        "Steffy: Your mom's getting very good, I must say. Suggesting I run Forrester? Very clever.",
        "Wyatt: It's more than clever. It's brilliant. Who else is more qualified to run the company?",
        "Steffy: Besides my dad and my grandfather? Probably no one.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Steffy: It's Quinn. Remember? The puppet master? Pulling strings to get what she wants? And what she want is to become permanent C.E.O. She couldn't win over the troops, so plan b -- win Steffy over.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. You -- you really have those blinders on tight, don't you?",
        "Steffy: Are you comparing to me to a horse right now? Is -- is that what's happening?",
        "Wyatt: I didn't mean to. But a beautiful thoroughbred.",
        "Steffy: Mm.",
        "Wyatt: I'm just -- Steffy, anyone with an ounce of objectivity can see that my mother has changed.",
        "Steffy: So she wants us to think.",
        "Wyatt: No! She has a new passion in life, and it's your grandfather. Love does that to people. At least it did it for me. They're good together, and you know that. Just like we were.",
        "Eric: He's right! We are good together, and that's a vast understatement. Steffy. I want to talk to you. Would you give us some time alone together?",
        "Liam: Well, thanks for bringing these by, man.",
        "Zende: Yeah. Not a problem.",
        "Liam: And, uh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about it. We're gonna get rid of Quinn somehow. In fact, I bet Steffy's working on it right now.",
        "Wyatt: How did Eric react?",
        "Quinn: He was thrown.",
        "Wyatt: But did he like the idea, like, putting Steffy in charge?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] It's hard to tell. I hope so.",
        "Eric: She has changed, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Granddad, I --",
        "Eric: Yeah, I know, how many times have I said that before? I'd really like to stop having to say that. I know you have some very strong beliefs where my wife is concerned, but these things that you believe about her simply aren't true anymore.",
        "Steffy: See, it worries me when I hear these things from you because it's like you're setting yourself up for something very bad to happen.",
        "Eric: Who knows Quinn better than her son? And he has accepted her transformation, he's accepted our marriage. Wyatt's as clever as they come. But Quinn's suggestion to you should speak volumes. Now, I know -- I know you're under the impression that she wanted to keep this job, the C.E.O. Position, on into the future, but she's never hinted to me that that's what she wanted. She hasn't. Quinn has no interest in running Forrester on a permanent basis. And neither do I. Now, if I take myself out of the picture, who does she strongly believe should be running the company? You, Steffy. You.",
        "Ridge: Do you remember?",
        "Brooke: How could I ever forget?",
        "Singer: Every time I see you there it takes me back to the first time across the room, I caught your stare and it all felt like a sign the way you make me feel the only thing that's real whenever you are near destiny appears our love is a story a beautiful journey destinations unknown after all of these years, the laughs and the tears it's still you and me here making destiny appear after all of these years, the laughs and the tears it's still you and me here making destiny appear mmm mmm",
        "Quinn: I hope I got through. To both of them.",
        "Wyatt: Well, it's a good idea. No one's more prepared to run Forrester than Steffy.",
        "Quinn: It is what's best for the company. And maybe this will be her first step to opening her eyes to me, to you, to a marriage that never should have ended.",
        "Wyatt: Well, it hasn't. Technically, not yet.",
        "Steffy: I can't believe you're even considering Quinn's idea.",
        "Eric: You don't think you're capable of running the company?",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs]",
        "Eric: Of course you do. So do I. You know, it may have been Quinn's idea, but -- but I'm C.E.O. I'm the one who's asking you.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] I'm honored. I'm -- I-I'm amazed. But what about dad?",
        "Eric: I don't trust him.",
        "Steffy: I feel the same way he does.",
        "Eric: I think you probably do, but your heart is not as hardened as his, I don't think.",
        "Steffy: What about rick? What about -- what about Thorne?",
        "Eric: They'll always have a place in the company. But if you joined forces with Quinn and me, we'll have control. I'm well aware of the percentages, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Okay, but I -- I know you think Quinn wants what's best for the company, but I do believe there's other reasons.",
        "Eric: I'm well aware of that, too, she's not hiding that. You're in the middle of divorcing her son. She's devastated.",
        "Steffy: Devastated? Granddad, she set us up.",
        "Eric: You blame Quinn for your marriage? You blame her for the vows you made to Wyatt? Don't victimize yourself, Steffy -- that's not you. You married Wyatt because you love him. You're letting your hatred for Quinn cloud your thinking. Sometimes, we don't see things the way they are. We only see things the way we are. You can change that.",
        "Steffy: I don't know, granddad.",
        "Eric: I don't want to tell you who to choose as a life partner. I don't want to do that. But the divorce is not final yet. Give it a chance. Take some time. Consider Wyatt. And consider that your grandfather might be a little smarter than sometimes you give him credit for. Okay? I do love Quinn. I love her deeply. She only wants what's best for me. And she wants what's best for you, too. That's why she has suggested this to you.",
        "Steffy: You'd honestly consider it?",
        "Eric: I have considered it. I think you'd be a champion leading this company on into the future, bringing this family back together. It's in your hands, Steffy. Say yes. You can be the next C.E.O. Of Forrester creations.",
        "Ridge: Hi.",
        "Brooke: Hi.",
        "Ridge: I don't think I've ever been happier. I don't even know how we lost each other. Not important. We found our way back.",
        "Brooke: \"Finding our way back\" -- that should be the title of our memoir.",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles] It'd be an exciting read, that's for sure.",
        "Brooke: I don't know about you, but I could use a little less excitement in my life.",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry. You, me, R.J. -- the family back together? It doesn't get more exciting than that. I love this room.",
        "Brooke: It's our bubble. We would always come here to escape from the real world.",
        "Ridge: Rediscover each other.",
        "Brooke: So many years. So many changes. But some things stayed the same. I love the way your skin feels. I can't ever lose you again. You bring out the best in me. You know me better than anybody. This is our journey. I remember how it started. You were catering a party at my mom's house. But I don't know how it's gonna end. I don't care how it's gonna end. As long as I'm with you. My Logan.",
        "Brooke: Your Logan.",
