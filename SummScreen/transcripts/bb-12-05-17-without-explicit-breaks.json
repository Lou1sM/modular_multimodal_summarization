    "Recap": [
        "Ridge tells Brooke that he is not upset. He is just curious. Thorne is up to something and is not staying with Brooke just because of family being around. Thorne tells his dad that he wonders who the other woman was and he is sure it was more than a kiss but he cannot imagine Ridge cheating on Brooke just before the wedding. Quinn and Ivy discuss the collections pieces and Quinn remembers how Ridge touched her when they discussed it too. Eric tells Thorne that Brooke and Ridge have worked through their problems and the other woman is out of the picture and they should just forget it. Thorne says he does not want to be Ridge's little brother anymore. It is condescending and he is not going to put up with it anymore. He has come back to be on equal footing. He shows his dad some designs which Eric thinks it terrific and asks who they belong to. Thorne says him. Ridge is not the only son who can design. Brooke tells Ridge that he has seen his brother. Does he really think he is different. Ridge says well he did not come home in time for Thanksgiving and yet he did not wait until Christmas so there has to be a reason why now. He will have to dust off his desk in shipping and receiving and make sure it is ready. Brooke says do not be surprised. She thinks he will want more than that. Eric tells Thorne he did not know he was a designer. Thorne says after Aly died he found her style and elegance and with encouragement he got started with kudos from Paris and Milan. This is one of the reasons he came back .that and Brooke and the whole family. He's heard so much but he wants to see it firsthand. He knows Brooke married Bill because Ridge let her down and now she is divorcing Bill so he knows Ridge will be after her again.",
        "Ridge walks in and sees the designs, He is totally surprised when he learns they are Thorne's. Ivy tells Quinn that when Ridge came back home there was a real shakeup but that won't happen with Thorne. Ridge tells Thorne that his designs are great and everybody should have a pretty hobby. Thorne remarks that it is more than a hobby. He wants to contribute. He welcomes Ridge's opinion and he is not afraid to ask for it. Ridge takes them and says they are good but there is no connection to the grouping. He has put a lot of work into it but it is not complete. And they do not just hand out designing jobs. Thorne says he would hope that his dad has the final say. Ridge says he knows what it takes to make it in this business and he has not been designing that long. Eric dismisses himself and says they will discuss this as a family. Ridge turns to Thorne and asks what is his little brother up to. Brooke tells Eric and Quinn that Thorne's work is promising and she hopes he will pursue it. Eric says the brothers have always approached things differently. He admires both of them; both are very confident but Ridge has always been dominate and now he thinks maybe Thorne wants to challenge him. Ridge tells Thorne that he wants him to be happy and everyone has a role to play for the future and he hopes Thorne will figure that out. Thorne says he went to Europe and he knows he is a novice and does not have the experience Ridge does but he wants to give it his all. Ridge says this is absurd. Thorne says enough of the little brother. They are not kids anymore. Maybe Ridge thinks he can intimidate him. He was treated like this his whole life but enough is enough."

        "Ridge: I don't know. It just doesn't add up.",
        "Brooke: Okay. I'm letting your brother stay here until he finds a place more permanent.",
        "Ridge: No, no, no. I understand that. But why is he here?",
        "Brooke: Because family is here. Rick and maya and lizzy, R.J.",
        "Ridge: [ Laughs ]",
        "Brooke: That's nice.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: Nothing.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] I don't know why you're so upset about this.",
        "Ridge: I'm not upset at all. I'm -- I'm -- I'm not. I'm just curious. I've known this guy all my life. He doesn't do things like that. He's not spontaneous. He's up to something.",
        "Thorne: Brooke wouldn't come right out and say it, but I put it together. Ridge betrayed her.",
        "Eric: They went through a difficult time.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, because he cheated on her right before the wedding in sydney. Once again my brother had to prove that he could conquer any woman any time he wants. Who was it? You were there. Brooke said it was just a kiss, but I'm sure she was trying to downplay it.",
        "Eric: Brooke has put this behind her. I don't see the value in dredging it up for anyone.",
        "Thorne: Well, do you know who the other woman was? Brooke is one of the most accomplished, beautiful women in the world. Who would ridge cheat with?",
        "Quinn: Steffy wants to tease a few of the pieces in the upcoming ad campaign. I thought we could show her the one you did, the platinum one with the curls.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. This one has such unusual textures.",
        "Quinn: Ridge really liked that one.",
        "Ridge: It's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.",
        "Quinn: Said it was beautiful.",
        "Thorne: If you didn't know who it was, you'd say so.",
        "Eric: Brooke doesn't want to discuss this with you. I don't think we should, either.",
        "Thorne: So you do know.",
        "Eric: Ridge and brooke have worked hard to overcome this.",
        "Thorne: And the woman who ridge cheated with, she's no longer in the picture?",
        "Eric: Not an issue anymore.",
        "Thorne: What does that mean?",
        "Eric: It's been dealt with.",
        "Thorne: Oh. Ridge closed the subject, did he? He said to everyone, \"forget it,\" so everyone does.",
        "Eric: That's not really ever seemed fair to you, has it? There's been a lot of unfairness in your life, thorne. Losing macy, losing darla, and then beautiful aly. It's changed you. You're different, son.",
        "Thorne: I have changed, dad, more than you know. I came back from europe because I'm ready to be on equal footing with ridge. I don't want to be his little brother anymore.",
        "Eric: He's always called you that.",
        "Thorne: It's condescending, and I'm not gonna put up with it any longer. Come here. I wanted to show you something.",
        "Eric: Sketches? Whose are these?",
        "Thorne: They're mine. Ridge isn't your only son who can design.",
        "Ridge: Thorne was perfectly happy in europe, and now he's here. Why?",
        "Brooke: L.A. Is his home.",
        "Ridge: His life, his work is in paris.",
        "Brooke: Have you talked to him about his work lately?",
        "Ridge: The only reason to talk about his work is if he screwed up. Did he? Did he screw up?",
        "Brooke: It would be nice if you showed a little bit of interest.",
        "Ridge: I don't -- [ Sighs ] I-I don't have time for that! I need to go and tell thorne how much he's appreciated? When?",
        "Brooke: Ridge, I don't think that's what he expects.",
        "Ridge: What does he expect? You obviously talked to him, so what is it? What are you not telling me?",
        "Brooke: You've seen your brother. Doesn't he seem a bit different to you?",
        "Ridge: Of course he's different. We're all different. He went through a lot. And of course he's changed. But he's -- he's my little brother. I know when he has an agenda.",
        "Brooke: Why can't you just be happy that he's back? Why does it have to be such a mystery?",
        "Ridge: Because it is a mystery, and I didn't make it one! It is! He didn't show up for thanksgiving. He didn't wait until christmas. He's here now. Why? Does he have some kind of a grievance?",
        "Brooke: No. Why would you even say that?",
        "Ridge: Because I know him, that's why!",
        "Brooke: Ridge, you and thorne have grown up. You're not little kids anymore. You are professionals in this fashion industry. And yes, maybe you're both different, but you are forresters, and thorne is a forrester.",
        "Ridge: Okay, so this is about work, then? Is that what it is?",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] You can speculate all you want. It seems to make you really happy.",
        "Ridge: There's other things i would like to speculate about that would make me a lot happier. And hey, thorne wants to come back to work with us at forrester, then we'll just make sure we'll dust off his desk in shipping and receiving.",
        "Brooke: I think he might have something different in mind for his future.",
        "Ridge: [ Sighs ] You think or you know? I have an idea. Let's go over to the office and ask him what he's up to. [ Giggles ] I saw him today. So hot.",
        "[ Giggles ]",
        "Quinn: What's going on with you guys? You're so giggly today. Sorry, mrs. Forrester.",
        "Ivy: It's thorne. He has caused quite a stir in the office. And not just with the models.",
        "Eric: You did these?",
        "Thorne: I have more, but i think that these are the best.",
        "Eric: I didn't know you were designing.",
        "Thorne: Well, after aly passed, I had to lose myself in something, so I picked up a sketchpad, thought about my beautiful daughter, her grace, elegance, her lyrical side.",
        "Eric: I see that.",
        "Thorne: I've had so many incredible, inspiring women in my life. I wanted to create designs as unique and exceptional as they were. Of course, I was a little reluctant to show them off at first. It wasn't long before I was getting encouragement from some of the finest designers in paris and milan.",
        "Eric: You didn't want your father's advice or opinion?",
        "Thorne: Of course I did. That's why I'm here now. But I wanted to hone my skills. I wanted to surprise you, make you proud.",
        "Eric: Wow. So this is why you've come back?",
        "Thorne: One of the reasons. I've been thinking a lot lately. Not just about me, but about you, brooke, the whole family. I've kept in touch. I've heard about things, but i haven't been here. I mean, so much has happened. You're with quinn. You seem really happy.",
        "Eric: We are.",
        "Thorne: Well, being here, i can really feel that.",
        "Eric: That's good to know.",
        "Thorne: Yeah. I just wish everyone else was doing as well.",
        "Eric: Ridge and brooke are taking it slow.",
        "Thorne: Brooke married bill because ridge let her down. And apparently bill let her down, too. So when I heard she was getting divorced, I had to come back.",
        "Eric: Brooke's doing her best to move on.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, but is she moving forward?",
        "[ Door opens ]",
        "Ridge: Hey. I didn't realize I was missing a meeting.",
        "Eric: Not a meeting. [ Door closes ] Just talking.",
        "Ridge: Oh. What you got? What's this? Are they yours?",
        "Eric: No, not mine.",
        "Ridge: Are they in-house? They don't look like it.",
        "Thorne: What do you think of them?",
        "Ridge: Who did these?",
        "Thorne: Are they good or not?",
        "Ridge: Dad.",
        "Eric: They're thorne'S.",
        "Ridge: Thorne is designing. Well, look at you, little brother.",
        "Ivy: Maybe we should have thorne look over these new pieces. He's in the office.",
        "Quinn: That's okay. Ridge and steffy already approved them.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but he might have a feel for what the european buyers are looking for.",
        "Quinn: Okay, I can run it by him later. Oh, I have his number. I can text him.",
        "Quinn: I don't need you to give me his number, thank you. But... I promise if I do a showing for him, I will call you two in, okay? Go take a break. It's okay. Thank you.",
        "Quinn: Regroup in a minute.",
        "Ivy: Oh, gosh.",
        "Quinn: Thorne better watch out.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm. Everybody is very excited about thorne's return. Actually, some more than others.",
        "Quinn: Oh, well, maybe he'll shake things up around here.",
        "Ivy: Thorne? No, see, when -- when ridge came back, that was a shake-up. He used to run the company, and then he wanted to run it again. Was a huge power struggle.",
        "Quinn: Wait, so thorne didn't ever want to run the company? He doesn't want to be in control?",
        "Ivy: I mean, come on. Who doesn't want to run the company around here? I guess what I'm trying to say is that thorne isn't domineering or arrogant. Not that I'm saying ridge is.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, I totally get it. I mean, they're just two strong, accomplished men who couldn't be less alike.",
        "Ridge: I remember you drawing when you were a kid. What was it? Always surfboards and cars, right?",
        "Thorne: I've been working with acclaimed designers all over europe.",
        "Ridge: Taking lessons? That's good.",
        "Thorne: Refining my abilities.",
        "Eric: Which are considerable.",
        "Brooke: They really are.",
        "Ridge: Well, I think it's great. You have a hobby. Everybody should have a hobby. Look, you -- you draw a really pretty picture.",
        "Thorne: Well, I am eric forrester's son. And it's not a hobby, ridge.",
        "Ridge: And there it is. I told you, he didn't come -- he... you knew about this, didn't you?",
        "Brooke: Thorne showed me his designs, and I think they're amazing, especially for a designer who doesn't have as much experience as you and eric have.",
        "Ridge: So you went to brooke and you went to dad because you wanted to have, what, a little cheering section in place before you show them to me?",
        "Thorne: I would have shown them to you if you asked me what I've been up to. I'm proud of my designs. I'm not scared to ask your opinion. In fact, I welcome it. If I was on the design team, i would -- I would expect it.",
        "Ridge: We're not looking to expand the design team, are we, dad?",
        "Thorne: Don't get defensive. Just tell me what you think.",
        "Ridge: Sure. Let's see. I think that these are... very interesting sketches. I think you have a great feel for fabric. But there's no theme here, no cohesion. They're no overall vision.",
        "Thorne: They're eclectic.",
        "Ridge: Eclectic? That's just a fancy word for \"all over the place,\" isn't it?",
        "Thorne: Okay. You don't see them as a group. What do you think of them individually?",
        "Ridge: [ Clears throat ] Individually? Thorne, I think you put a lot of work into these. Unfortunately, I can see all the hallmarks of an inexperienced designer.",
        "Thorne: Point them out. If I can do something to make these better, I want to know what it is.",
        "Ridge: Why? What are you after here? You think I just hand out jobs on the design team to anyone that gives me sketches?",
        "Thorne: Well, it's not your call, is it? You're lead designer. It's still dad's company. I'd like to think that he still has the final say here.",
        "Ridge: All right. Okay. You have some natural ability. Anyone can see that. If I'm being too harsh, i apologize. But I'm just -- I know what it takes to succeed in this business. You just got here, man, and you -- you just haven't designed very long.",
        "Thorne: I know I haven't been doing it as long as you, but that doesn't mean I can'T.",
        "Ridge: Could I talk to my brother alone for a minute?",
        "Eric: We can discuss this as a family, you know.",
        "Thorne: No, it's fine, dad. It's fine. Ridge and I need to have a chat.",
        "Eric: All right.",
        "[ Door closes ]",
        "Ridge: Okay. Let's recap. You're back here, and you're a designer now looking for a position. You move into brooke's house. Nice. I like that. She said before that I should ask you more questions. Well, let me ask you a question now. What are you up to, little brother?",
        "Quinn: Thorne came home with designs?",
        "Eric: Yes. In fact, they're discussing them as we speak.",
        "Brooke: They may be discussing more than that.",
        "Eric: [ Sighs ] I think thorne was open to an honest critique.",
        "Brooke: And ridge didn't hesitate to give him one.",
        "Quinn: What do you think of them?",
        "Brooke: I think they're promising.",
        "Eric: Promising. That's exactly the word. He's obviously been working very hard on this.",
        "Quinn: So, is this something that he wants to pursue, that he wants to take seriously?",
        "Brooke: Yes. And I hope ridge treats it that way.",
        "Quinn: Eric told me that ridge has always been dismissive of his brother.",
        "Brooke: They have been competing for many, many years, and thorne always feels like he's the runner-up and ridge gets whatever he wants and then pushes thorne aside.",
        "Eric: And besides that, they approach things very differently. Thorne likes to bring people together. He tries to form a consensus. Ridge is more forceful and more commanding. I admire those traits in both of them. As different as they are, though, they're both very confident men.",
        "Brooke: I agree. And thorne has become a lot stronger now.",
        "Eric: Seems like it, doesn't it? Ridge has always dominated his siblings, you know. They've always backed off and let him steer the ship. Seems like thorne is ready to stand up to him, maybe, uh, challenge his brother.",
        "Ridge: I don't want to argue with you.",
        "Thorne: I don't want that, either.",
        "Ridge: You've had a hard time. I get that. And everyone said that your time in paris was good for you.",
        "Thorne: It has been.",
        "Ridge: Good. I'm happy. I want you to be happy. But you got to understand that time didn't stand still here. A lot of things have happened, a lot of turbulence with the family, with the company. But it's behind us now. We figured it out. And everyone has a role to play. We're just focused on the future.",
        "Thorne: I am, too.",
        "Ridge: Every single person in this building, every one of them, is focused on one thing -- the success of this company.",
        "Thorne: Yes, and I want to be a bigger part of that.",
        "Ridge: Okay, but you went to europe!",
        "Thorne: I didn't leave forrester creations, ridge.",
        "Ridge: No, no, but -- [ Sighs ] You're a big part of international, one of our top executives.",
        "Thorne: I'm not a designer, okay? Look, I'm not naive. I haven't had the experience that you have. But I'm not a novice. This is important to me. It's something I want to do. Look, maybe I haven't been working on this with you the way zende did, but I have been learning.",
        "Ridge: Zende? He's a young, up-and-coming artist. You spent your whole career in a boardroom, and now all of a sudden, you want to be a designer? It's absurd!",
        "Thorne: Really? Our sisters are designers. Our dad is a designer. I want to be a designer is absurd?",
        "Ridge: I don't want to fight about this.",
        "Thorne: I've gotten advice and encouragement from some of the biggest names in fashion in europe.",
        "Ridge: And these names in fashion, do they happen to be our friends and our colleagues?",
        "Thorne: Yes.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Did it ever occur to you that they didn't want to hurt your feelings, they didn't want to hurt the relationship they have with me and with dad? Come on, I know this -- it's difficult. I get all that. You want to -- you want to contribute more. You want to do more. I get it. And you found this ability, but that's not enough, little brother. You got to come up with something else.",
        "Thorne: Come on. Enough with the \"little brother\" thing. We're not kids anymore.",
        "Ridge: Stop acting like one.",
        "Thorne: Same could be said about you. I've told you once. I'm not gonna tell you again. Call me by my name. It's not that hard.",
        "Ridge: That's what this is about?",
        "Thorne: You think you can undermine my confidence, intimidate me? [ Scoffs ] Well, you can'T. Not anymore. You've treated me like this my entire life, and I've had enough, ridge. You hear me? Enough."
