        "Stephanie: Felicia, why didn't you tell me that you had a baby?",
        "Felicia: You went into the guest house when I told you not to, mother?",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, why wouldn't you tell me that you have a beautiful little boy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: I'm going to go after Felicia, too. She was pretty upset.",
        "Eric: No, let ridge handle it. The way she drives, Ridge is the only person that's going to be able to catch up with her anyway. She's probably at the guest house by now.",
        "Jackie: You think she wasn't feeling well?",
        "Nick: Well, you heard what she said. She's cancer-free.",
        "Bridget: I think it's pretty obvious what's going on. It couldn't have been easy for her to listen to all this talk about you and me. The fact that we're having this happy life, and we're expecting a child.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, Nick, you two were involved.",
        "Nick: Well, I wouldn't really call it \"involved.\"",
        "Jackie: She was very fond of you, Ncky.",
        "Nick: Well, we had some laughs, that's all.",
        "Brooke: Felicia's always so flippant on the surface that it's hard to realize how vulnerable she really is.",
        "Eric: It's my fault. I never should have invited her here. I knew she was going to walk in on this party for the two of you.",
        "Darla: Well, even if Felicia had more feelings than we're aware of, she's been gone for a year.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, I mean, whatever happened between you two, you would think that it would be way behind her.",
        "Darla: She does move on pretty easily.",
        "Jackie: And some men leave more of an impression than they realize.",
        "Nick: Maybe I should go talk to her, huh?",
        "Eric: No, let ridge do it. This party is for the two of you. This is your celebration. Felicia's in your past.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: A child?",
        "Felicia: Why I ever thought you could leave well enough alone. I should have stayed in France. What the hell was I thinking?",
        "Stephanie: Well, I hope you were thinking about the child. Bringing him here to meet his family. Honey, he's a beautiful little boy. And Renee's lovely.",
        "Felicia: Renee?",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I'm sorry. I think I did make her uncomfortable when I went over to the guest house.",
        "Felicia: Yeah, I told her you wouldn't go there.",
        "Stephanie: Look, if you want to share your life with Renee, and you want to raise this child with her, I absolutely respect that.",
        "Felicia: What did Renee say to you?",
        "Stephanie: Nothing very much, -- I mean, but it's so apparent, she just loves that little boy. So she's the birth mother? Did you adopt?",
        "Felicia: Where do you get these ideas, Mother?",
        "Stephanie: Well, honey, you were on chemo, you couldn't have conceived. Look, Felicia, it doesn't matter to me whether this baby is adopted or it's not adopted. I don't care about anything like that. He's my grandson, and I will love him just as much as I love all my grandchildren. I just -- it just seems so -- you've always had such a \"to hell with everyone else\" kind of attitude about life, and here you have this wonderful little baby. Now you know what it's like to be a mother. To love someone so much, be there for them so totally. It's great. It's wonderful.",
        "Felicia: Are you crying?",
        "Stephanie: I don't know, maybe a little.",
        "Felicia: Wow.",
        "Stephanie: A baby's a wonderful, precious gift, honey. I'm so happy for you. It's going to bring so much joy to the family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: Dad, Felicia will be fine.",
        "Eric: Yes, of course she will. She always ends up just fine. She's a very independent woman. Me, on the other hand, stuck down here with delivery trucks all day and all night.",
        "Brooke: Not to mention the diesel fumes.",
        "Taylor: Good grief, could it be any louder out there? It sounds like a bus depot.",
        "Eric: Oh, a bus depot would be a breath of fresh air compared to this space.",
        "Thorne: Well, if it were up to me, you'd be upstairs.",
        "Eric: Yeah, I know, Thorne, I know. Look, I'm sorry, the two of you are stuck in the middle of this whole marital thing.",
        "Brooke: I guess this would be a bad time to talk about designs.",
        "Eric: No, no, Brooke. Actually, I'm glad Taylor's here. Both of you. There's something I want to say to you. I've been very, very frustrated that the two of you have sided with Stephanie in this thing.",
        "Thorne: We're not against you, Dad.",
        "Eric: Now don't -- hear me out. Hear me out, here. I mean, obviously the two of you see some merit in this idea that Stephanie has of a line for the intelligent woman.",
        "Taylor: It's definitely an untapped market.",
        "Eric: Yes, yeah, yeah, maybe. But as angry as I've been with the two of you allying yourselves with Stephanie in this thing, a part of me is starting to understand. Stephanie's been very hurt by this, and, frankly, she has every right to be.",
        "Bridget: You know, it's just, Felicia's always been so together, it's weird seeing her so worked up.",
        "Jackie: She cared for you, Nicky. A great deal more than you cared for her, I'm afraid.",
        "Bridget: Have you not been in touch with her at all?",
        "Nick: I emailed her once. I never heard back.",
        "Jackie: That's strange.",
        "Nick: For Felicia, not really.",
        "Bridget: Well, you obviously had more of an effect on her than you knew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: I should've known I couldn't fool you, mother. Given my history, I never thought in a million years you'd believe that I'd fallen for a woman, so I figured I was better off denying it.",
        "Stephanie: So you thought I couldn't handle it?",
        "Felicia: I was wrong.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, I just want you to be happy. If you don't know that by now -- look, we're going to make a celebration. I'll get everybody over to the house tonight to meet the baby and to meet Renee.",
        "Felicia: I don't know, mother. We've been so busy traveling, we're all pretty wiped out.",
        "Stephanie: Well, you don't have to do a thing. Megan will do all the phone calls.",
        "Felicia: Mother, wait.",
        "Stephanie: What is it?",
        "Felicia: I made a mistake.",
        "Stephanie: A mistake?",
        "Felicia: Dragging my son across the world. It was too soon. Or too late. And for what?",
        "Stephanie: To meet his family.",
        "Felicia: I shouldn't have come here, brought him here.",
        "Stephanie: Why not?",
        "Felicia: Because he's my child, and I need to protect him.",
        "Stephanie: I don't understand why you wouldn't want us to know him. I mean, I don't understand why you're being so secretive. Did you -- have you done something illegal?",
        "Felicia: No.",
        "Felicia: No, mother. He's my baby. Mine. I gave birth to him.",
        "Stephanie: What?",
        "Felicia: I know. I was so sick, but it happened. Despite the chemo.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my god.",
        "Felicia: It was a miracle. I had to have him.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, sweetheart. My baby girl. My baby girl. You're a mother. A mother.",
        "Felicia: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: I don't even know his name. What's his name?",
        "Felicia: Dominick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I should go talk to her.",
        "Bridget: No, no, sweetheart. Honestly, let me go. You already talked to her on the boat. Maybe I can relate to her more. You know, one woman's emotions to another.",
        "Jackie: They are sisters.",
        "Nick: But you saw her, she was so upset. She was --",
        "Bridget: That's because I'm just little Bridget to her. Look at us, we're married, we're expecting a child. I'm sure that was the last thing she ever thought she would come home to.",
        "Nick: I don't want you to feel threatened in any way whatsoever.",
        "Bridget: I don't feel threatened. Why would I feel threatened? I have you. I know you love me. We're having a baby. Look, just give her time. I know that she wants you to be happy. And you're going to be a father. Just watch, she'll be just as happy for you as anyone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I was very angry with Stephanie. Very angry. I wanted to lash out. But now that I've had a chance to think about it, I've realized that what's really happened, is that I've let her down.",
        "Brooke: Let her down?",
        "Eric: Look, I'm her husband. I was her husband.",
        "Brooke: Eric, you've suffered because of it.",
        "Eric: Look, she's no saint, I'll grant you that. But marrying you the second time, it just put her right over the edge.",
        "Brooke: I hardly think it put her over the edge.",
        "Eric: Brooke, I want to say this, all right? I want to say this to the two of them.",
        "Thorne: Dad, you don't have to.",
        "Taylor: Look, look. The truth is, all of us have been walking on eggshells lately.",
        "Eric: Yes, I know. And I'm very, very much responsible for that. Harsh words have been said. But there's a human side, too.",
        "Brooke: Not when it comes to Stephanie.",
        "Eric: She was my wife for a very long time. There's a part of me that's always going to love her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Why did you keep this pregnancy a secret?",
        "Felicia: Nick never cared about me, Mother. Not the way that I cared for him. He was a friend, a buddy. Supported me when I needed someone the most.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia.",
        "Felicia: We had fun together, that was it.",
        "Stephanie: You had his baby.",
        "Felicia: Yeah, but I'm not going to hold that over nick.",
        "Stephanie: I'm not suggesting you hold it over him, but there's a child. You gave birth to his son.",
        "Felicia: He doesn't love me, Mother. Got it? Never asked me to be his wife.",
        "Stephanie: But you love him?",
        "Felicia: What does it matter?",
        "Stephanie: Honey, you're here. You came all this way. You must've felt a need.",
        "Felicia: Not anymore. What's done is done, right? Time to move on down the road.",
        "Stephanie: I think you have to tell him.",
        "Felicia: No, no, absolutely not. Bridget is pregnant with his child. I can't say anything now, I won't.",
        "Stephanie: Well, what do you think you're going to do?",
        "Felicia: Go back to France today, this instant.",
        "Stephanie: But you need help raising the baby.",
        "Felicia: Right, and Renee is a wonderful nanny.",
        "Stephanie: You can't do that.",
        "Felicia: I've been doing it, Mother.",
        "Stephanie: Does this baby not deserve to know his father? Are you going to deny Nick and all of us the opportunity to be in this baby's life?",
        "Felicia: Fine. Come to France. Stay as long as you like.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, sweetheart.",
        "Felicia: No, Bridget is pregnant with his child. He loves Bridget. He's married to her. What? What, do I just go to Nick and say, \"oh, this thing you got with Bridget, forget about it. I'm here now. Oh, and by the way, meet your son.\"",
        "Stephanie: I'm not suggesting that they have to end their marriage.",
        "Felicia: Right, I'm not going to come between their happiness. I won't do it to Nick. I won't do it to Bridget. Bridget.",
        "Bridget: Oh.",
        "Felicia: Um, I was just leaving.",
        "Bridget: No, no, Felicia. No, I know what's going on here, and trust me, honey, it's nothing that we can't deal with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Eric, how can you say these things about Stephanie? Think about what she's done. She stole the company away from you.",
        "Eric: What I did to her was far worse. When I married you, knowing you didn't love me, it was a real slap in her face. It took away all of her dignity. It was a very big mistake, and if I could take it back, I would.",
        "Brooke: You can't be serious.",
        "Eric: The truth is, Stephanie has always known what's right for this family. And as much as I've tried to demonize her, she always has.",
        "Brooke: Thorne and Taylor, could you excuse us? I'd like to have a word in private with Eric.",
        "Eric: Now you want privacy? When we were married, privacy with me was the last thing you wanted.",
        "Thorne: Hey, Dad.",
        "Eric: No, it's all right. It's all right.",
        "Taylor: I think maybe we should give you a little privacy.",
        "Eric: No, Taylor, anything that she has to say to me, she can say in front of the two of you.",
        "Thorne: Actually, I have to look over some rough ad campaigns.",
        "Taylor: I have to finish the press release, anyway, so --",
        "Brooke: So I'm the problem? You actually feel sorry for Stephanie after she stole your company? Eric, I can't even believe those words came out of your mouth.",
        "Eric: Well, you shouldn't believe everything you hear.",
        "Brooke: After everything we've been through.",
        "Eric: You're right about that. You and I have been through too much together.",
        "Brooke: Maybe those diesel fumes are getting to your head.",
        "Eric: Well, it won't be very long before those diesel fumes are a thing of the past. I needed to catch you off guard, and I think I did.",
        "Brooke: What are you talking about?",
        "Eric: Look, Thorne and Taylor need to be convinced. If they are not, Stephanie never will be.",
        "Brooke: Enough. Just tell me what you're doing.",
        "Eric: Come here. Stephanie's vulnerable to me. She always has been. Even Jackie picked up on it. Look, I was married to her forever. If anybody knows how to work her emotions to some kind of an advantage, it's me.",
        "Brooke: Work her emotions?",
        "Eric: What's the one thing in the world that Stephanie wants more than anything?",
        "Brooke: To be rid of me.",
        "Eric: Exactly. Now, it would take me years to get this company back through the courts, and once I did, there wouldn't be anything left of it. But, if I can convince her that I finally see you the same way she does, that I no longer care about you, she'll let me back in. And I'll get this company back now.",
        "Brooke: To have the company back? What's the point, if I can't have you?",
        "[ Brooke remembering ]",
        "Brooke: Why was I so afraid? So afraid of being loved by you?",
        "Nick: I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Brooke: It should have been you. All this time. All along, it should have been you.",
        "Brooke: I don't want to spend another day without you in my life.",
        "Nick: Well, I'm not going anywhere. God, I love you. I've always loved you.",
        "Brooke: I have so much love inside of me that I couldn't give away, and now I can. Be my hope. Be my husband. Let me love you, Nick. Forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Felicia was acting so strangely. I mean, her emotions were just on the surface. Do you think we're missing something, Nicky? You did tell her it was over between you two, didn't you?",
        "Nick: Of course I did, Mother. And it is over, she knows that.",
        "Jackie: Well, there's more going on here than meets the eye.",
        "Nick: Well, if that's true, Bridget's about to find out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Look, everyone's been so concerned about you.",
        "Felicia: The cancer.",
        "Bridget: Well, yes, obviously.",
        "Felicia: It hasn't come back.",
        "Bridget: You have no idea how glad I am to hear that. But I didn't think cancer was the only issue. The issue right now is more \"Nick,\" isn't it? Look, honey, please don't worry about me. The last couple of months have been really hard, but I have become so much stronger. Look, I get to give nick his child, and -- honestly, I'm perfectly fine.",
        "Felicia: You know what? I can see that. Understand it, even.",
        "Bridget: Well, good. And don't be mad at dad -- his heart was in the right place, wanting to welcome you back. Just like he wanted to celebrate Nick and me, and the baby. But I know that it can't be easy hearing all of that. Especially when nick went on and on about how happy we are.",
        "Felicia: I guess I'm just not a cake and punch kind of girl.",
        "Bridget: Well, maybe not. But we were insensitive, and we're sorry.",
        "Felicia: No, it's okay, Bridget.",
        "Bridget: All right, but I still think it would just be best if we got everything out on the table. I mean, you ran out of the room because you still have feelings for Nick. Nobody understands more than I do how hard it is to love someone and see them with another woman. And you had no idea when you came back to L.A. That we would be married and now I would be expecting his baby. You didn't know.",
        "Felicia: It was a surprise.",
        "Bridget: See, you don't need to hide anything. I know that Nick is a wonderful man, and I think it's perfectly natural that you would still care about him.",
        "Felicia: Bridget, I've heard about everything that you and Nick have been through. The last thing in the world that I want is to be a problem.",
        "Bridget: No, you're not! You won't be! Especially if we can just communicate and deal with everything as it comes. Look, I promise you, we'll look back on this soon and laugh.",
        "Felicia: I wish it was that simple.",
        "Bridget: Come on.",
        "Stephanie: Bridget, Felicia has something that she wants to tell you.",
        "Felicia: Mother!",
        "Stephanie: Sweetheart, you have to tell her.",
        "Bridget: Tell me what? Felicia? Felicia, what do you have to tell me?"
