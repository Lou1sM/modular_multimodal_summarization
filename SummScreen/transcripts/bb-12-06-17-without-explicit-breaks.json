        "Thorne and Ridge spar at each other and Thorne says he is just now getting back to town and already Ridge is on his case ..guess he is not bowing down far enough in his brother's office! Thorne says this is getting under his skin and he is definitely not going to keep this up any more. He is so tired of Ridge's condescending attitude. Ridge tells his \"little brother\" to stop over- reacting. Thorne points his finger in Ridge's face and tells him not to call him that again. And Ridge does not get to tell him what to do. Ridge reminds him that it is he who runs this company now. Quinn tells Brooke and Eric good for Thorne for branching out and becoming a designer while he was in Europe and Eric knew nothing about it. Eric says he likes what he has seen so far and is interested in just how far it will go. He knows Ridge and Thorne have always been competitive all their lives but somehow Ridge always ends up with the upper hand. But maybe Thorne will stand up to his brother this time. Steffy panics as she thinks again on the night she was with Bill and their night of passion. Liam cannot catch her attention and asks what is wrong. Thorne and Ridge are still squabbling when Quinn, Eric and Brooke come in and want to know what's the matter. Eric says he does not want them fighting in here and Brooke agrees they both need to calm down. Thorne tells Ridge that he is a bully and used to controlling everyone around him and that has to stop. Eric tells Brooke to please take Thorne to lunch and let them all cool off. Thorne points his finger again at Ridge and says he is tired of being mistreated and it has to stop, including his treatment of Brooke. Steffy says she was just thinking about something else; nothing is the matter. It's over now. She's just happy to be home with her husband and being made a homemade meal; it is all she ever wanted. They hug when he apologizes for bringing Sally and Bill's name up and for when he broke his vows. He will never be that insensitive again.",
        "Ridge tells his dad that Thorne breezed back into town and now he is a designer. He is up to something; what he does not know. And he is not upset but he does wonder why a grown man would come to Los Angeles and not get a hotel room for himself. He is staying at Brooke's. And now Ridge is going to find them and relieve Brooke of her babysitting duties. At Il Giardino, Sheila spies Brooke and Thorne at one of her tables. Brooke tells Thorne don't let Ridge get to him. Thorne says he tries not to but he always rattles his cage. He has had to put up with it all his life and now it is over. He does not appreciate Brooke trying to defend him and she was right to call off her wedding in Australia. He thinks she is an amazing woman and she does not need a man to define her. Sheila is planted behind a big bush taking all of this in. Brooke thanks Thorne and says he is nice and it is sweet of him to remind her. He reminds her that any man does not understand that is a fool. Instead of putting it all behind him Liam continues to want to re-live that night and when she came home he could not believe how lucky he was that she forgave him. It was like she was a different person and he never even asked her where she had been. Now he is curious where she went that night and what did she do. She thinks long and hard and finally says she never should have left and she drove around thinking of him and how she should have stayed. Thorne tells Brooke they have been through a lot together and she has always been there for him and he counts on her as someone he can always turn to. She says he is too humble .really she thinks he is the sweetest, kindest person she has ever met. Suddenly there is Ridge interrupting their talk. He says he called but it kept going to voice mail. They have a meeting and she is needed. He won't listen to Thorne's no she does not have to go. Ridge spirits her away and Sheila wastes no time in walking over and saying hello to Thorne and even invites herself to sit down as it is her break. He says he heard she was out of jail and back in town. She says she could not help but see he was with Brooke and it's too bad that Ridge came in and whisked her away. But then that is what Ridge does .he swoops in and takes the women away from his friends, his brother and even his dad. Brooke is surprised when she gets back to the office with Ridge and there is no meeting, just a lunch he has provided for the two of them. She says he was rude to Thorne. He says Thorne will get over it and they both need to stay away from the restaurant as Sheila works there. Sheila confesses to Thorne that she tried to sabotage Quinn and Eric but she was wrong and Quinn did not cheat on him after all. She had her reasons for thinking she would. She says he has been away from home for a long time so there is a lot he does not know. For instance she wonders if he ever thought why Brooke and Ridge did not get married in Australia. She admits she knows who Ridge was with just before the wedding but he cannot tell anyone that this came from her. Quinn cheated on Eric with Ridge. Liam keeps yammering away at Steffy how loyal she was and he knows she does not want to talk about this and put it all past her so he will never let her down again. Again all she sees are these images of her and Bill having sex and she finally shouts at Liam to stop. He leaves for a minute to go back to kitchen and she goes to the mirror and looks at herself and says she is a big cheat .a big liar, phony and a cheater. Guilty as charged!"

        "[ Quinn giggles ]",
        "Thorne: I can't believe my brother would betray my dad like this again. I can only imagine how hurt dad would be if he found out.",
        "Sheila: Oh, your dad was devastated.",
        "Thorne: Wait, dad knows?",
        "Sheila: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thorne: And he forgave ridge? Kept him on as C.E.O.?",
        "Sheila: Well, he forgave quinn, too. Which is really shocking, considering...",
        "Thorne: Considering what?",
        "Sheila: She's not a good person, thorne. I stayed in L.A. To look after eric's best interests. God, I hope you believe that.",
        "Thorne: I need answers.",
        "Sheila: Thorne, remember... this didn't come from me.",
        "Brooke: Wow! So this is your surprise, huh?",
        "Ridge: It's been long enough, don't you think?",
        "Brooke: Hm... depends on what you have in mind.",
        "Ridge: See, if someone were to walk in... they would see me kissing my future wife. Not that scandalous, is it?",
        "Quinn: I hope they still have that special beet salad.",
        "Thorne: Dad?",
        "Quinn: Oh, hey, thorne.",
        "Thorne: Quinn. Uh, I need to speak with you. Alone, if that's okay.",

        "Quinn: Okay. Bye.",
        "Thorne: Bye.",
        "Eric: I thought you were having lunch with brooke.",
        "Thorne: Ridge had other ideas.",
        "Eric: I see. What happened?",
        "Thorne: What always happens when ridge is involved -- to hell with anyone else's feelings. Including yours. I know what happened, dad. I know how he betrayed you again with quinn.",
        "Sheila: Your to-go order should be ready shortly. So, are you and eric having a nice cozy lunch at the office?",
        "Quinn: Buzz off, sheila. I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Sheila: Ooh, gracious as always.",
        "Quinn: You know, I don't need to be gracious to you because you're just a crazy troublemaker.",
        "Sheila: No, actually, I'm a working stiff trying to earn a living here.",
        "Quinn: [ Sighs ] Oh, please.",
        "Sheila: Oh, that's something you wouldn't know, though, would you, being mrs. Eric forrester. No financial worries there.",
        "Quinn: [ Scoffs ] Are you seriously trying to imply that I married eric for his money? I -- I'm engaging with her. Why am I engaging with her?",
        "Sheila: You know, how -- how is ridge doing? You guys still work closely, don't you? Well [Chuckles] Of course you do. That's one of the perks of going to work every day, isn't it?",
        "Quinn: You know what the perk of my job is? That, at the end of a long day, I get to go home to my husband, who I love so much.",
        "Sheila: And ridge?",
        "Quinn: [ Sighs ] Ridge and brooke should be enjoying a lovely future together very shortly.",
        "Sheila: And you're just great with that, right?",
        "Quinn: You know... I hope ridge and brooke are as happy as I am. With eric.",
        "Ridge: [ Sighs ] Now, isn't that better than having lunch with my little brother?",
        "Brooke: Oh, ridge, you know thorne hates you calling him that.",
        "Ridge: Ah, it's an old habit. It dies hard.",
        "Brooke: Well, just try, okay? For me. I hate to see the two of you at odds.",
        "Ridge: You know what I hate? I hate seeing him take advantage of your hospitality.",
        "Brooke: He's not.",
        "Ridge: He is. He moved in with you.",
        "Brooke: I told him to till he found a place.",
        "Ridge: Oh, the man's gonna take his sweet time, I tell you.",
        "Brooke: [ Scoffs ]",
        "Ridge: In the meantime, he's going to keep asking you what happened in australia, why we didn't get married.",
        "Brooke: I didn't tell him about you and quinn, if that's what you're wondering.",
        "Ridge: There's nothing to tell. It's in the past. You know that, right?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah, for the most part. I know that you're sorry, and I know that you regret what you did. Now it's just nice to be able to spend time with you. It's been really good for me and R.J.",
        "Ridge: It's been really good for me.",
        "Brooke: And I want to thank you for letting me have the space to go through what I've been going through, and just being there for me. And thank you for reminding me what we have together.",
        "Ridge: And I'm gonna keep reminding you. We'll get there. I promise we will.",
        "Thorne: I'm right. I can see it in your face. Ridge went after your wife.",
        "Eric: I don't want to talk about this, thorne.",
        "Thorne: Because it upsets you, what my brother did to you.",
        "Eric: Quinn and I have reconciled, all right? No reason to dredge all this up again.",
        "Thorne: Oh, come on, dad. I know you. I know you have this big, forgiving heart. But that ridge could do this to you again... what the hell is wrong with him?",
        "Eric: This is exactly why I didn't want you to know. It's gonna put the two of you head-to-head against each other again.",
        "Thorne: Ridge has done some pretty horrible things, but this? Come on. We have to stand up to him, dad. He can't keep ruining people's lives.",
        "Eric: Nobody's lives have been ruined, all right? Granted, quinn and i went through a rough patch after this. But I forgave her.",
        "Thorne: And ridge too?",
        "Eric: No, I did not forgive ridge. When I found out what he had done, I -- I told him he was no longer my son, and that he was no longer part of this family or this company.",
        "Thorne: Then why is he still? Why is he still acting like top dog at forrester? And in this family?",
        "Eric: Thorne, I'm top dog in this family, in this company, and I will be till the day I die. Life is short. You don't want to hang on to all this animosity. Hanging on to all these bad feelings is just...",
        "Thorne: I know. I understand that. You've told me that before, dad. But what ridge did... he takes and takes, and always gets away with it. No more, dad. I'm back now, and I'm gonna put a stop to it once and for all.",
        "Sheila: I had them put in a slice of tiramisu, because i know that's eric's favorite.",
        "Quinn: Did she handle any of this? Thank you.",
        "Sheila: I was just --",
        "Quinn: Oh, save it, sheila. You're nothing but a conniving, manipulative witch who can't seen to wean herself from her obsession with my husband and everything forrester. But let me tell you something. After what you pulled with mateo, eric's never gonna trust you again. If he ever did in the first place. I know I won'T. So you need to stay away from him, and from the rest of my family, because your days of wreaking havoc for the forresters are over.",
        "Sheila: I still get to her.",
        "Ridge: Are you getting sleepy?",
        "Brooke: Mm... 'cause you know there's probably a couple things I could do to get you going.",
        "Brooke: Hmm?",
        "Ridge: Okay. Too much? Mm. You want to save it for the honeymoon. [ Brooke scoffs ] Okay. I'm with you. That's fine.",
        "Brooke: [ Laughs ] Oh, ridge.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Listen to me. I'm gonna give you space. I promised that. But I'm gonna keep reminding you, because what we have, that only happens once in a lifetime. It's very special. We're gonna make it work this time. Nothing and no one's gonna get in our way.",
        "Eric: Thorne, I don't want you to do this. I don't want you flying off the handle, going after your brother. I don't want this.",
        "Thorne: Really, dad? After what he put you through, you expect me to not say anything?",
        "Eric: It's in the past, thorne. It's all been resolved. I forgave quinn.",
        "Thorne: I understand that. She's one of countless women who's fallen victim to ridge forrester. But to forgive him? Make him C.E.O.?",
        "Eric: Co-C.E.O.",
        "Thorne: That doesn't matter. You know his history. What he's done to you in the past. It wasn't enough that he stole brooke from you? He had to have your current wife, as well? Hell, I didn't even think he liked quinn. Isn't that why he summoned me back here before? To help stop the wedding?",
        "Eric: He was wrong to do that. He was wrong about quinn, too.",
        "Thorne: Obviously, or he wouldn't have hit on her.",
        "Eric: It's more complicated than that.",
        "Thorne: You're damn right it is. And it started with mother's lie. Because she wasn't honest, I've spent my entire life in the shadow of selfish, power- hungry marone! Which is who ridge is -- massimo marone's biological son. Not yours, dad. I carry your dna, not ridge. Maybe that's why it's so easy for him to do the things he's done to you. Maybe deep down, he knows he's not worthy of being your son. Not after all his betrayals. Including his betrayal of brooke. [ Scoffs ] I mean, she's the most extraordinary woman who deserves only the best. Of course, my egotistical brother thinks that's him, but it isn'T. Especially now that I know about him and quinn. Actions have consequences. My brother's gonna learn that the hard way -- from me.",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Quinn: Hi.",
        "Ridge: You're eating alone?",
        "Quinn: Well, your father was supposed to join me, but he got called away. Where have you been?",
        "Ridge: Steam room.",
        "Quinn: With brooke?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, with brooke. Who else?",
        "Quinn: Mm. Oh, no! Did you pop the question?",
        "Ridge: In the steam room?",
        "Quinn: It's been a favorite place of yours over the years for you and brooke. I mean, what better place? Oh! By the way, I ran into sheila, the jailbird- turned-waitress, at il giardino, and I'm telling you, she is looking for dirt. She's looking for something so that she -- what's wrong?",
        "Ridge: Is thorne in the building?",
        "Quinn: He was with your father earlier?",
        "Ridge: What'd he want?",
        "Quinn: Uh, I don't know. He -- he seemed really intense, though.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, he's very intense these days, isn't he?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. He also seems different -- you know, stronger and more assertive.",
        "Ridge: Mm, and up to something.",
        "Quinn: Like?",
        "Ridge: I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry about what happened earlier at the restaurant, ridge practically pulling me away.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, I'm sorry, too. That a brother of mine can treat people that way and keep getting away with it.",
        "Brooke: Well, that's just who ridge is.",
        "Thorne: Rude. Arrogant. Thinks the world revolves around him.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ]",
        "Thorne: Yeah, that's ridge. Can you tell now why I'm so worried about you?",
        "Brooke: Don't be. I can take care of myself.",
        "Thorne: I'm sure my dad felt the same way.",
        "Brooke: What do you mean?",
        "Thorne: I understand now why you didn't want me to know about australia. That the other woman was quinn. Our father's wife.",
        "Brooke: Who told you that?",
        "Thorne: Oh, it doesn't matter. I already spoke to dad about it. I know it's true.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ]",
        "Thorne: This can't go on, brooke.",
        "Brooke: What can't?",
        "Thorne: Ridge! Continuing to get away with things like this. Lies, betrayal. I mean, he cheated on you. Which is horrible enough. But to do it with dad's wife... you must have been horrified.",
        "Brooke: Yes. Yes, I was horrified. And in some ways, I still am. But...",
        "Thorne: No. No, no. No more \"buts.\" No more excuses for my brother. This is all on him. Look, all you did was love him and wanted to be his wife. Which should have been enough for any man. But not ridge, no. He had to go prove that he could conquer any woman he wants, including our father's wife. You shouldn't have to put up with this. Ridge is a perpetual cheater who has broken your heart countless times. I am not gonna let him do that to you again. I'm not. Because you deserve so much better. A man who will be there for you completely. And I'm sure ridge has promised a wonderful future, right? He said he was gonna be there completely. But it's never gonna happen. You know why? Because he's incapable of that. And I understand that this is hard for you to hear, but... you can't do it, brooke. You cannot marry my brother.",
        "Thorne: Stop patronizing me, ridge. I'm done with it.",
        "Ridge: Take it easy. Let's respect my office. Can we do that?",
        "Thorne: Oh, right, of course. Yes, your office. Let me -- let me apologize and bow down to the almighty ridge forrester.",
        "Ridge: What is this? Why do you have this big chip on your shoulder? Why?",
        "Thorne: Because I just got into town! You're already on my case, trying to undermine me, get under my skin, which is working, by the way. But it's done. I'm not putting up with this anymore.",
        "Ridge: Are you gonna cry right now?",
        "Thorne: I am so sick of your condescending attitude, your total lack of respect.",
        "Ridge: Stop overreacting, little brother.",
        "Thorne: All right, I've told you before. Don't ever call me that again.",
        "Brooke: I think it's wonderful that thorne wants to branch out and try his hand in design.",
        "Eric: Well, apparently he's been fully engrossed while he's been in europe, working with other designers. I had no idea.",
        "Quinn: Well, good for him. If he has half your talent, he's gonna do an incredible job.",
        "Brooke: I think his designs are pretty impressive already. Wouldn't you agree, eric?",
        "Eric: I like what I've seen so far. I'm curious to see where he goes with it.",
        "Brooke: As long as ridge doesn't get in the way.",
        "Quinn: Oh, yeah, ridge doesn't seem too thrilled.",
        "Eric: My boys have been very competitive with each other all their lives. But ridge usually ends up getting the upper hand.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, but not in this case.",
        "Eric: Maybe he'll stand up to his brother this time.",
        "[ Seagulls calling ]",
        "Liam: Hey, steffy, what do you want on your salad? Want some tomatoes? Hey. Steffy. You okay? What's wrong?",
        "Thorne: Get it through your head, ridge. I'm not taking your crap anymore.",
        "Ridge: Then maybe you should go back to paris.",
        "Thorne: Oh, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not gonna let you push me out.",
        "Ridge: What do you want? What is it?",
        "Thorne: This is our company, our family business.",
        "Ridge: [ Sighs ]",
        "Thorne: It's not yours. You don't get to tell me what to do.",
        "Ridge: Like it or not, I'm the one that runs this company, little brother.",
        "Thorne: Oh, you son of a bitch. I warned you, do not call me \"little brother\" anymore!",
        "Brooke: What's going on in here?",
        "Ridge: Nothing. It's okay. Ask him.",
        "Thorne: We're fine.",
        "Eric: I don't want the two of you fighting in here.",
        "Brooke: You really need to calm down, both of you. Thorne, let's just go outside and get some fresh air.",
        "Eric: Take him to il giardino. Just take him to lunch.",
        "Brooke: That's a good idea. Come on.",
        "Thorne: You're a bully, ridge. You're used to controlling everyone around you. Well, that's gonna stop. And not just for my sake, but for everyone else'S. You're done mistreating people, especially brooke.",
        "Steffy: Oh, I'm -- I'm fine. I -- I'm sorry. I was just thinking about something else. It doesn't matter now.",
        "Liam: You sure?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Steffy: I'm just happy to be home, having a homemade meal with my husband. It's everything I ever wanted.",
        "Liam: Yes, including tomatoes, which you're getting whether you like it or not.",
        "Steffy: [ Chuckles ] Fine with me.",
        "Liam: This is kind of nice, right? Lunch at home together.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, you know, sometimes I do have good ideas.",
        "Liam: You always have good ideas. Exhibit a -- the fact that my father and I are even speaking to each other. Do you know he offered to help sally get back -- get -- that was really insensitive. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to bring up sally.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.",
        "Liam: No, it's not fine, actually. You've been nothing but understanding, and I -- [ Sighs ] I will never forgive myself for breaking our vows.",
        "Eric: Stop giving thorne a hard time.",
        "Quinn: [ Sighs ]",
        "Ridge: He's so much fun to mess with.",
