        "One of Hope's high heels gets caught in a crack and she tumbles over and over to the bottom of the concrete stairs outside. Quinn is still on the grounds and calls out her name. Liam is trying to call Hope but only gets a voicemail. Wyatt tells Deacon that he doesn't like this but he has no other way than giving Quinn the restraining order. He needs to stop his mom from seeing Hope, otherwise he does not know what will happen. She's not using common sense at all. She needs to stay away. Deacon tries to get him to wait a few months but Wyatt says no. She is not normal and Hope is scared of her and he has to protect Hope. Deacon argues and Wyatt says he knows his mother will be ticked off but it will keep her away and give everyone a chance to cool off. Perhaps after the baby is born, things will be different. Quinn gets to Hope who comes to and is bleeding from the mouth.",
        "Liam rushes to Brooke's to see if Hope is there. He rushes out on the balcony where the door is open. He spies Hope with Quinn bending over her. He pushes Quinn out of the way while accusing her of pushing Hope. He picks Hope up and slowly ascends the stairs back to the house. Then he whisks her to the hospital. Although he is not the husband or the baby's father he insists on being admitted to Hope's admitting room. She has a few scrapes and bruises but no concussion. And they think the baby is okay so Liam tells her to stay positive. She assures him that Quinn did not push her; it was an accident. Quinn goes home and Wyatt has a hard time getting all the facts out of her. She starts by telling him that she went to the baby shower to tell Hope she was backing off. He barks at her that she gets in the way. He tells her she looks scared and he needs to know what happened. Hope's doctor does an ultrasound but finds no heartbeat. Hope cries with Liam quietly standing by."

        "Quinn: Hope!",
        "[Dialing, ringing]",
        "Hope: Hi. It's hope. Leave a message and I will call you back.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Uh, hey. It's me again. Uh, listen, I don't mean to pester you, but nobody knows where Quinn is, and I just have this -- this feeling. Uh, call me back, okay? And if you're still at your mom's house, stay put, 'cause I'm almost there. Okay. Bye. [Sighs]",
        "[Train whistle blows]",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, let me talk to your mom again.",
        "Wyatt: Won't do any good.",
        "Deacon: Just will you give me a chance, please? I mean, before you do something as extreme as a restraining order. I mean, come on, man. It's your mother.",
        "Wyatt: Hey. I don't want to do this. But what choice do I have? She's not getting the message. And hope is freaked out. So am I. And I even grew up with her.",
        "Deacon: I talked to her, all right? She promised me that she'll back off.",
        "Wyatt: She won't. How many times have I told her? And hope doesn't even want her around anymore. She refuses to hear it. No. Maybe a restraining order will finally get her to understand that she has to stay away. I need to stop my mom from seeing hope again. Otherwise... I don't know what'll happen.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, all Quinn wants to do is be a grandmother to your kid.",
        "Wyatt: I get that! I want that, too! But why can't she see that she needs to stay away for that to even happen? If she'd just leave hope alone and just give her some peace and prove to her that she's not some psycho, but no. She's not even using any kind of common sense. Deacon, she showed up to her ultrasound dressed like a freaking nurse. A nurse. Enough is enough. Why would hope want her to be a grandmother to our child? Why would I even want her in my life at all? No. She needs to stay the hell away.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs] Listen. I'm not trying to be condescending here, all right? But you're not a parent. Not yet.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my --",
        "Deacon: Listen to me. You just wait a few months until that baby's born and you hold that baby in your arms for the first time. And then you're gonna understand why she can't stay away.",
        "Wyatt: No. Mom takes parenting to a whole nother level. She's obsessed. She's -- she's dangerous.",
        "Deacon: And you really believe that?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I have been trying not to, man. My whole life, I've been trying to pretend that my mother is just -- she's normal.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: She's just another soccer mom in a minivan. But no. She's not. She's not normal. And hope is scared of her, and as hope's husband, I have got to protect her. I got to keep mom away from her.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Oh, my God. Hope! Hope! Hope? Oh, my God!",
        "Liam: Hope? Hey, hope?! Hope?",
        "[Truck beeping]",
        "Deacon: You texting your mom again?",
        "Wyatt: For the fifth time.",
        "Deacon: You better cool it. She might take a restraining order out on you. Hey, look. If it's any consolation, she's not getting back to me, either.",
        "Wyatt: And you don't know where she is?",
        "Deacon: Nope.",
        "Wyatt: Come on, deacon. You can tell me.",
        "Deacon: Scout's honor, man. Look, I know you're doing this because you think you have to make hope happy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. It will.",
        "Deacon: She'll think so at first. But I know hope. Family is important to her. And she is gonna regret keeping her husband from his mother and keeping your baby from its grandmother.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, so what do you want me to do, deacon?",
        "Deacon: Not a restraining order, for starters. Look, I talked to her. Okay? I broke through to her. She's gonna give hope space.",
        "Wyatt: Talking doesn't work! She just ignores us! She doesn't take us seriously!",
        "Deacon: Okay, but to go to a restraining order? Come on. It's a bit much.",
        "Wyatt: Hope is scared. She's terrified. She knows what my mom is capable of, and you do, too, deacon. She had a sword up to Liam's neck. She was about to kill him. She pushed Ivy off a bridge without even thinking twice. No. Hope is thinking about this baby right now, and that's what I have to do, too. Yes, my mom will be ticked off. She's gonna beg and plead and cry and maybe make a threat or two. But deep down, she'll know that this is the best for us. It's more than just a promise. It'll keep her away, and it gives everybody a chance to cool off. And once the baby's born, maybe circumstances will have changed. Look, you should go.",
        "Deacon: You sure?",
        "Wyatt: I really don't want you around when mom comes back.",
        "Deacon: Might be good to have another person around.",
        "Wyatt: This is between her and me. Please go.",
        "Deacon: Okay. Just remember this. It's not too late to rip those papers up. Your mother -- your mother is dangerous. But not to hope. And certainly not to your child.",
        "Quinn: Here.",
        "Hope: No, don't -- don't touch me, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: You need help.",
        "Hope: Away from me.",
        "Quinn: Hope, please let me help you. Please.",
        "Hope: Just --",
        "Liam: Hope! Hope! Hope! Oh, my God! Oh, no! God! Hope! Oh, God! Quinn, get away from her! Get away! Get away from her right now! Are you okay? Oh, my God! What did you do?",
        "Quinn: It's not what you think!",
        "Liam: You pushed her, didn't you? You pushed her!",
        "Quinn: No! No!",
        "Liam: Oh, God! Come on. Here we go.",
        "Liam: Hope? Get away from her! Get away! Get away from her right now! You pushed her, didn't you?!",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Liam: You pushed her! Oh, God!",
        "Quinn: I'm so excited! I'm gonna be a grandmother!",
        "Hope: I don't want you in our lives.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Hope: I'm going to raise this child with your son... but you will not be a part of that.",
        "Wyatt: Hope and I are having a baby in a few months. Nothing else matters. Whatever hope wants, hope gets. And for now, she doesn't want you a part of her life.",
        "Quinn: We're family. A child is coming. Babies are supposed to bring everyone together. I am asking you again. Please look into your heart and forgive me.",
        "Quinn: I am not a threat! I am a mother and a grandmother, who doesn't want to be ostracized from the people, from the family that means everything in the world to her. Can't you understand that? Can't you have just a little bit of empathy?",
        "[Siren wails]",
        "Liam: Uh, we need help! We need help here!",
        "Nurse: What's going on?",
        "Liam: She fell down some stairs really hard.",
        "Nurse: What's your name, honey?",
        "Hope: Hope Logan.",
        "Liam: Okay. Um, she's pregnant.",
        "Nurse: Room 2 is prepped and ready.",
        "Liam: Okay. I'll see you soon.",
        "Doctor: Are you her husband?",
        "Liam: Um, uh, uh, no.",
        "Doctor: The father of the baby?",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Doctor: I'm sorry. You're just gonna have to wait.",
        "Liam: Listen, I got to be in there. I got to -- I have to go.",
        "Doctor: All right, all right.",
        "Liam: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Quinn: A restraining order? Do you really think that's necessary?",
        "Hope: I absolutely do.",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on, hope. I'm not dangerous. I mean, I'm eccentric, maybe a little bit unpredictable, but, I mean, hey, come on. Isn't that what makes the world go around?",
        "Hope: How many times do we have to have this conversation?",
        "Wyatt: Okay, listen. Mom, there is no way that you should be here right now -- and this -- wearing, sneaking -- terrible idea! Okay? Hope... [Sighs] ...Can't you just see her position? And how she feels about this?",
        "Hope: No!",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Wyatt: Not gonna deal with it right now.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Mom.",
        "Quinn: What are you doing here?",
        "Wyatt: I've been texting you.",
        "Quinn: Have you?",
        "Wyatt: What's wrong?",
        "Quinn: I, um...",
        "Wyatt: You're shaking.",
        "Quinn: Am I?",
        "Wyatt: What happened? Did someone upset you? Mom.",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Who?",
        "Quinn: Me. I'm upset with myself.",
        "Wyatt: Because? Were you with someone just now? Liam? Just Liam or... no. Of course not. You went to go see hope, didn't you?",
        "Doctor: There's no sign of broken bones, but we'll have X-rays just to make sure.",
        "Hope: And the baby?",
        "Doctor: I'll order an ultrasound to make sure the little one is okay.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Doctor: Now, tell me about your fall.",
        "Hope: Um...I guess I just -- I wasn't paying attention. Ow.",
        "Doctor: Does that hurt?",
        "Hope: Yeah a little bit, yeah.",
        "Doctor: Are you having abdominal pain?",
        "Hope: Y-- um... yes? Um, but I -- you know, I really don't know, because my whole body really hurts.",
        "Doctor: Were you alone when you fell?",
        "Hope: No, I was with my mother-in-law. We were arguing.",
        "Liam: She's never gonna touch you again. I'll make sure of that. Did she push you?",
        "Hope: No. No, she didn't. We -- I was upset and when she left, I turned to get up, and I guess my feel got caught, and I just -- I just lost my balance.",
        "Doctor: How frightening. But the good news is you don't have a concussion. Just a few scrapes, and I'm not concerned about that. So, our priority right now is on your baby. I'll go check on the ultrasound machine. Nurse, if you could clean up her scrapes, please.",
        "Nurse: Yes, Doctor.",
        "Hope: You called Wyatt, right?",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, but he didn't pick up, so I left a voicemail. Um... just stay positive, okay? You're okay. Baby's okay. Be positive. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Here. This might help.",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: Well? Isn't this the part where you tell me that you happened upon them accidentally? That you were just minding your own business, and you had no idea hope was near.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, mom, you're really freaking me out right now. Look, this whole situation has gotten way out of hand. Did you go to the baby shower? Is that what this is about? I can see that you did. What happened at the baby shower, mom?",
        "Quinn: It was, um... it was after the baby shower.",
        "Wyatt: Af--",
        "Quinn: Liam... he ran to hope to tattle on me like he always does. I just -- I just wanted hope to know that I wasn't a threat to her, that -- that she had nothing to fear from me, that I was gonna give her the space that she always wanted.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, really?",
        "Quinn: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Uh-huh.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I didn't go there with any malicious reason at all. I -- I just wanted her to know that I was backing off.",
        "Wyatt: So you went to her to tell her that.",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Where?",
        "Quinn: At her mother's house.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: In the backyard.",
        "Wyatt: I asked you to stay away from her! Why is that so hard for you? I mean, you're always just -- you're pushing the things that you want. You're determined, yes. That's what made you a great mother, but you're too determined sometimes. It gets in the way. It gets in the way of you becoming a grandmother to my child. What did you do? Mom, you look scared. I've never seen you this scared. What happened? Mom, what is it?!",
        "Doctor: How are you feeling?",
        "Hope: Nervous.",
        "Doctor: I assume you've had an ultrasound before.",
        "Hope: Yeah, a few weeks ago. We had our first one, and we got to hear the heartbeat. Well, let's hear it again, shall we?",
        "Hope: Okay. [Sighs] Should we hear something by now? Where is it? Where's the heartbeat? No, don't -- it's okay. Don't stop. You can keep looking. It's -- don't stop, please. Don't -- keep going. I -- no, I want to hear it. I want --",
        "Doctor: I'm sorry.",
        "Hope: I want to hear the heartbeat, please. Up here -- no, last time it was up here, so if you keep --",
        "Doctor: I'm sorry. There is no heartbeat. I'm -- I'm sorry. He's gone.",
