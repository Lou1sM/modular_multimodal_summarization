    "Recap": [
        "Liam says he will not let others blame Steffy if she just tells him that she had nothing to do with Ivy being in the hospital. He says he is not blaming her but she was the only witness and others will start talking. Wyatt asks what is the point of Thomas staying here in the room. He is not helping and they will not know what is wrong for a while yet. The doctor asks them to step outside; this information is not for Ivy if she is aware on some level. He says no broken bones but the heart and brain can take a hit so she is not out of the woods yet until neurological tests. Pam tells Zende and Maya to stick around for Eric who is frustrated that he can not get in touch with John. Both of them and Nicole are shocked to hear that Steffy and Ivy were in that room with malfunctioning equipment. No one is saying but she could die from this. Liam checks in and tells Pam to tell Eric there is no more news yet. No one knows what might happen when Ivy comes to. Eric looks through some immigration papers just in case they need it. In the end just as in Stephanie's death that is all there is, just a folder of papers.",
        "Steffy wants to see Ivy alone and tries to speak to her. She says Ivy looks fine and could wake up any moment. She cries so many things keep happening in her life and she wonders why .losing her baby, then Liam and Aly and now this is happening to Ivy. Liam walks back in to hear the last part. He asks for details. Nicole has some morning sickness which Zende wants to hear more about. She says she does not want to be sick around him but it comes on when least expected and not just early in morning. Wyatt tells Thomas that he can not stay here around him. Thomas says this is not some weird competition for Ivy. Wyatt says he does not mind what Thomas is doing to him but he sure as hell does mind what it is doing to Ivy, if she does not recover. Again Steffy does not want to talk about this and shrugs Liam off. He follows and asks if there is something she wants to tell him. She says Ivy was angry and confronted her there in the electrical panel room. Ivy attacked her by grabbing her arm and saying how upset she was about Wyatt knowing. In the melee Ivy was pushed to get her off Steffy. Liam can not believe this keeps happening. Steffy asks him to please believe her."

        "Steffy: What sense does it make to have this conversation now?",
        "Liam: Well, she may not recover, so when should we have it?",
        "Steffy: Whatever I say, people are gonna blame me, Liam.",
        "Liam: Well, I'm not gonna let them... if you tell me that you had nothing to do with the reason Ivy's in that hospital bed right now.",

        "[Machines beeping]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] What point are you trying to make by being in here?",
        "Thomas: I'm not gonna argue with you.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, behind my back's more your style. They don't know much, medically, here, do they?",
        "Thomas: Only what they can see.",
        "Wyatt: What tests did they do on her when they brought her in here? An EKG?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. And an EEG. It's a -- it's a type of a brain scan.",
        "Wyatt: I know what it is.",
        "Thomas: Look, they're not gonna know a whole lot until she's conscious and talking. You may not want to be here for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: What did the EMTs say?",
        "Nicole: Was Ivy conscious when they took her in the ambulance?",
        "Pam: Not that I know of.",
        "Maya: Did someone ride along with her?",
        "Pam: Steffy and Thomas followed behind the ambulance.",
        "Zende: I'll go find out if there's any information.",
        "Pam: You know, Zende? I-I think it would be better if you stuck around for your grandfather.",
        "Maya: Is he talking to Ivy's dad?",
        "Pam: Yeah, well, he's leaving messages for him wherever he can think of.",
        "Eric: [Sighs] How could this happen? My brother's child -- she was left in my care, and she's --",
        "Maya: It's not your fault.",
        "Eric: I can't get in touch with him!",
        "Maya: Well, maybe it's better for the time being, 'cause it seems like things are not certain.",
        "Eric: By the time I get in touch with him, I'll have some good news.",
        "Nicole: I'm sorry. Is this the wrong thing to ask? Nobody is saying how this happened.",
        "Pam: Probably 'cause we're all wondering the same thing.",
        "Nicole: You said it was the showroom electrical panel, right?",
        "Pam: Yes.",
        "Zende: The power's off on that floor. Jake had me block the elevator.",
        "Nicole: But why would Ivy be anywhere near that?",
        "Maya: There wasn't anything going on in the showroom, right?",
        "Nicole: Even if there was, Ivy's not a tech person.",
        "Pam: It -- it was just some kind of horrible accident. That's all I know.",
        "Nicole: But I don't get that, either. I mean, people don't just lounge around on big, imposing pieces of equipment like that.",
        "Pam: Well, no. See, there was a problem with it already. I had to send down an electrician 'cause Jake said it was sparking.",
        "Eric: That's an old electrical panel. It's supposed to be tested and signed off on every month.",
        "Pam: But that's probably why Steffy was down there.",
        "Maya: Wait. Steffy was there? With Ivy?",
        "Pam: Well, yeah. But thank goodness. She's the one who called 911.",
        "Nicole: Well, did she say what happened?",
        "Eric: There wasn't really time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I'm really not up for interrogation right now.",
        "Liam: [Stammers] Steffy...",
        "Steffy: If I'm gonna be blamed for this, does it have to start with you?",
        "Liam: Wait. Who said anything about blame? This is me, okay? I'm always gonna have your back. I'm just...trying to figure out what we're dealing with here, because you are the only witness.",
        "Doctor: Ms. Forrester?",
        "Steffy: Doctor, is there any news?",
        "Doc: I believe you had a brother here.",
        "Steffy: Yes. He's in the room with Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Doc...",
        "Liam: Doctor, do you have, like, some -- some test results or some -- just a better idea of what's going on?",
        "Doctor: Let's step outside. We can't be sure of Ms. Forrester's level of awareness, and this information's not for her, not right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: We've been able to look over Ms. Forrester's scans and x-rays.",
        "Wyatt: Wait. Okay, what do you mean by \"we?\"",
        "Doctor: Uh, the neurologist, cardiologist, and myself. I'm happy to be able to tell you we see no broken bones.",
        "Thomas: Uh...the neurologist. I haven't heard anything from him.",
        "Doctor: I have requested a neuro consult. I'm told she's on her way.",
        "Thomas: But you already did a brain scan, so what did they say?",
        "Doctor: We can only gather limited information while Ms. Forrester is unresponsive. Her scans are not atypical for an unconscious patient.",
        "Liam: Okay, so, but as far as you can tell, she's okay? I mean, is that the -- the takeaway here?",
        "Doctor: The brain and the heart are both very sensitive to electrical stimuli. Until she's awake and alert and talking, we can't rule out lasting consequences on any organ system.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, thanks, Doc.",
        "Doctor: Oh, by the way, the nurses' station's been taking calls from other people identifying themselves as family. Be sure to be in touch with them, okay? The nurses can only say so much, and \"critical condition\" is never easy to hear.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: I didn't want to say this in front of Eric, but... could she die?",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",
        "Zende: Nobody's really saying.",
        "Maya: But nobody's ruling it out.",
        "Nicole: What?",
        "Maya: Nothing. Regrets.",
        "Zende: About what?",
        "Maya: Nicole knows.",
        "Nicole: Things are different now. Ivy and you are good. You are good.",
        "Maya: Yeah, I mean, I -- it's ridiculous for me to even be thinking about myself at all in this situation, but the truth is that when Ivy and I were first...housemates, uh, she had been living there with Eric, Rick and I moved in, and there was tension with her and -- and Aly.",
        "Nicole: That is so over now. And Ivy's actually a big supporter of you now.",
        "Maya: Still... Aly's gone, and I can't do anything about that. And now...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Okay, Liam. Yeah, I'll tell him. And, honey, keep us posted. Yeah, a-a crowd is the last thing that the doctors need right now when they're trying to do their work, so we'll just stay here and try to reach John. Okay. Thanks. Bye.",
        "Eric: You'll tell me what?",
        "Pam: Liam was just basically saying that there's no news.",
        "Eric: That's not what he said.",
        "Pam: Well, he said that there's nothing alarming in any of the tests so far.",
        "Eric: Uh-huh.",
        "Pam: But that doesn't really predict what's gonna happen when she comes to.",
        "Eric: Mm.",
        "Pam: What are you doing?",
        "Eric: Oh, looking at these papers that John gave me -- Ivy's stuff.",
        "Pam: Ivy's birth certificate?",
        "Eric: Yes, and diploma and, uh, insurance -- things that she needed during this whole immigration thing that happened.",
        "Pam: It's good that you have all that.",
        "Eric: Yes, in case they need it.",
        "Pam: Eric, nobody's asked for that.",
        "Eric: Just in case. Well, that's one of the things that happens, isn't it? Folders. When your sister died -- when Stephanie passed away, that's what I ended up with -- a bunch of folders -- certificates of appreciation from this charity or that charity, and the medical records, all of it, and -- and our -- our marriage certificates and all of our divorce decrees -- all of them. [Chuckles] Yeah. In the end, that's all there is -- just a...pile of papers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Excuse me? Dr. Jones says she might be able to hear me.",
        "Nurse: I've heard patients say that it's happened. I'll be back to check on her.",
        "Steffy: Hi, Ivy. It's Steffy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: I'm wondering if I should call my mom. No, I'll just, uh -- I'll wait till I have some more information to tell her.",
        "Maya: Uh, speaking of moms, have -- have you heard from ours since Thanksgiving?",
        "Nicole: Uh, yeah. Mom sends me pictures from the internet. I don't always know why.",
        "Maya: What pictures?",
        "Nicole: Sometimes it's sunsets. Sometimes it's cats.",
        "Maya: [Laughs]",
        "Nicole: Sometimes it's cats being nice to babies.",
        "Maya: [Laughing] Oh, no.",
        "Nicole: But that's been all.",
        "Maya: Well, you know, I really hope maybe things changed on Thanksgiving. Sometimes I even think Dad's coming around. Sometimes -- like, when I haven't seen him in a while. [Chuckles] Go. Go, go, go. Go.",
        "Zende: Go where? Where's she going?",
        "Maya: Morning sickness.",
        "Zende: How long does morning last?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Hey. How's my grandfather?",
        "Liam: Uh, I-I only talked to Pam. Um, I got to get my charger from my car. Are you -- you guys gonna be all right?",
        "Thomas: There's medical care in the building if one of us needs it.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: You know, there's a cab stand out front. Maybe you should go wait in line.",
        "Thomas: I drove my car here.",
        "Wyatt: So leave your keys with your sister. Why would Ivy want to see you when she wakes up?",
        "Thomas: You know, I could ask you the same question. It was -- it was your breaking up that ended Ivy up --",
        "Wyatt: That what? That what? And who says we're broken up? What difference does it make? You're the irresistible Thomas Forrester. I mean, what do you care about people's commitments?",
        "Thomas: You're barking up the wrong tree, man. I don't do the whole wracked- with-guilt thing.",
        "Wyatt: Conscience I know not to look for in you. Taking responsibility either.",
        "Thomas: You know, Ivy made her own decisions.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, nice! Real nice. You're blaming the woman who's lying in a hospital bed right now?",
        "Thomas: There is nobody to blame for an accident.",
        "Wyatt: You caused this. And you know you did. You're the reason why she's here right now.",
        "Thomas: How?",
        "Wyatt: Does it make you feel good all over, huh, knowing that all you gave her was misery?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Ivy... they think you're okay. That's what I got from the doctor. I mean, you look fine, like you're gonna wake up any minute, [Crying] Like you can hear me. I-I just wonder what I'm doing wrong in my life, because all these bad things keep happening around me. The baby -- the baby I should have had with Liam. Aly. You. This. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do this to you.",
        "Liam: Mean to do what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: You okay?",
        "Nicole: Uh, I guess this is normal now.",
        "Zende: Maya told me to tell you she had a model's update.",
        "Nicole: Oh. I saw that on the schedule. [Chuckles] How does that work? \"Okay, girls. You can have an extra carrot this week.\"",
        "Zende: Maya doesn't seem too uptight about food.",
        "Nicole: No, she's not. I'm just thinking about things, being a brat. I don't want to be sick around you. I don't want to be all big and pregnant. But I am. And I will be. And making fun of all the stunning models isn't gonna change that. [Sighs] But I don't -- I don't think I can go out after all. I'm sorry, baby.",
        "Zende: Okay. Uh, we can, uh -- we can watch a movie at home.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] I better not count on doing anything but staying in my room with a bucket by my bed. I'm sorry I let you down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Indistinct chatter]",
        "Wyatt: You know what? I can stay around here, around you.",
        "Thomas: Why don't you go, then?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] You know what? I do need some air, 'cause it stinks in this hospital. It's not your looks, you know?",
        "Thomas: What?",
        "Wyatt: I clean up just as well as you do.",
        "Thomas: Do you think that this is some weird competition for you?",
        "Wyatt: No. I think you're my karma. In some cosmic sense, I mean, I-I probably deserve this. I don't mind so much what you did to me. I mind what you did to her. And if she doesn't make it out of this, if she doesn't recover...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: [Sniffles] Let's not talk here.",
        "Liam: Why not? Whatever you did, she already knows, right?",
        "Steffy: [Sniffles]",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Nurse: Thank you.",
        "Liam: Sure.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Okay. You have something to tell me? Or did I misunderstand?",
        "Steffy: No.",
        "Liam: Steffy, I tried asking you earlier --",
        "Steffy: I never got to answer. Ivy was angry. I told you that.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, we know why.",
        "Steffy: Because Wyatt broke up with her.",
        "Liam: No, not because Wyatt broke up with her. Because you told Wyatt about her and Thomas before she ever got a chance to.",
        "Steffy: She should have told Wyatt right after it happened.",
        "Liam: All right. Whatever. Let's let them decide whether or not it's a breakup.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, whatever. I know how Ivy gets.",
        "Liam: You do?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Steffy: She doesn't give up.",
        "Liam: Okay, Steffy, I-I-I don't know what that means. Yeah, she's hardly at a loss for words. So?",
        "Steffy: Sparks were flying at the -- at the panel. Remember? And then Jake went to shut the power off and Ivy came up to me and she -- she attacked me.",
        "Liam: She -- like, physically?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah, she grabbed my arm, and... and she was talking about how upset she was about Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Well, are you really surprised? I mean, you knew she'd have some kind of reaction.",
        "Steffy: I can't unsay what I said to Wyatt. I tried to stay away.",
        "Liam: Okay. [Chuckles] Did it occur to you to walk away?",
        "Steffy: I already told you. I told you. I was looking after the electrical panel. And then Ivy came up to me. Not to mention she was cornering me. She started yelling at me. She grabbed me, and then she grabbed my phone, and she -- she threw it. She threw it towards the electrical panel, and I -- and I pushed her.",
        "[Electricity crackling]",
        "Liam: You pushed her? You -- great.",
        "Steffy: No, I pu-- I pushed her becau-- I pushed -- it was when I went to pick up the phone. She grabbed me again, and I went to push her away. I just wanted her off of me. Anyone would have done the same thing.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but you're not anyone. This was you. How is it possible that this keeps happening?",
        "Steffy: Liam, don't! Don't. Don't you believe me? Please. Please believe me."
