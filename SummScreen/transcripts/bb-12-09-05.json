        "Nick: It's my son. Yes, you are. I don't even know his name.",
        "Felicia: It's Dominick.",
        "Nick: Well, what do you know? Hey, that's my name, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darla: So you have no idea why Sally wanted to see us?",
        "Thorne: No, I don't. Maybe just to tie up some loose ends.",
        "Darla: I don't know, Thorne. I've got a funny feeling. And when Sally's concerned, it's not a good thing.",
        "Thomas: Hey, guys.",
        "Thorne: Sally called you, too?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, she told me to bring everyone up.",
        "Bob: Something about a meeting.",
        "Darla: Oh, god. Okay, now I know something's going on. God -- whatever it is, it must be big.",
        "Clarke: Are you sure you want to do this, sally? Maybe you should give it a little more thought.",
        "Sally: I need this, Bucky. We're going to have to do it my way, and on my terms.",
        "Clarke: Azoy.",
        "[ Knocking on door ]",
        "Thorne: Sal, hey, are you ready for us?",
        "Sally: Sure, sure, come on in, come on in.",
        "Clarke: Yeah, yeah, come right in. Have some punch, some pigs in a blanket.",
        "Bob: What's the occasion?",
        "Sally: It is a bon voyage party, Bob.",
        "Darla: Oh, that's really sweet, Sal. But you didn't have to give Thorne a sendoff.",
        "Sally: Well, it's not for Thorne, honey. It is for the good ship Spectra. She is going to pull in her sails and head for drydock.",
        "Thorne: You're closing the business?",
        "Sally: That's right, Thorne. When I walk out of here today, I'm shutting the doors for good.",
        "[ Murmuring ]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You really have to help me to understand how you could do this. How could you keep this child a secret from me?",
        "Felicia: After the cancer, the chemo, nobody ever thought that I could carry a baby to term. The odds were so low, I didn't want to get my hopes up, Nick, so -- I didn't want to make an announcement, get everybody involved. And now, I'm really glad that I didn't.",
        "Nick: Why?",
        "Felicia: Because you and Bridget are happy. And you're starting a family of your own. And I know that you two have been through so much.",
        "Nick: Stephanie, what did you tell her?",
        "Stephanie: I told her everything, Nick.",
        "Felicia: But you guys are okay now. The problems you and Bridget had are over.",
        "Nick: The problems that Bridget and I had were a lack of honest communication.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, are you asking him not to tell Bridget?",
        "Felicia: Yes, Mother, I am. I don't want to put this on her. You guys have a life together. Nothing has to change, not for anybody. We can go back to France.",
        "Nick: No. No, you won't.",
        "Felicia: Nick, I am not asking you for anything.",
        "Nick: I am this boy's father. And he's not going anywhere.",
        "Nick: You know, I didn't know my real father when I was growing up. Dominick's going to know me.",
        "Felicia: Think about what you're saying, Nick. You and Bridget are married. She's pregnant with your child. You don't need this kind of complication.",
        "Nick: He's my son, I'm going to be there for him. Exactly the way I am right now. It's what a kid needs, you know? Not some long distant phone call, a goodnight, they need their father there to tuck them in and be there for them. And teach them how to fish and sail, and all the things I never had in my life.",
        "Stephanie: You're happy about this?",
        "Nick: I'm happy.",
        "Stephanie: That's wonderful.",
        "Felicia: How's Bridget going to feel about it?",
        "Nick: We'll work it out.",
        "Felicia: What if you can't? You have to at least consider the possibility.",
        "Nick: I'm telling her about this. I'm going to tell her tonight. But I want you to promise me that you won't go anywhere.",
        "Stephanie: I won't let her.",
        "Nick: Promise me.",
        "Felicia: All right.",
        "Nick: We'll be spending a lot of time together, okay? I'll see you real soon, Dominick.",

        "Bob: You're closing up?",
        "Darla: Sally, no.",
        "Sally: Please, come on. The time has definitely come. Here, Bucky.",
        "Clarke: Yes?",
        "Sally: Would you give that punch a kick, and give everybody a glass.",
        "Clarke: You got it.",
        "Sally: Darla, Darla, take these. Pass them out.",
        "Darla: Okay. Bob. Here, sweetie. There you go.",
        "Bob: Sally, I can't accept this.",
        "Sally: Of course you can, bob. It's only what you deserve. It's what you all deserve. Come on, you didn't think I was going to run out on you, leave you high and dry, did you?",
        "Thomas: No, Sally, I can't take this. This is all my fault.",
        "Sally: No, Thomas, it's not. This is about me. I'm getting tired. I'm getting tired of pulling rabbits out of this tired, old hairdo of mine. I have earned a vacation, and I am going to take it.",
        "Clarke: This calls for a toast.",
        "Sally: Hear, hear.",
        "Clarke: To family. To all those that are here, and to all those that are here in spirit.",
        "Sally: Because that's what we were, weren't we? Family. And that is what made this company great. So, what do you say? Let's drink to that.",
        "Clarke: To Spectra.",
        "Bob: No, to Sally. [ All together ] To Sally.",
        "Sally: Thank you. Thank you all for everything. For your service, and your affection. And I'm going to miss you more than you will ever know. Now, if I were you, I would go out and cash those checks. Pronto!",
        "Bob: Sally --",
        "Sally: No, no, no, Bob. Come on, no blubbering, no sentiment, no hugs. I'm not saying good-bye. What I'm saying is, come on, get out of here! Scram, please! [ All together ] We love you, Sally.",
        "Sally: Give me a break. Get out of here.",
        "Darla: I'm not going to let you do this, Sally. Here. This company is your life.",
        "Sally: Are you kidding? I've been working behind this desk for too many years. I'm ready to stop. I'm ready to play. Honey, my life is just starting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: That was fast.",
        "Felicia: Dominick's easy to get down.",
        "Stephanie: He must take after his father.",
        "Felicia: Let's talk about his father.",
        "Stephanie: I felt he had a right to know about the baby.",
        "Felicia: That should have been my decision.",
        "Stephanie: He wants to be a part of the baby's life. Isn't that what you wanted?",
        "Felicia: You don't care what I want. You don't care what anybody wants. That's what you do, Mother. You take over people's lives. You usurp their choices. Truth is best for you. Nothing makes you happier than to be able to say that.",
        "Stephanie: I believe that Nick would step up. I believe that he would accept his responsibility where this baby is concerned.",
        "Felicia: Let's hope you're right, Mother. Because now, thanks to you, he has two of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hi.",
        "Bridget: Oh, hey, honey. I'm so excited that you're finally home.",
        "Nick: You cooked dinner.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, well, I'm just keeping it warm right now, but I'll go get it. Where have you been?",
        "Nick: You know there's actually a reason that I'm running a little late. Give me those. Sit down, get off your feet. You're not supposed to be on your feet so much. Plus, you cooked this meal.",
        "Bridget: How nice is this? A quiet night in, just like normal people. We're able to have dinner and relax, and reconnect.",
        "Nick: Talk.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, exactly. Most people would probably think this is mundane and totally boring. But after everything that we've been through I can't think of anything else that I'd rather be doing. Just no more crisis or mind blowing revelations. Oh, honey, you have no idea how nice it is to be over all of that drama.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: Bridget loves Nick. I don't want to take him away from her.",
        "Stephanie: But you want him to know his son.",
        "Felicia: How do you think Bridget's going to react to that?",
        "Stephanie: Knowing the kind of person that she is, I have to see this is exactly why I stayed away.",
        "Stephanie: No it isn't. You didn't even know that they were involved, much less married.",
        "Felicia: Well, I assumed he was involved with somebody, Mother.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, come on.",
        "Felicia: I can't stay here.",
        "Stephanie: You told Nick that you would.",
        "Felicia: Yeah, well, you're going to call him and tell him that I can't. And I'm going to call the airport and book me, Dominick, and Renee on the next flight to France.",
        "Stephanie: Why are you doing this? Why are you running away?",
        "Felicia: Why do you think?",
        "Stephanie: Because you're still in love with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sally: Come on, Darla, stop blubbering around. This is good news.",
        "Darla: Sally, you love this company. I know you don't want to leave.",
        "Sally: Don't I? Well, let's see. I got two choices. Do I stay here in this dusty old office, or do I sail the seven seas surrounded by a platoon of handsome sophisticated men?",
        "Thorne: Joining the navy?",
        "Sally: I'm taking a world cruise. One that guarantees three eligible bachelors for every woman onboard. [ Phone rings ] Sally Spectra.",
        "Ronnie: Hi, miss Spectra, this is Ronnie from the Happy Acres Assisted Living Facility. Just wanted to let you know that the van's on its way to pick you up.",
        "Sally: Really, you are? Now? Well, that's just great, captain. Thank you.",
        "Darla: Captain?",
        "Sally: Just have the driver buzz when he arrives. Bye. How about that? The captain is sending a limo to pick me up, so I think you bums better scram.",
        "Darla: Sally, please. Think about this, please.",
        "Sally: Don't you dare. Don't you dare. Hey guys no, no Darla. No sloppy good- byes.",
        "Sally: I want you to go. Both of you. I'll send you a post-card. It'll say, \"too bad you're not here.\"",
        "Clark: Isn't it rich isn't it clear losing my timing this late in my career but where are the clouds there ought to be clouds",
        "Sally: Azoy.",
        "Clark: Well, maybe next year .",
        "Sally: Come on, Clarkey. Get me out of here.",
        "Darla: Thorne, I know there's",
        "Darla: Thorne, I know there's something wrong.",
        "Thorne: You heard what --",
        "Darla: Clarke? Sally, what are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bridget: Look at us. Look at this. Look at our lives. Everything we have to look forward to. We're about to move into our first house together. You're about to welcome your first born child into the world. It's going to just be the three of us. Our little family.",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Bridget: I think I want to have more kids. I do, but I mean, not right away. Obviously. I want to give this little princess some time to just enjoy our undivided attention before she has a little brother or sister, but -- what is it, honey? I'm sorry, gosh. I've been going on and on about how great things are for us, but I didn't even ask you -- how was your day? Something's bothering you, obviously. I want to know.",
        "Nick: There's just something that I have to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: You said the breakup with Nick was mutual.",
        "Felicia: Mother, if I'm not the one he wants to be with, I'm not going to hang around wishing I was.",
        "Stephanie: Well, that doesn't mean you have to leave Los Angeles.",
        "Felicia: They don't want me here.",
        "Stephanie: I want you. Nick will.",
        "Felicia: Because of the baby.",
        "Stephanie: It's time to stop running. It's time to come home, Felicia.",
        "Felicia: Mother, Dominick and I are happy in France.",
        "Stephanie: If you stay in Los Angeles, you can give that baby so much more than you can in France. His family. His father. And you can give me the chance to make amends for the mistakes that I've made with you. I know I'm the reason that you've stayed away so long. We've had our problems, but I want that to end, all right? I've learned a lot these past few months. I've had a real comeuppance. And family is -- it's so precious to me, and I'm not just talking about Ridge. I know that's what you always think, but it's not. I see so much of myself in you. Your independence and your stubbornness. You were like that from the day you were born. You were. You're always your own special person. Felicia, please. I want the time to get to know that person again. I want the time to get to know my grandson. I don't know how this is going to affect Bridget. I do know that it will be very difficult for her to find out. You know, about your child.",
        "Felicia: Oh, Mom.",
        "Stephanie: Honey, look, no matter what happens, you see what I'm saying? We'll work through it together. Felicia? Felicia? My god. Felicia? Felicia?"
