        "Liam tells Hope that they have to move forward; they can't stand still. They have to do this. And he wants her to cut all ties with Wyatt and his mom at FC. She realizes he is giving her an ultimatum and doesn't feel right about it. He says they just got sidetracked. He loves her and he knows she loves him. He is so done with Wyatt and his games and Quinn and her obsession. There is not one single good reason they can't get married now. All those obstacles are out of the way. Steffy is gone, his dad is not interfering and remember Amber, well she is long gone too from causing problems. He only wants to focus on her. There is not one single reason they shouldn't get married. But there is Wyatt. She admits that she let that go too far for too long but he doesn't deserve to lose his job over this. Liam assures her that Wyatt and his mom have come a long way and they can do just about anything they want to now so they will be okay. He convinces Hope that they don't even need FC anymore. Wyatt and Quinn are bad for them and the only way to make sure they do no harm is to cut them out. She says she will talk to Wyatt tonight. He tells her to come home tonight and they can talk and celebrate. She says okay. Everything else has been dealt with, even Steffy, so she does not feel she has to share him anymore. And she promises that he will not have to share her. Ricardo meets with Eric and tells him how pleased he is with the fame of the diamond and how it has boosted sales. Now it is time for him to take it home. But this is not goodbye to Wyatt and Quinn. The diamond is wanted around the world and he'd like Wyatt to take it to India ..with Hope of course. Wyatt is blown away and of course Quinn looks very pleased. Wyatt says the diamond has left the building. Eric adds and it has done its job. Wyatt tells Quinn and Eric that he's not needed now and he has big plans tonight. Wyatt says that Ricardo gave him some ideas so he has other plans now that he needs to go take care of. Quinn fills Eric in that Wyatt is seeing Hope tonight. Eric is a little surprised they are getting that close. Wyatt says with the right motivation and incentive and Hope by his side, the sky is the limit. And that is more than good chemistry. That's his future and he's going to fight for it. No way is he going to give up the best thing that has ever happened to him. Quinn gives Eric a gift. It's her way of thanking him for all that he has brought into her life. It's a pair of stunning gold cufflinks E.F. and she puts it on his shirt and makes a remark that besides being for the men's line in the future, this partnership might go places they have not even thought of yet. Wyatt scrambles to make his place look romantic with a Bollywood theme, setting the mood with music and movies. Quinn shares with Eric that she could never thank him enough. He's given her and her son national exposure. She's even managed to buy a new car an electric one so she can get rid of that old gas guzzler and it's all because of him. He chuckles that he's very glad then. Not only is he helping her and her son but the entire planet. She says he has done more than help, he has inspired her and Wyatt. She has never seen such changes in him; he's so focused and determined. The way he talks about his future, it's music to a mother's ears. She does believe there is a future for him and Hope and she believes Hope will think so too by the end of the night. She makes a prediction. This could be a very big evening for those two.",
        "A nervous Hope says Wyatt's place is so exotic. He says he was shooting for romantic. She says it looks like the Taj Mahal. He says he has always wanted to go. She says her too. He tells her they have been invited. One of Ricardo's contacts wants to meet them as soon as possible. And there are other dealers all over the world. He's excited and says there are so many places he wants to take her and things he wants to show her. He's always had it in the back of his head but after talking to Ricardo today it really bought it out. He takes both of her hands in his and says this is the start of something. She unclasps her hands and he says he knows as he is very sad about the diamond going too but there are other jewels and they will find them. Hope finally says it is not about the diamond. She talked to Liam earlier today. They talked about their wedding and he gave her an ultimatum. Obviously Wyatt takes it the wrong way and says he is sorry. She says she is too. She needs to sever all ties with Quinn Artisian Jewelers and she has to end her relationship with Wyatt. He's in disbelief and says no. Liam has tried that before. Hope says again that she is sorry but she can't work with him. He wants to know why. They make a great team; the profits are out of sight. Liam can't do this. Hope says Liam is not doing this; she is doing this. They do make a great team. Everything they have done with the diamond and the collection has been fantastic. He says then they need to continue. She says he can. Him and his momma absolutely can. They don't even need Forrester any more. He asks what about them. She says she wishes she could say they could still be friends, but Liam thinks ..Wyatt is frustrated and blurts out that he doesn't care what Liam thinks. She says but she does. She cares because they are getting married. They have to end it .. all of it professionally and personally. She can not see him anymore. Deflated, Wyatt says this is so wrong. She says no, what is wrong is what she put Liam through. She dragged it out way too long and it wasn't fair. She admits they had some good times together and he adds it made her happy. She says over and over that she is sorry it has to end this way. He pleads with her to please do not do this. She says they can not see each other any more. He nixes that and says no and grabs her and kisses her, even a second time and she responds."

        "Wyatt: The diamond has left the building.",
        "Quinn: It did its job.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Eric: And so did the two of you. Well done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Liam, I-I want to say yes.",
        "Liam: Okay, well, give me one reason not to.",
        "Hope: Liam...",
        "Liam: Go ahead. Give me a reason. It won't be good enough.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Look, I-I know that I let things with Wyatt get out of hand. I know that I let it go on too long.",
        "Liam: I know. And that's okay, because now you can end it...for good.",
        "Hope: Well, there's -- I mean, there's so much to think about. There's business involved.",
        "Liam: Yeah, what business?",
        "Hope: Quinn and Wyatt. They've worked so hard.",
        "Liam: Have they worked harder than us?",
        "Hope: Well, it's just that they're finally in a place --",
        "Liam: In a place in their lives where they can have everything they've ever wanted for as long as they can remember. That sound familiar?",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: I'm just -- I'm done waiting, Hope. I mean, there's no going back for us, and we can't stand still. Either we move forward or... [Sighs] You have to cut Wyatt out. Let's do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: If you kids don't mind, I'm gonna take off.",
        "Quinn: Oh, you got to get home? Get the bacon in the pan?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Actually, talking to Ricardo has given me a few ideas. I have to make a few stops before tonight.",

        "Wyatt: Don't get any bigger.",
        "Quinn: He's meeting hope.",
        "Eric: [Chuckling] Oh. So, uh, things are going well between the two of you?",
        "Wyatt: Well, I mean, we've got a long way to go. You know, Hope and Liam have been on this merry-go-round for so long, I just -- but now I have the motivation and the incentive that I need. I think about what we've accomplished -- going to Mexico and getting the diamond and the fashion show. With Hope by my side, the sky's the limit. You know, and that's more than just good chemistry. That's my future, and I'm gonna fight for it. There's no way I'm giving up the best thing that's ever happened to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You're right. I can't give you a single good reason why we shouldn't get married.",
        "Liam: 'Cause there isn't one. I mean, not anymore. Steffy, my dad, Amber -- remember Amber?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: I mean, all the problems we've ever had, they're over. They're done with. [Chuckles] I love you. I-I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and only you. You asked me to wait. I did. You asked for time. I gave it to you. But...enough is enough. [Chuckles] We deserve this. We deserve to be happy now. Because there's nothing left for us to prove to each other. We just -- we got side tracked is all. I think what we have to do now is cut out all the distractions and focus on...each other. 'Cause, I mean, isn't that what you've always wanted from me?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Liam: [Sighing] Okay. So...I'm gonna ask you one more time. What --",
        "Hope: Nothing. I'm not waiting for anything.",
        "Liam: So...?",
        "Hope: So, let's do it. Let's get married.",
        "Liam: So -- so, you're saying yes?",
        "Hope: I love you, and I don't want to wait anymore. I want to marry you.",
        "Liam: No reservations? Really?",
        "Hope: Not about you. But... breaking the contract with Quinn and Wyatt is -- is that absolutely necessary?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Yes, that's exactly what I want. Thank you. So, Quinn, what's next?",
        "Quinn: India.",
        "Eric: For Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: And Hope.",
        "Eric: What about you?",
        "Quinn: Oh, I have some ideas.",
        "Eric: Anything you want to share?",
        "Quinn: Well, since you asked...",

        "Eric: Oh, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Here.",
        "Eric: These are beautiful.",
        "Quinn: My son wears jewelry, but not every man does.",
        "Eric: So you were thinking of these for the men's line?",
        "Quinn: In the future, who knows? But I think this partnership can go places that we haven't even thought of yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: All right. Aah! No. White couch. Got to get that. All right. Indian food. Bollywood movies. I'll leave those there. Music. That should --",
        "[Indian music plays]",
        "Wyatt: All right. What else? Set the mood. [Chuckles] Mm. You can feel it -- her power, energy. I want to share this with you. I want to share everything with you. No one but you. There will never be another in my life.",

        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: [Sighs] I can't. I just -- I can't trust them. I so wish I did, for you.",
        "Hope: Wyatt told me that he would respect our marriage.",
        "Liam: I know, but what about his mother?",
        "Hope: She will, too, once we're married.",
        "Liam: And until we are?",
        "Hope: All right. I admit that Quinn took things a little far.",
        "Liam: You see, that's the thing. I mean, once Quinn hears about us getting married, she might begin to think that she didn't go far enough, and Wyatt -- I mean, you put a clock on this, and he's gonna come after you even harder.",
        "Hope: No. No.",
        "Liam: But he won't have a chance to if you guys aren't... working together.",
        "Hope: Well, Caroline can take over as liaison. I mean, she's the designer. She knows what pieces go best with the collection.",
        "Liam: Oh, Caroline will have no problem finding another jewelry designer.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Oh, God. Partnering with Forrester was so huge for them.",
        "Liam: I know. And now it can be so huge for somebody else who deserves it.",
        "Hope: You know, Eric really, really likes working with Quinn.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I-I know. She's been, uh, pretty cozy with him, lately. She was stuck to him like glue at thanksgiving.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: I mean, for all I know, Quinn's plans for Eric may be the same as Wyatt's for you. But Quinn and Wyatt, they're bad for us. There's -- there's something wrong with them, and the only way that we can prevent them from doing us harm is to cut them out.",
        "Hope: Their business --",
        "Liam: Their business is doing better than it's ever done. I mean, they're gonna be fine. They don't even -- they don't even need Forrester anymore at this point. Not like I need you.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Liam: Okay?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah. I will -- I will talk to Wyatt tonight. I was gonna go over there anyway, so...",
        "Liam: You had plans?",
        "Hope: He just said that he wanted to see me.",
        "Liam: Do you, uh -- do you want me to come with you, be the bad guy?",
        "Hope: No. I can handle it.",
        "Liam: Okay. Come home after you do. We'll celebrate and...talk about the wedding.",
        "Hope: Okay. You were right, Liam. Everything has been dealt with, even Steffy. I don't feel like I'm sharing you anymore, and I promise you will not have to share me. Okay?",
        "Liam: Okay.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Quinn, these are beautiful. They're really -- they're really stunning. But I meant what I said. You've, um -- you've thanked me enough.",
        "Quinn: Are you kidding me? What you have done for me and my son -- how could I ever thank you enough?",
        "Eric: Forrester gave you the chance, but you ran with it.",
        "Quinn: Mm, no. You gave us an international spotlight. We could have never done that on our own... and the diamond... and the car that I just ordered.",
        "Eric: [Laughs] What? A car?!",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Well, it's electric, but it has always been a dream of mine. And now I can finally get rid of that old gas guzzler. Again, because of you.",
        "Eric: Well, you've made me very proud. Because not only have I been able to help you and your son, but I'm helping the entire planet, as well.",
        "Quinn: [Laughing] You've done more than help us, Eric. You've inspired us.",
        "Eric: You've done the same for me.",
        "Quinn: Nothing compares to the changes that I've seen in my son. I've never seen him so -- so focused and determined. The way he talks about his future, it's -- its music to a mother's ears.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: And the way he talks about Hope. Yes. He means it, Eric. He's gonna give her everything that he promised.",
        "Eric: So, you're convinced there's a future for those two?",
        "Quinn: I am. And I believe that Hope will be, too, by the end of the night. You watch. This could be a very big evening for those two.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Wow.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] I hope you're hungry. The food's hot.",
        "Hope: Did you make this?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] No. No, Indian food is a little bit out of my league. Um...you like Indian food?",
        "Hope: Ye-yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Good, 'cause hamburgers wouldn't really fit the decor. Uh, cows are sacred there, you know?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] It's so exotic.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I was, uh, shooting for romantic.",
        "Hope: Like the Taj Mahal in here.",
        "Wyatt: I've always wanted to go. What about you?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: 'Cause...we've been invited.",
        "Hope: To India?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckling] Yeah. Yeah, one of Ricardo's contacts -- they want to meet us as soon as possible.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: So, what do you say -- another getaway, just the two of us?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: You should have heard Ricardo today. He -- he was so impressed with us.",
        "Hope: Well, we made a good team.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. And the Hope for the Future diamond was just the beginning. Other dealers want to talk to us from all over the world. God, there are -- there are so many places that I want to take you. There's so many things I want to show you. And they -- they've always been in the back of my mind, it's just, talking to Ricardo today, everything seemed like such a possibility. You know? This is -- this is the start of something. You know? And -- and...",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Hope... hey. I mean, when -- I know. When Estefan took the diamond and put it in the box, I was -- I was sad, too.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: I miss having it around -- the power and -- you know, but there's other jewels, and we'll -- we'll find them.",
        "Hope: Um... it's not about the diamond. I-I talked to Liam earlier today. We talked about our wedding. And he gave me an ultimatum.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Uh, wow. I'm -- that sucks. I'm sorry.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry, too. We need to end our relationship with Quinn Artisan Jewelers. And I have to end my relationship with you.",
        "Wyatt: No, no. I mean, he's -- he's tried that before.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I-I-can't work with you anymore.",
        "Wyatt: Why? I mean, we're great together. The write-ups are amazing. The profits are -- he can't do this.",
        "Hope: I'm doing it. Not him. I'm doing it.",
        "Wyatt: You just said that we were a good team here.",
        "Hope: We are. We are. Everything that -- that we've done with the diamond and with the collection has been really amazing, and it's really put things in motion for us.",
        "Wyatt: That's why we have to keep going.",
        "Hope: You can. You absolutely can. You and -- and your mom -- you don't even need Forrester anymore.",
        "Wyatt: What about us?",
        "Hope: I wish that we could still be friends, but Liam thinks --",
        "Wyatt: I don't care [Sighs] About what Liam thinks.",
        "Hope: I do. I care, because -- because we are getting married.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, God.",
        "Hope: He's going to be my husband, and that means that we have to end it. We have to end all of it, professionally and personally. I can't see you anymore.",
        "Wyatt: This is so wrong.",
        "Hope: No, it's -- [Sighs] What's wrong is what I put Liam through. I dragged this out way too long, and...you know, we did some great things together. Spending time with you --",
        "Wyatt: Made you happy.",
        "Hope: It wasn't fair.",
        "Wyatt: This isn't fair -- this -- for me or for you.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that it has to end this way.",
        "Wyatt: Hope -- Hope, don't. Please don't.",
        "Hope: We cannot see each other anymore.",
        "Wyatt: No. Not a chance."
