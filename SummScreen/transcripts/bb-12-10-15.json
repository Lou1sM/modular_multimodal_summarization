        "Steffy tells Liam that she knows he is upset but she is not letting him off the hook and she is not taking off his engagement ring. Eric fills Ridge and Caroline in on that Ivy was lucky that Steffy was there and called the paramedics and everything is under control. Ridge wants to know how Steffy was involved in this. Caroline wonders if an argument ensued over Wyatt. The doctor tells Ivy that he is pleased with her progress. Wyatt tells Thomas that Steffy may feel guilty but this is all Thomas's fault for letting things get to this point and Ivy confronting Steffy in first place. Thomas says Wyatt can blame him for a lot of things but not this accident. Thomas says Wyatt is dead wrong; he cares about Ivy. Thomas says Wyatt is angry and he realizes he has to be the bad guy but he isn't. Wyatt says he knows he told his sister his dirty little secret and that is what this is all about. He ought to feel guilty for pouring on all this charm and this game he is playing with Ivy is over; Thomas will be sorry if not and Wyatt will make sure of it.",
        "Liam tells Steffy that he is not asking her to apologize but he did warn her not to get involved. She says they did not fight; she did not attack Ivy. She was not looking for trouble. He says he knows she did not want this to happen and she did right by calling the paramedics but these things keep happening on her watch. She says he is a good person but they are different people and handle things differently. She says maybe they need to simplify things. Maybe she should move out until they marry. He asks her not to jump to that extreme; do not go. Ivy tells Wyatt that she is so sorry about what happened involving Thomas. Caroline reveals there has been gossip in the office that there was some trouble between Ivy and Steffy and there may have been another man involved. Thomas comes in and says her over protective boyfriend is looking over her so no one has to worry about that, they are a lock. Ridge is not surprised to find the other man may be Thomas. Ivy tells Wyatt that she should have known Thomas was playing her. He says he was really scared when he got that phone call today and when this is over he wants it to go back to the way it was with no Thomas. He never should have walked out on her and wouldn't if he knew the whole story. She says Steffy simply beat her to it in telling him the truth. She realizes now how much she needs him by her side. He asks her to please relax and kisses her on the forehead. Liam tells Steffy that Ivy will make a full recovery. He believes her even when she reacts impulsively. He says they are not married yet but this is their home and they can do two things at once, just trust him. He will always be in her corner. They end up making love and he says they survived and avoided another disaster. And that is not true for every couple. But for them problems arise and they know what they have and overcome. Wyatt tells Ivy that he is so grateful that he did not lose her. Ivy remembers and says Steffy is dangerous. She remembers her pushing her."

        "Steffy: No. No. I'm not -- I'm not taking off this ring. I know you're upset and confused right now, but we can -- we can deal with this.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I'm upset, because Ivy almost died, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: The doctor says she's gonna be fine, thankfully.",
        "Liam: That doesn't change how she got hurt.",
        "Steffy: I am not asking you to let me off the hook. I messed up. I know that, and I feel terrible about this. But we can't let a horrible accident end our -- end our engagement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Why didn't you call us?",
        "Eric: There wasn't time. Ivy was down. She wasn't responding.",
        "Ridge: Oh, boy.",
        "Caroline: But she's okay now? She's stable?",
        "Eric: Yeah. I've been in contact with the hospital the whole time, when I wasn't trying to get John on the phone.",
        "Caroline: Oh, he and Ivy's mom must be absolutely frantic.",
        "Eric: They were, but they were very relieved to find that she's recovering now.",
        "Caroline: I couldn't even imagine getting a call like that.",
        "Eric: Ivy was lucky Steffy was there. Called the paramedics as soon as it happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: So, what's the verdict?",
        "Dr. Jones: Your condition is improving. How do you feel?",
        "Ivy: I'm not as foggy was I was.",
        "Dr. Jones: Very good. I'll be back to check your cognitive function later, and we'll have to monitor your burns for any sign of infection, but so far... I'm encouraged by your progress, Ivy.",
        "Ivy: Thanks. Hey, is Wyatt still out there?",
        "Dr. Jones: I passed him on the way in. He was out in the hall with Mr. Forrester.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thomas: Ivy's awake, all right? You want to know what happened? Ask her. I wasn't there.",
        "Wyatt: No, but your sister was. Was Steffy responsible for this?",
        "Thomas: Steffy called 911, all right? She got Ivy help as quick as she could.",
        "Wyatt: What about you? What was your role in all this?",
        "Thomas: I'm here for Ivy, just like everybody else.",
        "Wyatt: No. See, I think this is your fault. Steffy feels guilty, sure, but you -- you set this whole chain of events in motion... that put Ivy in a hospital bed.",
        "Thomas: Okay. What happened to Ivy was nobody's fault. It was an accident. There was an electrical panel being repaired.",
        "Wyatt: Ivy would never have been anywhere near it if it wasn't for you.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] Okay. You can blame me for a lot of things, but not that. I've never wanted to see Ivy hurt.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, really? Because you didn't think about the consequences, did you? The chaos your little seduction would cause -- that didn't even cross your mind, 'cause the rules don't apply to you. It didn't matter that Ivy had a boyfriend or that Steffy told you to stop. You did it anyway, and now look what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: I'm sorry.",
        "Liam: I'm not asking you to apologize.",
        "Steffy: I upset you.",
        "Liam: It's not -- it's not about you and me. I-I asked you, I warned you, \"don't get involved. Let Ivy and Wyatt work it out on their own.\"",
        "Steffy: Ivy got in my face. She was upset. We -- we didn't fight. I swear to you, Liam, I didn't attack her. You have to believe me. This -- this wasn't my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I don't know any of the specifics.",
        "Ridge: You don't know? She didn't tell you?",
        "Eric: It was chaotic, Ridge. The paramedics were working on Ivy. They were trying to get a pulse from her.",
        "Caroline: Her heart stopped?!",
        "Eric: Yes. Steffy was doing CPR, and the paramedics didn't get a pulse until they used the paddles.",
        "Ridge: Well, why was Ivy down there in the showroom anyway?",
        "Eric: She was looking for Steffy. Pam says she was upset.",
        "Ridge: Upset about what?",
        "Eric: Pam reads too much in to these things sometimes.",
        "Caroline: Mm. You think that at first, and then she turns out to be right.",
        "Ridge: So, what does that mean -- they had an argument? What?",
        "Eric: Look, there wasn't time to explain any of that. Steffy was trying to save Ivy's life, and I think she probably did. You would be very proud of her.",
        "Ridge: I am proud of her. She called the paramedics, CPR, like you told me. No, it's -- it was quick thinking.",
        "Caroline: It is very curious, though -- Pam saying that Steffy and Ivy were having an argument, because... I wonder if it has anything to do with Wyatt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: This is what happens when you mess with people's lives.",
        "Thomas: Oh, come on. You can't put that on me.",
        "Wyatt: What?! You play with them and you use them for your own amusement. Your sister was just starting to trust Ivy again, and then you made her look like a liar and a cheat.",
        "Thomas: Steffy told you about that night, and you confronted Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and you know what she said? She said it was a mistake -- opening up to you and all of that. That was a mistake, 'cause she told you to stop, and you didn't. You didn't let up. And why -- so you could put another notch in your belt?",
        "Thomas: Oh, you are wrong. You're dead wrong. I care about Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: No. If you cared about Ivy, you would have listened. There wouldn't have been anything for Steffy to even tell me. And Ivy wouldn't be lying in there, hurt, lucky to be alive.",
        "Thomas: You're angry. And I'm the bad guy.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thomas: So this has to be my fault. But it's not.",
        "Wyatt: Is that what you wanted to tell Ivy in there -- that you weren't feeling bad about being shot down? That's why you told your sister your dirty little secret? 'Cause you knew how it was gonna come back to me and how it would affect everything. But this is all just a tragic, unforeseeable accident, right?",
        "Thomas: That is exactly what it is.",
        "Wyatt: Maybe you don't feel guilty -- just pouring on all that charm, doing whatever you like. But you know what? I don't care. And neither does Ivy. And this little game you're playing with her is over. And if you ever touch Ivy again... you will be sorry. I'll make sure of it.",
        "Ivy: [Moans softly] Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Hi. I'm here.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, I'm so sorry about Thomas.",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: So, you do doubt me.",
        "Liam: No. I'm -- I'm concerned about you.",
        "Steffy: About our future?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Look, I'm not trying to hold the past against you. I'm really not. But there is a pattern forming here, and it's getting harder and harder to ignore. I mean, first Aly and then Ivy, and --",
        "Steffy: I wish I could explain this. I wish I knew what was happening, but it doesn't make sense to me, either. It's not like I'm looking for trouble. We got that text from Jake. I was waiting around, I kept watch, and I didn't expect Ivy to show up.",
        "Liam: Steffy, I don't think you wanted this to happen.",
        "Steffy: It just all happened so fast.",
        "Liam: I know. I know. And -- and you did everything right, okay?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I did.",
        "Liam: You called the paramedics, right?",
        "Steffy: I did do everything right. I did CPR. I called the EMT. I did everything I could do.",
        "Liam: Of course you did. Of course you did.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Liam, I know you don't want to question my motives. I know you want to trust me. I know you want to believe in me because you are a good, honorable man. You don't like conflict. You don't have room for that in your life, and I don't -- I don't want to be the source of it. But we're different people, and we handle things differently. I didn't think that was a problem, but...",
        "Liam: It's not -- it's -- it's not a problem. It's -- well, it's something we need to address, yeah. [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: I see.",
        "Liam: Do you?",
        "Steffy: I mean... [Sighs] It's complicated. Maybe we need to simplify things. Maybe I should move out until we're married.",
        "Liam: Wait. What?!",
        "Steffy: That's the proper way of doing it.",
        "Liam: Hold on. You want to -- you want to move out?",
        "Steffy: I'll move back in once we're married, but you said you need this time to think. Maybe you need to figure out who you are, who I am, and how we fit.",
        "Liam: Hold -- hold on.",
        "Steffy: I don't know.",
        "Liam: Hold on a second.",
        "Steffy: No. I-I think this is what's best. I got to go.",
        "Liam: J-- Steffy... don't go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: So, you think Ivy was upset with Wyatt? Why?",
        "Caroline: There's been some talk around the office... that there was trouble in the relationship -- not that I listen to gossip, but there may have been another guy turning Ivy's head.",
        "Eric: Our Ivy? Are you kidding?",
        "Caroline: It's just what I heard. I was gonna ask her about it, but how do you bring that up?",
        "Eric: No, that doesn't sound like Ivy at all. Look, you know, the fact is I've been around Ivy and Wyatt enough to know that she's completely devoted to him.",
        "Thomas: Granddad's right.",
        "Eric: You're back!",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: How is she?",
        "Thomas: Stable. Being watched by her overprotective boyfriend.",
        "Caroline: Well, that answers that question.",
        "Thomas: What question?",
        "Caroline: Nothing.",
        "Eric: Just a rumor that Caroline heard.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, but, you know, this office, people say the craziest things. It's all nonsense. We can't really listen to any of it.",
        "Thomas: Well, if you hear anything about Ivy and Wyatt, don't believe it. Those two are on lock, although I don't understand what she sees in him. The guy's a joke. But, hey, she's committed to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: You had every right to be angry.",
        "Wyatt: No. Shh.",
        "Ivy: You did.",
        "Wyatt: Stop. Stop right now, okay? The doctors want you to relax. We'll talk about this at another time.",
        "Ivy: I'm so sorry.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: I am. I was so weak, and I was so wrong.",
        "Wyatt: No, you weren't. You were not.",
        "Ivy: I should have known Thomas was playing me.",
        "Wyatt: He made you question yourself. He manipulated you. Thomas turned you around and around until you lost your bearings, okay?",
        "Ivy: It wasn't just Thomas, Wyatt. I was really scared.",
        "Wyatt: Scared? You want to know about scared? Let me tell you about scared. Let me tell you about a phone call I got today about my girlfriend being in a hospital, of all places. Look... when you get out of here... I just... I want everything to go back to the -- to the way it was, you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Don't go.",
        "Steffy: You need time.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Yeah, time to think, not time alone.",
        "Steffy: It'll be easier this way.",
        "Liam: Oh, will you stop it? Yes, I'm -- I'm concerned and I'm confused because all this conflict rising up again is -- is throwing me.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. I-I feel the same way. It threw me, too. I can't get it out of my head.",
        "Liam: I know, but, like you said, you did everything right, right? You acted quickly. You jumped right in. And because of that, Ivy's gonna be okay, right? The doctor said she's gonna make a full recovery.",
        "Steffy: And I'm so thankful for that.",
        "Liam: I know you are. I never doubted that for a second, and... I'm sorry I'm not making it seem like it, but I believe you.",
        "Steffy: You do?",
        "Liam: Yes, of course I do. I always do. Sure, I -- yeah, I don't like chaos and conflict, whereas you seem to only act on impulse, and sometimes you don't think things through, but... you always do what you think is right. And you always tell me the truth... even when you know it's bad, even when you know I'll be disappointed.",
        "Steffy: Are you disappointed?",
        "Liam: Don't go.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles softly]",
        "Liam: We may not be married yet, but make no mistake -- this is our home.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: And if we're gonna have an issue, we're gonna do it here, together, as a couple. You know why? Because you and me -- we can do two things at once. We can argue and we can still support each other. I love you, I trust you... and I will always be in your corner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Caroline: She's gonna be all right? You got to see Ivy?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah, I did. They have to run a few more tests, but the doctors seemed cautiously optimistic.",
        "Ridge: All right. What about Steffy? Is she still there?",
        "Thomas: No. She went home. I said Ivy needed to rest, but, uh...Wyatt stuck around.",
        "Ridge: And you don't think he should have?",
        "Thomas: That's none of my business.",
        "Ridge: It sounds like you have an opinion on it.",
        "Thomas: You know my opinion of Wyatt.",
        "Caroline: Please tell me that you two didn't get into it at the hospital.",
        "Thomas: No. No. I wouldn't do that to Ivy.",
        "Ridge: Oh, good. So you can control yourself.",
        "Thomas: Bottom line is Ivy's gonna pull through, okay? And whatever happened between Wyatt and -- doesn't matter.",
        "Caroline: I thought you said they were solid.",
        "Thomas: They are.",
        "Caroline: Then you must have heard the same rumors that I have -- that there might have been another guy.",
        "Thomas: You're right. [Clears throat] It was me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I-I never should have walked out on you.",
        "Ivy: You had every reason to, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: But if I knew what would have happened, I wouldn't have done it.",
        "Ivy: You did the -- the right thing, okay? You gave me what I deserved.",
        "Wyatt: No. Okay. I don't want to talk about this right now. The doctor said to relax, so let's just relax, all right?",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, I'm just trying to tell you I'm sorry. I wanted to be the one to tell you. Steffy just -- she beat me to it. I didn't know what to say because I didn't want you to feel differently.",
        "Wyatt: But I do feel differently. Seeing you lying here... knowing what could have happened, how -- how I could have -- I could have lost you. Thinking back on our conversation... those could have been the last words that we ever said to each other, so, yeah, I do. I-I -- you bet I feel differently.",
        "Ivy: Hey. I'm just -- I'm trying to tell you that... I realize now how much I need you. I'm so grateful that you're here right now by my side.",
        "Wyatt: I love you.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I love you, too.",
        "Wyatt: Will you please just...relax now?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Mmm.",
        "Liam: Hey, um... I don't ever want you to think I'm judging you.",
        "Steffy: Mmm. Just my decisions.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Well, I'll try not to hold them against you.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Even when you want to rip out your hair?",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Even when you're totally wrong and it all ends in disaster.",
        "Steffy: Well, thank God it didn't this time... for Ivy or for any of us.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I think we leveled up today. Ba-ding!",
        "Steffy: You did not just compare us to a video game.",
        "Liam: What? Yeah. W-we...",
        "Steffy: No.",
        "Liam: ...Avoided another disaster. We survived.",
        "Steffy: Ivy survived. We got through it.",
        "Liam: Well, of course we did. And that's not true for every couple, you know? I mean...problems arise and everything falls apart, but with us, problems arise and... we...",
        "Steffy: End up here.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Knew you were gonna say that.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Liam: Because we know what we've got.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. And we're willing to fight for it.",
        "Liam: What was it you said? Uh...\"I will never take off this ring.\"",
        "Steffy: Okay. Stop. [Laughs]",
        "Liam: \"I will never take off this ring.\"",
        "Steffy: Well, I won't -- ever.",
        "Liam: Never?",
        "Steffy: Mnh-mnh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I can't tell you how grateful I am I didn't lose you today.",
