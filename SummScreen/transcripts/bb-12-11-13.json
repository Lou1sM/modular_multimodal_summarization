        "Liam is trying to call Hope when she shows up at his cliff house. He says he did not hear from her last night and wonders how it went with Wyatt. He says he knows it could not have been easy on her but he hopes she gets now that it had to be done. She says yeah although he had to go and get Neanderthal on her and laid down conditions. He starts to deny it and she says it is okay; it was a little bit of a turn-on. He starts rattling off the check list. They are going to get married at her mom's house sometime before Christmas. And she has told Wyatt that he and his mom no longer are associated with FC. Hope doesn't answer right away. Then she says she is not sure he understands the importance of Quinn's line to her recent success. Liam says he does but he also realizes that Wyatt and his creepy mom have used that association to mess with their relationship. Hope says she knows, but what if they promise to keep it strictly professional. Liam replies that he doesn't think that is possible, at least not for Wyatt. He reminds her that Hope said herself that things couldn't go on as they were. She agrees. He says and Wyatt had to know that he would put his foot down eventually. So Hope did not say but he hopes Wyatt is telling his mother this morning and they are out at FC. Hope says yes although Quinn is not going to be very happy. Liam says well she can deal. The point is she is through messing with their lives for good. Wyatt tells his mom that he had this big romantic evening planned and instead Hope told him that she was marrying Liam. She's shocked. Wyatt says Liam must have sensed he was going to make a move and got to Hope first and laid it on the line. It was his idea. He finally grew a backbone. He told her how it was going to be or else he was gonna end things for good. And he tells his mom there is more \u0096 they are out at Forrester. Liam doesn't want them anywhere near Hope or HFTF. It's over. She gives Wyatt a big hug. Eric finds Brooke hard at work. She says Hope is not the only one around here with a clothing line. Eric says Hope has made them all proud and it's not surprising that she has two fine young men fighting over her and making big moves. At least that is what Wyatt is doing according to Quinn. He likes Liam but he has to say that he's very impressed with Wyatt. He's a very special guy and he really admires his focus and determination. He and his mother have made a very big contribution to this company and he hopes they have an association with them for a very long time. And there is no reason that it won't. Wyatt is certainly happy working with Hope and he only sees that as a problem if Liam and Hope finally get married. Quinn tells Wyatt that he loves Hope. He can not accept this. He says Hope has agreed to marry Liam even though he knows how she feels about him. Quinn says Liam has let her down so many times and he will again unless Wyatt turns it around unless they both do. Liam tells Hope maybe they should take the day off and celebrate as they didn't get to do that last night. He bets Wyatt did everything he could to change her mind. She thinks back on Wyatt's kisses and him trying to change her mind in not marrying Liam. Liam says at least now whatever future Wyatt was planning he knows that is over. Now Liam has this one little thing he'd like her to wear. He pulls out the ring from his pocket. He says it is shiny. She says it is beautiful and he slips it on her finger. She sighs and he kisses her.",
        "Wyatt tells his mom that he told Hope that he didn't accept this. They've been so good together and accomplished so much. But it's even more than that. She loves him. Quinn says and yet she is marrying Liam. Wyatt sighs and says she apparently loves Liam more. Quinn says no, Hope is confused. Liam is forcing her to do something she does not want to do or he's making her feel guilty for falling for Wyatt. Wyatt replies that Hope did say that he made it easy for her. Quinn says of course as he is everything she could want in a man. He's smart, he's funny and he's handsome .and he is a man of his word. Wyatt is everything that Liam is not. He is weak and insecure, everything she despises in a man and so should Hope. Wyatt doesn't understand then why doesn't she? He thought she needed time; that she was giving herself permission to look in other directions. Quinn agrees because the only other direction she has looked in is Wyatt's from the first time their lips touched in Big Bear. They were meant to be. He knew it would lead to something for the both of them. He knows she is worried about the company. She reminds him that he is her son and will always be her first concern. Almost defeated he says he knows, but before Hope brought them to Forrester they were struggling. After the re-launch that all changed. No more worries about payroll and denying themselves things like that electric car. She scoffs that is not important. She can return that. He says no. Liam can not screw with them this way or their employees. They have worked too hard. He starts to leave and she asks where he is going. He says he is going to talk to Liam. He's going to tell him that he can't do this any more. Brooke finds Hope and wants to know how last night with Wyatt went. Hope says it is more like what happened before she went to see Wyatt. She and Liam are going to be married and she holds up her ring finger. Brooke claims she is happy for her, but just a little confused. Hope says there is so much she needs to tell her .the biggest right now is that Liam is insisting that Wyatt and Quinn have to leave FC. Quinn finds Eric and he invites her into his office and thanks her again for his cufflinks. Then says Hope must be pleased with her newest designs. Quinn hesitates and then says they have an issue a problem really. Liam and Hope are getting married right away. This all happened right before Hope was to meet Wyatt last night. Obviously this was not what her son was hoping for. But Liam had shown up at Hope's and told her how it was going to be; that he was done waiting and they were going to get married now. And he also made the condition that she and Wyatt could not work at FC. She tells Eric that he can only imagine how heartsick her son is. Not only is he losing the woman he loves but a chance to build on a successful business collaboration. Eric wants to know if Hope agreed to this. Quinn answers yes. Eric says he is glad she came to him. He will talk to Hope and maybe there is something he can do. She throws her arms around his neck and thanks him and says she knew she could count on him. Hope tells her mother that at first she couldn't believe Liam was asking this of her .actually he wasn't asking. But it's Quinn and Wyatt go or she is risking losing everything she has with Liam. Brooke says this sounds an awfully lot like an ultimatum. Hope says she is not completely comfortable with his request but she does know where he is coming from. But the timing could not have been worse considering the evening Wyatt had planned for her. Brooke asks her if she is sure about all of this. Hope says yes, it is what she had to do for Liam ..and for herself. She doesn't want to be tempted at work. There is an attraction to Wyatt .a strong one and this will be best for everyone. Wyatt barges into Liam's house and grabs him by the arm and says they've got to talk. Liam says he is leaving. Wyatt says five minutes. That is all he is asking. Liam tells him to let him go. And he is pretty sure whatever he says is not going to change anything so he can save his breath. Wyatt says he is sorry. Liam is taken aback. Wyatt tells Liam that he has repeatedly asked him to respect his relationship with Hope and he didn't. He rubbed it in his face every minute he could. He says they are brothers .Liam says half-brothers. Wyatt say he loved Hope, still does. Liam says right there is the problem. Wyatt says it was a problem but not any more. Hope has agreed to marry Liam. She will be Liam's for the rest of his life. Liam is disbelieving. Wyatt tells him that he's trying to be as honest as he can. God this hurts like hell knowing that Hope will never be his, but somehow he will have to accept it as what Hope wants. Liam is what she wants. And to lose her and his job ..Liam says aha, so that is what it is, his association with Forrester. Wyatt says no. He meant what he said. He is truly sorry for causing problems with him and Hope. But forcing him and his mother out just when things are coming together for him and they have built up their business and trying to keep it afloat. They have families and employees that are depending on them. He pleads with him, bro, not to do this. Liam has got the girl; just let them keep their partnership at FC. He will respect his marriage and stay away from Hope. He holds out his hand to shake. He tells Liam come on, he can trust him."

        "Hope: No, that actually was a little bit of a turn-on.",
        "Liam: Little bit?",
        "Hope: Little bit.",
        "Liam: Like -- like a little bit?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: So, uh, we're getting married before Christmas.",
        "Hope: [Laughs] Uh, check.",
        "Liam: At your mom's house.",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Liam: Um, you've -- you've cut ties with Quinn and Wyatt and their company. You -- no? No check? No? Hope? Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I planned this big, romantic evening, and instead, Hope tells me that she's marrying Liam.",
        "Quinn: What? No.",
        "Wyatt: Before the holidays. At Brooke's house. It was yoga boy's idea. He must have sensed that I was making a move and got to her first, and laid it on the line.",
        "Quinn: Wait. You don't mean he -- he told --",
        "Wyatt: Yep. He finally grew a backbone. He told her how it was gonna be or else --",
        "Quinn: He was gonna end things for good.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. But there's more. Um... you and I are out at Forrester.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Wyatt: Liam doesn't want us anywhere near Hope or Hope for the Future. It's over, Mom.",
        "Quinn: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: Hard at work, I see.",
        "Brooke: Hope's not the only one around here with a clothing line.",
        "Eric: Uh-huh. Uh...Brooke's bedroom getting some well-deserved attention, I see.",
        "Brooke: I realize that Hope for the Future is front and center, as it should be, but eventually we're gonna have to start shifting focus in a different direction.",
        "Eric: And you want to be ready.",
        "Brooke: Yes. But I certainly don't mind basking in my daughter's amazing success.",
        "Eric: She's made us all proud, hasn't she? It's not at all surprising she has these two extraordinary young men fighting over her, making big moves. At least, that's what Wyatt's doing, according to Quinn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I'm not sure you fully understand the importance of Quinn Artisan Jewelers to Hope for the Future's recent success.",
        "Liam: I do. But I also understand that Wyatt and his creepy mom have used that association to mess with our relationship.",
        "Hope: I know, but what if they promise to keep it strictly professional?",
        "Liam: I don't think that's possible. I mean, I know it's not for Wyatt. You said yourself that things couldn't have gone on the way that they were.",
        "Hope: I know. I know. I know I did. Yeah.",
        "Liam: By the way, you know, Wyatt had to realize that I was gonna be putting my foot down at some point. So you, uh... you never said, um... is Wyatt delivering the news to his mom today? I mean, are -- are they no longer associated with Forrester?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: Although I will tell you Quinn is not going to be very happy.",
        "Liam: Well, she can deal. Or not. The point is she's done interfering in our lives for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Honey, listen to me. You cannot accept this. You love Hope.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, she's agreed to marry Liam again. And even though I know how she feels about me -- you know, that's what I don't get.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Did you ask her?",
        "Wyatt: How she's opened herself up for potential heartbreak again? Yes, I did.",
        "Quinn: Liam has let her down so many times. He will do it again. Unless you turn it around. Unless... we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: How is Wyatt making big moves over Hope?",
        "Eric: Well, that's not exactly the way Quinn put it, although she did say that, uh -- she just said that she thought it would be a very big night for the two of them.",
        "Brooke: In what way?",
        "Eric: I'm sure Quinn will explain it to you when she sees you. You know, I'm very impressed with Liam, but I have to tell you, Wyatt is a very special guy. I admire his, uh, his focus and his determination. He and his mother made a big, big contribution to this company. I hope it goes on for a very long time.",
        "Brooke: There's no reason it won't, right?",
        "Eric: No. None that I can see. They're both very happy with the collaboration. Wyatt's definitely happy with his collaboration with Hope. Although I can see it being a problem if Hope and Liam finally get married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Maybe we should, um, take the day off today, you know, celebrate. We never got to do that last night.",
        "Hope: I'm so sorry. I should have called you after I talked to Wyatt. I bet he did everything he could to change your mind, huh.",
        "[Hope remembering]",
        "Wyatt: I just want to plan a trip with you and -- and...",
        "Hope: And what?",
        "Wyatt: And maybe something we haven't done before. Something that might even change your mind about everything.",
        "[Back to present]",
        "Liam: But I know. I know that you made it clear that it's over.",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] The question is, will he let it be over? Will his mother? I mean, especially if...",
        "Hope: Especially if what?",
        "Liam: I -- no, I'm not -- [Laughs] I'm not gonna go there. Whatever future Wyatt thought he had with you, at least he knows that's not happening. In a few days, you and I will say our \"I do\"s, and we will live happily ever after at long last. Hey, um, I have this thing that I was hoping you would wear for me.",
        "Hope: Oh, yeah?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: What is --?",
        "Liam: Shiny. It's shiny.",
        "Hope: It's beautiful.",
        "Liam: May I?",
        "Hope: Yes. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Looks good on you.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I told Hope that I didn't accept this.",
        "Quinn: You shouldn't accept it.",
        "Wyatt: We'd been so good together. We've accomplished so much. But it's more than that. She loves me.",
        "Quinn: And she's still marrying Liam?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] She loves him more, apparently.",
        "Quinn: No, she's confused. He's forcing her to do something she doesn't want to do.",
        "Wyatt: No, Hope can't be forced into anything.",
        "Quinn: Okay, well, then he's making her feel guilty for falling for you.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I mean, she said that I did make it easy for her.",
        "Quinn: Of course you made it easy for her. You're everything that she could ever want in a man. You are smart. You're funny. And you're handsome. And you're a man of your word. You're everything that Liam is not. He's -- he is weak, and he's insecure. [Sighs] He's everything that I despise in a man. And Hope should, too.",
        "Wyatt: So why doesn't she? You know, w-- when Hope said that she needed time, I thought she was finally giving herself permission to look in other directions.",
        "Quinn: Right. Because the only other direction that she's looking in is yours, from that very first kiss in Big Bear. You and Hope were meant to be. Oh -- oh, come on. Tell me that I'm wrong. Tell me that you didn't know that from the second your lips touched hers and she -- she opened her eyes and looked at you that this was gonna lead to something more. For both of us.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] You're worried about what's gonna happen to our company.",
        "Quinn: You're my son. You will always be my first concern.",
        "Wyatt: I know, but I mean... before Hope brought us to Forrester, our company was struggling. And then after the relaunch, that all changed. You know, no more worrying about where the next payroll's coming from or denying ourselves things and that electric car that you bought yourself.",
        "Quinn: Oh, Baby, no, no, no. I-I could return it.",
        "Wyatt: No. Liam can't screw with our business this way. We have worked too hard. Our -- our employees have worked too hard.",
        "Quinn: Honey, wait. Where are you going?",
        "Wyatt: I'm gonna talk to Liam. I'm gonna tell him that he can't do this anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Pam said she thought you were in here.",
        "Hope: Hey, Mom. What's up?",
        "Brooke: I didn't see you last night when you got in. I was sleeping.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Is there something you wanted to talk about?",
        "Brooke: Your evening with Wyatt. How did it go?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Um... how'd you know about that?",
        "Brooke: What happened?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Well, it's -- it's more what happened before I went over there. Um... Liam and I are getting married. [Laughs]",
        "Brooke: You are?",
        "Hope: Yeah. At, uh, your house before Christmas, if that's okay with you.",
        "Brooke: Oh, uh, yeah! Of course!",
        "Hope: Yeah? Okay. Good.",
        "Brooke: Wow.",
        "Hope: Uh, so you're -- you're happy for us, yeah?",
        "Brooke: Yes. Yes, absolutely. I'm just -- I'm a little confused.",
        "Hope: I know. [Laughs]",
        "Brooke: Your evening with Wyatt...",
        "Hope: It didn't, um, didn't really turn out the way he had hoped.",
        "Brooke: Oh. You broke the news about you and Liam?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Mom, there -- there's so much that I have to tell you. Uh, not only, um... does Liam want to get married before Christmas, but he also insisted that Quinn and Wyatt leave Forrester Creations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You're sure I'm not interrupting.",
        "Eric: I'm absolutely sure. In fact, I was just looking at your new pieces here in this collection. It's stunning. I think it's some of your best work ever. Excluding these, of course. Uh, thank you again.",
        "Quinn: Well, I was inspired.",
        "Eric: Come in.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Eric: Uh, so what was Hope's reaction? I mean, she must love these. These are very special pieces for her spring line. She must be very happy. Or not.",
        "Quinn: We have an issue. A problem. Hope and Liam are getting married right away. Obviously it's not what my son was hoping for.",
        "Eric: [Sighs] Or his mother?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: When did this happen? Last night?",
        "Quinn: Um, right before Hope was supposed to meet Wyatt. Uh, apparently Liam showed up at Hope's house and essentially told her how it was going to be, that he was done waiting, that they were going to get married now.",
        "Eric: Mm-hmm. He also, um, made the condition that Wyatt and I can no longer work at Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: We got to talk.",
        "Liam: I'm leaving.",
        "Wyatt: So that's it? You're not even gonna hear me out?",
        "Liam: Let go.",
        "Wyatt: Five minutes. That's all I'm asking.",
        "Liam: You really want to do this right now?",
        "Wyatt: It's not what you're thinking, okay?",
        "Liam: I'm pretty sure it is, Wyatt, and you can save your breath, 'cause it's not gonna change anything.",
        "Wyatt: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You can imagine how heartsick my son is. I mean, not only is he losing the woman that he adores, but he's losing the chance to build on a really successful business collaboration. Naturally, Liam has issues with Wyatt and with me, as well, unfortunately. But... Hope... I really feel for her.",
        "Eric: She agreed to go along with Liam's demand?",
        "Quinn: Terminate all ties between our two companies? Yes.",
        "Eric: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: Look, I -- I understand that this is Hope's line and she has the right to make any changes. You know, Eric, I'm sorry. [Chuckles] Maybe I shouldn't have come to you.",
        "Eric: No, no, no. I'm glad you did. I'll speak to Hope. Maybe there's something I can do.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Eric. Thank you. Oh, I knew I could count on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: At first, I couldn't believe what Liam was asking because he wasn't really asking. Either Quinn and Wyatt go or I risk losing everything that I have with Liam.",
        "Brooke: That sounds an awful lot like an ultimatum.",
        "Hope: I'm still not completely comfortable with his request, but I-I understand where he's coming from.",
        "Brooke: How did Wyatt react when you told him?",
        "Hope: Mom... my timing could not have been worse. He had planned this whole romantic evening for us.",
        "Brooke: And that made it more difficult on you, of course.",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Oh, Sweetie, are you absolutely sure about this?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah. I-it's what I have to do for Liam. And -- and for myself. I don't want to be tempted at work.",
        "Brooke: By Wyatt?",
        "Hope: There's an attraction. A strong one. And this really is the best thing for everyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You're sorry?",
        "Wyatt: Look, you've repeatedly asked me to respect your relationship with Hope, and I didn't.",
        "Liam: Yeah, not only did you not respect it --",
        "Wyatt: I rubbed your face in it every minute I got. Yes. But even though we're brothers --",
        "Liam: We're half-brothers, Wyatt, and you loved it.",
        "Wyatt: I loved Hope, and I still do.",
        "Liam: Okay, see that right there. That's your problem.",
        "Wyatt: No, it was a problem, but it's not anymore. God, I... Hope has agreed to marry you. So she will be yours for the rest of your life.",
        "Liam: Oh, and now you're fine with that. What do you take me for, Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: I am trying to tell you how it is now as sincerely as I know how. God... you don't think it hurts like hell knowing that Hope will never be mine? But somehow I have to accept it because that's what she wants. You are who she wants. And to lose her and my job -- that is just not --",
        "Liam: Oh! Oh! Now it makes sense! Now we're getting to why you're here. 'Cause it's all about the relationship with Forrester.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no. That is not what this is all about. I meant what I said. I am truly sorry for causing problems with you and Hope. But forcing my mother and me out of Forrester when everything is finally coming together for us -- we have spent years building that company and fighting to keep it afloat. We have employees and families that count on us. Please, man... Bro, don't do this to me. You've got the girl. Just let us keep our partnership with Forrester. I will respect your marriage, okay. I-I will stay away from Hope. I will. Come on. You can trust me."
