        "Next morning Wyatt brings Hope tea in the sunny room hoping that will make her feel better. He walks on eggshells trying not to remind her what happened, but just grateful that she is all right. He says they are both emotional and they don't have to talk about it right now. But they can have other children. They will have other children. And he did get that restraining order against his mother so she won't be part of their life. She says his mother did not throw her down the stairs but if Wyatt had kept her away she would not have been there in the first place. He gets it; she is now blaming him for what happened. Liam walks into Quinn's who has spent a bad night and looks like death warmed over. He tells Quinn he doubts anyone has kept her aware but Hope lost the baby. She is remorseful while saying she did not push Hope. Liam reminds her that all her doings, stalking Hope, sending the selfie to Ridge, pushing Ivy into the Seine were all on her to manipulate things. It is surely time that she got professional help, like therapy, medication, whatever. She tells him to go to hell. Hope and Wyatt argue. She says he promised her over and over that he would keep his mother away and yet the restraining order only came yesterday while she was already in the hospital. She seems to be talking in the past tense and he senses she may be ready to leave him. She says she does not know what she is going to do. He has to know the only reason they are married now is because of his mother who orchestrated it all. Wyatt opines that Hope always wants something she does not have. She gets dressed and Wyatt reminds her she is supposed to be taking it easy. She says she is trying to avoid having a conversation that neither of them want to have. Wyatt says he lost a baby too. He loves her. She says this would not be so hard if she did not love him too. No choice, he lets her walk out.",
        "Aly and Ivy talk about Hope's first day home and hope she is better after a good night's sleep. And that being with Wyatt is just where she wants to call home. Wyatt goes to Quinn's who is hiding in the back. He tells her to open the door if she ever wants to see him again. He asks if there is anything she wants to say to him. She says she would never do anything to hurt Hope or the baby. She was trying to walk away and she is so sorry. He says Hope is physically okay. She wonders why he is here. She says he lights up the room anyplace he goes. His wife would want him to be home right now. He says no, not so much. Hope shows up at Brooke's and from the balcony re-lives the moment that she fell. She looks around and there is Liam. They look at each other longingly and embrace."

        "Wyatt: Hey. Thought you might need help getting dressed, but I guess not. Uh, yeah. Pam had those sent over after the shower. Um... was thinking of donating them. I mean, if -- if you're okay with that.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. Uh, don't -- don't you have to be at work?",
        "Wyatt: Nope. No, not today. You hungry? You want me to make you something? Pancakes, eggs --",
        "Hope: No, I'm not hungry.",
        "Wyatt: Thought you might feel better...resting out here, where it's sunny.",
        "Hope: You know, I'm not actually sick.",
        "Wyatt: I know. The doctor did tell you to take it easy for a day or two.",
        "Hope: Uh...my -- my body is just sore. That's really it. [Breathes deeply] What?",
        "Wyatt: I'm just...grateful. If anything happened to you, I...",
        "Hope: Well, something did happen to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Quinn: He keeps forgetting to lock up.",
        "Liam: So you've seen him, then -- Deacon?",
        "Quinn: Apparently, he slept here. I was in my room.",
        "Liam: It, uh...occurred to me that nobody has seen you or heard from you since yesterday. Don't you want to know if Hope was okay?",
        "Quinn: Is she?",
        "Liam: She will be. But not the baby. That's over.",
        "Quinn: That baby was my family... my flesh and blood. Everybody likes to forget that.",
        "Liam: What they're not gonna forget is that you're the reason that baby won't be born.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Aly: Hey.",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Aly: So, Hope is home.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Aly: Hopefully, she'll feel better after a good night's sleep. I didn't want to call over there too early.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I just -- I just wonder...",
        "Aly: What?",
        "Ivy: Well, I just wonder if Hope still thinks of Wyatt as home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I didn't push her.",
        "Liam: I know, Quinn. Everybody knows. Hope made it very clear. But here's the thing -- you can say, \"I didn't push her.\" You can say, \"I didn't chuck Ridge out of the helicopter. I barely nudged Ivy off that bridge.\" But it doesn't let you off the hook for the role you played in the sequence of events and how they turned out, and even you have to recognize that now.",
        "Quinn: Go to Hell.",
        "Liam: I don't believe in Hell.",
        "Quinn: Wait a few years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: We can always have other children. We will have other children, Hope. I mean, but if you don't want to talk about it right now, I understand. We're both still emotional.",
        "Hope: Well, you know, maybe it's better this way. Maybe this way we won't talk ourselves into accepting the unacceptable like we usually do.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, I know we didn't discuss it last night. I didn't really see a reason to, but...I got that restraining order against my mother. My dad helped. So she can't come near you or the house.",
        "Hope: You know what? Never mind. You were right. Let's not talk about it right now, especially since the... worst thing that could've happened already happened.",
        "Wyatt: Yesterday, you said that you didn't blame her.",
        "Hope: No, she didn't throw me down the stairs, but... if you had kept her away from me, then I wouldn't have been near them in the first place.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. I see. So -- so you're blaming me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aly: So, what does Liam say?",
        "Ivy: I haven't really talked to him.",
        "Aly: Well, he was at the hospital.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, to bring Hope in.",
        "Aly: I feel kind of awful, having certain thoughts. But it's kind of hard not to think about what it all means. I mean, if Hope only stayed married because of the baby...",
        "Ivy: Is there something -- is there something you could do if you turned up pregnant by a man you intended to leave?",
        "Aly: That wouldn't happen.",
        "Ivy: If it did, is it something that you could do for appearances' sake? No. See? Neither could I. So the only thing that makes sense to me is that the reason Hope is married is because she wants to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You're circling like a vulture. You think Hope won't notice?",
        "Liam: Is anybody here? Is Deacon here? Wyatt? My father? Did anybody else think of you today and give a damn?",
        "Quinn: So I should be grateful that you showed up here to rub it in my face?",
        "Liam: You know, believe it or not, I do care about my brother, and I don't think he's in the position to be dealing with you right now. And you -- you have got to admit that you need some kind of professional help. Therapy, medication. I don't know. I don't know. But I know you didn't want to end a life like that.",
        "Quinn: And I didn't.",
        "Liam: And I know you didn't want to end your son's marriage, either.",
        "Quinn: She walked out on him?",
        "Liam: No. No, sh-- no. But it's only a matter of time, and when it happens, it won't be my doing. It'll be yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You should've protected me.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Hope: You should've protected me, Wyatt. I asked you over and over, and I begged you, and I demanded that you keep that woman away from our door, that you keep her away from our family! And what do I get? I get a restraining order yesterday that nobody ever saw!",
        "Wyatt: You notice that she's not here right now, right? She's saw it. I served it to her myself.",
        "Hope: And where was I? In the hospital?",
        "Wyatt: Hope, please tell me that you're not leaving me right now.",
        "Hope: I-I don't know what I'm doing.",
        "Wyatt: I do. We'll recover from this. We'll keep the promises that we made to each other.",
        "Hope: How can you talk about promises when you promised me that you would keep her away from us?!",
        "Wyatt: That is not fair! That is not fair. What was I supposed to do, huh? Chain her to her workbench? I thought that I had it handled. But you know her -- she says one thing, and she does another.",
        "Hope: I do know her, and it is astonishing to me that you turned out as well as you did. You are strong and accomplished and loved and successful and respected and...",
        "Wyatt: By you? Or are you talking in the past tense now?",
        "Hope: Wyatt, be honest. Aren't you tired of these sudden moments where... you don't know if I'm being sincere? When you don't know what I think or what I feel about you?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Hope: Well, it's just gonna keep happening. It's just gonna keep happening again and again, because we both know that the only reason we're married is because your mother engineered it.",
        "Wyatt: No, Hope. The reason why we're together is the same reason why you're thinking about leaving me right now. You always want what you don't have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: You don't know anything. Hope and Wyatt are probably bonding over this terrible loss. Their marriage is gonna be stronger than ever.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] I know you think I am sappy and sentimental, but, Quinn... I must be more realistic than you if you think that Hope and Wyatt are just gonna carry on their merry way after this.",
        "Quinn: You don't want to admit it, but she loves him.",
        "Liam: She does love him. But it's already cost her too much. She would do anything -- she would do whatever it takes to keep you out of her life.",
        "Quinn: I've been thinking about moving away.",
        "Liam: Listen, listen. It doesn't matter if you're on another planet. The minute Hope found out what you did in Paris, that baby -- that was the only thing keeping her from walking out on your son.",
        "Quinn: And thanks to me, that's gone now. Is that what you came here to say? Just get out.",
        "Liam: I am not the one depriving Wyatt of what he wants most in this life.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: What are you doing?",
        "Hope: Um... g-going out.",
        "Wyatt: You're supposed to be taking it easy.",
        "Hope: Is that what you call this?",
        "Wyatt: Hope, you are in no condition to be going out --",
        "Hope: I am not the one who died!",
        "Wyatt: It was my baby, too! Look, I know you're trying to avoid this conversation right now, and I get that --",
        "Hope: I'm... I am trying to withdraw from a conversation that neither of us is ready to have.",
        "Wyatt: Nobody made you marry me. Liam was late in Paris, and that was all the excuse that you needed. And now you're just -- you're looking for an excuse to turn around and undo it all? So was it -- was it our marriage that was engineered by mom? Did she engineer that baby, too? Okay, I'm not saying that she's not a problem, which is why I got that restraining order, but what do you want from me?! Hope, I love you.",
        "Hope: And this wouldn't be so difficult if I didn't love you, too.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: I expected you to be hiding.",
        "[Knocking continues]",
        "Wyatt: Open the door if you want to see me again. I, uh...assume that since you're hiding that I don't need to tell you anything. Is there nothing you want to say to me?",
        "Quinn: I was leaving. I was -- I was walking away from Hope. I would... I would never do anything to hurt her or your baby. I am so sorry. I know I shouldn't have been there.",
        "Wyatt: Why did you even have me, hmm? Why did you want to raise a kid all by yourself?",
        "Quinn: I didn't. I'm much too selfish for that.",
        "Wyatt: You thought that you'd just -- you'd have someone who will love you, just someone who has to love you? Is that it?",
        "Quinn: I had no idea that you were gonna end up being the love of my life.",
        "Wyatt: Don't you understand how unhealthy that sounds?",
        "Quinn: Is Hope okay?",
        "Wyatt: Physically, yeah.",
        "Quinn: Then why are you here?",
        "Wyatt: You know, sometimes I think about the way I grew up, the way we are... and how it makes us unfit to be around any company but each others.",
        "Quinn: No, that's not true. That's not true, because people adore you. You light up every room you walk into.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and I know you think that's a reasonable basis for self-esteem, but strangely enough, other people just find it obnoxious.",
        "Quinn: Your wife needs you right now, more than ever. You should be home.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I don't think I'm wanted at home right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Hope's Flashback)",
        "Quinn: Hope!",
        "Liam: Oh, my God! You pushed her!",
        "Quinn: It's not what you think!",
        "Liam: Oh, God! Get out of the way!"
