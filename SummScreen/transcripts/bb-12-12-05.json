        "Sally: Oh, nothing, it's my feet. You know, my dogs were barking. So Bucky here is giving me the royal treatment today. Come on, Clarke, would you speed it up please, I --",
        "Darla: No, no, no. You guys aren't going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.",
        "Clarke: Well -- well, come on, Sally. You know you couldn't keep it a secret forever.",
        "Sally: All right, so I had a little accident. Nothing serious. I was just getting out of the shower, and the floor was wet, and so I tripped and fell and I hurt my leg.",
        "Darla: Oh, honey, are you in any pain?",
        "Sally: No. Nothing a Mai tai can't fix. Come on, Clarke. Come on, let's get a move on. We can come back later for my suitcase, let's go, now.",

        "Stephanie: I realize that this is a shock. But the simple truth is, Felicia has returned from France, with your child.",
        "Nick: That's my son. Yes, you are. I don't even know his name.",
        "Felicia: It's Dominick.",
        "Bridget: Well, make sure you give Lauren a big hug for me. Okay, dad. Be careful. I love you, too. Sorry about that.",
        "Nick: Your dad okay?",
        "Bridget: Oh, yeah. He's having a great time at Lauren's wedding.",
        "Nick: Well, good for him.",
        "Bridget: I probably should've called him later, so he could enjoy the whole thing, but he just hadn't talked to me since he arrived in Genoa City. I bet you're going to be the same way with our daughter. Calling her, like, everyday when she leaves for college. Oh, you're going to be such a good dad. I can't wait.",
        "[ Chuckles ]Bridget: Oh, I'm sorry. Here I am going on and on again. There's something you wanted to tell me, so please, come on, sit down. Tell me what it is.",

        "Darla: Why did you lie to us? Keep your accident a secret?",
        "Sally: Come on, honey. There's been enough bad news coming out of this office.",
        "Thorne: Sally, we're family.",
        "Clarke: She didn't want you to worry.",
        "Sally: Yeah, come on. Everything's been coming up roses for you two. I didn't want to bring you down. We had a good run in this old shed, haven't we? We did. We were the smartest, toughest, sneakiest pirates in the business.",
        "Darla: There's nobody tougher or sneakier than you.",
        "Sally: Oh, honey. Listen, when I started out in this business, a woman sat in front of a sewing machine, not behind the head honcho's desk. And they said I needed a man to run the company. But I knew better. And I turned this no- account rag shop into a contender. And now -- now I'm just going to put all of that gumption into having a good time for the rest of my life, you know? So please, if you'll excuse me, my ship is about to sail. Come on, Bucky.",

        "Caretaker #1: Excuse me, Miss Spectra?",
        "Sally: Gentlemen, gentlemen -- what's this? I told your captain that I would meet you downstairs.",
        "Caretaker #2: We're from Happy Acres. The van's waiting to take you to your new home.",
        "Darla: But there's got to be some kind of mistake. Happy Acres -- that's a retirement home.",
        "Thorne: This woman is not going to a retirement home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Do you mind if we take this talk to the couch?",
        "Bridget: No. But you said this s isn't bad news, right?",
        "Nick: You know, Bridget, nobody knows better than me what you've been going through lately. I mean, the issue with your mother, and the scare with the baby --",
        "Bridget: Oh, the baby! Oh, my gosh, I can't believe I forgot to tell you. I saw Dr. Caspary -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but -- I saw Dr. Caspary today.",
        "Nick: Today? You had an appointment with the doctor and you didn't tell me?",
        "Bridget: No, no, no. I just ran into her at the hospital, but she was really excited --",
        "Nick: Bridget, what are you doing at the hospital on your feet all day? That can't be good for you and the baby, and you're around sick people all the time.",
        "Bridget: No, it's great for me to be occupied, believe me.",
        "Nick: You don't think it's too stressful?",
        "Bridget: No, no. I mean I'm under some high-pressure situations, but it -- I'm trained to handle them. Dr. Caspary says it's the emotional stress that I need to watch out for.",
        "Nick: I see.",
        "Bridget: You know, the situations that I'm not trained for, like, life in general. Mine, in particular. But I'm not worried about that anymore. I know that's all going to change. I think I've had enough excitement and enough people for like -- oh, I don't know. In fact, I just -- I really hope that this year is one of the most boring years of my life. Except for the baby, of course.",
        "Nick: Except for the baby.",
        "Bridget: I know boring's not really your style, though.",
        "Nick: No, it doesn't look like it's in the cards for me.",
        "Bridget: Can we then, just, you know, try -- for tonight -- to have a relaxing, boring evening? Can we do that?",
        "Nick: There's something that I want to talk to you about.",
        "Bridget: Oh, honey, can it wait? Is there anything we can do about it tonight?",
        "Nick: No.",
        "Bridget: Then why spoil this perfectly good evening? Can't we just enjoy this moment? For the first time in a really long time, I just feel perfectly content. I don't want to analyze it. I don't want to complicate it. I just want to sit here and enjoy you.",
        "Nick: Okay. We will talk about it in the morning.",
        "Bridget: Good.",
        "Felicia: It's really no big deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: What are you talking about? You collapsed.",
        "Dr. Nomura: Were you arguing? Experiencing any stress?",
        "Felicia: No.",
        "Stephanie: No, we were getting along.",
        "Felicia: It's such a rare occurrence, maybe I went into shock.",
        "Dr. Nomura: Any unexpected loss of consciousness is always cause for concern, Felicia.",
        "Felicia: I already told you, I'm exhausted. I just flew in from Europe with my baby.",
        "Dr. Nomura: Mm-hmm. And the medication you've been taking?",
        "Felicia: I've had some pain. He's a heavy child.",
        "Dr. Nomura: Pregnancy took it's toll on you.",
        "Felicia: I know what you're thinking. Don't.",
        "Stephanie: What are the chances that the cancer could have reoccurred?",
        "Felicia: It hasn't. It won't.",
        "Dr. Nomura: At this point, it's too early to speculate. I'll call in a lab, we'll run some tests.",
        "Felicia: I just want get back to my son.",
        "Dr. Nomura: I'll run the tests as quickly as possible. But I do have to insist on them.",
        "Stephanie: That's fine. That's the only way we're going to know what we're really dealing with.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you, doctor.",

        "Nick: It's been a while.",

        "Nick: Believe me, I know.",
        "Bridget: I didn't tell you something. Something else that Dr. Caspary told me today.",
        "Nick: Good news?",
        "Bridget: Very. She said she's been going over my exam and the ultrasound, and that the problem wasn't as bad as she first thought.",
        "Nick: Well that's great news.",
        "Bridget: I know. It gets even better. She said that -- it's okay for us to go ahead and have sex now.",
        "Nick: Really?",
        "Bridget: Really. I want you to make love to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Felicia, I know you don't want to believe that anything's wrong.",
        "Felicia: I'm okay, Mother. The cancer was in remission when I found out that I was pregnant. You can't take medicine when you're carrying a child. Pain meds are too risky. And the chemo could've killed him.",
        "Stephanie: So the French doctors didn't want you to go back on the chemo? Felicia?",
        "Felicia: I have to raise my little boy. Can't walk around sick all the time, and that's exactly how the chemo makes me feel.",
        "Stephanie: Your doctors did tell you they wanted you to take it again.",
        "Felicia: They were concerned that the stress of the pregnancy would weaken my immune system.",
        "Stephanie: You didn't listen to them.",
        "Felicia: Pregnancy didn't weaken me, Mother. It made me stronger. Being a mother to my child is more powerful than any medicine. Dominick gave me a reason to live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darla: You're not going on a cruise.",
        "Sally: Oh, come on. Nursing home, cruise -- practically the same thing. Organized activities, meeting new people, great big dining room.",
        "Clarke: Right, right. Happy Acres is one of the best assisted living facilities in the state.",
        "Thorne: Sally, I can understand why you can't stay at your condo while you're recovering, because of the stairs and all, but you don't have to move --",
        "Sally: Yes, Thorne, yes. I do!",
        "Thorne: You can hire a nurse.",
        "Sally: I can't afford a nurse.",
        "Thorne: What about all the money I paid you?",
        "Sally: It went straight to our creditors.",
        "Thorne: Well then, I'll hire you a nurse, Sally.",
        "Sally: Live-in? Round the clock? Because that's what I need. Now there, I've said it, okay? I can't take care of myself.",
        "Caretaker #1: Miss Spectra, I want you to know you'll get excellent care at Happy Acres.",
        "Darla: Oh my god, I can't even believe this is happening.",
        "Caretaker #2: You have nothing to worry about, ma'am. Your mother will be very happy with us.",
        "Darla: She's not my --",
        "[ Darla sighs ]",
        "Sally: Okay, okay. Now, let's not start blubbering around here.",
        "Darla: I can't help it. This is wrong. This is all wrong. This is all wrong. I'm not going to let you go anywhere. You're not going to that home. You're coming home with us. You said it yourself, Thorne. Sally is family.",
        "Thorne: You sure? This is a big job to take on.",
        "Darla: I'm sure it was a huge job to take on when she found me in foster care. But that didn't stop her from bringing me in to the Spectra family.",
        "Sally: Darla, please, you -- you don't owe me anything.",
        "Darla: Owe you? Owe you? I need you. Alexandria needs you. I want her to grow up with you in her life. I want you there everyday to help me to give her the confidence and the determination that you gave to me. Because you taught me so well. You know that I will do anything in my power to make that happen.",
        "Sally: Well, honey. When you put it like that, how can I say no?",
        "Darla: Sally.",

        "[ Waves roaring ]",
        "Bridget: Did you hear that?",
        "Nick: What?",
        "Bridget: The sound of the waves.",
        "Nick: Yeah. I guess we better enjoy it while we can.",
        "Bridget: Yeah, any child of yours is going to be pretty amusing.",
        "Nick: I beg your pardon, but I pride myself as a man of few words.",
        "Bridget: You may not say much, but you definitely can make a ruckus.",
        "Nick: Ruckus?",
        "Bridget: Yeah, a ruckus. You know, banging your tools around, or slamming some piece of greasy equipment on the table. Singing at the top of your lungs in the shower. I may have a little angel here, but she could be quite the terror.",
        "Nick: Well, I guess that's the way it is with kids, right? You think you're prepared, but maybe you're never really prepared for everything.",
        "Bridget: It's like that in every part of life.",
        "Nick: Look at us. Look where we were a few months ago.",
        "Bridget: But we're in a much better place now.",
        "Nick: You gotta remember that, Bridget. When things get crazy -- when things get thrown at us, we've got to come through them stronger. You know that, right?",
        "Bridget: Getting pretty philosophical for a man of few words.",
        "Nick: I just don't want anything to come between us, that's all.",
        "Bridget: Mr. Marone, are you asking me for a little reassurance?",
        "Nick: I don't want to lose you.",
        "Bridget: Honey, you won't. You won't. I love you, and I know that you love me. And there is nothing that we can't handle, as long as we're together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Look, you're home now. And I can take care of the baby while you start taking care of yourself.",
        "Felicia: You think I'm going to get sick again.",
        "Stephanie: Well, there's a reason you collapsed.",
        "Felicia: It's not cancer.",
        "Stephanie: I hope you're right.",
        "Felicia: I am.",
        "Stephanie: Let's just wait 'till the test results come back.",
        "Felicia: I don't care what they say. I'm going to be here to see my son grow up. I didn't have that beautiful boy go through the miracle of childbirth just to leave him behind.",
        "Stephanie: Of course not.",
        "Felicia: You know, Mother, when they tell you that you have cancer, you think it's a death sentence, but it's not.",
        "Stephanie: No, I know it doesn't have to be.",
        "Felicia: You know, I met these survivors -- when I was in the hospital getting treatment. It was this extraordinary group of people who went on to do amazing things. Some of them, they said they felt healthier now than before they ever got sick. I know that's the way it's going to be for me, too.",
        "Stephanie: I'm not saying it's not, it's just -- sweetheart, you know, whatever you need to do to stay well --",
        "Felicia: I'll do it.",
        "Stephanie: I just -- I want you to prepare yourself. You know, if the doctor comes back down and he says that you're going to have to do something in order to keep fighting.",
        "Felicia: I can beat it. I beat it once, I'll beat it again.",
        "Stephanie: I know you will. I know you can. I mean, who knows better than I, how stubborn you are?",
