        "Nick: I understand the fabric is not there. The manufacturer told me it would be to me by the end of the week. No, no, no, don't tell me that, because I know everything there is to know about shipping. Just make sure it gets to me by the end of the week. Otherwise, we're finished doing business together. Is it wrong to be frustrated by doing business with imbeciles?!",
        "Jackie: You and brooke should be running this company together. I know, I know. That ship has sailed.",
        "Nick: Just make sure that you don't leave, because I can't run it without you.",
        "Jackie: I don't know how much influence I've actually got here. I mean, look at this. I asked the sewing room to do a plunging neckline, and this is practically --",
        "Nick: We got more resignations on my desk this morning. We're like rats on a sinking ship.",
        "Jackie: Well, I don't know how we're gonna set the fashion industry ablaze if word gets out that our own employees hate us.",
        "Nick: Well, it better turn around fast. Because failure is not an option.",
        "Taylor: I'm actually going to be your wife.",
        "Thorne: Yeah. My wife? Do you have any idea how good that sounds? And my family. Everyone's so happy for us. How often does that happen? My father's gonna be so excited designing your wedding veil. Of course, the only thing missing would be the forrester creations label.",
        "Taylor: Yes, I've been thinking about my wedding gift for you.",
        "Thorne: How about more of what you just gave me?",
        "Taylor: You don't have to worry about that. [Thorne giggling] Something else. Something I think your whole family will really appreciate.",
        "Thorne: What?",
        "Taylor: What would you say if I told you I could get you forrester creations back?",
        "Ridge: Hello?",
        "Phoebe: Dad, hi.",
        "Ridge: Hey, kiddo. This thorne and aly's things?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, the movers brought them this morning.",
        "Ridge: Well, I came by to get a few things from the garage. Obviously, the space is needed. How are you doing with all of this, your mother's engagement to thorne?",
        "Phoebe: Well, you know, mom's finally happy for the first time in a long time. And you know, so are aly and thorne, so --",
        "Ridge: How about you?",
        "Phoebe: I'm good. I'm great. It's just --",
        "Ridge: Are we talking about shane here? Don't worry about it, sweetie. Police are gonna catch the guy. He's going to prison for what he did to you.",
        "Phoebe: Daddy, you really don't understand.",
        "Ridge: What don't I understand?",
        "Phoebe: Shane. Hector completely completely overreacted when he hit him with that bat.",
        "Ridge: Overreacted? Really?",
        "Phoebe: Yes. Yes! Shane had absolutely no intention of raping me.",
        "[Thudding sound]",
        "Bridget: Who's there? Oh, my god!",
        "Ridge: You're defending shane? Phoebe, he was the key to your mother's defense, and he ran off.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, but how could shane testify if the prosecutor was just gonna make him out to be a rapist? I mean, he would have been arrested as soon as he walked into the courthouse. That's why he ran. That's why he's hiding.",
        "Ridge: Hiding? What do you mean he's hiding? How do you know that? Have you seen him again?",
        "Phoebe: He just wanted the opportunity to tell me how sorry he was.",
        "Ridge: Phoebe, he's stalking you now. Please tell me you called the police.",
        "Phoebe: Well, he ran as soon as he heard sirens.",
        "Ridge: Shane mcgrath is trouble, and I don't want you anywhere around him. If you see him again, you call the police, understood?",
        "[Shane groaning]",
        "Bridget: Sorry. What happened to you?",
        "Shane: Oh, I just got into a little disagreement with some of my good buddies. They're on the beach. They wanted to fight me for the last couple dollars.",
        "Bridget: Well, you couldn't have won.",
        "Shane: Look, I know you don't want me here. But you are a doctor. You've just got to help me, okay?",
        "Bridget: Looks like you have a really deep cut above your eye. Look at me.",
        "[Shane groans]",
        "Shane: Ow, god!",
        "Bridget: Okay, okay, you're definitely gonna need some stitches there. Hold on. Move your hand. Let me see something. Take a deep breath. Does that hurt?",
        "Shane: Yeah.",
        "Bridget: Sounds like you have a couple of broken ribs. Take another deep breath. So this side's okay?",
        "Shane: Yeah, yeah. It seems like they were only interested in kicking in my right side here.",
        "Bridget: All right, well, let me just stitch up your eye. We're gonna get that side cleaned. Cleaned up first. And then I'll look at your ribs more closely. Let me get it. It's still dripping.",
        "Jackie: So, have you given any further consideration to taylor's offer?",
        "Nick: Yes, mother. Actually, I wrestled with my demons last night. And I won.",
        "Jackie: Well, that doesn't mean you can't ask her to dinner.",
        "Nick: She's engaged to another man, mother.",
        "Jackie: She can't have friends?",
        "Nick: She wants to cure me, mother. She feels if she can, I'll give the company back to the forresters.",
        "Jackie: Well, she's not always right, is she? She's human. Nicky, talk to her. Reveal yourself. [Nick sighs] I'm sure taylor will do the same. There must be something she needs to get off her chest. I think all she probably needs is the right person, a confidant. Why not you? You're ten times the man that thorne forrester is.",
        "Thorne: Taylor, I love you. But if you think nick marone's gonna give us back forrester, honey, you've lost your mind.",
        "Taylor: I went to see him earlier. I offered my professional help.",
        "Thorne: Turned you down flat, I'll bet.",
        "Taylor: Actually, that's exactly what he did. But when have you known me to turn down a challenge?",
        "Thorne: Well, nick certainly is that.",
        "Taylor: You know, he's been through some difficult emotions lately. I think he's had a lot of pain. Everything that happened with his mother, and then all of his anger at stephanie and losing brooke. I think he's just a decent man who's been through a string of bad things lately. And if he can understand what's going on inside of him, I think he would know that owning a company he can't even produce product for is absurd. I mean, I think he'll realize that he's not going to have any happiness from that.",
        "Thorne: So you think he'll just give forrester back to my family?",
        "Taylor: Well, I think it's a long shot, but what have we got to lose?",
        "Phoebe: Look, dad, you don't know shane like I do.",
        "Ridge: I know him well enough.",
        "Phoebe: He fell in love with me, dad.",
        "Ridge: For god's sakes, phoebe, he's dangerous. Not to mention the fact you're too young for him.",
        "Phoebe: I'm 18.",
        "Ridge: Look, it's not just hector. Your mom, harry -- they all agree that he's trouble.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, but that's only because of the way he came into our lives. And who's to say that there wasn't a reason for that.",
        "Ridge: This is not fate, phoebe. He saw a situation where people were vulnerable. Your mother, you --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Phoebe: Hello?",
        "Bridget: Phoebe?",
        "Phoebe: Bridget, hi.",
        "Bridget: Shane's here, at my house. And he got beat up pretty badly on the beach.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, just one second. I'm talking to my dad, but I'll call you right back.",
        "Ridge: Sweetie, I'm not taking any chances when it comes you. You're a wonderful, incredible young woman, and you deserve far better than that bum shane. I'm gonna get a few more things out of the garage, and then maybe you and I can go grab a bite, okay?",
        "Phoebe: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Thorne: Counseling nick? You actually proposed this to him?",
        "Taylor: I think it will help.",
        "Thorne: I don't know, taylor. I mean, you hanging around this guy? You know, as far as I'm concerned, this bastard's the enemy.",
        "Taylor: What is this thing with this enemy stuff with all you guys? If stephanie and jackie didn't hate each other so much, she wouldn't have gone over the balcony.",
        "Thorne: Well, obviously, no one's glad about that.",
        "Taylor: I know that. It's just, seeing you guys all scrambling around, trying to start a new company, I know it's a positive thing, but it's not going to have the same meaning that forrester creations does. This company's been the lifeblood of the whole family.",
        "Thorne: Exactly. Which is why nick will never give it back.",
        "Taylor: Well, he might feel that way right now, but when he has a little reality check, I think he's going to know that he's never gonna be happy running a fashion empire.",
        "Thorne: Happy? Who said that this had anything to do with making him happy? He took forrester creations out of pure vengeance. I mean, this guy hates ridge. He hates my mother.",
        "Taylor: Yes, but as I can help him understand the source of that hatred, owning forrester creations won't mean a thing to him.",
        "Thorne: He can't be trusted. Look, I'm sorry, taylor, but I don't want the woman that I'm going to marry to be hanging around this guy.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Bridget: Hello?",
        "Phoebe: Bridget, how badly is he hurt?",
        "Bridget: Well, just a cut above his eye and possibly a broken rib.",
        "Phoebe: A broken rib? Can I talk to him?",
        "Bridget: No, not right now, 'cause he's in the bathroom cleaning up. But nick left some clothes here that he can wear. Listen, phoebe, I think I should call the police.",
        "Phoebe: No, bridge, please don't do that.",
        "Bridget: There's a warrant out for his arrest.",
        "Phoebe: I don't -- I don't care.",
        "Bridget: Phoebe -- what do you want me to do?",
        "Phoebe: Just please let him stay there for the night so he can be safe.",
        "Bridget: My goodness, phoebe, that is a lot to ask.",
        "Phoebe: I know I'm sorry, bridget. I just -- he's not dangerous. Please -- please understand that.",
        "Bridget: Fine, for tonight. That's it. Do you understand? Tomorrow morning, we are settling this thing, and he's moving on.",
        "Phoebe: Thank you so much, bridget. (Woman) gus thinks it's his jobto protect me from the world. .",
        "Shane: Did you call the police?",
        "Bridget: I'm not gonna turn you in. [Shane sighs] I just called phoebe to let her know that you were here, and she asked me not to call the police. Hard time breathing, huh?",
        "Shane: Yup. It's the deep breaths that are really tough.",
        "Bridget: Move your hand. Take one more.",
        "Shane: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That really hurts, by the way.",
        "Bridget: It seems like it's just that one rib that's broken.",
        "Shane: All right, so what do we do about that?",
        "Bridget: Well, you keep your bandage on for sure. That should ease a little bit of the pain. And then tomorrow morning, you should get an x-ray.",
        "Shane: Okay. Look, I'm sorry that I got you involved.",
        "Bridget: Well, here I am, involved, yeah.",
        "Shane: It's just that phoebe, you know? I've never met anybody like her, all of her kindness. I mean, you, too.",
        "Bridget: Don't take advantage of her. She's only 18.",
        "Shane: I know that. Look, trouble has a tendency to follow me sometimes. And I don't want her to get wrapped up in that. I'll be gone. Tomorrow morning, I'm out of here.",
        "Bridget: Let me go get you a blanket.",
        "Shane: Thank you.",
        "[Shane sighs]",
        "Bridget: Shane, it's phoebe. She wants to talk to you.",
        "Shane: Hey, you.",
        "Phoebe: Hey. Bridge told me you got pretty beat up.",
        "Shane: Ah -- it's nothin'. I'll tell you what, though, bridget really -- she really took care of me.",
        "Phoebe: I'm so sorry about everything.",
        "Shane: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Phoebe: I'm -- I'm getting the charges against you dropped.",
        "Shane: Really?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah. I know you would never mean to hurt me.",
        "Shane: Phoebe, you have no idea what that means to me, that you would --",
        "Phoebe: What?",
        "Shane: Nothin'. Listen, phoebe, I was thinkin', it might be best that I -- that I leave town.",
        "Phoebe: No. No, no, no, no.",
        "Shane: Listen, it's best, 'cause I'm only gonna cause you more trouble.",
        "Phoebe: No, no, no. Look, don't say that. I don't want you to disappear. Shane, I --",
        "Shane: Yeah?",
        "Phoebe: We'll show everyone what you can do, okay? I might be the only one who does, but I believe in you.",
        "Shane: Okay.",
        "Phoebe: All right, good-bye.",
        "Shane: Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Phoebe?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah?",
        "Shane: Sweet dreams.",
        "Phoebe: You, too.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "[Taylor gasps]",
        "Taylor: Nick. [Thorne chuckles] Hello, nick.",
        "Nick: Yeah. I thought your suggestion for --",
        "Taylor: Counseling?",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Taylor: Counseling is not a four-letter word. It's ten.",
        "Nick: Well, I don't really think that I have demons, but if you want to take a crack, I'm all yours.",
        "Taylor: Want me to bring some holy water and a cross?",
        "Nick: Listen, I'm a busy man, so let's try to schedule this tomorrow in my office.",
        "Taylor: Okay, that works for me. We can schedule a few sessions then.",
        "Nick: You mean, I'm not getting cured in one day?",
        "Taylor: No, that's not the way it works.",
        "Nick: Oh, god.",
        "Taylor: Okay, so I'll see you over at forrester tomorrow.",
        "Nick: Satisfied?",
        "Jackie: Well, you could've picked a slightly more romantic spot. I mean, what is wrong with the cafe russe?",
        "Nick: My office is fine. If she wants to help me, she can help me here.",
        "Jackie: Wouldn't it be interesting, nicky, if you wound up helping each other? She's a wonderful woman. You can call it mother's intuition, whatever you like, but I think something really miraculous is about to happen, and it couldn't happen to a better person.",
        "Thorne: He agreed?",
        "Taylor: I don't know how seriously he's taking it, but yes, he did.",
        "Thorne: Well, it's a start.",
        "Taylor: I am going to do it. I'm going to get forrester creations back."
