        "Wyatt tells Liam that he can trust him. He is looking him in the eye and telling him that he will respect his marriage. He's won. He's got the girl so just let him and his mother keep their jobs. He will not cross that line with Hope. He will keep his distance. He has his word. Liam says he has no reason to believe him. Quinn hugs Eric and he says he will talk to Hope and see what he can do. She says it means so much for him to go to bat for her. They would do just about anything to stay on here at FC. Eric says they have been great employees and he'd hate to see them go. Donna interrupts and says Eric has a visitor. It's Steffy, and Eric is delighted to see her. Quinn's eyes light up. Brooke asks Hope just how strong is this attraction to Wyatt. Hope says strong enough to make her uncomfortable around him as a married woman. So having him work here is just not the best of ideas. It's not that she doesn't trust herself, but she doesn't want it to become more of an issue than it already is. He will be her brother-in-law so she will see him on holidays and family dinners but she can't see him every day at work. That's too much temptation. Hope gloats that Wyatt is pretty forward and not shy with his emotions or how he feels about Hope. Brooke says yes he is a very charming, confidant young man. Hope says and he is a really great guy. Maybe in another lifetime they would have gotten together and been very happy. But there is no reason to think about that now as she it totally committed to Liam and ready to be his wife. Brooke wants to be sure that she can't marry Liam and work with Wyatt. Hope says she'd just rather not tempt fate. Brooke just wants to be sure it is Hope making this decision and not Liam. Hope says it is and it won't be easy letting Wyatt go, but she thinks it is the best decision for her and Liam. She knows it has bothered Liam for some time and she wishes she had been more sensitive to his feelings. Brooke thinks it is okay that he got a small sampling of what it is like when Hope was caught up in all the competition and jealousy. Hope says Wyatt was always very sweet and kind to her, but he gave Liam a lot of grief and disrespect. Now she hopes they can come together and be as brothers should.",
        "Wyatt says he gives up. They are getting married and there is nothing he can do to stop that. Liam says then stop trying. Wyatt replies that he thought Liam was a bad guy because he heard all these stories about him and Steffy, all the botched weddings and broken engagements. And yes he judged Liam. He didn't think he treated Hope the way she deserved. And quite frankly he didn't think Liam would do right by her again. It wasn't any of his business and he gets that now, but he cared for Hope and he thought the best way to protect her was keep her away from Liam. And he was so sure that Liam would go back to Steffy eventually, but he didn't. And now it turns out that Steffy is no longer an issue. Steffy hugs Eric who then introduces her to Quinn. He asks if she is back to stay. She says no, only a quick trip, no one even knows she is here. She had a routine doctor's appointment. She says she hears things are going good for Liam and Hope and she is happy for her. Everything seems to have worked out for the best. Eric fills her in that Liam and Hope will be getting married soon. Quinn listens to every word they say. Wyatt tells Liam that he has learned his lesson and he is a changed man. From this day forth he will no longer flirt with Hope or hit on her or kiss her. Just please don't make her fire them. Losing her was bad enough but don't let his mother and all their employees suffer because of it. Liam says that is the last thing he wants to do. Wyatt thanks him. Liam says not so fast. He is not going to do that. He is not going to put a guilt trip on him. And he is so sick of him. He really did like the idea of having a brother and having a good relationship. But friendship that has to be earned and he doesn't trust him and will he ever, he doubts it. Wyatt asks if he has been listening to anything he had to say. Liam says every word and he is just saying what he thinks Liam wants to hear in order that he will give him what he wants. Wyatt barks that he is being sincere here. Liam replies then why doesn't he just be grateful for what he has and not on what he is losing. Hope has opened huge doors for him and his company all over the world. Their dad is rich and powerful and he even likes Wyatt. He has connections now and influence so just go use them and be grateful. Wyatt says he is grateful and he doesn't have to be reminded of that by Liam. He doesn't know why Liam is so threatened by a few kisses and flirtation, get over it. Go meditate on it if he has to. He is not some loser. He has brought a lot to Hope's life. He prevented a world class jewelry heist and gave Hope and her line global recognition. He supported her. He encouraged her and only had eyes for her. What can Liam say he did for Hope. He thinks a minute and says he has been patient, he's been good, he's been honest and he's Hope's fiancee and she's been in love with him for years and years and that is why she is cutting Wyatt out of her life. And Wyatt has no choice but to respect that. Quinn tells Eric that she has always wanted to go to Paris and see International and even make a quick trip to show them how to pair her jewelry with Eric's lovely gowns. He thinks it is a great idea and Steffy has the jet right now and is heading back to Paris. He can call her a car if she can be ready in a few minutes. Quinn gives Eric a big kiss which Donna sees. Quinn picks up her things and rushes past Donna and says shut up. Hope tells Brooke that Quinn will be disappointed, but she's a business woman. She will understand. And it feels so good that Liam is so excited about the wedding and there no longer is a Steffy and he's fully committed to her. Wyatt tells Liam that he's being real with him. What more can he want? Liam says oh he can be real all right when he wants something. Wyatt tells him he would be doing the exact same thing if he was in his position. Liam says he does not enjoy this; taking things from other people. He says he and his mother have made legitimate contributions to the company \u0096 thanks, but that doesn't change what he has done to Liam. And does Wyatt realize that his mom is unstable and self absorbed and way, way too obsessed with Wyatt. Wyatt says she is his mother, he's all that she has. Liam flares back that from the day he showed up Wyatt has been nothing but arrogant, cocky and condescending. He's insinuated himself in other people's lives by hitting on girls in committed relationship. Well no more of that. No more kissing and touching or flirting, so blame himself. Blame his mother even. This didn't have to happen if he was a man and not a child who didn't respect boundaries. If he had just honored those boundaries then maybe he and his mom would still be working at the company. But that's not the way it played out. And they could maybe even have been friends. But now it's over and done. And he and his mother have no more moves left to play. Donna tells Eric again that he needs to be aware of Quinn. She reminds her of a witch and even looks like one too with that jet black hair and piercing blue eyes. Eric thinks Quinn is beautiful. Donna says there is something wrong with her and if she is going to Paris, she hopes it is one way. Steffy is surprised when Quinn boards the jet and wants to know what she is doing here. Quinn says she came to stop her from going back to Paris. Quinn calls Wyatt who is shocked to hear his mom is leaving town right now. She says trust her. This trip is just what they need right now. Liam tells Hope that he saw Wyatt and the visit went well. Now he and his weird mother are out of their lives and they can concentrate on their wedding. Quinn tells Steffy there is still time to turn around and go back to L. A. She saw the look on Steffy's face when she heard Liam was getting married. She knows she still loves him. She is the only one that can stop that marriage and that is what she needs to do."

        "Brooke: How strong is this attraction to Wyatt?",
        "Hope: Strong enough to make me uncomfortable around him as a married woman.",
        "Brooke: I see.",
        "Hope: Not that my attraction to him lessens my commitment to Liam in any way. It's just that I don't think having him work here is the best idea.",
        "Brooke: So, you don't trust yourself?",
        "Hope: I just -- I don't want it to become more of an issue than it already is. Of course, he'll be my brother-in-law, so I'll see him at holidays and family dinners, but having him here every day -- it's... can't. It's too much temptation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: You know how forward Wyatt's been, how relentless. I mean, since the first day we met, he has not been shy about how he feels about me.",
        "Brooke: He certainly is a very charming, very confident young man.",
        "Hope: He is, and he's a really great guy, and... you know, maybe in another life, he and I would have been together and been very happy, but there's really no point in thinking about that because it's never gonna happen. I am totally committed to Liam. I am so ready to marry him and be his wife.",

        "Brooke: I get it. I do. It's just... I want to make sure that it's you making this decision, not Liam.",
        "Hope: I am. It's my decision. I'm not saying that it's going to be easy to let Wyatt go. You know, he's given so much to this company. He's been...really fun to be around, and -- but I really think that this is the best decision for Liam and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I give up. You and Hope are getting married, and there is nothing that I can do to keep that from happening.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you're right, so stop trying.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I-I thought you were a bad guy.",
        "Liam: Huh! Didn't know you felt that way.",
        "Wyatt: Because I heard all the stories about you and Steffy, you and Hope, all the botched weddings and the broken engagements. I judged you, Liam. I did. I didn't think you treated her the way that she deserved to be treated, and I didn't think that you were gonna...do right by her again.",
        "Liam: What makes you think that any of that was your business, Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: It wasn't, but that's the point, and I get that now, but I cared for her. I thought the best way to protect her was to keep you away from her, and I was so sure that you were gonna go back to Steffy eventually. I was sure of it. But you didn't. Turns out Steffy's no longer an issue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: This is my granddaughter, Steffy. Steffy, this is Quinn Fuller.",
        "Steffy: Nice to meet you.",
        "Quinn: Yes, nice to meet you, too. I have heard so much about you. You're even more beautiful in person.",
        "Steffy: I like her already.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Eric: So, are you here for a while? What's going on?",
        "Steffy: No, no. Just a quick trip. No one even knows I'm here.",
        "Eric: How's Paris?",
        "Steffy: It's great. Yeah. Dad's great. Thomas is annoying as ever. I hear things are going well for Hope. I'm happy for her and for Liam. Everything worked out for the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Thomas is doing well. He says hello. It's just so weird how we all ended up in Paris, huh?",
        "Eric: There are worse places to be.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, seriously. What a cool city to live in, although I do still miss living in L.A.",
        "Eric: Well, you know, L.A.'s not the same without you.",

        "Eric: Good.",

        "Eric: Look, before you go, I just found out that, um, Liam and Hope are getting married soon.",
        "Steffy: Good. Good. Yeah, I'm happy for them. That's -- that's what I wanted. Hey, I'm, uh -- I'm gonna head to the airport, all right?",
        "Eric: Okay.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Thanks for letting me use the jet.",

        "Eric: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Liam's been saying for some time how much it bothers him that Wyatt and I work together. I wish I'd been more sensitive.",
        "Brooke: In a way, I think it helped Liam understand how it made you feel having Steffy around all the time -- the battling back and forth, the competition, the jealousy.",
        "Hope: Yeah, but I was never married to Wyatt. I was never pregnant with his child. We didn't even, you know, so it's -- it's not really on the same level.",
        "Brooke: Mm, he got a taste of his own medicine.",
        "Hope: Yeah, a very small bite.",
        "Brooke: Well, you got through it, and you know what? You're getting married! That's what's important!",
        "Hope: You are absolutely right. And, you know, Wyatt -- Wyatt was always very sweet and kind to me and to everybody else, but he was -- he was rough on Liam. You know, Liam took a lot of grief and disrespect from Wyatt, and I'm really hoping that they can come together and get along as brothers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You got to believe me, bro. I am a changed man. I have learned my lesson. From this point on, I am backing off of Hope. I will no longer flirt with her or hit on her or kiss her -- nothing. Just please don't make her fire us. Losing Hope to you was bad enough. Don't make my mother and all of our employees suffer for it.",
        "Liam: Damn it. You know, that's the last thing I want.",
        "Wyatt: Good. Thank you. Man, I-I knew you'd understand.",
        "Liam: Whoa, no. No, no, no. No, stop it. You are not doing that.",
        "Wyatt: Doing what?",
        "Liam: You are not laying a guilt trip on me.",
        "Wyatt: Guilt trip?",
        "Liam: I am so sick of you. You know what? And it's too bad, too, because I really did -- I really did like the idea of having a brother. I wanted to be your bro and have a good relationship, but friendship doesn't come with the title. It has to be earned. And do I trust you? Not a chance. Will I ever? I doubt it.",
        "Wyatt: Have you even been listening to anything that I have to say?",
        "Liam: I have listened to everything you have to say, and you are saying what you think I want to hear in order to give you what you want.",
        "Wyatt: Dude, I am being sincere here.",
        "Liam: No, Wyatt, you're being ungrateful.",
        "Wyatt: Ungrateful?",
        "Liam: Why don't you focus on what you've got instead of what you're losing, huh? Hope has opened huge doors for you and your company all across the world. Our father is rich and powerful, and he likes you. You have connections. You have influence now. Why don't you use them? Why don't you connect to the gratitude and not the negativity? Be grateful for what you have.",
        "Wyatt: You know what? I am grateful. I don't need to be reminded of that by you.",
        "Liam: Sure about that?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. You know what? What did I do that was so threatening to you, huh -- a few kisses, some flirtation? Big deal. Get over it. Go meditate on it if you have to. I am not some loser. I have brought a lot to Hope's life. I prevented a world-class jewelry heist that gave Hope and Hope for the Future global recognition. I was there for her, I supported her, I encouraged her, and I only had eyes for her. What did you do?",
        "Liam: What did I do?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: I've been patient. I've been devoted.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Liam: Been honest.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: I've been good. I am her fianc\u00e9. I am the man that she has been in love with for years and years, and that is why she's cutting you out of her life. And you have no choice but to respect it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Eric... I was, uh, wondering if I could run something by you.",
        "Eric: Sure, by all means. What?",
        "Quinn: Well, I hope I'm not overstepping. I do still consider myself an employee.",
        "Eric: Oh, you are. So do I.",
        "Quinn: Um, well, ever since I've worked at Forrester Creations, I was hoping to take a trip to Paris and, you know, meet the team at International. They're such a vital part of the company. I just would love the opportunity to connect -- you know, show them how to pair the jewels with the outfits, your beautiful gowns.",
        "Eric: A meeting at International?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. No. I would take the jewelry myself. It would be a really quick but effective trip.",
        "Eric: You know, I think it's a great idea. I really do. Steffy's leaving for Paris right now. You can hitch a ride with her if you like, but she's leaving immediately.",
        "Quinn: I could be ready to leave in five minutes.",
        "Eric: Well, you're very motivated, aren't you?",
        "Quinn: Yes.",
        "Eric: All right. Look, I'll call for a car, and I promise I'll get in touch with Hope, all right?",
        "Quinn: Thank you, Eric. [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: Go on. Go on. Go on.",
        "Quinn: Okay, okay! Shut up, Donna.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: Quinn's a tough one. I doubt she'll take this lightly.",
        "Hope: Yeah, she'll be disappointed, but she's a businesswoman. She'll understand.",
        "Brooke: Mm. I'm sure that Liam's happy with your decision.",
        "Hope: He's just so ready to get married. He's so focused on me and the wedding, and it's really nice. It's nice to know that Steffy is in the past. She's no longer a factor. Liam is fully committed to me and only me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You know, I am being real with you here, man. What more do you want from me, huh?",
        "Liam: Oh. So, you're genuine when you want something, when it benefits you?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, please. Don't even pretend that you wouldn't be doing the exact same thing if you were in my position. I am trying to save our company. Do you know how devastated my mother will be if we lose our relationship with Forrester after everything we've done?",
        "Liam: Do you think that I am -- that I like this?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know.",
        "Liam: I am not the kind of person, Wyatt, who enjoys taking things from other people.",
        "Wyatt: Ha!",
        "Liam: You and your mother have made legitimate contributions to Forrester. Thanks. But it doesn't change what you've done to me.",
        "Wyatt: About the Steffy video? You can't blame that on me.",
        "Liam: Do you understand that your mom is, like, unstable and self-absorbed and way, way too obsessed with you?",
        "Wyatt: She's my mother. I'm all she has.",
        "Liam: And you have been nothing but arrogant and cocky and condescending since the minute you showed up, insinuating yourself into other people's lives, hitting on girls in committed relationships. Well, no more of that. No more touching. No more kissing. No more flirting. Blame yourself. Blame your mom. It didn't have to be this way. Maybe if you had been a real man instead of a child, if you had respected boundaries, if you had honored what I have with Hope, then we wouldn't be in this situation and your mom and you would probably still be working at the company. But that's not the way that it played out. It's over. It's done. You and I even could have been friends. But now you and your mom have no more moves left to play.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Quinn! What are you doing here?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I came to stop you from going back to Paris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Quinn is strange, Eric. There's just -- there's something wrong with her.",
        "Eric: I find her to be quite charming.",
        "Donna: I find her to be creepy. I mean, she reminds me of, like, a witch. You know, she even looks like one, too, with the jet-black hair and the piercing eyes.",
        "Eric: Well, I think she's beautiful.",
        "Donna: Yeah. I saw the kiss that she gave you. She's coming on to you, isn't she?",
        "Eric: We enjoy each other's company, yeah.",
        "Donna: Just be careful, Eric. She could be after your money, prestige, job security -- all the above. I'm telling you, there's something wrong with her. And if she's heading to Paris, hopefully, it's one-way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I'm leaving for Paris. I'm on the plane right now.",
        "Wyatt: What?! Why?",
        "Quinn: I'll explain later. We're about to take off.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, horrible timing. How can you leave town right now?",
        "Quinn: Just trust me, Wyatt. This trip is exactly what we need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hi, by the way.",
        "Hope: Hello. What did I do to deserve that?",
        "Liam: Nothing. Just happy to see you.",
        "Hope: Mm, same here. That's a very nice surprise.",
        "Liam: Yeah. So, um... Wyatt came to see me.",
        "Hope: Oh. Um... uh, how'd that go?",
        "Liam: You know... I think it couldn't have gone better.",
        "Hope: Really?!",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, just -- just that he's out of our lives. I mean, he and -- and his weird mother. They're not gonna be an issue for us anymore, and that's great. But I'm not -- that's not what I want to talk about. I think we should focus on our wedding. Let's do that. Let's make that happen.",
        "Hope: [Laughing] Okay.",
        "Liam: Right?",
        "Hope: Look at you, Mr. Enthusiastic --",
        "Liam: I'll show you enthusiastic.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: There's still time to turn the plane around.",
        "Steffy: Why would I want to?",
        "Quinn: You've got a whole life back in L.A., Steffy.",
        "Steffy: My life is back in Paris, and that's where we're going.",
        "Quinn: Well, then, we will have the whole trip to talk.",
        "Steffy: My grandfather e-mailed me and said you're on this jet because you're doing some business at International. But that doesn't explain to me why you don't want me to go back to Paris.",
        "Quinn: I saw your reaction when you heard about the wedding. You still love him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I can't believe it -- no more waiting. In the next few days, I'm gonna marry you.",
        "Hope: You better.",
        "Liam: Oh, believe me -- I'm gonna marry the hell out of you.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: The wedding's on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I want you to go back because you are the only one who can stop Hope and Liam from getting married. That's what you've got to do, Steffy. You've got to stop them."
