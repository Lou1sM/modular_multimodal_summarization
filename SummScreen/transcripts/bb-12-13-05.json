        "Stephanie: Hello?",
        "Taylor: Finally. Stephanie, I've been looking for you everywhere. Why you haven't you returned my calls?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, Taylor, I'm sorry. I just walked in the door.",
        "Taylor: Well, you haven't returned any of my messages. Are you all right?",
        "Stephanie: I'm fine. I've been with Felicia.",
        "Taylor: Oh. Are you coming into the office? I really need to talk to you.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, yes, I'll be there as soon as I can, all right? How's the baby?",
        "Felicia: Napping.",
        "Stephanie: Was he restless? Did he get a good night's sleep?",
        "Felicia: Mother, I've never been apart from him for that long before. I so badly wanted to pick him up and hug him, and kiss him, and tell him how much I missed him, but he needs his rest.",
        "Stephanie: I told you, honey, he'd be fine. We should've stayed at the hospital and waited for those test results.",
        "Felicia: You can blow your whole life waiting for test results.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, but until you know --",
        "Felicia: Worrying is not going to change the results. Neither is talking about it. So please, just keep it between you and me, okay? And about Dominick, too.",
        "Stephanie: You don't want me to tell anyone about the baby?",
        "Felicia: I think Nick needs to deal with this in his own way, mother.",
        "Stephanie: And what about your illness? When are you going to tell him about that?",
        "Felicia: There may not be anything to tell.",
        "Stephanie: But if there is, no secrets. You have to have the treatment. The radiation, the chemo. Whatever you need.",
        "Felicia: I don't want to think about that right now, okay? I need to keep positive. Right now, I'm in remission, and I'm going to stay that way.",
        "Stephanie: Felicia.",
        "Felicia: The alternative is something I just can't face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: That's it? That's your whole plan?",
        "Eric: Yes, I had Gregory draw that up while I was at Lawrence- Whitter.",
        "Brooke: And you really think Stephanie's going to sign this?",
        "Eric: She has to.",
        "Brooke: She's just going to hand Forrester back over to you?",
        "Eric: Well, the reason she took it away from me was that she was angry at me for marrying you.",
        "Brooke: Eric, I understand the logic. I'm just not sure it's going to work.",
        "Eric: She's more vulnerable than you think.",
        "Brooke: So you keep saying, but I just haven't seen it.",
        "Eric: You can't discount our history.",
        "Brooke: Yes, but what about our history? Stephanie's not going to forget that either.",
        "Eric: She may be able to overlook it if she's convinced that you are no longer a threat.",
        "Brooke: Persuading Thorne and Taylor is one thing. But Stephanie? If she figures out that this is a trick, we could make the whole situation worse.",
        "Eric: I'm well aware of the risks, all right? But I am determined. She's going to sign these papers. And I'm going to get this company back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: Stephanie, you are not going to believe what I have to tell you.",
        "Stephanie: Well, I've had enough surprises for today.",
        "Taylor: What, did you and Felicia argue? She's not going to take the job?",
        "Stephanie: Taylor, I honestly don't know what's going to happen with Felicia. So I don't think we should count on her being one of the new designers.",
        "Taylor: Do you want me to talk to her again? Or maybe we could get Thorne --",
        "Stephanie: No, no, no. Let's not pressure her right now. You said you had something to tell me. Eric and Brooke were at each throat's all day yesterday. I think it's finally happened, Stephanie. Eric has turned his back on Brooke. He sees her for what she really is.",
        "Stephanie: You're right, I don't believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Felicia: Everything's always a surprise with you. You can't just call me and tell me you're coming over?",
        "Nick: Give you a chance to say no? Mm-mm. So, where's Dominick?",
        "Felicia: Asleep in the guest house with Renee.",
        "Nick: Is it okay with you if I wait around until he wakes up? Keep an eye on you. Make sure you don't go anywhere.",
        "Felicia: I promised I wouldn't leave until this was settled.",
        "Nick: I heard you.",
        "Felicia: And I explained why I kept your son a secret.",
        "Nick: Felicia, you didn't know anything about Bridget and our child when this boy was born.",
        "Felicia: No. But when I left for Europe, you were still hung up on Brooke. So when I found out Taylor came back, I assumed that you and Brooke would be together.",
        "Nick: Well, you assumed wrong.",
        "Felicia: Nick, it doesn't matter who you're involved with, okay? I don't want my son to become some duty for the courageous sea captain.",
        "Nick: Duty? This is my child. My son. I want him in my life.",
        "Felicia: Bridget's okay with that?",
        "Nick: I haven't told her yet.",
        "Felicia: But last night you said --",
        "Nick: I tried. She just wanted a quiet evening at home with no heavy conversation. No stress. She begged me, so -- I gave her that. I wanted to tell her this morning, but she got called into the hospital. I'm going to tell her. It just has to be the right time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: Honey, Eric wouldn't turn his back on Brooke unless she was dressed like a cowgirl and wanted to hop on.",
        "Taylor: Well, I guess the less-than-favorable working conditions did add to their tension.",
        "Stephanie: They're angry at me, not at each other.",
        "Taylor: Mm-hmm. Well, it's easy to get angry at those you're closest to.",
        "Stephanie: It will pass.",
        "Taylor: You are not listening to me. Okay, listen, I saw it with my own eyes. Eric was holding up one of his beautiful designs, and he was saying how classic and beautiful it was, and she started insulting it, and saying that it was all conservative. And then, it got really personal.",
        "Stephanie: Brooke has never had a problem airing her dirty linen at the office.",
        "Taylor: No, she's not the one who did it. It was Eric. And it was in detail. And then he told her that he regretted ever having been involved with her, and ever having married her.",
        "Stephanie: The only thing he regretted about that marriage was that it wasn't consummated.",
        "Taylor: How do you know about that?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, please.",
        "Taylor: Well, now the whole office knows about it, believe me. I'm telling you, there is a major rift between those two.",
        "Stephanie: I'll believe it when I see it. All right, I'll go down and I'll visit with them.",
        "Taylor: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: You're rushing this Eric. Make a move too soon and Stephanie will smell a rat.",
        "Eric: Everything's in place now. We've set the trap.",
        "Brooke: We don't even know if anybody's told Stephanie what they've heard.",
        "Eric: She knows.",
        "Brooke: Well, then why isn't she here, gloating?",
        "Eric: Look, Taylor and Thorne know how Stephanie feels about you, all right? If they think that I've turned against you, they won't be able to keep it to themselves.",
        "Brooke: Maybe they didn't buy it.",
        "Eric: Oh, they bought it. The way you reacted after I came after you, I almost believed it.",
        "Brooke: It was hurtful, even though it was just an act.",
        "Eric: Well, I had to make it believable.",
        "Brooke: Maybe it was too believable.",
        "Eric: Brooke, I didn't mean it.",
        "Brooke: So you never, ever thought that I demeaned this company, tarnished the Forrester name, drove a wedge between you and your sons? That never crossed your mind, not even for one second?",
        "Eric: Brooke, it's not personal. It's for the business. It's for the company.",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry, Eric, I just can't. I know how you feel about this, but I can't do it. I can't let you lower the hemline one more centimeter.",
        "Eric: It's been done already. It's done.",
        "Brooke: Well, then undo it.",
        "Eric: No, that's your expertise, not mine. Or does that only apply to marriages?",
        "Brooke: Your clients are going to be watching this very closely. Stephanie already dropped the bomb on the \"reunited\" campaign. We can't make any more changes.",
        "Eric: That whole thing would've been scrapped as soon as our annulment hit the papers. Stephanie was just the first person to see the writing on the wall.",
        "Brooke: I'm not worried about Stephanie's vision, I'm worried about yours.",
        "Eric: Well you should be worried about mine, because I think I'm beginning to see a little more clearly every day. Look, I know, sex sells, I admit that. But at the end of the day, what matters more -- money, or self-respect?",
        "Brooke: After what this old bat did to you, you're actually giving into her? Now where's the self-respect in that?",
        "Stephanie: Trouble in paradise?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Taylor: No wonder you look so exhausted.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, moving Sally into the house took a lot longer than we expected.",
        "Taylor: So she really can't take care of herself?",
        "Thorne: I know. It's hard to believe. Sally's always been so self-reliant.",
        "Taylor: To the extreme.",
        "Thorne: Well, I think closing down Spectra took more out of her than the accident did.",
        "Taylor: Well, she'll be fine. Don't worry, she's a fighter.",
        "Thorne: Yeah. By the way, have you seen my mother? I'm looking for her.",
        "Taylor: Oh, yeah, she just left.",
        "Thorne: Did you tell her about what's been going on with Brooke and dad?",
        "Taylor: Oh, yes. Only she wouldn't take my word for it. She won't believe Eric is over Brooke unless she sees it for herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: I'm interrupting something?",
        "Eric: We were just discussing my latest design.",
        "Stephanie: Sounded more like a disagreement.",
        "Brooke: You'd like that, wouldn't you? That's why you put us down here in the basement -- to pump up the tension, wait till the frustration got to us.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I hear the only frustration that Eric is suffering is not due to me, but to the fact that you didn't put out.",
        "Eric: Where'd you hear that?",
        "Stephanie: Everyone heard it. Apparently, you two put on quite a show.",
        "Eric: Brooke, take this up to accounting, will you? They're waiting for it. What do you want?",
        "Stephanie: I've been spending some time with Felicia, and I was hoping that you would do the same.",
        "Eric: Yes, I plan to.",
        "Stephanie: Good. So I thought I would just come by and tell you that -- anytime you want to drop by the house, that's fine with me.",
        "Eric: Thank you. I just as soon see her somewhere else. Is that it?",
        "Stephanie: What, I can't drop by and see how things are going?",
        "Eric: Bury me down in this dungeon here and now you want to Brooke.",
        "Eric: Leave me alone.",
        "[ Glass shattering ]",
        "Stephanie: What's this?",
        "Eric: It's our family.",
        "Stephanie: You didn't have me airbrushed out of it?",
        "Eric: Unlike you, I like to look back and remember the good times. Just because we're not happy now doesn't mean we never were.",
        "Stephanie: So, is that what you're working on?",
        "Eric: Yes, and spare me the acerbic critique, all right? I'm not in the mood.",
        "Stephanie: I like it. Brooke didn't.",
        "Stephanie: Why didn't she?",
        "Eric: She doesn't like the bodice. She wants to have a plunging neckline.",
        "Stephanie: Well, she never really understood elegance.",
        "Eric: I'm beginning to realize that. I'm beginning to realize that you were right about a lot of things that I didn't give you credit for. Look, I know that an apology is not maybe the right thing for right now, but -- I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Are you okay? You look a little tired.",
        "Felicia: I just didn't sleep at all last night.",
        "Nick: Dominick keep you up?",
        "Felicia: No. Actually, Dominick's a really good sleeper.",
        "Nick: Good. Good for him, and good for you. I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but you know I'm in love with Bridget, right?",
        "Felicia: Of course.",
        "Nick: We understand each other.",
        "Felicia: I understand that you are committed to Bridget and her baby.",
        "Nick: Good.",
        "Felicia: But that doesn't mean I'm completely over you.",
        "Felicia: Don't get me wrong. Just having you in Dominick's life is more than I ever expected.",
        "Nick: We're this boy's parents. We are going to be in each other's lives, too. But, you are going to have to accept that Bridget and I --",
        "Felicia: Your marriage is in no danger from me, Nick.",
        "Nick: I just don't want there to be any misconceptions.",
        "Felicia: I haven't been pining away for you, if that's what you think. Well, maybe I have. But I didn't get back here to cause you trouble. That's my mom's job. She's the troublemaker.",
        "Nick: Oh, boy. You two still butting heads?",
        "Felicia: Is the earth round?",
        "Nick: Well, this could be a good chance for you guys to make up. You know what they say, that kids have a way of bringing people together.",
        "Felicia: Don't let Bridget hear you say that. She might get nervous.",
        "Nick: She has nothing to be nervous about. None of us do. This is all going to work out just fine.",
        "Felicia: Hey, look who's up.",
        "Renee: Ooh, he wanted to see his mama.",
        "Felicia: Thank you. Hey, my little love. Hi. Did you have a good nap? Oh, you so smell so good, I just want to eat you up. Look who's here. Daddy's here. [ Felicia chuckles ] You want to hold him?",
        "Nick: Please. Hi, buddy. How're you doing today? Good little guy.",
        "[ Phone ringing ]",
        "Felicia: Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Felicia Forrester.",
        "Dr. Nomura: Felicia, it's Dr. Nomura. I have your test results. Can you come back to the hospital?",
        "Felicia: Can you just give them to me now?",
        "Dr. Nomura: I really prefer to do it in person.",
        "Felicia: It's all right. I'd really like to know, please.",
        "Dr. Nomura: I'm very sorry, Felicia. I'm afraid the cancer's come back. We need to resume chemotherapy as soon as possible. Felicia? Felicia are you there?",
        "Felicia: Yes, I'm still here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thorne: I can understand why mother would be skeptical. I mean, everything that Brooke has done, my father has supported.",
        "Taylor: And if that's changed, then Stephanie needs to know.",
        "Thorne: Can you imagine -- I can't tell you what a relief it would be if my mother and father started getting along again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stephanie: You're sorry?",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: For what, Eric? Stealing my company? Abandoning me for Brooke?",
        "Eric: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: Just a few days ago, you were defending her.",
        "Eric: I had to ask myself why she constantly needs defending. Look, I guess being played for a fool a second time sort of changed my perspective.",
        "Stephanie: You're bitter.",
        "Eric: I'm ashamed, actually. I'm ashamed of the things I've done, and some of the things I've said.",
        "Stephanie: Exactly what are you saying, Eric? That after all these years, you finally see Brooke as I do?",
        "Eric: I see how my supporting her all this time has hurt you. And I understand why you're so angry. Here. For you.",
        "Stephanie: First an apology, now a gift?",
        "Eric: Let's consider this a first step in a new direction. It's a simple gown, it's it's elegant it's glamorous. It embodies the new vision for this company -- a vision that I'm beginning to see has some real merit.",
        "Stephanie: So this design is an olive branch?",
        "Eric: Yes. Look, I know you're going to be angry about all this for a very, very long time. And I understand that one simple \"I'm sorry\" is not going to solve our problems. But I am sorry, and I should have said it earlier.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you, Eric.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I just saw Stephanie leaving.",
        "Eric: How did she look?",
        "Brooke: Shocked.",
        "Eric: Good. Good, I think I got to her.",
        "Brooke: What did you do?",
        "Eric: I got a chink in her armor, I think.",
        "Brooke: That's all?",
        "Eric: Yes, but that's a lot. She was a lot more vulnerable than I thought she was. She had a dozen chances to cut me off at the knees, and she didn't take any one, I swear. I knew she was vulnerable, but I didn't realize how much.",
        "Brooke: Eric, be careful. You're the one who's sounding vulnerable right now.",
        "Eric: Look, I know I'm walking a fine line, all right? But this has to be done, and I'm going to do it. I'm going to get my company back.",
        "Brooke: Don't you mean our company?",
        "Eric: Of course, our company. I'm going to get our company back."
