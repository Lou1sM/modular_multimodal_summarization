        "While they are kissing, Liam takes issue with Hope that she has to go so soon. She reminds him that she is going to see Eric. He changes his mind and tells her to skedaddle. He says he knows this has not been easy on her but this too shall pass. After Quinn and Wyatt are gone, things will be easier. Steffy tells Quinn that she will help her set up some appointments if she will give her the hotel information. Quinn informs her that she'd hoped just to tag along with Steffy now to meet International people. Quinn tells Steffy that she'd still like to talk to her about Liam. She is the only one that can stop this wedding so please give her a chance to convince her to come home. Steffy says she doesn't know Quinn and she certainly doesn't know Wyatt. All she knows is Liam and Hope have been trying to get married for a very long time and Wyatt's crush on Hope doesn't concern her. Quinn says Liam has been trying and failing because he still has feelings for Steffy. And it's not a crush for Wyatt. Steffy will understand that when she is a mother. She's just doing everything she can to give her son a chance. And she's not giving up on Hope and Wyatt just yet. Liam tells Bill that Hope just left but she's on her way to talk to Eric about Quinn and Wyatt. He gave her an ultimatum. Bill says he is proud of his son. He handled it like a real pro, a real Spencer. Liam says it is a real shame as they contributed a lot to the HFTF line and gave it a big boost but then they blew it. Bill says he knows he means it now. But Wyatt is his brother and it may not happen right away but once he and Hope are married and settle down he is sure he will be open to have Wyatt around. Liam says he hopes Bill is right. Bill tells him that Wyatt said he'd respect his marriage. So once Liam has said his vows he is sure some of that suspicion will dissipate. Not just for Hope but for Wyatt as well. Liam doesn't know what suspicion Bill is talking about. He fills him in \u0096 still loving Steffy. Eric greets Hope at his home and says he knows why she is here. Hope apologizes and says it is not what she really wants but it is necessary. They have to cut ties with Quinn Artisan Jewelers. Eric doesn't understand since HFTF is doing better than it ever has. Hope says yeah she knows, but Liam does not want her working with Wyatt and she understands why. She respects Liam's position. Eric says he doesn't. Liam can not make decisions about her line based on his own personal reasons. Hope stammers that she doesn't have a choice. It's important to Liam so it's important to her. Quinn and Wyatt have to go. Steffy thinks she sees through Quinn's scheme. She will go back home to Liam leaving Hope for Wyatt and Quinn's little company will be just fine. Quinn tells her that her focus is on Wyatt. It is Liam who doesn't even work at FC that wants to take Wyatt's job and future away from him all because he is threatened about the connection between Hope and Wyatt. She can see where Liam might be missing Steffy. And she can have him back. Steffy blurts out that she left, she lost Liam just like she lost their baby. Eric asks Hope what about Quinn and Wyatt, and their business. Hope says she feels bad. She doesn't want to hurt anybody. They've given them a lot of exposure and she is sure they will be fine. Eric wonders what Liam is afraid of. Surely Wyatt doesn't pose any problem to him now. Hope says no, but why ask for trouble. Eric deduces that Hope herself does not trust herself with Wyatt. Hope admits that she doesn't want the temptation. Just seeing him every day at work .well this way is the best. She and Liam have waited a long time so she just can't let anything interfere.",
        "Bill says Liam still has feelings for Steffy and always will. But he's proven now that his feelings for Hope is just as strong and worth fighting for. He'll get married and these feelings for Steffy will fade. Liam says maybe. Bill wants to know if Liam has talked to Steffy. Liam replies that Bill knows he can not have Steffy in his life and then turn around and demand that Hope not have Wyatt in hers. Steffy is a soft spot for Hope .too many bad experiences and he is not going to let that happen again. Quinn apologizes and says she did not know that Steffy and Liam had a child. Steffy says she was pregnant, it wasn't planned and they had a few good months but she took it all away. She explains about the motorcycle accident. Liam did not leave her but there were complications and the next thing she knew she was barren. She wasn't in the frame of mind to think about adoption or other options. And she still can't. She just had to leave and give Liam a chance to have a family. Hope can do that so that is why she can't go back. Hope returns home and tells Liam that Eric reluctantly agreed to let Wyatt and Quinn go. Legal needs to look into a few things but that's all there is to it. She says they both have proven they are each other's #1 priority and Wyatt and Steffy are no longer an issue. At International Quinn says she feels awful. She did not know about the baby Steffy lost. But she is more convinced than ever that Liam belongs with Steffy. And it is not too late. Steffy says going back would not accomplish anything. Things are fine just the way they are. Quinn says not for Wyatt. Steffy replies that she has done that before and felt awful. She does believe Wyatt would probably be good for Hope but she has to do what is best for Liam. The phone rings and Quinn is about to leave when her ears perk up upon hearing that Steffy is speaking with a doctor. Dr. Caspary tells Steffy that the procedures worked and she has every right to think she can conceive and carry the baby to full term. Steffy blurts out she can have a baby. Quinn stops dead in her tracks. Eric stands before the portrait of Stephanie with martini in hand. He says it is a little early in the day but who the hell cares. There are hirings and firings, Wyatt and Liam, on and off again weddings .lots of drama in this old house on the hill. He only wishes she were there to share it with him. It's quiet up here without the kids. The old days, yeah, he misses them. And the worst part he has to drink alone. A voice behind him says he could help him with that. Eric turns around and Ridge holds out his hand to shake. Eric gives him a hug."

        "Steffy: Oh. Okay.",
        "Quinn: You know, Steffy, we're about to land, and we really haven't had a chance to talk.",
        "Steffy: About gems?",
        "Quinn: About Hope and Liam. You're the only one who can stop this wedding. Please, Steffy... give me the chance to convince you to come home.",
        "Steffy: Okay, look. I don't know you, and I don't know Wyatt. All I do know is that Hope and Liam have been trying to be together for a very long time. And your son's crush doesn't really concern me.",
        "Quinn: Liam has been trying and failing because he still has feelings for you. And it's not just a crush. Steffy, you're not a mother yet. But someday you're gonna understand why I'm doing everything I can to give my son his chance. I mean, these past few months, watching him working with Hope, falling for her -- he's changed. He's become the man that I've always known that he can be. And I'm not giving up on the idea of him and Hope. Not yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: Hey. I didn't know you were here. I was just hitting the bag a little bit. I would have asked you to work out with me.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah, you know, I would have, but, uh, I was otherwise engaged.",

        "Bill: Let me guess. To talk about Quinn and Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Yeah. You know, it -- it's a shame. They really -- they contributed a lot to Hope for the Future, and they gave the line a big boost. It would have been an ideal partnership, but, uh... they blew it.",

        "Liam: Uh, yeah, but I mean, it was necessary. No Wyatt, no Quinn -- that's necessary.",
        "Bill: Okay. I know you feel that way right now. Wyatt is your brother. Doesn't have to happen right away, but once you and Hope are married and settled down, I'm sure you'll be more open to having him around.",
        "Liam: I hope you're right.",
        "Bill: Liam, Wyatt said that he would respect your marriage. So once you've said your vows, I'm sure a lot of the suspicion is gonna dissipate. Not just for Hope, but for Wyatt, as well.",

        "Bill: That you're still in love with Steffy. What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Okay. In your \"Scenario,\" I go back to L.A., back with Liam, Hope gets together with Wyatt, and suddenly your company's in very good shape.",
        "Quinn: [ Chuckles ] Okay, my focus is on my son. Liam, who doesn't even work for Forrester, wants to take away my son's job and my son's future, all because he's threatened, because he sees the connection between Hope and Wyatt. Look, I heard about your connection to Liam, your marriage. I can see what he sees in you. Look at you're. You're beautiful. You're smart. You're talented. He must be missing you as much as you're missing him. You can have him back.",
        "Steffy: But I left.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Dad, what are you saying?",
        "Bill: You still have feelings for Steffy. You always will. Why else would Wyatt think he can make a move on Hope in the first place? And more importantly, why did she let him? But you have proven that your feelings for Hope are just as -- as strong and worth fighting for. You'll get married, and these concerns about Steffy will -- will fade away.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] Maybe.",
        "Bill: Have you talked to her?",

I-I promised Hope that Steffy would no longer be in our lives, and trust me, she's -- she's gonna hold me to that. Steffy's a soft spot for Hope. I mean, too many bad experiences there.

        "Quinn: You?",
        "Steffy: I had a motorcycle. Liam had his concerns, so of course I didn't ride. Until there was traffic on PCH, and I just wanted to get home. So I took the bike. That was the end.",
        "Quinn: He left you?",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. He would never do that. It was -- it was me. There was complications at the hospital. But these things happen, you know. One day, you're pregnant, and the next, you're barren.",
        "Quinn: Oh, God.",
        "Steffy: Liam would be such a great father. It's... it was all I kept thinking about, how being married to me would just hold him back.",
        "Quinn: Did you ever think about adoption?",
        "Steffy: No, no. I-I couldn't. I-I just wasn't in the frame of mind to start thinking about other options. And I still can't. I just had to get away... and give Liam a chance to have a family. Experience what it's like to have a family, go through the whole pregnancy and pick out the names, paint the nursery. Hold his wife's hand in the delivery room. I wasn't able to give him that, but Hope could. So you really think I want to go back to L.A.? You think I want to fight for Liam when he's so close to having that family? A wife who can actually give him what I can't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I'm back!",

        "Hope: Hi.",
        "Liam: Hi. Eric's onboard?",
        "Hope: Reluctantly. Yes, he is. But he -- you know, he knows it's my line, and he trusts me to know what's best for it. Legal needs to look into some things, but that's it.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Hope: You're welcome.",
        "Liam: You know what's nice is now we can devote all our energy to the wedding.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Sounds very good. I hope... I hope that this proves to you how committed I am.",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Hope: Now we've both proven that our relationship is the number-one priority and Wyatt is no longer an issue. And finally, neither is Steffy.",

        "Steffy: Suzanne will set you up in the conference room.",
        "Quinn: I feel awful.",
        "Steffy: You should go to your hotel. Rest.",
        "Quinn: No. No, about what we talked about on the plane -- your history with Liam. I had no idea.",
        "Steffy: It's not something I talk about a lot. But I knew you'd keep pressuring me to go back to L.A. and now you know why I can't.",
        "Quinn: No. No, after hearing what you've been through with Liam, it's convinced me even more. He belongs with you and not with Hope. It's not too late.",
        "Steffy: What would that even accomplish? Things are fine the way they are.",
        "Quinn: Well, not for Wyatt. And not for you. You've -- you've banished yourself to a completely different country because you think he's better off with Hope. And if that were true, then you would have no trouble going home and looking him in the eye.",
        "Steffy: He's moving on. And I am not interfering. I have done that before, and I felt terrible. Look, I do believe you that your son would be good for Hope. But I have to do what's best for Liam.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Quinn: I understand.",

        "Steffy: Oh, no, no. It's fine. I've been waiting for your call. Do you have the results?",
        "Dr. Caspary: Happy to say I do. This is the kind of call I enjoy making.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. Really?",
        "Dr. Caspary: The procedures have worked.",
        "Steffy: Wait. I can have a baby?",
        "Dr. Caspary: All our tests indicate there's no reason that you shouldn't be able to conceive and carry a child to full term. I-I want you to schedule a follow-up, you know, in a few months with your physician in Paris. But it all looks good.",
