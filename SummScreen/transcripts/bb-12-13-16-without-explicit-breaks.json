    "Recap": [
        "Liam makes Steffy a smoothie and offers to take her to work. She needs this to make a good decision about running FC. He tells her not to forget who Quinn is or what she has done. Do not let her get into her head. Eric is excited about going into the office for his first day. He says it feels good to just be there and he does not have to make the big decisions any more as CEO. He has asked Rick and Ridge both to be there and he knows they are not that happy with him right now. Rick tells Ridge that Steffy does not have the qualifications. Ridge thinks she will do a good job but it is just not her time; he should be CEO. Wyatt tells Bill that Eric has requested he be over at FC for a meeting. Bill wants to know what is the catch that Quinn wants Steffy as CEO. He tells Wyatt that Steffy is ten times as smart as Ridge and he knows she can do the job but this is about matchmaking not just running the business. Quinn tells Eric that she is so in awe of him and she cannot wait to get to FC. Steffy says she has not forgotten what Quinn did. Liam says then she knows all of this is manipulation. He can go to his dad and get his shares and Steffy can get out of this altogether. They can start their own fashion house. She's stunned that he is asking her to leave FC. She reminds him how long it takes to even start a fashion house much less to get to the level that the Forrester's are. He says saying yes to this is saying yes to Quinn and she needs to protect herself and them \u0096 do not take the job. Bill tells Wyatt that Steffy has moved on and is even talking about marrying Liam so he does not want him to get his hopes up with her. Wyatt says he has no control over his mother so he will just let things play out. Pam tells Eric that she is go glad he is back and she tried to keep it low key but she did make a few lemon bars. They all gather in Eric's office but when Steffy comes in Quinn says they think it is time for a more feminine view and she hopes it will be Steffy's soon. Liam drops in on Bill who chides him for finally showing up for work. He had turned his office into a petting zoo for Will as it kept it busy at least. Liam chimes in that he gets more work done at home without having to listen to Bill yammer on and on. Steffy asks Eric if he is sure that he does not want to come back. Eric says no, he is fine doing some designing at home. He is behind Quinn 100% and wants Steffy to come onboard. When Wyatt joins them Rick is the first to ask why he is there. Eric says he wants Wyatt to join the Executive team. Both Ridge and Rick scoff that he has no qualifications and does not even look the part. Eric says he is impressed with him and thinks he will do fine as Head of Public Relations. And an added plus is that he trusts him. Quinn is elated. Eric says now all they need is for Steffy to say yes to being CEO.",
        "Liam whines to Bill that this is Quinn's latest efforts of buying Steffy for Wyatt. Bill says it is a wonderful job and it will be hard to turn her granddad down. Liam states that the job is enough but now they want to get Wyatt over there too; she cannot be more transparent. Is everyone blind to Quinn being pathological. Steffy has to say no to this. Rick asks Eric what does his other two sons get. Eric says quickly they get to keep their jobs. It has been decided. They betrayed him and let him down and he needs people he can trust. Wyatt qualifies. Rick will still be running International and Ridge can still design. Quinn says it breaks her hurt that Wyatt's marriage must be sacrificed but she had no idea that Eric was going to make this offer. He loves them all and just wants peace and harmony. She hopes they can put their feelings behind them. She tells Steffy that she has so much admiration for her and hopes she will give FC a chance. Eric tells her that she is so much like her namesake and she would be so happy today if Steffy would accept the offer and become the new CEO of FC."

        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Liam: Made you a smoothie for the drive to work. Some brain food. Helps you make good decisions.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Liam: It's a big day. You either take the C.E.O. position or you don't.",
        "Steffy: And you're hoping I won't.",
        "Liam: I am not at all comfortable with Quinn's involvement, no.",
        "Steffy: Neither am I, but think about my grandfather. He wants me to take over. He wants me to run Forrester creations.",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, he does, because of Quinn. Don't forget that. Don't forget who she is or what she's done, and for god's sake, don't underestimate her.",
        "Quinn: Don't you look dapper!",
        "Eric: Thank you. It's my first day back at the office. I thought I should make some kind of an effort. [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Are you excited?",
        "Eric: I am. Especially since I don't have to do anything. I can just goof off. My interim C.E.O. has to do all the work.",
        "Quinn: Ha, well, I may not be C.E.O. for much longer, if Steffy takes the job, which I hope she will.",
        "Eric: Yeah. Well, we'll find out soon enough, won't we?",
        "Quinn: Mm.",
        "Eric: I asked rick and ridge to join us. They are not too happy with me these days.",
        "Quinn: She deserves the job just as much as they do.",
        "Eric: I couldn't agree more. I hope Wyatt's available. I asked him to join us.",
        "Rick: It must be something important if dad's coming in for the meeting.",
        "Ridge: Well, maybe Steffy's made her decision.",
        "Rick: Well, do you have any idea which way she's leaning?",
        "Ridge: No, not sure.",
        "Rick: Steffy is just not C.E.O. material. She doesn't have the experience. She doesn't have the ability.",
        "Ridge: All right, slow down. She'll do a fine job.",
        "Rick: If you really felt that way, why aren't you more enthusiastic? Why aren't you more supportive?",
        "Ridge: Because it's not her time. I should be C.E.O.",
        "Bill: Ridge got inside Brooke's head, used R.J. To guilt-trip her into being with him.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Obviously it did the trick.",
        "Bill: You know, when it ended, it was all about doing what was best for her son, doing the right thing for the family. She never said anything about ridge being the love of her life and she couldn't live without him. I give it two weeks.",
        "Wyatt: God, that sucks, dad. I know how hard it is to not be with the woman you love, you know?",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Wyatt: Eric wants me over at Forrester for the meeting. It's about Steffy.",
        "Ridge: If this were dad's idea alone, that'd be one thing.",
        "Rick: Yeah, but coming from Quinn, it's so obvious. She doesn't care about Steffy being C.E.O. or repairing the family.",
        "Ridge: It's all a load of bull, isn't it?",
        "Rick: Yeah. What she wants is to get Wyatt and Steffy back together.",
        "Wyatt: My mother and Eric are offering Steffy the C.E.O. position.",
        "Bill: Wow! [Laughs] Quinn wants Steffy to be C.E.O.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: What's the catch?",
        "Wyatt: Why does there always have to be a catch?",
        "Bill: Have you met your mother?",
        "Wyatt: Can we not be so negative, please?",
        "Bill: Have you met your mother?",
        "Wyatt: Stop saying that! This is a great opportunity for Steffy, if she decides to accept it.",
        "Bill: This is no knock on Steffy. She is 10 times smarter than her father and certainly capable of running that company. But your mother is matchmaking for you again, Wyatt. It's not about a promotion.",
        "Quinn: Well, that's very nice of you to include Wyatt. Why do you want him at the meeting?",
        "Eric: Well, he's family now, isn't he?",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Eric: And I trust him. Like you.",
        "Quinn: Always.",
        "Eric: Okay. So, shall we go?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Eric: Quinn? What? What is it?",
        "Quinn: I am just so in awe of you. I've been hoping for this day, that you'd be well enough to go back to the company that you worked so hard to build.",
        "Eric: The only reason I'm standing here right now is because of you. The wonderful care and attention you gave me. I only wish that they could all see it -- the whole family. Especially Steffy. Come on.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Eric: Come on.",
        "Steffy: I haven't forgotten about what Quinn has done.",
        "Liam: Okay, but -- then can you at least explain to me why you're even considering this? Because you know it's a manipulation, right? You know that Quinn is diabolical. You've been trying to distance yourself from her for months, which effectively makes this a huge step backwards. Okay. Okay, okay. How about this? How about I go to my dad, right, and I convince him to give you and your dad his shares? Why don't we just -- why don't we just get you the hell out of there altogether?",
        "Steffy: Wait, you want me to leave Forrester?",
        "Liam: Yes. I mean, as long as Quinn is there, it's a toxic environment anyway. Why don't you -- hey. Steffy. Why don't you come to Spencer? We'll start our own fashion house.",
        "Steffy: You want me to leave Forrester? Start a new business?",
        "Liam: Why not? Think about this. Spencer fashions. Just the two of us. We could run it together. Right? Huh?",
        "Steffy: Liam, do you realize how hard it is to create a fashion house? How many years it took my grandparents to get Forrester off the ground?",
        "Liam: I -- [Laughs] I know, it's ambitious, but we are ambitious people, aren't we? And I would be willing to do it. Hell, I would be willing to do anything to keep you away from Quinn.",
        "Steffy: My grandfather wants this. And I already let him down enough as it is.",
        "Liam: I -- I know that, but in this circumstance, a yes to your grandfather is a yes to Quinn. It is!",
        "Steffy: Liam, I can't do this right now. I'm gonna be late. Please. I don't want to --",
        "Liam: Don't -- don't do it.",
        "Steffy: Liam, please!",
        "Liam: Steffy, Quinn has not changed. She is just as volatile as ever. You deserve to be C.E.O. You really do. And you would be freaking great at it. But not like this. Just protect yourself, okay? Protect us. Don't take the job.",
        "Wyatt: I told mom not to do any interfering.",
        "Bill: When has she ever listened to you?",
        "Wyatt: I can't control what she does or doesn't do!",
        "Bill: Bingo! All right, look. You're my son. I just don't want to see you get your hopes up that this is gonna be an in for you with Steffy. She's moved on. She's with Liam. They're talking about getting married.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Bill: Yeah. So, you know, you just got to lick your wounds and move along.",
        "Wyatt: I'm supposed to move on from my relationship when you're not moving on from Brooke?",
        "Bill: Apples and oranges. I'm a badass.",
        "Wyatt: I'm still married to Steffy, all right? I haven't given up on us. She ended things with me because she had issues with my mother. Now, if this creates some kind of understanding or common ground with them, that'll be great for Steffy and me.",
        "Bill: What about your brother?",
        "Wyatt: What about him? Liam wants Steffy to not take it. He says that it's my mother just maneuvering again.",
        "Bill: He's right.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Let's just see how it all plays out. How about that? I'm gonna go to Forrester and find out what they need me in the meeting for. Good talk. Thank you.",
        "Pam: [Gasps] Eric! Oh, I am so thrilled to see you! Welcome back.",
        "Eric: Thanks. Thanks, pam. Thank you. I'm glad to be here.",
        "Pam: I wanted to have a big to-do, you know, invite everybody in the building, but I got your e-mail. I know. So I kept it low-key like you requested. But I couldn't help making a few lemon bars.",
        "Eric: That's very sweet. Thank you. But this is not about me. This is about Steffy today.",
        "Pam: Yeah. We're in all suspense wondering what her decision's gonna be. Oh, ridge and rick are in here now, waiting for you.",
        "Quinn: Come on.",
        "Eric: Okay.",
        "Rick: Dad. Wow, you look great.",
        "Eric: Thank you. I feel great.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Eric: Thanks to my wife. I'm looking forward to getting things settled around here.",
        "Rick: Well, I know that you and Quinn are prepared to offer Steffy the C.E.O. position, but you look like you're ready to tackle it all over again.",
        "Ridge: You know, you're right. Maybe you should hang on for a while. What do you think, Quinn?",
        "Eric: No, I'm gonna step back for a bit.",
        "Ridge: Okay. And just to be clear, the two people that have run this company before -- we're not being considered?",
        "Rick: You know, dad, we could actually share responsibilities. Co-C.E.O. That way, you don't have to choose one son over the other.",
        "Eric: The decision's been made to offer the position to Steffy.",
        "Ridge: And this decision was yours. Or was it yours?",
        "Steffy: Hey. Granddad, look at you!",
        "Eric: Hello, sweetheart.",
        "Steffy: You look amazing. Oh! We miss you back here at the office.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: Well, Eric and I are thinking that this office could use a feminine touch. Hopefully, it'll be your office soon, Steffy.",
        "Liam: Hey, dad.",
        "Bill: Moondoggie! Wow! What made you drag your butt off the beach and join the rest of us here in the working world? How special.",
        "Liam: You do know I get more done at home when I'm working without you bothering me all day long, right?",
        "Bill: This is perfect because I was turning your office into a petting zoo for will. I think we'll get a lot more use out of it.",
        "Liam: Fine! Have at it! Have a blast.",
        "Bill: All right, grumpy. What's wro-- oh, I got it. You're concerned about a certain woman becoming the C.E.O. At a certain company.",
        "Liam: How did -- right. Mini-me told you.",
        "Bill: He tells me everything, unlike you.",
        "Liam: I'm genuinely worried, dad. I -- obviously Quinn is up to something.",
        "Bill: What's Steffy's take?",
        "Liam: I don't know. I -- I don't even know what she's gonna decide. Apparently, there's this big meeting happening at Forrester right now.",
        "Bill: Yeah, that's why Eric wanted Wyatt over there.",
        "Liam: I don't like this. I mean, it's classic Quinn. She's manipulating again.",
        "Quinn: You're right. This was originally my idea, but Eric supports it wholeheartedly.",
        "Eric: I do. I absolutely do. Steffy, nothing would make me happier than for you to accept this position.",
        "Steffy: I appreciate it how much faith you have in me, but I have to ask you again. Are you sure you don't want to come back?",
        "Pam: We would all love it if you did, Eric.",
        "Eric: Nope. I'm gonna be working from home, mostly, now. Sketching. Designing. But make no mistake, any of you, I'll be keeping a close eye on everything.",
        "Rick: Look, I realize I disappointed you, dad, and I hurt you, but to pass over me like this, I can't help but feel like I'm being punished.",
        "Ridge: I think that's the point, rick.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Eric: Wyatt, thanks for coming.",
        "Rick: What's he doing here?",
        "Eric: There are a number of changes I want to make to the executive team. Wyatt, I know your mother appreciates very much the support that you've given her recently, and I appreciate it, too. I appreciate how much I was able to trust you to help her. Now, I know that you can stay at Spencer if you choose to, but I would be honored if you would join us here on the executive team at Forrester Creations.",
        "Rick: Say what?",
        "Wyatt: Seriously?",
        "Quinn: Eric, really?",
        "Ridge: What are you doing, Dad?",
        "Rick: Look, no offense, but Wyatt's got zero qualifications. I mean, would you look at him? He's not even executive material.",
        "Eric: I disagree. I've gotten to know my son-in-law, and I like him. And more importantly, I trust him. You've proven yourself in marketing and social media. You've made the quite the influencer out of Steffy. You're versatile and you're talented, and as a result, I would like to offer you the head of public relations here at Forrester Creations.",
        "Rick: What? P.R.?",
        "Ridge: Are you kidding, dad?",
        "Wyatt: This is unexpected, I think, for all of us. Yeah. Yes. I -- I humbly accept.",
        "Eric: Wonderful.",
        "Quinn: Oh, sweetheart, that's so wonderful! I am thrilled! Oh! Oh! Eric, what a surprise!",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I'm speechless. Thank you. I -- I promise I won't let you guys down.",
        "Eric: I'm sure you won't. So, Steffy, what do you say? Your executive team is taking shape now. You gonna accept the position of C.E.O.?",
        "Liam: Think of everything that Quinn has done.",
        "Bill: Did you forget who you're talking to?",
        "Liam: It's so obvious what she's doing. This is her last, most desperate attempt to win Steffy over.",
        "Bill: It's her way of getting Steffy and Wyatt back together.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Right. Exactly. That's exactly what it is. Fine. Why not? It's got nothing to do with the job or how well Steffy would do it. Everybody knows that Steffy could do that with her eyes closed, but Quinn -- Quinn is using this as a chance to buy Steffy, but she's treating it like this olive branch that she's extending that's gonna save the family. It's ridiculous.",
        "Bill: Don't underestimate it, Liam. It's a hell of an offer.",
        "Liam: [Exhales sharply]",
        "Bill: The power and prestige of running Forrester creations. On top of that, her grandfather is making the offer. It's hard to turn it down.",
        "Liam: I know. I know. But if Steffy gets in bed with Quinn, there's no telling what would happen.",
        "Bill: I know exactly what would happen.",
        "Liam: Oh, God, dad. Come on! You know what I'm talking about. Quinn is gonna use this to her advantage, and now -- and now they're getting Wyatt down there? I mean, is it gonna get any more transparent? Quinn is trying to play matchmaker.",
        "Bill: I told your brother exactly the same thing.",
        "Liam: Okay. So I'm right. Right? I mean, this is -- this is insane. She's got Eric on her side, and now Wyatt's all gung ho, and he's acting buddy-buddy with his mom again. Is everyone freaking blind? Quinn is pathological.",
        "Bill: Agreed. But it's Steffy's decision.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. I mean, I told her what my feeling are. She can't -- she can't take the job.",
        "Pam: Quinn must have put you up to this.",
        "Eric: No, pam. Assigning Wyatt to the executive team was purely my idea.",
        "Rick: Wow. Wyatt gets to run a whole department. Steffy gets offered the C.E.O. position. Hey, Dad, what do your two sons get left with?",
        "Eric: You get to keep your jobs.",
        "Rick: After all my years of dedication to this company. After my expertise at international...",
        "Eric: I'm well aware of your qualifications and your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, rick. You stay as head of international. And ridge continues to design. I don't want this to be contentious. It's been decided. There's no discussion. You betrayed me. You let me down.",
        "Rick: And we apologized for that, Dad. We admitted to our mistakes.",
        "Ridge: What else do you need?",
        "Eric: I need people running this company I can trust. Wyatt qualifies.",
        "Rick: Gosh, dad, how can you be so naive? This is Quinn giving her son what he wants.",
        "Quinn: Can I say something, please?",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Eric: You don't need to ask. You're interim C.E.O. of course. And if Steffy does not accept this, you'll still be the C.E.O.",
        "Quinn: Eric has been so kind to me. And to my son. We really do make each other very happy, and I wish you all could see that. And it breaks my heart to know that Wyatt's marriage was sacrificed as a result of it. Now, I had absolutely no idea that Eric was gonna ask Wyatt to join the executive team, and obviously I'm thrilled, especially because I know how well Wyatt and Steffy will work together. This family has been fractured for too long. Eric loves each and every one of you. He just wants peace and harmony, and I know that when Steffy steps into this leadership role that she will also heal the family as a result. I just wish we could all put our differences behind us and not allow them to affect the people that we care about anymore. Steffy. I have so much admiration for you. And I believe that you can succeed at anything if you're willing to give it a chance. And I think you will. I believe in you, Steffy. I think we all do.",
        "Eric: I absolutely agree with everything you said. Steffy. You're as brave and as gifted as your namesake. If your grandmother were alive today, she would be so proud of the woman you've become. And if she could see you behind that desk, it would give her such joy. The same would be true for Quinn and me. So what do you say? Are you gonna accept the offer? Are you gonna become the new C.E.O. of Forrester Creations?"
