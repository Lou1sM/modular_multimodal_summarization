    "Recap": [
        "Ridge says things seemed to have settled down between Steffy and Liam because of the Sally thing. She says yes they have put it behind them. You just can't get stuck in the past with all the guilt and blame. Just love each other and move on. She says she and Liam are together and nothing will ever come between them again. Ridge says she is doing the right thing by just focusing on her marriage. He says sometimes you have to lose or almost lose a person to know how much they mean. She guesses he is doing a little of his own soul- searching. He can't wait to show her the engagement ring. She says Brooke will love it. Ridge says yes but then he knows her father-in-law is going to be the sore loser. Bill is distracted and neither Justin, Wyatt or Liam can get his attention over what he calls minutia. They think it is about Brooke although Bill denies it. They all say they will help him with anything. He tells the Three Stooges to back off. Justin says he has never seen him like this. Liam says they all know what he is going through .he just lost the woman he loved. Bill says they are right, he did. He admits he screwed up. Liam says he cannot keep beating himself up; it is not hopeless. Bill tells them to get out of his office, they are not going to sit around and discuss feelings. Go do something productive. Justin and Wyatt leave but Liam stays behind. Bill questions if he knows what the word productive means. Liam says he knows what that feeling is like. When Steffy walked out on him he really felt like he had blown it. But Steffy got over it and he is glad they did or he doesn't know where they would be right now. Bill grumbles that he is glad things worked out. That's the problem usually Liam cannot let things go. Forgiveness is like that; you either get it or you don't, so Liam should just accept it and stop ranting about it. Liam says he knows but Steffy won't let him apologize; she is apologizing to him. Then he goes on a long explanation of how Steffy just drove around and ended up at the Forrester guest house and just crawled into the bed there. But Steffy did not even tell him that. It was Quinn who found Steffy's bracelet. Bill asks a few questions then says the important part is that Steffy came back and it really doesn't matter where she was during that period. Liam says he doesn't know how but in that guest house somehow Steffy found peace and forgiveness so he knows something happened that night. Steffy tells Ridge that she almost lost Liam and she does not want that to happen again. He is the most constant thing in her life right now.",
        "Liam tells Bill that family is where it's at. And love always will be even when it is not reciprocated. Bill tells him to stop. This is not going to be a competition to see who has the most to regret. Bill says he deserved everything Liam did to him. He says he is not a perfect person and he had no right to hit his son .he wants to be better ..he can be better. He cannot live in the past or change reckless decisions that he made but he can assure him his perspective has changed and he admits now how much Liam means to him. And that he values Liam's happiness more than he does his own. Liam gives him a big bear hug and says he knows that. Justin and Wyatt come back but find Bill in a foul mood and he barks at them to leave again. He doesn't care what they do. He thinks back on his time with Steffy. Meantime Liam goes home and explains to Steffy that he and his father had a very productive talk. Bill is devastated right now but he needs to focus on the good things in his life. Steffy says they have a fresh start and she wants to focus on that. She tells him he is the most important thing in her life and she is sorry she lost sight of that for a moment. She loves him so much and she never wants to lose him."

        "Steffy: Hi. I told pam I'm taking the morning to myself, and here you are.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm bearing gifts, so take it easy.",
        "Steffy: Mm. Checking up on me?",
        "Ridge: [ Sighs ] Maybe.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: You haven't been yourself lately. Well, you seem okay today.",
        "Steffy: It's been that noticeable?",
        "Ridge: A little bit. I don't blame you. It's been stressful for you. Everything going on in your life, and that thing with sally and liam...",
        "Steffy: Yeah, well, uh, liam and I are putting it behind us, like it never happened.",
        "Ridge: Easier said than done, isn't it?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I guess we can, uh, only move forward, and now we're doing that.",
        "Ridge: Good. Marriages can be challenged, you know, and sometimes people do bad things. Doesn't mean they're bad people. But if you can find it in yourself to forgive, that's the key, I think.",
        "Wyatt: I say we cut our losses.",
        "Justin: We're not there yet.",
        "Wyatt: Well, then, how long do you propose we wait?",
        "Liam: Listen, if you give the division some support, I promise you, they will turn it around.",
        "Wyatt: No support. No, I -- dad, what do you think? Come on.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Bill: I don't care. You decide.",
        "Justin: What's going on, dollar bill?",
        "Bill: What are you bothering with this minutiae for? Just deal with it.",
        "Liam: This is about brooke, isn't it?",
        "Bill: No. It's not brooke.",
        "Liam: Dad, it's like you're on another planet. You really think we haven't noticed that?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, like, if you need our help, we'll help you with whatever.",
        "Bill: All right, would you -- would you three stooges just give it a rest?",
        "Justin: Got to say, I've never seen you like this.",
        "Liam: Hey. Hey. We know what you're going through. You just -- you just lost the woman you love.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, I did. I screwed up.",
        "Liam: Okay. But you can't keep beating yourself up over it, right? It's not hopeless. You'll find love again.",
        "Bill: You think we're all gonna sit around here and talk about our feelings now? Hell no. Get out of my office and do something productive.",
        "Justin: I'll, uh, run those numbers again.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, so I can close down that division, unless my soft-hearted brother here wants to talk us out of that.",
        "Liam: Uh, you know, I'll catch up with you guys in a minute.",
        "Bill: Come on, liam. Do you not understand what \"go do something productive\" means?",
        "Liam: I know -- you don't want to talk about it, you're angry with yourself. You don't know what to do. Dad, I know that feeling. When steffy walked out on me, i really thought I blew it.",
        "Bill: Well, you and steffy are fine.",
        "Liam: We're great.",
        "Bill: I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Liam: We're great now, but it wasn't easy, especially for steffy. It took a lot for her to get over this. I'm grateful she has because i don't know where we'd be right now if she hadn'T.",
        "Steffy: Shouldn't have happened. Under any other circumstance, it wouldn't have.",
        "Ridge: \"Any other circumstance?\" What does that mean?",
        "Steffy: Uh... liam and sally. I mean, they thought they were gonna die. You don't know how someone's gonna react in a situation like that. I guess it's just pure shock and desperation.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm proud of you. I commend you for forgiving liam.",
        "Steffy: Well, it's like you said -- marriages get challenged. But you just get through it somehow. I mean, you just can't get stuck in the past with all the guilt and the blame. We've all done things we wish we hadn't, so... I guess you just agree to love each other and move on. Liam and I are together. And nothing will come between us ever again.",
        "Ridge: Pam. Pam! Take a breath. I'll be -- I'll be right there. Okay. Wow.",
        "Steffy: Now pam is wondering where you are.",
        "Ridge: [ Sighs ] Yeah, I told her, we got to keep my schedule a little flexible, and now she's panicking.",
        "Steffy: I'll bet.",
        "Ridge: It's mainly because you're not the in the office these days.",
        "Steffy: Well, when I'm at work, I need my head in the game. I can't be distracted, and i have been.",
        "Ridge: You're doing the right thing. Got to focus on your marriage.",
        "Steffy: No, you're right. It has to be my first priority.",
        "Ridge: It's working. You look happy.",
        "Steffy: You know, there were moments when I didn't think i was gonna feel this way ever again. It made me realize how much i need liam.",
        "Ridge: Well, sometimes you have to almost lose what you care about to see how precious it is.",
        "Steffy: Has someone been doing a little soul searching?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. There's something I've been, uh, thinking about, wanted to ask your opinion...",
        "Steffy: Dad, what?! This is beautiful!",
        "Ridge: [ Laughs ]",
        "Steffy: [ Gasps ] Oh, my gosh. [ Cellphone chimes ] Sorry. Two seconds. I'm sorry. Oh, my...",
        "Ridge: Everything okay?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it's just my annual appointment reminder. It's all good. This is gorgeous. Brooke's gonna love it.",
        "Ridge: So you approve?",
        "Steffy: I do.",
        "Ridge: Cool. Uh, I realize it's not gonna make it any easier for you because your father-in-law is a bit of a sore loser. And I'm not sure how he's gonna react when he finds out that he's lost the woman he loves.",
        "Liam: You know, I still can't really figure it out.",
        "Bill: That's your problem, son. You can't let anything go.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah, you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?",
        "Bill: Look, you and steffy are back on track. Why do you have to question it?",
        "Liam: Because it happened so fast.",
        "Bill: Well, that's how forgiveness works. You either get it, or you don'T.",
        "Liam: Dad, I thought steffy was leaving me. I mean, when she walked out, i really did think that I had blown it. And then, you know, before i know it, she's back and we're renewing our marriage vows, and I don't have to convince her of anything suddenly, in fact, she's refusing to hear any of my apologies, and she apologized to me.",
        "Bill: Are you complaining?",
        "Liam: No, I'm not complaining, I'm just -- I'm saying it's amazing. I mean, imagine the kind of emotional fortitude it takes to be able to cut through all the -- all the confusion and pain and just say, \"hey, this is what I want, this is what needs to happen.\" When steffy came home that night, it was like she was a different person. Now, she told me at first that all she did was take a drive, but then she admitted what really happened.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Liam: She went to the forrester estate, the guest house, and she -- she was so upset, she just crawled right into bed.",
        "Bill: That's what she said?",
        "Liam: No, at first, quinn was the one who told me.",
        "Bill: What the hell does quinn have to do with this?",
        "Liam: Because she found steffy's bracelet in the guest house and gave it back to her.",
        "Bill: So, uh, what? That crackpot tried to make some whole mystery around the bracelet?",
        "Liam: No, actually, I know -- I know where you're going with that, but actually, it was just casual conversations because quinn, she has a new line, and she's using the same material as the bracelet, so...",
        "Bill: Well, you know what, liam... steffy came back to you, right? So it really doesn't matter where she was or what she was doing, does it?",
        "Liam: No, because of what happened at that guest house. I mean, steffy found peace and forgiveness somehow, someway. Now, I don't know what, but something happened that night.",
        "Ridge: What just happened? What did I just do? It almost sounded like I felt sorry for bill. I'm not sorry for bill because he doesn't care about anybody. He doesn't even care about his own son.",
        "Steffy: Dad, that's not true.",
        "Ridge: That's not true? He blew up a building that liam was in.",
        "Steffy: It was a terrible accident, dad. Bill was horrified.",
        "Ridge: Was he? Did he feel responsible? No, he didn'T. You know why? Because he's a shark, and everyone around him is gonna get hurt.",
        "Steffy: Okay, you know what, I don't -- I don't want to talk about bill anymore or the demolition or liam and sally. I'm putting this behind us. Don't you want to do that with brooke?",
        "Ridge: I do. Once I put that ring on her finger, everything else can be ancient history.",
        "Steffy: That's great. It's gonna be a new beginning for all of us. Look, I just -- I just really want to just live in the moment, you know? And just appreciate liam. We have an incredible life together. I mean, yeah, we've gone through some terrible times, but we have wonderful ones, too. And I'm so fortunate to be loved and supported by my husband. His love is the truest, most constant love I've ever known.",
        "Ridge: That's what a dad wants to hear.",
        "Steffy: I love you. I almost lost liam. I don't want that to happen again.",
        "Liam: Honestly, you're probably the last person i should be talking to about steffy and me.",
        "Bill: Why would you say that?",
        "Liam: Because we're happy.",
        "Bill: That should bother me?",
        "Liam: I mean, I -- I know that your divorce with brooke is happening. Wyatt feels terrible about it, too. We've all be there. I almost lost steffy. I didn't, but I could have, and that scared the hell out of me, so I can only imagine where you're at right now.",
        "Bill: I'm just grateful to have my sons. My family together.",
        "Liam: Well, that's because family is what it comes down to for you.",
        "Bill: Right now, yeah.",
        "Liam: Not just right now. I mean, it's always been the case that nothing's more important to you than family, even... [ Sighs ] Even when it's not reciprocated.",
        "Bill: Stop. Just -- just stop, liam. This isn't gonna become a competition about who's got more to regret. Believe me, I made more mistakes as a father than I can even list.",
        "Liam: Yeah, maybe. But how many sons can say they've been afforded the opportunities from their father that you've afforded me? I mean, I -- I came to you out of nowhere. We were strangers to each other, and you helped me achieve things I never could have imagined in my wildest dreams. And then how did I repay you for that?",
        "Bill: I deserved it. I deserved it. I've done some awful things lately. The spectras... hitting my son... I'm not a perfect person. Far from it. I want to do better. I can do better. I can't undo the past. I can't change reckless decisions that I've made. But I can assure you that my perspective has changed. I realize how much you mean to me. And how much I value being your dad. Your happiness is more important to me than my own. And I want you to know that.",
        "Liam: I do. I do.",
        "Wyatt: So, my bleeding-heart brother might actually be right about this. Where is he, by the way? He's missing a golden opportunity to say \"I told you so.\"",
        "Bill: He went home.",
        "Justin: Something wrong?",
        "Bill: He wants to spend some time with his wife.",
        "Wyatt: Did I miss the memo that work was optional today? Because as much as I love you two, I do have more important things I'd much rather be doing.",
        "Bill: Like what? Exactly. I need you here.",
        "Wyatt: Aww, that's sweet, but liam does have responsibilities, too, you know.",
        "Bill: His first responsibility is to his wife. Steffy is his priority right now.",
        "Wyatt: Right. They have been dealing with a lot lately. I'm just glad they're working through it.",
        "Bill: Well, some wives are willing to do that. Steffy's one of them. She's phenomenal. Liam is lucky to have her. And if I can help them put their relationship back on track, I'm damn well gonna do it, and i expect everyone to be on board with that.",
        "Justin: Of course we are, bill. Wyatt was joking.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I'm glad he's taking my advice. I warned him that he was gonna lose her if he kept messing around with sally, and steffy was not gonna take anymore --",
        "Bill: All right, enough! You two clowns gonna keep standing around here, gossiping about your brother, or are you gonna pick up his slack?",
        "Justin: We're on it, bill. We're on it. Let's go.",
        "Bill: Get me a report on that division!",
        "Wyatt: The division I was gonna cut, or...?",
        "Bill: Any division, wyatt! I really don't care! Just get me a report on any division!",
        "Wyatt: Why's he yelling so much?",
        "Liam: Hey. You heading to the beach?",
        "Steffy: Just in time to join me.",
        "Liam: Yeah. It's almost like you knew I was on my way home.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I guess it's like my sixth sense. So, what brings my handsome husband home in the middle of the day?",
        "Liam: Oh, this guy?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Oh, he just couldn't bear to be away from his beautiful wife, that's all.",
        "Steffy: Do you have to go back to the office?",
        "Liam: Uh, no. No. My dad -- my dad gave me the rest of the day off.",
        "Steffy: What, did you have an argument?",
        "Liam: No, actually... no, we had a really -- a really nice conversation about the mistakes we've made and how grateful we are to have gotten through it. It was good. It was really good.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, aren't we all?",
        "Liam: I may have mentioned how happy I am to have the most wonderful, forgiving wife on the planet, but...",
        "Steffy: No wonder he kicked you out.",
        "Liam: No, I was -- I was very sensitive. I'm sure he's really devastated right now.",
        "Steffy: Well, your father needs to put everything in the past, just like we have.",
        "Liam: Yeah, he's trying. I just -- I think he needs to focus on all the good things in his life right now.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I think that's great advice. I think we just really need to forget about your dad and work and, really, everything and just focus on ourselves. I mean, this is a fresh start. It feels really good. I don't want to forget about all the things that happened in the past. We've been through a lot, and some of it has been difficult, but we've experienced the happiest moments of our lives together. Always believed in our special bond with you is where my soul belongs after all the bitter and the sweet we are finally back in each other's arms when you're lost in a crowd and your heart is pounding out loud I'm standing with you I'm standing with you I'm standing with you I'm standing with you I'm standing with you",
        "Steffy: [ Laughs ] Our relationship has given me... it's given me strength. And you just keep me grounded and balanced. And when we're not together, it's like everything spins out of control, but when I'm with you... it's like everything makes sense. You remind me of what matters, and you do that by example in the way you love me. What we have is so precious. You are the most important thing to me in the world. And I'm sorry I lost sight of that, only for a moment. I never want to lose you again. I love you so much."
