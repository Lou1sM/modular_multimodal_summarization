Then he is surprised when he learns that Sasha called and is in Los Angeles and is coming over today. He's not happy about that, her coming to the hotel room. He wants to know why she is coming.

No residual damage?", "Eric: Full recovery, according to her doctors. Thank God.", "Nicole: It's so scary, what she went through.", "Zende: Can you imagine taking an electric shock like that?", "Eric: Well, you don't have to worry about that happening again. We replaced that whole -- that whole panel back there. It was very old. Like me.", "Maya: [Chuckles]", "Eric: Something else you need to know -- after the accident, Ivy filed a restraining order against Steffy.", "Zende: Seriously?", "Nicole: So, what does that mean for the company?", "Maya: Yeah, if -- if Steffy can't go anywhere near Ivy --", "Rick: It means one of them can't be here.", "Eric: That would be Steffy.", "Nicole: Wow.", "Rick: You know, see -- see, that complicates things. The president of Forrester can't show up to work.", "Eric: Well, at some point, we're gonna have to deal with that vacuum, but for now, let's just hope that Steffy and Ivy can come to terms. Now, on a happier note, how are you?", "Nicole: Oh. [Chuckles] Um, the pregnancy is real.", "Zende: That's for sure.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: Oh! [Chuckles] Hey. Looking mighty good there, lady.", "Vivienne: It's not too much or...not enough? I have no idea how these people in L.A. Dress for a job interview.", "Julius: Listen, it's the DMV. So you can't be too...California freedom.", "Vivienne: [Chuckles]", "Julius: And you also don't want to be uptight Midwestern. So, actually, I think you have the perfect match.", "Vivienne: I don't have that many choices, so this is gonna have to do.", "Julius: [Chuckles]", "Vivienne: Oh, yeah. We have to speed up that apartment search if you're gonna start bringing your toys in here, 'cause this room is hardly big enough for us.", "Julius: Yeah, well, we'll find something soon, sweetie.", "Vivienne: Maya's offered more than once.", "Julius: Viv, we are not gonna be Maya's charity case, and that's final.", "Vivienne: She just wants to help because she's in a position to help, Julius.", "Julius: Viv, did you hear what I just said? That's final.", "Vivienne: You are so bullheaded.", "Julius: Well, I still got my pride, if that's what you mean.", "Vivienne: Oh, don't I know that. Oh! I forgot to tell you.", "Julius: Mm?", "Vivienne: We got a nice surprise last night.", "Julius: What was that?", "Vivienne: Sasha called, and, uh...she's coming over.", "Julius: Where? Here? Wait. Sasha's in los Angeles? Ng", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I feel pretty good, other than the morning sickness that lasts all day.", "Eric: It was like that for your mother when she was carrying you.", "Rick: Well, would you look at that. My genes working already.", "Nicole: Ha. Would have to be the throwing-up gene, wouldn't it?", "Eric: It'll pass.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Soon, I hope. Like, tonight.", "Nicole: What's tonight?", "Zende: Special. At least, that's my plan, if you're up for it.", "Nicole: I'm definitely up for it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: You two definitely need a night off.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: Yeah. You need to be extra-vigilant about saying connected these next few months.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: That's right.", "[Cell phone beeps]", "Eric: It's easy to feel left out of a woman's pregnancy. You got to guard against that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: We will. Oh, my gosh! You're not gonna believe this! This is gonna be awesome. Never guess who's in town.", "Maya: Who?", "Nicole: Sasha's here. She got in last night.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: Sasha's coming to this motel room?", "Vivienne: It's where we're at.", "Julius: Well, you didn't have to tell her that. I mean, you could have met her anywhere if you just had to see her.", "Vivienne: Don't be silly. Why wouldn't I invite her over? Come on. Sasha's like family.", "Julius: I mean, weren't you just the woman who was talking about how cramped this room was?", "Vivienne: Julius, she's not rolling a cot in. She's just stopping by. What is wrong with you?", "Julius: Did she say why she was coming?", "Vivienne: No. I didn't ask that, either.", "Julius: Well, then what was the conversation?", "Vivienne: \"I'm in L.A. And I want to see you.\" What is wrong with you?", "Julius: Listen, I just don't want a parade of people from back home showing up because they know Maya's got money.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: Sasha's not like that. Okay? Really.", "[Knock on door]", "Vivienne: That must be her now. Sasha!", "Sasha: Aunt Vivienne!", "Vivienne: Oh, my gosh! Come in, come in! Oh! My God, look how glamorous you are!", "Sasha: Me? Look at you! All Hollywood glammed out. I can't believe it.", "Vivienne: [Laughs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: Surprised you, didn't I?", "Julius: You can say that again.", "Sasha: Hi, Mr. Avant.", "Julius: Hi, Sasha.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Sasha? Who's Sasha?", "Nicole: She's my best friend from back home.", "Maya: From what you've told me, she's more like family.", "Nicole: Well, yeah. I mean, we grew up together on the same street. Mom looked after her, her mom looked after me. I really can't remember a time that Sasha wasn't a part of my life...until recently, living here.", "Eric: You've kept in touch with her?", "Nicole: Oh, yeah, but, I mean, it's different being so far away. And...I've been a little busy. [Chuckles] Um, but social media makes it easier to keep in touch. Oh, and she is impressed with your success.", "Maya: Does Sasha know you're pregnant?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I haven't made any announcements.", "Rick: Pretty soon, you won't have to.", "Nicole: Oh. Right. [Chuckles] I mean, soon, people will be able to look at me and go, \"She's pregnant.\" [Chuckles] But, I mean, it's crazy. Sasha's here. I can't believe she just decided to come and didn't tell me.", "Rick: Maybe she wanted to surprise you.", "Nicole: Then why go to my parents first?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: It is so good to see you, Sasha.", "Sasha: You, too. I feel like it's been forever since I've seen you.", "Vivienne: Oh, no. It's just been a couple of months. [Chuckles] I know what you mean.", "Sasha: You miss the old neighborhood yet?", "Vivienne: I do, especially around thanksgiving. I mean, you know, all of our old traditions.", "Sasha: Mm-hmm. Like the pot-luck club. I mean, what is it without Vivienne's sweet-potato pie? Oh, blasphemy!", "Vivienne: [Laughing] Stop.", "Sasha: How are you, Mr. Avant? Adjusting to LA?", "Julius: Yeah, I'm doing just fine. Thank you for asking.", "Sasha: Not gonna ask me back?", "Julius: I can see with my own eyes that you appear to be doing very well.", "Sasha: Well, I'm super-excited to be here. I've always wanted to check out L.A.", "Vivienne: Oh, well, it's different. I can tell you that. But Maya and Nicole just fit right in. I mean, they have adjusted to this lifestyle. I'm still struggling a little.", "Julius: A little less all the time.", "Vivienne: Yeah, well, you can get used to anything. So, what brings you here, Sasha? Vacation?", "Sasha: Uh, you know, I'm not sure how long I can stay. But, I mean, I had some time, and there's nothing I wanted to do more than to see my second family.", "Vivienne: Oh, Nicole got so excited when I told her you were here. She's on her way over.", "Sasha: Oh, awesome! We have so much to catch up on.", "Vivienne: Oh, listen. I feel terrible. I got to go. I have a job interview with the DMV, and I don't want to be late.", "Sasha: Oh, no. Of course not. Um, I'll wait for Nic, chat up Mr. Avant.", "Vivienne: Okay. Now, promise you will not make this the first and last time I see you.", "Sasha: I promise.", "Vivienne: Okay. All right. Oh. Julius, wish me luck.", "Julius: You don't need it, baby. Because just like me, they gonna love you.", "Vivienne: [Chuckles] From your mouth to... bye.", "Sasha: Bye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: Actually, it does make sense that Sasha went to mom first. They're really close. You know how it is. Sometimes it's easier to open up to your best friend's mom than your own.", "Maya: Well, it'll be really nice having your bestie here.", "Nicole: [Chuckles] I can't wait to see Sasha. I mean, I love L.A., But I could use a little slice of home. Remember where I came from.", "Zende: Well, if you need to do that, just look in the mirror. You haven't changed.", "Nicole: Aww, you're sweet.", "Zende: You're beautiful.", "Nicole: Gosh, I so much to tell Sasha.", "Maya: When are you gonna see her?", "Nicole: I am actually headed to mom and dad's motel right now.", "Rick: Feel free to bring her around any time you want. Any friend of yours is a friend of, uh, et cetera, et cetera.", "Nicole: I will. Thank you. I wonder how long she's in town.", "Eric: Only one way to find out.", "Nicole: Right. I'm gone.", "Zende: I'll walk you out. Bye.", "Maya: Bye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Hey. Finally got you all alone.", "Nicole: Oh. Did you have something in mind?", "Zende: Maybe.", "Nicole: Oh, wow. All that just for me?", "Zende: And more.", "Nicole: More?", "Zende: Mm-hmm. You'll see what I mean tonight.", "Nicole: Do I get a hint?", "Zende: That was your hint. Also, look, I know you're anxious to see your girl. Can you make it a drive-by? You guys can catch up for real some other time. Tonight, you're all mine.", "Nicole: Deal. I can't wait for you to meet Sasha. She's gonna be so jealous. But in a good way.", "Zende: Why? Because I'm such a prize?", "Nicole: Exactly.", "Zende: I'll be waiting.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: Thank you for stopping by, Sasha. It was good to see you.", "Sasha: Oh, I'm not leaving. Nic's coming over. I have to wait for her.", "Julius: Well, when Nicole arrives, I'm gonna ask the two of you to, uh, take your reunion someplace else. I'm very busy.", "Sasha: Yeah. I can see that.", "Julius: Golf always relaxes me. Helps clear my mind for my next big challenge. I got a lot on the burner here in los Angeles.", "Sasha: [Chuckles]", "Julius: What? Why are you looking at me like that?", "Sasha: I would have given anything to see your face the first time you saw her.", "Julius: Who?", "Sasha: Maya, your long lost son, fully blossomed into a gorgeous, successful, well-connected woman. You abandoned her, and look what she accomplished anyway. Famous around the world for her modeling skills and her story. Admired. Married to a Forrester.", "Julius: Yes.", "Sasha: [Chuckles]", "Julius: I must admit -- Maya's done very well for herself.", "Sasha: Oh, is she gonna do well by you?", "Julius: [Chuckles] Wait a minute. Is that what you think I'm doing here? Hitching a ride on Maya's good fortune?", "Sasha: Well, you know, it crossed my mind.", "Julius: Well, if that were the case, then I wouldn't really be good at it, would I? I mean, this is not exactly living high on the hog in this little, small motel.", "Sasha: Could be you're just biding your time.", "Julius: You know what? You don't know what the hell you're talking about. My wife is -- well, she's too polite to say this, but I'm not. What do you want, Sasha? Why are you here?", "Sasha: [Sighs] I missed Nicole.", "Julius: Right. I know you. You want me to believe that you've come all this way because you want to hang out with your buddy?", "Sasha: That, and I want to better myself. I'm not ashamed to admit that. You know, there is nothing wrong with grabbing opportunity. I'm sure you have been hitting the links with ol' Eric Forrester.", "Julius: I am not a social climber, and Eric doesn't golf.", "Sasha: Then you'll find another way in.", "Julius: So, is that what I am to you? An in to the Forresters?", "Sasha: It's simple. I kept your secret, and now I want something in return.", "Julius: [Chuckles] I knew this was coming. I was waiting for this day. All right. What? What do you want?", "Sasha: I've been working fast food. I don't want to do that anymore.", "Julius: And what am I supposed to do for that?", "Sasha: Help me find something better. You know I'm capable of much more than \"do you want fries with that?\" Look, Maya's married to a Forrester. Nicole's involved with another. You're out here. You're all out here. I want to be out here, too, with my second family, my best friend, making a good life for myself. Introduce me to the Forresters. Open up their world to me.", "Julius: Stop dreaming.", "Sasha: Excuse me?", "Julius: No. Excuse me. You're not meeting a Forrester. What you're doing is you're going back home.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Thinking about picking up some flowers. Flowers are good, right?", "Maya: Always.", "Rick: Roses. Never go wrong with roses.", "Maya: [Chuckles]", "Zende: Cool.", "Maya: I think it's awesome that you're planning something special just for the two of you. It's important that you don't let your relationship get lost in Nicole's pregnancy, okay?", "Zende: Trying not to.", "Maya: It's hard. But you're doing everything right. You are amazing, Zende. I'm really glad my sister picked you.", "Zende: Well, I think it was the other way around. But what matters is we're together. And I'm not going to let this defeat us. I'm crazy about that girl.", "Rick: No. Really?", "Zende: [Laughs]", "Maya: Well, I think the feeling is mutual. Nicole has been so happy since she's met you.", "Zende: Yeah. I hope her friend approves. I have a feeling that Sasha's opinions carry a lot of weight.", "Maya: Man, I think it would be so cool to have a friend since childhood -- share your lives, your secrets.", "Rick: Hope we get to meet this Sasha.", "Maya: Well, of course we will. Why wouldn't we?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: I mean it, Sasha. You are not meeting the Forresters.", "Sasha: You don't get to dictate where I live, Mr. Avant. Oh, come on. Lighten up. I'm not expecting you to pay my way. I guess I don't like working fast food, but...I can do it for a little longer. It's not gonna make me rich, but...I'll survive until I can find something better.", "Julius: Nope. Not a good idea.", "Sasha: Why not? It was for Maya and Nicole, you and Viv. Why can't I be out here, too?", "Julius: You need to go back to Illinois.", "Sasha: Oh. Don't want to drag inconvenient ghosts from past into your cushy new life, Mr. Avant?", "Julius: Careful. Listen, I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I am looking for work myself.", "Sasha: After everything I've done for you, which is every single thing you've ever asked me, your help is the least I deserve. And you know, a little cash this way wouldn't hurt, either.", "Julius: Do you see how I'm living? Do I look like I've got cash to throw at you?", "Sasha: Fine. I don't need it. I'll make my own. I'm a hard worker. You know, I was named employee of the month three times this year.", "Julius: Then you need to go back and make it four. Because you can't be here. There's no place for you here.", "Sasha: I'll make a place.", "Julius: Don't make me say it again. Go home.", "Sasha: You have no right, no cause to treat me like this. You said you were coming back to stay. Well, since you're not going back, neither am I.", "Julius: Sasha, listen to me.", "Sasha: No. You listen to me! I am tired of being ignored. I e-mailed and e-mailed, and nothing. I texted. No response. Straight to voicemail every single time I've called. I mean, it's one indignity after another with you, and I've had it! I'm here. I'm staying. And you're just gonna have to deal. I will not go back to Chicago while the rest of you live it large in Hollywood.", "Julius: [Sighs]", "Sasha: Huff and puff all you want. Nothing you say is gonna change my mind.", "Julius: Fine. Fine. But our deal remains. Not one word to my family. Do you understand me? Do you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Knock on door]", "Nicole: [Gasps] There you are!", "Sasha: Nicole! Oh, I've missed you so much!", "Nicole: Dad? Are you okay?", "Julius: Yes, Nicole. I'm fine. Why would you ask?", "Nicole: I don't know. You seem...upset. What's going on, you two?"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNbsEnOnvlc"}
