{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7478 ~ Steffy makes a final decision regarding Quinn's offer; Eric demands unity within Forrester Creations and within his family."], "Recap": ["Liam whines to his dad that Steffy has to turn down that job and not let Quinn manipulate her. When Quinn finds out that Steffy turned down the job she will go after her and all hell will break loose. Quinn is doing all of this to get Steffy back with Wyatt. Wyatt points out that Eric offered him the job as head of PR and he and his mother had nothing to do with that. Eric tells Steffy that he has trust in her otherwise he would have not offered her the job to take the company for the future. He needs her answer now. After very little hesitation she says yes. She gives Eric a hug and says she is so honored. Bill says this is a big opportunity and he does not see Steffy turning down this job. Liam replies that it is not an opportunity; it is a trap. Both Eric and Quinn welcome Steffy as CEO. She turns and tells Ridge she is sorry. Pam says Steffy better be careful or she will get burned. Steffy seems to think Quinn is doing better and all will be okay. Ridge says no, she has Eric under her thumb. Liam whines on that Quinn is not the kind to sit around eating bon bons and doting on her husband. She is cooking something up and with Wyatt in the picture they all know what it is. Rick and Pam have their say that this has always been a company run by family so why Quinn and Wyatt now? Steffy says enough, as CEO she wants them all to put their feelings behind them as she needs their help and support. Rick wants to know who will be President. Eric floors them when he says Quinn will be and Ridge will stay on as designer and Rick running International and they will share a VP chair. Both feel insulted but Eric says it is not open for discussion. Quinn assures them that she had no idea he was doing this. They bicker and Eric stops it and says it was his decision and his alone. She has proved that she can deliver and he cannot believe after the great way she has taken care of him that they would doubt her. They are a dream team. He tells Steffy that she and Quinn are going to work together and he knows he is asking a lot but he knows they can do it. This meeting is adjourned. Liam grouses that he cannot get hold or hear from Steffy. But he does not believe she will take the job. Bill says he cannot believe that she will not. Liam says maybe he believes too that Quinn has changed but he does know that his brother Wyatt has. He used to doubt some of Quinn's schemes but now he accepts and benefits from them so this works in his favor. Bill reminds him after all that Steffy is still his wife so of course he would be all for this.", "Liam accuses Bill of taking sides. Bill says no, but Liam could take a little of that caution himself. The marriage is in the process of being cancelled but it is not official yet. Removing the tattoo wedding band means nothing. Eric tells Quinn that he thinks maybe Steffy is beginning to think of her as the person she used to be and can be again .and so be it if it helps Wyatt too. Quinn says it means a lot to her. The tattoo doctor comes in and Eric tells him that Steffy is out for the moment so the appointment cannot be finished today. Wyatt and Steffy talk about her great opportunity and he assures her that Quinn has turned the corner and Quinn and Eric are good for each other. They are inspiring. The cocoon has turned into a butterfly or at least a moth. He takes her hand and says the band is fading but is still not entirely gone yet. Quinn could still be her mother-in-law."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Liam: I should have seen this coming.", "Bill: Probably.", "Liam: I mean, that that woman lives for her son. Wyatt says \"I want Steffy,\" Quinn has to deliver.", "Bill: By getting her appointed CEO of Forrester. Her plan might work.", "Liam: No. No. The plan will not work. Steffy and Wyatt are over. The question is what happens when Quinn realizes that? What happens when she sees that she gave up that C.E.O. position for nothing? She's gonna go after Steffy. That's what this is why this is why Steffy has to turn down the job. She cannot let Quinn keep manipulating her.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: So, what about it, Steffy? Will you accept the position of C.E.O. of Forrester Creations?", "Steffy: If I don't?", "Eric: Quinn will continue to be interim C.E.O.", "Quinn: But we'd like not to do that, Steffy. You should be running this company, period.", "Steffy: I know you don't trust dad, but that can change. It's happened before.", "Eric: He'll continue to be head designer. You and he will be an unbeatable father-daughter team.", "[Laughing]", "Eric: And with Rick as head of international...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: All right, enough with the hard sell, let's get on with it.", "Pam: Yeah. Amen to that.", "Ridge: We all know what this is, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: This isn't dad's plan. It's Quinn's.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: It doesn't matter whose plan it is. It's a good one.", "Ridge: It is a good plan, for Quinn, because now her son is in the executive wing in his own office next to Steffy. And that's what this is all about.", "Wyatt: You are insulting everyone here. You know that, right? Especially Steffy. She has just been offered a position that she is more than capable of handling, and everyone in this room knows that. Instead, you choose to focus on these conspiracy theories that are based in no fact. Yes, Eric gave me a position in P.R., but my mother and I had nothing to do with that. And Steffy will not be manipulated. You should know that by now. Whoever she chooses to spend the rest of her life with is exactly that her choice. Not mine. Not Liam's. Not Mom's. Hers.", "Eric: So, let's get on with it. Steffy, I trust you to take this company into the future. If I had any doubt about that, I would not offer it to you at all. Now, what do you say? Do you accept the offer or not? I need an answer now.", "Steffy: Yes. Yes, I accept the position. I'm so honored, Granddad. So honored.", "Bill: Quinn's a threat to anyone who gets in her way. But Steffy turning down an opportunity like this? I don't see it.", "Liam: It's not an opportunity. It's a trap. It's a threat to her. Steffy doesn't want Wyatt. Sooner or later, Quinn is gonna realize that, and she's gonna come after her. She's gonna seek revenge like she always does. Steffy is literally in danger if she takes this job.", "Eric: Steffy, this is so wonderful. It's a very exciting time coming right now for you and for the company.", "Steffy: Yeah. Thank you for the opportunity and your trust.", "Eric: Well, this is the person you should be thanking.", "Quinn: Oh, you are gonna make history in this industry, Steffy. I am so certain of it.", "Steffy: Excuse me. Dad, I am sorry.", "Ridge: Not now, honey. Not now.", "Steffy: Isn't it better than having Quinn in charge?", "Rick: What are you talking about? She still is in charge. She orchestrated the whole thing. You think she's gonna let you run the company? Well, think again.", "Steffy: Thanks for the vote of confidence, Rick, but I'm pretty sure I can handle Quinn.", "Pam: Yeah, but see, that's the kind of talk that gives me the willies. \"Handle\" Quinn Fuller? Not without getting burned. Or worse.", "Steffy: I think granddad has her under control.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Think about it...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: No, she has your granddad under her thumb, and that is exactly where you're gonna be now, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Steffy?", "Liam: She's not responding to my texts.", "Bill: All right, maybe we just have to try to look at the positive in this. Steffy takes the job, and Quinn's out as interim C.E.O.", "Liam: And why do you think Quinn would let that happen?", "Bill: She's enjoying all the creature comforts. She has a man who is doting on her that she can completely control. I mean, she's never had any of this. Maybe, hopefully, that's all she wants.", "Liam: You know that Quinn is not the type to sit around eating bon-bons and waiting on her husband. She's cooking something up.", "Bill: Liam, Forrester is an international company with a hell of a reputation. Steffy's being handed the reins, all the prestige, the power, the control. All hers. And she's incredible. She can do the job.", "Liam: I know. I know. I agree with all of that. But the fact is, Steffy wouldn't be in this position if it weren't for Quinn, and Quinn's not doing it out of the goodness of her heart. If she has a heart. Look, she's got a plan, and with Wyatt in the picture, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what it is.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Congratulations, Mr. Executive! It looks like you and our new C.E.O. will be working in close quarters together.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Yeah, we'll see.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Okay, dad, I just got to say this. Steffy knows nothing about running this company. Ridge and I both have done it. And sluggo, the amazing mama's boy, has no business making executive decisions. What are you doing, dad? What are you doing to the company?", "Eric: I'm taking care of the company, as I always have.", "Pam: But, Eric, this has always been a family-run business. Wyatt and Quinn", "Eric: Quinn's my wife. They are family.", "Ridge: Hey, Rick. I got to correct you. Steffy is more than qualified to C.E.O. of this company. She's brilliant. She's the C.E.O. of the future. But not today. But that's not why we're her, right? We're here because you're upset with Rick and you're upset with me. You want to punish us. So, come on. The truth. This is how you want to run this company?", "Eric: This company is run on trust. It always has been. You know that. I don't trust either one of you. Steffy, anything you want to say?", "Steffy: Yes, I do, granddad. As C.E.O. of this company, I insist we put all of this behind us. I can't do my job if we are constantly arguing. Dad, I know you want me to succeed, so I'll be leaning on you. As for you, Rick... I'll always be fair and forthright, and I trust you'll do the same for me.", "Rick: I've got a question. [Clears throat] More like a suggestion, I suppose. Steffy was president. She's no longer president. I'd like to be considered. Rick for president.", "Ridge: [Laughing] Oh, great, you want to discuss this now? Today?", "Rick: I'd like to discuss it right now.", "Eric: It's not open for discussion. Ridge will stay head designer. No one, including me, is better at that. And, Rick, you will stay as head of international. Our presence in Asia and Europe has only grown since you've been there. And you will both be vice presidents of the company.", "Ridge: Wow. Vice president.", "Rick: Man, talk about insults. I ran this company in some of the best quarters it's ever seen. And so I stay vice president.", "Eric: And the head of international.", "Rick: Okay, fine, I have seen you've made up your mind. So, please, Dad, don't keep us in suspense. Who's gonna be president?", "Eric: My wife will be president of Forrester Creations.", "Rick: [Scoffs]", "Ridge: You can't be serious.", "Rick: Come on, Dad.", "Pam: Quinn Fuller, president of the company?", "Eric: Quinn Forrester.", "Ridge: This can't happen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: You said I'd be working with Quinn, but never in this capacity.", "Quinn: I had no idea, either.", "Steffy: Whose idea was it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Mine. Mine alone.", "Quinn: Eric, I I'm so honored, but are you sure?", "Eric: I'm positive. You'll be a great president of Forrester Creations.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Pam: But, Eric --", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: She has no experience.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: She makes jewelry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: All right, that's enough, all of you.", "Rick: No, this is a bad idea, Dad.", "Eric: Stop it! Stop it right now! I've heard enough. I appointed Quinn interim C.E.O. of this company, and how did that work out?", "Wyatt: A very successful fashion show, enhanced jewelry and accessory lines, and a very healthy balance sheet, if I'm not mistaken.", "Eric: That's right. Quinn has proven that she can deliver, and I know that she will deliver as president of this company, too. Especially with this dream team that's been assembled here. Either one of you doubt this? After all these months of undermining Quinn and me, how could either one of you believe that I would assign one of you as president of this company? Now, we all have a job to do. And we're all gonna do it. I believe in everybody, and I believe that we will succeed. And we will if we act as a team. This is our team. Steffy. I know this is a lot to ask, but you and Quinn are gonna work together. You have to work together. Everybody's gonna be looking at the two of you for guidance and leadership. Everybody in this company. Everybody in the industry. I know you can do it. I know I'm asking a lot, but I know you can do it. Congratulations. Congratulations, everyone. This meeting's adjourned. Come on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Mm, I should have heard from her by now.", "Bill: Liam, go get some work done. She'll call you when she's ready.", "Liam: I just I just can't see her taking this on.", "Bill: I can. In fact, I have a hard time seeing her turning it down.", "Liam: Even after what she and I have been through with Quinn?", "Bill: Yeah, your brother has convinced himself that she's changed.", "Liam: Oh, my brother you know what? Let me tell you something. My brother's the one who has changed. Her scheming used to bother him. Now he's rooting for her conniving to get him back together with his wife.", "Bill: Can you blame him?", "Liam: Dad.", "Bill: Look, Liam, I know. I know, if not for Quinn's interference, Steffy and Wyatt never would have been married, but... he loves Steffy. You can't deny that. And, technically, they're still husband and wife.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: The new digs, huh?", "Steffy: Yep. Pretty overwhelming.", "Wyatt: In a good way, I hope.", "Steffy: I'm not unhappy about it.", "Wyatt: That's a start. Pretty soon, you're gonna be bossing everybody around, ms. Boss lady.", "Steffy: [Laughs]", "Wyatt: Don't let it go to your head, all right? Look, I, uh I know ridge and Rick have been giving you some flak about this whole thing. Just you do deserve this position.", "Steffy: Do I?", "Wyatt: Of course. I mean, your grandfather believes in you. Plus, hey, when fortune follows you, you have to accept it as the way it should be. You're gonna be an awesome C.E.O., and I'm just, you know, proud of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Okay, yeah, Steffy and Wyatt are not technically divorced yet, but they never should have been married in the first place.", "Bill: Well, sometimes things happen for all the wrong reasons, and they turn out not so bad.", "Liam: Oh, whoa, hey! I thought you weren't taking sides.", "Bill: I'm not taking sides. I'm just being realistic, Liam, and you might want to use a dose of that yourself.", "Liam: The reality is that Steffy and I would have been married a long time ago if it weren't for Quinn messing with us.", "Bill: For which she will someday pay a price.", "Liam: [Laughs] When and how? I don't want to know.", "Bill: I am I am sick of that woman interfering in my sons' lives.", "Liam: Yeah, well, Wyatt seems to be enjoying it at the moment.", "Bill: Only at the moment. Like you, your brother knows the downside of Quinn's machinations. He doesn't want her interfering in his love life.", "Liam: His love life with Steffy is over.", "Bill: Maybe.", "Liam: What do you mean, maybe? Dad, their divorce is in process right now.", "Bill: There's a difference between \"in process\" and finalized, Liam.", "Liam: Yes, but you know she's getting the wedding tattoo removed, right?", "Bill: The wedding band, yes.", "Liam: So, if she's willing to go through the hassle and the pain of getting that thing taken off her skin, I would say it's likely she's over Wyatt.", "Bill: Quinn doesn't see it.", "Liam: Yes. Yes, as long as Steffy and Wyatt are even in close proximity, Quinn will continue to play matchmaker.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I can't believe you just made me president of Forrester creations.", "Eric: That's right. And not interim president, either.", "Quinn: [Laughs]", "Eric: The position is yours as long as you want it.", "Quinn: Oh, Eric. [Sighs]", "Eric: Look, I know you wanted to spend more time at home, but the company needs you.", "Quinn: Okay. I will accept this position, but only on one condition that I continue to see an improvement in your health.", "Eric: You think that every day when you leave to go to the office, I'm gonna order out for hamburgers and fries?", "Quinn: No. No.", "Eric: That's a really good idea.", "Quinn: Eric Forrester...", "Eric: I'm just kidding!", "Quinn: [Laughs] Thank you.", "Eric: I'm gonna stay on a healthy diet. How else am I gonna keep up with you?", "Quinn: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.", "Quinn: No, I did it for the company. And for you.", "Quinn: Mm.", "Eric: Okay. For Wyatt, for Steffy.", "Quinn: Yeah. Maybe this is the beginning of a whole new era.", "Eric: I think maybe it is.", "Quinn: Yeah.", "Eric: I saw signs of it in Steffy's eyes today, very subtly, but I think she's just beginning to see you as the person you really are.", "Quinn: Instead of who I used to be?", "Eric: Yeah.", "Quinn: Oh, Eric, I want that. I want that so badly. [Sighs] I want to be a force for peace in this family, not the opposite. You've given me so much. I want to give that back to you. And if Steffy and Wyatt find their way back to each other, well, then, so be it.", "Eric: It means so much to you, doesn't it?", "Quinn: Seeing as how I'm the reason that their marriage broke up in the first place, yeah. It means a lot to me.", "[Knocking on door]", "Eric: Yes? Excuse me. I have an appointment with Steffy Forrester.", "Eric: Yes, you're her tattoo removal doctor, is that right?", "Quinn: Oh, Steffy, she's", "Eric: Uh, she's occupied right now. She's not gonna be able to do it today, sorry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: [Laughs]", "Steffy: [Laughs]", "Wyatt: Looks good.", "Steffy: It's unreal.", "Wyatt: You've earned it.", "Steffy: Yeah, so has my dad and Rick.", "Wyatt: Hey, you are what this company needs right now. You're the brand, Steffy. Beauty, elegance, your youthful energy. Forrester's gonna thrive under you.", "Steffy: I can think about one person who's not thrilled about it.", "Wyatt: Who, Liam?", "Steffy: He's worried about your mom. Frankly, so am I.", "Wyatt: Yeah, but less and less with each passing day, am I right? She has turned a corner, Steff. Look, I know you're skeptical of the lady and her motives, but, trust me, no one is more skeptical than I am. But living with those two they're...cute together. They're fun. They're truly good for each other, and, I don't know, I kind of like being around them. In a way, they're inspiring. Can you imagine that?", "Steffy: It wasn't that long ago, and the thought of Quinn being my mother-in- law really", "Wyatt: Scared you to death. I know. The thought of her being my mom scares me to death. Look, the caterpillar turned into a butterfly. Or at least a half- decent moth.", "Steffy: She won't be my mother-in-law much longer.", "Wyatt: Let me see. It's fading. It's not gone. My mom has changed, Steffy, and so have you. She still could be your mother-in-law."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExJSMiZq1fI"}
