        "Nicole feels a little tension but Julius denies that anything is wrong. Nicole shocks Sasha when she says she is pregnant. Nicole says it is a long story and no one outside the family knows yet. She is going to be a surrogate. Carter sees Zende take out all his frustrations about Nicole on the workout equipment. Wyatt wants to take care of Ivy and makes his place comfortable for her. She's back home and okay. She says yes as long as Steffy stays far far away. She is so dangerous and no telling what she might do. Wyatt does not want to go but says he will go to work just long enough to see that Steffy has moved out and then be right back. Steffy is still explaining to Liam that it was an accident and she needs him to believe her. He reminds her that the restraining order says she can not work here anymore. She says she knows but she is not going to be kicked out of her family's company. No judge will go along with that. She is not leaving this building. Ivy will not force her out! He says she does not have to like it but he also does not want her to get into more trouble. Steffy says it was not intentional that she pushed Ivy and she wishes she could talk to her and have her forgive her. Maybe Liam can talk to Wyatt and get thru to him.",
        "Nicole explains her carrying the baby for Rick and Maya. Sasha says that is awfully big of Nicole. Julius tries to rush Nicole back to work but Nicole invites Sasha along. Alone Julius tells Sasha not to get any ideas. She can stay here two or three days and then he wants her gone. Sasha is very impressed with FC but enough with the weather; she is excited to be there with Liam and Wyatt. And she wants to hear more about this boyfriend. Nicole needs to get something to Rick and leaves long enough for Sasha to glance around and spots a gorgeous dress she wants to wear. She hops behind the dressing panel and is changing when Zende walks in, assumes it is Nicole and peeks behind, both not knowing who each other is. Liam tells Wyatt that it must be good news to have Ivy come home today. Wyatt says yes they are lucky that she is even alive. He is sorry about the whole restraining order but Ivy did not want to take a chance and the only way she will be comfortable around Steffy. Liam says it was an accident and there must be a better way. He pleads with Wyatt to talk to her and get her to drop it. Wyatt says she is totally afraid of Steffy regardless of accident or not. Liam laments that Steffy does not need to suffer. Ask Ivy to reconsider. Steffy drops by Wyatt's. Ivy drags herself to the door but sees Steffy and says she is not supposed to be here. Steffy says she is here for one thing only. They are family and need to get along. Ivy turns to leave and Steffy barrels past her. She tells Ivy that she needs to tear up this restraining order. The next thing she knows Ivy has fallen and her head hit on the fireplace."

        "Nicole: Is there something going on here? It's kind of tense.",
        "Julius: No. Everything's just fine.",
        "Sasha: Look, are you gonna give me another hug or are you doing air kisses these days, Miss Beverly Hills?",
        "Nicole: Uh, shut up. Come here. Oh, I'm so happy to see you. I can't believe you're here.",
        "Sasha: Well, I had to make sure LA wasn't changing you too much. No, I see you're still the same cute, little thing.",
        "Nicole: Well, you say that now. Talk to me in a few months.",
        "Sasha: Why?",
        "Nicole: Oh, good, you didn't tell her.",
        "Sasha: Tell me what?",
        "Nicole: I'm pregnant.",

        "Carter: [Grunting] How many reps is that?",
        "Zende: Not enough.",
        "Carter: You keep that up, you're gonna be jacked.",
        "Zende: [Grunts] Isn't that the point?",
        "Carter: Usually, but for you, it's more about getting out all of that tension, releasing that frustration.",
        "Zende: You think you know so much.",
        "Carter: Tell me I'm not right.",
        "Zende: Whatever, man.",
        "Carter: Yeah, \"Whatever, man.\" [Chuckles] Look, I get it. This pregnancy complicates things, and you and Nicole haven't had the chance to be as close as you want to be. And that can't be easy for either of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Careful.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Careful. Are you okay?",

        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Ivy: Thank you, Dr. Spencer.",
        "Wyatt: Of course. Here's some pillows. We got some blankets here. Sit down. Let me -- let me take care of you. You just got out of the hospital.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] You've been so good to me.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Been with me every step of the way.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I just wish you didn't have to be going through this right now.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, me, too. [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: But you're here.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: You're back home.",
        "Ivy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: And you are gonna be okay.",
        "Ivy: I think I will be okay.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: As long as Steffy stays far, far away from me.",

        "Steffy: I don't want to.",
        "Liam: Hey, hey! Ivy's restraining order says you can't work here. Well...",
        "Steffy: I-I know what it says. I have the paperwork right here. But I'm not leaving. No, I'm not being kicked out of my family's company, Liam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] God, it's really starting to sink in how bad this could have actually been.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, someone's watching over you, that's for sure.",
        "Ivy: You know, if there's trouble in this town, just look right for Steffy, because that's where she'll be.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Do you know how lucky I got, Wyatt? I mean, that girl is so dangerous. Who knows what she's capable of doing next. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: As of right now, it's temporary, but, you know, Ivy could get it extended up to a year or more.",
        "Steffy: It's baseless, Liam! No judge in their right mind would grant an extension. No judge.",
        "Liam: You -- you don't know that, Steffy. All we can do right now is follow protocol, so let's just pack your stuff.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Fine. Fine. Fine. I will pack up all my stuff and I will put it in the closet, because I am not removing it from the building, including myself.",
        "Liam: Oh, Steffy --",
        "Steffy: I am not moving out of here! Ivy is not forcing me out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Look, there's no right or wrong way to handle this, okay? Just -- just go with how you feel.",
        "Zende: That changes one minute to the next. Just when I think I can deal with the situation, Nicole gets sick or she cancels on me.",
        "Carter: No one twisted your arm. You made a decision to be with her. That means you have to be supportive and understanding.",
        "Zende: I'm trying. Believe me, I am. I'm doing my best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: Wait. For real? You're pregnant? Like, with an actual baby pregnant?",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm. Crazy, right? [Chuckles] I'm not that far along, but no press. No one outside of the family knows.",
        "Sasha: [Sighs] Well, damn. It looks like you're gonna have a grandbaby, Mr. Avant. Congratulations.",
        "Nicole: It's a long story, but it's for my sister. I agreed to be her surrogate.",
        "Sasha: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: [Groans] I just -- I can't get comfortable.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] You've been so good to me. Just hanging out, making sure I'm okay. I know you probably need to get to work.",
        "Wyatt: What? And miss out on the ice cream and the movie marathons and the muffins? No. Unh-unh. No way. I'm staying here with my lady.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Ivy: You can go to work, okay? It's -- it's not gonna hurt me being alone here for a few hours by myself. Plus I need you to go into work and make sure Steffy's moving all of her stuff out, 'cause I can't go back to work until that's happened.",
        "Wyatt: Right. I get it. I mean, what happened to you was beyond traumatic. I mean, I can't even imagine what you feel.",
        "Ivy: It's gonna take some time to heal, okay? I have a lot to process at the moment. But the sooner I can get back to work, the better.",
        "Wyatt: You're the strongest person I know.",
        "Ivy: Aww.",
        "Wyatt: So you'll be back at it sooner than you think.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I hope so.",
        "Wyatt: All right. Well, let me know if you need anything. If you run out of food or if you can't work the TV or you need a foot massage. I will drive back here so fast.",
        "Ivy: Deal. Save you some ice cream.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you better.",

        "Ivy: Oh, God.",

        "Liam: Hey. I know you don't want to leave. You're president of the company. You're doing a fantastic job, and everybody loves you. I get that. But it's not up to us. This -- hey. This is a serious legal situation. We don't have a choice. We have to comply with the order.",
        "Steffy: And I realize that, Liam. But it doesn't mean I have to like it.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] I'm not asking you to like it. I'm asking you not to get yourself in more trouble.",
        "Steffy: I wish there was a way to get through to Ivy. I wish I could just get her to listen to me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. You tried that several times at the hospital. She still wants you gone.",
        "Steffy: What happened was a freak accident. I didn't want Ivy to get hurt. I tried to avoid the situation. I tried to stay away from her, but she grabbed my phone, she threw it. And then she grabbed me and she wouldn't let go, so I reacted. I reacted and I pushed her, and I know I shouldn't have done it. It wasn't intentional.",
        "Liam: Look who you're talking to. I know that.",
        "Steffy: I-I know. I just wish I could make her understand. I wish she could forgive me. I wish we could -- we could figure that out.",
        "Liam: I don't think there's anything more you can do at this point.",
        "Steffy: Maybe you can -- maybe you can talk to Wyatt. Maybe you can get through to him, please?",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: Please?",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Fine. I'll talk to him. I will. No guarantee he's gonna listen.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Liam: But I will -- I will try. I will try. Where you going? What are you doing?",
        "Steffy: I got to run, baby.",
        "Liam: We have to -- we have to pack your -- where's -- hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zende: I admire Nicole for what she's doing. You know that. She's carrying a baby for someone else. That takes an immense amount of courage and generosity. But on the flip side, I'm human.",
        "Carter: Well, you have plans with her tonight, right?",
        "Zende: Yeah.",
        "Carter: Okay, then.",
        "Zende: Why do you think I'm working out so hard for, brah? [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole: Obviously Maya can't have kids of her own, which is why she and Rick asked me to be their surrogate so that Maya could have a biological connection to the child.",
        "Sasha: Wow. That is pretty big of you. I can't say I could do that for a sister.",
        "Nicole: If you saw how excited Maya was about having a baby, you'd understand.",
        "Sasha: So, you're staying put here in La-La land?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, I mean, what can I say? L.A. is home now. My family's here, I've got a great job at Forrester Creations, an amazing boyfriend that you will have to meet.",
        "Sasha: Ooh, la, la!",
        "Nicole: But not tonight. We have a date.",
        "Sasha: Oh, excuse me!",
        "Nicole: [Laughs]",
        "Sasha: Excuse me. Sorry.",
        "Julius: Uh, Nicole, don't you have to be getting back to work?",
        "Nicole: Yes, Dad. Hey. You want to come? I mean, you could see what Forrester Creations is all about.",
        "Sasha: Seriously?",
        "Nicole: Yeah.",
        "Sasha: Yeah! I'd love to!",
        "Nicole: Okay, well, um, just give me a minute and then we'll go.",
        "Sasha: Okay.",
        "Nicole: All right.",
        "Sasha: Okay. Great. [Laughs]",
        "Julius: Listen, don't get any ideas when you're touring Forrester, okay? Sasha, you're a grown woman. Live your own life, all right? I don't want you leeching off of us. Now, you got two, three days tops. Then I want you on the first thing smoking back to Chicago.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivienne: Hmm. You still putting on that thing?",
        "Julius: Yeah. How'd the interview go?",
        "Vivienne: I think it went all right. I mean, I hope it went all right.",
        "Julius: I'm sure it was fine, babe.",
        "Vivienne: Oh, well, we'll know in a few days. Yeah, let's knock on wood, cross our fingers, and say a prayer. We could use the income, Julius. Maybe find a decent place we can live in. Where's Sasha?",
        "Julius: Nicole came by. Took her to Forrester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: Yo, this place is crazy.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] It's not that bad.",
        "Sasha: \"Not that bad\"?",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "Sasha: Sure beats that fast-food joint I got going on.",
        "Nicole: Hey, that helps you pay for them college classes.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're trying to better ourselves. Okay, so whose office is this?",
        "Nicole: Oh, a bunch of people share it, like Quinn, Ivy, Liam, and Wyatt.",
        "Sasha: Liam and Wyatt? Spencer?",
        "Nicole: Yep.",
        "Sasha: Oh, my God, girl! They are so hot!",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "Sasha: Oh, God, I see them in all the magazines.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, they're pretty nice, too.",
        "Sasha: [Sighs] Everyone here is so beautiful! And the sunshine and the palm trees. Is every day like this?",
        "Nicole: Well, you know, I've heard rumors that it rains sometimes, but since I've been here, I have not seen a drop. [Chuckles] But I hear it does happen.",
        "Sasha: Well, enough about the gorgeous California weather. I want to hear all about this boyfriend.",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carter: Don't use all your energy. You don't want to ruin your date tonight. [Chuckles]",
        "Zende: Ha ha. Very funny.",
        "Carter: Look, man, I don't see what the problem is. If you and Nicole are on the same page, then take it to the next level.",
        "Zende: I'm looking forward to tonight. Just focusing on us, me and Nicole, not talking about the baby, not talking about Rick and Maya, not talking about nine months from now --",
        "Carter: Not talking about anything at all.",
        "Zende: Exactly. Living in the moment for once. And I think Nicole wants the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Hey.",
        "Liam: Yo. I was, uh, just about to text you. I didn't think you were coming in. How's Ivy?",
        "Wyatt: Getting better every day. I got to, uh, take her home from the hospital this morning.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I heard that. I heard she was released. That's -- that's good news. You must be relieved.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I mean, it's good for all of us. This could have turned out a whole lot worse than it did.",
        "Liam: We are -- we're lucky she's okay.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, we're lucky she's even alive, you know? [Chuckles] Look, um... I-I just wanted to say I'm sorry about the whole restraining order thing. It wasn't easy for Ivy to do. It's just -- it's the only thing that's gonna make her feel safe.",
        "Liam: Steffy's not gonna do anything, Wyatt. You know that.",
        "Wyatt: I know! It just -- Ivy doesn't want to take a chance. She's not comfortable being around Steffy. That's all.",
        "Liam: Look, I-I can't imagine what Ivy went through, and I can kind of understand why she might feel like forcing Steffy out is the only option, but it's not the only option. There's got to be a better way to do this that doesn't just punish Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: What? She's not punishing her.",
        "Liam: Wyatt! It was an accident! Steffy didn't mean to hurt Ivy! You know that. I know you know that. So, can I just -- brother to brother, can I just ask you please talk to Ivy? Try to -- try to get her to drop the restraining order?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ivy: [Groans] [Sighs] Steffy, no. Steffy, you have to be at least 100 yards away from me!",
        "Steffy: I'm only here for one thing. Please. Please can you just rip this up? Can we just put this behind us? We're family. We need to get along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sasha: Your boyfriend is a rich and famous Forrester.",
        "Nicole: He's more than that. He's pretty special.",
        "Sasha: And he's down with this whole surrogacy thing, you being pregnant?",
        "Nicole: He's been really supportive. Makes me love him even more.",
        "Sasha: Ooh. Using the \"l\" word. Look at you, Nic. Well, no, good for you. I'm happy you found yourself a keeper.",
        "Nicole: Thank you. I think you'll like him.",
        "Sasha: Whoa. What is that?",
        "Nicole: Oh. It's Couture.",
        "Sasha: Whose is it?",
        "Nicole: Um...",

        "Nicole: [Chuckles]",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Sasha: Oh! Wonder what it'd be like to wear something like that.",
        "Nicole: Oh, shoot, I forgot to get these samples down to Rick. Um, you just wait here and I'll be right back.",
        "Sasha: Oh, okay.",
        "Nicole: Okay.",

        "Vivienne: I always liked Sasha. She is such a lovely girl.",
        "Julius: Hey, um, are you gonna be hungry soon? Haven't had lunch yet.",
        "Vivienne: I am really glad that she came out to California. I hope she stays awhile.",
        "Julius: Nope. She's gonna be leaving. And soon.",

        "Sasha: So pretty. I can't. Oh, yes, I can. Okay [Squeals]",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: You can't put me in this position, bro.",
        "Liam: Hey, it's totally Ivy's right to be concerned. She can be -- she can be angry with Steffy. But come on. She has to know it was an accident.",
        "Wyatt: But she doesn't see it that way, Liam!",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Not after what happened with Aly and now this. She's genuinely terrified of your fianc\u00e9e!",
        "Liam: How is she -- are we in the twilight zone? Has everyone forgotten what actually happened? Ivy was the one who went and attacked Steffy next to a live electric panel! Who should be terrified of whom here?",
        "Wyatt: Steffy pushed her!",
        "Liam: In response she pushed her! Wyatt, Wyatt, Steffy loves this job. She loves her family. We -- there's got to be a way to do this that doesn't make her suffer unnecessarily. Can you just -- can -- can you do me a favor? Can you ask Ivy to reconsider?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Steffy, you can't -- you can't be here right now. You have to get out of here.",
        "Steffy: Ivy, I am sorry about what you've been through. I really am. I'm so sorry.",
        "Ivy: You need to leave, Steffy! You can't be in this house right now!",
        "Steffy: Can you just give me a minute, please?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: It was a terrible experience. I know that. And you almost died. I-I wish it never happened, and I'm sorry.",
        "Ivy: I don't want to hear this.",
        "Steffy: I can say I'm sorry. Ivy --",
        "Ivy: I don't want to hear this! I don't want to talk to you!",
        "Steffy: It was an accident! You have to believe me! My life is in your hands. You need -- you need to tear up this restraining order.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, you have to leave.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. Ivy, can we just sit --",
        "Steffy: You have to leave, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: We can talk about this. Please. All I want to do is talk about --",

        "Steffy: [Gasps] Ivy! Oh, my god! Ivy. Ivy. Oh. Ivy! Ivy! Ivy, wake up! Ivy! [Whimpers, gasps] Ivy!"
