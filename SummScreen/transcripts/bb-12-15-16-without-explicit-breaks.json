        "Liam barges in to see Steffy while Wyatt is there. Wyatt states that he will go out until the tide comes in. Liam knows what Steffy is going to say. Meanwhile Eric pays the tattoo doctor for wasting his time as Steffy cannot make it today. Rick bends Nicole's ear as he does not want to go home and get Maya riled up. He cannot blame Steffy but he does not like being passed over as CEO and she cannot see that Quinn is using her. Steffy asks if Liam is not going to congratulate her. She states that if she turned it down her granddad would let Quinn stay on so it still would not have been Ridge or Rick to get the CEO job. Liam only wants to know why Wyatt is there and involved. At home Quinn gets Eric settled and says he was quite the showman today. Eric replies that her son was quite the showman too. He likes him around. He trusts him and he is quite like his mother, the Madam President. She does not know where that came from but thanks him. Liam keeps on with Steffy. She tells him that her grandfather named Wyatt as head of Publicity. Liam laughs, sure that sounds about right as he loves to take pictures of Steffy and get on social media. She admits there might be some of that but where she lays her head at night is not in her job description so Liam need not blame Eric and Quinn. And Wyatt certainly did not ask for the job so he need not treat him this way either. Wyatt asks Nicole to be part of his team with social media and she is honored although Rick thinks Wyatt is throwing his weight around. Steffy asks Liam to stop asking her about this. Every male family member wanted this job and she was handpicked by Eric and it means a lot to her. Liam about crashes when he hears that Quinn is President. She and Steffy will be working closely together. She shows him her ring finger and says the fading tattoo is taking longer than she thought.",
        "Eric tells Quinn he might have made a mistake by sending the doctor away today as he is sure Steffy will hear and ask him about it. Wyatt tells Steffy that he is happy for her. He just wonders if Liam is. Steffy says he will come around. Eric tells Quinn that no one forced Steffy to marry Wyatt but they all want to blame he and Quinn for the failure of Wyatt's marriage to Steffy. She says Wyatt is over that now and she thinks Steffy will be soon too. When Quinn goes to the kitchen, Eric has to answer the door and it is Liam. Eric tells him this is not a good time but Liam puts his hand out and won't allow Eric to close the door. He charges on in and starts in on him for being brainwashed by Quinn. Says he has been there too. She was his wife as Eve first so he knows firsthand what she is capable of. Eric needs to remember his past and who he is and not let Quinn get her claws in him further. Quinn hears the loud noise and comes in. Liam accuses her too and warns Eric again. Eric says that is enough. This is his house and Liam cannot bully his way in. He tells Liam that he is happy and he is sorry that Liam is not capable of being happy and he cannot imagine wanting his granddaughter to be part of that."

        "Wyatt: Fading. It's not gone.",
        "Steffy: The doctor says it's gonna take some time.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. [Clears throat] Well, in the future, when all the gold mines are tapped out, I believe wedding rings are gonna be more, like, holographic.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] How is that even gonna work?",
        "Wyatt: Well, Madame C.E.O., jewelry will be more futuristic. It'll be made using lasers, kind of in a different process than the way you're using them right now.",
        "Steffy: [Groans] All I know is that it hurts.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Me, too. But in the future, wedding rings are gonna be more like mood rings. You know, when you're sad or you're upset or unsure, they'll fade. And when you're in love and you can't imagine being with anyone else, they'll glow. So the whole world could see it.",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Liam: I guess the meeting's over.",
        "Steffy: Uh, yeah, so is my work day -- almost.",
        "Liam: Heard you were here for it, too.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, uh... I'll go alphabetize something.",
        "Liam: So, how'd it go?",
        "Steffy: Welcome to my new office.",
        "Liam: You said yes.",
        "Doctor: Are you sure? Steffy was very specific about meeting her here.",
        "Eric: I'm sorry, Doctor. The day just seems to have gotten away from her.",
        "Doctor: She only needs a few more sessions before that ring tattoo is gone completely.",
        "Quinn: Well, a little more time won't hurt anything, will it?",
        "Eric: Look, Doctor, let me pay you for your time and trouble today. I'm sorry. Let me just, uh, make it worth your while. I'm sorry. Here. Thank you very much.",
        "Nicole: So, it's a done deal?",
        "Rick: For today. Who knows? Maybe next, my dad will turn this building into a Quinn museum. We'll have Quinn jewelry, we'll have Quinn clothing, yummy Quinn recipes, maybe even little Quinn baby pictures.",
        "Nicole: Oh, well, yeah, I guess Quinn probably was a baby once.",
        "Rick: Eh. Thanks for letting me blow off some steam. There's no use in going home and getting Maya all riled up.",
        "Nicole: You still have international, though, right?",
        "Rick: Right.",
        "Nicole: And now you're vice president.",
        "Rick: Co. It's like one step up from an intern.",
        "Nicole: Mm. So, I still have to get your coffee.",
        "Rick: You know, some things never change.",
        "Nicole: Mm.",
        "Rick: Look, you know, I can't blame Steffy, though. She's smart, she's tough, and unlike her father, she actually listens to people. So what she lacks in experience, she'll make up for asking the right questions. What she doesn't see is that Quinn is using her.",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Nicole: Okay, it is not nice to take pictures of people without their permission.",
        "Wyatt: Right. I know. I'm just -- [Scoffs] I'm taking photos of all the beautiful women at Forrester creations for all our social media websites.",
        "Nicole: Yes, and I help you do that. Behind the scenes, not as one of the models.",
        "Wyatt: You're gonna be helping me a lot more, too. Did, uh, Rick here tell you that I'm now the head of P.R.?",
        "Rick: Yeah, because of your mother.",
        "Wyatt: Um, and your father. Maybe I should call Steffy while I'm here, book her a make-up appointment.",
        "Eric: I'm sure she'll be in touch. Here we are. Thank you.",
        "Quinn: Eric.",
        "Eric: Look, if it was important to Steffy, she wouldn't have forgotten.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Your first day back was a long one.",
        "Eric: Yeah. I may be starting to feel it.",
        "Quinn: Let's get you home. Come on.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: So you're not gonna congratulate me? [Sighs] Liam, I couldn't turn it down. It was that simple.",
        "Liam: And you -- and you say that because...?",
        "Steffy: Because there's no way that my grandfather was gonna give the position to Rick or my dad, and if I turned it down, then Quinn would stay on as C.E.O.",
        "Liam: And Wyatt was at the meeting, too.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Can you tell me why that is?",
        "Nicole: So Quinn is your boss?",
        "Rick: As much as it pains me to say, yes.",
        "Nicole: And Steffy is her boss.",
        "Wyatt: That's right.",
        "Rick: It might seem confusing, but it really isn't. This whole new, uh, hierarchy -- I mean, Wyatt might not agree -- it's all been created because of his mother.",
        "Wyatt: We were both in the same meeting. You heard Eric.",
        "Rick: Now, whether or not my dad says that he's making these decisions, we don't know the conversations that's going on between Quinn and my father behind closed doors.",
        "Eric: All right. Home again.",
        "Quinn: Yep.",
        "Eric: My feet are tired. My head is clear.",
        "Quinn: Why don't you come sit and relax?",
        "Eric: Okay.",
        "Quinn: You were quite the showman today.",
        "Eric: Was I?",
        "Quinn: Ooh! You love the \"ta-da!\" You know? When you unveil your little surprises. Making Wyatt head of publicity?",
        "Eric: Yeah. Oh, he's the showman. I mean, come on. The job is a perfect fit for him. Besides, I like having him around.",
        "Quinn: Aww.",
        "Eric: You've raised a very, uh, a very loving and loyal person there. Very much the same as his mother, Madame president.",
        "Quinn: And where did that come from?",
        "Eric: I have confidence in you.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You sure you don't want to just keep tabs on me the other 12 hours of the day?",
        "Eric: No, that's not it. That's not it at all. It was just seeing how outraged Rick and ridge were when I promoted my granddaughter over them, I just thought it would be good for them to be outraged a little bit more.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs]",
        "Eric: I love my sons, but humility is not their strong suit. Look, you don't even have to go in, really. It's not like they need supervision. It's just that, when you do, I want you have some authority. And I want to hear right away if there's any disrespect there at all.",
        "Quinn: No, I've given up expecting respect a long time ago. I just hope Steffy will work with me.",
        "Eric: I don't think I've given her much choice.",
        "Steffy: My grandfather and Wyatt, they've bonded. Wyatt's living at the house now.",
        "Liam: Yeah, okay, that much I knew.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it's like they have this little insta-family that my grandfather created. He calls Wyatt \"son.\" Because he feels betrayed by his Forrester sons.",
        "Liam: So, why -- why doesn't Eric feel betrayed by you?",
        "Steffy: He does and he doesn't. I mean, I've been relentless about wanting Quinn out of his life, but I've never been underhanded about it. He knows I have good reason.",
        "Liam: Yeah, namely the marriage she tricked you into and the future she tried to steal from us, right? And she's still trying, apparently. Otherwise, why would Wyatt be invited to your anointing as C.E.O. and not...me?",
        "Steffy: There were changes with the executive team. My grandfather asked Wyatt... ...to be the head of P.R.",
        "Liam: Right. Right.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Liam: Right. Right. Of course. Why not, right? Because there's nothing Wyatt loves more in this world than posting photos of you.",
        "Steffy: Okay, yeah, there will probably be some of that.",
        "Liam: I can't believe this. I mean, it's really not just Quinn. Eric wants you reunited with my brother, too. Unbelievable.",
        "Steffy: He has never said that! They can want what they want. But where I lay my head down at night -- that's not part of the job description.",
        "Liam: Well, maybe the message being sent is intended for me.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I'm starting the new social media blitz for Steffy, so any suggestions would be appreciated.",
        "Rick: Oh, I see how this is gonna go down. Nicole does all the work, and you take all the credit.",
        "Nicole: No, Wyatt has taught me a lot, and I'm honored to be part of his team.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Rick: Right. I'll leave you two to \"strategize,\" then.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, before you go, Rick... you know, when you start hearing the rumors, or spreading them, just remember, Quinn was a good interim C.E.O., and she's gonna be a damn good president, too.",
        "Rick: While my dad gets more and more isolated.",
        "Wyatt: When have you seen Eric happier than he is right now?",
        "Rick: Before any of us ever laid eyes on the two of you. Just have to say.",
        "Wyatt: All right. Okay.",
        "Quinn: Is anything permanent these days?",
        "Eric: Uh, death seems to be.",
        "Quinn: Well, not if you believe in reincarnation. You know, I had a psychic once tell me that I was Mata Hari in a past life.",
        "Eric: Really?",
        "Quinn: [Laughing] Really.",
        "Eric: That's very interesting.",
        "Quinn: Yes.",
        "Eric: No, I've never been a big believer in a, uh, in a past you have no recollection of. I mean, what is life except which you remember?",
        "Quinn: Well, ink isn't permanent, otherwise Steffy couldn't have hers lasered off.",
        "Eric: Mm.",
        "Quinn: Hey. Why did you send that doctor away today?",
        "Eric: I'm not sure. You think it was a mistake? It might have been. And when Steffy finds out about it, she's gonna ask me exactly the same thing.",
        "Quinn: What are you gonna tell her?",
        "Steffy: Liam, don't make this about us. Can you just stop and think for a minute what this means to me personally? Every male member of my family would have to die before I would ever get a chance to run Forrester creations.",
        "Liam: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [Laughs] In my mind, you are the most capable person on the planet, and when other people say so, it just doesn't surprise me the way that it does you.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, I shouldn't make rules about how you should react. It's just a really big deal for me.",
        "Liam: So, tell me more. I mean, what else happened? How did your dad and Rick react?",
        "Steffy: It was hard for my dad. He didn't say anything mean. It's just really humiliating for them.",
        "Liam: But they -- they didn't get fired?",
        "Steffy: No, Dad's still head designer, Rick has International.",
        "Liam: Wait a second. Who's president?",
        "Steffy: Quinn.",
        "Liam: No!",
        "Steffy: No, I know, I know. But I'm gonna be able to take care of her. I can handle it. I can handle it.",
        "Liam: How many times has Wyatt made you that exact same promise?",
        "Steffy: Can we not talk about this? Can we do it at home? We're just going around in circles.",
        "Liam: All right. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.",
        "Steffy: [Groans]",
        "Liam: I just -- I actually just came by for your laser removal appointment, maybe hold your hand.",
        "Steffy: Oh.",
        "Liam: Am I too late? Did I miss it?",
        "Steffy: No, he never showed.",
        "Liam: Oh. It's hanging on, isn't it?",
        "Steffy: It's taking longer to get removed than it ever did inking it.",
        "Eric: Where's Steffy? I can't find Steffy! Steffy! Oh, no! I can't find her! Her parents are gonna kill me!",
        "Steffy: I'm right here, grandpa.",
        "Eric: Oh, there you are! What are you doing under the desk? What are you doing there? Where are my marbles? Do you have my marbles?",
        "Steffy: Yes.",
        "Eric: Where are they? Under there? Those are my marbles! They're not yours!",
        "Steffy: [Laughing] No, these are my marbles.",
        "Eric: Give me the marbles. Give me the marbles.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Steffy: Uh, it's open! Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Give anybody any orders yet?",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] Yeah. Almost. I buzzed pam. You know how she answers the phone?",
        "Wyatt: No. How?",
        "Pam: \"I'm busy, what do you want?\"",
        "Wyatt: What did you say to that?",
        "Steffy: I told her I hit the wrong button.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: Uh, this is huge for you, huh?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: I'm -- I'm happy for you. Was my brother?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, he will be. He just -- he wants what's best for me.",
        "Wyatt: He just doesn't think this is. You're still my boss, you know.",
        "Steffy: What should I order you to do?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. Striptease? I could do -- if you --",
        "Steffy: Eh, I've seen it. I've seen it.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Already did that.",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: You want me to work on the social media announcement for your new title?",
        "Steffy: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Steffy: But I need you to make me look very adult.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Steffy: No Santa Claus, no tinsel, just, you know, maybe dark and grown-up.",
        "Wyatt: But you always wear dark.",
        "Steffy: Sexless.",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] Okay, I don't think that's possible. I'm gonna -- I'm gonna stop sucking up to my boss right now.",
        "Eric: That tattoo ring of Steffy's is close to being gone anyway, you know?",
        "Quinn: Not as close as it would have been if she had her laser session today.",
        "Eric: No, I admit that. You know, your son and my granddaughter blame our marriage for the failure of theirs.",
        "Quinn: I think Wyatt is past that now.",
        "Eric: I think Steffy might be, too. She's making some progress in that area. I mean, she's -- as time goes by, I think she's gonna realize that nobody forced her to marry Wyatt, or to leave him, either. And, in time, she's gonna remember why she married him. You know, every marriage is not meant to last, but I think it should be a little more difficult than a simple cosmetic surgery to end it.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: What?",
        "Quinn: Nothing. I've just -- I've been all alone in trying to support Wyatt and fighting for his marriage, and... now I'm not anymore. I need to start thinking about dinner. Come on.",
        "Eric: All right.",
        "Quinn: What do you think about lamb chops?",
        "Eric: Lamb chops.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric: The perfect excuse to uncork a perfect ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-pape.",
        "Quinn: Ooh!",
        "Eric: I'll get it.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Eric: Liam. Hello.",
        "Liam: It's good to see you looking well.",
        "Eric: Look, forgive me, this is not a good time. I've had a very, very long day.",
        "Liam: So I hear.",
        "Eric: What is it, Liam? Did Steffy tell you about her new position at Forrester?",
        "Liam: She did. Your old position. Yes. She did.",
        "Eric: Well, I trust that you were proud and happy for her.",
        "Liam: I wish I could be. More than anything, I wish I could be. And I thought that you and I had -- I don't know -- a mutual respect.",
        "Eric: I believe we do.",
        "Liam: And yet, you seem to be playing matchmaker between Steffy and Wyatt. Quinn's idea, obviously, but, Eric, your doing.",
        "Eric: My granddaughter and I make up our own minds about everything. And her love life is hers alone.",
        "Liam: Okay, is it, though? Because you just dangled the one thing that you knew Steffy couldn't refuse, the one dream she thought would never come true in exchange for, what, for her tolerating Quinn?",
        "Eric: All right, listen. I want you to --",
        "Quinn: Liam! What are you doing here?",
        "Liam: What did you do to him? I hope you're checking your medications against photos of what they're supposed to look like. Have you been acting like yourself lately?",
        "Eric: That's enough!",
        "Liam: Nobody else thinks so!",
        "Quinn: I think you should go now.",
        "Liam: Or maybe it's just the brainwashing technique. I mean, has she told you about her traumatic childhood yet? Has she done that? Has she offered to whisk you away to a cabin in the woods? That one's gonna be good.",
        "Eric: You need to stop this.",
        "Liam: I know you. I see you. I know what you are. You're a predator, and you've got your teeth so deep in him, he's hardly there.",
        "Eric: This is my house! You do not come in here and talk about my wife this way.",
        "Liam: Your wife. Who was my wife first. Isn't that right, eve? Eric. Eric, I have been where you are. And there is a way back out from it, but you have to remember your real life, and you have to want it back.",
        "Eric: I have what I want. I'm just sorry you're a man incapable of happiness for himself. And, really, why would I want that for my granddaughter?"
