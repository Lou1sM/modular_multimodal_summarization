{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7218 ~ Zende & Sasha meet under fashionable circumstances in the Forrester design office; after hearing of Ivy's most recent scare, Lt. Baker pays an unwelcome visit to Steffy & Liam."], "Recap": ["Zende apologizes for thinking Sasha was Nicole and had peeked in on her. Sasha says she is not ashamed and doesn't mind that he did. They both admit they are not models but would like to be. She asks if all interns sneak up on their girlfriends. She is astonished to find out that he is Nicole's boyfriend, Zende. She tells him that Nicole is a lucky girl. Wyatt and Liam argue the facts about the restraining order. Wyatt says he does not believe Steffy did this on purpose but isn't it funny that bad things happen to Ivy when Steffy is around. Vivienne hopes Sasha will stay in town longer because of Nicole but Julius tells her not to encourage this. Sasha will not be staying in town. She thinks he sounds like he has something against Sasha and she does not know why. Ivy is out of it for a few minutes with Steffy hollering for her to wake up. When she does she tells Steffy she is okay but just leave this house.", "Ivy then calls Lt. Baker and tells him that Steffy was just here. She fell and hit her head and he must do something about this. He tells her to lock the doors and he will send a squad car over. Wyatt comes first and she fills him in on Steffy being here. A restraining order must mean nothing to Steffy as she would not leave before coming in. She did not come by just to see how she was. She wants to go back to work and kept brandishing the restraining order in her face. Steffy goes back to FC. Liam tells her to leave before Ivy might come and it will look bad. She admits she already has seen Ivy. She went to Wyatt's. He asks why she keeps doing this. She violated the restraining order. She says she wanted to explain. He says she has no choice. If she violates it she will be in big trouble. He is amazed that Ivy got hurt again with Steffy always the one to be there. Ivy tells Wyatt that she is not out to get Steffy but she wants her to leave her alone. Steffy tells Liam that Ivy is okay, she just has a little bump on her head. She wanted to take her to the hospital but she is fine. She says she knows it was dumb but she just wanted to talk it out. She understands Liam now that she can not even do that. Lt. Baker walks in and tells Steffy the second violation is no excuse. She is not supposed to be in this building. And he hears there is a second accident with Ivy; that is very serious. She realizes that was against the law. Liam says it will never happen again; Baker says you bet it won't, Steffy is under arrest."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Steffy: Ivy! Ivy, Ivy, wake up! Ivy, come on.", "Wyatt: Liam, this is very real for Ivy.", "Liam: Yeah, I realize that.", "Wyatt: Do you? Because Ivy almost lost her life, and she remembers everything, that Steffy pushed her and about 5,000 volts of electricity that went through her.", "Liam: Yeah, I know, Wyatt. It was a horrible accident. So -- so you're not gonna talk to her about lifting the restraining order?", "Wyatt: I didn't say that. Just you -- you got to understand. This is not a game for Ivy. She's legitimately, like, terrified of Steffy right now. And that's why she got the restraining order in the first place. And that's also why it's not gonna be easy to convince her to drop it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: Julius, Sasha just got here.", "Julius: She's just passing through, love.", "Vivienne: Oh, is that what she said?", "Julius: More or less.", "Vivienne: Oh, well, she's Nicole's oldest and dearest friend, and I'm sure if she came here, she plans to stay for a little while.", "Julius: Viv, three or four days is a long enough time for a visit. And let's not try and convince her to stay, okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Whoa, uh, sorry. I thought...", "Sasha: Well, go on. You thought...?", "Zende: Well, I thought you, um...", "Sasha: You thought I was someone else?", "Zende: Right, look, I'm -- I'm really sorry.", "Sasha: Don't be. I'm not.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: Well, we practically raised Sasha. [Chuckles] You couldn't get any closer than those two. And knowing Nicole, I bet you she's gonna try to convince her to stay, I bet even move in with them.", "Julius: No. She's leaving. We've discussed it.", "Vivienne: Well, what exactly did you discuss?", "Julius: About her showing up unexpectedly.", "Vivienne: Does she have a problem? Is there something about Sasha I don't know?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: You're staring.", "Zende: Uh... I-I just -- uh, I just didn't expect...", "Sasha: What? A half-naked girl to be standing behind a changing screen?", "Zende: [Chuckles] I guess that is where they're usually found, right? Aren't you gonna cover up?", "Sasha: Aren't you gonna tell me who you are?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Okay, serious question. Do you think that Steffy is a threat to Ivy?", "Wyatt: I don't think she wants to be, but...", "Liam: \"But\" what? You're not convinced?", "Wyatt: A lot of bad stuff went down between those two. I mean, when Steffy fired Ivy, she didn't take it very well. It was hard on her. We were both ready to blow out of here, so we actually, you know, we went to dad and tried to convince him to start our own fashion house.", "Liam: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?!", "Wyatt: Yeah, so we wouldn't even be here right now if he agreed to it. But anyway, to answer your question, no, I don't think Steffy deliberately pushed Ivy into the electrical panel. But it's weird, though, don't you think? Bad stuff does seem to happen to Ivy when she's around Steffy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Ivy, come on! Wake up! Answer! [Gasps]", "Ivy: What happened?", "Steffy: Ivy, Ivy, are you --", "Ivy: Steffy, Steffy, don't come anywhere near me!", "Steffy: No, it's -- it's okay. You fell. You fell.", "Ivy: Steffy, get out of this house.", "Steffy: Let me just call --", "Ivy: Go! Get out of this house, Steffy!", "Steffy: Ivy, I need to know if you're okay.", "Ivy: I'm fine! I'm fine! Just get out! Get out! [Breathing heavily]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Vivienne: Is there a problem with Sasha? Because if there is, you could --", "Julius: There's nothing to worry about, darling.", "Vivienne: Oh. Then she did say something to you.", "Julius: We talked about it. I already told you that.", "Vivienne: Yeah, but you didn't tell me what she said.", "Julius: About life, this, that, okay?", "Vivienne: Oh. So you don't want to tell me what she said.", "Julius: It was nothing. She has her issues, right? We all do.", "Vivienne: Yeah, I mean, no more than our girls had, I suppose.", "Julius: Listen, Sasha will not be staying in los Angeles. Now, can we drop this?", "Vivienne: You're upset?", "Julius: No! It -- it's just that, you know -- you know, you keep beating this thing in the ground. You know what I mean? I mean, I can't even putt with all this yammering.", "Vivienne: Well, you sound like you have something against Sasha. Julius, what is it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: Hey, um, can you zip me up?", "Zende: Um, yeah. Sure.", "Sasha: Thank you.", "Zende: So, you must be new here.", "Sasha: Yep. Fresh off the plane. You? Oh, wait, no. Let me guess. You're a model.", "Zende: Yeah. How'd you guess?", "Sasha: Well, I mean, look at you. [Chuckles] You are really not cut out for a desk job, that's for sure.", "Zende: I guess you're right about that. Where you from? New York? Paris?", "Sasha: I wish. I'm from the Midwest.", "Zende: Oh. Wait. This isn't your first modeling gig, right?", "Sasha: [Scoffs] No. Of course not.", "Zende: Oh, where'd you work before?", "Sasha: I was a cashier. [Chuckles]", "Zende: Wait, what? What am I missing?", "Sasha: I'm -- I'm not a model.", "Zende: Oh.", "[Both laugh]", "Sasha: Gotcha.", "Zende: Yeah, um, I'm not a model, either.", "Sasha: Get out.", "Zende: Nope. Actually, this is my office.", "Sasha: What? Are you some kind of big executive or something?", "Zende: Not quite. I'm sort of an intern.", "Sasha: Huh. So, do you just sneak up on all the girls, \"sort of intern\"?", "Zende: I thought you were my girlfriend.", "Sasha: Oh, you have a girlfriend. That is just too bad. She work here?", "Zende: Yeah. Her name's Nicole.", "Sasha: Wait, you're Zende?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Telephone rings]", "Lt. Baker: [Sighs] Baker.", "Ivy: Uh, lieutenant baker, it's Ivy Forrester. Steffy was just at my house.", "Lt. Baker: What happened?", "Ivy: She came over here to Wyatt's, and -- and she had the restraining order. She wanted me to rip it up. She kept moving towards me when I refused, so I tried to reach for my phone so that I could call you -- I could call the police, and that's when she was moving towards me and I -- and I fell and I hit my head. Please, you have to do something. You have to stop her.", "Lt. Baker: All right, calm down, ms. Forrester. Is Steffy still there?", "Ivy: No, no, she's not. She's gone.", "Lt. Baker: Are you alone?", "Ivy: Yes.", "Lt. Baker: All right, lock all your doors. I'll send a squad car over. Call a friend to come sit with you. I'll take care of this.", "Ivy: Thank you. [Groans] God. [Grunts] [Panting] Ah. Wyatt. I'm so glad it's you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: What? Who else would it be?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: [Sighs] Steffy was here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Ah, ah, ah, hey. You're not supposed to be here.", "Steffy: Ivy isn't in the building.", "Liam: Well, how do you know?", "Steffy: Because she's at Wyatt's.", "Liam: Uh, you sure?", "Steffy: Yeah, yeah.", "Liam: Okay. Sorry. I... this is rough. I know.", "Steffy: Yeah, it's -- it's been hell.", "Liam: But -- but it's also temporary. I just spoke to Wyatt, and he's gonna have a conversation with Ivy.", "Steffy: I don't -- I don't know if that's gonna help.", "Liam: No, it will. You give it time, she'll calm down.", "Steffy: That's what I was hoping.", "Liam: Listen, the longer you stay away, the more reasonable she'll become. And look at it positively. How many people wish they could work from home? Am I right?", "Steffy: No, this person doesn't.", "Liam: It's just for a little while. So, you know, grab your files. Actually, I'll have them sent to you. In the meantime, Steffy, you should get out of here before Ivy shows up, because that could be bad. I know. I know. This, too, shall pass, all right?", "Steffy: I don't -- I don't know. I, um... I went to see Ivy.", "Liam: What?! Where?", "Steffy: She's at Wyatt's.", "Liam: Steffy, what are you -- [Sighs].", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: So, what do you have against Sasha?", "Julius: Nothing.", "Vivienne: I know you, Julius.", "Julius: Baby, listen, I'm a little bit out of sorts today, okay?", "Vivienne: Why?", "Julius: I didn't sleep well last night. Hey, listen, any news about the job interview?", "Vivienne: Julius, Nicole and Sasha are like sisters.", "Julius: Sasha is nothing like Nicole.", "Vivienne: Well, I tend to disagree with you. And to be honest, I think it would be wonderful if Sasha decided to stay in los Angeles.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Wait, you know my name?", "Sasha: [Scoffs] I'll bet a lot of women around here know your name.", "Zende: Okay, well, I still don't know yours.", "Sasha: Why don't you take a guess? I mean, you've already seen me in my underwear.", "Zende: [Chuckles]", "Sasha: Am I misty? How about kitty?", "Zende: No. Give me a hint.", "Sasha: Okay. Well, we have a mutual friend. Well, more than a friend to you.", "Zende: No. Sasha?", "Sasha: The one and only.", "Zende: [Chuckles] Wow, Nicole talks about you constantly.", "Sasha: Yeah, well, she better. We're practically family.", "Zende: Wow. I had no idea.", "Sasha: No idea what?", "Zende: No, that you, uh...", "Sasha: Oh, beautiful? Captivating? [Chuckles]", "Zende: And so humble.", "Sasha: [Chuckles] Ay, yi, yi. Well, Nicole is a lucky girl.", "Zende: I know.", "Sasha: Oh. Humility. Nice. We share that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: Oh, good! You've met!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: Oh, yeah. We've met.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Doesn't a restraining order mean anything to this woman?!", "Wyatt: Well, what did Steffy want?", "Ivy: She wanted me to rip it up!", "Wyatt: What?", "Ivy: Yeah.", "Wyatt: And what did you -- what did you do?", "Ivy: Well, I told her she can't be here and that she has to leave, but... ugh! Wyatt, I was -- I was so scared. I just...", "Wyatt: Okay.", "Ivy: I just keep getting these flashbacks about what happened at Forrester and then her pushing me.", "Wyatt: I know, I know. Shh. It's okay. It's okay, all right? Okay, look, you're gonna get these flashbacks, okay? You're gonna need the time to recover. But you're also gonna have to realize that maybe this was an accident, a-a tragic, horrible accident. Steffy didn't intentionally, like, mean to hurt you.", "Ivy: Wh--", "Wyatt: And when she came by, maybe she was, like, trying to just check up on you, see how you were doing.", "Ivy: No, she wasn't! She -- Wyatt, she just wants to go back to work. That's why she wants me to drop the restraining order, okay? That's it. And then when I refused, she kept walking towards me, and that's when I fell and I hit my head.", "Wyatt: What?", "Ivy: Yeah, I-I was reaching for my phone 'cause I thought she was gonna attack me.", "Wyatt: Are you okay?", "Ivy: Yeah, it's just a bump. It's fine.", "Wyatt: Oh, my God. Come. Sit down. Sit down. Just come sit.", "Ivy: I-I took care of it all.", "Wyatt: How?", "Ivy: I called lieutenant baker.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Steffy, why did you do that?", "Steffy: I-I-I thought I could get through to her! This is so stupid, Liam! A restraining order? Really?", "Liam: Yes, a restraining order, which you violated!", "Steffy: I wanted to apologize to her. I wanted to reason with Ivy.", "Liam: Yeah, well, guess what? There's a court order saying you can't do that, not right now.", "Steffy: I know, I know, but I just felt like maybe --", "Liam: No, no, no, no! There's no buts! There's no buts, Steffy. You do not have a choice in the matter. If you violate that order, you are in big trouble!", "Steffy: I know, I know.", "Liam: What -- okay, how -- how did she react when she saw you?", "Steffy: She was scared to death. I told her how bad I felt and I wanted to put everything behind us. [Sighs]", "Liam: And then what'd she say?", "Steffy: She was petrified. I tried to calm her down, and then she kept backing up. She...", "Liam: She...?", "Steffy: She -- she grabbed her phone and...", "Liam: She grabbed her phone and then what? What?", "Steffy: Okay, okay. She fell. She -- she tripped, and -- and she -- she hit her head.", "Liam: Oh, my God! She got hurt again?!", "Steffy: [Sighs]:", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: So, what do you think?", "Sasha: Ehh. I wouldn't throw him back just yet.", "Nicole: Ohh, high praise from this one.", "Zende: Yeah, I get the feeling.", "Nicole: Well, I think he's legit.", "Sasha: I told him he's a lucky man.", "Nicole: Stick around here and you'll find yourself one of those, too.", "Sasha: Yeah. Maybe.", "Nicole: Don't think I'm letting you go back. You just got here.", "Sasha: We'll see.", "Nicole: And your visit with my parents -- I hope it didn't weird you out.", "Sasha: No, no, no. Your mom and I have always been so close.", "Nicole: But my dad?", "Sasha: What about him?", "Nicole: Like I said, Sasha, I mean, it seemed like you two were arguing or something when I walked in.", "Sasha: [Chuckles] Mr. Avant and I, we just see things differently.", "Zende: What things?", "Sasha: You know, life, family, ehh.", "Nicole: Just don't let my dad scare you away, okay?", "Sasha: Right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: Sasha will not be staying in los Angeles, and I don't want you encouraging it.", "Vivienne: Why don't you like her?", "Julius: Listen, Viv, we already got a full plate. We got one daughter who's pregnant. We got everything that's going on with Maya. We don't need another one.", "Vivienne: Sasha can fend for herself.", "Julius: Good. Let her do it back in Illinois.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Ball clinks]", "Wyatt: Did you really have to call the police?", "Ivy: Yes! Yes, I think I did!", "Wyatt: Okay, okay, calm down. I'm just -- I'm not judging you. I was just asking.", "Ivy: Wyatt, after everything I've been through with Steffy, I don't want her anywhere near me, okay? That's why I got the restraining order in the first place. Look, I'm not out to get this girl. That's not the whole point of this. Please tell me you don't believe that.", "Wyatt: No, I don't -- I don't believe that. I get why you're scared. But it consumes you, and -- and maybe over time, you're gonna realize that Steffy isn't a threat.", "Ivy: I want Steffy to leave me alone. Do you know how hurt I could have gotten today? When Steffy's around, bad things happen.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Ivy's okay. She just has a little bump on her head.", "Liam: Oh, my God. Did you touch her?", "Steffy: No, no.", "Liam: Okay, what about after she fell?", "Steffy: Well, yeah, I touched her to see if she was okay. I wanted to take her to the hospital.", "Liam: The hospital?!", "Steffy: No, but just in case! But she's fine now. Really, she's fine. [Sighs]", "Liam: You can never go over there again.", "Steffy: I know. I know it was dumb. I just thought we could talk it out.", "Liam: There's no talking it out. There's no approaching her. There's no getting anywhere near her. Please look me in the eye and say you understand that.", "Steffy: Yeah, I do.", "Liam: Okay. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.", "Steffy: No, I'm sorry.", "Liam: Listen, it's gonna be okay. We have a wedding to plan. Let's just focus on that.", "Steffy: Okay.", "Liam: Agreed?", "Steffy: Yeah, yeah, okay.", "Liam: All right.", "[Knock on door]", "Liam: Uh, yeah, come in.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lt. Baker: Just who I was looking for.", "[Door closes]", "Lt. Baker: Your second violation of the day. You're not even supposed to be in this building.", "Liam: I-I know, but we only came here to -- to pack up her stuff.", "Lt. Baker: I see. And your excuse for paying Ivy a visit?", "Steffy: I-I-I wanted to apologize. We're family. And it -- it was an accident, lieutenant.", "Lt. Baker: And then I hear there was a second so-called accident?", "Steffy: Ye-yeah, she -- she tripped, but it wasn't serious.", "Lt. Baker: Oh, it was very serious. The moment you came close to that woman, you broke the law.", "Liam: Li-listen, it was a mistake, and I promise you it won't happen again.", "Lt. Baker: Oh, it certainly won't. Steffy Forrester, you're in violation of the temporary restraining order. You are under arrest."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EWwfcsXX1o"}
