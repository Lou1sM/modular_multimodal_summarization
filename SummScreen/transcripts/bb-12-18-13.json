        "Ridge and Brooke kiss before the cascading fountain. Back at his cliff house, Liam asks Hope what took so long. She says weddings make her mom sentimental and she pulled out the baby pictures but started talking about Ridge which is something she had not done in a long time. He asks if she got everything done. She says yes right down to the last detail. Their wedding is a go. There's nothing for Liam to do but show up on time and properly dressed. He laughs that he can do that. She says it is almost mind blowing. The day before their wedding and nothing is in their way. She has so much nervous energy that she feels like she ought to be doing something. He says she has no reason to be nervous as Steffy is not an issue with them anymore. Neither is his dad or Wyatt or his crazy mom. He doesn't think they are gonna have any crazy surprises tomorrow. In Paris Quinn tells Steffy that if she wants to stop this wedding she must do it now. Steffy argues that she has already told Liam to get back with Hope. Quinn says she told Hope to give Liam what he wanted but that didn't happen. They did not get married. Steffy say things are back on track now. Quinn replies that is only because Liam was threatened by Wyatt and he panicked. And if a marriage starts out like that there is not much hope that it is going to last. She keeps encouraging Steffy to go back and just tell Liam the truth and see if he still wants to marry Hope. At least that way Steffy will know. Steffy finally gives in and says okay; she will go back with Quinn. Eric signs some papers for Donna and tells her that Ridge is home. She is shocked and wonders if Brooke knows. Eric says he is on the way to see her now. He did not tell Ridge about Bill. He did not think it was his place. Donna says she works at Forrester too and she knows how people gossip. Eric says Steffy and Thomas have been at International for months now and Bill and Brooke have kept it out of the press. So Ridge does not know. Ridge thinks Brooke is all alone. And he's going to win her back. Donna says likewise with Bill. He still thinks he has a chance with Brooke. Eric says oh my God; he doesn't think Bill is the kind of guy who shrinks at a little competition. Donna says Brooke is passionate about Bill but Ridge was the love of her life. Inside, Ridge tells Brooke that he knows she must have a lot of questions and he wants to answer all of them. He says he is sorry that he hurt her. A look of disgust comes over her face and she hauls off and hits him with a closed fist across his face. She barks at him ..he came him after all this time to tell her that he is sorry! He left her on their honeymoon and she had to come back here and deal with all this crap. He tells her that he is lost without her. He can not function without her. He thought he could come back and they could talk without hitting each other. She says they did talk but he was always so distant. He apologizes for that too. He says that is why he is here. He says he stood outside her door for hours and tried to think of what to say and how to make up for it, but he can't. There is nothing he can say except it won't happen again ever. She can't believe this is happening. They both admit they have missed each other. She throws her arms around his neck and tears fall.",
        "Ridge sees bottles of booze and asks if he drove Brooke to drink. She fills him in on the wedding tomorrow. She says Hope would have invited R. J. but she knew he needed to finish school. Ridge says yes that is why he came alone. He will get him when the term is finished. He enjoyed spending time in Paris and seeing Thomas and Steffy and it also gave him time to find himself as an artist and designer and find where his passion lies. And it reminded him what he can leave on the table and what he can't live without. Ridge tells Brooke that it is almost like he never left. He tells her that he wanted to talk to her so many times, but really what he wanted was to be here and hold her like this. He says it's been far too long. He grabs her and hugs her again. Quinn asks Steffy if Liam knew she was getting treatments. She replies that no as she did not know if they would work. Steffy says Quinn is right. If she is going to tell Liam she has to tell him before the wedding. Quinn says they need to get back to L. A. as fast as they can. Liam tells Hope that he just wants tomorrow to be just what she wants. And as long as he is there standing at the altar with her it will be perfect for him. She says she is sorry. She should not have brought up Steffy. He replies that just mentioning her name does not mean she will magically appear. Hope says once they are married she knows all of her issues with her will seem like ancient history. That doesn't have to be part of their vows and Steffy will be no part of their wedding. Hope asks Liam if Steffy knows they are getting married. He says no as he didn't tell her. And he doesn't feel badly for her. Tomorrow will be just another day for her. Hope says she knows Steffy meant a lot to him. They were going to have a baby and be a family. And the fact that Steffy gave all of that up so Hope could have him is something she will always be grateful for. Liam chimes in him too. But Hope says it is also why she hates her. Liam says all of that is in the past. Ridge tells Brooke that he's made a lot of wrong assumptions about her and he doesn't want to make another one. He hopes she knows why he is here. He wants to come home and be a family again and he hopes she feels the same way. She says it has been over a year. He says he knows and it is a lot to process. She says a lot has happened. He says but nothing has changed. It's always been just Brooke. He knows when they talked it was just a quick one or two word answers. Mostly it was about R.J. not their relationship. She agrees it was like that in the beginning but then things changed and she really had no hope for them. She did not know this day would be happening. She starts to say she has something to tell him. He interrupts and says he just wants to look at her like this. He knows she has a wedding to get ready for so he will stay with his Dad and he won't interrupt the wedding tomorrow but then they will celebrate afterwards. He says he is home. When he leaves, Brooke grabs her chest and cries."

        "Steffy: Things are back on track now.",
        "Quinn: Because Liam forced the issue. He saw Hope developing feelings for Wyatt, and he panicked. Now, you tell me... if a marriage starts out like that, what are the odds it's going to last?",
        "Quinn: You left L.A. so Liam could have a perfect life with Hope -- perfect little family --",
        "Steffy: You know, just give them a chance. Our marriage was just annulled.",
        "Quinn: They could have gotten married the next day, but they didn't. Aren't you curious as to why? There's only one way to find out. Go back to L.A. Tell Liam about your treatment. Tell him you can have a baby, and then ask him if he still wants to marry Hope.",
        "Steffy: And if he does?",
        "Quinn: Then at least you'll both know. But if you let him make this decision thinking Hope is his only choice...",
        "Steffy: All right. All right. I'll talk to Liam. You can tell the pilot he's gonna have another passenger, all right? I'm going back to L.A. with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: So there's nothing we're forgetting.",
        "Hope: No. All taken care of.",
        "Liam: Nothing you need me to do?",

        "Liam: [Chuckles] I can do that.",
        "Hope: [Laughs] This wedding's gonna be really beautiful, Liam.",
        "Liam: With you at the altar, \"Beautiful\" is an understatement.",
        "Hope: You know what's an understatement? To say that I'm relieved.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: It's kind of mind-blowing that we're doing it. It's the day before our wedding, and this time there's nothing in our way.",

        "Eric: This all could have waited.",

        "Donna: [Chuckles] You know, I'm just making sure you're okay.",
        "Eric: I'm fine. I'm a little surprised, though.",

        "Eric: Ridge is home.",
        "Donna: In L.A.?!",
        "Eric: Yeah. He's just arrived.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: Like I never left. I'm back.",
        "Brooke: And every time I talked to you, you never said --",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I know. But I wanted to. So many times. What I really wanted was to be here and hold you just like this. It's been too long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: Look, I didn't want to complicate things. I left L.A. to make it simple. That's why I gave him an annulment. You know, I didn't want to drag it out.",
        "Quinn: Hope had other ideas.",
        "Steffy: Liam was the whole world to her.",
        "Quinn: Until she met my son.",
        "Steffy: You know, Hope always made it out like I was the only problem she and Liam ever had. I mean, if it wasn't for me, they'd just be perfectly happy together. When I found out I couldn't have children, I...I knew they still had a connection between them, and I just thought maybe, you know, step away.",
        "Quinn: You made an incredibly unselfish decision for the man you love. You wanted him to be happy. You -- you hoped he would be.",
        "Steffy: And maybe he will be.",
        "Quinn: Well, he will, after he hears your news. He didn't know you were getting treatments?",
        "Steffy: Well, I didn't -- I didn't know if the treatments would work.",
        "Quinn: Well, they did. And now you can have children.",
        "Steffy: You're right. You're right. If I'm gonna tell Liam, I have to do it before the wedding.",
        "Quinn: Yes, yes. That is why we need to get back to Los Angeles as fast as we can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Okay, you need to come here.",
        "Hope: I...can't. I feel like I should be doing something.",

        "Hope: You're right. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: You did say everything was taken care of, right?",
        "Hope: Yeah, yeah. It is.",

        "Hope: So I just... I just have all this nervous energy.",
        "Liam: You have nothing to be nervous about.",
        "Hope: I'm -- I'm not. It's just it's my wedding, so I'm nervous about everything. Except... except Steffy.",
        "Liam: Well, you don't have to be nervous about Steffy on our wedding day or any other day. She's not an issue for us anymore. Neither is my dad. Neither is Wyatt. And neither is his crazy mom. I don't think we're gonna have any surprises tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I know you have a lot of questions, and I want to answer all of them. But right now I just want to say something. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I've hurt you. [Grunts]",
        "Brooke: [Breathes deeply] You are sorry?",
        "Ridge: [Exhales sharply]",
        "Brooke: You came here after all this time to tell me you're sorry?! You left me, Ridge. You left me on our honeymoon! And I had to come back here and deal with all this crap!",
        "Ridge: Logan... I'm lost without you. I can't function without you. And I-I came here because I thought we could talk about it, not hit each other, maybe talk --",
        "Brooke: No, we -- we talked and talked, and you were extremely distant.",
        "Ridge: And I'm sorry for that, too.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry for all of it. That's why I'm here. I was standing outside your door for hours, just... just...[Sighs] Trying to figure out what to say to you, how to make this up to you, and you know what? I can't. There's nothing I can say other than maybe I... it won't happen again. Ever.",
        "Brooke: [Scoffs]",
        "Ridge: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: [Sniffles] Wow. This is really, really happening.",
        "Ridge: It is. I mean, is it...happening? Man, I've missed you.",
        "Brooke: I've missed you. [Sniffles] [Crying] I've missed you. [Sobs] [Sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: I just want tomorrow to be everything that you want it to be. 'Cause as long as I'm there, a-as long as I'm just standing at the altar with you, it's perfect to me.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have even brought up Steffy.",
        "Liam: You know saying her name does not make her magically appear, right? Yeah. See?",
        "Hope: [Laughs] But you -- you can understand why she feels a little bit like the boogeyman to me, right?",
        "Liam: Of course. I know how sensitive you are to her still.",
        "Hope: But once we're married, I know that all of my issues with her are gonna feel like ancient history.",
        "Liam: You gonna put that in your vows?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Hope: Steffy will not be in any part of our wedding.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] What time is the wedding?",
        "Quinn: Don't worry. You'll make it.",
        "Steffy: Even if I do, I might not be able to stop it. Is that what you're hoping for?",
        "Quinn: Is that what you're hoping for?",
        "Steffy: Liam and I need to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: You didn't tell Ridge about Brooke and Bill.",
        "Eric: I didn't think it was my place.",
        "Donna: [Sighs] I mean, he must know.",
        "Eric: No. No, he doesn't.",
        "Donna: Eric, come on, I work at Forrester, too. I know how people gossip.",
        "Eric: And nobody knows anything. You know, Thomas and Steffy have been at International for months now. And -- and Brooke and Bill have been very careful to keep it out of the press.",
        "Donna: So Ridge thinks that Brooke's been all alone?",
        "Eric: Well, she is, isn't she? I know that Bill doesn't live there anymore. Didn't he go back to Katie?",
        "Donna: No.",
        "Eric: So where does the relationship stand?",
        "Donna: Bill hasn't given up on Brooke. He thinks he can get her back.",
        "Eric: Oh, my God. Well, Bill does not strike me as somebody who shrinks from a little competition.",
        "Donna: Maybe not. But how's Ridge gonna feel about Brooke being pursued by her sister's husband?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: What's going on here? Did I drive you to drink?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] No, no. That's for -- for the wedding tomorrow -- Hope and Liam.",
        "Ridge: Oh. Of course. And tomorrow, huh?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Tomorrow.",
        "Ridge: Steffy told me they were planning on something, but I don't think she knew when.",
        "Brooke: Uh, Hope and Liam didn't even know when. It just kind of came about a few days ago. Hope wanted to invite R.J., but I warned her that he had to finish up school.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I know. It's the end of the term. Otherwise I would have brought him.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, uh, so what's gonna happen now? Is he gonna stay with Steffy and Thomas?",
        "Ridge: He's staying -- and the nanny right now, but, uh, until the end of term, and then I'm gonna bring him here. We're gonna live... you know, wherever we're gonna end up living, and -- and, um... hey, I enjoyed spending time with Steffy and Thomas in Paris. It just gave me a chance to find myself there as an artist and a designer and... and find...where my passion lies. And... and it kind of reminded me... what I can leave on the table and... and what I can't live without.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Steffy, if you want to stop this wedding, you have to do it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I feel a little bit bad for Steffy. And tomorrow...",
        "Liam: Is gonna be just another day for her.",
        "Hope: Does she not know that we're getting married?",
        "Liam: Uh, I mean, I-I didn't tell her.",
        "Hope: No?",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Hope: Do you feel bad for her?",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Liam, I know that she meant a lot to you. You were having a baby together. You were going to be a family. And the fact that she gave all that up so that I could have it with you is something that I will always be grateful for.",
        "Liam: Me too.",
        "Hope: It's also why I hate her so much.",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah. Hey, hey, look at me, my smart, sexy, beautiful bride.",
        "Hope: Yes?",
        "Liam: And believe me -- look at my eyes. And believe me when I say... all of that is in the past.",
        "Hope: I know.",
        "Liam: All right, then.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: I think they're both in for a shock.",
        "Donna: A-and Ridge didn't give Brooke any idea that he was coming back?",
        "Eric: No, he just showed up all revved up and ready to start over. How do you think your sister's going to feel about that?",
        "Donna: Well, I mean, Brooke is passionate about Bill. But Ridge is the love of her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ridge: I've made a lot of wrong assumptions about you, and I don't want to make another one. You know why I'm here, right?",
        "Brooke: You want to come home.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, and I want to be a family again, the way we were. And I want to make sure you want that, too.",
        "Brooke: Uh... it's just that it's been over a year.",
        "Ridge: It's, uh, it's a lot to process.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, a lot's happened.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I know. But... nothing's changed. It's... it's always been... it's always been you, only you. When you would call me, reach out to me, I would just give you one-, two-word answers and always about R.J., never about our relationship. And I know it's... [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: It was like that in the beginning. But then things changed, and... I-I just never really had hope for us. I never imagined this day happening. [Sighs] Ridge... there's something --",
        "Ridge: Can I stop you? I'm sorry. I ju-- I just want this moment...just now, us, me looking at you like that, okay. [Sighs] I know you're busy. You've got the wedding. You've got a lot of work to do. And -- and, uh... is Hope staying with you here tonight?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Ridge: Okay, good. That's... that's good. I'll stay with Dad. And don't worry. I'm not gonna interrupt the wedding. I don't... I just want her to have a big day, and then... we can celebrate after. Hey... I'm home, Logan.",
