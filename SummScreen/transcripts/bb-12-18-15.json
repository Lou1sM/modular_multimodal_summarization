He knows why she is doing it but it is coming off as spiteful. She does not want to talk about the restraining order anymore. She wants to talk about them as it is the first time since the hospital that they have had a good chance to talk. She says she was in love with him and then he was gone. She says she is with Wyatt now and she can love him but only if she knows it will never work out with her and Liam. Liam is shocked and reminds her they have both moved on. She says this accident has made her realize that life is short and she does not want to regret telling him the truth. She can not forget her feelings and what it was to be with him. She can't imagine that he too can forget. Julius tells Sasha he will relax when she has a one way ticket out of LA in her hand. She says making herself home here sounds like a real good idea. Zende stops short of taking off Nicole's clothes. She asks why and he says maybe they should wait. He says he knows it should not matter but that is another man's baby right here. She leaves and does not want to talk about this right now. Wyatt tells Steffy that a restraining order is just going too far. And that Liam needs to talk Ivy out of it. Everybody sees that Nicole is upset and not herself. She goes upstairs.", "Sasha goes to Zende's room and asks if she can come in. She says he has seen her in her underwear so he can tell her anything. She doesn't think he should keep secrets. He says he messed up .and it was more than just talking. He says he just realized this was another man's baby and he couldn't do anything with Nicole. He says he has to get over this somehow. She says nothing is wrong with him. He reminds her that the pregnancy just started and he is not sure he can get through this. She says she came to town just in time and she can help with anything he needs. Liam says he loves Ivy and he had fond memories but they have both moved on. She says Steffy is still the one he wants after all that has happened and it still does not make it any less painful. She has been through a lot this year and Steffy's hands were all over it. If Liam marries Steffy then she will be happy with Wyatt, but they need to explore that it is completely over between them. She will drop the restraining order ..if Liam will give her one more chance. She kisses him as he looks blankly at her."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Ivy: [Sighs] Liam, please. I need you to try and understand this. I have to try and keep myself out of danger, and that means not being around Steffy.", "Liam: I-I know that you're trying to do right by yourself. I-I get that. But it's -- it's not coming off that way, Ivy. It's coming off spiteful. I mean, keeping Steffy from her job and dictating her life -- that's not good. That's not gonna end well for anyone. Please drop the restraining order.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Insects chirping]", "Wyatt: You need some help?", "Steffy: I'm fine.", "Wyatt: No, you're not.", "Steffy: Oh, you mean because I almost got arrested today? Is that what you're talking about?", "Wyatt: To be honest, you did violate a court order.", "Steffy: I tried talking sense into Ivy. How did this happen? How is your girlfriend controlling my life?", "Wyatt: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: Relax, Mr. Avant.", "Julius: I will relax when you got a one-way bus ticket in your hand.", "Sasha: Oh, no, see, that's not gonna happen. It's probably better if you get used to the idea of having me around.", "Julius: I don't want you to get too comfort here.", "Sasha: Where? In L.A.? Because I've got to say, making myself at home here feels like a really good idea.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: What's wrong?", "Zende: Nothing. It's just, uh... weird.", "Nicole: Maybe we should wait.", "Zende: Yeah, maybe.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: Now, if you are in L.A. Long term, you have to promise me you're gonna keep Nicole out of trouble. Okay. [Laughs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Well, at least while Nicole's pregnant.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: I promise. Wow. I still can't believe what she's doing for you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: And we're just so thankful she's willing to do it. We know how much she's giving up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Are you mad?", "Nicole: No.", "Zende: I'm mad at myself.", "Nicole: Don't be.", "Zende: There's another man's baby right here. I know it shouldn't matter, but...", "Nicole: What are you doing?", "Zende: Let's try again.", "Nicole: But you don't want to.", "Zende: Let's try.", "Nicole: I don't want to.", "Zende: Wait. Can we talk about this?", "Nicole: Not right now.", "Zende: Nicole.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: It's not like ivy's trying to control you, Steffy. She's trying to take control of her own life, put herself out of harm's way.", "Steffy: Of course you'd see that, because you're team Ivy.", "Wyatt: [Scoffs] For most things, yeah. But I do think a restraining order is going a bit too far.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: How are you supposed to move on? How are you supposed to get over this fear of Steffy if you won't let her anywhere near you? That's what a restraining order does, right? It guarantees that you'll always be at odds, but if you drop it, Ivy, if you give Steffy a chance to just show you --", "Ivy: Liam, I don't want to -- I don't want to talk about the restraining order anymore.", "Liam: All right. Okay. Fine.", "Ivy: This is the first time you and I have been alone together since the hospital. I want to talk about us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: That's very convenient, making your little sister your surrogate, move her into your house so you can watch her like a hawk. [Chuckles]", "Maya: Let's just say we take very good care of her.", "Sasha: And Zende's cool with this whole pregnancy thing?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: He seems to be.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Nicole, wait up. Wait a second, Nicole.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: Hey, what's going on?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: Yeah, honey, are you okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I'm just going to go to my room. Excuse me. [Sniffles]", "Zende: Wait. Can I...?", "Nicole: I just need to be alone right now. I'm tired.", "Zende: Sorry for interrupting y'all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: What was that?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: I think somebody needs to go and see if Nicole's okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: This seems like a family matter. I-I better go.", "Maya: Thank you for coming, Sasha. Um, I'm sorry it ended like this.", "Sasha: You know, I'll see you real soon. Make sure you tell Nicole I'm thinking about her. Okay.", "Vivienne: Yeah.", "Maya: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Ivy's scared, okay? Just being in your presence gets her all worked up. I mean, you can understand that, right?", "Steffy: I do. I do to a point. But this restraining order, this has gone way too far.", "Wyatt: Well, maybe Liam will convince her to drop it.", "Steffy: I hope so. But I don't think his opinion matters anymore. Ivy has major issues with him. I mean, they used to be close, but that was a long time ago.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You want to talk about us? What about us?", "Ivy: Well, we used to be so close.", "Liam: Yeah, we did.", "Ivy: I mean, does that still mean anything to you? Or did Steffy magically erase all of that, as well?", "Liam: No, it means a lot to me. I'm always gonna cherish my memories of what we shared together, and I'm always gonna care about you. But that love, that sense of love that we felt, that's what I'm trying to get us all to tap into, because if we can just grab onto that, then -- then we could all move on.", "Ivy: You really mean that, don't you?", "Liam: Yeah.", "Ivy: See, that's what I'm jealous of. This man in front of me. So earnest and forthright, and I just let Steffy take that away.", "Liam: Uh...[Chuckles] It's not really what happened. But okay, even -- even if you do think that, restraining order -- not really the appropriate response, is it?", "Ivy: Liam, I was in love with you, and you just -- you were just gone.", "Liam: Yeah, but... you're with my brother now.", "Ivy: I know -- I know that. And I care for Wyatt so much. And I'm happy with him, and I will be happy with him... but only if I know that... only if I know that things will never work out between us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Julius: I told you. I told all of you. This surrogacy thing was a bad idea. Now Zende and Nicole are fighting.", "Rick: We don't know that.", "Vivienne: Well, something is going on.", "Julius: This baby is affecting Zende and Nicole's relationship. I hope you're happy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Knock on door]", "Zende: Sasha?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sasha: May I come in?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Vivienne: Julius, maybe we should go knock on her door.", "Rick: Here she comes.", "Nicole: Don't get quiet on my account.", "Vivienne: Honey, are you okay?", "Nicole: I don't want to talk about it. I'm just gonna grab something from the kitchen.", "Maya: Nicole. Just tell us if you're okay.", "Nicole: I will be. Sasha's gone?", "Rick: Yeah. She wanted us to tell you that she was thinking about you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: Where's Nicole?", "Sasha: It's just me. Can I come in?", "Zende: Were you looking for her?", "Sasha: No. [Chuckles] After what I just saw downstairs, I figured it was a pretty safe bet she wasn't with you. Besides, you're the one I was looking for. Although it took me awhile. You know, this house is huge.", "Zende: Why'd you want to see me? Shouldn't you be knocking on Nicole's door?", "Sasha: She's got her whole family downstairs asking her what's wrong. I figured you needed someone to do the same. You can talk to me. Look, what can't you say to a girl you've already seen in her underwear?", "Zende: [Chuckles]", "Sasha: I'm a real good listener.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: This sucks. I'm packing up to work from home, and I'm not even allowed inside the building.", "Wyatt: It won't be forever. Ivy just needs a little time to recover from the accident, okay?", "Steffy: That -- that's what it was. It was an accident.", "Wyatt: I know! I believe you! And Ivy will, too! Trust me! She'll come around!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: Work out between us? I mean... [Chuckles] Isn't it kind of obvious it didn't? I'm -- I'm engaged to somebody else.", "Ivy: I know that.", "Liam: And you're with my brother. I mean, I saw you at the hospital, Ivy. I heard what you said to Wyatt. You were genuinely grateful that he was there for you, that he still wanted to be with you after everything with Thomas.", "Ivy: No, I am. I am grateful. Wyatt's an amazing man. But after this whole experience of almost dying because of Steffy, I... and knowing now that you're about to spend the rest of your life with her... I can't help thinking about everything you and I have been through. I mean, we had good times together. We were happy. Won't you follow me home to the place where we belong? Follow me home just give me your hand when you feel like you can't start again just hold your breath and count to 10 today's the day I finally found the one to follow me home home", "Ivy: Do you remember?", "Liam: Of course I do.", "Ivy: You know, Thomas told me he thought Wyatt was just a rebound, and at the time, I denied it, but... [Sighs] I mean, now I can't help but wonder. What if I had a chance to have more? What if I had a chance to be with the one? This whole experience, this accident, it's made me realize that... life is short, Liam. It's really short, and it can be taken away from you in an instant. And I don't want to regret not telling you the truth. Liam, I can't forget what it's like to be with you. I can't forget about these feelings. Can you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Maya: [Sighs]", "Nicole: Mom and dad left?", "Maya: [Sighs] Yeah. Yeah, and Rick's upstairs, so it's just us. So you can tell me. Because I can see you're upset. What happened between you and Zende?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Zende: I shouldn't get into this.", "Sasha: Zende, you can tell me anything. Trust me. I know how to keep secrets.", "Zende: Okay, uh... I messed up. I feel terrible.", "Sasha: Messed -- messed up how?", "Zende: Me and Nicole were talking.", "Sasha: Talking?", "Zende: Maybe a little more.", "Sasha: And?", "Zende: And then I, uh, I couldn't...", "Sasha: Couldn't? Oh. Uh... okay. Why not?", "Zende: She's carrying Rick's baby. And it -- it freaked me out. It's still freaking me out.", "Sasha: Yeah, it's understandable.", "Zende: I wasn't on board with this when she first decided to do the surrogacy. I didn't want her to do it. I knew... [Scoffs]", "Sasha: So -- so what are you gonna do?", "Zende: What can I do? I have to get over it.", "Sasha: Do you?", "Zende: Yeah. Somehow. What's wrong with me? I couldn't just -- just do it.", "Sasha: Hey, hey, nothing is wrong with you.", "Zende: But this pregnancy just started, Sasha. I don't know if I can make it through.", "Sasha: Well, it looks like I came to town just in time, then. I think I can help you. Be the...friend that you need.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I shouldn't even have let him go over there. They don't get along anymore. How does Liam think he's gonna get Ivy to drop the restraining order when Ivy wants nothing to do with him?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: I'll always be grateful for our time together. You're right. We had so many fun, wonderful memories. I loved you. But... look, we've -- we've moved on. I've moved on.", "Ivy: So even after everything that's happened, you still think Steffy's the right one for you?", "Liam: Yes.", "Ivy: A selfish, callous woman who had no problem bulldozing her way through our relationship, who tossed me out of Forrester, who killed Aly, who tried to kill me! Let's not forget about that!", "Liam: Ivy, you know what that was.", "Ivy: It was an accident. I know that. I know. But it doesn't make anything any less painful for me, Liam. I mean, all of the humiliations at work -- that should have been enough to have affected you. Let alone go to a hospital and see me lying in a bed fighting for my life. Everything huge that I've been through this year Steffy's hands have been a part of.", "Liam: I know. It did affect me. It still does. Look how shaken up you are just talking about her.", "Ivy: Look, if you marry Steffy, I'll be happy with Wyatt. I know I will. I'll be fine. But shouldn't we at least explore our possibilities first and make sure we haven't made a huge mistake? I mean, can't we just have some time together?", "Liam: We are not the same people that we were. I mean, when we were dating, the Ivy I knew then, would she have blackmailed someone?", "Ivy: We've been over this. You know it's a huge mistake.", "Liam: Okay, okay, okay, fine. Would that Ivy have -- have taken out a restraining order for something that she knew was an accident?", "Ivy: You're right. Okay.", "Liam: \"Okay,\" what?", "Ivy: Okay, I'll drop the restraining order.", "Liam: Really? You will?", "Ivy: Yes.", "Liam: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I knew you'd do the right thing. Of course you would. This is who you are. This.", "Ivy: Because... [Sighs] We're the same. That's what we have in common. It's what I'm trying to tell you. I think it's what drew us together in the first place. I-I am getting serious with your brother. But before it goes any further and before you and Steffy go any further --", "Liam: We're engaged, Ivy.", "Ivy: Yes, I know that. But you're not married.", "Liam: What do you want?", "Ivy: I want... one more chance. [Sighs] I want you to give us one more chance."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=209bdcCbERM"}
