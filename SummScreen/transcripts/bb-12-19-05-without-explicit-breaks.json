        "Felicia: \r\nHe likes you, Bridget. ",
        "Bridget: He's adorable.\r\n",
        "Felicia: I had no idea \r\nwhat having Dominick would do to my life. Caring for him. Putting his needs \r\nbefore my own. Made me grow up. He's enriched my life in so many ways. And I \r\nknow that any family he's with will feel the same way. ",
        "Nick: Felicia. ",
        "Felicia: I just want to \r\ngive him the world, everything that a mom would like to give her son. But I \r\ncan't. ",
        "Nick: He will always be \r\nloved and cared for. ",
        "Felicia: Thank you. I'm \r\ngrateful for that. Dominick needs a mom's love, too. You know what I mean, \r\nBridget, don't you? ",
        "Bridget: I think we should \r\nprobably take Dominick home and put him to bed. ",
        "\r\n************************************************************",
        "Taylor: Yeah, I'm sorry to \r\ninterrupt. ",
        "Brooke: If you're here to \r\ntalk about business -- ",
        "Taylor: No, I would never \r\ncome to your home and discuss Forrester Creations. So beautiful. What a pretty \r\ntree! ",
        "Hope: I'm helping. \n",
        "Brooke: Honey, why don't \r\nyou go get the cookies that we made for Phoebe and Steffie? Catherine has them \r\nin the kitchen. ",
        "Hope: Okay. ",
        "Brooke: You must be \r\nexcited. Spending Christmas with your children after all these years. \n",
        "Taylor: Yes, yes I am. \r\nVery much. Actually, I was thinking about you and your children. ",
        "Brooke: We'll be fine.\r\n",
        "Taylor: Well, Thomas and \r\nthe girls had told me that they can't imagine spending the holidays without you. \r\nSo, I wanted to come by and see if maybe you would bring Hope, and R.J. and even \r\nBridget and Nick over for Christmas day. ",
        "\r\n***************************************************************",
        "Stephanie: There you are.\r\n",
        "Eric: Hey. Hi, honey.\r\n",
        "Felicia: Daddy, what?\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Sweetheart, I \r\nhad to tell him. He's your father. ",
        "Felicia: Well, actually, \r\nI'm glad you're both here. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you mean \r\nyou got the test results back? And? ",
        "Felicia: Good news and bad \r\nnews. Good news is, no chemo, I get to go home tomorrow. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, my god, \r\nthat's wonderful, honey. ",
        "Eric: So, the cancer's not \r\nspreading? ",
        "Felicia: Actually, it has. \r\nThat's the bad news. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, if the \r\ncancer has spread -- how can you come home? ",
        "Felicia: Because I've \r\ndecided not to do any chemotherapy, Mother. ",
        "Stephanie: Why? \n",
        "Felicia: There's no point. \r\nIt's too late. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************************",
        "Nick: I don't know why the \r\ndirections on these car seats are always in Japanese. I guess it's a good thing \r\nI speak Japanese. ",
        "Bridget: I can't do this. \r\nI just can't do this. ",
        "\r\n*****************************************************************",
        "Taylor: So, what do you \r\nthink? Do you think you could include us in your Christmas day plans? \n",
        "Brooke: I don't know what \r\nto say. I was wondering about Christmas this year, and how it would be, with \r\nEric and Stephanie at odds with each other about Forrester. ",
        "Taylor: Oh, I invited \r\nthem, too. It wouldn't be Christmas if it wasn't totally dysfunctional. \n",
        "Brooke: Oh. Well -- \r\nactually, I would like to spend Christmas with the children. ",
        "Taylor: I think it'd be \r\ngood for Hope. ",
        "Brooke: I think it'd be \r\ngood for everybody. ",
        "Taylor: Yeah, for \r\neveryone. ",
        "Brooke: What? ",
        "Taylor: You had told me \r\nbefore that you were over Ridge. And I guess I just didn't believe you. \n",
        "Brooke: And now? \n",
        "Taylor: I don't know. \r\nWe've been rivals for so long, I sometimes don't know how to see you any other \r\nway. ",
        "Brooke: I may not agree \r\nwith your vision for Forrester, but as mothers, I think we understand each \r\nother. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************************",
        "Nick: You're a big guy. \r\nBig, big, strong guy. You know, he seems to be doing pretty well. Probably \r\ngetting hungry about now, wouldn't you think? Bridget? ",
        "Bridget: You know, I \r\nreally wish that you could just look at this from my point of view. You know, my \r\nhusband's ex-girlfriend comes back from Paris with a baby who turns out to be \r\nhis. A minor detail that she's chosen to keep from him for god knows what \r\nreason. And that alone would be more than most people would ever, ever be able \r\nto deal with. But is that all that's in Felicia's surprise package? No, no, of \r\ncourse not. I go to the hospital with her to discover that the cancer that she \r\nthought was in remission is back. It's not only back, but it's so far advanced \r\nthat she's -- she's refusing treatment. Why wasn't this eradicated before, why \r\nhas it spread so much? Because Felicia refused radiation so she could -- have a \r\nhealthy baby. She chose to risk her own life so that her son could be healthy.\r\n",
        "Nick: It took a lot of \r\nstrength and courage to do that. ",
        "Bridget: I know, my god, \r\nshe's a saint. And all she's asking in return is that the baby's father and his \r\nnew wife just take Dominick in as their own. And it shouldn't bother the new \r\nwife -- it's really not a big deal. Especially not as big a deal as dealing with \r\nterminal cancer. ",
        "Nick: Bridget -- \n",
        "Bridget: Can't you see how \r\nthis makes me feel? I just feel like such a terrible, terrible person. It's just \r\ntoo much. It's just too much. ",
        "Nick: Honey, you are not a \r\nterrible person. And you're right, this is too much. It's too much for you and \r\nFelicia, and for little Dominick here. It's too much to ask of anybody. \n",
        "[ Baby fusses ] \n",
        "Nick: But I am his father.\r\n",
        "Bridget: I know. I don't \r\nhave a problem bringing him home for one night, but we both know that that's not \r\nwhat Felicia's asking. You are his father, and you have an obligation, and a \r\nvery special bond, but I'm not his mother. I don't even know if I can be. \n",
        "\r\n*****************************************************************",
        "Eric: You say there's no \r\npoint in doing the chemotherapy? I disagree. ",
        "Felicia: The cancer's \r\nspread. The chemo's not going to make a difference. ",
        "Stephanie: You can't give \r\nup. ",
        "Felicia: If I'd done the \r\nradiation six months ago, eight months ago -- but I knew then that if I \r\ncontinued treatment, then my son would've died. I chose him. That turned out to \r\nbe the best decision that I have ever made in my life. Bringing him into this \r\nworld, healthy, and watching him grow. I want to be here for him. I want to be \r\nhere with him forever, but I think I've run out of miracles. ",
        "Stephanie: I'm not going \r\nto let you give up now, Felicia. ",
        "[ Felicia chuckles ]\r\n",
        "Felicia: Mom, it's not up \r\nto you. ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it is. I'm \r\ngoing to talk to the doctors, there has to be some protocol, some procedure -- I \r\nmean, there's gotta be something experimental that they're doing that we just \r\ndon't know about right now. ",
        "Felicia: She couldn't \r\ncontrol my life, and now she thinks she's in charge of my death. ",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, that's \r\nthe only way she knows how. Why not try the chemo, give everybody some hope?\r\n",
        "Felicia: I know what it'll \r\ndo to me. I'll be exhausted, throwing up all the time. Hurting so much I won't \r\nbe able to hold my son, kiss him. I'll be robbing him of the life that I have \r\nleft. I'm sorry, daddy. I need to do this on my own terms. ",
        "\r\n**********************************************************",
        "Bridget: I'm so sorry. I \r\nknow you must be so disappointed in me. I'm having my own child. It's the most \r\nimportant thing it's ever happened to me. And now, I feel like it's just being \r\npushed aside for someone else's baby. I know that Dominick is going to be a part \r\nof your life. And a part of mine. But, what about -- what about our little girl? \r\nHow am I supposed to divide up the love that I have for her? Just the joy and \r\nthe excitement. I know that sounds so selfish. ",
        "Nick: No. It's not selfish \r\nat all. I mean, you're going to be a new mother -- it's a maternal instinct. You \r\nfeel as though your child should come first, it's understandable. ",
        "Bridget: I just really \r\nwanted the three of us to be a family, and I feel like -- it's just what I've \r\nbeen dreaming for and longing for, and I feel like it's just ruined. ",
        "Nick: It doesn't have to \r\nbe, you know. I know that you've got more than enough love for two children.\r\n",
        "Bridget: No, I don't want \r\nto love another child! I'm not ready. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************************",
        "Eric: Felicia? I still \r\ncan't believe that you have a little baby boy. ",
        "Felicia: You're going to \r\nlove him. He has the greatest smile. He has your smile. ",
        "Eric: Yeah? I'm sorry, for \r\nall the time that -- for all the time that you and I did not get to spend \r\ntogether. I want to make it up to you. ",
        "Felicia: Daddy, I think it \r\nwas supposed to happen the way it happened. If I hadn't gone off on my own, \r\nlived la vida loca, I wouldn't have Dominick. We can't beat ourselves up. Nobody \r\npromised us a bowl of cherries. ",
        "Eric: What did dr. Nomura \r\nsay? ",
        "Stephanie: He's a quack. \r\nI'm calling in another oncologist. How are you feeling? Can I get you anything? \r\nCan I do anything for you, honey? ",
        "Felicia: Yeah. It's \r\nChristmas. I'd like to have the best Christmas ever. Just like we used to have. \r\nWith the huge tree -- Christmas carols -- dad's terrible eggnog. You think you \r\nguys can do that for me? ",
        "Eric: Of course. What \r\nelse? ",
        "Felicia: I want Dominick \r\nto live with his father, and Bridget. I already spoke to Nick, he's willing. But \r\nI don't know if Bridget's ready for such a huge responsibility. ",
        "\r\n*********************************************************************",
        "Bridget: I just can't make \r\na life-changing decision like this in one day. ",
        "Nick: I agree. ",
        "Bridget: It's not fair to \r\nme, or to anybody. It's not -- what did you say? ",
        "Nick: I said I agree. I \r\nsay we take it one step at a time. We don't do anything until we're completely \r\nsure. Except, maybe, feed him, make sure he gets a good night's sleep. \n",
        "Bridget: You mean it?\r\n",
        "Nick: I mean it. \n",
        "[ Baby cries ] So, where's \r\nthe diaper bag? ",
        "Bridget: I left it in the \r\ncar. ",
        "Nick: Say \"see ya.\" We'll \r\nbe right back. ",
        "Bridget: Wait, wait. It's \r\nreally cold outside. Why don't you leave him with me? It's okay. Daddy will be \r\nright back. You know how much your daddy loves you? You don't understand \r\nanything I'm saying, do you? I don't know what to tell you, kiddo. I'm really \r\nsorry you're going to lose your mom. Okay, I have my own child to look after, \r\nthough. I have my own little girl. It's nothing against you, it's just that she \r\nbelongs to me. You don't. Dominick -- why do you have to be so sweet? So \r\ninnocent? No, it's not your fault. I really, really want to help you. But I \r\ncan't. I'm so sorry, but I can't. I think you're just going to have to live \r\nsomewhere else. ",
        "Nick: Hey. So, where do \r\nyou want to put him down? Listen, we're going to get through this. We'll get \r\nthrough it together. ",
        "Bridget: I don't think I \r\ncan. I can't. "
