Rick tells Ridge that the buyers will be here next week. Ridge is distracted. He says Rick would be too if he saw what he just saw \u0096 Quinn naked. Brooke tells Katie that she knows what Quinn is capable of and what if she means her latest threats. Katie says the last thing she wants to do is accuse Quinn and be wrong. Quinn and Eric lay in bed and she says miracle of miracles and he loves her despite her past. She wants their Christmas to be very special. He says yes but he does not want her to go overboard. She has given him so much already. She says it is a secret, but she may shower him with gifts. Ridge tells Rick that he knows his dad always wanted an outdoor shower so guess that is Eric's Christmas present. Rick is aghast when Ridge says Quinn was there as naked as the day she was born and not a care in this world and he felt vibes and it wasn't coming from him. He thinks Quinn was flirting with him. Rick tells him his ego is a wonder of wonders but every woman is not ready to jump in the sack with him. Even naked she still has all the power. Ridge says she could have run away but she stood there bold and brazen.", "Katie says she cannot tell Eric what she has on her phone as Quinn will deny it and Eric will get more stressful. Katie says she will keep the phone photo and have it if they need it. She will just let Quinn think she is her champion. Eric tells Quinn that some people think he is too old for her. She needs someone more like Ridge's age. She says no, Ridge does have his assets but even on his best days it does not compare with Eric. She says some mornings when she wakes up she is afraid she will look over and he won't be there, it will all be a dream. He means everything to her and she hopes that is not too much. Katie says she will not let Quinn get her clutches further into Eric. They will just have to be smart in how they pry him away from her."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["[Insects chirping]", "[Water trickling]", "[Cell phone chimes]", "Katie: [Sighs]", "Quinn: You know what? You should listen to this. Enjoy your time with Steffy. Liam, enjoy it. Because these days are gonna be your last. What do you think?", "Quinn: It's finished? Yep. Good to go.", "Quinn: [Chuckles] That is so great. You guys did this on such short notice. I didn't give you much time. No worries. Just want to make sure you're happy.", "Quinn: And my husband didn't see? No, ma'am.", "Quinn: [Chuckles] That's great. See, this is a Christmas present for him. He's always wanted an outdoor shower, and now he finally has one. You need anything else, just give us a call.", "Quinn: Thank you so much. It's wonderful. [Chuckles] Bye.", "Quinn: [Sighs] [Gasps] Yes. Oh!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: I'm back. R.J.'s emergency was easily resolved. So did you go see Eric while I was gone?", "Katie: [Sighs]", "Brooke: Are you okay?", "Katie: You know, I-I'm trying to respect Eric's choices. I really am. And he chose Quinn, whether we like it or not. I got to tell you, I'm starting to really not like it. But his feelings have to be considered, where his loyalties are.", "Brooke: Did something happen?", "Katie: [Sighs] You could say that. I overheard Quinn threatening Liam.", "[Water turns on]", "Quinn: [Squeals] [Sighs]", "Brooke: Wait a minute. You heard Quinn make an actual threat to Liam?", "Katie: I don't know. I mean, it wasn't specific. And then again, it kind of was. I'm just not sure.", "Brooke: You're not making sense. What did Quinn say?", "Katie: Okay, well, see for yourself.", "Brooke: You recorded them?", "Katie: Well, I just had my phone out and I reacted. Is that bad?", "Brooke: No, of course not. Play it.", "Quinn: Enjoy your time with Steffy. Liam, enjoy it. Because these days are gonna be your last.", "Brooke: [Sighs] That sounds like a threat to me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Water running]", "[Rustling]", "Quinn: Who's there? Eric? Is that you? If it is, don't come any closer. I don't want you to ruin the surpr-- Ridge. [Sighs] Well, the least you could do is hand me a towel.", "Quinn: [Sighs] [Turns water off] What are you doing, Ridge? You lurking in the bushes?", "Ridge: Came to see my dad, and I heard a noise out here.", "Quinn: Well, I think you need to be careful coming over unannounced. You never know what you're gonna walk in on. [Sighs] Did you come here to pick a fight?", "Ridge: Sure. Why not? Get dressed.", "Quinn: Why? You don't like what you see? I mean, come on, Ridge. Your lurking got you to see me in the buff. Aren't you excited for your dad, what he gets to come home to every night? You should be thanking me.", "Ridge: For what? Controlling my dad with sex? I don't think so.", "Quinn: Were you born cynical, or did you work really hard to get that way?", "Ridge: You know, I think it's probably a little bit of both. But the problem here is that you just don't inspire any optimism in people.", "Quinn: See, you have the wrong idea about me. I'm not that devious person anymore.", "Ridge: That's right. You don't do that anymore. It's all about love now. I don't buy any of it. You're just as scary as you ever were. Got to make sure you stay away from my dad.", "Quinn: Give it your best shot. You don't scare me, Ridge.", "Ridge: Maybe I should scare you. So what's all this?", "Quinn: It's your father's Christmas present. He's always wanted an outdoor shower. You didn't know that? I was just giving it a test run. You should try it. It's nice. The water's warm. Well, if you're not gonna be a gentleman and get me a towel... nighty night, Ridge.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: We can't just do nothing if she's really threatening Liam again.", "Katie: Yes, but was it a threat?", "Brooke: You heard her. \"Enjoy these days with Steffy, because these days are gonna be your last.\"", "Katie: Was she threatening to harm Liam or was she just saying that she was gonna try to break him and Steffy up so Wyatt can move in?", "Brooke: It's better to be safe than sorry.", "Katie: [Sighs] I don't know. This is just such a balancing act. I mean, I don't want to jeopardize my friendship with Eric. But Quinn is his wife, and she has more influence over him than anyone. I mean, if I accuse her of something and she's perfectly innocent...", "Brooke: Did she sound innocent to you while you were standing there listening to them, watching them?", "Katie: I don't know. I mean, she wasn't exactly breathing fire, but she can be hard to read sometimes.", "Brooke: And that is when she's the most dangerous. You don't know what to expect next. So what are you gonna do?", "Katie: [Sighs]", "Brooke: Are you gonna show Eric this video?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "[Door closes]", "Eric: Did you take a swim?", "Quinn: I really cannot say.", "Eric: I thought we were going to have no secrets from one another.", "Quinn: Oh, this one you're gonna like.", "Eric: [Sighs] I have no doubt. I love everything about you.", "Quinn: I'm gonna remind you of that.", "Eric: You won't have to. Come here, come here.", "[Both chuckle]", "Quinn: You okay?", "Eric: Am I okay? Yes, I'm okay. Why would you ask?", "Quinn: Well, 'cause you laid into Liam pretty hard, and I know you like him.", "Eric: I said some things to him that he needed to hear.", "Quinn: You took Wyatt's side.", "Eric: You and Wyatt are my family. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. You can always be able to depend on me defending you to anyone.", "Quinn: You have no idea how much that means to me.", "Eric: [Sighs] I think I do.", "Quinn: [Chuckles]", "Eric: You know how much it means to me to have you in this house with me, in this bedroom, wearing nothing but a towel?", "Quinn: Ohh. Well, you see, towels are overrated.", "Eric: Hmm.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Insects chirping]", "Rick: All right, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. The buyers from Paris will be here next week. Can you do lunch? Ridge?", "Ridge: What?", "Rick: You seem...off.", "Ridge: [Sighs] You would be, too, if you saw what I saw.", "Rick: Okay. You got me. I'll bite.", "Ridge: [Sighs] Your new stepmother...naked.", "Rick: [Scoffs] Quinn?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: If Quinn goes back to her old ways, Eric needs to know.", "Katie: We don't know that she is.", "Brooke: But the way she acted with you, and now she's threatening Liam.", "Katie: I don't know. That's what I thought at first. But after looking at this again, I'm not sure.", "Brooke: If Quinn is faking, if she's really the lunatic that we know her to be, then Eric is vulnerable. He's in that house alone with her.", "Katie: Yes, but I'm right next door, and I can keep an eye on things, but only if Quinn doesn't perceive me as a threat and try and cut me out of Eric's life.", "Brooke: Good point.", "Katie: And plus I'd like to believe that she has changed, that she truly loves Eric. I mean, I want him to be happy.", "Brooke: Nobody deserves it more than he does.", "Katie: The last thing I want to do is throw accusations at her and be wrong.", "Brooke: You know Quinn can talk her way around anything.", "Katie: And that's exactly what she'll do. She'll explain it away. She'll say it wasn't a threat, that all she meant is Liam's days with Steffy are numbered. And then I'm the bad guy, and I'm yet another person persecuting Eric's beloved wife.", "Brooke: And what if she means it? Quinn is nuts. We've seen that. She tried to hurt Liam once. What if she tries to do it again? Or something worse?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Can you believe it's almost Christmas? This year has flown by.", "Eric: They do that, don't they?", "Quinn: [Chuckles] Yeah, well, this was one for the record books, though. This is the year that everything...everything changed. I mean, I had given up on so much, and then all of a sudden, there you were, right where you had been all along.", "Eric: And I was so glad to be able to see you.", "Quinn: Hmm. You did. You saw all of me. And miracle of miracles, you loved me anyway.", "Eric: [Chuckles] Easiest thing I ever did.", "Quinn: I want our first Christmas together to be really special.", "Eric: Mm-hmm. But I don't want you going overboard with presents for me.", "Quinn: Would I do that?", "Eric: Yes, you would. I want you to know it's completely unnecessary. You've given me so much already. More than I -- more than I ever thought I would have.", "Quinn: Well, lucky for me, you're not the boss of me, and I have every intention of giving my husband something special for our first Christmas together. In fact... I may shower you with gifts.", "Eric: Shower me with this.", "Quinn: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Rick: Just -- just back it up a second. You saw Quinn naked?", "Ridge: I can't unsee it.", "Rick: You're gonna have to explain.", "Ridge: Explain what? I was going over to Dad's to talk to him about Steffy and her being C.E.O., and I heard a noise in the backyard --", "Rick: Get to the important -- \"Quinn being naked\" part!", "Ridge: And I saw her in the backyard taking a shower.", "Rick: Well, there's no shower in the backyard. Dad's always wanted one, but...", "Ridge: How am I the only one that didn't know that? Well, there is one now. She had one installed by the pool for Dad's Christmas present. I guess she just wanted to give it a trial run.", "Rick: You saw her. Unbelievable.", "Ridge: It is unbelievable, but there, um... there's more.", "Rick: Really? Well, I hate to ask.", "Ridge: I got this feeling, this -- and don't -- hmm. There was some weird vibe between us.", "Rick: Oh. Yeah, I get it now. The irresistible Ridge Forrester. Well, I hate to burst your inflated ego, but Quinn is completely committed to Dad.", "Ridge: So she says.", "Rick: Really? You -- you think that she was coming on to you?", "Ridge: I don't know. Something was -- something was happening there, and it wasn't coming from me. I can't stand that woman.", "Rick: That's pretty vague, Ridge.", "Ridge: Well, she's not gonna be obvious about it. She was standing there naked as the day she was born, and she didn't have a care in the world. So yes. I think she was flirting with me.", "Rick: [Chuckles]", "Rick: Seriously, Ridge, your ego is something of a wonder. There's no way she'd be flirting with you. She can't stand you, either.", "Ridge: I'm not making this up.", "Rick: No, honestly, every woman you meet casually you think is ready to jump in the sack with you.", "Ridge: Now you're just quoting historical facts. No, I know signals when I see them.", "Rick: I don't buy it. Quinn would have to be crazy to flirt with you. Well, yes, there is that. But still, I don't see it. Maybe she was messing with you. Even naked Quinn has all the power.", "Ridge: Maybe.", "Rick: You don't think so?", "Ridge: I don't know. I think you're right. She should have run away when she saw me. But she didn't. She stood there bold and brazen. Maybe she's more unhinged than we give her credit for.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I think we should hold off on showing Eric this, at least for right now. He's gonna believe whatever spin she puts on this, and then he's gonna question my motives and become distrustful.", "Brooke: And we don't want that. But don't erase it. We might need it someday.", "Katie: Oh, no, no. I'm gonna keep it. And hopefully -- hopefully we never have to use it. But in the meantime, we should just keep this between us.", "Brooke: Agreed. Are we really giving Quinn the benefit of the doubt?", "Katie: [Sighs] I don't know. I mean, she does really seem to love him. The marriage seems solid.", "Brooke: I hope that's not wishful thinking.", "Katie: Well, we both know what opposing Quinn has done to Eric's relationships with his family. If I'm banished, then I'm ineffective. So I've got to play along. I've got to let Quinn think that I'm her champion. But I'm never gonna forget just how dangerous that woman is.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: On second thought, I think we should spend our first Christmas together in bed. All day, all night.", "Eric: That might be a little ambitious for a person as old as I am.", "Quinn: Oh, get out of here!", "Eric: [Laughs] No, I mean it. Some people say I'm too old for you. That you would be more suited to a younger man, someone, say, ridge's age.", "Quinn: No. Well, to be fair, he has his assets, but even on his best day, he doesn't compare to you. You are so much more than a pretty face. You are kind and warm and charming and funny, and you've just enough old-school charm to make a woman feel like a queen.", "Eric: You are my queen.", "Quinn: I know. Another amazing thing is the confidence you've given me in myself and our love. Do you know that sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I'm afraid to look over at your side of the bed? I'm afraid that you're not gonna be there, that none of this happened, that it was just this big, beautiful dream.", "Eric: Here. You feel this? This is me. This is you and me in this room, in this house together. This is real. This is us. This is our life, and nobody will ever take this away.", "Quinn: You mean everything to me, Eric. I hope that's not too much.", "Eric: I can take all the love you have to give. Don't hold back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Quinn's got Eric in her clutches.", "Brooke: That needs to change.", "Katie: Agreed. We just have to be smart about how we pry him away from her."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne", "By e- by e."], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRc2d6i_QjA"}
