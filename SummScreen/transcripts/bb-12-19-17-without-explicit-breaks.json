        "Maya: Oh! It is her absolute favorite. She literally will only let rick and me read her that book every night. En fran\u00e7ais, of course.",
        "Nicole: Well, you better watch out because soon she will be reading it to you and rick. En fran\u00e7ais, of course.",
        "Maya: Oui, but of course! [ Laughs ] She's -- oh! Steffy! I'm so sorry, going on and on with this mommy talk. I just can't help it sometimes.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, personally, i think it's brilliant, but the project's my baby, so I'm kind of biased.",
        "Liam: What did you say?",
        "Wyatt: What -- which part?",
        "Liam: About a baby?",
        "Wyatt: Dude, what is with you? You've had that goofy grin ever since you walked in here this morning, and you've been majorly distracted.",
        "Liam: I'm -- no, I'm just... I'm, um... okay, um, so, I have news, but we're not telling anyone yet. It's just that you're my brother and I want you to know.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Liam: You have to promise me you're not gonna tell this to anyone.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my god, seriously? If you don't tell me, I'm gonna punch you.",
        "Liam: Okay. We're welcoming a new spencer into the world.",
        "Bill: To what do I owe the displeasure, forrester?",
        "Ridge: Well, there's something I think you should know.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I could really care less if a-lines are back in fashion.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Steffy's C.E.O. Cover -- that's pretty old, why do you have that?",
        "Bill: She's my daughter-in-law, and I own the magazine.",
        "Ridge: All right. I'm just gonna say it to you straight. I asked brooke to marry me, and she accepted.",
        "Brooke: Sorry I missed will!",
        "Katie: Oh, don't be. I'm sure you'll see him a lot over the holidays. So, uh, not that there needs to be, but is there any special reason for this surprise visit?",
        "Brooke: Well, I wanted you to know. Ridge proposed, and I accepted.",
        "[ Laughs ]",
        "Katie: Wow. Well, congratulations. I'm happy for you.",
        "Brooke: Once my divorce is final...",
        "Katie: You'll proudly wear ridge's ring.",
        "Brooke: [ Chuckles ] Are you surprised I said yes?",
        "Katie: [ Laughs ] No. No. I always figured that you and ridge would end up together.",
        "Brooke: Wow. This is a little bit big for will, isn't it?",
        "Katie: Um... [ Chuckles nervously ] Yeah. Uh, well, I guess since we're... sharing things, I can confide in you. Um... wyatt and I have become involved with each other.",
        "Brooke: [ Gasps ]",
        "Wyatt: [ Laughs ] Steffy's -- steffy's pregnant?",
        "Liam: We just found out yesterday during an exam, and it's -- and it's really early, but...",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, that explains why you haven't told anybody yet.",
        "Liam: Well, and also, I mean, you know steffy's history, which is why we're keeping it on the dl. I hope this doesn't upset you.",
        "Wyatt: Dude, come on. This is awesome.",
        "Liam: Yeah? Yeah?",
        "Wyatt: Congrats, bro. You and steffy are gonna have a family.",
        "Liam: I know, right? This is crazy.",
        "Maya: Did I tell you? Lizzy's play group is coming over tomorrow, and word on the street is that santa is going to make an appearance.",
        "Nicole: Santa, as in...?",
        "Maya: Yes. Rick has been practicing his \"ho, ho, hos\" for the last week, out of earshot of lizzy, naturally. So...you'll be there?",
        "Nicole: Just try to keep me away.",
        "Maya: Okay.",
        "Nicole: These are the moments that families live for. And the moments that hopefully zende and I can share with our little girl or boy one day.",
        "Maya: Aww, sweetie, it'll happen. I know it. Right, steffy?",
        "Steffy: Oh, I'm sorry, what?",
        "Maya: I'm -- I am so sorry. I'm being completely insensitive going on and on about my little girl.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no, no. You're not.",
        "Maya: You know, it's hard around the holidays not to share the joy that my husband and i have found raising our child.",
        "Ridge: You knew this was gonna happen the moment you received those divorce papers. Something else going on with you, or...?",
        "Bill: I don't owe you any explanation, forrester. Especially when you're tacky enough to come over here gloating.",
        "Ridge: Come on, man, I'm not gloating, I just wanted you to know what was going on.",
        "Bill: Well, message received. You can go now. Sign the papers, would you? Are you dragging this out because you think brooke's gonna come back to you? She's not. She's moved on, and so should you.",
        "Katie: Say something. Say anything.",
        "Brooke: [ Gasps ] I'm at a loss. I'm totally... you and wyatt?",
        "Katie: [ Giggles ] Yeah.",
        "Brooke: How?",
        "Katie: Well, I guess it all started with the fashion challenge in monte carlo, and we were working day and night, you know, putting in a lot of really long hours, and... I guess we just kind of got to know each other better and respect each other, and we laughed a lot, and... after the success in monte carlo, it just kind of... happened.",
        "Brooke: You and wyatt.",
        "Katie: Yeah, believe me, i was -- I was hesitant to get involved at first because... well, there are a lot of obvious reasons for me not to, but... when I'm with him, it just... feels right.",
        "Wyatt: Did you pick a name yet?",
        "Liam: What, are you kidding me? It's been like 24 hours. We're still getting used to the idea of even being parents. Also, I don't know if it's a boy or girl yet.",
        "Wyatt: True. How's steffy? I mean, she's probably pretty stoked, huh?",
        "Liam: Honestly, I've never seen her this emotional. I mean, it makes sense if you think about it. She's carrying our child again.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Liam: Truth is, we're being cautiously optimistic because there's still so many things that can go wrong that are out of our control, but I'm just -- I'm not... I'm not thinking about that.",
        "Wyatt: Look, one thing is for certain, all right? Boy or girl, doesn't matter. That kid is gonna be really lucky to have you guys as parents. And dad as a grandpa. I mean, wait till he finds out steffy's pregnant. I can't wait to see his reaction.",
        "Liam: [ Laughing ] I know!",
        "Wyatt: Man...",
        "Bill: So, does brooke know you're doing this?",
        "Ridge: Doing what?",
        "Bill: Well, that you're here giving me the 411 on your... impending nuptials instead of brooke doing it herself. I guess that's just an indication that those, uh, well-known insecurities are still raging.",
        "Ridge: [ Laughs ] No. No insecurities here. Brooke and I are gonna get married.",
        "Bill: Well, you must have done quite a number on her for brooke to put herself back in the line of fire for more heartbreak. Which is inevitable, considering your somewhat dodgy track record when it comes to commitment.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's funny coming from you... 'cause you know all about about indiscretions, don't you?",
        "Nicole: All right, we're agreed, then. I will touch base with katie, we'll coordinate forrester's latest campaign in the states with ours at international.",
        "Steffy: Great. When are you heading back to paris? Not that we're anxious to see you go.",
        "Maya: Well, I know someone who's anxious. I'm sure zende must be missing you like crazy.",
        "Nicole: I miss him like crazy.",
        "Maya: Aww. So, that's everything. Steffy! Are you okay?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. There's just a lot on my mind.",
        "Nicole: What to get liam for christmas?",
        "Steffy: [ Chuckles ] I've already taken care of that. At least I hope I have. Thanks, you two.",
        "[ Door opens, closes ]",
        "Steffy: [ Groaning ]",
        "Liam: Keep pushing, steffy. Come on, keep pushing! Steffy, you're almost there. You're almost there.",
        "Liam: You're doing so great. Keep going! Almost! One more push! One more push!",
        "Liam: One more, one more. Oh!",
        "Steffy: [ Panting ]",
        "Liam: Oh, my god! Oh, my god! You did it! You did it!",
        "Steffy: [ Panting ] Liam? Liam, what's the problem? Liam, what's wrong? What's wrong? What the hell is this?",
        "Bill: [ Fussing ]",
        "Steffy: [ Screaming ]",
        "Liam: My father? My father?!",
        "Steffy: No! No, I can explain! I can explain! Liam, liam, please, come back!",
        "[ Gasps ] [ Panting ] Oh, my god.",
        "Katie: I've kept this secret for so long, it just feels... good to tell someone about it. He's this young, hot guy, and it's kind of scandalous. I mean, it sounds like something that you might do, and have. I guess I just didn't understand it before.",
        "Brooke: [ Laughs ] So, who else knows?",
        "Katie: Uh, eric and quinn. As you can imagine, quinn's not super thrilled about it, but she's promised wyatt that she won't say anything, and so far, so good.",
        "Brooke: What about bill?",
        "Katie: [ Chuckles ] No. No, bill doesn't know. Though I'm sure we won't be able to keep it from him indefinitely.",
        "Brooke: So, where do you see all of this going?",
        "Katie: I don't know. I don't really care at this point, you know? Wyatt and I are having fun together, and at some point, he might want to go and have fun with someone else, and maybe i might want to do the same thing, you know? Some other sexy stud to have fun with.",
        "Brooke: [ Giggles ]",
        "Katie: But right now... being with him has been really good for me. And the sex is off-the-charts amazing, but he's also funny and smart, and so it's not all about that.",
        "Brooke: [ Giggles ] Are you sure there's not more to this than just a casual relationship?",
        "Wyatt: So, you'll let me know when I can spread the word, right? 'Cause I'm telling everybody.",
        "Liam: I expect nothing less.",
        "Wyatt: [ Laughs ]",
        "Liam: Yeah, and in the meantime, just stay positive for me.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, dude, of course. I mean, you got to, as well, and, you know, you just got to be there for her.",
        "Liam: Oh, uh, no problem on that front. I'm gonna pamper the hell out of steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Well, good. I'm happy for you, man. And dad will be, too, when you decide to tell him.",
        "Liam: I am so happy that things are good between dad and me now. I mean, especially since we're gonna give him a grandchild.",
        "Bill: Okay, well, I'm sure that travel sewing kit's burning a hole in your pocket, so if you have to make your way back to the dress farm...",
        "Ridge: Mm. You know what, one more thing. It's about steffy.",
        "Bill: What about her?",
        "Ridge: I think it would make her very happy if her father and her father-in- law would get along a little better. It was impossible before, but now that brooke has come to her senses...",
        "Bill: Okay, you got that one last shot in, so bye.",
        "Ridge: Can't always have the woman you want, can you?",
        "[ Cellphone rings ]",
        "Bill: Hello?",
        "Steffy: Bill, uh... I need to speak with you.",
        "Bill: Okay. You want to meet at my office?",
        "Steffy: No, uh, somewhere more private. Your house.",
        "Bill: See you soon. All right, forrester, well, you've, uh, certainly overstayed your welcome.",
        "Ridge: Sign the papers.",
        "[ Door opens, closes ]",
        "Liam: I almost can't believe this. That is our child in there. We did that. It's ours. Our baby.",
        "Katie: I'm not sure where any of this is going. What I am sure of is that i don'T... I don't want to give him up. We have so much fun together, and... and he can't keep his hands off me, which is awesome.",
        "Brooke: Really?",
        "Katie: Okay, don't act so shocked. I mean, I know it must be unusual to hear these words coming out of my mouth, but i like feeling this way. You know? I'm not thinking too much. I'm not planning ahead. I feel free and uninhibited, at least I do behind closed doors with wyatt. And I'm glad I was able to tell you. It feels good to have someone to trust with this.",
        "Brooke: Of course you can trust me. I'm just worried. That's all. I mean, what if bill finds out? It could get ugly. Just be careful, okay?",
        "Katie: I will. But, honestly, I don't hear too much from bill these days. I mean, do you even know what's going on with him, besides the divorce?",
        "Liam: Hey, babe, it's me. Just, um.. just checking in, making sure the mommy- to-be's okay. And, uh, yeah, that's it. That's it. I'll, um... I'll talk to you later. Call me when you get a chance. I love you. Bye.",
        "Wyatt: There it is, that goofy grin again. Dude, I -- I seriously can't help it. I just -- I keep on thinking about that moment, that.. like, finding out I'm gonna be a father. A father! I seriously think that was the greatest moment of my life.",
        "Bill: What's going on? Why'd you need to see me?",
        "Steffy: Are you alone?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Something up with liam? Is that it?",
        "Steffy: [ Sighs ] Okay, uh... first of all, I want you to know that liam and I are happy. We're happy together, and, uh... he told me he wants to put everything behind us, so we are. I mean, I was going to until, um...",
        "Bill: Until what?",
        "Steffy: I had a doctor's appointment. It was just a check-up, but then, uh... the doctor came in... and told me something I was never expecting.",
        "Bill: What'd the doctor say? Steffy, what'd the doctor say? Come on. You're scaring me. Are you sick? Is that it?",
        "Steffy: No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. Physically -- physically, I'm fine.",
        "Bill: Then what?",
        "Steffy: Liam showed up at the appointment, and I was waiting for test results, and then the doctor came in, and the doctor said something I... something that I've been wanting to hear for years. Uh, she told me... I'm pregnant.",
        "Bill: You're... you're pregnant?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Bill: You're -- you're pregnant. Wow. [ Laughing ] Wow. I'm gonna be a grandfather. Congratulations. I hope that you and liam have a happy and healthy baby.",
