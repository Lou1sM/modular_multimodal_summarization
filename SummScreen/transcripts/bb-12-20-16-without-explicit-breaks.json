        "Bill grouses to Liam that to not make him drive over here again for reports. Liam figures his lousy mood has to do with Brooke. Bill says yes they should be married and celebrating their first Christmas together. The subject gets around to Quinn and Liam says she has not changed and never will. He is not saying things are solid with him and Steffy but they are trying hard to work on it without more interference. Ridge, Steffy and Rick talk and Ridge tells them that Wyatt is the ultimate prize as Quinn wants him back with Steffy. She tells them she is on full alert and she is no longer worried about Quinn now that she is CEO and even working with Quinn won't bother her. A Quinn mine field, she will deal with it. Quinn tells Wyatt that Eric is on his side so she does not think after what Eric told Liam recently that he has a chance with Steffy. Wyatt tells Quinn not to get ahead of herself. Pretty much all Eric can do is cheerlead for him; Steffy is still going for the divorce. He says he appreciates them supporting him but there is a fine line between supporting and meddling and he'd like her to back off. He changes the subject and asks about her Christmas present to Eric. She thinks back to the shower scene with Ridge and says it is a present that just keeps on giving and will leave it at that. Bill tells Liam that Eric needs to stay out of this. He leaves just as Steffy returns to Liam's. He states to Steffy that now Eric is targeting their relationship. Liam fills her in on what Eric said about his waffling and it is just Quinn talking and putting ideas in his head.",
        "Rick laughs and says it sounds like Ridge has never seen a naked lady before. Ridge says yes, many \u0096 but he was not expecting this particular one. Wyatt calls Steffy and explains to her that he and Nicole have something exciting set up and he will get back to her later when she has more time to discuss it about social media. Liam reminds her that again this is Quinn making sure it remains that way that Wyatt and Steffy will always be working together. He sees her tattoo ring not faded yet and she says yes she has been so busy she missed her last meeting with the doctor. Liam rants on with his song and dance about Quinn pulling the strings and how Eric said Steffy's future does not include him. She tells him she does want to be with him and especially during this time of year. He says she knows how much he loves the holidays but he is so dreading the day at Eric's house with Quinn's photo over the fireplace and Eric's constant reminder they have no future. Quinn meets up with Ridge and gloats that she knows seeing her in the outdoor shower was the highlight of his day but she will not tell Brooke. Then she challenges him to compare her bod with all those models he has worked with in stages of undress over the years. He complies that she has a nice body so she should go home for Christmas and take care of it. She replies that he can be Grinch if he wants to but she will not let him take away her holiday spirit. This is her first Christmas as Mrs. Eric Forrester. Ridge adds .. and her last, count on it."

        "Rick: You know, I have to admit, I'm still having trouble with this.",
        "Steffy: I didn't lobby to be C.E.O., Rick. It was Granddad's decision.",
        "Ridge: Well, you know that Quinn put that idea into Granddad's head. Please don't misunderstand. We all think you're incredibly talented, and no one knows this company better than you do. But you just don't have the experience that I have or that rick has. I mean, if it weren't for Quinn, we --",
        "Steffy: Look, I don't like it, either, but there are benefits to me being in charge. By pooling my shares with Granddad, we could have a lock on the company, and we can keep Quinn in check. She's president, Steffy. We're co- vice president. She could pull rank any time.",
        "Steffy: Can we just look at the upside for one minute? We don't have to deal with Bill Spencer anymore. His shares are essentially insignificant now.",
        "Rick: Yeah, well, that's still some cold comfort given that everything's been turned on its head around here.",
        "Steffy: I know how this feels for both of you. You wanted to run this company. And we will all run it, together.",
        "Rick: Under you. You're C.E.O. and the princess of darkness is not far behind you. Her son, either.",
        "Wyatt: And the orders just keep pouring in.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] Can I say I'm not surprised without sounding conceited?",
        "Wyatt: No. The jewelry pass at the fashion show definitely spiked interest, and it just continues to grow and grow.",
        "Quinn: Well, if this keeps going on, I've got to say that even my staunchest critics here are gonna have to concede that I am good for this company.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, if you're talking about Ridge and rick...",
        "Quinn: I'm not even high on Pam's list, but I am determined to win them all over.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Well, orchestrating Steffy's promotion to C.E.O. Didn't exactly help your cause.",
        "Quinn: Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't orchestrate anything.",
        "Wyatt: Oh.",
        "Quinn: I didn't. I merely suggested to Eric what you and I already know -- that Steffy would be great in this job.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, she would. She would definitely make a damn good C.E.O.",
        "Quinn: Spoken like a loyal and loving husband.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, st-- okay. It's too bad time is running out on my marriage, mom. I mean, if I'm gonna fix things with Steffy, I got to do something soon.",
        "Quinn: Well, it's a good thing you have even more support for you. Eric is on your side.",
        "Liam: All right, what else?",
        "Bill: That's it. Don't make me freakin' drive all the way out here again, capishe?",
        "Liam: Admit it -- you want the excuse to get out of the office.",
        "Bill: I don't need an excuse. It's my company. I can do anything.",
        "Liam: I don't suppose this, um...mood your in has anything to do with the Brooke situation.",
        "Bill: We should be married, celebrating our first Christmas together. But instead, she's back with that poseur. And why? Because he used their son to guilt trip her.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. I get that. But you -- you know, how much R.J. Means to Brooke.",
        "Bill: Well, of course I know. She's a loving, caring mother. Having said that, if R.J. Hadn't come home and Ridge didn't use the family angle to -- forget it. I'm done rehashing it.",
        "Liam: Does that mean you're done with Brooke?",
        "Bill: Hell no. I'm not giving up on Brooke.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Yeah, I know the feeling.",
        "Bill: I see somebody else is in a mood. What's going on?",
        "Steffy: Wyatt had no idea Granddad was gonna tap him for head of P.R.",
        "Rick: My concern is not Wyatt. It's about how this executive team works together and moves forward with Quinn as president, still wielding power and has Dad's ear.",
        "Steffy: I have his ear now, too.",
        "Ridge: Not like Quinn. Your grandfather is becoming her puppet.",
        "Rick: She's so transparent. Why can't Dad see that?",
        "Ridge: Why? 'Cause he doesn't want to see it. What he wants to see is Quinn handing over power to Steffy. Just a selfless act. But it's not, is it? She wants to be accepted by this family.",
        "Rick: I don't ever see that happening.",
        "Ridge: I don't see that, either. What she really wants is for Steffy and Wyatt to get back together. That's the ultimate prize. You do see that, right?",
        "Quinn: You should've heard Eric. What he said to Liam when your brother stormed over to my house last night on his high horse...",
        "Wyatt: What are you talking about, mom?",
        "Quinn: He was spouting accusations, throwing his usual shade at me, in front of my husband.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you mean like how you maneuvered Eric into promoting Steffy to C.E.O.?",
        "Quinn: And how I'm playing matchmaker with you and Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: But you are playing matchmaker.",
        "Quinn: Well, the point is...",
        "Wyatt: Uh-huh.",
        "Quinn: ...Okay, Eric told Liam that he thinks it's wrong that he's living with Steffy. He says he supports your marriage, and thinks Liam should back off.",
        "Wyatt: Steffy's Granddad actually said that on the record?",
        "Quinn: And I got to tell you, with Eric on your side, I don't think Liam is gonna be with Steffy much longer.",
        "Bill: You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Liam: Nope. Eric is, uh, pushing for Wyatt and Steffy to stay married. He's 100% in their corner.",
        "Bill: It's none of his damn business.",
        "Liam: I know that, but Eric and Wyatt have this whole bonding thing going on right now, which was, of course, encouraged by Quinn. And now that Steffy's C.E.O., Quinn thinks she can seal the deal by having Eric weigh in. It's -- it's...",
        "Bill: Steffy's always had a soft spot for the old guy.",
        "Liam: I know. Which Quinn isn't above exploiting. And Eric's going right along with it. Now, I'm not saying -- I'm not saying it's working, 'cause Steffy and I are solid, but it does kind of prove, again, that Quinn hasn't changed, and she never will.",
        "Steffy: At this point, I don't care about Quinn's motives. I know what she's capable of. I'm on full alert.",
        "Rick: That would be okay if it was anyone but Quinn or the future of the company wasn't at stake.",
        "Steffy: Listen, I'm well aware of everything that's at stake, but I have a track record, too, just like you guys. I helped save Forrester years ago from bill Spencer. I helped make the intimates line as profitable as ever. And now I have this social-media presence, thanks to Wyatt and Nicole. I have a younger, broader demographic. I think I've really proven myself.",
        "Ridge: You have proven yourself. But I'm worried about you walking into a Quinn mine field.",
        "Steffy: And I'll deal with it just like any competent Forrester C.E.O. would. Now, I have to go. I got to talk to Liam.",
        "Rick: I'm sure Liam's not that happy with you working that closely to Quinn and Wyatt, either.",
        "Bill: Eric needs to stay out of it, remain impartial.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, tell that to him. He says I'm incapable of happiness, and why would he want that for his granddaughter.",
        "Bill: All right, that crosses the line, and I know all about crossing the line.",
        "Liam: I know. I know that. But what am I gonna do? I'm gonna take it personally? It's not him talking, Dad. It's Quinn. The man has always respected and supported me. This is just Quinn working her dark magic on him. And now, because she wants to protect Wyatt and Steffy's marriage, that's what Eric wants, too. Just... it shows you how good she is, and it shows you how she's just as dangerous as ever.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Don't get ahead of yourself here, mom. Steffy is still divorcing me.",
        "Quinn: Yes, but now you have her grandfather cheering for you, too.",
        "Wyatt: And I appreciate that, but that's pretty much all he can do is cheerlead.",
        "Quinn: Really?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: He sent her tattoo-removal doctor away.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Quinn: Before he had the chance to keep his appointment with Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Mom, look. I appreciate how much you and Eric are supporting this whole thing, but there's a fine line between supporting and meddling, where you're concerned, and usually it ends up bad for me. So could you just back off, please? And while we're at it, can we change the subject? What are you getting Eric for Christmas?",
        "Quinn: Who's there?",
        "[Shower running]",
        "Quinn: Ridge. Well, if you're not gonna be a gentleman and give me a towel... nighty-night, Ridge. Let's just say it's the gift that keeps on giving, and we'll leave it at that.",
        "Rick: Steffy's foolish to think that she can handle Quinn. That woman's unpredictable. You never know what she's gonna do.",
        "Ridge: Sure don't. May just find her taking a shower naked in your dad's backyard.",
        "Bill: How does Steffy feel about Eric's blind support of her and Wyatt?",
        "Liam: I, uh... haven't told her.",
        "Bill: Why not?",
        "Liam: I will, I will. I just don't want to sound insecure.",
        "Bill: You're not being insecure. You're being smart, wary, as anyone should be when dealing with that black cat.",
        "Steffy: Bill, hey. I didn't realize you'd be here.",
        "Bill: Uh, I was just leaving. Hang in there.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Steffy: You said you wanted to talk to me? What's up?",
        "Liam: Uh... the ushe. Quinn and your grandfather. Now they're targeting our relationship.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] And you act like you've never seen a naked woman before.",
        "Ridge: Oh, Ricky... no, I've seen a few. I just didn't expect to see this particular one naked.",
        "Rick: [Laughing]",
        "Ridge: You're laughing? You think that's funny? I think she was flirting with me.",
        "Rick: I think it's crazy.",
        "Ridge: I think she's crazy.",
        "Rick: Well, yes.",
        "Quinn: Hey, I'm looking for Steffy.",
        "Rick: She's not here.",
        "Ridge: She went home to speak with Liam.",
        "Steffy: What do you mean my granddad's targeting us?",
        "Liam: You know I went over there, right?",
        "Steffy: Okay. What happened?",
        "Liam: What happened? Well, uh... Eric sure didn't pull any punches. He said I'm no good at relationships and Wyatt is. He said I don't keep my commitments and Wyatt does. He basically just regurgitated all the same lines Quinn has used over the years to justify her meddling. But the thing is, you know, I know he knows it's more complicated than that, and his new wife is the biggest reason why.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, yourself, Mrs. C.E.O. I just wanted to give you a heads-up that Nicole is helping me set up a photo session for the social-media campaign. I just kind of figured we'd capitalize on your new status at the company and amp up excitement with your fans. Sound good?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, sounds good. I, um... hey, I'm just in the middle of something.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I-I'll let you get back to whatever. But know that I'm always thinking about you -- what's, uh, best for you.",
        "Steffy: Okay, thanks. Bye. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: See... that's what bothers me. Now that he's working at Forrester, Wyatt is just constantly gonna be in your life.",
        "Steffy: Liam --",
        "Liam: Which is why Quinn lobbied Eric to make him head of P.R.",
        "Steffy: My grandfather said that never happened.",
        "Liam: You really think he would admit if it did and cast his wife in an even worse light?",
        "Steffy: Okay, baby, I understand how you feel. But the truth is, Wyatt is still in my life. We're still married.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] I know -- I know. Believe me, I know. And Quinn and Eric are doing everything they can to keep it that way.",
        "Rick: I've, uh...got some calls to make. I'll leave you two kids alone, right?",
        "Ridge: Well, I should be going, too.",
        "Quinn: Oh, no, not on my account, I hope. What? Oh, let me guess. You're still thinking about last night.",
        "Liam: It's still there.",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah. I just -- I've been kind of busy. The tattoo-removal doctor slipped my mind.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, you're busy 'cause you're C.E.O., Which would be awesome if we didn't both know it's part of this elaborate setup. Eric... the thing is, Eric is doing so many things that are unlike him, like taking sides and making judgments and stacking the deck. The Eric I knew would never have done any of that. He was fair, and he was impartial, and he listened. He didn't make these sweeping pronouncements like, \"your time is over, Liam. Steffy's future doesn't include you.\"",
        "Steffy: Wait. My grandfather actually said that?",
        "Liam: Yeah. 'Cause Quinn's pulling his strings. And if anybody calls her on it, she gives the whole song and dance about how much she's changed and how she's a different person because of Eric's love. And then, of course, he comes to her rescue and on and on...",
        "Steffy: You're really upset about my grandfather.",
        "Liam: No, I... I know he loves you. It's just, it's your life. It's our life.",
        "Steffy: Exactly. And this is where I want to be -- with you. And especially during this time of year.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] [Sighs] You know how much I love the holidays.",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: But, honestly, part of me is dreading Christmas at the Forrester house. You've got -- you've got that picture of Quinn right above the fireplace. It's just a constant reminder of everything she's done to us. And then you've got Eric, like, explicitly telling us he's trying to end our relationship.",
        "Steffy: Shh. Just forget about Quinn and Wyatt and everything else that's going on. This is our first holiday back together. And so many more. Hey. What's better than that?",
        "Ridge: Seeing you naked was --",
        "Quinn: Was the highlight of your day. You can admit it. I won't tell Brooke.",
        "Ridge: Leave Brooke out of this.",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. I'm not gonna run to your precious Logan and out you as a peeping Tom.",
        "Ridge: Peeping Tom?",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: You know, if I want to peep on someone, it wouldn't be this.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Didn't look that way to me.",
        "Ridge: No? You really are delusional, aren't you?",
        "Quinn: Whatever. But there is one thing I'm dying to know.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Quinn: Okay. After all these years of you being around these beautiful models in various stages of undress... how do I rate?",
        "Ridge: Wow. Real men don't rate women. It's demeaning.",
        "Quinn: But if they did and it wasn't, now that you've seen me au naturel and you know what your father comes home to every night --",
        "Ridge: Okay. Can I stop you right there, please? You're a very attractive woman with a really nice body. You obviously take care of it.",
        "Quinn: Thank you, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: You're very welcome. And my dad has always fallen for women like you. The good news is, it never lasts. Come on. It's Christmas. Go home and enjoy that shower with my dad. [Sighs] And now I have that image in my head.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Well, you could be a grumpy old Grinch, but you're not gonna dampen my yuletide spirit or take away the significance of how important this holiday is for me, because it is my first as Mrs. Eric Forrester.",
        "Ridge: And...your last. Count on it.",
