        "Bill is stunned \u0096 Steffy pregnant, he wants her to be sure. She says yes, she and Liam have been wanting a baby for a long time. He says great but there is a possibility that child is his. Steffy nixes that. She says she and Liam having been wanting a child for years and she and Bill were only together one time so it just can't be his. Bill says she is hiding her head in the sand as it can happen. Steffy panics and says even if it is she will lose Liam anyway. Liam reinforces to Wyatt why they want to just stay quiet for a while until the pregnancy is further along. Losing his first baby was devastating. They almost did not make it as a family and now they have waited so long. Wyatt says they will have a healthy baby and he will be a great father so no negativity. Brooke still cannot believe it \u0096 Katie and Wyatt as a couple, but she bets it is sort of exciting sneaking around. Katie admits it is but they are not ready to tell anyone just yet especially not Bill. She scoffs when Brooke tells her about Thorne's proposal. Brooke says they have always been close but she did not take this seriously, only that he did not want her to marry Ridge. She will make it crystal clear to him she will not rekindle their romance and she intends to marry Ridge.",
        "Wyatt tells Liam they could use a little joy after all that happened in the last few months so good for Steffy to bring them all together. Steffy tells Bill he does not know what this is doing to her. She cannot sleep or even make a decent thought. He says he knows she is under tremendous pressure but the baby must come first. She says she is trying; if only she could go back. Bill says they need to know and she keeps saying this cannot be his child. It is Liam's. This is the family they have always wanted. Bill says whatever but the baby needs to be raised by its biological father. She says she has to go and she knows she has to know for sure that Liam is the father. This pressure is not good for her or for the baby. He says it will be a great holiday coming up but there is only one way to find out the paternity. She calls her doctor and says this has to be in the strictest confidence. She needs to schedule a paternity .and right away. She cannot wait until after the holidays. The doctor tells her to come on in today and she will squeeze her in. Brooke catches Thorne coming out of the pool and she wants to remind him again she remembers what he said and she wants to repeat again that although he is worried about her she knows what she is doing. She is going to marry Ridge and wants him to accept that decision. He says do not tell Ridge that he is sweet but he will accept her decision while still hoping she will change her mind in the next few months. Bill wants to go with Steffy but she says no. No one must know about him. She has been lying to Liam and she cannot take it anymore. That may make her a bad person but she cannot do this anymore. He says it sounds like a plan and once it is confirmed then it will all be behind them. She says good and then she wants everything that happened between them .. never to think about it again."

        "Bill: You're pregnant.",
        "Steffy: Yes.",
        "Bill: You're sure.",
        "Steffy: My doctor confirmed it. It's happy news, bill. Liam and I have wanted this for so long.",
        "Bill: Steffy...",
        "Steffy: We've been trying. We've been hoping and praying, and now it's finally happening. Liam and I are having a baby.",
        "Bill: Steffy. Look at me. There's a possibility that child is mine.",
        "Liam: I mean, it's still super early in the pregnancy. Most people don't tell anyone until at least after the first trimester.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Liam: But, honestly, I mean, steffy and I weren't even sure this was possible, especially given, you know, her fertility issues after losing our first. But that's why we want to keep it quiet. Just -- I just want to make sure it sticks.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Dude, I totally understand, all right?",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, of course. I've got a good feeling about this, though, you know? A few months from now, I'm gonna be uncle wyatt, and dad's gonna have his first grandchild. It's gonna be crazy. When are you gonna tell him, by the way?",
        "Katie: Don't look at me like that.",
        "Brooke: I still can't believe it. You and wyatt?",
        "Katie: Didn't think I had it in me, did you?",
        "Brooke: Well, I am shocked. But in a good way. Besides, who am I to judge? It must be kind of exciting, this sneaking around...",
        "Katie: Yeah, I admit that there's an element of that, but it's more than just that. I mean, wyatt and I are in sync, and I don't know where this is going, and I don't care because we're just having fun. But please -- please, you have to promise me not to say anything to anyone about this. I mean, too many people know already.",
        "Brooke: No, I know, and you don't want bill to find out. So of course, no problem.",
        "Katie: Okay. Thank you. And you have enough going on in your own life, anyway. Have you told R.J. That you're marrying ridge again?",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] Not yet.",
        "Katie: He's gonna be thrilled. I can't say the same for bill, though.",
        "Brooke: I don't think he cares.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on. I don't believe that.",
        "Brooke: No, seriously. I haven't heard from bill. Not one word.",
        "Katie: Okay, so you're ending your marriage to bill, you're remarrying ridge, and you have thorne living with you. I guess it's just another day at the office for brooke logan.",
        "Brooke: [ Chuckles ]",
        "Katie: How are things going with thorne?",
        "Brooke: Good. I thought it'd be nice to have him there at the house, and we could catch up and, you know... we've always been good friends.",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Good friends who... he just happens to be your ex- husband. I mean, how does ridge feel about all this?",
        "Brooke: Mm...",
        "Katie: Ah, they're not getting along -- shocking.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, it is that competition thing. Plus, thorne found out about ridge and quinn, and he's worried about me and thinks that I might be setting myself up to get hurt again. So he made his feelings known. He wants us to get back together.",
        "Steffy: I love this child, and I'm excited to be a mother. What you just said, I can't even go there.",
        "Bill: I understand that, but the possibility exists that it's mine.",
        "Steffy: It isn't! It's liam'S. You and I were together once. Nothing could have happened that night!",
        "Bill: It only takes once. You know that.",
        "Steffy: Bill, don't even say that.",
        "Bill: You have to consider it.",
        "Steffy: I don't have to consider anything! Liam and I, we've been trying to have a child for years! It can't just -- it can't just happen once. It's not fair, bill. It's not fair!",
        "Bill: Fair's got nothing to do with it.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my god, bill! This secret is killing me! And now this? I should have told liam about us from the beginning. I should have.",
        "Bill: You would have lost him.",
        "Steffy: Well, you know what, bill, if this child isn't liam's, I'll lose him anyway.",
        "Katie: So, when thorne said that he wanted you back, it wasn't just a casual \"for old time's sake\" fling.",
        "Brooke: Thorne's not the fling type.",
        "Katie: This is unbelievable!",
        "Brooke: Thorne and I were very close for a long time.",
        "Katie: That was 10,000 years ago! I mean, how many times have you gone back to ridge since then?",
        "Brooke: Well, that's exactly the point. He doesn't want me to do that again.",
        "Katie: Right, he's even going as far as asking you to marry him.",
        "Brooke: Rather than ridge. Besides, I don't think he was serious about that.",
        "Katie: And yet, he's still living in your house. I mean, ridge must love that.",
        "Brooke: Well, ridge doesn't know all the specifics. I want those two to get along. Regardless, he doesn't like anything his brother's doing these days.",
        "Katie: Right, but wanting to design and wanting you back are two very different things. I mean, have you been absolutely clear with him that you are committed to ridge?",
        "Brooke: Yes. I told him, in no uncertain terms, the marriage is happening.",
        "Katie: And yet he still wants you. Brooke, don't put yourself in between those brothers. You have got to be crystal-clear with thorne that there's no chance that you're going to rekindle anything with him.",
        "Brooke: I know. You're right, okay? I will just tell him as many times as I need to.",
        "Katie: I'm just watching out for you.",
        "Brooke: Thanks. Me, too. I'm happy that you're happy with wyatt.",
        "Katie: Thank you. I knew you wouldn't judge me.",
        "Brooke: Oh, of course not. I'll never judge you. I want you to enjoy yourself, enjoy your life! Enjoy wyatt. But just be careful because i know bill is not gonna like this. And he always finds out about these things. Always.",
        "Wyatt: Finally starting your long-awaited, well-deserved family. I'm seriously proud of you.",
        "Liam: Thanks, bro.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: This doesn't even seem real. Well, especially the way that it happened because, you know, steffy didn't go to the doctor thinking she was pregnant. It was just a routine check-up, and then -- boop! -- Baby on board.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I'm all for it. You know, this family could use a little joy after all we've been through lately. That war between you and dad, i just... I didn't think it was gonna end well.",
        "Liam: But steffy did. That's what's funny. I mean, she -- she basically gave me my own father back. And now she's giving me a little son or daughter. Dude, we're having a baby! Like...",
        "Wyatt: [ Laughs ]",
        "Steffy: You don't know what this is doing to me. The weight of all these secrets, I can't -- I can't eat, I can'T... I can't sleep. I can't even form a coherent thought.",
        "Bill: I'm sorry. I know you've been under a lot of pressure. But things have changed. This isn't just about you anymore, steffy. The well-being of the baby has to come first.",
        "Steffy: You think I don't know that? I'm trying, bill. I'm really trying. Look, if I could go back and erase everything, maybe it would all make sense.",
        "Bill: You need to know. We both do.",
        "Steffy: I do. This baby is liam'S.",
        "Bill: And if it isn't?",
        "Steffy: It is! His father? Liam would never forgive me. This cannot be your child!",
        "Bill: We need to find out one way or another. So we can start making plans. Whatever the outcome, you should raise the baby with the biological father.",
        "Steffy: What? Bill! Bill! Don't even say that! You can't -- do not think that! This has to be liam's! It's liam! This is the family that we've always wanted, okay? This is his! It has to be! Oh, god... you're right. [ Sighs ] You're right. You're right. This isn't -- this isn't good for me. It's not healthy for me or the baby. I need to know. I need to be certain liam is the father.",
        "Thorne: Hey! I didn't think you were home.",
        "Brooke: Oh!",
        "Thorne: Pool's back up and running.",
        "Brooke: Well, yeah. I see that. Uh, I was over at katie'S.",
        "Thorne: Okay. Everything good with her?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Yeah. She's happy and I'm glad about that. So close to the holidays.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, I can't believe it's almost christmas.",
        "Brooke: Uh-huh.",
        "Thorne: Looking forward to spending it with the family.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "Thorne: [ Chuckles ] Okay. Something is bothering you. Did you violate the house guest code? Am I dripping?",
        "Brooke: No. No. You're a perfect houseguest. And I'm happy that you're here.",
        "Thorne: But...?",
        "Brooke: I just need to know that you understand something. Even thought I'm not wearing ridge's ring, I intend to marry him. And I'm going to bring our family back together. Now, I know you don't approve, but I need to hear that you accept that.",
        "Wyatt: I can't believe you're actually gonna be someone's father.",
        "Liam: It's frightening, right?",
        "Wyatt: Super frightening.",
        "Liam: You know, it's actually, like, literally frightening. I mean, imagine me, like, me, in charge of this tiny little helpless person. I mean, what if I blow it? What if I get it all wrong? What if I -- dude, what if I make all the same mistakes I accused dad of making? That could happen.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, first off, that is a completely different situation. You are gonna be there for your child, and you'll be able to, you know, make adjustments from there. And, second, like, you're not like dad. You're not gonna repeat his mistakes. You are gonna be a fantastic, present dad and produce a phenomenal new addition to the human race.",
        "Liam: Yeah. The other thing that scares me...",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Liam: ...Is the possibility that it happens again, you know. I mean, losing our baby, that was -- that was devastating for steffy and me.",
        "Wyatt: I know.",
        "Liam: We almost didn't make it as a couple.",
        "Wyatt: I know, but, dude, you got to get that thought out of your head. Like, don't invite that kind of negativity. It's not gonna happen.",
        "Liam: Yeah, no. You're right. This is something that we have waited for for so long, and it's finally happening, so...",
        "Wyatt: Exactly. That's what I'm talking about.",
        "Liam: [ Sighs ] Steffy and liam -- parents!",
        "Wyatt: [ Laughing ] Yeah.",
        "Bill: The holidays are coming up.",
        "Steffy: I don't know if I can handle that now.",
        "Bill: If you get the reassurance you need, that it's liam's baby... it'll be a very happy holiday for you.",
        "Steffy: I don't even know anything about a paternity test, like, what you do or how long it takes to get the results.",
        "Bill: Only one way to find out.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "[ Sighs ]",
        "[ Cellphone rings ] Dr. Campbell.",
        "Steffy: Dr. Campbell, it's steffy spencer. Steffy. Everything okay?",
        "Steffy: I'm not sure. What's going on?",
        "Steffy: Dr. Campbell, this has to be in strictest confidence. Of course.",
        "Steffy: I need to schedule a paternity test. Okay. Due to the timing, we're gonna have to set something up for after the holidays.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no, no. That's too long. The stress is already eating me up inside, and this is not healthy for the baby. If we could just please -- Steffy, if you can come in today, then I'll squeeze you in between appointments.",
        "Steffy: Yes. Yes. I'll be there. I can hear that you're upset, so let's get you the answers that you need. Then you can focus on carrying this baby to term.",
        "Steffy: I want that, too. Thank you. I can't tell you how much i appreciate it.",
        "Bill: You're doing the right thing. We both need to know.",
        "Steffy: I already know. I already know it's liam's baby. And once the test confirms it, we'll get on with our lives.",
        "Thorne: Don't worry. I've accepted that you've accepted ridge's proposal.",
        "Brooke: Good. Because I haven't forgotten what you said.",
        "Thorne: What did I say?",
        "Brooke: Are you really gonna tell me you forgot?",
        "Thorne: I don't know. I say a lot of things.",
        "Brooke: Okay, well, maybe this will refresh your memory. During the next few months while I'm getting my divorce to bill, you are gonna try to win me back.",
        "Thorne: I said that?",
        "Brooke: Mm-hmm.",
        "Thorne: Good for me.",
        "Brooke: [ Laughs ] Seriously, thorne. Look, I know you're concerned about me, and I know you don't want to see me go through another heartbreak or disappointment, but I know what I'm doing. And if you're gonna live here in this house, you need to respect my decision.",
        "Thorne: Brooke, first and foremost, I'm your friend, someone you can trust, confide in. This friendship is very important to me.",
        "Brooke: You're very sweet, thorne.",
        "Thorne: Don't tell ridge. He'll start calling me \"sweet little brother.\"",
        "Brooke: [ Laughs ] He would.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, let's just take a minute here to reflect on this child that you and steffy are bringing into the world. It could be a devoted environmentalist, it could be a super savvy businesswoman.",
        "Liam: Mr. Or madame president.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Liam: Or just a dirty tree-hugging hippy who lives off the land and listens to grateful dead the whole day.",
        "Wyatt: That's probably what it's gonna be.",
        "Liam: Oh, my god, could you imagine the sheer disappointment and scorn from dad?",
        "Wyatt: Oh! Look, he's gonna be proud of you, dude, no matter what. You're giving him his first grandchild.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Does that bother you at all?",
        "Wyatt: Hell -- dude, no.",
        "Liam: No?",
        "Wyatt: Better you than me. I'll just take notes. You be the guinea pig.",
        "Liam: [ Laughs ] I mean, that is true. This is the most exciting but most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me. Just the responsibility is off the charts, with -- with rewards I'm sure I can't even fathom yet.",
        "Wyatt: Exactly, yeah, like sleep deprivation, no social life.",
        "Liam: Hey. What? Wait. Whoa.",
        "Wyatt: Tons of dirty diapers, I mean, more than you can count.",
        "Liam: Dude, I -- agh!",
        "Wyatt: [ Laughs ]",
        "Liam: Hey, at least it's steffy I get to take the journey with, you know?",
        "Wyatt: That's true. You're a lucky man.",
        "Liam: This is crazy. Can you imagine? Like, right now -- right now, inside of steffy, there is already a little baby growing, that is half steffy, half me.",
        "Bill: It's great that dr. Campbell can squeeze you in.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah. I can't wait till after the holidays.",
        "Bill: All right, well, let's go.",
        "Steffy: You can't come with me.",
        "Bill: I have a stake in this, too, steffy.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, a stake that no one can know about.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I just want to be there for you.",
        "Steffy: Like you were for me that night? What's wrong with us? How could we do that?",
        "Bill: No, no, no, no, no. You're forgetting the circumstances. We made love that night because of what we share, because of the connection and the attraction we've always had.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. Bill. No! No! No! You were hurting, and you turned to me because it felt right.",
        "Steffy: Well, you know what, I must have been out of my mind. That is the only explanation because I would never betray liam in such an unforgivable way! I keep lying to him, and I can't take it anymore. I can't take it!",
        "Bill: You're not thinking of telling him, are you?",
        "Steffy: [ Sighs ] I want to, bill, I really do. But I can'T. I can'T. Maybe that makes me an even worse person.",
        "Bill: No, steffy, stop beating yourself up. There's no reason for us to hurt him. Especially if it turns out... that the kid is his.",
        "Steffy: It is. And once this sweet, innocent child is proven to be liam's, I'm just gonna thank god every day for the privilege of a future and a family with the man I love.",
        "Bill: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Steffy: Well, first thing is the paternity test. Now, only you, me, and the doctor know, and no one needs to know because the baby is liam's, and once we confirm it, we can put it all behind us.",
        "Bill: You really think you can do that?",
        "Steffy: Once I know for a fact that this child is liam's, I will never think about that night with you ever again."
