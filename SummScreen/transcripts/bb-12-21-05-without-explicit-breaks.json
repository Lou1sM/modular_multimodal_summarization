        "Stephanie: It's not going \r\nto be a perfect Christmas. ",
        "Eric: Not with an attitude \r\nlike that. ",
        "Stephanie: How did we ever \r\nend up with one another? ",
        "Eric: Because you fell for \r\nme. You fell for my free-spirited sense of creativity. ",
        "Stephanie: Right. I kept \r\nmy feet on the ground so you could keep your head in the clouds. ",
        "Eric: There you go, \r\nexactly. You kept me free to create so that you could take care of our home and \r\nour family. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, right. \r\nWell, I haven't done a very stellar job of that lately. The children are at each \r\nothers' throats, and until Felicia came home, the house was empty. ",
        "Eric: Well, it's not going \r\nto be empty for Christmas. ",
        "Stephanie: No, but it's \r\ngoing to be empty soon again. Because Felicia will be -- and all the colored \r\nlights and all the bright beautiful balls can't put Humpty Dumpty back together \r\nagain. ",
        "Eric: Listen, you and I -- \r\nyou and I are going to honor Felicia's wishes. We're going to make these next \r\nfew weeks the most wonderful in her life. ",
        "Stephanie: I don't think \r\nI'm going to want to remember this Christmas. ",
        "Eric: Felicia wants us to \r\nremember this Christmas, for her child. She knows it won't be easy. It's not \r\neasy for Felicia, either. But she will do anything for that baby. That's a trait \r\nshe got from you. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************",
        "Felicia: Oh, I don't know \r\nhow to thank you, Bridget. ",
        "Bridget: Thank me? Look at \r\nhim. You're the one who's giving me such an incredible gift. When you asked me \r\nto be a mom to Dominick, all I wanted to think about was hiding behind my own \r\nideas of my marriage and my family, but I couldn't do it. I couldn't close my \r\nheart to him. Especially after I saw how happy that he made Nick, and they made \r\neach other. It was just like my heart opened up so wide for you. ",
        "Felicia: It's the same way \r\nit was the first time I ever laid eyes on him. Hey, Dominick, when the doctor \r\nput you in my arms, I was so happy and so relieved. And I'm so relieved now to \r\nknow that he's going to be all right. ",
        "Bridget: Oh, he will be. \r\nAnd please, Felicia, don't worry about that. I don't want you to worry at all. I \r\njust want you to enjoy this time you have with him. ",
        "Felicia: That's exactly \r\nwhy I'm saying no to the chemo. I want to be completely here for him now. Right \r\nup until -- I don't want to waste a single second that we have together, okay?\r\n",
        "\r\n*********************************************************************",
        "Nick: So you're not really \r\nhere to just see Dominick. You're worried about Bridget. ",
        "Brooke: Aren't you? You're \r\nasking her to raise another woman's child. Could you even imagine what that \r\nwould be like? ",
        "Nick: I don't have to \r\nimagine it. I lived it with you and Hope. ",
        "Brooke: You have a special \r\nrelationship with Hope. ",
        "Nick: I would have treated \r\nher as my own. ",
        "Brooke: Just put yourself \r\nin Bridget's shoes. She's pregnant. Expecting a child. She's had a rough year \r\nand it's finally settling down. She's happily married, planning a future. \n",
        "Nick: Well, obviously, \r\nplans change, don't they? But my relationship with hope hasn't. Doesn't that \r\ntell you something? ",
        "Brooke: It tells me that \r\nyou're an extraordinary man. And that you have a rare bond with Hope. \n",
        "Nick: Well, I believe the \r\nsame thing can happen with Bridget and Dominick. ",
        "Brooke: I'm not saying it \r\ncan't, I just wouldn't want you to assume. ",
        "Nick: Please, if there's \r\none thing I've learned this year it's not to assume anything. ",
        "Brooke: But you were \r\nhoping. ",
        "Nick: I want my son to \r\nlive here. I want him to be part of this family. ",
        "Brooke: A family that you \r\nvowed to make with Bridget. ",
        "Nick: Your daughter's got \r\na lot of love in her. More than you give her credit for. Remember. She did \r\nforgive us, didn't she? ",
        "\r\n*********************************************************",
        "Bridget: I just want to be \r\na good mom to your son. ",
        "Felicia: You will be.\r\n",
        "Bridget: I just feel like \r\nthere's a lot that I don't know. ",
        "Felicia: Believe me, I \r\nfeel like that every day. Somehow you just figure it out. ",
        "Bridget: I meant about \r\nyou. ",
        "Felicia: Me? I don't \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Bridget: Oh, I mean, you \r\nknow, you're my sister. We're family. There's a ton of stories I've heard about \r\n-- you were the trouble maker. Quite the -- I've heard about your career as a \r\ndesigner. But I feel like that's so surfacy. I just want to know the real you. \r\nLike where have you been living? What is it that you really like to do? What's \r\nyour favorite book and your favorite song? And your favorite band? I feel like \r\nsomeday Dominick's going to want to know all of that and I really want to be \r\nable to tell him. I just want to spend so much time with the two of you so I'll \r\nknow. I want to watch how you interact and how he likes to be held. What games \r\nyou play and what kind of songs he listens to. ",
        "Felicia: Bridget, stop. \r\nHe's too young. He's not going to remember. ",
        "[ Baby fusses ] I know, \r\nbaby. Come here. ",
        "Bridget: Yeah he will. \r\nFelicia? You're going to be so much more than just a picture on your mother's \r\npiano. I'm going to make sure of it. ",
        "Felicia: I'll tell you \r\neverything you want to know. ",
        "Bridget: Good. But I just \r\nwant to tell you one thing first, and I really want you to hear me. I'm never \r\ngoing to replace you in Dominick's heart, and I don't want to. I've told you \r\nthis before, but you are his mom. I know you're entrusting him to Nick and to \r\nme, and we're going to be the most loving parents that we can possibly be. But \r\nDominick -- he is and he always will be your son. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************************",
        "Brooke: That's exactly my \r\npoint, Nick. Bridget has overcome the past. Everything we put her through. It \r\nhasn't been easy, but she did it. ",
        "Nick: Well, what makes you \r\nthink that she can't do this? ",
        "Brooke: All I'm saying is \r\nshe shouldn't have to. ",
        "Nick: Well, Felicia \r\nshouldn't have cancer either, Brooke. And Dominick shouldn't have to lose his \r\nmother. I mean, it's not an ideal situation for anybody. ",
        "Brooke: Well, this could \r\naffect your marriage. ",
        "Nick: It won't. \n",
        "Brooke: You don't know \r\nthat. ",
        "Nick: I know your \r\ndaughter. And I've seen that little boy. ",
        "Brooke: And? ",
        "Nick: He's adorable. I \r\ndon't think any woman in the world could resist him. ",
        "Brooke: Like father like \r\nson. ",
        "Nick: It may take Dominick \r\na little time to win Bridget over, but I think it's going to happen. He'll help \r\nthis marriage. As a matter of fact, I think this boy's going to keep this family \r\ntogether. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************************************",
        "Eric: We wish you a merry \r\nWhat? What? ",
        "Stephanie: I owe you an \r\napology. ",
        "Eric: No, no, no. No, no, \r\nno. We've both made a lot of mistakes. You and I, string them together, we could \r\ndecorate this whole tree. We could wrap them around the house. ",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, like I \r\nsaid, it's just Felicia's illness that puts it all in perspective. ",
        "Eric: The last thing she \r\nneeds is for her parents to be arguing about the company. ",
        "Stephanie: It's not just \r\nthe business, it never was. ",
        "Eric: I know. A lot of our \r\ntroubles could have been avoided if I hadn't married Brooke. ",
        "Stephanie: You got that \r\none right. ",
        "Eric: And you haven't \r\nforgiven me for it. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, the truth \r\nis, right now, the only thing I can think about is Felicia and the baby. Let's \r\nput everything else aside for the time being. We'll just try to be civil with \r\none another. ",
        "Eric: We're not doing that \r\nbad a job of it. ",
        "Stephanie: Did you speak \r\nto Bridget today? ",
        "Eric: No. ",
        "Stephanie: So you don't \r\nhave any idea how it went last night? ",
        "Eric: No, I don't. I hope \r\nit went well. ",
        "Stephanie: It's kind of \r\nstrange that we haven't heard anything. ",
        "Eric: Well, don't you \r\nbother them. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, you're not \r\ncurious? ",
        "Eric: Yes, I'm curious, \r\nbut they need this time alone together with the baby if they have a chance of \r\nbonding the baby at all. ",
        "Stephanie: If? You think \r\nBridget's not going to say yes? ",
        "Eric: I hope she does. For \r\nFelicia's sake. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, you know, \r\nit wouldn't be the end of the world if she doesn't. He could have a wonderful \r\nhome here. Certainly a festive one. ",
        "Eric: Here with you?\r\n",
        "Stephanie: He's my \r\ngrandson. ",
        "Eric: Well, you can't \r\nraise him alone. ",
        "Stephanie: Right, you were \r\nsuch a big help with the first set. ",
        "Eric: Yes, okay, so I \r\nwasn't. But what good is making mistakes if you can't learn from them? \n",
        "Felicia: Wow, look at \r\ngrandma's Christmas tree. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, we're \r\njust starting! ",
        "Eric: It's a work in \r\nprogress, Felicia. Let's have some patience here. ",
        "Stephanie: I thought you \r\nwere going to call. ",
        "Felicia: I took a cab.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: But, honey, I \r\nwanted to pick you up. ",
        "Felicia: I know. Dominick \r\ncouldn't wait to get home. ",
        "Eric: He couldn't wait to \r\nmeet me. Let me see you. ",
        "Stephanie: He's so \r\nexcited, he's ready to go to sleep. ",
        "[ Felicia laughs ] \n",
        "Eric: That's your \r\ngrandmother. That's sarcasm. You're going to get used to that. We all have to \r\nget used to that. ",
        "Felicia: I didn't expect \r\ndad to be here. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, he wanted \r\nto help get the tree decorated before you got in from the hospital. Actually, he \r\nwas going to go down to the beach house and pick up the baby. ",
        "Felicia: Bridget brought \r\nDominick to the hospital this morning. ",
        "Stephanie: So what does \r\nthat mean? He's not going to stay with them anymore? ",
        "Felicia: He's going to \r\nstay with me for as long as he can, before it's time to go live with Nick and \r\nBridget. ",
        "\r\n*****************************************************************",
        "Nick: It's hard to \r\ndescribe how I feel when I see that boy. How happy he makes me. ",
        "Brooke: You don't have to.\r\n",
        "Nick: I'm not sure you \r\nknow what it did to me. When I found out that R.J. wasn't my boy. Knowing I \r\nwasn't going to be a father to Hope. I lost all that. And I thought I'd never \r\nrecover. ",
        "Brooke: But you have. And \r\nnot only did you find out that you're having a daughter, you found out that you \r\nhad a boy. ",
        "Nick: I thought it was \r\ngoing to be you. ",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, here \r\nit is. And I can see how excited you are. I'm just, I'm really -- I'm really \r\nworried about Bridget. ",
        "Nick: She wants me to be \r\nhappy. ",
        "Brooke: I know, of course \r\nshe does. But does she share that happiness? ",
        "Nick: Hey, your mom came \r\nby to see Dominick. Where is he? ",
        "Bridget: He's with \r\nFelicia. And I thought it'd be a good idea for him to spend as much time with \r\nher as he can before we become his parents. ",
        "Nick: His parents? \n",
        "Bridget: His parents.\r\n",
        "Nick: She said yes? She \r\nsaid yes! ",
        "Brooke: Nick said that you \r\nwere having some trouble with all of this last night. ",
        "Bridget: Yeah, I was, but \r\nI was just being so selfish. ",
        "Nick: You were \r\noverwhelmed. ",
        "Brooke: Well, that's all \r\nright. Anybody would be. ",
        "Bridget: I'm not anymore. \r\nI'm just really excited. ",
        "Brooke: Really? \n",
        "Bridget: Yeah, I'm very \r\nexcited. You know what? I thought that we have a lot of joy in our lives and no \r\none is ever going to take that away from us. And I think Dominick can only add \r\nto it. ",
        "Nick: He will. He \r\ndefinitely will, you'll see. ",
        "Bridget: I already have.\r\n",
        "Brooke: I'm so happy for \r\nyou, sweetheart. I really am. ",
        "Bridget: Mom. ",
        "\r\n***********************************************************************",
        "Stephanie: Come here, \r\nbaby. ",
        "Eric: You're the best \r\nbaby. Yeah? ",
        "Felicia: I really have to \r\nthank you both for this. It's everything I wanted. ",
        "Eric: Well, you just wait. \r\nIt gets better. All right, this is almost finishing. It needs a couple of \r\nfinishing touches, but it still needs something. ",
        "Felicia: A warning label!\r\n",
        "Eric: What? ",
        "Felicia: Forget chemo. A \r\ncouple cups of this poison every day and I'd be cancer free. Oh, Mom. It's okay \r\nto laugh. ",
        "Stephanie: I know, honey. \r\nI know. ",
        "Eric: You deal with this \r\nin your own way, hon. And we will deal with it in ours. ",
        "Felicia: This is too much \r\nfor you. ",
        "Stephanie: Sweetheart, it \r\nisn't. I know that you have to laugh and cry. It's all part of it. I'm just glad \r\nthat you're here. I'm just glad that you and the baby are home, that's all.\r\n",
        "Felicia: So am I. So am I.\r\n",
        "\r\n*****************************************************************************",
        "Nick: So you talked to \r\nFelicia? ",
        "Bridget: Yeah, I think \r\nthere's still a lot of details to work out for sure. ",
        "Nick: What did she say?\r\n",
        "Bridget: She was really \r\nrelieved. ",
        "Nick: What did you say?\r\n",
        "Bridget: Well, I thanked \r\nher for trusting me with such a precious gift. ",
        "Nick: You're sure? \n",
        "Bridget: Yes. ",
        "Nick: It's just me and you \r\nhere now, so if you've got any misgivings about this -- ",
        "Bridget: Honey, I really \r\ndon't. ",
        "Nick: You know that this \r\nis going to change our entire life. ",
        "Bridget: Yeah, but for the \r\nbetter. ",
        "Nick: Well, I've got to be \r\nhonest with you. Last night, this morning, I felt a real distance. ",
        "Bridget: You did? \n",
        "Nick: You hadn't made up \r\nyour mind. ",
        "Bridget: No, I had made up \r\nmy mind. I was going to say \"no.\" But then I came in this morning and I saw you \r\nfeeding Dominick breakfast and I couldn't even interrupt you. It was a powerful \r\nmoment for me to see how happy the two of you made each other. I don't ever want \r\nto deny you that kind of happiness. ",
        "Nick: Bridget, you didn't \r\njust say yes for me, did you? ",
        "Bridget: Of course I said \r\nyes for you. I said yes for you and for me and for Felicia, but especially for \r\nDominick. Honey, I see how you are with Hope and R.J. How excited you are about \r\nour baby. You were just born to be a father, and you're going to be a great one. \r\nPlus, I wouldn't ever want Dominick to grow up without his father full-time. And \r\nif I could have a part in that and make that happen for him -- ",
        "Nick: You are a part of \r\nthat. You are making that happen, and you are going to be one hell of a mom.\r\n",
        "Bridget: Nothing's going \r\nto make me happier. ",
        "Nick: God, I do love you.\r\n",
        "Bridget: \r\nI love you, too. "
