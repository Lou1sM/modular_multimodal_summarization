        "Taylor: Hey, why don't you go have some of Eric's eggnog over there?",
        "Felicia: I said a nap, Taylor, not knocked out cold.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Stephanie: Thank you, again -- if I haven't said it once or twice -- for coming to the shelter with me this morning.",
        "Felicia: Oh, like I would ever pass up a reason to hand out Christmas gifts?",
        "Thorne: Our black leather Santa Claus.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Taylor: Yeah, wasn't that more the reindeers?",
        "Thomas: Hello?",
        "Ridge: Hey, there's our college boy.",
        "Stephanie: Hi, tom. Merry Christmas!",
        "Thomas: Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.",
        "Taylor: Merry Christmas, sweetie.",
        "Ridge: Merry Christmas.",
        "Thomas: Thanks, you, too. You, too. Oh, hey. I have Dino's presents right here.",
        "Felicia: Oh, thank you. He's upstairs napping, but I'll give it to him.",
        "Thomas: Is Dante up there? I have something else for him, too.",
        "Felicia: No, he should be here soon. Unless his plane from Rome is delayed.",
        "Thomas: Okay.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, it'll be on time.",
        "Thomas: Oh, hey, little reindeers? Anybody want some presents?",
        "Hope: We do! We do!",

        "[All gasp]",
        "Taylor: Yay, art stuff!",
        "Felicia: Dad, listen to me. About your plan to bring to grandma and Aunt Pam in for Christmas -- scrap it.",
        "Eric: Felicia, this is Christmas. It's a time of opening hearts and forgiving. If your mother can't forgive her now, when will she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pamela: It was so kind of Eric to invite us for Christmas.",
        "Ann: If Stephanie had wanted us there, she would have invited us herself.",
        "Pamela: Mom, it's been 30 years since we've spent the holidays with family. I think that we should just focus on having a wonderful time.",
        "Ann: That's up to your sister.",
        "Pamela: No, it's up to you.",
        "Ann: I asked Stephanie to forgive me. She refused. I apologized. I told her I should have been a better mother, I should have protected her from john. But Stephanie made it clear she has no interest in any kind of relationship with me. Oh, I want her back in my life, Pamela. You know how much. But I'm afraid, when she sees us arrive -- I know what Eric said, but that's hoping for too much. Your sister hates me. And I don't blame her.",

        "Phoebe: Wow.",
        "Shane: Go ahead, open her up. It's a jewelry box.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, I know, it's -- it's gorgeous.",
        "Shane: One day, I'm gonna fill that thing up with diamonds for you. I promise you that.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah -- you don't have to fill it up with anything Shane.",
        "Shane: No, no, no, really, phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: I love it how it is.",
        "Shane: I want to be somebody that you can be proud of. I got a bunch of job interviews, too, lined up, just so you know.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah?",
        "Shane: Yeah. I am determined to be something to you, make something out of myself. I want to be somebody that can be worthy of you.",

        "Stephanie: Oh, honey, somehow they always do.",
        "Eric: Very strong bond, you know? Between mother and daughter?",
        "Stephanie: Mm-hmm. Well, that's how this family operates, isn't it? We always come together in a crisis, all of us. Look at our children. They've had a tough year, and they're stronger than ever.",
        "Eric: So are you. You know, you handled the situation with your mother extraordinarily well. That's why I'm giving you a very special Christmas present this year. I hope you like it.",

        "Brooke: Okay. Well, it's a good thing I was walking by at that moment.",
        "Ridge: Well, I happened to be waiting for you.",
        "Brooke: For a very long time.",
        "Ridge: Yes. And you're very, very worth it.",
        "Brooke: And I'm very, very grateful that you never gave up on us.",
        "Ridge: And when we get to this moment right here, I didn't know how long it would take but I knew somehow, some day, we'd have our family back. Right? Right?",
        "Brooke: That's right. That's so right.",
        "Ridge: Right.",
        "Brooke: What is that song again? Jingle bells, jingle bells",

        "Phoebe: I told you I was at Bridget's house.",
        "Ridge: Phoebe, I love you. You and your sister, and your brothers are very precious to me. And the thought of anything ever happening to you, really destroys me. So, if you think I'm just being, you know, overly protective here --",
        "Phoebe: Because you care about me. I know.",

        "Alexandria: Can we use these right now?",
        "Taylor: Oh, honey, I don't want you to get paint all over your beautiful dress and get it all messy. We can do it later, okay? Go show this to Thomas. I want you to show him that. We'll paint when we get home, okay?",
        "Thorne: Until we get home. I don't know if I could wait a long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Co-pilot: There's a car waiting on the tarmac to get you to the Forrester house. Is there anything else I can do for you?",
        "Pamela: No, thank you.",

        "Ann: I'm being realistic, Pamela. You should be too.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eric: You okay?",
        "Stephanie: Oh, I'm fine. I was just, you know, thinking family.",
        "Eric: Your mother, your sister?",
        "Stephanie: No, my mother is the last person I would think of on a day like today. I was thinking of Kristin. I'm sad that she wasn't here, you know, with her family. I get to thinking about Sal --",
        "Eric: Yeah, but she's with C.J. this year.",
        "Stephanie: Yeah, I'm happy for her. I'll just miss her and miss laughing. I got thinking about Darla. Hard not having Darla here. It'll be hard on the baby and Thorne.",
        "Eric: I'm sure they're feeling the same way.",
        "Stephanie: But I have very special gift that I hope you'll like.",
        "Alexandria: Did you get a present, grandma?",

        "Alexandria: From you?",
        "Stephanie: Well, a little bit from me. But mostly, from your mommy. I helped her to finish it. So, you can open it, if you'd like. That's good. Plunk, plunk. Open it up. It's that pretty. Now, take this, open and look in here.",
        "Alexandria: Me and mommy.",
        "Stephanie: Mm-hmm. Aren't those pretty pictures? And I have some other pictures and things over here for you, too. I have some pages here for you for you to fill in, okay? That you can put in the back -- pictures of Daddy, and Taylor. Those are for you to fill in, they're blank. You can make new memories with those pages, okay?",
        "Alexandria: Me and mommy. She's so pretty.",
        "Stephanie: She is.",
        "Alexandria: I miss her, Grandma.",
        "Stephanie: I know you do, sweetheart. I miss her, too. Your mommy loved Christmas. The reason she loves Christmas because she knew what it was all about. Love. Spending time with the people that you love and remembering the people that you love, that are gone.",
        "Alexandria: Mommy.",
        "Stephanie: Mommy. But she's still here. In a very special way with you.",
        "Alexandria: The Christmas spirit.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, for Christmas. She's the spirit of Christmas. Isn't she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Darla in a voice over]",
        "Darla: My dear little girl, my sweet Ally. It's true, honey, I'm here. Watching you open your presents in front of the tree. You're so happy. That's what kind of Christmas you're celebrating today. And that's the best Christmas present anybody can ever give your mommy. I'm celebrating with you ally. In each time you smile or laugh today, each precious little giggle, they're flying up to me in heaven, sweetie. Tied up with a big, red Christmas bow. Merry Christmas, Alexandria. I love you, my baby girl. Mommy loves you. Mommy loves you, forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandria: It's a beautiful gift, Grandma. Thank you.",
        "Stephanie: You're welcome. Thank you, everybody. I have to say thank you for being here today, Christmas. It's made it a really special day today. I know we've had a lot of wonderful Christmases together. But this one somehow is really special. Your father and I are just really happy that you are all here with us. And that you're together with your families. Not every family can do that. Mine certainly didn't.",
        "Taylor: Well, that can change in time.",
        "Stephanie: No, I don't think so. The Douglas family, my family, never bonded the way we have as Forresters. I think as family, we've proven over and over again, with enough love and compassion -- any -- any wound could be healed. And any mistake can be forgiven and any wrong can be right. You all have certainly forgiven me for all messing into your lives and trying to control you. And I appreciate that. Believe me, so much. Thanks for the support these past couple of weeks. They've got me through some difficult times. You, and you, and you, and you, all of you. You're my family. The only family I ever wanted. I'm so proud and I'm really grateful to you. And I'm so happy we have each other and a nice day today, Christmas day. Enough of that, Christmas dinner will be ready in a freckle and a half.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Bridget: Freckle and a half. Grandma, that was so sweet.",
        "Stephanie: Oh.",
        "Felicia: Do you hear that, Dad? She doesn't want or need them here.",
        "Eric: They're going to be here any second.",
        "Felicia: Please, daddy? She's so happy.",
        "Eric: I think she's going to be a lot happier when she's able to make amends with her mother.",
        "Felicia: Listen to me, it's not going to happen. [Knock on the door] Oh, my God--",
        "Eric: That's them.",
        "Felicia: I'm sending them away --",
        "Eric: No, no, no --",
        "Bridget: Oh, Dino, I think your daddy might finally be here.",
        "Stephanie: I'll get it --",
        "Bridget: Yea!",
        "Stephanie: Mother?",
        "Ann: Merry Christmas, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: What are you doing here?",
        "Pamela: It's Christmas, Steph. A time for family.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, it is. And I'm spending it with mine. You're not welcome here. You weren't invited. Pam, take her and leave right now."
