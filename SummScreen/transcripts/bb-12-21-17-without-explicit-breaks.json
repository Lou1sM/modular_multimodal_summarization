    "Recap": [
        "Wyatt feigns skullduggery when Katie tells him she let slip about them to Brooke. This is the lady that is still married to his dad. Then he goes Holy .when she slips off her robe and is in a skimpy Santa suit. Liam goes over his list of employees who deserve bonuses this year for Christmas with Bill. He says his Christmas bonus will be Bill to tell him if he ever gets down or unhappy; just remind him how happy he is right now with Steffy and they will have a rich future together. Bill tries to get the convo around to the doctor visit but Liam is not talking. He tries to call Steffy who is at her doctor appointment and because Bill is listening he is pretty vague when he inquires what Steffy is doing or where she is. She tells him she is checking out the pre-natal classes and yes she did take her vitamins.",
        "After their moment in bed, Wyatt brings out a present for Katie since they will be with family later and he wants this to be a secret. It is a lovely pair of earrings. She says it has been her experience that men usually do that when they feel guilty but Wyatt assures him that this is the case here. He just wanted to give her something that she could wear and always think of him. Liam gives Bill an early gift and says he can only hope if he is fortunate enough to be a dad that he will be as generous and kind as Bill is. He loves him; they hug. Meanwhile Steffy's doctor tells her the blood has been drawn and preliminary tests done but for cross-examination they will need to be sent off to get those results. Steffy does not know how much more of this she can stand. The doctor tells her just go home, do not panic, relax the best way she can during the holidays and in a few days they will know the paternity."

        "Steffy: Yeah, there was another man. It was just once, but, you know, the, uh, the timing...",
        "Dr. Campbell: I don't really need to know more information than that. As long as the encounter was consensual?",
        "Steffy: Yes. So do you think that, you know, since it was just once, maybe...",

        "Katie: Is this your last will and testament? Because I will take your outdoor grill. It is amazing.",
        "Wyatt: Clearly you're not seeing the gravity of the situation here. I could die, all right? There's a lot of people that know about us.",
        "Katie: Three people know about us!",
        "Wyatt: That's a lot for L.A.",
        "Katie: Listen, when or if bill finds out about us, I have a feeling it's just gonna go in one ear and out the other, because wherever his attention is these days, it's not on you and me.",

        "Liam: Uh, yeah. Yeah. You could...you could say that.",
        "Dr. Campbell: There's a new non-invasive screening. It's highly accurate. It looks for the fetal cells in your bloodstream. All we have to do is draw the blood and compare the findings with the dna profiles of the prospective fathers.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.",
        "Dr. Campbell: All right.",
        "Katie: Seriously, what took you so long? You should have been here an hour ago. Tick, tick, tick.",
        "Wyatt: I said I'd get here as soon as I could. Are you gonna be demanding now?",
        "Katie: Oh, I've never really been demanding before. Maybe I should try it on for size.",

        "Katie: You're so silly. You know tofu doesn't grow on trees.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I-I knew that. I was just checking to see if you did.",

        "Wyatt: Hmm. Really?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Come on. When I was in school, they always said that I wasn't living up to my potential.",

        "Bill: Okay, lay it on me.",
        "Liam: Okay. Happiness is a good thing, right?",
        "Bill: Happiness. Sure. Why not? Although santa doesn't carry that in his sack.",
        "Liam: Agreed. This is true. And the fact is, most people don't really walk around thinking about exactly how happy or unhappy they are. You know, they're paying their bills and arguing about politics and fretting over getting fat, but the one thing better than happiness is knowledge -- knowing that you're happy. So here's the thing. If you see that slip away from me, if you ever see me angry or depressed or shut down, then you remind me that I am, in fact, happy and that you and steffy are the reason. And that -- that is my christmas bonus.",
        "Dr. Campbell: I need you to understand that we might be doing this a little bit early. If there's no fetal cells in your blood, then we obviously can't run the test.",
        "Steffy: Okay, so, like, we wait like a week or two and then we try again?",
        "Dr. Campbell: Basically.",
        "Steffy: I at least want to try. I'm losing my mind as it is.",
        "Dr. Campbell: And that's not healthy for you or the baby, so let's give it a shot.",
        "Steffy: I have liam's toothbrush. It's from his travel kit.",
        "Dr. Campbell: You're confident no one else has used it?",
        "Steffy: No, I only touched the holder. And I have this.",
        "Dr. Campbell: The hairs of the second man.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, pulled and bagged himself.",
        "Dr. Campbell: Well, good job of protecting the samples from contamination. I'll, uh, confirm with our lab that these samples are viable and get the process going. Are you okay?",
        "Steffy: Hmm? Uh, yeah, I will be. I hope so.",
        "Katie: Do you ever wish that...",
        "Wyatt: Guess what I'm wishing for right now.",
        "Katie: What if I said something crazy to you?",
        "Wyatt: You're under the impression that you don't do that now?",
        "[ Chuckles ]",
        "Katie: No, I mean something crazier, like maybe we should take in a movie or catch a laker game.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. That kind of crazy.",
        "Katie: I mean, I've never really had a relationship that takes place behind closed doors, so I'm still trying to figure out what the rules are.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I'm sure they're listed online somewhere.",
        "Katie: Hmm. That's funny.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. No, I think that our number-one rule should be that we please ourselves. I mean, you are sexy, wild, you're a lot of fun.",
        "Katie: And festive.",
        "Wyatt: And very festive, and I appreciate that. And I-I love spending time with you. But I don't think there's another person on this planet that thinks that you and I are a good idea. And frankly, I don't want to hear from them.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I don't want to hear from them, either.",
        "Wyatt: So, I say that we keep doing this until we find something else we want to do. I don't know. I mean, just some people are so worried about the future that they -- they forget to have a present.",
        "Katie: You know what I like about you?",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Katie: You're so sensible.",
        "Wyatt: I used to think the same thing about you until i found this wild side that I am just so in love with.",

        "Katie: Oh, man. I have always wanted to do that.",
        "Wyatt: You are so excited about it.",
        "Katie: [ Laughs ] But don't worry. I haven't left my practicality behind. You have a brand new shirt, you know, right there in the closet.",

        "Bill: Just leave wyatt to me. In fact, listen, I'm gonna give both you boys something epic. You'll see.",
        "Liam: Oh, that's sweet, but too late. Steffy already gave me a christmas surprise that even you can't top.",
        "Bill: Well, what might that be?",
        "Liam: Actually, speaking of which, do you mind if I give my wife a little call?",
        "Bill: Well, she's -- she's probably, uh, at work, right? I mean, she's not home.",

        "Steffy: Does it matter where you take it from?",
        "Dr. Campbell: Your arm's fine. The baby's cells are either in your blood or they aren'T.",
        "Steffy: It's just the -- the less noticeable, the better.",
        "Dr. Campbell: I'll be careful. I'll avoid bruising.",

        "Katie: Wow. They're, um... they're beautiful.",
        "Wyatt: But you hate them?",
        "Katie: No. No, I don'T. It's just that, um, in my experience, men generally give women jewelry when they feel guilty about something.",
        "Wyatt: Ah, like a payoff.",
        "Katie: Yeah, like a bribe. \"Don't look over here where i really screwed up. Look at this, like, beautiful, shiny thing.\"",

        "Liam: The paternity leave. I mean, I was so excited to retool the maternity leave into extended parental leave, and i could have sworn you were gonna roll it back. But you didn't roll it back.",

And because I didn't have one, to me, that just sounded like \"blah blah blah blah.\" But when you say it, you really mean it. For the first time in my life, i mean it, too. Dad. I love you.
