        "[ Knocking on door ]\r\n",
        "Brooke: Stephanie. I heard \r\nabout Felicia. I'm so sorry. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************",
        "Jackie: You have a son \r\nwith Felicia? My grandson? ",
        "Nick: Dominick. \n",
        "Jackie: Dominick? Oh, \r\nNicky. ",
        "Nick: I know. I haven't \r\nquite gotten used to it myself yet, either. ",
        "Jackie: You're a father.\r\n",
        "Nick: Believe me, it's the \r\nlast thing I expected when Felicia came back to town. ",
        "Jackie: That's why she did \r\ncome back when she did. She obviously thought that you and -- and then she found \r\nout that you were married to Bridget and you were expecting a child of your own.\r\n",
        "Nick: I don't think \r\nFelicia said anything because she really didn't want to complicate our lives by \r\ntelling me that I have a son. ",
        "Jackie: She was really \r\ngoing to go back to France without saying anything? ",
        "Nick: Well, then Stephanie \r\ngot involved, of course, and the truth came out. ",
        "Jackie: Stephanie? Well, I \r\nnever thought I would say this, but I'm actually grateful to the woman. If she \r\nhadn't, Felicia -- oh, I can't believe she's dying. I mean, she's never going to \r\nsee her little boy grow up. That little boy is never going to know his mother. \r\nIt's heartbreaking. ",
        "\r\n********************************************************************",
        "Brooke: I realize that I'm \r\nprobably the last person you want to see right now. ",
        "Stephanie: And yet you're \r\nhere. ",
        "Brooke: Because I'm a \r\nmother, too. And the thought of losing a daughter to cancer -- ",
        "Stephanie: I don't want \r\nany pity, especially from you. And I don't want -- I don't want any phony \r\nconcerns. It's obvious to me why you're here. It's another one of these schemes \r\nto get the company back, like the last one you pulled with Eric. ",
        "Brooke: No. No, that is \r\nnot why I'm here. And just for the record, I went along with Eric reluctantly, \r\nbecause I knew you would see right through it. ",
        "Stephanie: Because it's as \r\nphony as you are insincere. Now just go. You don't make things better by being \r\nhere, you just make it worse, all right? Please, go. ",
        "\r\n************************************************************************",
        "Nick: So are you okay with \r\nthese change of plans? ",
        "Jackie: Celebrating \r\nChristmas at Forrester's instead of at your place? ",
        "Nick: Felicia asked for \r\nit. She wants the family to be together. ",
        "Jackie: Of course she did, \r\nI understand that. It's just that I don't think I should be part of it. \n",
        "Nick: Why? Because of \r\nStephanie? I don't get it. ",
        "Jackie: Actually, I was \r\nthinking more of Eric. ",
        "Nick: Eric? You don't \r\nthink he'd want you there? ",
        "Jackie: Let's just say I \r\nsuspect that it's not entirely over between those two. Anyway, I mean, couldn't \r\nyou and Bridget stop by here afterward? We could open our presents then. Have a \r\nglass of holiday cheer. ",
        "Nick: What about your \r\ngrandson, Mother? ",
        "Jackie: You can give him a \r\nbig hug and a big kiss for me. ",
        "Nick: Oh, come on, you \r\nknow you'd rather do that yourself, admit it. ",
        "Jackie: Of course I would, \r\njust not tomorrow at the Forrester's. Oh, look at the time. Look, get out of \r\nhere. Go back to your lovely wife, please. ",
        "Nick: Sometimes -- if you \r\nchange your mind -- Merry Christmas, Mother. ",
        "Jackie: Merry Christmas, \r\nNicky. I love you. ",
        "Nick: I love you, too.\r\n",
        "\r\n********************************************************************************",
        "Brooke: Are you sure \r\nyou're all right? ",
        "Stephanie: Why do people \r\nalways ask that question at the darkest moment of your life? And why do we \r\nalways, all of us, always do the same thing and say, \"yes.\" When you know it's \r\nnever, ever, ever going to be all right again. ",
        "Brooke: I'm sorry, \r\nStephanie. ",
        "Stephanie: Felicia --\r\n",
        "Brooke: I'm aware that the \r\ntwo of you never really got along, but knowing what she's facing now -- \n",
        "Stephanie: Actually, \r\nthat's how I realized how serious it was. It was the first time in her life that \r\nshe didn't shut me out. ",
        "Brooke: Well, that just \r\nshows you how much she really does need you, regardless of all the problems that \r\nyou've had. ",
        "[ Stephanie sighs ] \n",
        "Stephanie: None of them \r\nmatter a damn, do they? Why? Why did it take her dying for me to realize that?\r\n",
        "\r\n*********************************************************************",
        "Nick: A pregnant elf?\r\n",
        "Bridget: Oh, you scared \r\nme! ",
        "Nick: How does Santa feel \r\nabout that? ",
        "Bridget: I didn't hear you \r\ncome in. ",
        "Nick: Well, I'm in. \n",
        "Bridget: Well? ",
        "Nick: That's pretty cute.\r\n",
        "Bridget: Mr. Marone?\r\n",
        "Nick: Yes? ",
        "Bridget: Have you been \r\nnaughty or nice this year? ",
        "Nick: Well, there are some \r\nmixed reviews on that one. But I'm trying desperately to redeem myself. \n",
        "Bridget: Presents. That's \r\na very good start. ",
        "Nick: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Bridget: Are these for me? \r\nWhat is this one? ",
        "Nick: Put it down. You \r\ncan't open these until Christmas morning. That's tradition. ",
        "Bridget: But we always \r\nopened all of ours on Christmas eve when I was little. ",
        "Nick: Christmas eve? So, \r\nwhat, Santa just came down the chimney and gave you a new batch of presents in \r\nthe morning? I mean, what a racket you Forrester kids got going. ",
        "Bridget: But you still \r\nlove me anyway, don't you? ",
        "Nick: I love you. And I \r\nlove you. And I especially love our son Dominick. ",
        "\r\n******************************************************************",
        "[ Door bell rings ] \n",
        "Jackie: Okay, I've got it. \r\nYou're so forgetful. Sometimes I don't know what I taught -- Eric. ",
        "Eric: Is this a bad time?\r\n",
        "Jackie: Yes. No, no, it's \r\nnot. Nicky was -- oh, come in, come in. ",
        "Eric: Nick told you about \r\nFelicia? ",
        "Jackie: Yes. I hardly know \r\nwhat to say. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************************",
        "Nick: Next year, after the \r\nkids go to bed, what if I went on top of the roof and sort of just pranced \r\naround? Maybe they'd think it was Santa's reindeer. ",
        "Bridget: What would happen \r\nif you fell off the roof while you were prancing? ",
        "Nick: Oh, yeah. I guess \r\nit's a good thing I married a doctor, huh? Let's get this whole present opening \r\nthing out of the way, too. This Forrester Christmas eve tradition. I mean, what \r\nthe hell is that about? ",
        "Bridget: Well, how about \r\nthis? Since we are starting our own family, maybe we should come up with our own \r\ntraditions. ",
        "Nick: I love that. \r\nCompromise. That's a good idea. It's very healthy in a relationship, so we'll \r\nopen one tonight and we'll open the rest tomorrow morning. Are we good to that?\r\n",
        "Bridget: Okay. ",
        "Nick: Are we good? \n",
        "Bridget: Where are you \r\ngoing? ",
        "Nick: There was a special \r\ndelivery by Santa last night. We got red chrome wheels, convertible top. \n",
        "Bridget: Oh, my -- Nick \r\nMarone, you didn't! ",
        "Nick: Nothing but the top \r\nof the line for our new brood, babe. ",
        "Bridget: Oh my gosh, I \r\nlove it. ",
        "Nick: It's great, isn't \r\nit? ",
        "[ Nick laughs ] \n",
        "Bridget: I love it. I love \r\nyou. I love us. Are you ready for your present now? ",
        "Nick: My present? You gave \r\nme the biggest present I could ever ask for, when you said you'd be a mother to \r\nDominick. ",
        "\r\n***************************************************************",
        "Eric: Not supposed to be \r\nlike this. We're the parents. We were supposed to go first. And now my little \r\ngirl is just -- Felicia's always been so fearless, living her life on her own \r\nterms. And now -- ",
        "Jackie: She's facing death \r\nthe same way. ",
        "Eric: Yeah. No regrets. No \r\nrecriminations. No \"I could have done things differently.\" Everything is just -- \r\nnow it's all about that little baby. Our grandson. ",
        "Jackie: I can't wait to \r\nmeet him. ",
        "Eric: That's why I'm here. \r\nI want you to come to the house tomorrow. It's so important that you come.\r\n",
        "Jackie: Oh, Eric. It's not \r\na good idea. ",
        "Eric: Are you worried \r\nabout Stephanie? ",
        "Jackie: You know how she \r\nfeels about me. I mean, one dodgy word, and one of us is going to be wearing \r\nthat turkey. ",
        "Eric: Ordinarily, I would \r\nagree, but under the circumstances, with the baby and everything. Unless there's \r\nsomething else that's bothering you. ",
        "Jackie: Now is not the \r\ntime to get into it. ",
        "Eric: It's you and me, \r\nisn't it? Our relationship. ",
        "Jackie: Or lack of. I'm \r\nsorry, I shouldn't have said that. It's just, Eric, your family needs you right \r\nnow. Your daughter needs you. Stephanie needs you. ",
        "Eric: I need you. Don't \r\nyou believe that? ",
        "Jackie: You know I want \r\nto. You know I'm vulnerable to you. But I can't get hurt again, that's all.\r\n",
        "Eric: Jackie, I'm sorry.\r\n",
        "Jackie: No, I'm sorry. \r\nYou've got enough to deal with. You don't need anything else. ",
        "Eric: I need you. Jackie, \r\nyou're so -- you're so important to me. Jackie, I thought you understood how \r\nmuch -- ",
        "Jackie: So did I. That was \r\nbefore the night at the beach house. Eric, there I was, standing in Brooke's \r\nlingerie, expecting you to propose, and instead, you told me that -- I've just \r\nnever been so humiliated in my life. And I won't set myself up for that again. I \r\nwon't. ",
        "Eric: Jackie. ",
        "Jackie: Especially as I \r\ndon't really know who I am to you. I don't know how I fit into your life. I \r\ndon't know what kind of future you see for us. Even if there is a future for us.\r\n",
        "Eric: Jackie, Jackie. \r\nJackie, stop, stop. Stop. ",
        "\r\n***********************************************************************",
        "Stephanie: Well, \r\nregardless of all that, Felicia wants us to all be together for Christmas. \r\nIncluding you and your children, so I expect you to be here for her sake. \n",
        "Brooke: Sounds more like \r\nan order than an invitation. ",
        "Stephanie: Since when have \r\nyou ever taken orders? Unless it was in the bedroom and you were wearing your \r\nFrench maid's outfit. ",
        "Brooke: Fine, we'll be \r\nthere. Although it does seem a little strange after everything that's gone on \r\nthis year. All of us together in the same room. ",
        "Stephanie: Well, that's \r\nthe truth. But families need to come together at a time like this. Although, I'm \r\nsure after Christmas you'll be back to your usual tricks. ",
        "Brooke: Which is nothing \r\ncompared to what Felicia is going through, or what my mother went through years \r\nago -- battling cancer. ",
        "Stephanie: But Beth \r\nsurvived. My daughter's not going to. ",
        "Brooke: You thought you \r\nknew the reason I came over here. But this is the real reason. My mother gave it \r\nto me. It's from the book \"the prophet.\" I made a copy for you. I thought it \r\nmight help in some small way. I'll just leave it here on the table. ",
        "[ Stephanie reading ]\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Your children \r\nare not your children, they are the sons and daughters of life's longing for \r\nitself. They come through you, but not from you. And though they are with you, \r\nyet they belong not to you. You may give them your love, but not your thoughts, \r\nfor they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies, but not their \r\nsouls. For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, \r\nnot even in your dreams. ",
        "\r\n****************************************************",
        "Nick: Ohh! These are cool! \r\nThey're, what? Ski socks, right? They must be warm. Did you make these? \n",
        "Bridget: No, silly! \r\nThey're Christmas stockings. ",
        "Nick: Oh, oh, I see.\r\n",
        "Bridget: See, look, \r\nthere's one for you. ",
        "[ Nick laughs ] \n",
        "Bridget: One for me. One \r\nfor Dominick. And, isn't this cute? This one's waiting to be embroidered with \r\nour baby's name on it. Whatever is that we finally decide on. ",
        "Nick: Well, I guess we'd \r\nbetter decide then, shouldn't we? ",
        "Bridget: Yes. ",
        "Nick: We'll come up with \r\nsomething. How about this? We can just call her \"Mistletoe Marone.\" ",
        "[ Bridget laughs ] Huh? \r\nLittle mistletoe. ",
        "Bridget: I have an idea.\r\n",
        "Nick: Hmm? ",
        "Bridget: Why don't we hang \r\nthese by the chimney with care? ",
        "Nick: All right. \n",
        "Bridget: Here. You take \r\nthat one. ",
        "Nick: Okay. You kind of \r\nfeel it, don't you? ",
        "Bridget: What? ",
        "Nick: That we're sort of \r\nsmack in the middle of a Norman Rockwell painting. ",
        "Bridget: Oh, what's the \r\nmatter? Is this just way too much domestic bliss for you? ",
        "Nick: Truth? I never, ever \r\nthought I would have anything like this. You, a wife. A family. I mean, a \r\nChristmas tree? That just was never part of my package. I guess the good lord \r\njust smiled down and said, \"here you go.\" And he put it in just one beautiful \r\ngift. You're going to be such a great mom. And I can't wait to share that with \r\nyou. ",
        "Bridget: You're going to \r\nbe such a great dad. You already are. ",
        "Nick: I love you. I love \r\nthis little family. I love us. "
