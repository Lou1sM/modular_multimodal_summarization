        "At Brooke's Liam paces the floor and tells her that he's been up all night. He's been calling Hope, texting her and she is not answering or responding. Brooke says can he blame Hope \u0096 Steffy again. He says whoa; this is all just a big misunderstanding. Brooke says Hope did not come home last night and she does not know where she is. And Brooke probably wouldn't even tell him if she knew. He says okay, be mad at him but do it later. He needs to find Hope now. He knows he has screwed up royally. Brooke wants to know what Steffy said or that Hope could have seen. Liam says nothing happened. He did not know Steffy was coming but she had incredible news. She can now have a baby. She got emotional and he gave her a hug, Brooke scolds him for things like this always happening with Steffy. Liam just needs to let Hope go and let her go be with someone who makes her happy. It dawns on him that Brooke is talking about Wyatt. He thought he had left town. In Hawaii Hope is in her hotel room looking out over the blue ocean. There is a knock at the door and it's Wyatt. He is holding an orchid. He says he looked all over to find a flower that was worthy of her and this was the closest he could find. He wants to call room service for breakfast but Hope says she is good. Wyatt says okay then promise him she will have lunch with him. He doesn't want her to get all light headed on him. He says they did not really talk much last night. Is she ready to tell him what she saw at the cabin? She says she saw Steffy in Liam's arms. She doesn't know what happened after that; she didn't stick around. He says it's okay; she will be okay as she is with him now. She's safe. Hope says she didn't stick around to hear more justifications or excuses or even the smug look on Steffy's face ..you know the one that says see I can get him back anytime I want him. They were looking into each other's eyes like they were the only ones on the planet. Wyatt asks if she saw them in the cabin. She says yes as Liam was getting dressed there. Wyatt doesn't understand why Hope would be seeing Liam just before the wedding. She says it was Liam's idea. He sent her a note to meet him. Wyatt says that doesn't make sense since Steffy was there. Hope says Wyatt doesn't know Steffy and that's one of the things she likes about him. She says it's obvious; it's classic Steffy just wanting Hope to see them. She was letting Hope know that things haven't changed. She will always be part of his life. Hope says she thinks she is just now understanding that ..message delivered, message received. Donna is shocked to find Quinn sitting in Eric's office and sipping champagne. Donna says Quinn should be cleaning out her desk, not taking over Eric's office. Looking smug, Quinn says guess the word is not out yet but Hope hired them back. QAJ's is here to stay. Donna says she is calling security. Quinn says that would only accomplish two things. She would look incredibly foolish and she would piss Quinn off. Donna says then maybe Quinn can tell her what happened. Quinn says a terrible wrong was righted. Liam went on a power trip and Hope's personal life spilled over into her professional. But power is fleeting and Liam's is gone. Donna says this must have something to do with Hope walking out on the wedding. Quinn says Bingo. But it's Hope's story to tell. All she can tell Donna is that she does know where Hope is. She is with Wyatt and they are away and when they return they will be an item and will secure their position here. So Donna does not want to be on her bad side. Just be nice and respectful and everything will be fine. Cheers. Quinn pours herself another glass of bubbly and says life is fascinating. This time last year she and Wyatt were in their little warehouse, toiling away and struggling for survival. Now look at them. Partnering with FC on one of the hottest lines going; the possibilities are endless. But she guesses Donna would not feel like celebrating the return of the dreaded Quinn. Donna says she guesses that is in reference to Eric. Quinn admits that he likes her. Donna grins and says Eric doesn't really know Quinn. Donna has a clearer picture. Quinn says it would not pay for Donna to try and sabotage her. Donna replies she has a feeling Quinn will not need help on that one. Quinn says she has worked far too long and too hard and things are finally paying off for her and Wyatt. Donna warns Quinn a word of advice. Hope and Liam have been here before. They plan a wedding and something always happens with Steffy. But here's the thing; they always end up back together. Quinn gloats that there is always a last time for everything. Hope and Wyatt are on the beautiful island of Hawaii. It is the perfect opportunity for him to convince her to choose him. And her son can be very convincing. Brooke tells Liam that she can't believe he let this thing happen. Just seeing Steffy there would devastate Hope. He snaps that she is acting like he set this in motion. He didn't know Steffy was going to be there; she just showed up. He doesn't even know why Hope was at the cabin in the first place. Brooke says because of the note that Liam sent. He argues that he did not send a note. Brooke says maybe Steffy then. Then he blurts out \u0096 that damn woman, Quinn. She has set him up again. Hope is mad right now but she has to come home and he will explain all that is going on right now. For now he is going to have it out with Quinn. Quinn offers Donna champagne but she declines. She tells Quinn that she likes Wyatt. He's smart, funny, even handsome and some day he will make a lucky girl very happy. Quinn says that will be Hope; just look at how her eyes light up now that Liam is out of the picture. Donna says that is just it. He will be back in Hope's life soon. They've had years of obstacles in their way and only came out stronger. Not just Steffy but Bill as well. They have overcome them all. Quinn says Hope and Wyatt are just at the beginning of their connection and they finally have the chance to do what they have been prepping for both personally and professionally which means QAJ is here for the long haul. She says she is a fact of Donna's life so deal with it.",
        "Wyatt says he won't be a hypocrite. He's not sorry that she did not marry Liam, but he is sorry that he got hurt. She says you live and learn. She just wishes she weren't learning the same old thing over and over and over. Wyatt says Liam is the idiot. He treats her badly, always letting her down, betraying her trust and then takes her for granted that she will always be there. She shouldn't have to put up with that. She agrees. Wyatt says it is a good thing she is not home as Liam would be there beating down the door trying to explain again. She says she knows. His explanations are always logical and innocent but to her they will always be unacceptable. Quinn pours another glass and Liam comes bounding in and says she set him up. He won't even bother to explain it as she knows it all. She wrote the note. She says she knows he is upset over another derailed wedding to Hope and is looking for someone to blame. She adds but until he cools off she has absolutely no intentions of talking to him. He tells her she is not getting away with this. Quinn walks right past Donna and tells her to shut up. Brooke is happy to hear from Hope and that she is all right but Hope doesn't want to say where she is. Brooke tells her Liam was just there so she knows all about Steffy, but there is something Hope should know. Hope doesn't want to hear it now. She says she is exhausted and it always comes back to the same old thing \u0096 Steffy. Hope is just done. Wyatt says he has a great idea. How about they spend their holidays in Hawaii. Hope does not hesitate for a second and says yes. Liam talks to Donna and says he can't prove it but his gut is screaming that Quinn sent the note. Donna says she wouldn't put it past her as she was in here sitting in Eric's office like she owned it drinking his champagne and bragging how Hope and Wyatt were in Hawaii. Liam bolts and tells Donna that he owes her one. Hope says she wanted to be so sure of Liam this time but she knows it is so wrong to get married as the result of an ultimatum. She says she tried to tell herself she was okay with Steffy but it will never be ok. Wyatt says then let Liam go in the past where he belongs. Wyatt can make her happy and she knows that. He says he has been patient and he was gracious in defeat, but Liam messed up again. Let this be the last time. He tells her that he loves her .more than he ever thought he could love someone. They are in Hawaii together now. There is no better place to start their lives. Just give them a chance; she won't regret it. He kisses her and then two or three more. When she puts her arm around his neck there is no engagement ring on her finger."

        "Brooke: Can you blame her, Liam? I mean, really. Steffy? Again?",
        "Liam: Whoa-oh! Whoa, whoa! This is not -- all this is is a misunderstanding, Brooke. Is she upstairs? Where is she? I got to talk --",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Liam: Okay. At Forrester?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Liam: Where is she, Brooke?",
        "Brooke: I don't know.",
        "Liam: You don't know, or you're not telling me?",
        "Brooke: To tell you the truth, even if I knew, I probably wouldn't tell you.",
        "Liam: Okay. You know what? You're upset with me? Fine! You want to yell at me? You want to lecture me? Go ahead, just do it after --",
        "Brooke: Hope didn't come home last night.",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: I, uh... I searched for a flower that was worthy of you. And this was the closest I could find, so...",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: [Chuckles] You should be clearing out your things, not making yourself at home in Eric's office.",
        "Quinn: I guess word hasn't gotten out yet. Hope hired us back. Quinn Artisan Jewelers is here to stay.",
        "Donna: I'm calling security.",
        "Quinn: That would accomplish two things. One -- you would look incredibly foolish. And two -- you would really piss me off.",
        "Donna: Why don't you just tell me what happened?",
        "Quinn: An incredible wrong was righted. Liam was on a power trip, thought dictating Hope's personal life extended into the professional. [Sighs] But power is fleeting, and Liam's is gone.",
        "Donna: Okay, I assume this has something to do with, uh, Hope walking out on the wedding?",
        "Quinn: Bingo.",
        "Donna: And you know why?",
        "Quinn: Well, I think that that is Hope's story to tell. But I do know where she is.",
        "Donna: Let me guess -- not at Brooke's.",
        "Quinn: No, she is away... with Wyatt. And they're gonna come back an item and secure our position here. So... you really don't want to get on my bad side. Be nice...respectful... and we should be just fine. Cheers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Oh, this is so massively screwed up.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] So, what happened? What did Hope see between you and Steffy?",
        "Liam: Nothing!",
        "Brooke: She wouldn't just take off because of nothing.",
        "Liam: Okay, well, what did she say to you?",
        "Brooke: Not much. She went down to the cabin, and when she came back, she said she was calling off the wedding. She didn't even say anything about Steffy. You're the one who told me about her. So what was going on between the two of you?",
        "Liam: Talking! We were talking! She had some good news! She -- she had some...incredible news, actually. She... she can have a baby now. She's been getting some treatments, and -- and they've been successful. And that's amazing!",
        "Brooke: Well, that's good. I'm very happy for her.",
        "Liam: Yeah. So am I. Uh, so am I, especially after everything we've been through. She got a little emotional, I gave her a hug, and that was it. She left.",
        "Brooke: So, did she try to get you back?",
        "Liam: Uh, it was pretty clear that that wasn't gonna happen.",
        "Brooke: So, she did.",
        "Liam: What does it even matter?! It's not happening! I just need to make sure Hope is clear about that.",
        "Brooke: You know how sensitive Hope is with the issue of you and Steffy!",
        "Liam: Brooke, nothing happened!",
        "Brooke: It doesn't really matter, right? Because something could happen. Steffy always shows up. She pops up conveniently the minute you're going to marry Hope! Why don't you just leave her alone? Let her be with somebody who makes her happy.",
        "Liam: Are you -- are you talking about Wyatt?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Man, I thought Wyatt was good and gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] You have breakfast yet? I can call room service.",
        "Hope: I'm good.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Well, promise me that you'll have lunch with me. And then I'll let it go. I don't want you to get lightheaded, okay?",
        "Hope: Okay. I promise.",
        "Wyatt: You know, you didn't really talk that much last night. You ready to talk about what you saw?",
        "Hope: Um... yeah. Uh, I saw Steffy in Liam's arms.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, geez.",
        "Hope: I don't really know what happened after that. I didn't stick around to find out.",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Its okay. You're okay. You're here with me now. You're safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Life is fascinating. Isn't it? I mean, a year ago, Wyatt and I were in our little warehouse, toiling away, struggling for survival. And now look at us. [Scoffs] Partnered with Forrester Creations on the hottest line going. Possibilities are endless. Can you blame me for wanting to celebrate? Oh, hey. Would you like a glass of champagne?",
        "Donna: It's a little early for me.",
        "Quinn: Also, I'm pretty sure you're... not really interested in celebrating...least of all the return of the dreaded Quinn.",
        "Donna: Okay. I'm assuming that this is a reference to Eric.",
        "Quinn: He likes me.",
        "Donna: Mm. [Chuckles] He doesn't really know you.",
        "Quinn: Do you think you do?",
        "Donna: Let's just say I have a clearer picture.",
        "Quinn: It would not be wise to sabotage me.",
        "Donna: I get the feeling you're not gonna need any help on that one.",
        "Quinn: That's not gonna happen. I have waited too long, and I have worked too hard, and things are finally paying off for Wyatt and me.",
        "Donna: A word of advice?",
        "Quinn: Sure, Donna. Why not?",
        "Donna: You see, Hope... and Liam have been here before, a few times. You know, they plan a wedding, and something happens with Steffy. But here's the thing. They always end up back together.",
        "Quinn: Well, there is a last time for everything. Wyatt is with Hope right now on the beautiful island of Hawaii. It is the perfect opportunity for him to convince her to choose him. And believe me... my son can be extremely convincing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: So, you -- you didn't... tell Liam and Steffy? You didn't talk to them? You didn't tell them you were there, or...",
        "Hope: No. For what? Just so I could hear more justifications or lame excuses? No. Or to see the smug look on Steffy's face, the one that says, \"Um, see? I can have him back whenever I want him.\" Nah, I wasn't interested. I just, um... I walked away, and then... [Sighs] And then I walked out.",
        "Wyatt: What were they doing?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles softly] Same old, same old. Locked in each other's eyes, the only two people on the planet.",
        "Wyatt: You saw him in the cabin?",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm. Yeah, Liam was getting ready there.",
        "Wyatt: And you wanted to see Liam before the wedding?",
        "Hope: Uh, no. Other way around, actually.",
        "Wyatt: I don't understand.",
        "Hope: Well, I got a note that said, \"Break tradition. Come see me at the cabin.\"",
        "Wyatt: But that doesn't even make sense. Why would Liam do that if he knew Steffy was there? That --",
        "Hope: Isn't it obvious?",
        "Wyatt: Apparently not.",
        "Hope: I forget you don't know Steffy. That's one of the things I like most about you. Um... this is classic Steffy. She wanted me to see them together. She wanted me to know that things hadn't changed, that she was always gonna be a part of his life. I feel like I'm... I'm finally understanding that. Message delivered. Message received.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: I don't even understand how you could allow this to happen. You must know that seeing you and Steffy together would devastate Hope.",
        "Liam: What are you -- what are you -- you're acting like I set this in motion. I didn't. I wasn't expecting Steffy. She just showed up.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, right before you were getting married. How convenient is that? How did Steffy even know where you were going to be?",
        "Liam: I don't know! It wasn't exactly a secret that Hope and I were getting married.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] But you were in the cabin.",
        "Liam: Yeah! Maybe she was walking arou-- I don't know! Does it even matter? I mean, I told her I'm committed to a future with Hope, so...",
        "Brooke: And she was fine with that.",
        "Liam: Yes, of course she was, because she's heard me say it a million times before! I've said it to you! I've said it to her! I've said it to Hope, Wyatt, my dad -- anybody who will listen! Why was Hope even at the cabin in the first place?",
        "Brooke: Because of your note. You asked her to come.",
        "Liam: \"My note\"?",
        "Brooke: Yes, your note.",
        "Liam: I-I asked her to come?",
        "Brooke: Yes! You said, \"Forget tradition and come meet me down in the cabin.\"",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Brooke, I didn't write a note.",
        "Brooke: Then Steffy did.",
        "Liam: No, it wasn't S-- unbelievable.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Liam: That damn woman.",
        "Brooke: Who?",
        "Liam: Quinn. She set me up again. I knew -- I knew there was something off about Quinn from the very beginning.",
        "Brooke: You really think Quinn wrote that note?",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah. Yeah! Who else? Quinn would do anything to get Wyatt and Hope together. She wrote the note -- trust me.",
        "Brooke: Interesting theory. But it still doesn't change what happened. Hope found you and Steffy in an intimate situation moments before you and Hope were going to get married. So if she's had enough --",
        "Liam: What -- you think I'm just gonna take this as a sign that Hope and I are over? No, look! She's upset right now. She's hiding out. Fine. But she's got to come back eventually. And when she does, I'm gonna explain what's going on right now.",
        "Brooke: You can certainly try.",
        "Liam: In the meantime, there is actually something else I can do.",
        "Brooke: Where are you going?",
        "Liam: Have it out with Quinn!",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Mm, this is so good. Are you sure you won't join me?",
        "Donna: No, thanks. Listen, Quinn. Wyatt is great.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Donna: He is. He's -- he's smart. He's funny. He's handsome. And someday, he's gonna make a young woman very lucky.",
        "Quinn: Mm, that would be Hope.",
        "Donna: No, I don't think so.",
        "Quinn: You've seen them together, how he lights her up. And now, with Liam out of the way --",
        "Donna: Yeah, see, that's just it. I think what you're doing is underestimating their connection. You see, they have been through so much... and not just with Steffy. Bill interfered horribly in that relationship. And all these obstacles...have only made them stronger.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt and Hope are at the beginning of their connection. They're finally getting the chance to start the life that they've been prepping for, both personally... and professionally, which means Quinn Artisan Jewelers is here for the long haul. I'm a fact of your life, Donna. Deal with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: Look, I won't be a hypocrite, but... I am glad you didn't get married to Liam. But I'm sorry that you got hurt.",
        "Hope: You live and you learn. I just wish that I wasn't learning the same lesson over and over and over again. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Liam's the idiot. The way that he lets you down -- he betrays your trust, he takes you for granted, and then he treats you any kind of way and just expects you to be there, eager for more disrespect? I don't get that. And you shouldn't have to put up with it.",
        "Hope: I agree.",
        "Wyatt: You know... its good that you're not home... 'cause Liam would just be there, beating down your door, trying to explain again.",
        "Hope: Oh, like I haven't heard every reason in the book why he would be with Steffy. [Sighs] But the thing -- the thing is, his explanations are always very logical and always very innocent.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Hope: But for me... it will always be unacceptable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: You set me up.",
        "Quinn: I beg your pardon?",
        "Liam: Hope got a note supposedly written -- why am I even bothering to explain this to you? You know exactly what was written on the note because you wrote it!",
        "Quinn: Liam, you're obviously very upset.",
        "Liam: You think?",
        "Quinn: And probably looking for someone to blame for yet another derailed wedding to Hope.",
        "Liam: Oh, I am looking right at her.",
        "Quinn: And I don't particularly like the way that you're doing it. It makes me feel...vaguely threatened. So until you cool off, I have absolutely no intention of talking to you.",
        "Liam: You're not getting away with this, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Shut up, Donna.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I'm so relieved to hear from you.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I figured you'd be worried. I just -- I wanted to let you know that I'm okay.",
        "Brooke: Where are you?",
        "Hope: I'd rather not say. [Sighs] I just -- I need some time.",
        "Brooke: Away from Liam. He was just here. He told me about Steffy.",
        "Hope: Oh, good. So, you -- you know why I left.",
        "Brooke: Yes, but, Honey, there's something that you don't know.",
        "Hope: No. Mom, I-I-I don't even want to talk about it. All these years, I've been with Liam, and it's -- it's always come back around to the same thing. It comes back around to Steffy. And I... I'm just so... exhausted, and I'm... done.",
        "Brooke: I understand.",
        "Hope: I got to go, okay, Mom? I love you very much. Bye.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wyatt: I just got an idea.",
        "Hope: Hmm?",
        "Wyatt: A great idea, actually.",
        "Hope: Yeah? What's that?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. What do you say... if we spend our holidays here in Hawaii?",
        "Hope: Well, let me think about that for a second. Yes. Yes! You know what? I say yes to that.",
        "Wyatt: Good. That's good.",
        "Hope: Good. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Okay, so, you think that Quinn deliberately sent Hope to the cabin, knowing Steffy was there?",
        "Liam: I mean, uh, y-yeah. I can't prove it, but my gut is screaming.",
        "Donna: I wouldn't put it past that woman.",
        "Liam: Not a fan?",
        "Donna: She's awful!",
        "Liam: Thank you!",
        "Donna: I mean, she's so smug and condescending -- making herself at home in Eric's office, drinking his champagne.",
        "Liam: Right?",
        "Donna: I mean -- [Scoffs] Anyway... she was... [Sighs] She was bragging about watt and Hope.",
        "Liam: Bragging? W-w-- uh, what about?",
        "Donna: Apparently, they went to Hawaii.",
        "Liam: I owe you one, Donna.",
        "Donna: Good luck!",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Donna: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: I wanted to be so sure of my relationship with Liam this time. But I think... I think you have to know that something's wrong when your wedding is the product of an ultimatum. I just... I can't handle Steffy being a part of Liam's life, and I told myself that I could. I told myself it would be okay, but it's just... it will never be okay with me.",
        "Wyatt: So put Liam in the past... where he belongs. I can make you happy. You know I can. [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: [Sighs deeply] Mm.",
        "Wyatt: I've been patient. I respected your decision to get married, and I even tried to be gracious in defeat. But Liam messed up again! Let this be the last time! I mean, I love you, Hope... more than I ever knew I could love someone. And we're here now... together...in Hawaii, of all places. I mean, what better place to start the rest of our lives? Give us a chance. I promise you, you won't regret it."
