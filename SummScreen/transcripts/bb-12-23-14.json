        "Pam shows Ivy and Maya a musical miniature carousel in Rick's office. She says it has been in the Forrester family for years. Maya is delighted to hear there will be an open house at Eric's on Christmas Day and hopes she is invited. Both Pam and Ivy scoff at the idea as being too awkward. Rick assures her Eric said all are welcome but they pay the price of admission by helping out at the mission and feeding the homeless. Maya calls out Ivy about being so bright and cheerful after what she did last night. Rick wants to know what's the matter. Maya promptly tells him that Ivy came by to see her last night and it wasn't to bring her a housewarming gift. She confronted her about their kiss. Rick glares at Ivy and then tells her she is not to mention that again if she enjoys working here. He hopes she understands that. Ivy says she is concerned about him and Caroline. She knows he still loves Caroline and that is why he is lashing out. He tells her that he told her to drop this. John tells Jarrett that it's been too long since Pam lost her little dog and it's time to put a smile on that face again. He says his own tail is wagging just thinking about this. Pam will love it. Pam finds a morose Wyatt who is trying to work but not making much progress. She asks about Hope and he says yeah he talked to her last night for about five seconds. She is not coming home for Christmas. Pam tries to cheer him by saying perhaps she did not want her mom to spend it alone. She shows him a photo of Tiny, her best friend, who passed away several years ago. She tells Wyatt that Eric is having an open house on Christmas and he really should come and not be alone that day. He thanks her but says he thinks he will just lay low. John pops in to surprise Pam and asks what does a man have to do to get a hug around here, so she obliges. He asks is Chuck here and she says no Charlie is not working today. John says great then his wish has been granted, now to Pam's wish. Rick tells Maya that he doesn't like it that Ivy knows. Maya says it will be okay, she won't say anything. She wants to protect Caroline and she likes her job here too much. He tells Maya that he needs to get his dad to sign those papers as soon as possible to secure his position as CEO.",
        "Ivy tries to draw Wyatt into a conversation while working but he's off in a distance. She says she is sorry he is hurting with Hope gone. He says and she is not coming home any time soon. He gets that she is heartbroken but they both lost that child. They should be healing together and supporting each other. He does not know now where he stands with his wife. She tells him Hope loves him and this is just her way of dealing with things and it is only temporary. He just has to have a little faith and she will return. He asks her what her plans are for the holiday and she replies to spend it with Liam. He is surprised and she asks why. Wyatt says he thought Liam might be in Italy and perhaps they had talked about it. Ivy says no. Wyatt suggests that it might be a good idea to find out.",
        "Maya wants to pin Rick down about spending more time with her after his Christmas dinner at Eric's. Then she gets off on the subject of spending the night and gets him to answer that he is not with Caroline in that way. She kisses him and he gently pushes her away and warns her that he is supposed to be mad at her and fired her so they can't be seen doing this. John leads Pam out to the Sky Lounge and prepares her for her surprise. Jarrett pulls back the blue curtain and out comes Bernie, a cute little dog. John says is just one of many in the poochie parade and she gets to choose which one she likes best, his gift to her. John gives the commentary as they parade around. Pam says they are all beautiful and she could never pick just one and it is just a little too soon, maybe next year. She tells John she can never thank him enough, this was so special. He says he knows a way. He pulls out some mistletoe out of his pocket and puckers up. She gives him a kiss. Down at the shelter Rick shows Maya around. He says this is the mission of miracles and tomorrow she will be part of it all."

        "Maya: Looks like someone's got the Christmas spirit.",
        "Pam: Yeah. This has been in the Forrester family for years.",
        "Rick: Let me guess. The necklace -- it actually lights up?",
        "Pam: Ta-da!",
        "Rick: Wow. Now, that -- that is something.",
        "Ivy: Oh, battery-powered jewelry. You know, I think we might just have to add this into the, uh, the spring collection.",
        "Pam: I think I probably should turn it off so the batteries don't run out.",
        "Ivy: [Laughs]",
        "Maya: So, what is everyone doing for Christmas?",
        "Rick: My dad's having an open house.",
        "Maya: Am I invited?",
        "Pam: Um, don't you think that might be a little awkward?",
        "Ivy: You know what? I think Pam has a point. Could be a little weird, considering.",
        "Maya: Oh, but I make a mean batch of mashed potatoes.",
        "Pam: Oh, well, thanks, but Charlie and I have got the cooking covered.",
        "Rick: The only thing my dad asks is that everybody pays their price of admission.",
        "Ivy: Admission?",
        "Rick: Yeah. See, we're going down to the mission. We feed the homeless every year.",
        "Pam: It's an amazing experience.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Pam: A Forrester family tradition.",
        "Maya: I'd be honored to be a part.",
        "Rick: Good. Then we'll have a big group.",
        "Ivy: What about you, Pam? You gonna make some lemon bars?",
        "Pam: Does Santa have elves?",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: See you.",
        "Ivy: Well, my first Christmas in America.",
        "Maya: Yeah, I loved your act, pretending to be all innocent and full of Christmas cheer.",
        "Rick: Maya? What are you doing?",
        "Maya: She didn't tell you?",
        "Rick: Tell me what?",
        "Maya: Oh, well, Ivy stopped by my apartment last night. Not to say hello or give me a housewarming gift. She stopped by to confront me about our kiss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Jarrett, my boy, when you've seen the sunset over Tibet, it gives you a different perspective. There is no beginning or end. The circle of life and all that.",
        "Jarrett: Well, I'm happy to help out. I've managed to bring in a few of the finest pooches from Beverly Hills.",
        "John: Poor Pam's been mourning the loss of her dog for years. I think it's time for a replacement. How long does it take a person to move on from the loss of a pet?",
        "Jarrett: Well, I think everybody's different.",
        "John: Yes, I know.",
        "Jarrett: Pam is a dear friend.",
        "John: Tiny, Tiny, Tiny, her dear, old Doberman. I think it's time to put a tiny, little smile on her lovely face with a little doggy as a Christmas gift. Look at that. My tail's wagging just thinking about it. This is gonna be great. She's gonna love this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Pam: Knock, knock.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, Pam.",
        "Pam: I thought you might want to see my sweater. And my light. Been getting a lot of compliments on it.",
        "Wyatt: I can see why.",
        "Pam: How you doing, Wyatt?",
        "Wyatt: Just trying to get some work done. Not making too much progress.",
        "Pam: Have you heard from Hope?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I talked to her last night for about five seconds.",
        "Pam: And? She coming home for Christmas?",
        "Wyatt: Nope. She's gonna stay in Italy.",
        "Pam: You know, maybe she doesn't want to leave her mom alone at Christmas.",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. I don't know about a lot of things right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: What were you thinking? Why would you go over to Maya's?",
        "Maya: So she could judge me.",
        "Ivy: I'm concerned, Rick. That's all. I'm concerned for you and Caroline.",
        "Rick: We've already talked about this. I told you to drop it.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, and you told me you ended things with Maya, which obviously you haven't, because all I have to do is walk down a hallway and see you two kissing!",
        "Maya: Oh, my God, Ivy! It was one itty-bitty, little kiss!",
        "Rick: We've already talked about this. You're not gonna say anything to anybody.",
        "Ivy: Okay, then let's talk about Caroline, because she thinks you've recommitted to her.",
        "Rick: And that's how it's going to stay.",
        "Ivy: Why are you doing this?",
        "Rick: You like your job, right? You want to stay on here? Then pretend you know nothing about us. Is that understood?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: I know that the order forms were out here before. I-I think I left them with the other ones, but... hmm. That's -- that's my dog, Tiny.",
        "Wyatt: Handsome, little guy.",
        "Pam: He was my best friend. Before he passed away.",
        "Wyatt: You miss him, huh?",
        "Pam: Everyone around here knows how much he meant to me. [Sighs] Oh, look. Right under my nose. They would have bit me. Wyatt? Eric's having an open house, and you really should come. You should not be alone at Christmas.",
        "Wyatt: I think I'm just gonna -- I'm gonna lay low. But, uh, thank you for the invite, and thank you for these.",
        "Pam: [Sighs]",
        "John: Pammy D.!",
        "Pam: [Laughing] John!",
        "John: The one and only! Here to celebrate the holidays with my brother and daughter.",
        "Pam: Oh.",
        "John: Pammy, Pammy. Look at you!",
        "Pam: Now, you stop.",
        "John: [Laughs] How does a man get a hug around here?",
        "Pam: You just ask for one!",
        "John: Oh!",
        "Pam: It is so good to see you again.",
        "John: Believe me, the pleasure is mine. Chuck is not around, is he?",
        "Pam: No. It's Charlie's day off.",
        "John: Oh, then my Christmas wish has been granted. Now about your wish. I have a little surprise.",
        "Pam: Really?",
        "John: Out at the sky lounge. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Pam: I can't just leave the phones.",
        "John: Have someone cover. Come on. The trotting dog gets the bone.",
        "Pam: [Laughing] Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Rick, I'm sorry if you think I'm overstepping the line here, but you are obviously going through something. I'm just trying to help you.",
        "Rick: I don't need your help.",
        "Maya: Yeah, we were doing just fine. So please go on about your business.",
        "Ivy: You obviously still love Caroline. That is why you're hurting. That's why you keep lashing out.",
        "Rick: I don't really understand why you keep talking to me like I'm a child. I'm your boss.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Rick: Don't forget that.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Maya: And let's just be clear. Rick and I have history. We were a serious couple before Caroline's claws came out, so don't get it twisted. I'm not just some sidepiece.",
        "Ivy: Maya, all I know is that Rick is still married to Caroline. Are you seriously willing to risk everything? Your C.E.O. position, your marriage to Caroline, for -- for Maya?",
        "Rick: I'm not losing anything, because you're not gonna say anything to anybody -- not to me, not to anyone else. Are we clear?",
        "Ivy: God, I hope you know what you're doing.",
        "Rick: I'll see you at the mission.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rick: I don't like that she knows.",
        "Maya: I wouldn't worry about her.",
        "Rick: What if she says something?",
        "Maya: She won't. She doesn't want to hurt Caroline, and she likes her job too much.",
        "Rick: I can't take that chance. I need to get my dad's signature on those papers as soon as possible. I need to secure my CEO position.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ivy: Wow, these are really great. And supply's willing to come down? You okay?",
        "Wyatt: Uh... I'm sorry. I'm just -- I'm not concentrating very well, am I?",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Well, after everything you've been through, I'm surprised you're here trying to work at all.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] What else am I gonna do? Hope's gone, and she's not coming home any time soon.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, I'm so sorry.",
        "Wyatt: And a part of me gets it. I-I know she's hurting and she's heartbroken, but I just... I don't understand why she keeps pushing me away. Me, of all people. Her husband.",
        "Ivy: Look, I feel sorry for Hope.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: I really do. I-I can't even imagine what she's going through, but... Wyatt, you lost a baby, too.",
        "Wyatt: I know, and we should be healing together and supporting each other, but... I just -- I-I don't know where things stand with my wife.",
        "Ivy: Hey.",
        "Wyatt: Hope's deciding to spend the holidays in Milan, and it's making me question our relationship. And I don't want to do that. That's the last thing that I should be doing, especially since it's the most wonderful time of the year.",
        "Ivy: Wyatt, Hope loves you.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Ivy: She does. This is just her way of dealing with things, and it's only temporary. She will eventually come home to you. Just...you just have to have a little Faith.",
        "Wyatt: Well, until then, I'm flying solo. What about you? You have any plans for the holidays?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I'm -- I'm spending Christmas with Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Ivy: Yes. Why do you sound so surprised?",
        "Wyatt: He's not gonna be in Italy?",
        "Ivy: Why would he be in Italy?",
        "Wyatt: 'Cause Hope's there.",
        "Ivy: And?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. I-I'm sorry. I just thought that they might have been talking. Have they?",
        "Ivy: I-I-I don't know. I don't know. I haven't asked, and he hasn't said anything, so...",
        "Wyatt: Well... [Sighs] Might be a good idea for you to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maya: And maybe after Christmas dinner, you can sneak away and we can have our own little celebration at my place?",
        "Rick: Still liking it over there?",
        "Maya: Oh, my luxury penthouse? Yeah. Loving it.",
        "Rick: Good.",
        "Maya: It would be better if you were there and I wasn't sleeping alone.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I know it's not ideal.",
        "Maya: But it's only for the time being, right?",
        "Rick: Till my dad signs those documents.",
        "Maya: And those nights when you're alone with Caroline at the guest house? You're still not...with her, right?",
        "Rick: No. No, nothing like that.",
        "Maya: Good answer.",
        "Rick: Maya. We have to be careful. I'm supposed to be mad at you. I tried firing you, remember?",
        "Maya: How could I forget? I gave the performance of a lifetime. Rick, I just... I just can't wait until you and I host the Forrester Christmas together.",
        "Rick: Next year.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: No peeking.",
        "Pam: Well, how much further? [Laughs]",
        "John: Open.",
        "Pam: Jarrett!",
        "John: [Laughs]",
        "Pam: What are you doing here? And who is this cutie?",
        "Jarrett: John set this up for you.",
        "John: Jarrett did all the leg work.",
        "Jarrett: It was my pleasure. We both know how much you miss Tiny, so meet Bernie.",
        "Pam: Well, hello, Bernie! How are you? John, what is going on?",
        "John: Your Christmas surprise! My gift to you.",
        "Pam: Bernie?",
        "John: Maybe. We're putting on a little doggy parade for you today, Pam. All you have to do is pick whichever one you feel is the best.",
        "Pam: [Chuckles]",
        "John: High atop the Forrester sky lounge, you are joining us for Pammy's pooch parade. We're pinned on the hopes that the lemon bar queen will find her next mate today. Or a dog, too. [Laughs]",
        "Jarrett: John, Pam, meet Brando.",
        "John: Well, hi, Brando. [Laughs] Look at that guy. Ooh, wait. He's got no tail. What's a dog without a tail? Uh, Jarrett, any way to grow Brando's tail? A special ointment or a machine or some-- I mean, look at him. [Laughing] He's like a martini without an olive! Like a taco without hot sauce. Like you without me, sugar, huh? Am I right, or am I right?",
        "Pam: Actually, uh, his tail was snipped on purpose.",
        "John: On purpose?! Ouch! I'm sorry I'm sitting when you told me that! You know, it reminds me of a friend I had once. He had a long beard, and he braided it down to about here, and all I could think of was grabbing a pair of scissors and cutting it off. He -- he thought it gave him a Fu Manchu look. Does that sound right? Fu Manchu or something. All right, now I have tawny bringing out Diablo.",
        "Pam: Oh, look at Diablo.",
        "John: Can see who the dog is here, and it's not Tawny. [Chuckles] I'll tell you, Tawny's bringing out the Diablo in me. Or is that you, Pammy? [Chuckles]",
        "Jarrett: He was actually found behind a bowling alley in Van Nuys.",
        "Pam: Ohh! That sweet fella.",
        "John: Oh, you know what would be fun? If we cleaned him up and took him back to the bowling alley and it turns out that he started the first doggy bowling league. Could you imagine that? Little doggy bowling shoes? Barky beer? Schnauzer pizza? All catered by Woof-Gang Puck. [Laughing] Woof-Gang Puck! Oh, and then he becomes a big star. Maybe he'll bowl a perfect game and he becomes a hero right out of the gutter and into the trophy rack. We could even start manufacturing little doggy bowling shirts. I will talk to Eric about that.",
        "Pam: I-I wouldn't do that.",
        "John: [Laughs] I'm just having some fun with you.",
        "Jarrett: Well, now it is time for our showstopper. Here is Pixie!",
        "Pam: [Gasps] Oh! Pixie!",
        "John: Look at the gait on that princess.",
        "Pam: Oh, she has the most beautiful coat.",
        "John: But take a look at that face, too. Can she breathe out of that schnoz? I mean, that -- that's what you call a \"butter face.\" Everything looks good but her face. Listen, I don't know if we can do this. It's just an idea off the top of my head. What if we took Princess Pixie together with Diablo and put them in a nice, little doghouse for two, lit some candles, played some soft music, and bing, bang, boom. We have the perfect hound, huh? What do you think? Anyway, my dear, who is gonna be eating lemon bars for dessert tonight?",
        "Pam: Oh, I... they are all so beautiful. I-I could never pick one, and... I-I think maybe it's just a little too soon, John. Maybe next year if -- if that's okay.",
        "Jarrett: You know, Pam, it's all right. I've already got some people in the building who have claimed dibs on some of them already.",
        "Pam: Oh, I'm so glad. I knew that someone would take them, and I-I just want to thank you so much. This has been so special for me. This has all been so sweet of you, John.",
        "John: Just trying to spread the love.",
        "Pam: Well, I don't know how to thank you.",
        "John: Well, so happens that I do.",
        "Pam: [Chuckles]",
        "John: [Sing-songy] 'Tis the season. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Chatter]",
        "Rick: This is it, Maya. The mission where miracles happen. Tomorrow, we'll be part of it all.",
        "Maya: Wow."
