        "Taylor: \r\nOh, you're here early. ",
        "Brooke: I thought I'd get \r\na jump on the sales figures. ",
        "Taylor: And? ",
        "Brooke: I don't know, I'm \r\nhaving a difficult time concentrating. I guess it's the holidays. ",
        "Taylor: Oh, yeah. They're \r\nalways a mixed bag, aren't they? I think I have more patients during the \r\nholidays than any other time of the year. ",
        "Brooke: Well, it was a \r\nvery interesting day yesterday, for all of us. When I think of all the heartache \r\nand the anger and blame that went on this year -- I really thought the family \r\nwas beyond repair. Then Felecia reached out and everybody came through for her \r\nand her child. ",
        "Taylor: Yeah I think we \r\ndeserve a lot of credit, all of us. But especially Bridget. I mean, the fact \r\nthat she accepted Nick had a child with another woman, I think that's amazing.\r\n",
        "Brooke: She looked happy \r\nyesterday. ",
        "Taylor: Yeah, I noticed. \r\nSo did you. ",
        "Brooke: Well, I am. I -- I \r\nfinally can be because she is. ",
        "Taylor: Really? I mean, um \r\n-- I don't know, does that mean that you think that nick never was your destiny. \r\nI'm sorry -- no, no, that's none of my business. ",
        "Brooke: No, no, that's all \r\nright. I've really got nothing to hide. What Nick and I shared, it was \r\npassionate, there's no question. But there was something more. There was peace, \r\ncomfort. Now words sound so inadequate. It was like nothing I'd ever known. And \r\nunfortunately, nothing I can ever have. ",
        "\r\n*****************************************************************",
        "Bridget: I just want to \r\nhold onto this for the rest of my life. I want Dominick to know everything he \r\ncan about Felecia. About the Christmas that she made for him. About how \r\nincredible she's been in the face of this illness. Thinking only of him. I just \r\n-- I really, really want him to know how special she is. ",
        "\r\n***************************************************************",
        "Stephanie: Felecia, \r\nsweetheart, I brought you some breakfast. I saw Renee going down -- down the \r\ndriveway with the baby for a walk. We'll fix something for her later. Honey, did \r\nyou hear me? ",
        "[ Felecia crying ] \n",
        "Stephanie: God, my god, \r\nwhat is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? ",
        "Felecia: I ruined it -- \r\nthe bed. There's so much blood. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, honey, \r\ndon't worry about it, it's all right. Are you all right? Are you okay? \n",
        "Felecia: I'll buy you new \r\none. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, sweetheart, \r\ndon't worry about it, it's a mattress. Are you all right? Are you okay? \n",
        "[ Felecia sobbing ]",
        "Stephanie:\u00a0 Honey, I'm \r\nhere. It's all right. Shh, shh, shh. ",
        "\r\n************************************************************",
        "Taylor: I'm a little \r\nembarrassed to admit, I was threatened by you. Even after it became obvious that \r\nwhatever you felt for Ridge had been replaced by something deeper for Nick and I \r\njust wasn't able to see it. ",
        "Brooke: I was so wrapped \r\nup in ridge that nobody really saw it. I mean, I didn't even realize that Nick \r\nwas the one man who could really make me happy. Sometimes I think what it \r\nwould've been like if I had seen it sooner. I guess timing is everything. \n",
        "Taylor: And by the time \r\nyou realized what it was you felt, Bridget was pregnant with nick's child. I'm \r\nsure that was a horrible choice that Nick had to make. ",
        "Brooke: I love him even \r\nmore because he chose Bridget. Because he's Nick, he's committed, honorable. I'm \r\nproud of the love that we shared. I mean, it was never really simple, but it was \r\nhonest, powerful. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************************************",
        "Bridget: I guess its just \r\nkind of hard to visualize. The two of you, you and Felecia. What was she like?\r\n",
        "Nick: What do you mean?\r\n",
        "Bridget: Come on, you know \r\nwhat I mean. ",
        "Nick: You know, being in \r\nbed like this with my wife that's talking about that -- it's a little weird.\r\n",
        "Bridget: Well, it \r\nshouldn't be. Because you are weird. ",
        "Nick: Well, I must be \r\nbecause I picked you, didn't I? ",
        "Bridget: If I'm recalling \r\ncorrectly, I picked you. ",
        "[ Nick mumbling ] \n",
        "[ Bridget giggling ]\r\n",
        "\r\n*******************************************************************",
        "Felecia: I was gonna to \r\nhelp you. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, that's not \r\nnecessary. Besides, it's already done. ",
        "Felecia: I know, you're \r\ngoing to say that I'm in no condition to be making beds, but -- ",
        "Stephanie: That's right, \r\nisn't it? ",
        "Felecia: I just don't want \r\nto see you making beds, Mother. Cleaning up after me, it's really humiliating.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Who changed \r\nyour diapers? Who washed your bottom? ",
        "Felecia: Just -- I thought \r\nI could hide away and handle this on my own. ",
        "Stephanie: Don't be silly, \r\nI want you here. I want to help you. You're my baby girl. You don't think I'd \r\never leave you to handle this on your own, or try and get through this on your \r\nown, do you? Come on. Honey, whatever it is that you need and however you want \r\nto handle this, I'm here for you. I just -- I just need to know with absolute \r\ncertainty -- I just need to know that there's nothing, somewhere, some doctor \r\ncould do for you, that's all. ",
        "Felecia: You think I've \r\njust given up. Mother, does that sound anything like me at all? The time for the \r\ndoctors to have done something was when I was pregnant with Dominick. Yes, if I \r\nhave had radiation then, it might've cured me, but it would've killed my son. I \r\nchose Dominick, no regrets. But it doesn't make this next part any easier. Oh, \r\ndarn it. I don't want to go out in a sea of tears, you got that? I want to die \r\nthe same way that I've lived. Looking for the good times, the party. ",
        "Stephanie: Okay, if that's \r\nwhat you want, that's what you can have. ",
        "Felecia: You're saying --\r\n",
        "Stephanie: If you want the \r\nbiggest, wildest, wackiest, loudest party, you can have it. ",
        "Felecia: You know what I'm \r\nasking, right? ",
        "Stephanie: I'll honor your \r\nwishes, honey? I mean, when you ask your father -- when you asked us for an old \r\nfashioned Christmas, what did we do? ",
        "[ Felecia laughing ]\r\n",
        "Felecia: Yeah. You gave me \r\nthe best Christmas that anybody could ever want, or have, with all the \r\ntrimmings. ",
        "Stephanie: And everybody \r\nwas there. ",
        "Felecia: Decorating the \r\ntree. ",
        "Stephanie: Your father \r\nplaying the piano. ",
        "Felecia: Nick singing.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: I thought the \r\neggnog was bad enough, but -- ",
        "[ Felecia laughs ] \n",
        "Felecia: My baby was \r\nchristened. Mother, did you see Bridget's face? It's like she loves that child \r\nalready, don't you think? ",
        "Stephanie: Yeah. \n",
        "Felecia: And Massimo. \r\nForget about it, he's besotted. My child is going to be so spoiled. Well, at \r\nleast he'll be taken care of, financially. ",
        "Stephanie: More important \r\nthan that honey, he'll be loved by everyone. ",
        "Felecia: You'll tell him \r\nabout me? All about me? ",
        "Stephanie: Well -- \n",
        "Felecia: No, come on. Not \r\nbad stuff, I don't want to be a bad influence, but -- Mother promise me that you \r\nwill help take care of him, because he's going to need you. I am sure from time \r\nto time my child is going to need an iron fist. ",
        "Stephanie: Do you think \r\nyou can't count on me for that? ",
        "Felecia: I'm sorry. \n",
        "Stephanie: For what?\r\n",
        "Felecia: Giving you such a \r\nhard time while I was growing up. ",
        "Stephanie: Baby. \n",
        "Felecia: No, I was \r\nrebellious. Because I felt suffocated. I didn't see what you were trying to give \r\nme, I couldn't see it. Because I wasn't a mother. ",
        "Stephanie: Now you know.\r\n",
        "\r\n******************************************************************************",
        "Bridget: Oh, god. I could \r\njust stay here all day. ",
        "Nick: I know I don't have \r\nto go into work. ",
        "Bridget: Yeah, well I \r\ndon't think Massimo could get along without you. ",
        "Nick: But he's training my \r\nnew replacement -- young Dominick. ",
        "Bridget: Yeah, well, if \r\nhe's going to be your new boss then I think we'd better get busy. ",
        "Nick: Yeah, what are we \r\ngoing to be busy doing? ",
        "Bridget: I think we should \r\nclean out the spare room. You know, and get it all ready for him. You know, just \r\nsome snips and snails and puppy dog tails. Plus, I really want Felecia to get to \r\nsee it. See how welcome he is into our home. ",
        "Nick: I fall in love with \r\nyou more and more everyday. ",
        "\r\n*********************************************************************",
        "Taylor: You've talked \r\nabout the commitment and being honorable and the strength, but sex, you haven't \r\neven mentioned that. And that's usually one of the most important aspects of a \r\nrelationship for you. Literally defining a quality of it. You haven't even said \r\nit once about nick. ",
        "Brooke: Because it didn't \r\nexist. ",
        "Taylor: You didn't give in \r\nto your desire, not even once? The night that you went out on the boat with him, \r\nwhen you reconnected? ",
        "Brooke: It wasn't \r\nnecessary. What Nick and I shared was so powerful. More than any physical union. \r\nAnd I'll never forget it. Never. (Sniffling) ",
        "\r\n***************************************************************************",
        "Felecia: You know, when \r\nyou realize you're dying you start seeing things with great clarity. It's like \r\nthere's this fog between you and the rest of the world and all of a sudden it's \r\ngone. ",
        "Stephanie: I always knew \r\nyou'd be the realist in the family. ",
        "Felecia: It's just \r\namazing. It's weird when you've got nothing to lose, it does something to you. \r\nYou see everything in a different way. There's something I need to tell you.\r\n",
        "Stephanie: Okay. \n",
        "Felecia: I don't want to \r\ntell you or anybody. I'm scared. You're the strongest person I know, and I need \r\nsome strength from you right now. ",
        "Stephanie: Okay. \n",
        "[ Felecia sobbing ] \n",
        "Stephanie: Whatever you \r\nneed. Whatever you need, baby. Whatever you need, you have it. I promise. \n",
        "\r\n***************************************************************************",
        "Brooke: I can understand \r\nwhy you'd be surprised. It surprised me, too. I always thought that the physical \r\npart of a relationship is what I needed most. And now I see that a perfect \r\nrelationship, it's not all about that. Nick's strength and his love touched me \r\nin such a way that nothing physical ever could. It changed me. ",
        "Taylor: I had no idea.\r\n",
        "Brooke: I just couldn't \r\nlet anybody see it. Bridget needed to know that she could trust me. She deserves \r\nthat. ",
        "Taylor: Brooke, these \r\nfeelings you have for Nick, they're so powerful. I don't know if you'll be able \r\nto just put them aside. ",
        "Brooke: It isn't easy. \r\nEveryday I have to put up and emotional dam and keep the feelings back. \n",
        "Taylor: Is Nick able to do \r\nthat, too? ",
        "Brooke: I don't know. I \r\ndon't know. But I am containing my feelings and that's what's really important \r\nhere. To see Bridget smile every day. And to know that instead of hurting her, I \r\nactually helped bring this joy into her life, and that means everything to me.\r\n",
        "Taylor: But you're telling \r\nme that you love Nick more than you've loved any other man. ",
        "Brooke: And that's why I \r\ncan do this, Taylor, because I love Nick. ",
        "\r\n***********************************************************",
        "Nick: So great. \n",
        "Bridget: Hey, baby, could \r\nyou just -- ",
        "Nick: What are you doing? \r\nGive me that! You're not supposed to lift anything heavy. ",
        "Bridget: I just wanted to \r\nshow you a couple of ideas -- ",
        "Nick: I don't care. You're \r\nnot supposed to lift anything -- ",
        "Bridget: Heavy? \n",
        "Nick: I'll decide what's \r\nheavy. Come here, sit here. Now let me explain something to you. You are the \r\nqueen, sit. This is your throne and I, the lowly worker bee, will get you \r\nanything that you want. ",
        "Bridget: Well, if you \r\ninsist. ",
        "Nick: I insist. \n",
        "Bridget: Hmm? All right, \r\nwell, I just wanted to go over a few ideas about Dominick's room. ",
        "Nick: Okay. ",
        "Bridget: Okay, well, \r\nthere's the racecar theme. ",
        "Nick: Racecars are nice.\r\n",
        "Bridget: And there's the \r\never popular ballet theme that I love. I, of course, found a nautical theme. \r\nShip's captain. ",
        "Nick: I like that one.\r\n",
        "Bridget: I thought you \r\nwould. ",
        "Nick: I have some ideas, a \r\ncouple boxes -- ",
        "Bridget: Well, honey, \r\nwait. I think we have a few nautical things. ",
        "Nick: I'll be right back.\r\n",
        "[ Bridget screams ] \n",
        "Bridget: Ow! ",
        "Nick: Bridget! My god what \r\nhappened? Bridget! ",
        "Bridget: Something's \r\nwrong. ",
        "Nick: What happened?\r\n",
        "Bridget: The baby, it \r\nhurts. I think something's wrong. ",
        "Nick: I'm going to call \r\n911. ",
        "Bridget: No, please don't \r\nleave me. ",
        "Nick: Okay, okay, okay. I \r\nwon't. I'm right here. "
