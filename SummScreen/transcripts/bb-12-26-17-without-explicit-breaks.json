        "Steffy looks around to make sure Liam is not around so he can hear. She calls her doctor who says they should know today who the baby's father is. She hugs Liam again when he says she is carrying his child. Katie and Wyatt continue to play games. He arrives as the tool guy plumber and she is the damsel in distress wrapped only in her sexy, skimpy lingerie. He wants to know who else can service her needs. He has been the pizza guy to almost anything else she needs. Brooke tells Thorne to stop teasing her. He says he does only because he likes to see that smile. Justin asks Bill how was his Christmas. Bill says fine especially when the boys came by. Liam talks to the baby via Steffy's tummy and says he is going to work and glad to be doing that. She has a flashback of when Bill told her he would get his revenge on Liam. She goes to Bill's and says sorry they have to meet here but they needed privacy. The baby has to be Liam's but there is the possibility it could be Bill's. She wants him to be honest with her. She asks if her marriage concerns him. He says of course. She wants to know if he slept with her to get revenge on Liam. Brooke tells Thorne they have a problem. She is engaged to Ridge but Thorne does not want her to be. He says he will always be around to help her. Wyatt shows up at the office and grouses to Liam that he left some very important things for this meeting and now Bill is not here and no one knows why. Liam says his dad is going to flip when he finds out he is going to be a granddad.",
        "Bill answers Steffy that no, of course not, he would never hurt Liam like that. All of that was before they made peace. Liam disrespected his marriage and his wife when he put Sally above that so they were there for each other out of love. He truly was loving her and it was never about revenge. She says okay she believes him. They both put themselves in this situation. She remarks that she is going to the doctor. He offers to go with her. She says she will go alone. This is her journey and she will make sure this baby is Liam's. Katie is shocked, so is Throne when she runs to the door and thinks it is Wyatt coming back. She is still in her definitely not visiting attire. She makes an apology and invites him in anyway. Wyatt tells Liam that he sure is lucky to have Steffy and that she gets along so well with Bill and both of them are on Liam's side. In the doctor's office Steffy panics and wants to know if the doctor has the results ..she has to know now and this baby must be Liam's."
