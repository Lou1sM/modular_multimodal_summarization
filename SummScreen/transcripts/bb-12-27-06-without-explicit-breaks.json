        "[\r\nJackie sighs] ",
        "Jackie: Is this what \r\nthis has come to? Taylor thinks that I've warped you for life by not letting you \r\ngo out and pick up a bunch of dirty, tossed out old bottles? ",
        "Nick: No. ",
        "Jackie: Because I don't \r\nhappen to think you turned out too badly. ",
        "Nick: Nor do I. \n",
        "Jackie: Then what is \r\nthis about? ",
        "Nick: Why was it wrong?\r\n",
        "Jackie: I loved you \r\nNicky, just as I love you now. You were my little man. You wanted to help. But \r\nquite frankly, what difference would $2.00 or $3.00 a week have made? And it \r\nwasn't your responsibility to support us. It was mine. ",
        "Nick: Did you sell those \r\npearls I gave you? The ones from Captain Kramer? ",
        "Jackie: Yes. Yes, I did, \r\nI took them to the pawnbrokers. I wore them and then once you stopped asking to \r\nsee them on me -- why is that so terrible? ",
        "Nick: I guess I just \r\nwish I could have given you more to pawn. ",
        "Jackie: Well, we've had \r\nour little revelation. I think we should just get back to work. ",
        "Nick: I'm not going back \r\nto the office. ",
        "Jackie: Okay. I'll try \r\nand make it work on my own. ",
        "Nick: Tell me about \r\nCaptain Kramer. ",
        "Jackie: Well, he was \r\nyour friend, not mine. ",
        "Nick: Tell me. \n",
        "Jackie: It's really hard \r\nto remember. ",
        "Nick: But you do \r\nremember him. ",
        "Jackie: I remember he \r\nwas good to you. ",
        "Nick: Was he good to \r\nyou? ",
        "Jackie: Yeah. Yes, he \r\nwas kind. He definitely tried to help us. ",
        "Nick: And so did his \r\nfriend, Captain May. ",
        "Jackie: I appreciated \r\nanyone that showed an interest in you because you were, you know, starved. You \r\ndidn't have a grown man to look up to. You were starved for that. ",
        "Nick: I was and I wasn't \r\nbecause I liked these men. And then I couldn't stand the sight of them. \n",
        "Jackie: Well, I can \r\ncertainly understand that. You must have been so bored with their dull, \"Oh, \r\nlook how tall you've got, Nicky,\" conversations. ",
        "Nick: Conversation isn't \r\nwhy they were there. Was it, mother? ",
        "Jackie: This is really \r\nunfair. It's really unfair what you're doing to me. ",
        "Nick: You were the world \r\nto me. You were my world. And then all of the sudden I didn't care about bottles \r\nand paper routes and I left and you never asked why. ",
        "Jackie: Because I didn't \r\nwant to stand in your way. ",
        "Nick: You know what I'm \r\nasking! ",
        "Jackie: Well, I don't \r\nhear a question. ",
        "Nick: Why did I leave?\r\n",
        "Jackie: You were ready. \r\nYou were ambitious. ",
        "Nick: You couldn't deal \r\nwith it when I was a boy, Mother. You couldn't tell me then. Don't make me \r\naccuse you now. I want you to say it. I want you to say what you have to say. \r\nBecause it's got to be better than the word I'm holding back. ",
        "\r\n*******************************************",
        "Taylor: Not a case of \r\ntraumatic memory suppression, since as a boy he had a grasp of what he was \r\nwitnessing. And then a few years later, it drove him away from home to sea where \r\nhe worked his way up the ranks of a merchant fleet. It appears that over time, \r\nMr. Marone allowed this Captain Jerry Kramer and these other sea captains to \r\nbecome maybe a selective amnesia, innocent memories. And he constructed a \r\nchildhood fantasy that he was this little boy who had been befriended by these \r\nmen that he looked up to. Transforming his childhood in this way helped him \r\nreconcile the love and respect he had for his mother and the fact that he \r\nrecognized that she was accepting money from these men for sex. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh my god! \r\nJacqueline Payne was a whore?"
