There was nothing to that Thomas thing and she is totally committed to him. She is upset but thanks him for spending Christmas with her while Deacon is in Paris with Hope. Steffy leaves as Ivy walks in to see Liam. Katie grouses that Christmas is over and it's time to get back to work, chop, chop, even with Alison as his assistant. She proposes she'd like to help get Brooke a job there at Spencer. Eric stops by to see Brooke and she thanks him again for inviting her for Christmas Eve and she does not want him to be worrying about her. He says he is only a phone call away when she needs him. She says she has a wonderful family but this house is big and odd and she feels like she has lost her purpose. Katie calls and wants to see Brooke at her office if possible. Liam tells Ivy do not screw this up. He is with Steffy and she has moved on with Wyatt, that is the way it should be. Steffy asks Wyatt why did he request that she come. He pulls out a huge diamond engagement ring and she guesses that he is proposing to Ivy. She wants to be sure that he is ready. Wyatt says they had overcome many obstacles and they are closer and more committed they have ever been. He needs her. Steffy says she is honored that he is confiding in her and she loves the ring. There is no way she will turn this down.", "Liam tells Ivy that he is engaged to Steffy, and Ivy will be better off with Wyatt. Quinn is just behind the open door listening in. Ivy says Wyatt is an incredible boyfriend but it was Liam until Steffy came back and stole him away. Liam is the one she wants, he always will be. But she will stay with Wyatt if Liam does not want her. Wyatt calls and needs Ivy home; says even bring Liam too, it's all good. When they get there, both Liam and Ivy wonder just what is going on. Meanwhile Quinn is in a tizzy for Wyatt to pick up the phone so she can stop this. Bill tells Brooke that they have an idea they want to run past her. Katie picks up and says she wants to be a bigger part of Brooke's life. She wants her around more, someone she can count on. Brooke tells them she is fine even though she does not go into FC that much. Bill pumps her up that she is a bigger success to that company than anyone and she has a lot to contribute but they need her too. Katie laments that she'd like Brooke to come work with them at SP. Steffy whispers to Liam that Wyatt is going to propose so do not blow it now. Wyatt says he knows they wonder why they are all here. He says there is no one he trusts more than Ivy and is as devoted to their future as he is. He says a lot of pretty words and gets down on his knees and pulls out the ring and asks will she marry him. Before she gives an answer she looks at Liam and then Quinn comes crashing through the door and demands Wyatt stop. All look at her as she demands that Ivy tell Wyatt just who she really loves."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Wyatt: Hi.", "Quinn: [Gasps] Oh, you're wearing the shirt I got you.", "Wyatt: [Laughs] Yes, I am.", "Quinn: Hey, by the way, thank you so much for coming over. I mean, with deacon in Europe visiting hope, I would have been all alone. This way, I got to spend Christmas with my handsome son.", "Wyatt: I know. It was nice, wasn't it?", "Quinn: It was nice. It was like old times -- just the two of us.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Quinn: Yeah.", "Wyatt: Uh, listen, uh...I wanted to let you know something before word gets out. [Chuckles] I'm...proposing to Ivy today.", "Quinn: What? Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. W-why didn't you tell me?", "Wyatt: I'm telling you now. And I don't want to hear anything negative, okay?", "Quinn: Well, what about that whole kissing Thomas thing?", "Wyatt: Okay, I-I-I am not worried about another guy. Ivy and I have talked about it at length. She's completely committed to me, okay? I just -- can you just be happy for me? That's what I want. Can you just be happy for me, please?", "Quinn: Yes, yes, yes, okay, of course I am happy for you.", "Wyatt: Good. Okay, well, here you go. Go to work. Think about it. We'll talk about it later.", "Quinn: Oh.", "Wyatt: Yay!", "Quinn: Oh, but --", "Wyatt: Perfect.", "Quinn: Hey, well, what about a ring, at least? I mean --", "Wyatt: All covered. All covered. I'll let you know what she says.", "Quinn: All right, well... good luck.", "Wyatt: Thank you. Hmm?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Mmm. I'm kind of bummed Christmas is over.", "[Cell phone chimes]", "Liam: Yeah, it was fun. Especially having Christmas eve at your grandfather's.", "Steffy: Yeah, I'm surprised your dad cracked a smile.", "Liam: Uh, that's probably because your dad wasn't there.", "Steffy: Yeah, that's true, and, you know, Wyatt managed to have a good time without Ivy, considering how inseparable they are. Speaking of, Wyatt wants me to meet him at his house.", "Liam: Huh. He say why?", "Steffy: No. No, but I'll find out. I'll see you in a bit.", "Liam: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Oh!", "Steffy: Hi, Ivy.", "Ivy: Hi.", "Steffy: He's all yours.", "Ivy: [Sighs] Well, I wish.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: So, your groupie rescheduled the meeting for Friday.", "Bill: [Laughs] So, today she's my groupie. Uh, just to remind you, her name is Alison, and she's my executive assistant.", "Katie: Well, she's an executive something.", "Bill: Boy, you are such a hater.", "Katie: [Laughs]", "Bill: I mean, what happened to that Christmas spirit? It's just out the window like that.", "Katie: That's right. The holidays are over! Time to get back to work. Chop, chop.", "Bill: Well, that's what I'm doing. You know, I have to say that it wasn't all that painful being at Eric's, and I'm really glad that he got Brooke to come over.", "Katie: Yeah, me too. I just hated the idea of her being alone in that big house. She just doesn't seem right. She seems...sad, distant.", "Bill: She hasn't been herself.", "Katie: No, but I think there might be something we can do about that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: It's nice of you to stop by, Eric.", "Eric: Well, I'm not really stopping by. I want to talk you into pancakes now, you know, take you out.", "Brooke: [Laughs] After that Christmas feast, I'm gonna be dieting for a month.", "Eric: I'm glad you decided to come.", "Brooke: Yeah, me too.", "Eric: You don't have to be alone, ever, Brooke. I live right up the street. I'm a phone call away. I'm always here.", "Brooke: I know. Thank you. This house does feel empty at times, but I'm okay. I don't want you worrying about me. Really, I'm just -- I'm fine.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Hadn't thought of that.", "Katie: Well, I think we can make it work, don't you?", "Bill: If Brooke's up for it, I don't see why not.", "Katie: Well, I hope she is, because she needs something like this -- a new experience, something to look forward to every day.", "Bill: I'm all for it. I think it's a great idea.", "Katie: I hope she does, too. Because I really want to help my sister.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Got another e-mail from Rick this morning.", "Eric: Good?", "Brooke: Sounds like he and Maya are having a good time with the Avants in Hawaii.", "Eric: Good.", "Brooke: I'm happy they were able to take a family vacation.", "Eric: We have to adjust. We just do. Our kids grow up, they get their own families, they get their own lives.", "Brooke: I know. I just miss them. But I'm -- I'm proud of who they've become and thankful that they're happy and healthy.", "Eric: Yeah.", "Brooke: This house used to be so full of life, so full of love and laughter. Now it's just quiet. It's just me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: See, you -- you don't really mean that.", "Ivy: Liam, I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it.", "Liam: Okay, but what am I supposed to say to that? Because I am marrying Steffy, Ivy, and you've moved on with Wyatt. This -- this is how it's supposed to be. Wyatt -- Wyatt is devoted to you. Don't screw that up. I just -- I mean, you two could have such a great future together.", "Ivy: I know that, Liam. Doesn't change how I feel about you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Bet you're glad to have your girlfriend back.", "Wyatt: [Laughs] Ivy was only in Mexico for a couple of days.", "Steffy: Oh, okay, I'm sure you weren't counting the minutes till she got home.", "Wyatt: Okay, maybe I was, a little bit, thank you. And I had a great time at Eric's Christmas eve bash, by the way. Still recovering from that eggnog.", "Steffy: Oh, God, that eggnog was lethal. Put some hair on your chest.", "Wyatt: Yes, that's what I need -- hair on my chest.", "Steffy: Yes, yes, you do. So...why'd you want me here?", "Wyatt: I'll show you. [Clears throat]", "Steffy: Wait, are -- are you -- are you proposing to Ivy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: I just have to keep reminding myself to count my blessings, to appreciate what I have. I'm a very fortunate person. I have a wonderful family, and I have great friends.", "Eric: You're a terrific woman. You're a brave, capable lady. There's nothing you can't do. You're a survivor.", "Brooke: Except be alone. I haven't mastered that yet.", "Eric: Well, you don't want to get too good at that, all right? Believe me.", "Brooke: No, Eric, really. It's just -- it's a really strange feeling. It's odd, you know? I feel like I've lost my purpose.", "[Cell phone rings]", "[Cell phone beeps]", "Brooke: Katie. Hi.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Hi, uh, I don't know what you're up to, but I was wondering if you could come by the office for a minute.", "Brooke: Uh...no, I can't. Eric's here.", "Katie: No, I'm not taking no for an answer. Please, just for me, as a favor.", "Brooke: Okay. Sure. Why not?", "Katie: I'll see you soon.", "[Cell phone beeps]", "Katie: She's on her way.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Nice.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: You're really doing this? You're asking Ivy to marry you?", "Wyatt: Yeah. Why are you so surprised? Ivy and I have -- have overcome more obstacles than I can count.", "Steffy: Y-yeah, but -- but are you -- are you ready?", "Wyatt: Why wouldn't I be?", "Steffy: The whole thing with my brother? The accident?", "Wyatt: Okay.", "Steffy: Is it the best timing?", "Wyatt: We already talked about the whole Thomas thing, and she assured me.", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "Wyatt: Look, Ivy and I are -- are closer and more committed than we have ever been, and almost losing her, I-I realized how much I -- I need her.", "Steffy: That's really sweet.", "Wyatt: I-I got a feeling your fianc\u00e9 thinks I'm jumping the gun a bit.", "Steffy: Liam knows you're proposing?", "Wyatt: Yeah, he and my mom. He doesn't know I'm doing it today, but --", "Steffy: Oh. Well, I'm honored you're confiding in me.", "Wyatt: [Laughs] It's -- I -- I was just asking your opinion on the ring. That's all. Do you think it's big enough? Do you think she'll like it?", "Steffy: Let me see. Oh, it's -- it's gorgeous. It really is.", "Wyatt: So you --", "Steffy: She's gonna die.", "Wyatt: [Laughs] You think she'll say yes?", "Steffy: Yeah. She's gonna be so excited. There's no way she's gonna turn you down. No way.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You're better off with Wyatt.", "Ivy: Why?", "Liam: Because I'm engaged to Steffy. And he loves you.", "Ivy: You loved me, too, Liam. Those feelings don't just disappear.", "Liam: I know, but we tried, Ivy. We tried to make it work, and it didn't.", "Ivy: Yeah, because Steffy came back and interfered. A part of me gave up on you, Liam, when Steffy came back from Paris. She had all this confidence and sex appeal. Look, I-I know my worth now. I know what I can give. And if that involves a life with Wyatt, then that's fine, that's wonderful, but I can't move forward with him until I tell you how much I care for you. From the moment you saved my life in Paris to all the time we spent together in Amsterdam, I knew then that you were the one.", "Liam: [Laughs] Hey, I-I won't deny we had an incredible connection.", "Ivy: Yeah, until Steffy came back. She stole you from me, Liam. That may not be how you see it, but that's exactly what happened. Don't get me wrong. Wyatt -- he's an incredible boyfriend. But he isn't you.", "Ivy: You're the love of my life, Liam.", "Liam: Okay. You have to be very careful about what you say --", "Ivy: No, I -- why? I-I don't care what I say. Look, I will stay with Wyatt. I'll be with him...if you don't want me. I'm sure we'll have a very good life together. But you're the one I want, Liam. You always will be.", "[Cell phone rings]", "Ivy: [Sighs] It's Wyatt.", "Liam: Answer it.", "[Cell phone beeps]", "Ivy: Hey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Hey, uh, I need you to come home right away.", "Ivy: Uh, well, um, I'm just in a -- I'm in a meeting with Liam.", "Wyatt: Perfect, uh, you can bring him, too. It's good, Ivy. It's something that'll be good for all of us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: So, how do you think Brooke will react?", "Katie: I don't know. I hope she's excited about it.", "[Door opens]", "Brooke: Oh, hi. Alison wasn't there, so I just --", "Bill: Yeah, Katie scared her away.", "Katie: Uh, thanks for coming by on such short notice.", "Brooke: Oh, thank you for remembering me on Christmas eve. It was really very nice of both of you. I appreciate it.", "Katie: Yeah, I'm glad that Eric was able to convince to join us. I don't like the idea of you being alone. Which is why, um, we have a proposition for you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Come on. [Sighs] [Groans]", "[Cell phone beeps]", "Eric: Quinn, hi. How was your holiday?", "Quinn: It was good. It was good.", "Eric: Good. We enjoyed having Wyatt at the house Christmas eve.", "Quinn: Uh, yeah, he said he had a lovely time.", "Eric: Good. Glad to hear it. Everything okay? You seem a little, uh -- is something wrong?", "Quinn: Your niece. She's what's wrong.", "Eric: Ivy? What's this about?", "Quinn: She's just -- she's -- she's not the -- she's not the woman for Wyatt, that's all. I just -- I have to -- I have to tell him.", "Eric: Well -- is there something I can do? I mean, I thought they were terrific together.", "Quinn: [Groans] Wyatt, pick up, pick up, pick up!", "Eric: Why don't you let me do something? Can I help?", "Quinn: Uh, no, no. I-I got to handle this on my own. I-I'm sorry. Wyatt, pick up the phone!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Cell phone rings]", "Wyatt: That's call number 3.", "Steffy: What, is that your mom? You're not gonna pick up?", "Wyatt: I know why she's calling.", "Steffy: What, to tell you to take your vitamins?", "[Both laugh wryly]", "Wyatt: No. She thinks that marrying Ivy is a mistake.", "Steffy: Wow. She never really liked her, has she?", "Wyatt: No. There's a part of her that still thinks that you and I belong together.", "Steffy: [Laughs] Okay.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Steffy: Well, clearly that's not happening.", "Wyatt: Right?", "[Both laugh]", "Steffy: No, Liam and I will be married soon, and if luck is on your side, so will you and Ivy.", "Wyatt: Oh, good! You're here. [Laughs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: Hi.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Thank you for coming.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: So what's up? What's going on?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: A -- a proposition?", "Bill: Katie has an idea she wants to run by you, and we are hoping you'll be interested.", "Brooke: Yeah. I'm all ears.", "Katie: Well, the holidays are a time of reflection, and -- I've been doing a lot of that lately. I've been thinking about us and everything we've been through as sisters and as friends. You have been there for me in my life. You have made me feel protected and loved, and I'm grateful for that.", "Brooke: Oh, Katie.", "Katie: I want to do the same for you. I want to be a bigger part of your life, and I don't just mean a text or a dinner every now and then. I -- I want you around. I want you know that you can come to me and that you can count on me. On both of us.", "Brooke: [Chuckles] That's very nice that you're concerned, but I am fine. Really, I am.", "Katie: I know you are, but I think about you in that big house all by yourself, and I know you're not as social anymore, and you don't go into Forrester as much.", "Brooke: Well, Steffy and Liam and Thomas and Rick -- the next generation. They've taken over. They're doing a good job there.", "Bill: Oh, trust me on this. You are giving them way too much credit. They have a massive learning curve ahead of them, and there's no replacing you. Come on, you're Brooke Logan -- chemist, business tycoon, international mega-model.", "Brooke: [Laughs]", "Bill: You've contributed more to the success of that company than anyone.", "Brooke: I've had my day.", "Bill: And you still do, Brooke. You are in the game. You're not gonna give up. Katie and I won't let you.", "Katie: You are beautiful and, more importantly, you are brilliant. You have a lot to contribute. And we need you. We need your talent, we need your creativity, we need you, which is why we want you to come work with us here at Spencer publications.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: So, Wyatt, you gonna tell us what's going on or what?", "Steffy: Liam -- Liam, can I talk to you over here?", "Liam: Yeah.", "Ivy: What it -- what's going on?", "Wyatt: Uh, uh, I mean, you know, just...", "Steffy: Wyatt's gonna propose to Ivy, so don't kill the vibe or anything, okay?", "Liam: Like right now?", "Steffy: Right now. Wait. Try to contain your excitement.", "Liam: I don't think this is a good idea.", "Steffy: Why not? Wyatt cares about Ivy. And she feels the same way. Right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Uh, Steffy, Liam. Um, I'm sure you're wondering why we're all here. Um, I don't think we can argue that the four of us have gone through some crazy struggles over the past few months. But we're family. And we support each other, and we trust each other, and there is no one who I trust more than Ivy. Finally, I-I have someone who is faithful, that is devoted to this relationship and this future as I am. And I just -- [Laughs] I'm so grateful for you. Uh, I know this is a bit unconventional, doing this in front of you guys, but -- I don't know, somehow, like, I think, we're all just connected some way and intertwined, and I just think it's only fitting. So, Ivy -- [Laughs] I love you and our life together, how committed we both are to each other. I-I just -- I want to make that commitment last a lifetime. So, Ivy Forrester... will you marry me?", "Ivy: [Chuckles]", "Quinn: Stop!", "Wyatt: Mom?", "Quinn: You can't propose to her, Wyatt. She doesn't deserve you.", "Wyatt: What -- what the hell are you doing right now?", "Quinn: Tell him.", "Ivy: What?", "Quinn: Tell him who you really love!"], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8fsBPMrVL4"}
