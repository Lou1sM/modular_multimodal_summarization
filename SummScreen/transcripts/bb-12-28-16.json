{"Episode Summary": ["Episode # 7488 ~ Eric has a heart-to-heart with Steffy about what he expects from her as CEO of his company; Liam watches in wonder as Ridge works his magic on Quinn in an attempt to rid their lives of her."], "Recap": ["Ridge warns Liam that he is not to tell anyone, especially Steffy, that they are going to bring down Quinn. Quinn's foot is better and she tells Eric that she needs to go back to the office. She feels badly for Wyatt and knows it is hard for him to see his wife go home to another man. She says again how kind it was of Ridge to help her with her foot and so quickly that now it is better. When Quinn leaves Eric calls Steffy to come over. She leaves Nicole and Wyatt alone working on some of the PR. Even when Wyatt tells her it is not appropriate to talk about him and Steffy at the office Nicole keeps going back to it. Eric is direct with Steffy. He asks what would she think if she knew someone well that was shacking up when they were a married person. She stammers to find words but he finishes the sentence by saying she would think it was shameful. He says he did not bring it up before only because the whole family was estranged against him. She wonders if this is coming from him or from Quinn. He says he is saying this to her now from him. He would like to see her have a second chance but it is not right to be living with Liam. It is unfair now of Liam to be coming around and throwing these choices around. It is not too late. He wants her to move out of Liam's tonight. It is never too late to realign your choices with what is proper and right. Quinn walks in as Liam and Ridge are putting their heads together in how to oust Quinn. She says knock knock and asks if they are going to invite her in? And she is sorry she did not announce herself but she was too busy eavesdropping. Ridge is surprised she is back and she says his dad is the best doctor there is and she is all better. But maybe she should put a sock over her Ace bandage. Ridge quips that he can help her with that. He is pretty good helping a woman all the way down to her feet. He tries to start and she says no he's done enough and she did not mean to run Liam off. Liam says he is sure Ridge will fill him in later.", "Nicole has one more thing to say to Wyatt. When he thinks it is all over, perhaps it is just another chapter in his life. Eric says he believes in marriage and he even believes in divorce as he had had enough of his own, but he does not think it is right for Steffy to be married in limbo and go home to another man. Do not make a show of being with another man while she is married to another .move out tonight. He tells her he realizes she is not drawing a paycheck and that is not right. He is offering her $1M a year and that is as it should be. If she does not fully appreciate herself then no one else will. Quinn keeps on at Ridge and asks if he cannot see how she has some redeeming qualities and is very good for his father. The next thing you know she is talking about Ridge's hair and he knows she is just dying to run her fingers through it. She remarks that there is not enough hand sanitizers in the building for that. Wyatt walks in and finds Eric alone who asks about his work. Then he tells him that he told Steffy that her living with Liam has to stop. At home Steffy has the place all fixed up, special dinner, music, candlelight and wine. He knows it is not his birthday so what is the occasion. He asks if he did something good and she says yes. He is loyal and loving and he never gave up on her. She needed that more than he will ever know. She knows she will have to be a better person to keep him. He asks if there is a surprise. She takes a deep breath."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Ridge: Just so we understand each other, I don't want you telling anyone how we're bringing down Quinn. That includes Steffy.", "Liam: Uh...yeah. Okay. What am I not telling Steffy -- what, that Quinn is mildly but dangerously obsessed with you?", "Ridge: Yes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: It's really not that bad.", "Eric: Excuse me. I have extensive medical experience. It's called raising four kids. All right. Now...", "Quinn: Ah.", "Eric: ...Carefully put some weight on it -- not too much. Just see if you can walk on it.", "Quinn: Ohh. Well...", "Eric: [Sighs]", "Quinn: [Chuckles] ...It's ugly, but doesn't really hurt that bad anymore. You're really very good.", "Eric: Or maybe ridge got ice on it in time.", "Quinn: What do you think about that -- him being so chivalrous and helping me?", "Eric: Well, maybe we're slowly learning how to all get along together.", "Quinn: Or maybe he realizes how hard I'm working, trying to be copacetic with one and all. I should go back to the office.", "Eric: Oh, are you sure?", "Quinn: Yes. No, no, no. I'm -- I'm fine. I'm fine. I just don't want people there thinking I'm not pulling my weight because I'm Mrs. You-know-who.", "Eric: Mm. All right. But no heels.", "Quinn: No, no, no. Of course not. Of course not. Ohhh.", "Eric: What is it?", "Quinn: Oh, I just -- I'm just thinking about Wyatt, you know? I-I just don't know how to help him. [Sighs] It's so hard for him over there. I-I know that Steffy is -- is being perfectly cordial, and she's trying, too, but it's so hard for him to see his wife going home to another man every single night.", "Eric: Yeah.", "Quinn: Hey, what are you gonna do with the rest of your day?", "Eric: I don't know -- the usual superhero stuff. I'll save the planet, and then I'll, uh -- I'll fight injustice.", "Quinn: [Laughs] Oh, don't.", "Eric: Oh, no, no, no.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: Okay. How many formats do we have?", "Nicole: Five.", "Wyatt: And then how many are high-def?", "Nicole: Just two because of the download size, but the compressed format supports full hd.", "Wyatt: Isn't she awesome?", "Steffy: How do you know all this?", "Nicole: Computers and digital media are what I came to college in L.A. for.", "[Cell phone chimes]", "Wyatt: Yeah, and now your sexy C.E.O. video is on the verge of being a global success.", "Nicole: But our older clients or more conservative clients may want something a little more buttoned down.", "Wyatt: Yeah, which is why Nicole and I came up with some proposals, if you want to hear them.", "Steffy: Uh, you both are amazing, but I'm gonna have to hear that later. My grandfather wants to see me.", "Wyatt: Everything okay?", "Steffy: Yeah. I'm sure he just wants to talk.", "Nicole: Give him my best.", "Wyatt: Yeah. We'll just reschedule with pam. We'll pick up later.", "Steffy: Okay. All right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: I could not do what you're doing.", "Wyatt: What? What, V.R.? Come on. What are you talking about? You're a natural.", "Nicole: I mean working hour after hour, day after day, with the person who broke your heart.", "Wyatt: I'm your supervisor, and I'm not sure that it's appropriate to talk about this at work.", "Nicole: Okay. Got it.", "Wyatt: Yeah. It's okay.", "Nicole: I can just tell it's a labor of love for you.", "Wyatt: [Sighs]", "Nicole: It's got to be difficult knowing Steffy's going home to Liam every night.", "Wyatt: Nicole?", "Nicole: Okay.", "Wyatt: Seriously?", "Nicole: Got it. Also not appropriate.", "Wyatt: Yeah.", "Nicole: Sorry.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: Did you say something to him?", "Steffy: To dad about Quinn? No.", "Eric: Still, your willingness to work with Quinn could easily have a domino effect on the rest of the company. That's terrific.", "Steffy: She fell, and dad looked after her. It's common decency. Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?", "Eric: No, no. No, it's not, although it does fall into the heading of \"common decency.\" You are a married woman, right?", "Steffy: Technically. I'm in the process of divorcing.", "Eric: And if you were to hear of a married woman who was shacking up with her husband's brother, what would you think?", "Steffy: Granddad.", "Eric: Hypothetically.", "Steffy: I would think it's none of my business.", "Eric: No, you wouldn't. You would think it was shameful. And you'd be right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You're not wrong. It's that come-hither look she gave you. It sends chills down my spine. I don't have to tell you why that is, but... how do you get Quinn to give you more than a smile and a wink? She's crazy. She's not stupid.", "Ridge: No, she's not. But she also can't help but betray anyone who's ever put faith in her. That includes my dad. I'm just speeding up the process.", "Quinn: Knock, knock. Aren't you gonna say, \"who's there?\"", "Quinn: Why are you staring? Oh! My ankle. You know, your father is one of the great artists in the history of fashion and, little did I know, in ankle wraps. [Chuckles] What?", "Ridge: You really should learn how to knock.", "Quinn: Oh, I'm sorry. I was too busy eavesdropping. Oh, Pam and Charlie had the most epic fight. She's like, \"I am woman! Hear me roar!\" Why? Did I interrupt a meeting of my own personal anti-fan club?", "Ridge: No. No. We -- we -- we were doing an internet search on wholesale poison suppliers, and did you know -- what is it, half a million hits?", "Liam: Yeah. Yeah.", "Ridge: Results? What are they called?", "Liam: I don't know. But why are we buying in bulk? We only need a little bit.", "Quinn: You know, I once had a boyfriend -- well, he wasn't really a boyfriend, but he put arsenic in my gumbo. I think it was arsenic. Best night's sleep I ever had.", "Liam: Scratch \"arsenic.\"", "Ridge: Okay.", "Quinn: You think I should put a sock over this?", "Ridge: You know, I could help you with that. I know how to treat a woman, all the way down to her feet.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: How about a day in the life -- follow Steffy around the building with some cameras? Most people don't know what C.E.O.S do.", "Wyatt: Yeah, well, most C.E.O.s don't even know what C.E.O.s do.", "Nicole: You don't like it.", "Wyatt: No, no. I do.", "Nicole: You're still mad at me.", "Wyatt: No. No. It's just you got me thinking. How do you really know when it's over with someone that you just really thought you'd go the distance with? You say you're over Zende, but how do you really know?", "Nicole: You know that it's over... when it hurts too much for it not to be.", "Wyatt: So, basically, the more hurt you can take, the longer it'll last?", "Nicole: Something like that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Why is this coming up now?", "Eric: Well, it's coming up now because I didn't want to bring it up when I was so estranged from all of you from so long. I didn't want to subject myself to a lot of abuse from people who thought I had lost my mind.", "Steffy: I never thought that.", "Eric: Yes, you did.", "Steffy: No, I did not. I think you're strong and generous. And I judge every man I meet by the standard of you. I was just scared that Quinn was using you for her own purpose.", "Eric: And have those fears resolved now?", "Steffy: This new concern about my private life -- is that coming from you, or is it coming from Quinn?", "Eric: It came up. Has she asked me to talk to you about it? No, she hasn't. Look, I'm saying this to you now from me. Your private life is not private anymore.", "Steffy: But you know Quinn wants me back with Wyatt. That's not a secret.", "Eric: The fact of the matter is I'd like to see you give your marriage a second chance, too.", "Steffy: What about what I want? What about what makes me happy?", "Eric: What about the promises you made?", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "Eric: And as far as Liam goes, you know, I'm no big fan of his anymore -- not since he showed up right before Christmas, borderline abusive.", "Steffy: To you?", "Eric: I realize that he and my wife have a... conflicted past, and he could have pressed charges, but he didn't. I think it's unfair of him to show up now and start throwing around accusations. Look, wait until your divorce is final.", "Steffy: [Sighs] Maybe I should have done it before, but... it's too late now.", "Eric: No, it's not. It's never too late to align your values with your behavior. Move out of Liam's house. Move out tonight.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: I don't know if this is helping. It didn't hurt before, but it does now.", "Ridge: Why don't you put your foot up here and have an expert have a look at it?", "Quinn: You can do that? I'm so glad you have something to fall back on if this whole fashion-designer thing doesn't work out for you.", "Ridge: Thank you. I've never taken a class, per se, but I almost watched a video, so...", "Liam: Yeah. Uh, I'm -- I'm gonna -- I'm gonna go back to work.", "Quinn: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. You're in a hurry.", "Liam: No, no, no. No. I'm sure ridge will fill me in later.", "Quinn: Ooh. Oh, you're serious?", "Ridge: Yeah.", "Quinn: Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. I think you've done more than enough.", "Ridge: Really?", "Quinn: Mm-hmm.", "Ridge: And here I thought we were just getting started.", "Quinn: [Sighs]", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nicole: After working more closely with her, I like Steffy. I didn't know if I would.", "Wyatt: Why?", "Nicole: She's fierce.", "Wyatt: That she is.", "Nicole: And smart, funny, honest.", "Wyatt: Yep.", "Nicole: And you know what else I see?", "Wyatt: What?", "Nicole: She relies on you -- a lot. No one else's opinion matters more than yours.", "Wyatt: What are you saying, exactly?", "Nicole: Well, whatever feels like it's over between you two... maybe it's just a chapter, not the whole story.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: I promise you I'll think about what you're saying.", "Eric: Not the response I was hoping for.", "Steffy: Granddad, I was crashing at Thomas' loft. Please don't ask that of me again. I'm finally at home. I'm finally sleeping in my own bed.", "Eric: Your proper bed is with the man you pledged to love and honor, for better or for worse.", "Steffy: Is that really fair, really?", "Eric: I believe in marriage. I believe in divorce. I've had occasion to, anyway. I'm not criticizing you on that count. But do you think it's really... fair, in your heart of hearts, to humiliate the person you loved enough to marry by going home to another man's bed every night for the whole world to see?", "Steffy: And yet a man can do it? Dad did. Unless I'm mistaken, so did you.", "Eric: Then be better than we were. You may think that a marriage in limbo is just a technicality, but I can assure you it's more than that to Wyatt. Don't make a show of being with another man until your divorce is final. Move out tonight.", "Steffy: I should go.", "Eric: Oh, Steffy, one more thing. I spoke to payroll this morning. You're not drawing a paycheck.", "Steffy: Well, yeah. I thought I'd just leave it to you.", "Eric: That's a mistake for you now, too. Always strive for clear expectations on all sides. If you don't value yourself, nobody else will. I'm starting you at $1 million a year, with bonuses for performance.", "Steffy: I-I... I don't know what to say.", "Eric: I can't put a price on how much it means to me to have somebody in that job that I can trust to follow my guidance. I look down the vista of the years, and I think of the things I've done, the people I've known, the children I've raised and loved... and you know what I think? I think you're the best of all of us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ridge: All right. Come on. Don't bite me.", "Quinn: I told Eric how nice you were being to me, how civilized.", "Ridge: You know what that was? Low blood sugar. I get that sometimes.", "Quinn: He thinks maybe you're coming around. Are you...starting to see that maybe I'm not so hateful?", "Ridge: I think you're psychotic and criminal but not hateful.", "Quinn: Come on, ridge. I know you like to tease me, but just tell the truth. I mean... don't you see that I may have some qualities that might be endearing to your father?", "Ridge: I think any man can see those qualities. What they can't see are all the reasons why I hate you so much.", "Quinn: Do you ever think about...", "Ridge: Think about what?", "Quinn: ...Combing your hair?", "Ridge: Ah. You want to run your fingers through it, don't you?", "Quinn: Mm, I don't think there's enough hand sanitizer in the building.", "Ridge: We got plenty of hand sanitizer, and that's not what that is. I can wash the cooties out later.", "Quinn: [Chuckles]", "Ridge: You know what this reminds me of?", "Quinn: What?", "Ridge: That sexual-harassment video we all have to watch when we first get here. Try to remember something -- you're my boss now. Take it easy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Eric: You're not gonna say hello?", "Wyatt: Oh. Sorry. I-I thought you had company.", "Eric: She left quite a while ago. Steffy, you mean, right?", "Wyatt: Yeah. We were meeting when she got your text. I just --", "Eric: Come in. Come in. How's the new job going?", "Wyatt: Uh, it's great. Nicole and I are really shaking things up, which are good.", "Eric: It's not awkward with Steffy at all? I mean, so much of what you're doing is promoting this new C.E.O.", "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Steffy and I have worked really well together, but I'd be lying if I didn't say there are moments.", "Eric: She's remarkable, isn't she?", "Wyatt: Yeah, that she is.", "Eric: But nobody gets everything right.", "Wyatt: What is she getting wrong? I mean, if this is my mother talking --", "Eric: There are certain standards. She's living with your brother while she's still married to you. I told her that has to stop.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "Liam: Uh... I know it's not my birthday.", "Steffy: Well, I have a present for you anyway.", "Liam: Wow. What, uh... smells so good?", "Steffy: I brought us home dinner.", "Liam: Are we celebrating one of our far too many anniversaries? What I-- what is this?", "Steffy: Uh... let me think about that. Sit.", "Liam: Okay. Okay. What -- what is the occasion?", "Steffy: You.", "Liam: Me?", "Steffy: Yeah.", "Liam: Did I do something good?", "Steffy: Everything. Not only are you strong and sexy -- well, even more so with your clothes off...", "Liam: [Chuckles]", "Steffy: ...You're loyal and you're loving and you never gave up. You kept believing. And I needed it then. But I need it now, more than you know.", "Liam: You know I'm still the same guy I was all those years ago.", "Steffy: Well, my charms didn't work on you then.", "Liam: Yeah. I was kind of... committed.", "Steffy: Yeah. I didn't really understand about commitment then. I knew that I loved you. I just knew I had to be a better person... to keep you.", "Liam: You -- you're -- you're in a mood. [Chuckles]", "Steffy: Well, it's true.", "Liam: Are there... hidden cameras or something -- a group of people waiting outside on the patio to jump in and say, \"surprise!\" Or what?", "Steffy: Not exactly.", "Liam: But there is a surprise."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3kia28qOtk"}
