    "Recap": [
        "Liam wonders what all of this is for. Does Steffy have something to tell him? Wyatt thanks Eric for looking out for him and telling Steffy that she has to respect her marriage to Wyatt but he thinks it is a little too little too late. Eric says maybe not. He thinks before it is all over she may change her mind and be as devoted to him as his mother is to Eric. He thinks if Steffy were to move in here it might be a good opportunity for them to get his marriage back on track. Liam tells Steffy whatever it is, just say it. Bill pulls another surprise by showing up again in Brooke's kitchen. He says it is not the most romantic spot but he will take what he can get. She drinks his champagne and offers that she hopes next year will be better for him. He says he knows it will be this time next year. If Ridge is waiting for Quinn to be out of their lives that is never going to happen so it means a marriage to Ridge is never going to happen for her. Ridge continues to look after Quinn's foot and she says she has tried ice now she needs heat, like as in the steam room. Perhaps a few minutes in there will help. Ridge agrees, he thinks that might work. Liam and Steffy roll around on the couch while they kiss and undress each other. Bill says that black cat has got her fangs so far into Eric that she is not going anywhere. He does not intend to sit around and wait for that Bozo Ridge. Quinn slips into the steam room and lays down only in her towel. She is not there long until someone else comes in. She is dismayed to find Ridge standing there in his towel after she has told this person the room is occupied and to come back. In the afterglow Steffy tells Liam how happy he makes her. Finally she says she had an interesting conversation with her grandfather and he did make some valid points and she respects his opinion. He thinks what she is doing is wrong. She is technically married to Wyatt yet living with Liam. Eric says he means what he says, Steffy is lucky to be married to Wyatt and if he gets his way it will stay that way.",
        "Bill reminds Brooke that Ridge has disappointed her time and time again and it is just a matter of time before he does it again. Ivy checks in with Pam and says she is going down to the basement to check out a few things. Pam quips and be sure to check out the steam room while she is there. Quinn tells Ridge to close the door; he is letting out steam. He comes in and sits down and starts massaging her foot. She says it is magical. Slowly his hand slides further and further up her leg until she jumps up and says she has to go. She does not know what he is up to, but he can forget about it. Liam tells Steffy that her grandfather has no right to dictate their life as he has always been there for her. This is the way it should be. She says yes eventually, but she is still married to Wyatt. Bill states to Brooke that he will be here as always when Ridge lets her down and then she can become his wife. Quinn and Ridge put on their robes and are in conversation when Ivy sees them. They are both telling each other that they despise each other. She says she does not want him to pretend to care about her. She is married to his father so he cannot play with her emotions and she does not want him to ever touch her again. Eric tells Wyatt that his mother has given him unconditional love so if Steffy can give half that much they will be fine. Quinn goes back to her office with all these thoughts of Ridge in her head and how she could never turn her back on Eric. Meanwhile Ridge tells himself that he thinks Quinn is falling for him."

        "Liam: So [Chuckles] There is a reason for all this, right?",
        "Steffy: Does there have to be? Maybe I just want a romantic evening with you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, or maybe you have something to tell me? What is it, Steffy?",
        "Wyatt: You told Steffy that she shouldn't be living with Liam?",
        "Eric: Not while she's still married to you.",
        "Wyatt: Wow. Uh... thank you for looking out for me. You know she's divorcing me, right?",
        "Eric: I told her that she has to respect marriage and she has to honor the end of what you had... though I think if things go according to plan, the end may not come at all.",
        "Wyatt: Eric, what are you thinking?",
        "Eric: I'm thinking that we may be able to change Steffy's mind -- that before your divorce goes through, she'll be as devoted to you as your mother is to me.",
        "Ridge: You should rest that ankle.",
        "Quinn: [Groans softly] No rest for the wicked, right?",
        "Ridge: Ah, she finally admits it.",
        "Quinn: That I'm in pain? Yes, mm-hmm, and that I should probably stay off my ankle. [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: The offer still stands.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: There's magic in these. A couple of minutes -- I could make you feel better.",
        "[Thud]",
        "Bill: Barkeep, two glasses, please.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God! What are you doing? You're back again?",
        "Bill: I'm surprising you with a little end-of-the-year toast. Well, I guess maybe three glasses, if we have to include that dressmaking fianc\u00e9 of yours. Does he even drink sparkling cider? I mean, you know, I like it.",
        "Brooke: Ridge is still at work.",
        "Bill: Oh, damn. Guess we're gonna have to survive without him -- somehow.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but unless Steffy does a complete 180 --",
        "Eric: I think she will, living here.",
        "Wyatt: Living here?",
        "Eric: Look, I didn't come right out and say it, but I think it's a great idea. It'll solve everything.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: I mean, think about it. Your mother and me, you and Steffy, all of us together -- it can be the first step to getting your marriage back on track.",
        "Liam: Steffy, if you have something to tell me... just say it.",
        "Steffy: I'd rather show it.",
        "Bill: Not quite how I envisioned ending the year with you. I was planning a surprise trip to Paris -- maybe a few days on the Stella Maris with my beautiful new bride. Instead, here we are in your kitchen. Not the most romantic spot, but I'll take what I can get. To a better year ahead.",
        "Brooke: I'll drink to that. And I really do hope this next year is going to be a better year for you.",
        "Bill: Oh, it will be. I'm not even worried about it. In fact, I guarantee that by this time next year, I'll spend the day the way we should have been spending today -- on my yacht with the woman I love. And just so there's no confusion, that would be you.",
        "Brooke: Bill...",
        "Bill: Yeah, I know -- you're engaged to ridge, but that's not going to last. That moron is postponing marrying you until Quinn is out of your lives? That's never going to happen... which means that a marriage to ridge is never going to happen.",
        "Quinn: Magical hands, huh?",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm, so the story goes.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, I appreciate the offer, but if you touch my feet the wrong way, it might actually make things worse, so I think I'm gonna err on the side of caution.",
        "Ridge: At least let me get you some ice.",
        "Quinn: Actually, I'm thinking I need the opposite -- applying some heat.",
        "Ridge: What are you saying?",
        "Quinn: Steam. 15 minutes in the steam room might just do the trick.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ridge: It just might.",
        "Wyatt: You're willing to take sides like this, to support me over Liam?",
        "Eric: You're her husband.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but come on, Eric. We're talking about Liam here, the golden boy, everybody's favorite, or at least... dad's favorite.",
        "Eric: Well, your father's an idiot. I mean, if he favors Liam over you, that's just proof of it. Look, Liam waffles. He -- he -- he mistreats women. He -- he leads them on. Not at all like you. You -- you commit, and you mean it. You're the kind of man I can believe in, the kind of man I believe Steffy deserves.",
        "Steffy: You know how much you mean to me?",
        "Liam: I do.",
        "Brooke: You would be worried, too, if you were in ridge's position.",
        "Bill: Nothing would keep me from marrying you.",
        "Brooke: Except maybe ridge coming to the wedding.",
        "Bill: That is completely different, and you know it. I wasn't gonna have our wedding day marred by that bozo. I never said I wasn't going to marry you.",
        "Brooke: Neither has ridge.",
        "Bill: That's exactly what he's saying! That black cat has her claws so keep in Eric, she's not going anywhere, and ridge knows it. So, why would he have you wait for a day that's never going to happen? Does he even have a plan? I mean, how the hell is he gonna get rid of Quinn?",
        "Brooke: I have no idea. But, knowing ridge, he'll try anything.",
        "Quinn: [Groans softly] [Grunts] [Sighs] Ohh. Okay. [Sighs]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Quinn: Oh, somebody's in here. Can you just come back when I'm done?",
        "Ridge: I think there's room enough for two.",
        "Quinn: Ridge? [Grunts]",
        "Liam: Why so quiet? Are you lost in thought?",
        "Steffy: I suppose.",
        "Liam: About what?",
        "Steffy: How happy you make me... and how we can finally survive anything thrown at us.",
        "Liam: Always.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Has something... been thrown?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] I just... I had an interesting conversation with my grandfather.",
        "Liam: Oh.",
        "Steffy: He made some valid points, and it just kind of got me to step out and really look at things. I trust him, I respect his opinion, and, yeah... I was a little uneasy at how quickly things are -- are just... whether or not it was respectful, how callous it was.",
        "Liam: Eric called you \"calloused\"?",
        "Steffy: No. No, no, no. No. He just thinks... what I'm doing is wrong... how I'm... I'm technically married to Wyatt and... I'm living with you. He wants me to move out.",
        "Wyatt: You really mean that?",
        "Eric: Yes. Of course I do. You're loyal. You're trustworthy. Any woman would be lucky to have you. I just hope my granddaughter realizes that.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I hope so, too.",
        "Eric: Well, if I have anything to say about it, you're gonna remain her husband.",
        "Brooke: I don't want you to get your hopes up.",
        "Bill: Oh, they're up, and they're staying up. My commitment to you has never wavered. Can't say the same about ridge, can you? He has disappointed you time and time again. Now, let's suppose he does get rid of Quinn. Doesn't change who he is. He's the same guy... a guy who hurt you. And it's just a matter of time before he does it again.",
        "Pam: Hey.",
        "Ivy: Hi!",
        "Pam: You heading to the sky lounge?",
        "Ivy: No. I'm just coming from there. It was crowded. I'm gonna go down to the basement and see what they have. Is that really all they used to have here?",
        "Pam: Well, yeah, till donna thought up the sky lounge. She actually has a good idea every now and again.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: Anyway, you don't have to fight anyone for the equipment down there, and they've got the steam room.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Does anyone actually use that anymore?",
        "Pam: Yeah. But you know what? You might want to knock first, because Charlie does hot yoga in there, and it's not something you want to walk into.",
        "Quinn: In or out? We're losing steam.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Well, so much for my solitude.",
        "Ridge: I can be quiet, if that's what you need.",
        "Quinn: What I need is for my ankle to feel better.",
        "Ridge: That's why I'm here.",
        "Quinn: Oh. No. No, no, no, no, no. You don't need to do that.",
        "Ridge: Shhh.",
        "Quinn: [Grunting softly]",
        "Ridge: Close your eyes a second.",
        "Quinn: [Groans] [Clears throat]",
        "Ridge: Just take a deep breath.",
        "Quinn: Hmm.",
        "Ridge: How does that feel?",
        "Quinn: Magical.",
        "Ridge: I told you.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: I don't lie.",
        "Quinn: Mm. Not about your hands, anyway. Okay. I -- yeah. That's enough. I-I'm good. Uh, yeah. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. [Grunts] Oww.",
        "Ridge: You okay?",
        "Quinn: Why are you doing this?",
        "Ridge: You're hurt, and I'm trying to help you.",
        "Quinn: You don't care if I'm hurt. You don't give a damn about me. Whatever you're up to, you can forget about it.",
        "Liam: Your grandfather has no right to be criticizing where you live. I'm the one you should have been with the entire time.",
        "Steffy: I know. I-I know. But I do understand where my grandfather's coming from.",
        "Liam: You mean -- you mean where Quinn's coming from? This comes from her. You know I was over there before, and I heard the same story. This is where you should be, Steffy -- with me.",
        "Steffy: Yes. [Voice breaking] Eventually.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: I mean, is it too soon? Like, I'm married to Wyatt, and I'm living with you. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: So, you're -- you're really considering this, then? Oh. So that's what this whole romantic evening was about. You just wanted to tell me you're leaving me.",
        "Brooke: I'm not naive. I know my history with ridge -- the many disappointments.",
        "Bill: But this time it will be different? I'll be here when he lets you down. We both know he will. I'll be here, and we'll start our life together. It's almost a new year... the year you become my wife.",
        "Ridge: I don't know why you think I'm up to something.",
        "Quinn: Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's because you hate me and you would do anything to get me far, far away from your family and your company.",
        "Ridge: That's a good point, but I'm also human.",
        "Quinn: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Ridge: You were hurt. I wanted to help you.",
        "Quinn: You didn't care that I was hurt. You just wanted to take advantage. I don't even know what kind of game you're playing here.",
        "Ridge: Games? You want to talk about games -- the girl that was standing there naked, taking a shower outside, teasing me? You could have grabbed a towel, and you didn't.",
        "Quinn: No. I was not teasing you. I was outdoor-showering on my property.",
        "Ridge: And there it is -- your property, huh? Because you run the house, you run the company, and now you want to run my daughter's life, as well.",
        "Quinn: I was not rubbing it in.",
        "Ridge: You are rubbing it in, and I know why -- because you despise me as much as I despise you.",
        "Quinn: So, that's what this is all about -- this whate-- I don't even know what to call it.",
        "Ridge: Honey, I don't know what to call it, either. Maybe we're just toying with each other. We hate each other. We like playing games. It's something we have in common.",
        "Quinn: Well, it's gonna stop. I don't want you to flirt with me anymore. I don't want you to touch me. I don't want you to pretend to care about me. I'm married to your father. [Sighs] You don't get to play with my emotions.",
        "Wyatt: You're being really good to me right now, but I don't know if I deserve it.",
        "Eric: Ah, of course you do.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: You're exactly what my granddaughter needs. You're part of something bigger, too. You're part of your mother... a woman who's given me unconditional love. If you give Steffy even half of what your mother has given to me, I know she's gonna be just fine.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Well, ridge... I think she's falling for you.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] [Breathing heavily] Bastard. [Grunts] Thinks he can charm me. Like I'd ever do anything to hurt Eric. [Sighs]",
        "Eric: I love you. You're my wife. I'm committed to you.",
        "Quinn: You're still thinking about last night, ridge. How do I rate now that you've seen me au naturel?",
        "Ridge: You're a very attractive woman with a really nice body.",
        "Quinn: You really do know how to flatter a woman's body. Can you just look at me?",
        "Ridge: You want to talk about games -- the girl who was standing there naked, taking a shower outside, teasing me?",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Ridge: There's something undeniably sexy about you.",
        "Quinn: I don't trust me.",
        "Eric: Try it out with my sexy wife. Ridge is gonna be so envious.",
        "Ridge: I've got you.",
        "Eric: Gonna savor every moment of every day you and I have...",
        "Ridge: There's something undeniably sexy about you.",
        "Eric: Your loyalty.",
        "Ridge: Sexy.",
        "Eric: I trust you. I have faith in you.",
        "Quinn: I am not gonna show you old shades of Quinn.",
        "Quinn: No!"
