Brooke is not going to take him up on this opportunity. He thinks she needs this. Katie tells Eric that she is deeply appreciative of what he did on Christmas Eve. She thinks she and Bill have the solution for Brooke. They'd like her to join them as a team at Spencer. Wyatt tells his mom there is nothing more to be said. Quinn tells Steffy that she is not sure Liam would have told the truth if she had not overhead it and told on him. Ivy tells Liam that she is sorry she drug him through this. She is going back to Australia for a while. It is too painful to stay here. She says she loves him too much. He says running off will not fix the problem. Quinn tells Steffy that she needs her help. Steffy immediately says she and Liam will be there for Wyatt. Quinn says Liam is part of the problem so that is not what she is thinking. Wyatt comes back from his walk and he wants Quinn to tell him exactly what she had overheard from Ivy and Liam. She explains and says she is sorry that he had to hear this although Wyatt says he needed to hear it. Ivy says she is not going to grovel for someone's attention or love but all she loves here is him and she can not see him every day. It would be too much for her. She came to say goodbye.", "Brooke tells Bill that she chose to stay home as it is a safe place. Too much of him is on her mind and she knows he remembers it too. She says it is hard to close the book on those memories; they are so precious. She has to keep them distant now and that is why she can not work with him. She would only be feeding her demons. She would love to work alongside her sister and with him. That would be her dream. But she can't with their history. She picks up the bottle of vodka and says she has addictions and she needs to remove them from her life. Believe me he does not want this. He says she needs more than this. He can help her. She will not regret coming to Spencer. Eric tells Katie that he would hate to lose Brooke at FC but she and Katie would make a potent team. She says people are mean-spirited and she is tired of them tearing Brooke down. She knows what happened between her and Bill but she has no more issues with that and she hopes Brooke does not either. Steffy tells Wyatt that she does not want to add to his pain but he deserves better than Ivy. She was using him as a backup plan. Ivy tells Liam that she has to leave and she wants to say goodbye and thank him now. He set the bar pretty high. She wants to wish him well and say he will always have her heart. Brooke tells Bill that she appreciates what he is trying to do but she does not need his help right now and she wants him to understand that. She says he is always her protector even when he should not be. But she will find her way. She leans in and kisses him. He looks astonished but does not pull away. Wyatt looks at the ring and takes a drink and violently throws the glass into the fireplace. Liam tells Ivy that she can not go back to Australia. FC needs her here. She tells him that he is her compass. He kept her on track. Steffy is listening at the door. Ivy says that deep down that he still loves her. Steffy is dismayed when he says of course he does. She does not hear Ivy say goodbye."], "Recap Author": "Wanda", "Show Title": "Bold and the Beautiful", "Transcript": ["Bill: Tell me I'm misinterpreting.", "Brooke: Maybe you're right. Just forget I said anything.", "Bill: Then why don't you take us up on our offer and come join Katie and me at Spencer?", "Brooke: No, bill.", "Bill: You'd rather sit around here with a bottle you know you damn well better not open? Brooke, come on. We are giving you an incredible opportunity, and I'm not gonna let you turn it down. You need this.", "Brooke: No. No, I don't. And neither do you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: Well, the holidays were lovely. Thank you for hosting that party. I think, um, everyone really enjoyed it, especially Brooke.", "Eric: I wasn't about to let Brooke spend the holiday alone.", "Katie: It's very generous of you, and I am deeply appreciative.", "Eric: Brooke is family to me, Katie. She always will be. I'm worried about her. You need to get her out of herself a little bit more. She seems lost these days.", "Katie: Yeah, I-I don't disagree, and I think bill and I have a solution for that. We've invited her to join the team here at Spencer.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Oh, honey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Wyatt: [Sighs] There's nothing to be said, mom. Nothing to be said.", "Steffy: Hey.", "Wyatt: Did you know?", "Steffy: That Ivy told Liam that she loved him? No. No.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Then you must be as shocked about this as we are. You know... thank God you were here, Steffy. I'm not sure Liam would have told the truth if you hadn't been.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Knock on door, door opens]", "Ivy: Hey. Can I come in? [Sighs]", "Liam: Hey. [Chuckles] Truth had to come out at some point, right?", "Ivy: Yeah. I just wish I could have admitted it myself.", "Liam: Well, why didn't you?", "Ivy: I don't know. I guess I was just hanging on to hope. Anyway, I'm really sorry I dragged you through all of that. It won't happen again. I'm leaving town, actually.", "Liam: You're leaving?", "Ivy: Yeah, I'm going back to Australia.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: How could she do this to him?", "Steffy: This wasn't the first time.", "Quinn: [Sighs] God, I hope he's okay.", "Steffy: He will be. He just -- he needs some fresh air. That's all.", "Quinn: My son can go to a very dark place. Steffy... I need your help.", "Steffy: No, Liam and I, we will be there for Wyatt.", "Quinn: No, no, no, no, no. Liam is part of the problem.", "Steffy: No. This is about Ivy, her obsession with my fianc\u00e9.", "Quinn: Yeah, what I'm trying to say is, I'm not sure that Wyatt is gonna want to turn to his brother.", "Steffy: He deserves better.", "Quinn: Yeah. He does. You know, I had this feeling from the very beginning. [Sighs] Ivy was nothing but poison.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ivy: I can't stay here. It's too painful.", "Liam: Let me -- let me -- let me talk to my brother. I'm sure there's something we can do to --", "Ivy: He doesn't want me, Liam. He doesn't. I mean, who can blame him after everything I just put him through?", "Liam: Still... [Scoffs] Running off to the other side of the world is not a solution.", "Ivy: I can't stay here. I-I love you too much.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: I appreciate the offer, bill, but it's really not a good idea.", "Bill: Well, Katie seems to think it is, and so do I.", "Brooke: Well, you're both wrong.", "Bill: We are giving you an incredible opportunity, and it seems to me you're turning it down for no good reason!", "Brooke: I'm doing this for the best reason! I love him. Joe's like family.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Quinn: Thanks.", "[Door opens]", "Wyatt: Thanks.", "Steffy: You're gonna be okay.", "Wyatt: Where did you hear them talking?", "Quinn: [Sighs] At Forrester.", "Wyatt: What were they saying?", "Quinn: Well, Ivy was telling Liam how much she loved him. She was trashing Steffy, of course, and you, in a backhanded way, saying that she would settle for you if Liam wouldn't have her. Honey, I regret that I'm the one who had to lay this on you. I am so sorry about that.", "Wyatt: No, don't worry about it. I needed to hear it, so...", "Quinn: Well, Liam is the one who should have told you in the first place.", "Steffy: He did, Quinn.", "Quinn: That's only because I forced his hand.", "Steffy: [Sighs]", "Quinn: He should have told you a long time ago. Question is, why didn't he?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: You have a family here and friends and a job you love.", "Ivy: The only thing I truly love here, Liam, I-I can't have it. [Sighs] Look, I'm not gonna grovel for somebody's attention or affection. I mean, it's not who I am. It's actually really embarrassing and humiliating.", "Liam: I don't see how running away is the answer.", "Ivy: Maybe it's not. But all I know is that I can't be here. I can't work here and see you every day. It's too much for me. Look, I -- actually, I just came here to say goodbye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Spencer is a trap.", "Bill: What do you mean, a trap?", "Brooke: That is the reason why I'm alone. I chose to be. It's a safe place.", "Bill: Safe? Really? Doesn't seem to be working out so well.", "Brooke: I'm not drinking.", "Bill: But you're tempted.", "Brooke: Only when I'm haunted.", "Bill: Haunted? By what?", "Brooke: By memories. They keep going 'round and 'round in my mind. About aspen, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Monte Carlo. I know you remember it, too. It's hard to close the book on those memories. I've tried. They're just so precious. And yet so distant and... I have to keep them that way. That's why it's not a good idea for us to work together. Seeing you every single day -- that won't work, bill. Not for you, not for me, and not for Katie.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eric: I would hate to lose Brooke at Forrester, but the two of you -- the two of you would be a potent combination, working together here at Spencer.", "Katie: I agree. I mean, we've had our struggles. I-I won't deny that. But we've worked through them, and I'd like to think that it's made us closer.", "Eric: You've had a big impact on her.", "Katie: I hope so. I'm not sure everybody would agree with you.", "Eric: [Chuckling] Who?", "Katie: Oh, you know, you hear talk. \"She's not trustworthy. She leads with her heart to the detriment of everyone else.\" And she is passionate, and it gets her into trouble sometimes. But we're beyond that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: A-all right, look, you're just -- you're just feeling vulnerable right now because of the holidays and -- and because of -- of this -- you know, fighting your demons, cloistered in this house!", "Brooke: You know what you're doing right now? You're feeding my demons. Yes, of course I would love to work at Spencer publications! I would love to work alongside my sister! I have this great, new job opportunity! Work with you -- that would be my dream. But I can't, bill, because you and I have history. And it's still there. It is for me. Believe me, you don't want this.", "Bill: I can't let you do this.", "Brooke: Do what?", "Bill: Destroy your life over it.", "Brooke: [Voice breaking] I've destroyed my life because of this! This cloistered existence, as you say -- this is what I deserve! This is what I've earned!", "Bill: No! No, Brooke. There's another way. Let me help you.", "Brooke: No. In a way... you're both the same. You are both addictions that I need to remove myself from.", "Bill: And you will. Just like I have. This is not about you and me. This is about you. This is about you getting your life back. 'Cause right now, you don't have one. You need more than -- than this! So let me -- let Katie and me help you. Join us at Spencer, Brooke. You won't regret it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Steffy: Your mother's concerned about you.", "Wyatt: Why didn't Liam come to me?", "Steffy: He was hoping he could talk Ivy down.", "Wyatt: But still. The fact that she even said it, settling for me if she didn't get my brother? Like, isn't that something I should have been told?", "Steffy: No, no, no, don't -- don't blame Liam. This isn't his fault. He's been struggling with this.", "Wyatt: But I thought you said you didn't know.", "Steffy: No, I-I-I didn't know. He didn't tell me. [Sighs] But he hasn't been acting himself. I-I suspect he was -- he was dealing with Ivy.", "Wyatt: Why didn't she just say something to me? Just...", "Steffy: Because she's been playing you. You're her backup. And I know you're in pain. But I don't want to add to it by -- by coming down on Ivy. But you're too good for her. And you deserve better.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Liam: There are other ways to go about this, Ivy.", "Ivy: Liam, don't. [Scoffs] Look, you're with Steffy. I just have to accept that. But it means I can't stay here. Los Angeles isn't an option for me anymore because everywhere I go is just a reminder of you.", "Liam: Listen.", "Ivy: Don't. Please -- please don't.", "Liam: Okay. All right.", "Ivy: I'm not -- I'm not here because I want you to feel sorry for me anymore, okay? I'm done with that. I'm actually here because I wanted to say thank you. I want to thank you for showing me how sweet and gentle a relationship can be. I mean, you set the bar pretty high.", "Liam: [Scoffs]", "Ivy: It's pretty hard to believe right now that there is another you out there somewhere, but I'm sure that there is. Until I stumble upon him, Liam, I... I can't be here. I'm pretty sure I'm never gonna see you again, so I just... I just wanted to wish you... well. And I just want you to know that you'll always have my heart.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Katie: I'm just tired of people tearing Brooke down.", "Eric: Well, those are people who don't know her.", "Katie: Or care about her. They just know what they read online. It's all so mean-spirited. I mean, how many times have I heard, \"oh, just one kiss from Brooke Logan\"? Although she does have a certain power over men, doesn't she?", "Eric: I wouldn't know anything about that.", "Katie: Oh, no, no.", "Eric: No, no.", "Katie: [Chuckles]", "Eric: Brooke is so much more than all that.", "Katie: I just want to get her out of that house.", "Eric: She was never meant to be alone.", "Katie: I know. A lot of this is because of what happened between Brooke and bill. It had such a huge impact on all of us. And it forced her to close herself off. But I don't have any more issues with that. And I hope she doesn't, either.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Brooke: Sorry, bill. I can't accept your and Katie's offer. Please don't pressure me.", "Bill: I won't... if you can give me an alternative.", "Brooke: What alternative?", "Bill: Anything but this!", "Brooke: I appreciate what you're trying to do. And you've always been there to help me. But I don't need your help right now. Please tell me you understand that.", "Bill: I understand. But someone has to help you. And if not me, who?", "Brooke: [Sighs] Always my protector. Even when you shouldn't be. I will find my way. I will. Goodbye, bill.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Glass shatters]", "[Door opens, slams]", "Liam: Ivy, hey. Look at me. Can you look at me? I know this is a tough time for you. You can't go back to Australia. We need you here.", "Ivy: Mnh-mnh. Forrester doesn't need me. You definitely don't need me here.", "Liam: [Sighs]", "Ivy: Liam, if I didn't love you, I could stay. But I do. You're my compass. You kept me on track. When I lost you, I lost my bearings for everything. You are my everything. And I really thought you loved me. You do, don't you? I can see it, just the way you're looking at me. Why can't you just say that somewhere inside you, deep down, you still love me?", "Liam: Of course I love you.", "Ivy: [Sniffles] Goodbye, Liam."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgjxQNPQDeI"}
