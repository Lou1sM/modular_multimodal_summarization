        "Marah: It was in the sand. Nobody can do the Meringue... ",
        "Tony: Whoa, whoa, Meringue. ",
        "Marah: Whatever. At 3:00 am in the morning, in the sand, in heels? \r\n\t\tCome on, have you ever tried it? ",
        "Tony: What do you think? No. But you know what? I think you could get \r\n\t\tpretty good with some lessons and a good teacher. Yeah. ",
        "Marah: I don't think I've ever seen you this happy. ",
        "Tony: You have that effect on me, I can't explain it. ",
        "Marah: Good. But I think that it might have had something to do with \r\n\t\tEden, because after you saw her last night, something changed. ",
        "Tony: You're right. It did. ",
        "Marah: I wanted to ask you about it all night. ",
        "Tony: I know. I know, and it's not that I can't tell you or anything \r\n\t\tor it's not anything you should worry about it. It's just it involves \r\n\t\tRay, and I think I should talk to him about it first. ",
        "Marah: You know what? You don't need to explain it to me. ",
        "Tony: Have I told you how incredible you are? ",
        "Marah: Well, that you can explain, at length, any time. ",
        "Tony: Yeah? Danny, Ray, what's up? What's going on? ",
        "Ray: You two look great. You're a sight for sore eyes. ",
        "Tony: What's wrong? ",
        "Danny: Well, we left you a couple messages. ",
        "Tony: Well, I didn't check any of the messages. I was out all night.\r\n\t\t",
        "Danny: Have you checked the club machine? ",
        "Tony: No. ",
        "Danny: I'm going to go see if she called. ",
        "Ray: Yeah. ",
        "Tony: Will you tell me what is going on, Ray, please? ",
        "Ray: Carmen escaped from prison. She went after Michelle and Robbie.\r\n\t\t",
        "Marah: Oh, no. Are they okay? ",
        "Ray: They're okay. Thank God your cousin Bill was there. ",
        "Tony: Bill was at Michelle's? ",
        "Ray: Bill took the gun away from Carmen, but... ",
        "Marah: Oh, my God. ",
        "Ray: He's fine, they're fine. It's Carmen, she was hurt in the \r\n\t\tstruggle. It's bad, Tony. She's in a coma, and it looks like she's not \r\n\t\tcoming out of it. Danny and I have been at the hospital all night. ",
        "Tony: Danny was with you? Why? ",
        "Ray: No messages? ",
        "Danny: No. ",
        "Ray: Michelle asked Danny to leave the house. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, but I'm not staying away. Excuse me. I can't.",

        "Bill: Showed up for once, huh? ",
        "Beth: No, no. I read about what happened. ",
        "Bill: Look, I'm so sorry about you and Lizzie. I meant to get there, \r\n\t\tbut I... ",
        "Beth: When you showed up last night, I just... I had no idea. ",
        "Bill: I know, and I should've told you last night. I really should \r\n\t\thave, but I... I don't know. ",
        "Beth: Bill, sit down, you're... You were standing there with blood on \r\n\t\tyour shirt, you were probably in shock. Are you okay? ",
        "Bill: Yeah. ",
        "Beth: Well, it's a good thing that you were there for Robbie and \r\n\t\tMichelle, they could've been killed. You're a hero. ",
        "Bill: Stop, don't. Don't say that. I'm not a hero, not even close.\r\n\t\t",

        "Phillip: Hey. ",
        "Olivia: Hi. ",
        "Phillip: Fancy meeting you here. Just found out my breakfast meeting \r\n\t\tcanceled on me. Would you care to join me? My treat. ",
        "Olivia: Well, it's going to have to be, because if Alan has his way, \r\n\t\tI'm going to be broke pretty soon. My hotel's certainly going to be \r\n\t\tgone. ",
        "Phillip: I don't believe that. I don't. He's just hurt, and he's \r\n\t\tangry. That's why he's threatening right now, because you've wounded his \r\n\t\tpride. Trust me, I know my father. By the end of the week, he will be \r\n\t\tbegging you to come back to him. ",
        "Man: Olivia Spencer? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah? ",
        "Man: You've been served. ",

        "",
        "Alan: Did you have Olivia served this morning? ",
        "Lawyer: As we speak. All of her legal rights as your wife have been \r\n\t\trevoked. Penalties instituted, her half of the Beacon hotel reverts to \r\n\t\tyou. I'll begin drawing up the divorce papers... ",
        "Alan: No. ",
        "Lawyer: But I thought that you... ",
        "Alan: I won't be divorcing her. ",
        "Lawyer: Then why are you confiscating everything that she owns? ",
        "Alan: What about my son? Did you draw up his papers? ",
        "Lawyer: Divesting Phillip's going to be a little more complicated. He \r\n\t\thas his own stock in Spaulding Enterprises, his own investments, and his \r\n\t\town... ",
        "Alan: Yes, because I gave them to him on a silver platter, and I can \r\n\t\ttake them away. ",
        "Alexandra: Over my dead body. ",
        "Alan: Randall, call me from the office and get to work on what we've \r\n\t\tdiscussed. ",
        "Lawyer: I'll try, but I'm not going to promise anything. ",
        "Alan: Just do it. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, my, my, aren't we the bully this morning? ",
        "Alan: Stay out of this, Alexandra. You've done enough. You knew what \r\n\t\twas going on, and you stood by and allowed it... ",
        "Alexandra: Olivia and Phillip were merely saying good-bye before your \r\n\t\twedding. ",
        "Alan: Yeah, looked more like a hello to me. ",
        "Alexandra: So they were attracted to each other. They didn't act on \r\n\t\tit, Alan. ",
        "Alan: Is this supposed to make me feel good, this noble sacrifice of \r\n\t\tnot acting on it? I'm not a fool, Alexandra. They will pay. ",
        "Alexandra: With what? Scorched earth? You want to ruin Olivia, ruin \r\n\t\tPhillip, drive them both away? ",
        "Alan: She's not going away. Just call this a warning. Tough love, if \r\n\t\tyou will. When she sees how much she has to lose. ",
        "Alexandra: Lose? Alan, you're taking. You think she's really going to \r\n\t\trespond to this kind of... ",
        "Alan: Yes, I do. She may be passionate, but she's realistic. She'll \r\n\t\tcome back. It's like training a thoroughbred. You harness her, but you \r\n\t\tdon't break her spirit. ",
        "Alexandra: Alan, you are impossible! ",

        "Olivia: He's enforcing the entire pre-nup. Well, the Beacon's gone, \r\n\t\tand all the other penalties are enforced, including cash forfeitures.\r\n\t\t",
        "Phillip: Is he filing for divorce? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah. No, there's no mention of a divorce or a legal \r\n\t\tseparation. ",

        "Olivia: Yes, he is. ",
        "Phillip: He's a skunk. He's a rat-skunk. ",

        "Phillip: And you know what? You should divorce him. ",
        "Olivia: Look, Phillip... ",
        "Phillip: You should. You absolutely should, because you don't deserve \r\n\t\tthis. Damn him. You know, you stood by him through his heart attack. You \r\n\t\tstayed when Alexandra wiped him out, when he was at his lowest. You \r\n\t\tcould've walked, but you didn't. And you know what? Believe me, I know \r\n\t\thow difficult it's been for you to be a good wife to him. I know that \r\n\t\tthat was a choice that you had to make every single day, even when... If \r\n\t\the doesn't appreciate what he has, he doesn't deserve to have it. ",

        "Beth: Well, you can see, it's right there in black and white. You \r\n\t\tsaved Robbie and Michelle, you captured Carmen, and that guy who \r\n\t\tcould've killed... ",
        "Bill: You didn't even ask me. ",
        "Beth: Ask you what? ",
        "Bill: Beth, why I was there? Why I was at the Bauer house when I was \r\n\t\tsupposed to be with you and Lizzie? ",
        "Beth: Was Michelle afraid that something was going to happen? Did she \r\n\t\tcall you? ",
        "Bill: No, she didn't. She didn't call me. I went there on my own, \r\n\t\tBeth. Before I wished Happy New Year to anyone else, I had to say it to \r\n\t\ther first. ",

        "Marah: Yeah, for you, too. ",
        "Tony: It's not the same. It's not like she's my mother. You know, any \r\n\t\tgood Carmen had in her was gone by the time I met her. Whatever happens \r\n\t\tnow, Carmen died a long time ago. I just hope that she didn't kill the \r\n\t\trest of Danny's life, too. (phone rings) ",

        "Alexandra: Oh, Alan, have you forgotten all the years that Phillip \r\n\t\tnever wanted to be anything at all like you? No part of the business, \r\n\t\tnowhere near you. Honestly, it's a miracle he came back at all. ",
        "Alan: Maybe it would've been better if he didn't come back. He's done \r\n\t\tnothing but compete with me. Now he's trying the ultimate revenge of \r\n\t\tstealing my wife.

        "Olivia: (laughs) I'm not an admirable woman. Your father knows that. \r\n\t\tNo, he knows who he married, and those papers are the proof. It's an \r\n\t\topening bid, and I know it, just like he expected. You're right. Anybody \r\n\t\telse would divorce him, but... ",
        "Phillip: You won't. ",
        "Olivia: No. ",
        "Phillip: Why? Is it because of the money and the hotel? ",

        "Phillip: So don't play. ",
        "Olivia: Why? Because I would lose your high opinion of me? ",
        "Phillip: No, because you'll lose who you are. You lose the woman who \r\n\t\tdoes believe that she deserves and can have real love. Isn't that what \r\n\t\tyou really want? ",
        "Olivia: You know what, Phillip? I've had that, I thought more than \r\n\t\tonce, and it doesn't last. I mean, if you're going to build on that, \r\n\t\tyou're dead. Every single time I threw myself into the fire, I lost and \r\n\t\tI lost big, and I... My life just blew up in my face and I... I'm not \r\n\t\tgoing to do that to myself again, okay? I'm not going to do that to \r\n\t\tmyself again. That's why I married Alan. So yeah, I am, I'm keeping my \r\n\t\tlife, and I am going to work hard to put the love back into the \r\n\t\trelationship because Alan does love me. We both know that. ",

It all came out like an \r\n\t\told reflex. I mean, I was tired, you know? I looked at her and I \r\n\t\tthought, \"Why? What is the point? Is that going to make the situation \r\n\t\tbetter? Is that going to make me feel better?\" I was just so tired. And \r\n\t\tI looked at her, and I thought, \"you know what? What if I don't? What if \r\n\t\tI just forget it?\" ",

        "Danny: Okay. Okay. Michelle, I don't know what to tell you. I feel \r\n\t\tterrible about what happened last night. I mean, to think about what you \r\n\t\tand Robbie went through is a nightmare. I don't know what to tell you \r\n\t\texcept that it's over now. ",
        "Michelle: How many times have we said that before? I mean, it was \r\n\t\tover when Carmen went to jail, too. ",
        "Danny: She's in a coma, Michelle. The doctors say that it's \r\n\t\tirreversible. She's probably not going to survive. And even if she does \r\n\t\tsurvive, she's going to prison. ",
        "Michelle: You think that that fixes everything. ",
        "Danny: Of course it does. She was it, she was the problem. ",
        "Michelle: You can't say that, Danny. There could be somebody else. \r\n\t\tThere could be something else. Look, I know how hard you've tried. ",
        "Danny: There's not going to be anything else. I'm not going to make \r\n\t\tany promises. I know you don't want to hear any promises. But I'm here. \r\n\t\tI'm with you. And as long as I'm here with you, nothing, nobody is going \r\n\t\tto hurt you or our son. ",
        "Michelle: You can't promise that either, Danny. What, are you never \r\n\t\tgoing to go to the store? You're never going to go to work? ",
        "Danny: Come on, Michelle. ",
        "Michelle: You weren't here! ",

        "Danny: Is this about Bill? This is about Bill, isn't it? It is. What, \r\n\t\tis he inside? Is that why you're making me stand out here in the cold? \r\n\t\tBecause of Bill. ",
        "Michelle: No.",
        "Danny: Then why don't you just come out and tell me? Michelle, this \r\n\t\tisn't about me, this isn't about Carmen, is it? ",
        "Michelle: You don't really believe... ",
        "Danny: Bill's the one... Bill's the one who told you that it was too \r\n\t\tdangerous to hang around me, right? That you should take things slow \r\n\t\twith me? Of course. He's been coming to me, giving me ultimatums and \r\n\t\twarnings all the time. ",
        "Michelle: Look, you should thank God for Bill Lewis, because if it \r\n\t\tweren't for him, your son and I would be dead right now. ",
        "Danny: All right, look. Of course I'm grateful that Bill was here, \r\n\t\tbut he was here instead of me because you set it up that way. So I have \r\n\t\tto ask, Michelle, why? Why? I know why Bill was here, but why did you \r\n\t\twant him here? ",
        "Michelle: I didn't. I didn't. You're the one who's fixated on Bill. \r\n\t\tHe's my friend, that's it. ",
        "Danny: Okay. Okay. Then why are we doing this? Michelle. Come on. So \r\n\t\tmany people have taken so much from us these past couple years. Don't \r\n\t\tlet them take away anymore. Don't let what happened last night ruin \r\n\t\teverything. We have a chance right now to start over. Come on. We do. \r\n\t\tAnything we want. Anything, it's ours. ",

        "Phillip: No, I think it went more like, \"Bill's a kid, so he can't \r\n\t\tpossibly be smart or mature enough to appreciate how wonderful you are.\" \r\n\t\tI am sorry. He's an idiot. ",
        "Beth: Well, there seems to be a lot of that going around, doesn't \r\n\t\tthere? I spoke to Alan last night. He told me why he kicked Olivia out. \r\n\t\tAbout the wedding day. Is it true? You and Olivia? ",
