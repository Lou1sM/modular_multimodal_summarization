        "Cassie: Go home, Reva ",
        "Reva: No, Cassie, we've been dancing around \r\nwith this Tammy and Jonathan for a while trying to be nice. ",
        "Cassie: I'm not feeling very nice right now.\r\n",
        "Reva: Me neither. I just came from seeing my \r\nson in jail. ",
        "Cassie: Maybe jail time is what he needs. And \r\nwhat I need right now is for you to leave. ",
        "Reva: Not so fast, little sister. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Spaulding walked... because Judge Packard is an idiot. Listen, I've got \r\nto go, call me in the morning. Thanks. Tammy, what are you doing here? \n",
        "Tammy: I was just with Jonathan ",
        "Jeffrey: You saw him, how? ",
        "Tammy: It doesn't matter. What matters is he \r\nis still locked away and you won't even let them set bail. ",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy, it's a little more \r\ncomplicated the than that. ",
        "Tammy: You're loyal to my mom. I get that. \r\nBut she was wrong to turn us in, Jeffrey, the fire was an accident. You feel my \r\nmom made a mistake. I can feel it. ",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: Drop the charges, Jeffrey let Jonathan \r\ngo. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nBeth: This should be a fun ride home. I'm sure Alan is so pleased with us for \r\ntrying to keep him locked up. ",
        "Alexander: We could just leave, let Alan take \r\na taxi home. ",
        "Beth: I can't do that, he is my husband, and \r\nI want to keep an eye on him. ",
        "Alexander: Now, that is a good idea. \n",
        "Beth: Why is it taking so long? Excuse me, \r\nare they almost finished processing Mr. Spaulding's release? He is already gone.\r\n",
        "Alexandra: What do you mean gone? But he was \r\nbeing processed... ",
        "Man: I know. I did the grand honor myself.\r\n",
        "Beth: And he left? ",
        "Man: Puffing a fat cigar. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan-Michael: Okay, Dad, where are you? ( Knock on the door ) Marina. \n",
        "Marina: Hi. ",
        "Alan-Michael: What are you doing here? \n",
        "Marina: I just came to wish you a Happy New \r\nYear. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Happy New Year to you, too. \r\nListen, this really isn't.. ",
        "Marina: Well, aren't you going to take my \r\ncoat? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Whoa. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan: Stop this car! Gus? I'm not telling you again. ",
        "Gus: Watch your mouth, Dad, it will be a lot \r\neasier on both of us. Oh, and you better put your seat belt on. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\n( Cell phone rings ) ",
        "Dinah: You want to get that? ",
        "Mallet: No, it will go to voicemail. ( Cell \r\nphone rings ) Oh! What? Hmm, yeah. What are you talking about? What, Spaulding \r\ngot out? Man, oh, man. Gus was right. Why? Why, does he know? What are you \r\ntalking about, where in the hell is he then? ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan: I demand to know where you're taking me, Gus ",
        "Gus: I'm taking you to a place where you can \r\nnever hurt Harley or my family again. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: I waited under the marquee for hours and you never showed, and now \r\nyou're not in the hotel room, either. Where are you? I want to be mad, I really \r\ndo, but mostly I want you here. Can you get here. I love you. Where are you, \r\nGus? And no message, either. Great. What a lousy New Year's Eve. ",
        "O'Neill had no comment about \r\nSpaulding's release. In other news, the Springfield civic counsel will be \r\nfunding... ",
        "Harley: Alan is out. Oh, my God! ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nReva: Are you trying to push Tammy away, Cassie, is that your goal? ",
        "Cassie: The goal is to be her mother. I can't \r\nalways be a gal-pal, like her auntie. ",
        "Reva: I am trying to help her, Cassie, but we \r\nhave to be careful not to make the situation worse. ",
        "Cassie: Tammy is my child, and I will not sit \r\nback and watch while she makes the biggest mistake of her life. ",
        "Reva: And that mistake would be Jonathan, my \r\nchild? ",
        "Cassie: Don't tell me this is okay, what is \r\nhappening between them, because it is not. ",
        "Reva: That's not for us to say. ",
        "Cassie: The hell it isn't! They are children, \r\nand they are cousins, and if that is not enough, think about a year ago, and \r\nwhat he did to her was unforgivable. ",
        "Reva: What he did to her or what he did to \r\nyou? ",
        "Cassie: Both. ",
        "Reva: You're right, but he has changed.\r\n",
        "Cassie: He has not changed. He is still the \r\nsame son of a bitch he has always been. ",
        "Reva: Well, I guess that makes me the bitch, \r\nthen, huh? ",
        "Cassie: You helped them, you encouraged them \r\nto be together. ",
        "Reva: Well, they didn't need a whole lot of \r\nencouragement. ",
        "Cassie: No? What about the night before \r\nTammy's wedding? The private place you helped them find? What was your objective \r\nthen? ",
        "Reva: They needed some time together to be \r\nhonest with each other. Tammy wasn't in love with Sandy, not the way she is in \r\nlove with... ",
        "Cassie: Don't even say it. ",
        "Reva: Why not? Me not saying it isn't going \r\nto make it go away. ",
        "Cassie: Why didn't you tell me? ",
        "Reva: They weren't ready. And it wasn't my \r\nplace to tell you. ",
        "Cassie: Wasn't your place?! When have you \r\never worried about your place? I'm your sister, and this is my daughter. My \r\ndaughter was throwing her life away, you lied about it, and you told... you \r\npretended to be on my side. You weren't on my side, you weren't on Tammy's side. \r\nThe only person you care about is Jonathan ",
        "Reva: This isn't fair. ",
        "Cassie: Oh, it is. Because you're still \r\ntrying to clear up your guilt for what you have done in his life. ",
        "Reva: I was being a mother. ",
        "Cassie: So was I. ",
        "Reva: Really? By having Tammy arrested and \r\ndragged down to the police station and humiliated? Where was I when you made \r\nthat anonymous phone call? Was I out on your porch, ten feet away or when I had \r\ndriven away? ",
        "Cassie: If you stopped this months ago, this \r\nwouldn't have happened. Jonathan probably wouldn't have started that fire. A \r\nwoman was hurt. It could have been Tammy and who knows what it will be next \r\ntime? ",
        "Reva: Are you going to keep Jonathan locked \r\naway forever? ",
        "Cassie: I'll do whatever it takes to keep \r\nthem apart. ",
        "Reva: Well, they're not apart. They're \r\ntogether right now, and yeah, I arranged it. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Listen, I can't just release Jonathan ",
        "Tammy: You had me released the night you \r\nbrought me in. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you didn't attack a police \r\nofficer when you were in custody. ",
        "Tammy: This is not about the case. You're \r\nstalling on letting him out on bail because Mom doesn't want me anywhere near \r\nhim. ",
        "Jeffrey: Do you blame her? ",
        "Tammy: Yes. What kind of mother has her own \r\ndaughter arrested? ",
        "Jeffrey: The kind who is very worried. The \r\nkind who sees you going down a path with someone... ",
        "Tammy: Who loves her. ",
        "Jeffrey: I know he loves you, but I also know \r\nwho he is and what he is capable of. ",
        "Tammy: So he is not what you were at that \r\nage. You probably were already fighting crime. ",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? He is actually a lot \r\nlike I was at that age. But it doesn't make me feel any better. Call your mom.\r\n",
        "Tammy: Why? ",
        "Jeffrey: She is worried about you. Besides, I \r\nthink I know a way we can fix this. ",
        "Tammy: She is the one who needs to fix this. \r\nI know what I'm doing. Jonathan makes me happy. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well then let her see that, Tammy, \r\nshow your mom you know what you're doing, show her you have made your own \r\nchoice, and you haven't completely lost your mind, and come back to the farm. \r\nYou need to be with us right now. ",
        "Tammy: That's what Jonathan said. ",
        "Jeffrey: Well, he is right. That way you and \r\nyour mom have a chance to work this out. ",
        "Tammy: Okay, drop the charges, and I will. \r\nThat's what I thought. ",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy... ",
        "Beth: Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Alan is gone. \n",
        "Jeffrey: So? ",
        "Alexandra: So, we were waiting for him.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: And your hearts are broken because \r\nyou miss him. Guess what, ladies, Mr. Alan Spaulding is no longer under the care \r\nof the state. He is all yours. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, maybe the state will take \r\nhim back. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nDinah: What is wrong? ",
        "Mallet: Nothing, I hope. ",
        "Dinah: Gus is upset at Alan ",
        "Mallet: You can say that. That's why I have \r\nto go find him. What am I doing? I can't leave. ",
        "Dinah: Why not? ",
        "Mallet: Because it's not right. ",
        "Dinah: Forget about it. ",
        "Mallet: But you were upset about your dad, \r\nand you were pretty shaken up, and you and I got started... ",
        "Dinah: It is not your problem. Go. \n",
        "Mallet: You don't mind? ",
        "Dinah: Well, I mind a little, but I'm not \r\nneedy. ",
        "Mallet: I just don't want to do the walk of \r\nshame. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Hey. ",
        "Dinah: What? ",
        "Mallet: Nothing. I'll call you in the \r\nmorning. ",
        "Dinah: You don't have to. ",
        "Mallet: I know. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan-Michael: Okay, what are you doing? ",
        "Marina: Well, if you have to ask, then I'm \r\nnot doing it right. Do you want a drink? ",
        "Alan-Michael: No. And neither do you? \n",
        "Marina: Oh, yes I do. I am so thirsty. \n",
        "Alan-Michael: Okay, you've had your free \r\nbooze. It is time to go. ",
        "Marina: Wait, no. You haven't let me make my \r\ntoast. To coming to my senses. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Coming to your senses. \n",
        "Marina: Yes, about pining after someone who \r\ndoesn't want me. I did it for a year. Never again. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Why the big realization? \n",
        "Marina: Resolution. My number one. From now \r\non, when I want something, I am just going to grab it. You know, I used to be a \r\npretty big risk-taker, it came so naturally, and then something happened. From \r\nnow on, I'm going to just go after what I want. Care to join me, Alan-Michael?\r\n",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: Hey. You, I've been looking for your partner. Do you know where he is?\r\n",
        "Mallet: Gus? ",
        "Harley: Yeah, the guy you were working with \r\ntonight. Was he in the car? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm not -- I'm not really sure.\r\n",
        "Harley: Why not? ",
        "Mallet: Because he is not where I left him.\r\n",
        "Harley: Where did you leave him? ",
        "Mallet: In jail. ",
        "Harley: You mean at the station? ",
        "Mallet: No. In jail. I locked him up earlier, \r\nto keep him away from Alan, and unfortunately Gus has escaped, and I don't know \r\nwhere he is, and that's not a good thing. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nCassie: You helped Jonathan and Tammy be together for New Year's Why am I not \r\nsurprised? ",
        "Reva: She wanted to see him. ",
        "Cassie: Tammy doesn't know what she wants \r\nthese days. ",
        "Reva: I don't think you care what Tammy wants \r\nthese days. ",
        "Cassie: The hell I don't I am her mother...\r\n",
        "Reva: Then start acting like it. Cassie, \r\nhoney, listen to her, they love each other. ",
        "Cassie: It is okay with you, it is okay with \r\nyou that when they walk down the street hand- in-hand, and people will whisper \r\nand stare and they'll all think what they have is sick. ",
        "Reva: It is not sick. ",
        "Cassie: What, it's peachy? ",
        "Reva: It's... it's different. It is not like \r\nthey grew up together. ",
        "Cassie: It's wrong, Reva, it is wrong. And \r\neven if it weren't, he is not good enough for my daughter. ",
        "Reva: He is my son. He is Richard's son.\r\n",
        "Cassie: I don't care. I don't care. \n",
        "Reva: But you can't keep them apart. \n",
        "Cassie: Watch me. ",
        "Reva: Then I'm going to stop you, Cassie I \r\nwill stop you if you try to hurt them again. ",
        "Cassie: Wow. So here we are again. Here we \r\nare, with you making decisions about my life. About the people I love. \n",
        "Reva: Don't -- don't do this. ",
        "Cassie: It is Richard all over again. \n",
        "Jeffrey: Hey. ",
        "Cassie: Hi. How did the case go? ",
        "Jeffrey: We lost. Alan Spaulding was set \r\nfree. ",
        "Reva: Alan, free? He got off? ",
        "Cassie: Poor Harley ",
        "Jeffrey: Poor Springfield ",
        "Reva: I can't believe it. He killed Philip, \r\nfor God's sake. ",
        "Cassie: She is in danger. We have to... we \r\nhave to help her. ",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan-Michael: Marina, I can't ",
        "Marina: You know, Alan-Michael, you know you \r\nwant to. ",
        "Alan-Michael: We have to stop now. \n",
        "Marina: No, we don't ",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes, we do. ",
        "Marina: Come on, Alan-Michael, why are you \r\nplaying hard to get? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Believe it or not, I'm not \r\nplaying anything. ",
        "Marina: What's wrong? We had a date. \n",
        "Alan-Michael: Which we canceled for some \r\nreason. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, you were a little vague about \r\nthat. ",
        "Alan-Michael: I told you I had to work.\r\n",
        "Marina: On New Year's Eve? ",
        "Alan-Michael: It can't be helped. ",
        "Marina: Okay, well, it's past midnight. I \r\ndon't think it would kill you to quit early. ",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of \r\nsomething. ",
        "Marina: I'll let my Aunt Harley know you're \r\ndedicated. ",
        "Alan-Michael: She already knows. ",
        "Marina: What is wrong with you? ",
        "Alan-Michael: You're distracting me. \n",
        "Marina: Is there another girl here? Come out, \r\ncome out, wherever you are. ",
        "Alan-Michael: There is no one else here, \r\nMarina, it just isn't right. ",
        "Marina: Okay, now I know something is wrong. \r\nBecause ever since you became single, you have been dating, like, oh, ten girls \r\nat once. You pride yourself in being a player. You're trying to get rid of me \r\nfor a reason, and I'm not going to leave here until I figure out what that is.\r\n",
        "\r\n___________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: Wait a second. Back up. Gus escaped. Explain this to me, slowly, please, \r\nand start from the beginning. ",
        "Mallet: Gus has been worried about Alan all \r\nweek. ",
        "Harley: I know, he almost beat up one of my \r\ninterns who he thought was working for Alan ",
        "Mallet: That's right, that's why I locked him \r\nup. I was worried about the whole vigilante factor. ",
        "Harley: Did you talk to him about that?\r\n",
        "Mallet: Yeah, he tried to recruit me, and I \r\nsaid I wasn't going to step over the line, and he said he wasn't going to do \r\nthat either. ",
        "Harley: And you didn't believe him? \n",
        "Mallet: No, hence the jail cell. So you guys \r\nwere supposed to meet? ",
        "Harley: Hours ago, and he never showed.\r\n",
        "Mallet: And you haven't seen him all night?\r\n",
        "Harley: How long ago did he get free from \r\nthat cell? ",
        "Mallet: Hours ago. ",
        "Harley: You don't think... ",
        "Mallet: Harley, don't panic. ",
        "Harley: This coming from the guy who locked \r\nhim up to keep him out of trouble. ",
        "Mallet: It was a precaution. ",
        "Harley: Drastic. Should I be worried about my \r\nhusband? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, a little. ",

        "\r\nHarley: You think Gus is with Alan? ",
        "Mallet: Maybe, maybe not. ",
        "Harley: Maybe he's out doing some late-night \r\ngrocery shopping. That's possible. ",
        "Mallet: Where you going? ",
        "Harley: To the house. Basically what you're \r\nsaying, he and Gus have just disappeared. ",
        "Mallet: Basically, but maybe it is not as bad \r\nas it sounds. ",
        "Harley: No, maybe it's not. I could kill him.\r\n",
        "Mallet: Gus or Alan? ",
        "Harley: Why does he do this? Why does he feel \r\nhe has to go off on his own to try to protect me? ",
        "Mallet: Because some guys are like that.\r\n",
        "Harley: Yeah, some guys are. Why hasn't he \r\ncalled? What is he doing? ",
        "Mallet: I don't know, Harley, but we'll find \r\nhim. ",

        "\r\nAlan-Michael: You're such a cop. There is no mystery here. Our date tonight, I \r\nthink you misunderstood. ",
        "Marina: What is there to misunderstand, a \r\ndate is a date. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Unless it is a couple of \r\nfriends who have nothing to do for New Year's and decide to hang out tonight.\r\n",
        "Marina: I really was your standby. I thought \r\nyou were just kidding about that. ",
        "Alan-Michael: It makes me kind of a jerk, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Marina: Yeah. So has this whole thing just \r\nbeen a misunderstanding? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Look, the flirting is fun, but \r\nyou're a kid. ",
        "Marina: A kid? Why didn't you think about \r\ntelling me this before? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Because I thought we were on \r\nthe same page. I didn't think you would take it seriously. ",
        "Marina: You didn't think I would take it \r\nseriously. I think I'd better go before I grab my service revolver. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina, wait. Come on, Dad, \r\nwhere are you? ",
        "Alexandra: Well, someone is here. ",

        "Alan-Michael: Aunt Alex, Beth. ",
        "Beth: Alan-Michael, what are you doing here?\r\n",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm working. ",
        "Beth: On New Year's Eve? ",
        "Alan-Michael: I didn't have anything better \r\nto do. What brings you two here so late? ",

        "Marina: How ironic. So what did you do?\r\n",
