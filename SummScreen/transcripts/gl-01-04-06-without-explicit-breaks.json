        "Harley: Oh, you're home. \n",
        "Gus: Of course I am. \n",
        "Harley: Oh, I was so worried, \r\nso worried. I thought you had gone off after Alan and done something crazy. But \r\nyou didn\u2019t. You're home, you're here. Don't turn it off, because it is our song. \r\nIt is our song. Well, it is for now. Gus, Gus, Gus. Gus!\n",
        "Harley: It was just a dream. ",
        "Gus: \"I made a vow to keep you \r\nsafe. Alan has never been more of a threat to you, to us. So if you're reading \r\nthis, that means he is out. I'm not going to wait for him to come after us, so \r\nI'm going to go after him. I'm going to keep him away from you until I can \r\nfigure out a way to have him locked up for good, or whatever it takes to protect \r\nyou. I love you, Harley. You know I do. Gus.\" ",
        "One day without you, without \r\nyou my love ",
        "one day without you without \r\nyou, my love ",
        "Zach: Rise and shine, Mommy. ",
        "Harley: Good morning. How are you, my big \r\nboy. ",
        "Zach: Where is Gus? ",
        "Harley: He is away on important police \r\nbusiness. ",
        "Zach: When he is coming home? ",
        "Harley: Soon. Way before that. I mean really, \r\nreally soon. How is your science project coming, buddy? ",
        "Zach: Good, but I need Gus to help me make \r\nthe volcano. ",
        "Harley: Well, I'll help you make it. Let's do \r\nit fast before you leave for school. ( Laughing ) ",
        "Zach: I'm going to beat you. ",
        "Harley: Okay, come here. And I made you your \r\nfavorite sandwich. Have a good day. I love you. ",
        "( Cell phone rings ) ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: I have to find Philip. ",
        "Gus: Can I help you? ",
        "Harley: No. ",
        "Gus: You need me. ",
        "Harley: I can do it on my own. I \r\ncan get through a day. I can do my job, I can take care of my kids because \r\nthat's who I am. That's what I do. ",
        "Gus: Someday, you're going to \r\nrealize that we wasted so much time.\n",
        "Harley: Well, that's a chance I'll \r\nhave to take. ",
        "Harley: Duncan, hold all my calls today, \r\nunless it is my husband. I am certain he will call me today. I'm busy. Get out \r\nof my chair. ",
        "Mallet: You going to hate me today? \n",
        "Harley: Get out. Get out. ",
        "Mallet: You know, Gus may be gone... \n",
        "Harley: Gus may be gone? ",
        "Mallet: But I'm not. ",
        "Harley: No, Gus is gone, and it is your \r\nfault. ",
        "Mallet: I know you're ticked that Gus took \r\noff, but please, do not blame me for that. I'm the one who put him in a jail \r\ncell. ",
        "Harley: And you're also the one who let him \r\nout. I don't need your help. He won't be gone long. He loves me.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I heard that before. I know you \r\nhave Frank working on the case, but he is desk-bound. And if you continue to \r\nkeep me at arm's length away... ",
        "Harley: Thank you. Truly, no. ",
        "Mallet: No? ( Laughs ) Okay, fine. \n",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: I know that Gus will be back soon, but in the meantime... ",
        "Frank: Sis, I know you're worried about Gus, \r\nand we're doing everything we possibly can. ",
        "Harley: What is \"everything\"? ",
        "Frank: You know the routine. We're calling \r\nthe hospitals, checking the morgue. ",
        "Harley: Oh. ",
        "Frank: Sorry. That's just procedure. \n",
        "Harley: And the train stations. ",
        "Frank: And the bus stations, yes. I put an \r\nAPB out on Gus and on Alan. And when I find him, I'm going to kill him myself. \r\nWhat was he thinking? ",
        "Harley: He was thinking he was protecting me \r\nfrom Alan. ",
        "Frank: Why didn\u2019t he come to me in the first \r\nplace? He should have been a cop, which he is, or at least a man. ",
        "Harley: Okay, okay, not now. ",
        "Frank: Sis, look, I'm sorry. I just thought \r\nGus was past all this, you know? ",
        "Gus: Are you hungry? You want to \r\nget a little something? ",
        "Harley: No, I don't. We're \r\npartners, we're not dating. ",
        "Gus: Whatever. Who said anything \r\nabout being partners? ",
        "Harley: We are working together.\r\n",
        "Gus: I'm the FBI, and you're the \r\nlocal talent. You were thrown to me... ",
        "Harley: Local talent? ",
        "Gus: Yeah. The point is, I've done \r\na thousand of these cases. He is shedding his identity because he wants to \r\nbecome somebody new, somebody that cannot be traced. But that will ultimately be \r\nhis downfall. ",
        "Harley: What will? ",
        "Gus: That he is the same person-- \r\nhis life, his nature, his habits. He is the same guy.\n",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: Still the same guy. Yes, so if a man comes in who fits the description \r\nthat I just gave you and buys some pepto bismal, please give me a call. \n",
        "Dinah: What is going on? ",
        "Harley: I'm calling pharmacies to see if he \r\nis buying medicine for his ulcer, because when he is stressed out, he needs a \r\ncase of the pink stuff.",
        "Dinah: So you're calling all pharmacies in \r\nthe area? ",
        "Harley: Within a 50-mile radius. ",
        "Dinah: Why are we stopping with the 50-mile \r\nradius? ",
        "Harley: I'm glad you said that, because when \r\nhe is stressed out, he needs cheeseburgers and onion rings, and I bet he starts \r\nsmoking again. ",
        "Dinah: Okay. ",
        "Harley: Go home. ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nOne day without you, without you, my love ",
        "one day without you, without \r\nyou, my love ",
        "I've gone as far as I can\r\n",
        "and the day must begin, my love\r\n",
        "one day without you, without \r\nyou, my love ",
        "one day without you, without \r\nyou, my love ",
        "Harley: Okay. I've got to get Zach off to \r\nschool, go to the office, call Frank, see if he has any new leads. ",
        "And the day must begin, my \r\nlove. ",
        "Zach: Rise and shine, Mommy. ",
        "Harley: Hey, how are you this morning? ( \r\nLaughter ) ",
        "Zach: Where is Gus? ",
        "Harley: He is still away, sweetie. \n",
        "Zach: When is he coming home? ",
        "Harley: Soon. ",
        "Zach: In time for our family trip? \n",
        "Harley: Of course. Gus would never miss our \r\nfamily trip. ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nBuzz: I think I screwed up. Well, when we found out that Alan was getting \r\nreleased, Gus and I had a couple of discussions, and he was understandably \r\nworried and determined. ",
        "Harley: Yes, determined to protect me. \n",
        "Buzz: And the kids. I was right there with \r\nhim. I should have been the voice of reason. ",
        "Harley: What difference would that have made? \r\nYou know Gus. It is not going to change his mind, anyway. ",
        "Buzz: Probably not. ",
        "Harley: Definitely not. ",
        "Buzz: Whatever he has done, it can't be bad. \r\nNot that bad. He wants to scare Alan. He wouldn't hurt him. After all, he is his \r\nfather. ",
        "Harley: Do you really think that Gus wouldn't \r\nhurt Alan? ",
        "Gus: The guy was so in love with \r\nher, he would have done anything. It didn\u2019t matter, he loved her and he wanted \r\nto keep a smile on his face. ",
        "Harley: Honey, they were both \r\ncrazy. Were you watching the same movie? ",
        "Gus: Maybe they were, but I get it. \r\nI would have done the same thing. ",
        "Harley: You wouldn't even let me \r\neat the last gummy bear. ",
        "Gus: Because it was red. But it is \r\ntrue, you know? ",
        "Harley: That you can see gummy \r\nbears in the dark? ",
        "Gus: No, that I would risk \r\neverything, I would do anything to make sure you're happy, to keep a smile on \r\nyour face. ",
        "Harley: Wow, that movie really got \r\nto you. ",
        "Gus: I don't really think it is \r\nabout the movie. It is about all of the little things, you know, like this. You \r\nbrushing up against me, you know. ",
        "Harley: I know. ",
        "Gus: You do? ",
        "Harley: You don't have to say it.\r\n",
        "Gus: No. I love you. I love you. \r\nYou're my life. I'd do anything for you. I'd die for you. I'd kill for you.\r\n",
        "Harley: You know what, Daddy, there is \r\nsomething I have to take care of. ",
        "Mallet: Sorry. Oh, hey. Hey. ",
        "Harley: You locked Gus up, right? ",
        "Mallet: Yeah. ",
        "Harley: Because you wanted to help him?\r\n",
        "Mallet: Yeah. ",
        "Harley: Well, see, my dad thinks Gus might do \r\nsomething to Alan, something that can't be undone. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that is kind of what I've been \r\nafraid of. ",
        "Harley: So I need your help. ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I want to find him as much as \r\nyou do. ",
        "Harley: Okay, well, if we're going to do \r\nthis, before we do this, if it requires doing something kind of outside the \r\nparameters of the law... ",
        "Mallet: Are you asking me if I can look the \r\nother way? ",
        "Harley: I can, can you? You're on the job, so \r\nI know I'm asking for a lot. ",
        "Mallet: You've asked for a lot before. \n",
        "Harley: But you always seem to come through \r\nfor me. So will you do it this time? Will you put your badge away for me, for \r\nGus? ",
        "Mallet: No. No, no, not for Gus. ",
        "Harley: He's your partner. And, come on, you \r\nknow those Spaulding's, they always skate, no matter what. You could do it \r\nbecause you know Alan might hurt my kids. ",
        "Mallet: You know what? I would do it for you. \r\nYou I would do it for. To be perfectly honest, if I'm going to put my career on \r\nthe line, then... hey, how are you? ",
        "Dinah: Do you have any leads? ",
        "Harley: No. I was just asking Mallet if he \r\nwould help me look for him. ",
        "Dinah: Sure he would. ",
        "Mallet: Of course I would. I was just asking \r\nHarley a question. ",
        "Harley: Yes I understand. ",
        "Mallet: Okay, good. I'll talk to Frank, make \r\nsome phone calls and get everybody up to speed. ",
        "Harley: What time is it? I've got to go back \r\nto the office. ",
        "Gus: Quitting time. Quitting time. \r\nQuitting time. ",
        "Harley: No. ",
        "Gus: It is quitting time. \n",
        "Harley: No, because I have to \r\napprove these figures before the end of the 2005 calendar year. ",
        "Gus: Is that right? I don't care \r\nabout that because that is tomorrow. The very last day is tomorrow... \n",
        "Harley: And tomorrow is New Year's \r\nEve, and I would like to enjoy New Year's Eve with my husband unencumbered by my \r\nworkload because I didn\u2019t finish. ",
        "Gus: It is quitting time. It is \r\nquitting time, honey. I want to go back to our love nest. I thought we would \r\nspend every minute together until the whole thing...\n",
        "Harley: What? ",
        "Gus: ...Until the whole thing is \r\nthat the countdown? ",
        "Harley: It is not the countdown.\r\n",
        "Gus: It is not just static. I'll \r\ntell you what, if that is not the countdown, would you dance with me? Can we do \r\nour own little countdown? We can count... what can we count? Let's count our \r\nblessings. Let's count our blessings. I'll start with... well, you're at the top \r\nof my list. I'll start with you, yeah. ",
        "Harley: You are so cute when you're \r\nbeing sappy. ",
        "Gus: I love you, and no matter \r\nwhatever happens, you will remember that, right? ",
        "Harley: Gus? ",
        "Gus: Uh-oh, there it is. Three, \r\ntwo, one. Happy New Year, baby. Happy New Year. ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan-Michael: Hey, boss. Harley, you okay? ",
        "Harley: No. I have... I have to find Gus. And \r\nI need... I need... I need you to take care of things while I do that. Dinah \r\nwill help you, of course, but I need to know you're in charge. I need you to be \r\nin charge for me, because if anybody sees any weakness in me... ",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, it's okay. ",
        "Harley: You don't understand. People are \r\ntrying to steal this company out from under me, from us, from the family. \n",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley, don't worry. I'll take \r\ncare of everything. ",
        "Harley: I'll call you, okay. I'll just call \r\nyou. Can I just leave you with this mess? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Go. Don't worry. I'll take care \r\nof everything. I've got you covered. Yeah, got you covered. ",
        "One day without you, without \r\nyou, my love. ",
        "Gus: I love you, honey, you know I \r\ndo. ",
        "Harley: I didn\u2019t ask you to protect me. I \r\ndidn\u2019t ask you to take off and do something stupid. You left me! ",
        "One day without you, without \r\nyou, my love. ",
        "Zach: Rise and shine, Mommy. Why is the door \r\nlocked? Is Gus home? Is Gus in there with you? ",
        "Harley: Sweetie, I'm fine, honey. Everything \r\nis fine. Listen, baby, Uncle Rick is going to take you guys to school this \r\nmorning, okay? ",
        "Zach: Are we still going on the trip? \n",
        "Harley: We'll talk about it later, okay? \r\nBuddy, I don't want you to be late for school, so why don't you go and we'll \r\njust talk later. I love you. ( Cell phone rings ) ( knock on the door ) \n",
        "Harley: Go away. ",
        "Buzz: I don't think so. ",
        "Harley: Daddy, not now, okay? Did you just \r\nkick open that door? ",
        "Buzz: ( Laughs ) Yeah, it looks like I've \r\nstill got it. ",
        "Harley: I took some cold medicine. \n",
        "Buzz: Yeah, I know that cold medicine makes \r\nme cry, too. Honey... ",
        "Harley: I'm so tired, Daddy. I can't do this. \r\nI have too much to do. I have to take care of my kids. I've got to go to work. \r\nThat's all I want to do. I just want Gus to come back... ( sobbing ) ...so it \r\ndoesn't hurt every time I breathe. ",
        "Buzz: Honey, there is a good chance that \r\nGus... ",
        "Harley: Don\u2019t. Don't! ",
        "Harley: What are you doing here, \r\nGus? I'm never getting out of here, and we will never be together again. Do you \r\nunderstand that? We will never be together again! Why can't you get that through \r\nyour head? ",
        "Gus: Why would I do that? \n",
        "Harley: Why won't you listen to me? \r\nI have done everything in my power to make you... ",
        "Gus: Go away? Get rid of me? Is \r\nthat it? But I keep coming back, right? You think this is tough for you? I got \r\nto wake up every single morning and you're not there. I want to pull the covers \r\nover my head and never get up again, but I do it. I drag myself out of that bed \r\nevery single morning and I shower and I shave-- well, sometimes I shave-- and I \r\ndo it, why? I do it for you. I do it for you. And even sometimes when I don't \r\nhave faith, I act like I do because the only other option is to lose you, and \r\nthat is not going to happen. ",
        "Harley: Hey, Mallet, it's me. Listen, grab a \r\npencil. Yeah, I want you to make sure you have all of Gus' credit card numbers, \r\nmake sure they're accurate, and I want you to check every single lead we have. \r\nMake sure you haven't missed anything, I mean anything! ",
        "my love one day without you \r\nwithout you, my love. ",
        "Harley: I'll just get you a new one when you \r\ncome home. ",
        "My love. ",
        "Zach: Rise and shine, Mommy. ",
        "Harley: Hi. Oh, good morning, did you have \r\nbreakfast yet? Why don't we go down and make you some breakfast, because I don't \r\nknow about you, but I am starving, and I have a big, big day today, okay? Good \r\nmorning, Duncan, listen, I... I'm much better today, thank you. ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nMallet: Get Ms. Cooper on the line, and tell her to get her butt down here. I've \r\ngot some news for her. ",
        "Harley: I'm here. When you said that you \r\nwould search for Gus, but it would be for me, then I deflected and I tried to \r\nmake it about something else, and it wasn't fair to else, and it wasn't fair to \r\nyou. ",
        "Mallet: First of all, I should not have put \r\nthat condition on you. I'm sorry. ",
        "Harley: No, you were being honest. And I was \r\ntrying to act like you're the only person who has been harboring any feelings \r\nsince, you know, back when we were together. And it is not true. ",
        "Mallet: What's not true? ",
        "Harley: I have those feelings, too. I mean, \r\nyou know, when we were together in prison, yeah, that was obvious. But the thing \r\nis, it has kind of continued pretty much right up until... well, like right now. \r\nAnd, also, I should tell you, I've been having these dreams about you. \n",
        "Mallet: Harley, don't do this. Please don't \r\ndo this right now. ",
        "Harley: Dreams about you, and I've been \r\nworrying so much about you and that, and I think I missed some clue, some clue \r\nhe was giving me about what his intention was. ",
        "Mallet: First of all, don't blame yourself... \r\ndon't blame yourself for him taking off, okay? And, secondly, you're married, \r\nand I'm... I'm trying to respect that. Are you saying that if Gus weren't in our \r\nlife, that you and I would be together? ",
        "Harley: I'm saying Gus is in my life. He's \r\nright there. He is my husband, and I love him. But I feel for you, and I do... I \r\ndo. But I won't act on it. Not ever. And I can deal with that. Can you? \n",
        "Mallet: I've got a lead on Gus. The limo \r\ncompany, and apparently Gus came down there and checked out a limo, and he never \r\nbrought it back. It was expected a couple of days ago? ",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) There is hope! That means \r\nthere is hope! ",
        "Mallet: Yeah. ",
        "Harley: Duncan, don't turn it off. Turn it \r\nup. Turn it up! ",
        "\r\n________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: What was that? ",
        "Gus: Termites, nothing to worry \r\nabout. ",
        "Harley: I need you. It is \r\nreassuring, like, I don't know, it is going to be okay. ",
        "Gus: Listen to me... ",
        "Harley: We're going down. \n",
        "Gus: There is nothing but us. We \r\nare on our way to a very romantic honeymoon in Greece. We just got married. Do \r\nyou actually think the universe would be that cruel to us? ",
        "Harley: I don't know. ",
        "Gus: I don't care. I don't care, \r\nbecause no matter what happens, I'll find you, okay? ",
        "Harley: I'll always find you, Gus. \r\n( Laughs ) ",
        "Gus: Okay? Look at that, huh? \r\nNothing but blue skies. Nothing but blue skies. ",
        "One day without you, without \r\nyou, my love... ",
