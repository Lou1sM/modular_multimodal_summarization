        "While Reva keeps vigil at the hospital, Jeffrey pays a visit. She is struck by his repeated kindness to her and her family and wonders if someone new in his life has made a difference. Jeffrey sidesteps any question that would lead to Marah and instead asks Reva to look at the license plate that came off the car they found at the river. Without knowing it belonged to Alan or even that it had been submerged, Reva surprises herself by \"reading\" the tag -- and seeing someone drowning. At first, she believes it's Shayne and fears for his recovery; but once she's reassured her son is all right, Reva sees the true face of the drowning man. The face belongs to Josh.",
        "Carrie gives Marah, Marina and Michelle her perspective on what happened to Maryanne Caruthers while Josh, Alan, Billy, Buzz and Ed are forced to look once more at the choices they made that fateful evening in 1977 when they met Maryanne at the county fair. Alan recalls slipping a drug into a pitcher of beer that he then distributes to Maryanne and the other guys. The men remember cramming into a car, drunk and reckless, only to crash into the river. Josh recalls his brush with death when Billy pulled his drowning brother from the river. But all the men recall that despite their searching, Maryanne never resurfaced. They made a pact on the riverbank to never speak of what had happened that night.",
        "By the end of the day, Josh, Alan, Billy, Buzz and Ed must reaffirm, once again, the solemn pact they made thirty years ago on a night they can, God help them, never forget."

        "Cassie: Have a good day, Mr. O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you, Mrs. Winslow, but my day is half over.",
        "Cassie: I thought you got off to a late start. Didn't see you at breakfast this morning.",
        "Jeffrey: Room service is a wonderful thing.",
        "Cassie: Now you're off to the office?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, dear. You know, I always wanted to say that to someone. Just to hear how it sounded. I don't like it. Actually, I'm on my way to the hospital.",
        "Cassie: Someone sick?",
        "Jeffrey: They're doing much better, actually. I'm going to see your nephew, Shayne.",
        "Cassie: Really?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. What? I like the guy.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well he's a likable kind of guy. You just seem to be awfully cozy with my family now.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, your family is very cozy, with one notable exception, of course. Reva, Shayne,",
        "Cassie: Marah.",
        "Jeffrey: Even your brother-in-law, Josh, the first man in this town I have been able to get drunk with. I guess that automatically makes me part of the Lewis family. I guess you'd better add me to the Christmas list for next year.",
        "Cassie: It's not so bad, you know.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: Belonging somewhere, having people.",
        "Jeffrey: I have people.",
        "Cassie: Oh, I don't know. You seem like you isolate yourself. And I Ok, well I'm sorry. Have a nice visit with Shayne.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I will have a nice visit with He and I connect.",
        "Cassie: You and Shayne, you connect? You guys couldn't be more opposite. He's loving, he's kind. He doesn't have a hidden agenda.",
        "Jeffrey: Shayne's a remarkable young man. You know, he had his whole life mapped out in front of him and he worked hard to get what he wanted and just when he was about to get everything that meant the most to him, bam, just like that, gone, over. His whole future changed and there's no going back.",
        "Cassie: Is that what happened to you?",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't say that. I feel for the kid. That's all. It reminds you of how life can change just like that. (Snaps finger)",
        "Carrie: So, Michelle, you want to hear the whole truth about Maryanne Caruthers. Are you sure that's really what you want?",
        "Marina: Yes",
        "Marah: Yes",
        "Carrie: What if I tell you the whole story and you don't like what you hear?",
        "Michelle: I can't be any worse than the limbo we're in right now.",
        "Carrie: Oh, my dear, my dear, I wouldn't be too sure of that.",
        "Marina: All you've given us are little pieces, the head stone, the car, the bridges. We don't know how it adds up.",
        "Marah: Or how our fathers fit into this.",
        "Michelle: You made us doubt the people we trust most in this world.",
        "Marina: My grandfather goes out of his way to avoid me.",
        "Michelle: And my dad almost gave a patient the wrong medication.",
        "Marah: My mother and father should be back together but something is holding my father back, and my brother just had major surgery and is lying in bed. I should be there with him, not arguing with you. Cassie. I'm the cause of all of your woes.",
        "Michelle: We don't have the time or patience. We need to know who she was and what exactly happened the night she died and we need to know now.",
        "Ed: Keep your hands off of me.",
        "Alan: Look, Ed, if you think you're going to walk out of here, tell the truth, and somehow feel better about this, you're a fool!",
        "Ed: Alan this, has to end now.",
        "Billy: This ends when we say it ends!",
        "(All speaking at once)",
        "Reva: Oh, Amy. Is something wrong with Shayne?",
        "Amy: No, I was just checking his vitals. He's fine. I didn't realize you were still here.",
        "Reva: Actually I just went for a walk to get the kinks out.",
        "Amy: Shayne's gonna be asleep for a while. Why don't you get home and get some rest?",
        "Reva: I'll go home when I can take my son with me.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: How's he doing?",
        "Reva: He woke up from the surgery, thank God, but all the doctors will say is wait and see.",
        "Jeffrey: Doctors have to be even more cautious than lawyers these days.",
        "Reva: Except for you, Jeffrey. You're not cautious at all, are you?",
        "Jeffrey: I've been known to bend a few rules.",
        "Reva: And go the extra mile, you know, like you did with the acupuncture option for Shayne. Introducing him to Dr. Yuan...",
        "Jeffrey: I thought it would help.",
        "Reva: It did. Is there something going on with you? Something different in your life? You seem to have softened lately.",
        "Jeffrey: Have I grown a heart? Uh-oh.",
        "Reva: Whatever it is, I'd like to know what's caused it, or maybe I should say who has cause it.",
        "Jeffrey: I introduced Shayne to Dr. Yuan. Doesn't mean I'm all warm and fuzzy.",
        "Reva: But there is also the kids.",
        "Jeffrey: What about the kids?",
        "Reva: You seem to have lost your aversion to children, at least according to Cassie. At Christmastime you were great. You even bought them gifts",
        "Jeffrey: I knew they would pout and complain if I didn't.",
        "Reva: And then there's Marah.",
        "Jeffrey: The Fashion Queen of Springfield?",
        "Reva: My daughter.",
        "Jeffrey: What about her?",
        "Reva: You asked her about some contracts.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah is very talented, but a bit naive where business is concerned. I didn't want anyone taking advantage of her. That's all.",
        "Reva: Nor do I.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, speaking of the contracts, you know, they sent me the signed copies, and I just happen to have them with me.",
        "Reva: What am I supposed to do with them?",
        "Jeffrey: Will you give them to her?",
        "Reva: Why can't you give them to her yourself?",
        "Jeffrey: Because you'll see her before I do",
        "Reva: Is that your license plate?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, it is.",
        "Reva: It's rusty. It looks like it's been under water or something.",
        "Jeffrey: Actually, it doesn't belong to me. It's for a case I'm working on.",
        "Reva: It's evidence?",
        "Jeffrey: It might be.",
        "Reva: So the DA's hat goes back on. Or maybe you've been wearing it all along.",
        "Jeffrey: I am concern about Shayne.",
        "Reva: But you thought if you brought this to me, I might get a feeling or impression.",
        "Jeffrey: When you found that girl in Chicago, it was extraordinary.",
        "Reva: Is this a missing person's case?",
        "Jeffrey: You tell me.",
        "Carrie: You're right. I've doled out this information very gradually. I had my reasons.",
        "Marina: To drive us crazy?",
        "Carrie: Only partially: I wanted you to absorb the information at your own speed. I wanted you to hear and see all of the evidence with your own eyes.",
        "Michelle: What evidence? We found a grave with her head stone, but no record of her life there. There's no... You say she drove off Cutter's Bridge, but there is no proof.",
        "Carrie: Proof? But you saw the car.",
        "Marah: Whose car? Hers, someone else's. And if Maryanne did die going off that bridge, why is there no record?",
        "Marina: When we found out when she died, we looked through every record of every accident and there is no file.",
        "Carrie: But you're ignoring the most important evidence of all.",
        "Michelle: Which is what?",
        "Carrie: The way Josh, Buzz and Edward have reacted every time that Maryanne's name has been mentioned. You've said yourself, your father is nearly at the breaking point. And Marah, your father can't reconcile with your mother. And Marina, your grandfather --",
        "Marina: I'm through with this. We have listened to you and you just talk and talk and we've been on your side.",
        "Michelle: Marina is right. This game of yours is hurting people we love.",
        "Carrie: A game? A game? A woman is dead is that the kind of game you want to play?",
        "Michelle: Look, all we're saying --",
        "Carrie: I know what you're saying. You want to know the truth about Maryanne Caruthers, but are you prepared for it? Are you ready? Fine. But first, the rings. Put them on, please.",
        "Marah: Are we going to make a wish?",
        "Carrie: You've already made your wish. You wish to hear the truth about Maryanne Caruthers. And when you hear the truth, perhaps you'll really understand the meaning of \"Beware of what you wish for\".",
        "Josh: You've got to get a hold of yourself, right now.",
        "Ed: You okay?",
        "Bill: I'm sorry, Buzz. That wasn't meant for you.",
        "Josh: What the hell is the matter with you?",
        "Billy: Why don't you ask Bauer, there He's the one that's a quitter.",
        "Alan: Everybody, just calm down, get control of yourself.",
        "Buzz: Why don't we all be like you and feel nothing?",
        "Alan: I feel. I feel. I just don't let my feelings blind me from the truth.",
        "Ed: Which is, if it weren't for you, we wouldn't be in this mess.",
        "Alan: Baring your soul accomplishes nothing, Ed, except create more pain for all of us.",
        "Josh: What do you suggest as an alternative? More lies, more self deception, Alan?",
        "Alan: I've never deceived myself, Josh. I've simply been pragmatic.",
        "Buzz: Maybe the time for pragmatism has passed. I don't know how much more I can take of this. Maybe Ed is right. Maybe we have to come clean. Maybe we just have to come clean if we are going to live with ourselves.",
        "Alan: I can live with myself. Because I know what the alternative is. Ed, you say you can't stand the look that Michelle gives you of mistrust. Well, think of the way she will look at you when she finds out the truth. And Marina adores you, Buzz. Do you think she'll adore you when she finds out the truth? What about Frank, what about Harley? Will they respect their father the way they do now? Josh, do you really believe that Reva will understand?",
        "Josh: You know what? Maybe she will.",
        "Alan: No, Josh, she never will. Now we made a choice that terrible night in our life, and it was the right choice, and you want to know what we should do now? We should do exactly what we have been doing all along. Keep our mouths shut.",
        "Reva: I don't read inanimate objects. I'm a people person.",
        "Jeffrey: This belonged to another human being, so",
        "Reva: Well, from a very long time ago. But you know, this really isn't my thing. My forte is connecting with people who have... This plate is related to someone who's dead.",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't say that.",
        "Reva: You have a hunch about it. You suspect it. And you also suspect foul play, otherwise you wouldn't be interested?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know, really. That's the truth. I don't know why this ended up where it did or how it ended up where it did. But I would like to know, and if you could help, I would really appreciate it. As a matter of fact, Reva, why don't we call it payback for Dr. Yuan?",
        "Reva: So much for Mr. Warm and Fuzzy. Fine. I'm just sitting here anyway. I might as well do something useful.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you. Great. Do you want me to stay here or leave you two alone?",
        "Reva: You can leave. But bring me back some coffee. Milk, no sugar.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. What?",
        "Reva: I'm seeing... a corn muffin, too. I knew it. Nothing.",
        "Carrie: Beginnings. They're always so hard to define. Let's start with an evening, the evening of October 17, 1977. A county harvest fair on the outskirts of town.",
        "Ed: I wish we had never gone to that stupid fair.",
        "Alan: It was your idea.",
        "Buzz: Who cares whose idea it was. We went.",
        "Josh: You know, that's something I always wondered, Alan. Was that really just a coincidence that we all ended up at the same fair?",
        "Alan: Do you think I planned it that way? I hardly knew you.",
        "Josh: Didn't stop from you roping us into your plans, did it?",
        "Buzz: Whose idea was this corn ball fair, Billy?",
        "Billy: Hey, there's some mighty pretty fillies around here.",
        "Buzz:: Check out the girls in Bangkok. Do have you a plan?",
        "Alan: Patience, gents, the night is still young.",
        "Carrie: Even as a young man Alan Spaulding made his own rules. Brandon Spaulding's son, heir to the fortune. When he saw something, he usually just took it.",
        "Josh: You know, me and Billy were just country boys. But, Alan, I never understood why you wanted to go to that fair at all.",
        "Buzz: Alan just wanted to check out the livestock.",
        "Ed: From the moment we got there, I had a bad feeling. I just wanted to leave.",
        "Josh: Same here.",
        "Billy: Yeah, and we both know why.",
        "Josh: This fair makes me think of home.",
        "Billy: Makes you think of Reva Shayne, you mean. Dang Joshua. We come all the way to Springfield to check out a business deal for HB, and all you can think about is the gal you left back home. Hey, hey, Doc. Maybe you can help me out here. I think my little brother is love sick.",
        "Josh: Billy.",
        "Billy: Ain't you proud to have such a fine gal, Josh?",
        "Ed: You just met her, Josh.",
        "Josh: No, I've known her a while.",
        "Billy: Her momma is our housekeeper.",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Alan: Your father must love his son mooning over the hired help.",
        "Josh: Did I ask your opinion?",
        "Carrie: Even back then, Marah, your father was besotted with your mother. He would never even think of looking at another woman, but he was with his big, bad brother, and his brother had a way of leading Josh into trouble. And you know your grandfather was no stranger to trouble, Marina. And Buzz was back in Springfield on leave from the service. And was only back for a few days. That's the way he wanted it. Not even his family knew he was in town. By contrast, your father, Michelle, seemed like the perfect upstanding citizen. A hard working resident from one of Springfield's best families with a wonderful career ahead of him, but Ed was sabotaging that bright future with a drinking problem he could not or would not face. Ditto for your Uncle Billy, Marah. The young men were already on their third pitcher of beer.",
        "Alan: First, I'd like to propose a toast. Gentlemen,... Miss Mary -- Miss Maryanne Caruthers.",
        "Josh: What was about it that girl, Alan? Why did you want her so much?",
        "Bill: She was rich, like him.",
        "Buzz: Because she was beautiful.",
        "Ed: Because she told him no and he couldn't stand that.",
        "Ed: Forget it, Alan. She's the one girl in Springfield that doesn't want you.",
        "Alan: She's not my type anyway. She's older. And she's too much of a party girl. You should see her when she drinks. Makes a real spectacle of yourself.",
        "Josh: Sounds like your kind of gal, Billy Boy.",
        "Alan: You guys want to see her in action? If you do, I've got just the thing.",
        "Marina: So, what was in the vile. Cocaine?",
        "Carrie: No, it was the drug that Spaulding Pharmaceuticals had developed.",
        "Michelle: The white powder the old curator discovered, from Ancient Egypt.",
        "Carrie: One and the same.",
        "Marina: All of the stories that you've told us are connected.",
        "Marah: Wait a minute. Something is off here because my father would never be involved in drugs.",
        "Carrie: Josh didn't want to do it. But Alan can be very, very persuasive.",
        "Alan: All we have to do is put this in a glass of beer, get her to drink it, and voila, Miss Icicle turns into Miss Behaved of 1977.",
        "Josh: Forget it, Alan, no way.",
        "Ed: Absolutely no way",
        "Alan: Come on. It will be fun.",
        "Ed: Fun? Putting the moral issue aside...",
        "Billy: What? The moral issue? Listen to Mr. Self-Righteous, here.",
        "Ed: That's an anesthetic. You give someone too much of that thing and you're playing with fire.",
        "Buzz: If this chick is an icicle with you, then your doing something wrong. I've never needed a drug to get a girl's attention. I'm going to try my hand at a couple of those games.",
        "Josh: Right behind you, Buzz.",
        "Alan: Billy, I didn't hear you condemn my idea just now.",
        "Billy: I'm always up for a little fun, as long as no one gets hurt.",
        "Alan: Go talk to her. Maryanne. Ask her to go on a ride with you then invite her back here for a beer.",
        "Billy: All right. As long as that chick is the only one you slip a mickey to. Don't go doping up my brother's beer, Alan.",
        "Alan: This is just for Maryanne, Billy, trust me.",
        "Billy: Trust you. Famous last words, Alan.",
        "Alan: It wasn't my problem if the girl couldn't hold her liquor.",
        "Ed: For the love... Are you still denying what you did after all these years?",
        "Buzz: You knew what the junk would do to her.",
        "Josh: We all knew. None of us was completely innocent that night. Let's face it.",
        "Carrie: It's true. Everyone knew what would happen when Maryanne came back to the table, but no one, no one lifted a finger to stop it.",
        "Billy: So that's what it was. That's what the smell in the car was. Boys, I'd like y'all to meet Maryanne. Say hello, Sugar.",
        "Maryanne: Hello, Sugar?",
        "Carrie: Those young men all knew what Alan wanted that night and deep down in some dark secret place in their hearts, they wanted the same thing. They wanted her. Have had you a change of heart, ladies? Shall will stop?",
        "Marah: I wish you had never started.",
        "Marina: I don't suppose this thing has a happy ending.",
        "Michelle: Not likely. But we've come this far and there is no going back. So go on, finish it.",
        "Marah: Yeah,",
        "Marina: Just finish it.",
        "Carrie: All right. Now, where was I? Yes. A bit of time passed. They laughed, they drank some more beer, and then Maryanne left the fairgrounds with the five young men. It all looked perfectly harmless.",
        "Alan: That drug was harmless. The FDA approved it, for God's sake.",
        "Ed: It was approved as an anesthetic, not a date drug.",
        "Billy: You put it in the beer, so we all drank it. Even after you promised me.",
        "Josh: What did you say? He promised you something? You knew beforehand what he was planning to do?",
        "Billy: No, not like that. Alan told me he just wanted to have some fun, get her a little high, maybe a little too high, get her to embarrass herself and we were are going to send her home with a big old headache.",
        "Ed: Your intentions were completely innocent, right?",
        "Billy: No, they weren't. But were Alan and I planning on setting the girl up so we could have our way with in the back seat with her? That's not true.",
        "Josh: Is that what you have been telling yourself all these years? Is that how you sleep at night.",
        "Billy: I sleep just fine. You know why? Because I saved your life that night, Josh. That's why I sleep fine. Or have you forgotten that?",
        "Josh: No, I haven't forgotten anything.",
        "(Laughter)",
        "(Car accelerating)",
        "_Billy: Maryanne, have another beer. _",
        "Maryanne: Is it getting hot in here or is it just me?",
        "Boys: It's just you.",
        "Carrie: It's true what they said about Maryanne. She loved to party. She could be very reckless, but she never, never thought anyone would drug her.",
        "Alan: Don't make Maryanne Caruthers out to be so innocent. I could tell you some stories about her, and after all, she was drinking our beer that night wasn't she? She loved the attention we gave her. She flirted with every one of us and knew full well when she got in the car with all five of us, we lusted after her.",
        "Josh: Speak for yourself.",
        "Buzz: Like you were thinking of Reva the whole time?",
        "Ed: We weren't thinking. Period.",
        "Buzz: I remember she asked to you slow down.",
        "Alan: Relax. I know this road like the back of my hand.",
        "Alan: I wasn't going that fast. I knew the road like the back of my hand.",
        "Maryanne: Please take me home. Please, you guys.",
        "Ed: She thought we were taking her home.",
        "Alan: Soon. Relax.",
        "Alan: She wasn't naive. She knew we were out for a good time.",
        "Alan: Relax.",
        "Maryanne: No, I want to go home. I want to go home now.",
        "Josh: The fog was getting heavier. God, it was hot in that car.",
        "Buzz: Maryanne started to pass out.",
        "_Buzz: Alan, Alan, stop the car. _",
        "Ed: She needs a doctor.",
        "Ed: She needed a doctor.",
        "Alan: Who, you?",
        "Alan: Who you?",
        "Billy: What the hell were you thinking?",
        "Ed: Slow down. You have to stop the car.",
        "(Voices of Protest)",
        "Josh: You were heading straight for the bridge.",
        "Ed: Way too fast.",
        "Carrie: There was something in the road, a deer, a tree branch down.",
        "Josh: I thought I saw Maryanne grab the wheel.",
        "Billy: I swear I heard the tire blow out.",
        "Ed: I thought the bridge was out. What the hell was it?",
        "Buzz: Oh, bull! Alan just lost control.",
        "Alan: That's a lie, it wasn't me.",
        "Carrie: Perhaps it was just fate.",
        "Jeffrey: Reva? Reva? You drifted off.",
        "Reva: No. No, this was way too real to be a dream.",
        "Jeffrey: What was? What was?",
        "Reva: Shayne was drowning.",
        "Jeffrey: Looks like he's fine. Seems to be resting. Do you want to check to be sure?",
        "Reva: No, I don't want to wake him. Why would I see water and someone going under? I don't understand.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you had that in your hand when it happened. I didn't fell enthusiasm before, but that plate was taken from a car that was found at the bottom of a river. It had been there for over 30 years and we have no idea how it got there.",
        "Reva: So someone was drowning, but not Shayne. Who was it?",
        "Carrie: The car drove full speed ahead off Cutter's Bridge into the river below. The riff was very deep and the current was very swift, in seconds the water was up to the windows.",
        "Buzz: Somehow I managed to get the passenger door open. Don't ask me how. Leave no one behind. Leave no one behind. They drill it into you. Leave no one behind.",
        "Billy: Josh!",
        "Billy: I kept shouting for you, Josh. My lungs were about to burst.",
        "Ed: My lungs were about to burst, if you hadn't pulled me up when you did",
        "Buzz: You would you have done the same thing for me.",
        "Josh: Thank God you found me, Billy, thank God.",
        "Buzz:: Has anyone seen Alan?",
        "Josh: What about the girl?",
        "Buzz: I'm going back in.",
        "Billy: Me, too.",
        "Alan: The water is pitch black. I dove in again and looked and looked. The current is too strong. The car is way down there now. It's deep.",
        "Billy: Did you see her? Did you catch a glimpse of her or something?",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Billy: Come on!",
        "Alan: Be careful. The current will pull you under.",
        "Buzz: You were right, Alan. The car had drifted way downstream and the current....",
        "Billy: Lord only knows where it took her. We looked and looked until we nearly drowned ourselves. We couldn't find her anywhere. It's like she just disappeared.",
        "Ed: At that moment, it's always haunted me, God help me, I couldn't remember her name.",
        "Buzz: Maybe that's why no one said it.",
        "Alan: There was nothing to say.",
        "Josh: Yes, there was. She had a name. Her name was --",
        "Carrie: Maryanne.",
        "Jeffrey: Here. Reva, I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: It's alright.",
        "Jeffrey: No, it's not alright, ok? You have enough to deal with without me trying to pump you for information about something that happened thirty years ago. It was probably nothing anyway. Just somebody decided to dump a car in the river",
        "Reva: You must have had a hunch or you wouldn't have brought me this.",
        "Jeffrey: My hunches have been wrong.",
        "Reva: When?",
        "Jeffrey: About as often as yours. Listen, I've got to go. I've got a deposition to take. So I will see you later.",
        "Reva: Jeffrey, wait! Joshua.",
        "Josh: Billy. I'm sorry about what I said earlier. You saved my life.",
        "Billy: I just wish I could have saved her life.",
        "Buzz: We all do, Billy.",
        "Josh: The question is: what do we do now?",
        "Alan: One thing we don't do, we don't cave in. We stick to our guns.",
        "Ed: Come on, Alan. The girls aren't going to stop asking questions.",
        "Alan: Let them ask. Maryanne's family is gone! No one is here to answer them. If we stick to our guns, no one will answer them.",
        "Billy: If there is nobody left to care, who is putting Maryanne's name in the girls heads?",
        "Buzz: How could anyone else know about this?",
        "Josh: Well, obviously, somebody thinks they know something.",
        "Alan: Well, something we have to do is keep an eye on all three of the girls, know where they are at all times, who they're talking to.",
        "Ed: What are you asking us to do, spy on our own children?",
        "Alan: Do have you have a better idea? If we keep our eye on them, maybe they can lead us to the person who is stirring all this up.",
        "Carrie: That's enough for one day. Now you know why your fathers have kept that secret all those years. Could I have the rings, please? Well, don't tell me you think I made this all up.",
        "Michelle: There's one thing I don't understand. You said that our fathers and Buzz and Billy and Alan were the only ones there. How do you know what happened?",
        "Carrie: Because they weren't the only ones there. There was a witness. Someone on the river bank who saw it all. Someone who was too frightened to run, someone who saw everything.",
        "Alan: So we all agree on our story. We never knew anyone named Maryanne Caruthers.",
        "Alan: My car was stolen. That's what I told Gus. I have no idea what happened to it after that.",
        "Alan: I have no idea what happened to it after that.",
        "Billy: Alan's right. We tried to save her. Now we got to think about saving ourselves. Because if this gets out, our lives will be over, too.",
        "Billy: Josh, are you okay?",
        "Ed: No, he's not okay. None of us are.",
        "Buzz: Alan's right. We made a decision. We have to stick to it. We have to keep this buried.",
        "Alan: Forever. \u0091Til death do us part.",
        "Alan: \u0091Til death do us part.",
        "Carrie: That's the trouble with the truth. It doesn't always set you free.",
        "Alan: Next on Guiding Light",
        "Michelle: We're all thinking the same thing, right?",
        "Marah: That we have to go through with this.",
        "Marina: No matter where it leads or what it costs?",
        "Michelle: We're in too deep. We have no other choice.",
        "Buzz: Someone out there is putting this stuff in your head. I want to know who it is.",
        "Marina: You're not going to answer my questions.",
        "Buzz: They're taking advantage of your heart, your wonderful, huge heart. It's not fair to you. It's not fair to who you are.",
        "Michelle: Do we really have to do this?",
        "Ed: Know everything about what?",
        "Michelle: October 1977, the fair, the woman, the accident!"
