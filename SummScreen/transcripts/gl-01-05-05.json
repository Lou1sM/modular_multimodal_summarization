        "Michelle: Come on, Danny. Danny? Danny? Hey! Listen to me. Danny, you cannot come all this way and die on me, okay? Come on, Danny. What am I going to tell Robbie, huh? You've got to think about your son. You've got to think about Robbie. That little kid thinks you're a hero, and he's not wrong, okay? You are, you're a hero. You've survived that plane crash, Danny. Come on, you can survive now. What good is medical training if I can't get through these bars? Danny?",
        "Danny: If I'm dead, don't tell me, okay?",
        "Michelle: You're not dead. You're not dead. Hey, you're alive. You're alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maurice: What am I forgetting? The bride. Goodness gracious, people, where is my bride?",
        "Reva: Don't worry. She'll be here.",
        "Josh: You know he does have a point. Where is Cassie? She should be here by now.",
        "Reva: And you know what? You are the best man. You're supposed to have nerves of steel.",
        "Josh: My nerves are just fine. You're the one that told me she was throwing them down last night.",
        "Reva: Well, yeah, I kept telling here to go easy on that. Because I knew that if she drank too much she was cave in on that \"do not see the groom\" thing before the wedding thing.",
        "Josh: Ah. So you think she and Edmund are having a little bit of early honeymoon right now? Is that it?",
        "Reva: That, or she's in bed with another man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Mm... Edmund.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hello, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Where's Mrs. Winslow?",
        "Bellboy: Excuse me, sir?",
        "Edmund: I received a call saying I needed to be at the Beacon immediately. Is she all right?",
        "Dinah: She is all right, as far as I know. I'm the one who left the message.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, today is my wedding day. I don't have time for neurotic games. Forgive me and excuse me.",
        "Dinah: There is nothing neurotic or petty about what I have to say. Before you walk down the aisle...",
        "Edmund: Dinah...",
        "Dinah: ...There is something you should know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Oh, God, what did I do? Hey, sleepyhead. Don't you know that it's bad luck to be with me before... who cares? Why don't you give me some more bad luck?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, man, you're insatiable. You want to go again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Ow! Ow!",
        "Michelle: Hey.",
        "Danny: Okay, I got it. I got it. I got it.",
        "Michelle: Careful. How do you feel? Huh?",
        "Danny: Oh, like I've been run over by a truck. But I think I'll live.",
        "Michelle: When I heard that plane fall out of the sky, I thought I was never going to see you again. And then Sebastian said he found your body.",
        "Danny: My what?",
        "Michelle: He... Sebastian went to where the plane crash was. He said that you were dead.",
        "Danny: He must have had somebody mess with my plane. Where is he?",
        "Michelle: He took Holly to check out the plane crash. You've got to get out of here, Danny. If he comes back here...",
        "Danny: I know. I'm not going to...",
        "Michelle: Listen to me.",
        "Danny: Hey, Michelle, I didn't come here...",
        "Michelle: If he comes back here and he sees you, he will kill you.",
        "Danny: I did not come all this way to leave you here.",
        "Michelle: Danny, Sebastian is very violent. He is unpredictable, okay? And his illness is getting worse by the hour. You have to get out of here, please. Okay? I don't want to lose you.",
        "Danny: Why, Michelle?",
        "Michelle: Why? What do you mean? Just do as I say.",
        "Danny: No, I don't want to lose me. I mean, is my life really that important to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I thought you said you were a master criminal.",
        "Sandy: No, I said smooth criminal. Smooth criminals don't have to pry open windows.",
        "Tammy: So how do they break into locked houses?",
        "Sandy: Smooth criminals charm their way in or they cut those little circles in the glass.",
        "Tammy: (Laughs) No offense, you are so not smooth.",
        "Sandy: I'm not the one who forgot my key.",
        "Tammy: I thought Mom or Edmund would be here.",
        "Sandy: Aha. Can you say \"to the rescue\"? You want to? Okay. No problem. I got it. (Tammy laughs) I'm on it. I'm not it. It's not a problem... I'm really... oh. (Tammy laughs) I'm good. Not a problem.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry.",
        "Sandy: Sorry. It's okay. It's good to see you laughing.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, well, I always have fun with you.",
        "Sandy: Yeah?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Sandy: Well, maybe... just maybe I'm finally getting through.",
        "Tammy: Getting through what?",
        "Sandy: Through whatever.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, you have. A teensy-weensy little bit.",
        "Sandy: Just a teensy... I'll take what I can get. (Tammy laughs) Cool. See there's two in a row. Ha.",
        "Tammy: Well, must be true what they say about weddings. All that romance is contagious.",
        "Sandy: Contagious?",
        "Tammy: You do feel warm.",
        "Sandy: So do you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Would you stop?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: I'm going to stick you.",
        "Josh: Ow!",
        "Reva: Do you have the rings?",
        "Josh: Yes, the rings are right here. No problems.",
        "Reva: You just seem so jumpy.",
        "Josh: I'm just trying to keep an eye on things.",
        "Reva: Well, don't worry. Jonathan's not going to show up here.",
        "Josh: We'll see.",
        "Reva: He's not a glutton for punishment. You and Edmund and Cassie and me too made him know that he was not invited.",
        "Josh: Yeah, we all know how well he follows direction.",
        "Reva: He has feelings, Joshua. And when I told him he was invited to the wedding, I know he pretended like he didn't care, but I know he did.",
        "Josh: I don't understand him. I'm supposed to feel guilty about that? Or what's the deal here?",
        "Reva: That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Josh: Do you want him to be here?",
        "Reva: I just want him to feel like he's a part of this family, okay? That he's accepted. I just... it's going to take time I know for everyone to forgive him.",
        "Josh: Long time, yeah.",
        "Reva: Hey, Mr. D.A.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey.",
        "Reva: Come here. Will you tell my husband to ease up?",
        "Jeffrey: Ease up, Josh.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) And will you tell him too that nothing is going to happen to spoil Cassie's big day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Edmund, I just... I wanted to wish you the very best.",
        "Edmund: And?",
        "Dinah: And congratulations and long life. I would have bought you a present but I'm sure Cassie would have junked it.",
        "Edmund: And you said there was something I needed to know.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Than no matter how I feel about Cassie, I want you to be really happy. You were my first friend that I ever had when I got to Springfield. And I do hope I've been a friend to you.",
        "Edmund: Good, Dinah. Think whatever you'd like.",
        "Dinah: Hey, hey. We know lots of things about one another, things that no one ever has to know. I mean we share secrets that will always be ours. And I want you and Cassie to have a glorious wedding day.",
        "Edmund: Thank you, Dinah. Really, I'm sorry. And thank you. And I hope to be wishing you well on your wedding day when you marry someone you genuinely love.",
        "Dinah: That's very nice. That's the nicest thing I've heard in a long time. (Laughs) You know what? If I was the bride, I would so be breaking all the rules right now.",
        "Edmund: Rules?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, that silly superstition about not seeing your fianc\u00e9e before the wedding night. I would want him one last time before the vows.",
        "Edmund: Would you?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. But then again, I have absolutely no willpower. And I am so into instant gratification. You on the other hand, you are much stronger than I am. You have a great day, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I'm going to call security.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, call Uncle Eddie, too, while you're at it. I'm sure he'll understand. What's a bachelorette party without the bachelor?",
        "Cassie: This wasn't supposed to happen. Reva was supposed to be here at 12:15. She said she'd be here at 12:15.",
        "Jonathan: Well, it's a good thing she didn't come. It would have spoiled all the fun.",
        "Cassie: Why can't I remember? No, this didn't happen. This didn't happen. I let you in... Why can't I remember? And you... you drugged me.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I guess I had the key to your room, too. Did I get that before or after I slipped you the drugs?",
        "Cassie: Get out!",
        "Jonathan: Hey, it's not my fault you undid my belt, pulled down my pants...",
        "Cassie: Get the hell out!",
        "Jonathan: Pull me down on the bed and had your way with me. Hey, I don't mind being used. It was for a good cause.",
        "Cassie: It didn't happen. You drugged me, you took off my clothes, and you set me up.",
        "Jonathan: Oh. I have the invitation you gave me right here, in your handwriting. You poured that wine last night; you started stripping like an old pro. I mean, what's a man to do?",
        "Cassie: You didn't do anything.",
        "Jonathan: You're right. You were so busy, I didn't have a chance to reciprocate.",
        "Cassie: Get the hell out of here or I'll kill you.",
        "Jonathan: No, you already killed me last night. I was just a kid. But your passion killed me. I was just a kid making love with kids, but now I'm a man. I'm going to need so much more. Do you think I'm ruined? I guess that's a yes, a big yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Look, you're important to me, okay? You're the father of my son. And we shared a lot of years together... even if I don't remember most of them.",
        "Danny: Well, that's not really an answer to my question. But...",
        "Michelle: Well... you know, we don't have time to talk about feelings right now, okay? You have to get out of here, Sebastian's coming back.",
        "Danny: Michelle, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Michelle: All right, look. Let me ask you a question then.",
        "Danny: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: Why did you risk your life to come here?",
        "Danny: Because, Michelle, you are Robbie's mother, and because we have shared many years together, and I do remember them, and... I don't know. No matter what's happened between us, I would never leave you here.",
        "Holly: (Screaming)",
        "Sebastian: Well, well, well, look what just crawled out of the jungle. Did you have a nice flight, Danny boy?",
        "Danny: It was a little bumpy after the engines conked out.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, it's funny how things turn out, huh? Well, you did it. You found your damsel in distress. Congratulations. Now say good-bye. (Car honks)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Oh, they're delivering the flowers. I have got to get dressed. And so do you.",
        "Sandy: We do?",
        "Tammy: Well, it is a wedding. Hello?",
        "Sandy: In a barn, hello? Doesn't that change the dress code a little?",
        "Tammy: That barn means a lot to my mother, to all of us. We could have lost everything when it caught on fire. But we didn't. The barn is still standing. And so is our family.",
        "Sandy: Well, I don't care what you say, Tammy, I think the barn's a cool place for a wedding.",
        "Tammy: Hmm. Well, it's different from her last wedding, that's for sure. I mean the last time she got married it was in a palace. There were bugles and guys in uniform and a bishop with a big hat. But this time, you know, what she wants with Edmund, it's something more. I don't know.",
        "Sandy: Real? She wants something more real?",
        "Tammy: That's what I want, too.",
        "Sandy: Some people want more.",
        "Tammy: Not me.",
        "Sandy: Not you?",
        "Tammy: I know a good thing when I see it you have to get dressed, huh?",
        "Sandy: Mm...",
        "Tammy: You do have a suit, right?",
        "Sandy: I...",
        "Tammy: Sandy.",
        "Sandy: Don't worry. I won't let you down.",
        "Tammy: That is the one thing I'm sure of these days.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Why would anyone want to do anything to spoil Cassie's big day?",
        "Josh: Well, there are just a few people in this town who would love that this wedding never took place.",
        "Reva: Hey. Okay. I don't think there's any need to get the DA involved in this. Can we all just relax, have a good time, okay? Okay.",
        "Josh: Sure. Fine. I'm going to see if I can track down Edmund. I'll be right back.",
        "Reva: Okay. What's eating you?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we've always been on the level with each other, right?",
        "Reva: Well, you have that half-right. I've always been on the level with you.",
        "Jeffrey: Fair enough. I just... you know, I know how hard Cassie has had it in her life. RJ's father was shot, Prince Richard is dead. I mean she deserves another shot at happiness. And I know that she wants this marriage to work, but...",
        "Reva: But you have your doubts about Edmund.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't?",
        "Reva: Well, he isn't the man I would have chosen for my sister. But all the other choices have maybe this one will start wrong and end right.",
        "Jeffrey: Or maybe Cassie deserves something better than that.",
        "Reva: Do you care about my sister?",
        "Jeffrey: Care?",
        "Reva: Yeah, because if you do, you need to put aside your doubts and let her have this day. This is what she wants, Jeffrey. And if anyone deserves happiness, it's her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Why are you still here?",
        "Jonathan: Chill. I'm going.",
        "Cassie: Put your shirt on.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Cassie, don't be embarrassed. Look, every bride deserves one last encounter of the bad kind.",
        "Cassie: Nothing happened.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever you say. And I just want to say thank you for the good time.",
        "Cassie: What did you do to me? What did you do to me?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing that you didn't want me to do... a couple times.",
        "Cassie: You sick twisted liar! You liar!",
        "Jonathan: Cassie! Cassie! Why don't you save that energy for the walk down the aisle? Look, whatever happened in this bed last night, okay, that's between me and you. I'm nothing if not discreet. (Knock at the door)",
        "Edmund: Cassie, it's me. Let's forget about superstition and open that door, all right? I have to see you. Cassie, everything all right in there?",
        "Cassie: Edmund? You've got to go away. You're not supposed to see me.",
        "Edmund: Oh, come on. Where's the romance in that? All right, look, how about just at least one kiss before I go?",
        "Cassie: Get out of here.",
        "Jonathan: All right. I'm a sucker for weddings. You're going to make a beautiful bride. Trust me.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, are you alone in there?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Edmund: Hi. May I come in? Is everything all right?",
        "Cassie: It's just so nice to see your face.",
        "Edmund: Well, you could see more of me if you let me in.",
        "Cassie: No, just one kiss. That's all.",
        "Edmund: All right. If that's what you want.",
        "Cassie: I love you. Okay, no matter what happens, you just know that I love you.",
        "Edmund: No matter what happens? What are you leaving the country or something? Hey, hey, Cassie, Cassie. You know, whatever this is, I'm never letting you spend another night without me.",
        "Cassie: It's all my fault. Edmund, it's all my fault.",
        "Edmund: Well, I could have told you that. I offered to stay with you, but...",
        "Cassie: I was just... trying to fix things, you know? I was just trying to prove a point.",
        "Edmund: Well, you proved it. You did, because if anything, I want you now more than ever.",
        "Cassie: You don't understand. Sometimes I do things, sometimes I jump into things without thinking, but I had it all planned, you know? Reva was supposed to show up here, and...",
        "Edmund: Oh, I'm sorry, Cassie. The girls' night didn't work out?",
        "Cassie: No, this is so serious, Edmund. Everything has changed after last night.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, have you changed your mind about marrying me?",
        "Cassie: No. Edmund, I love you so much. I want to marry you more than anything.",
        "Edmund: Then that's... that's the only thing I need to know. I just... listen, you go back to your thoughts. I just had to see your face.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, listen...",
        "Edmund: You are the most beautiful woman I have ever known, and today my life begins because of you and everything you are. And the next time I see you, I'll be putting a ring on your finger. Love you.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Is that a cop?",
        "Josh: Yeah. I hired him to patrol the grounds.",
        "Reva: Seriously?",
        "Josh: Of course seriously. I'm the best man. I can't be watching the door at the same time.",
        "Reva: And what? You'll have my son arrested if he shows up here?",
        "Josh: You said he won't. What are you worried about, Reva? Unless, of course, you don't trust his word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Good morning.",
        "Jonathan: Yes, it is. Dinah, right?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Would you like to join me for a drink?",
        "Jonathan: I would like to join you for two. What's the occasion?",
        "Dinah: Ooh. As if you don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Raphael? Will you see that that limo is waiting for Cassie when she comes downstairs?",
        "Bellhop: I will sir, and good luck.",
        "Edmund: Thank you, Raphael. But I already feel the luckiest man in the world.",
        "Dinah: Why is he smiling?",
        "Jonathan: Well, he's about to marry a gorgeous, sexy woman. I think I'd be smiling, too. I am smiling.",
        "Dinah: What happened up there?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I assume that Edmund saw the bride before the wedding, and you know what that means, right? Bad luck.",
        "Dinah: What kind of game are you playing?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, I'm playing the same one you are, sweetheart. Only I'm playing it to win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: This is the disease talking. This is not who you are.",
        "Sebastian: I don't know who the hell I am anymore, Holly. I don't know what the hell I'm doing. But I do know I did not invite this hero to come here and he needs to go!",
        "Michelle: No, wait! Sebastian, wait. Danny came alone, okay? Which means Tony is in Africa. He's getting you the cure.",
        "Sebastian: No. Danny wanted to be the white knight in shining armor. That's why he came here alone. Isn't that right, Danny, huh? I'm so sorry that you made a wasted trip. (Telephone ringing)",
        "Holly: Answer it!",
        "Sebastian: I don't care about the damned phone.",
        "Michelle: Come on Sebastian, answer the phone.",
        "Tony: Hello? Sebastian? Hello? Sebastian? Do you hear me? Listen, I made it. I am at Ed Bauer's but he's not here, but I found what you need. Is anybody there? Sebastian, pick up. I need to know if Michelle is all right.",
        "Sebastian: Where is he?",
        "Danny: He's in Africa.",
        "Sebastian: I may be sick but I'm not stupid. Now, where is he?",
        "Danny: Tony's in Africa, Sebastian. He's getting you what you need.",
        "Holly: We can't lose this connection. It could be our last chance.",
        "Sebastian: \"Our?\"",
        "Holly: Talk to Tony. You've got to trust somebody.",
        "Sebastian: Okay.",
        "Holly: Tony, it's Holly.",
        "Tony: Holly. Hey, Holly. How are you doing? Is Michelle all right? Is she okay?",
        "Michelle: Tony! I'm right here. I'm all right.",
        "Tony: Oh, God, babe, it's good to hear your voice.",
        "Michelle: I'm so glad you got out. When Danny got here...",
        "Tony: Danny made it?",
        "Sebastian: Cut to the chase. Where's Ed Bauer?",
        "Tony: He's on a mission somewhere in the jungle, Sebastian. Look, I'm at his place right now. I found his research, okay?",
        "Sebastian: Well, what good will that do? You're not a doctor.",
        "Holly: Michelle. Michelle can figure it out.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I was my father's research assistant. I told you that. I can piece it together. Tony, can you figure out how to read it?",
        "Tony: Yeah, yeah. I'll try. Go ahead.",
        "Holly: Oh, it's almost over.",
        "Sebastian: Yes. It's almost over, one way or another.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Here is a toast. To signs which appear out of nowhere. (Glasses clink) Such as \"closed for repair,\" \"out of order,\" and \"do not disturb,\" my personal favorite.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) Oh, I bet that is.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah? At first I thought the sign was put on Cassie's door by a maid, but then I came down these stairs and saw you sitting here. I put it all together. You wanted me and Cassie to do our thing before Reva showed up and did hers.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I wanted her to do her thing before Edmund showed up. But obviously you crawled away.",
        "Jonathan: Well... (clears throat) after a night like last night, all I could do was crawl. (Laughs) Come here. Listen, lady, I did you a favor. If Edmund had showed and caught us, who do you think he would have shot? The messenger, that's who.",
        "Dinah: Maybe, after you.",
        "Jonathan: All the more reason to do it my way.",
        "Dinah: So your way would be making sure this wedding gets off without a hitch?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I could care less about the couple, Dinah-mite.",
        "Dinah: You don't care whether or not the couple rides off into the sunset?",
        "Jonathan: No. As far as I'm concerned, they probably deserve each other. I'm betting they don't even make it down the aisle, though. Cassie is a grenade loaded down with guilt and just ripe to go off. So all we have... that's right. That's right.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs)",
        "Jonathan: All we have to do is sit here, sip champagne and wait for the explosion. (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) okay, so it's not about Cassie or Edmund for you. That's cool. Look, I know what I want, but I've got a funny feeling you're after something entirely different. You have it out for your mama, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Do you have the rings?",
        "Reva: Josh has the rings.",
        "Josh: Yes. I've got the rings. They're right here.",
        "Edmund: Okay, good. Everything else?",
        "Josh: Everything else is fine, safe and secure.",
        "Edmund: Good, good. Ross.",
        "Josh: Ross will be here.",
        "Edmund: He's supposed to... good. Good.",
        "Josh: Edmund, you just have to slow down and breathe, okay? Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Edmund: Right.",
        "Josh: Yea",
        "Edmund: You're here early.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I am.",
        "Edmund: Mr. O'Neill, thank you for coming. We've had our differences, but I think we do have one thing in common: We both want Cassie to be happy.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I do.",
        "Josh: Edmund, the wedding coordinator was looking for you earlier. Why don't we go track him down?",
        "Edmund: Why?",
        "Josh: Excuse us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Where did I put those earrings? God, how could I be so stupid? I've got to find the earrings. I've got to find the earrings. I've got to find the earrings.",
        "Reva: Cassie? Honey? (Knocks on door)",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Reva: Hey. What are you doing in here? I've been trying to call you, sweetie, but... uh-oh.",
        "Cassie: Oh, Reva.",
        "Reva: What's going on? What happened? What is it, sweetie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: How long is this going to take?",
        "Michelle: I'm almost there.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah? Well, you'd better hope this works, because this island is like a fortress. Nobody leaves unless I say so. Do we understand each other? If I die here, you die with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Come on, now. Tell me. Tell me what happened.",
        "Cassie: I... I... I just... um, I can't find my earrings that I wanted to wear. You know those pretty ones I got from San Cristobel? I mean, I thought they could be \"something old.\"",
        "Reva: We'll find another pair.",
        "Cassie: It just won't be the same.",
        "Reva: Honey, it's not going to matter. So you don't wear earrings. Edmund's not going to care whether you're in a paper bag.",
        "Cassie: Oh, he's just been so solid, Reva. So dependable, you know? And the kids love him so much.",
        "Reva: Well, that's good, right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but what if I don't live up to his expectations? What if I disappoint him? You know, he treats me like I am so much better than everybody else, but I'm not. I'm not, Reva.",
        "Reva: Okay, now talk to me, because this isn't just about a pair of missing earrings.",
        "Cassie: Oh, God, Reva. Why didn't you show up last night?",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Cassie: I waited for you. You said that you would be there at 12:15.",
        "Reva: Cassie, I was there. I saw that big old sign on the door that said, \"do not disturb.\" I didn't want to interrupt you.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Oh, God. No. No. Now it makes sense.",
        "Reva: What? What makes sense? Don't tell me you were actually waiting for me.",
        "Cassie: No, I wasn't waiting. It was a mistake. What am I doing? What am I doing wearing this dress? Reva, what am I doing?",
        "Reva: Getting married, honey. You're getting married to the man you love. You know what? How would you like a nice glass of wine to calm your nerves?",
        "Cassie: Oh.",
        "Reva: If you're worried about uninvited guests, sweetie, don't be, because Josh has that all covered. He's got everything short of an armored tank. Dinah's not going to be there. Neither is Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever happened in this bed last night, okay, that's between me and you.",
        "Reva: Hey? You want some red wine?",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Reva: Oh, sweetie, you wait right here.",
        "Cassie: You know what you have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Do you care about my sister? Because Cassie deserves happiness more than anyone I know.",
        "Jeffrey: He'd better make you happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: No, you're wrong, boo. You don't know nothing about me.",
        "Dinah: Don't I? You didn't care about seducing Cassie any more than you care you cared about sleeping with her hot daughter. You just want to hurt anybody close to Reva.",
        "Jonathan: You sure about that?",
        "Dinah: Babycakes, I know what you're doing. I invented what you are doing.",
        "Jonathan: Then back off.",
        "Dinah: Why?",
        "Jonathan: Listen, lady, you need to accept the fact that I did you a favor, okay? And now you owe me one.",
        "Dinah: You're right. Because when this wedding falls apart, that cheap piece of trailer park trash will have no one to blame but herself, and Edmund will be all alone.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: To true love. (Glasses clink)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Has anyone seen Ross? And where's Cassie? I sent a limo for her an hour ago.",
        "Tammy: Maybe she's in the house.",
        "Sandy: We can go check.",
        "Josh: No. You know what? Everybody just settle down. Ross will be here, Cassie will be here. In fact, Reva's in the farmhouse right now taking care of everything.",
        "Edmund: Good. Good. Because I can't shake this feeling, Josh, that something is going terribly wrong.",
        "Reva: Cassie? Doctor's here. Glass of wine. Cassie? Cassie? Cassie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Next, on \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "Gus: I got you another bail hearing.",
        "Harley: Gus, thank you for all your help. Really. But you should get on with your life. You're just wasting your time with me.",
        "Reva: Joshua.",
        "Edmund: Is something wrong?",
        "Josh: What is it?",
        "Reva: It's Cassie. She's gone.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie? Okay. (Nervous laugh) You're starting to freak me out, here. What's wrong?",
        "Cassie: I can't marry Edmund."
