        "Jonathan: Hey, how long you going to keep me \r\nlocked up in here without setting bail? Bring on the judge! Or at least give me \r\nsomething sharp to scratch the days off with. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nJosh: Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: Hey, Uncle Josh. ",
        "Josh: What's going on? ",
        "Tammy: Don't ask, okay? ",
        "Josh: Okay, is there anything I can do?\r\n",
        "Tammy: That all depends. ",
        "Josh: Try me. ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan's still locked up in that \r\ncell and they won't even give him a hearing. I need help. ",
        "Josh: Tammy, I don't know what you think it I \r\ncan do, but uh... ",
        "Tammy: Maybe you can talk to my mom or to \r\nJeffrey. Maybe Frank Cooper. ",
        "Josh: Look, I want to be honest with you \r\nhere, okay? Even if I could think of some way to get Jonathan out, I'm just not \r\nsure that I would. In fact, right now, I'm kind of glad he's there. ",
        "Tammy: Good to see you, too. ",
        "Josh: No, no, no. Tammy, just wait a minute, \r\nokay? ",
        "Tammy: Why? I can see now that Aunt Reva is \r\nthe only one who really wants to help us. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nMel: Reva. ",
        "Reva: Oh, Mel, hey. ",
        "Mel: Hey. ",
        "Reva: You want some coffee? ",
        "Mel: No, I've had enough caffeine for today.\r\n",
        "Reva: Okay. ",
        "Mel: So, how are you? ",
        "Reva: Actually, I've been better. ",
        "Mel: You said you needed legal advice? \n",
        "Reva: Actually, I need more than just advice. \r\nI need a lawyer. Well, Jonathan, my son, needs a lawyer. ",
        "Mel: Ah, Jonathan. What's the charge? \n",
        "Reva: Arson. Yes, he was playing with \r\nmatches, but he never meant to start a fire, which resulted in an innocent woman \r\nbeing hurt. ",
        "Mel: Wait, wait. Somebody was hurt? \n",
        "Reva: I'm not saying that he's completely \r\ninnocent, but the problem is that they've kept him locked up for days without \r\neven a bail hearing. ",
        "Mel: No hearing? That's strange. Usually \r\nJeffrey likes to move things along. ",
        "Reva: I thought so. So you think you can help \r\nus? ",
        "Mel: Well, it sounds simple enough. I don't \r\nsee why not. ",
        "Reva: Great. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nOfficer: You've got ten minutes, Miss Winslow. ",
        "Tammy: Hi. ",
        "Officer: I'll be nearby if you need anything.\r\n",
        "Tammy: Thank you. ",
        "Jonathan: Hi. Give me some good news? \n",
        "Tammy: I wish I could. Nobody knows when \r\nyou're going to get a hearing. I've been doing everything I can. ",
        "Jonathan: No, you stay out of this; let Reva \r\nhandle it. Stay out of it. ",
        "Tammy: Whatever. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm serious. ",
        "Tammy: All right, you want to play tough guy? \r\nJust wait until you get out of here. Until then, cut the crap, Randall. \n",
        "Jonathan: Whoa. Look who's tough now. \n",
        "Tammy: I learn from the best. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. ",
        "Tammy: This is crazy. How can they keep you \r\nin here? ",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. The law's no match \r\nfor an angry mama and the guy who loves her. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Hi. ",
        "Cassie: Hi. ",
        "Jeffrey: What is that? ",
        "Cassie: Tammy's first spelling bee. She won. \r\n( Laughter ) ",
        "Jeffrey: Of course she did. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Always the smartest kid in her \r\nclass. How do you spell \"mistake\"? ",
        "Jeffrey: She is still pretty smart. She's \r\njust uh... well, she is in love. Speaking of which, you know, we've been \r\ndragging our heels with this bail hearing for Jonathan so you could talk to \r\nTammy without him around, but we can't hold it up anymore. We've got to send \r\nJonathan's case to the judge. ",
        "Cassie: But then the judge will set bail, and \r\nJonathan will be on the streets, and Jonathan and Tammy will be together. \n",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, they're adults, we can't \r\njust keep... ",
        "Cassie: I know. One more day. I know you can \r\ndo that. Please, just one more day. ",
        "Jeffrey: One more day? What, you think 24 \r\nhours is going to make a difference? ",
        "Cassie: Well, maybe today's the day that \r\nTammy will come to her senses and figure out how bad Jonathan really is for her. \r\nWho knows? ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nTammy: They really think they can keep us apart? ",
        "Jonathan: They have kept us apart so far.\r\n",
        "Tammy: The more time I spend away from you, \r\nthe more I want to be with you. So no matter what they do, they're just going to \r\nmake us stronger. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nRick: Hey, Josh. ",
        "Josh: Hello, Dr. Bauer, how are you? \n",
        "Rick: Good. How you doing? ",
        "Josh: The usual, I guess-- at least as far as \r\nthe usual goes in my life these days. ",
        "Rick: Meaning? ",
        "Josh: Well, I run into a member of my family, \r\nalienate them and then move on. ",
        "Rick: No, see, you're a peacemaker, Joshua. \r\nYou're a peacemaker. ",
        "Josh: Not anymore. ",
        "Rick: See, my brilliant wife and daughter \r\nhave taught me to nod and smile. It works, Josh, every single time. ",
        "Josh: Oh, great. I'll have to try that \r\nsomeday. Thank you. ",
        "Rick: You should. You should. ",
        "Josh: How are they, by the way? ",
        "Rick: Good. My wife's working double shifts \r\nstill, amazingly. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, and you are, too, right? \n",
        "Rick: Yeah, but see, she manages to do it and \r\nstill take a shower on a daily basis. Me, I don't believe in showers. It's \r\noverrated. But thankfully Leah is definitely her mother's daughter. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, she's away at school right now, \r\nright? ",
        "Rick: Yeah. ",
        "Josh: How's she doing? ",
        "Rick: She is doing great. She certainly \r\ndoesn't miss me very much. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, it's funny. That's the way it \r\nworks out. You think your kids are going to be the ones who are homesick, and \r\nthen it turns out that the parents are the ones that freak out. ",
        "Rick: How are Marah and Shayne doing? \n",
        "Josh: Good, thank you for asking. And I just \r\nran into Tammy. You know, she reminds me a lot of Marah a few years ago. \n",
        "Rick: How's she doing? Is she okay? I mean, I \r\nhaven't spoken to her since the whole wedding thing fell apart. It has got to be \r\nhard. It's weird. I just thought that Sandy and Tammy were perfect together.\r\n",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, you've got to be careful \r\nabout that perfect exterior kind of thing. I just think Tammy's going through a \r\nlot of changes right now. ",
        "Rick: Well, she's a strong kid, Josh. She'll \r\nbe fine. ",
        "Josh: I hope so. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nCassie: Jeffrey, please tell me that you can keep Jonathan behind bars just one \r\nmore day. ",
        "Jeffrey: Don't you think it's time we face \r\nreality? You know, keeping Jonathan behind bars away from Tammy is not going to \r\nbring her any closer to you. As a matter of fact, it's driving her further and \r\nfurther away. You can see that, can't you? ",
        "Cassie: I know, I know. I want my daughter \r\nback, Jeffrey, I do, but even more than that, I want her safe. So whatever it \r\ntakes, if that means that she hates me, but Jonathan stays behind bars, I can \r\nlive with that. ",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not so sure about that. \n",
        "Cassie: I am. ",
        "Jeffrey: I've got to get going. I'll see what \r\nI can do. ",
        "Cassie: Thank you. ",
        "Jeffrey: All right. I'll call you later.\r\n",
        "Cassie: You better. And, Jeffrey? I love you.\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: I love you, too. ",
        "Cassie: Everything is going to be fine. It \r\nhas to be. ",
        "Sandy: It will be. Trust me. ",
        "Cassie: Sandy? ",
        "Sandy: Sorry if I scared you. ",
        "Cassie: You didn't. What are you doing here?\r\n",
        "Sandy: I just wanted to talk for a minute. I \r\nwasn't trying to overhear, but when I walked up, I heard you and Jeffrey talking \r\nabout Jonathan and keeping him in jail. ",
        "Cassie: What about it? ",
        "Sandy: I couldn't agree with you more. And if \r\nyou give me a shot, who knows, maybe I could help. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nTammy: Whenever we're apart, I feel so empty, I can't even think. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, me, too. ( Coughing ) \n",
        "Tammy: Hey, are you sick? ",
        "Jonathan: It started last night, I think. I'm \r\nallergic to something around here, like being in jail. ( Coughs ) ",
        "Tammy: Hold on. I'll get you some water.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: ( Coughing ) Oh. ",
        "Reva: Hey, are you all right? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I'm fine, Tammy went to get \r\nme some water. She's over there. Hi. ",
        "Mel: Hi, Jonathan. ",
        "Reva: Mel is your new lawyer. ",
        "Mel: So I'm just going to need to hear your \r\nside of the story, and I'll find the D.A. and see why he's dragging his heels.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: I can save you the trouble, pretty \r\nlady. ",
        "Mel: Well, I'd rather get both sides of the \r\nstory so I can get a full picture. Chances are you being locked up this long is \r\njust a clerical error. ",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) Right. It's just a \r\nclerical error. ",
        "Tammy: You want to know why he's still in \r\nhere, Mel? It's because my mom and her boyfriend, the District Attorney, would \r\nlike to see him rot in here. If they had it their way, he would never get out of \r\nhere. ",
        "Mel: Why? Jeffrey O'Neill... there's got to \r\nbe a reason. Your mother... ",
        "Reva: That's not important. I mean, not now, \r\nanyway. The reason's not important. ",
        "Tammy: It is. ",
        "Reva: Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: You want to know why he's in here? \r\nIt's to keep him away from me. Because my mom thinks that these are stronger \r\nthan what we feel for each other. ",
        "Mel: Feel? ",
        "Jonathan: We're in love. ",
        "Mel: Reva... ",
        "Reva: Hmm? ",
        "Mel: Can I talk to you for a minute in \r\nprivate, please? ",
        "Reva: Sure. ",
        "Mel: Reva, I thought you said this was going \r\nto be a simple case. There's a lot going on here. ",
        "Reva: It's not as complicated as you might \r\nthink. ",
        "Mel: Reva, they're cousins. ",
        "Tammy: I hate this-- people looking at us \r\nlike we're freaks. ",
        "Jonathan: You better get used to it. \n",
        "Tammy: I thought Mel would understand. I mean \r\nshe's cool. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, give her a few minutes, maybe \r\nshe'll come through for us. ",
        "Reva: Cassie's only my half sister, Mel. It \r\nis not that big a deal. They didn't grow up together. It's not like they spent \r\nThanksgiving dinners together eyeballing each other across the table since they \r\nwere in grade school. They met and they fell in love. That's the bottom line. \r\nThey're in love. You of all people should know that love knows no boundaries, \r\nright, Mel. ",
        "Mel: You're comparing me and Rick to cousins \r\nwho are dating? ",
        "Reva: It's just that... people see it...\r\n",
        "Mel: Look, you know what? It's not my place \r\nto judge, but from what I'm seeing, Cassie isn't as progressive about this whole \r\nsituation as you are or else she wouldn't be trying so hard to keep them apart.\r\n",
        "Reva: Yeah, well it's going to take some time \r\ngetting used to, but we'll work it out. ",
        "Mel: I hope you do. I really do. But in the \r\nmeantime, I love you and I love Cassie, and I won't put myself in the middle of \r\nit. ",
        "Reva: No, I'm asking you to take this case.\r\n",
        "Mel: You're asking me to choose sides, and \r\nI'm sorry, I can't do that. Reva, I'm very sorry. Sorry, Tammy. ",
        "Jonathan: Come on, can I get one of those \r\nsorry's, too! ",
        "Reva: Well, that was fun, wasn't it? \n",
        "Jonathan: I guess it's back to the good old \r\nyellow pages, huh, Ma? ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nSandy: We both want the same thing, Cassie, Jonathan behind bars for a long \r\ntime. I don't want to see Tammy hurt any more than she already has been. And I \r\nknow I can help. ",
        "Cassie: Thank you, Sandy, but no. ",
        "Sandy: I know I'm responsible. Give me a \r\nchance to make up for it. Look, when Tammy found out about my ex-wife, she \r\nran... ",
        "Cassie: Not ex-wife. Not ex-wife, Sandy. She \r\nis still your wife. ",
        "Sandy: I thought the divorce had gone \r\nthrough. Even so, it is my fault for not telling her about my first marriage, \r\nand that's the biggest mistake of my life. And I pay for that every day without \r\nTammy. Don't get me wrong, I know that I lost her. But I just want to make up \r\nfor what I've done. ",
        "Cassie: I think what you want is, you want \r\nTammy back. ",
        "Sandy: There's nothing I'll ever want more. \r\nBut I'm not stupid. I know she has moved on, and I'm doing my best to accept \r\nthat. I've lost her, and maybe I deserve that. But you don't deserve to lose \r\nher, not to someone like Jonathan. She needs her family right now, even if I'm \r\nnot a part of it. ",
        "Cassie: Do you know that if Tammy knew I was \r\nworking with you on this or anything, that it would just tear us apart farther?\r\n",
        "Sandy: Please. Cassie, she doesn't... \n",
        "Cassie: No. Thank you for your concern, and \r\nthank you for coming by, but I think I have all of the people I need on my side \r\nright now. ",
        "Sandy: Thank you. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nJeffrey: Hey, boys and girls. ",
        "Reva: Jeffrey O\u2019Neill, you better set bail \r\nfor my son today. ",
        "Jeffrey: Take it easy, Reva. He's going to be \r\nout of here tonight. ",
        "Jonathan: It's about time. ",
        "Jeffrey: But there is one condition for bail.\r\n",
        "Reva: Fine. I promise I won't hurt you. How's \r\nthat? ",
        "Tammy: I don't. ",
        "Jonathan: What's the catch? ",
        "Jeffrey: That is if the people of Springfield \r\ndon't consider it too big a risk. ",
        "Jonathan: All right, come on. What do I have \r\nto do to get out of here? ",
        "Jeffrey: You have to graduate. ",
        "Jonathan: From? ",
        "Jeffrey: Anger management class. ",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) You've got to be kidding \r\nme. ",
        "Reva: Okay, no, it's done. Just say thank \r\nyou, Jeffrey. ",
        "Jeffrey: Don't thank me. As a matter of fact, \r\nit was Cassie who wanted you to be released. ",
        "Tammy: What? Mom told you to let him out?\r\n",
        "Jeffrey: She just wants you to be happy, \r\nTammy. That's all she wants. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nJosh: Get back to me as quick as you can, okay? Thank you. ",
        "Mel: Josh. ",
        "Josh: Mel, how're you doing? ",
        "Mel: Good question. ",
        "Josh: I just ran into your husband. \n",
        "Mel: Funny, I just ran into your... Reva.\r\n",
        "Josh: How is my Reva? ",
        "Mel: Fine, or completely out of her mind; I \r\nhaven't figured that out yet. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, if you ever figure that \r\nout, you let me know, okay? Can I buy you a cup of coffee? ",
        "Mel: No, I'm good. ",
        "Josh: Okay. ",
        "Mel: Josh, you're a sensible man. ",
        "Josh: I try to be. Just one please. \n",
        "Mel: I know that the world is changing very \r\nrapidly and that the rules and the standards... ",
        "Josh: Let me guess. Reva told you about Tammy \r\nand Jonathan, right? ",
        "Mel: Yeah. I wish I could understand. \n",
        "Josh: Actually, it's quite simple. Thank you \r\nvery much. ",
        "Mel: Really? ",
        "Josh: Yeah. Jonathan and Tammy love each \r\nother. ",
        "Mel: I feel bad. I think Reva expected me to \r\nbe a little more understanding because Rick and I went through some questions \r\nwhen we first fell in love, but I told them I couldn't help them. I feel really \r\nbad. ",
        "Josh: You know what? You shouldn't. Reva's \r\ntrying desperately to get people to understand something I think is really \r\ndifficult to understand. The bottom line is she is trying to help her son, but \r\nher son makes that difficult for everybody. ",
        "Mel: I need to find Rick. ",
        "Josh: I think he went that way. ",
        "Mel: Okay. Thanks. I'll track him down.\r\n",
        "( Cell phone rings ) ",
        "Rick: Hello? ",
        "Mel: Rick, hi. I thought you were grabbing a \r\nbite to eat at Co2. ",
        "Rick: I did. I ate, I ran into Josh, and I \r\nheaded over here. Actually, I'm in the... ",
        "Mel: You're at the morgue. I know, your voice \r\nechoes when you're in there. ",
        "Rick: You're amazingly intuitive. ",
        "Mel: Is that why you married me? ",
        "Rick: Is that a trick question? ",
        "Mel: Yeah, I'm a little freaked out. I just \r\nsaw Reva, and she wanted me to help her with her son and Tammy. Honey, did you \r\nknow that... ",
        "Rick: Honey, can we discuss this later? I'm \r\nwith this dead guy, and we want to wrap this up so I can get home and have some \r\ndinner. So I'll see you there. Love you. Don't change. ",
        "Mel: What was that? ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nTammy: Mom. Oh, thank you. You don't know how happy you've made me. I'm so \r\ngrateful. And I've missed you so much. So much. ",

        "\nKim Zimmer and Robert Newman, \r\ninside \"The Light.\" ",
        "I think being part of the show is \r\nan extraordinary thing. ",
        "It's almost like an heirloom.\r\n",
        "See Josh and Reva on Wednesday, \r\nJanuary 11th, inside \"the light.\" ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nCassie: Honey, I've missed you, too. ",
        "Tammy: I knew in the end you'd be there for \r\nme, for us. ",
        "Cassie: For us? ",
        "Tammy: I knew you'd come around and see what \r\nI really need, Mom. And I need Jonathan. I need you, too. I need you both.\r\n",

        "\r\nSandy: Somebody has to believe me. I just want to help Tammy any way I can.\r\n",
        "Josh: Why did I think coming down here to \r\ntake a nice, quiet walk to clear my head was a good idea? ",
        "Sandy: Josh, I know you're mad at me. \n",
        "Josh: Yes, I am. ",
        "Sandy: But I thought that of all people, you \r\nwould understand that life is complicated. You and Reva have... ",
        "Josh: Yeah, I know, me and Reva, we've been \r\nthrough all the complications that life has to offer, but, Sandy, life does not \r\nalways have to be dramatic and complicated. Take the situation you're involved \r\nin right now, for example. There's an easy answer: Cut your losses and move on!\r\n",
        "Sandy: I can't do that. I have to help Tammy. \r\nI need her forgiveness. ",
        "Josh: I'm sure Tammy will forgive you one \r\nday. You know, she's a compassionate young lady. ",
        "Sandy: She's so many wonderful things, Josh.\r\n",
        "Josh: Sandy, let Tammy go. Move on with your \r\nlife, okay? You're young; it's not too late to start over. ",

        "Rick: All right, honey, you win. Okay, what \r\nis it? What do you want to talk about? ",
        "Mel: Well, I just came from Reva. She wanted \r\nme to take a case for her son and Tammy. ",
        "Rick: Jonathan and Tammy. Yeah, I heard \r\nsomething about that. No wonder Josh was so rattled. ",
        "Mel: Reva compared us to Jonathan and Tammy.\r\n",
        "Rick: Oh, please, that's ridiculous. We're \r\nnot related. I mean, we had our own obstacles, but certainly nothing like that.\r\n",
        "Mel: We're not cousins. Hello! ",
        "Rick: No, that's their family. We overcame \r\nour own obstacles, didn't we? We did, look at us. I mean, here we are in this \r\nmorgue, right? Two highly qualified professionals with a fantastic marriage. We \r\nshowed all of them. ",
        "Mel: Showed them what? ",
        "Rick: We showed them with the whole us \r\nagainst the world thing. You know, that credo holds true. It definitely does. I \r\nmean, it definitely brings people closer together. ",

        "Reva: So what did I miss? ",
        "Jonathan: Come on, admit it. You, Cassie, \r\nSandy, Josh would love to see me get out of here and torch a whole city block. \r\nThen you'll have enough to keep me here permanent. Go on, admit it. ",

What they feel for each other is so beyond logic \r\nand reason. Even if we tried to stop them, they would still find a way back to \r\neach other. Even if the entire world was against them.

Because I know you're going to mess \r\neverything up and give me the chance I've been waiting for. You see, that's how \r\nwe work. You lash out, and I sit back and relax. Every time you mess up, my life \r\ngets even better. Like the first time I came to Springfield, you messed up, fell \r\noff the side of a mountain.
