        "Josh, Billy, Ed, Alan and Buzz have renewed their promise to keep quiet about the accident thirty years ago and their cover up of Maryanne Caruthers's death. As they separate, each man tries to get back to his life. Alan questions Gus about the investigation into his car they pulled from the river. Buzz begins to sweat when Frank explains that they still hope to find evidence in the sunken wreck. Josh and Ed appear on the verge of cracking. Ed is finding it harder to perform his duties as a doctor. Only Billy can stem Josh's urge to come clean with his family.",
        "Meanwhile, Michelle, Marah and Marina reel from Carrie's own retelling of the story. They don't want to believe their fathers capable of letting that young women die and then covering it up. They realize, though, that they have to confront the men. The three young women tell their fathers/grandfather/uncle what they've learned about Maryanne's death. The reactions of the men are very different. Buzz seems compassionate and understanding as he denies the story. Josh is silent, while Billy chastises Marah for her lack of trust. Michelle pushes Ed, digs at him with questions, and refuses to be rebuffed. Finally a desperate Ed slaps his daughter across the face. In the aftermath of the slap, he's shaken to the core, but still keeps his secret. The women hand over envelopes to Josh, Billy, Buzz and Ed. Alan finds one intended for him, too. The men read the notes from Carrie, and realize this is a long way from over."

        "Alan: We've made it this far on the strength of an unshakeable oath. Each man made a promise on the river bank that terrible night to remain silent and take it to our grave. So it must be. _Consensus onum _.",
        "_Alan/Billy/Buzz/Josh/Ed: By the consensus of all. _",
        "Buzz: I hate it when he talks like that. All that's missing is black robes and a goat to sacrifice.",
        "Ed: It's serious, isn't it?",
        "Buzz: As if any of us needs reminding.",
        "_Alan: (Latin) Hic Et Num Ex Volto _",
        "_Alan/Billy/Buzz/Josh/Ed: Here and now, according to one's vow. _",
        "_Alan: (Latin) _",
        "_Alan/Billy/Buzz/Josh/Ed: Agreements must be kept. The outcome justifies the deed. _",
        "Alan: If any of you doubt that, look at our lives, each of us has prospered in his own way. Are any of you willing to have that taken from us?",
        "Buzz: Why don't we just tell the truth and throw it all away?",
        "_Alan: Let questions be asked, there are no answers if we remain silent. (Latin) _",
        "_Alan/Billy/Buzz/Josh/Ed: He who remains silent consents. _",
        "Alan: Maryanne Caruthers has no family left, no one can know what happened that night, not the police, not Marah, Marina nor Michelle. Whatever occurred after the car was stolen has nothing to do with us. We don't know anything about the girl, the bridge, the car, or anything else related to Maryanne Caruthers. Are you willing to risk your families, your futures, your good names? Beware of the guilty mind, gentlemen. Guilt is for the weak. We have to risk it all. For our families, our livelihood and ourselves. We stay together until the end.",
        "Josh: The end may be now.",
        "Billy: What are you mumbling out there?",
        "Josh: (Latin)",
        "Billy: What's that you said?",
        "Josh: It's Latin.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah, I thought Alan was the only one who was going to bore us with Latin. What does it mean?",
        "Josh: I have sinned.",
        "Marah: Are we talking about murder? If anything this was an accident.",
        "Carrie: An accident? Or reckless disregard for human life. There are men rotting in jail for less. We all know who caused this accident that resulted in death.",
        "Michelle: Look, we hear what you're saying, Carrie, it's just really hard to believe.",
        "Carrie: I know it's very hard to believe that these good citizens, your fathers and your grandfathers, could do anything like that. But Maryanne Caruthers is dead. She was prevented from living.",
        "Marina: Yeah, but, uh, how do we know that my grandfather didn't try to save her, or Josh or Billy or your dad? Michelle, your dad is a doctor, he's a good doctor...he wouldn't just let someone drown. And even Alan isn't that bad.",
        "Carrie: And all these good men have never said anything for 30 years. Now I wonder why that is.",
        "Marah: Maybe because it didn't happen the way you said it did.",
        "Carrie: It happened!",
        "Michelle: Even if we take your word for it, what are we supposed to do?",
        "Carrie: The choice is up to each of you, but be advised: I know how you love and admire these men who brought you up, but they have kept this secret for 30 years. I think you might think that they might have a great deal to lose.",
        "_Alan/Billy/Buzz/Josh/Ed: Slow down, Alan. Slow down, you can't even see. _ (Screaming).",
        "Alan: So we all agree on this story.",
        "Gus: Alan.",
        "Alan: Oh, Gus. You startled me.",
        "Gus: What's the matter with you, are you all right? Did you not get enough sleep?",
        "Alan: No, I'm getting five, four hours a night for the past 20 years. I will tell you something, though, there's something that's kept me up, thinking about that old Jaguar of mine that you found.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, the one you parked at the bottom of the river 30 years ago. Isn't that funny? I asked you about it and no reaction from you, and... but all of a sudden, all of a sudden you're interested.",
        "Alan: Well, I didn't want to let on at the time, but that was one of my favorite cars. Besides, when a detective starts to ask me questions, even if it is my son... I'm",
        "Gus: Yeah, apt to lie about it.",
        "Alan: No, just be cautious, that's all. All right. You caught me, I'm interested. Tell me, how did they find that car anyway? Was the person who stole it inside?",
        "Gus: Well, I don't know what you're hoping for, Alan, but the statute of limitations has expired under any kind of theft, you know? I mean, if there's something more to it like, uh, I don't know, like a murder or something, yeah, we could throw the book at somebody. I'll tell you what, I will get to the bottom of it for you, okay? Consider it one of the perks of having a cop in the family.",
        "(Screaming)",
        "Frank: Hi, Pop. I would have, uh, helped you close, but I got, uh, held up on a case, sorry.",
        "Buzz: Anything interesting?",
        "Frank: Well, if you like Spaulding mysteries.",
        "Buzz: Another one? Can't that family ever lead a normal life?",
        "Frank: I guess not, we just, uh, pulled a car that was licensed to Alan Spaulding out of the river.",
        "Buzz: Too bad he wasn't in it. Was he?",
        "Frank: Come on, Pop, that was over 30 years ago. You remember much about that back then?",
        "Buzz: Oh, Lord, why would I?",
        "Frank: That's right...You weren't around then, were you? Anyway, thought you would find it amusing that Alan's car was on the bottom of a river for about 30 years.",
        "Buzz: Well, one car doesn't make a big deal to Alan Spaulding, now, does it? Was it stolen or something?",
        "Frank: Well, we don't know, that's just the thing, we don't know if there were fatalities, or any injuries... The weird thing was, it wasn't even reported.",
        "Buzz: So you have to look into it.",
        "Josh: Billy, sooner or later somebody is going to figure this thing out, we have to tell the truth, we have to do it now.",
        "Billy: Wait, you put your hand in the sacred circle 30 years ago, you did it again tonight, you have an obligation.",
        "Josh: What about the obligation I have to my family?",
        "Billy: Oh, come on, you're taking care of that. Don't you understand? This is for your kids, Look, this guilt controls your life you gotta hold on to it.",
        "Josh: The other day Reva promised to love and support me no matter what, she -- she renewed herself to me, her body and soul to the man she thinks I am and that man is a lie. I --",
        "Billy: No, Josh, I know who you were and I know who you have become, the man you've become, he's a good man, Josh. You gotta believe that.",
        "Josh: I have to believe that if I stay true to the man I'm meant to be, everything's gonna be okay. If we confess this thing. It'll be tough for a while, but we'll --",
        "Billy: Wait, wait! Josh, Josh, if we'd been real men 30 years ago, yes, we would have done the right thing, but we didn't. Now what are you going to do, walk in, say \"I'm sorry, I killed somebody 30 years ago?\" It doesn't work like that. Don't kid yourself on this. There's other people involved, the Bauers and the Coopers, and, and you think Alan Spaulding's gonna just let this go if we rat him out? No. It's too late to be the good guys.",
        "Josh: Somebody's already tipped off Marah and the other girls. What difference does it make --",
        "Billy: We just put the hammer down and we deal with the girls, Josh, no cops, no tearful confessions.",
        "Marah: I don't see how I can go to my father and uncle and straight up accuse them of causing Maryanne's death. And why should I?",
        "Carrie: Because it's the right thing to do.",
        "Marah: For who? For you?",
        "Michelle: For Maryanne.",
        "Marina: But you're asking us to do something that could destroy all our families.",
        "Carrie: Someone is dead, don't you believe in justice?",
        "Michelle: Why us? Why didn't you go to the police?",
        "Marah: Because she's playing at something else, you chose us for some reason.",
        "Carrie: Yes, I did choose you for a reason, I thought you had some sense of decency.",
        "Marah: My father is the most decent man I have ever known, and you come in here with some horrible story and you expect me to throw everything I feel about him out the window?",
        "Michelle: And my father as well.",
        "Carrie: Oh, yes, your father, the doctor, \"first do no harm,\" you know yourself he hasn't been the same man since we went on this little journey for the truth. And why is that, I wonder?",
        "Marah: OK, so you're saying they have something to hide. But maybe they're just acting weird because what you're doing is weird.",
        "Marina: They have been different. I'm just saying I've noticed a change.",
        "Michelle: We all have. Okay, maybe getting everything out in the open will clear things up. I mean, whatever happened that night has obviously been weighing on these men for 30 years.",
        "Carrie: Yes, and they've all moved on with their lives. They had careers, marriages, families, children. But they have never once looked back until I gave them a reason to do it.",
        "Marah: You can't speak for them, you cannot say what they have been thinking and feeling for the last 30 years.",
        "Carrie: And you can't say what's in their hearts. We won't meet here again, this museum has become far too dangerous.",
        "Marina: Okay, well, here's a question. Why? Why are we protecting you at all? Why don't we just bring you to the guys and let you all hash it out?",
        "Carrie: A woman is dead. She has been dead and safely buried for 30 years. Until I came back and dug her up. What do you think these men might do to me if they ever thought she would not remain safely buried?",
        "Marah: You have no clue about my father if you think he would do anything to you.",
        "Carrie: Perhaps. But if you do choose to confront them again, I have another message for them.",
        "Marah: More love notes.",
        "Carrie: This time they're sealed.",
        "Marina: What about the fifth?",
        "Carrie: It's for Alan Spaulding. I'll deliver it myself.",
        "Marina: Okay. Here's what we could use, we could use a \u0091why,' a reason to do this.",
        "Carrie: You all know the reasons. This is a secret that's been eating away at these men for 30 years. You have seen the pain that it's caused. Surely you want to help your fathers.",
        "Michelle: What are you saying in these letters?",
        "Carrie: Perhaps they'll choose to share it with you. I hope they will. Perhaps it would give them some peace. I wish you all luck. Do whatever you think is right.",
        "Michelle: Okay, we're all thinking the same thing, right?",
        "Marah: That we have to go through with this.",
        "Marina: No matter where it leads or what it costs.",
        "Michelle: We're in too deep. We have no other choice.",
        "Gus: Yeah, but didn't you just want to break somebody's kneecaps who would steal your beautiful car like that or at least trash their credit or something?",
        "Alan: (Laughs) Have I ever spent much time telling you about Brandon?",
        "Gus: Yeah, my grandfather. My grandfather.",
        "Alan: Yeah, yeah. Well, he was what was known in his day as a corporate raider, and he tried to mold me into that vein. His idea of a world hero was someone who knew exactly what they needed and would do anything they had to to get it.",
        "Gus: Well, you probably have done a few things that you're not that proud of, right? But at least my mother saw, you know, you. the real you.",
        "Alan: Yeah, and I'm grateful she did.",
        "Gus: I see some of those things in you. You know, The nicer you, the more generous... you know, I see that.",
        "Alan: You've helped me understand that side of me. And, uh, you being by my side while Phillip's been gone has been very special for me, Gus. I want you to know that there is nothing that I won't do to reward your faith in me. Nothing.",
        "Buzz: Will you stop with Alan and the car? I don't know anything about it.",
        "Frank: I'm not saying you did, Pop, I just know you like a good mystery.",
        "Buzz: Since when? Especially when it has to do with Alan Spaulding. Come on, Frank.",
        "Frank: What is the matter with you?",
        "Darcy: Hello, gentlemen.",
        "Frank: How are you?",
        "Darcy: I'm good. I have a big surprise for you.",
        "Frank: You do?",
        "Darcy: Our bed was delivered today. Oh, it's so luxurious, California King. We don't even have to touch each other, with the down comforter and silk sheets... My whole life, this is the first time I've ever been able to see myself staying in the same bed for the next 40 years.",
        "Frank: Only 40? (Laughs) Ooh, sorry, Pop, a little too mushy for you, buddy?",
        "Buzz: I kind of like it, that's young love.. young-ish. I like seeing you happy. The Coopers are finally doing okay.",
        "Darcy: Yes, we are.",
        "Buzz: Ever swing on a star? Marina is in college, doing great with Shayne. Harley is in a premarital swoon with Gus. The whole family's blissful. All at once. I'm proud. Can I be proud?",
        "Frank: You bet you can, Pop.",
        "Buzz: What we've done with our lives. What we're doing. Your mom would be proud, she's up there somewhere smiling. She -- Am I getting misty?",
        "Frank: What is the matter with you, what's going on?",
        "Darcy: Frank... way to ruin a sweet, fatherly moment.",
        "Buzz: No, he's just used to my sweet, but cynical take on things. You two.",
        "Darcy: Thanks, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: I'm going to go outside and spread salt on the steps or something.",
        "Darcy: He's such a good man.",
        "Frank: He's the best.",
        "Darcy: No.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Buzz: Hey. You look like your old man was about to slap the cuffs on somebody.",
        "Marina: I got something for you.",
        "Buzz: I knew it couldn't last.",
        "Michelle: Dad? This is for you.",
        "Josh: Hi.",
        "Marah: Hi. We need to talk.",
        "Billy: Hi, Marah, what's up?",
        "Buzz: I won't take it.",
        "Marina: Can you tell me why?",
        "Alan: Let questions be asked, there are no answers if we remain silent, no one can know what happened that night, not the police, not Marah, Marina or Michelle.",
        "Josh: I wasn't expecting to see you tonight, darling, it's a pleasant surprise.",
        "Marah: You're an awful liar, Dad.",
        "Billy: Oh, come on, if your dad says he's happy to see you, he's happy to see you.",
        "Marah: It's not about that, it's about the look he got on his face when he saw these.",
        "Josh: You want me to order you some room service or something like that?",
        "Marah: No. Actually, Uncle Billy I'm glad that you're here, too.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah? Why is that?",
        "Marah: You guys remember how crazy Shayne was about comic books when he was young?",
        "Josh: Yeah, he still is.",
        "Marah: You remember he would always want to act out the scenes and he would pick his favorite character and then he'd want me to pick a character, but I really didn't know much about the comic book world or anything he was interested in back then. But, so I would pick one of you guys, and he would tell me that, um, you guys didn't have super powers. But I didn't care because to me you were heroes.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah, that reminds me, I left my cape at the cleaners.",
        "Marah: Dad, I don't know what I would do without you. And you have done so much for me. And put up with a lot from me.",
        "Josh: Marah.",
        "Marah: And Uncle Billy, you've always been larger than life, you know, and you've always been straight with me and you've treated me like a person instead a little kid.",
        "Billy: This sounds like it's headin' to some big crash.",
        "Marah: I guess I just expected you guys to be perfect. And I know that that's not fair. And right now I just want you to be honest with me. I just want the truth.",
        "Marina: Even the best people can make honest mistakes.",
        "Buzz: Are you about to give me life advice at the ripe old age of 18?",
        "Marina: Well, all I'm saying is that you can make the wrong choice at the wrong time, you can, you can get scared or feel threatened.",
        "Ed: All right. Now listen to me. I don't know exactly what you're getting at, but I have an idea.",
        "Michelle: I'm not trying to force the issue.",
        "Ed: Yes, you are! You are forcing the issue, that's what you've been doing from the beginning, the only problem is I don't know what the issue is.",
        "Michelle: You know, I used to think you were perfect.",
        "Ed: I've never pretended to be something I am not.",
        "Michelle: No, which is why I need to know the truth.",
        "Josh: The truth about what?",
        "Billy: Sweetheart, you have to go, we're in the middle of business.",
        "Marah: No, I'm not going.",
        "Ed: I don't tell you \u0091no' very often, but I'm busy today.",
        "Michelle: I checked your schedule, Dad, your shift is over.",
        "Ed: Why are you checking up on me?",
        "Buzz: I'm not sure I like this whole business of you looking deep into my soul for an answer or an admission.",
        "Marina: I never said that you have to admit anything. You just don't have to hide anything any more. I know.",
        "Marah: I know.",
        "Michelle: I know, Dad. I know everything.",
        "Ed: About what?",
        "Michelle: Do we really have to do this?",
        "Ed: Know everything about what?",
        "Michelle: October 1977, the fair, the woman, the accident.",
        "Billy: Where you gettin' all this stuff? We don't know anything about any carnivals. Yeah, your dad and I met a lot of women over the years.",
        "Marah: The drinking, Uncle Billy?",
        "Billy: So this is about me.",
        "Marah: No, Dad was involved, too.",
        "Billy: Involved in what?",
        "Marah: Powder in the drinks, guys in the car, you, Dad. Ed Bauer, Buzz Cooper, Alan Spaulding, and a woman and everyone was having fun, until the car drove off Cutter's Bridge.",
        "Marina: The young woman died that night, her name was...",
        "Michelle: Maryanne Caruthers. She had a full life ahead of her.",
        "Marah: But it ended that night. And she was forgotten for nearly 30 years.",
        "Billy: Well, that's nice, but it sounds more like a local legend.",
        "Marina: You think this is something I just happened to hear around town? This is a secret that's been hidden for almost three decades.",
        "Michelle: Maryanne can't be forgotten any more, Dad.",
        "Ed: Please stop this.",
        "Michelle: I know what happened. Look, I can't say that I understand all the torture you must have felt all these years.",
        "Ed: Please, please, these are lies! These are all lies!",
        "Michelle: Dad, I want to help you.",
        "Billy: We don't need your help because there's nothing to help with. Now, why don't you understand that?",
        "Michelle: I don't. I don't understand how you can stand there and deny something that we both know is true.",
        "Ed: All right. Now I'm going to tell you this for the last time. You mind your own business.",
        "Michelle: No, this is my business, because I know what you did.",
        "Ed: You don't know anything!",
        "Buzz: I don't know who's been talking to you or what they want.",
        "Billy: But they're lying to you, darlin'. Someone who knows your heart knows how compassionate you are.",
        "Josh: Someone's trying to cause you pain, Marah.",
        "Buzz: Who ever this liar is, he knows you'd do anything to help someone you thought was wronged, but I am telling you that none of this is the truth.",
        "Michelle: I didn't want to believe it at first. I actually defended you.",
        "Ed: Defended me to whom?",
        "Michelle: Then I brought up the name Maryanne Caruthers and the look on your face and the way you're acting right now.",
        "Marina: You didn't want anyone to die. I know that, you were young, you were drinking. When the car hit the water you must have been terrified.",
        "Marah: It must have been horrible. If the water was rising in the car, people were probably yelling, afraid of drowning.",
        "Michelle: Could you even breathe? Could you even think of anything but getting yourself out of there? I mean, if you hadn't nearly died, you would have saved Maryanne, if you could. But you swam for shore, thankful to be alive, and then, and then you realized that she wasn't there. She was gone. With one stupid horrible moment.",
        "Ed: This is not my life.",
        "Michelle: And you must have been wondering all these years if could you have saved her.",
        "Ed: No.",
        "Michelle: You must have been wondering if, if you let her die.",
        "Ed: I told you once, now you shut your mouth!",
        "Michelle: No, I won't! Because I want to know the truth and I want to hear you say it.",
        "Ed: I didn't do anything! I did nothing",
        "Michelle: Oh, Dad, say it, tell me!",
        "Ed: You are not talking about me, this is not me.",
        "Michelle: Tell me, Dad! Dad!",
        "Ed: I did nothing!",
        "(Smack)",
        "Ed: I never thought I could hit you.",
        "Michelle: We just fell down a black hole, didn't we? We can stop. We can all stop if we just help each other. You spent a lifetime saving people, Dad. What happened that night? I just want to understand.",
        "Ed: Michelle, who is spreading these lies?",
        "Buzz: Someone out there is puttin' this stuff in your head, I want to know who it is.",
        "Marina: So you're not going to answer my questions.",
        "Buzz: What's driving me crazy is, they're taking advantage of your heart, your wonderful huge heart, it's not fair to you, it's not fair to who you are.",
        "Marina: What I want to know, Grandpa, is who are you?",
        "Billy: First you tell us we're heroes, then you say we left a woman in a river to drown?",
        "Marah: Dad, you've never lied to me. At least I don't think you have. Why are you not saying anything?",
        "Billy: Marah, he's got nothing to say, can't you see you're breaking his heart? I mean, none of this makes any sense.",
        "Marah: That doesn't mean it's not true.",
        "Billy: For the last time, we don't know anybody named Maryanne Caruthers and frankly we're getting a little upset that you're taking somebody else's word over ours. Someone's turning you against your kin. Now, I think you should tell us just exactly who it is.",
        "Josh: Billy.",
        "Michelle: It doesn't matter who told me.",
        "Ed: Because somebody out there obviously hates me, and is trying to poison your mind against me. Now, I want you to tell me who it is.",
        "Buzz: You always told me everything, at least what I could bear to hear. Tell me who it is, I'll make them leave you alone.",
        "Billy: Marah, I'm not going to baby you like your daddy does, especially when you're not showing us a shred of respect. Now, if you're not going to tell us who's got you all twisted up, then maybe you better just leave.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry.",
        "Marah: This is not over, Dad. And we both know that it's not going away.",
        "Gus: I'm going to get in touch with Frank down at the station, see if I can get a break on this car.",
        "Alan: You don't have to do that, don't bother yourself with that, Gus.",
        "Gus: It's no bother. This for you? Whoa, smell the perfume on this thing. Hey, is this from a lady friend? Come to think of it, I never have seen you even holding a lady's hand or a date or anything, maybe you got a new love interest you're not telling me. I'm prying, sorry, shouldn't pry. Good enough.",
        "Marina: This is for you.",
        "Billy: What are these?",
        "Marah: I think you know. I want to hear your side, Dad. And I will never judge you. You taught me to be fair, and I will try and do that.",
        "Michelle: What you do with this letter is up to you. But you should know that someone was there, Sad, and they saw everything. The crash, the scramble to shore, the five of you leaving the scene. I just came to deliver this, and now you have it.",
        "Marina: I love you. Good luck.",
        "Billy: Josh, hey, what are you going to tell her?",
        "Josh: I don't know. Doesn't matter, she's never going to trust me again, she's never gonna believe in me again.",
        "Billy: Well, to save the world as you know it, that's the price you may have to pay.",
        "Ed: Excuse me.",
        "Carrie: Now you will know. Now you will all know what has always been true.",
        "Alan: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Cassie: That little girl was taken away from you, Olivia, through no fault of your own.",
        "Olivia: I can't. I can't. Thank you, I'm sorry.",
        "Shayne: You guys aren't going believe this.",
        "Reva: Why, what is it, what's wrong?",
        "Shane: It's what's right, I can feel something in my legs.",
        "Buzz: It isn't how much the kids are going to find out about, the question is how soon are they going to be able to prove it."
