        "Sandy: Let's see it. Let's see that nasty \r\nlittle temper of yours-- the one that got you locked up in here. ",
        "Jonathan: You're lucky I'm locked up. \n",
        "Sandy: Come on, you big tease. Is that the \r\nbest you can do? Yeah, I guess so, because all you can do is lash out, which, by \r\nthe way, makes things really easy for me. Because all I have to do is be the \r\ngood guy; it comes naturally. You lash out; I sit back and I wait. Just like I'm \r\nwaiting for Tammy to realize what a neanderthal you are. ",
        "Jonathan: You stay the hell away from her.\r\n",
        "Sandy: I hate to break the news to you there, \r\nJohnny boy, but your chance with Tammy went up in smoke. You're over. \n",
        "Jonathan: No, like hell it's over. Tammy and \r\nI are just getting started. ",
        "Sandy: With you locked up looking at jail \r\ntime, I don't think so. Well, I better get out of here. I've got some good guy \r\nstuff to do. Maybe I'll call Tammy and see if I can help her with anything.\r\n",
        "Jonathon: Stay away from her.",
        "Officer: Congratulations, Randall, you made \r\nbail. ",
        "Sandy: Well, you'd better save a spot for \r\nhim; he'll be back soon enough. ",
        "Jonathan: Hey. Hey! I meant what I said. You \r\ndon't go near Tammy, you don't call-- hey! You hear me! ",
        "Tammy: Hey, Petey. We're going to make it, \r\nJonathan. We are. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nFrank: So much for the Happy New Year. ",
        "Marina: Tell me about it. Well, I just mean \r\nthat-- I mean every lead that we've had on Gus so far leads us exactly nowhere.\r\n",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, don't worry, we'll find \r\nhim. Even if he doesn't want to be found. ",
        "Marina: You're pretty mad at him aren\u2019t you?\r\n",
        "Frank: Yeah, honey. I mean, come on, the guy \r\nnever listens. He never learns, does he? I mean, how much can Harley take? And \r\nyou know what? She's probably going to bail him out like she always does. \n",
        "Marina: Well, she loves him. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, lucky her. ",
        "Marina: You don't mean that. I mean, Gus \r\nmight be a little unstable... ",
        "Frank: Might be? ",
        "Marina: If he did go after Alan, he didn't do \r\nit to harm Harley, he did it to protect her. Gus loves Harley. We should all be \r\nso lucky to have someone like that in our lives. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: So basically no one has seen a limo. Are you sure? No, um... no, just \r\nkeep checking in with me, okay? Keep me posted. Thanks. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley, what are you doing \r\nhere? ",
        "Harley: What? I'm catching up on some paper \r\nwork while I check in with my contact. ",
        "Alan-Michael: No word on Gus? Okay, so \r\nconcentrate on finding your husband. I told you I'd cover things here. \n",
        "Harley: Yeah, but there's a big board meeting \r\ntoday and you hate those. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Don't worry, I'll muddle \r\nthrough. You find Gus. ",
        "Harley: And Alan. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Bringing him back is optional.\r\n",
        "Harley: Okay, deal. If you have any \r\nquestions, if you are confused about something or you need some help with \r\nsomething... ",
        "Alan-Michael: You're still the boss. \n",
        "Harley: Okay. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Go. It's too easy. ",
        "Mallet: Oh, hey. ",
        "Harley: Hey. ",
        "Mallet: I've been looking for you. Are you, \r\nuh... ",
        "Harley: Good? ",
        "Mallet: You good? ",
        "Harley: I'm good. ",
        "Mallet: Okay. I've been following up on this \r\nlimo thing, and I checked every motel, every gas station, every diner within \r\nlike a three-day's drive, and I got... I got nothing. I'm sorry. ",
        "Harley: That's all right. I've been checking \r\nwith my contacts, too, and there's nothing there. But that will change, because, \r\nyou know what? I woke up this morning with this feeling of utter certainty that \r\ntoday is the day we will find Gus. ",
        "Mallet: I hope you're right. ",
        "Harley: Oh, I know I am. ",
        "\u00a0( cell phone rings ) ",
        "Mallet: Yeah, Mallet. ",
        "Harley: Filomena Chancelore, please. It's \r\nHarley Cooper. ",
        "Mallet: What? Say that again. Say that again? \r\nOkay. ",
        "Harley: You know what? I'll call her back.\r\n",
        "Mallet: When did this happen? Great, thank \r\nyou. ",
        "Harley: Is it Gus? ",
        "Mallet: The GPS unit in the limo... \n",
        "Harley: The one that wasn't working? The one \r\nthat if it was working... ",
        "Mallet: Let me finish. The GPS unit in the \r\nlimo that wasn't sending a signal, it's sending one now. Apparently the unit's \r\nback on; it's transmitting a signal. ",
        "Harley: So we can find the car? ",
        "Mallet: Yes, maybe, yes. It looks like it. \r\nYes. ",
        "Harley: See, I told you. I told you, today's \r\nthe day. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nJonathan: Hi. ",
        "Officer: Miss, could you back off, please?\r\n",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, just give us a minute here? \r\nThanks for nothing, buddy. I made bail. ",
        "Tammy: Oh, that's great. I told you, you \r\nwouldn't be in here much longer. Are you happy? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah. I'm just... ",
        "Tammy: What? Jonathan, this is the start of \r\nthings being good for us. ",
        "Jonathan: Did you see Sandy on the way in \r\nhere? ",
        "Tammy: Sandy was here? Why? ",
        "Jonathan: Why do you think? He wants you \r\nback, no matter what it takes. ",
        "Tammy: I'm not worried about Sandy. \n",
        "Jonathan: Well, maybe you should be, because \r\nyou're out there alone. ",
        "Tammy: I'm not alone. You're getting out of \r\nhere, and you'll beat these stupid charges and then we'll be together from here \r\non out. ",
        "Jonathan: I've got to go to class first.\r\n",
        "Tammy: What? ",
        "Jonathan: That stupid anger management thing \r\nthat O'Neill set up. If I pass it, I get out of here. ",
        "Tammy: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.\r\n",
        "Jonathan: No, I guess not if you're going to \r\nbe waiting for me. All right, let's do it. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nAlan-Michael: Excuse me, what's the problem? ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nFrank: Well, looky there, Alan-Michael Spaulding with yet another traffic \r\nviolation. Poor, poor guy. ",
        "Marina: Oh, you like that, don't you? \n",
        "Frank: Well, if you're having a lousy day, it \r\ndoes put a certain little spring in one's step, doesn't it? ",
        "Alan-Michael: The flirting's been \r\nfun, but you're a kid. ",
        "Marina: A kid? ",
        "Frank: Okay, honey, I'm on my way to anger \r\nmanagement class, so, um... not as a participant, but as an observer. \n",
        "Marina: Oh. ",
        "Frank: Don't be a little Wisenheimer. \n",
        "Marina: Oh, no. I'm just... I was just \r\nchecking. ",
        "Frank: Okay. ",
        "Marina: Call me if you hear anything about \r\nGus, okay? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, I will, honey. You do the same.\r\n",
        "Marina: Of course. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nFrank: Officer, keep up the good work. ",
        "Alan-Michael: It must get lonely driving \r\naround in that car alone all day. You probably get excited when you see that \r\nsomeone's made a mistake and parked in front of the hydrant. ",
        "Officer: A mistake? ",
        "Alan-Michael: The truth is, I had a very \r\nimportant meeting today. We're thinking about trading in the jet and... I could \r\nuse some coffee. Would you like to join me? ",
        "Marina: You know, uh... Lorna here, she \r\ndoesn't bribe easily, and she's married. ",
        "Officer: Doesn't mean I don't enjoy watching \r\na good-looking guy squirm. ",
        "Marina: Amen to that. ( Laughter ) Wow, can \r\nyou imagine? Someone immune to your charms. ",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't suppose you could help \r\nme out with this, could you, officer? ",
        "Marina: You mean besides enjoy it? No, no. I \r\ndon't think so. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nHarley: Where's that limo? ",
        "Mallet: They're not sure. They've got a tech \r\nguy working on it right now. They've got me on hold. ",
        "Harley: Why is it taking so long? ",
        "Mallet: Would you step back and let the \r\nmaster paint? They can't get a signal, they don't know if it is a problem with \r\nthe car, the electrical system. Yeah, Bishop, I'm still here. What's up? Okay, \r\nthanks, man. Go back to it. But call me if you get a lock on the signal. \n",
        "Harley: I'm going to check the only lead we \r\nhave. ",
        "Mallet: There is no car. We haven't found it \r\nyet, and you don't know what we'll find if we get there. ",
        "Harley: Don't start in with the old cliches \r\nabout... ",
        "Mallet: Harley, listen, listen, I just want \r\nyou to be ready. I want you to be ready for anything. ",
        "Harley: I am. ",
        "Mallet: I'm only saying that because it has \r\nbeen a while since Gus has been gone, no emails or calls or anything. And all of \r\na sudden a car pops up. Maybe that is a good thing, maybe it is not a good \r\nthing. We don't know, right? ",
        "( Cell phone rings ) ",
        "Harley: Harley cooper. ",
        "Russ: Harley, Russ Casey. ",
        "Harley: It's the AME. What's going on? \n",
        "Russ: I am sorry to have to do this on the \r\nphone, but I knew you would want to know right away. A body has come in that \r\nmatches the description you gave us. ",
        "Mallet: What has he got? ",
        "Harley: A body came in matching Alan's \r\ndescription. ",
        "Harley, I'm not talking about Alan Spaulding. \r\nThe body matches the other description you gave us, the one for Gus. ",
        "Harley: We've got to go. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nMarina: So, I hear you're helping out at Spaulding... ",
        "Alan-Michael: I want to help her any way I \r\ncan. ",
        "Marina: It doesn't make up for parking in \r\nfront of a hydrant, but it is a nice gesture. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley is a good friend. I'd \r\nlike to think you're still a friend also. ",
        "Marina: I don't know. I'm still kind of a \r\nkid, and I feel a little immature for you. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Did I really say that? \n",
        "Marina: Just before you told me I was out of \r\nyour league. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Believe it or not, that was a \r\ncompliment, because what I meant to say is you're actually better than me.\r\n",
        "Marina: Well, that's lame. ",
        "Alan-Michael: I guess it sounds that way. But \r\nit's true. I kind of freaked out at the thought of getting closer to you. \n",
        "Marina: Why? ",
        "Alan-Michael: Because this was just supposed \r\nto be a stop along the way, and you were never supposed to be at all, and you're \r\nnot the kind of girl to take... ",
        "Marina: Woman. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Woman to take lightly. You've \r\ngot substance, you can't help it. You're a Cooper. ",
        "Marina: And you couldn't think of any of this \r\nthe other night. ",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm sorry. ",
        "Marina: Well, I'm sorry, too. I really needed \r\nto be with you that night. ",
        "Alan-Michael: I know, but, listen, if you \r\nneed me now, with all this stuff going on with Gus... ",
        "Marina: You know what? I'm okay. You pay that \r\nticket. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nFrank: Tammy, excuse me, you are not allowed to be in here, all right? \n",
        "Tammy: Okay, I'll wait out there. ",
        "Jonathan: No, you know what? Go home. I mean, \r\nto our place, and I'll just meet you there when I get there, okay? ",
        "Tammy: Our place, that's nice. I'll be \r\nwaiting. ",
        "Jonathan: Hey, if Sandy shows up or calls, \r\njust come back here. ",
        "Tammy: I'll be okay. ",
        "Jonathan: All right. Just be careful. \n",
        "Tammy: You, too. ",
        "Frank: All right, man, you ready? ",
        "Jonathan: Sure. ",
        "Frank: Okay. Okay, everybody, this is \r\nSergeant Powers. Sergeant Powers is going to be your anger management coach. He \r\nis a good man. We've worked together a number of years. Trust me when I say if \r\nyou listen to everything he says and take it to heart, hopefully you won't ever \r\ntalk to one of my officers or a judge again. Sergeant? ",
        "Powers: Thank you, Chief. Please, sit down. \r\nThis is an anger management class, but you can't really manage anger unless you \r\nknow what anger really is. ",
        "Jonathan: I can tell you what it is. \n",
        "Powers: So, what is it exactly, and why have \r\nwe become a nation of such angry people? ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nMarina: No news on Gus, okay, thanks. ",
        "Tammy: Marina, hi. ",
        "Marina: Hi. You look... I don't know, \r\nexcited. ",
        "Tammy: Jonathan is getting out on bail.\r\n",
        "Marina: And that's a reason to celebrate?\r\n",
        "Tammy: Yeah, definitely. I want to get him a \r\nlittle gift to surprise him or something. Wait, let me start over. Jonathan and \r\nI, we're together. ",
        "Marina: Together? Together, together? \n",
        "Tammy: Jonathan and I love each other. And if \r\nyou're going to say you're cousins or that is sick or he hurt you, just say it \r\nand get it over with, please. ",
        "Marina: When did this happen? ",
        "Tammy: I guess I've known it for a long time, \r\nbut I couldn't admit it until now. But now I want everyone to know. ",
        "Marina: Tammy, you seem so... ",
        "Tammy: Happy, shaken up, alive? ",
        "Marina: Yes, yes, all of the above. Does \r\nJonathan treat you well? ",
        "Tammy: He's incredible. He really is. He is \r\nsweet, he is gentle. I know what you're thinking. And you're right, okay, he did \r\nhurt me. But even then there was always something more, this connection between \r\nus. It just kept growing even when we tried to cut it off. ",
        "Marina: Wow. ",
        "Tammy: I know. I say that about a million \r\ntimes a day. I just... I can't even believe it. ",
        "Marina: So what does your mom think about all \r\nof this? ",
        "Tammy: Well, she had us both arrested and \r\nkept Jonathan locked up for about a week. ",
        "Marina: So she doesn't think so much? \n",
        "Tammy: Uh-huh. ",
        "Marina: I'm so sorry, Tammy. ",
        "Tammy: Thank you. It's not like I planned to \r\nfall for Jonathan. It just happened. My whole body and my heart and my soul just \r\nneeds to be near him. ",
        "Marina: Well, it sounds like love to me.\r\n",
        "Tammy: You don't think I'm crazy or under \r\nsome sort of evil spell? ",
        "Marina: You know what, if this is an evil \r\nspell, I wouldn't mind being under one myself. ",
        "Tammy: Thank you. Thank you for being so \r\nunderstanding. ",
        "Marina: Tammy, if you're happy, I am happy \r\nfor you. ",

        "M.E.: Not yet, I wanted to try for a positive \r\nvisual I.D. first. ",
        "Harley: You could do that yourself. You know \r\nGus. ",
        "M.E.: Yeah, but the body -- it is not in the \r\nbest shape. It is pretty beaten up. ",
        "Mallet: I'll do the I.D. ",

        "Harley: Oh, my God. Oh, my God! ",
        "Mallet: It's not Gus. It's not Gus. \n",
        "Harley: It's not him, it's not him. It's not \r\nhim. But I understand now. ",
        "Mallet: What do you understand? ",
        "Harley: I understand what that feels like. \r\nBecause I did it so many times, stood in that room, that very room, and watched \r\npeople I.D. bodies. I mean, I understood the pain but I didn't understand the \r\ndesperation until it was almost me. ",
        "Mallet: It wasn't you. It wasn't you, thank \r\nGod. ",
        "Harley: That poor man. That's somebody's \r\nfather, brother, and, you know, Mallet, just because it's not Gus, it doesn't \r\nmean he's not out there... ",
        "Mallet: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't do this.\r\n",
        "Harley: Gus is at risk. Alan killed Phillip. \r\nWho's to say he won't try to kill Gus or... that he hasn't already? ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nMarina: These for your big meeting? They're nice. ",
        "Alan-Michael: You know what they're for.\r\n",
        "Marina: You don't have to apologize for the \r\nother night. You don't have to apologize for anything. ",
        "Alan-Michael: What if I was doing it to pave \r\nthe way for a new approach? ",
        "Marina: Oh, wow, you've got that whole \r\ncorporate speaking thing down. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Take them. ",
        "Marina: I think I'll pass. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Look, let me be honest here...\r\n",
        "Marina: Alan-Michael, I don't think I can \r\ntake any more of your honesty. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina, I get to you and you \r\nget to me. Am I wrong? No, I'm not. Now, I may come off as a complete jerk \r\nsometimes.... ",
        "Marina: Sometimes. ",
        "Alan Michael: Okay, so maybe I am a complete \r\njerk, but we have this effect on each other, and if anything else matters, then \r\ntell me and my flowers to get lost. But if that's good enough for you like it's \r\ngood enough for me-- and I'm talking about a starting point, a jumping-off \r\nspot-- then take these, put them in water, and agree to take my calls. \n",
        "Marina: Some pitch. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Straight from the heart of a \r\ncomplete jerk. But what the hell? Take a chance. See what happens. What have you \r\ngot to lose? ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nPowers: What makes you angry? Let's hear some specifics. ( Laughter ) Sounds \r\nlike you've got some. ",
        "Man: You're damn right. I'm a contractor who \r\nhas to deal with whiny clients... ",
        "Woman: Oh, please, try hiring a contractor \r\nand have him run over by $10,000. ",
        "Powers: Whoa, whoa, look what has happened. A \r\ncomplete stranger pushed your buttons. Why? Maybe she saw something about you \r\nthat you don't want to admit to or cop to. See, being found out can really make \r\nus mad. Okay, I want you to close your eyes and think about how this might apply \r\nto you. ",
        "Sandy: How is it working, Johnny \r\nboy? You feeling serene? ",
        "Jonathan: Shut up.\n",
        "Sandy: You've been found out. You \r\nthink you're so slick you can keep getting off, but the truth is, you're not \r\nfooling anyone. ",
        "Tammy: He's fooling me. ",
        "Sandy: I stand corrected. \n",
        "Tammy: I believe in Jonathan.\r\n",
        "Sandy: Wow, somebody here is being \r\nfooled. But then again, she did believe in me, too, for a while. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, look where it got \r\nher. ",
        "Sandy: I could never hurt Tammy the \r\nway you have. You would soon shred her entire family than leave her alone and \r\nlet her have some peace. But you don't respect anything or anyone.\n",
        "Tammy: He respects me. ",
        "Sandy: He uses you. Big, big \r\ndifference. Or wasn't that you that he slept with to get back at Reva? Taking \r\nTammy's virginity, sick. But par for the course for you, right? You nearly \r\nkilled her with shame and humiliation. So what? You got what you wanted! \n",
        "Jonathan: It's not like that \r\nanymore. ",
        "Sandy: You hurt her, and you'll do \r\nit again. Because that's who you are. That's all you know how to do. Hurt people \r\nand trash their lives. You love her? Let her go. That way when you \r\nself-destruct, you won't take her down with you. ",
        "Jonathan: It's not going to happen \r\nlike that. ",
        "Sandy: Of course it is! That's who \r\nyou are. And as sweet as Tammy is, she can't save you from yourself. ",
        "Tammy: Don't believe him, Jonathan. \r\nI can save you. Can I? Jonathan? Jonathan?\n",
        "Frank: Jonathan, Jonathan! I got your bail \r\npapers. For somebody being so hell-bent on wanting to get out of here, you \r\ncertainly zoned out. ",
        "Jonathan: I'm done? ",
        "Frank: Yeah, you're free to go until your \r\nnext hearing, and, Jonathan, don't go too far. ",
        "\r\n_________________________________________",
        "\r\nTammy: Did you follow me here? ",
        "Sandy: No. Just took a shot. ",
        "Tammy: What did you want to talk about?\r\n",
        "Sandy: The way things are. I know you're with \r\nJonathan now, and I understand that. ",
        "Tammy: You do? ",
        "Sandy: I... I'm trying to move on. You have. \r\nAnd you're happy, or so you say. ",
        "Tammy: I am happy. ",
        "Sandy: And I'm trying to get there. But it's \r\nhard. I have to admit it. I love you. I lost you. It's killing me. ",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry. ",
        "Sandy: I don't need your apologies. I do need \r\nyour help, though. ",
        "Tammy: My help? ",
        "Sandy: Yeah. I still don't understand why you \r\nchose Jonathan over me. Why I wasn't enough for you, and if... I would \r\nappreciate it if you could just explain that to me in some way to make sense of \r\nit. ",
        "Tammy: I didn't do this to hurt you, Sandy. \r\nIt's not a black and white thing, it's not like Jonathan is some perfect guy and \r\nyou're someone that I can't stand. ",
        "Sandy: That's how it feels. ",
        "Tammy: Well, then... maybe it is good that \r\nwe're talking, you know? Maybe it will make it easier for you to move on. \n",
        "Sandy: Maybe. ",
        "Tammy: I didn't draw up a list of pros and \r\ncons about him or you. I just... Jonathan and I just love each other. \n",
        "Sandy: And you don't love me? ",
        "Tammy: Not like that, no. I'm sorry. I wish I \r\ncould make this work for everybody, but I can't. And I'm so tired of the drama. \r\nI don't want it. I don't need it. I just want... Jonathan. ",
        "Sandy: See, I think you love the drama. It's \r\nthe danger of being with Jonathan that is driving you crazy, not the love. You \r\nget off on taking the risk. ",
        "Tammy: That is not true. ",
        "Sandy: It's a high, Tammy, and the more you \r\nstand to lose, the bigger the rush. ",
        "Tammy: No. ",
        "Sandy: You might as well jump out of an \r\nairplane without a parachute, and thanks to Jonathan cutting you off from \r\neverybody who really loves you, when you hit the ground, there will be nobody \r\nthere to help you pick up the pieces, and you know it's true. He cost you your \r\nmom, you're still up on arson charges, and pretty soon, he'll cost you \r\neverything. ",
        "Tammy: Sandy, we're over, and, look, I'm \r\nleaving. ",
        "Sandy: Wait... ",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry if you're hurt, but nothing \r\nthat you say is going to change anything. ",
        "Sandy: Wait, wait, wait, wait! We... what we \r\nhad was good. We were going to have the family, the house, the whole thing. I \r\nstill want that. ",
        "Tammy: You can't have it with me. ",
        "Sandy: Why? It's not out of reach. I forgave \r\nyou before, and I'll forgive you again. ",
        "Tammy: What? ",
        "Sandy: We can start over... ",
        "Tammy: We're over, Sandy. I'm sorry. \n",
        "Sandy: Wait! I loved you. If you could let \r\nyourself... you loved me once. You can love me again. ",
        "Jonathan: Get the hell away from her or I'm \r\ngoing to kill you. ",
