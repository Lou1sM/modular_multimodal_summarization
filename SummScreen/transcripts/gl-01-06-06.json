Let's see that nasty little temper of yours-- the one that got you locked up in here. \nJonathan: You're lucky I'm locked up. \n\nSandy: Come on, you big tease. Is that the best you can do? Yeah, I guess so, because all you can do is lash out, which, by the way, makes things really easy for me. Because all I have to do is be the good guy; it comes naturally. You lash out; I sit back and I wait. Just like I'm waiting for Tammy to realize what a neanderthal you are. \nJonathan: You stay the hell away from her.\nSandy: I hate to break the news to you there, Johnny boy, but your chance with Tammy went up in smoke. You're over. \n\nJonathan: No, like hell it's over. Tammy and I are just getting started. \nSandy: With you locked up looking at jail time, I don't think so. Well, I better get out of here. I've got some good guy stuff to do. Maybe I'll call Tammy and see if I can help her with anything.\nJonathon: Stay away from her.\nOfficer: Congratulations, Randall, you made bail. \nSandy: Well, you'd better save a spot for him; he'll be back soon enough. \nJonathan: Hey. Hey! I meant what I said. You don't go near Tammy, you don't call-- hey! You hear me! ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Hey, Petey. We're going to make it, Jonathan. We are.

Even if he doesn't want to be found. \nMarina: You're pretty mad at him aren\u2019t you?\nFrank: Yeah, honey. I mean, come on, the guy never listens. He never learns, does he? I mean, how much can Harley take? And you know what? She's probably going to bail him out like she always does. \n\nMarina: Well, she loves him. \nFrank: Yeah, well, lucky her. \nMarina: You don't mean that. I mean, Gus might be a little unstable... \nFrank: Might be? \nMarina: If he did go after Alan, he didn't do it to harm Harley, he did it to protect her. Gus loves Harley. We should all be so lucky to have someone like that in our lives. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "_________________________________________\nHarley: So basically no one has seen a limo. Are you sure? No, um... no, just keep checking in with me, okay? Keep me posted. Thanks. \nAlan-Michael: Harley, what are you doing here? \nHarley: What? I'm catching up on some paper work while I check in with my contact. \nAlan-Michael: No word on Gus? Okay, so concentrate on finding your husband. I told you I'd cover things here. \n\nHarley: Yeah, but there's a big board meeting today and you hate those. \nAlan-Michael: Don't worry, I'll muddle through. You find Gus. \nHarley: And Alan. \nAlan-Michael: Bringing him back is optional.\nHarley: Okay, deal.

I've been following up on this limo thing, and I checked every motel, every gas station, every diner within like a three-day's drive, and I got... I got nothing. I'm sorry. \nHarley: That's all right. I've been checking with my contacts, too, and there's nothing there. But that will change, because, you know what? I woke up this morning with this feeling of utter certainty that today is the day we will find Gus. \nMallet: I hope you're right. \nHarley: Oh, I know I am. \n\u00a0( cell phone rings ) \nMallet: Yeah, Mallet. \nHarley: Filomena Chancelore, please. It's Harley Cooper. \nMallet: What? Say that again. Say that again? Okay. \nHarley: You know what? I'll call her back.\nMallet: When did this happen? Great, thank you. \nHarley: Is it Gus? \nMallet: The GPS unit in the limo... \n\nHarley: The one that wasn't working? The one that if it was working... \nMallet: Let me finish. The GPS unit in the limo that wasn't sending a signal, it's sending one now. Apparently the unit's back on; it's transmitting a signal. \nHarley: So we can find the car? \nMallet: Yes, maybe, yes.

Jonathan, this is the start of things being good for us. \nJonathan: Did you see Sandy on the way in here? \nTammy: Sandy was here? Why? \nJonathan: Why do you think? He wants you back, no matter what it takes. \nTammy: I'm not worried about Sandy. \n\nJonathan: Well, maybe you should be, because you're out there alone. \nTammy: I'm not alone. You're getting out of here, and you'll beat these stupid charges and then we'll be together from here on out. \nJonathan: I've got to go to class first.\nTammy: What? \nJonathan: That stupid anger management thing that O'Neill set up.

We're thinking about trading in the jet and... I could use some coffee. Would you like to join me? \nMarina: You know, uh... Lorna here, she doesn't bribe easily, and she's married. \nOfficer: Doesn't mean I don't enjoy watching a good-looking guy squirm. \nMarina: Amen to that. ( Laughter ) Wow, can you imagine?

They've got me on hold. \nHarley: Why is it taking so long? \nMallet: Would you step back and let the master paint? They can't get a signal, they don't know if it is a problem with the car, the electrical system. Yeah, Bishop, I'm still here. What's up? Okay, thanks, man. Go back to it. But call me if you get a lock on the signal. \n\nHarley: I'm going to check the only lead we have. \nMallet: There is no car. We haven't found it yet, and you don't know what we'll find if we get there. \nHarley: Don't start in with the old cliches about... \nMallet: Harley, listen, listen, I just want you to be ready. I want you to be ready for anything. \nHarley: I am. \nMallet: I'm only saying that because it has been a while since Gus has been gone, no emails or calls or anything. And all of a sudden a car pops up. Maybe that is a good thing, maybe it is not a good thing. We don't know, right? \n( Cell phone rings ) \nHarley: Harley cooper. \nRuss: Harley, Russ Casey. \nHarley: It's the AME. What's going on? \n\nRuss: I am sorry to have to do this on the phone, but I knew you would want to know right away. A body has come in that matches the description you gave us. \nMallet: What has he got? \nHarley: A body came in matching Alan's description. \nHarley, I'm not talking about Alan Spaulding.

I'd like to think you're still a friend also. \nMarina: I don't know. I'm still kind of a kid, and I feel a little immature for you. \nAlan-Michael: Did I really say that? \n\nMarina: Just before you told me I was out of your league. \nAlan-Michael: Believe it or not, that was a compliment, because what I meant to say is you're actually better than me.\nMarina: Well, that's lame. \nAlan-Michael: I guess it sounds that way. But it's true. I kind of freaked out at the thought of getting closer to you. \n\nMarina: Why? \nAlan-Michael: Because this was just supposed to be a stop along the way, and you were never supposed to be at all, and you're not the kind of girl to take... \nMarina: Woman. \nAlan-Michael: Woman to take lightly. You've got substance, you can't help it. You're a Cooper. \nMarina: And you couldn't think of any of this the other night. \nAlan-Michael: I'm sorry. \nMarina: Well, I'm sorry, too.

But now I want everyone to know. \nMarina: Tammy, you seem so... \nTammy: Happy, shaken up, alive? \nMarina: Yes, yes, all of the above. Does Jonathan treat you well? \nTammy: He's incredible. He really is. He is sweet, he is gentle. I know what you're thinking. And you're right, okay, he did hurt me. But even then there was always something more, this connection between us. It just kept growing even when we tried to cut it off. \nMarina: Wow. \nTammy: I know. I say that about a million times a day. I just... I can't even believe it. \nMarina: So what does your mom think about all of this? \nTammy: Well, she had us both arrested and kept Jonathan locked up for about a week. \nMarina: So she doesn't think so much? \n\nTammy: Uh-huh. \nMarina: I'm so sorry, Tammy. \nTammy: Thank you. It's not like I planned to fall for Jonathan. It just happened. My whole body and my heart and my soul just needs to be near him. \nMarina: Well, it sounds like love to me.\nTammy: You don't think I'm crazy or under some sort of evil spell? \nMarina: You know what, if this is an evil spell, I wouldn't mind being under one myself. \nTammy: Thank you.
