{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Buzz, Alan, Ed, Billy and Josh meet to discuss the mysterious notes delivered to them, saying Maryanne Caruthers will not be forgotten. The meeting is tense, full of incriminations and regret but Billy and Alan insist that they must stick to their plan, now more than ever: if they follow the girls and determine who is doing this to them, they can end this madness. But Ed's nervous about what \"ending it\" will entail. Alan doesn't elaborate but his coldness suggests a dark solution, one all the men are clearly hesitant to name. They split up as we see the ramifications this latest turn takes on them: Buzz clearly contemplates leaving town. Billy is tempted to drink. Ed tries and fails to get out of emergency room duty. And Josh, who confesses to Billy that he doesn't trust himself around others, tries to go into hibernation in his hotel room only to be visited by Reva.", "Shayne is recovering from his surgery but has a frustrating moment when he cannot move his legs, despite his \"feeling\" that they are indeed mobile. For her own reasons, Marina finds herself really, truly needing Shayne to recover fully. But Shayne's already thinking that he has to be open to other eventualities and, not only that, must bear the brunt of preparing those he loves for what may come. Marina angrily rejects his overture, saying he's just giving up -- not understanding that his only motive is to help her.", "Olivia has a run-in with a classmate from Lamaze, who's unaware Olivia lost her child. Cassie sees Olivia in distress and tries to help. But the descriptions of her own loss, meant to comfort Olivia, only show Edmund that Cassie's own wounds are still fresh. He tries to get her to talk about the baby she lost -- and his role in it -- but Cassie is reluctant, finally confessing: she's not prepared for where this discussion may take them."], "Recap Author": "Megan", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["Cassie: Here you go. Someone left it in the lobby. Are you crazy? We're in public.", "Edmund: That never stopped me before.", "Cassie: Yes, but Edmund might come in and catch us.", "Edmund: I hadn't thought about that. We'd better get out of here and get some lunch.", "Cassie: Well, we'll have to wait a few minutes. I have some business to discuss with Olivia.", "Edmund: All right. Go on. I'll stay here and keep an eye out for that wretched boyfriend of yours.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Louise: Olivia.", "Olivia: Hi.", "Louise: Hi. I thought it was you.

Hi.", "Sandy: Hi.", "Reva: I appreciate you stopping by.", "Sandy: I just came to... you know, support Shayne.", "Reva: Thanks. He'll like that.", "Sandy: He's a good guy.", "Reva: Actually, Shayne right now is downstairs having some tests done. But he'll be back soon. Marina should be here, too.", "Sandy: Well, we can go inside and wait, right?", "Reva: Yeah. Good idea.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: This is why I called you here. \"Gentlemen, you never paid your debt. Now you will.\" Look at it.", "Ed: We don't have to.", "Buzz: Why?", "Alan: Yeah.", "Josh: Yeah, I got one.", "Buzz: Well, the \"CLOSED\" sign is up, the door is locked. There's no one but the five of us here.", "Josh: That's what we all thought the night Alan's car went into the water.", "Buzz: Well, this mess just went from bad to worse.", "Ed: They're not asking us what happened anymore. They're accusing us.", "Alan: Who's accusing?", "Josh: Marah and Marina and Michelle. They're coming to us with details now, Alan. They know the whole story practically minute by minute.", "Buzz: The question isn't how much the kids are going to find out about us; the question is how soon are they going to be able to prove it?", "Alan: Listen to me.", "Buzz: Listen to you! Listen to you! We did that the night you talked Maryanne Caruthers into taking the ride with us. Look where it got us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Louise: I want to see your pictures, too, though.", "Olivia: No, I... I...", "Louise: Isn't being a mom the best thing in the world? I never thought that I could be this happy. Isn't this the best time of your life?", "Olivia: Cassie. Louise, this is Cassie Winslow. She's my...", "Cassie: Friend. Are you okay?", "Olivia: Yes, I am. I'm okay.", "Louise: Oh, no.", "Olivia: No, no, no. Don't feel bad. You didn't know and the doctors did everything they could to save her.", "Louise: Oh, God, I would have never have gone on like that if I had known.", "Olivia: I know.", "Louise: I just assumed that everything worked out all right.", "Cassie: It was nice meeting you.", "Louise: Thank you. Oh, Olivia, I'm sure if you just... Now you take care of yourself.", "Olivia: I will. Well, you know, just another day.", "Cassie: I know that wasn't easy.", "Olivia: Yes, I guess of all people you would understand better than anyone, having lost your baby.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Personally I don't think finger-pointing is out of line, not when there's so much to point at.", "Billy: Buzz, give it a break, okay?", "Buzz: Or don't you remember that Night from Hell when you roped the four of us into keeping quiet?", "Alan: I made a suggestion and you agreed.", "Ed: We did not agree, Alan.", "Billy: You all agreed.", "Alan: Hey, hey, hey, guys we all had a lot to lose that night.", "Josh: You know some things never change.", "Billy: Everybody benefited from us being quiet.", "Ed: Up until now.", "Billy: Just gloom and doom, man.", "Ed: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll try to be sunny.", "Buzz: Hey, look, look. Hey, before you climb all over him again take a reality check. The secret isn't so secret anymore.", "Ed: Why didn't that person go to the police if he knows what happened that night?", "Josh: I don't know.", "Alan: One word, Ed: money.", "Ed: What? He's going to try and blackmail us now?", "Alan: It's always about money.", "Buzz: This just gets better and better, you know. I have half a mind to skip the rest of this movie.", "Alan: That would be just like you, Buzz. You always were afraid to stay and fight.", "Buzz: No, I didn't stay here all these years and torture my family the way you did. Maybe you should have given them a break and taken a few years off and they wouldn't be in state they're in now.", "(All talking)", "Buzz: So we all go down! We all go down together!", "(All talking)", "Josh: Just stop! Stop! Stop! Listen to yourselves! We're all so worried about what's going to happen to us. Are we going to go to jail? Are we going to get through this thing alive? What about... what about the girls, huh? What about your daughter, Ed? What about Marina? Somebody has dragged them into this mess with us. Doesn't that bother any of you? Have you thought about it for a minute? What does this person... this person want with them?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Hi.", "Marina: Hey. Shayne's downstairs.", "Sandy: We heard.", "Marina: What's wrong?", "Reva: Oh, nothing. Nothing. Just wondering what kind of program you had planned for Shayne.", "Marina: Oh. (Laughs) It actually is Shayne's from the all-star game last summer. He must have had it with his stuff when he checked in. I just found it so... That game seems like a million years ago.", "Reva: Did you happen to see him before he went down for his test?", "Marina: No. And I couldn't find anyone to tell me how he's doing.", "Shayne: Rick, I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding.", "Sandy: Is that Shayne?", "Reva: Certainly sounds like him. Yeah, that's him.", "Shayne: Hey, you guys aren't going to believe this.", "Reva: Why? What is it? What's wrong?", "Shayne: No, it's what's right. I could feel something in my legs.", "Reva and Marina: What?!", "Shayne: It just started.", "Rick: Coming up on the elevator.", "Shayne: Yeah, I... I got a... I had this feeling. I didn't know what it was and... and... like right there, right there. I could feel it. It's stronger. It feels stronger.", "Marina: Shayne, that's great.", "Rick: Shayne...", "Shayne: I think I can move it. I think I can...", "Marina: This is amazing.", "Reva: Honey...", "Shayne: Hold on. I can. I can. I can feel it moving. Okay. They were moving. I felt it. I felt it.", "Rick: Shayne, Shayne. It's okay.", "Shayne: What do you mean, it's okay? I could... I felt my leg moving. I feel them right now. Look, nothing's happening. Nothing!", "Reva: That doesn't mean that nothing will.", "Rick: She's right. She's right, Shayne.", "Shayne: Who are you kidding?", "Reva: Shayne.", "Rick: The brain can play tricks on us.", "Shayne: Yeah, yeah, mine's telling me I can walk. I can't.", "Reva: You know that you didn't not have this operation in order to walk again.", "Rick: It was performed to remove a dangerous seroma, which it did. So the truth is, the operation was a success.", "Reva: And the walking was just supposed to be a possible side effect. The doctors told you that going in.", "Rick: Right. And the jury's still out as far what may happen for you, Shayne.", "Marina: Yeah, you can't expect too much too fast.", "Sandy: You're doing great, though.", "Shayne: I feel like an idiot. I really thought something was going. Can we... you think we could just...", "Reva: Get... get you back into bed? Of course.", "Rick: Sure.", "Reva: And you know what I'm going to do is tell you about what happened on my show today, because that ought to put you right to sleep. (Laughs)", "Marina: You know what? I think I'm going to be out in the hall.", "Reva: Okay.", "Sandy: Hey, it'll be all right, man. You're the toughest guy I know. Hang in. You okay, Marina?", "Marina: Do I look okay?", "Sandy: Nobody looks too good right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: There are ways to manage this.", "Josh: Alan, whatever we do may protect us, but what about them? What about the girls?", "Billy: Josh. The girls are going to be fine.", "Josh: You don't know that. How could you even assume that? If Marina and Michelle are anything at all like my daughter, they're already obsessed with this story, with Maryanne Caruthers and what we did to her. And they're not going to let it go.", "Alan: We didn't do anything to her. It was an accident, Josh.", "Josh: Oh, come on.", "Ed: That we set up.", "Buzz: That he set up.", "Billy: No, no, no. We're all in this together.", "Alan: Oh, yeah, it's my fault.", "Josh: And they're in it with us! This thing is tearing us apart. It could very easily tear them apart. Marah came to Billy and me with these notes, and she told us the story. They know the story. But she wanted to hear my side. She wanted to give me the benefit of the doubt, the chance to tell the truth. She told me she wouldn't pass judgment on me. And I believe her. When she found out that I was responsible for Shayne's accident, she didn't turn her back on me, not for one minute. Buzz, if you tell Marina the truth, will she forgive you?", "Buzz: I'd like to think so. But I'm not sure.", "Josh: And what about Michelle, Ed?", "Ed: Forgiveness? Too late for that. I hit her.", "Josh: You what?", "Buzz: What?", "Ed: What? She kept pushing me and pushing me. So yesterday she pushed me too far, and I slapped her across the face.", "Josh: You said we did what we did to protect the future. Is that what you had in mind?", "Billy: Let me ask you a question. Just how much worse are you prepared for this to get?", "Alan: Look, we did what we had to do that terrible night in all of our lives that none of us wanted, Josh. We can't roll the clock back. We can't change anything. What's in the past is in the past. But we took an oath that night to move on from there.", "Ed: To protect ourselves.", "Alan: And now our families, the people we love. That why we have to stay the course.", "Josh: The girls already know the facts.", "Alan: Unproven facts. Facts that we only know are accurate.", "Buzz: Us and whoever's feeding the girls this information.", "Alan: Yes. And that is the key. We have got to find this person so that he will start spreading this harm.", "Josh: How are we supposed to do that?", "Alan: I suggest that we get as many private investigators as we need to follow the girls, so that they will lead us to him.", "Ed: And then what? I mean, suppose we find Mr. X, right? What do we do then? We go up to him and say, \u0091Please stop doing what you're doing?' Or do you have something else in mind?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: You know what, Cassie? Believe it or not, I'm okay. I am. I'm okay.", "Cassie: I can help you. I have the same ache that you do.", "Olivia: Really? After all these years?", "Cassie: Yeah. It still been all these years without my little boy. And there's still a space where he should be.", "Olivia: Can we... can we do this another time? Would you mind?", "Cassie: I know you just... you just want to run away from it all.", "Olivia: No, I just think I really need to be alone right now.", "Cassie: Okay, fine. But... I understand what you're going through. I do. But don't fall into a trap, okay? Because one afternoon is going to turn into two, and two afternoons is going to turn into a week. And you're going to cut yourself off from everyone. And don't do that, okay? But you're never going to stop thinking about that little girl. And there's mourning and there's guilt. But that little girl was taken away from you, Olivia, through no fault of your own.", "Olivia: I just don't think I can do much more of this, Cassie.", "Cassie: And the same thing happened to mine.", "Olivia: I can't. I can't. Thank you so much.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie...", "Cassie: No, Edmund, look... you know, I didn't mean any of that. It had nothing to do with you. It wasn't about you, okay?", "Edmund: Cassie, you lost your son. Going over whose fault that was...", "Cassie: I'm not going over whose fault. Okay, I'm not. Look I have a lot to do. Excuse me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Hey. Is he asleep?", "Reva: No. Actually, Sandy's in with him right now. Pretty frustrating day, huh?", "Marina: Yeah. I know. I feel so bad that Shayne was so let down.", "Reva: I think we were all a little let down. It's not a crime to admit that.", "Marina: Right. There's no crime.", "Reva: You know, Marina, this is going to be rough for everyone who loves Shayne. And it's going to be like this for at least a little while longer.", "Marina: I know. And I can handle it if that's what you're getting at. I'm sorry. I guess I'm really not handling it that well.", "Reva: I saw the look on your face when Shayne didn't move his legs.", "Marina: I just want him to walk so badly.", "Reva: I know.", "Marina: I don't know. I tried to not be like one of those \"me-me\" girls. You know, the kind, they freak out if they break a nail. They get everything handed to them.", "Reva: You are definitely not a \"me-me\" girl.", "Marina: I just want to know that it's possible for things to work out. That they do go right sometimes.", "Reva: Is there something else wrong, Marina? I mean, if there's another problem that you want to talk about, I'm here.", "Marina: No. No. All I can really think about is Shayne right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: So then Mole says, \"If you lovebirds get any closer, you're going to have share underwear. Unless you already do.\" Shayne, have I ever told you the story of the buddy I had growing up, the surfer?", "Shayne: No.", "Sandy: Well, this was his ride after a 20-foot wave broke the wrong way. Still is.", "Shayne: Is this supposed to cheer me up?", "Sandy: There's a point.", "Shayne: What? What? That life sucks.", "Sandy: Just... just listen. All right? Here was this guy trying to wrap his head around the fact that he was going to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. And meanwhile, his family, who had always expected him to be the can-do kid, pretty much fell apart.", "Shayne: It's a fun story so far.", "Sandy: Well, they couldn't handle having someone they needed to be strong be a paraplegic. And they kept looking to him to somehow make it all okay for them -- as if he didn't have enough to deal with already.", "Shayne: What happened?", "Sandy: Well, he took it all on himself. He spent hours, days trying to help his family understand and get a grip. Have them understand that this is how it was going to be from now on. And it completely stressed him out, but he did it anyway. You know why? Because he said it was his obligation.", "Shayne: What are you... is there a point to this story?", "Sandy: There is a point. You know what the point is? The point is sometimes you got to put yourself first and let everyone else figure out for themselves how to cope, man. If my friend had known that, he could have saved himself a whole lot of grief.", "Shayne: Yeah, well, he just didn't want to let anybody down.", "Sandy: Yeah. But there are limits. And if you don't set them, you'll get pulled in a million different ways.", "Shayne: No. It won't. It's not going to happen to me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: You haven't answered my question.", "Alan: We haven't found our man, yet. But once we do, Ed, we'll know what action will be appropriate.", "Buzz: Now you're going to have a gang of PIs shadow the girls and lead us to whoever this person is.", "Alan: Yes, as soon as possible.", "Billy: Wait, man. You're getting a whole bunch of people involved in this. You're never going to keep it quiet.", "Buzz: So what if something screws up when they make contact, and the girls get hurt or worse?", "Alan: I can assure that everything will be kept under control.", "Ed: You can't guarantee anything, Alan!", "Billy: You know, Alan, I think this is a bad idea... bad idea. At least for right now.", "Alan: Well, do you have a better idea? Or do you want...", "Josh: Yeah, I have a better idea. I have a better idea. We talk to the girls. We see if we can get the information out of them who this person is. If not, then we'll follow them.", "Alan: All right, all right. I'll hold off the investigator for now. But we have got to find this person immediately. One way or another.", "Buzz: Well, knowing Alan the way I do, he's going to hire the PIs anyway behind our backs.", "Billy: Oh, no, no. No, he won't do anything as long as we just hang in there and hang in tough.", "Ed: Protect each other.", "Billy: What else are we going to do? We can't go to the cops. Can't go to the kids. Now, you proved that to yourself today. When pressed, you'd rather hit Michelle than for us to take a hit.", "Buzz: Wow, you really have a word with words, you know, Billy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: See you later.", "Billy: Hey, Josh, Josh. Josh!", "Josh: You know what? I've had it. I've had it with the secrets. I've had it with the lies.", "Billy: Okay, look, maybe... maybe you should just come hang out with me till you cool down.", "Josh: I don't want to be around people right now. Not the way I feel. I want to go back to my room, I want to be alone, I want to get as far away from this as I possibly can.", "Billy: Okay. Well, all right. I'll just come back with you until...", "Josh: I want to be alone. Until this feeling that I have to do the right thing passes by. You want to... you want to know what I don't get here, Billy?", "Billy: What?", "Josh: Why don't you feel the same way I do? A woman is dead. We're sitting on the truth, and you're okay with that. You think it's the only thing to do. We really are very different.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Frank: Hey, kiddo.", "Marina: Hey, how'd you find me?", "Frank: Well, I tried you on your cell phone and no answers. So I decided to take a shot. How's Shayne? Honey, what happened?", "Marina: Nothing. Nothing happened. He's okay. Sort of. It's just... I don't know. It's a really tough time right now, you know. He's inpatient. And I think he feels frustrated. And I feel like there's nothing I can do to help him.", "Frank: Well, you're doing everything you can do. I mean, he's a very lucky guy and I think he knows that.", "Marina: Honestly, I think sometimes he just wishes I go away. You know, I think... I think I make him feel guilty, like he's keeping me from having a life.", "Frank: Well...", "Marina: Dad.", "Frank: Sweetheart, I'm totally getting the impression that you are carrying the entire weight of the world on your shoulders. I really can't even remember the last time I saw you smile. Besides, your mom and I, well...", "Marina: You talked to Mom?", "Frank: Yeah, I did. She's a little concerned about you. She hasn't heard from you. You know, you're supposed to call her every Sunday? Well, you've missed two in a row.", "Marina: Yeah, I don't think Mom really understands what it's like to put someone else first.", "Frank: I think that's a little harsh.", "Marina: Is it?", "Frank: Yes. And I also think that there's something else going on besides what's happening with Shayne right now. And I would really like to help you.", "Marina: I wish that you could.", "Frank: Then let me.", "Marina: Daddy... no. Just not here. Just not right now, okay?", "Frank: Marina, it's not healthy to keep things bottled up inside. You've got to get it out, okay? Now, whether you tell me or Aunt Harley or your grandfather, you're never going to figure out something. You're never going to resolve anything if you don't get it out or keep something a secret.", "(Beeper beeps)", "Frank: I've got to get to the station. Well, at least I got to see that pretty, little face, right? Tell everybody I said \u0091hello.' And if I have some free time then I'll come back and see Shayne, all right?", "Marina: Yeah. Uh, Dad, thanks. You really do help.", "Frank: You're my little girl.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Knock at the door)", "Edmund: Cassie?", "Cassie: It's open. You know, I don't think I'm going to be able to do lunch, because I have so much more work up here than I thought I had. So it's going to have to wait.", "Edmund: Cassie, we're not going to have lunch. And you're not going to work. We're going to sit down here and we're going to talk about the child you lost in San Cristobel.", "Cassie: We've already had this discussion.", "Edmund: But we need to have it again.", "Cassie: This is silly.", "Edmund: Is this?", "Cassie: Look, I'm just upset for Olivia. That's all.", "Edmund: Cassie, you're right. Look at me. Look at me, Cassie. You're right. We've talked about this before, but not very well, and clearly not enough, because it's still an issue. This is an issue, isn't it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Okay, so now listen to me. I've scheduled an appointment with a specialist for later today, and hopefully he'll be able to tell us a little bit more about what's going on with you and then we can...", "Shayne: Yeah, Mom, can... If I look good to you it must be the lights, 'cause I'm a little shot. Can we do this later?", "Reva: Oh. Okay. That's fine. I'll just get out of your hair.", "Sandy: Yeah, I'll go, too.", "Reva: See you, sweetie.", "Shayne: Marina, stay for a second.", "Sandy: This is tough, watching him go through this.", "Reva: All this family stuff is kind of painful, huh?", "Sandy: I wish I could help.", "Reva: You know, in a funny way, I think you do. Shayne likes having another brother.", "Nico: Hey.", "Reva: Hi, Nico.", "Nico: How's Shayne doing?", "Reva: He's tired.", "Nico: Did something happen?", "Sandy: You know what? I'm going to go. I'll check in later.", "Reva: Oh, okay. Sandy, thanks.", "Nico: Is everything okay, Mrs. Lewis?", "Reva: Yeah, yeah, Nico. Everything's fine. But can you do me a favor? Tell Marina that I had to go to work for a little bit. Thanks.", "Nico: Sure. No problem.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: I thought you wanted to sleep.", "Shayne: I need to say something to you.", "Marina: About?", "Shayne: About getting used to the way that things are.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Yes, this is Joshua Lewis in the Cumberland Suite. Please hold all my calls until further notice. Yes, all of them. Especially if Billy Lewis calls. If he insists on being put through, you tell him I'm not to be disturbed. Thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bartender: Something I can get you, Mr. Lewis?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Christopher: Oh, sorry. Sorry.", "Olivia: I'm sorry.", "Christopher: No, here. Let me. Let me.", "Olivia: No, let go. I guess you caught me.", "Christopher: Caught you doing what?", "Olivia: Returning some gifts from my baby shower. I just figured it's time, you know. It's time to let go and get on with things. The past is the past, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Cassie, every time I bring up the accident, you slough it off. You claim it's a non-issue, or you change the subject.", "Cassie: Aren't you happy? I mean, aren't we happy here?", "Edmund: Which is exactly why we have to get to the heart of it, because we are happy.", "Cassie: That doesn't make any sense.", "Edmund: Cassie. Cassie, we love each other. Right now we're in the first flush of that realization. But the fact remains, your baby died and I was a part of it.", "Cassie: I never denied that, Edmund.", "Edmund: I know. I know. But the question... Cassie, Cassie! The question is whether you have fully acknowledged your feelings about it, and I don't think you have. As long as that bitterness, that anger, that... whatever it is stays inside of you, it festers. It grows. And believe me, I know how corrosive those feelings can be. And it will destroy us, Cassie. It will. Not today, not tomorrow, but someday. And there is no doubt about that.", "Cassie: You know why I can't do this, why I keep those feelings buried? If we get to the heart of it, Edmund, and I let those feelings out, I can't promise you that I can put them away again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: About getting used to the way what things are?", "Shayne: The way things are going to be for you and me if this doesn't work out, if I don't walk again. Look, I know what I felt today. I know what I felt. There's nothing.", "Marina: Okay. I hate it when you do this.", "Shayne: This is not the worst thing that can happen.", "Marina: But I hate it when you get it all calm and resigned to your fate. Okay, so please don't do this right now, don't do this to us.", "Shayne: To us? I'm the one laying here in the bed.", "Marina: No, us. We are both in this thing together. Yeah, I want you to be ticked off. You know what? I want you to be so angry that the anger alone is going to get you up out of that chair.", "Shayne: You're just dreaming.", "Marina: Yeah, you're damn right I am. I want you to be the guy on this tape again. I need you to be.", "Shayne: It might not happen.", "Marina: I didn't fall in love with a quitter. I fell in love with a guy who is going to keep pushing, who is going to never give up. So why don't you look at yourself before you decide how this thing is going to turn out?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Butch: Buzz, my man.", "Buzz: Butch. What? The bike's ready? I didn't expect you for another week.", "Butch: I work fast on the sweet rides.", "Buzz: Well, I guess you're going to want a check, huh?", "Butch: I'd say take it out for a spin, but I don't know if I'd ever see you again. That baby is primed for some serious cruising.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Phone rings)", "Ed: Dr. Bauer. What? No, I can't... I can't come in right now. I've got to... I know you're short-staffed, but look, I... try someone else. Have you tried... talked to Doctor... Oh, fine. I'll be there. I'll be there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: You know, you're slipping. You're looking at me like a shrink instead of a friend.", "Christopher: I'd be concerned no matter which hat I was wearing. We can talk if you'd like.", "Olivia: No. You know what? I think I've kind of OD'd on talking about this today.", "Christopher: This?", "Olivia: This. I wanted... I wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed having dinner with you.", "Christopher: So did I. You seemed a little more relaxed.", "Olivia: That's very observant.", "Christopher: (Laughs)", "Olivia: Listen, can I ask you a favor?", "Christopher: Sure. Go ahead.", "Olivia: Could you give me a heads up if it looks like Lizzie's going to come after me again?", "Christopher: (Sighs) Olivia...", "Olivia: I know. I know. I know she's your patient. And I know that there are ethics involved. It's just that you warned me the night that she put that doll's head in my baby crib.
