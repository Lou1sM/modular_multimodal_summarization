        "Ben: You are the best. Thank you. ",
        "Michelle: No problem, no problem. Just have fun, okay? ",
        "Ben: Okay. ",
        "Michelle: I've got to go to work. ",
        "Bill: What? You look like you just won the lottery. ",
        "Ben: Close. That ski trip I keep saying we should take? I just asked Michelle \r\nif we could use the Bauer cabin, and she said, \"Go for it.\" The trip is on! Hey, \r\ncall Beth. We'll all go together.",
        "Bill: Ah, I got a news flash for you, Benny. Beth and I are pretty much \r\nhistory. ",
        "Ben: What? ",
        "Bill: Yeah. ",
        "Ben: Why? ",
        "Bill: Um, just... You know, it just wasn't working out. ",
        "Ben: Hey, even more reason to make the trip. I mean, this is the perfect \r\nopportunity for a rebound. ",
        "Bill: What? ",
        "Ben: Well, isn't there some girl you want to impress with a little ski \r\nweekend? ",
        "Bill: No one who's not already taken. ",
        "",
        "Buzz: What's wrong? ",
        "Alexandra: I just came from Cedars. Alan's had a heart attack-- a minor one, \r\nthank God. ",
        "Buzz: Well, that's what he gets for marrying such a young woman. ",
        "Alexandra: You don't know the half of it. ",
        "Buzz: You're really worried. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, I should be, huh? I helped put him in that hospital.",
        "",
        "Josh: All right, get him on the couch. ",
        "Tony: Easy, easy, easy. Oh. Oh, man. ",
        "Billy: Maybe this isn't as bad as it feels. ",
        "Tony: Oh, no, no, no. It definitely is, it definitely is. But you know what? \r\nIt's not your fault. ",
        "Josh: We better get an ice pack on that shoulder, huh? ",
        "Billy: Man, you really stepped in it this time. ",
        "Josh: What are you talking about, Billy? Listen, I reset that bow to a normal \r\ntension. It was an accident, and Tony knows it. ",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, I'm not talking about Tony here. I'm talking about Marah.\r\n",
        "Josh: Why Marah? ",
        "Billy: Because Marah's going to be on the warpath when she finds out about \r\nthis. You busted her boyfriend. ",
        "Josh: Oh, man.",

        "Holly: Good. You're here. ",
        "Reva: Well, of course I am. You're my boss. I'm going to be where you ask me \r\nto be. What's on your mind? ",
        "Holly: Ratings-- what else? Not that your show isn't doing well, but I had a \r\nbrainstorm that could give you an even larger audience. ",
        "Reva: A story idea? ",
        "Holly: An investigative piece on the Spaulding\u2019s. An in-depth story on the \r\nfamily, the business, the whole works. It's right up your alley. ",
        "Reva: Well, why the Spaulding\u2019s? And why now? ",
        "Holly: Because there's even more going on right there than usual. Alex comes \r\nback to town, takes over the company. It raises all kinds of questions. ",
        "Reva: Like what she's really up to. ",
        "Holly: Yeah. That's why I want you on the story. (cell phone rings) ",
        "Reva: Uh, so what were you thinking? Like a multi-part series? (cell phone \r\nringing) ",
        "Holly: Don't you want to answer that? ",
        "Reva: No. ",
        "Holly: Why not? Go ahead. ",
        "Reva: Because I don't want to answer it. ",
        "Holly: Okay. ",
        "",
        "Ben: You must be pretty bummed. I mean, Beth seemed like she's pretty into \r\nyou. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, we both moved on. But not into some heavy commitment-- at \r\nleast, you know, I'm not. I'm just going to hang out, play the field for a \r\nwhile. ",
        "Ben: Great, great. Then scrounge up a date and come skiing with us. Hey. Hey. \r\nWhat says \"no commitment\" more than a weekend on the slopes, huh? ",
        "Bill: You know what? You're starting to sound like an ad for a singles \r\nresort, you know that? It's scary. Besides, who's \"us,\" anyway, huh? You and \r\nsome little sorority sister you conned into going away with you? ",
        "Ben: I resent that. ",
        "Bill: Do you? ",
        "Marina: Please tell me that you scored us a place to stay. ",
        "Bill: You're bringing Marina? ",
        "Marina: Well, yeah. It's going to be a blast. Come on. ",
        "Ben: Yeah, well, you know, it was her idea, so... ",
        "Bill: Yeah. And you're going to get her dad to go along with that how? ",
        "Marina: We're working on it. ",
        "Marah: Hey, did you see a... I thought I left it here. What's going on with \r\nBen and Marina? ",
        "Bill: They're just trying to figure out a way to fly below Frank's radar. ",
        "Marah: Want to try that one again? ",
        "Bill: I don't know, do I? Ben, he talked Michelle into letting them use the \r\nBauer cabin, you know, for a ski trip, and he wants Marina to go with him. ",
        "Marah: Oh. ",
        "Bill: Yeah. How they're going to get away with that, I have no idea. He just \r\nasked me to go with them, probably as a smokescreen, but... Why don't you go \r\nwith Tony? ",
        "Marah: Yeah, Tony\u2019s not really a winter sports kind of guy. We tried skating \r\nonce. It was pretty bad. ",
        "Bill: Oh. ",
        "Marah: Besides, he's hunting with our two dads. ",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. What? You're kidding me. And you let him go alone? \r\nYou're either a very brave girl, or you're just plain crazy. ",
        "Marah: Well, I was not happy about it, believe me, but my dad insisted, and \r\nTony swore that he could handle it. ",
        "Bill: Wow. A Lewis-Santos male bonding event, with weapons. That's a winter \r\nsport for you. ",
        "Marah: No, everything will be fine. ",
        "Bill: Really? ",
        "Marah: Yeah. ",
        "Bill: And how long have you been living in the land of denial? Don't you at \r\nleast want to go up there, you know, maybe help move things along? I mean, \r\nyou've got to be curious, if not worried. ",
        "Marah: I am kind of tempted to see how they're doing. And you know what? Mom \r\nhas always told me to trust my instincts. ",
        "Bill: Then you should go, and have a nice trip. ",
        "Marah: Yeah, and my instincts are also telling me that there's something \r\nbothering you. ",
        "Bill: Ah, you know what? I owe someone an explanation for the way I acted the \r\nother night, and I just keep putting it off. ",
        "Marah: All right. Well, how about we make a deal? I will go check on Tony and \r\nmake sure he's okay, and you do the same with Beth. ",
        "Bill: Well, it's not Beth I\u2019m talking about. It's someone else. ",
        "Marah: Who? ",
        "Bill: You know what? We should probably get on out of here, because we have a \r\ndeal to close, don't we? ",
        "Marah: Yes, we do. ",
        "",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Buzz. My family's going through such an upheaval lately. You \r\nknow, when I came back to Springfield, I had hoped I could restore some sense of \r\norder, but it seems like so far, all I've done is make things worse. ",
        "Buzz: Well, maybe things are so tangled up, you can't smooth them out. ",
        "Alexandra: No. I refuse to believe that. ",
        "Buzz: What has got you so worked up? ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on, come on, Buzz. You wouldn't stand by and let your \r\nfamily go to hell in a hand basket and do nothing. How can I sit back idly when \r\nmy family's going to face a major crisis? ",
        "Buzz: What kind of crisis are we talking about? ",
        "Alexandra: Look, there's something that nobody knows about, and it's very \r\nserious, and if word gets around before I\u2019ve had a chance to prepare the family, \r\nwell, it could tear the Spaulding\u2019s apart permanently. All right, you... You \r\ndon't tell a word about this. Not a soul, huh? ",

        "(cell phone ringing)",
        "Holly: Come on. It could be one of your kids. ",
        "Reva: I said I don't want to answer it. ",
        "Holly: What... ",
        "Reva: So you were telling me about this story, about the Spaulding\u2019s making \r\nme a ratings queen of Springfield. ",
        "Holly: Well, the Spaulding\u2019s are like royalty in Springfield. The public is \r\nfascinated with every step they make. ",
        "Reva: Right. Nothing like a little money and power to command attention. ",
        "Holly: Right. Ever since Alexandra came back to town, took over the company, \r\nwe've been flooded with station e-mails, letters. Everybody wants to know why, \r\nwhat's up, what's behind this. ",
        "Reva: And you want me to find out. ",
        "Holly: Aren't you curious? ",
        "Reva: Well, yeah, I have had some questions about why she came back to \r\nSpringfield now. Why not last year, or never again? ",
        "Holly: The obvious answer is Alan\u2019s heart attack, but there might be more to \r\nit than that. ",
        "Reva: There's always something lurking under the surface when you're dealing \r\nwith the Spaulding\u2019s. ",
        "Holly: And you are the best digger I know. ",
        "Reva: Okay! Why not? It does sound like my kind of story. ",
        "Holly: Just one thing concerns me. You and Alex aren't on the best of terms.\r\n",
        "Reva: Oh, that's not a problem. That'll make it more fun. ",

        "Bill: Michelle. ",
        "Michelle: Bill. ",
        "Bill: Wait. Don't say anything, okay? I've been trying to figure out a way to \r\nput this the whole way up here, and if I don't just get the words out, they're \r\ngoing to come out wrong. ",
        "Michelle: What? What? ",
        "Bill: My apology for kissing you. It never should have happened. ",
        "Michelle: You're talking about New Year's Eve. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, and Halloween, too, but mostly the other night. I mean, I was \r\ntotally out of line. ",
        "Michelle: Bill... ",
        "Bill: No, please, Michelle let me finish, okay? Everything that I said to you \r\nabout wishing things could be different for us and then kissing you, I just \r\nwasn't thinking clearly. You know, after the craziness with Carmen, and plus \r\njust being so relieved that you were okay, I just... I wasn't thinking. And I'm \r\nsorry. ",
        "Michelle: It's okay. ",
        "Bill: No. Michelle, it's not. I mean, it's not like you had enough to deal \r\nwith already. I mean, you had Carmen laying there on your floor, and she came so \r\nclose to hurting you and taking Robbie. Plus you got Danny coming over and...\r\n",
        "Michelle: Well, about Danny... ",
        "Bill: Michelle, please, there's nothing to explain, really. I know how things \r\nare with you and Danny. ",
        "Michelle: You do? ",
        "Bill: Yeah. I came by the next morning. ",
        "Michelle: To the house? ",
        "Bill: Yeah. In fact, the door was open, and I saw you two. I didn't want to \r\ndisturb you. Actually, you were kissing. Now, that kiss, that kiss I understand, \r\nbut it just... It makes me sick thinking of how lousy it was of me to try to \r\npull something like that with you, and I just... I... ",
        "Michelle: Bill, don't be so hard on yourself. ",
        "Bill: Michelle, please. It was a huge mistake on my part, okay, kissing you \r\nat all. And what, it takes me, like, a whole day to even cop to it? That's just \r\nnot right. ",
        "Michelle: Look, what you saw between me and Danny wasn\u2019t... ",
        "Bill: Is all I need to know, okay? You guys are together. In fact, you know, \r\nyou belong together. ",
        "Michelle: You think so? ",
        "Bill: Well, sure. And for me to make you think otherwise, that's just... \r\nThat's low, Michelle. I mean, we've been friends too long for me not to get this \r\nstraight with you, and Michelle, please, I... ",
        "Michelle: Bill. ",
        "Bill: I don't want to lose your friendship, all right? And I could see that \r\nhappening. I could see you writing me off, not answering my calls, once it sinks \r\nin that I just... ",
        "Michelle: Bill, I\u2019m not with Danny anymore. ",
        "Bill: What? ",

        "Josh: Come on. Just give me a signal here, will you, please? Modern \r\ntechnology at its best. ",
        "Marah: Got a problem? ",
        "Josh: Marah. Hi. What are you doing here? ",
        "Marah: I came to make sure the place was still standing, among other things. \r\nWhere's Tony? ",
        "Josh: You shouldn't be here. I mean, you know, you shouldn't have driven up \r\nhere on your own. These roads are terrible in this kind of weather. ",
        "Marah: The roads were fine. ",
        "Josh: Really? ",
        "Marah: So... ",
        "Josh: Wait, wait, wait. You should have called. ",
        "Marah: I thought that you weren't getting any service. ",
        "Josh: We just don't need you here. I mean, we don't need your help here, you \r\nknow, if that's what you were thinking. ",
        "Marah: Well, I didn't see any smoke coming out of the chimney. I don't smell \r\nany food cooking. ",
        "Josh: Yeah. Well, we just got back. ",
        "Marah: Well, why is that? There's still a lot of daylight left. I thought \r\nyou'd be using as much as you could to torture Tony. ",
        "Josh: Funny. ",
        "Marah: Did I say \"torture\"? I meant, teach him your famous Lewis hunting \r\ntips. So, did you guys have any luck out there? ",
        "Josh: No, not really. ",
        "Marah: Well, I guess I didn't miss much, then. All right. Well, I decided \r\nthat I was going to come by and not stand on the sidelines while you did your \r\nlittle hazing ritual to Tony, or whatever it is. ",
        "Josh: Marah, it's just a hunting trip, that's all. ",
        "Marah: Right. Well, we'll see what Tony says about that. ",
        "Josh: Yeah. Listen, you seem to think that Billy and I had some kind of \r\nsecret agenda where Tony\u2019s concerned, and there's some truth to that, but the \r\nfact is, Tony and I had a nice little chat. We talked about a few things, and \r\nthat's the whole point of this trip, really, right? And I would like to continue \r\nthat process, and I think it would be best to do that with just me and Tony, you \r\nknow, so it's sort of a one-on-one thing. ",
        "Marah: Oh, as in, without me here. ",
        "Josh: Well, it's not that you're not welcome here. It's just that it's sort \r\nof a special time for us, you know? It's a bonding thing. So why don't you \r\nleave? I mean, why don't you just, you know, go ahead and hop in the car and \r\nhead back to town, huh? ",
        "Marah: Okay. ",
        "Josh: Good. Okay. ",

        "Ben: Would you chill? Your dad is right over there. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, I know. So what? ",
        "Ben: Yeah, yeah, but he's not exactly, you know, crazy about the idea that \r\nwe're together. ",
        "Marina: All right. The hardest part of this trip was what, finding a place \r\nthat we could actually afford, and you did that brilliantly with Michelle\u2019s \r\ncabin. Now, you let me handle the whole family aspect, okay? ",
        "Ben: How? ",
        "Marina: Well, they trust me now, so watch. Daddy? Okay, I have a really, \r\nreally, really, really huge favor to ask you. ",
        "Frank: No. What's this? Total ski package here. The closest I've ever come to \r\na ski slope was watching the Olympics. ",
        "Marina: Oh. Um, yeah. You see, it's not exactly like it's a family thing, you \r\nknow? It's more just like a bunch of kids are going. ",
        "Frank: What bunch, and what kids? ",
        "Marina: Well, okay, every year, Ben\u2019s fraternity plans this whole, like, ski \r\nweekend thing. ",
        "Frank: Ben. College kids? ",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, there are going to be chaperones there. ",
        "Frank: Adult chaperones? ",
        "Marina: Dad, I thought only adults could be chaperones. Anyway, it's really \r\npretty cool. I mean, like, the whole thing's going to be for charity. ",
        "Frank: For charity? Really? ",
        "Marina: Yeah. It's like it's... It's like this ski-a-thon thing. You know, \r\npeople pledge \"x\" amount of dollars for every run you do. ",
        "Frank: Ski-a-thon? Not a bad idea. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, it sounded like a good idea to me, too. ",
        "Frank: You mentioned Ben\u2019s fraternity is going to be there. So, does that \r\nmean that Ben\u2019s going, too? ",
        "Marina: Yeah, of course he's going to be there. But it's not like we're going \r\ntogether, you know? It's like we're just going to happen to be there at the same \r\ntime. Daddy, is this what it's going to be like for the rest of my life? Every \r\ntime I want to do something, we've got to go through this whole, like, police \r\ninterrogation kind of thing? I mean, where is the trust? ",
        "Frank: The trust, young lady, went out the window when you started faking \r\nI.D.\u2019s, going to bars, hanging out with the wrong crowd. ",
        "Marina: Yeah. Okay, that's fair, that's fair, that's fair. But haven\u2019t... \r\nHaven't I been really good lately? I mean, haven't I proven to you that I have \r\nheard your concerns, and I've adjusted my behavior accordingly? ",
        "Frank: Yes, you've been much better. ",
        "Marina: Okay. So there's no reason to say no. ",
        "Frank: I don't know, sweetie. I'm just not getting a good feeling about this.\r\n",
        "Marina: You don't get a good feeling about anything unless I\u2019m here washing \r\ndishes until my hands crack. It's just not fair. You know, I have more than \r\nserved my time for all of that junk I did wrong, and now it's like you're \r\npunishing me for things I haven't even done yet. Oh, Daddy, please. Please give \r\nme a chance to show you there's nothing to worry about. Come on, please. Please? \r\nCome on. Come on. We're buddies. Please? ",

        "Edmund: Oh, God, this again. ",
        "Reva: Still. And now you've added my cell phone number to your rotation. \r\nHowever, it is an unlisted number, but that wouldn't stop you from torturing \r\nsomebody. ",

        "Reva: I don't understand this. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, it seems quite simple to me that you're accusing Edmund of \r\nsomething he simply didn't do. I mean, I realize he has certain very special \r\ntalents, but I don't think ventriloquism is among them. ",
        "Edmund: No. Not even working on it. What's the matter, Reva? Reality not \r\ncooperating with presumption? ",
        "Alexandra: Yes. I think she's picked you because you're simply an easy \r\ntarget. But think of all the people, Reva, who want to take pot-shots at you. \r\nOh, I'm sure the list is very long in this town. I mean, all the people you've \r\nmanipulated, left behind, so Reva Shayne could go ahead to do the next and best \r\nthing for her. You know, if you really want to know who your enemies are, I \r\nsuggest you just thumb through the local phone book. Nolan? ",
        "Nolan: Yes, ma'am? ",

        "Nolan: Right this way. ",
        "Reva: I'm going to go ahead with my story. ",

        "Michelle: Because you saw us kissing? It was an intense moment. You know how \r\nthose things go. But the hard, sad truth is, as much as I love Danny, I just \r\nrealized that things weren't going to be different enough, weren't going to be \r\nsafe enough. ",
        "Bill: For Robbie. ",
        "Michelle: For me, too. I couldn't live with that kind of uncertainty anymore. \r\nSo I ended it. ",
        "Bill: Michelle, I ended it with Beth, too. ",
        "Michelle: What? Why? ",
        "Bill: Just because, you know, we'd taken it as far as it could go, and we \r\nboth wanted different things. Well, so, here we are, a couple of newly single \r\ntypes. ",
        "Michelle: So, are you okay? ",
        "Bill: Yeah, I guess. But you know what would really help? How about a little \r\nski weekend, huh? You want to go? ",
        "Michelle: Oh, skiing? ",
        "Bill: Yeah, skiing with Ben up at your parents' cabin up there. Come on, \r\nit'll be great. ",
        "Michelle: To go away for the weekend. ",
        "Bill: Michelle, don't you think that's maybe what you need right now, a \r\nlittle break from everything? You know, a little day on the slopes, and then at \r\nnight just sitting in front of the fire, sipping on a little hot chocolate \r\nspiked with, you know, whatever. Sound good? ",
        "Michelle: It might, sometime. But, you know, right now I don't even know \r\nwhere my head is. I just... I... Until I do, I need to keep things simple. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, sure. Of course. I mean, I just thought it might be a little fun, \r\nyou know, like when we hung out on Mystic Island, right? ",

        "Bill: Come on, it's me, Bill. You know? No pressure. ",

        "Marah: A joke? A really funny joke, because he could have been killed. I hope \r\nyou guys are proud of yourselves. Give me that. Can you move it? ",
        "Tony: No, not a whole lot. Marah, look, it wasn't their fault, okay? I was \r\ninto this hunting thing for real. And then, you know, look, your dad and I, we \r\nhad a really nice talk, and then afterwards, I was, you, what the hell, let's go \r\nsee if there's any deer out there. ",
        "Josh: Yeah. He's actually been a very good sport. And he's right, we did. We \r\nhad a nice talk. ",
        "Marah: Well, I'm glad. But right now you need to go down the hill to see if \r\nyou can get service, and call Rick Bauer and tell him that I'm going to bring \r\nTony to go see him as soon as I get back. ",

        "Alexandra: And what would make you say that? ",
        "Edmund: The expression on your face when I just said that. You insist your \r\nmission in Springfield is to get the Spaulding\u2019s back on track. But there's \r\nnothing shameful or worth hiding about that, so all of this is happening on \r\nanother level, and it's information on that level you don't want to be \r\ndiscovered. ",
