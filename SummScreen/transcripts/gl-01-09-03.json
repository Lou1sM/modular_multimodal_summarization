        "Harley: Hey. ",
        "Gus: Hey. So, did you find anything? ",
        "Harley: Well, your dad's partner didn't make any calls from home before he \r\nskipped town. ",
        "Gus: Right. Along with all the fancy shoes and whatever else you found in his \r\napartment. ",
        "Harley: Listen, I've got a watch on all of his credit cards and his bank \r\naccounts. If he makes a move, we'll get him. And when we do, we'll get the truth \r\nabout your dad. ",
        "Gus: I know the truth. It's the facts that I don't like. My dad died a hero. \r\n(sighs) Go ahead, say it. ",
        "Harley: Say what? ",
        "Gus: That I\u2019m kidding myself, I'm kidding myself. All the facts point to the \r\nfact that my father was a dirty cop, so... ",
        "Harley: Well, I like the truth better. And you know what? Joe August was and \r\nalways will be your hero. That's all that matters. ",
        "Gus: No, it's not all that matters. It's why I got to keep digging. I've got \r\nto keep digging. ",
        "Josh: Harley. ",
        "Harley: Hey. ",
        "Josh: Hi, Gus. Listen, I'm sorry to interrupt. I called headquarters. They \r\ntold me I could find you here. ",
        "Harley: Okay, what's up? ",
        "Josh: I... I need your help. I think Reva's in danger. (Monitor beeping) ",
        "",
        "Rick: All right, we'll get you a bed in the cardiac unit, Alan, as soon as \r\npossible. ",
        "Alan: I don't need a bed. I shouldn't be here anyway. I'm going to... (\r\nGrunting) ",
        "Rick: What... what... What are you doing, Alan? ",
        "Alan: I'm getting... I'm getting out of here, Rick. I... ",
        "Rick: Alan... Alan, you had a cardiac episode, all right, on the back of \r\nhaving two heart attacks last fall. This is not a joke, Alan. You are going to \r\nstay here, and you are going to get treated. And when you go home, you're going \r\nto make some changes in your life, Alan, like no cigars, no cognac, and no more \r\nstress. Do you got it? ",
        "Reva: Good luck on that one. Hi, Alan. ",
        "",
        "Phillip: Oh, you knew exactly what you were doing! ",
        "Alexandra: Calm down, calm down. I know how this looks, Phillip, but I was \r\ncaught in the middle. ",
        "Phillip: Yes! Because you put yourself in the middle! ",
        "Alexandra: No, I didn't want either you or Alan to get hurt. Now, what was I \r\nsupposed to do? ",
        "Phillip: You were supposed to tell me, Aunt Alex. You were supposed to say, \r\n\"Phillip, your father hasn't really had a heart attack. It's just a trick. He \r\njust wants to scare you and Olivia and pay you back.\" That's what you were \r\nsupposed to do. ",
        "Alexandra: I couldn't do that. ",
        "Phillip: Yeah, because you had other plans. ",
        "Alexandra: No... no, my only... Look, my only plan was to keep you and Alan \r\nfrom killing each other. I hated keeping quiet. I did it out of love.",
        "",
        "Olivia: Let me guess. Alan got a court order to have the name of my martini \r\nbar changed and have me evicted from my room. ",
        "Cassie: No, we haven't got that one yet. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, then it's a good day so far. ",
        "Cassie: Olivia, what are you going to do? ",
        "Olivia: I don't know, Cassie. Maybe I'll take a walk or something. ",
        "Cassie: About the hotel. I do not want Alan for a partner in the Beacon. ",
        "Olivia: I don't want that anymore than you do. What do you want me to do? ",
        "Cassie: Well, you made it happen. You go fix it. ",
        "Olivia: Fix it? How would you like me to fix it? ",
        "Cassie: I don't care. Go beg for his forgiveness. Go grovel if you have to.\r\n",
        "Olivia: Uh-uh. No way. He's the one... ",
        "Cassie: I don't care who did it, okay? I don't care who did it. I don't care \r\nabout your pride. Hell, I don't even care if you're happy. I am not going to let \r\nyour personal problems ruin what we built here. ",

        "(Monitor beeping) ",
        "Alan: What are you doing here, Reva? ",
        "Reva: Can't I come visit a sick friend? ",
        "Alan: Rick, make sure all the scalpels are locked away. ",
        "Rick: Are you here to cut into Alan, Reva? ",
        "Reva: I wouldn't dream of it. ",
        "Rick: Well, maybe you could talk some sense into him. All right, Alan, I got \r\nrounds, but I'm going to have a nurse staying right outside the door. If you \r\nmake the heart rate peak just once, then you're going to be here for a week. You \r\ngot it? ",
        "Alan: Hmm, you're giving me orders? ",
        "Rick: That's right. ",
        "Alan: I knew you before you even had a driver's license, much less a license \r\nto practice medicine. ",
        "Rick: He's all yours. ",
        "Reva: Thanks. Somehow, I knew you'd be a model patient. ",
        "Alan: I repeat, Reva, what are you doing here? ",
        "Reva: I came to check on an old buddy. ",
        "Alan: Whatever you want, the answer is no. ",
        "Reva: Okay, then I'll go. ",
        "Alan: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sorry, that was rude. ",
        "Reva: And you're a little short on visitors, so why get rid of me? ",
        "Alan: They won't even let me read the stock report. ",
        "Reva: Well, can't Olivia smuggle them in for you? Where is she anyway? ",
        "Alan: Now you can leave. ",
        "Reva: Alan. ",
        "Alan: Don't pretend that your sister didn't tell you the dirt about me \r\ntossing Olivia out of the house. ",
        "Reva: She hasn't. So you tossed Olivia out. I'm sorry. I really thought she \r\nwas the one for you. And I was kind of afraid that after Annie Dutton, there \r\nwouldn't be another woman who would get to you the way she did. (Monitor \r\nbeeping faster) ",
        "",
        "Josh: So Reva's just going on with her day like there's nothing wrong, you \r\nknow, there's no problem, but I know better. ",
        "Harley: Okay, and these calls just started? ",
        "Josh: Well, they actually started before Christmas. We had the phone number \r\nchanged, again and somehow they got a hold of that number. Then we installed a \r\ncaller I.D. box, hoping to screen the calls. Then they started coming in on her \r\ncell phone, which is also a private number. ",
        "Gus: So when you... When you installed the caller I.D., did you capture a \r\nnumber? ",
        "Josh: No, no. It said \"private caller,\" and we stopped picking up after the \r\nfirst one. Oh, and this is a list that I brought of the dates and times of the \r\ncalls, both at home and on the cell phone. ",
        "Gus: I love an organized victim. So these times... ",
        "Josh: The times are approximate. The dates are solid. ",
        "Harley: Well, I\u2019ll get the phone company started on this. They have her cell \r\nphone number? ",
        "Josh: Yeah. ",
        "Gus: Well, then it's somebody close or a pro. ",
        "Harley: Anyone you can think of who'd want to do this? ",
        "Josh: Well, at first we thought it might be Edmund Winslow. But then a call \r\ncame in on Reva's cell phone when she was standing there right next to him. ",
        "Harley: Well, he could have rigged it that way. ",
        "Josh: I... I don't think so. He had no way of knowing that he was going to be \r\nwith her at that moment. ",
        "Gus: All right, so we don't rule out Winslow. But who else? Anybody else? ",
        "Josh: Well, there's always this possibility. Annie Dutton. ",
        "Gus: Who's Annie Dutton? ",
        "Josh: She's a woman who's pretty much crazy and has been obsessed with Reva \r\nfor some time. ",
        "Harley: Josh and Annie were married when Reva first came back, and Annie, who \r\nwas never the most stable woman in the world, she snapped. She accused Reva of \r\ncausing her miscarriage. She had her tried for the murder. And at one point, she \r\neven tried to kill her. ",
        "Gus: Ooh. ",
        "Harley: Do you have any idea where Annie is? ",
        "Josh: No. I was hoping you could help us with that. That's something we need \r\nto do. We need to find her. ",
        "Harley: Yeah, we do. ",
        "Gus: Well, look, I'll go down to the station and get to work on this. I'll \r\nstart with a trace of all those numbers. Give me the numbers. ",
        "Harley: Okay. Just... Give me... Give me just one second. I want to talk to \r\nyou for a second. Um, you sure you want to do this? Wouldn't you rather do the \r\nfollow-up on your dad's case? ",
        "Gus: Okay, it's my job. ",
        "Harley: I can handle. ",
        "Gus: Cooper, you don't have to cover for me, okay? ",
        "Harley: I'm not. I just know it will eat you alive until you get some \r\ninformation about your dad. So why don't you let me handle this? ",
        "Gus: Fine. Fine. I'll start digging into my father's finances. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. Do you have any of your dad's old paperwork? ",
        "Gus: I do, but if he's dirty... I just can't believe those words are coming \r\nout of my mouth. ",
        "Harley: Okay, listen, you just... You check on any stuff that your dad \r\nwouldn't have just lying around. You know what I mean? ",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'm going to look into offshore accounts... ",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. ",
        "Gus: ...Hidden investments. ",
        "Harley: Exactly. You can run with that for a couple of hours, but then I'm \r\ntaking you to Olivia's bar, and we are getting drinks, just you and me, by \r\nourselves, no business. Okay? ",
        "Gus: Yeah, deal. Thank you. Bye, Josh. ",
        "Harley: Okay. Well, Gus has a whole other assignment he's got to work on. ",
        "Josh: Harley, I need help. I need help now, not two months from now. ",
        "Harley: And you have it. You have me until we get some answers, okay? So, \r\nbesides Edmund Winslow and Annie Dutton, who else would have it in for Reva? ",
        "",
        "Phillip: Love? You let me twist with guilt for something that I hadn't done. \r\nAnd that was you loving me? ",
        "Alexandra: All right, it seemed like the best alternative at the time. Come \r\non, if I had told you what Alan was up to, you two would have been at each \r\nother's throats. You might have been off with Olivia by... That seemed like a \r\nworse alternative at the time. ",
        "Phillip: And you got to make that decision for us? ",
        "Alexandra: I didn't look at it that way. ",
        "Phillip: Right, because you weren't looking at anything except taking the \r\ncompany. Why, God, can't you just be honest about that much? You knew he faked \r\nthe heart attack, you had the leverage you needed, and you used it. It's okay. \r\nIt's the Spaulding way! ",
        "Alexandra: All right... ",
        "Phillip: I would just like to hear you say it! ",
        "Alexandra: Would you believe that possibly my taking over the company had a \r\ngreat deal to do with protecting you, too? ",
        "Phillip: Oh, God, it's too much. ",
        "Alexandra: No, Phillip, I know you can't take it now. ",
        "Phillip: It's just too much. ",
        "Alexandra: I know. ",
        "Phillip: But what? But there's going to be... There'll be some magical time \r\nin the future where it all makes perfect sense to me? Are you really going to \r\ntry to sell me that now? ",
        "Alexandra: Phillip, I\u2019m sorry. ",
        "Phillip: You're what? ",
        "Alexandra: I'm sorry. I could have... I should have told you what Alan was up \r\nto. Company, no company, whatever happened with Olive, I... (sighs)... I \r\nshouldn't have kept quiet. ",
        "Phillip: So, what is this now, a strategic retreat? ",
        "Alexandra: No, no. ",
        "Phillip: Well, yes, God, yes. Of course it is. Because you knew what you were \r\ndoing while you were doing it. Now you just need to work me now, so... ",
        "Alexandra: No, no, Phillip, Phillip... ",
        "Phillip: I'm... I'm starting to remember. ",
        "Alexandra: Remember what? ",
        "Phillip: Why I left this house! Why I never wanted to be here for most of my \r\nlife! How did I forget? How did I talk myself into believing that this would be \r\nokay? The manipulating and the lies and everybody out for themselves, and not \r\nbeing able to believe a word out of anybody's mouth. Why did I think that I \r\ncould handle that now and still be somebody... ",
        "Alexandra: Phillip... ",
        "Phillip: No, this is important, because I used to know better. ",
        "Alexandra: Please don't talk that way. You need this family. I know that. ",
        "Phillip: What family? Who's here? You ever wonder why nobody ever sticks \r\naround this place for very long? You've been gone for years. And when you did \r\ncome back, look... look at the homecoming present you gave me. No, this is the \r\npoint, Aunt Alex. Besides my kids right now, this family is you and Alan. What \r\nmakes you think I can't live without either one of you? ",
        "",
        "Olivia: I don't want to lose this hotel anymore than you do, but you don't \r\nunderstand. ",
        "Cassie: Well, then make me understand. Please make me understand. ",
        "Olivia: Do you want details? ",
        "Cassie: Do I need them? ",
        "Olivia: No. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, look... I'm sorry. I am sorry. But we've got to put our heads \r\ntogether here. ",
        "Olivia: (sighs) Okay, look, all you need to know is that Alan tricked me into \r\nmarrying him. The heart attacks, both of them, fake, fake. ",
        "Cassie: You're joking. ",
        "Olivia: No, lied to me about the whole thing. ",
        "Cassie: He lied to you about his heart attacks, and that's why he threw you \r\nout? ",
        "Olivia: No, that wasn't... You know what, it doesn't matter. You wanted to \r\nknow why I can't even talk to Alan, much less grovel. That's why. ",
        "Cassie: Okay, all right, I'm sorry. What he did was horrible, and I\u2019ll give \r\nyou that, but you had to know it was Alan. I mean, you couldn't have been \r\nsurprised. Olivia, you ought to think about why he did it. He did it because he \r\nwanted to be with you that badly. I saw you guys together. You made it seem like \r\nlove to me. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it did, and you want to know why? Because I turned myself \r\ninside out to be a good wife to him. I was jumping through hoops to prove myself \r\nto him, Cassie. It's done. It's over. I did everything I could to make that \r\nmarriage work. ",
        "Cassie: Well, maybe it still can. You know, the man is lying in a hospital \r\nbed... ",
        "Olivia: Uh, been there, done that. That's why I signed the first pre-nup. ",
        "Cassie: Yes, but isn't he really sick this time? ",
        "Olivia: I don't know. The jury's out. Probably. ",
        "Cassie: Olivia, just go to him. What he did was terrible, but I am sure there \r\nwere mistakes made on both sides. ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, there were mistakes made on both sides, Cassie. And, yeah, he \r\nmanipulated me and he lied to me. But, you know, that's not even the worst part. \r\nThe worst part was he made me feel lucky to get even that. Forget it. I'm done!\r\n",

And this guy, you \r\nknow, Joe August, he faced down every capo in the racket without missing a beat. \r\nBut then I\u2019d see him come home and walk through the kitchen and walk into that \r\nbedroom alone. And I don't know how he did it. ",
        "Alexandra: But he did it, didn't he? For you and your sister. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, he did. He also, right at the same time he was leading the OC \r\ndivision in arrests, without missing a beat, you know. Which is why I cannot... \r\nI cannot put it in my head Joe August was a dirty cop. ",
