        "Shayne is going home from the hospital and Reva and Josh are determined to be encouraging and optimistic. But Shayne has become a fatalist about his recovery. He must be willing to accept the possibility that he'll never walk again, and he needs his parents to accept that, too. But even as Shayne prepares himself for disappointment, Marina is anxious to be with him when he walks -- yes, walks out of the hospital. Nico is a true friend, offering to overcome his aversion to hospitals to be with her today. But Marina's concern isn't limited to Shayne -- the story of Maryanne Caruthers has estranged her from Buzz and Marina fears the gap will only grow wider. Little does Marina know that Buzz is planning to leave town. Believing it's best for everyone, especially Marina, that he go far away and take his guilt and shame with him. Meanwhile, Harley is preparing to go out on the town with Brad Green -- as part of her undercover work for Jeffrey. Her plans are temporarily stopped when Gus assumes her sexy dress and high heels are meant for him. But Harley is able to make a getaway, and keeps her appointment with Brad. While she is flirting and fishing for information, Gus stops by Company -- only to sense that something is terribly wrong with Buzz. Gus sets out to find Harley to tell her about her dad -- not realizing he's about to find her with Brad.",
        "Jeffrey makes a point of tracking down Marah to tell her he knows she's upset that they were together the night Shayne went into the hospital. Sensitive to the kind of person she is, Jeffrey eventually gets her to admit she's been beating herself up for not being there for her brother. It isn't merely Jeffrey's words but the realization that he really does care that enables Marah to go off to join her family for Shayne's first step."

        "Josh: There they are, the happy couple. Very nice.",
        "Reva: Welcome to the family, sweetheart.",
        "Buzz: Okay, kids. Time for the first dance.",
        "Nico: Wow. You look beautiful. Here we go.",
        "Josh: Hey, there, son. Ready to go home?",
        "Jeffrey: All right, I'm on my way. I want to monitor Brad Green's meeting with Terrier myself.",
        "Assistant: Got you covered until you get here, boss.",
        "Marah: Well, hi.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. Are you all right?",
        "Marah: Give me a little credit, Jeffrey. I'm not going to go crazy every time I see you. It never happened between us, remember?",
        "Jeffrey: Actually I was asking because of what happened with Shayne. You know, the surgery.",
        "Marah: Oh.",
        "Jeffrey: So how are you holding up?",
        "Marah: I'm fine, fine. Actually, Shayne is... He might be getting out of the hospital today, which would be wonderful. Thank God they got him into surgery in time.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. You're beating yourself up because you weren't there. Even though you couldn't do anything to help Shayne, you're beating yourself up. You feel guilty, and I can see it all over your face.",
        "Marah: No, you're wrong.",
        "Jeffrey: No, I'm not wrong. You're waiting for lightning to strike you because you were with me, in my bed, when Shayne was being wheeled into surgery.",
        "Harley: This is Terrier checking in. You know, it's bad enough I have to keep this date with Brad Green, but I also spent my day reading the ten million pages that you sent me about the Spauldings. So now I have a terrible headache, thank you very much. So in your next life I hope you come back as a cockroach. That way I can squash you.",
        "Gus: Wow. Look at you. Well, now I know why the sitter's here. Good. Where are you taking me?",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Eden: Hi, Alex. No, I don't have the proofs yet. The photographer said that he was going to send them ASAP, and as soon as I get them and take a look at them I will send them along to you. Oh, I'm fine, in case you were worrying. I'm soaking in a hot tub, trying to forget Buster, the horse I rode bareback all day at the ranch. You know, thanks for your lack of sympathy. I'm going to hang up now. Bill? You're home early. Bill?",
        "Tony: Don't shoot.",
        "Eden: What the hell, Tony? You are so lucky this isn't a real gun.",
        "Tony: Well, you know, you're lucky that thing isn't plugged in.",
        "Eden: How the hell did you get in here?",
        "Tony: You know, you should think about locking your doors, Eden. I brought gifts-- proofs from your photo shoot. They said you needed them right away. I figured I was in the neighborhood, so I would just drop them on by.",
        "Eden: Oh, really? You know, that's great. And thanks. So leave the proofs on the chair and make sure you close the door behind you.",
        "Tony: Okay.",
        "Gus: We can go to Towers. I like Towers. And then we can go to the Beacon, maybe. You want to get a little room?",
        "Harley: No. Watch my pin. It's got a funny little catch. I don't want you to get stuck.",
        "Gus: Okay. So are we late? Because it's getting... it's getting a little late, right? So we should go, and I can...",
        "Harley: Sweetie?",
        "Gus: ...Get the...",
        "Harley: I have to work tonight.",
        "Gus: Yeah, right. Dressed like this, you've got to work?",
        "Harley: I'm serious. I'm meeting a client for drinks at Olivia's Bar.",
        "Gus: Oh, what a very lucky... lucky client.",
        "Harley: Yeah. Yeah. No, that's why Kristin's here. That's why she's upstairs with the boys.",
        "Gus: Oh.",
        "Harley: I wanted to give you some free time, you know? Figured you could do something on your own. You could go see a movie that you know I don't want to see.",
        "Gus: Great.",
        "Harley: Right?",
        "Gus: Sounds like a blast. No, this was import... I had something important to talk to you about.",
        "Harley: Important?",
        "(Loud music playing)",
        "Harley: I just thought maybe you didn't want Kristin to hear.",
        "Gus: Really? Well, that's not necessary.",
        "Harley: Okay. Go ahead. I'm listening.",
        "Gus: Are you cold?",
        "Harley: A little bit, yeah.",
        "Gus: You got me a little worried about you here. You know that, right? I mean, here I am worried about Alan. He's acting weird enough. Now I'm thinking maybe the two of you have been bitten by the same bug.",
        "Harley: What bug?",
        "Marah: You know, for a guy who wants me to forget that we were together New Year's Eve...",
        "Jeffrey: I never said I wanted you to forget. I just said that, you know, you need to put that night in its place and then move on.",
        "Marah: I did. What about you?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Your brother seems to be, you know, getting better. Well, as well as can be expected, anyway. And, well, you seem to be doing just fine. So...",
        "Marah: Does that bother you?",
        "Jeffrey: No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it's a good thing, right, Marah? As a matter of fact, it proves what I thought about you all along -- that you're a strong, brave young woman and you're impatient for life to happen. You know, I was so excited for the future. And now that I'm here, gosh, there are just so many things I wish I could go back and change. But I can't.",
        "(Tray dropping)",
        "Marina: What is this? A reminder that just when you think nothing else can go wrong it will.",
        "Reva: Okay, I've got the escape car running. So what do you say we blow this popsicle stand? Unless, of course, you'd like to stay and have one last hospital supper.",
        "Shayne: No, that's all right. I'm ready for some of your cooking.",
        "Josh: You sure about that?",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Shayne: Well, you guys think there's going to be room in the car for this thing? Looks like it's going with me.",
        "Reva: Well, we'll make room, even though I don't think it's going to be around very long.",
        "Shayne: You never know.",
        "Reva: Exactly. Shayne, you have to know that the reason that they're letting you leave this place isn't because they don't think anything more is going to happen. They're just letting you go because they think that you can make just as much progress at home as you can here. I know you were hoping for an immediate response right after the surgery, but that doesn't mean that the sensation won't come back in a while.",
        "Shayne: Well, I'm just trying to face reality.",
        "Josh: Well, there's something to be said for being unrealistic, too, right?",
        "Shayne: Well, absolutely. It's worked for us on numerous occasions.",
        "Josh: You think about all the people in the world that believe that anything is possible. Without them, I mean, think of the things that would never have happened.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I know. And I hope I can do what you guys want me to do.",
        "Reva: We want it for you, Shayne.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, what if I let you down this time? What if I'm in this thing for the rest of my life? Then I won't be your golden boy anymore.",
        "Josh: Hey, son, you will always be our golden boy.",
        "Reva: And I know in my heart that you... I'm going to go out and find your sister and Marina. I know they wanted to be here to help escort you out of here, so...",
        "Shayne: I'm sorry I keep upsetting her.",
        "Josh: Don't be sorry. She'll be okay.",
        "Shayne: Yeah. Why don't you go after her? She needs you. I'm okay. Stop making me feel like I need to do this for you.",
        "Harley: So what's wrong with Alan? What, is the Dow down? Is the white truffle season over early?",
        "Gus: Yeah, funny. Alan's got a problem. There's something wrong with him.",
        "Harley: Well, of course there is. He's worried about Phillip.",
        "Gus: This is not about Phillip. This is about that car that was in the river. Do you remember that?",
        "Harley: Of course.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, Frank ran the plate, and apparently the car belongs to Alan. Says that... When I asked him, he said it was stolen, like, 30 years ago, he doesn't remember, and he forgot it all or something.",
        "Harley: Well, honey, when you have a car for every day of the week, what's one more or less?",
        "Gus: No. It's not that. He didn't even fill out a police report. Now, does that sound like him to you?",
        "Harley: Sweetie, I am not an expert on Alan Spaulding.",
        "Gus: Well, there is something weird about this car thing. I cannot put my finger on it. That is the problem. I see it in his...",
        "Harley: I've got to go.",
        "Gus: ...Eye. I'm talking to him, and I... What?",
        "Harley: I don't want to be rude, but I've got to go. I don't want to be late for this meeting. The sooner I get there, the sooner I get home, right? And hey -- you've got to relax and realize that Alan Spaulding is going to drive you crazy on a daily basis.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, if your father was keeping secrets from you, wouldn't you want to know about it?",
        "Harley: My father keeping secrets? No, no, no, no. His keeping secrets days are way over. Bye.",
        "Buzz: What happened?",
        "Marina: Nothing happened. Nothing ever did happen. Isn't that what you always tell me?",
        "Buzz: I know I'm part of what's bothering you, you know? So if I... anything I can do... What are you waiting for? You're her friend. Go cheer her up. Go! Hello. I'd like to book a ticket. Yeah, a one way flight. The next plane to Athens. No, not Athens, Georgia.",
        "Nico: So what's up with you and your grandpa? I thought you guys were, like, best friends or something.",
        "Marina: Yeah, we were, until I tried to help him with something that he didn't think that he needed my help with, and now he doesn't think that I trust him, and I know that he doesn't trust me, so it's basically just all a big mess.",
        "Nico: Yeah, sounds pretty bad.",
        "Marina: I really just want to help him.",
        "Nico: You're helping a lot of people -- your grandpa, Shayne. Who's going to help you?",
        "Marina: Oh, I usually have more people than I need to help me. But I don't know. I guess it's just sort of my time right now, you know? And I think I'm a little bit more rattled than usual, because... well, because I think that Shayne has given up on himself. He doesn't think that he's ever going to walk again.",
        "Nico: But you're not going to let that happen, are you?",
        "Marina: Well, it's not really up to me.",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Marina: Hello? Hey, Reva. Now? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I can be there in, like, two minutes. Okay. Shayne is getting out of the hospital right now. I have to go.",
        "Nico: No, no, no. I'll take you.",
        "Marina: What are you going to... are you going to, like, walk me across the street? No, I'm kidding. Definitely come. We need all the moral support we can get. I'll be, like, two minutes.",
        "Marah: I'm sorry. This is the last thing I wanted to do right now.",
        "Jeffrey: Everyone gets overwhelmed occasionally. I mean, I know I'd love to go back and change things myself, all the time. It's human.",
        "Marah: Wow. You admit that you're human?",
        "Jeffrey: Don't tell anybody. I wish you could tell me, you know, all that's bothering you. And I really do hope that you're not punishing yourself for the night that we spent together, because there was nothing wrong with that, Marah, you know. There was nothing wrong with something that's real, honest, something that comes from the heart.",
        "Marah: But wait a minute. I thought that what we had had nothing to do with our hearts.",
        "Tony: Make a wish.",
        "Eden: When I said close the door behind you, I wanted you on the other side of the door. So let me rephrase, Tony -- get out, now.",
        "Tony: Well, I thought I would stick around for a while. I don't have any plans.",
        "Eden: Well, I do. Bill's going to be home any minute.",
        "Tony: Well, that'll make it kind of interesting, don't you think? Sorry, but I happen to know Bill won't be home for hours.",
        "Eden: Tony?",
        "Tony: Yes?",
        "Eden: Why do you keep doing this to me? You promised me that you were going to quit messing with me and Bill, and then the next minute, you're holding me hostage in my own bathtub.",
        "Tony: That's the thing, Eden. See, I try to be good, but I can't. Besides, you're the one that's making this such a big deal. I used to bathe with my friend Audrey for... well, on a regular basis.",
        "Eden: And when was this, Tony?",
        "Tony: Well, it was... it was a while ago. I think we were, like, five. Yeah, we were... we were five.",
        "Eden: Tony, we're not five. And I'm wondering if we can ever be friends.",
        "Tony: Well, I'll tell you what -- why don't we just skip the friends part, Eden, and get right to the good stuff? What do you say? My suggestion is you just sit up, relax, and you let me wash your back, hmm? Eden, Eden, let me show you what a good friend I can be. Come on, relax.",
        "Eden: My robe.",
        "Tony: Come and get it.",
        "Eden: In your dreams.",
        "Tony: Or in yours. Now, where were we? Hmm? That's right. I was about to... I was about to wash your back, right? Hmm? See? It's not bad, right?",
        "Eden: It feels...",
        "Tony: It's not bad.",
        "Eden: It feels good. But it doesn't mean I feel anything, if you know what I mean.",
        "Tony: Whatever you say, Eden.",
        "Eden: You know, I get it.",
        "Tony: I hope so.",
        "Eden: This is me you're talking to, Tony. We know each other pretty well, right?",
        "Tony: Yeah, we do.",
        "Eden: Hear me out. What you're doing right now, showing up wherever I am, talking about destiny, dismissing Bill, it's not about me. It's all about Marah.",
        "Tony: You know how to ruin a perfectly good moment, don't you?",
        "Eden: You know I'm right, Tony. You are trying so hard to push your feelings for Marah away that you need something, someone, just to fill that space.",
        "Tony: Interesting. Romantic, but wrong. I've told you, Marah and I are over. I've said it a million times.",
        "Eden: You think you can just turn your feelings off like a light switch.",
        "Tony: When something needs to end, Eden, that's exactly what you do. You should keep that in mind, you know?",
        "Eden: Oh. And what was that $10,000 for a Marah Lewis design, a parting gift?",
        "Tony: I wanted... okay. I wanted Marah to know that I was happy and proud of her success, okay? And I am.",
        "Eden: I believe you.",
        "Tony: Good.",
        "Eden: Almost.",
        "Tony: See, that's the thing about people, Eden. People can have more than one emotion and one feeling at a time. Marah's my past, okay? And now I'm ready to focus on my future. Your water's getting a little cold. Would you like me to heat it up? Hmm?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, of course it has something to do with our hearts, you know? Every time that two people get together and make love like we did, our hearts are involved. I mean, everything's involved -- all the baggage that people carry with them, everything. But then, the night ends, and you get out of bed.",
        "Marah: And Jeffrey's walls go right back up. Don't worry. I'm not going to touch you, even though we both wish...",
        "Jeffrey: I've got to go.",
        "Marah: Good. Go.",
        "Marina: Hey! Shayne's getting out of the hospital. Come on.",
        "Marah: Gosh!",
        "Jeffrey: Go. Go. Go see your brother.",
        "Harley: Here comes trouble.",
        "Brad: How did you manage it?",
        "Harley: Manage what?",
        "Brad: How did you manage to convince your fianc\u00e9e to let you out of the house looking like that?",
        "Harley: Gus is up to his ears in business. He barely noticed.",
        "Brad: Oh.",
        "Harley: And he's very happy that I have a new client.",
        "Brad: Oh. Oh, that's what I am -- a client. Hmm.",
        "Harley: A client who's becoming a friend, maybe more.",
        "Brad: Really?",
        "Harley: Well, the more I know, the more I want to know. I mean, if you weren't married. Sorry. I didn't mean to overstep.",
        "Brad: No, no, no. It's all right. It's nice to feel appreciated for a change. You know, with this Lori Jensen mess behind us, I thought Marie and I could make a new start. I mean, I... I did my best to keep her out of jail.",
        "Harley: Yes, you did.",
        "Brad: But instead of feeling gratitude, she's as possessive and suspicious as ever. It's like she's free and I'm in prison.",
        "Harley: Finding a relationship that's balanced is hard. One person cares too much, the other not enough. I admit at times like these I do miss my freedom. Wouldn't want Marie to catch us like this.",
        "Brad: It's all right. Marie is out with her sister, the Wicked Witch of the East. We have the entire evening to ourselves. Thanks. All right, what's going on?",
        "Harley: It is amazing that you work so hard, and yet you still find time for a life. Gus is completely obsessed with work.",
        "Brad: Well, Gus still has a lot to prove to dear, old dad. As for myself, I'm secure in the knowledge that Spaulding Enterprises would be lost without me.",
        "Harley: Must be very empowering to know your worth. But I thought that Alan was the company genius, no?",
        "Brad: We let him think that.",
        "Harley: We?",
        "Brad: Alex and I. When in reality we know that Spaulding Pharmaceuticals is the crown jewel of the company, and it's our baby.",
        "Harley: Well, you and Alex are quite a team, huh? You're not just the numbers man?",
        "Brad: Alex has always depended on me, in many ways.",
        "Harley: You and Alex?",
        "Gus: What's up, Buzz?",
        "Buzz: I haven't seen her.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Buzz: No. Harley's out with a client. I'm on my own tonight. Where are the kids?",
        "Gus: We got a sitter. Everything's fine. They're doing fine.",
        "Buzz: Good.",
        "Gus: Yeah. So did I pass? I mean, can I get a little lamb pie and some of that wine that... you know, the stuff that tastes like turpentine? What is that stuff?",
        "Buzz: Retsina.",
        "Gus: Yeah, retsina. Retsina. That stuff.",
        "Buzz: We're all out.",
        "Gus: You're out? Well, can you... you know, you're going to have to order it up, because that stuff is so nasty it's good. So...",
        "Buzz: I don't think with the new menu that we're going to have Greek food. So we won't be needing retsina.",
        "Gus: Hey, wait a second. New menu? What are you doing? If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This is a good menu.",
        "Buzz: Change is good. Change with menus, people. Change is good. I mean, if I hadn't changed, I wouldn't have come back here and gotten to know my kids. If you hadn't changed, you'd still be the same insufferable nerd you were when you walked in here the first time.",
        "Gus: Well, thank you very much.",
        "Buzz: Well, I mean, were you nerd or weren't you a nerd?",
        "Gus: I had some nerd-like qualities, I guess.",
        "Buzz: You know, I thought you were the worst thing that ever happened to my daughter. But now, honestly, I think you're good enough for her. I think you two are lucky to have each other, and the kids are lucky. I think... you know, you're going to have a fine family. And whatever happens, wherever I am...",
        "Gus: Buzz, what... what's go on? Is there something going on that...",
        "Buzz: You know, I do have one more bottle of retsina in the cellar. It's yours.",
        "Reva: I'm no good at this.",
        "Josh: Who is? It's different for them.",
        "Reva: I just can't stand the idea that Shayne's resigned himself to that chair for life.",
        "Josh: It's part of the process. Or don't you remember?",
        "Reva: You're going to get a headache if you keep concentrating that hard.",
        "Josh: Shh! Oh, forget it. I spoke too soon. Forget it.",
        "Reva: No! No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.",
        "Josh: The magic is gone.",
        "Reva: You're going to get it. No, no. You've got it. You've got it. Just give it one more try.",
        "Josh: No. It's not going to work, Reva.",
        "Reva: Yes, it will. It might work if you give it one more shot. Just one more shot. I know you can do it.",
        "Josh: All right, all right, all right.",
        "Reva: Okay. You wanted to give up.",
        "Josh: But you wouldn't let me. It was your love and your faith in me that got me to walk again.",
        "Rick: Hey, good. Everybody's here.",
        "Reva: Rick, where's Ed? I thought he was the one that was in charge of this.",
        "Rick: He had an emergency at the clinic. Don't worry. I can handle this. A few routine tests and some instructions, and Shayne can go home. Come on.",
        "Marina: I wanted to make a sign and put it on the back of your chair, like, \"Out of Here,\" or something like that.",
        "Remy: Luckily there was no time.",
        "Marina: But we are all ready for you at home.",
        "Remy: Oh, we have been for days, thanks to General Marah over here.",
        "Marah: Hey, you know what? That nickname's getting a little old.",
        "Nico: Marina just showed me a list Marah made for everyone to have an assignment to do a different chore -- \"Things to Do Before Shayne Comes Home, No Excuses.\" Man, you've got some pretty tough women in your life.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, tell me about it. Speaking of the General...",
        "Marah: Oh, you watch it. You think you're safe in that chair, but you're not.",
        "Shayne: Well, I'll take my chances. I need to talk to you for a second. Alone, if you guys don't mind.",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Remy: Clear the room, guys. All right, you guys, you know, we'll be out there with your folks.",
        "Marah: I'm sorry I wasn't here for your surgery.",
        "Shayne: No, no. Someone in the family needs to be normal.",
        "Marah: What do you mean, normal?",
        "Shayne: I mean it was New Year's Eve, you had a date. It's fine.",
        "Marah: No. Not if it means keeping me from you. So what's up?",
        "Shayne: I need you to control Mom and Dad for me. Especially Mom.",
        "Marah: Yeah. Me and what army?",
        "Shayne: They want too much.",
        "Marah: They want what we all want.",
        "Shayne: No. Mom thinks I'm going to be like Dad, you know, and just magically, boom, Shayne's going to be up, I'm going to be out of this chair playing ball again. You know what I mean. It's like they think that if we just wish hard enough... Wishes don't come true. Wishing on a star, that kind of stuff doesn't happen. We found that out when we were young.",
        "Marah: Yeah. No matter how hard we wished, huh?",
        "Shayne: But I have a lot. I mean, I'm alive, Dad and I are getting along after everything that happened, and I have you guys.",
        "Marah: And Marina.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, for now. I'm sorry, I'm just being weird.",
        "Marah: Yes, you are. Marina loves you, and she would never leave you. And you're right, you are lucky. I guess I wish I'd wished on a star this time. Maybe that would have worked better.",
        "Rick: Hey, guys. I'm hearing this rumor that Shayne wants to check out of this place.",
        "Marah: Yes, sir.",
        "Shayne: Please, yes.",
        "Rick: All right. You got it. Just a few quick tests and some parting words of wisdom, and you can go home.",
        "Gus: All righty. So what are we drinking to?",
        "Buzz: Family. Doing the right thing for them. Better late than never.",
        "Marina: So, are we out of here?",
        "Rick: Yep. As long as Shayne shows up for his physical therapy and his follow- up exams, he can go home.",
        "Shayne: Good.",
        "Rick: All right. Now, this is the \"Do Not Try At Home\" list, all right? Shayne, you ready?",
        "Shayne: Yeah, on one condition. There's one more thing I need to do before I leave. I want to try to get on my feet again.",
        "Reva: Oh, honey, you don't...",
        "Shayne: No, it's better that I do it now than, you know, being at home alone.",
        "Rick: Yeah, absolutely. You want everybody else to leave while we try this?",
        "Shayne: No, no. We're all in this together. I need to know where I stand before I leave, or don't stand.",
        "Tony: You ready to get out? Hmm?",
        "Eden: Not quite yet. Since we're talking about the naked truth, I think it's time for you to reciprocate.",
        "Tony: Absolutely.",
        "Eden: I don't want you in the tub, Tony. I want you to tell me the truth.",
        "Tony: Yeah? About what, hmm?",
        "Eden: You left Springfield to get away from Marah, to get out from being under being Danny's Boy. To get away from me, even. You wanted to carve your own way in this world. So what's the screeching U-turn, huh?",
        "Tony: I was running away, Eden, okay? No matter how far or fast I ran, it didn't solve anything, okay? So I had to come back to deal with Danny, with Marah, and with you. You see, Eden, the fact is you're the woman I should be with. I realized that when I was gone. The fact is I want you, and the other fact is... Look at me. I will have you.",
        "Eden: And it doesn't matter that I am with another man, and it doesn't matter that I am finally happy, and I feel worthwhile for the first time in my life?",
        "Tony: Here we go again.",
        "Eden: That I am supposed to just come to my senses, and I am just supposed to leave everything that makes me happy...",
        "Tony: Happy?",
        "Eden: ...And run away with a guy that basically makes me feel doomed instead of feeling destined?",
        "Tony: One thing -- you'll come to your senses, trust me. And when you do, I'll be here. Okay?",
        "Eden: You're a step behind, Tony. I've already come to my senses. Here -- I have a little parting gift for you. You take a long, hard look, because this is something that will never... It will never belong to you.",
        "Gus: Look at this thing. Look how... it's like it was corked around the time that Homer could still see an eye chart.",
        "Buzz: \"The grey-eyed Athena sent them a favorable breeze, a fresh wind, singing over the wine-dark sea.\" That's Homer, The Odyssey. Each life is an odyssey, don't you think? The pie.",
        "Gus: Yeah. You know, Buzz, can you do me a favor? Can you wrap this all up? Because I should really go home. I'm thinking about the kids, and I, you know...",
        "Buzz: You're a good man.",
        "Gus: Kristin, hey. It's Gus. Yeah, listen. Can you do me a favor? Can you watch the kids for a couple more hours? Thanks. I've got to find Harley.",
        "Harley: This is so fascinating. I have so many questions.",
        "Brad: Fire away.",
        "Harley: Pharmaceutical research. I mean, it just... it seems so cutthroat, you know? Don't you feel like your enemies are always right behind you, ready to steal your secrets?",
        "Brad: Well, I would if we didn't have excellent security, you know?",
        "Harley: Well, that's good. So I guess nothing happens at Spaulding without you knowing about it.",
        "Brad: What are you suggesting?",
        "Jeffrey: Easy, Terrier. Nibble. Don't bite.",
        "Harley: I'm thinking that Gus has a long way to go before he could compete with a man like you. At Spaulding, of course.",
        "Brad: Oh, Harley, you don't know the half of it. I've taken Spaulding Pharmaceuticals from Europe to the Far East to the southern hemisphere; from San Cristobel to Brazil. And now I'm back to knock them dead in the good, old U S of A.",
        "Harley: Is there anything you can't do?",
        "Brad: Well, you know what they say. Some things take two.",
        "Rick: All right, this is your last chance. You don't have to try this if you don't want to.",
        "Shayne: Yes, I do.",
        "Rick: All right. Josh, Remy, you want to give him a hand? Take your time, now, okay?",
        "Reva: Next on Guiding Light",
        "Brad: Now that's how it's done, huh?",
        "Harley: Gus, hi.",
        "Gus: Hi, honey.",
        "Shadow: Hello again. Miss me?",
        "Eden: Who is this?",
        "Tony: It's a recording.",
        "Shadow: Danny Santos and Bill Lewis are in danger. Meet me tonight, Towers parking garage."
