        "Tammy: It's too late, Sandy, we're over. Sorry.",
        "Sandy: You used to love me. You can love me again, if you would just let yourself.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, get off her!",
        "Sandy: You don't have to... go neanderthal.",
        "Jonathan: Don't ever touch her ever again!",
        "Sandy: I wasn't hurting her. You're the one who's...",
        "Jonathan: Shut up and get out of here!",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "Jonathan: I was hoping you'd say that.",
        "Tammy: No... Jonathan. Stop it! Just let him go. Stop it, Jonathan!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: So which picture do you think we should put on it?",
        "R.J.: I'll find it.",
        "Cassie: Yeah?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Purple socks are no longer ours. What's next on the list of items to return?",
        "Cassie: I guess I'll return the sweaters I got for Tammy for Christmas. If she ever speaks to me again, we'll just give her a gift certificate, and she can pick out whatever she's into then. Wait a minute. What is this doing in here?",
        "Jeffrey: Isn't that the frame...",
        "Cassie: For Tammy and Sandy's wedding photos. Yeah. Well, I guess I'll return this, too. Otherwise it'll just remind me that she isn't coming home.",
        "Jeffrey: You know she might come home if you ask her too.",
        "Cassie: And while I'm at it, why don't I just invite Jonathan to move in with us. Wouldn't that be cozy? We can all...",
        "R.J.: Jonathan's moving in with us?",
        "Cassie: No. Honey, I uh...",
        "Jeffrey: You know what, R.J.? Let's say you and I go scout out some really cool toys. What do you say?",
        "R.J.: Yeah. How about a web cam?",
        "Jeffrey: A web cam, the man has spoken. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: We'll see about that. I'll go return these and I'll catch up with you guys in a bit.",
        "Reva: Hi. Are you still speaking to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm not worried. My father and brother will probably turn up alive and well by the end of the day. Nobody is worried except the press. Yes. Yes, that's my official statement.",
        "Marina: No one's worried, huh?",
        "Alan-Michael: Busted again by the lady in blue... or pink. Come closer so I can see what you're wearing and then I'll bear my soul and tell you how worried I really am.",
        "Marina: Don't you ever just say hello?",
        "Alan Michael: Hello. Can I have someone get you a cup of coffee?",
        "Marina: No, but you can get me a list of all the properties that Spaulding owns-- any place you think Alan might be.",
        "Alan-Michael: I see. So this is official police business.",
        "Marina: Partly. And partly because of you. I was thinking about what you said about taking a chance.",
        "Alan-Michael: And?",
        "Marina: Count me in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alexandra: Have you heard anything about from your boss about Alan and Gus?",
        "Dinah: No. No, not yet. But you know what? Mallet and Harley, they are out there. They're using the detective manual, I'm sure, and they're using it backwards and forwards and legally or otherwise.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, yes. I'm sure they are. They are wonderful together, they always were.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: We are wasting time. We should be back out there! Please take me to where we tracked the GPS signal.",
        "Mallet: We already tried that, okay? There's black ice everywhere. We barely made it back here. ( Knocking at the door )",
        "Chief Parker: Good evening, ma'am.",
        "Mallet: Chief Parker. How you doing? Thanks for coming out in this mess.",
        "Chief Parker: That's my job. We've got a guard rail down in the area where the GPS signal is coming from.",
        "Harley: Can you take me there, please?",
        "Chief Parker: On these roads? We'd be lucky to survive ourselves.",
        "Harley: That's my husband out there. If your wife was out there, or your brother, you'd be out there looking, too.",
        "Mallet: Chief Parker, what do you say? Let's just give it a shot, okay? If the roads are dangerous, we'll just come back here.",
        "Chief Parker: Okay, we'll try.",
        "Mallet: All right.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan!",
        "Jonathan: You think you can get close to her because I'm locked up in a cell?",
        "Sandy: She is fine!",
        "Tammy: If you hit him, they will use it against you in court, and I want you out here with me.",
        "Sandy: You really think this is going to work? You think you can just waltz in here out of prison and set up house? The whole town is talking about poor Tammy; her own cousin is taking her in. I know you don't care about that, but she does. I hate what he's doing to you. He is turning your whole family against you. You deserve more than this.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, no! Jonathan!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: You want extra marshmallows with that? What's the matter?",
        "R.J.: Are you going to leave like Edmund?",
        "Jeffrey: Am I going to leave? I just moved in, R.J.",
        "R.J.: You were fighting, right?",
        "Jeffrey: With your mom? No, we weren't fighting. We were just having a disagreement. That's what adults do sometimes. We disagree about things like who is going to drive the car, who is going to have the biggest slice of pizza. It's normal.",
        "R.J.: It is?",
        "Jeffrey: Adults are kids, just, you know, taller.",
        "R.J.: So you're not leaving?",
        "Jeffrey: No way, Jose. You, me, Tammy and your mom, we're a family. And if we ever do fight, we're going to make up, okay?",
        "R.J.: I'm glad you're in my family.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? So am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I wasn't sure if you'd be talking to me.",
        "Reva: Not talking is really hard for me.",
        "Cassie: No kidding. How's Tammy?",
        "Reva: She is fine, considering.",
        "Cassie: Considering how unreasonable I am?",
        "Reva: I didn't say that.",
        "Cassie: I know. You didn't have to. Look, maybe we shouldn't be talking to each other.",
        "Reva: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Because who was it who arranged for them to be together on New Year's Eve? And a midnight meeting the night before Tammy's wedding? You did everything but shove those two into bed.",
        "Reva: I love my son. I want to help him. I owe him that much. All I did was give my niece the opportunity to make a decision on her own.",
        "Cassie: And you did it without telling me. I'm your sister, Reva.",
        "Reva: Is this about us or about our children?",
        "Cassie: This is about Tammy. It's about her future.",
        "Reva: Is that what it was about when you picked up that phone and made the call to Frank Cooper?",
        "Cassie: I turned Jonathan in because I wanted my daughter to see for herself how dangerous that kid can be, and it backfired because of you.",
        "Reva: Oh, no, no, no. No, it backfired because Tammy was there the night of the fire.",
        "Cassie: Okay, look. Just do me a favor. Will you just make sure she doesn't self-destruct? Just keep her from sacrificing everything for Jonathan.",
        "Reva: What are you asking me to do?",
        "Cassie: Get her a lawyer. She won't take any help from me, and she could lose everything, Reva. Her whole life could be falling apart.",
        "Reva: Cassie, look at me. I love Tammy. Jonathan loves Tammy. And as hard as this is for you to hear, you need to wrap your brain around it and realize that we won't let anything bad happen to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: So we're friends again?",
        "Marina: You ditched me on New Year's Eve. You know, the flowers were nice, but I'll stick them up your exhaust pipe before I ever let something like that happen again. All right, come on. Where's the papers? Let's get moving. I want a list of every property that Alan owns.",
        "Alan-Michael: No can do. I have a meeting. Come on.",
        "Marina: Gee, it is so nice to see how much you care about Alan and Gus. Nice to see your concern.",
        "Alan-Michael: I do care. But I have things to take care of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: We have trouble. The phones are absolutely ringing off the hook asking about Alan and Gus.",
        "Dinah: And, of course, they want to talk to Harley.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's why I called a staff meeting.",
        "Alexandra: We have a lot of explaining to do to our shareholders.",
        "Alan-Michael: Don't worry, I have it covered. We'll have the meeting here in my office.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Gus! Gus! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's me! Can you hear me? Can you hear me?",
        "Mallet: It's over here! It's over here!",
        "Chief Parker: Don't touch that! Let it go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: You know, I fight with mom, too, sometimes.",
        "Jeffrey: You do? What about?",
        "R.J.: Well, I hate it when she tickles me.",
        "Jeffrey: You do? You mean like this? Or like this? ( Laughter )",
        "R.J.: No, like this.",
        "Jeffrey: Ah! Oh, okay, stop. Uncle, uncle, uncle!",
        "R.J.: Gotcha.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, you did. You know what? I need to get some recruits, so let's go find your mom. What do you say?",
        "R.J.: I want to show her the new art project that I made for school.",
        "Jeffrey: Art project, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You don't have to ask me to look out for Tammy. I love her like I love any of my children.",
        "Cassie: I know you do. And if I had to lose her...",
        "Reva: You haven't lost her. She's just... she's staying with me for a little while, that's all. And I will do whatever I can to get her the best lawyer money can buy. I just wish she didn't need one, especially if you'd put a little more thought into...",
        "Cassie: I gave it plenty of thought, Reva.",
        "Reva: Okay, okay. I don't want to fight about this. You love Tammy. I want to do whatever I can to help my son, but they're both still in serious trouble. And if we can't be together, if it's too hard, then maybe we should put some distance between ourselves.",
        "Cassie: Maybe we should.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Me, too.",
        "R.J.: Mom?",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, you okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I am now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, let him go! Don't hurt him!",
        "Sandy: You're ruining her life.",
        "Jonathan: Does she looked ruined to you? Does she look hurt?",
        "Tammy: Stop it. Look at me. I won't lose you again. I won't. Let him go. He's not worth it. I love you. You!",
        "Jonathan: ( Gasping ) All right. All right. She's right, you know. Why kill something that's already dead?",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry, Tammy. I just hate what he is doing to you.",
        "Tammy: Just get out of here! Are you okay? You're bleeding.",
        "Jonathan: It's no big deal.",
        "Tammy: Sorry. I didn't know that he was...",
        "Jonathan: That's all right. Forget about him.",
        "Tammy: I already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay, so we're taking a look at property listings, private and commercial, right?",
        "Marina: Right, everything that Spaulding owns, any place where Alan might hide out, you know. I mean, it might be a long shot.",
        "Dinah: Well, it's worth a try. You know, I can't say I blame Gus, you know. I mean, after what Alan did to Harley, I would want to take him for a ride, too. The old me. Sorry, Officer.",
        "Marina: Oh, please. It's all right. Thank you for skipping out on that meeting and helping me out here.",
        "Dinah: Sure. Sure. You know what? It beats listening to Alan-Michael rallying in the troops. My goodness, besides, I like keeping busy.",
        "Marina: Me, too. That's why I became a cop. One thing you can count on is there is someone somewhere always committing a crime, right? You like working here?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I mean, I love it. I'm covered in paperwork, and I am really busy sort of doing this PR thing for Alan-Michael, and I'm stressed out sometimes, but I like something else to think about.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Me, too. You know that's why I took the night shift on New Year's Eve.",
        "Dinah: Oh, gosh, I know what that's like. I worked Christmas.",
        "Marina: So who's the lucky guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: As you can see, we're in great shape, and once my father comes home, we'll throw him a little party. I'll talk to Harley about it as soon as she gets back. Yes, David?",
        "David: Will you be running the staff meetings from now on or just until Ms. Cooper gets back?",
        "Alan-Michael: We'll see how it goes. Things are changing at Spaulding. This might be one of my permanent duties. Any more questions? Okay, let's get back to work.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, you are smooth, but I'm on to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Ow.",
        "Harley: Let's get him. Gus!",
        "Mallet: Come here, Harley!",
        "Harley: Open the door!",
        "Mallet: Come here! Parker, hold on to her, don't let her go!",
        "Harley: You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!",
        "Mallet: Hold onto her. Stay back.",
        "Chief Parker: Ma'am, you're going to get yourself killed.",
        "Harley: What is it?! What's in there? Is he okay?",
        "Mallet: It's empty.",

        "Robert Newman, inside \"The Light.\" When Joshua first showed up in Springfield, October of 1981, I was 14 years old. Josh and Reva are sort of that mythical love that people want to believe in. And when you work with people like Kim and Tom and Jordan, it never fails. I think to the viewers, the main thing that I can say is thank you for spending so much time with us and continuing to support us in such an extraordinary way. See Josh on Wednesday, January 11, inside \"The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Thank God. Thank God he's not in here. That means they're out here somewhere. We can find them.",
        "Mallet: Slow down. We're in the woods in the middle of an ice storm. It is in the middle of the night. They could have gone in any direction.",
        "Harley: So, we'll look for them. They couldn't have gone far. They could be right around the bend. Gus! Alan!",
        "Mallet: Gus is smart. He'll find an ice cave out of the freezing rain. He'll be fine.",
        "Harley: 20 minutes. We'll just look for them for 20 minutes.",
        "Mallet: No. You're exhausted. It is freezing out here. You're in a state of shock. We're going to go back to the hotel room, freshen up and warm up, get some rest and get ready for a search tomorrow, okay?",
        "Harley: No, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Chief Parker: Ma'am, I can't let you stay. The ice accumulation has weakened that cliff. It could go at anytime.",
        "Harley: You don't get it!",
        "Mallet: Slow down, here. Slow down. Listen to me. You don't get it. Stop trying to get yourself killed tonight okay?",
        "Harley: If Gus freezes out here, I'm holding you responsible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Wow! How many properties does Spaulding own?",
        "Dinah: Are you kidding me? I know. These people do not have money problems. You know, Mallet is pursuing the lead on the car that Gus is driving.",
        "Marina: How do you... ooh, Mallet.",
        "Dinah: What? I did not say there's a guy; you did. Yeah. I spend more time at my computer than I do with anybody else, okay? And it's nothing serious.",
        "Marina: No, you're looking for a little companionship.",
        "Dinah: Okay, companionship. But nothing serious ever again.",
        "Marina: No, I agree with you. Just take it easy, have fun. That's what I'm doing.",
        "Dinah: Really? With who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: What is it you think I have done, Aunt Alex?",
        "Alexandra: Well, what haven't you done? Stepping right in to assist Harley. Solving some mysterious overseas problem? Making yourself indispensable to the company. I think it is almost pure genius.",
        "Alan-Michael: Thank you.",
        "Alexandra: Here we are clawing each other's eyes out to be CEO, and you're just effortlessly slipping right into the position.",
        "Alan Michael: That's ridiculous. You know me better than that. These days I like to hang free and go where the wind takes me.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you've taken your time and had your share of that, haven't you? Just sitting around waiting the rest of us out.",
        "Alan-Michael: I love the credit you're giving me, Aunt Alex. Nobody has taken me this seriously in a long time.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Oh, I don't think that is true. What about Marina Cooper? I think she takes you very seriously.",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina's a friend.",
        "Alexandra: The kind of friend who shows up late New Year's Eve, doing what? Doing some filing for you?",
        "Alan-Michael: Leave Marina out of this. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, going on between us. Is that clear?",
        "Alexandra: Very. Very clear. Very.",
        "Alan-Michael: Now, if you're finished with your conspiracy theories, I have work to do.",
        "Alexandra: You know something? Just as a reminder, and I'm sure you haven't forgotten, I make quite a conspiracy partner, and I'm here in case you need me.",
        "Alan-Michael: Even though you think I'm a back-stabbing conniver?",
        "Alexandra: Stop right there. If you were anything else, you wouldn't be a part of this family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Here. You stopped. You didn't hit Sandy, even when you had every right to. The first time you didn't go all...",
        "Jonathan: Crazy?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. I still can't believe Sandy hit you like that.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, look. I know that you want us to be together, and that's what I want too, but we have to be realistic. Things are worse now than they've ever been, and there's a lot of things working against us.",
        "Tammy: Maybe, but there's a lot more working for us.",
        "Jonathan: No, I know where you're coming from, but...",
        "Tammy: Shh... let's see how that is doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: ( Whistles ) More photos, huh?",
        "R.J.: Can I look at the new web cams in the computer store?",
        "Jeffrey: Go for it. Don't be belong. Don't be long.",
        "Cassie: Uh-oh, where's he off to now?",
        "Jeffrey: The computer store. Whoa. Wow. What is that for? I thought you were still mad at me.",
        "Cassie: Oh, I'm mad at everybody. It's exhausting. Reva and I got into it about Jonathan and Tammy again.",
        "Jeffrey: So you took it out on her instead of me?",
        "Cassie: Kind of. But she did say something that actually made sense-- that I have to make sure that I'm focusing on what is best for Tammy. And that's what you were trying to tell me, too-- that I need to focus on her instead of how much I would like to shoot Jonathan.",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy loves you, you know that. So if you're not talking to her...",
        "Cassie: Nothing can be resolved. I think I love you.",
        "Jeffrey: Does that mean I don't have to sleep on the couch tonight?",
        "Cassie: Well, lucky for you, I'm not a sleep on the couch kind of girl. If I'm mad at you, I'll just toss you out the door.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I see that now. I'll keep that in mind next time we have a disagreement.",
        "Cassie: I'm not saying we don't have to agree on everything, just that I want to know we're on the same side. That you support me.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll always support you, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Why can't Tammy find someone like you instead of Jonathan? He's a very angry person. He's just going to hurt her.",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe, maybe he can change.",
        "Cassie: Not Jonathan.",
        "Jeffrey: What about somebody else?",
        "Cassie: I guess that depends on who that somebody else is. Why are you asking me this?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, there's something I have to tell you about my past.",
        "Jeffrey: I probably should have told you this before, and I always wanted to. But, well, the time never seemed right. Not that now is the right time, but it is kind of important that you know.",
        "Cassie: That I know what?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not the man that you think I am, Cassie. And I've done some things that I've... well, I'd rather forget.",
        "Cassie: Okay, what kinds of things?",
        "Jeffrey: All this stuff going on with Jonathan, it just made me realize how much I was exactly like Jonathan. I was angry, isolated, always ready to snap at anyone who even looked at me the wrong way. And I had no self control. And then I was recruited into the agency, and they taught me some things. And I realized that I had skills, skills that were useful to them. And I was good. And it changed my life. I changed.",
        "Cassie: Is that it? That's your whole confession?",
        "Jeffrey: That's not enough?",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, I don't care if you got into trouble when you were a kid. I wasn't perfect, either, you know?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that means you're not...",
        "Cassie: Upset? No! Of course not. I'm glad you told me. I want to know everything there is to know about you. So what else are you hiding?",
        "Jeffrey: It's just, you know, I was just thinking about Jonathan, how he can change. And I know that's not what you want to hear right now, and... I just think he needs someone to show him how. And when I see him with Tammy and how he wants to protect her, I can't help but see a little bit of myself in him.",
        "Cassie: You are nothing like Jonathan. But you are on my list. ( Laughing ) So how did you like our first big fight? ( Laughing )",
        "Jeffrey: Well, as long as it always ends up like this. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: No. It's me. It's mine. Hello. Yeah, this is him. What? Why? Okay. Well, thanks for your hospitality.",
        "Tammy: Who was that?",
        "Jonathan: Mr. James, landlord from the Clayton Arms. Just called to tell me I've been evicted.",
        "Tammy: No way. They can't do that, can they?",
        "Jonathan: Apparently they can because he told me all of my stuff is thrown out in the lobby.",
        "Tammy: But why?",
        "Jonathan: Well, he heard a rumor that I might have started the fire at Sandy's place, and now he is thinking that I started the fire in your room, remember? So he doesn't want to have a \"pyromaniac\" running around setting the guest towels on fire.",
        "Tammy: That is so unfair. ( Loud knock on the door )",
        "Jonathan: That better not be Sandy.",
        "Reva: Whoo. I thought I might find you here. Is Tammy...",
        "Tammy: Hi, Aunt Reva.",
        "Reva: Hi. Sweetie, I hate to break up the little party, or whatever you're doing here, but I told your mother I was going to look after you, and I can't very well do that when you two keep disappearing on me. So do me a favor, pretend like you care what I think, and come home with me.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I think that is a good idea.",
        "Tammy: But what about you?",
        "Jonathan: I'll just sleep on the couch at Outskirts until I find another place.",
        "Reva: What happened to your place?",
        "Jonathan: The landlord just evicted me because he heard...",
        "Reva: I don't want to know! No. I don't want to know the details. Just get your stuff together and you come, too.",
        "Tammy: You mean...",
        "Reva: What I mean is you'll stay in Marah's room and you'll stay in your old room. There will be no little show and tells in the middle of the night. And if I catch you, then you will both be out on your butts.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, that's crazy, Reva.",
        "Reva: No, what it is, is the rule! It's one of them. And if you want to stay under my roof, then you will learn to abide by them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: No! I'm not seeing anybody. I was just agreeing with you, you know, about what you said, about the serious relationships.",
        "Dinah: Right, right. Did you see Alan-Michael again?",
        "Marina: No. No. I've just been, you know, keeping an eye on him for Harley, you know, while the cat is away...",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I understand that, believe me. Okay, if you have everything you need, I...",
        "Marina: You know, I think I'm good. I'm just going to make some calls, see if anyone can come out and see properties. Thank you so much, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: You're welcome. You know I'm glad to help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: We can't afford to wait for Harley. Fax them now; I'll take full responsibility. What's up?",
        "Dinah: Hello, I drafted some fresh releases. Take a look.",
        "Alan-Michael: All right. \"Profits soar while they search for missing Spaulding's.\"",
        "Dinah: There is more. Don't you want to read the rest?",
        "Alan-Michael: No, I trust you. Keep this thing going, and there may be a bonus when Alan returns.",
        "Dinah: If Alan returns.",
        "Alan-Michael: Alan will be fine.",
        "Dinah: Hello, when did we become a corporate gun-slinger?",
        "Alan Michael: Hey, I still like to play as hard as I work. How about you and me go on one of our little ventures? Bungee-jumping, skydiving, what's your poison?",
        "Dinah: None of it. That has changed for me. I don't do any of that stuff anymore. Although that could be because I was traumatized by a certain speed demon when I was a teenager.",
        "Alan-Michael: Come on, we rammed Frank and Harley with a motorcycle and look at us, we're still walking.",
        "Dinah: Yes, we are.",
        "Alan-Michael: You and me, we're made from the same mold. Yeah, we tried to live the life with the house and the kids, but all we really want to do is have fun.",
        "Dinah: Is that what we want, Alan-Michael? Thank you for clueing me in.",
        "Alan-Michael: I know you, Dinah. You want to be free, alone and unencumbered, no strings, no one shackling your soul.",
        "Dinah: What if somebody complements my soul?",
        "Alan-Michael: Before or after having sex?",
        "Dinah: All the time. What if he's rumored to be one of the mythical good guys?",
        "Alan-Michael: Then be with him. Just don't get yourself tied down.",
        "Dinah: Oh, because if you're tied down, then you can't do things like making love, and, you know, that would be terrible. You would probably rather write some boring press releases or order some cold hamburgers from room service. You know, it isn't so bad to be with somebody who wants to be with you. You should try it sometime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Let's get you warm, all right? Let's get your clothes off, and get you in a hot shower.",
        "Harley: I have a vision, I opened that car door, and I saw Gus's frozen body falling and landing right on top of me.",
        "Mallet: But that didn't happen, right? Because Gus wasn't in the car, which means Gus got out of the car and that means we'll find him in the morning, okay?",
        "Harley: I was thinking what am I going to tell the kids. What am I going to tell the kids? When I saw that car...",
        "Mallet: Come on, come on. All right. I've got to get you warm now. Gus...",
        "Harley: If anything has happened to him, Mallet...",
        "Mallet: Gus is going to be fine. He is probably warmer than you right now. He's a federal agent. He's trained in this kind of survival. You're the one I'm worried about right now. We've got to get you warm, all right?",
        "Harley: I can't loose him. I can't loose him.",
        "Mallet: Come here, come here. Shh... you won't. I promise you won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, fyi, Reva, we're both over 18, Tammy and I are adults.",
        "Reva: You may be adults, but I'm not running a love shack. Besides, sex complicates things. It only changes it everything.",
        "Jonathan: What makes you think we're not doing it already? I mean, it's not like we haven't done it before.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, that's what I thought. Now, look, I'm not trying to be some mean, old dorm mom here, but, you know, if you two are serious about wanting the world to know that you're serious about each other, then you'll take all of the time you need before you... okay?",
        "Tammy: Okay. Just one thing, what about my mom? She's going to freak when she finds out I'm living with Jonathan.",
        "Reva: We'll make her understand.",
        "Tammy: How?",
        "Reva: Ask me tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: She loves me, not Jonathan. He'll never hurt her again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So, please, don't ever ask me again if I'm on your side. Because you have to know that I am. I'm always going to be there for you because I love you. Now, it doesn't mean I might not have an opinion of my own every once in a while.",
        "Cassie: Occasionally, uh-huh.",
        "Jeffrey: So how long?",
        "Cassie: How long?",
        "Jeffrey: How long before we can get home and make up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Marina, well, did you get what you were looking for?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Dinah helped me out.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, good. Well, you know, if you ever do need someone to talk to, I'm a very good listener. I'll be here. I mean, Lizzie says I'm an excellent listener.",
        "Marina: Well, thank you, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. Do you know, he likes you. I can tell.",
        "Marina: Who?",
        "Alexandra: Alan-Michael. Don't worry, darling, I'm very good at keeping secrets. You are going to call that PI? The one who can help us find Alan?",
        "Alan-Michael: Absolutely. Right away. I want to bring him home. Hello, Phil. I'm glad I got right through to you. Yes. What are your dinner specials tonight? Roast beef, great. You still delivering? Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hey, Mallet. It's me, but I guess you know that, so I just wanted to say hello, and, um, good luck in trying to find Gus and all. And that I will see you really soon. Um, okay. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Sorry, I used to be so tough. I don't know what that was. You could throw anything at me and I could handle it, and now I'm like... I'm just out of control. I'm a mess.",
        "Mallet: I think you're acting like a woman who thought she lost her husband. I think that's okay. I mean, why do you think they don't let surgeons operate on family members or they don't let cops investigate family members? Because they're close to it. There's a lot of emotions. You're close to this one.",
        "Harley: You would never have acted like I just did.",
        "Mallet: I don't know about that. I think I would if it was someone close, you know. I've been known to be kind of human. I wasn't exactly stable when they tried to transfer you out of prison. So cut yourself some slack.",
        "Harley: Do I ever even say thank you for everything you're always doing for me?",
        "Mallet: Thank me? For what? I'm just a cop doing his job.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Lizzie: Coop! I'll take your mind off things.",
        "Ava: Where you going?",
        "Coop: Lizzie.",
        "Dinah: I found you.",
        "Buzz: You know what he needs right now? A diversion. Feel like giving him one?"
