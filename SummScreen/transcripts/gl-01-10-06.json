        "Lizzie and Coop are both looking forward to getting away together and Lizzie goes to the penthouse to prepare only to find Quinn there. She tells him he needs to leave but he toys with her, telling her he is going to stick around when Coop gets there and only ducks into a closet at the last minute. Lizzie gets Coop to leave and they go back to CO2. Buzz asks Olivia to do him a favor and take Frank out to distract him. After they leave, Ava asks Buzz why he did that when it is obvious he is interested. She also tells him what she is looking for in a guy and later when he sees her reaction to Coop hugging her for helping with an upset Zach, he tells her he won't tell her secret. Dinah finds Harley in Mallet's room but helps Harley out when the local police don't want to continue to look for Gus. Mallet lays into Harley for blocking their investigation. After Harley goes to her own room, Dinah questions Mallet about Harley and if their fight was for her sake. He is distant and when she says that she will go back to Springfield and get out of his hair, he tells her that may be a good idea. Harley goes to the crash site again and finds a picture of her and Gus, letting her know she is on the right track."

        "Frank: I'm not commenting on anything right now, because it's an ongoing investigation. No, I'm not saying anything because there is nothing to say, don't you understand that?",
        "Olivia: Hey.",
        "Buzz: Hey you.",
        "Olivia: What is up with...",
        "Buzz: Gus.",
        "Olivia: Have you heard anything?",
        "Buzz: Mallet and Harley found Gus' car, but there is no sign of him.",
        "Coop: Pops.",
        "Buzz: Huh?",
        "Coop: Hey, this order just came in.",
        "Buzz: Josh Lewis. Olivia, you know what Frank needs right now? A diversion. You feel like giving him one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hi, I found you. I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to help.",
        "Mallet: Hey. Hey, how are you?",
        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Mallet: What are you doing here?",
        "Dinah: Well, I just wanted to see what was going on.",
        "Mallet: Did you drive all the way out from Springfield?",
        "Dinah: Well, yeah, I did. I uh... I don't know, it was sort of eating at me, you know. Knowing something was going on out there, I just had to find out.",
        "Harley: Well, we don't know much more than we knew before. We found a limo, but um... Gus and alan weren't in there. It was empty.",
        "Mallet: All the ice covered up the footprints. We couldn't really see anything leading from car.",
        "Dinah: And now you're here.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, with the cold and the snow, we thought we thought we'd head back here and start fresh in the morning, in the daylight.",
        "Harley: I'm going to go check on my room. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: Hold on. I've got to take this. Excuse me.",
        "Harley: Hey. Thank you so much for coming here, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Sure. My goodness, looking for Gus must be driving you crazy.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Dinah: Hey, you know what? Mallet is capable. He's going to be able to help you out.",
        "Harley: He is. He is.",
        "Dinah: You know, I'm not going to lie. A guy like that, you know, he would drive me crazy, but I kind of like having someone like that around, you know.",
        "Harley: Someone like?",
        "Dinah: Well, someone without an agenda. I mean, he's a good guy. It feels like I really know him, and it is not so terrible to have him, you know, in my life.",
        "Harley: Wow. Like I said, you guys might be good together, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Well, one step at a time, okay. ( Knock at the door )",
        "Harley: Chief Parker, yes, do you have any other information about my husband? Hey! Any prints on the car? Any tire tread analysis, anything like that?",
        "Chief Parker: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just slow down. Now we've already done some of those tests.",
        "Harley: Some of them-- which ones?",
        "Chief Parker: We didn't find any latent prints anywhere in that car-- not that it would have mattered if we had.",
        "Harley: What do you mean?",
        "Chief Parker: I mean latent prints are not going to give any clues as to why these guys disappeared.",
        "Harley: No, that would require you going out there and looking for them in the cold, and...",
        "Chief Parker: I don't think this is a police matter. I'm pulling my men off the case.",
        "Harley: Fine. I'll find them myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: What kind of distraction are you talking about? You know because in some small circles I'm considered a lady.",
        "Buzz: I'm considered a gentlemen. I mean, something simple, you know, walk, talk, anything to take his mind off of Alan.",
        "Olivia: Nothing serious?",
        "Buzz: No, just a... you know, walk. Take him to the lake.",
        "Olivia: Lake?",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: But you have no hidden agenda in any of this, would you?",
        "Buzz: Me? No, nothing there. Like what?",
        "Olivia: Well, you know, trying to push something between Frank and me?",
        "Buzz: No. But you know if something were to transpire, it wouldn't be the worst thing that could happen to you. I know you had your beat on Josh. You said awful nice things about Frank. Mr. Lewis doesn't seem to be here, so who would it hurt?",
        "Olivia: Frank's feelings.",
        "Buzz: Well, then, be nice to him.",
        "Olivia: All right. All right, just because he's having a tough day. But nothing complicated, all right?",
        "Buzz: No. Good girl.",
        "Olivia: I... no, I... I'm going.",
        "Frank: I still don't have anything to say. Could you do me a favor, just lose the cell phone number. Okay? Thank you.",
        "Olivia: Rough day?",
        "Frank: Hi. Yeah, actually. Rough day, rough night, week.",
        "Olivia: Would you like to take a break?",
        "Frank: I would love to do that, Olivia, but um...",
        "Olivia: Oh, good then. Here. You know, I was thinking maybe we take a walk down the lake, and you know some place well out of cell phone range.",
        "Frank: You now, that sounds terrific, and I would really like to... why not? Why not? Absolutely. You know, I can't promise you it will be out of cell phone range, though.",
        "Olivia: Well, then ignore those calls for an hour or so.",
        "Frank: All right. Hey, pop, if anybody calls, I'm busy.",
        "Buzz: All right, good for you!",
        "Josh: Hello, Buzz. What do you know? Huh?",
        "Buzz: Oh, nothing, but then again, maybe too much.",
        "Josh: Well that sounds about right. I called in an order earlier.",
        "Buzz: Oh, yeah, coming right up. Hey, why don't you stick around and keep me company?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'd really love to, but I've got a client who is interested in a piece of property down by the lake. In fact, I'm headed down there now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Hey. You're okay, I can take off?",
        "Ava: Sure, you and Lizzie, are you going out to eat?",
        "Coop: No, not exactly. She has got this place-- well, it's a penthouse, actually.",
        "Ava: Really?",
        "Coop: Yeah, her grandfather gave her keys for a while, and it's a place that we can go and hang out, and get away from the world for a little bit. It even has a jacuzzi with a penthouse view.",
        "Ava: Wow, it sounds really nice.",
        "Coop: I'll see you later, okay?",
        "Ava: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing here?",
        "Quinn: This is my place.",
        "Lizzie: I don't care. You've got to get out of here right now. You can't be here. Whoa, whoa, hang on. Um... (Quinn laughing ) here. Put this on. Coop's going to be here any minute.",
        "Quinn: Yikes, there's a dilemma. Oh, I get it. You mean that kiss wasn't for me.",
        "Lizzie: You know it wasn't for you.",
        "Quinn: I'm decent.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Quinn: Well, not decent, but I'm covered.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, congratulations. Bye-bye.",
        "Quinn: It's kind of hard to tear myself away. One minute I'm sitting in my apartment in my hot tub having a nice soak and the next thing I know some hot, blonde babe has her--",
        "Lizzie: Okay. I'm not a hot, blond, babe, okay?",
        "Quinn: Really?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I am hot, but still, not to you. My boyfriend will be here any minute. Okay? And he cannot walk in this door seeing me with a naked man.",
        "Quinn: Sounds like a personal problem, but this is my place.",
        "Lizzie: But you told me I could use it whenever I wanted.",
        "Quinn: Except when I need it. Didn't you get my message?",
        "Lizzie: What message?",
        "Quinn: Check your voicemail. \"Lizzie, hi. It's Quinn. I'm using the apartment tonight. Only come over if you want to see my big--\"",
        "Lizzie: Ugh! Okay, okay. So you left a message. You left a message, but that doesn't solve our problem.",
        "Quinn: Your problem.",
        "Lizzie: No. Right now, you are my problem. And you need to get out.",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Lizzie: Ugh. If he finds out you're lending this to me, he's going to wonder what your getting in return.",
        "Quinn: That sounds sorted. What kind of guy are you dating?",
        "Lizzie: Uh, we're in our love nest with a naked man.",
        "Quinn: And you can't tell him the truth? Lizzie, is that a healthy relationship.",
        "Lizzie: Quinn, please.",
        "Quinn: I can get un-naked.",
        "Lizzie: Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Quinn: First of all, let me explain something to you. I'm lending you my place, remember that? I shouldn't have to be ashamed of helping out a friend. And you shouldn't have to be ashamed of my friendship. ( Knocking at the door )",
        "Lizzie: ( Gasps ) He's here. Quinn, don't stand there, come on.",
        "Coop: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I gave him a key.",
        "Quinn: I never said you can give Scooper a key. ( Knocking at the door )",
        "Lizzie: This is going to be the worst night of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Josh.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Buzz: Can I ask you something?",
        "Josh: The coffee sucks.",
        "Buzz: No, something personal.",
        "Josh: Oh. Sorry. Yeah. What?",
        "Buzz: I'm just curious.",
        "Josh: About what?",
        "Buzz: You and Reva?",
        "Josh: Has she been talking to you?",
        "Buzz: No, no.",
        "Josh: All right. Well, I think most people know we're split up, right now. And I don't see any end to that in sight. In fact, we haven't even told the kids yet.",
        "Buzz: You're seeing someone else?",
        "Josh: Okay, this is now officially a really weird conversation.",
        "Buzz: No, I'm just trying to uh...",
        "Josh: Trying to what?",
        "Buzz: I'm trying to-- hold your horses, I'm getting to it. I'm trying to uh... well, I was thinking about getting back in the dating circuit, and I was wondering what that was like.",
        "Josh: Honestly, Buzz, I don't know.",
        "Buzz: No? Well, that's good.",
        "Josh: Is it?",
        "Buzz: Well, yeah, because then you and I could...",
        "Josh: What? Date? What are you talking about?",
        "Buzz: Well...",
        "Josh: Go out together, pick up chicks, or something like that?",
        "Buzz: ( Stammering )",
        "Josh: You know what?",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Josh: I'm going to take my stuff and go because you're really freaking me out now. All right? Thanks a lot. See you around.",
        "Ava: Nice try.",
        "Buzz: With what?",
        "Ava: ( Laughs ) it was a good thought, though, trying to match up your son.",
        "Buzz: What's the matter with a little match-making?",
        "Ava: I don't know. You're the one who really likes Olivia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: This reporter says he has an inside source, but I blocked down the department. So I know no one is talking.",
        "Olivia: No, no. Except maybe you.",
        "Frank: I'm sorry. Am I rambling on?",
        "Olivia: No. The point of this is to take your mind off of this.",
        "Frank: You're right, you're absolutely right. Especially when the alternative is so much more attractive.",
        "Olivia: You know I have never been down to the lake this way?",
        "Frank: Really?",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Frank: Wow, you know, I come down here all of the time.",
        "Olivia: Really?",
        "Frank: Mm-hmm. I love the view of the lake from here. Especially the lighthouse. You see that lighthouse there on the other shore?",
        "Olivia: That I don't get. Why would they build another one when they have that one? We need more than one?",
        "Frank: ( Laughs ) You know, I guess it's an attraction, you know. I agree with you, I don't like it either. You know, but the interesting thing is that when the two beams of light actually join up, the whole sky lights up. It's as if somebody reached up and pulled down the moon right on to the lake. The water glows like somebody poured a bucket of stars right out on to the surface. It's actually quite beautiful.",
        "Olivia: Frank Cooper, that was almost poetic.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You want to run through the investigation? I will.",
        "Dinah: Harley, Mallet is going to help you--",
        "Harley: My brother Frank is chief of police in Springfield. He'll take care of it. You're going to pull your men off the case that could involve a murder? The man we're looking for, Alan Spaulding, was tried and convicted of murdering his other son! You want to give him the chance to get away with murdering one more!",
        "Chief Parker: I just don't think it sounds like a murder case.",
        "Harley: My husband is gone!",
        "Chief Parker: Well maybe there's another explanation for that, ma'am.",
        "Harley: Like what? Like what? What are saying?",
        "Chief Parker: Maybe your husband just had enough of you.",
        "Dinah: Why don't you watch it!",
        "Mallet: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Enough, enough, enough! Stop both of you!",
        "Chief Parker: Okay, okay. We're done here.",
        "Mallet: No, hold on a second, Chief. In the room, in the room. Both of you in the room.",
        "Chief Parker: You've got to get a muzzle on that woman.",
        "Mallet: She's upset, her husband is missing, and he suspects foul play.",
        "Chief Parker: Yeah, well, that's not our problem anymore.",
        "Mallet: Like it wasn't our problem last year when we helped you catch a fugitive that escaped from your own jail.",
        "Chief Parker: Look, I already told you, we appreciated that.",
        "Mallet: This request is coming straight from my Chief. How about you show us how much you appreciated last year by giving us an hand. What do you say, Chief.",
        "Chief Parker: Fine, I'll see what I can do.",
        "Mallet: I appreciate that. And I'll handle that little badger in there.",
        "Chief Parker: Yeah, you do that.",
        "Mallet: Right. Thank you. What is your problem?",
        "Harley: My husband is missing; he could be dead. What's yours?",
        "Mallet: That you're not helping us get any closer to finding Gus by acting like a wild banshee.",
        "Harley: I was holding that law enforcement officer accountable for--",
        "Mallet: You should have been kissing his butt.",
        "Harley: Kissing his what?",
        "Mallet: Do you know that any other time that's exactly what you should've been doing.",
        "Harley: That guy is a total jerk!",
        "Mallet: No, I don't think so, Cooper. The only jerk around here right now is you.",

        "Kim Zimmer and Robert Newman, inside \"The Light.\" Being a part of this show... It's just an extraordinary thing. What can I say about our viewers? Thank you of spending so much time with us. I'm a musical junky. I'm kind of a loner. I would like to believe there is some kind of cosmic connection between all of us. It's cool. See Josh and Reva on Wednesday, January 11, inside \"The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Okay, all right. Now, come on, stop it. Take a breath here.",
        "Harley: I'm being a jerk?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you heard what I said?",
        "Harley: I'm the jerk?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I think you're look acting like a jerk right now!",
        "Harley: My husband is missing! I don't know what Alan's done to him or vice a versa, but I do know that Alan is a bad man, and that's not good! I've got a crime scene that needs an investigation and this waste of a cop comes in here--",
        "Mallet: Would you just calm down and look at the facts, okay?! I know this is a very personal thing for you right now. We've got to treat it like a job, okay?",
        "Dinah: Okay. You know what? Why don't you cut her some slack. She's looking for her missing husband; the cops won't help. I would freak out, too!",
        "Mallet: I understand that. I understand that, Harley, I do. But, please, just use your head.",
        "Harley: Stop treating me like I don't know what I'm doing.",
        "Mallet: Then stop acting like it then.",
        "Dinah: All right. You know what? The two of you stop it. Now you stop it. You take a deep breath and you calm yourselves down. Obviously, we need the local Barney Fife to help you, but you know what? The two of you need each other a whole lot more, so why don't you deal with it!",
        "Mallet: Yeah, okay, okay. It's okay by me.",
        "Harley: That's fine, but I am not going to miss--",
        "Dinah: No buts! Stop it! You said you cannot look at the crash site because of the weather. So that means you've got to get yourself ready for tomorrow. And I suggest that's what you guys do.",
        "Harley: I'm sorry I freaked out. Okay? I'm sorry. You made sure that guy's actually going to still going to work with us, so that is good, thank you.",
        "Mallet: And I uh... I didn't... I'm sorry I called you a jerk.",
        "Harley: This whole thing's such a mess. I'm going back to my room.",
        "Mallet: Harley...",
        "Harley: I'll see you first thing in the morning, okay?",
        "Mallet: We'll find him, okay? First thing! Sorry about that. I... you were right. I don't know. Harley and I, sometimes, we just get into it like some...",
        "Dinah: Like some old married couple.",
        "Mallet: I was going to say like two people that hate each other.",
        "Dinah: Please. She was naked in your shower in your room. Did you just do all of that right now for my benefit?",
        "Mallet: What do you mean?",

        "Coop: I thought you liked it here?",
        "Lizzie: I do. I just... I was putting this on, and I couldn't get it on before I got to the door.",
        "Coop: All right, look. I don't mind seeing you half dressed, or, rather, hopefully undressed. Look, I was just worried about you, okay. Are you all right?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I'm great. You know, I think we should go.",
        "Coop: What? Lizzie, I just got here?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know, but you know with everything that is going on between Alan and Gus, it would really be better if we were there. I mean we can't just sit around in the hot tub. Come on, we should go.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I thought you wanted to get away from that stuff.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but I'm a big girl. I mean I can handle it. We should go over there and spend time with your dad and Harley, okay?",
        "Coop: Okay. All right.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I forgot my purse.",
        "Coop: All right, I'll--",

        "Lizzie: It's not a pretty sight. You don't want to do that.",
        "Quinn: Sounds exciting. Come here.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. You have 30 seconds to get to the bottom line, what do you want from me?",
        "Quinn: ( Laughing ) Relax, I wasn't going to come between you and pooper scooper or try to hurt you in any way. If you think you need to keep secrets from the guy, that's your business, not mine. ( Knock at the door )",
        "Coop: Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: You're going to stay out of my business?",
        "Quinn: Sure. Oh, and uh... can you hang this up for me on your way out?",
        "Lizzie: Coop, I'll be right there! Hey. Mmm. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: I don't mean to pry, but you know I used to work for Olivia. She can be a little complicated, but I could see how you would be attracted to her.",
        "Buzz: Olivia and I are just friends. Frank wants something more. I've had something more a lot in my life, but he wants to be happy. He should be happy and he and Olivia are sort of you know, a better fit. Anyone can see that. I can see that. I'm never wrong about these things.",
        "Ava: You're secret is safe with me.",
        "Buzz: Hey, buddy, what's wrong?",
        "Nanny: Sorry, Mr. Cooper, he saw Gus on tv and he got upset.",
        "Buzz: Oh, that's okay, Kristen. Hey, you, come here. Come on. Gus is going to be okay.",
        "Zach: No, he's not. I want Gus. I want Mommy.",
        "Ava: Hey, Zach? Can I tell you something? You miss your mom and Gus, don't you? Yeah, boy, that sure does hurt sometimes. But, it's a good thing, you know why? Because when I was about your age, I was really worried about my parents, too. But I knew if I kept how I felt really strong in my heart right here, that they were going to come back to me. And, guess what?",
        "Zach: What?",
        "Ava: It worked. Gus and Mommy are going to come back, too. I promise.",

        "Olivia: It really is beautiful.",
        "Frank: It really is.",
        "Josh: Hello.",
        "Frank: Josh.",
        "Olivia: Hi, Josh.",
        "Josh: Are you guys just out for a walk or something or--",
        "Frank: No, we're just trying to get away from the grind, you know. What are you doing up here?",
        "Josh: Well I-- oh, yes, I have a client I'm showing some property to.",
        "Olivia: I was just helping Frank take his mind off this mess with Gus and Alan. And the press that this is getting, and everyone's calling him, so...",
        "Josh: Right. Yeah, that's got to be pretty tough. How'd Harley holding up by the way?",
        "Frank: Well, she's... ( cell phone rings ) excuse me. Sorry, guys, I've got to take this. Cooper.",
        "Josh: Poor guy.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Josh: It's nice of you to help him out like this.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, well, that's why I thought it would be nice to go out on a date.",
        "Josh: Is that what this is? This is a date then?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. I know, it is strange, Frank and me, but, you know, I'm single. And, look, somebody was bound to come along and snatch me up. You look a little surprised?",
        "Josh: No, no. I didn't imagine that you would be back in the dating pool with Frank Cooper.",
        "Olivia: Oh, I'm taking a swan dive, baby.",
        "Josh: Well, it looks like it is working out.",
        "Olivia: It is. It is great.",
        "Frank: Olivia, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for doing this to you, but I've got to go.",
        "Olivia: Oh, I thought you were taking a break from all of that.",
        "Frank: That was the intention, but I have to brief the interim Mayor on this whole deal between Gus and Alan. I'm sorry. I was having such a nice time, too.",
        "Olivia: Me, too. I'm sorry you have to go.",
        "Frank: Yeah. Hey, Josh, can you do me a favor, make sure that Olivia gets back safe and sound, okay?",
        "Josh: Sure.",
        "Frank: Thanks. Talk to you later.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Josh: I'll see you, Frank. Tell Harley I'm thinking about her. You know what, I apologize, because if I had known you were out here on a date with Frank Cooper, I would have gone a different way and left you to your privacy.",
        "Olivia: No. I'm actually glad you showed up when you did.",
        "Josh: Why is that.",
        "Olivia: I'm a little nervous.",
        "Josh: I've known you to be a lot of things, but nervous is not one of them.",
        "Olivia: Well, I haven't been in a dating pool for so long. All of a sudden you're out with someone because you didn't know what happened, and you're sitting here banging your head looking for something to say like an idiot.",
        "Josh: Just an observation, Frank Cooper doesn't really seem like uh...",
        "Olivia: My type? So he's not the filthy rich man of the universe kind of guy...",
        "Josh: I didn't say that.",
        "Olivia: You didn't have to. The truth is I've been spending too much time in the Spaulding world. Maybe I don't know what my type is, but I do know I want someone with values, I do, who comes from an honest place, and is strong, but sensitive, and caring, and easy on the eyes.",
        "Josh: Well, that sounds like Frank.",
        "Olivia: It's not like I'm head over heels in love with the guy. I mean, he's great to take a walk with. I'm just not going to limit myself right now.",
        "Josh: I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Olivia: You are?",
        "Josh: Yeah. I do have to say this, though, you're not going to do a whole lot better than Bill.",
        "Olivia: No, but maybe there's someone out there that is just as good. I have to believe that.",
        "Josh: Okay. I really did come here to work. So I've got a client who wants to spend a lot of money on a piece of property, so I've got to go track that down. I'll see you, all right.",
        "Olivia: Hey, Josh, I was just thinking maybe that you'd like to consider a site-- a site for the building. If you look right out there, you see that lighthouse?",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Olivia: When its beam meets the beam from the other lighthouse, it's like a double bucket of light just spread over the lake. It is really magical. You should watch. It's worth the wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Well, it looks like we're having a good time here. What is going on?",
        "Buzz: You missed a professional at work. He comes in here and he is in a meltdown because of Gus was on the news. I couldn't do anything with him. I was about to bribe him with an inappropriate amount of sugar, and Ava steps up, knocks one out of the park. And look, we've got a happy, calm, laughing little child there.",
        "Coop: Really?",
        "Buzz: Yeah. She's something special.",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Ava: Hi.",
        "Coop: Come here.",
        "Ava: What was that for?",
        "Coop: There has been a lot going on, it's been kind of tough going through all this stuff, and it seems every day it is eating away at us a little more and more. But when you have somebody who kind of steps up, it really does mean a lot. You know, to find someone like you, I just think that we're pretty lucky.",
        "Ava: Thanks.",
        "Coop: She's pretty cool, isn't she?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, she's amazing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You know, I'm not saying there is anything going on between you and Harley.",
        "Mallet: Then what are you saying?",
        "Dinah: Number one: You're pretty defensive right now. Number two: Nothing's going on, but you still feel you need to prove it to me.",
        "Mallet: Thanks.",
        "Dinah: You know, you don't need to do that. I don't care if you are rubbing elbows with your ex-wife while she's looking for her missing husband.",
        "Mallet: There isn't any rubbing going on.",
        "Dinah: You know what, that's none of my business.",
        "Mallet: I am, um, here to do a job, which is to help Harley find Gus.",
        "Dinah: I know.",
        "Mallet: It just never really occurred to me I would have to reassure you of anything.",
        "Dinah: I'm wrong. Hey, I'm wrong. I'm wrong. And I will drop the whole thing.",
        "Mallet: Don't worry about it. It's no big deal.",
        "Dinah: No big deal, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: It would help to be psychic. Where are you, Gus?",

        "Josh: You're right, it's very nice.",
        "Olivia: And it is right here in our own backyard.",
        "Josh: How did you know about this? Do you spend a lot of time down here or...",
        "Olivia: Yeah, yeah-- no. I come down here when I want to think about my life.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Olivia: And what I want, what's next.",
        "Josh: Well, I hope that works out for you.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Yeah. I actually, um, am down here to work. So I've got to go.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but you know, Josh, you're forgetting something.",
        "Josh: What is that?",
        "Olivia: Well, Frank asked you to look after me.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but I think he meant that in a more general sense, don't you? I mean, like making sure you don't fall into the lake.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you're not going to ditch me, are you?",
        "Josh: No, of course not. Come walk with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Well, I guess you really have the magic touch with little Zach. I'm just going to have to tell Harley.",
        "Ava: I'm just doing what is natural.",
        "Buzz: See, I told you, she's a natural.",
        "Lizzie: Can we go, because I'm sort of starving.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Yeah, sure. I know you said it was no big deal, what you did, but it really was, so thank you.",
        "Ava: No problem.",
        "Buzz: Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Did I tell you how sorry I am about before?",
        "Mallet: Um, what's there to be sorry about?",
        "Dinah: Well, you know, I think I came off a little petty and insecure, and I'm not the crazy stalker that everybody thinks I am.",
        "Mallet: What are you talking about? Isn't that what I said I was looking for in my personal ad?",
        "Dinah: Ha-ha. You know, um, if I ever lost you to another woman, I wouldn't blame the woman.",
        "Mallet: You'd blame the guy?",
        "Dinah: I would blame myself for being stupid.",
        "Mallet: You're not being stupid. I just got to find Gus and Alan, you know, and then everything can get back to normal.",
        "Dinah: Sweetie, if I wanted normal, then I wouldn't be with you.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughing ) Hold it, is that a compliment?",
        "Dinah: I'm going to do you a favor.",
        "Mallet: What is that?",
        "Dinah: I'm going to get out of your hair tomorrow. You know, you don't need me around. I can let you and Harley just do your work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Gus might have did something to alan, that can't be undone. That's why I need your help. If it requires something kind of outside of the perimeters of the law...",
        "Mallet: Are you asking me if I would look the other way? Maybe it would be better if you went back to town.",
        "Harley: Gus.",
        "Gus: I know you've been worried, going crazy thinking, here we go again.",
        "Harley: Where are you? I'm scared.",
        "Gus: It's all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Harley: You can't promise me that.",
        "Gus: Who says.",
        "Harley: Life is all that much sweeter when you're here.",
        "Gus: I'll see you soon. I'll see you real soon.",

        "Reva: Your father and I are separated.",
