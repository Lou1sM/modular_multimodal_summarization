        "Marina: Coop, I can't do this.",
        "Coop: Marina, yes, you can.",
        "Marina: How? How? How am I supposed to do this? I mean, the news about Danny is bad enough, but when Rick finds out that Michelle may never be coming home...",
        "Coop: Marina. Marina, listen. Rick and Mel need to be told. Besides Tony, you're the only one who knows exactly what happened.",
        "Marina: It's just... Robbie. I mean, how are they going to tell him that his parents are never coming home? I have to do this.",
        "Coop: Yeah, you do.",
        "Marina: I have to do this. It's just, um, well, if I say it out loud, then it's going to actually be true. I mean, up until now, I've been pretending that maybe it's all been just a bad dream, you know? But Coop, it's not. Danny is really dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Okay, so can somebody just say something now? The silence is driving me crazy. You know, show some relief. We're going home. (Cheers)",
        "Danny: What about Holly? What do you want to do about her?",
        "Tony: You think she's going to come?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I don't know. She has some weird connection with Sebastian. I guess she needed to say goodbye.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I guess there's a time when we all have to do that.",
        "Tony: Yup.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: I've said goodbye to Roger and I can say goodbye to you.",
        "Sebastian: I'm begging you to forgive me, Holly, because I can't live without you.",
        "Holly: Have a nice life, Sebastian.",
        "Sebastian: I plan to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Hey, you almost ready to go?",
        "Rick: Uh, yeah, just a second. I was just checking next week's schedule.",
        "Mel: Oh, honey, before you...",
        "Rick: Whoa, wait, whoa. You took next week off?",
        "Mel: I did. I actually took the next three weeks off. It was supposed to be a surprise.",
        "Rick: Really. What kind of surprise?",
        "Mel: I chartered a boat.",
        "Rick: A boat?",
        "Mel: Yeah. I felt terrible about shooting your family sailing trip down. I knew how much you wanted to get away.",
        "Rick: Honey, I really did, but we can't go now.",
        "Mel: What? It's all you've been talking about for the last month.",
        "Rick: I know, and it's ironic because Beth was encouraging us to go, too, but Harley's facing murder charges for killing Phillip and the timing is just bad.",
        "Mel: I see.",
        "Rick: You're not mad that this is about Phillip again, are you?",
        "Mel: No. No, I'm mad because it's about Beth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: (Shivers) I thought we were going to eat.",
        "Gus: We just need a little privacy.",
        "Harley: It is freezing out here. Are you crazy? And what do we need privacy for? I mean there's nobody in the restaurant anyway.",
        "Gus: I'd like to talk about the case, so just...",
        "Harley: Well, we can talk about the case in the car, where it's warm.",
        "Gus: I'm just asking you...",
        "Harley: Come on. I'm hungry.",
        "Gus: All I'm asking for is a minute.",
        "Harley: Okay, can I say something?",
        "Gus: A minute of your time.",
        "Harley: I don't think it's fair of you to deprive me of what could be my last good meal, because prison food sucks.",
        "Gus: First of all, I will pin Phillip's murder on anything that moves before I let you go to prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Stop the plane! Please, stop the plane! Help me!",
        "Sebastian: It's too late, Holly. Won't do any good. The pilot belongs to me now. Everyone has his price.",
        "Holly: Where are you taking me?",
        "Sebastian: This is our second chance. We're lucky. Not everyone gets a second chance.",
        "Holly: You're alive. You have your whole life ahead of you. You don't need me anymore.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, no, you are wrong. I need you more than ever. It's not that I don't want to live without you. It's that I can't.",
        "Holly: You have to. I want to go back to my life in Springfield.",
        "Sebastian: You hardly have a life at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Marina, I'm truly sorry about what happened to Danny. I am.",
        "Marina: No. You know, I am just so sick of everything being so hard, you know. That's what I liked about Danny. When we were together, we just... we just had fun, you know. It was nice and normal.",
        "Coop: What's that?",
        "Marina: Exactly. None of us even know what that means anymore. I mean Danny had a lot of stuff, too, a lot of hard stuff. But when it was just him and me, it was nice. I'm going to miss that. I'm really going to miss him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Rick, Beth is not your wife. I am.",
        "Rick: Honey, you can't be jealous of Beth.",
        "Mel: I'm not jealous. I just don't understand why you have to go to her to talk to her. I mean it's like she knows you",
        "Rick: That's not true. Honey, you're overreacting with this.",
        "Mel: I am not. I am just reacting. Why didn't you tell me that you changed your mind about the sailing trip? Rick, I love you. You're my husband, but ever since Phillip died, you've completely shut me off.",
        "Rick: My best friend was murdered. And you haven't been supportive of my grieving process. You wouldn't even go to the funeral with me no matter how many times I asked you. It's almost like you're glad that he's dead.",
        "Mel: That is not true. That is not true at all. Okay, I just could not stand to see the pain that he was pain you through and everybody else.",
        "Rick: He was in the middle of a nervous breakdown. He was sick.",
        "Mel: I'm just not sure if that was just sickness or plain cruelty. No matter what I can't be a part of the \"oh, what are we going to do without Phillip club.\" Okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Rick: Me, too.",
        "Mel: Where are you going?",
        "Rick: I'm just... anywhere but here.",
        "Marina: Rick?",
        "Rick: Excuse I can't talk right now, Marina. Excuse me.",
        "Marina: Do you think he knows?",
        "Coop: How could he know?",
        "Marina: I guess he couldn't.",
        "Marina: I'm going to go find Mel.",
        "Lizzie: Henry, you didn't show up for work this afternoon.",
        "Coop: Oh, well, hello to you to, Lizzie. I was busy with... play it cool. If you make her mad, then she won't sell Company back. Look, I'm sorry. It was a jerk thing for me to do not to call you. And I apologize for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey, Mel.",
        "Mel: Oh, hey, Marina what's up?",
        "Marina: I need to talk to you and Rick.",
        "Mel: You know what? I'm really not in the mood for this.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, neither am I. But Mel... Mel, Danny's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Can I... can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "Michelle: Sure. Tony, do you mind? I actually wanted to talk to you, too. But I thought... I don't know. I don't even know what I thought.",
        "Danny: I can go first.",
        "Michelle: No, you know what? I think I'd better.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: I just wanted to explain to you why I came here and why I left.",
        "Danny: I think I know.",
        "Michelle: Well, you probably think that I was running away from you or from something, right? And I was actually trying to find something.",
        "Danny: Did you find it?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I think I did. Yeah. God, I don't know why this is so hard to talk about. But we tried, right? I mean we did. I mean from what I've heard, we've been trying since the day we first met.",
        "Danny: Pretty much.",
        "Michelle: I really wish I could remember.",
        "Danny: But you don't. It's okay.",
        "Michelle: No, it's not. But I'm not exactly sure that that would really change anything. You know I remembered us in the villa and it was really good. I definitely felt something. Not really how much we loved each other, but definitely that we loved each other.",
        "Danny: But you're not feeling it now.",
        "Michelle: No. Not for you.",
        "Danny: Michelle, it's okay. You don't have to say it. I know.",
        "Michelle: Well, you don't have to be so nice either. I mean you came all this way to save your wife.",
        "Danny: No, I actually came all this way to save you. My wife... I lost my wife last year in that explosion.",
        "Michelle: I'm so sorry that you lost her.",
        "Danny: Yeah, me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Okay, so I just want to talk about strategy.",
        "Harley: Great.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Don't you think we should figure out whether I'm actually the killer?",
        "Gus: It doesn't matter.",
        "Harley: It does matter.",
        "Gus: I represent you either way. But if it really matters to you...",
        "Harley: Don't you want to know a little?",
        "Gus: We have talked about this a million times.",
        "Harley: A million times. I know. You think I'm innocent.",
        "Gus: I know that you're innocent. But if you're not sure, we will make sure, okay. And the way to do that is start at the beginning.",
        "Harley: At the beginning. Beginning.",
        "Gus: The beginning. Yes.",
        "Harley: We have to retrace Ruth Karloff steps from the day she was born.",
        "Gus: Yes. And this way we'll have no doubt. Okay, and maybe we will find the real killer.",
        "Harley: See if she's standing in front of you freezing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Rick, what are you doing?",
        "Rick: I think that's my line.",
        "Rick: Beth, what was so interesting out there?",
        "Beth: Harley.",
        "Rick: She's not the killer.",
        "Beth: Well, the police think that she is. And even her own brother arrested her.",
        "Rick: I don't care what... I don't believe it of her anymore than I would believe you would do something like that.",
        "Beth: People are not always what they seem. Everyone has secrets. Everyone is capable of...",
        "Rick: I don't believe it. Well, I certainly don't want to believe it.",
        "Beth: Well, it's true. And if you were watching, like I was just watching, you would know it.",
        "Rick: Watching. Watching. So this is the first time?",
        "Beth: (Laughs) I had to see, okay?",
        "Rick: What? See what if she was acting guilty?",
        "Harley: Beth, if you have something to ask me, just ask.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Holly, you have nothing to go back to.",
        "Holly: I have a life. I have my family. I have Blake and the kids and Ross, and my work.",
        "Sebastian: No, no. Blake and Ross and their family, they have their own lives. Busy lives. They barely missed a beat while you were gone.",
        "Holly: I don't believe that.",
        "Sebastian: As far as your work... come on. That newspaper doesn't inspire you anymore. Am I right?",
        "Holly: No.",
        "Sebastian: I don't believe you something's missing. And it has been for a long time.",
        "Holly: You don't know me.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, no, I do. I do know you, Holly. I know you better than anyone.",
        "Harley: Yeah, you know me so well, what am I thinking right now?",
        "Sebastian: What are you thinking right now? You're thinking that you're glad I'm here. That you are not ready to leave me.",
        "Holly: You are insane!",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. You are lonely, Holly. Let me ask you a question. When was the last time you made love?",
        "Holly: That's none of your business.",
        "Sebastian: When was it?",
        "Holly: A long time ago. And I'm better off for it.",
        "Sebastian: Are you?",
        "Holly: What are you implying that I am somehow incomplete without a man in my life?",
        "Sebastian: No. I'm just pointing out that your life's been as empty as mine.",
        "Holly: My life. My life is nothing like yours.",
        "Sebastian: We were lost, Holly. We found each other. We belong together. Okay, maybe we discovered it in the most unusual of circumstances, but we can't...",
        "Holly: Unusual?",
        "Sebastian: We can't ignore it. We have a chance here for something truly extraordinary.",
        "Holly: Sebastian, the only thing extraordinary is your imagination. This is all in your head.",
        "Sebastian: It's in your head, too. You can't get it out. That's the thing. You want this as much as I do. I can tell.",
        "Holly: No.",
        "Sebastian: Yes. You've been sleep walking through your life. I woke you up. Now, granted, you've been angry and you've been scared. But you have been alive. And it's been years since you felt this alive. Now you tell me that I'm wrong?",
        "Holly: No, you're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: I don't believe that. I don't believe any of us. Danny's gone. Michelle...",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Mel: We have to call somebody. Wait. What if Tony can't find Ed? Rick will know what to do.",
        "Marina: Where did he go?",
        "Mel: I don't know. But I'll find him. Robbie.",
        "Marina: Where is he?",
        "Mel: He's here at the daycare center. One of the nurses is bringing him down for me. Oh, God. He could lose both of his parents. Can you...",
        "Marina: Yeah, yeah, I'll stay.",
        "Mel: Okay. Okay, good. Thank you. Hey. Hey, Robbie. Auntie Mel has got to go out for a little while, but Marina is going to stay and hang out with you, okay, until I get back.",
        "Marina: Yeah, we can go raid the vending machines or something.",
        "Mel: Okay, cool. All right. Thank you. I'll see you soon, okay. Bye.",
        "Marina: Hey, there, buddy. So how's it going?",
        "Robbie: Good.",
        "Marina: Good. Did you miss me?",
        "Robbie: I miss Daddy, too. Where is he?",

        "Michelle: Hey.",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Michelle: So listen.",
        "Tony: It's okay. Really, it's okay.",
        "Michelle: What is?",
        "Tony: This. You know, I knew it was going to happen when Danny came for you. It's okay.",
        "Michelle: Really? You knew?",
        "Tony: Yeah, I did. Look, I'm just.... I'm happy to see you safe again. See you free.",
        "Michelle: Free?",
        "Tony: Yeah. I want you to know... really, honestly I want you to know that I don't regret anything. And I don't think you should either.",
        "Michelle: I don't.",
        "Tony: That's good. That's good. I'm going to get out of here and leave you two alone.",
        "Michelle: Why?",
        "Tony: Michelle, look, you've made your choice. You know, I think that you should be with the guy you love.",
        "Michelle: I am. (Both laugh)",
        "Tony: I'm the guy you love. Me?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Me?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Me?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) Oh, God, I'm so excited. Come here. I love you. I do. I do. I love you. I do. What about Danny?",
        "Michelle: Danny and I are over.",
        "Tony: I thought that...",
        "Michelle: I know. I know. And I'm sorry about that. I just thought that he should know first, you know.",
        "Tony: He's got to be crushed, right?",
        "Michelle: I think he's going to be okay.",
        "Tony: Think so?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Should I say something? Maybe I should say something to him.",
        "Michelle: Maybe.",
        "Tony: All right. Where did he go? Huh?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. He was just right there.",
        "Tony: All right. I'm going to go look for him. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey, do you have any quarters? Robbie wants peanut butter crackers.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Lizzie: Here you are. It's really good to have you back, Marina.",
        "Marina: Um, thanks?",
        "Lizzie: What was wrong with her?",
        "Coop: You were actually nice just now. She was surprised.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Well, I am capable of it.",
        "Coop: Danny Santos was killed in a plane crash.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God, Robbie doesn't have a Dad. I didn't know. I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: No. No one knows. It just happened. Look, I need to get back inside, okay.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, sure.",
        "Coop: Hey, are you okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah. He just keeps asking me where Danny is. And I don't know what to tell him.",
        "Coop: Marina, this is a lot for you. I mean, where's Rick? Anyone else in his family?",
        "Marina: You know what, Coop? Why don't you get the juice and I'll just stay with him. I'm fine.",
        "Lizzie: He can't see you like this. And you're not fine, all right. Listen, if there's one thing I know how to do is take care of kids. Especially kids that don't have a father.",
        "Marina: Lizzie, he doesn't know about Danny.",
        "Lizzie: I know that. I wasn't going to tell him.",
        "Coop: I'll tell you what. Marina, they're going to be fine. Why don't we go for a walk? Are you sure about this?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I'm positive. Hi.",
        "Robbie: Hi.",
        "Lizzie: I'm Lizzie. Do you remember me?",
        "Robbie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lizzie: Good. This is my doggie Roxie. She likes little boys. You can play with her.",
        "Robbie: She's little, too.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, she is. She's my little baby. You know what? My Daddy actually used to be friends with your Uncle Rick. In fact, I used to watch you play in your swing set out back. That slide is so cool.",
        "Robbie: It's my favorite.",
        "Lizzie: Really? That's my favorite, too. I used to have one at my house in Arizona when my parents lived there. My Dad, he used to take me on these walks and then sometimes he would drive hopscotch on the driveway with some chalk. Do you like drawing with chalk, too?",
        "Robbie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lizzie: You do? It's fun. (Laughs)",

        "Harley: So what's on your mind, Beth?",
        "Rick: Actually we were just leaving.",
        "Beth: No, no, Rick. I'm not leaving. I can speak for myself.",
        "Harley: You're angry about Phillip and what you think I did to him.",
        "Beth: Well, that's very intuitive of you, Harley.",
        "Harley: I heard you.",
        "Beth: Or, then there's that.",
        "Harley: Well, I hope you can be fair and give me the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Beth: Seems like Gus will be able to do that even though you can't remember anything. But, hey, Gus, maybe you'll get lucky and be able to pin Phillip's murder on anything that moves.",
        "Gus: How long have you been eavesdropping?",
        "Beth: Long enough.",
        "Harley: Eavesdropping is a nasty, nasty habit.",
        "Beth: But very necessary every now and then.",
        "Harley: You think I killed Phillip.",
        "Beth: You do. Don't you? Phillip pushed you very hard and there's no telling how anyone will react in a situation like that.",
        "Gus: How did you react, Beth?",
        "Beth: Me?",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. Well, we're all kind of suspects, aren't we?",
        "Beth: No, not all of us. And not in the same way.",
        "Harley: What do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'm the reason that your children don't have a father?",
        "Beth: Yeah, well, that would be a start.",
        "Gus: All right, ladies, come on. Ladies, honestly.",
        "Beth: And, Gus, you know, who is going to be your target? Who's going to be your scapegoat?",
        "Rick: This is going nowhere. Let's just go over to the bar and get a drink.",
        "Beth: Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Gus: I'm just realizing that Phillip's still getting what he wants. Everybody's still at each other's throat.",
        "Beth: Well, maybe so. Maybe so.",
        "Harley: Beth, if I'm guilty, I will face the consequences. I can assure you of that. Will that make you happy?",
        "Beth: No.",
        "Gus: Please.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Harley: Well, that's just what I need, Beth the avenging angel.",
        "Gus: You know how she is about Phillip.",
        "Harley: Oh, I know how she is about Phillip better than anybody.",
        "Gus: All right, look just forget about them. Let's concentrate on the case, okay.",
        "Harley: Where are we going now?",
        "Gus: I just... I want to help clear your name, so I know exactly where we should start.",

        "Holly: I've had more than enough of that for one lifetime.",
        "Sebastian: I don't think you have. What happens when you get back to town, huh? How do you explain all this? How do you go back to babysitting and sitting at a desk?",
        "Holly: I'll be fine.",
        "Sebastian: Will you? You know, as much as I have upset you and outraged you, you wouldn't trade this experience in for anything. And now, Holly, listen to me. We can take the next step. It's a fresh start.",

        "Holly: Close the door, please.",
        "Sebastian: I can give you your life back, Holly, if you just give me a chance. Don't you see how good this could be? I'll tell the pilot to land, we'll take the coins and we'll find out what Roger left for us.",
        "Holly: I don't care what he left.",
        "Sebastian: We can do whatever we want... as long as we do it together. Take my hand, Holly. Follow me into our future. Together. I promise you will never stop feeling alive. Roger's ghost isn't hanging up over us anymore, Holly. We are free. So just take my hand. Come on. It's a new beginning. All you have to do is say yes.",

        "Harley: Oh, please. A brand spanking new mailbox. Somebody else has my land. Great. I bet Phillip made a tiny little sum of money off of that.",
