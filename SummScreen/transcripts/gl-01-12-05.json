        "Harley: You are one suspect shy. Remember her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Good morning. The coffee smells really good.",
        "Mel: Well, you better drink it before it gets cold.",
        "Rick: Speaking of cold, is there something wrong?",
        "Mel: I don't know. You tell me. (Knock on door)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hello, Mrs. Winslow. (Echoing): Mrs. Winslow...",
        "Paperboy: Mrs. Winslow? Are you okay? I brought you your newspaper.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Thank you. \"Falls down the stairs after leaving the wedding reception.\" He was there. Oh, my God, he was there. That's because he wanted to tell everybody, that's why. Uh-uh. I can still make Tammy and Reva know exactly who you are. Edmund, please sleep late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Well, well, well. Look who's here.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. I hear you're in pain.",
        "Jonathan: Some.",
        "Sandy: Not good enough. You see, you made such a point to come and visit me when I was in the hospital, I felt compelled to return the favor. It's funny how things turn around, isn't it, Johnny boy?",
        "Jonathan: (Groans)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You didn't have to come, you know.",
        "Josh: Jonathan is your son. If you need to be here, then so do I.",
        "Reva: Is that nobility or guilt?",
        "Josh: I did not put that boy in this hospital, Reva, no matter what you may think.",
        "Reva: I don't want to believe that you pushed him.",
        "Josh: Then don't.",
        "Reva: And as malicious as Jonathan's been, he didn't deserve this. He's a scared, troubled kid who's desperately in need of someone to... never mind.",
        "Josh: No, that's okay. Go on.",
        "Reva: I'm not apologizing for him.",
        "Josh: And I'm not apologizing for wanting him out of your life, Reva. He's dangerous.",
        "Reva: Well, a fall down a flight of steps would take care of that for a while, wouldn't it? I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: No, don't be sorry, Reva. Just say what's on your mind. Do you honestly believe in your heart that I would purposely throw him down a flight of stairs? That I would try to kill him?",
        "Reva: A month ago, that thought never would have crossed my mind.",
        "Josh: What about now? I guess the answer is yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: That picture doesn't belong up there. How many times do I have to tell you that?",
        "Harley: Well, I figure we can show these to some of the other witnesses who might have been near Company the night that Phillip was killed. If there are other witnesses. Hey, what about that guy who was walking his dog?",
        "Gus: Your brother already questioned that dude?",
        "Harley: But have we? No. So maybe dog man or somebody else saw Ruth Karloff pull that trigger, or that she definitely didn't, which would mean that she--I --would be cleared.",
        "Gus: Hm.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: It's just nice. I don't think once I've heard you suggest that you might beat this rap. It's just nice.",
        "Harley: Well, maybe your hopeless optimism is rubbing off on me.",
        "Gus: Good. It's about time.",
        "Harley: All right, cut to the chase. Any hunches? Anything?",
        "Gus: Yes, I do. I think I'm going to start with this one, right here.",
        "Harley: Beth? But she's my favorite stalker.",
        "Gus: Please. She's acting all squirrelly and weird. Did you see her at Towers? You didn't think that was weird behavior?",
        "Harley: Okay, but I might attribute that to grief. I mean she never stopped loving Phillip.",
        "Gus: Right, right. We'll see about that.",
        "Harley: Wait, where are you going?",
        "Gus: I'm going to work; I'm going to work. So wish me luck. And you do me one favor, all right? You stay out of trouble. Can you manage that?",
        "Harley: Good luck.",
        "Gus: Thank you.",
        "Harley: And Gus?",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Gus: You haven't gotten my bill yet. Don't thank me for it.",
        "Harley: No, I'm not talking about you just trying to prove me innocent. Actually, I'm talking about all that stuff with the house.",
        "Gus: Oh, well, you can't really live in a one-room apartment above a diner for the rest of your life.",
        "Harley: No, I guess not.",
        "Gus: Right.",
        "Harley: It's just, you know, what you said before about me seeming more optimistic. I guess I was kind of prepared to kiss my life goodbye, you know? But when I opened that mailbox and I saw that deed to my house, I just... I felt something I haven't felt in a long time. Not since I was arrested, not even since Phillip tore down the house to begin with. Not since our wedding, you know, went up in smoke. I felt hope. (Laughs)",
        "Gus: Yeah. Can you hang on to that feeling?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: I know what this is about. This is about the sailing trip. You're still mad about that, aren't you?",
        "Mel: I just... I don't want it to be like this anymore. I am so tired of what's been going on with us lately.",
        "Rick: I know. Ever since Phillip died.",
        "Mel: You know, I have tried to understand and I have tried to be supportive, but don't you think things have gone a little too far?",
        "Rick: I don't know.",
        "Mel: Well, I do. Okay? Grief is one thing, but it doesn't excuse... it doesn't excuse what's happened to our marriage.",
        "Rick: No, it doesn't, and I'm sorry. And in fact, I wanted... Mel, you know what, can we just... can we talk about something that's actually good? I mean, didn't we just find out last night that Danny's going to be okay and my little sister is actually coming home and Robbie's going to have both his parents back? I mean, even though they're not together. I mean, isn't that good news?",
        "Mel: Are we just supposed to accept the fact that Danny and Michelle aren't going to be together after everything they've been through?",
        "Rick: Well, after everything that Michelle has been through, maybe it's for the best.",
        "Mel: It's for the best? Two people who have loved each other for so long, who share a child together, are just going to be let go? I mean, how does that happen? How... how does it happen that two people are so close at one moment and then are so far apart, practically overnight.",
        "Rick: We're obviously not just talking about Danny and Michelle now, are we? (Knocking on door) I'll get it.",
        "Beth: Hey. I need to talk to you.",
        "Rick: Beth, this isn't a good time.",
        "Beth: No, but I really need to talk to you.",
        "Rick: Beth, this really isn't a good time.",
        "Beth: And I thought that Mel would be at work, so maybe we if could just have a cup of...",
        "Mel: No, Mel is not at work. But that's okay. It's the perfect time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I do not believe that you lured Jonathan into a stairwell and pushed him down some steps.",
        "Josh: Crime of convenience, was that it? An opportunity too good to pass up?",
        "Reva: Let's not...",
        "Josh: What I'm not hearing from you, Reva is that you think it might have been an accident.",
        "Reva: Okay. Was it an accident that your wallet showed up in his backpack a few months ago?",
        "Josh: Planting a wallet is not the same thing as throwing somebody down a flight of stairs.",
        "Reva: What about throwing someone across the living room? You meant to do that. I know because I was there. I stopped you from putting his head through the wall.",
        "Josh: After he attacked you, Reva, or have you forgotten that part of the story?",
        "Reva: You hate my son. Can you deny that?",
        "Josh: Reva, Jonathan is dead-set on hurting you and everyone in your life that you care about. He lies. He has lied from the moment he stepped foot into this town. In fact, if I hadn't seen the x-rays myself, I don't know that I would believe that he hurt himself last night.",
        "Reva: Maybe he should have landed on his head to make it more convincing.",
        "Josh: He's trouble, Reva. I see that. Everyone sees that except you.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, so much for giving him the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Josh: I have no doubt.",
        "Reva: When he moved into our house, you were willing to give him a chance.",
        "Josh: Yeah, the chance to hang himself with his own rope.",
        "Reva: You had your mind set against him from the start. You were never willing to give him a shot at redemption, were you? And you call him a liar.",
        "Josh: Reva, don't...",
        "Reva: No. Oh, no, don't. Don't tell me I don't understand because I'm hearing this all loud and clear. The whole time you were there patiently, helping me try to get through to him, when what you were really doing was finding a way to get rid of him. I should have known you were lying. I mean I saw the way you looked at him. You didn't have one trace of sympathy or remorse at all, did you?",
        "Josh: Remorse for what?",
        "Reva: And you wonder how I could believe you could go this far? I think you're upset he wasn't hurt worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: (Groaning) You put on a few pounds over the holidays?",
        "Sandy: Funny thing, pain. You can cause so much so easily without feeling a thing.",
        "Jonathan: (Groaning)",
        "Sandy: You see? That didn't bother me a bit. I guess that's how you felt when you hurt Tammy, Cassie, Reva. They kept thinking they could get through to you. Reva still does. But you and I, we both know there's nothing to reach. You have no heart, no soul, no feelings, except pain.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, unlike you. All heart.",
        "Sandy: And it's only a matter of time until Reva kicks you out of her house and her life. It won't last, this little hold you have on her. She's too good for you. They all are. Josh, Tammy, Cassie. The whole family, face it buddy. It's over for you. There's nothing you can do to hurt them anymore.",
        "Jonathan: That's what you think. (Groaning) Man, you're insatiable. You want to go again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Mom? What are you doing here?",
        "Cassie: I just came to see Jonathan. I read about what happened to him in the paper.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I was there.",
        "Cassie: What? You were there? What were you doing with him, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: No, no. I wasn't with him. I was... I was at the bottom of the stairs and I heard voices at the top, so I looked up and it was JB and Josh, arguing. Fighting, almost. And then JB fell all the way down. He was in so much pain.",
        "Cassie: Don't. Don't feel sorry for him. He doesn't deserve that. That boy will hurt you if you let him, so you better stay away from him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: (Groaning)",
        "Sandy: See, this family will stick together and keep going because we are stronger than you.",
        "Jonathan: \"We\"?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jonathan: (Groaning)",
        "Sandy: And I will make Tammy forget you ever even laid eyes on her, let alone touched her.",
        "Jonathan: (Groaning) Keep dreaming.",
        "Sandy: See? See? See? There you go. You talk a good game and you make a lot of noise, but you always end up losing. You're nothing at all like this family. Face it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I didn't stand in your way when you opened our home to Jonathan.",
        "Reva: No, because you're playing me, you were telling me everything I wanted to hear.",
        "Josh: I just figured it was a matter of time...",
        "Reva: Until what?",
        "Josh: Till you saw him for what he was.",
        "Reva: I confided in you all my hopes and fears about him. I went on and on about how much I wanted to reach out to him. And the whole time you were nodding and listening. You were really faking it.",
        "Josh: I was trying to get through to you, but you couldn't hear me, Reva.",
        "Reva: Why? Because I was my same willful stubborn self? Is that it?",
        "Josh: Yes. Yes. One of the things I've learned during our relationship together, Reva, is that I can't change what's in your heart. In fact, it's one of the things that I love about you.",
        "Reva: Love is trusting. Joshua, it's sympathy. It's understanding. You made me feel like a fool.",
        "Josh: Maybe you are a fool for believing that Jonathan has anything more than malice in him! Look at what he's doing to us, Reva.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Nice looking bunch.",
        "Harley: I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Jeffrey: I know. Gus around?",
        "Harley: No, he just left.",
        "Jeffrey: I should go then.",
        "Harley: Well, he could be back any minute. You're welcome to wait around if you want.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, actually I shouldn't be talking to you at all without your attorney present.",
        "Harley: Oh, so you're the prosecutor on my case?",
        "Jeffrey: Mm-hmm. From now on, any contact that we have with each other should be through your attorney, Gus Aitoro. I'm sorry it's come to this.",
        "Harley: Yeah. You know, if that darn wedding had just gone off as planned, Phillip would never have targeted Company, he never would have torn down my house, kidnap my kids or...",
        "Jeffrey: Been murdered?",
        "Harley: Ouch. Maybe you should go.",
        "Jeffrey: Harley, you know, this is my job. I don't relish this part of it. I want you to know that. And I don't have an ax to grind or anything like that. But I'm not going to be offering any favors. That's for sure.",
        "Harley: Well, don't worry; I'm not looking for preferential treatment. Just because I was a loyal dedicated colleague who risked my life for you I might add.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I kind of didn't hear the last part of that.",
        "Harley: Then I'll pretend this conversation never happened.",
        "Jeffrey: Whatever you say.",
        "Harley: I just need to ask you one question, Jeffrey. And I have to do it now, because I couldn't do it if Gus were here.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe you shouldn't ask it all then.",
        "Harley: I have to. See I have to know what happens in the outcome, you know, so I can get my life in order.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Harley: I'm counting on you to be honest with me. How bad does it look for me?",
        "Jeffrey: Harley, you really don't want me to answer that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mel: Come on in. You guys okay with me being here or do you need to be alone?",
        "Beth: No. No. It's fine.",
        "Mel: You sure? Rick? Do you want some coffee? I just made a fresh pot.",
        "Beth: Yeah, yeah. Sure.",
        "Mel: Great. Okay. Well, you know, you guys can say anything you want in front of me, because my husband and I, we don't have any secrets. Right, honey? Secret to a strong marriage.",
        "Rick: Beth, actually Mel... this isn't a good time. Mel and I were in the middle of something.",
        "Mel: No Beth is in the middle of something. Our marriage.",
        "Rick: What are you talking about?",
        "Mel: Last night at Towers, I saw you guys kissing. See, I told you we have no secrets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Look, I just want you to go now. Okay, you should just go now.",
        "Tammy: Look, I'm here to support.",
        "Cassie: Would you please just stay away from him, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Let me finish. I was going to say that I'm here to support Aunt Reva. He is her son, you know. And she's hurting.",
        "Cassie: We're all hurting. Just go please. Just go home and get some rest. And I'll look in on Jonathan, okay. I'll do that.",
        "Tammy: You? Why?",
        "Cassie: Josh. Is Reva inside?",
        "Josh: Yeah, she's is. She's with a patient.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Sandy?",
        "Sandy: Reva. Hi.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Sandy: Good to see you. I was just leaving, though. We had a nice talk didn't we buddy?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Take care.",
        "Reva: How are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. Well, my leg is feeling a lot worse than before Sandy came in, but go figure.",
        "Reva: You want me to get the doctor?",
        "Jonathan: No. No. Can you talk to me?",
        "Reva: Sure. What do you want to talk about?",
        "Jonathan: Your sister.",
        "Reva: Cassie?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Have you spoken to her since the wedding?",
        "Reva: No. But I didn't expect to. Why?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I know that you've been sticking up for me a lot since my little accident.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, it never should have happened.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, there's something you need to know.",
        "Reva: About Josh?",
        "Jonathan: No. Someone else. I'm sorry for everything that happened yesterday. I bet last night was kind of rough between you and Josh.",
        "Reva: Well, we'll be all right. Now what is it you were going to tell me?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I'm not exactly happy about everything that went down on the stairwell--namely me. (Laughs slightly) But Joshua isn't wrong about me being a problem for Cassie's wedding.",
        "Reva: What does that mean?",
        "Jonathan: Something happened, Reva, the night before the wedding. Something that you're really not going to be happy about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I really shouldn't be saying anymore about it as matter of fact. And neither should you. Unless...",
        "Harley: My attorney is present. Got it.",
        "Jeffrey: Bingo.",
        "Harley: Hey, how does it happen?",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Harley: You know, I put on a wig and fake nose and I became Ruth Karloff. Or she became me. I don't know which. All I know is that suddenly everything I thought about myself somehow shifted.",
        "Jeffrey: Come on, Harley. You know that when you go undercover, assume another identity, sometimes that identity takes a life of it's own. It should really.",
        "Harley: If you're doing it right, yes.",
        "Jeffrey: That's right.",
        "Harley: You know what it's like.",
        "Jeffrey: You could get in deep, too deep. You become the other person. Pretty soon you lose track of who you are and who this other person is.",
        "Harley: Oh. Sounds like it got dangerous for you.",
        "Jeffrey: It is dangerous, Harley. Because not only does it change your life, it takes it over completely. And you don't know what you--",
        "Gus: I hope you haven't been talking to my client.",
        "Jeffrey: I would never jeopardize like that. I came here to talk to the attorney actually.",
        "Gus: Why is that?",
        "Jeffrey: It's time we talk about a deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: So you saw that?",
        "Mel: Yeah. Good show.",
        "Rick: Why didn't you say something to me?",
        "Mel: Why didn't you say something to me?",
        "Beth: Mel. Mel, this is what I wanted to talk to Rick about. And now I can say it to you both. It was my fault. I kissed Rick and not the other way around.",
        "Mel: Yeah, well, he wasn't exactly shrinking from the contact.",
        "Rick: And she's right. She's right, Beth.",
        "Beth: It was my fault. I've been upset ever since Phillip. I haven't been myself and I guess I was looking for comfort, reassurance, whatever you want to call it.",
        "Mel: I just call it a kiss.",
        "Beth: You're right. You're right. I leaned on Rick in a way that I shouldn't have. It was inappropriate. And I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I know that this doesn't justify it, but I just kind of been at a lost ever since Phillip died, you know. And I know that he was a lot of things to a lot of people and some of them not so good. But to me, he was the father of my children and the love of my life.",
        "Mel: I know that Phillip's death has been a terrible loss. And maybe Rick is the only one that could understand you and be there for you.",
        "Beth: That kiss wasn't planned. It just happened. And as soon as it did, I felt terrible about it. And the more I thought about it, the more I knew that I had to clear the air. And that's why I wanted to talk to Rick, so that I could say that I'm sorry, because I don't want it to affect our friendship. And I don't want it to affect our friendship either.",
        "Rick: Beth, it was a mistake that we both made and we're equally responsible for it. And it just--it's never going to happen again. So we're fine.",
        "Beth: I'm so sorry. I should probably go.",
        "Rick: You were amazing with her.",
        "Mel: Why?",
        "Rick: You just seem to be very understanding.",
        "Mel: I do understand her. It's you I can't figure out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Excuse me. A doctor needs to see my sister. And she's in that room. I don't get along her son Jonathan and I don't want to upset him. Could you go in there and ask her to come out, please? It's really important. Thanks.",
        "Nurse: Excuse me. The doctor needs to speak with you outside.",
        "Reva: Oh.",
        "Jonathan: Can it wait? Can it wait?",
        "Nurse: I was told it's important.",
        "Reva: It's okay. I'll be right back. Cassie, what are you doing here?",
        "Cassie: I need to talk to you.",
        "Reva: Well, get in line. The doctor just paged me.",
        "Cassie: No, that was me.",
        "Cassie: What? I need you to listen to me. Please listen to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: There'll be no deals and there'll be no pleas, all right?",
        "Harley: Well, Gus, maybe we--",
        "Gus: You shouldn't even be here in the first place. What are you doing? You're dangling a deal in front of my client like it's bait or something?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, that's not ethics from Gus Aitoro. It's a bit of a contradiction in terms.",
        "Gus: Get out.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't you think.",
        "Gus: Get out.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm trying to be fair to Harley.",
        "Gus: Do you want to be fair? You could drop the charges.",
        "Harley: No, listen. He doesn't want to go to trial anymore than we do. That's why he's here. Shouldn't we just hear him out?",
        "Gus: No. No, because you're not guilty. She's not guilty. She didn't kill Phillip Spaulding.",
        "Jeffrey: I haven't heard her say that.",
        "Gus: You're not going to hear her say anything. Not when it comes to this. I'm talking for her.",
        "Jeffrey: You're going to speak for her? Well, then maybe you'll be prepared to speak to the evidence against her when this thing goes to trial, Gus.",
        "Gus: O'Neill, anybody on that board back there could have done this. They could have killed Phillip Spaulding. They had motive, opportunity, every single one of them.",
        "Jeffrey: Fair enough. Can I say one thing to your client?",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Harley: Shhh. Go ahead.",
        "Jeffrey: He works for you. Don't forget that, okay?",
        "Harley: I know that. Thank you. You were saying?",
        "Jeffrey: If she changes her mind, you know where to reach me.",
        "Gus: It's not going to happen. And you?",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: What? You shushed me. You don't shush... first of all, you've got to keep this professional like I'm your lawyer. You don't shush me in front of the dad.",
        "Harley: Well, it's just that your negotiating skills...",
        "Gus: I don't have worry about my negotiating skills--",
        "Harley: Leave a little bit to be inspired by.",
        "Gus: When my client is innocent. Do you understand? When you're innocent you don't have to deal, you don't have compromise. You don't have to bargain.",
        "Harley: You have yet to prove that I'm innocent.",
        "Gus: I'm not saying we don't have a fight in front of us. I haven't even grilled one of these people yet.",
        "Harley: Okay. Can I say something? Can the client say something?",
        "Gus: Yeah, sure",
        "Harley: Just quit it with the pep talks, okay. They're not as heroic sounding as you think they are.",
        "Gus: Oh, you like it. Don't you shush me again.",
        "Harley: Shh.",

        "Jonathan: Tammy? Tammy? Hey. I just wanted to say thank you for sticking around with me last night after Josh did his thing. Come here.",
        "Josh: Looking for company, huh?",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) Yeah. Yeah. Well, beggars can't be choosers, I guess. Have a seat. Sandy tells me that my busted leg is pretty comfortable. So hop on.",
        "Josh: It won't work.",
        "Jonathan: My leg? That is so cruel, Joshua.",
        "Josh: What? You think I'm not on to you? Huh?",
        "Jonathan: All I'm doing is healing from a very unfortunate situation. And I hope that I haven't caused you any problems, Joshua.",

        "Reva: Slow down, Cassie. You're not making any sense.",
        "Cassie: The night before the wedding, after the party at J. Farley's...",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: You know, Reva, the wedding just meant so much to me, you know, it meant everything to me. It had to go right. Because I just want to be happy with Edmund. I just want everyone to be happy. You know that.",
        "Reva: Okay, what does this have to do with Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: I think he drugged me. I think he slipped something in my drink.",
        "Reva: But why? Why would he do something? And why would you...",
        "Cassie: I woke up the next morning and he was in bed with me.",
        "Reva: Cassie, you don't know what you're saying.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you're right. I don't. Because I don't know how far it went, Reva. That's why I'm here.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: I have to know what Jonathan did to me that night.",
        "Reva: Did to you? In bed?",
        "Cassie: Yes. Look, I don't know what happened. I don't. But he was there. And I woke up and he was there and we both had our clothes off.",
        "Reva: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (Laughs nervously)",
        "Cassie: That's why I ran the morning of the wedding. I couldn't face Edmund. I woke up that morning in bed with Jonathan.",
        "Reva: I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Cassie: Look, let me tell you something. The most important thing... the most important thing for me right now is to find out if we... I just need to know, Reva. I am taking a lot of fertility drugs right now.",
        "Reva: Oh. Oh, my God.",
        "Cassie: And he won't tell me, okay. He won't tell me what happened. I need you to go in there. And I need you to find out from him exactly what happened. Please. I need you to do this me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Something happened. Something else happened the night that Phillip died that Beth knows about. And it's bad whatever it is, because she can't even bring herself to talk to me about it.",
        "Mel: Why are you telling me all this?",
        "Rick: Because I'm trying to explain to you the events leading up to what you saw last night. And it's important that you know it... she went on and on about how she couldn't trust anybody.",
        "Mel: She got a point there.",
        "Rick: When she finally got to place where she was about to tell me, she leaned and she kissed me and unfortunately, yes, I kissed her back. And I'm sorry for that.",
        "Mel: Sounds like what a good friend would do.",
        "Rick: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The last thing I would ever want to do would be to hurt you. And if this relationship... if this friendship with Beth is getting in the way of our marriage, which it obviously has, I'll just stay away from her.",
        "Mel: No, I don't want you to making any promise that you're not going to be able to keep. (Phone rings)",

        "Gus: What's the matter?",
        "Beth: I can already see you strolling in here with your bag full of donuts and lecturing me on how Harley is just innocence personified and everybody else is guilty. Well, no thanks. I am tired of talking about Phillip's murder.",
        "Gus: Wait. Wait.",
        "Beth: And if I ever hear about that night it'll be too soon!",
        "Harley: Sounds like it went well.",
        "Gus: She hung up on me. She's acting weird. She's going to talk about the night of the murder if it kills me.",
        "Harley: Oh, boy. I know that look.",
        "Gus: The more I think about the more... she might have something to hide.",
        "Harley: Okay, but take it easy. Because I think we know what happens when you start jumping to conclusions. And, besides, isn't Beth your new best friend?",

        "Hilda: Yes, yes. I sent it to the dry cleaners. There was a stain on it, red, like wine or blood or something.",
        "Beth: It was wine that I spilled. Listen, when that dress comes back, I want you to give it to the clothing bank.",
        "Hilda: I thought you still wanted to wear it?",
