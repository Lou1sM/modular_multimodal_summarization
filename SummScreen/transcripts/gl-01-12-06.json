        "Dinah: Mallet, I was thinking of you and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to... ( sighs ) shoot me. Oh, gosh, that sounded so gushy.",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't care how Harley did it. I'm in charge now and I need those figures-- ( clears throat )-- so that I can have everything just the way Mrs. Aitoro wants it when she gets back. Thank you. Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Hey, yourself. A temporary CEO's work is never done, huh?",
        "Alan-Michael: I prefer momentary CEO. I hope Harley and Mallet find Gus soon. Being the big cheese was never really my thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Thank you.",
        "Marina: Hey, Dad. I got your message. Did you hear from Harley?",
        "Frank: No, not since she called about finding the abandoned limo.",
        "Marina: Oh, then what's this about, the Weber case?",
        "Frank: No. Actually, it's about you. I have a confession to make-- not that I feel it's a confession because I don't think I did anything wrong here, but sweetie, I know you're a big girl now, and you're grown, but I still feel the need to protect you?",
        "Marina: Protect me from what?",
        "Frank: The other day you were sitting over at that table and you had come flowers there, and I said where did you get them, and you said a guy, and you didn't tell me the guy's name, and so I had two of my beat cops keep an eye on you, just to see, like, who you were hanging out with.",
        "Marina: You had me followed?",
        "Frank: They were going that direction anyway, honey, and they said you basically just kind of hung out with one particular guy. His name is Alan- Michael Spaulding. Please tell me he is not the guy.",
        "Marina: Because?",
        "Frank: Because he's too old for you.",
        "Marina: Didn't you say that about Danny.",
        "Frank: And look how wrong I was.",
        "Marina: Okay. You know what, Dad? I'm going to save you the trouble of listening to all my objections because I already know them. Okay? What, I'm too vulnerable after Danny, and Alan-Michael is a player, he has been married into our family more than once, and the whole history of Cooper dating a Spaulding has been more than historically disastrous, but to these things, I respond I'm not as vulnerable as you think I am, and I'm the one calling the shots this time. Yes, he is a player, but I already know that, and about the whole Cooper-Spaulding curse, it is a rumor, and so yes, to sum it all up Alan-Michael is the flower guy and I don't care if you like it or not, you're going to have to live with it. Ok",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: Hey.",
        "Cassie: You are not going to believe what came in the mail today. I said Jonathon would destroy Tammy's life, and sure enough...",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: It is a letter from Springfield University telling me they are refunding the money I sent for Tammy's tuition.",
        "Jeffrey: She dropped out.",
        "Cassie: Oh, no, no, no. They're kicking her out. They say she is not suited to be a member of the University community. And I'll give you one guess as to why?",
        "Jeffrey: Because of the charges brought against her.",
        "Cassie: Because of Jonathan, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I've never actually been grocery shopping before. Are you sure Reva's not here?",
        "Tammy: Are you scared? No. You're right. We promised her we wouldn't.",
        "Jonathan: Not yet, no. Wouldn't want to get you in any worse with your family.",
        "Tammy: You know, I'd like to forget the whole world against us thing for five minutes. So, can't we just be together? Can't we just do something normal? Put these away. Berries. Mmm. Yum. Normal, see?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh. Now this is normal. I could really get on this.",
        "Tammy: Hmm, you're sneaky.",
        "Jonathan: ( Mocking Tammy ) ( laughs )",
        "Tammy: Maybe I can bake a tart with these.",
        "Jonathan: Tart?",
        "Tammy: My mom's a great baker; I learned from her. And Aunt Reva gave me my grandma's recipe. Wow, our grandma Sarah. That's something we don't talk about much.",
        "Jonathan: No, but I bet you everybody else does. It's probably time we deal with it, too. We're not just a guy and a girl who hooked up, Tammy. We're cousins.",
        "Tammy: That's what I hate. The way you just said cousins, it sounds so...",
        "Jonathan: Wrong?",
        "Tammy: But we're not cousins like that. Our mothers are only half sisters. And they didn't meet each other until they were adults. And we didn't meet each other until last year.",
        "Jonathan: To us.",
        "Tammy: I thought you don't care what people think?",
        "Jonathan: I don't, but you do.",
        "Tammy: I'm caring less and less. And I think other people will start to care less, too, the more they see us together. They'll just get use to it, right?",
        "Jonathan: Okay. So let's help them get used to it, let's go out.",
        "Tammy: Really? Like now?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah, we'll get all dressed up.",
        "Tammy: Wow. You mean you'll put on a clean t-shirt?",
        "Jonathan: Well, if I have one. Okay, we're going to go out somewhere nice, too. I'm going to take you to where all of the decent folk go.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan Randall, are you asking me out on a date?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know, am I?",
        "Tammy: You don't know?",
        "Jonathan: No, because I actually never actually asked a girl out before.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, right.",
        "Jonathan: No, it's true. I mean, you know, I've hooked up with some girls, yeah, but a real date? Nobody has never meant that much to me. So how do I do it? How do I do it the right way?",
        "Tammy: It's simple. You just say: Tammy, would you like to go out with me?",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, would you like to go out with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: So what do I do now?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we can fight it, because she hasn't been convicted of a crime.",
        "Cassie: Not yet. But who the hell knows what's going to happen next. My daughter has been brought up on arson charges. She's kicked out of school, and she is suddenly claiming her undying love for her cousin, a guy who hurt her and nearly destroyed her. And to top it all off, my sister thinks they're the greatest couple since Josh and Reva.",
        "Jeffrey: I know everything seems crazy right now, but...",
        "Cassie: Am I crazy? Am I the only one who doesn't get it? I don't see a whole lot of worry for anyone about Tammy.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm worried about her. I'm very worried about her. It's just that... you know what? Forget it. What do I know about raising families? I don't.",
        "Cassie: No. What is it? Unless you think I'm really, really going to hate it.",
        "Jeffrey: I know that Tammy is your little girl. She's always going to be a little girl, but the fact of the matter is she is an adult, and she is capable of making her own decisions. I know we might not agree with all of those decisions all the time, but they're hers, and you can make your choices, too.",
        "Cassie: Meaning?",
        "Jeffrey: Meaning maybe it's time that you stopped waiting for her to call every second and just accept this is the way it is-- for now. Not forever, but for now. And focus on something else.",
        "Cassie: Okay. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'll find a way to let it go.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. We can start right now. You can go on a date with me, what do you say?",
        "Cassie: ( Laughing )",
        "Jeffrey: Okay a walk. We'll go on a walk.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughing ) A walk. We'll go on a walk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Frank: You basically asked and answered all of my questions, so I don't have anything else to say.",
        "Marina: Wow.",
        "Frank: For now.",
        "Marina: Got it.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, Frank.",
        "Frank: Hey.",
        "Marina: Did you see the look on Cassie's face, how much she misses her daughter?",
        "Frank: Where's Tammy?",
        "Marina: Oh, she is seeing Jonathan.",
        "Frank: Oh, God.",
        "Marina: And Cassie isn't thrilled, and she practically threw Tammy out of the house, and they're hardly speaking to each other. I don't want that for us, Dad. I don't want to lose us.",
        "Frank: Honey, I don't want to lose us either.",
        "Marina: We already have so much to think about. I mean, with Gus out there missing and Harley and Mallet out there looking for him...",
        "Frank: And you want me to drop this about Alan-Michael, all right? You don't want me to ask anymore questions. Okay, just one more question. ( Marina sighs ) Is it serious?",
        "Marina: I don't know. It's too soon to tell.",
        "Frank: Oh, come one, honey. There's 50 million guys out there-- great guys-- that don't have as much baggage as he has.",
        "Marina: Oh, excuse me! Aren't you interested in Olivia? Come on, she hasn't exactly traveled around lightly. Talk about a bad relationship history.",
        "Frank: Okay, now, you're bringing this up because you think I'm vulnerable after Darcy and I broke up, and you think that Olivia has grown issues and she is a player and she has been with two Spaulding's herself.",
        "Marina: And two Lewis'. I mean, come on, has she even broken up with Bill yet?",
        "Frank: I know what I'm doing.",
        "Marina: So do I.",
        "Frank: I'll tell you what we're going to do: Why don't we just leave this right where it is here, okay? But I still get to be worried about you.",
        "Marina: Right back at you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm glad we ran into each other, so we can commiserate.",
        "Dinah: About?",
        "Alan-Michael: How great it'll be when Harley gets back.",
        "Dinah: You seem to be doing just fine when she is gone. I mean more than fine almost boss like.",
        "Alan-Michael: I need to instill confidence in the people beneath me. If they knew how not into this job I really am...",
        "Dinah: I don't know. I think that you're kind of wanted it, you know, sitting in that chair, running Spaulding Enterprises all by your lonesome.",
        "Alan-Michael: Used to. That's my father's philosophy, not mine. My philosophy is why work harder than you have to. Which is why I'm glad you're here, Dinah. Helping me out, getting my back, we make a good team.",
        "Dinah: Harley and I are a team. You're just keeping her seat warm.",
        "Alan-Michael: My bad. A good temporary team. It's really great, your loyalty to Harley. It just proves how untrue stereotypes can be.",
        "Dinah: And what stereotypes are those?",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, you know the one about how women can never really get along, you know especially when there's a guy in the middle. And like now, Harley's out there all alone with Mallet, her ex, the guy your dating, and you're totally cool with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Button it, zip it, let's go! My husband is caught in a storm, and you're in here accessorizing. Okay, I took the area where we found the limousine and I broke it down to six sectors.",
        "Mallet: Where Chief Parker and his men will search in the morning. We're not going out in pursuit tonight; I told you that.",
        "Harley: Yeah we are. We can't wait till morning.",
        "Mallet: It's practically an ice skating rink out there, Harley. You drive three feet, you drive off the road. If we did happen to get to the crash site, we're liable to get lost, too.",
        "Harley: So you do think Gus is lost? You think he crawled out of that limousine. He is still alive somewhere.",
        "Mallet: Maybe, maybe, maybe.",
        "Harley: So that's all the more reason to get out there before he freezes to death.",
        "Mallet: I'm not going--",
        "Harley: Are you going with me or not?",
        "Mallet: No. I'm not going, and neither are you.",
        "Harley: Fine.",
        "Mallet: Ah-ah-ah! Don't make me cuff you, Cooper, okay.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "( Cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: Hold on. Hold on. Hello? Yeah, Mallet.",
        "Harley: Who is it?",
        "Mallet: No way, when? Really? Yeah, give it to me. Uh-huh. Yeah. No that's great. Thanks.",
        "Harley: Who is it?",
        "Mallet: Cool, we just got a hit on Gus's credit card, it was used for supplies at a local store.",
        "Harley: He is alive! What did he buy?",
        "Mallet: It doesn't matter.",
        "Harley: Tell me, tell me. A shovel, a rope, ammunition.",
        "Mallet: Don't go jumping to any conclusions, okay?",
        "Harley: Jump to conclusions? Why should I? It's right there. He's obviously building a snowman using bullets for teeth or he's murdering his father?",
        "Mallet: Maybe Gus didn't kill Alan, maybe Alan-- Harley, get back here! Harley! Oh, man. Harley! Harley!",
        "Harley: Did you tell Chief Parker we were on our way?",
        "Mallet: No, I didn't.",
        "Harley: Then why is he here?",
        "Mallet: Chief! What's going on?",
        "Parker: We traced the cell phone signal from detective Aitoro's phone, and narrowed it down to this area.",
        "Harley: But you haven't found him.",
        "Parker: My men are searching the woods.",
        "Harley: Okay, you're short of manpower; we will help. And don't say anything to me; I don't want to hear it. Because you know the card charge and this is the space of one hour. He's alive, he's alive, and he is out there. And he is fighting his way back to me. I will find him, I know it. I know it. You're going to help me, right? You're going to help me find Gus.",
        "Mallet: Yes, you know I am. Yeah.",
        "Officer: Chief, I think I found Aitoro.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Actually it's not amazing I am Harley's friend. It's amazing she is my friend. After everything I have done to her, it's amazing I have a job. It's amazing when I walk into a room, people respect me now. And I owe her more than I could ever repay her. So if she needs my help and my support, I will give it to her. Believe me, I'm going to help her all I can.",
        "Alan-Michael: Me, too, Dinah. You and I are more alike than you know.",
        "Dinah: How's that?",
        "Alan-Michael: People have the wrong impression of us. They think I'm useless and selfish. They think you're unstable and needy and jealous, when nothing could be further from the truth.",
        "Dinah: That's right.",
        "Alan-Michael: I just sent a fax before midnight Paris time, and I'll see you bright and early.",
        "Dinah: You bet.",
        "Blake: Dinah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Alan-Michael: Fancy running into you here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Oh, wow, these would be perfect...",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: This will be perfect for Tammy's birthday, but we may not even be speaking then.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you could be, you know, if you could handle swallowing how you feel about Jonathan for a day, including him in the celebration.",
        "Cassie: Is that what you think I should do?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm just saying, you know, it's an option.",
        "Cassie: Oh, thanks, no. Um, I don't think so. I think that would be saying that it's okay with me, and that she can have a normal life with Jonathan, which that letter today is proof she absolutely cannot. So, I'm just going to have to maybe not be with her on her birthday this year.",
        "Jeffrey: If you don't make peace with her or with him, you're not going to be with her on any of her birthdays. Is that what you really want?",
        "Cassie: If that's what it takes to keep her absolutely safe, you bet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: So where do you want to sit?",
        "Tammy: That table looks good.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, wait. Wait.",
        "Tammy: Wow, where did you learn that?",
        "Jonathan: I can evolve, expand my horizons. You know, it's not all going to be drama and police sirens from now on. That was a joke.",
        "Tammy: Look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gina Tognoni inside \"The Light.\" Dinah is a quick-witted, smart mouthed girl. I love being able to define Dinah to everybody and show different sides of her. And our episode is just beautiful. It is kind of impressive, I couldn't believe we did it. But we did it. See Dinah on Wednesday, January 18th, inside \"The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Let's dance.",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe we should leave.",
        "Cassie: No, I think you were right. I can't stop my life to fix Tammy's. It is a small town; we're bound to run into each other sometime. I can handle this. Do you need it do you...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: What are you up to all alone?",
        "Marina: Who says I'm alone, maybe I'm meeting someone. Or maybe I called your service and they told me you'd be here.",
        "Alan-Michael: You tracked me down?",
        "Marina: Do you mind.",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't know.",
        "Marina: Thought not. So I've come to a decision.",
        "Alan-Michael: About?",
        "Marina: I think it is time we get this -- thing we have between us out in the open.",
        "Alan-Michael: You almost said \"relationship.\"",
        "Marina: No, I didn't. I was going to say a relaxation situation.",
        "Alan-Michael: It doesn't even make sense.",
        "Marina: It rhymes.",
        "Alan-Michael: Never mind, it doesn't matter. As long as I get to do this.",
        "Marina: Okay, but before this goes any further, there's someone we have to go see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: I'm sorry, I had to take that. Dinah, Dinah, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: All right, all right. Thank you. You hate me.",
        "Blake: No -- well, I did. Yes, I did. But Dinah, listen to me. I just overheard what you said to Alan-Michael, about Harley, about your loyalty to Harley. I'm proud of you.",
        "Dinah: You are?",
        "Blake: Yes.",
        "Dinah: I don't believe you.",
        "Blake: But I am, I really am. I wish Ross were here, he would have been proud of you, too?",
        "Dinah: I miss my daddy very much.",
        "Blake: Gosh, so do I. Hey, you don't mind if I grab these. Follow me. It's been a really long day. And the kids, they're all at a sleepover tonight, and I just don't relish going into that suite all by myself. I know that this job, you know, this appointment in D.C. Was really good for Ross, but God, it's not good for our marriage. Not that we're having any problems or anything-- yet. I just... I miss him. I really miss him. And the kids miss him. You know, I know you miss him, too?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I do miss Daddy very much, but I know that he's doing something very good and positive with his life, so it makes me happy. It makes me very happy.",
        "Blake: Who are you? I mean, it's just a little scary when you're nice.",
        "Dinah: I'm not that nice. You know, when I found out that Dad took off, I wanted to pull a number to bring him back home, believe me.",
        "Blake: Yeah. I contemplated doing that myself.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, so we both have abandonment issues, right?",
        "Blake: But you didn't. You didn't lash out.",
        "Dinah: No, I didn't lash out. I have been busy otherwise.",
        "Blake: With work?",
        "Dinah: That and personal stuff.",
        "Blake: Such as?",
        "Dinah: Such as I'm seeing somebody.",
        "Blake: You're dating someone? You're dating someone Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Okay, you want to say it louder so they can hear it in Canada.",
        "Blake: Who you dating? Do I know him?",
        "Dinah: You know, I don't know if it's a thing or just one of those things.",
        "Blake: What?",
        "Dinah: Okay, it is Mallet.",
        "Blake: Hammer?",
        "Dinah: He prefers to be called A.C.",
        "Blake: Oh, my gosh, Dinah. That is such a bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: That's not Gus. Hey. Who are you?",
        "Officer: I found him in a shack over that way. He had Aitoro's cell phone and wallet on him.",
        "Harley: Where's Gus? What did you do to him?",
        "Drifter: Who's Gus?",
        "Mallet: The guy who's wallet and phone you stole.",
        "Drifter: I found the wallet and phone right over there by the side of the road in the snow.",
        "Mallet: Oh, is that right? Let's go take a look. I'll put your face right into it.",
        "Chief Parker: Denton...",
        "Drifter: Oh, brutality.",
        "Chief Parker: Denton, would you put the prisoner in your vehicle, and I'll question him back at the station.",
        "Mallet: Chief, Chief, Chief! Do you think you can see your way clear to let Springfield P.D. Question this guy? I mean Aitoro is one of our own.",
        "Chief Parker: By Springfield P.D., Do you mean her? Because she's ready to kill him right how?",
        "Mallet: She's understandably upset. Aitoro is her husband.",
        "Chief Parker: All the more reason...",
        "Mallet: I won't let her anywhere near him. I'll do all of the questioning.",
        "Chief Parker: In the presence of other officers?",
        "Mallet: Absolutely. At our house. I'm a by the book kind of guy.",
        "Chief Parker: Denton, I want you to accompany detective Mallet and Ms. Cooper back to Springfield.",
        "Mallet: Oh, Chief. Chief, you don't have to spare one of your guys for this.",
        "Chief Parker: Oh, yes I do. See, I'm ultimately responsible for this guy's safety. Take it or leave it.",
        "Mallet: I'll take it. Thanks. No problem, Chief, yeah. Actually, we'll put him in our car; you can follow us.",
        "Denton: I don't think that's what the chief had in mind.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I think it is.",
        "Denton: Right.",
        "Mallet: Are you satisfied?",
        "Harley: What are you doing? Going back to Springfield? I'm not going back to Springfield without Gus.",
        "Mallet: Would you shut up? Would you shut up for a second. I'm not going back to Springfield.",
        "Drifter: Oh, no you don't. You can't hold me. I've got rights, and I want a lawyer.",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry, what did you say? I'm sorry, I'm deaf in this ear. In this ear. What? What? Let's go, pal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Come on.",
        "Alan-Michael: I know this is a stupid question, Marina, but where are you taking me?",
        "Marina: What do you know, there is my dad. Let's say hi.",
        "Alan-Michael: Let's not.",
        "Marina: Let's do. Hey, Dad, hi. Alan-Michael, look who it is, it is my dad. Dad, look who it is, Alan-Michael. Let's not everybody talk at once.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good evening, Frank.",
        "Frank: Alan-Michael. I heard you're holding down the fort at Spaulding while Harley's out there looking for Gus. I would just like to say that my father and I, well, we appreciate it.",
        "Alan-Michael: No problem. Glad to help.",
        "Marina: That was really nice, Dad. Thank you.",
        "Frank: Okay.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hell, Frank, just admit it.",
        "Frank: Admit what?",
        "Alan-Michael: Deep down you want to stun-gun me and drop me in a lake.",
        "Marina: ( Laughing ) That's funny. ( Cell phone rings ) I've got to get this. It is the station. Don't go anywhere.",
        "Frank: Okay, Alan-Michael, you want me to be honest, I will. I think we both know I don't want you anywhere near my daughter. But I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to take a step back, and if you're smart, you're going to be good to her. Because if you're not, I'll kill you with my bare hands.",
        "Marina: Sorry about that. So how are things?",
        "Frank: Things are great, honey. We were just catching up.",
        "Marina: Good. See, I knew if you guys just talked, everything would be fine.",
        "Alan-Michael: Ah, yeah, everything is great.",
        "Frank: It is just swell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Do you feel like everyone in the room is watching us?",
        "Jonathan: Yes, they're watching us because you're the most beautiful girl they've ever seen. Now, people are going to watch us, but we said that that is a given.",
        "Tammy: We also said we wouldn't let it get to us.",
        "Jonathan: Even if it's your mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: What do you want to do about this?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. What do you want me to do, go over there and make nice with Jonathan?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I didn't say that, I just...",
        "Cassie: You want me to say, hey, Tammy, you may have blown your chance at a college education, but no big deal. Let's all just have a drink.",
        "Jeffrey: I was just thinking, we'll let them enjoy their evening, and we'll enjoy ours, but if you can't do that, I totally understand. We can leave.",
        "Cassie: I'll have the salmon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You going to be like this every time you see your mother, because if you, you're going to make yourself crazy, because we're going to see her. You want to go?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Jonathan: Well, then, can you ignore her. She' not going to change her mind about us.",
        "Tammy: I don't need her to. All I need is you. ( Dishes clash )",
        "Jonathan: Forget what I just said.",
        "Tammy: What? No, why?",
        "Jonathan: Just wait over here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Sorry if I kind of hurt your feelings.",
        "Dinah: It's just scarier to me when I see you being nice.",
        "Blake: It is just-- I can't believe I'm going to say this. I want you to be happy. I really do. Dinah, and you deserve-- you need a guy that is 100% devoted to you, and focused on you. And Mallet, you know, he is great. He's sexy, he's funny, he's, you know, perfect. But you're sure he is not still in love with Harley.",
        "Dinah: The last time I checked, Harley is married to Gus, and Mallet is single.",
        "Blake: Don't go on this road. You've been here before. Dinah wanting someone who wants someone else. You want me to remind you how it ends.",
        "Dinah: Are you enjoying yourself?",
        "Blake: Dinah, I had to get inside Mallet's head when I wrote that book, and I understand where he is coming from. I know he knows that he and Harley are not going to get together now. But part of him is still with her. And you deserve more than that. You do, you've worked too hard to get where you're at. And they're out there, those guys-- you deserve somebody who is available. Dinah, wait for that guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Denton, you know what? Grab yourself some dinner, we'll keep an eye on our friend here. Have a seat.",
        "Harley: Thanks for looking the other way on this.",
        "Mallet: You betcha. I'll do whatever we need to do, prison breaks, the works.",
        "Drifter: Who the hell are you people?",
        "Mallet: We're friends with Gus Aitoro, the guy who's wallet you stole.",
        "Drifter: I didn't steal...",
        "Harley: Shut up. We know you did. Quit playing games.",
        "Mallet: She's a much better friend than I am. Actually, I never liked the guy much. But you tell us what you need to know, and you can walk out of here. Because we're not after you, okay? We just want to find our friend Gus.",
        "Drifter: I never seen the guy. I found the wallet and the phone in the snow.",
        "Harley: You didn't find anything. When we got to the car, the only thing near that car was this photo.",
        "Mallet: Listen, pal, I've got some news for you, okay? Here is what the scoreboard said, you used our friend's cell phone and made some calls, you used our friends credit card and made some purchases. That's fraud right there. That's two counts of larceny. Those are serious charges. Now I can make them go away, and you can walk out of here a free guy, all you've got to do is tell us exactly what happened.",
        "Drifter: I talk and I walk?",
        "Mallet: That's right, it is as simple as that.",
        "Drifter: I saw the wallet and the phone in the snow, like you said, and near where the car had crashed-- the limo. I took the cards and cash and split, man, that's it. I didn't touch those guys.",
        "Harley: What guys. What guys?",
        "Drifter: The guys in the car, an older guy and the guy his age with dark hair, the one in the photo. They were out cold when I got there.",
        "Harley: And you neglected to help them. You saw two people unconscious in a wrecked car and you did nothing.",
        "Drifter: There was nothing I could do, lady, it was already too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Thank you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Was that some new police interrogation techniques.",
        "Marina: I watched my friend practically arrest her because she can't be honest about who she is going to date, and I don't want to go down that road, Alan- Michael. My family has a history, and they call it history because it is in the past, and everyone needs to move on.",
        "Alan-Michael: Has anyone told you you're extremely assertive?",
        "Marina: Now I know what I want, and I want to go after it.",
        "Alan-Michael: Do I have any say in the matter?",
        "Marina: Okay, go ahead. You can tell me how you feel.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'd rather show you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Dinah, for your sake, I hope I'm wrong. You know what, I want you to be happy. So I'll just, you know... I'll tell Ross you said hey.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, Mallet, hey. It's me. I wanted you to know I was thinking of you. And thinking about you out there with Harley and uh... you know, I've had a lot of fun with you. It has been a lot of fun, but I, um, am super busy right now. You know I've got so much on my plate, I can hardly keep my head straight. And I was thinking that, um-- we need to take a break. Before either one of us gets too invested. And, um, well, thanks. I'll talk to you soon, okay. You have a good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: It's too late? What does he mean too late? What do you mean? What do you mean?!",
        "Mallet: Easy. Harley.",
        "Harley: You saw two men injured in a car and you did nothing to help them, and you stole from them. What kind of animal are you?",
        "Drifter: It's deer season and I've got to eat! I had to get some gear, and neither one of those guys was getting up too soon.",
        "Harley: He is my husband.",
        "Drifter: Was your husband. I've seen a lot of road kill in my life, and I'm pretty sure you're a widow by now.",
        "Mallet: Easy, easy, easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Jonathan, we don't want any trouble here.",
        "Jonathan: No trouble here, Mr. O'Neill. I just want to ask Tammy's mother something.",
        "Cassie: What? You have something to say, Jonathan, say it.",
        "Jonathan: Would you like to dance?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Olivia: Are you happy? The truth is out, I'm interested in Josh.",
        "Jonathan: If she does decide she wants a family, don't worry. You've been one hell of a role model, all she has to do is look at the example you set as a mother and do the opposite."
