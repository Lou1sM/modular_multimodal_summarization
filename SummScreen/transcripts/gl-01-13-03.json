        "Ben: I think it's the fuel pump. ",
        "Marina: (Laughs) Dude, that's the oil cap. The fuel pump's over \r\n\t\tthere. ",
        "Ben: Yeah, well, whatever it is, it's not working, okay? How did you \r\n\t\tknow that, anyway? ",
        "Marina: Frank Cooper's school of driving. You must know everything \r\n\t\tthere is to know about the car before you can drive the car. All right, \r\n\t\tyou know what? We need parts. We're not going anywhere in this thing. \r\n\t\tHey. You didn't plan it like this, did you, Ben? ",
        "Ben: Marina, believe me, I'd much rather be alone with you in a nice, \r\n\t\twarm cabin with a big roaring fire than here. ",
        "Marina: Okay. Okay. I'm just asking. So, what are we to do now? ",
        "Ben: Well, we've got two options. We can walk the ten miles to the \r\n\t\tcabin. ",
        "Marina: Mm-hmm. And what's behind door number two? ",
        "Ben: Or we can stay here and try to keep warm while we wait for \r\n\t\tsomebody to come along. ",
        "Marina: I choose door number two. ",
        "Ben: Well, it could be a long wait. ",
        "Marina: Well, I\u2019m sure we can think of something to keep us warm.",

        "Buzz: If you're game. ",
        "Gus: That would be perfect. Yeah, yeah. That would be perfect. ",
        "Frank: Hey, Pop. What's up? ",
        "Buzz: Hey. ",
        "Frank: I got your call. All right, don't try to stop me, here. I'm \r\n\t\tstill going. Marina needs a chaperone and I\u2019m it. ",
        "Buzz: I know. I'm coming. ",
        "Frank: You're doing what? ",
        "Buzz: I'm coming. I bought out an entire ski shop. I'll show you. \r\n\t\tWe've got to get going before... ",

        "Harley: Hey. What is this? ",
        "Gus: Hi. ",
        "Harley: I thought you were supposed to be investigating your dad's \r\n\t\tfinances. ",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, you know, I got sideswiped. I mean, sidetracked. ",
        "Harley: Well, what could be more important than finding out whether \r\n\t\tyour dad was on the take? ",
        "Gus: Getting sloshed with Alexandra Spaulding. ",
        "Harley: What? ",
        "Gus: Yeah. I just went by to have a little drink, you know, unwind, \r\n\t\tand the next thing you know, we're throwing back pitchers of martinis, \r\n\t\tgreen ones, apple. Her idea, not mine. Don't even ask. And then we just \r\n\t\tstarted switching stories about dysfunctional families, and you know?\r\n\t\t",
        "Harley: You and Alexandra were swapping... ",
        "Gus: Shh! My head. ",
        "Harley: You were swapping stories about your families? ",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah. Funny, right? I was just doing my normal Phillip and \r\n\t\tbig Al bashing that I like to do, and before you know it, I\u2019m acting \r\n\t\tlike a poor slob laid out on a psychiatrist's couch. I'll tell you \r\n\t\tsomething, that lady, when she lets her hair down, she does not act like \r\n\t\ta Spaulding. ",
        "Harley: Oh, she's a Spaulding, hon. She will always be a Spaulding.\r\n\t\t",
        "Gus: Not when you get a couple drinks in her. ",
        "Harley: Ooh. Yeah, I think I heard that she can drink any man under \r\n\t\tthe table. ",
        "Gus: Oh, good. Then it's just not me. I thought it was... ",
        "Harley: So you and Alexandra, talking about your families. ",
        "Gus: Yeah. She's got a thing for me. I can't explain it, really, \r\n\t\tbecause you know, she's acting like she knows my dad and my family, but \r\n\t\tI don't know, maybe she just has good instincts. ",
        "Harley: Yeah, maybe. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: Alexandra? This is for you. I'll hook it over to the house \r\n\t\tphone. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh, thank you, Cassie. Alexandra Spaulding. Exactly how \r\n\t\tdid you find me? This is completely unacceptable, you know. You know, \r\n\t\tper our arrangement, you are to stay very quiet. Very, very quiet. When \r\n\t\tI need you, I will find you. Is that understood? Because I certainly \r\n\t\thope so. ",

        "Bill: Michelle will be home soon. ",
        "Danny: Good. ",
        "Bill: Look, Danny, I don't think now is the best time to surprise \r\n\t\ther, all right? She just wanted to get away from everything for a couple \r\n\t\tdays. ",
        "Danny: You know, Bill, I don't think Michelle really knows what she \r\n\t\twants. ",
        "Bill: But you do. ",

        "Gus: Echo. Echo. ",
        "Harley: Listen. Listen. I'm still not clear about what happened \r\n\t\tbetween you and Alexandra. ",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah. Well, she was just helping me figure out the whole \r\n\t\tdamn thing. ",
        "Harley: And... ",
        "Gus: And she just made a suggestion that maybe he was into the \r\n\t\tSantos's for something other than money. ",
        "Harley: Like what? ",
        "Gus: Well, I don't know, but it makes sense that it would be \r\n\t\tsomething other than money. ",
        "Harley: Well, I can see, honey, where it would make sense for you, \r\n\t\tbut how does she get that? ",
        "Gus: I don't know. I just think it's, you know, like a theory, like \r\n\t\tshe's floating a theory out there, because I mean, how would she ever \r\n\t\tknow my father? It's not like they ran in the same circles or anything.\r\n\t\t",
        "Harley: Don't you think it's a little weird that suddenly she's \r\n\t\tinterested in you, your dad, your life? ",
        "Gus: Yeah, well... I don't know what she said. It's far-fetched, I \r\n\t\tknow it's a long shot but I have to check it out. Meanwhile, I\u2019m just \r\n\t\twaiting to hear from my Chicago contacts on my dad's finances there. \r\n\t\tI've just got to keep digging, you know? ",
        "Harley: Honey, no matter what Alexandra says, there's still a chance \r\n\t\tthat your dad was on the take, or that Roy Baker was on the take and \r\n\t\tyour dad was looking the other way. ",
        "Gus: No, I refuse to believe that, okay, until I have exhausted every \r\n\t\tother option. ",
        "Eden: Hello. ",
        "Gus: Hello, sis. ",
        "Eden: So please tell me that you invited me to come up here to plan \r\n\t\tyour imaginary wedding, to go along with your engagement \r\n\t\tring-in-training. ",
        "Harley: You want to help plan our wedding? I am touched. ",
        "Eden: (laughs) Anything instead of another round of questioning. ",
        "Harley: Ew. Well, I hate to miss the big love fest, but there's \r\n\t\tsomething, actually, I have to take care of. No more martinis, okay? ",
        "Gus: No, are you kidding? ",
        "Harley: Without me. ",
        "Gus: Yeah. I'll call you. ",
        "Harley: Oh, honey. Whew. ",

        "Marina: Yeah. You know, I think it's really sweet that you want to \r\n\t\twait where there's a fire and snow and all that stuff, but I don't need \r\n\t\tany of that romance. I just need you. ",

        "Danny: Not that it's any of your business, but I did what I did to \r\n\t\tprotect my family, not lose them. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, but in the long run, Danny, you couldn't protect them.\r\n\t\t",

        "Bill: First of all, I did not end it with Beth for Michelle. Okay? I \r\n\t\twas going to end that anyway; it wasn't right. ",
        "Danny: But it's right with my wife? ",
        "Bill: Danny, you know what? Maybe you should take a step back, all \r\n\t\tright, because I think the last thing that Michelle needs right now is \r\n\t\tfor you to be pressuring her. ",
        "Danny: Oh, I agree. But what is it that you call what you're doing? \r\n\t\tThe cottage, with some candlelight and some wine. That's not pressure?\r\n\t\t",
        "Bill: Trust me. Trust me, Danny. I want what's best for Michelle. ",

        "Danny: Oh, really. ",
        "Bill: Danny, do you really believe with Carmen out of the picture \r\n\t\tthat things could just go back to normal? Is that what you really \r\n\t\tbelieve? Things will be safe for Michelle and Robbie? Is that what you \r\n\t\treally believe? Maybe if you cared enough, you'd just come to realize \r\n\t\tthat it's time to let her go. ",
        "Danny: Let me tell you something: What Michelle and I have is not \r\n\t\tgoing away. So if I were you, I would stop wasting my time and my energy \r\n\t\thoping otherwise. ",

        "Alexandra: Pardon? ",
        "Harley: Well, you've been such a help with Zach and Gus, and me. It \r\n\t\tcan't have helped your own family relations at all. ",

        "Rick: I know. Most parents are thrilled with the milestones, but I'm \r\n\t\tnot. Just yesterday morning, my little boy said, \"Dada.\" You'd think I \r\n\t\twould be thrilled with that, but all I could think was, in five minutes \r\n\t\the's going to say, \"Hey, dad, I\u2019m off to college.\" Which is where you \r\n\t\tare right now.

I made Tammy afraid to have her own life \r\n\t\tand afraid... Just afraid to be happy. I am always going to love \r\n\t\tRichard, but I cannot be a prisoner to that love.
