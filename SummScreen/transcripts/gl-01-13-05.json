        "Danny: What's that?",
        "Marina: Packing up Bobby?",
        "Danny: Yeah, we're moving back into the Beacon. That is as soon I can get all his toys rounded up. What's in the bag?",
        "Marina: Oh, it used to be known as our Buzz burger and the special of the day: Roxy dogs. Luckily they still taste good. And I know Robbie likes them.",
        "Danny: Yeah, he loves them. Thanks. Listen, Michelle's on her way over here any minute and she hasn't seen Robbie yet since she got back. We need to sort of sit him down and explain things to him and tell him that his parents aren't going to be living together.",
        "Marina: Wow. Well, look, I'm going to make myself...",
        "Danny: Well......Scarce. If you want to talk later.",
        "Danny: Okay, yeah, I'll call you. I mean, I'm really glad that you came over. It's just that this is something that Michelle and I need to do alone.",
        "Marina: Of course, I understand.",
        "Michelle: I don't.",

        "Blake: Mom.",
        "Holly: Oh.",
        "Blake: Honey, I'm so glad you're safe. I was so worried about you.",
        "Holly: Oh, I wanted to see you.",
        "Blake: How are you? What happened?",
        "Holly: How are Ross and the kids?",
        "Blake: They're all fine. And they can't wait to see you. You just tell me what happened.",
        "Holly: It's a long story.",
        "Blake: Where's Sebastian? I mean, is he here? Did you find whatever it is Dad left behind?",
        "Holly: Not exactly.",
        "Blake: Mom, is he coming back with you?",
        "Holly: Sebastian is not coming back.",
        "Blake: Why not?",
        "Holly: Your brother... your brother is dead.",

        "Edmund: Marry me? Marry me? Marry me?",
        "Cassie: I already did.",
        "Edmund: Oh, that's right. That's why there's a ring on my finger, why I'm so happy.",
        "Cassie: Me too.",
        "Edmund: Where did you go this morning? I had big plans. Of course it didn't involve leaving the bed, but it was a big one nonetheless.",
        "Cassie: Wow. I'm sorry I missed it.",
        "Edmund: Come on.",
        "Cassie: I had to go to the hospital to be with Reva, you know.",
        "Edmund: Yes, well, personally I wish he had fallen him from a higher floor, but you're a better person than I am.",
        "Cassie: Oh, God, Edmund. Don't do that. Don't put me up on a pedestal, please?",
        "Edmund: The only thing I'm going to put you up on is our bed. But after we watch this.",
        "Cassie: Where did you get that?",
        "Edmund: Outside. I found it outside. I thought we could go upstairs and...",
        "Cassie: No. We can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Did you or did you not go to my sister's room the night before her wedding?",
        "Jonathan: I'm not on trial here, Mom.",
        "Reva: She was so upset the day of her wedding but she wouldn't tell me why. And now she says you drugged her.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, the princess spins a nice fairy tale. You let me know when you're ready for a shot of reality.",
        "Reva: I'm ready.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. I was going to tell you before. I told you, you wouldn't like it, and that's exactly why Cassie wanted to talk to you first, by the way--so she could put her own spin on things.",
        "Reva: Why don't you tell me what you did?",
        "Jonathan: What I did? Yeah, I figured she was going to put it like that. Did she call it rape?",
        "Reva: Should she?",
        "Jonathan: I'll tell you what I'm calling it: Another person who claims to love you, who's trying to toss your son out of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Michelle, now that you're back, Robbie's going to ask why we're not living together. We need to explain that to him.",
        "Michelle: Oh, you haven't said anything yet?",
        "Danny: No. That's something that we need to do together, just the two of us. Now, are you up for this, or...",
        "Michelle: No, (Laughs nervously) but I don't think I ever will be, so I guess we better just do it, right?",
        "Tony: Why don't we give them some space? You need a ride?",
        "Marina: No, I'm good.",
        "Tony: All right, we'll I'll walk you to your car. I'll see you in a bit, okay?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: Sebastian is dead?",
        "Holly: He had this disease that your father had.",
        "Blake: That's what he died of? The disease?",
        "Holly: He's gone and now we just have to pick up and move on.",
        "Blake: That's it? That's all you're going to tell me?",
        "Holly: What do you want me to tell you? Do you want me to tell you how he lured me to an island and forced me to relive every horrible moment I ever had with Roger and then locked me into a cage?",
        "Blake: Oh, my God. Mom, I had no idea. I'm so sorry.",
        "Holly: No, no, no, no, no, no. It's this disease. It was... it ate away at him and every day he just became more irrational, you know? And I was terrified and I tried to handle him, but I... I couldn't. He was like...",
        "Blake: He was like Dad?",
        "Holly: No, no, no.",
        "Blake: What did he want, Mom?",
        "Holly: He... he wanted me to save him. Honey, can we talk about something else?",
        "Blake: I'm sorry. I feel like such an idiot. I mean, I had no idea, and I should never have let you go alone with Sebastian. That was...",
        "Holly: It wasn't your fault.",
        "Blake: Well, all those e-mails were coming from him and I thought that they were coming from you. I just was stupid not to realize that he was...",
        "Holly: No, no, no, no. You weren't stupid. You were vulnerable. We both were, because we were knocked off-center when we heard about Roger's death. And he knew that and he took advantage of it. But the thing is that I survived and so have you, and that's all that matters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I don't want you to see this.",
        "Edmund: Why not?",
        "Cassie: Because I want to see it first.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, why in the world would you need to prescreen our wedding reception video?",
        "Cassie: Reception? This is our wedding reception?",
        "Edmund: Yes. Blake and Ross sent it over. I didn't even know they were making one, but Blake can be very discreet.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. She's funny.",
        "Edmund: What did you think it was?",
        "Cassie: Uh, well, you know, Reva and Mel, they shot some footage of the bachelorette party and, well, you know, I got kind of crazy and it wasn't pretty, and I just don't want you to see anything that's going to make you regret marrying me.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, that's not possible.",
        "Cassie: I just don't want to look in your eyes and see anything but the love that's there right now.",
        "Edmund: You won't, Cassie, I promise. Hey, you know that, don't you?",
        "Cassie: I do. I do. I don't doubt that. I don't doubt that at all.",
        "Edmund: Good. Good, good, good, because I have another surprise for you.",
        "Cassie: Well, be careful. I don't know if I can handle it.",
        "Edmund: Tickets to paradise. Otherwise known as our honeymoon.",
        "Cassie: But I...",
        "Edmund: No, no, no, no. It's all arranged. Olivia is going to take care of the Beacon, Mrs. Chitwood is going to look after the boys, and we are going to Tahiti.",
        "Cassie: Tahiti?",
        "Edmund: I take it you approve?",
        "Cassie: Oh, God, Edmund, there's nothing I need more than to go away with you right now.",
        "Edmund: Good. We'll work hard and bring home a souvenir, unless of course you're pregnant already.",
        "Cassie: I couldn't be. I mean, I... I have to go. I'm sorry, I have to go, and I'll be right back, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I should have known you'd only listen to Cassie's side of the story.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm listening to you now. Did you go to her room?",
        "Jonathan: Yes.",
        "Reva: Did you wake up with her in bed?",
        "Jonathan: Yes.",
        "Reva: Then why the hell wouldn't I believe what she's telling me?",
        "Jonathan: Well, how the hell do you think I got there in the first place?",
        "Reva: Well, I know she didn't tuck you in.",
        "Jonathan: You don't know anything right now.",
        "Reva: Why would Cassie lie about something like this?",
        "Jonathan: To get back at me, to get rid of me. She's still mad at me for what I did to Tammy. Look ... look think about it. If I showed up at Cassie's door unexpectedly, what do you think she'd do? She would call security, they would call the cops and I'd be rotting in a jail cell downtown right now.",
        "Reva: So you're saying that she invited you into her room. I can't believe that.",
        "Jonathan: Well, seeing is believing. Hand me that jacket.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Jonathan: My jacket. Here.",
        "Reva: What is this?",
        "Jonathan: It's a note from Cassie. Read it.",
        "Reva: \"You and me tonight. Meet me at my suite at the Beacon at...\"",
        "Jonathan: Midnight. Nice penmanship, don't you think?",
        "Reva: She'd never invite you to her room. Not ever.",
        "Jonathan: So, what? I forged the note?",
        "Reva: Did you?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, man. I'm always the bad guy. Your sister was drunk. She was dancing on the table. You saw her. The whole time, she's giving me this look, like, \"oh, come and get me.\" And then I get this note and I'm thinking, \"is she for real?\" And I'm sorry, but I'm a guy; I had to find out.",
        "Reva: So you went to her room?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. And when I get there, it's like she was ready for me. She's wearing this, like, sexy little outfit that she should have been saving for her honeymoon, and she pours me a glass of wine...",
        "Reva: No. That's not possible. I mean, it's just not possible. Why would she come on to you?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I was flattered at first until I realized that it was because it was a set-up. Somebody was supposed to walk through that door and find me on top of her.",
        "Reva: Me. I was supposed to meet her at 12:15. But there was a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, man. I knew it. I knew it. And I knew something was up because she kept looking at the clock.",
        "Reva: Why didn't you leave?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I was drinking champagne, feeling no pain myself. Honestly, I was in pretty bad shape, so I put her to bed. I didn't touch her. I tucked her in and I went to bed myself.",
        "Reva: She said that you weren't wearing any clothes.",
        "Jonathan: All right, all right, all right. I messed with her a little bit. She deserved it. She wakes up in the morning, she goes ballistic. She's, like, \"did you touch me?\" She wants to know if I molested her. I didn't do anything. I didn't touch her. And I could have ruined the wedding for her, too, but I didn't do that. Edmund showed up the next morning at her room and I didn't let him know I was there. I snuck out the back. Now, if I wanted to cause trouble, that was the perfect opportunity, wasn't it?",
        "Reva: Yeah. But...",
        "Jonathan: Mom, I didn't touch Cassie, regardless of what she says. I drank with her a little bit. You've got to make a choice Mom, Cassie or me. So go ahead. Make your pick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Hey. It's okay. It's okay. You want to give Mommy a hug?",
        "Robbie: Uh-uh.",
        "Michelle: I know. I know what it is. It's been so long that you forgot my face, didn't you? You don't even recognize me. Do you recognize this face? Or this one?",
        "Danny: Oh, I think he remembers that one.",
        "Michelle: Yeah? Hey, you know what? I brought you a present. Look at this. It's just like the plane that I flew home on, and it lights up and everything.",
        "Robbie: Cool.",
        "Michelle: It is cool, isn't it?",
        "Danny: It's neat, huh? Look at that.",
        "Michelle: Your Daddy and I have something that we have to talk to you about.",
        "Danny: You know what? Come here buddy. Come here with your plane for a second. I don't know what I was thinking. This is not a good time. It's too much all at once.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, I think you're right. Hey, I know what we could do. We could go on an adventure. We could go see some dinosaurs!",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Michelle: What do you think? We'll go to the museum and then we can go to the park, and we can go ice-skating and get one of those big, giant hot dogs that you love.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry. I forgot my keys.",
        "Danny: Oh.",
        "Robbie: Marina!",
        "Marina: Hi!",
        "Robbie: Look.",
        "Marina: Wow! This is super-cool.",
        "Michelle: Well, Robbie, we should maybe play with that later so we can get ready to go.",
        "Robbie: I want to stay with Marina.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Everything okay?",
        "Reva: Nothing's been okay since Jonathan got here. Everyone I love is being torn apart and I don't know what to believe anymore.",
        "Josh: Listen, I've been thinking about it. Maybe this would be a good time for all of us to have a little distance, you know? Jonathan, he's going to be released soon. I'm thinking maybe he should go someplace else to recover. And I'll be more than happy to pay for full-time nursing care for him until he's back on his feet.",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Josh: Reva, it would be the best thing for all of us. I promise you, I'll make sure he's comfortable and that he will have everything he needs.",
        "Reva: I'm not stupid, Joshua. I know that he's a one-man wrecking crew, but so much has happened to him in his life and everyone keeps...",
        "Josh: Keeps what?",
        "Reva: Keeps trying to drive him out of my life! He needs me. He needs his mother.",
        "Josh: You can visit him.",
        "Reva: It isn't enough.",
        "Josh: Will it ever be enough? Reva, I understand the guilt that you're feeling, I really do, but you have to figure out a way to get past it. You didn't mean for him to have such a tough time growing up.",
        "Reva: Did you mean to have that accident that hurt Shayne?",
        "Josh: Of course not.",
        "Reva: And will you, in your heart of hearts, always feel responsible for what happened? So don't tell me not to feel responsible for his pain. He's hurt. And he needs me. I'm going to bring him home, Joshua, because I need him, too right now. So, don't tell me that I can't have him with me. I will not give him up again. Don't ask me to do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, beautiful. Did you come to give me my sponge bath?",
        "Cassie: I want to know what happened the night you drugged me.",
        "Jonathan: Drugged you? Man, you've got some imagination.",
        "Cassie: How far did it go? What happened that night?",
        "Jonathan: You're really sticking to that story, aren't you?",
        "Cassie: You're so sick. But you're going to tell me what happened. Tell me the truth. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: Mimosa?",
        "Holly: What is this?",
        "Blake: Oh, no, no. Mimosa is mine. She gets the orange juice.",
        "Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry. Holly:(Whispers) I'm sorry.",
        "Ross: I'll have a black coffee. Holly, welcome home. Welcome home. You were missed.",
        "Holly: Oh, how wonderful to hear you say that.",
        "Blake: Mom was just telling me about my inheritance. The coins?",
        "Ross: Oh.",
        "Holly: Oh... there is no... there's no treasure.",
        "Ross: Too bad. Blake already has it spent.",
        "Blake: I do not. And just for the record, it wasn't about the money. It was about something my father left me.",
        "Ross: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know that it was important to you. So, is your traveling companion with you? I mean Sebastian did come back to Springfield with you, didn't he?",
        "Blake: Sebastian died of the same disease my father did.",
        "Ross: I'm sorry.",
        "Blake: Are you?",
        "Ross: Of course I am. I know how much you wanted to get to know your brother.",
        "Sebastian: You betrayed me. (Echoing) I want to be with you. (Echoing) Don't!",
        "Holly: (Screams) Sebastian! Sebastian: Don't!",
        "Ross: Sebastian was a user. He took advantage of your grief and he knew exactly what buttons to push to make you and Holly do whatever it is he wanted you to do.",
        "Holly: Mm-hmm. Listen to the wise man. Ross is right. Sebastian is gone and we just have to put them all to rest.",
        "Ross: Holly, Holly. That's Blake's mimosa.",
        "Holly: Oh. Oh. (Laughs) It was my mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: We can revisit this tomorrow. Okay.",
        "Michelle: Sure.",
        "Danny: Come on.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: It's okay.",
        "Danny: Don't be. Okay, bud. I'll come find you in a little bit.",
        "Marina: Hey. Wait, wait, wait. You want to say goodbye to Mommy? Okay.",
        "Danny: See you, buddy.",
        "Michelle: My God.",
        "Danny: Well, Michelle, I'm sorry, but really, what did you expect? I mean all Robbie understands is that you've been gone for a long time. It's going to take a while for him to trust you again.",
        "Michelle: I guess so.",
        "Danny: But he will. It'll just take time. He'll come around.",
        "Michelle: You know I imagined a lot of things while I was away. This was not one of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I would never ask you to choose between your husband and your son. So bring him home, and I will try to arrange my schedule so I don't see much of him.",
        "Reva: That's a lousy solution.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry, but it's the best I can come up with right now. I just really need you to understand that I'm trying, but your son has made me think some things and do some things that I didn't even know I had in me anymore. And I'm afraid to even imagine what else I might do if I'm still around him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I want the tape.",
        "Jonathan: Huh?",
        "Cassie: The tape that you stole out of the camera in my room. Where is it?",
        "Jonathan: Boy, you're just full of accusations today.",
        "Cassie: Give me the tape.",
        "Jonathan: Look, Aunt C., in case you haven't noticed, I'm in the hospital. I fell. I could've died. You didn't bring me flowers or candy. You only brought me grief.",
        "Cassie: Brought you grief? You're destroying my family.",
        "Jonathan: (Yawns) Here we go again.",
        "Cassie: I am your mother's sister. How could you get into bed with me?",
        "Jonathan: I'm your sister's baby boy. How could you set me up?",
        "Cassie: Because I was stupid, and I was so desperate to get rid of you. I couldn't stand by and watch you lurk around the edges of my daughter's life, and I couldn't stand watching Reva bend herself up like a pretzel trying to make you happy. I just wanted her to see what everyone else sees: That you are a heartless, soulless, monster.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. People tell me that.",
        "Cassie: Give me the tape.",
        "Jonathan: Um, I didn't... I didn't shoot any videotape. Did you?",
        "Cassie: Stop lying to me and give me the tape.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I'm very flattered that you want to relive the memories, but I only gave you what you asked for.",
        "Cassie: You're not even human. I wish to God you had died when you fell down those stairs.",
        "Reva: Stop it, Cassie. Stop it right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: I didn't mean to take your drink. I reached for the wrong glass.",
        "Blake: That's okay.",
        "Ross: Yeah. After what you've been through, it's amazing that you're functioning at all.",
        "Holly: Yeah. I mean, I was so desperate to get home and I'm starting to feel like a convict who's been released from prison and sleeps on the floor because she can't get used to the bed.",
        "Ross: That's understandable. It's going to take some time until you readjust.",
        "Holly: I'm fine. Really. I have to get back to work. Get back to my work and spend time with my family. And it'll be like nothing happened, because nothing Sebastian did to me will affect me if I don't let it.",
        "Blake: I think you need some closure.",
        "Holly: I've had closure.",
        "Blake: No, real closure, Mom. I think we should go back to the island and uncover Sebastian's body so we can have a memorial service.",
        "Holly: I am not going back to that island and neither are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Reva: Nothing's been okay since Jonathan got here. Everyone I love is being torn apart and I don't know what to believe anymore.",
        "Josh: Listen, I've been thinking about it. Maybe this would be a good time for all of us to have a little distance, you know? Jonathan, he's going to be released soon. I'm thinking maybe he should go someplace else to recover. And I'll be more than happy to pay for full-time nursing care for him until he's back on his feet.",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Josh: Reva, it would be the best thing for all of us. I promise you, I'll make sure he's comfortable and that he will have everything he needs.",
        "Reva: I'm not stupid, Joshua. I know that he's a one-man wrecking crew, but so much has happened to him in his life and everyone keeps...",
        "Josh: Keeps what?",
        "Reva: Keeps trying to drive him out of my life! He needs me. He needs his mother.",
        "Josh: You can visit him.",
        "Reva: It isn't enough.",
        "Josh: Will it ever be enough? Reva, I understand the guilt that you're feeling, I really do, but you have to figure out a way to get past it. You didn't mean for him to have such a tough time growing up.",
        "Reva: Did you mean to have that accident that hurt Shayne?",
        "Josh: Of course not.",
        "Reva: And will you, in your heart of hearts, always feel responsible for what happened? So don't tell me not to feel responsible for his pain. He's hurt. And he needs me. I'm going to bring him home, Joshua, because I need him, too right now. So, don't tell me that I can't have him with me. I will not give him up again. Don't ask me to do that.",

        "Cassie: I want to know what happened the night you drugged me.",
        "Jonathan: Drugged you? Man, you've got some imagination.",
        "Cassie: How far did it go? What happened that night?",
        "Jonathan: You're really sticking to that story, aren't you?",
        "Cassie: You're so sick. But you're going to tell me what happened. Tell me the truth. Now.",

        "Holly: Oh... there is no... there's no treasure.",
        "Ross: Too bad. Blake already has it spent.",
        "Blake: I do not. And just for the record, it wasn't about the money. It was about something my father left me.",
        "Ross: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know that it was important to you. So, is your traveling companion with you? I mean Sebastian did come back to Springfield with you, didn't he?",
        "Blake: Sebastian died of the same disease my father did.",
        "Ross: I'm sorry.",
        "Blake: Are you?",
        "Ross: Of course I am. I know how much you wanted to get to know your brother.",

        "Holly: (Screams) Sebastian! Sebastian: Don't!",
        "Ross: Sebastian was a user. He took advantage of your grief and he knew exactly what buttons to push to make you and Holly do whatever it is he wanted you to do.",
        "Holly: Mm-hmm. Listen to the wise man. Ross is right. Sebastian is gone and we just have to put them all to rest.",
        "Ross: Holly, Holly. That's Blake's mimosa.",

        "Danny: See you, buddy.",
        "Michelle: My God.",
        "Danny: Well, Michelle, I'm sorry, but really, what did you expect? I mean all Robbie understands is that you've been gone for a long time. It's going to take a while for him to trust you again.",
        "Michelle: I guess so.",
        "Danny: But he will. It'll just take time. He'll come around.",
        "Michelle: You know I imagined a lot of things while I was away. This was not one of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I would never ask you to choose between your husband and your son. So bring him home, and I will try to arrange my schedule so I don't see much of him.",
        "Reva: That's a lousy solution.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry, but it's the best I can come up with right now. I just really need you to understand that I'm trying, but your son has made me think some things and do some things that I didn't even know I had in me anymore. And I'm afraid to even imagine what else I might do if I'm still around him.",

        "Cassie: I want the tape.",
        "Jonathan: Huh?",
        "Cassie: The tape that you stole out of the camera in my room. Where is it?",
        "Jonathan: Boy, you're just full of accusations today.",
        "Cassie: Give me the tape.",
        "Jonathan: Look, Aunt C., in case you haven't noticed, I'm in the hospital. I fell. I could've died. You didn't bring me flowers or candy. You only brought me grief.",
        "Cassie: Brought you grief? You're destroying my family.",
        "Jonathan: (Yawns) Here we go again.",
        "Cassie: I am your mother's sister. How could you get into bed with me?",
        "Jonathan: I'm your sister's baby boy. How could you set me up?",
        "Cassie: Because I was stupid, and I was so desperate to get rid of you. I couldn't stand by and watch you lurk around the edges of my daughter's life, and I couldn't stand watching Reva bend herself up like a pretzel trying to make you happy. I just wanted her to see what everyone else sees: That you are a heartless, soulless, monster.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. People tell me that.",
        "Cassie: Give me the tape.",
        "Jonathan: Um, I didn't... I didn't shoot any videotape. Did you?",
        "Cassie: Stop lying to me and give me the tape.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I'm very flattered that you want to relive the memories, but I only gave you what you asked for.",
        "Cassie: You're not even human. I wish to God you had died when you fell down those stairs.",
        "Reva: Stop it, Cassie. Stop it right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: I didn't mean to take your drink. I reached for the wrong glass.",
        "Blake: That's okay.",
        "Ross: Yeah. After what you've been through, it's amazing that you're functioning at all.",
        "Holly: Yeah. I mean, I was so desperate to get home and I'm starting to feel like a convict who's been released from prison and sleeps on the floor because she can't get used to the bed.",
        "Ross: That's understandable. It's going to take some time until you readjust.",
        "Holly: I'm fine. Really. I have to get back to work. Get back to my work and spend time with my family. And it'll be like nothing happened, because nothing Sebastian did to me will affect me if I don't let it.",
        "Blake: I think you need some closure.",
        "Holly: I've had closure.",
        "Blake: No, real closure, Mom. I think we should go back to the island and uncover Sebastian's body so we can have a memorial service.",
        "Holly: I am not going back to that island and neither are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: So, what happened after you found Michelle? You never told me.",
        "Danny: Because there really was nothing to tell. It became pretty obvious pretty quick that Michelle loves Tony. And I thought it would wipe me out, but it didn't. I know that I've been... for a long time now, I've been, I don't know, chasing something that doesn't exist. A memory. But I'm not going to do it anymore. I'm not. I am getting on with my life. I'm free and it feels good. Good folding.",
        "Marina: Oh, thank you. Okay, well, since he's all folded, I am going to get out of your hair.",
        "Danny: No, no, no. Stay.",

        "Cassie: I needed answers.",
        "Jonathan: I told her the truth, Mom. I told her everything I know.",
        "Cassie: You're a liar. What, do you have multiple personalities? One for my sister, one for Tammy, one for me?",
        "Reva: That's enough.",
        "Cassie: Why can't you see through his act?",
        "Reva: I was going to call you.",
        "Cassie: Well, I couldn't take the uncertainty, and I was with Edmund, and I...",
        "Reva: He told me everything, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: What did he say?",
        "Reva: He said nothing happened, that you passed out from too much booze and he put you in bed.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's not what he told me.",
        "Reva: He wanted you to think something else happened.",
        "Jonathan: It's true. You're safe.",
        "Cassie: Well, I'd like to believe you, but how do we know? I mean really, because he says so?",
        "Jonathan: I told my Mom the truth.",
        "Reva: He told me everything, Cassie. Including the part you left out.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Lillian: I need to... excuse me. I need to take you down for one last x-ray before we release you.",
        "Jonathan: Not right now. My Mom needs me.",
        "Reva: It's okay. It really is. I need to talk to Cassie.",
        "Lillian: He's pretty good at this.",
        "Reva: Thanks, Lillian.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Cassie. I don't hate you, okay? I understand why you did what you did. I feel like I made you suffer enough.",
        "Cassie: I have no idea what that animal told you.",
        "Reva: He told me that you set him up. Does this belong to you?",
        "Cassie: I can explain that.",
        "Reva: \"You and me tonight. Meet me at my suite at the Beacon at midnight.\" You wanted him to think that you were going to seduce him, isn't that it?",
        "Cassie: I had a plan.",
        "Reva: Oh, yeah. You had a plan, to drive him out of my life.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I sent Jonathan this note.",
        "Reva: Why?",
        "Cassie: Because I wanted you to see him for who he really was. And I knew if he came to my room, that he would show his true colors and try and attack me.",
        "Reva: Do you remember him attacking you?",
        "Cassie: I remember waking up the next morning with the kid lying next to me, saying, \"hey, babe, want to go again?\" Reva, I was just trying to protect you. I know how guilty you feel about giving Jonathan up and you couldn't see what he was doing to you.",
        "Reva: And you could?",
        "Cassie: You are my sister and I love you, and I'm not going to let that damn kid drag you down...",
        "Reva: That damn kid is my damn kid, okay?! He's mine! I gave birth to him. He's a part of me. And in case you've forgotten, he's a part of Richard, too. Okay, there's bad in him. Oh, yeah, there's bad. But there's good in him, too, buried beneath all that hate and that rage and the fear that everyone is out to get him. And you know what? Maybe it's not just a fear, Cassie. Maybe he's right.",
        "Cassie: I want him gone and I won't apologize for that. And this doesn't excuse what he did to me. He drugged me and he took off my clothes and did God knows what.",
        "Reva: Jonathan said there were no drugs. He said you were drunk that you'd had too much to drink, and I know you did, because I saw you. I was there!",
        "Cassie: I was faking it, Reva!",
        "Reva: (Scoffs) You were faking it.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I was. I had to be sober, so I could do what I needed to do.",
        "Reva: So that you could lure Jonathan into your room, is that it?",
        "Cassie: Yes I did. Yes. And I can't believe you're taking his side.",
        "Reva: I know that Jonathan isn't innocent. I know that he's twisted. There's something wrong. His sense of morality and decency have been all jerked around, I don't know, but you played on that, Cassie!",
        "Cassie: I can't believe that you're making excuses for him. He is sick, and the only thing I feel sorry for, the only thing I did wrong, is that I underestimated how vile and disgusting he is, Reva.",

        "Danny: I swear, any more toys, I am going to have to rent a warehouse.",
        "Marina: Yeah, Santa went a little overboard this year.",
        "Danny: Santa didn't think he'd be living in a hotel room again.",
        "Marina: You'll find a bigger place one of these days.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I'm going to start looking tomorrow. I have to.",
        "Marina: I love looking at houses and apartments. You never know what you're going to find.",
        "Danny: You do?",
        "Marina: I do. I do. You go in thinking that you know exactly what you want and then sometimes you discover something extremely unexpected and incredible.",
        "Danny: That's true, in a lot of ways.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: In some ways, I swear, life in Santo Domingo was just a lot simpler.",
        "Tony: You think so? Simpler?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. All we had to worry about was food and water and not to get bitten by spiders.",
        "Tony: Guess what? For me, I was the happiest I've ever been. You know why? Hm? Because I was with you, that's why. That's why.",

        "Holly: Promise me you'll drop this. This is not a game.",
        "Blake: All right, fine, I promise.",
        "Holly: Sebastian is dead. That's all we need to know. And I have to go.",
        "Blake: Go? What are you talking about? You just got here.",
        "Holly: I have a job. I have to go run the newspaper. I am so glad to see you.",
        "Ross: Good to see you, too. We'll talk later.",
        "Blake: Wow. She's a mess.",
        "Ross: Well, she's been through a lot, but your mother will get it together once she gets into her own life again.",
        "Blake: I think there's something that she's not telling us. I'm going to find out what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I set him up. But if he had a shred of decency, Reva, he would have walked away.",
        "Reva: I'm not excusing what Jonathan did, but he acted exactly the way I would have expected him to. You're the one who should have known better. You invited a troubled young man up to your room and you lured him! What did you expect him to do? You tried to trap him, Cassie. You tried to turn his own mother against him. And I'm beginning to think you'd stop at nothing to tear us apart.",
        "Cassie: You're right. I would sacrifice just about anything for you to open your eyes, because I think he is the worst thing that has ever happened to our family.",
        "Lillian: Excuse me, I'm just getting Jonathan's chart. This must belong to your son, Reva.",

        "Reva: It does, doesn't it?",
        "Cassie: Give me the tape.",
        "Reva: If it does, then we'll have all the answers, won't we? We'll know exactly what happened between you two that night.",
