        "Harley: It's too late. What does he mean too late? What does he mean?",
        "Mallet: Easy, just...",
        "Harley: What do you mean?",
        "Drifter: What do you think I meant?",
        "Mallet: Harley...",
        "Harley: You saw two men injured in a car and you did nothing to help them and you stole from them. What kind of animal are you?!",
        "Drifter: Look, it's dear- hunting season and I've got to eat. I had to get some gear, and trust me, neither one of those guys is getting up too soon.",
        "Harley: One of those guys is my husband.",
        "Drifter: Was your husband. I've seen a lot of road kill in my life, lady. I'm pretty sure you're a widow right now.",
        "Harley: What have you done with my husband? What have you done with my husband?",
        "Drifter: Come on, easy.",
        "Harley: You tell me, or so help me, you won't be worrying about leaving the scene of an accident, you won't be worrying about robbery charges. I'll have you tried for murder one. What have you done to my husband?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Not a bad seat in the house. Okay, lights, camera, action. Hello, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Reva. Where's Josh?",
        "Reva: Come on in. You'll see plenty of him in a minute.",
        "Olivia: Okay, you said he would be here.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, just have a seat, relax. Can I get you some popcorn, maybe a beer?",
        "Olivia: No, no, no. Thanks. The road is covered with ice. The only reason I'm here is because you said Josh needed to talk to me, so...",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, we spent the whole day making the videotape, the one with family and friends we send to Marah and Shayne.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I know the one. What does that have to do with me?",
        "Reva: I just thought maybe you'd like a preview.",
        "Josh: Everything all right in there?",
        "Olivia: Perfect.",
        "Reva: Quite a performance. I'm impressed.",
        "Olivia: Thanks. What the hell is this all about?",
        "Reva: You can get an Oscar for that performance, but what you aren't going to get is a Josh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: We don't want any trouble here, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: No trouble, Mr. O'Neill. I would just like to ask Tammy's mother something.",
        "Cassie: You have something to say, Jonathan, say it.",
        "Jonathan: Would you like to dance?",
        "Jeffrey: Not funny, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Good, because I'm dead serious.",
        "Cassie: You want me to dance with you? I'd love to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Drifter: Keep this thing out of my face, man. She's dangerous.",
        "Mallet: Pal, you have no idea!",
        "Harley: Give me five minutes with him-- just five minutes with him, I'll get the answers out him.",
        "Mallet: If I leave you alone with him, this low life will bring you up on charges.",
        "Drifter: You'd kill me.",
        "Harley: I just might.",
        "Mallet: Denton! Get in here!",
        "Drifter: She's crazy.",
        "Mallet: Take the trash out, will you? Get him out of here.",
        "Harley: No! You can't let him go.",
        "Mallet: Calm down!",
        "Harley: No, no, you can't let him go. We're not through with him yet.",
        "Mallet: He'll be locked up in the local until we question him again.",
        "Harley: I'm ready to question him now. That guy is our only witness! He knows something.",
        "Mallet: No, I don't think so. I don't think so.",
        "Harley: He saw someone, who saw-- somebody saw Gus leave that car!",
        "Mallet: Or Alan?",
        "Harley: Whatever! I don't care; I just want answers.",
        "Mallet: We swept the area! We've done a fly-over. They brought in a search dog.",
        "Harley: Okay, more reason to keep searching until we find something...",
        "Mallet: Not in this weather, Harley, not in this weather.",
        "Harley: Fine! Fine! So, what, get over it? Oh, he's gone. Gus is gone, he's dead, get over it, is that what you're saying?",
        "Mallet: Harley, Harley...",
        "Harley: This is so convenient for you. This is what you wanted all along!",
        "Mallet: What are you saying, Harley? That I'm out here hoping to bump into Gus' body, huh? So I can step right in and you can cry in my arms and you can be mine again? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Harley: No, I'm not saying that. Of course not, I'm sorry.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I hope not.",
        "Harley: He's out there, you know. He's not dead, I can feel it. He found shelter, or he made shelter, something, you know, and he's waiting for me. And he's out there; we just have to get to him. He's somewhere.",
        "Mallet: Come here, let me show you something on this map. I was looking through this. Right here. See that? Look at this creek right here? See that tributary leading from the river. Now I'm thinking... I'm thinking, if Gus found that creek, he might have followed it downstream, you know?",
        "Harley: Yeah, maybe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: My, Reva, you put a Revacam in Josh's room?",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) No. Actually, what happened I'm assuming is that we've been taping all day and Josh accidentally left the camera on. Who knew we were going to get bonus footage.",
        "Olivia: And it is a bonus. I thought I looked pretty good there, too.",
        "Reva: I thought you looked needy and pathetic.",
        "Olivia: I think you look scared-- scared that I might have a chance with Josh, or scared you blew your last chance with him.",
        "Reva: I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.",
        "Olivia: One too many. He's not here, is he? Could it be he is finished with you?",
        "Reva: Maybe. But I sure as hell am not going to turn him over to you. Josh deserves to be loved. And that's something you're not capable-- you can't give him what he needs because you're not capable of giving a man that kind of love. What you are capable of though, is reeling a man in making him king of the world. That's what you did with Bill. You pushed his daddy off the wagon and you pushed Bill ahead. He found out about it and he left you. So what do you think Josh is going to do when he finds out what you did to his brother?",
        "Olivia: Why don't you tell him. Tell him! Tell him every lousy thing you think of me. Tell him, please. Because you know what I think is going to happen. He's going to tell you to back off and stop trying to run his life, especially if you don't want to be a part of it.",
        "Reva: Maybe. I'll take my chances.",
        "Josh: Hello! Sorry I'm late, Reva. Okay. Well, this can't be good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: This cannot be good. Let's just stop them before one of them kills the other.",
        "Jeffrey: Hold on. Maybe this is a good time for them to work things out. If it get a little too rough, don't worry, I'll jump in there and break it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You and I haven't been able to talk since you turned your daughter and myself into the police.",
        "Cassie: Well, you don't want to get burned, you shouldn't start fires.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, Tammy's the one that's going to get burned here.",
        "Cassie: I love my daughter enough to keep her from throwing her life away.",
        "Jonathan: I'm good for her.",
        "Cassie: What would be good for her is if you fell off the face of the earth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jeffrey is it just me, or is my mom actually smiling?",
        "Jeffrey: Looks like it. Maybe they broke the ice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You need to realize, I'm not going anywhere. You might as well kick up your feet and enjoy the dance.",
        "Cassie: Or I could just dance you over to an empty elevator shaft.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughing ) Oh, Cassie, you just can't accept that it might be good for Tammy to have me around.",
        "Cassie: Not possible.",
        "Jonathan: She knows that I love her. She knows that I will never hurt her.",
        "Cassie: But you do hurt her, Jonathan. You're the one who is ruining her life. She has to suffer for every choice you make. In fact, she received an interesting letter today from Springfield University.",
        "Jonathan: Yes, she's going back to school?",
        "Cassie: Not exactly. It turns out she is not welcome to finish her term there because she has been declared an accessory to arson. You burn down a house and she pays the price.",
        "Jonathan: I'll fix this.",
        "Cassie: No, Jonathan, you can't fix this. Because the one thing you can't do anything about is that you are her cousin, and you may be okay with that, and your mother may be okay with that, but according to the rest of the world, you're crossing a line that should never be crossed, ever.",
        "Jonathan: I can live with that.",
        "Cassie: Well, I can't. Because you're selfish and your dangerous, and the longer Tammy spends with you, the more it will cost her. I'm not just talking about her future. It may cost her, her life. So look into my eyes, I want you to look at me and tell me, do you really think that you're good for her? Think about it, Jonathan, think about what happens next for Tammy. She can't go back to school. Think what happens when she tries to find a new job or a new place to live or make new friends. She can't escape it, this mark you left on her life. What if-- God forbid-- she decides what matters most of all is to start her own family. How good for her do you think you'll be then? You've been leading this dance with my daughter for months now. If you love her, if you really want to be good for her, don't you think it is time you step off this dance floor?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: If Jonathon and Mom somehow learn to get along, you deserve a lot of the credit, you know.",
        "Jeffrey: Not me.",
        "Tammy: Jeffrey, you've done a lot. I mean, you helped get Jonathan out of jail.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that was for you and your mom. I've recused myself from Jonathan's case. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that this is handled fairly, but any mistakes he has made in the past should be, you know, left out of court.",
        "Tammy: I hope my mom understands that. We've all made mistakes, but I don't think they should haunt you forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You made a great case, Aunt Cassie, and you're right, a nice guy would leave her alone for her own good.",
        "Cassie: Exactly.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not a nice guy. So... if Springfield University doesn't want your daughter, then she'll find another school to go to. And if some boss won't hire her, then she'll find another boss, or she'll be her own boss. Same thing goes for the landlords and friends and everybody else who live in the same small-minded world that you do.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughing )",
        "Jonathan: One more thing, if she does decide she wants a family, don't worry. You've been one hell of a role model. All she has to do is look at the example you set as a mother, then do the opposite.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So, ladies, what did I miss?",
        "Reva: I was just showing Olivia some of the out-takes from the tape we made yesterday.",
        "Josh: Really? Bloopers, that kind of thing?",
        "Olivia: No! Not those kind of out-takes. It is me doing what I do best.",
        "Josh: Crunching numbers.",
        "Olivia: Okay, second best.",
        "Josh: Sorry about that. You said you brought the Stemson contract.",
        "Olivia: Right here. Are you in a rush? Because I was thinking if you're hungry, we could order some room service. Anything you want is on me.",
        "Olivia: Are you happy, the truth is out? I'm interested in Josh, okay, and I've done everything in my power to try to get him interested in me, but it is not happening. I get one go-around with the you've got the permanent pass. I envy you, I do. So pop your champagne and enjoy yourself. All right? I know when I've been beaten.",
        "Josh: Olivia--",
        "Olivia: No! No. You'll have my resignation by morning.",
        "Josh: No, Olivia. Would you wait for just a minute, please?",
        "Olivia: No!",
        "Reva: I didn't think it was possible, but I believe that that performance was even better than the one we caught on tape.",
        "Josh: Well the hell is the matter with you?",
        "Reva: Me?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Come on, Josh, you're not buying that, are you? You were married to her, for God's sakes, you know what she is capable of. You know that she's capable of a lot you don't even know about.",
        "Josh: At least she's up front about what she wants, which is kind of funny because that is a quality I used to admire in you. Okay, you know what? No more games. You really have something you want to say to me about Olivia, say it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I mean this whole area is a fly-over area, but nobody has checked it out on foot. I mean, it's rough country.",
        "Harley: It's all rough country. Look at that, it's... it's one great big topographical nightmare. There are so many places he could be hiding out there, so many little spots, and somebody could be walking by just yards away from him and they wouldn't even see him. The woods-- those choppers can't get to him. It's just getting colder out there.",
        "Mallet: If he's out there, we're going to find him.",
        "Harley: If?",
        "Mallet: Hey. You're the one with the faith, remember. Come on. Do you remember years ago, that serial bank robber case, do you remember that one? A huge manhunt, we couldn't find the guy, it took months and months, we finally tracked him down and we chased him up here beside the lake. Do you remember that? I mean we did everything except swim the lake. But in the end, what happened? In the end...",
        "Harley: We found him.",
        "Mallet: We found him. And it was a fishing shack, remember that? Wet to the bone, the guy was nearly frozen to death-- only too happy to come in out of the cold. Well that's what's going to happen this time. Gus will be only too happy to come in out of the cold. We'll find him, we'll plan on finding him, and you know what? We're going to find him in some lean-to that is not even on that stupid map. And they'll be hugging each other and blaming each other, and they're going to blame us because it took us so long to find them. You would think they would be grateful, but they're not going to be grateful. But we'll find them. That's what is going to happen.",
        "Harley: I'm the one who is grateful. I don't know how I would do this if you weren't here with me.",
        "Mallet: You don't have to think about that. Actually, why don't you stop thinking all together for a while. Why don't you lay down, close your eyes, relax. All right. Just for a few minutes. Relax, I'll run over to that diner across the street and get us some food.",
        "Harley: I'm not hungry.",
        "Mallet: Yes, you are. I can't think because of the noises your stomach is making.",
        "Harley: I'm feeling a little wobbly.",
        "Mallet: Why don't you relax, and close your eyes, and before you open them, I'll be back with all of these warm styrofoamy things filled with food. It will be all right. Cuddle up.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: Sleep.",
        "Harley: Sleep.",
        "Mallet: All right.",
        "Harley: Sleep, yeah, right. I'm going to go find Gus.",

        "Gina Tognoni, inside \"The Light.\" Dinah's best trait is that she doesn't really allow people to see her sweat. Dinah would be-- in my estimation-- she's like a fallen angel. I'm similar do Dinah. We both have faith. Dinah tends to have faith in herself, and I have faith I'd like to think in God. See Dinah, Wednesday, January 18th, inside \"The Light.\"",

        "Cassie: I'm not a perfect mother, Jonathan, but Tammy comes first.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy comes first with me, too. So I think we understand each other?",
        "Cassie: You think we do?",
        "Jonathan: Sure. You think I'm poison. I think you screwed your own life up so bad that you need to live Tammy's for her. Does that sum it up?",
        "Cassie: You twisted little... the only cure for a poison that runs this deep is to find its antidote, and you better believe I'm looking for it.",
        "Jonathan: Is that a threat?",
        "Cassie: Oh, I'm just a mother looking out for her daughter, and there is nothing I won't do to kick your sorry ass out of her life. When this goes to trial, I will be the star witness against you, and I will do everything I can to keep my daughter from giving her life to a predator such as yourself because you came to this town to destroy your own family.",
        "Jonathan: Things have changed, Cassie. Tammy changed me.",
        "Cassie: I don't buy it. I think you're doing exactly what you came to this town to do. So if anyone asks me about the fire you set...",
        "Jonathan: Which was an accident.",
        "Cassie: Trust me, I will not hesitate to blow you and your flimsy alibi out of the water.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy will hate you, you know that.",
        "Cassie: It's worth it if it saves her life.",
        "Jonathan: Thank you for the dance, Aunt Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Jonathan: My pleasure. Hey, you.",
        "Tammy: Hey, you.",
        "Jeffrey: That was some dance.",
        "Cassie: You have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Come on, Reva, let's hear it. Enlighten me.",
        "Reva: All right. Why do you think Olivia's marriage to Bill fell apart? What, do you think they mysteriously drifted apart from each other?",
        "Josh: I think you already know the answer so why don't you just tell me. Okay, why did Bill divorce Olivia?",
        "Olivia: Tell him, tell him every lousy thing you think of me. You know what I think is going to happen? He's going to tell you to back off, and stop trying to run his life, especially if you don't want to be a part of it.",
        "Reva: What could I possibly tell you that you don't already know?",
        "Josh: You opened this can, Reva.",
        "Reva: Fine. The same reason you and Olivia broke up is the same reason Bill and Olivia broke up. Because she has this blind ambition and greed. There's no honesty, there's no loyalty, there's no ethics at all. So I'm glad she quit her job. I am. You need someone that you can work with that you can trust.",
        "Josh: Like who, you? Are you asking me for a job right now? A real job, Reva?",
        "Reva: Well, it's a family business, right? And I'll tell you something, I'm real tired of just showing up every so often for a shareholders' meeting, and the last time I looked, we were still family. So you bet, I want that job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: ( Gasps ) Oh!",
        "Billy: You know, I never really thought of you as a Peeping Tom, but hey, if it works for you, it's okay by me.",
        "Olivia: Great, just leave me alone.",
        "Josh: Oh, come on. Now what is this? Is it national pick on Olivia day or something? What's the matter with you.",
        "Billy: You can lead a mule to water, but you cannot make him drink it.",
        "Olivia: Go away.",
        "Josh: It's okay, he's gone.",
        "Olivia: Josh...",
        "Josh: Okay, you can turn off the waterworks now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I have hot soup and it smells... hot. Harley! Harley?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Maybe Mallet was right, and you decided to follow that creek, and... you're headed there somewhere. Okay, I'm North-- no, I was going North. Why am I so turned around here? My map! Oh, no, oh. Okay, I've got my compass. I've got my map, I've got my flashlight. I've got to find Gus. Gus. You know that time will never...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that was quite a night.",
        "Jonathan: I won't forget it real soon, I can tell you that.",
        "Cassie: Neither will I.",
        "Tammy: I'm just so glad you and Jonathan understand each other a little better now.",
        "Jonathan: No question, I know exactly what she's about.",
        "Cassie: I love you, that's what I'm about. Don't you forget it. Good night, sweetie.",
        "Tammy: Good night, Mom. Good night, Jeffrey. Okay. I don't know what that dance was all about, but I do know that you tried, and I love you for that. The strongest light above, guide us while we love...",
        "Tammy: Thank you.",
        "Jonathan: Don't get your hopes up. Your mother is not going to leave us alone until she figures out a way to break us up permanently.",
        "Tammy: That is not going to happen. I wish that she could see what I see: How happy you make me, and how much you have given me.",
        "Jonathan: I wish I could give you more.",
        "Tammy: Oh, I can't believe I have to go home and go to bed in our separate rooms now.",
        "Jonathan: You're a big girl.",
        "Tammy: I can't go to sleep knowing you're just down the hall. I keep wishing there was somebody there that I love with me.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: You willing to risk Reva's wrath?",
        "Tammy: I wasn't talking about you; I was talking about Harvey, my teddy bear. I've had him ever since-- I can't think of him not being there. I left him at my mom's house. Oh, well. You coming?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah. I'm going to drop you at Reva's, and I've got to check on Outskirts, though. I'll be home shortly.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, I love you.",
        "Jonathan: That never gets old.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Josh, really, you show him a picture of what a gold digger looks like and he can't see it.",
        "Reva: Well, I haven't brought out the big guns yet.",
        "Billy: Did you tell him how Olivia spiked my drink?",
        "Reva: No. I was tempted, but being a rat isn't exactly my style.",
        "Billy: Did you tell him about the bottle?",
        "Reva: He saw the tape.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Well, I'm 14 hours sober if that makes you feel any better.",
        "Reva: A little.",
        "Billy: A little. So what about you?",
        "Reva: What about me?",
        "Billy: You and Josh. You're trying to get rid of Olivia, that's got to count for something.",
        "Reva: I know, but I can't rush this, Billy. Josh has to feel like he can trust me again, and that might take a while, but that's how it has to go.",
        "Billy: Just day by day?",
        "Reva: Yeah. You know, making that videotape for the kids, it made me realize just how I screwed up, how I have totally lost touch with what he means to me. I made the mess, and I can't really clean it up overnight, so I'm taking baby steps. I asked for a job.",
        "Billy: At Lewis?",
        "Reva: Yeah! I'm a shareholder, thanks to your daddy. I need to protect my shares.",
        "Billy: And that's all you want to protect?",
        "Reva: ( Laughing ) Well, I just feel like I should be there to share more with Joshua. And, you know, it just doesn't feel right the way it is right now, and our friendship--",
        "Billy: Friendship. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Why don't you just say what it is, come right out. Reva, you want Josh back?",

        "Olivia: So what did Reva tell you?",
        "Josh: Actually she asked for your job.",
        "Olivia: My job? Oh, that's going too far.",
        "Josh: That's the Olivia I want, one who stands up and fights.",
        "Olivia: What I want is a good man to share my world with, but I keep screwing up! You know what?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Olivia: I actually thought that we had a chance at something, but I know it is not in the cards. I know. Do me a favor. Don't settle. Let some lucky woman share her life with you. Because you deserve that. Anyway, I've got to go.",
        "Josh: Just a second. There's something that we need to get settled between the two of us, and I think it should be tonight.",
        "Olivia: Can't I just go and clean out my desk, please.",
        "Josh: If I ask you something nice, will you do it for me?",

        "Harley: I'm fine. I'm fine. I'll be fine. I just... where have you been? Where's Alan? I'd given up all hope of finding you. Why did you leave the crash site?",
        "Gus: That's one thing I never have to worry about you, you giving up. Knowing that you're out there looking for me, knowing that you'll never let go, that's what is keeping me alive.",
        "Harley: Where's Alan? You didn't hurt him, did you?",
        "Gus: Sh-sh-sh, there's plenty of time for that.",
        "Harley: Can you just give me an answer, please?",

        "Harley: Ow.",
        "Mallet: Come here. I didn't come out here and risk my life to find you so you can trample off. Now let's go.",
        "Harley: I have to find Gus.",

        "Harley: I have to find him, okay? Just me!",
        "Mallet: He's my partner; it's my job to keep him safe.",
        "Harley: Your partner? He's my life! Do you know what it's like when a part of you is lost? This person that you love and you share your life with and you need them just to breathe and they're just gone? Suddenly they're just gone, do you know what that is like?",
        "Mallet: Do I know what that feels like? Huh? Do I know what that feels like to walk around half alive because you need somebody so bad you're numb and you want them and you need them and you want to breathe them in, but you can't because you're numb because you're shut down you've got so much pain inside of you, you're afraid to show it, because you might just split in two. You might not even make it till tomorrow. Do I know what that feels like? Yeah, I think I do, Harley, because that's how I feel about you, okay? That's how I feel about you.",

        "Josh: No, it is not.",
        "Olivia: You're going to buy me a drink so I don't feel like such a loser. I don't want your sympathy. I don't want it or need it. Yours or anybody else's. I am fine and I will be fine so if it's all the same, I just want to go.",
        "Josh: You always just walk out on your dates like that?",
        "Olivia: Huh? Date?",
        "Josh: I want to be with you. That's why I'm here. This is not about manipulating you in some way. This is just me wanting to be with you right here, right now.",
        "Olivia: Really?",
        "Josh: Really.",
        "Olivia: Why is it that I always feel like a 16-year-old girl with you?",
