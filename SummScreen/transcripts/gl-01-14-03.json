        "Marah: Hey, any sign of my dad yet? ",
        "Tony: Mm-mm, not yet. ",
        "Marah: Good. Wouldn't want him to see that. ",
        "Tony: Yeah, he might take me on another hunting trip. ",
        "Marah: Hey, I thought your arm was getting better. ",
        "Tony: Yeah, but you know, why let your dad know about that. He messed with \r\nthe tension on the crossbow. And now I am going to mess with him. ",
        "Marah: You and my dad are playing tricks on each other. What universe have we \r\nlanded in? Hi, Dad. ",
        "Josh: Hi. Marah, could you join us over here, please. ",
        "Marah: You could say hello to Tony with the mangled arm. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, hi, Tony. ",
        "Tony: Hi. ",
        "Josh: Excuse us, this is important. Shayne, why don't you sit here? I asked \r\nto see you, not you and Tony. Now what I have to say to both of you has to \r\nremain confidential until we work some things out. ",
        "Marah: What kind of things? ",
        "Josh: Well, this is about your mother and the phone calls she's been getting.\r\n",
        "Tony: You mean the hang-ups. ",
        "Josh: Well, they're not just the hang-ups, son. A person calls her a murderer \r\nand then threatens her. ",
        "Marah: But I thought we changed the phone number. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, but then the person started calling on her private cell phone \r\nnumber. Now we had the police track where those calls are coming from, and this \r\nis where it gets a little bizarre. ",
        "Shayne: Well, what do you mean by bizarre? ",
        "Josh: The calls are coming from the house. ",
        "Marah: Our house? ",
        "Josh: Yeah, our house. So it's somebody who has access to the house and \r\neverything in it. Maybe somebody who found your mother's cell phone number. ",
        "Marah: Wait, wait. Is that why you didn't want Tony to hear this, because you \r\nthink that he might have something to do with it? ",
        "Josh: Marah, all I want are some answers. ",
        "",
        "Reva: Alan. ",
        "Alan: Reva, I\u2019m being monitored right now, and I have to stay very calm. ",
        "Reva: That's fine. Then just answer my questions about Annie, and I will sing \r\nyou the most beautiful lullaby. ",
        "Alan: Reva, I am not... ",
        "Reva: Just tell me what I need to know, Alan, and I'll be on my way. ",
        "Alan: You're badgering a man who just had a heart attack, and I\u2019m not going \r\nto put... I'm warning you. ",
        "Reva: I'm not playing games. I want you to tell me everything you know about \r\nAnnie Dutton.",
        "",
        "Olivia: Hey. ",
        "Phillip: It's morning, yeah. I thought I'd let you sleep in. ",
        "Olivia: Why, did I look like I needed it? ",
        "Phillip: No. You just look so beautiful, I didn't want to wake you. ",
        "Olivia: I didn't expect. ",
        "Phillip: I didn't, either. You wore me out. ",
        "Olivia: Do you have any regrets? ",
        "Phillip: Tons. ",
        "Olivia: Me, too. But I'm glad you stayed. ",
        "Phillip: Are you? ",
        "Olivia: Yeah, yeah. ",
        "Phillip: Because we weren't drunk. We knew what we were doing. ",
        "Olivia: We knew. ",
        "Phillip: So what the hell. Night, morning, no difference, right? ",
        "Olivia: Except for one. Everything's changed. ",
        "Phillip: I'm not going to force anything on you. ",
        "Olivia: You won't have to. ",
        "Phillip: No, I mean, you said everything's changed, and you're right, \r\neverything has changed. But what that means is still up to us. I think we both \r\nknow what you stand to lose if you walk away from my father right now. He's been \r\nwaving that pre-nup in your face for a week. ",
        "Olivia: He's going to take the hotel. ",
        "Phillip: Yeah, well, you walk away from him for me, he'll take more than \r\nthat. He'll ruin you. ",
        "Olivia: He'll ruin me. I can handle that. I can handle just about anything \r\nexcept not being honest about my feelings for you.",
        "Phillip: I won't let him hurt you. ",
        "Olivia: No, I don't do that anymore. ",
        "Phillip: Do what? No, I'm just saying I will be there to back you up. ",
        "Olivia: No, you won't. Because if it's one thing I've learned being with Alan \r\nis that I can't be taken care of anymore. I don't want to be taken care of. I \r\njust want to have what we have. ",
        "Phillip: I know, so do I. But I'm telling you, if he's jumping all over \r\nyou... ",
        "Olivia: Then I'll jump back. I'm more than capable of doing it. In fact, I\u2019m \r\ndangerous when provoked. Check my bio. ",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I'll check your bio. ",
        "Olivia: Wait a minute, you're not going to find anything down there. ",
        "Phillip: You sure? ",
        "Olivia: I mean... (laughs) ",
        "Phillip: Maybe a search is in order. ",
        "Olivia: Or something. ",
        "Phillip: You're something. You're everything that I imagined you would be.\r\n",
        "Olivia: You're not. ",
        "Phillip: I'm not? ",
        "Olivia: No, you're even better than I imagined, and that poses a real \r\nproblem. ",
        "Phillip: I think I can fix that. ",
        "Olivia: We can\u2019t. ",
        "Phillip: You don't want to. ",
        "Olivia: Oh, I want to, but I want a few other things. I want my honor, and I \r\nwant my pride, and most of all, I want you. I really want you. But after I've \r\nended things with Alan. ",
        "Phillip: Okay. Then I\u2019ll get dressed. When are you going to tell him? ",
        "Olivia: Well, I guess there's no time like the present. ",
        "",
        "Marah: I'm not going to sit here and let you accuse Tony of something so low. \r\nWhat would he possibly have to gain about making a bunch of crazy phone calls?\r\n",
        "Josh: Marah, just sit down. ",
        "Marah: No, do I need to remind you that he was the one who helped mom out \r\nwhen she was put in jail? He used his connections to make sure that she got out \r\nalive. ",
        "Josh: I hear you. Would you please lower your voice and sit down? Thank you. \r\nI'm not pointing fingers here. The fact is, the calls came from inside the \r\nhouse, so it's probably somebody we know. ",
        "Shayne: Or let in. ",
        "Marah: What if we didn't let them in? Do you think someone has been hiding \r\nout in the house? ",
        "Shayne: Well, who could it be? ",
        "Marah: I don't know who, Shayne? ",
        "Josh: Guys, I don't think we have to worry about that, okay? ",
        "Shayne: Well, what do you think? ",
        "Josh: What I want to know is this: Have either one of you loaned your key to \r\na friend, something like that? ",
        "Shayne: Absolutely not. ",
        "Josh: Or have you seen anybody hanging around the house that might be a \r\nlittle bit off, you know, like the guy who reads the meter or a delivery guy, \r\nsomething like that. ",
        "Marah: Dad, I don't exactly even live in the house anymore. ",
        "Shayne: But, look, I do. And if anything out of the ordinary was happening, I \r\nthink I\u2019d notice it. The only person who, like, drops by sometimes is Marah just \r\nto do her laundry or something. ",
        "Josh: Okay, all right, all right, I understand. It's just easier to think \r\nthat way than it is to think of the alternative. ",
        "Shayne: The alternative being? ",
        "Josh: Something I\u2019m working on with the police right now. It's just... Look, \r\nyou know what? I've gotten what I need to out of you guys. You don't need to \r\nworry about this anymore. Tell you what, let me buy you some breakfast. ",
        "Marah: Are you kidding? You drop a mystery on us like that, and you just \r\nexpect us to forget about it. ",
        "Josh: Marah, I just wanted to make sure you're safe. ",
        "Marah: Is mom safe? ",
        "Josh: She will be. ",
        "Marah: That's not good enough, Dad, I want to know everything that you know, \r\nand don't you leave anything out. ",
        "",
        "Alan: Reva, I don't respond well to threats. ",
        "Reva: And you know that I don't give up. You have information I need, just \r\ngive it to me. Tell me where Annie Dutton is, and I will let you rest in peace. \r\nI don't need a thesis, just an address. ",
        "Alan: I don't have her address. If you remember, we parted ways. ",
        "Reva: And where did she go? California? New York? Is she still here? ",
        "Alan: Reva, I told you... ",
        "Reva: You told me lies, Alan, because we both know each other. Annie Dutton \r\nwas the one true love of your life. She was your soul mate, Ozzie and Sharon, \r\nAnnie and Alan. You don't lose track of someone like that. ",
        "Alan: Well, if you remember, Annie had a few problems. ",
        "Reva: Problems? She was crazy as a loon and twice as dangerous, but you loved \r\nher because of that. Because she gave you an outlet. She gave you an excuse to \r\nreally get in touch with your finer qualities. You two were inseparable. In fact \r\nit was you that let her escape the last time. And I'm pretty darn sure you know \r\nwhere she is and what she's doing. ",
        "Alan: Even if I knew where she was, why would I send you over there? ",
        "Reva: I'm not going to hurt her. I just need information. ",
        "Alan: Information, huh? What are you afraid of? ",
        "Reva: What I'm afraid of is that Rick Bauer is going to shoo me out of here \r\nbefore I get my information. There's also the possibility that I might be wrong.\r\n",
        "Alan: About what? ",
        "Reva: I can't tell you anything more right now. ",
        "Alan: This is very important to you, isn't it? ",
        "Reva: Yes, it is. ",
        "Alan: I suppose you'll make it worth my while. ",
        "Reva: If I can. ",
        "Alan: All right, Reva. But I'll tell you this, you have no idea what you're \r\ngetting yourself into by digging into your past. No idea at all. All right, \r\nReva. I'll tell you where you can find, Annie. But what about your end of the \r\nbargain? ",
        "Reva: You haven't told me what that is yet. ",
        "Alan: I hear that you're doing an investigative piece on the Spaulding \r\nfamily, is that true? ",
        "Reva: Holly wants an in-depth report on the takeover of Spaulding \r\nEnterprises, why it happened, who was affected. ",
        "Alan: Yes, I'm sure you'll be talking to friends and business associates \r\nabout me, Phillip, and Alexandra. ",
        "Reva: Yeah, I intend to dig up the usual background material. ",
        "Alan: Mm-hmm. And probably some not so usual. ",
        "Reva: Where are you going with this? ",
        "Alan: You want information from me, I want information from you. If you run \r\nacross anything about Alexandra that might be interesting to me, I want you to \r\ngive me a peek before you air it. ",
        "Reva: You want me to spy on your own sister for you. ",
        "Alan: You want to find out where Annie is? ",
        "Reva: Alan, the last thing in the world that I want right now is to have \r\nanything to do with Annie Dutton, but I don't have a choice. ",
        "Alan: Must speak up, do we have a deal or not, I don't have time to \r\nnegotiate. Come on, Reva. ",
        "Reva: Deal. ",
        "Alan: Don't say I didn't warn you. ",
        "",
        "Marah: What are you trying to hide from us, Dad? What is it that you don't \r\nwant us to know about this caller? ",
        "Shayne: I mean, if there's a serial killer on the loose or something, Dad, \r\nyou've got to let us know. ",
        "Josh: No, wait, nobody's on the loose, okay? I don't want you guys getting \r\ninvolved because I don't know where this thing is going to go. I'm sorry if I \r\ngave you the wrong impression, I'm just trying to follow all the leads. ",
        "Marah: Just like you always do. ",
        "Josh: What? ",
        "Marah: Dad, think about it, all right? It's always mom. I mean, first she \r\ndrives off a pier and disappears, and then we find out she's married to a \r\nprince, and then who she later pulls the plug on, and then she goes to jail. And \r\nyou know what? That's not even the half of it. ",
        "Josh: Marah. ",
        "Marah: No, it isn't. It's always something, and you're always there to tell \r\nus to just forget about it, just ignore it. But we can't do that anymore. We \r\ncan't. ",
        "Shayne: She's completely right, Dad. ",
        "Marah: All right, we are involved whether we want to be or not. ",
        "Josh: Both of you... Both of you just settle down, okay? This could be just a \r\ncrank call situation. It might be some kid who's watching your mom's program.\r\n",
        "Marah: Does it seem like it's just some kid. ",
        "Josh: Well, I\u2019m not sure of anything right now, sweetheart. ",
        "Shayne: Okay, then it's not a kid. ",
        "Josh: No! I'm just saying I'm not sure of anything right now, that's it. \r\nLook, I wanted you guys to know what was going on, but I don't want you to be \r\ninvolved. I can't be thinking about what's going on with you two, or what you \r\ntwo are doing when I\u2019m so worried about all this other stuff. Now if it becomes \r\na serious threat... ",
        "Shayne: Well, is mom scared? ",
        "Josh: Yes, she's scared! She's spooked. Who wouldn't be? So if you really \r\nwant to help her... ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I\u2019ll help her by... ",
        "Josh: If you want to help her, just be there for her and tell her you love \r\nher. ",
        "Shayne: I'm going go grab your golf clubs, grab a nine iron, and anyone who \r\ncomes in, is walking out with broken knee caps. ",
        "Josh: It's not going to come to that, son. ",
        "Marah: How do you know? ",
        "Josh: I know because I'm your father. And because I've always taken care of \r\nyou, haven't I? ",
        "Marah: Always. ",
        "Josh: Let me take care of you, then, both of you. Have some breakfast, go to \r\na movie, something like that. Don't worry about this. ",
        "Marah: Can you believe this? ",
        "Shayne: I don't know, maybe he's right. This could be just like... Remember \r\nwhat my friend Lenny did, when he called up to the girls' dorm and he said, \r\n\"Ooh, I can see you through the curtain.\" It's probably like just a big joke, \r\nyou know. ",
        "Marah: Okay, did Lenny call them from inside their house? ",
        "Shayne: No. ",
        "Marah: No, did he get their unlisted cell phone numbers? ",
        "Shayne: Look, maybe there's a simpler way. I'm sure you can access, like, \r\nphone numbers online if you have the right thing. I can maybe look into it. ",
        "Marah: Will you do that, please, and get back to me? ",
        "Shayne: Yeah, I\u2019ll do that. ",
        "Marah: Thank you. ",
        "Shayne: Just do me a favor, just watch your back, will you? ",
        "Tony: You okay? ",

        "Olivia: It's still no. ",

        "Olivia: And if it's so right, why do I feel so lousy? ",
        "Phillip: No, because the right way isn't always the easy way. It's certainly \r\nnot the fun way. But I think in this case, it's probably the only way. ",

        "Olivia: You're rationalizing because you're ashamed. ",
        "Phillip: Oh no. I'm not ashamed of anything we did. After the way he \r\nmanipulated us. No. Are you? ",

        "Alan: You're standing up, and then all of a sudden, you're on the floor, \r\nafraid to shut your eyes for fear of never seeing a familiar face again. Think \r\nof all the wrongs in your life, and they suddenly become very trite, petty.

        "Tony: Well, it was kind of hard not to. You got pretty loud. ",
        "Marah: All right, well then you also heard me tell him that I can't ignore \r\nthis. Tony, this is my mom, what if someone really is going after her? ",
        "Tony: Then it could be dangerous, and your father's right. ",
        "Marah: So I should just ignore that someone's coming over to the house? ",
        "Tony: If it is coming from the house. You know, telephone technology is a \r\ntricky thing. Everything's routed through computers, and computers can be \r\nfooled. ",
        "Marah: So you're saying that the calls could look like they're coming from \r\nthe house. ",

        "Marah: So you can help. You can find out where the calls are coming from? ",

I discovered the tape, \r\nyou had had your accident, and when I got home today, I realized we never had an \r\nopportunity to have our Christmas together. So I opened these gifts and I ran \r\nacross this photograph. The harbor in San Cristobel. When did you take this? ",
        "Olivia: A long time ago. ",
        "Alan: It has written on it: \"Our first child, but not our last. I love you, \r\nOlivia.\" It was our first. The beginning of our empire. ",
