        "Gus: God! ",
        "Harley: Oh, no, what are you doing? ",
        "Gus: Is it necessary to clean up for a lawyer? He's just a lawyer. ",
        "Harley: He's not just a lawyer. He's Everett Gardner, counselor to the rich \r\nand richer. ",
        "Gus: Oh, so what? ",
        "Harley: So what if he-- get off the court. What if he gets here and he \r\ndecides that this is not a fit environment for Zach? What if... What if it \r\ndoesn't matter how much money Alexandra... what if he quits? That's what I'm \r\nsaying. ",
        "Gus: What happens is we'll just get to mess up the place even more, okay. \r\nListen to me for once. Okay, no, I've got it. ",
        "Harley: I have to go to the door anyway. ",
        "Gus: Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. ",
        "Harley: Lighter vacuum. Hi, Mr. Gardner. Please come in. I'm Harley Cooper.\r\n",
        "Gardner: Oh, this is the right house. ",
        "Harley: Yes, yes this is definitely the right house. And this is Gus Aitoro, \r\nMr. Gardner. ",
        "Gus: How do you do, sir, it's nice to meet you. ",
        "Harley: Yeah, so, please, sit down. ",
        "Gardner: Thank you. ",
        "Harley: So Alexandra tells me you have good news. ",
        "Gardner: And some bad. ",
        "Gus: Well, you know, why don't we just start with the good. That would be \r\ngood. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. ",
        "Gardner: The family court's finally assigned a hearing date for your custody \r\ncase at my urging. ",
        "Harley: Oh, that's good. That's very good. That's very good. What is the bad \r\nnews? ",
        "Gardner: Your ex-husband's charges that your son would be exposed to unsavory \r\ninfluences in this house won't be easy to refute. ",
        "Gus: Oh please, why not? They're all lies. ",
        "Harley: You know what? Phillip feels that Gus will not be a good example to \r\nour son, that he might even be dangerous. So, how do we contest that? ",
        "Gardner: Well, you might start by convincing me that Mr. Spaulding's wrong.",
        "",
        "Danny: This is no good. ",
        "Cassie: Wow, I guess you don't need any more coffee. ",
        "Danny: Sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I've got it. ",
        "Cassie: You know the night manager told me that you've been out here since \r\nbefore dawn. ",
        "Danny: Yeah. I got a little sick of staring at the walls in my room. I was... \r\nYou know, all these plans were for Michelle and Robbie. ",
        "Cassie: And you've still got Robbie. ",
        "Danny: I don't know how I\u2019m supposed to get through this day knowing that my \r\nwife is shacked up with a guy in a cabin who is more than happy to take my \r\nplace. Take my life. Right now, all I want to do is beat the hell out of Bill \r\nLewis. ",
        "",
        "Michelle: Good morning. Bill, I said good morning. ",
        "Bill: Ah, good morning. ",
        "Michelle: Are you leaving? ",
        "Bill: Yeah, yeah, I don't think the skiing is going to be too great today.\r\n",
        "Michelle: What, did you have your eyes closed when you looked out the window? \r\nThere's a foot of fresh powder out there. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, actually it has nothing to do with the skiing. It's work. \r\nYou know, I'm feeling a little guilty about being up here with so much stuff I \r\nhave to do. ",
        "Michelle: You told me you didn't have anything scheduled for at least a week.\r\n",
        "Bill: I did? ",
        "Michelle: Bill, what is going on and no more lame excuses. ",
        "Bill: I'm leaving because of you. ",
        "Michelle: Are you mad at me? ",
        "Bill: Do I look mad at you? Look, Michelle, I know we agreed that we're going \r\nto take things slowly. ",
        "Michelle: Pre-New Year's Eve slow. ",
        "Bill: Right, and I'm fine with that in theory. I just... I don't think I can \r\nhold up my end of the bargain. So I\u2019d rather be a gentleman and split then...\r\n",
        "Michelle: Then what? ",
        "Bill: Pull off your robe and make love to you right now, which is what I want \r\nto do. ",
        "",
        "Harley: Well, I don't see why we should have to defend Gus. ",
        "Gardner: Because he's beyond reproach? ",
        "Harley: No, because he's a wonderful person. Because he's a great police \r\nofficer. As a matter of fact he's a hero, and the only person who doesn't agree \r\nwith that is Phillip. ",
        "Gardner: Well, the arbitrator didn't come away with too high an opinion of \r\nhim. This is strong stuff. ",
        "Gus: Sir, it's wrong. Okay, it's wrong stuff. ",
        "Gardner: You didn't commit a murder that was witnessed by your sister, Eden, \r\nwhom you also burned with a cigarette when she annoyed you? ",
        "Gus: Absolutely not. ",
        "Harley: No, no, no. This report was months ago, and Alexandra hasn't filled \r\nyou in on any recent developments? ",
        "Gardner: Oh, yes she has, but the official record is the place where the \r\nfamily court and therefore, we, must start from. Our job will be to prove that \r\nthe inaccuracies here put a lie to Mr. Spaulding's allegations. ",
        "Gus: Well, you know something, that really shouldn't be that difficult, okay? \r\nBecause my sister lied about what happened on the roof, she lies about \r\neverything, she lied about everything. ",
        "Gardner: Well, that is not exactly the best reflection of your family's \r\ncharacter. ",
        "Gus: You know something? Phillip tried to bribe my sister and threaten my \r\nsister the day before the arbitration meeting. ",
        "Harley: Um-hmm. ",
        "Gardner: Do you have any proof of that? Anything written down, recorded? ",
        "Harley: No, but he gave her a big, fat check, which she unfortunately tore \r\nup. ",
        "Gus: You know, I think there's something that's like a major point that we're \r\nforgetting here, and I think you would be able to use it in court. ",
        "Gardner: Such as? ",
        "Gus: Well, Mr. Gardner, there wouldn't be an arbitrator, there wouldn't be a \r\ncase, there wouldn't be a gripe against me, unless Phillip hadn't gotten into my \r\njuvenile file that was supposed to be sealed in the first place. ",
        "Harley: Exactly. ",
        "Gardner: Are you saying that he obtained those records illegally? ",
        "Harley: No, no. He didn't, his father did, but I know that Phillip read them. \r\nI know he did. ",
        "Gus: Phillip is the one who broke the law. You see, he broke the law, so why \r\ndon't you just, like, work that angle? ",
        "Harley: Um-hmm. ",
        "Gardner: Well, even if I did, a separate issue, and one with no real baring \r\non whether your son is at risk in this home. ",
        "Harley: Okay, then why don't we talk about something that would have bearing.\r\n",
        "Gardner: Detective Aitoro's sister. ",
        "Harley: Eden. ",
        "Gardner: Yes. If she were to swear that her earlier testimony were false, \r\neven coerced, it could very well decide this case in your favor. ",
        "Harley: Hmm. Then we are right back at the beginning. ",
        "Gardner: I take it that your sister is something less than cooperative. ",
        "Gus: Mr. Gardner, do you really think that... I mean, are you saying that my \r\nsister is the key to this whole deal? ",
        "Gardner: At this point, yes. ",
        "Gus: Well, then, she's going to damn well be cooperative. Honey, I\u2019ll be \r\nback, all right? It's nice to meet you, sir. ",
        "Harley: You know what? This is so unfair, because I have to justify my \r\nworthiness as a mother over and over again. How come Phillip never has to answer \r\nfor his personal life? ",
        "Gardner: He should, and please, if there are any improprieties that you're \r\naware of, this is definitely the time to bring them up. Is something wrong? ",
        "Harley: I just always swore that I would never try to get my son back by \r\nsmearing his father's name. I feel like I'm stooping to the dirty tricks that \r\nPhillip uses. ",
        "Gardner: You're going to need every weapon that you can get your hands on.\r\n",
        "",
        "Michelle: I knew it was a mistake wearing this sexy robe and my come-hither \r\nslippers. I knew it. I said to myself I said \"Michelle, you know you're going to \r\ngive this poor guy mixed signals,\" and that's obviously what happened. ",
        "Bill: You are way too much. ",
        "Michelle: On top of packing the wrong loungewear? ",
        "Bill: You didn't do anything wrong and that's part of what's driving me \r\ncrazy. I think you're perfect. ",
        "Michelle: Ha, ha, ha, ha. ",
        "Bill: No you are, you are perfect to me. You always have been. Does it make \r\nyou uncomfortable to hear me say how much I care about you? ",
        "Michelle: It makes me a little nervous. ",
        "Bill: Well, you'd better get over that. And it will be a little easier if I \r\nback off, and that's why I\u2019m leaving. ",
        "Michelle: Okay, backing off is one thing and taking off is another. All I \r\nasked is that we don't make any decisions right now. If I thought that was going \r\nto make you uncomfortable, I would never have come up here. ",
        "Bill: And I realize that. Is the best thing to do especially when... ",
        "Michelle: I'm not over Danny. ",
        "Bill: You need time to figure out what you want. ",
        "Michelle: But you're saying that you're ready to dive into things right now.\r\n",
        "Bill: Michelle, I\u2019m more than ready. I didn't even sleep last night knowing \r\nthat your bed was 15 feet away from mine. I just kept thinking about kicking \r\nopen your bedroom door and flying across the room to you. ",
        "Michelle: That would have been quite a wake-up call. ",
        "Bill: All I could think about was all I wanted was to make love to you. And \r\nit's still on my mind. So I... I better get going. ",
        "",
        "Cassie: You know, that's the kind of thinking that you've been trying to put \r\nbehind you. And beating the hell out of Bill Lewis isn't going to fix things \r\nwith you and Michelle. ",
        "Danny: Well, it would make me feel better. ",
        "Cassie: Why don't you sit down for a minute. Please. When you were making all \r\nthese changes for Robbie and Michelle, did you ever stop once to consider if any \r\nof this was good for you? ",
        "Danny: Well, what good is it for me if I can't share it with Michelle? We \r\nwere always a team. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, teams get broken. ",
        "Danny: Tell me about it. ",
        "Cassie: But it will get easier, I can tell you that. ",
        "Danny: Is it easier for you? ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it is. But, you know, we're not talking about me. You are the \r\none that is so angry you want to break someone's neck. ",
        "Danny: Hey, I\u2019ve seen you that way, Cassie. ",
        "Cassie: How's coffee? ",
        "Danny: Uh-huh. I mean, how do you do it? ",
        "Cassie: How do I do what? ",
        "Danny: Well, you have a smile on your face day after day, you're able to walk \r\ninto the lobby of your hotel, offering coffee to your guests, offering advice. \r\nYou of all people know what it's like to lose a person you love. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I do. And the difference between us is my husband is dead and \r\nyour wife is still alive. And she's not out of reach. And if you are so lonely \r\nwithout her, if you want her back in your life, then you have to figure out a \r\nway to get her back. Danny, if you want to reconnect with Michelle then you've \r\ngot to make that the most important thing. Everything else is going to fall into \r\nplace. Unless it's too much work. ",
        "Danny: No, but maybe, you know, I've thought about this all night, maybe \r\nMichelle\u2019s better off with somebody like Bill Lewis, somebody who's got a more \r\nnormal family and no personal baggage. A real hero who can swoop in at the last \r\nmoment, save the day, and be rewarded with a nice candlelight dinner. ",
        "Cassie: You don't believe that. ",
        "Danny: What the hell, maybe Michelle deserves a shot at a nice, safe life for \r\nonce. ",
        "Cassie: And you have everything it takes to give her that. ",
        "Danny: Tell that to Michelle. ",
        "Cassie: I'm telling you what I see. I see a man who cares, I see a man with a \r\nheart. You showed that to me when I came to you asking for money so I could pay \r\nRichard\u2019s hospital bills. ",
        "Danny: I turned you down. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, at first. But then you came through. And then when I couldn't \r\ncome up with the money to pay my debt, you protected me. And you know what? Then \r\nthere was that horrible night when I was so desperate for money that I was \r\nwilling to strip. And instead of letting me, you protected me from myself. And \r\nyou proved you were a hero, at least to me. ",
        "",
        "Gus: Hi. ",
        "Eden: Hi. Okay, wait. Before you say anything, I just want to let you know \r\nthat I'm really sorry for running out on you the other day, and I\u2019m so happy you \r\ncalled. ",
        "Gus: Well, I needed to see you. ",
        "Eden: I love it when you say that. ",
        "Gus: I don't know if you're going to like the rest. We... We finally got a \r\ncourt date on Zach's custody hearing and we need you to testify. ",
        "Eden: We? ",
        "Gus: Yeah, we. This is Harley's shot at getting her child back, okay, so it's \r\ncrunch time. I'm going to need you to go into that courtroom and tell the truth \r\nabout what happened on the roof that night, and you can leave out all the bogus \r\ngarbage about our father. Just, you know, stick to the facts. ",
        "Eden: Wow. Okay, you come in here, I apologize, and then you go right into \r\npoor Harley and then you assume that I'm lying about our father, and now you're \r\npressuring me to testify? I mean, all before I\u2019ve even had coffee. ",
        "Gus: I've already had my morning coffee, thank you. ",
        "Eden: All right, well, this is where I get up and I say \"see you.\" ",
        "Gus I\u2019m not playing anymore. Okay, there's no time for it. So you're going to \r\ngo into that courtroom and say what needs to be said. ",
        "Eden: No. ",
        "Gus: Eden, this is your last chance, okay? Either you do this thing, you \r\ntestify, you do the right thing, or you don't have a brother anymore. ",
        "",
        "Michelle: Bill. ",
        "Bill: No, look, Michelle, I should go. Even though I don't want to. ",
        "Michelle: Well, I don't want you to either. So stay. ",
        "Bill: Let's see, leaving or being tempted beyond endurance. Let me think \r\nabout that one. ",
        "Michelle: Well, if it means I\u2019m going to have to beat you off with a ski \r\npole, then by all means, hit the road. Don't worry about me. Left behind, all \r\nalone. ",
        "Bill: You're going to milk this, aren't you? ",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah, you bet. ",
        "Bill: Well, you know, it probably wouldn't be too cool to leave you to ski \r\nall alone? ",
        "Michelle: I don't mind that. I was just hoping that you'd stay through lunch.\r\n",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah. You do have a way with a sandwich and a cup of soup. ",
        "Michelle: See I was thinking more of the pleasure of beating you down the run \r\nof your choice this morning. ",
        "Bill: Really? ",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Bill: Never going to happen. ",
        "Michelle: In my robes and my slippers I could go faster than you. ",
        "Bill: Oh, see, now I have to stay. Because you just challenged my manhood.\r\n",
        "Michelle: In so many ways. ",
        "Buzz: Oh, finally. ",
        "Frank: Oh, man, I feel like I walked 1,000 miles. ",
        "",
        "Danny: I'm surprised you're bringing that night up. ",
        "Cassie: It meant a lot to me. ",
        "Danny: Yeah, I try not to think about that. It was hard to see you in that \r\nway begging for money. You really shouldn't have had to do something so \r\ndegrading. ",
        "Cassie: Did I mention how desperate I was? ",
        "Danny: Yep. ",
        "Cassie: You were a hero. You were. I was in a really bad place and you got me \r\nout of it. Gently, kindly. Then you took your coat off and you put it over my \r\nshoulders with respect, and you weren't disgusted. You were wonderful. ",
        "Danny: Well, just so you know, I do not judge you for what you did. You had a \r\nfamily to take care of and I understand that. ",
        "Cassie: Well, just so you know, I don't judge you. I do know what it's like \r\nto lose the person that you think you're going to be with forever, and to feel \r\nlike you have nothing. It's horrible, and I\u2019m sorry. ",
        "Danny: Well, thank you. I thought that I would spend the rest of my life with \r\nMichelle. I just don't know what happens next, except that I've got some work to \r\ndo. I'm going to head over to my club and I\u2019ve got to get some measurements to \r\nmy architect. And thank you for the coffee. The next one's on me. ",
        "",
        "Eden: Okay, let's say I do testify, and then when the lawyers ask me why I \r\npushed Federico off the roof and I tell them it's because I was trying to stop \r\nhim from turning in our crooked father. Because that is why I did it, Nicky. And \r\nthen it will be in all the papers, because any case having to do with the \r\nSpaulding's is going to be news. And then our secret is going to be out. ",
        "Gus: Listen to me. You don't have to say a word about our father. It's never \r\ngoing to come up if our lawyer plays it straight. ",
        "Eden: I can't take that chance. Do you think all these years I\u2019ve been \r\ncovering this because it's been fun or easy? No, I was trying to protect you and \r\nI was trying to protect both of us. And now you want me to just trash our family \r\nname in one sitting. ",
        "Gus: Eden, I just want you to do the right thing. ",
        "Eden: Yeah, for your girlfriend, because she can't stand up to her ex. ",
        "Gus: Look, this is the way that Harley is dealing with Phillip, okay, with a \r\ncourt case and with my help. And as far as our family name goes, you and me, \r\nwe're the only ones that have to deal with whether our father did something or \r\ndidn't do something, that's on us. That's not on Harley or... That's our \r\nproblem, okay? I'm worried about them. ",
        "Eden: When are you ever going to start worrying about me? ",
        "Gus: Well, at the rate you're going, never. ",
        "Eden: Yeah, unless I testify and sing like a bird. ",
        "Gus: Look at me, look at me. You do this thing, you testify, you do the right \r\nthing or I'm going to cut you loose, I swear to God. It's that important to me.\r\n",
        "Eden: Nicky, I can\u2019t. ",
        "Gus: All right. ",
        "Eden: No, can't you understand that? ",
        "Gus: Just take care of yourself, okay? Take care of yourself. ",
        "Eden: Look, I am the only family you've got. We'll make up again, we always \r\ndo. ",

        "Buzz: And, gee, when was the last time I hiked umpteen miles in arctic \r\nconditions? ",
        "Frank: You know, I think I've got a blister here the size of Rhode Island.\r\n",
        "Bill: New boots, old car battery, that's a bad combo. How are you holding up?\r\n",
        "Ben: Fine. ",
        "Marina: Thank you. ",
        "Michelle: Are you all right? ",

        "Bill: What other kids? ",
        "Frank: Well, you know, the kids from Ben\u2019s fraternity... I mean, this is a \r\nskiathon weekend right? ",
        "Buzz: And where are all the famous chaperones? ",
        "Marina: Ah... ",

        "Michelle: Not the ski trip you expected, huh? ",
        "Marina: Well, let's see, I spent the night in a freezing cold car with my \r\nfather and my grandfather instead of... ",
        "Michelle: With Ben in bed? ",
        "Marina: I'm ready, Michelle and I'm prepared. Ben is, he's finally starting \r\nto look at me like I'm actually a real person, you know, not just some little \r\nhigh school kid and it's like when his car broke down he was so sweet to me and \r\nhe was so into me until the Cooper trooper showed up and they read us the usual \r\njail bait riot act. How is he ever supposed to take me seriously when all he \r\nkeeps hearing is that he's robbing the cradle? ",
        "Michelle: Well, you aren't exactly 18. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, well I'm old enough to see a gynecologist right? I'm old enough \r\nto take responsibility for myself. ",
        "Michelle: Yes, yes you are, but it shouldn't take having sex with a guy to \r\nhave him take you seriously. ",
        "Marina: Well, it couldn't hurt. ",
        "Michelle: Wrong. Marina, has Ben been pressuring you in any way? ",
        "Marina: No, no. No, he's been totally cool. ",
        "Michelle: Then how do you know this is what he wants? ",
        "Marina: Well, this isn't the 1950\u2019s, is it? I mean why else do you think a \r\nguy invites a girl to come to a ski cabin with him for the weekend? ",
        "Michelle: Well, he invited Bill up here, too. ",
        "Marina: Guys want sex. Everybody knows that, especially them. ",
        "Michelle: So if Frank and Buzz hadn't caught up with you guys, you guys would \r\nhave been here last night and you would have slept together? ",
        "Marina: Yeah, we'd probably still be in there. ",
        "Michelle: I know you say you're ready for this, but you have to be sure that \r\nthis is right. ",
        "Marina: Well, I don't want to lose the guy. ",
        "Michelle: What do you mean, if you waited? Why would that happen? ",
        "Marina: Well, like this girl in my math class didn't sleep with her boyfriend \r\nand he broke up with her like that night, and I don't even blame him. ",
        "Michelle: And that's okay with you? Marina, do you know what a real \r\nrelationship is? It's a connection between a man and a woman that's based on \r\nrespect and trust and humor and honesty. When a guy knows what you're going to \r\nsay before you do. Or when he grabs onto your hand because he knows you need \r\ncontact, not words. You know, that's what a real-- that's when it's real. And \r\nguess what? That's when the sex will be real, too. ",
        "Marina: Oh, I don't know. I used to buy all that wait until it's right stuff, \r\nbut I just don't believe that any more, you know I don't think there's this \r\nmoment when you suddenly realize it's right. That's just not the way things are \r\nin the real world, you know. ",
        "Michelle: No, okay. Well, Marina, if Ben wanted sex, if that's all he wanted, \r\nhe could get it every night of the week at the university, but he's here with \r\nyou because he likes you. I mean, you can see it all over his face, and this is \r\ncoming from a guy who doesn't like to show what he's feeling. If anything, I \r\nthink rushing into sex with him too soon might change that. ",
        "Marina: Why are you trying to scare me? ",
        "Michelle: I'm not. I just don't want you to make a mistake that you can't \r\nundo. ",
        "Marina: Haven't you ever made a mistake before? ",
        "Michelle: That's why I know what I\u2019m talking about. ",
        "Marina: So, what if you're making a mistake now? ",
        "Michelle: What do you mean? ",
        "Marina: With Bill. What if you're making a mistake with him? What if he's not \r\nokay with waiting until you're totally cool with everything? And even if he is, \r\nhow do you know how happy he is about it? ",
        "Michelle: Good point. ",

        "Bill: You're not going skiing like that, are you? ",
        "Michelle: No, I\u2019m not. You were right. I don't think it's a good idea for us \r\nto be maybe in such close quarters right now. So, I'm going to go home. ",
        "Frank: So Marina, Ben tells us there's some misunderstanding about the \r\nchaperones in the skiathon. ",
        "Buzz: Yes, and it was all made up by you. ",
        "Marina: Oh, no. I think I just got the weekends mixed up. Nice try. Let's go.\r\n",
        "Ben: Where? ",
        "Buzz: Well, you can go wherever you want to, but the Cooper\u2019s, they're going \r\nto Springfield. ",
        "Marina: But we just got here. ",

        "Buzz: Ben! Not now. ",
        "Marina: Why can't we just stay here? I mean, I know there may not be, like, \r\nofficial chaperones or anything, but Bill and Michelle are here to make sure \r\neverything's cool. ",
        "Frank: Really, just the four of you? Oh, how nice and cozy. I don't think so. \r\nGet your coat. ",

        "Gus: Why, why? ",
