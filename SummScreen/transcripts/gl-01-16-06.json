        "Jonathan: Hey. Did you get back to Reva's yet?",
        "Tammy: Actually, I'm downtown. Marina wanted me to meet her for hot chocolate.",
        "Jonathan: Damn. You guys really know how to tear it up.",
        "Tammy: We'll go light on the marshmallows. Anyway, I think I have to go to the Beacon. I'm pretty sure I left my scarf there.",
        "Jonathan: I can get it.",
        "Tammy: What if my mom and Jeffrey are still there?",
        "Jonathan: I wouldn't worry about that.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: I had a really good time tonight. It was so amazing to just be out in the world with you even if...",
        "Jonathan: I know.",
        "Tammy: I love you.",
        "Jonathan: I love you, too, Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: So, are you and Sandy back together?",
        "Tammy: Eavesdrop much?",
        "Lizzie: No, I was actually just looking for Coop, but I couldn't help but be distracted by the huge grin on your face. That means Ava's out of the picture, huh?",
        "Tammy: Oh. It wasn't Sandy.",
        "Lizzie: Well, who was it?",
        "Tammy: Jonathan.",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan's your cousin.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Ew! Ew! I mean, oh!",

        "Josh: There you go.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Josh: No, thank you. This is nice.",
        "Olivia: It is nice. And it's a date?",
        "Josh: Yes, it's a date. You want me to draw you a diagram of a date?",
        "Olivia: No, no, no. It's okay, no. It's just that, you know, a little advance warning next time might be nice.",
        "Josh: What's wrong with a little spontaneity?",
        "Olivia: Absolutely nothing. It's just that, you know, a girl likes a little time to make herself presentable.",
        "Josh: Yeah, it's funny you say that. I was just thinking how you don't look presentable at all right now. You look, you know, beautiful, and I know you're smart and sexy and all those things, but you know presentable.",
        "Olivia: So you're okay with this. You're okay with our date?",
        "Josh: Yes, ma'am. I am most definitely okay with our date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I don't know what that's like? I don't know what that feels like to walk around half alive, because you need somebody so bad that you're numb and you want them and you need them? And you just want to breathe them in, but you can't because you're numb and you're shut down. You've got so much pain inside of you, you're just afraid you're going split open and you're not even going to make it until tomorrow. I don't know what that's like? I don't know what that feels like? I do, because that's how I feel about you, okay?",
        "Harley: You don't mean that.",
        "Mallet: I do mean that. And I'm sorry you don't want to hear that.",
        "Harley: I don't. Just keep it to yourself.",
        "Mallet: I would do anything for you. Do you understand that?",
        "Harley: Because we're friends. Because we're really good friends.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, sure.",
        "Harley: Don't say anything else, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: You know what I'm saying. And don't pretend like you don't know what I'm saying. And don't act like I don't know what it feels like to lose somebody. And don't act like I don't know what it feels like to get lost because of that.",
        "Harley: We're looking for my husband...",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I know that. I know that. But everything inside of me just wants to take you inside my arms. I just want to make it better. That's all. I think I could make it better.",
        "Harley: I love Gus.",
        "Mallet: That's not what this is about.",
        "Harley: I can't do this. I can't do this. Listen to me when I say this. There is no you and me here, okay? I am married.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I know that. I know that. But where is this guy? Where's this great guy that had everything and threw it away?",
        "Harley: He was trying to protect me; that's what this was.",
        "Mallet: Is that working out for you? How is that working out?",
        "Harley: Why are you doing this? Why? Why now? Why are we doing this now?",
        "Mallet: Because I hate seeing you in so much pain.",
        "Harley: I'll be better once...",
        "Frank: Sis?",
        "Harley: ...We find Gus.",
        "Mallet: Frank.",
        "Frank: What's the matter?",
        "Harley: No, it's okay. I...",
        "Frank: You hurt your leg? How did you hurt your leg?",
        "Harley: It's fine. I fell. It's fine. It doesn't matter.",
        "Frank: Ed, this is my sister, Harley Cooper.",
        "Ed: Miss Cooper.",
        "Harley: It's Aitoro. I'm Mrs. Aitoro. Who are you?",
        "Ed: Agent Fox, Federal Bureau of Investigation.",
        "Harley: Thank God. The F.B.I. Finally. I want to get you guys up to speed on this.",
        "Frank: No, no, you can't go. He actually needs to check out the car on his own.",
        "Harley: Okay. I was just going to show him, that's all. They found this guy who had all of Gus's stuff on him, and he made up this stupid story about how he found Gus and Alan in the limousine, and they were...",
        "Frank: I know, sis, I heard.",
        "Harley: Don't look at me. Like that. He is not dead, okay? Gus is not dead. We're going to check out the car again, and then we're going to talking about canvassing the area and sending out search teams. Because we've got to find these guys, because it's only getting colder out there. And if they get caught in the snow, Frank... what is this guy's name, Fox? Fox.",
        "Frank: This is agent Fox's investigation. He's got a lot of questions for you. You cannot be a part of this, sis. That's why they need you out of here now.",

        "Coop: Your room is ready if you want to take a look.",
        "Ava: You cleaned the room for me?",
        "Coop: Don't get crazy, okay? I just happened to straighten...",
        "Ava: Whatever. That was so sweet. Thank you.",
        "Coop: It's all part of the job. I will say, though, that it is a little bit bare.",
        "Ava: What do you mean by that?",
        "Coop: There's no lamp in there, and there's no side table next to the bed. But I do have a box downstairs full of all sorts of old stuff that you can go through if you want to later on.",
        "Ava: Sure, I would love that. But why is everything downstairs?",
        "Coop: Well, Lizzie didn't like it, for one thing. All of the rooms were a little too eclectic for her. Anyways, look, how about I help you with your things?",
        "Ava: Oh, no, thanks. I just have those two bags by the door and a box of books in the car.",
        "Coop: That's it?",
        "Ava: Yeah. I'm low maintenance.",
        "Coop: Yeah? No kidding. No kidding. I remember Lizzie had so many shoes it could fill up an entire room. I even remember how she had the boxes labeled. It was like evening shoes in one box, and another box said \"casual evening shoes.\" And a third box even said \"casual evening event shoes.\" It was crazy.",
        "Ava: Is your dad okay?",
        "Coop: I don't know. I'll find out. Pops, who was that?",
        "Buzz: Nobody.",
        "Coop: Yeah, right. Was that about Gus?",
        "Buzz: They found Alan's limo wrecked. Frank's there.",
        "Coop: Are Gus and Alan...",
        "Buzz: No, they weren't in it.",
        "Coop: What happened?",
        "Buzz: Nobody knows.",

        "Harley: I'm Gus's wife. I used to be a cop.",
        "Frank: Two very good reasons for you not to be here. Sis, you're too close to this.",
        "Harley: I can help them.",
        "Frank: You are way too close to this. Let him do his job.",

        "Marina: Lizzie, Tammy knows what she's doing.",
        "Tammy: That's okay. I've heard it all before. Just say what you think, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: No. Evidently it doesn't matter.",
        "Tammy: Well, no, it doesn't. But, hey, I can take the brutal honesty, so come on, hit me.",
        "Marina: You know, Tammy, I think Lizzie was just surprised before. Right?",
        "Lizzie: Tammy and Jonathan are cousins.",
        "Tammy: Thank you. I almost forgot.",
        "Marina: Who cares?",
        "Lizzie: Would you quit acting like that's normal?",
        "Marina: Okay, Lizzie, nothing in life is normal.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy and Jonathan?",
        "Marina: Tammy is happy, okay? How can you argue that?",
        "Lizzie: How about the fact that it's gross?",
        "Tammy: Interesting. Aren't you the person that told me if I liked Jonathan to go for it?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I told you not to abandon him as a friend, but not fall in love with him.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry, Lizzie, what exactly was your purpose here? I mean, besides to pass judgement.",
        "Lizzie: I was looking for Coop.",
        "Marina: Well, Coop's over at Company helping Ava get settled.",
        "Lizzie: Oh.",
        "Marina: So if you don't mind...",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, sure.",
        "Tammy: No, it's okay. I don't care what people think anymore. I don't.",

        "Josh: This is nice.",
        "Olivia: This is good, isn't it?",
        "Josh: Should we get a bottle, do you think?",
        "Olivia: Oh, most definitely. But maybe we should order something to eat.",
        "Josh: We can do that if we want because we have all night.",
        "Olivia: We do?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Great.",
        "Josh: You know, it's been a long time since I've been out for a night of fun.",
        "Olivia: You and me both.",
        "Josh: In fact, it's been a long time since I've had any fun of any kind.",
        "Olivia: Oh. It must have been hard to tell the kids about you and Reva?",
        "Josh: Yes, it was. And there's this thing going on with Cassie, too.",
        "Olivia: I thought you were going to let that go because she is happy.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but I can't help but feel that that is going to end.",
        "Olivia: Why would it end, Josh?",
        "Josh: Because it's built on a lie. You and I both know how lies can destroy a relationship, right?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. I thought we were both talking about Jeffrey and Cassie.",
        "Josh: Sorry.",
        "Olivia: No, because you are right, absolutely right. But, still, I thought you were going to back off from all of this.",
        "Josh: I was. I am. Cassie chose not to look at the information that I had, and that was her choice to make, but...",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but what?",
        "Josh: Every time I see Cassie and Jeffrey together, I can't help but think if this information, this connection between Richard and Jeffrey-- whatever it was-- if comes out, she's going to get hurt.",

        "Jonathan: Hey, you read my mind. Here. Here you go. You keep the change.",
        "Waitress: Sir, I was taking that upstairs.",
        "Jonathan: I'm Cassie Winslow's nephew, so get another bottle. Hey, hey. Come here. I have another favor to ask. I was walking into the garage, and I saw this black S.U.V. With its lights on, and the license plate said \"Lewis 1.\" And isn't that Josh Lewis over there? So that's probably his.",
        "Waitress: I'll tell him.",
        "Jonathan: Thank you.",
        "Waitress: Mr. Lewis, is your black S.U.V. Parked in the garage?",
        "Josh: It's a hybrid. It is. Why, is there a problem?",
        "Waitress: Well, someone reported that the lights are on.",
        "Josh: Oh. Okay. Well, thank you very much. I'll be right back.",
        "Jonathan: Hello, Auntie O. Time for a refill?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Sit, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, no. I don't want to ruin Marina's night.",
        "Marina: Oh, please, Lizzie, won't you? The more the merrier. So, anyway, you were out with Jonathan tonight?",
        "Tammy: At the Beacon. My mom and Jeffrey were there, too.",
        "Lizzie: What does your mom say about the two of you?",
        "Tammy: Well, she doesn't approve. Most people don't.",
        "Marina: Well, who cares about most people?",
        "Lizzie: So what's it like to be with Jonathan? I mean he is so like not Sandy.",
        "Marina: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I mean, it's true, he's not.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan is amazing. All I can say is, you know, I just wish everyone else could see what I could see. Even he doesn't get it. He doesn't know how incredible he is.",
        "Lizzie: You really do love him?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I do. He's doing everything to make sure that I'm okay and to make sure everything is okay with my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: That's a good year.",
        "Olivia: I'm hoping it's going to be.",
        "Jonathan: So where's your boss?",
        "Olivia: My date has gone to turn his car lights off.",
        "Jonathan: Date?",
        "Olivia: You're not going to go run and tell your mommy?",
        "Jonathan: Why would I do that? My mommy? I don't care, you like him, he likes you. You guys be happy, that's what I say. If he doesn't want to be in Reva's life, I don't want him there anyway. ( Laughter )",
        "Olivia: Thank you!",
        "Jonathan: You're welcome. My support comes with a price, though.",
        "Olivia: Of course it does.",
        "Jonathan: Don't get your panties all in a knot over there. A little more of the same is what I'm asking for.",
        "Olivia: The same what?",
        "Jonathan: Support. Tammy and me. People want to burn us at the stake. People want to burn me at the stake.",
        "Olivia: Hey, who am I to judge?",
        "Jonathan: I knew I could count on you. To acceptance.",
        "Olivia: To acceptance. Acceptance.",
        "Jonathan: Acceptance. Too bad Cassie's not more like you.",
        "Olivia: She still giving you a hard time?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-huh. If it was up to her, I would go away for the rest of my life, and she has the D.A. on her side.",
        "Olivia: Sorry to hear that.",
        "Jonathan: It's all right, I'm use to it. Besides, Cassie doesn't have the greatest taste in men anyway, does she?",
        "Olivia: Judging by her last two choices, I'd have to agree with you.",
        "Jonathan: Wait a second. I mean, I know Uncle Eddie was a loser, but isn't Jeffrey a good guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I'd be lying if I said I'm not scared. I just don't know what I would do without him.",
        "Marina: People were afraid and against Danny and I.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, and Coop and me, too.",
        "Marina: Yeah, some people still aren't with that.",
        "Lizzie: Anyway, we know what the feeling feels like, don't we? We'd do anything to be with them no matter what our grandfather says.",
        "Marina: Or our dad.",
        "Tammy: Or my mom. Yeah, anything, because if I didn't have Jonathan, I don't know what my life would be about.",
        "Marina: I know the feeling.",
        "Lizzie: Maybe you'll know it again one day, Marina. I know you've just made so many bad choices.",
        "Marina: I'm seeing Alan- Michael.",
        "Lizzie: You are so not!",
        "Marina: Yes, I am.",
        "Lizzie: He's old enough to be your... I mean, he's older than you.",
        "Marina: And he's your uncle.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my gosh. My grandfather's going to flip.",
        "Tammy: So, you like him?",
        "Marina: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God.",
        "Marina: I mean, I don't know. It's not anything serious. Lizzie. And even if it were...",
        "Lizzie: I know, I know. It's none of my business.",
        "Marina: I could be your aunt.",
        "Tammy: To the wrong guy.",
        "Lizzie: To the wrong guy.",

The right guy for Dinah, that's like the million-dollar question: I think it's definitely Mallet. Why? Because Mallet is probably one of the first emotionally available men she has ever run into.

        "Frank: Because the feds are on top of their game. They have more resources than we do. And, besides, anyway, it's out of our jurisdiction now. What?",
        "Mallet: Then I'll have to do it as a civilian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Hey, how are you, fella?",
        "Coop: I've had better days. What do you want?",

        "Coop: Whatever, okay. I'll just go check on that for you.",
        "Quinn: Listen, I thought Lizzie might be here.",
        "Coop: No, she's not. But I will tell her you said hello.",

        "Lizzie: With any luck.",
        "Tammy: Talk about keeping it in the family.",
        "Marina: This town is too small.",
        "Lizzie: Talk about undervalued real estate market. That's my big news. I just got my own place, and I got it for a steal.",
        "Marina: I already knew that.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, well, Tammy didn't.",
        "Tammy: Well, that's great, Lizzie. You must be doing really well.",
        "Lizzie: I know. Even better, I'm going to ask Coop to move in with me. ( Cell phone rings ) Oh. I should get that. Just one second. Hey. Yeah, I was just talking about you, sort of.",
        "Quinn: Great. Lizzie, I need to see you right now.",
        "Lizzie: I'm with friends.",
        "Quinn: I don't care. Say bye-bye.",

        "Quinn: Yeah, I just don't see our arrangement going any farther.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, stay right where you are. I'll be right there, okay? Where are you?",
        "Quinn: This charming little family place called Company.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, good, I was on my way there anyway. Okay, see you in a few.",
        "Quinn: Super. See you then.",
        "Lizzie: Hey. I loved this. We'll have to do this again some other time. I've had a lot of fun, but I've got to go. Bye. Bye. See ya.",
        "Marina: Okay, so what was that about?",
        "Tammy: Who knows?",
        "Marina: Well, I guess she kind of behaved herself tonight.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, she can. I guess that's why I never completely wrote her off.",
        "Marina: Lizzie could be my aunt. Oh, my gosh. You want another hot chocolate or a drink?",
        "Tammy: Actually, I need to go back to Reva's.",
        "Marina: It sucks not getting along with your mom.",
        "Tammy: Yeah it does, but she'll come around. Jonathan will win her over somehow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Let's talk about happy things.",
        "Jonathan: Happy things. D.A. O'Neill is about to send me up the river because of an accident.",
        "Olivia: Not if he gets knocked down a peg or two first.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I'd like to knock him down a peg, but how am I supposed to...",
        "Olivia: Not you. Josh.",
        "Jonathan: Josh? What, did Josh get something on O'Neill?",
        "Olivia: He might have.",
        "Jonathan: Come on, you can't leave me hanging here. What is it?",
        "Olivia: Josh got a tip and I helped him investigate Jeffrey.",
        "Jonathan: Go, Joshua. But, what, it didn't turn up anything because Cassie and Jeff are still tight.",
        "Olivia: Cassie doesn't know that Richard and Jeffrey are...",
        "Jonathan: Richard and Jeffrey are what? ( Laughter )",
        "Olivia: Haven't you ever thought it odd that Jeffrey is Richard's exact double?",
        "Josh: Well, that was a complete waste of time. Hello, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Hello, Joshua!",
        "Josh: What are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: I'm having a drink with my favorite aunt.",

        "Olivia: Don't you have somewhere else to be?",
        "Jonathan: Nope. I can stay and have a drink with you guys. What are we having?",
        "Josh: Actually, you'll have to excuse us because you have to come with me right now. The moon over the lake is just perfect, pristine. Come on. Just a few minutes.",
        "Jonathan: You kids have fun. I'll be here when you get back.",
        "Josh: Please don't be.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: No, it's okay. I'm on my way home anyway. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Tammy: That didn't sound good.",
        "Marina: Still no Alan and no Gus.",
        "Tammy: What do you think happened to them?",
        "Marina: I don't know. But it doesn't look good.",
        "Tammy: I'm so sorry. Please tell Harley I'm thinking about her.",
        "Marina: I will. And don't give up on your mom.",
        "Tammy: I won't.",
        "Marina: Jonathan is a lucky guy. I hope he realizes that.",
        "Tammy: We're both lucky. It's a whole new world.",
        "Marina: I just don't want you to change because of him.",
        "Tammy: Changing in a good way, Marina. So is Jonathan. That's the amazing thing. No matter how tough things are, it's going to get better. Everything will be okay. I know it.",
        "Marina: I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Hey, I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but do you think we can talk out in the car?",
        "Quinn: So Coop can't hear us?",
        "Lizzie: Coop's in there?",
        "Quinn: You know he is. Well, I'm not naked this time. Unfortunately. Listen, I've given you a lot, and yet you treat me like a pariah. Why is that?",
        "Lizzie: You're just angry about the other night.",
        "Quinn: No, but our scheduling conflict made me reconsider our arrangement.",
        "Lizzie: You can't do this to me. I'll do what I need to keep it.",
        "Quinn: Well-done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Can I get you something to drink?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Frank: You want to take a leave of absence from the force for how long?",
        "Mallet: As long as it takes, Frank. So come on, what do you say do I get the time?",
        "Frank: Is this your way of getting back into Harley's life.",
        "Mallet: Hey, buddy, my partner's missing, okay?",
        "Frank: You mean Harley's husband.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, that's right. Do you think she's going to back off? She's over there plotting her next move, Frank.",
        "Frank: Don't worry about her. I'm going to keep an eye on her.",
        "Mallet: When are you going to do that? Just give me the time and I'll make sure she doesn't do something that gets herself hurt.",
        "Frank: You say this is all about Gus but I know you better than that. And I do not want my sister's life getting any more complicated...",
        "Mallet: Then I'll just resign Frank, how about that?",
        "Frank: You're going to resign? You don't even know if Gus is dead or alive.",
        "Harley: Of course he's alive, Frank. He's alive!",
        "Frank: Sis, I...",
        "Harley: Do you all hear me? My husband is alive!",
        "Frank: We're not giving up hope. We just want to be prepared.",
        "Harley: Well, be prepared, then. Be prepared for Gus to walk through the door, because he will. He will, Frank.",
        "Frank: I am always here for you.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You've done a lot for me. But you can't do this right now. We had a deal.",
        "Quinn: Deals are broken every day. You've been around business enough. You should know that.",
        "Lizzie: So this is just a business deal for you, because it's not for me.",
        "Quinn: I would like to think it isn't, but I don't like being treated so insignificantly.",
        "Lizzie: You mean a lot to me. You saved me from all of this, and you've been my hero.",
        "Quinn: ( Laughing ) So you say.",
        "Lizzie: But you don't believe me?",

        "Olivia: You think you're that good, huh?",
        "Josh: Are you telling me I'm not?",
        "Olivia: No, no. But what about Reva?",
        "Josh: Not everything is about Reva.",
        "Olivia: Try telling her that. I would love to, but... not tonight.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: No, no.",
        "Olivia: It's just too soon for both of us. I'm loving what's happening here, so I don't want to blow it.",

        "Tammy: Are you on your way?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, there's just something I've got to take care of first.",
        "Tammy: That sounds a little ominous.",
        "Jonathan: No, it's nothing like that.",

        "Jonathan: Yeah. Hey, you know I would do anything to protect us, right?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Why are you...",
        "Jonathan: I love you, and you be careful getting home. Knock, knock, Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I'm waiting for an answer, Frank.",
        "Frank: Look, you can help Harley out. Just be careful.",
        "Mallet: Will do.",
        "Frank: You just make sure that you look out for my sister.",
        "Mallet: You know I will.",
        "Gus: Thanks, babe, for keeping the faith. That's what's going to bring me home.",
        "Harley: Sometimes I feel like you're so close. You know, like if I just look behind a tree, you'll be there.",
        "Gus: Well, I am close.",
        "Harley: But other times I feel like you're far away. Like you've just fallen off the face of the earth.",
        "Gus: Honestly, do you think I would do that, just disappear on you? I'm really not that far away.",
        "Harley: Then just come home.",
        "Gus: You just keep the faith, okay? That's what I did when you were locked up.",
        "Harley: I know. It was your faith that kept us going. It was your faith that brought us back together. My family thinks your dead.",
        "Gus: Just don't give up, okay?",
        "Harley: I would never give up on you.",
