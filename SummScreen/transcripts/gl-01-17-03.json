        "Danny: Hi, Grandpa. ",
        "Ed: How are you? ",
        "Danny: Thanks for letting Cassie pick him up earlier. ",
        "Ed: It's no problem. I told you, Danny, I'm not going to do anything to get \r\nbetween you and your son-- as long as you keep him safe. ",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. But you don't mind coming between me and Michelle. By \r\nencouraging her to spend the weekend with Bill. I mean, why stop there, Ed? Why \r\ndon't you just push her into bed with the guy? ",
        "",
        "Beth: Bill, hi. It's Beth. I just wanted to let you know that Danny let us \r\nout of that lease on the loft. So, that's taken care of. Uh... You also left a \r\nfew things there and now I have them here. Whenever you want to pick them up, or \r\nif you want me to drop them off, just... Let me know. Okay. Bye. (knock on door) \r\nHey, you, what a nice surprise. Come on in. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm not interrupting anything, am I? ",
        "Beth: Just me feeling sorry for myself. Come on, make yourself comfortable. \r\nOh, wait a minute. You had that big History exam today, right? How'd that go?\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yeah, fine I guess. ",
        "Beth: Oh, hold that thought. Do you want some tea? I got a tea maker, so I \r\nwouldn't have to keep ordering up from room service. ",
        "Lizzie: Maybe in a minute. I... I kind of need to talk to you about \r\nsomething. ",
        "Beth: All right, what? ",
        "Lizzie: This. ",
        "Beth: \"Alston Academy\"? That's a boarding school in Connecticut, right? ",
        "Lizzie: I want to go there, Mom, as soon as possible. ",
        "",
        "Buzz: I won't ask. ",
        "",
        "Bill: You're really going to head home? ",
        "Michelle: Yeah... Yeah, you know, I think it's best. ",
        "Bill: Did I say something or do something to mess things up... ",
        "Michelle: No, no, no, look, I... I just don't think we're ready to start \r\nanything yet. And, you know, if we do, it's going to be a big deal so I think \r\nthat we shouldn't rush into it. ",
        "Bill: And you're sure that's the only reason why you want to leave? ",
        "Michelle: What other reason would there be? ",
        "Bill: I don't know. I mean, after the way Danny showed up here last night, I \r\nthought maybe... ",
        "Michelle: No, no. I just want to do what's right. ",
        "Bill: Me, too. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Did you hear what your granddaughter just said? She said she's \r\ndetermined to sleep with this guy no matter what. Well, not on my watch you're \r\nnot. Get your coat, get your butt in the car, I\u2019m taking you home, now. ",
        "Marina: No. No, I'm not leaving. ",
        "",
        "Alan: Tell me, have you... Have you seen Olivia? ",
        "Phillip: Why would I? ",
        "Alan: I don't know, I was at the Beacon last night and the idiot behind the \r\ndesk wouldn't even tell me where she was. ",
        "Phillip: Good for him. ",
        "Nolan: Excuse me, sir. A messenger just delivered these two letters. One of \r\nthem is for you, sir, and the other for Mr. Phillip. ",
        "Alan: Well, thank you, Nolan. ",
        "Nolan: You're welcome, sir. ",
        "Alan: They're from Olivia. ",
        "Phillip: She's gone. ",
        "",
        "Frank: Until you turn 18, I\u2019m your legal guardian, not to mention your \r\nfather. So whether you like it or not, I call the shots. ",
        "Marina: Why can't you just trust me? ",
        "Frank: \"Trust you\"? I trust you all the time and what do you do? You go off \r\nand you do something stupid... ",
        "Marina: What... What... What have I done that is so terrible? ",
        "Frank: Are you kidding me? Would you please say something here and help me?\r\n",
        "Buzz: Well, I guess the first thing would be when you ran away from your mom \r\nin L.A. to come here, and then you got involved with that Romeo Jones. I mean... \r\nLet's face it, he's a hood. And then, next thing, you turn up half naked in Gus' \r\nbed so I... ",
        "Frank: Not to mention getting kidnapped from Millennium. And almost getting \r\nkilled. ",
        "Buzz: And there were condoms in the car last night... ",
        "Frank: Condoms? You came up here with condoms? ",
        "Marina: Yeah, haven't you ever heard of safe sex? It's called being \r\nresponsible, Dad. ",
        "Frank: Oh, terrific, terrific. The one thing you shouldn't do, you're \r\nresponsible about. ",
        "Buzz: Well, she's responsible in other things. I mean, work, I mean, she's a \r\nregular trooper in that department. ",
        "Marina: You know what, thank you. ",
        "Buzz: Frank... ",
        "Marina: Thank you. Daddy, and about the condoms... ",
        "Ben: Marina, let it go... ",
        "Marina: You know what, no! I have a point to make here. You're only upset \r\nabout the condoms because I'm a girl. If I were a guy, you would have felt \r\ntotally different about this. You would have been all, like, \"Wink, wink, go for \r\nit, kid.\" ",
        "Frank: No, I wouldn't have. ",
        "Marina: Please, you think I don't know how guys think? ",
        "Frank: I know exactly how guys think. I know how this guy thinks. You've been \r\npressuring her into having sex, haven't you? After I explicitly warned you...\r\n",
        "Ben: No, sir, I haven't. I swear. ",
        "Frank: You swear? You know what, Ben? I'm sorry, I believe you. Just like I \r\nbelieved you about all the chaperones being up here and the ski-a-thon and \r\neverything else... ",
        "Marina: You know what, Daddy, Ben has not been pressuring me, okay? If anyone \r\nhas been doing any pressuring at all, it has been me. Look, I know what you want \r\nfrom me. You want me to work at Company until I meet some nice, young, Greek boy \r\nand I... And I get married and I spend the rest of my life making baklava and \r\nhaving babies! But that is not what I want! ",
        "Frank: What do you want? ",
        "Marina: Well, I want a really great and interesting career. You know, I want \r\nto travel. I want to have fun. There is just so much in this world to feel and \r\nexplore. ",
        "",
        "Bill: All right, I agree with everything that you just said, but I'm afraid I \r\ncan't let you go home. ",
        "Michelle: Why not? ",
        "Bill: Because I offered first, and if anyone leaves, it should be me. ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but you're all psyched about skiing and I want to get home to \r\nRobbie anyway. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I was psyched to go skiing with you-- not Ben and Marina \r\nand the whole Cooper clan. ",
        "Michelle: All right, all right, we'll both leave then. ",
        "Bill: All right. All right, then... Then what? Huh? What happens when we get \r\nback to Springfield? When do I get to see you again? ",
        "Michelle: Hmm, how should we do this? Tonight too soon? ",
        "Bill: Not for me. You? All right, all right, then we're on for tonight. What \r\ndo you want to do? ",
        "Michelle: I don't know. Hang out? ",
        "Bill: No, we can't just hang out? We got to do something special. We got \r\nto... We got to go on a date, like a real date. You know, like you said, we got \r\nto do this right. So, how about I pick you up and I\u2019ll take you to Towers. ",
        "Michelle: You mean, you're going to drive and everything? Do I get a corsage, \r\ntoo? ",
        "Bill: Ah, easy. Should I bring a corsage? Only kidding. How about 7:00? ",
        "Michelle: 7:00's fine. ",
        "Bill: Let's get our stuff. ",
        "Michelle: All right.",
        "",
        "Marina: Why won't you just listen to me? ",
        "Frank: Because you're not telling me anything new. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, how do you know that if you're not listening? ",
        "Michelle: Don't mind us. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, we're just going to grab our stuff. We're heading back to town.\r\n",
        "Ben: Now? ",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I miss Robbie. ",
        "Bill: Yeah, I got a lot of work to do. ",
        "Michelle: But you guys stay, use the cabin. Or not... Or not. But just make \r\nsure you leave the key in the... In the usual spot when you leave, okay? ",
        "Bill: And remember to put out that fire. ",
        "Ben: Thanks. ",
        "Frank: Well, there it is. Bill and Michelle gone; you're going home. ",
        "Marina: What if I say no, what are you going to do? You're going to handcuff \r\nme and drag me out of here? ",
        "Frank: If necessary. ",
        "Marina: Well, you know what, then fine, then fine. Why don't you just go \r\nahead and do it, because that is the only way that I am going! ",
        "Frank: Oh, you're going all right. You're going straight back to your mother.\r\n",
        "",
        "Danny: Michelle and I were working things out. And then Carmen escapes and... \r\nAnd... And goes after Robbie. And Bill shows up at just the right moment and \r\nsaves the day. And suddenly I\u2019m nothing to Michelle? ",
        "Ed: You will never be nothing to her. ",
        "Danny: I mean, doesn't it bother you that Bill has put the moves on Michelle, \r\nright at the moment... At the exact moment when she's scared and vulnerable? ",
        "Ed: What bothers me is that she finds herself in that frightening position to \r\nbegin with, with her son almost being kidnapped by his grandmother. ",
        "Danny: You know I knew... Every bone in my body was telling me to get here \r\nearlier that night. I should have trusted my instincts. ",
        "Ed: Hindsight is 20/20, you know. ",
        "Danny: Ten minutes and I would have been the one. I would have been here to \r\nprotect Michelle. And now... This doesn't make any sense. ",
        "Ed: Danny, what's drawing Michelle and Bill together, it's not any ten \r\nminutes, it's a lifetime of friendship and caring. ",
        "",
        "Alan: Two letters. You're drinking... Or thinking. Interesting set of \r\ncircumstances. I wonder what it all means. ",
        "Phillip: It means this house is bringing out the worst in everyone. ",
        "Alan: Or it could mean much more. ",
        "Phillip: I have something to do. ",
        "Alan: Why don't you use the phone here, Phillip? ",
        "Phillip: What? ",
        "Alan: That's what you're going to do, isn't it? Call Olivia? ",
        "Phillip: Why would you think that? ",
        "Alan: Oh, I don't know. Why would I think anything? Like why would I think \r\nwhile I was in the hospital recovering, that you slept with my wife? ",
        "",
        "Marina: I won't do what you want, now you're just going to wash your hands of \r\nme? That's nice, Daddy, that is really nice. ",
        "Buzz: Your father didn't really mean he was going to send you back to your \r\nmother. ",
        "Frank: Yes, I did. ",
        "Marina: Oh, and you call me immature? ",
        "Frank: Let me make something perfectly clear. I don't want you seeing this \r\nguy. And I especially don't want you sleeping with him. Now, if I have to ship \r\nyou off to Timbuktu to prevent that from happening, that's exactly what I\u2019m \r\ngoing to do. ",
        "Marina: But, Dad, that's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard... ",
        "Frank: You know what, there are no buts here! ",
        "Michelle: Uh, going guys. Good-bye. Enjoy the cabin, okay? ",
        "Ben: I'm sorry, Michelle. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, me, too. ",
        "Michelle: Don't be. I'm not... Not leaving because of this. You know, just do \r\nwhat you got to do. Okay? Bye. ",
        "Bill: Hey, look, I'm going to see her off, and then I'm going to go down to \r\nthe ski center and settle up. Not like we skied. ",
        "Ben: Yeah, you need any money or anything... ",
        "Bill: Nah, I'll just put it on the card. We'll deal with it later. ",
        "Ben: Okay. ",
        "Marina: Daddy... ",
        "Frank: No. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, you know what? I got that. But I just have one more thing to \r\nsay to you, just one. And then if you still want me to leave with you, I will.\r\n",

        "Lizzie: No, Mom, the problem is not at school. ",
        "Beth: Then there is a problem? ",
        "Lizzie: Yes. I need a break. ",
        "Beth: What... A break? A break from what? ",
        "Lizzie: From... From you! From dad, from grandpa, from the whole family. I \r\nneed... The whole year, Mom, since the whole Lorelei business. It's just been \r\none thing after another and I can't hack it anymore. ",
        "Beth: Sweetie, I'm sorry about all of that. I would take it back if I... ",
        "Lizzie: I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying... (sighs) ...Everything's \r\nchanged since you and dad split for good. I mean, you're seeing Bill now. ",
        "Beth: Actually... ",
        "Lizzie: And I\u2019m fine with that, Mom. I just... I can't have it in my face \r\nevery day. And, dad... Dad's fighting with Harley over who gets custody of Zach, \r\nand I can't stand that. And Aunt Alexandra and... And grandpa are always \r\narguing. And... (sighs) ...Grandpa and Olivia, I mean, the way things are going, \r\nthey're going to be split up by this summer and... It's... I... It's too much.\r\n",
        "Beth: You're right. You're right, it is too much. It's much too much. But \r\nwe'll simplify it, okay? ",
        "Lizzie: How? ",
        "Beth: Well, for starters, you're going to move in with me. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm going to move in here? ",
        "Beth: No. We'll get a house, you and James and me. ",
        "Lizzie: Isn't that going to cramp your style? I mean, with Bill, having me, a \r\n16-year-old around 24-7? ",
        "Beth: Actually, Bill and I aren't seeing each other anymore. It just \r\nhappened. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Well, I'm sorry. But I still want to move. ",
        "Beth: Why? Why? I just told you that Ill have more time to spend with you. \r\nAnd I promise you, the things that have happened in the past are not going to \r\nhappen anymore. ",
        "Lizzie: Mom, this is not about you, okay? This is about me and what I want. \r\nI'm angry and frustrated and resentful, Mom. I'm trying to put my energy towards \r\nsomething good for me, for myself, something positive for once. Please, please \r\nhelp me do that. ",
        "Beth: Well have you told your father that you want to go away? ",

        "Alan: You heard what I said. ",
        "Phillip: Don't be ridiculous. ",
        "Alan: Go ahead. Make a few pronouncements. Go on the offensive. Take the high \r\nroad. Isn't that what you always do when you're lying? ",
        "Phillip: Let me ask you something, Dad. What... What would you do if I told \r\nyou that I had slept with her? Would you fake another heart attack for me? Would \r\nyou reprise that pathetic scene that you staged in here yesterday? ",
        "Alan: What pathetic scene? ",
        "Phillip: Oh, poor, broken-hearted Alan, surrounded by all the presents that \r\nOlivia had given him, pleading for her to take him back. \"Please, please, \r\nplease, take me back.\" ",
        "Alan: That was an honest moment between husband and wife... ",
        "Phillip: (laughs) Right. ",
        "Alan: ...Something... ",
        "Phillip: Right. ",
        "Alan: ...You don't know anything about or have forgotten. ",
        "Phillip: No, I think we both know exactly what that moment was. That was Alan \r\npulling out all the stops. Humbling himself because he had been caught \r\nred-handed yet again. Hey, it was good. The burning of the pre-nup was an \r\nespecially nice touch. ",
        "Alan: Now, who's sounding ridiculous, Phillip? ",
        "Phillip: Yeah, in case you didn't notice, it didn't work. Olivia didn't buy \r\nyour little stunt. That's why she's gone. ",
        "Alan: Well, she's not with you. ",
        "Phillip: Let me tell you something. When I think of the hell that you put the \r\ntwo of us through, when you faked those heart attacks... ",
        "Alan: All right, all right, Phillip, you paid me back. Or, you're in love \r\nwith my wife. ",
        "Phillip: We were loyal to you, both of us. Because you were what we cared \r\nabout. ",
        "Alan: Don't try to change the subject. You're in love with my wife! ",
        "Phillip: I got an idea. How about if you and I just don't talk to each other, \r\nperiod, right now? ",
        "Alan: I think that's a very good idea. ",
        "Phillip: Yeah. ",
        "Alan: Let me tell you something. What you did to me was despicable. ",
        "",
        "Beth: You'll see. You're going to tell him, and it will be fine. Hey. ",
        "Phillip: Well, hello. Nice to see the two of you together again. Uh-oh, \r\nyou've been shopping. ",
        "Beth: No, uh, we've been talking and now we have to talk to you. ",
        "Phillip: Okay. Is something wrong? ",

        "Lizzie: Dad, I want to go away to boarding school-- to Alston Academy. ",
        "Phillip: Alston? That's... What are you... That's all the way back East. No.\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Dad. ",
        "Phillip: What are you talking about? ",

        "Phillip: No, no, no, no, no. That's out of the question. ",
        "Lizzie: Why not? ",
        "Phillip: Because you're getting a perfectly fine education where you are. And \r\nnot to state the obvious, if you went away, I would miss you. ",
        "Beth: I already expressed that opinion. ",
        "Phillip: Whose muffin would I steal in the morning? ",
        "Lizzie: (laughs) ",
        "Phillip: Who would I watch \"Survivor\" with? You know. Not to mention, how \r\nmuch I would miss hearing that Christina-- what the hell is her name-- song \r\nplaying over and over again? No. ",
        "Lizzie: I'll play it for you on the phone, Dad. ",

        "Phillip: Sweetheart, if you want to move out and get a place of our own, we \r\ncan do that. You're the reason that we're here. I suggested that before the \r\nwedding, remember? You... You were the one that wanted us to stay put. You and \r\nyour grandfather. ",
        "Lizzie: No, no, he wasn't. ",
        "Phillip: Yeah, don't you remember? The two of you... You... He and you... ",

        "Phillip: You told him to say that? Why? ",
        "Lizzie: I found out that he faked his heart attack. And I said that I was \r\ngoing to tell you and Olivia if he didn't do what I wanted him to do. I guess \r\nyou could say I sort of blackmailed him. And now I'm in trouble again. See, if I \r\nwasn't here, I wouldn't be tempted to do things like that. ",

        "Beth: Oh, Phillip, that is our daughter in pain. And I can't believe I'm \r\nabout to say this but... Maybe she knows what she needs better than we do right \r\nnow. And if she wants to go away, maybe we should let her.",

And secondly, I want you to know that I do listen to you, even when you \r\nthink I\u2019m not, I am because I know that you love me, too. And I know that you \r\nhave my best interest at heart. So when you say something to me, I really think \r\nabout it. I really think about it and then I figure out how I feel about it. I \r\nform my own opinion, what works for me. Can I keep going? ",

        "Frank: Don't talk to me right now. And as for you, you're my little girl. \r\nYou're my daughter. And I honestly believe that if you stay up here, you'll be \r\nmaking the biggest mistake of your life. Now, I know I can't watch you 24 hours \r\na day.
