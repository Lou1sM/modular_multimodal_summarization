        "Quinn: Now, that is more like it.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, there's more where that came from.",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Where's Harley?",
        "Frank: Mallet took her home. She'll be here tomorrow morning to have breakfast with the kids.",
        "Coop: Do you think she'll get any sleep?",
        "Frank: No.",
        "Buzz: Well, you no, it is hard to sleep when the one you love is not there.",
        "Frank: You guys, Gus could still be alive.",
        "Coop: But you think he's dead, don't you?",
        "Frank: Well, let's just put it this way, the guy who found him and picked his pockets thinks he is dead.",
        "Coop: What about you?",
        "Buzz: Let's close up, get some rest. Maybe we'll wake up in the morning feeling more optimistic.",
        "Coop: All right, I better call Lizzie.",
        "Frank: I think I saw her out front.",
        "Coop: Saves me a phone call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: ( Gasps ) Sorry.",
        "Sandy: Excuse me.",
        "Olivia: Sandy, hi. Don't worry, I won't bite.",
        "Sandy: You never know these days.",
        "Olivia: Oh, I'll bet. You screwed up big time, didn't you?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, about that...",
        "Olivia: Welcome to the club. Yeah, the \"I screwed up in Springfield club.\" I am a lifetime member and if you try really, really, hard you can become one, too.",
        "Sandy: Wow, as enticing as it may be, I was hoping my screw up days are over.",
        "Olivia: Pity. There are t-shirts involved. Are you sure?",
        "Sandy: Mm, really? A secret handshake?",
        "Olivia: Oh, yeah. So I'm assuming that if your screw up days are over, you've learned from your mistakes.",
        "Sandy: Oh, yes, I've learned so much. Many, many important life lessons.",
        "Olivia: Impressive.",
        "Sandy: But actually, I have gotten over Tammy. And I'm trying to move on with my life and I hope she does, too.",
        "Olivia: I have to get to the Beacon. I really glad you're doing okay.",
        "Sandy: I'm doing better than okay. I'm going to be just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, my gosh, look what time it is. I better get you home. I had permission to take you to the book signing, but after that... I might have to sleep in the barn. Let's get some ice cream and get out of here.",
        "RJ: Tammy!",
        "Tammy: Hey, little brother. What are you up to?",
        "RJ: Guys night out.",
        "Tammy: Just the guys?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Where's uh...",
        "Tammy: Jonathan's not here.",
        "Jeffrey: Listen, Tammy, about earlier...",
        "RJ: Tammy, how come you and Mom aren't friends anymore?",
        "( Knocking at the door )",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, it's about time. I was starting to worry about you guys. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: I came here to finish our dance, maybe add a few new steps.",
        "Cassie: You have got to be kidding me.",
        "Jonathan: Uh-uh. I had fun, didn't you? Only this time if you move a certain way, like against me and Tammy, then I'll move another way and I won't just step on your toes.",
        "Cassie: Are you threatening me?",
        "Jonathan: No. I'm making you an offer. Okay, it's more like an ultimatum. You tangle with me, I'll make things very uncomfortable for you and your boyfriend.",
        "Cassie: And what does that mean, exactly? What are you going to do? Are you going to burn down my barn again? Do you think that will convince me to approve of you and Tammy?",
        "Jonathan: No. Let's say I've got something much more deeper, and it will be much more satisfying if I've got to use it.",
        "Cassie: If you've got to use what?",
        "Jonathan: Let's just say I've stumbled upon some information. Shine a mega- watt light on Mr. Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Cassie: Jonathan what are you talking about?",
        "Jonathan: Put on your dancing shoes. I'll lead, you follow. Back off me and Tammy, or the music stops for you and Jeffrey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Josh, I got your message. What-- a mess. Remind me to fire my housekeeping staff.",
        "Josh: Actually, this is not a housekeeping issue.",
        "Olivia: No, I got that. Have you called the police?",
        "Josh: No, I haven-- I can't even find out what is missing. My laptop is there, my jewelry is sitting over there. Anything that has any value is where it's supposed to be. It's like someone is messing with my head.",
        "Olivia: Have you made any enemies? Besides, um...",
        "Josh: What, Reva?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Reva and I are fine. Honestly, anything of value-- I can't imagine what anybody-- the file.",
        "Olivia: Jeffrey.",
        "Josh: Ahh! It's gone. The file is gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What a brave, brave man you are, coming here to threaten me when Jeffrey isn't home. You should know I can be a lot nastier than he can.",
        "Jonathan: Cut the drama. Back off, get out of Tammy's life and we won't have a problem.",
        "Cassie: You are the problem. You try to tell me you are good for her and you come over here like this. She deserves more than you.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe you deserve more than Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Cassie: Okay, it's time for you to get off my property.",
        "Jonathan: No-oh! You do that, and I'll be on the bull horn tomorrow morning tell the whole damn world what I found out about Jeffrey and my dear old dead dad, Prince Richard.",
        "Cassie: Is this-- you found out from Josh, is that it? You found out Jeffrey and Richard knew each other way back then. I know that.",
        "Jonathan: I know something you don't know. Something that is going to make you want to bar your windows. Something that will make you want to keep your kids under lock and key. Here, we'll start with this photo. Pretty funny, isn't it? Come on.",
        "Cassie: A photo of Jeffrey and Richard together. Big deal.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, it could be.",
        "Cassie: Okay. You know, I don't even know why I am listening. I should just have you thrown back in jail.",
        "Jonathan: Why don't you just ask me what Jeffrey did? Why don't you ask me why it might be better if his secret dies with me? Because it could die with me. All you've got to do... put on those dancing shoes...",
        "Cassie: Okay, the only place I want to see you dance is at the end of a rope. Nobody plays this game with me and wins-- not when my children are involved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Families fight sometimes. But that doesn't mean that they stop loving each other.",
        "RJ: It doesn't?",
        "Tammy: No. Sometimes they just need a little bit of a break.",
        "RJ: Then come home.",
        "Tammy: Would it help if I come home? Visit with Mom?",
        "RJ: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Okay, let's go. All right.",
        "Jeffrey: You're going to make your Mom really happy.",
        "Tammy: We'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Coop, can Lizzie wait?",
        "Coop: Yes, sure, what's up?",
        "Buzz: Well, I've got some crates that need to be put in the supply room.",
        "Coop: All right. Hey, Frank, you just going to sit there?",
        "Frank: Yeah, man, I'm gonna-- I'm just gonna sit here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Excuse me, did you want some privacy?",
        "Lizzie: Well, Coop is inside.",
        "Quinn: Oh, relax, he didn't see us. He'll never see us. What we do stays between us.",
        "Lizzie: Right. So I can stay in your penthouse, and we'll work out the details between us?",
        "Quinn: I don't know. You know how big of a sacrifice that is for me.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I already gave up my room here, so if you say no, then I don't have anywhere to go.",
        "Quinn: So you're trying to make me feel guilty.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, and here I thought I was making you feel appreciated. Don't you see how much I appreciate you and everything you've done for me?",
        "Quinn: You know, you're very convincing.",
        "Lizzie: Then you're going to help me my way?",
        "Quinn: That's the way I'm leaning, but only if we can do this another time.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, we can do this another time. Um, I better go in.",
        "Quinn: Okay, well, I'll call you. Until another time.",
        "Ava: Hi, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Ava, hi.",
        "Ava: Are you having a busy night?",
        "Lizzie: What do you mean?",
        "Ava: Do you greet all your friends so nicely?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Quinn, he is just a pal. We were just, you know...",
        "Ava: What, hooking up, making out, necking?",
        "Lizzie: No, you don't understand.",
        "Ava: I do understand, but I don't think Coop will.",
        "Lizzie: Oh. Well, you're not going to tell him, are you?",
        "Ava: I thought you cared about Coop?",
        "Lizzie: I do care about Coop. I love him.",
        "Ava: You love him? He's such a great guy and you're treating him like dirt.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, please. Is that what this is about? ( Mocking Ava ) He's such a great guy. You don't care about what happened? All you care about is splitting us up so you can have him to yourself.",
        "Ava: This isn't about me or my feelings for Coop.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, your feelings?",
        "Ava: I didn't mean feelings like that kind of feeling.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I think you did. But it's okay, you know, he gave you a job, a place to live. I wouldn't blame you for wanting him.",
        "Ava: I'm not going to let you turn things around.",
        "Lizzie: He's taken.",
        "Ava: Didn't stop you.",
        "Lizzie: I am not with Quinn. We are friends, that's all.",
        "Ava: You're friends? Well, friends don't say there's more where that came from, and stand out on the porch of your boyfriend's father's restaurant and make out. You guys are asking to get caught.",
        "Lizzie: Quinn doesn't want me and vice versa. We dated in boarding school, but nothing happened. What, why don't you believe me?",
        "Ava: You know what? I want to believe you for Coop's sake, but...",
        "Lizzie: You know what? If you care about Coop as much as you say you do, you won't want to hurt him. Why torture him over a silly, meaningless kiss?",
        "Coop: Hey, there you are. What are you guys doing out here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Frank, check in on your sister.",
        "Frank: Pop, that's the last thing we should be doing right now.",
        "Buzz: Frank, you don't want to check in on your little sister?",
        "Frank: Of course I want to check on her, Pop, but you know what? I don't call and I don't want to wake her up because once you wake Harley up, she can't go back to sleep. She gets up and she paces, and her mind goes 100 million miles an hour. She's been like that since she was a little girl. You remember that. I guess you don't remember that.",
        "Buzz: You know, it is still a shock to me that I didn't know my own daughter when she was a little kid.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, she was a terrific kid.",
        "Buzz: Thanks to you, Frank.",
        "Frank: Pop, it was so much easier back then, protecting her and making her feel safe, and all that, but you know, I feel so helpless now. I can't do a damn thing for her.",
        "Buzz: Frank. Frank, even you can't fix everything.",
        "Dispatcher: Code 2 any unit in the vicinity. We've got a break-in at the Beacon hotel.",
        "Frank: Did you hear that? The Beacon. This is Chief Cooper. What have you got?",
        "Dispatcher: Possible 2-11, but the details are sketchy.",
        "Frank: It's a robbery. Who called that in, one of the guests?",
        "Dispatcher: No, the owner, Olivia Lewis.",
        "Buzz: Well, what do you know, Olivia Lewis.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: All right, maybe you put it somewhere else, like in your brief case or at the office?",
        "Josh: No. No, I put it in that drawer last night.",
        "Olivia: Okay, the only one you told about that report was...",
        "Josh: Cassie.",
        "Olivia: Okay, she didn't want to read it at first, maybe she changed her mind.",
        "Josh: If she wanted the file, all she had to do is ask me for it.",
        "Olivia: Maybe she wanted the information, but she didn't want you to know she wanted it, Josh.",
        "Josh: Olivia, we're talking about Cassie.",
        "Olivia: Okay, if it wasn't Cassie, who else would be interested?",
        "Josh: Who has the most to lose?",
        "Olivia: Jeffrey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hit me, go ahead. Get it off your chest.",
        "Cassie: You like this, don't you? You like bringing this out in people. Is that why you came here. You want to pick a fight with me?",
        "Jonathan: No. I don't want a fight. I just want Tammy.",
        "Cassie: You can't have her.",
        "Jonathan: Yes, I can. Cassie, look, Tammy is the best-- she's the one good thing I've ever had.",
        "Cassie: Well, that really is sad because you are the worst thing that has ever happened to her.",
        "Jonathan: I would never hurt her again.",
        "Cassie: Oh, don't give me that. She's facing arson charges because of you. And now you're here threatening her mother. I suppose you're going to say that's all in the name of love, too.",
        "Jonathan: Like you having her locked up. Maybe that wasn't supposed to happen to me and Tammy, but it did, it is real, and she is a part of me, and you're going to have to learn to live with it.",
        "Cassie: Uh-uh. It is not going to last. I'll make sure of that.",
        "Jonathan: If you keep trying to break us up, Tammy will hate you.",
        "Cassie: Maybe. But I'll deal with it. Because that's what mothers do, they put the welfare of their children before themselves. They sacrifice everything to protect them from predators like you.",
        "Jonathan: You're the predator. If you don't back off, I'll expose Jeffrey, and I'm serious.",
        "Cassie: Okay, time to get out.",
        "Jonathan: You're not going to stop me from seeing Tammy, so why don't you just go with it.",
        "Cassie: Get the hell out!",
        "Jonathan: Okay, I'll get out. You know what? I want you to keep this picture. It's called the souvenir, don't say I didn't give you a chance.",
        "Tammy: Chance for what? What are you doing here?",
        "Cassie: Go ahead, Jonathon, tell her.",

        "Gina Tognoni, inside \"The Light.\" My best trait is my sense of humor, and my worst trait, sometimes I take things too seriously. To be part of \"Guiding Light\" is such an honor. That is why I decided to come. It's such a great show, it has such great history, and it is such a pleasure to are around such great actors. See Dinah on Wednesday January 18th inside \"The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Ah, did I just walk in on something?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, we were just ... we were chatting.",
        "Coop: Okay, about what?",
        "Ava: You, and what a great guy you are, things like that.",
        "Coop: ( Laughs ) Well, that's good news. Please, don't let me interrupt. Keep going. Let me guess. You were talking about my looks, personality, dazzling sense of humor, charm, intelligence...",
        "Ava: Your big heart and integrity, the first two things that came to mind.",
        "Coop: Wow, thank you.",
        "Ava: You're welcome.",
        "Coop: Did my looks make it into top five at least?",
        "Ava: No, but you have good taste in socks.",
        "Coop: Okay. All right, so you'll never let me live that down.",
        "Ava: No, I'm not.",
        "Coop: Okay, look, I swore to you they were my dad's socks.",
        "Ava: Whatever. They were orange. Whatever.",
        "Coop: Okay, fine. You are being awfully quiet, Lizzie. Let's talk about me for once.",
        "Ava: Yeah, Lizzie, come on. Lizzie.",
        "Coop: Okay, um... why do I get the feeling I'm kind of missing something here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Dispatch, this is Chief Cooper, I need you to send a car to the Beacon hotel and then get back to me.",
        "Buzz: A car, Frank? A squad car? You're going to send a squad car, Frank?",
        "Frank: Yes, dad, that's what you do. You send a squad for a robbery.",
        "Buzz: Frank, it's Olivia's hotel! Swoop down there, show her what you're made of, Frank!",
        "Frank: Pop, my head's not there, right now. I'm a little worried about my sister, okay?",
        "Buzz: Harley, would be happy that you're finally getting a life!",
        "Frank: Why do I need to have a girl in my life to have a life?",
        "Buzz: Oh, I don't know. What was I thinking of? You don't.",
        "Frank: Pop, don't get me wrong, I would love to be with the woman right now, okay?",
        "Buzz: Then go, Frank. Go to the hotel.",
        "Frank: Pop, take it easy.",
        "Buzz: Go there, dust for fingerprints, uncover some conspiracy that will take weeks to solve, Frank. Frank, in the old country this is what we called being served on a silver platter.",
        "Frank: Okay, in the old country? In this country, we call it heavy-handed, and Olivia will see right through it.",
        "Buzz: Frank! Where is your sense of adventure, romance? Come on.",
        "Frank: Take it easy, there's nothing romantic about bagging evidence.",
        "Buzz: You want to talking about bagging, Frank? Picture you and me bagging here, and sipping coffee, and your 90 years old, Frank.",
        "Frank: No thank you. Okay, you're right. I guess you're right. You've got to move fast with Olivia, right?",
        "Buzz: Yes, because she's a woman with a lot going on.",
        "Frank: Yeah, you can say that again.",
        "Buzz: So go.",
        "Frank: Dispatch, this is Chief Cooper, cancel that car to the Beacon. I'll handle that myself.",
        "Buzz: Frank?",
        "Frank: Yeah, Pop.",
        "Buzz: Good luck.",
        "Frank: Thank you, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Clearly you guys were not talking about me here, so what is the deal?",
        "Lizzie: You know, Ava owes you big for giving her a job and a place to live, and that's what we were talking about.",
        "Ava: Yeah, and karma, how the good you put out there into the world comes back to you, and how you never deserve to be hurt.",
        "Coop: Who would hurt me?",
        "Ava: No one, not if we have anything to do with it.",
        "Coop: Okay. Well, you know what? You guys are the best then, so obviously nobody is going to hurt me, and I'm very lucky to know you guys, and you're very lucky to know me as we established.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, we're all so lucky.",
        "Ava: Yeah, feeling lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Who you calling?",
        "Josh: Cassie.",
        "Olivia: Why?",
        "Josh: To find out if she told Jeffrey about the file because if she did...",
        "Olivia: Okay, wait. Just wait. Wait a second.",
        "Josh: Why?",
        "Olivia: Well if Cassie didn't tell Jeffrey? What if Jeffrey wasn't the one who broke in here? What then?",
        "Josh: We move on.",
        "Olivia: Really? An incriminating file is missing on the man that she loves-- a file that wouldn't exist except for you. It could be anywhere and you're the one who lost it. Even I would kill the messenger.",
        "Josh: Okay. You're right.",
        "Olivia: Look, Cassie loves you, Josh, but she loves Jeffrey even more. Why don't we track this thing down without bringing them into it?",
        "Josh: That's fine, Olivia, but I don't even know where to start.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Then you're lucky you have me.",

        "Jonathan: You really want me to tell her why I came here?",
        "Cassie: Absolutely.",
        "RJ: Mom! Mom, look, I've got the book.",
        "Cassie: No way. Honey, that is great.",
        "RJ: Hi, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Hey RJ",
        "Tammy: This is weird. All of us here.",
        "Jonathan: I came here because--",
        "Cassie: We didn't finish our conversation at the Beacon. He was telling me how much he loves you and how much he will always put you first.",
        "Tammy: He will, Mom. You have to believe him.",
        "Cassie: Believe him?",
        "Tammy: I'm glad we're all here. I miss you so much.",
        "Cassie: I miss you, too, baby.",
        "Tammy: See, we're still friends. He doesn't think we love each other anymore.",
        "Cassie: Oh, honey, no matter what Tammy does, I will always love her. And the same goes for you. No matter what.",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe Tammy will come in and read to R.J.",
        "Tammy: Read to R.J. Forget about it. It is time for him to read to me, I think.",
        "RJ: Okay, you can read my new book.",
        "Tammy: Actually, it is kind of late, we should go, but I will come back soon and we can hang out.",
        "RJ: Okay.",
        "Tammy: I'll make sure it is soon, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Me, too.",
        "Cassie: Come on, R.J., I don't want you freezing out there.",
        "Tammy: Good night. She's starting to get it, get us. What did you say to her?",
        "Jonathan: I just told her how much I love you.",
        "Tammy: That's it?",
        "Jonathan: I can be very persuasive.",
        "Tammy: I guess so.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughing ) Here.",
        "Tammy: Harvey! Oh, you are amazing. Why is it taking everyone else so long to see that, see how you make me so happy.",
        "Jonathan: I suspect they'll come around eventually. ( Laughing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy still out there?",
        "Cassie: No, they're gone.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing, looking for stars or E.T.?",
        "Cassie: Actually, would you mind watching R.J. A little longer because I want to run an errand.",
        "Jeffrey: An errand, now?",
        "Cassie: Something I should have done earlier, and I just...",
        "Jeffrey: How long you going to be?",
        "Cassie: I don't know, but not long. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Did Frank take off and go somewhere?",
        "Buzz: Do you see him?",
        "Coop: No. Dad, where did he go?",
        "Buzz: Where did he go? I don't know. He had something better to do. Unlike me!",
        "Coop: Geez. All right, look, about Co2. All you have...",
        "Ava: I got it, really.",
        "Coop: Ava, thank you so much. You are the best. This means I can spend some time with Lizzie. Look, again, thank you so much. I really appreciate this.",
        "Buzz: Hey. You okay?",
        "Ava: I was about to ask you the same thing?",
        "Buzz: I'm having one of those nights, you know, hoisted on my own guitar, so to speak. Hope I didn't scare you.",
        "Ava: You didn't. I kind of needed to get away from Lizzie.",
        "Buzz: Oh, that Spaulding charm.",
        "Ava: Speaking of charm, you were in such a great mood before I left.",
        "Buzz: Well I don't know. Let's see. My daughter has a husband missing; Lizzie has her grandfather missing. Things aren't going very good.",
        "Ava: I'm so sorry. Is that the only thing that is bothering you?",
        "Buzz: No, but it's enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What should we do now? Tammy, Harvey and I were talking and we would like to go get a drink?",
        "Tammy: Well, Reva is probably waiting up for us.",
        "Jonathan: No. She has probably already passed out.",
        "Tammy: Doubtful. We should probably go.",
        "Jonathan: No. Come on. Can we have a few more minutes because as soon as we get home, we've got to go into different rooms. I never would have cast Reva as the family prude.",
        "Tammy: How can you say that? She's anything but.",
        "Jonathan: The whole separate rooms thing.",
        "Tammy: Reva is just trying to protect us. I wish my mom could see that.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, your mom.",
        "Tammy: Thanks.",
        "Jonathan: For what?",
        "Tammy: For reaching out to my mom. Whatever you said...",
        "Jonathan: Just glad your mom is ready to listen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Oh, hey.",
        "Sandy: Hey. May I?",
        "Lizzie: Sure, I don't own the place anymore. And if I did, I'd be making some big changes around here.",
        "Sandy: So what's wrong?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing.",
        "Sandy: Come on, Lizzie, we used to be friends.",
        "Lizzie: Used to be?",
        "Sandy: Still can be, if you want me.",
        "Lizzie: I can't exactly afford to be choosy now. I guess I am your friend, even with that whole thing was going on, double wife, Ava, and Tammy thing, I did stick up for you.",
        "Sandy: So you're the one?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. So you still freaked out about that stuff with Tammy?",
        "Sandy: No, I've moved on. I have.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. So does this mean you and Ava are still married?",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "Lizzie: Any chance of reconciliation?",
        "Sandy: No. Why are you asking?",
        "Lizzie: Well, because if you want to be my best friend, you'll remarry her, and get the heck out of town.",
        "Sandy: No, no. Ava's a great girl, but she's not for me.",
        "Lizzie: Why is she so great? Why does everybody light up when she is around?",
        "Sandy: That's simple. She's pretty and fun and bubbly...",
        "Lizzie: And boring.",
        "Sandy: Well, that's something you never were. So, why all of the concern about Ava?",
        "Lizzie: She likes Coop.",
        "Sandy: That's great.",
        "Lizzie: No it's not. Okay, just because you have a guilty conscience. You can find somebody else. I mean, if you can get over Tammy, she can get over him. And please, I really think you and Ava got something going on there.",
        "Sandy: Stop yourself right there. When it's over, it's over, and there is no turning back.",

        "Olivia: You let me help you. I love a who-done-it, and I always get my guy-- for a while anyway.",
        "Josh: Actually...",
        "Olivia: Actually, who is expecting this is going to expect questions, and I've got the element of surprise. And who is he going to talk to about this?",
        "Josh: No one. That's why I was going to say I would be grateful if you would help me.",
        "Olivia: Well, then I jumped the gun.",
        "Josh: Yes. Which is not your style anymore. You like to take it slow, right?",
        "Olivia: I certainly try.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. What? What?",
        "Josh: Downstairs earlier, it just kind of took me by surprise.",
        "Olivia: You and me both. I usually don't have any restraint whatsoever.",
        "Josh: So why start now?",
        "Olivia: Because it is too soon.",
        "Josh: For you?",
        "Olivia: Both of us. Look, I've been pretty obvious about my intentions, but the thing is it's either be easy or right, and for once I just want to try to get it right.",
        "Josh: By taking it slowly?",
        "Olivia: I know it's a big change, but I can do it. Frank?",
        "Frank: Olivia, Josh. Dispatch called about a burglary.",
        "Josh: Look at this, the chief of police. I'm flattered.",
        "Olivia: Frank, can I speak with you outside a moment?",
        "Frank: Sure.",
        "Olivia: We shouldn't get the police involved until we know what happened. I'm glad you came.",
        "Frank: Well, you know, I just happened to be in the neighborhood, so...",
        "Olivia: You know, it is a false alarm.",
        "Frank: False alarm? Olivia, I saw the room; it was trashed.",
        "Olivia: We thought it was a robbery, but as it turns out, it was just a case of domestic vandalism.",
        "Frank: You talking about Reva?",
        "Olivia: They're having problems, and I thought it would be better if we kept this quiet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Cassie. I wasn't expecting to see you.",
        "Cassie: From the looks of it, you weren't expecting to see anybody, were you? Except maybe the police.",
        "Josh: Actually, it turns out I don't really need the police to be involved because...",
        "Cassie: I know. I know. Because someone broke in?",
        "Josh: Yes, that's true, but fortunately nothing was taken.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, except a file on Jeffrey. It's gone, isn't it? Jonathan has it.",
        "Josh: Jonathan?",
        "Cassie: Uh-huh. And he's blackmailing me, Josh. He says if I don't back off and let him have Tammy, he's going to use whatever is in that file against me.",
        "Josh: You know, I should have known it was Jonathan. I'm sorry, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, forget sorry, and just help me. I need you to help me take him down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: It's beautiful.",
        "Coop: I was about to say the same thing.",
        "Lizzie: Well, your lines are getting better.",
        "Coop: Ha-ha, that was not a line. So, when I came out here earlier, you were talking to Ava about me and how great I was, and...",
        "Lizzie: You are.",
        "Coop: Was that all you were talking about?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, why?",
        "Coop: Look, not that I have anything against two gorgeous women talking about me, that's fine. It's just that, um... I don't know. It just seems like something strange for the two of you to be talking about, that's all.",
        "Lizzie: It's nothing strange. It's normal for girls to talk about and analyze their boyfriends.",
        "Coop: You mean like frogs?",
        "Lizzie: No, not like frogs. You're my prince.",
        "Coop: Well, because of all your kisses.",
        "Lizzie: Is that right. Coop?",
        "Coop: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: You and me, what we have, is that real? I mean, is it going to last?",
        "Coop: Yeah. Why wouldn't it?",
        "Lizzie: Can you just say yes?",
        "Coop: Yes. Yes, Lizzie, yes.",

        "Quinn: Oh my goodness.",
        "Ava: Excuse me, I'm so clumsy.",
        "Quinn: You know what? I think clumsy is really odd.",
        "Ava: You're Lizzie's friend?",
        "Quinn: Quinn, right.",
        "Ava: Ava. You've been friends for a long time?",
        "Quinn: We go way back. Same parties, same schools, same trust funds.",
        "Ava: Don't you think it's a little weird you guys are friends after you dated?",
        "Quinn: We never dated. I guess there's a first time for everything, huh?",
        "Ava: Well, Lizzie said...",
        "Quinn: What did Lizzie say?",
        "Ava: Nothing. She didn't say anything.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Ava: Thanks for your help.",

        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Sandy: It looks like you're we're wrapping up. If you don't mind, I'll just pour myself a cup of coffee.",
        "Buzz: I'm kind of surprised to see you. You've been keeping a low profile lately.",
        "Sandy: I'm putting my life together. Starting over.",
        "Buzz: I've done that once or twice.",
        "Sandy: And everything worked out for you, right?",
        "Buzz: Pretty much.",
        "Sandy: No regrets?",
        "Buzz: I didn't say that.",
        "Sandy: But everything worked out the way it was supposed to, right?",
        "Buzz: Well, I didn't say that, either. But you know, you've got to keep going.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. That's what I'm trying to do. Now that my life with Tammy is over, I'm ready to move on with my new life, and there has to be some other girl out there for me, right?",
        "Buzz: Absolutely.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. I mean I messed up with Tammy and Ava, and there's a whole lot of mistakes I can learn from and do better. You got a girl?",
        "Buzz: Me? ( Laughs ) No.",
        "Sandy: Come on.",
        "Buzz: I don't have time for girls in my life.",
        "Sandy: A handsome devil like you? That's too bad.",
        "Buzz: Dating? Carbon dating, maybe. I've had a couple of amazing women pass through my life, and who were crazy enough to stop and love me for a while, but... no, now it's time for someone else to have that in their lives.",

        "Frank: And when you're not?",
        "Olivia: What are you getting at?",
        "Frank: I mean just a minute ago, I walked in, and I kind of feel like I walked into the middle of something. I know you and Josh were married...",
        "Olivia: We were married, and now we're great friends, but I'm not taken, if that's what you're asking.",
        "Frank: I was just asking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You've got to help me stop him, Josh. You've got to tell me what is in that file.",
        "Josh: I can't do that. I would if I could, but I don't know.",
        "Cassie: What do you mean, you don't know? Didn't you read it?",
        "Josh: No, I didn't read it. I wanted to leave that option for you.",
        "Cassie: Oh, great. So Jonathan is the only one who knows what is in that file? How are we going to defend ourselves if we don't know what he has?",
        "Josh: Look, Jonathan doesn't know I didn't read the file, so that may work for us as leverage of some kind, right?",
        "Cassie: I think we have to reconstruct the file. I think we have to find out everything there is to know about Jeffrey.",
        "Josh: Wait, wait, wait. You think about that. You really want to do that? You want to dig up information on Jeffrey that may change the way you look at him?",
        "Cassie: I think I have no other choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: What if my mom does finally come around and accept us, and what if everyone accepts us? I mean, I know it's a lot to ask, but what if it happens?",
        "Jonathan: Well, then, you'll probably see a lot more of me, and you'll get bored and run off with another guy.",
        "Tammy: No, I'm serious.",
        "Jonathan: I'm serious.",
        "Tammy: Maybe if she came around, she would have the charges dropped and we can become a family, a real family. I know it's probably not going to happen, but a girl can dream, can't she?",
        "Jonathan: Yes, she can. I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure those dreams come true.",

        "Dinah: I love being single. There's so much time to think and reflect without distractions. I think you do everything better when you're single. I sleep so much deeper without an elbow in my face and longer, since no one's around to rip off my covers or my pajamas."
