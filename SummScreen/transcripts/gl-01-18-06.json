She is just about to call him and cancel when Blake shows up and after they talk, Blake decides to help her get ready. She calls Olivia into help, and after deciding they need a man's point of view call Rick and Frank over. Mallet picks her up for their date and kisses her in the hallway. He goes to kiss her again later but Dinah tells him that they went to fast before and should take it slower. Mallet gets a call from Harley needing help and he goes to help her but to her surprise invites Dinah along. Dinah is left out by their reminiscing and goes to Spaulding where she runs into and comes onto Alan-Michael. He is all for it until Dinah breaks out in hives from her dinner. Mallet finds her and calls Rick to her apartment to check her out. He then offers to stay with her until morning. In a final voice over Dinah says she still likes her independence but it is nice to have someone to be with, although she tells Mallet that there are some ground rules."

        "Dinah: I love being single. There's so much time to think and reflect, without distractions or criticism. This is great! No more wasted nights sitting through movies where guys in kimonos kick the stuffing out of each other. And the best part is I get both arm rests. Yeah. More room for me and my jumbo bucket of popcorn. Remind me, why did I think I needed a man? Well, there's that. But who needs all of the emotional crap that comes with it? Not me. One, please. Shoes, one of the few things in life that are better off in pairs, and I don't have to worry about some guy at home making me feel guilty because I bought a few pairs in different colors or ragging on me about all the space I'm taking up in the closet. The closet is mine, all mine. Hello, people, this is Springfield, not Noah's Ark. I believe you do everything better when you're single. I sleep so much deeper without an elbow in my face, and longer, since no one's around to rip off my covers or my pajamas. Being single makes me better at work, too. I'm more focused. I can devote myself completely to the task. And why not be married to your work? What's a date anyway, except one hideous job interview after another. At least at work, you get paid. On a date, even if you do eventually hit on the right guy, he'll only let you down in the end. I mean, sure, it's always great in the beginning, but pretty soon you're staring off into space, fantasizing. You imagine yourself moving into Romeo's dream house, having kids, growing old and happy together. And then-- bam!-- Before you know it, you're holding a gun on Romeo and his new girlfriend Bambi. She's always a blonde. Now most people are terrified of being on their own. They it's right up there with being torn apart by hungry sharks. Or being buried alive with your cell phone-- only to discover the battery's dead. Entombed, solitary. Your hearts so empty, you could-- nope! I look on the bright, bright, bright... the bright side. Come on, I spent months in prison. I'm not afraid of being alone. I'd rather be chained to a wall in solitary confinement any day than be chained to someone like A.C. Mallet. Cutting him loose was the best thing I ever did for myself. Now I can concentrate on what's really important, like do I want a buzz burger or something else. Actually, a buzz burger sounds really, really good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Hello! Hello, is anybody here? Looking for some coffee, coffee to go. Can I get some service? I'm walking to the cash register. I'm taking all of the cash out of the register. I'm now stealing all of the muffins.",
        "Frank: Take it easy, take it easy. I was taking the trash out.",
        "Mallet: Frank, what's going on? What are you doing here? I figure you'd be at the station hiring a bunch of rookies to pick up my slack.",
        "Frank: Well, just like you said you're taking a leave of absence to find Gus I'm helping out here. Helping Pop so he can spend time with Harley.",
        "Mallet: I haven't seen her today. How is she?",
        "Dinah: I should go over and say hi. Blake was right, mallet is a great guy, but he's a great guy in love with Harley and always will be.",
        "Frank: See you.",
        "Mallet: Thanks, Frank.",
        "Frank: Yup.",
        "Dinah: I don't need anymore heartbreak. I am not following him. Okay, so I'm following him. I just want to see what he's up to in a curious sort of way. It's not like I'm obsessed or anything, so, you know, what could it hurt? Oh, this is how it starts. You watch him, and then watching becomes following, and then following becomes stalking and then it's Hart, Cassie and a .32 magnum all over. Stop yourself, Dinah. You've come to far. You have a great job. People don't hide when you walk into a room anymore. You can't blow it-- not for some guy. For some guy with eyes like steel magnets and a chest you just want to bury your face in. Who needs a man like that? He's typical, dime a dozen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vendor: Two for one. We're having our two for one sale. Buy that book, you get another one free?",
        "Dinah: Why? To keep this one company? You don't think a book like this could be happy on a shelf by itself?",
        "Vendor: Sure, lady. Whatever you say. If you only want one...",
        "Dinah: One is not a lonely number. ( Cell phone rings ) What?",
        "Mallet: Hi, Dinah, it's Mallet.",
        "Dinah: Oh, hi.",
        "Mallet: Hi. I got your message.",
        "Dinah: You got my message that I never wanted to see you again, so why are you calling?",
        "Mallet: How about some dinner?",
        "Dinah: Are you deaf? I said I didn't want to see you anymore.",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry. What did you say? I'm kind of getting a little static here. Hello?",
        "Dinah: I said we're through.",
        "Mallet: What? I'm sorry what did you say, pick you up in an hour? Did you say-- I'm sorry. Okay, I'll pick you up an hour. I'm heading into a tunnel; I'm losing the signal.",
        "Dinah: You're not heading into a tunnel. Stop pretending you can't hear me and live with it.",
        "Mallet: What? Okay, I'll see you in an hour. Hello? Hello? I guess I lost you, bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: It's a dinner, not a relationship. No big deal. Okay. Sweet. Sexy. Serious. Ah, where's the one that says I'm hungry and you're paying, so let's go. Try to pick the right dress for a date is like trying to pick the right neurosurgeon. There's so many choices, no matter which one you choose, you still can die. Or at least look like... ( knock at the door ) oh, my God, he's early. Be quiet, he'll go away and come back.",
        "Blake: Dinah, it is me, Blake.",
        "Dinah: ( Sighs ) Hey. I didn't expect to see you. Is Daddy okay?",
        "Blake: Oh, yeah, he's fine. In fact, I'm going tomorrow to D.C. to see him-- oh, God, Dinah. Are you all right? I mean, you're not in the middle of an episode, are you?",
        "Dinah: No. I just have a date, thank you very much.",
        "Blake: Really? With who?",
        "Dinah: Detective Mallet.",
        "Blake: Dinah, Dinah...",
        "Dinah: Look, I know what you're thinking, okay? I know what you're thinking. You're thinking I'm asking for a world of trouble and that everything is just going to fall apart, and I'm going to turn to stalkery. But you know what? What if-- what if he makes me happy? What if he makes me feel beautiful and not crazy? And I know that I really don't deserve a guy like that, but... man, when I'm with him, he makes me believe that I do. And, look, since... Gus and Harley, they're married, and I'm not stealing anyone's husband. I thought it would be a good shot.",
        "Blake: When is he coming to pick you up?",
        "Dinah: Really soon.",
        "Blake: I've got a lot of work to do.",
        "Blake: I was born to be a fairy Godmother. You're hot. You look so hot and carpet smokin'. What, you don't like the dress?",
        "Dinah: It's not the dress. It's me. What am I doing? I swore off men; I kicked the habit. And here I am back on the treadmill like a junky.",
        "Blake: Dinah, you're not the same person. You're not going to hurt anybody, are you?",
        "Dinah: No. Blake, I have a pattern, I have a pattern. I am attracted to men who are clearly---",
        "Blake: In love with someone else, I know. Man, I should be writing my next book about you.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah. You know what? Daddy would really love that. You know what? I'm not going.",
        "Blake: No, no, no. That came out all wrong.",
        "Dinah: No, you know what? The problem is you were right.",
        "Blake: No I'm not! Okay, I am. But the past is the past, Dinah. You know, just like Harley and Hammer in the slammer. Their love was a force to be reckoned with, but they got past it, and so can you.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Blake: You didn't read all of my book, did you?",
        "Dinah: No, I'm sorry, I didn't.",
        "Blake: All right. It's about choices, Dinah. It's about setting boundaries, even when passion is about to drive you off a cliff.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Boundaries are exactly what I need. I need boundaries. I need some rules. I need some rules to keep me in check so I don't go walking off that cliff with every guy that I meet.",
        "Blake: Right!",
        "Dinah: First of all, I am not going to rush into bed with Mallet again. That wreaks desperation.",
        "Blake: What's the second?",
        "Dinah: You never shave your legs before you go out on a date. No matter how much you have to drink, you'll never find yourself getting into bed with him. Number three, you never have more than one glass of wine that way you might forget you didn't shave your legs. Rule number-- tell me what number rule I'm on?",
        "Blake: 22.",
        "Dinah: 22. You never, ever give up anything for your man. I'm talking anything from your job to the remote control! 23!",
        "Blake: Oh, no! Okay, okay. That's enough. All right? You're scaring me, Dinah. All right? Because you're just in denial here. Love is not something you can control. As least not the good kind of love.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, right. Watch me.",
        "Blake: You know what you need?",
        "Dinah: A chastity belt.",
        "Blake: A drink. You need a drink to loosen you up.",
        "Dinah: No. I have one drink per date, you know that. I've mentioned this already.",
        "Blake: I'm not your date. Come on. We're going downstairs.",
        "Dinah: No. Wait a minute. Hey. I don't want to mess this up, you know. I don't know what I want, but I don't want to ruin it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: We're drinking-- now. Hey, Olivia, we need some liquid courage.",
        "Olivia: Really? So, what is going on?",
        "Blake: Dinah has a date.",
        "Olivia: Oh, good.",
        "Dinah: Louder, just say it louder, okay?",
        "Blake: I just sat through your dating rules. I do what I want. She's afraid she's going blow it.",
        "Olivia: Oh.",
        "Dinah: No, I'm not afraid I'm going to blow it. I just know when I get invested, I have bad things happen to me.",
        "Blake: Which is why she's inventing more boundaries and rules than the House of Representatives. Like that'll help. We are who we are, honey.",
        "Olivia: That's true, but I do think that we can learn from our mistakes, start over, maybe try a little harder next time.",
        "Dinah: You do?",
        "Olivia: Oh, gosh, I have to believe that. Maybe if I tried a little harder a little earlier with your brother, I'd still be with him.",
        "Blake: You know, if I were you, two, I would so be out there every single week with a different guy. I'd be dating all over the place. Doing all that romantic stuff. Dancing on the beach, holding hands--",
        "Dinah: What decade are you living in?",
        "Olivia: I have to agree with-- it's hard being single, especially in the corporate world. No, dating is war-- if not an extreme sport. So, before you go hopping into bed with someone...",
        "Dinah: You're telling me these things now?",
        "Olivia: You didn't?",
        "Blake: She did.",
        "Olivia: With who?",
        "Dinah: Don't ask. I don't want a lecture.",
        "Olivia: ( Gasps ) With him?",
        "Blake: With him.",
        "Olivia: He's hot. Isn't he in love with Harley?",
        "Blake: Shh.",
        "Dinah: Hey, I'm canceling my date, okay? Done.",
        "Blake: You are so not done. You're not canceling. I put too much effort into you.",
        "Dinah: I don't care. This is not your day. This is my day. Okay? And I... I am tired, I'm a little exhausted, and I don't feel like going out tonight, and I cannot stand this dress.",
        "Olivia: What's wrong with the dress?",
        "Dinah: Everything.",
        "Olivia: No, it's a nice-- you look great. Okay, maybe what we need a second opinion.",
        "Blake: Preferably male.",
        "Olivia: Of course male. So let's go find some consultants.",
        "Dinah: Consultants?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What do you think? Too slutty?",
        "Blake: Not slutty enough.",
        "Dinah: I want something that screams... ( purrs ). I'm in control. Okay, let's hurry. Come on, we've got to pick a dress.",
        "Rick: Nah. Nah, you need to put the slutty dress back on with the high heels. The higher the better.",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Frank: Real high.",
        "Dinah: Which one was that?",
        "Frank: Well, it was the first one. But do us a favor. Just kind of turn around real slow, that's it.",
        "Rick: Slower.",
        "Frank: Now once again. Now bend over, put your hair down over your--",
        "Rick: Wiggle it.",
        "Frank: Now swish it.",
        "Dinah: Rick.",
        "Frank: There you go, that's a good like.",
        "Rick: I'm trying to help you. I'm trying to help. If something's showing that shouldn't be showing, it's better I see it than her date, right?",
        "Frank: Exactly. Good for you.",
        "Rick: I'm trying to be objective here. I'm a happily married man, now put the slutty dress back on. And think four words: \"I'm a naughty girl.\" ( Laughter ) It's all about attitude. Go! You go.",
        "Blake: All right, enough, enough, enough! She's wearing what she has on.",
        "Frank: What are you talking about?",
        "Rick: What? No.",
        "Frank: You kidnapped us to come up here and vote on a dress, Blake. And now you're not going to let us vote?",
        "Rick: We should've watched the football game, Frank.",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "Blake: Oh, please. This is the best day of your lives.",
        "Dinah: You guys, which one is that? Is that number one? If that's number one, then I'll go put that on. You take a look at it and make a decision.",
        "Rick: The naughty dress.",
        "Frank: Yeah. ( Knocking on the door )",
        "Dinah: Oh, he's here. He's here. Oh my gosh.",
        "Blake: Calm down.",
        "Olivia: You look great.",
        "Frank: You look great.",
        "Dinah: You sure.",
        "Olivia: Yes!",
        "Frank: You look beautiful.",
        "Rick: It's a strong number two choice.",
        "Dinah: Rick.",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Mallet: Ready to go?",
        "Dinah: Ah, yeah, sure.",
        "Mallet: Oh, hey!",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Olivia: Hey.",
        "Mallet: Hello. Frank? Hi.",
        "Frank: Hey, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: Am I buying dinner for everybody? ( Laughter )",
        "Frank: No.",
        "Blake: No.",
        "Dinah: No. You know Frank and Blake and Rick.",
        "Mallet: What's going on?",
        "Rick: I work here.",
        "Dinah: They just stopped by and we were chatting. Okay, guys, thanks.",
        "Rick: Oh, you're welcome.",
        "Dinah: Good seeing you.",
        "Rick: Have a good time.",
        "Dinah: Let yourselves out, you know, when you're done and um...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: So, how are you? Man, he looks good, but don't even try to kiss me hello. Nope, I'm not falling for it.",
        "Mallet: I'm fine. I'm fine. And you? You look... you look amazing. Is that a new dress?",
        "Dinah: No. No, I just found it in my closet, the first thing I could find.",
        "Mallet: You look great. And thank you for the \"dear john\" phone call.",
        "Dinah: Well, what was up with your phony static?",
        "Mallet: Well, we're on a date, aren't we? It's better than sitting home alone making psycho phone calls.",
        "Dinah: Okay, this sparring thing, total turn on, but no way am I making the first move. Rule number... what was rule number one? Gosh, he looks good. Did I say that? This is bad. What am I doing? I'm losing it already and I haven't even left the hotel.",
        "Mallet: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: You okay?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Mallet: You sure?",
        "Dinah: Sure, I'm sure. I'm just a little worn out from work. I think we need to get me a coffee.",
        "Mallet: You want a coffee.",
        "Dinah: To boost me up, yeah.",
        "Mallet: How about no coffee?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: I don't know.",
        "Olivia: No, I think they're cute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Yowsa. I'm in trouble.",
        "Mallet: So, seriously, Marler, what happened? What was with the big freak-out?",
        "Dinah: I didn't freak out; I just... maybe I'm getting bored of you.",
        "Mallet: Like that would ever happen.",
        "Dinah: Look at those eyes.",
        "Mallet: Maybe you figured I would get bored with you.",
        "Dinah: Look at that smile.",
        "Mallet: I'm quite the catch, even your mom thinks so.",
        "Dinah: Dinah, stop it. Well, then, you should call her, she loves younger men.",
        "Mallet: I think I might just do that, she's hot and more together.",
        "Dinah: This is all coming from a man who pretends to be calling me from a tunnel when he's really across the street?",
        "Mallet: You saw me?",
        "Dinah: Duh?",
        "Mallet: Why didn't you say anything?",
        "Dinah: For the same reason I didn't say anything earlier when I saw you at Company.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) Oh, Dinah Marler, were you following me?",
        "Dinah: Puh-lease. I just happened to be in the same two places at the same two times.",
        "Mallet: Cool.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: I think it's kind of hot that you were following me. It's freaky, but it is hot.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. But I reckon you should be running in the other direction.",
        "Mallet: I think I'll keep going this way.",
        "Dinah: Uh-uh. No kiss on the first date.",
        "Mallet: You just kissed me upstairs.",
        "Dinah: That was a medicinal kiss; you were trying to wake me up.",
        "Mallet: I kissed you because I wanted to.",
        "Dinah: Well, from now on, you keep your lips to yourself. We're starting over.",
        "Mallet: So what about the times we've been together?",
        "Dinah: Mistake, mistake, mistake, mistake. We put the cart before the horse.",
        "Mallet: Why move the horse? Did we not have fun in the cart?",
        "Dinah: Ooh, if this were a movie, I'd have a snappy little comeback. One that would make him sorry he ever dared to mess with me and then I'd walk out on him. Coming off all spunky and adorable in the face of adversity. Okay, stop thinking about those chick flicks. Get real. Answer him.",
        "Mallet: Okay, I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. Look at you, like ice. I was only kidding. Okay, personally, I don't really want things to slow down between us. And since we have put the cart before the horse, I do know one thing for sure: I think you're worth waiting for.",
        "Dinah: I'm worth waiting for?",
        "Mallet: You cold?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. Thank you. Yes, rule number-- oh, screw me my rules; I can't remember them anyway.",
        "Mallet: Dinah, I'm sorry, I thought we were pretending to be virgins.",
        "Dinah: Um, what I said about the cart and the horse, don't worry about the damn, horse. He's fine, and so am I.",
        "Mallet: So you're okay?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Hmm. That's nice.",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "( Cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: Sorry. That's my phone. Ah, I have to take this.",
        "Dinah: Take it, if just to shut the phone up.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, hey, what's up?",
        "Harley: I'm following up on these leads on Gus, are you busy?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm kind of busy. What's up? Oh, uh-huh.",
        "Dinah: The ex wife. Okay, don't let him see you sweat. Better yet, don't sweat. Why worry about a smart, successful, funny, beautiful Harley, just because he's the love of his life, so he never got over her, so what? She is married to Gus-- Gus, who just happens to be missing or dead, which makes her vulnerable, needy, and so much more likely to fall into his arms. But if that happens, if that happens, it's none of your business. Just like this phone call is none of your business. I don't need to hear what they're saying, I'm not that insecure. I won't even ask.",
        "Mallet: No, that's fine. That makes sense. All right, fine. Bye.",
        "Dinah: What was that about?",
        "Mallet: That was Harley, she is running into a snag she is following up on Gus and Alan. And she can't go forward without my credentials.",
        "Dinah: Where is she?",
        "Mallet: She's at the court house. I promised her I'd go down there and flash my badge, so... you coming? The sooner we go and take care of that, the sooner we can get back here and you keep stepping on my toes. I mean, you got my jacket so you kind of-- do you want to come?",
        "Dinah: Yes! Sure, yeah, if you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Oh, hey.",
        "Harley: Finally you made it. Hi, Dinah, you look so pretty.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Mallet: Doesn't she?",
        "Harley: I'm sorry I interrupted whatever you guys were doing.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no. Don't worry about it. What's most important is that we find Gus.",
        "Harley: Thank you. Preliminary forensics report from the feds.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. I want to see that.",
        "Harley: The problem is some of this stuff is classified, so...",
        "Mallet: Well, you know what? I know a guy at Quantico that Gus hooked me up with, I met through him and we can call him.",
        "Harley: Thank you. You're the best.",
        "Mallet: I told you, Cooper, whatever we've got to do, we'll do. I'll help you out.",
        "Harley: I know. You're the one guy who I know is going to be hanging in there for me.",
        "Mallet: Thank you, right. I always do that. Like the time in D.C. when we couldn't find your father's name on that wall.",
        "Harley: Oh, we couldn't fine it. But did we give up?",
        "Mallet: No, we didn't give up. We dug right in, right? And what did we find? Mr. Buzz Cooper alive and cooking.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Mallet: We always get our man. We'll find Gus. God, it was cold that day.",
        "Harley: It was freezing. Do you remember you lost your gloves?",
        "Mallet: No, you lost your gloves!",
        "Harley: I lost my gloves then I took your gloves.",
        "Mallet: You took mine, right. I still...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: So, do you have the first quarter projections we were talking about?",
        "Alan-Michael: That's what I call dressed for success. Uh-oh, bad date.",
        "Dinah: Well, he's still alive, so I have that going for me. Are those the projections?",
        "Alan-Michael: Did you at least stick him with the tab?",
        "Dinah: Good. Six. Number six.",
        "Alan-Michael: Six dollars? Where did he take you, burger palace?",
        "Dinah: No, no, no. Number six is my rule. I gave myself some rules, which I would have followed if he hadn't have kissed me.",
        "Alan-Michael: So what's six?",
        "Dinah: Six is never put your eggs in one basket because there are plenty of baskets out there. Sexy, handsome rich baskets that are looking for a really good time.",
        "Alan-Michael: What are you doing? Wait, aren't you and A.C. Mallet...?",
        "Dinah: Yes. But I want you to forget about Mallet--",
        "Alan-Michael: No, no, no, you don't want me. You don't want me. I'm just a quick fix. This isn't what you need. This isn't even what I need.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's easy, it's tempting, but...",
        "Dinah: But you know what? You're the guy. So shut up.",
        "Alan-Michael: Whatever happens, I'm still single, right?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. Of course you are.",
        "Alan-Michael: Good.",
        "Dinah: Of course you are. I was having enough-- whoa!",
        "Alan-Michael: This is fine. This is good. Just like bungee jumping. Oh, my God.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Alan-Michael: Um, I forgot, I have to be at A... dog show.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughing ) What? That is the worst lie I ever heard.",
        "Alan-Michael: No, it's true. Lizzie's dog, Roxie, she's competing and I really have to go. You might want to fix that.",
        "Dinah: Fine, go! There are plenty of more where you came from. Oh, geez. ( Screams )",
        "Dinah: Well, you should specify that in the menu! Tell the chef some people don't like MSG on their fish! That some people are allergic to MSG! You know what? You suck! All right, well, I guess it can't get any worse, you know. ( Knock on the door )",
        "Mallet: Dinah?",
        "Dinah: It just got worse.",
        "Mallet: Hey, it is me. You in there?",
        "Dinah: Go away, I'm working!",
        "Mallet: Come on, Dinah, open up. You know I can pick locks. I'm sorry, I got all caught up in the case; I screwed up. I shouldn't have left you alone like that.",
        "Dinah: You know what? It's okay, it is all right. All is forgiven, Mallet! I just don't think this is working out anymore.",
        "Mallet: Come on, Dinah. You know... you know, I kind of like you. I mean, I kind of like all of you.",
        "Dinah: What floor am I on. Maybe I can jump.",
        "Mallet: I like the phone messages you leave on my voicemail. They make me smile. You make me smile.",
        "Dinah: Of all of the times to have a guy fight for me.",
        "Mallet: You know what else I like?",
        "Dinah: No, and I don't want to.",
        "Mallet: I like the way you tried to eat cookies in bed because I said it was cool. And I like the way you call your father daddy, like a little girl. And I like the way you pretend you don't care about stuff when I know that you really do. I think it is great, I think it is sweet.",
        "Dinah: He is killing me.",
        "Mallet: And I always like the way you look like you're about two seconds away from kissing me. Or, actually, sometimes you look like you're two seconds away from punching me in the mouth. It keeps me on my toes. So I guess you're not perfect, Dinah, but, you know, who is? There's not one thing I would change about you. Actually, that's not true. There are a couple of things I would change about you, but... did I mention that you're beautiful? Whoa. Wow, what is that?",
        "Dinah: I'm allergic to the stuff they put on the fish you ordered.",
        "Mallet: Oh, I figured you would pin this on me. Come on, let's go.",
        "Dinah: I'm not going anywhere. I look like a blow fish.",
        "Mallet: Stop, stop, stop! You're turning me on here.",
        "Dinah: What are you doing? Where are we going?",
        "Mallet: To finish our date.",
        "Dinah: I think I'm wheezing.",
        "Dinah: Do I look ugly?",
        "Mallet: You look beautiful, you do. She looks scary, really scary, so be nice, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Hey, beautiful.",
        "Dinah: Can you say that with a little more conviction?",
        "Mallet: Next time we go out, maybe we'll go out for tacos or something. Wow, what is this? You, uh... I think-- what's with all the clothes?",
        "Dinah: I'm messy. I'm messy.",
        "Mallet: Okay. I guess we can fix that.",
        "Dinah: Listen, thanks for coming by and checking in on me, but I'm awfully tired. I'm just going to go to sleep. As in like bye-bye.",
        "Mallet: I'm not really tired. Here you go.",
        "Dinah: You're not normal, okay? You're not normal. I have been around freaks most of my young life. When I was growing up, I had them around me all of the time. And my mom, it took me forever to find her, and when I found my dad, he was with another family. And then there was Cassie and Hart, and Edmund, and... you, you just... well, I don't need to be anybody else but myself with you, and, um... you're here, even when I don't want you to be.",
        "Mallet: I guess I'm kind of hard to get rid of. I'm kind of like a rash or an allergic reaction.",
        "Dinah: No. You're a freak. I know one when I see one.",
        "Mallet: I'm a freak. I'm a determined freak-- no, you know what? I'm a sexy determined freak because I managed to get you in bed and you said you didn't kiss on the first date.",
        "Dinah: You'd get with this?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. You mean right now?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, absolutely. Sure.",
        "Dinah: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Mallet: Sure. I mean the lights would have to be off and the blinds have to be closed really, really tight. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughing ) I know.",
        "Rick: Hey, I called in a prescription, but they don't do deliveries, I'm sorry.",
        "Mallet: No, that's no problem, I'll go get it.",
        "Rick: Didn't her dress look-- well, what did you think? What did you think of the dress?",
        "Mallet: She was beautiful tonight, yeah.",
        "Rick: I trust him. You're in good hands. Real good hands.",
        "Mallet: What are you going to give her?",
        "Rick: Just something to reduce the swelling, that's all.",
        "Mallet: Well I know that, but any instructions I should know? Bad side effects, anything I should be aware of?",
        "Dinah: And suddenly it hits you. After years of relationships so bad you were ready to swear off guys all together. After all that waiting for Mr. White Knight to show up and sweep you off your feet. After all the Bambies you mowed over in pursuit of the wrong prince charming, that the guy standing in front of you, the guy asking your doctor about the side effects of your hive ointment could be it, the one, him. Oh, gosh, this is bad. I am in so much trouble.",
        "Rick: So, did you get all that?",
        "Mallet: Yes, I did, thanks, doctor.",
        "Rick: All right. So you're all set.",
        "Dinah: Thanks, Rick.",
        "Rick: You're in good hands. Call me if you need me. My opinion, anything.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughing ) Thanks again.",
        "Rick: You're welcome.",
        "Mallet: Thanks, Doc. Oh. So, let's get you comfortable. Come here. There we go. You're going to be okay, you know that, right?",
        "Dinah: Yes.",
        "Mallet: All right. Come here.",
        "Dinah: Send him away, now. He'll break your heart and complicate everything. Don't fall for him. Do not fall!",
        "Mallet: You look better already.",
        "Dinah: Okay, so maybe I'll fall just a little. Now come on, you didn't really think I was going to give up my independence for some guy, as far as work, I'm more dedicated than ever. It has taken a while, but I'm starting to learn to stand on my own two feet. But every once in a while, and don't tell anybody I said this, it is nice to come home to somebody special.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Chinese takeout. No MSG, I checked.",
        "Dinah: Thank you, how was your day?",
        "Mallet: It just got better.",
        "Dinah: Is that kung pao beef?",
        "Mallet: Yeah-- you don't like-- oh, you don't like beef.",
        "Dinah: That's okay, that's okay. I'll do beef. That's fine. So, I thought you were supposed to wait for me downstairs. How did you get upstairs?",
        "Mallet: Olivia let me in.",
        "Dinah: Olivia let you in? She did that without asking me? She knows better than that. What were you doing in the back room?",
        "Mallet: I couldn't resist. I was going through your underwear drawer.",
        "Dinah: Look, we need to set a few ground rules, okay? Rule number one...",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh.",
        "Dinah: Never come to my room...",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm crazy about Harley, but now it is time to move on.",
        "Harley: I'm back.",
        "Dinah: Do you think we need to go take a shower?",
        "Mallet: Definitely.",
        "Jonathan: Cassie has her own things to worry about.",
        "Cassie: Everything that matters depends on me finding out what's going on.",
        "Josh: What if you don't like the answers you get."
