{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Carrie meets with Jeffrey and gives him the background on the development of Antimonium and how it came to be one of Spaulding Pharmaceuticals premiere drugs. She also tells him what happened to Maryanne Caruthers. He listens intently to the pertinent information but gives little away. She tells him to follow the Spaulding line but she intends to deal with the men responsible for Maryanne's death herself. Lizzie has been pressing to visit Phillip and, despite Beth's misgivings, Christopher agrees that it's time to allow it. Beth and Christopher take her to Ravenwood and, when they go to the Nurse's station to check on Phillip, Lizzie meets Olivia who comes out of Phillip's room. Unaware that Olivia and Phillip have decided to marry, Lizzie cruelly reminds Olivia that she no longer has the baby to lure Phillip into marriage. Olivia and Phillip have agreed to keep their plans secret for the time being. Lizzie is stunned at Phillip's detached state, but she talks to him gently, reminding him of their family. She tells him that she and Beth want to take care of him. She is very moved by his embrace and his promise that she'll always be his baby. Tony and Eden go to Lewis Construction so Tony can slip into the File Storage Room and get a look at the books. They're trying to find out what the shadowy man means when he says someone at Lewis Construction has connections to the mob. Eden is startled when Bill appears and she tries to keep him occupied while Tony rifles through the files to get the information he needs."], "Recap Author": "Megan", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["Carrie: Good evening, Mr. O'Neill.", "Jeffrey: You said on the phone that we met several years ago in France, Ms...", "Carrie: Oh, Carrie. Please call me Carrie. Yes, I think we did. But I'm not here to renew an old acquaintance. Oh, please, Mr. O'Neill, won't you shut the door? It makes it so much easier for the driver to operate the car.", "Jeffrey: I'm sure it does, but I don't have a lot of time, so if you could just get to the point, please...", "Carrie: Oh, Mr. O'Neill, I'm not going to waste your time. Oh, please come in, sit down, make yourself comfortable. I promise you, you're not going to want to miss a single thing.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: He's not here.", "Tony: All right, so where's the file room?", "Eden: It's right there.", "Tony: All right, perfect. You got the keys, huh?", "Eden: Yeah.", "Tony: Okay.", "Eden: There right there. That's the room. Now, go figure out the rest.", "Tony: I thought you told me that you had more information on these files, Eden. Am I wrong?", "Eden: You know, well, maybe you should have asked me that before we got here, okay?", "Tony: Okay, listen to me. Look, if we're going to find out what this Shadow guy has on Danny or Bill, I need to see contracts, crew list on every single job that Lewis...", "Eden: You know what? All that stuff is right in there, so you go right now.", "Tony: You need to clam down. Just do me a favor: Cover for me. You see that? Bill may be back any minute, so just do me a favor and cover for me, please.", "Eden: You know what? You've got to get out of here right now.", "Tony: Eden, Eden. Stop it. Just remember that we are doing this for the right reasons, all right? Okay?", "Eden: I know, all right? So, you just get in there and you get it over with, all right?", "Tony: Relax.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: (Clears throat)", "Eden: What now?", "Bill: Well, hello to you, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Beth: No way.", "Christopher: If you would just hear me out...", "Beth: No. It's a bad idea. The shock of seeing her father like that? Who knows how she'll react?", "Christopher: Beth, I understand your concerns, but Lizzie's assumptions about Phillip's condition are far worse than the reality. And if we continue to keep her away from him, all we're going to do is lose her trust.", "Beth: Don't you think I've already lost it? Oh, I see. She didn't tell you. Well, I called in a favor and got Lizzie a date for New Year's Eve. The boy ditched her at the dance, she had a miserable time, and it didn't take her long to figure out I had stupidly set the whole thing up.", "Christopher: I know you did that with the best of intentions.", "Beth: Tell that to Lizzie. Christopher, Lizzie is just getting back into the world. She's reconnecting with her friends; she's in the school play. I don't want anything to set her back.", "Christopher: But this could be an incredible step forward. Lizzie needs to feel that she's making a difference in Phillip's recovery. And Phillip is so consumed with the daughter he's lost, I think it would be a very good idea for him to spend some time with the daughter he still has.", "Beth: (Sighs)", "Christopher: Is there something else?", "Beth: No. It's just... I don't see how this could possibly be good for either one of them. Phillip is where he is because of what happened with Olivia. And we both know Lizzie is a great deal responsible for that.", "Christopher: Well, Olivia does still have her concerns.", "Beth: Why? Did something else happen?", "Christopher: Let's just say that Olivia has made it very clear that she doesn't want your daughter anywhere near her.", "Beth: Well, you know something? I think that that is a good idea. There is no love lost between Olivia and myself, true. But the fact of the matter is Lizzie pushed her to the point where she felt she had to run to protect her baby, and now that baby is dead, and Phillip is falling apart. And when Lizzie sees him, she's going to start connecting the dots.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: You liar.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Beth: Lizzie...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Phillip? You asked me a question once, down on the waterfront. You were really upset. You were trying to pull your life together, and you reached out to me, and you asked me something very important. Do you remember? I held you off that day, but I have an answer for you now. If you still want to marry me, the answer is yes. Is that what you want? Do you still want to marry me?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Phillip: Yes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: What are you doing here?", "Bill: What am I doing here? What are you doing here?", "Eden: Right. This is your office. Actually, I dropped by to see if my overworked boyfriend could be lured away with the promise of pizza and a sci- fi movie and fabulous company, I might add.", "Bill: Well, don't tease me, okay?", "Eden: I already got the videos, and we could be on the couch in ten minutes.", "Bill: (Moans)", "Eden: You know you want to.", "Bill: Baby, I would love to, but I've got too much work to do right now. I'm sorry.", "Eden: You know, the work will still be there in the morning.", "Bill: Which is when I've got to deliver a report to Josh on all our current projects, and I'm only halfway done with it.", "Eden: You know, between Danny's campaign and Lewis Construction, I never see you anymore.", "Bill: What are you talking about? We see each other all the time.", "Eden: But when was the last time we really talked?", "Bill: Hmm?", "Eden: You know, spend a low-key evening at night, hang in, order food. I am talking about quality time; intimacy.", "Bill: Right. All right, how about this? How about some quality time right now?", "Eden: Great. Let's go.", "Bill: Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come here, come here, come here. We don't have to go anywhere. We could just hang out right here.", "Eden: Oh.", "Bill: My, your enthusiasm is mind-blowing.", "Eden: Well, it's just... what are we going to do here?", "Bill: Look, I need an hour, tops. Then we'll do the whole movie/pizza thing.", "Eden: But it's... but it's late.", "Bill: Eden, it's like 6:00.", "Eden: Yeah, but I'm hungry.", "Bill: You're hungry? Then I'll just get a pizza delivered here, that's all.", "Eden: No. There's no plates, no napkins, anything.", "Bill: Are you all right?", "Eden: I'm great. I'm fine. I'm perfect.", "Bill: All right. Then I need an hour. That's it, okay? I promise.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: You are such a liar. You said that what happened to Dad wasn't my fault. You said it was just stress.", "Beth: Lizzie, I was just trying...", "Lizzie: Oh, save it, Mom. I'm not deaf. So is this true, Dr. Langham? Is Crazy Lizzie contagious? What, am I infecting my whole family now?", "Beth: Calm down.", "Lizzie: Why won't you let me see him?", "Beth: Because your father is going through a lot now, and I don't think it's something you need to see.", "Lizzie: Well, I can handle it, thank you.", "Beth: Well, maybe he can't, thank you. Nobody knows what might push him over the edge right now.", "Lizzie: Oh, and seeing me is going to push him over the edge?", "Beth: That's not what I meant, and you know it.", "Lizzie: I am something else, aren't I? Not only can I single-handedly drive my father insane, but my very presence is enough to drive him even crazier? You know, you hear of people not knowing their own strength, but that is something.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Christopher: Are you through?", "Lizzie: No, I am not. I have only just begun. Why? Is our time up now, Dr. Langham?", "Christopher: If this is the way you try to prove to us that you can handle your father's illness, you're not doing a very good job.", "Lizzie: Oh, I'm sorry. I just assumed that my own mother would believe in me. But thank you for correcting me of the error of my ways.", "Christopher: If you want people to believe in you, Lizzie, you have to earn it. We've been through this I don't know how many times. Your actions have consequences, and you need to take responsibility for that.", "Lizzie: I know, but...", "Christopher: When you reach a point where you are willing to accept that what you did may have contributed to Phillip's condition, then I'll believe that you're ready to see him. Until that time, go ahead: Blame your mother, blame everybody else in the world for all your problems.", "Lizzie: I know that what I did has something with my dad being sick, okay? And that's why I need to see him, so I can at least apologize to him. And I think it'd be good for both of us, don't you?", "Christopher: Don't play me, Lizzie.", "Lizzie: No, I swear. Okay, I am ready for this. Mom, there are things that Dad needs to hear from me, and I am ready to say them now. Please, you have got to give me a chance.", "Christopher: I was headed to Ravenwood now. We can all go together.", "Lizzie: Thank you. Thank you so much.", "Christopher: I am only doing this because I believe that this is the right time for you and for Phillip. Don't prove me wrong.", "Lizzie: Don't worry.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: You know, marriage is going to be good for us. Why? Because we've had so much practice with other people, right? Look, we know what works and what doesn't work. And you and I, you know, we're pretty much alike, aren't we? We know how to take care of each other. And, sweetheart, that's all I want to do. I want to take care of you and keep you safe. This world is full of things that don't make sense, right? But we do, don't we? I know you're still a million miles away, but I'm going to bring you back. I promise. Our marriage will give you something to come back to. But let's keep this our little secret for now, okay? Let's not tell anybody.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Phillip: Maybe I could use some help.", "Lizzie: Help like I've been getting, right?", "Phillip: Right. The difference, though, is that I think I may have to go away for a little while.", "Lizzie: Oh, Daddy...", "Phillip: Yeah. Yeah, I'm afraid so.", "Lizzie: Oh, hey, Mom, I was thinking maybe we should bring something to Dad, like a book or one of those Christmas pictures of me with Zach and James.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Beth: He's got one, honey.", "Lizzie: I know that. But what are we supposed to bring him? A necklace with a cross on it? Let's bring him some garlic.", "Beth: Lizzie.", "Lizzie: What? To ward off Olivia. Oh, I'm sorry. That's right.", "Beth: Okay, this proves my...", "Lizzie: The evil spirits.", "Beth: ...My point. This is a bad idea. You're not ready to visit your father.", "Beth: Well, it's too late. Dr. Langham's already waiting out in the car. Have you seen that thing? It's so old and boring... like him.", "Beth: Dr. Langham is not old or boring.", "Lizzie: Then you can sit in the front seat. Come on. Let's go. And don't worry, Mom. It's going to be okay. I'm not going to upset Dad.", "Beth: Honey, I'm also worried about you getting upset. That's why I'm so on edge.", "Lizzie: Well, I can handle it, all right?", "Beth: Well, you shouldn't have to handle it. That's the point.", "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. Mom, let's just go. I want to see my Dad, all right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carrie: Have you ever heard of antimonious, Mr. O'Neill?", "Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah, it's the drug that put Spaulding Pharmaceuticals on the map, isn't it?", "Carrie: Yes. And do you know how it was discovered?", "Jeffrey: No, but I've got a crazy feeling that you're going to tell me.", "Carrie: Many years ago, Brandon Spaulding brought an Egyptian exhibit to the museum in Springfield. The centerpiece was a prized sarcophagus. It came with some very simple instructions: \"Do not open.\" But curiosity killed the cat, and also the curator. He couldn't resist prying open the sarcophagus to see what was inside.", "Jeffrey: I'm going to stop you right there. Okay, you're telling me ghost stories. So, with all due respect...", "Carrie: Patience, patience, Mr. O'Neill. The curator pried open the sarcophagus, and inside he found a very peculiar, mysterious white powder. He took some of it away for some analysis, but unfortunately we don't know what he did with it, because he died shortly after in an insane asylum.", "Jeffrey: Let me guess: From the effects of the white powder.", "Carrie: Well, presumably, but nobody really knew for sure, until a brilliant young scientist came along: Angus Caruthers, who happened to be the curator's son. He decided to pick up where his father left off. He reopened the sarcophagus. Inside he found the powder and four little rings. He took a sample of the powder and tried to do a very complete chemical analysis. He discovered that it was made of, oh, certain plants and certain fish, and it had the ability to induce hallucinogenic dreams, and when imbibed, to render the subject completely impervious to all pain. He immediately saw the medical benefits.", "Jeffrey: And this happened when? '30s, '40s? But I'm sure that's not the end of the story, is it?", "Carrie: Oh, Mr. O'Neill. No, indeed. I'm afraid that's only the beginning. The scientist, Angus Caruthers, took his discovery to Brandon Spaulding, and they struck a deal.", "Jeffrey: What kind of a deal?", "Carrie: Well, the sort of deal you might strike with the Devil, Mr. O'Neill.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: It Came From Outer Space.", "Bill: (Laughs)", "Eden: The Blob. The Creature From the Black Lagoon.", "Bill: Okay, okay. Eden, I'm crazy about you. I know you want to get out of here, but whispering in my ear does not help me work any faster, okay? I am moving as fast as I can. What are you doing?", "Eden: I am encouraging your ability to multi-task.", "Bill: No, what are you doing?", "Eden: You can watch the movie at the house and do your work. Come on, The Blob awaits.", "Bill: All right, all right. We will go. But, if I'm going to take work home with me, let me pack it up, because I know what I need to take.", "Eden: No, I am the only thing that you really need to take home.", "Bill: (Laughs)", "Eden: But what...", "Bill: You okay?", "Eden: ...Ever. I'm still sore from the shoot from Tony's ranch. This girl is just not made for horseback riding.", "Bill: Yeah, well, at least you're keeping Tony busy.", "Eden: What?", "Bill: Tony. I thank you so much for distracting him from Danny's campaign.", "Eden: Oh, it wasn't that hard. Tony really loves being at that ranch. I don't know why.", "Bill: Well, whatever you're doing, just keep on doing it.", "Eden: I don't know how much longer I can do it. Tony has a mind of his own.", "Bill: Well, you're a very bright, creative woman. I'm sure you can think of many ways to distract him from the campaign and keep him out of town.", "(Thump)", "Bill: What was that?", "Eden: No, don't go!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Beth: Okay, now remember what I said. Your father isn't himself. Sometimes he gets very sad and he doesn't feel like talking.", "Lizzie: I know. I'm not going to freak or anything, don't worry.", "Christopher: We should probably check with Phillip's nurse before we go in.", "Lizzie: Okay. I'll wait here.", "Beth: No, why don't you come with us?", "Lizzie: I thought we were going to work on trusting me, remember?", "Beth: Don't make a move for that door until we get back, Lizzie.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: I won't. Well, you're popping up all over the place, aren't you?", "Olivia: Well, you shouldn't be surprised to see me here, Lizzie. You know that I care about your father and I want him to get better.", "Lizzie: You could have said all of that in a greeting card. But, whatever. Now that you're here, glad to see that you're getting back to your old self again. You know exactly what I mean. I tried to get you to come here with me to show Dad that we were friends again and we had put all of our differences behind us, but, no, you're too selfish to do something like that.", "Olivia: (Laughs) Well, actually, even I'm too honest for that, Lizzie, because we're not friends and we haven't put anything behind us.", "Lizzie: Did you just say that you were honest? Shouldn't you get struck by a lightning bolt for something like that?", "Olivia: You're cute.", "Lizzie: Oh, wait, wait. While you're on the whole honesty kick, you know, you don't honestly think that my dad's going to want any future with you after this? No baby, no deal. Sorry. You screwed up things with my grandfather, and now you are just fresh out of Spaulding men to sink your claws into. So, why don't you take this whole honesty thing to Home-wreckers Anonymous and call it a day? Because you're finished here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Miss Carrie, you don't exactly strike me as the \"Idle Historian\" type. So why don't you tell me what your involvement in this is?", "Carrie: I thought you'd ask that question. Here.", "Jeffrey: What's this?", "Carrie: It's a copy of the original documents signed by Angus Caruthers and Brandon Spaulding. It is signed, notarized, and dated.", "Jeffrey: Well, according to this, Caruthers retained the patent on the powder. And, so, that might have made him a very, very rich man.", "Carrie: Oh, it did, through a number of years. But, then he died, ten years later.", "Jeffrey: What about his heirs? Any heirs?", "Carrie: He had one daughter, Maryanne. Maryanne did not lead a charmed life. She was in the wrong place at the wrong time that night, and in the wrong company. When she got into the car with those five men, she had no idea what she was letting herself in for. None of them did. They were just out for a good time. When the car went into the river, the men did try to save her, at least for a while. But then they decided it was futile. They left her there. And the moment they made that decision, their lives changed forever. Those five men and Maryanne consumed the drinks laced with powder. Those five men and Maryanne got into the car. The car spun out of control and crashed through the railings of the bridge into the water. Those five men survived. Maryanne did not. She died. She died of youthful foolishness and gross negligence. Her death was never investigated. All memory of her was erased. You might almost say that she had never lived at all. You said you weren't one for ghost stories, Mr. O'Neill. Neither am I. But you might say that this powder carried a curse, a curse that touched the lives of everyone concerned.", "Jeffrey: You... you could have come to a lot of people with this story about curses and powders, but you chose me. Why? How does this end, Miss Carrie?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: I'll be right back. I just want to check on that noise, okay?", "Eden: You are no good for a girl's ego. Since I got here...", "Bill: Yes?", "Eden: ...All you want to do is run construction reports and listen to phantom noises.", "Bill: Phantom noises? Did you not hear that?", "Eden: Shh. Listen. No noise.", "Bill: You really want to get out of here, don't you?", "Eden: You have no idea.", "Bill: All right, we're good as gone, all right? Just do me a favor, just hit the lights. I got to get a ledger out of the file room.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Hi, Daddy.", "Beth: Are you sure it's all right for her to be in there by herself?", "Christopher: I think it's going to be very good for both of them.", "Beth: You know, if you told me 20 years ago Phillip would end up in a place like this, I never would have believed you.", "Christopher: Beth, what happened to Phillip could happen to anyone.", "Beth: No. (Laughs) Not Phillip. Phillip's always been larger than life. I guess that comes with the territory when you're a Spaulding. Never been a fight he's backed down from, never been a problem that he couldn't solve. Even when Lizzie was sick with leukemia and there was this disease that was bigger than the rest of us, he... he never gave up. I remember he was always writing everything down, trying to get all the information he could, as if he could tackle this disease by sheer will alone. He has saved me so many times. I hate that I can't save him now.", "Lizzie: It's pretty, isn't it? Come here. I just love winter, just like you. You know what I've been thinking about lately? Fern Hill. That ski resort. I mean, I know we only went there a couple times when I was little, but I remember Mom stayed in the cabin drinking hot cocoa all day and we had our skis on the moment the sun came up. Do you remember my first time going down the bunny slopes? I thought I was ready, and then got to the top and it just seemed so much bigger. I screamed the whole way down.", "Beth: I think it's been long enough. I think that we should go in there...", "Christopher: Beth, Beth, just give them some time. It'll be fine.", "Beth: Christopher, Phillip is in a world where he can't be reached, and Lizzie may have helped send him there. Nothing about this is fine.", "Lizzie: You know, I think I was a little bit more scared of the ski lift, the way that our feet would just dangle with nothing underneath us but air. You remember what you said to me? You said that \"You'll never fall, Lizzie, because Daddy will always be there to catch you.\" Wouldn't it be cool if we could live in one of those... a perfect world inside of a little glass bubble? It just seems so safe. But, Daddy, it can be safe here, too. I'm not going to let you fall. I promise you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carrie: We'll be dropping Mr. O'Neill off now.", "Jeffrey: I'll have more questions, Miss Carrie. Where can I reach you?", "Carrie: Oh, but you can't. But, I can always find you.", "Jeffrey: I'm afraid I don't work that way.", "Carrie: Oh, I know. I know you like to be in control. We all do, Mr. O'Neill. But I think you have enough here to proceed, to proceed until the very end, wherever it leads. And if you choose not to go forward, I would prefer if you did nothing at all. After all, a woman's life has been lost. This deserves some vindication, and we can't go halfway.", "Jeffrey: Oh, I never do things halfway.", "Carrie: Yes, that's what I've heard.", "Jeffrey: All right. I'll pursue this. But if what you say is true, it could tear this town apart.", "Carrie: It's a long time coming, Mr. O'Neill.", "Jeffrey: And it will take me a long time to build a case.", "Carrie: Oh, but I rely on your tenacity, Mr. O'Neill. The door.", "Jeffrey: The door.", "Carrie: Have a lovely, lovely evening, Mr. O'Neill.", "Jeffrey: Thank you, Miss Carrie.", "Carrie: Well, yes, Mr. O'Neill?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Daddy, I have missed you so much. And I know that I am part of the reason that you're even in here. But we're going to get through this. We both have to, okay? I know that I did bad things, all right? Yes, I did. Daddy, I didn't like Olivia and I didn't want her in your life. I tried to hurt Olivia and I ended up hurting you. You know, the thing is, out of all those terrible things that I wished on Olivia and her baby, when it actually happened, it didn't make me even feel good at all. I haven't been more sad in my entire life.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: Wait, don't go in there!", "Bill: What is going on with you?", "Eden: I'm practicing for the movies.", "Bill: Practicing what?", "Eden: Come on, you know.", "Bill: No, I don't.", "Eden: Um, in every creepy, sci-fi movie there's, you know, there's one character, usually the ing\u00e9nue, and she thinks everything is cool, but then the lights go out for whatever fill-in-the-blank reason and she's home alone and... come on, you know.", "Bill: No, I don't.", "Eden: Oh, come on. Okay, the ing\u00e9nue hears a noise in the closet, in the basement, and the audience knows that it's the blob or the alien or something really, really bad. And she should know at this point, too, because at this point in the movie, like, half a dozen people have been eaten by the thing already. But we all know she's go in the closet anyway. And the audience is freaking out and screaming at the screen. And even though they know she can't hear them. And what do they yell?", "Bill: \"Wait, don't go in there.\"", "Eden: Yeah!", "Bill: Yeah. Okay, I see. And that's what you were doing just now?", "Eden: Exactly.", "Bill: Okay, Eden, listen. Now you're starting to scare me a bit.", "Eden: (Laughs) Boo.", "Bill: No, seriously. You are rambling, you're jumpy. You have this sudden urge to go watch sci-fi movies when you don't even like sci-fi movies. So, enough with the games. Tell me what is going on.", "Tony: What's going on out there, Eden? It's way too quiet.", "Eden: (Laughs) Look, all I want to do is go home and curl up on the couch. And I know that if you take any more work home, that is not going to happen. So, please, do the world a favor and take your loopy girlfriend home?", "Bill: You just don't know when to quit, do you?", "Eden: Nope.", "Bill: No. All right, here's the deal: I've got to finish this report when we get home for Josh, okay? And, after that, I am all yours.", "Eden: No more ledgers or reports?", "Bill: No, I got everything I need right here.", "Eden: Hallelujah.", "Bill: Yeah. Come on.", "Eden: Yeah. Out.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Hi. I know what you're going to say, all right? And I'm late. I know, I'm very late, but there was something that I had to do that was really important. And I did it. And everything's fine. In fact, it's better than fine. So where is she?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: I just want to caution you, Miss Carrie. From here on out, I'll handle things, okay? Because from here on out, things could get a little tricky and a little dangerous.", "Carrie: You handle the Spauldings. Everything else is mine.", "Jeffrey: This is not a request.", "Carrie: Oh, I see. She who calls the DA does not get to call the shots.", "Jeffrey: I understand your need for some sort of vengeance here...", "Carrie: Oh, please, Mr. O'Neill, no one will ever know, I assure you. And when they do, it'll be too late.", "Jeffrey: Just so you know -- I'm warning you now, okay? -- This is my jurisdiction, and if you cross over the line, I will stop you.", "Carrie: I think it's time for you to go, Mr. O'Neill.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, it's me. You're not going to believe this, but a big piece of the puzzle just fell into my lap. I think it's time you pay us a visit. No, no, I can't. I got too much on my plate. You're going to have to come to us.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: I don't know what you're thinking right now. But I just really, really hope that you don't hate me. Daddy, I am so sorry for everything that I did. And I know that I hurt you in what I did, and it ended up hurting me, too. But I promise you, I promise I'm going to make up for it, okay? Mommy and I are going to take care of you now, all right?", "Phillip: Lizzie's my little girl. Lizzie will always be my little girl.", "Lizzie: (Crying) It's going to be okay, Daddy, okay? All three will be okay.", "Olivia: It's Mommy's sweet, little, sleeping angel. Yeah. She's so beautiful, huh? I think I just saw a little smile. Hello, baby. Hello, sweet girl.", "Phillip: Next on Guiding Light", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Come on, let's go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: What?
