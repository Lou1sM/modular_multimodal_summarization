        "Harley: You can do this. I thought you just said you could do this?",
        "Alan-Michael: Cornell, you've been on the board as long as my father. Me? I'm crazy about Harley. And hey, she served the company well, but now it's time to move on.",
        "Harley: I'm back.",
        "Alan-Michael: I have to run, so can I count on your support. Thank you. Hey, you. I didn't think you'd be coming in.",
        "Harley: Well, I just couldn't stay away. So what am I working on?",
        "Alan-Michael: I thought you were working on finding Gus?",
        "Harley: I am. In the meantime, you're in my chair.",

        "Mel: Hey you two, you ready to go. Now, remember what I said, okay? Be respectful, be quiet, and look innocent. We'll get you through this. Are you listening, Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Mel, thank you again for changing your mind and deciding to take our case.",
        "Mel: Your mom made the situation very clear.",
        "Jonathan: What did she say?",
        "Mel: Cassie doesn't look at what is going on between you two, and neither do I, for the record, but we don't have to care about that right now. All Cassie wants is for her daughter to be safe and free, and I'm going to make that happen. And I guess you get to come along for the ride.",
        "Tammy: Really? Mom's not going to bust into the courtroom and testify against him?",
        "Jonathan: I guess not. I think Cassie has her own things to worry about.",

        "Jeffrey: I'm going to do everything I can-- everything in my power to protect Tammy.",
        "Reva: And Jonathan.",
        "Jeffrey: This District Attorney's office has nothing against Jonathan, but my top priorities are Cassie and Tammy.",
        "Reva: Is Cassie coming today?",
        "Jeffrey: No. She has conflicting problems about Tammy and Jonathan. I thought it would be better to spare her.",
        "Reva: Right. Don't want to make the situation any worse than it already is, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Do you? Tammy and Cassie need each other. With Jonathan around--",
        "Reva: I know.",
        "Jeffrey: I just want Cassie to have a chance with her daughter.",

        "Cassie: I don't care, I have to know the truth.",

        "Cassie: Thank you for looking out for my little girl.",
        "Jeffrey: Of course. Are you all right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah-- no, I'm fine. But I remembered that I... I promised Will that I would come see him in a play he's in school in San Cristobel. I hate to leave right now, but I promised him.",
        "Jeffrey: Wow. Sure, go ahead. Maybe it'll do you some good. I can't go with you.",

        "Jeffrey: Okay, be safe.",

        "Jonathan: I still don't understand why you won't let me testify.",
        "Mel: Bad idea.",
        "Jonathan: Bad idea? If I just told them that the fire was an accident and also that Tammy had nothing to do with the fire, then it would solve the whole problem, wouldn't it? We would at least get her off.",
        "Doris: Miss Winslow...",
        "Tammy: Hello, Ms. Wolfe. You must be--",
        "Doris: I'm prosecuting your case.",

        "Doris: Tammy, wait. Look, you're smart, you're pretty, you're from a good family.",
        "Tammy: What's your point?",
        "Doris: Look, you have never been in serious trouble in your life. You're one of the good guys. And believe me, in my line of work, we don't make it a habit of going after people like you, especially when they make a mistake.",
        "Tammy: If you don't want to prosecute, then drop the charges and leave us alone.",
        "Doris: See, that's the problem: The \"us.\" Jonathan Randall is not one of the good guys. Trouble seems to follow that boy wherever he goes. I'm willing to make you a deal. You give him up, you're free and clear.",

        "Doris: Hi, Mel. How's Rick? How are the kids?",
        "Tammy: It is good that you showed up, Mel. Now my lawyer can hear me tell you. No deal. Jonathan and I are in this together.",
        "Doris: How sweet. Then you can write to each other in jail.",
        "Jonathan: All right, wait. We both know that's it me you really want, so...",
        "Doris: Oh, sorry, Jonathan, I'm in a committed relationship, and clearly so are you. So you'll both be tried and convicted together. I'll see you in court.",

        "Marina: Yeah, got to do something.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I know what you mean. I've been trying to track down all those crackpots calling the hotline. Looks, like it's going to pay off like that list of Alan's properties.",
        "Marina: Yeah, I know. I just keep thinking, you know, what if he's desperate? You know, he has nowhere else to go? He slips up. I've got places on this list the F.B.I. Doesn't even know about.",

        "Frank: Oh, great.",

        "Harley: Don't do this.",
        "Alan-Michael: I mean, is running Spaulding actually more important than everything you've gone through with Gus?",
        "Harley: This is about Gus, okay? This is all about Gus. This is about love and faith and all of those things that people wish they had. Well, I do have them. And in honoring that love, I need to live my life. I need to live the life he would a wanted me to... to live.",

        "Mallet: I'm afraid you do, missy. Whew, you probably have a busy day like myself. You've got to go to the office and stuff. It is too bad, because otherwise... Dinah:( Laughing ) Oh, you have to go?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm afraid I do. Unless... I know we're both kind of busy, but maybe-- well, maybe take the morning off and have breakfast with me.",
        "Dinah: I can do that. I can do that. What is it about a guy in jeans without a shirt on?",
        "Mallet: Hmm. I don't know. What is it about a beautiful woman wrapped in nothing but a sheet fresh off the bed?",
        "Dinah: Do you think maybe we should go take a shower?",
        "Mallet: Definitely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Forget I said that. I didn't mean to make it sound like Gus wasn't coming back to me or whatever, because he is. Because I know he is. I can feel that in my heart, in my soul.",
        "Alan-Michael: Of course. Listen, I understand that you want to lose yourself in all of this.",
        "Harley: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Alan-Michael: If you want to take command again, it's fine. But why don't you just leave some of the boring stuff to me. I'll just take these reports I was working on.",
        "Harley: Alan-Michael, why don't you just take the rest of the day off. You deserve it.",

        "Mallet: You grabbed me, ripped my jeans off, I felt violated. Coffee?",
        "Dinah: Cream and sugar, please. You weren't exactly fighting me, you know that.",
        "Mallet: You're very strong for your size.",
        "Dinah: I know.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey. Where did the hives go? It's a good look.",
        "Dinah: Oh. ( Laughs nervously ) Well sleep and a few shots will do wonders. Um... listen, about last night, you know allergies can do funny things to a girl.",
        "Alan-Michael: And a face. Listen, Harley's come back in the office.",
        "Dinah: Really?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, with everything going on, Gus still missing, and my father's possible involvement, I think it is too soon for her to get back to work. Don't you?",

        "Mallet: I ain't got nothing.",
        "Frank: Come back to the force, okay? Listen, hey! You can help try to solve cases while still helping Harley and Gus. And guess what? And you can get your badge back. Huh? Come on.",
        "Mallet: Frank, I made my choice. I'm not coming back to the force until Gus comes home, or Harley gives up.",

        "Harley: I'm busy.",
        "Gus: Too busy for me.",

        "Harley: Are they giving awards for that now?",
        "Gus: I think they should. I see you're busy here.",
        "Harley: Are you okay?",
        "Gus: Sure.",
        "Harley: I try to do what you would want, you know, getting on with things, but I woke up crying this morning because I miss you so badly. I miss the feeling of your skin next to mine. I miss you grabbing me in the middle of the night. I miss your breath on the back of my neck. You're the only person that I know wakes up with good morning breath. Is that because you love me so much?",
        "Gus: It's because I take a breath mint before I wake up. But I miss your love.",
        "Harley: I'm trying to stay busy here, but I'm barely holding it together.",
        "Gus: Well, you stay strong. You stay strong because women are stronger than men, and everybody knows that, but you didn't hear those words out of my mouth.",
        "Harley: That's a total crock because you're the one with faith. That's why I know you'll come back to me.",
        "Gus: Don't ever doubt that.",

        "Gus: Just look up. I'll be there; I'll be there to help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: This isn't an easy choice, I know. Harley's been an asset. She can still be one in another capacity, but this is about the mission of our corporation. We're not a non-profit-- I'm sorry, can I get right back to you? Thanks a lot.",
        "Marina: Oh, I was going to sneak up on you and surprise you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Eyes in the back of my head. It's genetic, a Spaulding thing.",
        "Marina: So, why aren't you at work?",
        "Alan Michael: Harley came back.",
        "Marina: She didn't give up looking for Gus, did she?",
        "Alan-Michael: No, she's going to try to do both, somehow. Any luck on that list of Alan's properties I gave you?",
        "Marina: I don't know, I've got feelers out in all of them. I'm offering rewards to anyone-- gardeners, a security guard, anyone who might have even seen him. Hey, when you're done with your call, why don't you come in for lunch. I'm free.",
        "Alan-Michael: Okay. It's me. Has Marina Cooper called you about my father? Good. I need a favor. Call her back and tell her you spotted Alan. And make it sound convincing.",

        "Jonathan: Yeah. Could we just have a minute alone first?",

        "Jonathan: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Jonathan: Look, if you walk away from me, that doesn't mean you don't love me. I know you love me, but you have too much to lose.",
        "Tammy: The only thing I care about losing is you.",
        "Jonathan: Well, that sounds good for the movie of the week, but this is serious. Jail is serious. Yeah, you don't know what it would be like.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Reva: All bets are off, today. You two need each other.",

        "Jeffrey: Hey, you know, you've got a pretty good case against Jonathan Randall, but Tammy Winslow, she's a good kid. She as a good life ahead of her.",
        "Doris: I'm not so sure about that. I tried to cut a deal with her. She is too in love.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm not talking about cutting a deal. I'm talking about dropping the charges.",
        "Doris: You're the D.A.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it's not my call. I recused myself, remember?",
        "Doris: Hmmm, I guess you're kind of jammed up on this one then, huh? Life isn't always fair, is it? I mean, was it fair when I was shoved aside so that you could become District Attorney? A decision to this day I still can't get anyone to explain to me. No, it wasn't. I just had to suck it up. Which is what I guess you'll have to do in this case.",
        "Jeffrey: So you're going to prosecute Tammy out of revenge?",
        "Doris: No, but it is an added bonus. Look, I wanted Randall, she won't give him up.",
        "Bailiff: All rise. Honorable Judge Packard residing. Be seated. Case number 76592. People versus Tammy Winslow and Jonathan Randall. The charges are as follows: Arson, assault, criminal trespassing.",

        "Josh: It's not too late to change your mind.",
        "Cassie: No. You know how in life there are some things you just have to do? This is one of them. I just hope I can keep myself from scratching the man's eyes out.",
        "Josh: Remember this, when you're in that room, you are in control, not him. He still loves you.",

She is able to let her hair down with Jeffrey in way she wasn't able to do with Richard, so... I find her very natural and real and... I like to persevere and I keep trying. I love the less is more about him. I love that. See Cassie and Jeffrey Wednesday on January 25th, inside \"The Light\".",

        "Edmund: You don't know how happy I am that you've come back.",
        "Cassie: I haven't come back, Edmund. I'm just here to ask you some questions.",

        "Josh: I told her everything I could.",
        "Edmund: And you've come to me to fill in the blanks.",
        "Cassie: Would it be possible for you to do one decent thing in your life?",
        "Edmund: Oh, my goodness. Is this my big chance to make everything right?",
        "Cassie: I want the truth, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: You need the truth, Cassie. It's not the same thing as wanting it.",
        "Cassie: What difference does it make? Will you stop playing games?",
        "Edmund: Me? No, I'm sorry. That honor goes to the great and powerful Jeffrey O'Neill. He's been lying to you far more than I ever did.",
        "Cassie: Well, I find that very hard to believe.",
        "Edmund: Well, I always knew that you would. That face comes in terribly handy. But that doesn't change the truth of the matter.",
        "Cassie: And what is the truth, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: That Jeffrey has been lying to you from the first moment he met you, and I don't mean in Springfield.",
        "Cassie: But I only met Jeffrey when he came to Springfield.",
        "Edmund: No. Sorry, my love. You met him long before that.",

        "Doris: And so the people will prove the defendants did indeed set the fire in question and that a woman was injured because of it. Mr. Randall has a history of reckless behavior. He has a history of public commotion. He has a history where suspicious fires were involved. And Miss Winslow, who seems like an upstanding citizen, nonetheless became involved with Mr. Randall...",
        "Mel: So, your honor, there is no evidence that a fire was started deliberately. This was an unfortunate accident to be sure, but nothing more.",
        "Frank: After investigating the scene, we decided to keep the case open.",
        "Doris: Because it was obvious it was a case of arson. Is that correct?",
        "Frank: Yes, arson was a possibility.",
        "Doris: Chief Cooper, Mr. Randall assaulted a police officer while in custody. Is that correct?",
        "Frank: That is correct.",
        "Doris: Did you know that Mr. Randall was a violent offender when you arrested him?",
        "Mel: Is it true that one of your officers manhandled Miss Winslow? Chief Cooper?",
        "Frank: I wouldn't say manhandled, no. Officer Jenkins was...",
        "Mel: Officer Jenkins. Is this the same Officer Jenkins who's come before the civilian complaint review board three times for excessive violence?",
        "Frank: Yes.",
        "Doris: You initially provided an alibi for your son when questioned by the police, an alibi that's now proven to be false. Is that correct?",
        "Reva: Well, I may have been confused about the correct times.",
        "Doris: This is not the first accidental fire involving Jonathan Randall, is it? I have an affidavit here citing several fires Jonathan Randall possibly was involved in.",
        "Mel: Your honor, she can't just throw out accusations.",
        "Judge: Continue, Ms. Wolfe. Just keep it tight.",
        "Doris: You are Jonathan Randall's mother by blood, is that correct?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Doris: Hmm. And Tammy Winslow's aunt, also a blood relative?",
        "Jonathan: Here it comes.",
        "Doris: Could you tell us the nature of the defendants' relationship to each other?",
        "Reva: I don't understand the question.",
        "Doris: Jonathan Randall and Tammy Winslow are cousins. Is that all they are to each other?",
        "Reva: That's none of your business.",
        "Mel: Your honor, I'd like to call for a brief recess.",

Okay, so this guy, who works for this contract developer down in Florida, says that he actually saw your father.",

        "Dinah: No what?",
        "Mallet: No, that's not what I'm doing it. Gus is my partner, okay? And I know we've had some rocky times in the past, but if he was my partner and I... you know, if I keep kissing you, I may actually end up liking you.",

        "Alan-Michael: Of course.",
        "Harley: So that would mean that I would need you to step in again.",
        "Alan Michael: Sure, no problem. Hey, good luck, Harley. Bring him back home.",
        "Marina: Okay, so I'm starting to think that this whole devil-may-care, playboy thing is just an act.",
        "Alan-Michael: Really? Because I've been working pretty hard at it for a lot of months.",
        "Marina: Thank you so much for everything you've been doing for my family. I don't know what we would have done without you.",
        "Alan-Micheal: You guys would do just fine.",
        "Marina: But with you we're doing a whole lot better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I don't care how many crew members you can get. I'll bring my own peanuts. Just make sure that puppy can fly. Thanks. Dinah!",
        "Dinah: Hi. You going somewhere?",
        "Harley: I just booked the Spaulding jet.",
        "Dinah: Very nice. Alan-Michael told me that you were back in the office. I was a bit surprised.",
        "Harley: I was back in the office, but I'm off again. Marina got a tip that Alan is in Florida.",
        "Dinah: Oh, whoa. Well, I mean you shouldn't be going down there by yourself I mean, did you call the F.B.I.?",
        "Harley: Well, I probably should, but they'd just tell me to stay home. And then they wouldn't return my calls for days on end and then I'd just end up feeling shut out. No, no, no. No, if this tip can get me anywhere near Alan and Gus, I'm going to move on it myself.",
        "Dinah: What about Mallet?",
        "Harley: Well, you know, Mallet's my friend, and he has been great through all of this. But I feel like we need to part ways for now because he's had enough of dealing with all my stuff, and he's got this life in Springfield now, and it's a good life, and I think he needs to focus on that.",
        "Dinah: You're a good friend, you know that?",
        "Harley: You are.",
        "Dinah: Let me go with you.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. If you want help, I want to help. How about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What did the judge say?",
        "Tammy: Ms. Wolfe can't ask those kinds of questions, can she?",
        "Reva: Mel, put me back up there.",
        "Mel: Listen, listen, all right? Just keep your thoughts to yourself and your mouths shut. Now, I know you just want to fix this, but last time I checked, I'm the only one here with a law degree here, so please. Reva, I need a moment alone with my clients.",
        "Jonathan: What about all the stuff that she said?",
        "Mel: Jonathan, you're not on trial for loving your cousin, okay? You both are charged with arson. And as much as I wouldn't mind giving you up to save Tammy, I'm your attorney, too, so I'm going to get you both off.",
        "Jonathan: But it doesn't look good, does it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Please tell me this isn't as bad as it seems.",
        "Jeffrey: I wish I could.",
        "Reva: Can't you talk to Wolfe? Jeffrey, you have to make this right before Cassie and I both lose our kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Doris, I want you to back off.",
        "Doris: I'm just doing my job.",
        "Jeffrey: No, you're not. You're trying to create a scandal. You want Jonathan Randall to climb over that defendants table and try to strangle you, but I'm going to beat him to the punch because I'm ready to strangle you myself.",
        "Doris: Well, what else is new?",
        "Jeffrey: Doris, I do not want Tammy Winslow prosecuted. I will do whatever it takes. So let me make you an offer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I want you to stop stalling and tell Cassie what she wants to know about Jeffrey.",
        "Edmund: All in good time. This is such a satisfying moment.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, what did you mean when you said I'd met Jeffrey before Springfield?",
        "Edmund: Look at the face, Cassie. Think about the face, the face of my dead brother, the face of your lost love, the face that has haunted us both.",
        "Cassie: Yes, and Jeffrey has his face. We've been through this. The entire town of Springfield has been through this. We've all... you know, this is pointless.",
        "Edmund: How do I put this? It was more than a coincidence that Jeffrey O'Neill reminded you of Richard.",
        "Cassie: All right, I know they took a photograph together...",
        "Edmund: Wake up, Cassie! They knew each other. Jeffrey O'Neill made a practice of knowing Richard, everything, his speech, his mannerisms, right down to the finest detail. Jeffrey O'Neill knew your husband. What I'm saying, Cassie, is Jeffrey O'Neill knew how to be Richard.",
        "Cassie: And when did he do this?",
        "Edmund: Many times. The ruse started innocently enough, in security, I suppose-- business, really. That's how it started, at any rate, but it ended up being something very different. It ended up being about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Have I thanked you for everything that you've done?",
        "Alan-Michael: At least ten times. Marina, I'm glad to do whatever I can. And I'd love playing hookie with you, but I really have to get back to the office.",
        "Marina: Oh, you almost made a clean break.",
        "Alan-Michael: Alas, duty calls. But I have a little surprise planned for our date later.",
        "Marina: You've already surprised me a lot.",
        "Alan-Michael: How's that?",
        "Marina: Well, everything you're doing for Harley, and helping her out over at Spaulding...",
        "Alan-Michael: All in a day's work. I made a pact with myself that when I came back home, I'd wear the white hat whenever I can.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, you've been a real sweetheart. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. See you later.",
        "Alan-Michael: Can't wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You know, Dinah...",
        "Dinah: Let me be your partner.",
        "Harley: ...I so appreciate you wanting...",
        "Dinah: Let me! Wait! Listen, let me be your partner. Let me go with you. Now, look, I don't want you to argue with me. I want you to know that I'm doing this for you and Mallet.",
        "Harley: Really, how's that?",
        "Dinah: You guys are my friends, okay? And it has been I don't know how long before I could say I got a few friends. You know, and you don't have to ask Mallet, but I don't want you going to Florida by yourself, and I want you to know you got me, okay? And I know that I'm thumbing through the manual of friendship for the first time, and I know I'm a little strange...",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Dinah: I know I am, but...",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Harley: Okay! Okay, listen, I was thinking about this actually before I agreed to let you come, but I want to pass it by you. I don't think we should be staying in a hotel. You know, we need to blend in. We need to look like locals.",
        "Dinah: Okay, all right, so no five-star hotels.",
        "Harley: No five-star. I was thinking I would stay-- and you tell me if you think this is weird-- in the house that Mallet and I shared when we were in Florida married.",
        "Dinah: No. I think... no, I love weird. I am weird. I eat weird for breakfast. No, no, I think it would be good. I think it would be good. When do we leave, boss?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Man. Hey, Frank, have you seen your sister today?",
        "Frank: No, I haven't. I've been at the courthouse all day. Mallet, I've been rethinking this situation with Harley. I think you should keep your distance from her. I think you should try to find Gus and Alan all by yourself.",
        "Mallet: All right. Well, maybe you're right, Frank. She's not making any progress anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doris: If you want to save Tammy Winslow, go ahead; make me an offer. But the thing is, you don't have anything I want.",
        "Jeffrey: Actually, I do have something you want. A job. My job.",
        "Doris: You can't be serious.",
        "Jeffrey: I will make sure that you become the next District Attorney in Springfield. I will step aside, and I will smooth things over with the Mayor. You drop the charges against Tammy.",
        "Doris: Deal.",
        "Judge: We are back in session, please.",
        "Doris: Your honor, after some consideration, the people have decided to drop any and all charges against Tammy Winslow.",
        "Judge: It is so ordered. Miss Winslow, you are free to go.",
        "Tammy: It's over. It's all over.",
        "Reva: Mel, what about Jonathan?",
        "Doris: However, the people will not extend the same consideration to Mr. Randall. The defendant will be pursued and prosecuted for the charges as they stand.",
        "Tammy: What? You can't! Did my mother put you up to that?",
        "Judge: Order!",
        "Mel: Sit down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey must have had his reasons for not telling me he may have known Richard.",
        "Edmund: May have known him, Cassie? You're missing the big picture here.",
        "Cassie: Well, if you've known this all along, Edmund, why didn't you tell me this before? Why didn't you tell me this when I still had feelings for you?",
        "Edmund: Really, Cassie, think about it. What would you have done if I had told you Jeffrey was capable of being Richard? I wanted you to love me. I wanted you to choose me.",
        "Cassie: I did choose you, Edmund. I chose you and you ripped me to shreds. You turned my life inside out. But just because you're capable of anything, capable of the worst, doesn't mean Jeffrey is.",
        "Edmund: Really? Remember when someone stole your identity? Remember how violated you felt? Hmm? Do you remember how incomprehensible, how strange it was to imagine that there was someone out there pretending to be you, someone out there who was living your life, someone out there was impersonating princess Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Dinah was responsible for that.",
        "Edmund: Yes, Dinah. Dinah played you. But who unleashed Dinah on you? Who had the influence to have her released from prison, to bring her to Springfield, to set her up in Springfield? Who do you imagine ruined your life in that way, Cassie? I'll give you a hint: It wasn't me. Yes, Dinah played you, but Jeffrey O'Neill was her Richard. So tell me, Cassie, what does that make Jeffrey O'Neill to you now?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Edmund: He will do everything and anything it takes to get what he wants, and that includes you.",
        "Reva: My son could go to prison, Jeffrey.",
        "Buzz: Or maybe you know you care too much about my daughter, and you're trying to keep your distance."
