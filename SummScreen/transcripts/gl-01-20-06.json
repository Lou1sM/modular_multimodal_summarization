        "Doris drops the charges against Tammy but refuses to do the same with Jonathan. Tammy wonders out loud if Cassie had anything to do with it. Doris calls Tammy to the stand to testify against Jonathan and Jonathan admits to take full responsibility if she will just stop hammering Tammy. Sandy interrupts saying that he was the owner of the house and that he knows what happened. On the stand, he admits it was actually his fault after getting angry by seeing Tammy and Jonathan together again. The judge dismisses the charges against Jonathan and Tammy thanks Sandy. Jonathan also thanks him but Sandy tells him that he owes him. Reva correctly guesses that Jeffrey had something to do with Sandy's testimony. Harley and Dinah discuss Mallet and Harley's past while in Mallet's house in Florida. Harley tells Dinah that they both are different people now and although he cheated on her, she doesn't think he would do the same to Dinah. A man shows up claiming that he gave Alan money, but when he asks for the money back in return, Harley throws him to the floor and tells him that Alan is claustrophobic and his story doesn't ring true. Alan lies unconscious on a floor somewhere. Edmund tells Cassie more about Jeffrey's past posing as Richard and asks her if he ever pretends to be Richard in bed. Cassie slaps him and Josh must pull her out of the cell. Jeffrey comes home from the trial and walks into a dark house to find Cassie waiting for him."

        "Doris: You want to save Tammy Winslow, go ahead and make me an offer. The thing is, you don't have anything I want.",
        "Jeffrey: Actually, I do have something you want. I have a job that you want, my job.",
        "Doris: You can't be serious.",
        "Jeffrey: I will smooth things over with the mayor. I will make sure you become the next district attorney of Springfield. You drop the charges against Tammy.",
        "Doris: Deal.",
        "Bailiff: We are back in session, please.",
        "Doris: Your Honor, the people, after some consideration have decided to drop any and all charges against Tammy Winslow.",
        "Judge: It is so ordered. Ms. Winslow, you are free to go.",
        "Tammy: It's over. It is over.",
        "Reva: What about Jonathan?",
        "Doris: The people, however, will not extend the same consideration to the defendant, Jonathan Randall. We intend to pursue prosecution for all charges as they stand.",
        "Tammy: No, you can't! Did my mother put you up to this?",
        "Jonathan: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: No, you can't. Jonathan didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Reva: No, I don't understand.",
        "Tammy: This isn't right, it's not fair.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, stop. It's over.",
        "Reva: Jeffrey, what about Jonathan? ( Gavel banging ) ( everyone talking at once )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: So you turned in your badge?",
        "Mallet: Temporarily, I just figured I'd be able to do more good working Gus's disappearance from the outside.",
        "Frank: Who was that on the phone?",
        "Mallet: Someone who owes me a favor.",
        "Buzz: You're going through an awful lot for my daughter.",
        "Mallet: Gus is my partner, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: No, I'm just being appreciative. Hopefully when she comes back she'll have good news.",
        "Mallet: Back from where?",
        "Buzz: Uh, nowhere. I... ( stammering )",
        "Mallet: Uh, Buzz?",
        "Buzz: Marina got a tip that someone spotted Alan in Florida. Dinah and Harley are going down there to check it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Oh, watch your step.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Whoa.",
        "Harley: Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Wow. So this is where you and Mallet lived when you were married?",
        "Harley: Yeah. You know, I was always planning to reupholster the furniture, so you know.",
        "Dinah: Harley. Come on.",
        "Harley: Come on what?",
        "Dinah: Stop being so cool. You know, I know that this place must have a lot of memories for you. I mean, memories of you and Mallet when you loved each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: So, who do you imagine is responsible for ruining your life? I'll give you a hint, Cassie. It's not me. Dinah played you, yes, but Jeffrey O'Neill was her Richard. So, tell me, what does that make Jeffrey O'Neill to you now?",
        "Cassie: Don't you ever get tired of lying, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Every word is true.",
        "Josh: All right. This... this was a mistake. I don't know why we thought we could get anything of value from you.",
        "Edmund: That's a good point, considering you're the ones who left me chained in here like a dog. Nonetheless, everything I'm saying is the truth.",
        "Josh: There's no reason to be here right now. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Edmund: It's the truth, Cassie. Who had the connections to have Dinah released from prison to set her up in Europe with the means of impersonating you? Jeffrey, Cassie. Jeffrey O'Neill, your knight in shining armor. He will do anything and everything it takes to get what he wants, and that includes you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Everyone talking at once ) ( gavel banging )",
        "Doris: I did my part, now you do yours.",
        "Jonathan: Yo, I'm keeping it down. Okay.",
        "Reva: You got her to drop the charges against Tammy, didn't you? Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know what you are talking about.",
        "Reva: No, I love Tammy, too, but you can't just leave Jonathan hanging. Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Excuse me, I have to take care of something. You shouldn't be in here.",
        "Tammy: This isn't right.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, you need to stop worrying about me.",
        "Tammy: No, they can't take you away from me.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, all that matters is that you're okay.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Jonathan: Yes.",
        "Mel: You guys you need to calm down and sit down, please. Okay? Your Honor, I'm sorry for the interruption, and we're ready to proceed now.",
        "Judge: I should hope so. All right, the people are ready to continue their case against Jonathan Randall. Ms. Wolfe, are you ready to call your next witness?",
        "Doris: Thank you, your Honor. The people would like to call Tammy Winslow to the stand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I got to say, it just like you never really left.",
        "Harley: I know. You know what, Dinah, this was all years ago. You know, Mallet is my past. Gus is my present and my future, Wherever he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Well, thanks for letting me know about the Florida thing, I hope it pans out.",
        "Buzz: Whoa, I just let you know that Dinah and Harley are going down to Florida without you, and you're just going to sit there and scribble? You're not going to ask me what the lead is exactly? You're not going to phone Harley and grill her? You're not going to get on a plane and go down to Florida?",
        "Mallet: I just thought I could do more good up here, you know. Harley's a big girl. She doesn't need to be dogged by me 24/7.",
        "Buzz: That never stopped you before.",
        "Mallet: You know what, Buzz? I don't know. Maybe I wised up. You know, maybe I can put my energy to good use here.",
        "Buzz: Or maybe you know you care too much about my daughter and you're trying to keep your distance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Look, you don't have to convince me how much you love Gus. And I know that you love Mallet in a very sort of-- a different way. And Mallet loves you in a different way, also, because you love Gus.",
        "Harley: Dinah, what are you saying?",
        "Dinah: I'm saying... I'm saying what you've been saying, that I feel that Mallet has room in his heart for me, and I'm really happy about that.",
        "Harley: I'm glad, because everybody deserves a chance to feel what Gus and I had-- have had-- have. What do I do? Here we are following this great lead and I keep saying things like have.",
        "Dinah: Well, you don't mean it.",
        "Harley: No I don't, because Marina's source said that Alan was spotted at the Pelican Club where we know that he has a condo.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, but he was found on the ground.",
        "Harley: I know what you're thinking, that Alan was hurt possibly seriously all the way up north, and here we are all the way here. What are the chances he'd be here? You think it's a bogus lead, right?",
        "Dinah: You know what? You're the cop, and a damn good one, and I'm here to support you.",
        "Harley: So, you think we're wasting time following a lead when they're probably a thousand miles away?",
        "Dinah: I think that Alan could be here, yeah.",
        "Harley: You know what I'm going to do when I find Gus? I'm going to smack him in the mouth because I don't know what he's thinking. Okay, so you want to be my big hero. Fine. That's fine, that's a guy thing, but you can't leave me a clue, just a hint where you might be just in case you don't come back. What is he thinking? I'm his wife. I deserve better than that!",
        "Dinah: Harley.",
        "Harley: Where is he? Dinah, where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: We can leave right now if that's what you want to do. You don't have to listen to him.",
        "Cassie: I'm not afraid of him. I'm not afraid of anything he has to say.",
        "Edmund: Always the warrior. And yet, always so trusting.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so Jeffrey knew Richard, maybe he even put on his uniform for security reasons.",
        "Edmund: Is that what they're calling it these days? He had Dinah released. He set her up in Europe as Princess Cassie Winslow. He taught her everything. Taught her how to dress like you, how to act like you. He put her up in the finest hotels. He gave her a diamond tiara, just like yours. An identical red velvet cape, you saw the damn thing yourself. She played you in Paris, London and Rome. Jeffrey and Dinah played prince and princess at your expense and they made quite a pair.",
        "Cassie: No. No way. He would have told me.",
        "Edmund: Of course he would have. Just as he has told you everything else about himself.",
        "Josh: Cassie.",
        "Edmund: Please. ( Laughs ) Please. I understand you don't believe me. Don't take my word for it. Ask around. Your friends, your friends in Washington, D.C., Ask them. As them questions. Ask Alonzo, but when you get your answers, come back. Come back and thank me for giving you the truth about Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doris: Ms. Winslow, you were with Jonathan Randall on the night of December 7th at 53 Duran Street when a fire started at that residence, were you not?",
        "Tammy: Yes, I was. But Jonathan didn't start the fire-- not on purpose. It was a complete and total accident.",
        "Doris: Oh. How does one start a fire of that magnitude by accident? And if it was an accident, why didn't you call 911?",
        "Tammy: Because we were scared. We thought we would get blamed.",
        "Doris: Oh, because you knew Jonathan had done something wrong?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Doris: So you admit it was okay, it was all right that he started the fire?",
        "Tammy: No. No, that's not what I'm saying.",
        "Doris: Oh, but you do admit that he did start the fire?",
        "Tammy: No!",
        "Jonathon: Back off, lady.",
        "Judge: Mr. Randall, sit down. Go on, Ms. Wolfe.",
        "Doris: Since you keep insisting Mr. Randall set the fire-- I'm sorry, I mean started.",
        "Reva: They're making Tammy incriminate Jonathan. And not only is it wrong, but it's going to kill her. It'll will kill both of them if he gets sent away.",
        "Jeffrey: I've recused myself, Reva.",
        "Reva: My son could go to prison, Jeffrey.",
        "Doris: Mr. Randall had a torch-...",
        "Mel: Objection!",
        "Jonathan: Would you stop putting words in her mouth!",
        "Judge:: Mrs. Bauer, control your client or I will have him removed from the courtroom.",
        "Jonathan: No, don't even bother. I'm going to end this joke right now. Tammy had nothing to do with the fire. It was all me, okay.",
        "Reva: Jonathan! Don't.",
        "Jonathan: No, it was me! It was all me. Is that clear enough for you?",
        "Bailiff: Order. ( Gavel banging )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Sorry, sometimes I think I'm losing it.",
        "Dinah: Harley, well, when you shoot somebody, that's when you lose it. And I've gone too far.",
        "Harley: Have we've reached that place where we can joke about Hart now?",
        "Dinah: Well, what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. No, I mean, you know that's why I didn't want to have anything to do with men. You know, I swore them off. Didn't want to get into trouble, and then that knuckle-head Mallet had to put his mug in my life.",
        "Harley: You really like him?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. We argue constantly.",
        "Harley: I noticed.",
        "Dinah: Actually, I enjoy arguing with him more than I like getting along with other people. That scares me half to death.",
        "Harley: Why?",
        "Dinah: Well, because. You know, I don't know all of the details of your divorce and all, but Harley, Mallet cheated on you. And on one hand, he's a great guy, but on the other, he cheated on you.",
        "Mallet: You are not the reason that you and I didn't make it. I am. I blew it. And I know exactly when it happened.",
        "Harley: You do?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. I was sleeping one night and I was watching you, and I realized how much I needed you. How much I loved you. And I got scared, and I ran like a little-- I ran like a frightened rabbit.",
        "Harley: That was a long time ago. We were very young, and we both made a lot of mistakes. And we're different people now.",
        "Dinah: Aren't we all?",
        "Man: Hello? Miss cooper? Miss Harley Cooper.",
        "Harley: Yeah, that's me.",
        "Man: I understand you're looking for Alan Spaulding. I think I can help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: That one's covered. That one's definitely covered.",
        "Gus: Look at you. You're so undercover I bet you wear sun block on your private parts.",
        "Mallet: You bet I do. Spf 30. Gus.",
        "Buzz: Did you say something?",
        "Mallet: Hell yes I said something. I said... uh, it's kind of cold out here, Buzz. Can you crank up that heat?",
        "Buzz: That's not how it goes. You should layoff that caffeine. It messes with your nerves.",
        "Gus: I'll say.look at you with your anal little lists. You're never going to find me like this.",
        "Mallet: Oh, man. I've got... I've got to switch to decaf.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Don't listen to him, Cassie. He's just messing with your head. He's already hurt you enough already.",
        "Edmund: Josh is right, Cassie. I have hurt you. I ruined everything between us, and now you hate me. But I still love you, and that's why I want you to know the truth about Jeffrey O'Neill. Because funny enough, he deserves you even less than I do.",
        "Cassie: Don't you dare compare yourself to Jeffrey.",
        "Edmund: You're right, I shouldn't. I shouldn't because I'm the better man. At least with me you know who and what I am. With him, no. He hides behind his law books; he hides behind his sappy love songs, and that absurdly groomed little 5:00 shadow of his. It's a carefully crafted image he's put together to keep you in the dark, to blind you from what he's really up to.",
        "Josh: Okay. All right. That's enough. We're going. Come on, come on.",
        "Edmund: Of course it's enough, because, Cassie, you know it's true. Deep down you know it's true.",
        "Cassie: I want to speak to Edmund alone.",
        "Josh: That's really not a good idea.",
        "Cassie: No, I'll be fine. Don't go too far, okay?",
        "Josh: I'm going to be right outside this door.",
        "Edmund: You believe me, Cassie? I can see it in your eyes. Suddenly Jeffrey O'Neill isn't looking so wonderful today.",
        "Cassie: Let me make something perfectly clear, Edmund. If you want me to lose faith in Jeffrey because you think there is even the slightest chance that I might let you back into my life, you don't belong in prison, you belong in a padded cell.",
        "Edmund: Ever wonder how far it went, Cassie? Jeffrey's impersonation of Richard? Was it just for show, events, functions, when you weren't there? Or did it go beyond that? Did Jeffrey pretend to be Richard when it was just the two of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, don't.",
        "Jonathan: Just let her off the stand. I can tell you what I need to know.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, please. Please be quiet.",
        "Jonathan: Look, I want to talk.",
        "Tammy: Stop it. Don't.",
        "Judge: Order.",
        "Tammy: He's just trying to protect me.",
        "Judge: That includes you, Miss Winslow.",
        "Tammy: It was an accident. Why won't anyone believe us?",
        "Judge: All right, that's enough. Mrs. Bower, apparently your client has something to tell the court. Do you wish to have him sworn in?",
        "Mel: No, not unless they've rewritten the fifth amendment.",
        "Jonathan: No, swear me in. I want to testify.",
        "Judge: Do you want to testify over your counsels objection?",
        "Mel: No.",
        "Jonathan: Yes.",
        "Mel: No he doesn't.",
        "Jonathan: Yes, I do. Yes, I do.",
        "Judge: Which is it?",
        "Bailiff: Your Honor.",
        "Jonathan: Yes.",
        "Judge: Young man, would you please take a seat. Did you hear me?",
        "Sandy: Yes, I did, your Honor. I don't mean to disobey you or disrespect the court. My name is Sandy Foster. I was purchasing the house that got burnt down. I know how the fire started, and I feel it is my duty to tell this court.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole and Bradley, inside \"The Light.\" Taking on the role of Cassie... personally for me it's an adventure. Cassie is a little bit black and white. I think she's an extremist. Jeffrey is definitely something to be reckoned. He's a handful. He's arrogant and he's kind of manipulative. Nicole is very beautiful. Bradley I find can be reserved. And she is very professional and she's very sweet. See Cassie and Jeffrey on January 25, inside \"The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Nice to meet you. Please. Thank you for coming.",
        "Man: Please, call me Archie.",
        "Harley: Archie, what can you tell us about Alan Spaulding?",
        "Archie: I was at the Pelican Club Resort this afternoon, and I overheard the concierge say someone was looking for Mr. Spaulding. The thing is, I just saw him last night. He was wandering around the grounds. He seemed, I don't know, disoriented.",
        "Harley: Did you talk to him?",
        "Archie: Yeah. He asked me if he could borrow some money. Given his reputation, I was kind of surprised, but then he said he was in an accident, lost everything.",
        "Harley: Did you give him the money?",
        "Archie: Yeah. I helped him out. And I also found him a place to stay. My buddy, he has this shed in the back of his place.",
        "Harley: Could you take us there?",
        "Archie: Yes, sure. Except... well, the thing is, my niece is getting married next week. I'm paying for it. The money I lent Mr. Spaulding was the money I saved to pay the caterer. If I don't get that money over to him by 5:00 today, he's going to cancel on me.",
        "Dinah: And now you don't have the money?",
        "Archie: You know, I figured a guy like Mr. Spaulding, I would get it back three-fold. Could you possibly reimburse me? You know for now? I'll run over and pay the caterer. I'll be back here in ten minutes and then we can go to the shed.",
        "Harley: How much?",
        "Archie: $3,000.",
        "Harley: Wow, $3,000. I did bring some money with me. I don't think it's quite $3,000. I have maybe two.",
        "Archie: That's fine, as long as you know, you can give me the rest tomorrow.",
        "Harley: Of course, that's not a problem at all. So this shed, it's small, huh? And kind of a dark place, I bet?",
        "Archie: Yeah, perfect place to hide out, exactly what Mr. Spaulding said he was looking for.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I bet. ( Grunts )",
        "Archie: ( Grunts )",
        "Harley: Archie, Archie, Archie. Why do you lie to me? Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I'm talking to you. Out of the two of us, I always thought you were the guy with more manners. If you want to find me-- and believe me, I've got my doubts that you do-- you've got to think like me. You want to show some respect, I'm a missing person for crying out loud.",
        "Mallet: Okay, fine.",
        "Gus: Good. Now walk me through it. What was going through my head.",
        "Mallet: You were thinking that Alan was going to get out and he was going to harm Harley.",
        "Gus: No, I knew that he was.",
        "Mallet: So you pose as limo driver and you kidnapped him. And you both were in accident and you were both hurt, but I don't... I don't know how you ended up disappearing from the crash site.",
        "Gus: Disappearing? Who am I, the Amazing Kreskin?",
        "Mallet: I don't want you--",
        "Gus: Are you going to eat that? Can I?",
        "Mallet: I've got a couple of theories.",
        "Gus: Good.",
        "Mallet: You killed Alan and you dumped the body someplace.",
        "Gus: Well I don't like him very much. I don't like what it stands for but no, he's my father.",
        "Mallet: You stashed him away. You put him someplace out of commission so he wouldn't harm Harley. You've got him... you got him in a psych ward-- some new psych ward.",
        "Gus: Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah and I'm the doctor. No, that's a little far- fetched don't you think.",
        "Mallet: Well, I got nothing. I don't know.",
        "Gus: Or it's what I tried to do. Or, it's what Alan tried to do to me. Maybe he got the jump on me.",
        "Mallet: Meaning... meaning that Alan-- if he got the jump on you, means you didn't get the jump on him. So you didn't kill Alan. Alan...",
        "Gus: Could be.",
        "Mallet: What if it's... what if this isn't caffeine? I mean, what if this isn't sleep deprivation? What if this isn't in my imagination? That would mean that you're...",
        "Buzz: You look like you just saw a ghost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Are you telling me there was never a time when you wondered, Cassie, thought to yourself, \"hmm, something about Richard seems so different today. He doesn't remember what I told him at dinner last night or that little inside joke we had. Why do his kisses feel so different. Come to think of it, why does everything else he does suddenly feel so...\"",
        "Cassie: You are sick.",
        "Edmund: No, Cassie. You're the one who's sick. You look at Jeffrey O'Neill and all you see is Richard's face. You see Richard's face; you don't see the monster...",
        "Cassie: Get off of me!",
        "Josh: Get your hands off of her!",
        "Edmund: Get off me!",
        "Josh: Get him out of here!",
        "Edmund: Fine, fine, fine, fine! Fine. Go home, Cassie. Go home. Go home to your imitation prince and just forget everything. Forget everything I said. Forget it, Cassie!",

        "Cassie: No.",
        "Josh: It was a mistake.",
        "Cassie: It's not your fault, Josh, I wanted the truth.",
        "Josh: All right, look. When we get back to Springfield, I'm going to start making some phone calls, okay? I'm going to start checking some things out, find out if--",
        "Cassie: No, Josh, there's only one person who can give me the answers I need now. Jeffrey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: He's coming after me.",
        "Tammy: I can't believe he would hate me enough to ruin my life.",
        "Judge: Please be seated and state your name for the record.",
        "Sandy: Sandy Foster.",
        "Doris: Mr. Foster, you say you were in attorney review for the house on 52 Duran Street, the house where the case arson took place. What's left of it anyway.",
        "Sandy: Yes.",
        "Mel: Alleged arson, your Honor. The fire was an accident.",
        "Judge: It's duly noted. You may continue, Ms. Wolfe.",
        "Doris: You say you know how the fire started?",
        "Sandy: Yes, I do. I was there that night.",
        "Jonathan: He's lying.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan and I were alone.",
        "Mel: Okay, don't worry, I'm going to get him in cross.",
        "Sandy: I was buying the house for her as a wedding present. I thought it would make her happy. All I ever wanted to do was make Tammy happy. But then she changed her mind and said she didn't want to be with me anymore. She wanted to be with Jonathan. Well, that was very hard for me to accept and I kept hoping that some day she'd change her mind, we'd get back together and live together in that house. So I guess you could say that the house became sort of a symbol.",
        "Mel: Your Honor, I really don't see how any of this is relevant.",
        "Judge: I'm beginning to wonder the same thing, myself. Would you please answer Ms. Wolfe's question? How did the fire get started?",
        "Sandy: Well, that night, I saw Tammy and Jonathan running away from the house.",
        "Doris: Running away? After Mr. Randall set the fire? You saw him set the fire? Mr. Foster, you saw Mr. Randall set the fire?",
        "Sandy: It's no secret that I dislike Mr. Randall. And wouldn't mind pinning this on him. But the truth is, if anyone is responsible for that fire, it's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: A small dark shed, please, Alan Spaulding is claustrophobic.",
        "Archie: Now, that you mentioned it, he did seem a little green around the grill.",
        "Harley: Shut up. You're not even a good liar.",
        "Archie: Could you get off me, lady, I can't breathe.",
        "Harley: Oh, that's such a shame.",
        "Archie: Okay, okay. I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you the truth. Yes, okay. I lied to you. But you have to understand why. Not a word for over a year, I have a wife, five kids, one of them needs a major operation. Okay, okay, one wife and a pomeranian, but they have very expensive tastes.",
        "Harley: Get out. Get out, get out!",
        "Dinah: That was good, we took care of him!",
        "Harley: We're not closer to finding Alan than before that guy showed up, though.",
        "Dinah: You want another beer? Okay. Good work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doris: Randall chose it as a target?",
        "Sandy: No.",
        "Jonathan: He's up to something.",
        "Sandy: I mean, I'm the one who did the damage, not Jonathan.",
        "Doris: Your Honor, Mr. Foster is obviously confused.",
        "Reva: Did you know about this?",
        "Jeffrey: Hang on a second.",
        "Mel: She didn't think he was confused when she put him on the stand, judge.",
        "Judge: Go ahead, Mr. Foster, tell us what happened that night.",
        "Sandy: As I was approaching the house that night, I saw Tammy and Jonathan running away from it. I thought this was a bit weird, so I went to check things out, and the first thing I saw was a fire that someone had put out-- or at least I thought they had. And standing there in my house, seeing this pile of ashes, and having just seen Tammy and Jonathan together again, I got a little upset. And suffice it to say, I ended up throwing a poker in the fireplace, and went to check the rest of the house out, to see if it was all right. By the time I got back to the living room, I was shocked to see that the rug was on fire. And not just smoldering, flames were shooting up, and I quick grabbed the cover from the coach to smother it, and it caught fire, too, and I freaked. And I'm not proud of it, but I couldn't think of anything but to get out of there, and I just left the place, and it was still burning. I know that I should have said something earlier, and I apologize for that. the truth is, I enjoyed watching Jonathan sweat it out. But I can't let him go to prison for something he didn't do. Jonathan did not purposely set that house on fire. It was just a bizarre set of circumstances, and it's really no one's fault.",
        "Mel: Your Honor, given this new set of evidence, I ask that you drop the charges against my client and dismiss the case.",
        "Doris: Your Honor, I have series doubts about Mr. Foster's testimony.",
        "Mel: You should have thought about that before you put him on the stand.",
        "Judge: Mr. Foster, is the testimony you just gave this court true?",
        "Sandy: Absolutely true, your Honor.",
        "Judge: Thank you. You may step down. Mr. Randall, I hereby dismiss the case against you. You are free to go. This court is adjourned.",
        "Tammy: It's over. You're free! Oh, what would I have done without you? I couldn't breathe.",
        "Jonathan: I don't have anything without you.",
        "Doris: This changes nothing. We still have a deal?",
        "Reva: A deal? What kind of deal?",
        "Jeffrey: Beats me.",
        "Reva: No, this has your hand all over it. First you got Doris to drop the charges against Tammy, then you got Sandy to lie on the stand.",
        "Jeffrey: I am an officer of the court. I can assure you that I did not advise Sandy to perjure himself.",
        "Reva: Well, you wouldn't have to, not directly. But you took Sandy out to the hallway for a little talk.",
        "Sandy: Jeff, I had every right to be in there like anyone else.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah. And when Jonathan is hauled off to prison, you'll be there to help Tammy pick up the pieces. Is that it? Is that how it works? You think she's going to come back to you, then?",
        "Sandy: Maybe.",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe. With Jonathan off playing the martyr? She's going to want him more than ever. Sandy, if you want to win Tammy's heart back, you have to be everything that Jonathan is not.",
        "Sandy: Meaning?",
        "Jeffrey: Meaning truly good, truly heroic, ready to sacrifice your own hopes and dreams for Tammy's happiness.",
        "Sandy: Okay. All right. Well, how do you propose I do that?",
        "Jeffrey: That's up to you. But I will tell you this, if you know anything that can get Jonathan off the hook right now, it's a good time to come forward. You give me way too much credit, Reva.",
        "Reva: I don't think so. Thank you. That was close.",
        "Tammy: Excuse me. There's um... there's something! I have to do. Sandy. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Kind of funny, there's snow on the ground back home.",
        "Harley: What if Gus is out there freezing in it?",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what? There aren't a lot of things I know, believe me, but I do know that Gus loves you with his whole heart and his whole soul and he's trying to find his way back to you as quickly as he can.",

        "Buzz: You done?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, thanks, Buzz. Buzz?",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Do you believe in ghosts?",
        "Buzz: Oh, yeah, I have a closet full of them.",
        "Mallet: No, those are skeletons, I mean ghosts. You know, like real ghosts.",
        "Buzz: I haven't given it much thought, why?",
        "Mallet: Uh... nothing. No reason. I've always been kind of a rational guy, you know. I believe in things that I can touch and things I can see with my own eyes. And I... I don't know, maybe there's just a lot of stuff that we can't explain, you ever think about that? Maybe some stuff that we just feel? Hey, thanks for the coffee, I've got to go. Thanks, Buzz.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I think Gus is out there. I believe he is trying to reach me. And he's trying to tell me something. I just don't know what it is.",
        "Dinah: Maybe he's down here in Florida, you know. Maybe he's even out on that beach somewhere.",
        "Harley: He's so close to me, I could almost... I could almost touch him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I don't know why you did that?",
        "Sandy: I care about you, Tammy. And as much as I think he is wrong for you, I know that it would tear you apart if Jonathan went to prison. I did this for you, not for him.",
        "Jonathan: Hey. Um, I don't know what that was about in there, but... thank you.",
        "Sandy: No problem.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Sandy:( Whispers ) You owe me. You two take care.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, you okay?",
        "Jonathan: Me? Yeah. It's great, it's great. It's over. Let's get out of here.",

        "Josh: The charges were dismissed?",
        "Reva: Yeah, against both of them. And it was all thanks to Jeffrey. He won't take any credit for it, but I hope Cassie is aware of what kind of a man she's got in Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Josh: I think she has a pretty good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, I hope you're awake because I've got some good news. What are you doing? Why are you in the dark?",
