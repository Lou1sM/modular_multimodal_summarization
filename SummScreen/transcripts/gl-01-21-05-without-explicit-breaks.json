        "Jonathan: (Groaning) This \r\nsucks. (Knock on door) Come in. Uh-oh. You better wait outside. Your Auntie Reva \r\nis not going to be back for a while. ",
        "Tammy: I know. I wanted to see you alone.",
        "\r\n****************************************",
        "Josh: So, how do you feel about a six-day workweek, Sandy? Hm? ",
        "Sandy: So none of that boring stuff like eating, sleeping, going home? ",
        "Josh: No, no, no. See, I figure I have to give Reva some time to play \r\nnursemaid to Jonathan, and if I'm there, I would probably strangle him. So I \r\nthink it's the best solution for everybody. ",
        "Sandy: Sure, if you want Jonathan to win.",
        "\r\n****************************************",
        "Frank: You guys all packed? All right, good job, good job. Now, who's ready \r\nto play some serious football, huh? ",
        "Marina: Dad, you don't look serious. You look homeless. ",
        "Frank: What are you talking about, honey? This is my good luck jersey. You \r\nknow I never wash this. ",
        "Marina: Oh! ",
        "Frank: I mean it's bad luck. ",
        "Marina: That's disgusting. ",
        "Coop: Frank, come on. I never took you to be a superstitious kind of guy. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, here I am. (Laughs) ",
        "Danny: Hey. How are you guys doing? Hey, Frank. What, am I late? ",
        "Frank: (Clears throat) Hold on, here. Are you playing? ",
        "Danny: Yeah. Yeah. Buzz invited me. Am I still invited? ",
        "Marina: Of course you are. Come on. Let's go. ",
        "Danny: All right. See you guys out there. ",
        "Lizzie: We are so excited. ",
        "Frank: Oh. Well, great. I can't wait. ",
        "Gus: You think maybe we could have met someplace warmer? I mean your Dad \r\nwould have been fine with meeting any place, you know? I mean I'm shaking here, \r\nfor crying out loud. ",
        "Harley: I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. I don't know. He just... He wanted to \r\nmeet here. ",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. Well, it's kind of fun. It's like the old days, on our little \r\nstakeouts that we used to have, remember? ",
        "Harley: Ugh. I couldn't stand you. ",
        "Gus: You loved me. You loved every minute of it. That's right. You heard me.\r\n",
        "Harley: (Laughs) Well, this may have to be enough. ",
        "Gus: Baby, you're not going to prison. You didn't kill anybody. And Beth, she \r\nknows. So all you have to do is stay on her a little harder, okay? ",
        "Harley: I hate this. You know, I hate putting the screws to Beth, or anybody. \r\nIt turns out I may be the shooter. ",
        "Gus: You're not the shooter. ",
        "Harley: (Sighs) ",
        "Gus: You hear me? You're not the shooter. ",
        "Harley: I can't handle false hope. Anything but false hope! And I will talk \r\nto Beth again, but only because I need to know. ",
        "Buzz: (Blows whistle) Hey. You guys need a referee. ",
        "Harley: Hey, Daddy. No, we're just, you know... ",
        "Gus: Bickering. Snickety-snacking. ",
        "Buzz: You need to use your energy for something good. How about Cooper \r\nfootball? ",
        "Harley: Now? ",
        "Buzz: I brought you a sweatshirt. The rest will be coming soon. ",
        "Gus: Oh... ",
        "Harley: Okay, I'm in. ",
        "Gus: No, no, no, no, no, no. Take a rain check. Mr. Cooper, give her a rain \r\ncheck because we've got work to do. ",
        "Harley: Oh, let's do it later, okay? My pretrial is tomorrow, I know, but \r\nthis could be my last time to really spend time with my family. ",
        "Gus: Fine. You play and I'll do the work, because I have no problem doing \r\nit... ",
        "Harley: Uh-uh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're playing. ",
        "Gus: No, I'm not playing. Look at the way I'm dressed. I've got... These are \r\nmy good shoes. ",
        "Harley: Okay, listen to me. Let's make it interesting, okay? You on one team \r\nme on the other. If my team wins, we handle the investigation my way. If your \r\nteam wins, I'll do whatever you want. ",
        "Gus: You'll do whatever I want? ",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. ",
        "Buzz: You can't pass up on that one, can you? ",
        "Gus: You heard what she said. \"Anything I want.\" All right, you got it, no \r\nproblem. Bring it. Bring it. Bring it. ",
        "Harley: Do you see it? Do you see it? Where's the ball? ",
        "Gus: I don't know. ",
        "Harley: Where's the ball? ",
        "Gus: Where could it be? ",
        "Harley: Huh, huh. Oh, my gosh. ",
        "Gus: That's it? That's all you've got? Are you kidding me? ",
        "Harley: (Laughs) ",
        "Gus: All right. So, I am choosing. First, I pick the cardiac kid! Come on \r\ndown, come on down. ",
        "Buzz: Oh, that's very funny. You know, you... (Talking at once) ",
        "Gus: Let's go. Let's go. ",
        "Frank: All right. All right, pop. ",
        "Buzz: Hit me. Hit me, baby. Hit me. ",
        "Harley: Wait, Frank. Um... ",
        "Frank: Captain Cooper is here. ",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no. There's kind of a change of plans this year. I'm \r\ngoing to captain one team and Gus is going to captain the other. But I get to \r\npick first, and you're on my team! ",
        "Frank: What? All right. ",
        "Gus: All right, okay. This is embarrassing. ",
        "Harley: Okay, your turn. ",
        "Gus: I got Santos, right here. You're on my team. ",
        "Harley: Okay, I'm picking... Where's Coop? Henry Cooper Bradshaw, oh, here he \r\nis. ",
        "Coop: Right here. ",
        "Frank: Do you even know how to play American football? With the hands and the \r\nfeet and... ",
        "Gus: Okay, let me think here. Who do I want? ",
        "Lizzie: Me. ",
        "Gus: This is so high school. ",
        "Lizzie: Gus! Me. I know football, and I don't want to be on her team. ",
        "Gus: All right, Lizzie, come on. Come on. ",
        "Lizzie: You know it's the quarterback's position to throw the ball to the \r\nhalfback, or make a forward pass. ",
        "Gus: Well, thank you. I will remember that. Now we all know that. ",
        "Harley: Okay, Marina, get over here. ",
        "Marina: What took you so long? (Applause) You are going down, Santos. ",
        "Frank: Good call. ",
        "Buzz: You've got three I've got... I didn't want to do this. ",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no, Dad. You're the ref. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, okay, this isn't really fair because you guys have four and \r\nwe have, like, two-and-a-half. (Laughter) ",
        "Alexandra: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Come on. I didn't get all suited up \r\nlike this, you know, for nothing. What's wrong with me? ",
        "Frank: What is that? (Laughter) ",
        "Harley: This is going to be so fun. ",
        "Gus: ...The set of a music video. (Talking all at once) ",
        "Frank: Okay, okay? You know what, Coop? Help me with the end zones, all \r\nright, pop? ",
        "Alexandra: What's the end zone? Where's the net? ",
        "Gus: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. ",
        "Harley: This is going to be so easy, I almost feel guilty. ",
        "Marina: You know, I really don't. The Coopers are due for a win. ",
        "Harley: Yes, we are. Okay, just cover for me, because I've got a phone call \r\nto make. ",
        "Marina: Yeah, no problem. ",
        "Gus: Okay, people. Before we start this and anybody gets hurt, we should talk \r\nabout a few things, okay? ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, right. Like how to keep our nails from getting broken. ",
        "Gus: Yeah, no, not like that at all. About the rules of the game, did I pick \r\nyou? Yes, I did. Stand behind me. Let's go. ",
        "Lizzie: That's not nice, Gus. ",
        "Gus: Let's go. ",
        "Harley: Beth Raines please, Harley Cooper. What? Well, where did she go? What \r\ndo you mean, nobody knows? No, no. No message, thank you.",
        "\r\n****************************************",
        "Sandy: I don't mean to tell you how to live your life, Josh, but you will be \r\nhanding Jonathan to Reva on a silver platter. ",
        "Josh: Sandy, you know I'm not going to let anything happen to Reva. ",
        "Sandy: Yeah? ",
        "Josh: But if I'm there, that house will turn into a war zone. Now, I'll \r\nfigure out a way to get rid of Jonathan, and in the meantime... (Door opens) \r\nHey, darling. ",
        "Reva: Hey, guys. What's cooking? ",
        "Sandy: I am back at Lewis Construction. ",
        "Reva: That's what I hear. ",
        "Josh: Here, Sandy. I want you to take this stuff home with you, take a look \r\nat it. Tomorrow, tell me what you think, all right? ",
        "Sandy: Done. ",
        "Josh: Thank you. ",
        "Sandy: I need to get some food, and I'm going to head out and meet Tammy. \r\nGood to see you, Reva. ",
        "Reva: You too, well he seems excited about working for you again. ",
        "Josh: Well, I hope so, because I'm going to put him to work. ",
        "Reva: Are you? Or did you just hire him to get back at Jonathan?",
        "\r\n****************************************",
        "Jonathan: Well, take off your coat. Sit. I won't bite... Unless you want me \r\nto. ",
        "Tammy: Why do you always do that? ",
        "Jonathan: Do what? ",
        "Tammy: Don't you ever think about anything else? ",
        "Jonathan: Well, they say the average guy thinks about sex about every ten \r\nseconds or so. I probably cut that time in half. How about you? ",
        "Tammy: With you? Never. ",
        "Jonathan: Ooh. ",
        "Tammy: I have plenty to think about. Like what you did to my Mom. ",
        "Jonathan: Really? What did she say? ",
        "Tammy: Nothing. But I can tell there's something going on between her and \r\nAunt Reva, and based on experience, I know it probably has something to do with \r\nyou. ",
        "Jonathan: Right, because I'm big trouble and everybody says so. But I think \r\nyou like that, even if you pretend you don't. ",
        "Tammy: We're talking about my Mom and your Mom. I know something is going on, \r\nJB, so tell me what you did. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay. But you're not going to like it. ",
        "Tammy: Go ahead. Talk. Tell me what you did to my Mom. ",
        "Jonathan: Are you sure you want to go there? ",
        "Tammy: Go where? What are you talking about? ",
        "Jonathan: So, how was the wedding? ",
        "Tammy: (Frustrated groan) ",
        "Jonathan: Ooh. We didn't get to talk about it when I was laying at the bottom \r\nof the stairs. Did you catch the bouquet? ",
        "Tammy: The wedding... You know, my Mom was late, and at first, everyone \r\nthought it had something to do with you. Did it? ",
        "Jonathan: Unbelievable. People are going to start blaming me when it rains.\r\n",
        "Tammy: I think you tried to mess up my Mom's wedding. She hasn't been herself \r\nsince. ",
        "Jonathan: You know, I noticed that, too. It's so weird. She always seems to \r\nhave everything together. Maybe that's just what she wants people to think, you \r\nknow? I get the feeling that she's one way in public, and then another way \r\nbehind closed doors. In fact, I know it. ",
        "Tammy: You were in the room that day. What did you do? Did you come back? ",
        "Jonathan: Now, what would make you think I would do that? ",
        "Tammy: Why not? That's it, isn't it? You're not only a freak; you're a \r\npeeping tom. Oh, where were you? Were you hiding in the closet? ",
        "Jonathan: Wow. You of all people should know I don't just like to look. ",
        "Tammy: I was stupid to ever think I could come talk to you. ",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Tammy? Sandy is not going to be able to make you forget about \r\nme. It won't work. There's no comparison. ",
        "Tammy: You're right about that.",
        "\r\n****************************************",
        "Josh: Reva, I hired Sandy because he's a good worker and because I think he \r\ndeserves a second chance. Don't you? ",
        "Reva: Well, you know how much I care about Sandy, but it's just starting to \r\nfeel like everyone's picking sides, you know? You and Sandy and Cassie and \r\nEdmund against me and Jonathan. ",
        "Josh: The only side I'm on is yours. I gave Sandy a job, that's it. You can \r\nthank me later, okay? ",
        "Reva: Okay. ",
        "Josh: Why don't you let me buy you dinner? ",
        "Reva: No. But you could come home and have dinner with me and Jonathan. ",
        "Josh: I have a mountain of work to do here. My thought was I would get a bite \r\nhere, and then I would head to the office and finish everything off. ",
        "Reva: Liar. ",
        "Josh: (Laughs) Reva, honey... ",
        "Reva: I thought you said we were in this together. ",
        "Josh: We are. I just have lots of work to do. That's it. ",
        "Reva: Okay. Well, I'm going to go pick up my takeout before it gets cold. \r\nYou'll be home later, right? ",
        "Josh: Right. Keep the bed warm. ",
        "Reva: (Laughs weakly) Great. Thank you. So, good luck with the job. ",
        "Sandy: Thank you. ",
        "Reva: I guess I'll be seeing you around. ",
        "Sandy: I hope so, you heading over to the office? ",
        "Josh: No, actually, I'm not. I have some things to do. There's more than one \r\nway to skin a stepson. (Cheering) (all talking at once)",
        "\r\n****************************************",
        "Danny: See, that's what we call illegal motion. ",
        "Marina: Oh, no, no, no, no. All is fair in love and football. You haven't \r\neven seen my illegal use of hands yet. (Laughs) ",
        "Gus: I need the ball. Hello. ",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Look, I am so sorry that you got sacked with such a crappy \r\nteam. ",
        "Lizzie: You know what? It's quite all right. We'll make back up. What's the \r\nscore? 14 to...? ",
        "Coop: Zero? Yeah. It's zero. I'll tell you what. If you need any tips \r\nwhatsoever, just feel free to ask, okay? ",
        "Lizzie: No, I don't think so. I'll find out for myself, thank you very much.\r\n",
        "Coop: Okay. ",
        "Lizzie: Can you believe the nerve of him? I'm sorry. As soon as I'm through \r\nwith him, I'm going to kick his butt back to England. ",
        "Alexandra: Darling, he's only trying to help. ",
        "Lizzie: No, he's not. He thinks I'm just this little wuss who'd rather be \r\nshopping instead of playing football. ",
        "Alexandra: Oh. ",
        "Lizzie: And the truth is, I would rather be shopping, but that's just beside \r\nthe point. ",
        "Alexandra: Okay. Why are you going to all this trouble? Aren't things going \r\nwell enough down at the restaurant, darling? ",
        "Lizzie: The Cooper's are just sitting there watching, waiting for me to fail, \r\nbut it's not going to happen this time, Aunt Alex. My Dad gave me that \r\nrestaurant. I'm not going to fail him. ",
        "Alexandra: But Lizzie, listen, darling. I really think... Never mind. \r\n(Laughs) ",
        "Marina: You know, watching you make nice with the lizard makes me sick to my \r\nstomach. ",
        "Coop: (Laughs) Don't worry. In a few days' time, I'm going to have little \r\nLizzie eating food right out of my hand like a lovesick bird. ",
        "Marina: You're cute, Coop, but not that cute. ",
        "Coop: You know what? I'm going to be even cuter--the cutest guy you've ever \r\nmet--once we own Company again. ",
        "Harley: Hey, Lizzie. ",
        "Lizzie: Hi. ",
        "Harley: Look; I know that things are kind of, you know, awkward, because of \r\nwhat people have been saying. ",
        "Lizzie: That's all right. Let's play football. ",
        "Harley: Yeah. I just want you to know, no one wants to find your father's \r\nkiller more than I do. I hope you believe that. And I know your grandfather \r\nprobably wants to hang me himself, and your mother... Where is your Mom, by the \r\nway? ",
        "Lizzie: She just needs some time alone, that's all. ",
        "Harley: Oh. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, let's play. Where's the sheepskin at? ",
        "Harley: Pigskin. ",
        "Lizzie: Whatever. I really don't care. ",
        "Buzz: Break's over! Come on! Let's get going! Go go go! ",
        "Harley: Your ball, your ball. ",
        "Gus: The break is over. Lizzie. I need you right here. (Talking all at once) \r\nokay. ",
        "Harley: Okay, okay. ",
        "Gus: 24. Hike, hike, hike. Go, go. (Players yelling) (cheers and groans) ",
        "Alexandra: I got it, I got it. I did. I did. ",
        "Gus: Are you okay? Are you hurt? Do you feel okay? ",
        "Harley: Just stop. ",
        "Gus: Did you hurt something? Does this hurt, when I do this? ",
        "Harley: A little, yeah. Ow. ",
        "Gus: Does this hurt when I do that? ",
        "Harley: A little. ",
        "Gus: I won't do that. Maybe you pulled a hamstring. ",
        "Harley: Maybe. ",
        "Gus: I think you should sit this one out. ",
        "Harley: No, I just... I didn't warm up enough. ",
        "Gus: I think you need to sit it out. In fact, you're benched. ",
        "Harley: You can't bench... Ow. ",
        "Gus: You're benched. You're benched. ",
        "Buzz: You're benched. ",
        "Harley: Benched? ",
        "Gus: He agrees with me. ",
        "Alexandra: Well, in order to make the teams fair, I think I should be excused \r\nfrom this round, okay? And if you know what's good for you, you'll agree. ",
        "Buzz: Yeah, I got it. Three on three. You're both benched. Come on, let's \r\nplay. ",
        "Gus: You're both benched. ",
        "Buzz: Let's go, guys. ",
        "Gus: All right. ",

        "Jonathan: So, you admit it: I'm everything that Sandy is not. ",
        "Tammy: Everything. You're selfish and rude and cruel, and Sandy's not. You \r\nlike to hurt people for fun; Sandy doesn't. You are a big loser and Sandy is \r\nalways there when you need him. He's loyal, and I trust him. ",
        "Jonathan: Are you describing a guy or a dog? ",
        "Tammy: I'm describing the guy that I want to be with. ",
        "Jonathan: No, that's the guy you wish you wanted to be with, but every time \r\nyou're with me, something happens, something chemical. ",

        "Tammy: It's your name. ",
        "Jonathan: No. You still wish I was that guy--not your cousin; just some guy. \r\nWhen I broke my leg, you stayed with me. Why would you do that if you didn't \r\nlike me? ",
        "Tammy: Because unlike you, I'm human. Okay, okay, so Aunt Reva had to give \r\nyou away when you were a baby. Big deal. I was in Foster care, and you don't \r\nhear me crying about it. You think you're so tough, but inside, you're just a \r\nbig blubbering bully. ",
        "Jonathan: Is that what you think? ",
        "Tammy: I think you're the one who can't let go, of your past and all the \r\npeople who hurt you, and the night that we spent together. You think it changed \r\nmy world forever. Well, you're wrong. You weren't even really that good. ",

What a cute dog! Hi. (Dog growls) Oh, you're so much \r\ncuter when you smile instead of snarl. Do you want to go see Mommy? Yes, you do. \r\nGo to Mommy. Go ahead to Mommy, sweetie pie. Go ahead.

        "Frank: Yeah, I know what you mean, pop. ",
        "Buzz: It's almost like everything is normal. No heart attacks, no murder \r\ninvestigations. Just the Cooper's playing for the stupid Cooper bowl. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, unfortunately, according to Jeffrey O'Neill, this could be \r\nour last big game. ",
        "Buzz: What does that mean? ",
        "Frank: O'Neill tried to offer Harley a deal, and Gus turned it down before \r\nthe terms ever even hit the table. I guess he refuses to believe that she's...\r\n",
        "Buzz: Guilty. ",
        "Frank: Yeah. O'Neill also believes that Gus is jeopardizing any chance that \r\nHarley might have. ",
        "Buzz: What do you think, Frank? ",
        "Frank: I don't know what I think, pop. ",
        "Buzz: No, the truth. Do you think she shot Phillip? ",
        "Frank: Dad, what worries me is that she doesn't have any memory of that \r\nnight. ",
        "Buzz: Me, too. ",
        "Frank: Hey, Dad? ",
        "Buzz: What? ",
        "Frank: Do you think she did it? ",
        "Buzz: I wish I could say no, Frank. ",
        "Harley: Whoops. Sorry. I was reaching for that thermos, and I knocked over \r\nyour bag. Sorry. ",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, well, it was zipped, so that's funny that everything fell out.\r\n",
        "Harley: Yeah. I don't know how that happened. What are you doing here? What \r\nhappened to the game? Aren't you playing? ",
        "Lizzie: Danny did one of those interception things, and we're on time out.\r\n",
        "Coop: Hey, guys, come on. What's the deal? What's the holdup? Are you okay? \r\nDid Roxy bite you or something? ",
        "Harley: No. No, no, no. She's so sweet, that little... No, I think Lizzie \r\nthinks I was going through her bag. (Laughs) ",
        "Coop: Well, were you? ",
        "Harley: Well... I'm so embarrassed. You know, your Uncle Gus is here, and I \r\nknow it's a football game, but how do I look? I feel like I look pale. ",
        "Lizzie: Well, next time ask. ",
        "Harley: I will. (Mockingly): \"Well, were you?\" ",
        "Coop: What? ",
        "Harley: She is wound so tight. ",
        "Coop: Yeah. No kidding. ",
        "Buzz: Come here a second. ",
        "Gus: Yeah? Listen, if that's about that last touchdown that was legit. ",
        "Buzz: This isn't going to work. ",
        "Gus: Listen, you've got to work with me, okay, because I've got the worst \r\nteam in football, here. I've got Alexandra. She can barely walk. Lizzie can \r\nbarely think. I mean... ",
        "Buzz: It's not about the game. ",
        "Gus: Oh. What's it about? ",
        "Buzz: It's about my daughter. I saw you with her tonight. I watched you. And \r\nI think I've come to a decision. ",
        "Gus: All right. What's the decision? ",
        "Buzz: I don't want you to handle her case. ",
        "Gus: Buzz; nobody cares about your daughter more than me... At least, nobody \r\nwith a law degree, anyway. ",
        "Buzz: What she needs is someone who's objective, someone who's free to use \r\ntheir brain as well as their heart. You're in love with her. That is bound to \r\ncloud your judgment. ",
        "Gus: My judgment is fine. I just have to prove that she's innocent. ",
        "Buzz: You want to believe that she's innocent. ",
        "Gus: I know that she's innocent. ",
        "Buzz: Damn it, she doesn't even know that she's innocent. ",
        "Gus: Listen, I will win this, okay? You have to believe in me. ",
        "Buzz: What's the plan? You win it, you're a hero, you ride off into the \r\nsunset with her? ",
        "Gus: (Sighs) The plan is just for me to prove that she's innocent. ",
        "Buzz: Gus, Frank told me that O'Neill offered a plea bargain and you wouldn't \r\nlisten. ",
        "Gus: I don't listen to things like that, not when my client is innocent. ",
        "Buzz: Tomorrow is the pretrial hearing. Time is running out. Things don't \r\nlook good. She has children that depend on her. She could lose them forever if \r\nthis goes wrong. ",
        "Gus: Nothing is going to go wrong. I'm going to bring her home, okay? ",
        "Buzz: Okay. I'll hold you to that. Be a lawyer. ",
        "Marina: I mean, the bears haven't had a decent quarterback since McMahon, and \r\nhe left the team in the '80s. ",
        "Danny: Man, a girl who likes football. Will you marry me? ",
        "Marina: (Laughs) Really? ",
        "Danny: Whoa! ",
        "Frank: Catch time's over. Let's go. Let's play some more football. ",
        "Marina: Dad, everyone else is on the bench. ",
        "Frank: Not anymore, they're not. Come on, everybody. Let's continue the game. \r\nAll right, Cooper's. ",
        "Danny: Let's do it. ",
        "Coop: All right, come on, guys. ",
        "Gus: Come on, everybody. Let's play the game. ",
        "Coop: All right. Come on, Frank. Marina, get the ball. ",
        "Gus: Coffee break is over. Is it their ball? ",
        "Frank: I'm ready. ",
        "Marina: Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready? ",
        "Coop: Ready, set, go. ",
        "Frank: Hey, hey, hey, hey. (Teams arguing) ",
        "Danny: Come on, Frank. What is your problem, Frank? What is your problem? ",
        "Frank: I'll tell you what my problem is. Get out of the way. I want you to \r\nstay away from my daughter. ",
        "Danny: Frank. ",
        "Frank: Anybody that's around you always ends up getting hurt, so stay away \r\nfrom her, you got that? ",
        "Marina: Dad, you are completely out of control. Come on. ",
        "Frank: Out of control? I don't think so. This guy took you halfway around the \r\nworld to go rescue his wife. ",
        "Marina: Dad, I... ",
        "Frank: You're not a soldier. You're my daughter. ",
        "Marina: I wanted to do it, okay? I wanted to go. Look, I love you, but... ",
        "Frank: You know if you love me, then you stay away from him. ",
        "Marina: Danny, I'm... I'm sorry. My Dad is just way overprotective. ",
        "Danny: Marina, don't apologize. Your Dad's got every right to feel the way he \r\nfeels, really. I mean, maybe hanging out with me is a lot more trouble than it's \r\nworth. ",
        "Harley: Guess what I scored. ",
        "Gus: Huh? ",
        "Harley: The phone number to a spa where Beth is. She skipped town. I say we \r\ngo find her. ",
        "Gus: Really? She skipped town? ",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Gus: All right. Well, we should do that after we prepare your defense for the \r\nhearing tomorrow. ",
        "Harley: What? No. We have to go get Beth. It's a hop, skip, and a jump over \r\nthe state line... ",
        "Gus: Over the state line? Do you hear yourself? Over the state line? What if \r\nyou didn't make it back on time? ",
        "Harley: Oh, please. I'll be back. ",
        "Gus: No, it's not going to be a problem, because you're not going anywhere, \r\nbecause my team won and I make the rules, and that's the deal. Remember? That \r\nwas the deal. There are no deals. ",
        "Harley: Well, can't we make another deal? ",
        "Gus: No, absolutely not, we cannot make another deal. ",
        "Harley: When did you get to be such a big pain in the neck? ",
        "Gus: I was always a pain in the neck. It's part of my charming personality.\r\n",
        "Harley: Fine. We'll handle it your way. ",
        "Gus: I'm not saying to talk out of the other side of your mouth. That would \r\nbe jumping bail. Do you understand me? ",
        "Harley: Okay, I get it. ",
        "Gus: No, none of the little lies. ",
        "Harley: I get it. Enough. ",
        "Gus: You want to work this case together? I have another lead that we can \r\npursue. ",
        "Harley: What lead? ",
        "Gus: Follow me.",
