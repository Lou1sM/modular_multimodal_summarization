Before we start this and anybody gets hurt, we should talk about a few things, okay? ", "Lizzie: Oh, right. Like how to keep our nails from getting broken. ", "Gus: Yeah, no, not like that at all.

", "Tammy: I have plenty to think about. Like what you did to my Mom. ", "Jonathan: Really? What did she say? ", "Tammy: Nothing. But I can tell there's something going on between her and Aunt Reva, and based on experience, I know it probably has something to do with you. ", "Jonathan: Right, because I'm big trouble and everybody says so. But I think you like that, even if you pretend you don't. ", "Tammy: We're talking about my Mom and your Mom.

We didn't get to talk about it when I was laying at the bottom of the stairs. Did you catch the bouquet? ", "Tammy: The wedding... You know, my Mom was late, and at first, everyone thought it had something to do with you. Did it? ", "Jonathan: Unbelievable. People are going to start blaming me when it rains.", "Tammy: I think you tried to mess up my Mom's wedding. She hasn't been herself since. ", "Jonathan: You know, I noticed that, too. It's so weird. She always seems to have everything together. Maybe that's just what she wants people to think, you know? I get the feeling that she's one way in public, and then another way behind closed doors. In fact, I know it. ", "Tammy: You were in the room that day. What did you do? Did you come back? ", "Jonathan: Now, what would make you think I would do that? ", "Tammy: Why not? That's it, isn't it? You're not only a freak; you're a peeping tom. Oh, where were you? Were you hiding in the closet? ", "Jonathan: Wow. You of all people should know I don't just like to look.

", "Josh: The only side I'm on is yours. I gave Sandy a job, that's it. You can thank me later, okay? ", "Reva: Okay. ", "Josh: Why don't you let me buy you dinner? ", "Reva: No. But you could come home and have dinner with me and Jonathan. ", "Josh: I have a mountain of work to do here. My thought was I would get a bite here, and then I would head to the office and finish everything off. ", "Reva: Liar. ", "Josh: (Laughs) Reva, honey... ", "Reva: I thought you said we were in this together. ", "Josh: We are. I just have lots of work to do. That's it. ", "Reva: Okay. Well, I'm going to go pick up my takeout before it gets cold.

I'll find out for myself, thank you very much.", "Coop: Okay. ", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Can you believe the nerve of him? I'm sorry. As soon as I'm through with him, I'm going to kick his butt back to England. ", "Alexandra: Darling, he's only trying to help. ", "Lizzie: No, he's not. He thinks I'm just this little wuss who'd rather be shopping instead of playing football. ", "Alexandra: Oh. ", "Lizzie: And the truth is, I would rather be shopping, but that's just beside the point. ", "Alexandra: Okay. Why are you going to all this trouble? Aren't things going well enough down at the restaurant, darling? ", "Lizzie: The Cooper's are just sitting there watching, waiting for me to fail, but it's not going to happen this time, Aunt Alex. My Dad gave me that restaurant. I'm not going to fail him. ", "Alexandra: But Lizzie, listen, darling. I really think... Never mind.

I just want you to know, no one wants to find your father's killer more than I do. I hope you believe that. And I know your grandfather probably wants to hang me himself, and your mother... Where is your Mom, by the way? ", "Lizzie: She just needs some time alone, that's all. ", "Harley: Oh. ", "Lizzie: Well, let's play. Where's the sheepskin at? ", "Harley: Pigskin.

I did. ", "Gus: Are you okay? Are you hurt? Do you feel okay? ", "Harley: Just stop. ", "Gus: Did you hurt something? Does this hurt, when I do this? ", "Harley: A little, yeah. Ow. ", "Gus: Does this hurt when I do that? ", "Harley: A little. ", "Gus: I won't do that. Maybe you pulled a hamstring. ", "Harley: Maybe. ", "Gus: I think you should sit this one out. ", "Harley: No, I just... I didn't warm up enough. ", "Gus: I think you need to sit it out. In fact, you're benched. ", "Harley: You can't bench... Ow. ", "Gus: You're benched. You're benched.

", "Harley: Touchdown.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "****************************************", "Jonathan: So, you admit it: I'm everything that Sandy is not. ", "Tammy: Everything. You're selfish and rude and cruel, and Sandy's not. You like to hurt people for fun; Sandy doesn't. You are a big loser and Sandy is always there when you need him. He's loyal, and I trust him.

(Groans) Why do you still call me JB? ", "Tammy: It's your name. ", "Jonathan: No. You still wish I was that guy--not your cousin; just some guy. When I broke my leg, you stayed with me. Why would you do that if you didn't like me? ", "Tammy: Because unlike you, I'm human. Okay, okay, so Aunt Reva had to give you away when you were a baby. Big deal. I was in Foster care, and you don't hear me crying about it. You think you're so tough, but inside, you're just a big blubbering bully. ", "Jonathan: Is that what you think? ", "Tammy: I think you're the one who can't let go, of your past and all the people who hurt you, and the night that we spent together. You think it changed my world forever. Well, you're wrong.

Hey, little Roxy. Hi, sweet dog over here. Let me just give you some air. You don't want to be trapped in there, now, do you? What a cute dog! Hi. (Dog growls) Oh, you're so much cuter when you smile instead of snarl. Do you want to go see Mommy? Yes, you do. Go to Mommy. Go ahead to Mommy, sweetie pie. Go ahead.

", "Frank: O'Neill tried to offer Harley a deal, and Gus turned it down before the terms ever even hit the table. I guess he refuses to believe that she's...", "Buzz: Guilty. ", "Frank: Yeah.

Aren't you playing? ", "Lizzie: Danny did one of those interception things, and we're on time out.", "Coop: Hey, guys, come on. What's the deal? What's the holdup? Are you okay?

I saw you with her tonight. I watched you. And I think I've come to a decision. ", "Gus: All right. What's the decision? ", "Buzz: I don't want you to handle her case. ", "Gus: Buzz; nobody cares about your daughter more than me... At least, nobody with a law degree, anyway. ", "Buzz: What she needs is someone who's objective, someone who's free to use their brain as well as their heart. You're in love with her. That is bound to cloud your judgment. ", "Gus: My judgment is fine. I just have to prove that she's innocent. ", "Buzz: You want to believe that she's innocent. ", "Gus: I know that she's innocent. ", "Buzz: Damn it, she doesn't even know that she's innocent. ", "Gus: Listen, I will win this, okay? You have to believe in me. ", "Buzz: What's the plan? You win it, you're a hero, you ride off into the sunset with her? ", "Gus: (Sighs) The plan is just for me to prove that she's innocent. ", "Buzz: Gus, Frank told me that O'Neill offered a plea bargain and you wouldn't listen. ", "Gus: I don't listen to things like that, not when my client is innocent. ", "Buzz: Tomorrow is the pretrial hearing. Time is running out. Things don't look good. She has children that depend on her. She could lose them forever if this goes wrong.

What is your problem? ", "Frank: I'll tell you what my problem is. Get out of the way. I want you to stay away from my daughter. ", "Danny: Frank. ", "Frank: Anybody that's around you always ends up getting hurt, so stay away from her, you got that? ", "Marina: Dad, you are completely out of control. Come on. ", "Frank: Out of control? I don't think so. This guy took you halfway around the world to go rescue his wife. ", "Marina: Dad, I... ", "Frank: You're not a soldier. You're my daughter. ", "Marina: I wanted to do it, okay? I wanted to go. Look, I love you, but... ", "Frank: You know if you love me, then you stay away from him. ", "Marina: Danny, I'm... I'm sorry. My Dad is just way overprotective.

I'll be back. ", "Gus: No, it's not going to be a problem, because you're not going anywhere, because my team won and I make the rules, and that's the deal. Remember? That was the deal. There are no deals. ", "Harley: Well, can't we make another deal? ", "Gus: No, absolutely not, we cannot make another deal. ", "Harley: When did you get to be such a big pain in the neck?

", "Jonathan: What? ", "Reva: Well, you feel trapped in that chair, so you're lashing out, you know? Reminding me of what happened with Josh. But you don't have to do that. You don't have to make someone else look bad to make you feel better about yourself. You should find a new way to express your anger, because manipulating people isn't going to get you what you want.

Well, your family had to love you, didn't they? ", "Sandy: They were traveling while I was at school. I felt like the poorest kid on the planet.
