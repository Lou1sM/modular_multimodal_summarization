        "Harley gets a surprise when she meets with Brad \u0096 who's arranged for a private party in a hotel suite for just the two of them. She manages to photograph something suspicious in his briefcase but is nearly caught when Gus calls and Brad goes for her photo-phone. Jeffrey provides an escape for her and Brad rushes home to keep Marie from getting suspicious \u0096 but Harley's near-romantic interlude with Brad has her feeling dirty and disgusting. She goes home and despite the guilt she feels, asks Gus to hold her. Tony finds the three men working for Lewis Construction he's suspicious about and confronts them about their ties to the mob. They try to stonewall but Tony has their number and warns them they'd best leave town. Eden wonders if the problem's been solved, but Tony knows its just beginning \u0096 and as he suspected, he gets a call from the boss, Bruzi. They arrange a meeting. Shayne's set Marah up with a blind date; he's a nice enough guy but doesn't stand a chance, especially when Jeffrey arrives at the same restaurant. She sneaks over to his table for some relief from her date, Luke, but gets a shock when Jeffrey's date, Miko arrives. She endures the rest of the evening as best she can but finally leaves, abruptly. Jeffrey's been affected, too; he tells Miko they need to take a break from their affair. Cassie finds Sandy watching tapes of Richard and he confesses she's the one who stirred his interest in the father he never knew. As they connect, she suggests he also find room in his life for his mother, Reva \u0096 but Sandy's hesitant and the surprising reason is his reluctance to have her find out how tough things were for him growing up. She's impressed \u0096 and thinks it's just the kind of thing Richard would do. They promise to continue this new connection, but Sandy continues to watch the tape of Richard with strong interest."

        "Cassie: Sandy Foster...",
        "Richard's Voice: Good evening. I've asked to speak with you, the citizens of San Cristobel, tonight, because I have news of vital importance.",
        "Cassie: Richard...",
        "Richard's Voice: Allow me to say that this is the most difficult thing I've ever had to do as your prince.",
        "Sandy: Stop the banging! Oh, hey.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Sandy: What's going on?",
        "Richard's Voice: I have thought long and hard about the potential consequences for San Cristobel and for the house...",
        "Cassie: Hi. Sorry, I... I came by and I just haven't heard his voice in a long time.",
        "Richard's Voice: I'm trusting the good judgment of you all.",
        "Sandy: I watch him sometimes. Judging from your reaction, I guess you don't.",
        "Cassie: Not in a while, no.",
        "Richard: ...Evidence which shows that I am not the hereditary heir to the throne of San Cristobel.",
        "Eden: I was looking around for you. The names you listed off Lewis Construction work roster...",
        "Tony: Yeah, the ones I didn't recognize, yeah. What's up?",
        "Eden: I checked around. It's not the first construction job that they've worked. And maybe they're just new.",
        "Tony: Okay, listen. Eden, I know that you want to prove Bill is innocent, okay? I know that. But don't ignore the fact... Look at me. Don't ignore the facts, all right? These guys could have been on the take with anybody before they got involved with Lewis. Now, you want to get to the bottom of it, right?",
        "Eden: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Okay. So now it's time to get in someone's face.",
        "Marina: Oh, come on. Is it really that bad? Look, Shayne just wants to see you happy, okay? So, can't you just pretend you're trying, for one night?",
        "Marah: Oh, there's no way I'm getting out of this?",
        "Marina: You should let people know that you're back out on the market.",
        "Marah: Oh, so I'm fresh meat for a blind date? Don't we have enough stuff to deal with right now? What's this guy's name again, anyway?",
        "Marina: His name's Luke Huff, and he was on Shayne's team in the minors.",
        "Marah: A jock?",
        "Marina: Well, yeah, but, you know, a really sweet jock. Oh, and his dad is Ricky Lee -- \"Don't buy a new car until you come see me!\"",
        "Marah: The car guy from TV? Oh, my gosh. Just shoot me now.",
        "Marina: Well, you know, if all else fails, maybe he can get you a good deal on a new car. I'm just saying.",
        "Shayne: You're just saying what?",
        "Marina: Hey, I'm just saying what a great time Marah's going to have tonight.",
        "Shayne: My friend, Luke, is really, really cool. Yeah. So, are you psyched, or what?",
        "Marah: Yeah. Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.",
        "Harley: Excuse me. I'm looking for a private reception in one of the suites. It's for Spaulding Enterprises.",
        "Towers' Employee: It's the first door on your right.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Brad: Harley, come on in.",
        "Harley: Mr. Green.",
        "Brad: Let me take your coat.",
        "Harley: Am I early? I thought you were having a party for some of your clients.",
        "Brad: That is the story.",
        "Harley: The story?",
        "Brad: The last time we met, you asked me if I knew the meaning of the word \"discretion.\" The answer is yes.",
        "Harley: So we're alone?",
        "Brad: Did I misinterpret? I presumed that our interest in each other was mutual.",
        "Harley: It is mutual. Give me that.",
        "Brad: This is a first for you -- an experiment. You're trusting me to lead the way. I'm honored.",
        "Harley: That's very perceptive of you.",
        "Brad: You know, in many ways we're both achieving a first tonight.",
        "Harley: And yet you bring your briefcase? Now, what is this? Is this some sort of Spaulding distraction in case I turn out to be a bore?",
        "Brad: This is a Spaulding Enterprises business affair, at least on the surface. But, you know, I hate the word \"affair.\" It's too puritanical. I prefer \"choice,\" \"curiosity,\" \"exploration.\"",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Harley: I... And yet you don't turn off your phone.",
        "Brad: I apologize. Oh, Alexandra.",
        "Harley: We both know who your real mistress is.",
        "Brad: Oh, my goodness. You have a mouth on you. We'll get to that.",
        "Harley: This is disgusting. This is disgusting. I want out. This is not... SOS. This is Terrier. SOS. I am stuck in a suite at Towers, 2687, with Green. I want out. This is not part of the deal. Look, his briefcase is here. There's something in there, and it looks good, and I will get it if I can, but I want out. You get me out of here now. 2687, Towers. What is this, Russian?",
        "Brad: All right, Alexandra. I'll get to it later on tonight.",
        "Harley: Go away, go away.",
        "Brad: Please, no more interruptions.",
        "Harley: Go away.",
        "Brad: I'm very busy tonight, at least for the next couple of hours. All right. I'm very sorry. What are you doing?",
        "Harley: I'm leaving. I don't wait for anyone.",
        "Brad: Oh, no, no. Don't leave. No, please. No. I'll tell you what -- I will definitely make it up to you.",
        "Eden: Hi, Nicky. How's everything?",
        "Gus: It's not a very good time.",
        "Eden: Fine. I was just leaving.",
        "Gus: Can I get a coffee, please?",
        "Buzz: Huh? Whoa! Look who brought a dark cloud into my place. You're not giving my kid a hard time, are you?",
        "Gus: No, it's nothing to do with her.",
        "Buzz: Because if you were, you wouldn't get much sympathy, you know? What is this, about something, like, who handles the remote, what kind of movie you're going to go see, stuff like that?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I wish I had troubles like that.",
        "Buzz: What are you doing here, you knucklehead? You should be home, you know, talking about whatever's bugging you to her. I mean, that's what couples are for, couples soon to be married, you know? They... one brings home the problem, the other one fixes it.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, that's not... no, no. Not this time. It's...",
        "Buzz: Why not?",
        "Gus: It just isn't.",
        "Buzz: Okay. Backing off. Just... you know, it's a first for you. You know, you and Harley talk about everything, and I just... but you want to probably fix this in your head first, probably.",
        "Gus: Do you ask somebody 20 questions with every cup of coffee you give them?",
        "Buzz: All right. Okay. Backing off. I'm going.",
        "Gus: It's just that I found something about Alan. It's rather disturbing.",
        "Buzz: Alan? Well, he's certainly no saint. What's he done this time?",
        "Gus: Lied to me. Granted, it was over something 30 years ago that he lied about, but he lied to me about a car going over Cutter's Bridge.",
        "Edmund: No, Dax, I'm not pleased. Dr. Lareina checks all available records, comes up with nothing, and then disappears. Quite frankly, it sounds like something I used to be involved in. Cassie has questions about the night she lost Richard's baby, and I owe it to her to find answers.",
        "Richard's Voice: ...Thought long and hard about the potential consequences for San Cristobel and for the House of Winslow. However, I feel that the only honorable choice for the country...",
        "Sandy: I got the tape of Richard's speech from the Internet. I guess it would be a shock to hear his voice. I can mute it.",
        "Cassie: If I seem, you know, a little freaked out, it's just... I haven't seen his face or heard his voice or anything since he died. And when I heard his voice through the door, I guess, you know, it just kind of rattled me a little, and... I remember this speech. I remember when we worked on it. He rehearsed it in front of me.",
        "Sandy: \"Let us not search for the faith to believe in a better day. Let us embody that faith as a truth in our lives every day.\" Is that kind of weird, me copying him like that?",
        "Cassie: No. No, it's a part of him that you have to hold onto, and I think that's great.",
        "Sandy: Good, because you started it, talking him up to me, taking me to see his grave. You made him seem real to me, and I bought the tape to make a connection, even if there can never be one. I'm sorry. Did you come by for something?",
        "Cassie: I've been avoiding you, and I really need to apologize.",
        "Sandy: No. Hey, I under...",
        "Cassie: No, I have. I have been blaming you for something. You're Richard's son who survived. Mine didn't. So, I guess I've been hating you for that.",
        "Luke: I know you think I'm just a dumb jock.",
        "Shayne: Nobody said that.",
        "Luke: All right, all I'm saying is I'm interested in other stuff besides baseball. You're into fashion, right, Marah?",
        "Marah: I'm \"into it\" would kind of be an understatement.",
        "Marina: Marah is a professional designer.",
        "Luke: Oh. Well, my point is I'm interested in that stuff, too.",
        "Marah: Really?",
        "Shayne: Bro, tell her about the uniforms.",
        "Luke: Oh, all right. So I was looking at our jerseys one day and I thought they were pretty boring looking -- you know, missing something.",
        "Shayne: Yes, they were. And so this guy goes out and he buys a bunch of these patches and he designs them like a lightning bolt.",
        "Luke: Yeah, like in the movie The Natural.",
        "Shayne: Okay, so it wasn't a runway show, wasn't a big runway show, but it worked.",
        "Luke: We went 10-0 after the patches.",
        "Shayne: Yes.",
        "Luke: Guess I had some mojo or something.",
        "Shayne: I need to go check on something, but I'll be right back.",
        "Luke: So...",
        "Shayne: I got it. I'm okay.",
        "Luke: ...You ever do something like that?",
        "Marah: What, have a mojo moment?",
        "Luke: Well, I mean, everyone needs something like that. It could be sports, relationships, whatever. Everybody's looking for a win.",
        "Marah: Right. Those kind of things can really make a difference in your life.",
        "Goon #1: Hey, you got a problem, fellow?",
        "Tony: I might.",
        "Goon #2: Oh, tough guy, huh?",
        "Goon #1: Is that what you are, tough guy?",
        "Goon #3: We could help you get over that.",
        "Tony: Shut up. Shut up!",
        "Goon #2: Hey, look. I don't know what your problem is...",
        "Tony: Problem? Oh, what, now I got a problem, huh? Now I got a problem? How's the job going, huh? How's the job going? You guys are coming from Fifth Street, right? See, the thing is I don't think I've ever seen you around before.",
        "Goon #2: Yeah, so?",
        "Tony: So, this guy... Let me tell you something. This guy right here talks way too much. You hear me?",
        "Goon #2: So?",
        "Tony: Doesn't mean I don't recognize you! Where are you from, Cottage? Cal Sag Channel, huh?",
        "Goon #1: So we're from the south side of Chicago. Is that against the law in Springfield?",
        "Tony: My law. You hear me? My law. You know Juneway Jungle?",
        "Goon #1: You're Tony Santos.",
        "Tony: Give the man a cigar. But you can't do that, can you? Because I just gave you one right there, didn't I, huh? Hey, let me see something, huh? What are you guys into? Carpentry, bricklayers, what?",
        "Goon #1: We've got to run.",
        "Tony: Yeah?",
        "Goon #1: If you don't mind. Get up early, back on the job.",
        "Tony: \"Back on the job.\" Yeah, that's right, \"back on the job.\" Yeah, you can go. You can go all right, back home. You hear me? Back home. So you do me a favor. You tell Angelo Bruzi that I... you can't quite do that, because he might hit you over the head with a bat. So you do me a favor. You tell Angelo Bruzi I said \u0091bye.' Is this funny to you? Tell him I said \u0091bye'!",
        "Goon #1: I don't know no Angelo Bruzi.",
        "Tony: You sure about that? You positive? Then I think we've got a big problem.",
        "Luke: So I told Shayne, I told Shayne, \"No way, man. They're going to catch us for sure.\"",
        "Shayne: Yeah, yeah. And you know what they do to rookies if they catch you out past curfew, right?",
        "Marina: Oh, give you a spanking?",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Luke: So I... all right, listen to me. You'd think my whole life was about baseball.",
        "Shayne: Bro...",
        "Luke: It's okay. My life is all about baseball.",
        "Shayne: And Luke used to go spend his summers at the lake like we did. And I'll bet you we were all there at the same time.",
        "Luke: I doubt it. I would have never forgotten Marah.",
        "Marah: I am going to go look at the desserts.",
        "Luke: Well, I'd like to see those.",
        "Marah: Actually, it's a euphemism. I'm going to go to the restroom.",
        "Luke: Right. Was it something I said, or, like, everything I'm saying?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah.",
        "Marah: You're the hero type. Want to save me from a blind date?",
        "Jeffrey: Why don't I give you some advice instead? Why don't you try to go back over there and have a good time?",
        "Buzz: Can I ask you something personal?",
        "Gus: Sure.",
        "Buzz: Do you love your old man? Do you love Alan?",
        "Gus: I guess I do. I mean, he's my father.",
        "Buzz: Weird saying it, right? Well, I... if you love him, let sleeping dogs lie, you know? Digging up something ten years ago, 20 years ago...",
        "Gus: You're just saying let it go?",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Gus: That's a little odd coming from you, isn't it? I mean, I thought you'd be happy to hear some dirt on Alan.",
        "Buzz: It's in the past. We're older now, you know? Us old, crusty guys, we stick together after a while.",
        "Gus: Well, what if the past has something really, really wrong in it?",
        "Buzz: Well, we all have skeletons, you know? They get unearthed from time to time. Embarrassment, humiliation often ensues. You wouldn't want your old man to end up embarrassed and humiliated. I mean, what for?",
        "Gus: I'm not trying to hurt the guy.",
        "Buzz: If I were you, I would think to myself -- how much is it going to cost him? How much is it going to cost you? Is it worth it?",
        "Brad: You seem nervous. Relax.",
        "Harley: And you seem like you are doing everything to loosen my inhibitions.",
        "Brad: Well, after the way you knocked back the first one, I just assumed inhibition is something you want to lose. Haven't we both been waiting for this?",
        "Harley: \"Waiting\"?",
        "Brad: Aching for it?",
        "Harley: \"Aching\"?",
        "Brad: Here's to the end of the wait.",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Harley: I think that's my phone.",
        "Brad: You know, next time we meet you're going to have to turn that off.",
        "Harley: I can't. I'm a mother.",
        "Brad: Oh. Where is it?",
        "Harley: No, Brad, I'll get it.",
        "Brad: Oh, here it is.",
        "Harley: No, it's not a big deal. I'll get it. Brad... wait!",
        "Harley: Um...",
        "Brad: Hey, are you all right?",
        "Harley: Uh, yeah, I just... (Laughs)",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Harley: Oh, look at that. Gosh, these interruptions come in bundles, don't they? You should get that.",
        "Brad: I told Alexandra not to call, but being Alexandra... Hello. Yeah, no.",
        "Harley: Gus, Gus.",
        "Brad: The office. You?",
        "Harley: I don't know. They hung up before I could get to it.",
        "Brad: Finally alone. Is there a problem?",
        "Harley: I... really think I could use a drink.",
        "Brad: I'm going too fast for you.",
        "Harley: I would prefer if this was slow.",
        "Brad: Slow?",
        "Harley: Um-hmm.",
        "Brad: You want to savor the moment? I can do slow.",
        "Harley: Um-hmm.",
        "Brad: You've been waiting for this opportunity.",
        "Harley: Um-hmm.",
        "Brad: Now it's here. We really should take advantage.",
        "(Knock on door)",
        "Brad: I can't...",
        "Woman: Towers Management, Mr. Green.",
        "Brad: I can't believe this. Go away!",
        "(Knocking continues)",
        "Brad: Don't button anything. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Excuse me.",
        "Woman: The card used to reserve this room was declined.",
        "Brad: Oh, all right. Here, try this one. You had to... you couldn't just call the room?",
        "Woman: We left a message at your home instead.",
        "Brad: My home? Um, my home. My home. Look... my wife is due home in an hour. I've got to get home and erase that message. We'll pick up with this some other time, all right. Thank you.",
        "Woman: I'll tell Mr. O'Neill everything worked out.",
        "(Crashing)",
        "Tony: You listen to me. You understand me, I'm working the jobs on Fifth Street now. That means all you guys are gone! Do you understand what I'm saying, huh? Because I know Bruzi's trying to work his way in there. I know he's trying to work his way in. But it's not going to happen. You want to know why? I'm telling you right now if the slightest, and I mean the slightest problem goes wrong, one guy... one guy slows something down, I'm talking one guy, one nail goes missing, I'm coming after the three of you guys personally. Do you understand me? Comprende?",
        "Goon #1: It's a big job, Santos. Things happen. I mean, you're going to hold us responsible no matter what?",
        "Tony: That's right! So I suggest you three monkeys, you quit, head back to Chicago tonight. Get out of here!",
        "Goon #1: Bruzi's not going to be happy.",
        "Tony: I'm counting on that.",
        "Cassie: He was so vibrant.",
        "Sandy: Star power; he really had it.",
        "Cassie: Your father was an incredible man.",
        "Sandy: I'd really like to know more.",
        "Cassie: You should ask your mother. Reva has some wonderful stories. Does that make you feel uncomfortable?",
        "Sandy: A little. I'd rather talk to you.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Sandy: She has this whole sixth sense thing going on. And I feel like I'm telegraphing stuff or she's reading me. And there are things I don't want her to know.",
        "Cassie: Like what?",
        "Sandy: Like me growing up. How I feel whenever I see her. I don't want her guilt-tripping over that. It wouldn't be fair.",
        "Cassie: That's very selfless of you. Very Richard-like. You shouldn't be afraid to let that shine through.",
        "Sandy: I don't know where that stuff comes from.",
        "Cassie: I do and it's a good place, and you should trust it.",
        "Sandy: Hey, can... can we do this again sometime? And I understand if you say no, because of how you feel about the baby you and my dad were going to have. Or maybe seeing me brings you more pain. I don't want that.",
        "Cassie: It won't. If you want to talk about your father, I will be there anytime. Good night.",
        "Sandy: Good night. Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah.",
        "Marah: Come on, you're sitting here alone. I'll just make up some excuse. We can go meet in the parking lot.",
        "Jeffrey: Uh, go back to your table, please, Marah, because this is really not a good time.",
        "Marah: Oh, what, like you have a date? Like that's going to work on me again? It didn't work New Year's Eve.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah.",
        "Miko: Good evening, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: This time it happens to be true. Good evening.",
        "Miko: Who's your friend?",
        "Jeffrey: Uh, Marah, this is Miko. Miko, this is Marah.",
        "Marah: Hi.",
        "Miko: Hello.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I'll get a chair. Here we are. Miko is an... an acquaintance.",
        "Marah: Oh, what a coincidence. I'm an acquaintance, too. Well, I should probably get back to my table.",
        "Luke: Oh, there you are. You get lost on the way to the dessert cart?",
        "Marah: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Luke: Hi, I'm Luke Huff.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, hi.",
        "Marah: Sorry. Luke, Jeffrey O'Neill, District Attorney. Oh, and his friend, Miko.",
        "Luke: The DA, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Luke: Oh, Marah's got friends in high places.",
