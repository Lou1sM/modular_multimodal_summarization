        "Marina: You are so busted.",
        "Harley: Well, I may not be able to find Alan or Gus, but at least I know Spaulding's in good hands.",
        "Dinah: You know, I really don't trust Alan-Michael at all. He's very different than when we were growing up.",
        "Harley: I know, but Alan- Michael doesn't want the company. He wants to have fun. He's fooled around. And I can get my job back any time I want. I don't want it back any time soon, not until I find my husband.",
        "Dinah: You love Gus so much. I just... I think that's amazing. I think it's really scary. I'm stupid. I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.",
        "Harley: No, it's not stupid; it's true. Loving somebody that much is scary. But it can be worth it. ( Door rattles ) maybe Archie came back for some more.",
        "Mallet: Oh, God! ( Grunts ) Hello. I did have a key.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reporter: Ms. Winslow?",
        "Tammy: Yes? Do I know you?",
        "Reporter: So you're in love with your own cousin?",
        "Jonathan: Easy with that thing. What, are you looking for the freak of the week? Go somewhere else.",
        "Tammy: No. Jonathan, I'm totally cool with this. You want to know what it is like to be in love with my cousin? Take your recorder back; I'll tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie! I hope you're awake because I've got some good news. There you are. What are you doing? Why are you in the dark?",
        "Cassie: I'm not in the dark. Maybe I was, but I'm not anymore.",
        "Jeffrey: Wow, that's deep. What's going on?",
        "Cassie: Well, isn't that just the question of the hour?",
        "Jeffrey: You're worried about Tammy?",
        "Cassie: Tell me when you were going to trust me with the truth.",
        "Jeffrey: About Tammy?",
        "Cassie: About you. How long were you going to sit on the fact that you impersonated Richard?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I've had dreams like this. Only there was whipped cream involved.",
        "Dinah: What are you doing here?",
        "Mallet: Thank you. Excuse me, this is my place, you remember?",
        "Harley: How did you find us?",
        "Mallet: There was a very nice man at Company who was very open and honest.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) Thanks, Dad. Did you find anything on Gus?",
        "Mallet: No, sorry. I take the fact that you're asking me, you came up short, too?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, nothing.",
        "Harley: Well... no, there was that nice man who tried to con us out of thousands of dollars. Remember him? I take it that Frank approved this visit, right?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm right where I need to be. We're looking for your husband. We're looking for my partner. You know what? First thing tomorrow morning, Pelican Club Resort, we have to go here.",
        "Harley: Where's your badge, detective?",
        "Mallet: My what? What are you talking about?",
        "Harley: Your badge. That gold shield shaped thing that you wear here to show others that you are a law enforcement official.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) Harley, this chitchat, all this chitchat you incessantly do, it's wasting time. Come on. I've brought my case file; it's in my brief case. We can look at it while dinner's cooking. Who's cooking dinner? Let's go, ladies. We've got work to do.",
        "Harley: You turned in your badge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't know what you heard or what you thought you heard...",
        "Marina: You know what? Spare me the gory details. Business is business, right?",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina, let me explain.",
        "Marina: No need. Something's come up; you have to cancel our date. Go on, say it. Don't worry about it. I mean, it's fine. I've got a lot more important things I need to worry about. I just thought a little distraction might be nice, but it's no big deal.",
        "Alan-Michael: Officer, halt, rewind. The date's on. Not only that, it's locked in. You've got the evening of a lifetime in store.",
        "Marina: I see we've branched out into advertising.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm going to take you to a party you're never going to forget. Wait until you hear who's going to be there.",
        "Marina: Wait. Now, I'm not dressed for some glitzy \"A\"-list party thing.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're going to be the hottest woman there, guaranteed.",
        "Marina: Do you have any business that you need to take care of before this party of yours?",
        "Alan-Michael: No.",
        "Marina: Find some. I'll be right back. I've got to go take care of something.",
        "Frank: Hey.",
        "Marina: Dad, we had a deal, all right? I don't comment about you going after Olivia; you don't give me the evil eye over Alan-Michael.",
        "Frank: I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sitting here reading my paper, having a lovely coffee.",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah. Well, it's a good thing that you're the chief because your surveillance skills suck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm sorry I had to cut you short before. How are we looking in terms of votes? I need to be 100% sure that once that vote is made it will carry. Harley has to be out and I have to be in as CEO before the meeting room doors open again.",
        "Alexandra: You are playing a dangerous game.",
        "Alan-Michael: I thought you wanted me to gain control of the company, didn't you?",
        "Alexandra: I think I do. All right, yes, I always thought you should take the helm one day and maybe the time is right.",
        "Alan-Michael: No matter what I have to do?",
        "Alexandra: I don't really think I should say anything about that.",
        "Alan-Michael: Then what's the problem?",
        "Alexandra: Look, you're playing more than one game here. I want you to stop this ridiculous fascination with Marina Cooper right now. No, I mean it. I mean it. You really want to go against Frank Cooper again after all these years? Come on.",
        "Alan-Michael: I can handle Frank.",
        "Alexandra: Why is it that the Cooper's and Spaulding's never seem to quite understand that they really can't...?",
        "Alan-Michael: Hook up?",
        "Alexandra: Okay, but don't make fun. You just remember what happened to Phillip when he got involved with the Coopers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, you don't owe this woman a story or an apology or anything else.",
        "Tammy: Who said anything about apologizing? It's true. Jonathon and I are cousins-- and I love him. Because there's more sweetness in him than in anybody I know. And he had to go through hell before he could let that show. He had an abusive father who...",
        "Jonathan: Okay, that's enough.",
        "Tammy: I want to tell everybody.",
        "Jonathan: Go away. Go away.",
        "Tammy: What are you doing? I've got a whole speech planned.",
        "Jonathan: No speeches.",
        "Tammy: No more shame. We're free! Get used to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.",
        "Jeffrey: Your trip to San Cristobel.",
        "Cassie: Was to see Edmund, yeah, to get some questions answered.",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, he told me you impersonated Richard and that you pretended to be my husband right under my nose.",
        "Jeffrey: And you believed him?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I didn't want to, but all of the pieces fit. Don't. He also said that you released Dinah from prison, and that she was part of your operation. You were my hero, Jeffrey. You were the one solid thing in my life that I came to depend on more and more. But if you did this and you deliberately lied to me, then... I don't know what you are, and... oh, God I feel sick. Are you going to say something? Are you going to tell me I'm crazy? Tell me that Edmund is an insane liar! I beg you, tell me that this is all a lie!",
        "Jeffrey: I was a federal agent, Cassie. I was trained to lie.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Was Edmund right or wrong? Just tell me.",
        "Jeffrey: I always knew this day was going to come.",
        "Cassie: Oh,",
        "Jeffrey: But I don't want to lie anymore. I don't want to play games with you, so... yeah, it is true. Every last bit of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Did you know about this, him tossing away his badge to help him find Gus?",
        "Dinah: Kind of. Kind of.",
        "Harley: I don't care what we agreed on, okay? You shouldn't throw away your badge. It doesn't help anything anyway. Because now I just... I feel guilty, okay? One more thing for me to feel bad about. Thank you very much.",
        "Mallet: It just frees me up to look for my partner.",
        "Harley: Your partner that you're so close to, right?",
        "Mallet: I owe it to him to help find him, okay? I think I'm losing my mind. Don't think I'm... but Gus has kind of been creeping into my head.",
        "Harley: Been in your thoughts, huh?",
        "Mallet: It's like he pops up himself in...",
        "Harley: You mean you hear him?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I hear him, I see him, I talk to him.",
        "Harley: Oh, my God, so do I. I understand exactly what you're saying.",
        "Dinah: Okay, this is officially getting weird.",
        "Harley: Like the other day, I was at Spaulding and he was there sitting on my desk, cross- legged, and telling me he liked my suit. And he said he was coming back.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, and check this out. I was having coffee the other day on Main Street, and Gus comes over and sits at my table and we started chatting about his case.",
        "Harley: This is so weird. I can picture it. I can see him. Wouldn't it be weird if he was wearing the same clothes in what we're both...? ( Laughs ) I'm sorry, you guys haven't even had a chance to really catch up at all.",
        "Dinah: That's okay. We'll do that later. You're looking for your husband, and you're looking for your partner, and... we're hungry, so cool, so don't worry about it. But I think I saw some herbs out in the front yard, and I'm going to cut them and make a pasta sauce. So you guys put your heads together, okay?",
        "Dinah: Not jealous. Not the new Dinah.",
        "Harley: She's been great.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, she is. What?",
        "Harley: Don't tell me you threw away your badge for me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: And what if I want to watch one of my officers in action, huh?",
        "Marina: Okay. First of all, I'm not on duty. And until you start following around Esposito on one of his dates...",
        "Frank: Oh, so this is a date?",
        "Marina: Dad, enough, okay? Alan-Michael is not what you think he is-- at least not anymore.",
        "Frank: You sure about that?",
        "Marina: Yes.",
        "Frank: Really? Then why is it the second Harley goes off looking for Gus, Alan- Michael makes himself very comfortable behind Harley's desk? You can't trust him, Marina. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan Michael: All I'm looking for is a little harmless fun.",
        "Alexandra: When it comes to the Coopers and the Spaulding's, \"harmless\" isn't a word you... ( sighs )",
        "Alan-Michael: You seem to act like I've never been through this.",
        "Alexandra: All right, well, this is different. It has changed. The stakes are much higher my dear. No, I'm telling you. For all we know, Gus has gone off and gotten himself killed, and maybe... maybe taken Alan with him.",
        "Alan-Michael: Look, I'm not paranoid like Phillip, and I'm not a lose cannon like Gus. So don't worry. I've got my priorities straight. I'll have my place at the top cemented soon enough.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah, well, I hope so. I hope so for the sake of the family.",
        "Alan-Michael: In the meantime I have a date.",
        "Alexandra: No, you hold it right there. You think you can have it all, don't you? You really do. All of the Spaulding power and at the same time, all of the Cooper, what, sweetness? Well, I'm going to tell you, take it from me, one who has tried to have everything and failed. You can't. You can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Alan-Michael is not out to set up Harley. Just you watch.",
        "Frank: Oh, I'll be watching.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Just because you reached for everything and couldn't grab it, doesn't mean it will happen to me.",
        "Alan-Michael and Marina: Family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, a few minutes ago in here you were willing to go to jail to protect me. Time for me to be as bold and brave as you are. So listen up, everybody! If you've got a problem with us being together, tough.",
        "Jonathan: Wow. I think I knocked something loose in your brain with that last kiss.",
        "Tammy: No. You've just let the real me out.",
        "Jonathan: The same here. Must run in the family. ( Laughing )",
        "Tammy: No cousin jokes.",
        "Jonathan: You know what's weird? Well, besides just about everything? Sandy and Jeffrey are the ones who got us off. I mean, I hate owing anything to anybody, but those guys? Man.",
        "Tammy: Don't worry about who got us off or how or even why. Just be grateful that we're free and together.",
        "Jonathan: You're right. Who gives a damn what they were thinking? We got what we wanted.",
        "Tammy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jonathan: Come on.",
        "Tammy: Where are we going?",
        "Jonathan: ( Mocking Tammy ) You said you want to tell your story? Now it's my turn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I remembered when my supervisor handed me the dossier on Richard Winslow and there was a picture in it. And I will never forget the day when I saw that face, my face staring back at me. A week later, I was in San Cristobel.",
        "Cassie: And was I there then?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Richard wanted to rid the island of the drug trade and he created a lot of enemies in the process. Threats were made on his life.",
        "Cassie: So you stood in for him?",
        "Jeffrey: What I did, Cassie, I did for your husband. That's it. Take it or leave it.",
        "Cassie: And what about Dinah? Was Dinah part of the job?",
        "Jeffrey: Freeing Dinah from that prison was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made. We had to find someone to stand in for you. We had to keep you safe. Dinah was not the right choice.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you think?",
        "Jeffrey: If I knew she was still harboring this grudge against you, there's no way I would have ever recruited her.",
        "Cassie: Why didn't you tell me this a long time ago? Why didn't you tell me a year ago? Or a month ago?",
        "Jeffrey: I wanted to tell you, Cassie, the minute I saw you.",
        "Cassie: So, why didn't you?",
        "Jeffrey: Something happened.",
        "Cassie: Something?",
        "Jeffrey: I fell in love with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nicole and Bradley, inside \"The Light\" With Jeffrey I think he wants a normal, real life, and I don't think that's going to be possible to him. To the viewers, I would want to say thank you for welcoming me. It's an honor to be a part of a show with such a history. I'm psyched to be a part of a show that's lasted all these years and that everybody loves. I can't believe it. It's a miracle. See Cassie and Jeffrey on January 25, inside \"The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Is there any of my beer left in the fridge?",
        "Harley: Mallet?",
        "Mallet: Don't tell me you drank it all.",
        "Harley: I asked you a question.",
        "Mallet: I'm here to help you find Gus, period.",
        "Harley: And Dinah's okay with this?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, she seems okay to me. Believe me, we'd know if she wasn't.",
        "Harley: I think we would know if she wasn't.",
        "Mallet: Look, things between Dinah and I have been pretty good. Then when I heard she came down here with you, I...",
        "Harley: You missed her?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah, I kind of did, actually.",
        "Dinah: Okay, well, what I thought was an herb patch was not. It was poison ivy. ( Laughter ) So we're going to scratch that. I'm going to do something else. So I hope you guys are hungry.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, absolutely. Me, always.",
        "Dinah: You even touch my food tonight, you're going to lose a finger.",
        "Mallet: You mean a special pasta with a poison ivy sauce.",
        "Dinah: Are you going to make bad jokes, or are you going to chop?",
        "Mallet: I'm going to chop, chop, chop.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Stop, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: My dad is not invited to this party, is he?",
        "Alan-Michael: No.",
        "Marina: Good, let's go.",
        "Alan-Michael: I remember that laser beam stare of his. He is never going to let me off the hook.",
        "Marina: He's got good intentions. He just has this thing against...",
        "Alan-Michael: Men and his daughter?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Well, mostly you.",
        "Alan-Michael: I hate to admit, but I probably deserve it. But I've been nothing but nice to you-- well, mostly.",
        "Marina: Yeah, mostly. I don't know. He has this idea...",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah?",
        "Marina: I don't know. He thinks that you might be taking advantage of Harley being away, that you've got some power grab thing in mind or something.",
        "Alan-Michael: I could see how it might look like that, but he wouldn't think that if he heard my aunt lecturing me about how I'm neglecting business by spending time with you.",
        "Marina: Oh, really? She said that?",
        "Alan-Michael: She did.",
        "Marina: And did you tell her how you might have the evening of a lifetime in store?",
        "Alan-Michael: I thought that was our little secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Do you remember the first time that we saw each other in Springfield?",
        "Cassie: Of course. At the Beacon.",
        "Jeffrey: You were so beautiful, I couldn't breathe.",
        "Cassie: And I thought you were Richard.",
        "Jeffrey: And down you went, out like a light. ( Laughs ) That's when I realized I couldn't... I couldn't tell you about my connection with Richard because it would cause you too much pain and confusion. Cassie...",
        "Cassie: That is such a lousy excuse.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, maybe I was wrong, but I believed it at the time, okay? And besides, you know, it was... it was over. I had no idea we were going to become so close.",
        "Cassie: But then we did, Jeffrey. We became more than close. We fell in love, moved in together.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: So were you ever going to tell me?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't think so. You're just... you know, it seemed so long ago, and we were starting a whole new life together, and I was having my first shot at a real life in I don't know how long.",
        "Cassie: It's not a real life if it is based on lies.",
        "Jeffrey: But we're together, right? We're here now, we're together, and we love each other. That... that's what really matters, right?",
        "Cassie: Honesty matters. Telling the truth matters. Why can't anyone see that?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, but we know the truth now. Cassie, we know the truth now. We can do this. We can move past this.",
        "Cassie: You know, Edmund used to say the exact same thing to me.",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund? There's something else, isn't there? Edmund told you something else. What is it?",
        "Cassie: Well, he suggested that in the time you were playing Richard in San Cristobel... ( cell phone rings ) Hello. Reva, hi. Yeah, he's right here. Why? Tell me what good news? Wow! Okay. Wow! Okay. Thank you for calling. Thank you for calling, Reva. Tammy's free?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, cleared of all charges.",
        "Cassie: But I thought she wasn't even supposed to start the trial until next week.",
        "Jeffrey: It got it pushed up. It's what these were for. I wanted to tell you when I came in, but I didn't have time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: This pasta's fantastic. Thank you. It's really good. Tomorrow morning, we definitely have to go back to the Pelican Club Resort.",
        "Harley: Make sure Alan is not hiding there somewhere.",
        "Dinah: Sounds like a plan to me. Thank you. You know, I think that Archie gave us something.",
        "Harley: Our favorite con man?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, it's not what he said; it's what he didn't say. Obviously the word is out that Alan is missing.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, and?",
        "Dinah: And, you know, he must have thought we came down with piles of cash just to buy information.",
        "Harley: Which we didn't.",
        "Dinah: No, but Archie didn't know that. And neither did any of the other local, slimy types that are creeping around, you know? I mean, they are trying to make some bucks off of any hot tip.",
        "Mallet: Right. So what you're saying is we should let it be known we're going to offer top dollar for any info on Gus or Alan. Play the underground search party thing.",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Oh, the old scam the scammers trick.",
        "Dinah: And since you have taken leave, you don't have to worry about any cop procedures. You don't have to play by the rules.",
        "Mallet: Ah, no rules. Gus would love that.",
        "Harley: I'm starting to love it.",
        "Dinah: Okay, so what I think I should do is go to some of the local casinos, go to the clubs, start spreading some cash around and hint there's a whole lot more where that comes from. I think it might be good. What do you think?",
        "Harley: I think that all those years of conning people was like a college education for you.",

        "Alan-Michael: Maybe they weren't able to make it.",

We cornered him, we're moving in, Gus is getting ready to put the handcuffs on him, and all of a sudden this guy, this perp pulls out a gun, and Gus is kind of surprised, and he steps back a little bit, loses his balance. He starts falling backwards towards an open window, and right at the last second he kind of reaches out and he grabs a sheet that's kind of hanging off of a hamper there. And then-- boom!-- He's gone. I don't see him. He's out the window. And I run down to the street, and I run out and Gus goes... the sheet totally broke his fall. Gus goes, \"See? See? What'd I tell you? Para-sheet, man, para-sheet.\" ( Laughter )",
        "Dinah: Well you know what? When I was in prison, I was chained to a wall, and I thought I was never going to get out of there, but I did! I got out of there. So I'm here to tell you, anything is impossible. Nothing is impossible.",
