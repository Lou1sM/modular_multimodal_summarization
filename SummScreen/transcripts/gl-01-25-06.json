        "Cassie wakes up next to Jeffrey and goes out to look at her pictures from San Cristobel. She compares pictures of Jeffrey and Richard. She goes to visit Richard's grave and while there imagines that she sees him. She asks him to give her answers but he tells her that she has to find the answers herself. She then confronts Dinah who tells her that Jeffrey enjoyed playing the prince as much as she did playing the princess. At the farm Jeffrey awakens and sees the pictures. Cassie comes back to the farm and throws herself into his arms. She tells him she still needs time and asks him about the times he played Richard. They visit Richard's grave together, where Doris finds them and lets Cassie in on the fact that Jeffrey gave his job up to get Tammy off. Cassie says that times like this are why she fell in love with him. While they are helping RJ learn to skate, Cassie flashes back to a similar time with Richard. She tells Jeffrey she needs to go and take care of some stuff and goes to see Tammy. Jonathan isn't happy, but Cassie says that she needs Tammy to come with her for the day and Tammy goes. They go to San Cristobel and try to remember if there were times that they could have been with Jeffrey instead of Richard. Cassie does remember a particular kiss that she knows was Jeffrey now, not Richard. Returning to Springfield, Cassie goes back to the gravesite where she calls Josh to come and meet her since she says he is the only one she can talk to about this."

        "Jeffrey: You know I always knew this day was going to come. But I don't want to lie anymore. Yeah, it's true, every last bit of it. But we're together, right? We're here now, we're together, and we love each other. That's what really matters, right?",
        "Cassie: I want to believe you. [singer] I'm losing you I'm losing oh, you...",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, I did it, and now it's over. I should have told you.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, should have.",
        "Jeffrey: I love you.",
        "Cassie: It's not a real life if it's based on lies. I don't want to fight I'll make you see I'll hold me breath and disappear inside myself I'm losing strength I'm losing, oh, strength you're breaking my heart breaking my heart...",
        "Cassie: I have to know the truth, Jeffrey. And I can't get to it by myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I know what you're going to say, Richard, I haven't been coming as often as I used to. It doesn't mean I'm not thinking about you. You're always with me, even though you're not. You always try so hard to protect me, and I know I fought you on that a lot, but the truth is, my life made sense when we were together. And now I feel like I don't have solid ground under my feet. Jeffrey, you-- what was real, what isn't. Help me, Richard, help me understand where I am. I'm losing you...",
        "Richard: Hello, darling. I'm losing oh, you.",
        "Cassie: Oh, you're so warm.",
        "Richard: You're so cold. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around?",
        "Cassie: Don't you dare make me laugh. I'm too upset. I'm confused.",
        "Richard: What's the problem?",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey.",
        "Richard: Ah, Jeffrey.",
        "Cassie: When I first started to fall in love with him, remember I came here to see him, to ask your permission to let it happen. And I felt like I got that from you. And now I don't know what to think.",
        "Richard: So what you really want is information, not advice.",
        "Cassie: I need you to tell me when was Jeffrey pretending to be you.",
        "Richard: It was a lifetime ago.",
        "Cassie: How am I supposed to I live now if I can't trust Jeffrey? Richard, I can't move forward unless I know where I've been-- unless I know where he's been.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: ( Sighs ) Richard, I promised you that I would protect her. I swore that I wouldn't let anyone hurt her. And now someone has. Me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Richard: Cassie, darling, I would do anything for you.",
        "Cassie: I know. You've already proven that.",
        "Richard: But there are some things I can't-- I'm just in your imagination, okay?",
        "Cassie: But you are a part of me, you're a part of me and I need help from you. Please tell me about Jeffrey.",
        "Richard: Even if I could answer you, I couldn't tell you what to do next. I want you to feel, Cassie. You have your own life to live, your own choices to make. Even your own mistakes.",
        "Cassie: Loving Jeffrey felt right to me in every way. And now there are so many questions in my head.",
        "Richard: What does your heart feel, darling?",
        "Cassie: It tells me I should be careful, and I hate that. I want to trust Jeffrey, like I trusted you, unconditionally. I don't want to question his honesty and loyalty and love for me. But I do now.",
        "Richard: I can't help you with this. You have to decide what is real in your heart, heart, heart, heart ( echoing )...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Oh, please. Hey.",
        "Cassie: You said you wanted to make up for all of the pain you caused me and my family. Now would be a good time to start.",
        "Dinah: Now would be a good time for you to get your hands off.",
        "Cassie: I need answers from you. Jeffrey impersonated Richard in San Cristobel and all over Europe, which is why he released you from prison, yes or no.",
        "Dinah: It sounds like you have this whole thing figured out, so I don't think you really need me. I have a movie to go to unless you want to beat me up.",
        "Cassie: I will if I have to.",
        "Dinah: What has got you so pissed off?",
        "Cassie: What would happen if I told your boss, Harley, that you're being uncooperative?",
        "Dinah: You know what? First of all, Jeffrey found me in prison; he offered me an opportunity to get out of there. I would've jumped at anything to get out of there.",
        "Cassie: Yet you didn't mention that you and I had a history?",
        "Dinah: He did his research. He needed someone who knew you. I just mentioned how much I still hated you-- not that that was important at the time. I was going to be royalty.",
        "Cassie: Hey, you were going to be me.",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh, yeah. You know there was incentive, Cassie. Jeffrey caught on pretty quick that I was out to get even with you.",
        "Cassie: Well he thought he could control that.",
        "Dinah: He miscalculated.",
        "Cassie: Obviously.",
        "Dinah: I'm not proud of the mistakes I made in the past, but you know what? I have owned up to every one of my obsessions, which is more than I can say for certain royal look-a-likes.",
        "Cassie: Okay, what the hell does that mean?",
        "Dinah: I wasn't the only one who was getting a rush playing Winslow. Jeffrey enjoyed playing Richard. In fact, he had it down cold. I think he faked it a little too well. You know that's what happened when you fall into the land of make-believe, it can turn real.",
        "Cassie: So did Jeffrey ever talk to you about being with me when he was Richard?",
        "Dinah: Let me tell you something. You remind me why the old me had a problem with you. You walk around, you poke around, acting all high and mighty. You don't even know when you got it good.",
        "Cassie: I just want to know what's real?",
        "Dinah: You want to know what's real? Hmm? You've got a guy who cares for you an awful lot, but because he's not perfect or your ideal Richard, you're going to screw up the whole thing.",
        "Cassie: I need to know, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: No, you don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Well, come inside, it's cold.",
        "Cassie: I went to visit Richard's grave.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I kind of figured something like that. I saw that you took out the photo albums, and-- were you comparing pictures of me and Richard?",
        "Cassie: Of course I was.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm hope it was helpful and soothing to go to the grave.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I wanted it to be, but I think I just wound up with more questions.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't believe what I told you? If there is anything else you need to know, just ask. I'll tell you anything.",
        "RJ: Whoa.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey!",
        "Cassie: Whoa. Easy does it. Are you all right?",
        "RJ: I got these roller blades for Christmas, and I still can't do them. Jeffrey, you promised you would help me learn.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, and a promise is a promise. Bend your knees a little bit, and don't hold your breath. And just-- you know, just trust, trust that your body is going to keep its balance. It's all about trust. All right so now, go all the way down there and come back. Are you ready?",
        "RJ: I can't, I'll fall.",
        "Cassie: Oh, honey, you know what? This is just like when you learned how to ride a bike.",
        "Jeffrey: RJ, we're going to be right here for you if anything happens. Don't worry, okay? On three we're going to let you go. One...",
        "RJ: Mom!",
        "Cassie: You're going to be great. Two...",
        "Jeffrey and Cassie: Three!",
        "Jeffrey: Go for it!",
        "RJ: Yeah!",
        "Jeffrey: There you go! See, just like your mom said, you're skating like a pro!",
        "Cassie: Stay on the path, honey.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't worry, he's not going to go too far. He needs to know you're watching.",
        "Cassie: Well how do you know that?",
        "Jeffrey: Because your approval means everything to him. I know the feeling. Hey!",
        "RJ: That was awesome.",
        "Jeffrey: Good job.",
        "RJ: Can I do it again?",
        "Cassie: Sure.",
        "Jeffrey: Hang on. Let me adjust these things for you. You are a beast.",
        "RJ: It's hard for me to turn.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? I used to have the same problem.",
        "Cassie: Are you sure he's ready to ride a horse?",
        "Richard: Of course he's ready to ride a horse. Besides, we have lots of good you know, horse people-- whatever you call them?",
        "Cassie: Stable hands?",
        "Richard: Yes, that's it, stable hands.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry, I'm a city girl. Couldn't he just learn to take the bus by himself like I did at his age? If he gets thrown, you are a dead man.",
        "Richard: Okay, listen, Cassie. If there's anything I know about horses, and I do know something about horses, and it's that it's all about trust. And the horses are definitely going to trust this young man here, I'm telling you right now. Besides, we're going to be right there if he needs us. But he's not going to need us, are you, partner? Put it there. Yeah. All right.",
        "Jeffrey: Cleared for takeoff, captain.",
        "RJ: See ya.",
        "Jeffrey: Look at him go! So much for being afraid, huh? ( Laughing ) What, what's wrong?",
        "Cassie: Do you remember when RJ learned to ride a horse?",
        "Jeffrey: You mean at the farm?",
        "Cassie: In San Cristobel. He was maybe four or five?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I wasn't there. That wasn't me.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry, I just--",
        "Jeffrey: Do you know what Richard and I had in common besides this face? He was watching out for you and the kids, and so am I. He did it then; I'm doing it now. Can't we get past this?",
        "Cassie: I wish I could will away these questions, but I can't.",
        "Jeffrey: You know what? You need a good shot of perspective. Come on.",
        "Cassie: Where are we going?",
        "Jeffrey: We're going to get RJ, and then I'm going to prove to you that your memories of Richard are just that, of him, not me.",
        "Cassie: I already came here once today, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I know. You told me you came here looking for answers. But this place can't give you answers, Cassie. Just like Richard couldn't give you answers. Do you know why? Because Richard lied to you, too.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry, what?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, think about it. Did he ever tell you? Did Richard ever sit you down and tell you that there was a C.I.A. Operative on the island who looks exactly like him, who will be standing in for him at certain events? No.",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, no, no. Of course not. Do you know why? Because he kept you out of the loop because he didn't trust you, Cassie. He didn't trust you with the truth, and that's why you're angry. Isn't it?",
        "Cassie: You're right. He didn't, no. And he was my husband. How could he not tell me?",
        "Jeffrey: That's it, come on, let it out, get angry. Get something, don't stop talking, let it out!",
        "Cassie: No. I have nothing else to say.",
        "Jeffrey: The hell you don't.",
        "Cassie: Let me go.",
        "Jeffrey: We're going to do this right now because these doubts and these questions are eating you alive, and you're looking at me like I'm a complete stranger, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Well, I wonder why?",
        "Jeffrey: Let's talk this through. Cassie, I cannot look at you, and not look into your eyes and not see that love anymore. I can't do that.",
        "Cassie: I do love you, but I am angry!",
        "Jeffrey: And you keep comparing me to Richard every step of the way. Was that me who high-fived RJ, was it me who held the door for you, was it me who kissed your hand-- you can't even trust your own thoughts.",
        "Cassie: No, I can't. That's what I'm saying.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, you can.",
        "Cassie: I don't believe you. I don't believe you. Jeffrey, you took every beautiful moment that I had, and you took every moment I treasured and cast a doubt over it. Dinah said you loved being Richard.",
        "Jeffrey: You went to Dinah.",
        "Cassie: And she said it become very real for you. I want to know is that true. Did you just play the prince at a few public events, or were you pretending to be him when I thought I was alone with him?",
        "Jeffrey: The deeper I got into playing Richard, into being him, the more I came to respect him, envy him, I guess, and what he had; the life that you two had together. It was something that I never knew or could be a part of. But we agreed. That only when it was absolutely necessary for security that I would take his place. And you have to believe that your private moments with him were just that, they were private and yours.",
        "Cassie: So why should I believe that when you've lied about so much else?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, because if you don't, Cassie, then it's over. The suspicion will destroy everything, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to pretend everything is great?",
        "Jeffrey: No, but it is not so bad. Cassie, you had a man, a prince, he loved you, he protected you, but now he is gone. And now you have another man. And he's.... he's no prince. He's just a man. And he will love you and protect you as long as he takes a breath, he will do that. And... you get the same face twice. Lucky you.",
        "Cassie: (Laughing). So when you first came to San Cristobel and you saw me with Richard, did you feel anything besides appreciation?",
        "Richard: You have to decide what is real in your heart. You have to decide what is real in your heart.",
        "Jeffrey: Please.",
        "Cassie: I just feel like I have spent most of my life without having a damn thing to count on, nothing but myself. And now I have you, and I have my memories with Richard. And losing them both at the same time, it just makes me want to kick something and scream and--",
        "Jeffrey: All right, if you want to fight, then fight to hold on, please, to that. To both of those things.",
        "Doris: You know, it's unseemingly for a well known person to have such a public argument. Hello, Mrs. Winslow.",
        "Jeffrey: Go away, Doris.",
        "Doris: I came to tell you I actually do need that brief on the Turner versus Springfield case first thing tomorrow morning.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm off the clock. If you don't mind.",
        "Doris: Actually, I do. Because when you work for me, you're not off the clock until I tell you.",
        "Cassie: What's going on?",
        "Doris: Jeffrey didn't tell you about his heroics? Shame on you. Jeffrey didn't tell you? He swapped jobs with me.",
        "Cassie: What? Is this because of Tammy?",
        "Doris: It is actually very romantic if you care about that kind of stuff. The Turner brief tomorrow morning.",
        "Cassie: You gave up your job?",
        "Jeffrey: I was planning to step down as D.A. Because I wanted to spend more time with you and RJ.",
        "Cassie: You see, now this is why it kills me to doubt you because in so many ways, you show up as my hero.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I take it back. It was a huge sacrifice.",
        "Richard: Now that is a good idea.",
        "Cassie: That is a very good idea, however, we have promised the kids we would take them to the beach today.",
        "Richard: Cassie, come on, I hate the beach.",
        "Cassie: You do not hate the beach, you get into building sand castles more than RJ. I remember you telling me a stroll along the sand is worth more than a year of therapy.",
        "Richard: Of course I love the beach, but I love being with my wife even more.",
        "Cassie: So we'll get the kids and go?",
        "Richard: Fine, but after that, we'll have to discuss how we get the sand out of your bathing suit.",
        "Jeffrey: Bad idea? I thought it was a good one?",
        "Cassie: I just can't take you up on it right now. Not right now.",
        "Jeffrey: What is going on?",
        "Cassie: Well, you know, the convention is coming to the Beacon, and I think I would feel better if I ran over some of the details.",
        "Jeffrey: You just remembered that?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Well, I've had a lot on my mind lately. So I'll just go and I'll come back and we'll take it from there, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. As long as you hurry back.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, it is O'Neill. Put me through. Tell him to make time, I have a problem, and my problems are the agency's problems. He knows the number. Tell him I'm waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Mom.",
        "Cassie: I need your help.",
        "Jonathan: Cassie, if you're here to hassle Tammy about being with me, you might as well get back in the car.",
        "Cassie: It isn't about Tammy. I need your help, I need you to come with me for the rest of the day.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Okay. I'll just get my coat. Is there anything else I need?",
        "Cassie: Nope. Just your memories.",
        "Tammy: This is your room. Yours and Dad's.",
        "Cassie: Yup. Richard never wanted to use the giant room. He liked it cozier. I don't think anybody has been here since we left.",
        "Tammy: Mom.",
        "Cassie: Honey, I want you to tell me everything you remember about Richard. I know you were pretty young when we lived here, but I want you to tell me what you remember about the time we spent together, and maybe the times I wasn't around and it was just the two of you.",
        "Tammy: I remember everything. I don't want to let myself forget, you know.",
        "Cassie: Did you always feel like Richard loved you and that love and the way he treated you was unchanging?",
        "Tammy: Unchanging?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, did he always seem like himself or did he make mistakes?",
        "Tammy: What kind of mistakes?",
        "Cassie: I don't know, saying something wrong about our lives, or acting like someone else?",
        "Tammy: Mom, does this have to do with what Jonathan found on Jeffrey?",
        "Cassie: Please just answer the questions. Can you think of anything?",
        "Tammy: I don't know, can you?",
        "Cassie: Do you remember that day when you got that new boogie board and we all wanted to go to the beach to check it out?",
        "Tammy: The day RJ got really badly sun burned?",
        "Cassie: Before we left, Richard tried to talk me out of going to the beach. He said he hated the beach.",
        "Tammy: But Richard loved...",
        "Cassie: How was he -- what was he like with you that day?",
        "Tammy: He was acting kind of weird.",
        "Cassie: Weird how?",
        "Tammy: At first I thought he was mad at us because Richard was so much fun at the beach. Relaxed. He would attack RJ with the sunblock, and make a game out of it. That day he seemed so uncomfortable, like he was afraid of us. And later on he acted totally normal. I never thought about it again until now.",
        "Cassie: Was there ever a point during that day when he left you on the beach and then came back?",
        "Tammy: Do you mean was there a chance for him and Jeffrey to switch places?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Tammy: Mom, I can't even imagine what this must be like for you.",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Tammy: Actually, I can. I know what it is like to have you think everything you know be untrue. Have it totally mess with everything you love and everything you felt about yourself.",
        "Cassie: Because Jonathan did that to you?",
        "Tammy: I know you're not going to want to hear this from me, but you can get past it, and maybe if you do, it will be worth it.",
        "Cassie: I don't know-- I don't know about that, honey.",
        "Tammy: Yes, you do. Mom, I loved Dad just as much as you did. And the times we spent here, they were some of the best times of my whole life. But if you love Jeffrey, I don't think anything can take that away. And I know that nothing can take away the memories that we have of Richard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Jeffrey: O'Neill. It's you, good. Yeah, I do have a problem, and you're going to fix it. I want those records destroyed. All of them. Well, this isn't a favor that I'm asking. You owe me. So do it. And do it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Why don't you go find Will and Alonzo, and I'll be down in a moment.",
        "Tammy: You sure?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Richard, there you are. I just have one or two little drops left.",
        "Richard: I think you've had too much to drink, darling. Time for bed.",
        "Cassie: Oh, now you're talking. You seem so distant at the party tonight. Uneasy lies the crown that wears the head.",
        "Richard: ( Laughing ) Silly me. I forgot something at the party.",
        "Cassie: No, no, no, no. You are not going anywhere.",
        "Richard: Cassie, you don't know how much I want this.",
        "Cassie: Oh, I have some idea.",
        "Richard: Tonight was -- it was incredible. It was amazing. Walking through the party with you on my arm.",
        "Cassie: It was like a dream, wasn't it?",
        "Richard: Yes, it was like a dream.",
        "Richard: But, you know, we both had a lot to drink.",
        "Cassie: So why let the dream end.",
        "Richard: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Sh-sh-sh. I know you've got a lot going on. But right here, right now, it is just you and me. Nothing else matters. I'm losing you I'm losing oh, you",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Thank you so much for coming with me.",
        "Tammy: I'm not sure I helped at all.",
        "Cassie: Of course you helped. Just being around you helps.",
        "Tammy: It was nice to be back in San Cristobel with you, even if it wasn't for the best reason.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I guess not.",
        "Tammy: So what are you going to do about Jeffrey?",
        "Cassie: I'm going to deal with it head-on.",
        "Tammy: Do you know any other way?",
        "Cassie: I sure haven't found one.",
        "Tammy: Mom...",
        "Cassie: Yeah?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, you're back.",
        "Tammy: I'm back.",

I keep -- I keep getting this feeling there is more to it than just one man pretending to be another at a few public events.",

        "Josh: What can I do?",
        "Cassie: You can help me, Josh. You can help me find the answers. No matter how painful they are. There has to be some way that I can hold onto my past with Richard and to my future with Jeffrey.",
