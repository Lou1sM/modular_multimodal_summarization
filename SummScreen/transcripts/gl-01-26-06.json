        "Tammy invites Sandy over to thank him for saving her and Jonathan in court. He tells her that he didn't do it for Jonathan but that he is over her and even thinking about leaving town. Jonathan waits at CO2 for Dean Bordereaux and when he arrives for lunch pressures him to let Tammy back into school. Ava has to pull him away before he does any more damage. Tammy is not happy to hear what Jonathan has done and tells him she was thinking of taking some time off of school. Sandy tries to make peace with Ava and later talks to the Dean himself. The Dean is impressed with Sandy and even talks with him about a job. Alan-Michael finds Marina in his room and she lies about why she is there. When he starts to kiss her though, she pulls away and accuses him of trying to take the company from Harley. He lies his way out of it saying that he had nothing to do with it, but instead it was one of the shareholders. She believes him but must leave when her family calls her to come to Company. Frank and Buzz worry about Harley, who doesn't want to believe that Gus is gone. When she receives a gift basket from him, she is ecstatic, sure that he will meet her and the boys in Hawaii for their trip they have planned. Buzz finds out that Gus arranged to have it sent before New Years and Harley breaks down at the news. She says that she needs to believe that Gus will return to her though. The entire Cooper family decides to go on the trip with Harley and the boy."

        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Sandy: Hi.",
        "Tammy: Thank you for coming.",
        "Sandy: You made it sound really important.",
        "Tammy: Well, yeah. It is kind of. At least to me. I, um... I didn't feel like I got a chance to thank you before for what you did.",
        "Sandy: Ah, I just did what I had to do, that's it.",
        "Tammy: You didn't have to do anything, Sandy, but you spoke up for us in court, and what you said changed everything, so if it weren't for you, Jonathan probably would have gone to jail.",
        "Sandy: Admittedly, I didn't do it for Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: No. You did it for me. And that's... it's... well, it's wonderful. It is.",
        "Sandy: Relax. I know where you're going with this, and don't worry. I'm over you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: You are so sweet.",
        "Jonathan: Since when?",
        "Ava: You missed me. That's why you've been sitting here for the last hour, so we could spend some quality time together.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever. Actually, I have a meeting.",
        "Ava: A what?",
        "Jonathan: A meeting. Dean Boudreau from Springfield U. is going to meet me here for some coffee.",
        "Ava: A meeting with you?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, a meeting with me. He doesn't know it yet, but his secretary said he has lunch here.",
        "Ava: Why are you stalking the Dean of the university?",
        "Jonathan: Well, he's the guy who kicked Tammy out of school.",
        "Ava: Jon, you're not going to...",
        "Jonathan: I'm not going to anything. I'm going to be very chill. I'm on a mission. Is that him?",
        "Ava: Yes. Wait a second...",
        "Jonathan: Dean Boudreau?",
        "Dean Boudreau: That's me.",
        "Jonathan: Jonathan Randall.",
        "Dean Boudreau: Randall. Randall, I think I've been reading about you.",
        "Jonathan: Great. We need to have a conversation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: And stay on top of Microtech, because John Sander has become a royal pain in my... behind. (Laughter)",
        "Zach: Packed!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hey, Pop, I got your message. What's up?",
        "Buzz: Your sister is still going to Hawaii, Frank.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I know. She and Gus made those plans months ago.",
        "Buzz: She and Gus. Great. Do you see Gus anywhere?",
        "Frank: Pop, we all know Gus is missing, but I still think it would be better for Harley to get out of here. I think it would be really good for her.",
        "Buzz: You think it would be really good for her? Explain that to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Is Gus going to help us get coconuts?",
        "Harley: Yes, Gus will help you pick coconuts. Yes, he will. ( Laughs ) They are so excited.",
        "Alan-Michael: Are you sure you still want to take this trip, Harley?",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah, no, I have to. I mean, the kids are excited. They deserve a treat. I couldn't disappoint them now.",
        "Alan-Michael: But Gus is...",
        "Harley: Gus won't disappoint them, either. I want to thank you. I mean, as much as I want to go on this trip with the kids, it's hard to leave the company, and it makes it so much easier to know there is somebody there I can trust.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: \"Special vote to install Alan-Michael Spaulding as CEO of Spaulding Enterprises.\" Okay, Alan-Michael Spaulding. I know you want Harley's job. Let's see what else you've got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You're a good friend.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes, I am.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) Hey, it took a lot for me to trust you. There was a time when you did some pretty rotten stuff to me and my family.",
        "Alan-Michael: I seem to recall that that was a two-way street.",
        "Harley: Yeah, maybe, but I was listening to Nadine, which was not a good idea. After what you did to Frank and Eleni, please.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's ancient history, and your brother won, at least temporarily. Sorry. We should get through this so you can make your flight.",
        "Harley: My flight is a private jet. It leaves when I tell it to. Do you want some ketchup for those?",
        "Alan-Michael: Sure.",
        "Harley: Hey, who knows? Maybe Gus will actually meet us at the airport.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You're over me?",
        "Sandy: Uh-huh.",
        "Tammy: Oh. Oh, I wasn't expecting that. That's great. Sandy, that's really great.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. It took me long enough to realize, but I finally realized what you and Jonathan have isn't going away.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Sandy: Why else would you sacrifice so much?",
        "Tammy: I don't really think that's what I'm doing.",
        "Sandy: Right, yeah. You would see it that way. But everyone else sees it pretty clear.",
        "Tammy: You're right. I should have done this over the phone. But I didn't want this to turn into a whole big thing, so...",
        "Sandy: This isn't a whole big thing. We're just talking.",
        "Tammy: So is there any chance that you and Ava...?",
        "Sandy: Uh-uh. No. For what it's worth, I may leave town.",
        "Tammy: But this is your home now.",
        "Sandy: No. Correction: You were my home. I stuck around here for you.",
        "Tammy: What about Reva? I mean, she's like family to you. She's like a second mom.",
        "Sandy: She is Jonathan's mom, not mine.",
        "Tammy: Sandy, I don't want you leaving because of what happened to us.",
        "Sandy: No. There is nothing left here for me, and honestly, seeing you and Jonathan together every time I turn around doesn't really scream home, or maybe that's just me.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry that I hurt you.",
        "Sandy: Me, too. What makes it worse is I still believe we would have been very happy.",
        "Tammy: ( Sighs )",
        "Sandy: We would have been very happy if it weren't for Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dean Boudreau: All right, Mr. Randall, what is this?",
        "Jonathan: You kicked Tammy Winslow out of your school.",
        "Dean Boudreau: I'm afraid I don't have that much power. Ms. Winslow's case came before the Board of Standards. And beyond that, I'm really not at liberty to discuss it with you.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, Tammy's case wouldn't have gone before anybody if it hadn't been for me. That fire was my fault.",
        "Dean Boudreau: I see. A word of advice then: You might want to take a hands- off approach moving forward.",
        "Jonathan: I can't do that. Tammy didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Dean Boudreau: I can't help you. I'm sorry.",
        "Jonathan: You're sorry, fix it.",
        "Dean Boudreau: Is this the part where you threaten me?",
        "Ava: Can I get you anything today, Dean Boudreau?",
        "Dean Boudreau: I don't know. Security?",
        "Ava: Jonathan means well. It's just that sometimes he gets a little excited and in the moment.",
        "Dean Boudreau: Yes, my daughter told me as much.",
        "Jonathan: So then you talked to Mel, so you know that Tammy is a good girl and she's very intelligent. You know that she gets straight A's at your school, and she just wants to come back so she can do something with her life, and you want to stop her from doing it.",
        "Dean Boudreau: I don't want to stop her from doing anything. If Ms. Winslow wants to complete her studies, she will have to reapply for the fall.",
        "Jonathan: That's not good enough.",
        "Dean Boudreau: And at that time the board can reassess her situation.",
        "Jonathan: Why don't you just fix it now?",
        "Ava: You know what? Okay. You know what? I'm going to get you a cup of coffee. I'm going to get you a regular. Excuse us. What is wrong with you?",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Ava: How do you expect him to help you out with Tammy if you're talking to him like that? Jonathan!",
        "Jonathan: Oh, please. He is just another person trying to break me and Tammy up, and I'm going to show him and Cassie and everybody else what a big mistake that is. Hey, Dean. Lunch is on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Stop.",
        "Frank: Stop what?",
        "Harley: Stop looking at me like I'm crazy. I'm not crazy.",
        "Frank: We don't think you're crazy.",
        "Harley: Because you're worried about me, I know. But let me tell you something I know that nobody else knows: Gus is coming back, or he's meeting me in Hawaii or whatever. But he's not going to let me down. He promised me he never would.",
        "Frank: Sis...",
        "Harley: Don't. Okay, don't. What are you doing? We have work to do.",
        "Alan-Michael: Actually, I think we're all set.",
        "Harley: What about the press release on Mrs. Sutherland's cookies?",
        "Alan-Michael: It's all squared away.",
        "Harley: But I thought you said the numbers didn't match.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, I cleared it up with accounting. It's fine now.",
        "Harley: Well, I'll call you tomorrow just to make sure everything's...",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley.",
        "Harley: Am I micromanaging?",
        "Alan-Michael: Something like that. Just think vacation. Have a little fun.",
        "Harley: Fine. No, I'll try. Thank you, again.",
        "Alan-Michael: No problem. Safe trip. Buzz, Frank, see you guys later. Yeah, this is Alan-Michael Spaulding. Do I have any messages? Nothing from Marina Cooper? Okay. Thanks.",
        "Buzz: Well?",
        "Frank: Well, what? She's obviously in denial.",
        "Buzz: Frank, the chances of Gus being alive are what?",
        "Frank: Are slim to none.",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Frank: And the sooner we all get to the reality of that, the better we'll be able to help her.",
        "Buzz: What was he thinking of, running off like that?",
        "Frank: That's the whole point. He wasn't thinking. He does this every single time. He just takes off thinking he is protecting her, and he is killing her. Look, she's dying of a broken heart over there.",
        "Buzz: Frank, she expects Gus to meet them when she gets to Hawaii.",
        "Frank: Well, guess what?",
        "Buzz: He's not there.",
        "Frank: We can't let her go, Pop.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, you've got to talk to her.",
        "Frank: Me?",
        "Buzz: Frank, she trusts you. She'll handle it better coming from you. Frank.",
        "Harley: No, I'm right here. Don't hold back. Say what's on your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Hey. How are you?",
        "Ava: Fine. What can I get you?",
        "Sandy: Some hot chocolate would be terrific, especially if you could join me.",
        "Ava: I'm busy.",
        "Sandy: I think your two customers will survive.",
        "Ava: I'm sorry, um... but are we friends?",
        "Sandy: I don't know. We could be.",
        "Ava: I bet that's what you're telling all of your ex's lately.",
        "Sandy: Ouch. Yes, Tammy and I are over.",
        "Ava: Then why did you testify for her and Jonathan in court?",
        "Sandy: Because that was the right thing to do.",
        "Ava: Sure.",
        "Sandy: Why are you so angry with me?",
        "Ava: I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that you're not the person that I thought you were.",
        "Sandy: If it's about the kiss...",
        "Ava: It's not about the kiss. It's about a lot of other things, Sandy.",
        "Sandy: You're a big Tammy and Jonathan fan?",
        "Ava: I am a fan of Jonathan, yes. You know what? He helped me out when I came to town, when I was in big trouble. I think you're just mad because Tammy chose Jonathan instead of you.",
        "Sandy: No, no, no. I'm over that. I'm not fighting it anymore. I just want Tammy to be happy. You, too. And if I can help, let me know. I have a lot to make up for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Honey, I'm home!",
        "Tammy: Hey, you.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, you.",
        "Tammy: Where'd you go so early?",
        "Jonathan: Business.",
        "Tammy: Bar business?",
        "Jonathan: Nope, personal business. And I have some good news.",
        "Tammy: Good news?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Well, what is it?",
        "Jonathan: What is what?",
        "Tammy: Your news.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah. I saw Mel's dad today, the Dean.",
        "Tammy: Where did you see him?",
        "Jonathan: Co2. He has lunch there a lot.",
        "Tammy: You didn't say anything to him about me, did you?",
        "Jonathan: What else am I going to talk to him about?",
        "Tammy: Oh, no. What did you say?",
        "Jonathan: I told him that you're a good student and that you wanted to go back to school. And I think he might come around. I was very persuasive.",
        "Tammy: Oh, my God. You threatened him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: My dad was right as usual! I hate that!",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina?",
        "Marina: Hi. So where have you been?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Why don't we sit down?",
        "Harley: No, I'm fine right here. Go ahead and talk. You both seem to have a lot to say.",
        "Buzz: Not me, Frank.",
        "Frank: Okay, Pop, thanks. Sis, I initially thought Hawaii was a good idea...",
        "Harley: It is a good idea.",
        "Frank: I was with you at the crash site. I wanted to find Gus as much as you did, but all we found was a wallet and cell phone.",
        "Harley: And no body.",
        "Frank: Honey, please.",
        "Buzz: A lot of time has passed.",
        "Harley: Says who? You? Frank?",
        "Frank: Sis, come on, you can't keep going on like this.",
        "Harley: Like what? Like someone who has faith that the person they loves is going to come back to them. Gus would never let it end like that. We have been through too much together.",
        "Frank: We have searched for weeks.",
        "Harley: I know it's bad. I'm not oblivious to that. But I won't give up; I won't.",
        "Zach: Mommy.",
        "Harley: Hey, sweetie.",
        "Zach: Is Gus in Hawaii yet?",
        "Harley: Not yet. You guys are pretty excited, huh?",
        "Zach: When are we leaving?",
        "Harley: We're leaving soon, very soon. Like I said. Go play.",
        "Buzz: If he's not in Hawaii what are you going to tell them?",
        "Harley: If?",
        "Frank: They're going to ask you, Sis.",
        "Harley: And I will answer. But they need this, too. Look at them. It's an adventure for them.",
        "Buzz: We just don't want to see this come crashing down on all of you.",
        "Harley: Gus could be back tomorrow or the next day. You don't know, okay? Nobody does.",
        "Man: I'm looking for Harley cooper.",
        "Harley: I'm Harley cooper.",
        "Man: Sign here, please.",
        "Harley: Here. It's from Gus. ( Laughing )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky Paul Golden, \"inside The Light.\" The most important thing to Gus is love, and just having a family against all odds. I am romantic, and I love love, but I think I'm a lot more afraid of love than he is. Harley is the only woman Gus has ever loved so far. See Gus, Wednesday, February 1, \"inside The Light.\"",

        "Harley: Look what the Gus sent us!",
        "Zach: Swim goggles!",
        "Harley: And look, a pineapple! He knows I hate pineapple. That's the joke. Get it?",
        "Buzz: What's this?",
        "Harley: That's a hula girl. You put her in the car and she dances for you. Show them, Grandpa.",
        "Frank: Hey, Sis, can I see the card?",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Frank: This is not Gus's handwriting.",
        "Harley: Duh, he ordered it.",
        "Frank: He could have.",
        "Harley: Frank, thing positive please.",
        "Zach: Where's the flipper?",
        "Harley: There's only one flipper? Well, we'll have to get another one. Do they have flippers at Egan's, Daddy?",
        "Frank: This time of year, Sis? I mean...",
        "Harley: Guys, get your coats. We're going to go.",
        "Buzz: What? Harley!",
        "Harley: I'm not insane. I will call the place that this was delivered from and I will find out when it was ordered. In the meantime, we're looking for a flipper, Grandpa.",
        "Frank: Okay, then at least let me drive you, okay.",
        "Harley: And have you ruin our good time with your sourpuss? I don't think so. I have been waiting for a sign! And this is it! Are you guys ready? Okay. Let's go! We'll see you later.",
        "Buzz: I'll be right back.",
        "Frank: Hold on, where are you going?",
        "Buzz: Harley has her hunches and I have mine.",

        "Alan-Michael: So what happened? Did you get my messages?",
        "Marina: Yeah, I got them.",

        "Alan-Michael: Yes, you are. And I couldn't be happier.",
        "Alan-Michael: What's the matter?",
        "Marina: Nothing.",
        "Alan-Michael: Okay. Then come here. Where were we last night? Right. I think this was on the floor.",
        "Marina: Alan-Michael...",
        "Alan-Michael: It's me. What's your name?",
        "Marina: Wait, you just stand over there and I am going to be right over here.",
        "Alan-Michael: Interesting. However, unfulfilling in the end. Come here.",
        "Marina: No, I... I just can't do this.",
        "Alan-Michael: I get it. You need more time.",
        "Marina: That's not it, you idiot! Or maybe I'm the idiot.",
        "Alan-Michael: What's going on here?",
        "Marina: You're a real good charmer, you know that? You actually had me believing everything. But let me tell you something. You've batted those baby blues for the last time. I'm on to you, Mr. Big Shot.",
        "Alan-Michael: Mr. Big Shot? Did you just call me Mr. Big Shot? What are you, six? You're serious, aren't you?",
        "Marina: Yes, I am. I found the papers about you taking Harley's job.",
        "Alan-Michael: What papers?",
        "Marina: Stop, okay? I found them in your jacket. I was holding them in my hands.",
        "Alan-Michael: What were you doing going through my jacket?",
        "Marina: When are you going to stop stabbing Harley in the back?",
        "Alan-Michael: I thought a good cop weighed the evidence.",
        "Marina: Just stop, how long have you been playing my aunt?",
        "Alan-Michael: Ask me what you really want to know, Marina. How long have I been playing you?",

        "Buzz: Gus? When?",
        "Man: He ordered the basket about a month ago, Buzz. Just before New Year's.",

        "Jonathan: Believe me, I know that.",
        "Tammy: If I wanted to talk to the Dean I would have done it myself.",
        "Jonathan: You haven't yet. Don't you still want to go back to school?",
        "Tammy: No, not right now.",
        "Jonathan: You have to go and you have to finish.",
        "Tammy: Who says? My mom.",
        "Jonathan: I thought you had hopes of doing this. You wanted to go into business?",
        "Tammy: My mom didn't go to college, neither did Reva.",
        "Jonathan: That's a good excuse. Now you're done with school?",

        "Jonathan: Oh, great. Wait until your mom hears about this.",
        "Tammy: Don't you see? You have turned my life upside down. In a good way. In a great way. I was playing it safe before you came into my life, on autopilot. But I don't have to do that anymore. I don't have to do what's expected of me. I can just do what I want and what I feel. And I don't feel like going back to school right now.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. So what do you want to do?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. But I'll let you know when I figure it out.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, this wreaks of mid-life crisis. You've been spending too much time with Reva.",
        "Tammy: No, this is all me. If you don't like it...",
        "Jonathan: I like it. I like it.",
        "Tammy: You're not just saying that?",
        "Jonathan: Uh-uh. Honest to God, it is really hot seeing you stand up for yourself. It's, like, nice. I did this for you?",
        "Tammy: You helped me see things more clearly. I can handle my future. Just like I handled Sandy.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: He was here before. I invited him.",
        "Jonathan: Why?",
        "Tammy: To thank him for what he did for us.",
        "Jonathan: He lied for us. People who lie, they do that because they want something. In this case, he wants you.",
        "Tammy: I don't know.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: I thought the same thing at first. And I even called him on it. But he said he's over me.",
        "Jonathan: Oh...",
        "Tammy: I think... I think he really is.",
        "Jonathan: You know, I can't believe that Sandy tells you he doesn't want to be with you and you're stupid enough to believe that crap!",
        "Tammy: So what if he is lying? It doesn't matter to me because I love you.",
        "Jonathan: Sandy had his chance to throw me to the wolves, have me locked up, throw you out here so he's got a clear shot at you.",
        "Tammy: Sandy says he doesn't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with him.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, right.",
        "Tammy: So that's why he's leaving town?",
        "Jonathan: He said that?",
        "Tammy: He said he was thinking about it. To be honest I kind of hope he does. I hate to keep running into him all the time.",
        "Jonathan: A Sandman free zone huh?",
        "Tammy: You could get used to the idea?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah.",
        "Tammy: It would be nice to have one less obstacle to fight.",
        "Jonathan: Phenomenon hmm.",
        "Tammy: Reva's going to be home soon.",
        "Jonathan: So what?",
        "Tammy: So let's go someplace where we can be alone.",
        "Jonathan: Alone? Alone? Alone?",
        "Tammy: Just come on. Stop thinking about Sandy, please? I have. And he has stopped thinking about me, I'm sure of it.",

        "Dean Boudreau: An admirable attitude considering what happened between the two of you.",
        "Sandy: I messed up. What can I say?",
        "Dean Boudreau: It takes a big man to admit he was wrong. I can't say the same for her other friend. He's a real piece of work, that man.",
        "Sandy: Trouble from the day he set foot into town. Thank you very much for your time.",

        "Ava: Losing somebody you love, it's not easy. I'll never get over my mom. But by you just being there for her it means so much.",
        "Buzz: I wish I could believe that.",
        "Ava: You guys, you're a family. You're... you're amazing! You love each other. And you like each other at the same time. That is so special. Losing her husband, you know, it will be devastating, it will. But she has all of you to lean on and hold her up. Really. It's not going to be easy for Harley, but she'll get through it.",

        "Marina: Then I would say what was it doing your in your jacket?",
        "Alan-Michael: Probably wouldn't believe me. I was trying to squelch the whole thing. It didn't start with me, Marina. Mcmullen, he's a big shareholder, one of Alan's cronies. He's the one that drafted it.",
        "Marina: Really?",
        "Alan-Michael: Really. He thinks that a woman shouldn't be CEO, especially one as inexperienced as Harley.",
        "Marina: Did you agree with him?",
        "Alan-Michael: Are you crazy, my Aunt Alex is one of the best CEO's this company has ever had. Harley's doing a damn fine job herself. I had no desire to take it away from her.",
        "Marina: Is this supposed to convince me?",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't care if it does or not. I want you to go now.",

        "Marina: Look, what if I did jump to conclusions?",
        "Alan-Michael: Sorry, it's a little late.",
        "Marina: Well, won't you just let me explain myself? You know how skeptical I am, especially when it comes to people in your family.",

I know that you are mad at Gus for putting me through all this. And believe me, after I kiss him I plan to kill him, too. Would you cheer up? Dead people don't send gift baskets.",

        "Harley: You know what? You never liked Gus. Neither did Daddy. Is that why you're doing this to me? Because you don't even want him to come back!",
