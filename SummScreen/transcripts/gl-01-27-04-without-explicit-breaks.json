        "Delivery Guy: Delivery for Olivia Spencer.",
        "Cassie: Oh, she's not here right now. But I can sign for it. Here.",
        "Delivery Guy: Okay. But there are instructions to go with the medication.",
        "Cassie: Oh. All right. Well, let me right them down. Shoot.",
        "Delivery Guy: Three drops twice a day after feeding or formula. That's it.",
        "Cassie: \"After feeding or formula?\"",
        "Gas Repairman: Everything looks okay. Seal's tight. No cracks in the fittings.",
        "Danny: All right. Well, just... will you... I want you to check everything, the entire gas line, for leaks. I want to make sure this was an accident.",
        "Gas Repairman: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Dad.",
        "Ed: Hi. Look, I know you said you were all right, but I just had to see for myself. Here.",
        "Michelle: Is that thing for you or for me?",
        "Ed: Yeah, I know, I know. Come on. Your blood may not be fully oxygenated yet. Sit down. Just indulge me, okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Ed: So I'll put that... How did this happen?",
        "Michelle: I turned on the fireplace, and I sat down to read, and I got incredibly sleepy. And that's about all I remember.",
        "Ed: It was an accident?",
        "Michelle: Why do you ask?",
        "Reva: You have any more shrimp left in there?",
        "Marah: I think you got them all.",
        "Reva: Uh-huh? Yeah? All of them? You know, it wasn't that long ago that I didn't think we'd ever be doing this again.",
        "Marah: Well, I am still a little upset with you about the whole Sandy thing, but cold sesame noodles help. Yum.",
        "Reva: Yeah. You know what? They're your father's favorites, too.",
        "Marah: Have you spoken to him lately?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, we have. Things seem to be a little better between us. But, you know, he's still dealing with something that he's not quite ready to share with me. I mean, you must have noticed how distant he's been.",
        "Marah: Yeah. Almost like a stranger.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Well, it'll be over soon.",
        "Marah: Is that what he said?",
        "Reva: Yeah. He actually said he was going to make things right.",
        "Josh: You got here pretty quick.",
        "Billy: Yeah. What's up?",
        "Josh: I'm ending it. I just figured you should know.",
        "Billy: Josh, we've been through this so many times.",
        "Josh: I know, Billy. It's been almost thirty years, and you want me to keep this secret for another thirty. But time is up. I can't do it. I'm going to the police.",
        "Michelle: You know, if I'm in danger, it's because you refused to be honest with me.",
        "Ed: My God. How can you think that I would allow this to... that I would cause something like this to happen? I am trying to protect you.",
        "Michelle: Except when your top priority is to protect yourself. You know, the real irony here is I'm trying to protect you.",
        "Ed: Well, how are you doing that, by making these insane accusations? By badgering me all the time?",
        "Michelle: By keeping your secret. By defending you. You know, I even threatened... Forget it.",
        "Ed: To what? Michelle, who did you threaten?",
        "Michelle: Look, thanks for bringing this by.",
        "Ed: No, don't do that. You've got to answer me. Who did you threaten? Michelle, this is not a game. You could have died.",
        "Danny: So just help me out here. If nothing's wrong with the gas line, I just... it doesn't... what about the pilot light? If, let's say, it blew out, wouldn't the gas just keep flowing?",
        "Gas Repairman: On older units, maybe, but yours is brand new. It's got a safety pilot. If the flame goes out, the gas shuts down automatically.",
        "Danny: Right. And that pilot's working?",
        "Gas Repairman: I tested it three times. The only way that gas would have kept coming in is if it had help.",
        "Danny: What do you mean? Are you telling me that the fireplace was tampered with?",
        "Gas Repairman: Well, in a way. My bet is your wife didn't understand the system, and when the pilot went out she fiddled with the controls and overrode the cutoff, and the gas started again.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Yeah, that must be what happened.",
        "Blake: Good luck.",
        "Ross: Thank you. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Karen, how are you?",
        "Mayor: Ross, I...",
        "Ross: I know that you have a meeting scheduled with Danny Santos, but he has yet to arrive. Therefore, I'm not keeping you from him, am I?",
        "Mayor: No wonder you've won the lion's share of all of your court cases.",
        "Ross: I'll get right to the point. I know that you're about to endorse someone for mayor, and the fact that you are having a sit-down meeting with Danny Santos leads me to believe the nod will not be going to me.",
        "Mayor: I always keep an open mind until an actual commitment is made.",
        "Ross: Good. I would like to express my deep concerns for this city that we all love. I'm sure that you have heard the rumors about a power struggle between the Salerno and the Bruzi Crime Syndicates. Now, if we don't act decisively and wisely, Springfield is going to find itself in the middle of a mob war. And I don't have to tell you the havoc that would cause.",
        "Mayor: What are you telling me, Ross?",
        "Ross: Now, don't get me wrong. I like Danny Santos. But in this... in this crisis, I firmly believe he's totally wrong man for the job.",
        "Mayor: And the right man would be you?",
        "Ross: Mr. Mayor, let's say that you endorse Danny Santos, and he's elected. What happens if all hell breaks loose and Danny resorts to doing what some people think he does best -- threats, intimidation, violence? Or worse yet, what if he cuts some deal with the crime family? That would be a disaster, and it would take years to repair. And you would forever be known as The Man Who Handed Springfield Over To the Criminals. Now, that is not the legacy you want, is it, Mr. Mayor?",
        "Olivia: Cassie, where is the paperwork on the Textile Designer's Conference?",
        "Cassie: Oh, I already took care of it.",
        "Olivia: Oh, okay.",
        "Cassie: This came for you.",
        "Olivia: Oh. Good. Thanks. It's the ear infection.",
        "Cassie: Ah.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I get them all the time.",
        "Cassie: Is there anything I can do?",
        "Olivia: No. I'm okay, thanks. You know what? I actually gave Amcorp that extra block of rooms.",
        "Cassie: I need to talk to you.",
        "Olivia: I can't. I have to run out. Visiting hours at Ravenwood are almost up.",
        "Cassie: I thought you already saw Phillip today.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. No, I did. It's just that I forgot to tell him something, so I have to go back. So, I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Olivia? Feel better.",
        "Reva: I was so angry with your father after the accident.",
        "Marah: It seemed like you hated him.",
        "Reva: Well, deep down inside I knew he'd never do anything to hurt Shayne, and he was hurting himself a thousand times worse than I ever could. You know, maybe that's what this is all about. Maybe that's why he's still so upset and won't move back in here -- he still feels guilty.",
        "Marah: He's not over what he did?",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, that's your father. He's a good, decent, honest man who hates to make mistakes. And that's why we love him so much. Not to mention the fact that he's so hyper-responsible. What are you thinking?",
        "Marah: Did I ever tell you about show and tell in first grade?",
        "Reva: Not that I recall.",
        "Marah: Mrs. Eakland told us to bring in our most treasured thing, and I brought in Dad. There he was, among all the mineral collections and gerbils. And he had to listen to me telling everyone how perfect he was -- he was the best father ever. And he was such a good sport. He smiled all the way through it. I didn't figure out how embarrassed he was by the whole \"perfect\" thing until much later.",
        "Reva: That's a lot to live up to.",
        "Marah: Yeah, too much, even for the best dad.",
        "Reva: Honey, it's okay. I know you still love him.",
        "Marah: Yeah, I do. And I don't need him to be perfect anymore. Just good and honest is enough.",
        "Billy: Okay, Josh. Listen and listen good. You will keep your mouth shut on this whole thing.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. Twenty-six years, that's my limit.",
        "Billy: Now, you look -- don't push me, Josh.",
        "Josh: Billy, there's nothing you can do short of throwing me over this railing right now that's going to stop me from telling the truth. I have made up my mind.",
        "Billy: Look, you may think you're doing the right thing here, but you're throwing your own flesh and blood to the wolves.",
        "Josh: I didn't say it was going to be easy. I just said I was going to do it.",
        "Billy: Well, what about your oath? Doesn't that mean anything to you?",
        "Josh: You want to know what that means?",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Josh: It means this -- I can be sitting at my desk, I can be driving along in my car, going to some meeting or something, and suddenly I get a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach because I remember that I was part of covering up the death of a person who shouldn't have died in the first place.",
        "Billy: Oh, well, this is great. You're going to go to the cops, you're going to say, \"Hey, me, my brother, and three other guys, well, we accidentally killed this girl thirty years ago, and we decided not to say anything, because we thought that was the right thing to do back then.\"",
        "Josh: That's pretty much it, yes.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, you can't do it, Josh.",
        "Josh: Why don't we go together? Why don't we talk to the police together? Because that's the way it should be, don't you think?",
        "Billy: Stop talking nonsense, Little Brother.",
        "Josh: Don't call me that.",
        "Billy: Oh, you got some other problems with me?",
        "Josh: Just don't call me that. You know why? Because just because you were born a few years before I was, it doesn't mean that you get to call the shots in my life that I need to make for myself.",
        "Billy: Yeah, except this shot is going to hit me right between the eyes. And Little Brother, I am not going to let you pull the trigger.",
        "Josh: I'm going to put an end to this thing, all right? That's the way it's going to be. That's the bottom line. You don't get a vote.",
        "(Blow lands)",
        "Josh: That was great. That was good. Thank you very much. I appreciate... I hope that made you feel like a man. You know, that you know that when all else fails, you can just deck the guy.",
        "Billy: Look, Josh, thirty years ago we made the tough choice. You just haven't had the cajones...",
        "Josh: Thirty years ago we made the coward's choice.",
        "Billy: No, we did what was right for us!",
        "Josh: What was right for us? What about her? What about the girl that's lying at the bottom of the river? What about her family? Yeah, the five of us, we were really strong, weren't we, with our pact of silence? You know what the right choice, what the tough choice would have been, Billy? To go to the police that night and accept the consequences.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah, Josh, that would have been great. Five guys and one girl, and we're out joyriding after drinking beer that's been spiked with drugs, and when this girl dies, well, we...",
        "Josh: It was an accident, Billy!",
        "Billy: Oh, I see. \"It was an accident,\" says the DA to Josh. \"Well, in that case, everything's okay.\" Josh, a crime is a crime.",
        "Josh: The crime was trying to cover it up. The crime was not saying anything about it. This hard choice that we made that was supposed to make things so much better made things a thousand times worse.",
        "Billy: Oh, Josh, Josh, we've all done real well, all five of us.",
        "Josh: And what does that say about us? That's great. This thing happened to this poor girl, but we all went on with our lives. That's great.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Well, Josh, you know, I don't have any problems with this whole thing. I mean, I did what I had to do that night, and...",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Billy: Yes.",
        "Josh: No problems?",
        "Billy: No.",
        "Josh: You want to go inside for a few minutes, have another drink, and talk about that?",
        "Billy: You know, I don't think we had the same father.",
        "Josh: Don't even go there, Billy. We see this thing from a different perspective, that's all.",
        "Billy: Oh, I see. You see it from the father, the pillar of the community, the big muck-a-muck, and I see it from the slimy snake position, is that it? Look, Josh. I've always wanted what was right for you.",
        "Josh: I know that.",
        "Billy: What was the best.",
        "Josh: I know. You love me. I love you. But Billy, what I'm doing here, this choice I'm making, it's the hard choice, but it's the right choice.",
        "Billy: All right. Well, you tell me how this conscience-clearing choice is going to sit with you when it ruins four peoples' lives, ruins their careers and their family. Josh, that's exactly what it's going to do. And hey, Buddy, I've been to prison. I do not intend on going back.",
        "Josh: You won't have to go back. Nobody will go to prison, at least not because of me.",
        "Billy: Okay. How?",
        "Josh: When I go to the police, I'm going to tell them that the accident was my fault and my fault alone, because I was the only one in the car with Maryanne Caruthers.",
        "Danny: Hey, Ed. So what's the word? How is she?",
        "Michelle: \"She\" is fine, and you have got to get to that meeting with the mayor.",
        "Danny: No, I was going to cancel it.",
        "Michelle: No, Danny. No. You're this close to getting his endorsement. No way. And you know what? Nico called, he's on his way home, my dad's here, so I am in good hands.",
        "Danny: Are you sure? Because I really...",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. Yes, go.",
        "Danny: Okay. All right. It won't take long. You're sure?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: All right.",
        "Michelle: Bye.",
        "Danny: See you.",
        "Ed: Is it worth it, hiding all this stuff from Danny, attacking me? What happened here tonight, is it really worth it?",
        "Michelle: You tell me.",
        "Ed: Michelle, I love you more than anything in this world. Do you still know that?",
        "Michelle: Yes.",
        "Ed: If anything were to happen to you, I don't think that I could live through it.",
        "Michelle: Oh, boy. Aren't you being a little melodramatic now?",
        "Ed: Why don't you believe me?",
        "Michelle: You talk to me about playing games, and you're the one who's pretending.",
        "Ed: Why do we always end up in this same place?",
        "Michelle: Because you refuse to acknowledge something that you were a part of over thirty years ago.",
        "Ed: Oh, for God's sake!",
        "Michelle: You still deny it, right? Even now. You know, ten minutes ago, you told me that I could have died. And ten seconds ago, you said that if anything happened to me, it would kill you. All you're doing now is you're just protecting yourself. That's really all you care about, isn't it?",
        "Ed: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: No. No, no, no, no, no. I've had it, Dad. I've really had it. I want you to leave. You can take your oxygen and your rationalizations and go. I mean it -- go.",
        "Ross: So I said what I had to say.",
        "Blake: And I'll bet the mayor gave you his endorsement.",
        "Ross: Well, that was not my main reason for going over there. I just wanted him to think twice before endorsing Danny Santos. If this city is going to face a crisis, you don't want to mince words.",
        "Blake: Well, if the mob is trying to gain power in Springfield, then the last person we need as mayor is Danny Santos.",
        "Ross: Yeah. But if Mayor Hamilton wants to endorse me, I won't complain, I won't refuse. So who does Charlie the Bartender want to see elected?",
        "Blake: Oh, we didn't really get into politics. At least not directly.",
        "Ross: What do you mean, not directly?",
        "Blake: Well, Charlie didn't have much dirt tonight. Strictly boring, you know, nothing stuff. But then he told me about the nurses who came in after their shift at Cedars tonight.",
        "Ross: And?",
        "Blake: And they were gossiping about the fact that Tony Santos was brought into the ER tonight.",
        "Ross: Why? What happened to him?",
        "Blake: Knife wound. Apparently he was in a fight.",
        "Ross: A fight... wow. So much for the clean living Santos Family.",
        "Blake: Well, you know, I don't think Tony's a bad guy. I just think he has a hard time staying out of trouble, which can't thrill his cousin, the candidate.",
        "Ross: Yes. And I suppose barroom gossip was the only way we were going to hear about Tony's incident.",
        "Blake: Oh, there's no way Danny and Bill are ever going to let this get into the papers.",
        "Ross: They're going to do everything they can to keep it out of the papers. Bad publicity like this, that's the last thing Danny needs.",
        "Olivia: Hello, I'm home!",
        "Cassie: Hi, Honey.",
        "Olivia: You know, you had no right to follow me here.",
        "Cassie: No?",
        "Olivia: No. This is none of your business.",
        "Cassie: Business? Yes, Olivia, this is all about my business. Because we're partners -- partners. Only you keep leaving. And you're so secretive, and you're evasive, and you're acting downright weird. And I don't really understand...",
        "(Baby crying)",
        "Olivia: Just go. Go, please. I just need to be alone, okay?",
        "Cassie: But you're not alone. That sounds like a little girl.",
        "Olivia: It's my daughter. My baby didn't die, Cassie. She's alive.",
        "Danny: Mr. Mayor, hi. I'm sorry.",
        "Mayor: Hello, Danny.",
        "Danny: Hi.",
        "Mayor: You know my aide, Karen Patterson.",
        "Danny: Yes, hi, Karen. Please, sit. Don't get up. I'm really, really sorry that I'm late. I just... something unexpected came up at home. I had to take care of it.",
        "Mayor: Not a problem, I hope.",
        "Danny: No, no, no. Nothing like that. Everything's fine.",
        "Mayor: Well, speaking of problems, let me ask you something, Danny.",
        "Danny: Sure. Go ahead.",
        "Mayor: I've gotten reports that a couple of major organized crime syndicates may be heading for a turf war in Springfield. What do you know about it?",
        "Danny: Well, to be honest with you, I don't know any more than you. I'm not a part of that world anymore. I probably get my information from pretty much the same sources as you.",
        "Mayor: But you have no reason to doubt the warnings are legitimate.",
        "Danny: Well, I have heard that there could be -- could be -- some trouble, yes.",
        "Mayor: That's unfortunate, not just for the city, for the election.",
        "Danny: How do you mean?",
        "Mayor: Politics is a lot like making love, Danny. Timing is everything.",
        "Danny: That's good. I'll have to remember that one.",
        "Mayor: I'm rethinking my position, Santos.",
        "Danny: What, not endorsing me?",
        "Mayor: You know, I was fully prepared to back you.",
        "Danny: Past tense.",
        "Mayor: If there weren't rumblings about an underworld power struggle, there'd be no question about it. But as things stand, it's too risky to throw it in for you. I can't be seen as soft on organized crime.",
        "Danny: Well, Mr. Mayor, let me... have you... did you by any chance have a conversation with Ross Marler before I got here?",
        "Mayor: I keep in touch with a great many people.",
        "Danny: So, about your endorsement?",
        "Mayor: I've decided to support Mr. Marler. I'm sorry, Danny. I hope you'll understand.",
        "Danny: You know what I admire about you, Mr. Mayor? You always stick to your principles, whatever you decide they are on any particular day.",
        "Mayor: I think we're through here, Karen.",
        "Aide: Mr. Santos.",
        "Danny: Ross, Blake.",
        "Ross: Hello.",
        "Danny: Looks like it was a pretty fortuitous evening for you, wasn't it? You know what they say -- timing is everything.",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Marah: Hello?",
        "Michelle: Are you home?",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Michelle: You need to pick up Marina and get over here now, okay?",
        "Marah: Why? What's going on?",
        "Michelle: I'll just... I'll tell you when we're together. Just hurry, and be careful.",
        "Billy: So you're going to take the rap for all the rest of us.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's it.",
        "Billy: Josh, it's never going to work.",
        "Josh: Frank will believe me.",
        "Billy: Why will he believe you?",
        "Josh: Because I'll make him believe me.",
        "Billy: What are you going to tell him?",
        "Josh: I'm going to tell him that I was at the fair, I was by myself, I was following this woman around who was older than I was, so she wasn't giving me the time of day. I was drinking, I was trying to come on to her, but she wasn't having anything to do with me.",
        "Billy: Well, this story's pretty...",
        "Josh: But eventually I talked Alan into loaning me his car, and then I talked the girl into going for a ride with me. The car went into the river, it was freezing cold, the current was strong. I tried to find her, but I couldn't.",
        "Billy: And you were too drunk.",
        "Josh: That's right. In fact, I was so drunk... I was so drunk that I freaked out when I realized the woman had drowned, and I was very scared about what that would mean to me, and what it would mean to my family.",
        "Billy: Josh, Josh, this whole thing's crazy. It's crazy.",
        "Josh: It's no crazier than what really happened.",
        "Billy: Yeah, but it's never going to work. Don't you understand? The girls know there were five people in that car. Ditto for this idiot who's trying to make our lives hell.",
        "Josh: Maybe this person just wants one of us to come forward to take responsibility. And if that person has to be me, then that's fine.",
        "Billy: Okay. So you go to jail, and we all go free.",
        "Josh: No, this is not about martyrdom. This is not about me wanting to go to jail, Billy. In fact, I'm going to spend a lot of time in court trying to convince them that it was an accident. But, at the very least, it will put an end to everything. It will be over! And if that brings everyone involved peace, so much the better.",
        "Billy: Well, just tell me something, Josh. I mean, this is going to be over. Is it going to be over after they run you downtown and arrest you, and then after they fingerprint you and throw you in the clink, and after they drag you into court, and this gets on the front page of every paper, and your family is humiliated? Is that when it's going to be over, Josh?",
        "Josh: Billy.",
        "Billy: Or supposing you don't beat the rap, and then you have to go to Vailsburg, and you have to say goodbye to your family and your friends and your loved ones forever? Kind of adds a new meaning to the word \"over,\" doesn't it, Josh?",
        "Josh: Believe me, that's the first thing I thought about. But it's a risk I'm going to have to take.",
        "(Baby crying)",
        "Cassie: Well, go to her.",
        "Olivia: Sam's with her.",
        "Cassie: You lied to everyone, and you told everyone your baby was dead. Phillip, the baby's father. Olivia, that is sick.",
        "Olivia: No, I had no choice.",
        "Cassie: You say that about every selfish thing you do.",
        "Olivia: I had to protect my child. She was in danger. Emma was in danger, and she still might be.",
        "Cassie: Emma. That's a beautiful name.",
        "Olivia: You of all people should understand. What I did is no different than you trying to get away from Edmund on San Cristo...",
        "Cassie: Don't even... don't. You can't compare them, because your baby's alive, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: That's right. And there is nothing I wouldn't do to keep it that way.",
        "Cassie: So Lizzie is the big threat?",
        "Olivia: She's insane. She hates me. Who knows how far she would go to prove it? Looks at what she's done to me already.",
        "Cassie: It's not like she's, you know, waiting around town for you to come back so she can attack again.",
        "Olivia: Do you know that? You don't know that. Her shrink warned me about her. What does that say?",
        "Cassie: Okay, if you're so afraid of Lizzie, then why'd you come back?",
        "Olivia: I didn't... I was going to steer clear of Springfield altogether. I was going to raise Emma someplace else and contact Phillip eventually. You know, once Lizzie had grown up or grown sane. But I had to tie up loose ends. I had to organize my finances. I had to make sure that I could raise Emma someplace safe, you know? I never intended to stay this long.",
        "Cassie: So why the change of plans?",
        "Olivia: Phillip. When I heard that he had had a breakdown, I just... I knew that a big part of it was caused by me, and my trouble with Lizzie.",
        "Cassie: So you stuck around because you felt like you owed it to Phillip to help rehabilitate him?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. It was the least I could do.",
        "Cassie: That sounds good, but not convincing. I don't buy it, Olivia.",
        "Danny: You obviously had a very good meeting with the mayor.",
        "Ross: Well, it wasn't a meeting per se. We just ran into him.",
        "Danny: Pretty productive for a chance encounter.",
        "Blake: Ross and the mayor have always been on good terms, Danny.",
        "Danny: I'd say so, if he's endorsing you.",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Danny: Oh, he didn't tell you? I am so glad to be the one to break the news.",
        "Ross: I did not go over there to solicit an endorsement. But I did express my concern that the next mayor be the right man for the job.",
        "Danny: Did you also express your concern that there may be a turf war around the corner, and then pitch yourself as the proper law and order candidate to take care of it?",
        "Blake: Maybe we should go.",
        "Ross: No, no, no, no. No, the mayor was aware of that situation. He's also aware of my capabilities.",
        "Danny: You just put things in a certain light.",
        "Ross: Well, lighting is what you do, Danny, when you want somebody to understand and see something.",
        "Danny: Ross, for the candidate who is supposedly the good guy in this campaign, you haven't exactly overwhelmed me with your sense of honor.",
        "Ross: I was thinking as much about Springfield as I was my political career. But make no mistake -- they're both important to me.",
        "Danny: In other words, you're not in this to lose.",
        "Ross: Who is?",
        "Danny: You just... you love, love to project this lily white image of yourself, but you know, I could go to the mayor or the press and bring certain things to their attention -- brushes with the law you've had, certain... oh, certain indiscretions. Neither one of you is an angel.",
        "Blake: Technically, that is my job title.",
        "Ross: Blake...",
        "Danny: It's okay. Relax. I'm not into running a smear campaign. That's not my style. I'm clean now, as clean as you are. Or as clean as you say you are.",
        "Ross: And you're inferring what by that?",
        "Danny: Oh, nothing. Nothing. But notice how easy it is to tip things toward the negative? You just dangle a few ironic words, say them with a smile. Don't worry. I plan to run on my merits, not your weaknesses. Whatever your policy is, that's up to you.",
        "Ross: Yeah, and speaking of that, could we iron out a couple of details about the debate so long as you're here?",
        "Danny: You know what? I'm sorry. It's not a very good time for me. I'll have my people call your people and we'll set something up. That is what real politicians do, right?",
        "Marina: You passed out?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Well, right before I did, I looked up, and guess who I saw standing over me, holding a scarf over her mouth? Carrie.",
        "Marina: Well, did she say anything?",
        "Michelle: Nope.",
        "Marah: Did you say anything?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I begged her to help me. And she just stood there looking at me, and then I passed out, and when I woke up, Danny and Bill were here.",
        "Marina: Oh, wait, wait. She didn't even try to, like, open up a window or help you off the couch or anything?",
        "Michelle: No. I'm telling you, she just stood there.",
        "Marah: How scary is that? It sounded like Carrie wanted you to die.",
        "Marina: Michelle, do you think Carrie was trying to kill you?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. Maybe.",
        "Josh: Frank, hey, it's Josh. Yeah. I was wondering if... I was wondering if we could talk for a few minutes tomorrow morning, if you have time. No, actually I think the police station would be a good place. I'll tell you tomorrow when I see you. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: You come back to Springfield out of the goodness of your heart when you just now told me yourself that your baby is not safe here? Now, that doesn't make sense to me. There's more to it, isn't there?",
        "Olivia: Well, we really are becoming partners. You're getting to know me.",
        "Cassie: What's the plan?",
        "Olivia: Phillip and I got married tonight.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Olivia: It's the best thing for everyone.",
        "Cassie: Marrying a man who's institutionalized?",
        "Olivia: I couldn't afford to wait.",
        "Cassie: Do you love him?",
        "Olivia: He's the father of my child. I want what's best for her.",
        "Cassie: Well, there's an answer with a lot of leeway.",
        "Olivia: You know, what's dictated your decisions in the past fifteen years or so, Cassie? Were you a stripper for the hell of it? Did you go into the hotel business for fun? No, you did it for your kids, because you want to take care of them. I'm no different. Being Phillip's wife ensures that Emma will be protected forever.",
        "Cassie: Protected from what?",
        "Olivia: The Spauldings! If they knew that she was alive, they would do everything in their power to take her away from me! They would claim her as their own, do you understand? They would turn her into a little Lizzie. I would die before I let that happen! But it's really up to you at this point.",
        "Cassie: Me?",
        "Olivia: This... you know. You know the truth. You could destroy my life and hers with one phone call to Alan or Alexandra. It's all in your hands, Cassie, and that makes us partners in a whole new way.",
        "Blake: So do you want to head home, or stay and have another drink?",
        "Ross: Oh, I want to have another drink at home with you. The best of both worlds.",
        "Blake: Mmm, done. So where do you think Danny headed off to in such haste?",
        "Ross: Oh, he's trying to keep Tony's little fight out of the front pages tomorrow. But Danny's smart. He'll be able to keep the press from getting hold of this story. Come on. Good night, Charlie.",
        "Blake: Thanks, Charlie.",
        "Ross: Good night.",
        "Marah: What do you mean, \"maybe\" Carrie was trying to kill you? She didn't even lift a finger to help you.",
        "Michelle: That's just it. After Danny and Bill left the room, Carrie came back. And she said that she was the one who saved my life, because she shut off the gas valve.",
        "Marina: Yeah, but you don't know that for sure, because you were passed out.",
        "Michelle: Right.",
        "Marah: Well, is there any reason that she would want to hurt you?",
        "Michelle: Well, I told you that the night after we left her room, I went back.",
        "Marina: Well, what for?",
        "Michelle: I told Carrie that she needed to reveal herself to my dad and the others.",
        "Marah: What?",
        "Michelle: And I told her if she didn't reveal herself, that I would -- that I would blow her cover.",
        "Marina: Did she flip out?",
        "Carrie: Sorry to disappoint you, but no flipping out. Oh, Michelle, don't tell me that you're afraid of me now.",
        "Marah: Things just seem a little weird, Carrie.",
        "Carrie: Well, we can't have that, can we? Oh, look, Michelle. I've brought you a lovely present.",
        "Billy: Ed, you left me a message. An emergency? What's going on?",
        "Ed: Thanks for coming.",
        "Billy: Yeah. It's nice of you, too. Ed, the emergency!",
        "Ed: All right. The person who was trying to get to us through Michelle and the girls, I think they just upped the ante.",
        "Billy: Upped the ante how?",
        "Ed: There was a gas leak at Michelle's house tonight. She was there alone. She is lucky to have survived, Billy.",
        "Billy: So you think this witness, whoever it is, is trying to hurt Michelle?",
        "Ed: The notes that we got said that we would have to pay for what we did. I think we're starting to do that now.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah, we are. We are. You have no idea. It's going to get a lot worse, because Josh is going to the police.",
        "Ed: What?",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Ed: No!",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Ed: He was... mentioned something like that to me, but I just though it was the frustration talking. You have to stop him.",
        "Billy: Oh, come on, Ed. Don't you think I tried? Hey, the boy's mind is made up. And you have... your chances of changing his mind when it's made up are between zero and none.",
        "Ed: Then we have to try again, Billy.",
        "Billy: I don't see what the use is. Besides, for all we know, he may be coughing up our secret right now.",
        "(Doorbell rings)",
        "Josh: Busy?",
        "Eden: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Olivia: How far would you go to protect your baby?",
        "Michelle: No, we're just helping you keep your secret while we torment our fathers, and it ends today.",
        "Reva: We have all the time in the world.",
        "Josh: No. We have tonight. And I want to stay here with you tonight."
