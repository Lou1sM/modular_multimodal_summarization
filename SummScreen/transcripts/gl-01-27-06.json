        "Dinah and Mallet try to have a real date, but end up back in bed together. Frank finds out some information on Gus and lets Harley know but tells her to take her family on vacation like she planned. Frank calls Mallet to get to the crash site and when he jumps in the shower Dinah inadvertently tells her about the news at the crash site. Harley turns the jet around and meets up with Mallet at the crash site where they find his bloody coat and his wedding ring. Sandy spies on Jonathan and Tammy and when Jonathan calls her on it, he tells them he is moving out west. Later while Tammy is away, Sandy tells Jonathan that he is closing on the house \"just in case\". He also rubs in that it was his doing that got Tammy back into school and lets Jonathan know that he has a job in the office. Reva questions Jeffrey if he was ever playing Richard while with her and he tells her that his time was later than when Reva was there. He jokingly tells her that she can't blame Jonathan on him. He remembers a time though that he had sex with Cassie while she was intoxicated. Josh gets a hold of a high school friend whose agency is the one that Jeffrey worked for. He tells Cassie that the information she is wanting about Jeffrey is classified, but she tells him that by being a member of the royal family she can insist on the information and demands it of him."

        "Dinah: What do we drink to next?",
        "Mallet: Let's drink to your jeans.",
        "Dinah: We already drank to that.",
        "Mallet: All right, well let's drink to you with no jeans.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry, I know. I promised.",
        "Dinah: Come on. A normal night out. Date. Dinner, movie.",
        "Mallet: Can I let you in on a secret? Normal is so overrated.",
        "Dinah: Well you know what? Normal is normal to me. That's not abnormal, which is a good thing.",
        "Mallet: That's kind of deep.",
        "Dinah: Look, just...",
        "Mallet: I know what you mean. I know you mean. You're just way past normal. And I think the stuff you've been doing lately with Harley and helping her out, just kind of makes me proud. Does that sound weird?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Yeah, kind of.",
        "Mallet: How about let's get out of here?",
        "Dinah: Okay, okay, yeah, that's good. We had had our dinner, and now we're on to the movie, but...",
        "Mallet: Cuddle, cuddle. Fuzzy, fuzzy.",
        "Dinah: No sex. No sex, come on, you promised. We're going to have a normal date, a normal night out. We have to behave, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: I hate those two little words \"behave.\"",

        "Zach: Mommy, is Gus going to meet us in Hawaii?",
        "Harley: Well, whether he does or he doesn't, he would still want us to have a great time with Grandpa, Uncle Frank and Marina and Coop.",
        "Zach: Mommy, are you okay?",
        "Harley: I'm fine. I'm fine. I just remembered I left all your dvds on the tarmac. I'll be right back.",

        "Marina: What's this all about?",
        "Frank: I've got voicemail from the F.B.I. agent handling Gus' disappearance. It looks like they found something at the lake.",

        "Jeffrey: You ran out kind of early this morning, and I miss you. Well I do miss you, so call me.",
        "Reva: Hey, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Save your breath. I was wrong, I know I was wrong. I impersonated Richard, it was a short-term assignment, but I should have turned them down flat. Does that about cover it?",
        "Reva: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I called a friend of mine, owes me a favor, happens to work for the government. He will be here in a while.",

        "Cassie: Do you think he might be able to answer questions about Jeffrey.",
        "Josh: I think he might be able to find out some information about jeffey. The question is do you want to hear it?",

        "Frank: Oh, just police business.",
        "Harley: Gus business?",
        "Frank: You know what? Is anybody else hungry? I'm starving, what about you?",
        "Harley: Do I take that as a no?",
        "Frank: Sis, I want you to sit down and try to relax and enjoy the trip, okay? We all could use the R & R.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, let him go. Let him go.",
        "Sandy: It's okay. Jonathan probably thought I was spying on you two.",
        "Tammy: Well what were you doing, Sandy?",
        "Sandy: I saw you coming, and I tried to duck so you wouldn't see me.",
        "Jonathan: How nice of you.",
        "Tammy: Look, Sandy, it's a small town. We're probably going to be running into each other sometimes.",
        "Sandy: Or maybe not. I may be moving out of town.",
        "Jonathan: You need some help?",
        "Sandy: No. Actually, I have a date, so I have to go.",
        "Tammy: A date? Well, have fun. See you.",

        "Jonathan: Yeah, I'll be right behind you.",
        "Sandy: Hey Jon Boy, guess what?",
        "Jonathan: Let me guess. You're not actually moving. A big shocker.",
        "Sandy: I finally decided to close on that house, the one that Tammy really liked. Yeah, the price went way down after your destruction, so thanks for that. But it's all mine, just in case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You impersonated Richard?",
        "Jeffrey: You mean Cassie didn't tell you? Or Tammy, or Jonathan, or Josh?",
        "Reva: I've been a little out of the loop these days.",
        "Jeffrey: Surprise.",
        "Reva: You wore the outfit?",
        "Jeffrey: ( Laughs ) Yeah. Yeah, I wore the outfit, right down to the sash. That was part of the job, protecting him, keeping Richard safe.",
        "Reva: Keeping up public appearances?",
        "Jeffrey: Public appearances, speeches, openings, wherever he had a chance of catching a bullet.",
        "Reva: Wow, some job. You really expected to keep this secret forever.",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't know that Cassie and I would end up together. And now we are together, and now she knows, Reva. She's a little freaked out to say the least.",
        "Reva: Should she be?",
        "Jeffrey: No. She's going to work this out. She's pulling away from me right now.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I guess she just needs some time.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not used to this, you know. She normally comes to me whenever she has a problem. She always comes to me.",
        "Reva: And now you're the problem.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. What? Say it.",
        "Reva: I just have to ask: When you were playing Richard, did you ever play him with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: You know what, a man of less class at this moment would ask you if you ever enjoyed the outdoors.",
        "Dinah: Enjoyed?",
        "Mallet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dinah: Oh, enjoyed, I see.",
        "Mallet: Just curious.",
        "Dinah: A little cold out there, isn't it? Is this where you say, don't worry about it, baby, we'll heat up? Huh?",
        "Mallet: You are such a pervert. I was talking about building a snowman.",
        "Dinah: Okay, good, I believe that might be nice. Get your mind out of the gutter, focus on something like popcorn. Come on, come on. This is you know, a night out, no sex. Like two normal people.",
        "Mallet: Normal people don't have sex?",
        "Dinah: I'm trying here, come on.",
        "Mallet: Fine. We'll go to the movie. I get the aisle; I have the long legs.",
        "Dinah: I get the aisle. I don't like people brushing up against me.",
        "Mallet: You don't get to decide, I'm bigger.",
        "Dinah: And dumber, that's why I'm making all of the decisions.",
        "Mallet: Are we still seeing a movie? ( Laughter )",
        "Dinah: Yeah, we are. Hart pumping, seduction movie, nice and hot.",
        "Mallet: Loud explosions and special effects...",
        "Dinah: No, no! Come on. You promised...",
        "Mallet: Yes, Mallet. Yes, Mallet.",
        "Dinah: ...A sexy hot, nice hot movie. No, Mallet. No, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: Hot-- yeah, you're right, hot. You're right. You're right, I can't do this.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about? Where you going?",
        "Mallet: I made you a promise. And I want to show you I can live up to my promises.",
        "Dinah: Promises are made to be broken.",
        "Mallet: Oh, God, you. Yes-- no, I can't. No, I can't do this.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: You are so hot. A promise is a promise. Yeah.",

        "Marina: Ey!",
        "Coop: Hey, you guys. Is everybody ready? Come here. Come here.",
        "Marina: Let's go!",
        "Coop: Oh, my gosh, you are getting huge.",
        "Marina: I don't know about you guys, but I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh, warm weather, big old palm trees, I don't know about you, but it sounds about perfect to me.",
        "Harley: Just about perfect.",
        "Zach: All I hear is weird people talking.",
        "Marina: Oh, that's just my soap opera podcast.",
        "Coop: Weird people-- what have you been listening to? Give me that. Zach, I think you'll like this a little better. And Harley, I think you'll like this, too, this band is amazing. Hey.",
        "Harley: I'm sorry, what?",
        "Coop: I'm just saying I'm glad we're all finally together, you know, hanging out.",
        "Harley: Me, too.",
        "Coop: In fact, I guess we never really get a chance to-- yeah, never get a chance to hang out anymore. I want your undivided attention while we're on this flight, all right? Because I know once we get to Hawaii, it will be you and the kids and--",
        "Harley: And Gus. It's going to be all about me and the kids and Gus.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Unbelievable. One minute he's hot, one minute he's cold. What do I have to do to get a normal date around here? ( Knock on the door ) What are you doing? Whoa. What are you doing? I'm going to call security. What's your deal?",
        "Mallet: I wouldn't do that. You're the one kind of out here lurking.",
        "Dinah: Lurking?",
        "Mallet: Close your eyes, don't peek.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, I need my shoes!",
        "Mallet: No, you don't! Just kind of stand out there and act normal.",
        "Dinah: What are you doing?",
        "Mallet: Nothing.",
        "Dinah: I feel like I'm in high school.",
        "Mallet: That's good, because it means I'm on the right track. I'm almost ready.",
        "Dinah: You know what, I'm taking off in ten seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven--",
        "Mallet: Oh! Hi, this is a surprise. I was just thinking about you. Running into you like this, God, you saved me a phone call.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: Would you be interested in maybe going to a movie with me sometime, like -- like right now?",
        "Dinah: Are you asking me out?",
        "Mallet: Uh-oh, she pauses, that is not a good sign.",
        "Dinah: Yes, I could go to the movies with you if I could get my shoes.",
        "Mallet: You don't need your shoes. No shoes required. Step right in, the movie is about to begin.",
        "Dinah: You are a freak, you know that?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's what the guy at the video store thought when I rented every chick flick that he had.",
        "Dinah: I bet he did. I bet he thought you were crazy. The way \"oh this is our first date\". This is fun.",
        "Mallet: ( Whispers ) Are you liking the movie?",
        "Dinah: I'm loving the movie. I've seen this ten times; I can tell you every scene.",
        "Mallet: Is that a mermaid?",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh. Of course it's a mermaid. ( Screams ) You can't kiss me.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: It's the first date.",
        "Mallet: You're right, you're right. I'm sorry. When do they kiss?",
        "Dinah: Half way through.",
        "Mallet: Oh, God! I'll never make it that far!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: ( Laughs ) Reva? Have I ever played Richard with you? Don't you think you'd be able to tell the difference?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I didn't even know who I was back then.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I'm not a prince, okay? And besides, I was only there for the last part of their stay in San Cristobel, so you can't blame Jonathan on me.",
        "Reva: Oh, dang, I could use a hand with the kid. So you and Cassie... are you going to be okay?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Loving Richard meant everything to me, Josh. I think back on that time, and I think, that's my life, that's the heart of me. And to think that he was keeping something like this from me.",
        "Josh: You know, Cassie, maybe it was just a security issue for him. He was the head of a country, for goodness sake.",
        "Cassie: How am I ever going to know when I was with him or when I was with Jeffrey pretending to be him. It changes my marriage. It changes the way I see everything.",
        "Josh: Not if you don't let it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: You're just going to have to give her sometime.",
        "Jeffrey: I know. I just hope when she works it all out, she remembers what we have together now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Don't you think he would have studied us, Josh, don't you think he's figured out just the right thing to do and say in every situation. What if he's not who I thought he was?",
        "Josh: Richard or Jeffrey?",
        "Cassie: My point exactly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I don't want to give you a sob story or anything, but I kind of had a hard time of it growing up, and when you grow up like that, sometimes you feel...",
        "Reva: Unworthy, unimportant?",
        "Jeffrey: You, too.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I was a housekeeper's daughter, and I went from that to princess of the palace. It is pretty powerful.",
        "Jeffrey: I guess I got a taste of it, just a glimpse of what it would be like. And it wasn't the power, or the suit, or the horse. No, it was the respect. And the way he lived his life, and what he had in it.",
        "Reva: His life, you mean Cassie?",
        "Jeffrey: Richard Winslow had everything any man could ever want, and more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Oh, that was -- oh, boy, that was... that was some movie.",
        "Dinah: That was incredible.",
        "Mallet: Amazing.",
        "Dinah: Oh, my God.",
        "Mallet: You are... you are --",
        "Dinah: A stretch.",
        "Mallet: I've got a question now?",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: How did the movie... ( laughter )",
        "Dinah: Why, what do you care?",
        "Mallet: I care, don't you care? You know what we should do?",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Mallet: We should watch it again. We should watch it again to make sure we didn't miss anything. See if we can catch it this time.",
        "Dinah: Like the beginning?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, and the middle.",
        "Dinah: And the end? ( Laughter ) Okay. Like a long double... ( cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: Oh! I hate it when somebody's phone rings during the best part of my favorite scene.",
        "Dinah: You have to answer it.",
        "Mallet: Mallet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Mallet, the feds found something. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to go down to the crash site and I want you to check it out. When you get down there, if you find out anything, just call me. Hey, guys. I just told Mallet to go down and check out the crash site.",
        "Buzz: So you think --",
        "Frank: Pop, it doesn't look good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky Paul Golden, inside \"The Light\". I have ADD, I'm a perfectionist, and maybe too much where it really drives everybody crazy. Beth Ellers, she is the best sparring partner I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. See Gus February 1st, inside \"The Light\".",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Hey, Harley. Harley?",
        "Harley: What? I'm sorry, what?",
        "Marina: Are you okay?",
        "Harley: Yes, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I should probably get to that crash site. I'm sorry, I've got to go.",
        "Dinah: That's okay. I'll call the garage and tell them to have the car ready.",
        "Mallet: Great, I'll jump in the shower.",
        "Dinah: About ten minutes.",
        "Mallet: You know what, make it five.",
        "Dinah: Hello -- why don't I have a dial tone. Hello. Hello.",
        "Harley: Dinah, it is me.",
        "Dinah: Harley.",
        "Harley: Is Mallet there?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, she just jumped into the shower. He is on his way to the site. Babe, I'm so sorry. I don't know. I think maybe everything is okay, and maybe it is not such bad news? Hello... hello...",
        "Mallet: So everything is set with the garage and car and everything.",
        "Dinah: I think I blew it.",
        "Mallet: What are you talking about?",
        "Dinah: Harley called looking for you, and I told her you were on your way to the accident site. And I don't think she has heard the news yet.",
        "Mallet: Oh, did she say anything?",
        "Dinah: No. I don't know if she disconnected to me or hung up.",
        "Mallet: She didn't say anything?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Mallet: That's all right.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, I think I really screwed up. I've been working so hard to keep her up and encouraged, but I didn't know...",
        "Mallet: It's okay. Maybe she didn't hear you. And if she did, and if it is bad news, then she's going to have to hear about it sooner or later.",
        "Dinah: He is your partner, too.",
        "Mallet: I know. There's nothing I can do about Gus right now. I'm worried about Harley. If it is bad news, she's got her family around her. She's going to be in a lot of pain. There is going to be some grieving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Cassie is probably going half crazy trying to figure out when you were Richard, and when you were Jeffrey. You've got to fix that.",
        "Jeffrey: I would love to fix that. I want to go over every second of the time I was down there. But she needs to talk this out with someone else. Maybe she needs her sister.",
        "Reva: Well, my phone ain't ringing off the hook. We should be working through this with a gallon of ice cream. But she won't let it drop because of this whole thing with Tammy and Jonathan.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't even know where she is. She needs someone. She needs to talk to someone right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Scott, good to see you. It has been a long time. Scott Malone, say hello to Cassie Winslow. Scott's an old friend of mine from back in high school, if you can believe that.",
        "Scott: I guess Josh told you I knew your husband, Richard, a little. A fine man.",
        "Cassie: Thank you, he was. I guess Josh told you what it is we're looking for.",
        "Scott: Some. Why don't you fill me in.",
        "Josh: We're looking for as much information about this guy who used to work in San Cristobel and your company.",
        "Scott: Former agent?",
        "Josh: Yeah, Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Cassie: We know he stood in for Richard.",
        "Josh: And we want to know how many times he did that and for how long --",
        "Cassie: And what assignments he did--",
        "Scott: I'm sorry. What you're asking is classified.",
        "Cassie: I'm considered part of the royal family, and I want access to all of the agency's files on the matter of Jeffrey O'Neill in San Cristobel.",
        "Scott: I'm telling you...",
        "Cassie: I'm telling you, and I'll tell your superiors, either I get what I want, or I go to the media, and I'll make such a fuss here and in Europe, that I'll make all the other scandals look like a walk on the beach.",
        "Josh: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Do I make myself clear?",
        "Scott: Yes. I'll be in touch, soon.",
        "Josh: Wow, your highness, that was impressive.",
        "Cassie: You do what you've got to do. I just hope it shakes out the answers we're looking for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Hey there.",
        "Tammy: Where's Mom?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know.",
        "Tammy: I thought you might say that. So what happened after we got back from San Cristobel?",
        "Reva: You went to San Cristobel.",
        "Tammy: Mom had questions-- lots of them. I really hope you work things out.",
        "Jeffrey: Thanks, but about your dad...",
        "Tammy: Hey, I'm not going to pile it on right now. You helped me out with the trial.",
        "Reva: So, if you and your mom went to San Cristobel together, does that mean that the two you of are--",
        "Tammy: Uh-uh. Mom will never accept Jonathan. She'll always hold his past against him.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't know that.",
        "Tammy: Well, I'm getting the idea.",
        "Jeffrey: Listen, I'm going to let you guys talk.",
        "Reva: Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm going to be fine. I'm going to work it all out, really, I am. Scotch, make it a double.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: What's the matter, you didn't have enough money to pay for your date?",
        "Sandy: Sorry, I'm done with you for today.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not done with you. Me and you are going to stick together until we get a few things straightened out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Cassie, how much does finding out how many times Jeffrey actually played Richard, how much does that really mean to you?",
        "Cassie: It means everything, Josh. I have to know when I was actually dealing with my husband and when it wasn't him.",
        "Josh: That's the thing, even when it wasn't him, it was Jeffrey, who now you love.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know, and I keep telling myself that. But my memories, Josh, they're all up for grabs now. Every minute with Richard, I think was it him? Wasn't it him?",
        "Josh: All of your memories?",
        "Cassie: Well, not all of them, but a few keep coming back, and I think -- I don't know.",
        "Josh: Moments?",
        "Cassie: I just feel if I could nail down these few moments and nail down the truth from them, then I could take it from there. I would know what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Good night, Richard. I'll punch the clock, O'Neill, and get back to a normal life, whatever the heck that is. And just pray to God that la princess was too busy waving to know she is staring at her. Oh, that woman. She's... she's something all right. I never thought a princess would be... well, like that. Like her. I don't know what I thought. She's... another man's wife. She's another man's wife! Don't forget that. And when she's looking at you, she's not looking at you. Don't forget that, either. She is looking at him. Oh, my God, get a hold of yourself. I can just go back to the hotel. Make myself a hot coffee and a cold shower.",
        "Cassie: Richard, there you are. I just have one or two little drops left.",
        "Jeffrey: I think you've had too much to drink, darling, it is time to turn in.",
        "Cassie: Now you're talking. You seemed so distant at the party tonight. Uneasy lies the crown that wears the head. ( Laughter ) Reverse that.",
        "Jeffrey: Silly me, you know what, I forgot something at the party.",
        "Cassie: No, no, no, no, hold on, you are not going anywhere.",
        "Jeffrey: Another one, please, I need another one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Okay, what's going on? You better start talking, you know.",
        "Frank: Harley, look...",
        "Harley: I talked to Dinah.",
        "Frank: Dinah?",
        "Harley: I was looking for Mallet. She said she was so sorry about the news. What?",
        "Frank: Honey, sit down.",
        "Harley: I want to be calm, I need to be calm for the children. I want to know, now, Frank.",
        "Frank: They found Gus' coat stuck in the ice at the lake. It had blood on it, and we're running tests right now.",
        "Harley: So that's it. You found his coat, and they're running tests.",
        "Frank: It is Gus' blood, sis, and he went into the lake. There is no way he could have made it.",
        "Buzz: Mallet is on his way there now. All we can do is wait for his call.",
        "Harley: Oh, really, you think that is all we can do?",
        "Frank: What are you doing?",
        "Harley: This is Ms. Cooper, we need to turn the plane around. Take us back home, now. you've got something to say, say it so I can move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You better be moving on. Moving your little psychotic self out of this town.",
        "Sandy: Thanks for the tip.",
        "Jonathan: You're welcome. If you think you're hanging around here because you think you can get back with Tammy, forget it.",
        "Sandy: You really are paranoid, aren't you?",
        "Jonathan: No. I know you. Do you think I don't remember what it felt like falling off that cliff. How much did you help me then? So looking at you and thinking the worst, that is survival.",
        "Sandy: Or... it's fear. That what you have with Tammy, maybe your connection isn't quite as strong as you think it is. Or maybe guilt, knowing you can't give her the life she deserves.",
        "Jonathan: I don't hear her complaining.",
        "Sandy: Give her another week.",
        "Jonathan: Hopefully you'll be gone by then.",
        "Sandy: Change of plans. I want to stick around when she finds out I got her accepted into school again. Yeah. Think she'll be grateful? Oh, oh, oh, and by the way, good old Dean Boudreaux gave me a job on campus. Maybe I'll even take some classes. I can't leave now. My life is looking up. Things are going my way, and before I know it, Tammy and I will be back together again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I don't know who I'm more worried about, my mom or Jonathan.",
        "Reva: Why?",
        "Tammy: Because of Sandy. Every time they see each other, there is a scene. Jonathan won't back off.",
        "Reva: Well, that doesn't surprise me. That's who he is. You don't have a problem with that, do you?",
        "Tammy: No. I love him just as he is. And for who he is.",
        "Reva: So do I. ( Laughing ) Just like you always imagined it would be, huh?",
        "Tammy: Oh, not even close. I just hope that one day my mom can figure it out for herself.",
        "Reva: Figure out what, exactly?",
        "Tammy: That everybody makes mistakes. When two people love each other, the past doesn't matter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scott: Mrs. Winslow, I did run the request, but I was shut out. The file you're asking about is unavailable to me. My level of cleaners, there is just no access.",
        "Josh: Pretty much what you thought?",
        "Cassie: You know, I wouldn't have gone to the press.",
        "Scott: If I were you, I'd use all the leverage you can.",
        "Cassie: I was hoping there would be something in this file.",
        "Josh: This file, the fact that it is so confidential, does it mean there is sensitive material there?",
        "Scott: I can't confirm or deny that. But if you're asking me off the record, for just my opinion.",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Scott: I wouldn't be a bit surprised.",
        "Josh: Well, thank you for your time.",
        "Scott: I wish I could tell you more. Good luck.",
        "Josh: Thank you. Take care of yourself. Sorry.",
        "Cassie: Well, you made the call. That's a lot.",
        "Josh: I just can't help but think there is something more to this. It goes beyond a basic government bureaucracy kind of thing.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. It sounds more like a cover-up to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You are not going anywhere.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, you don't know... you don't know how much I want this.",
        "Cassie: Oh, I have some idea.",
        "Jeffrey: Tonight was... it was incredible. Walking through that party with you on my arm...",
        "Cassie: It was like a dream, wasn't it?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, it was like a dream. But, you know what, I've had too much to drink.",
        "Cassie: Why let the dream end?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Sh-sh-sh, I know you're tense. I know you have a lot going on. But right here, right now, it's just you and me. Nothing else matters. ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: Why the hell did I do it? Why couldn't I keep my damn hands off the man's wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Hey, Harley.",
        "Harley: What do you have? What do you have, Mallet? Gus' coat?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. They found it in the water.",
        "Harley: Well, this is... this is good because now we know what happened. He took the coat off so that he could swim to shore, right?",
        "Mallet: There was ice on the lake at the time of the crash, and the ice wasn't that thick, and apparently Gus was hurt.",
        "Harley: Stop saying was.",
        "Mallet: We found this in his coat pocket.",
        "Harley: He would never take off his wedding ring.",
        "Mallet: That's probably true. And Gus being a good detective, and he is a good detective, if he would have tried to make it across the lake and if the ice did crack, he would know that we would need to I.D. some stuff.",
        "Harley: ( Sobbing ) No, no, no!",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jonathon: He wants Tammy back, he would do anything to get her back, including use her friends.",
        "Josh: I'm going to ask them to hack into a government program that will give us the information about Jeffrey.",
        "Dinah: It's Gus, they found some of his things frozen in the lake and they think he is dead."
