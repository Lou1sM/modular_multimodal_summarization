Don't stop sending all thet new business our way. It makes me feel so good, i can't even tell you.", "Edmund: That good, huh?", "Cassie: Oh, god, the smell of it makes me want to throw up. I must be coming down with something. No, really, you don't want to kiss me.", "Edmund: No, really I do.", "Cassie: Edmund, the only thing I really want is a long hot shower.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: All right, I can do that, too.", "Tammy: Hello.", "Edmund: Well, hello to you. Laundry day.", "Tammy: Yeah, is that okay?", "Edmund: Okay? Your mom will be thrilled.", "Tammy: Where is mom?", "Edmund: Upstairs taking a shower. Looking for something?", "Tammy: Could you donate those flowers to a funeral home or something?", "Edmund: What flowers?", "Tammy: The ones that you sent mom with the mushy note. She tried to hide it from me, but I saw it. You guys are so weird. Cute, but weird. What?", "Edmund: I was just trying to remember what the mushy note said.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jonathan: Hey, hey, over here.", "Dinah: Hello there, sexy. Who exactly are we hiding from?", "Jonathan: Well, I thought it would be a good idea to keep our relationship a secret for now.", "Danny: Ooh, relationship. That's an awfully big world for a young guy like yourself. Although I didn't have that in mind, you know, when we...", "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, don't worry bit, I'm not looking to go steady. So I know what you did. The flowers to cassie.

As soon as jonathan is recovered, we will get him his own apartment, a place he can call his own.", "Reva: Joshua.", "Josh: Now, in return for getting him out of this house, i promise you, I promise that i will try to accept him.", "Reva: He just got here.", "Josh: I know. But this will be good for him, and it will give us a better chance at getting along.", "Reva: Okay. But I want to be the one to talk to him about it. As soon as I feel like he's better, then I'll ask him to move out.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: No really, tammy, perhaps the flower shop didn't hear me correctly. What exactly did the note say?", "Tammy: I'm not going to recite it for you.", "Edmund: Oh, come on, tammy. All right, that's okay. I've got a meeting to get to anyway. Your mother's been sick.

Maybe next time you can stay longer than for just laundry.", "Tammy: No pressure, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jonathan: You want me out?", "Reva: We just want you to have a place of your own.", "Jonathan: Yeah, don't worry, I got it. Must be kind of hard to get it on with little baby sleeping next-door, isn't it?", "Reva: We just think that everyone will be happier if we all have a little more privacy. But I don't know why we're talking about this now because you're not going anywhere until that leg is healed.", "Jonathan: Well, you want to help me speed that along? Come on, you coached golden boy shayne back on his feet. Why not me?", "Josh: I'll think about it. See you later.", "Reva: He's trying, jonathan. Don't push him.", "Jonathan: Yeah.

Hi. And you brought your laundry.", "Tammy: Yeah, is it okay?", "Cassie: It's perfect.", "Tammy: Okay, so sit down, all right.

I got to go to orientation.", "Cassie: College girl. So what are you going to major in?", "Tammy: Keeping a low profile. Lizzie knows about jb. What has she told everybody? What if...", "Cassie: Listen to me, okay? College isn't like high school. And I'm not really worried about the other people, I'm worried about you. How are you feeling?", "Tammy: I don't know. I keep trying to pretend that what jb... what jonathan did is in the past, that it's all okay. But sometimes I feel like it's never going to be in the past.", "Cassie: Listen to me. Don't even say his name. He doesn't exist. Do you hear me? He does not exist.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Edmund, come on, I was just going to say good-bye.", "Bill: What you doing?", "Dinah: I was on the elevator with edmund, he was there, and... look, we weren't going to some, like, elicit rendezvous, okay. Not yet.", "Bill: That's all well and good, but you know, he's taken. So maybe you should just walk away before you get hurt again.", "Dinah: Bill...", "Bill: Yes.", "Dinah: I love him.", "Bill: You know what you need to do? You need to go find a guy who is going to love you just as much as you love him. That's what you got to do.", "Dinah: And I appreciate that. But I think that edmund cares for me, he just doesn't want to face it.", "Bill: Oh, man.", "Dinah: That marriage is never going to last.", "Bill: Well, maybe it will if you stay away from it.", "Dinah: I could have ruined that wedding, but I didn'T. That has to mean something. It has to.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Hello, mr. O'neil.", "Jeffrey: Edmund.", "Edmund: May I buy you a drink?", "Jeffrey: Why?", "Edmund: Well, think of it as A... excuse me please. Think of it as a thank you for officiating at the wedding and you've been a good friend to cassie, and therefore to me, so...", "Jeffrey: Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Just stop right now.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: So what? What did I miss? Did I miss something?", "Bill: Just trying to convince my not so stable sister to find herself a nice guy and have a little fun; an available one.", "Olivia: That's good advice. Maybe I should take it.", "Josh: Well, well, look who's here.", "Billy: How you doing boy?", "Bill: Yeah well...", "Olivia: Hi.", "Josh: Hi, olivia. Hope we're not interrupting anything.", "Bill: Oh, no, no more than usual.", "Billy: You got a few minute for your old man?", "Bill: Why, what's up?", "Josh: Step outside, please, bill.", "Bill: Whose toes did I step on now?", "Billy: It's more like we're the ones need to do some toe stepping.", "Josh: We want you back at lewis, bill.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Mom, what is going on with you?", "Cassie: Oh, it's not you, tammy. It'S...", "Tammy: Jb.", "Cassie: It's that kid.", "Tammy: I know you hate to say his name.", "Cassie: I hate everything about him. I hate what he did to you, i hate what he did to... to reva. That kid doesn't mow the difference between right and wrong, and we have to stay away from him and we have to pretend like he went away. Do you hear me?", "Tammy: I should have listened to you. You tried to warn me about him, and I just... it just made me want him even more. God, I'm such a loser.", "Cassie: No, you're not a loser. Tammy, you're not a loser, okay? What you did... what happened to you is completely understandable. You know, sometimes you have the best intentions and it just blows up anyway. I really wish I could have done something to protect you or reva. God I didn't mean for this to happen. Oh, tammy, it's the last thing that I wanted.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Okay. This should be all the paperwork you need for the job.", "Sandy: All right.", "Reva: You know what? That's probably joe from the station. I have to take that.", "Sandy: Oh, joe.", "Reva: Where's the phone? What did you do with the phone?", "Sandy: Tell joe I said hi.", "Reva: I will honey, thanks.", "Sandy: Thank you.", "Jonathan: Hey, you tell joe i said hi, too, mamma.", "Sandy: Two bedroom, two bath. They're throwing you out already? ( Laughs ) wow, I was here a lot longer.", "Jonathan: Why don't you go down to the pound and wag your tail, and maybe somebody will adopt you.", "Sandy: I don't need to an don't need to be adopted to belong. You're the outsider. You just don't fit in, and looks like reva is finally onto the real you.", "Jonathan: You want to know about the real me? Ask tammy, she can give you all the intimate details.", "Sandy: No thanks. Believe it or not, you're not all that interesting.", "Reva: What's wrong?", "Jonathan: I'm tired of sitting around this house. I'm freaking out. I want to get out of here and do something.", "Reva: Okay, well, I'll be happy to drop you off anywhere you want to go.", "Jonathan: Why don't you come with me?", "Reva: Well, sure. Where are we going?", "Jonathan: Somewhere where you can get to learn the real me. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Don't dredge up the past. Be thankful. You married her. You're married to cassie, and she needs you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Mr. O'neil, don't tell me what my wife needs.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Don't worry, don't worry, okay?

Now, sling shot is doing fantastic, thank you very much, okay? This is about olivia, isn't it? Go ahead, just say it. Olivia is bad for you, bill.", "Josh: I don't have to say it, bill. You just did.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Hey, dinah, check out the guy at the bar, the one with the bartender.", "Dinah: What about him?", "Olivia: Well, I just know him from my gym. He's not bad, huh?", "Dinah: I guess.", "Olivia: I think he's kind of cute in that nerdy, sexy kind of way.", "Dinah: Okay.

So what do you do, dinah?", "Dinah: Well, I've been on the run for the last year. I shot my fiancee. And then I played a princess undercover, and then I slept my way through europe, which landed me in prison.", "Corey: Oh, this is great. She's really funny.", "Olivia: Hysterical.

Hey, wow.", "Jonathan: Yeah, I spent a lot of time in here.", "Reva: I never knew you were so into music.", "Jonathan: It gets me out of my own head, you know? Especially some of the under ground stuff they carry in here.", "Reva: Underground?", "Jonathan: Underground. You want to hear some of it?", "Reva: Oh, well, yeah, I'd love to, but it looks like they're closed.", "Jonathan: No problem. You wait right here.", "Reva: Where are you going?", "Jonathan: Well, the owner is a buddy of mine, and he gave me a key to the door in the alley. So I'll be right back. You ready to rock and roll?", "Reva: So strange to be in a store with no customers.", "Jonathan: Well, maybe this will help you take the edge off.", "Reva: Oh, no, I really can'T. Well, what the heck, okay. Wow. Hey, you play?", "Jonathan: No, I always wanted to, but the old man said lessons were a waste of money.", "Reva: Oh. I used to do a little singing back in the day. What?", "Jonathan: I was just thinking about how different it might have been if... never mind.", "Reva: If you had been raised by someone more like you? ( Laughter ) well, you kind of play. ( Laughter ) play that funky music.", "Jonathan: White boy. ( Laughs ) well, I taught myself a few cords.", "Reva: Yeah, well, when I was your age I was really into the stones.", "Jonathan: Oh, man, that was my favorite band, too.", "Reva: Really?", "Jonathan: Yeah.", "Reporter: I was so in love with mick jagger.", "Jonathan: Yeah, no, he's fantastic, but keith was my guy, you know? I'm kind of into the self destructive thing.", "Reva: Uh-huh. No kidding?", "Jonathan: Yeah. What do you think I get it from?", "Reva: Really. I like that song, too.", "Jonathan: You're batting a thousand today. ( Laughter )", "Reva: That is a great song.", "Jonathan: That is a great song.

Bye.", "Sandy: Oh, no. Tell me you didn't hear all that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tammy: Hear all what?", "Sandy: The... oh, never mind.", "Tammy: I just have one question for you.", "Sandy: Mm-hmm.", "Tammy: Do you have a girlfriend? And if you do, is it anyone i know?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: You know, I appreciate the concern, I really do. But when I comes to olivia, i can take care of myself.", "Billy: The family...", "Bill: No, dad, the family does not need me. You two are quite capable of running lewis construction on your own. So I regretfully decline the offer, but again, thanks anyway. But if there's anything else i can do, let me know.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: Now I find what you do very interesting. Yeah, my girlfriend has been talking to me about how she's worried about never being able to carry to term. The doctors have said she's going to be fine.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Corey: Oh. Vibrating. It's the hospital again. I'm so sorry. Back in a second.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: So who's your friend?", "Dinah: What are you implying?", "Olivia: Well, it's just that you were really bored with him until he said he was an ob.", "Dinah: I find what he does very interesting.", "Olivia: Huh. Or maybe you're just hoping that he could give you some information that might help you.", "Dinah: Come on. I'm not even married yet, olivia.", "Olivia: Cassie told me you thought you were pregnant a few weeks ago.", "Dinah: Yes. I have been trying to get pregnant, but I do believe you also were looking for a spaulding heir, and sometimes have you to work out of the box to get in the box to get cozy.", "Olivia: Yeah, but I can tell you that when it involves a child, it's just not that simple.", "Dinah: It was for you?", "Olivia: Are you kidding me? I have been fighting, fighting to keep emma.", "Dinah: Yes, but you have her and you're not alone.", "Olivia: Yeah, but not without the spaulding shadow looming over us. And the fear of being separated. I'm telling you, it's no way to live, dinah.", "Dinah: Now, I appreciate it, olivia, but I will be just fine. I won't be alone for long.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeff: You know, edmund, I was sitting here trying to mind my own business and then you came over here and started this conversation. So I don't know what your problem is, but whatever it is, it's your problem, okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Save your money, mr. O'neil. Stop sending cassie flowers. That's my job.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: What? You know, whatever is going on between you and cassie, keep me out of it, okay? Thanks.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: All right. Man, rj, you are not an easy pregnancy. Okay, well, I've had a headache for three days. That's fine, that's caffeine withdrawal. But coffee makes me sick and food... oh. Come on.", "Jonathan: Did you tell uncle edmund the baby is ours yet?", "Cassie: No. No. No. No, please, please. Please, god, please, don't let me be pregnant by that monster. Please, I will do anything. I will give up anything if you just let edmund be the father of this baby, please. That's what I'm going to believe. No matter what that's what I'm going to believe, unless you give me a sign. ( Phone ringing ) Winslow residence. We can get to the phone right now, so leave a message and we'll call you back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nurse: Hi, mrs. Winslow, it's jamie from dr. Sheen's office, calling to schedule an appointment for your next pregnancy test.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: So who's the lucky guy? Come on, you must have picked someone to be the daddy of your baby. Who is he?", "Bill: Who's who?", "Olivia: Nothing. Never mind.", "Dinah: No, it's okay. Olivia and I were just talking about the fact that a baby would complete me, and of course who the possible fathers could be.", "Bill: Ha-ha, you're kidding me, right?", "Dinah: No. I love you..V have a good afternoon.", "Bill: Dinah...", "Dinah: Listen, give a kiss to emma for me, okay? Good bye.", "Dinah: Please tell me you weren't enc, stable sister to have a baby.", "Olivia: I was just introducing her to a guy I knew from the gym while you were out there with josh and billy. So what was that about anyway?", "Bill: Nothing.", "Olivia: Nothing?", "Bill: Nothing.", "Olivia: Fine. Don't tell me. I mean, we don't have to share everything, right? Keeps life interesting.", "Bill: Very interesting. In fact, why don't me make it a little more interesting.", "Olivia: What did you have in mind?", "Bill: This little slow dance we got going on with alan? I think it's time we speed things up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: You know, if you took this off, we could probably finish that conversation.", "Corey: God, I'd love to. But I have to get to the hospital.", "Dinah: You know, maybe sometime I can come by and visit? I really am interested in what you do.", "Corey: Really?", "Dinah: You know, a girl's got to have a hobby. Come on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sandy: Like I said before, there is a girl I like, and I'm okay with leaving it at that for now without any labels.", "Tammy: I think that will probably work with this girl that you like.", "Sandy: Yeah?", "Tammy: Just let me know how it goes, huh.", "Sandy: I will.", "Tammy: So do you usually lift weights or what?", "Sandy: Yeah, and I ride the bike and I slam the bag around. And sometimes I do katas.", "Tammy: That's karate, right?", "Sandy: Yeah, you want to learn some moves? Never hurts to learn how to defend yourself.", "Tammy: Okay. Yeah, teach me how the kick the stuffing out of... somebody.", "Sandy: All right. Okay, then, we'll start with a front kick. Which is mae geri in japanese.", "Tammy: Are you trying to impress me?", "Sandy: Is it's working?", "Tammy: Kind of.", "Sandy: All right. Get a deep stance. Every good punch, kick or block starts in a good stance. Straight leg, bend your knee. Hands up, tuck your chin. And you're going to want to snap that kick out there, like with the toes back, so you hit with the ball of the foot, you know? Nice. Yeah. Okay. Well, what about an attack. Someone grabs you, like this, from behind. You're trapped, right? Whoa!", "Tammy: Ooh, I'm sorry. Oh, are you okay?", "Sandy: It's okay. I'm good.", "Tammy: Sorry.", "Sandy: Where did you learn that?", "Tammy: My mom.", "Sandy: That was nice. Not as nice as this.", "Tammy: Oh. ( Laughter ) so what other moves do you know?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Okay. I have to face this. Come on cassie. Yes, can I be connected to dr. Sheehan's office, please. Thank you. Janie? Hi, it's cassie winslow. You just called me about setting up a pregnancy test? No, next week is too late. Is there any way that I can get in there today? Do you have any cancellations? That's great, I'll take it. Yeah. Absolutely. I'm on my way right now. Bye, thanks.", "Edmund: Where do you think you're going, young lady?", "Cassie: You're home. Promise me you'll love me forever.", "Edmund: Forever and ever.", "Cassie: No matter what... no matter what we'll always talk, and we'll never jump to conclusions with each other.", "Edmund: About what?", "Cassie: In anything, you know? You just always hear that couples never really listen to each other and they never really give each other the benefit of the doubt.", "Edmund: Cassie, cassie, nothing is ever going to come between us. Now what's going on?", "Cassie: Nothing, I just want to everything to stay the way it is right now. Edmumd, I love you so much.", "Edmund: I love you, too, but I still don't know...", "Cassie: I have to go out for a while, okay? I just have to go out for a little while. I'll be right back.", "Cassie: No, you're not going anywhere, cassie. You have you the flu.", "Cassie: Well, I'm going to the doctor, so maybe he can give me something.", "Edmund: All right, which doctor?", "Cassie: Dr. Sasson, the internist. ( Phone ringing )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Edmund: Hello?", "Nurse: It's janie from dr. Sheehan's office again. Cassie needs to bring her insurance card today. Mr. Winslow?", "Edmund: Right. Right, thank you. I'll be sure she doesn't forget.", "Nurse: Oh, and good luck. It sounds like this pregnancy test may be the one.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: What are you doing?", "Jonathan: Nothing. My buddy the owner, he lets me take what I want and I just leave him a note and he puts it on my tab, and I pay him later. But look, I got some stuff for you. Check it out.", "Reva: Thanks. Cool.", "Jonathan: You don't have to do that.", "Reva: Well, no, no. I just feel better if I paid for myself.", "Jonathan: Hey, I'm rich, remember?", "Reva: Yeah.", "Jonathan: Trust fund.", "Reva: I know, but that's money you're going to want to hang onto for your education or whatever else you choose to do with your life.", "Jonathan: I'm already doing it. I told myself that I was going to find my real mother, and i did it.", "Reva: I know it hasn't been easy for you at home.", "Jonathan: Well, neither of us.", "Reva: I'm sure it's hard to be in a place where you feel so unwanted.
