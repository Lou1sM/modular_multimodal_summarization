Appreciate it.", "Christopher: Hello there, stranger.", "Reva: Christopher! You know, we should do this more often and more regularly. I've missed this. I'm glad you suggested it.", "Christopher: I'm glad you noticed. Well, I've been giving you a little space, Reva. You've had a lot going on in your life lately. So, how are you?", "Reva: Uh-oh. That's usually what a shrink says to his client the first time they meet.", "Christopher: So, how are you?", "(Laughter)", "Reva: I am doing better.", "Christopher: I know. I've been keeping tabs on you.", "Reva: Really? And what have your little spies told you Dr. Langham?", "Christopher: Well, let's see, Shayne's surgery was a success and he started walking again, which is incredible.", "Reva: More than incredible, which is a down right miracle.", "Christopher: Sandy's feeling more comfortable with you and your family.", "Reva: Somewhat.", "Christopher: And from what I saw on New Year's Day, you and Josh are on the road to recovery.", "Reva: From your lips. I definitely feel like our marriage is getting back on track.", "Christopher: You're still waiting for the other shoe to drop?", "Reva: Yeah, well I don't like it, but that's kind of what life has taught me.", "Christopher: How's work? The show? You really busy at the TV station these days?", "Reva: No, it's manageable.", "Christopher: Then how would you like to start working with me again, seeing if we can take your psychic abilities to the next level?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: O'Neill, let's get something straight, okay? I'm not a fresh piece of meat out of the Academy that doesn't know what I'm doing. I've spent a great portion of my career working undercover, so please.", "Jeffrey: Investigating your own father.", "Gus: Look, am I happy about misleading Alan for the reasons I'm staying at Spaulding? No, I'm not. But the man is not guilty of any criminal activities.", "Jeffrey: \"Not guilty?\"", "Gus: No, he's not.", "Jeffrey: That's kind of difficult, proving the negative, you know?", "Gus: Well, it's doable. The man is not guilty, I can prove it.", "Jeffrey: Okay. I want you to start checking Spaulding's production records for Antinomious and cross-checking it with the shipping records. Now, we're looking for any irregularities, not just what the companies listed on that facts. That's just tip of the iceberg, but it's a good place to start.", "Gus: This is in Russian.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, it's been translated.", "Gus: Well, I would hope so. Well, first right off the bat, this shows the problem stems in the European Pharmaceuticals Division. That's all run by Alexandra. And she guards all of her books like a Doberman.", "Jeffrey: Then I guess we'll have to throw her a fresh piece of meat.", "Gus: You want me to charm the woman that I really, really can't stand. That's... you're going to owe me, O'Neill. You're going to owe me big.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Billy, what Buzz was telling you is absolutely true. Gus has been asking me a lot of questions. Now it all started when they pulled my car from the river. Now, that makes sense because it was registered in my name. But then he asked me about Maryanne Caruthers. I don't know how. Look, I know that. I know that. But this is all going to blow over very soon because we've been spending a lot of time together. He's going to go back on the force in a week. So I'm sure he'll be consumed with other cases, just like I am. I'll talk with you later about this.", "Alexandra: Alan, I don't care what the lawyer says, we have to do something about this.", "Alan: Do something about what?", "Alexandra: Olivia's marriage to Phillip, what else? We have to have it annulled.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: Listen, I'll call you back. Okay. Ross.", "Ross: Hi. I got a message that you want to see me.", "Danny: Yeah, come in.", "Ross: So, Danny, what is this about?", "Danny: This. How'd that piece about my cousin, Tony, being in a fight wind up on the front page of The Mirror , Ross?", "Ross: How should I know?", "Danny: Really? You or your people had nothing to do with that?", "Ross: Look, Tony was treated in a public hospital. So the people that treated him and any number of other people saw him come and go.", "Danny: Right, and because I'm running from mayor, of course it winds up on the front page.", "Ross: Well, you are now in the public eye. It goes with the territory.", "Danny: Along with how that reporter linked Tony to me and my campaign and the possibility of corruption all within the first two sentences.", "Ross: Well, that is called a \"lead-in.\"", "Danny: Yeah. Ross, did you or did you not plant that story?", "Ross: No, I did not. And neither did any of my people.", "Danny: Well, I hope not. Because that would be way beneath you.", "Ross: Which is why I didn't do it. But Danny, this is, after all, politics. You shouldn't be surprised if a little mud is slung your way.", "Danny: I know how the game works, Ross.", "Ross: Well, then, you should also know that it's not only about the truth, how you present it, how you spin it. So why don't you tell me? Is this story basically true? Was Tony in a fight? Was the mob involved? Because if that's the case, you should be angry at your cousin, not me. Well? Was Tony in a fight, as reported?", "Danny: I have no idea. I wasn't there, and neither was that so-called reporter. It's all supposition, Ross.", "Ross: Maybe, but political careers have been ruined with less.", "Danny: Is that what you're trying to do, ruin me?", "Ross: Danny, for the last time, I had nothing do with that newspaper article. But you are naive to think that your past is not an ongoing issue in this campaign.", "Danny: I know it's an issue, Ross, but it is the past.", "Ross: And the voters are just supposed to take your word for that?", "Danny: No, they don't have to. They'll see for themselves.", "Ross: If you're elected.", "Danny: Right.", "Ross: But what if they don't trust you enough to make this leap of faith? Now, granted, you've done wonderful things on Fifth Street, but that is Fifth Street. It's one project. And what if you are elected and the pressures mount, as they invariably do, and you're suddenly confronted with a problem that's not easily solved by following the rules? You think you would resort to old methods to fix things?", "Danny: Is that really, truly a concern of yours?", "Ross: Yeah, it is. Really.", "Danny: Really? You're not sure you're just paying lip service because you know you can get a lot of mileage out of it? Ross, come on, let's be real here. You honestly think that if I were elected mayor, I could do damage to Springfield and the people who live here?", "Ross: I hate to say it, Danny, but yes, I do.", "Danny: Well, that's your opinion. You're entitled to one. But you're wrong, and I'm going to prove you wrong. Just so you know, I'm not above playing hardball myself.", "Ross: I never doubted that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Well, I'm not going to stand by idly and watch that woman insinuate herself into this family again.", "Alan: I tried to buy her off twice, she's refused.", "Alexandra: The lawyers said that we had to prove that Phillip was incompetent at the time of this marriage, right? That he was under duress.", "Alan: That's the way I understand it.", "Alexandra: Fine. Then it appears to me the first thing we have to do the get Dr. Langham on our side.", "Alan: Well, that may be difficult. Because, you see, Dr. Langham told Olivia that Phillip was competent.", "Alexandra: Well, in that case, we have to find the minister who performed the ceremony and have him say that he saw Olivia pressuring Phillip.", "Alan: I suppose so.", "Alexandra: You can get a nurse or an orderly from Ravenwood to testify that he was medicated at the time.", "Alan: Perhaps.", "Alexandra: Of course if he was medicated at the time, he couldn't consent. He would be non compos mentis. And you know something that? That is doable. That is doable. The nurses and the orderlies are so notoriously underpaid, surely we can find one of them to step forward for the right incentive. Alan, have you heard a word I've said?", "Alan: I've heard everything you've said, Alexandra.", "Alexandra: Would you mind engaging just a little bit? Can you show some concern for the future of your son and the family, our company?", "Alan: Whatever road we take in this, my lawyers have assured me that this is going to be a long and hard-fought battle.", "Alexandra: Well, so? When has that ever stopped you before? Good God, Alan! Come on, what's happened to you? This new foray into fatherhood has just taken all the fight out of you.", "Alan: Hardly. I'm just choosing my battles more carefully now.", "Alexandra: Well I'd like to know what could possibly take precedence over this. Alan!", "Alan: Alexandra, I am not ignoring you. I will take care of this the way I take care of everything else in this family!", "Alexandra: Well, fine. Fine. Then the sooner you do it, the better, otherwise we may find yourself permanently connected to Olivia.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: I've got to go.", "Jeffrey: Why?", "Gus: I've got a big pow-wow at the mansion with Alexandra and Alex.", "Jeffrey: Oh, really? Anything I should know about?", "Gus: No. This is the family meeting that we have every week. The thing is that Alan thinks this is our last meeting before I go back to the force.", "Jeffrey: Careful how you tell him that you've made the decision to stay on.", "Gus: What, are you kidding me? The guy's going to be thrilled, he's been lobbying this for weeks.", "Jeffrey: He'll be thrilled, but he might not be thrilled if he's got something to hide. I'm just telling you watch his reaction, pay attention when you tell him.", "Gus: You got any pointers you'd like to give me?", "Jeffrey: Sorry.", "Gus: I'll be in touch.", "Jeffrey: Okay. Gus, the fax stays here.", "Gus: Right.", "Jeffrey: Yeah. Thank you.", "Gus: Where did you get that?", "Jeffrey: I got my sources.", "Gus: You got your sources inside my father's company?", "Jeffrey: That's right.", "Gus: If that's the case, I'd like to know about it, okay? I don't like working in the dark and I don't like anybody stepping on my toes?", "Jeffrey: I got a lot of people working for me and none of them know about each other, and that's the way it's going to stay.", "Gus: Well, let me tell you something: If I need to know about it, you are going to tell me. What if I need backup? What then? Who's got my back.", "Jeffrey: You'll have the very best, that I can assure you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: Danny's late. Bill said you guys were having a breakfast meeting, so I won't stay long. I just wanted to see how you were doing.", "Tony: How do I look? I'm fine. I'm fine.", "Eden: Sure you are. Does that hurt?", "Tony: No more than the rest of them.", "Eden: Tony, I will owe you forever for saving my life, and not just owe, I'll be very grateful.", "Tony: Oh, yeah? How grateful, Eden? Hmm?", "Eden: Don't do that, Tony.", "Tony: Don't do what?", "Eden: Don't belittle what you did.", "Tony: I'm not, Eden. All I did was mix it up with a guy with a blade. It's nothing I haven't done before. I've got a lot of scars to prove it. You want to see?", "Eden: Don't con me, Tony. You are hurting, and not just physically. You are hurting because Bill came down at you at the hospital.", "Tony: You know, about this life-saving thing, I'm not so sure that I even saved yours. If you had not been so smooth with that heel, I might not have lived long enough for this little nick, you know?", "Eden: Yeah, it was pretty smooth, wasn't it? We make a pretty good team.", "Tony: That's exactly my point.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: I know I haven't been holding up my things at the agency. I understand if you and Mel are mad at me.", "Blake: Oh, honey, we're not mad at you, we miss you. And I need to know, was it something I said or did, or didn't say or do?", "Harley: Blake, stop. You know that's not it.", "Blake: Well, then, that is it?", "Harley: I've just... I've been so distracted lately.", "Blake: With what?", "Harley: You know, Zach is... he's really upset, you know Phillip is sick. I mean, he doesn't really understand that Phillip is sick, but he senses something and he's heard things, so you wouldn't believe the battle it is getting him to school everyday.", "Blake: Tantrums?", "Harley: I can't even get him out of bed.", "Blake: Oh, I'm sorry. That's it? I mean, that's the whole reason why you haven't been coming in?", "Harley: Yeah, I promise. I'm going to make it up to you guys, I promise.", "Blake: Because I get the feeling that maybe you've been avoiding me and Mel for some reason. You think?", "Harley: I have been avoiding you guys.", "Blake: Why?", "Harley: Blake, isn't it obvious? Come on. The mayor's race. I mean, think about it. You are obviously voting for Ross, you know, he is your husband. And I'm sure that Mel is out there cheerleading for Danny, he's her brother-in- law. I mean, frankly, I don't know how you guys work together so well. Isn't it a little tense?", "Blake: Well, not really. I mean, any time that Mel starts talking about how Danny would make a better mayor, I just throw a lamp at her. Or I shove her into a closet. I mean, it basically puts an end to it.", "Harley: You would do that to a pregnant woman?", "Blake: Oh, shut up. So... who are you voting for?", "Harley: Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.", "Blake: Yes, you will.", "Harley: No, I won't.", "Blake: Oh, yes you will. And if it's Danny, I'm going to change your mind, no matter how long it takes.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: You better watch it, Tony, I'm getting wise to you.", "Tony: Oh, yeah?", "Eden: Yeah. When things get a little too real or there's something you don't want to admit, you fall back on a come-on.", "Tony: Did it work?", "Eden: Like that.", "Tony: All right, Eden, okay. I'll... I'll play along. What is it that I am afraid to admit? Tell me?. Huh?", "Eden: That you're hurting, like I said. That Bill came at you for no reason.", "Tony: Okay, so? Point is?", "Eden: What if Bill and Danny knew that you got into it with Bruzi to protect Danny's name, not tarnish it?", "Tony: Not going to happen. It's not. Now, back to you and me.", "Eden: Stop, please.", "Tony: Okay. You want me to be real?", "Eden: Yeah, I do, Tony?", "Tony: You do? Are you sure? Truth is -- here it goes -- truth is I don't give a damn what other people think about me, Eden, I don't. Least of all your boyfriend. You know, the only thing I did care about was that I was here when you needed me. That's it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Christopher: You never answered my question.", "Reva: Do I want a bite of your eggs benedict?", "Christopher: Are you ready to start our sessions again?", "Reva: Dang, I thought I was going to get around that one. Actually, I would like to. I mean, I... I miss it.", "Christopher: And me, of course.", "Reva: Well, that goes without saying. But I just... I don't think I'd have the time for it right now. I have so many other things in my head, stuff rolling around in there.", "Reva: Stuff?", "Reva: Yeah, mostly Sandy stuff.", "Christopher: Is there still tension between him and Marah?", "Reva: Oh, no, no. They seem to have pretty much worked through all that. It's more Sandy and me. He still... he won't forget that I gave him up. And even though he understands that I did it to protect him, it's still in his head that's....", "Christopher: And his heart is still this little kid who grew up feeling unloved and misunderstood. You want my professional advice based on years of advanced research and clinical study?", "Reva: Please.", "Christopher: Give it time. Really. There's no better way. Don't push too hard and find something else to occupy your time.", "Reva: Like working with you?", "Christopher: That's one possibility.", "Reva: I am tempted.", "Christopher: So, other than your concerns for Sandy, what else is holding you back?", "Reva: Honestly? Lately it seems that whenever I get a feeling that something's going to happen, you know, that weird feeling that it's right there, it's usually something about Joshua. I've been having disturbing dreams, visions that he's drowning and I can't save him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: And you know something else? I don't care how much Olivia protests that she married Phillip only to help him recover, protect him, and blah, blah, blah, all the other reasons. Because you and I both know her real agenda. She wants to insert herself into Spaulding, and launch a takeover.", "Olivia: No worries, not staying. Alan, I need to key to Phillips' office.", "Alexandra: Why?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Because there are some of things in his office that he's fond of, like his basketball trophies and photos. I'd like to take them to his room at Ravenwood, dress it up a bit, you know, make it seem less institutional.", "Alan: Well, Olivia, that's fine, but you won't need access to Phillip's office for that.", "Olivia: But his things are in his office, Alan.", "Alan: Not now. You see, we moved his things down the hall to a storage room.", "Olivia: What? Why?", "Alan: Because Gus is in his office while Phillip is incapacitated.", "Olivia: Well, out with the old son, in with the new, eh, Alan?", "Alan: You may be surprised, but Phillip asked Gus to sit in while he was incapacitated. But this is only temporary because Gus starts back on the force next week.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: That's what Gus was going to do, but actually plans have changed.", "Alan: Really? How's that?", "Gus: I'm going to stick around Spaulding for little while longer. That's what you wanted, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: There. Look, isn't that nice?", "Blake: (Makes buzzer sound) Avoidance maneuver, and not a very original one, I might add. Are you voting for Danny?", "Harley: No!", "Blake: You're not voting for Danny?", "Harley: No.", "Blake: You're not voting period. Well, that's down right un-American.", "Harley: Blake, give it a rest. Please, have something to eat. Have some coffee.", "Blake: What are you unsure of? Ross's position on the homeless shelter that they want to build at Adams and Creedmore? He's for it. Floating a bond for a waste management plant? He's against it.", "Harley: I don't want to talk politics. I really don't. Let's talk about you. You look beautiful. Are you lightening your hair?", "Blake: Were you shocked how much your property taxes were last year? Now if Ross had been in office, that wouldn't have happened.", "Harley: Stop! Please, please.", "(Phone rings)", "Blake: Well, get it.", "Harley: It can wait.", "Blake: Who is it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: It is... you know what? It's actually going to take a second. One second. One second. Harley Cooper.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well I kind of like Terrier myself. So what's up, Pooch?", "Harley: Nothing.", "Jeffrey: What do you mean nothing? You asked me to get back to you ASAP. What's going on?", "Harley: Things happen, things change. I've got somebody here. Can I call you later?", "Jeffrey: Brad Green?", "Harley: Can I call you later?", "Jeffrey: Alexandra Spaulding?", "Harley: No. Can I talk to you later?", "Jeffrey: Do you want me to send someone in there?", "Harley: Everything's fine, I've got somebody here, I'll call you back.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Blake: Who was it?", "Harley: It was nobody.", "Blake: So you said.", "Harley: It is a friend of Zach's at school, it's his mother. Somebody I've gotten to know a little bit.", "Blake: Gee, kind of testy.", "Harley: Was I?", "Blake: Oh, yeah, you were.", "Harley: Well, you know, she kind of brings that out in me, this woman. She is very, very pushy, you know? She doesn't know when to back off. Sound familiar?", "Blake: Uh-huh. So this is how I see it. You either have two choices. You either tell me who that really was, or you tell me who you're really going to vote for for mayor. Take your pick.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Eden: You were there for me, Tony, and I appreciate it. Not just for me, but for Bill. His reputation means a lot to him.", "Tony: Yeah, and that's important to you.", "Eden: Yeah, it is.", "Tony: Okay. Well, ain't love grand? Eden, look, just... just go back to him. Play whatever the hell it is you're playing. Just... when it's over, I'll be around.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Christopher: These impressions you're getting of Josh drowning, are they literal or symbolic of something else?", "Reva: See, that's what's driving me crazy. I keep trying to use the methods you taught me to interpret the images that I get, but I can't because something keeps stopping me from connecting them. But the impressions are so strong and so persistent enough that they make me feel that Josh really needs me right now. I don't know how. I don't know why, but I think he needs to be my priority and I can't let anything distract me from that.", "Christopher: Then don't. Our work can wait. I'm not going anywhere. Uh... actually, I am. I have an appointment. Where does the time go?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: So, Gus, you're staying on? Well... are you sure the Springfield PD can spare you?", "Gus: Well, they're going to have to because my sticking around is pretty important. Unless, of course, you've changed your mind. That is what you want, right?", "Alan: Well, of course, of course. I'm very happy. I mean....", "Gus: Good.", "Alan: If you're happy.", "Gus: I'm happy. I'm very happy.", "Alexandra: Gosh, everybody's happy. Well, isn't that lovely. Are you happy, too, Olivia? I mean, Phillip's got what he wants and you do love him so much, don't you? Oh, and oh, by the way, you don't know, do you? Olivia's your new sister-in-law. Yes. She married Phillip in his hospital room, and we are all so deliriously delighted.", "Gus: Serious?", "Olivia: Yes, yes, she's serious. And she's right. I do love Phillip very much, and I plan to take good care of him. Alan, who has the key to the storage closet that you put your other son's things in.", "Alan: My secretary.", "Olivia: Oh, goody, I'll talk to her. Bye.", "Gus: Olivia?", "Olivia: Yeah?", "Gus: I just want to say congratulations.", "Olivia: Thank you, Gus.", "Alexandra: Well, I suppose I should be nice and accompany her and make sure nothing gets stolen.", "Gus: Olivia and Phillip, wow.", "Alan: Yeah, that kind of sums it up. I'm sure she was here because she wants Phillip's office. So you may have a bit of trouble on your hands now that you're staying.", "Gus: Oh, I could care less. As long as you're... as long as you're happy.", "Alan: Yeah, of course. Of course I'm happy. Look, I need to speak with Thomas about something. I'll see you later.", "Gus: Yeah, you seem real, real happy.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Tony: You're late.", "Danny: You want to tell me about this?", "Tony: No, I do not.", "Danny: No?", "Tony: No.", "Danny: What's going on with you, Tony?", "Tony: Well, actually, Danny, I'm having a glass of orange juice. Would you like some?", "Danny: As if dumping Marah wasn't enough.", "Tony: You know if it's going to go there, I'm going to leave.", "Danny: Then you go and buy some dumb farm.", "Tony: It's a ranch. It's a ranch with horses.", "Danny: And then you go and get involved with Eden again.", "Tony: What the hell are you talking about?", "Danny: I saw you here with her not two minutes ago. I don't want to get into that. I want to talk about this. What the hell were you thinking?", "Tony: I'm not talking about anything, nothing. Okay? Look, I got jumped by two guys, Danny, by two guys, okay. I'm on a coffee run. I'm fine, thanks for asking me.", "Danny: That's what happened? Why didn't you call me?", "Tony: What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Are you going to teach these guys a lesson? You're not in this line of work anymore, remember?", "Danny: And you are?", "Tony: You know something, forget it? I don't need to sit here and listen to this. I tried to do something decent for you, and this is how you repay me? Forget it!", "Danny: What does that mean, \"something decent for me?\" What does that mean?", "Tony: I'm telling you, back off now.", "Danny: I'm sorry.", "Tony: Back off.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Oh, my gosh. Blake. Talk about a terrier. Okay. For the absolute last time, I have no idea who it is I'm voting for!", "Olivia: Good. Me, neither. Hi.", "Harley: Olivia, hi.", "Olivia: Is this a bad time?", "Harley: No.", "Olivia: Can I come in?", "Harley: Sure. Of course. Come in.", "Olivia: Looks like you are having company.", "Harley: No, I had company. This was Blake. That's the one who I was actually yelling at.", "Olivia: Oh, well.", "Harley: What's up?", "Olivia: Look, I know that we're not exactly close, but you were wonderful when I came back to town and I was going through all of that and you came to my shower and I... okay. I've got some news. Good news.", "Harley: Well, great, because I love good news.", "Olivia: Good. It's good for me. Phillip and I got married yesterday.", "Harley: Wow. That is...", "Olivia: It's a surprise. It is a surprise and I don't expect you to like it or approve or anything, but I wanted you to know because you're Zach's mom and you had a right to know since I'm going to be a part of his life.", "Harley: Olivia, can I be blunt?", "Olivia: Have you ever been anything else?", "Harley: Why... why? Why? Why marriage? Why Phillip, actually? No, why now? I'm sorry, it's just... a couple of months ago you were, I guess, so eager to be away from him that you just up and left town. And to be blunt, isn't that really part of the reason he's such a mess now?", "Olivia: Yeah, yeah, and I feel terrible about that.", "Harley: You didn't marry him out of pity, did you?", "Olivia: No, no, I love him. And, yeah, I do feel like I owe him. I do. Especially right now. He needs somebody in his corner to look out for his best interests, you know. Especially now that Gus is staying on at Spaulding. And this isn't about Gus, I have nothing against him, but it's clear that Alan wants Gus to step into Phillip's shoes, and I just don't think it's fair to Phillip right now.", "Harley: I'm sorry. I heard all that, could you... would you mind backing up a second. What did you say? Did you say... is Gus staying on at Spaulding? No, he's going back to the force.", "Olivia: No, he's staying at Spaulding. He just announced it at the mansion a while ago. He didn't call you, uh-huh.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley (to herself): Maybe Olivia is wrong. Uh-huh. She's mellowed out, she likes Alan, he likes her... a little. A little bit. And the other thing is he can't be there. Not with everything else that's going on. He can'T... he can't be around Brad Green anymore, you know, that is not safe. And he cannot find out about Jeffrey. No. No. It's not going to work.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Okay, it's definitely going to work out, because if anybody can work this stuff out, we can. Let's take it calm and easy. Hi, honey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Door slams)", "Danny: What is your problem?", "Tony: I'm in pain. I'm in pain.", "Danny: All right. That's fair enough. Sit down so I can talk to you.", "Tony: What do you want to talk about? What do you want to talk about, Danny?", "Danny: What do you think I want to talk about? Just tell me how this happened to you. Who did this to you?", "Tony: I didn't get a good look at him.", "Danny: Well, I ask because there was an incident at my house last night.", "Tony: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, the message, Michelle and the gas. So, what, you think these two are related?", "Danny: I think someone could be sending me a message, yeah. Tony, this is... come on, was it Bruzi's guys or Salerno's?", "Tony: You don't want to know.", "Danny: Yeah, I do want to know.", "Tony: You don't want to know, Danny. Listen to me, you stay clean. Stay clean now.", "Danny: How am I supposed to take care of that this?", "Tony: I will do it. I'll snoop around and see what I can find. I'll do it!", "Danny: I don't want to you in the middle of this.", "Tony: Will you look at me?", "Danny: I'm looking at you.", "Tony: I'm already in the middle of it, Danny. Now, if someone's sending you a message, I'll make sure they get theirs. That's what I do best, right?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: So we're closing in on the Spaulding operation, which means we have to coordinate the efforts between the agencies. Bob, did you speak with Marshall about the DEA sharing its intelligence with the team?", "DEA Agent: Yeah. It won't be a problem.", "Jeffrey: Okay.", "FBI Agent: My people gave it the all-clear, too.", "Jeffrey: Great. That leaves you, Tom.", "CIA Agent: We're on board. Are all your operatives in place now?", "Jeffrey: Yes, for now. You have the dossiers in your hands. I've got one guy on the inside at Spaulding at top management level. I've got someone else working Brad Green and Alexandra Spaulding from a personal angle. And now I want to introduce to you somebody who's going to be very critical in handling a very important component of this investigation. You want to come out now?", "Harley: Next on Guiding Light...", "Jeffrey: Something on your mind, Doc?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Christopher: Yeah.
