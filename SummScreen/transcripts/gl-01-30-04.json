{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["Harley is furious with Gus for deciding to stay on at Spaulding and for having had to find it out from someone else. Gus defends but he's unable to tell her the real reason he's staying that he's undercover for Jeffrey. Likewise, Harley's unable to tell him the real reason she wants him out of the company: she doesn't want him caught up in the dirty business she's investigating. Frustration mixed with anger and hurt makes for a volatile mix and they argue loudly as Zach happens onto the scene, upset that they are yelling at each other. Harley's the observer as Gus talks to Zach about it and she realizes he's only doing what he feels he must. She apologizes for trying to order him not to stay at the company. They make love but Harley's words haven't been a solace for Gus. Jeffrey reveals his last undercover operative to his federal cohorts: Christopher who is to help shepherd Reva and her talents into their investigation. But Christopher is clearly reluctant and tells Jeffrey he thinks she's had too unstable a life recently to risk harming her any further. Jeffrey encourages Christopher to try once more and Christopher goes to Reva trying to give her every out, but she wants to continue with their work. Meanwhile, Billy and Josh confer over the tunnels they believe are being used by the person pulling the stings with Marah, Michelle and Marina to uncover what happened to Maryanne Caruthers. Beth finds Jeffrey and confesses she's had an epiphany: he was right about her\u0096 she should have lived more in the moment and taken their affair for what it was \u0096 an affair. This catches Jeffrey off-guard who is in the midst of trying to get Marah off his mind. As he wishes what Beth is saying to be true, they make love one more time. Meanwhile, Marah experiences a series of spooky moments when her childhood doll that she keeps trying to put away reappears without any explanation. She puts the doll away in her closet only to find it again in her desk drawer. She reaches for it and pulls back she's been cut, badly."], "Recap Author": "Megan", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["Jeffrey: The connection between Spaulding Pharmaceuticals and illicit drug trafficking has eluded us for many years, gentlemen. But guess what? That is all going to come to an end. We are currently in the process of pulling a lot of seemingly unrelated areas together. Dr. Langham here is going to be of critical importance in delivering to us the unique abilities of a certain individual by the name of Reva Shayne Lewis.", "FBI Agent: We'll have to do our own vetting.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, that's done, okay? Anyone got a problem, see me. No one -- I repeat no one -- is to approach her. Dr. Langham here is her handler. Is that clear?", "CIA Agent: We're in the dark about a lot of this.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, that's 'cause you're not running the show. And that's just something you're going to have to get used to, okay? This is my investigation, and I'm not going to let go of it.", "CIA Agent: You're using too many civilians.", "Jeffrey: These are people that are well-placed in the community to arouse the least suspicion, and they're people that I trust.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "DEA Agent: The undercovers that you have at Spaulding?", "Jeffrey: Gus Aitoro and Harley Cooper.", "DEA Agent: Yeah. He's tough, but he's a loose cannon. She's brilliant, but she's a flake. And Reva Lewis...", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, yeah. You know, I've been described as a loose cannon my whole career, Jim, and I outrank you. As far as Harley Cooper's concerned, she's about as flaky as a barracuda. And Reva Lewis, well, she's not on anyone's radar, and that's the way I want to keep it. So, unless there are any other questions, that... that'll be all, gentlemen.", "Christopher: Promising Reva on a silver platter? I don't think I like that.", "Jeffrey: Something on your mind, Doc?", "Christopher: Yeah, and I'm sure you're not going to like it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Billy: This is the best I've been able to come up with so far.", "Josh: This tunnel system is unbelievable. Look at the patterns here. It criss- crosses the entire town.", "Billy: Yeah. I think this guy that's torturing us really does not want to be found. You could take a long time to figure out your way down there.", "Josh: (Sighs) I'll find him.", "Billy: Good. Hey, you know, I'm glad to have you back on board. And just... you're not going to talk to...", "Josh: No.", "Billy: Okay.", "Josh: No, I'm not going to talk to Frank. Don't worry about it. I'm not going to squeal, Billy.", "Billy: Hey, I'm just glad you came to your senses, that's all. The girls are in real danger.", "Josh: Yeah, and that's the only reason I am here. And I think the problem is they don't realize the danger that they're in.", "Billy: Well, now, I think we can make that work for us.", "Reva: Have what work?", "Billy: Hey, hello.", "Reva: You guys are working out some big mega-million-dollar mall or something?", "Billy: Shame on you, girl. You know I'm against urban sprawl.", "Reva: Unless you're being paid to build it.", "Billy: That's right.", "(Laughter)", "Reva: So you're hiding the blueprints. What do you think, I'm a spy for the competition?", "Billy: No, I'm actually just clearing away here so you can have a little lunch and keep my blueprints clean. I'll leave these with you and let you guys catch up.", "Josh: Okay.", "Billy: All right.", "Josh: Don't even... don't even worry about him, okay? Why don't you have a seat?", "Reva: Oh, um...", "Josh: Just... just for a minute.", "Reva: Okay.", "Josh: See, I was planning to call you about last night. I'm just sorry. I didn't like the way things ended. I... (Sighs)... I guess I just never want to have to say good- bye to you again.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Door slams)", "Gus: Are you kidding? Who told you?", "Harley: Do you really think that matters? The point is I had to find out from somebody else that you're staying on at Spaulding? Is that true?", "Gus: God.", "Harley: Because, see, that's the kind of thing I think you would tell me directly. I think we have that kind of relationship.", "Gus: I am staying on at Spaulding.", "Harley: What did you think? Did you think I wouldn't notice?!", "Gus: Could you calm down, please? I was driving on the way... I was coming over here to... that's what I'm trying to do! Okay, I was even rehearsing how to say it to you outside!", "Harley: That is so lame. You could have called me from the office.", "Gus: Called you? Sorry, I didn't call you, I should have called... Oh, sue me! What?! You never had something that was difficult for you to say to me and you didn't, you held it back for some reason or another? Come on.", "Harley: No, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. No, no, no. Let's focus here on what I had to hear from somebody else, not whether you were planning on telling me or what I might say or anything. What, Spaulding Enterprises? What, forever? Do you have any idea what a complete disaster this is? Do you have any idea what is going on?", "Gus: Yes, I know exactly what I'm doing.", "Harley: No, I don't think you do.", "Gus: Oh, oh, you know so much more than me. You know better for me.", "Harley: You're damn right I do!", "Gus: Honey, is this one of the same, old, standard, generic Spaulding warnings? Because if it is, I got to tell you, it is really getting old, okay? Do you really think you know that much more about these people than I do? Because I do, I know a lot. Okay?", "Harley: What is there Why this? They don't care. They don't care. And they're not going to be impressed, and you're fooling yourself if you think they will be.", "Gus: Honey, this is not the way I thought it was going to play out, okay, but this is the way it's going. This is the way it is.", "Harley: Well, what is that supposed to mean? You act like you have no choice.", "Gus: I don't have a choice!", "Harley: No, you do have a choice! We all have a choice, sweetie. And I'm telling you something, if you are choosing Alan Spaulding and anybody else in that family over anything in our lives, well, I'm not letting you walk out the door!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: Okay, good, good, good. (Laughs)", "Marah: Oh, look at you.", "Marina: I know, isn't it amazing?", "Marah: Well, you want to do it again, because I didn't get to see it.", "Shayne: Well, I'll do it again if you promise to let me set you up with another one of my friends. How about that?", "Marah: Oh, as much as I would love to see you sprint across the room, it's not going to happen.", "Shayne: Come on. Hey, tell me what was wrong with Luke anyway?", "Marah: Nothing, nothing was wrong with Luke. It's, you know, it's my problem. I hate blind dates. Besides, you don't need any incentive from me to walk. You've got Marina.", "Shayne: Yes, I do. And she's too good to be true.", "Marina: What'd I tell you about saying that?", "Marah: It's true. He's right.", "Marina: Don't. I just... yeah, well, I don't want him thinking he's just lucky, you know, or I'm like some angel or whatever. We're doing all of this through hard work.", "Marah: Yeah, I know, but...", "Marina: Are you okay?", "Marah: I thought I put that away. Actually, I'm positive that I did.", "Marina: I don't know. You probably just forgot or something, you know. It's not like you haven't been distracted.", "Marah: Yeah, I guess. So have you talked to Michelle?", "Marina: She's... she's okay.", "Marah: Nobody's tried to gas her again?", "Marina: You still think that thing wasn't an accident?", "Marah: Would I trust Carrie with my life? Would I trust her to save me if I was about to die?", "Marina: She might have saved Michelle.", "Marah: Yeah, so she says.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: This isn't going to help, Mom. Not at all.", "Beth: Honey, your father married Olivia. Life goes on. Let's not ruin our lives because somebody else made a questionable choice.", "Billy: You listen to your mother, young lady.", "Lizzie: Hi, Mr. Lewis.", "Billy: How you doing?", "Lizzie: See, my mom thinks that shrimp cocktail and some chocolate mousse is going to make me forget that my dad married the Wicked Witch of Springfield.", "Beth: Olivia.", "Billy: Whoo, definitely Wicked Witch of the West. Well, we'll just have to wish your dad luck, huh?", "Lizzie: See, Mom, everybody knows.", "Beth: Uh, Lizzie, our table is ready, so, it was nice seeing you, Billy.", "Billy: Nice to see you, too, Beth. And even though your dad and I don't see eye to eye, he's a pretty smart guy. I think he may just realize what he's got himself into pretty soon.", "Lizzie: Thanks, I hope so. Hey, why don't you join us?", "Beth: Uh, honey, Billy doesn't want to listen to our problems.", "Billy: Actually, I'm going to go back and join my brother. I'm just letting him and his wife get a few moments together. Y'all enjoy yourself. Thank you.", "Beth: Take care, Billy.", "Lizzie: Josh and Reva are so romantic. You know, losing each other and then finding each other again. I just wish you and Dad could be more like that.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: You know, I would love to never hear you say good-bye to me again. So, from now on, I want to hear you say \"see you later\" or \"I'll be back in a minute.\" I'm just as tired of good-byes as you are.", "Josh: I'm glad to hear that.", "Reva: You know, I had a feeling about you last night.", "Josh: \"A feeling?\"", "Reva: Um-hmm. That once you left, you weren't coming back again -- ever.", "Josh: I know, I'm sorry, I said a lot of things last night. But it's going to be okay. It's not something we have to worry about.", "Reva: You made the meeting sound so important and yet you were so vague.", "Josh: I'm not going anywhere.", "Reva: Does that mean you want to move back in?", "Josh: There's still a lot of things that I have to work through, some things that I have to tie up. It's going to take up a lot of my time. It may be disruptive.", "Reva: It's okay.", "Josh: I'm not going to be on...", "Reva: It's okay.", "Josh: ...A regular schedule, you know. And it may seem, at times, like our life is unpredictable.", "Reva: Joshua...", "Josh: I'm just saying that once I get through all of this, all of our problems will be in the past.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: You know, I got a thing about bad news, Chris. It's that I don't like to hear it.", "Christopher: Who does?", "Jeffrey: Is this about Reva?", "Christopher: You've been counting on me to deliver her, having her work for you without her knowledge.", "Jeffrey: Sounds simple enough.", "Christopher: Well, it's not.", "Jeffrey: Chris, you're one of the best profilers we have.", "Christopher: No. This is something different.", "Jeffrey: How? Were you wrong about Reva?", "Christopher: No, Reva's one of the most talented psychics I've ever come across.", "Jeffrey: Well, that's exactly why we want to use her on this case.", "Christopher: And so do I. Look, I signed on for this because I wanted to serve my country, maybe help put some bad guys behind bars.", "Jeffrey: So far, we're still on the same page.", "Christopher: Reva was just a name on a file when I started working with you. But I've... I've become friends with her. She's been going through a lot with her son Shayne's accident and then the sudden appearance of her other son. I don't want to do anything that might jeopardize her well-being.", "Jeffrey: I think you underestimate just how strong Reva really is.", "Christopher: Well, I am not going to push her to the limit to find out.", "Jeffrey: Well, then, we do have a problem, Doc. It's you.", "Christopher: Maybe I am the problem, but I'm not going to do anything that might harm Reva.", "Jeffrey: Yeah, neither would I. Okay, she's one of the few people in this town that I actually like, so you can drop the sanctimony and this Hippocratic Oath nonsense, okay? Because it's not flying.", "Christopher: Jeffrey...", "Jeffrey: Listen to me, okay. If I have to leverage you, I will! Okay, I will find whatever I have to find and I will do whatever it takes to complete this investigation!", "Christopher: You are not threatening me.", "Jeffrey: Oh, no, I'm not, I'm telling you how it is, okay? I want Reva! And you're going to deliver her to me. Okay, so, and I don't want any of your personal feelings or any of your intuitions falling into the mix. Now, have you approached her?", "Christopher: I've broached the topic with her.", "Jeffrey: Okay, good. So stick to the plan, feel her out, okay? If she decides she wants to continue with her s\u00e9ances with you, well, then that's what you're going to do, okay?", "Christopher: And if she says no?", "Jeffrey: Then you will convince her otherwise! That incident with Shayne was a couple of months ago, okay? The kid has gone through a couple of major operations already. The kid is going to walk again. Her long lost son is integrating nicely into the community. And even Josh is coming around, okay? Reva's life is on an upswing.", "Christopher: And if she says no?", "Jeffrey: Well, then, we'll have to improvise, okay? I mean, I... Doesn't this run in the family, this gift?", "Christopher: Sometimes.", "Jeffrey: Well, good, then we'll check out the sister. Find out about Cassie Winslow. Test her out, okay? Maybe she's got the sight and doesn't even know about it.", "Christopher: It's doubtful. If she had it, it would have manifested by now.", "Jeffrey: Well, it's worth a try.", "Christopher: Then we should also test Reva's daughter.", "Jeffrey: Marah, yeah. Of course. Test them both. But Reva is a proven entity, so make sure you get an honest read on her before you bail, right? So, that's all.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: What can I say, Marina? I don't trust Carrie.", "Marina: Well, I do trust Michelle. And she doesn't necessarily think that Carrie had anything to do with it.", "Marah: Michelle was losing oxygen to her brain when she saw Carrie standing above her. I don't know why or how she could even think Carrie was trying to help her.", "Marina: Well, maybe because it's true. I mean, what does Carrie have to gain by hurting any of us? Without us, her story never gets out. Maryanne Caruthers' death doesn't mean anything. She needs us to trust her.", "Marah: No, I still think we need to keep Carrie on her toes and let her know that we are not her puppets.", "Marina: Fine. I'm going to go check on Shayne.", "Marah: I swear I put you away. You're really getting on my nerves. This time I'm going to put you in the back of my closet in a box.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Is that the best you can come up with? That you're going to keep me a prisoner in the house?", "Harley: If that's what it takes to keep you from Spaulding Enterprises, yes!", "Gus: You sound like a nut-job, you know that?", "Harley: No, you do.", "Gus: You're crazy.", "Harley: You are!", "Gus: Look at yourself! What, you make all the rules, now, is that it?", "Harley: Maybe I make the rules because I know that snake pit of a family better than you do! Hey, I'm not the crazy person here walking around with a misguided, romantic notion: I'm a Spaulding and I'm going to live happily ever after.", "Gus: Oh, listen to you! Now, you're just being mean-spirited, honey. You're being mean-spirited!", "Harley: That would be you. Whatever it takes, I don't care.", "Gus: Well, how about this, how about you're just being an irrational woman? I'd like that.", "Harley: I'm being irrational? Well, next, you're going to tell me it must be that time of the month.", "Gus: Well, I think I'm going to start keeping track.", "Harley: You are breaking a promise to me. That's why I am so upset, okay? That's what this whole thing is about. You are picking Alan and the rest of that family above me, and you're not even asking me my opinion!", "Gus: (Mumbling) Oh, my...", "Harley: Huh? Yeah, well, who's saying what now? Convince me I'm wrong. Go ahead, answer me. Say something. And you know why you can't say anything? Because you know I'm right!", "Gus: Hi, Zach.", "Zach: Mommy, why are you and Gus yelling?", "Harley: Hey, buddy. Oh, Zach, I'm sorry. Did me and Gus yelling, did that scare you, hon?", "Zach: Why were you yelling?", "Harley: Well, you know what?", "Gus: Yeah, we were yelling. We were yelling. You know, we did everything, but almost punch each other in the head and then pull each other's hair. It's fun, it's scary, right? Huh? Scary when you hear people who love each other sound that way, like they don't love each other or something? But you know what? That's what people who are in love do. They get all riled up, you know. And I'll be thinking one thing, and your mom here, she'll be thinking another. And then I'll get loud about my idea, and then your mom gets even louder, and before you know, we're both so loud nobody can even hear each other! That's what happens.", "Zach: No more yelling.", "Gus: Got it. No more yelling.", "Harley: No more yelling, we promise.", "Gus: All right.", "Harley: Okay?", "Gus: You're going upstairs. You want a piggyback? Get on, let's go.", "Harley: Back to bed.", "Gus: That's it. Okay.", "Harley: Hold him.", "Gus: I got him.", "Harley: (Laughs)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Beth: Well, I don't know about you, but I am definitely starting to feel better.", "Lizzie: Yeah, because you're so simple that they give you chocolate and everything's peachy again.", "Beth: Honey, the sooner you start to enjoy the simpler things in life, the happier you'll be. You know, I worry about you sometimes, because growing up in the Spaulding mansion, I don't think you understand that.", "Lizzie: Look, Mom, I know you're trying to help me and everything. Just being here is making me feel even worse. Okay, I really, really want to go.", "Beth: Oh, well, okay, okay. You go ahead.", "Lizzie: Aren't you coming with me?", "Beth: No, I think I'm going to stay here. I might even have another chocolate mousse.", "Lizzie: Don't you dare.", "(Laughter)", "Lizzie: Are you sure it's okay?", "Beth: It's fine, it's fine. Just send the car back for me. I might have a little glass of wine.", "Lizzie: All right.", "Beth: Things are going to get better, honey.", "Lizzie: I don't think either of us believe that. Now, you behave yourself, all right?", "Beth: I am so glad I have you to look out for me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Billy: Oh, hey, assistant prosecutor right there.", "Josh: Yeah, well, you know what? You looking over at him with a guilty expression on your face isn't going to help the situation.", "Billy: This guy thinks everybody's guilty.", "Josh: That's his job, Billy.", "Billy: Look, what's he doing here?", "Josh: I don't know. A man's got to eat. What... I don't know what he's doing here.", "Billy: Or maybe he's just checking us out.", "Josh: Billy, I don't appreciate the paranoia, okay?", "Billy: Look, Josh, I've talked to some people in the know, and they said once this guy hit town, he's got his finger in all the pies.", "Josh: Jeffrey is not a threat to Marah. Why don't we keep focused on the task at hand, okay? We have to figure out these plans.", "Billy: All right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Beth: Mind if I share something with you?", "Jeffrey: Beth.", "Beth: Jeffrey.", "Jeffrey: Sitting?", "Beth: Why not?", "Jeffrey: To what do I owe this pleasure?", "Beth: Well, I was hoping that by the end of the conversation, we could kiss and make up.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Right here, there's a spur adjacent to the museum. I'm going to grab a flashlight and I'm going to start down...", "Billy: Why don't you grab two flashlights?", "Josh: No. I'll do this alone. You need to stick around, keep an eye on the girls.", "Billy: Okay, look, Josh, just one thing about Reva.", "Josh: What?", "Billy: I just... I just don't think you should spend too much time, you know...", "Josh: You know what? You don't have to worry about Reva, okay. I'll handle Reva. But don't worry about me, either. I'm not going to give into my...", "Billy: Your noble nature.", "Josh: That's right. I'll try not to make that mistake again.", "Billy: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Knock at door)", "Reva: Hey.", "Christopher: Hi. I'm sorry to be pressuring you.", "Reva: You're not. Please come in. So, you want to know whether I'm ready to go back to work. And you need to know this, what, like, right now?", "Christopher: I got a call from the board that funds my research. They need me to move on if I'm going to continue my funding, so I needed to confirm with you that you're still on hiatus. Because if you are, I have to find somebody else to work with.", "Reva: You don't have to, because I am ready to get back to work.", "Christopher: Are you sure? I don't... I don't want to force you into an answer.", "Reva: Do you think anybody forces me into anything? I love the work we did together, and I want it to continue. The sooner the better. So, I've pretty much turned myself down to low simmer. I haven't really made any great efforts to read anyone, and I haven't had any overwhelming visions.", "Christopher: Well, you've been dealing with a lot of personal problems, so turning yourself off for a while was a good idea.", "Reva: I think so. And having you give me permission made it a whole lot easier for me to take a break.", "Christopher: And how are you feeling now?", "Reva: More in control. I feel like I can make a psychic sweep of my life now every day and everyone in it.", "Christopher: Picking up anything interesting?", "Reva: Just vibes. Or lack thereof.", "Christopher: How do you mean?", "Reva: Well, you know, I always pick up something from everyone I encounter, whether they're related to me or not, but Sandy is very odd. I get nothing from him. He's my son, and I get absolutely nothing.", "Christopher: He's a pretty guarded young man.", "Reva: I know, but nothing. I don't know, maybe I just need to pay more attention to Sandy. But as far as we're concerned, I'm so ready to flex my muscles again. Honestly, without your guidance, I've felt a bit lost.", "Christopher: I don't want to push.", "Reva: You're not. I feel like I'm getting my life back again, and it's making me greedy for more.", "Christopher: Well, I'll be in touch.", "Reva: Good.", "Christopher: Oh, before I go, I'm curious: Has Cassie ever mentioned having any kind of abilities like yours?", "Reva: Oh, we've discussed it, but, no, I think she's too practical.", "Christopher: What about Marah?", "Reva: No, why?", "Christopher: Well, sometimes this trait runs in families.", "Reva: Yeah, I mean, Cassie and I have joked around about what it would be like if she could read people's minds, too, but, I don't know, I can ask her again.", "Christopher: Good. Would you?", "Reva: Yes.", "Christopher: And talk to Marah, too.", "Reva: Okay.", "Christopher: I can arrange some tests later in the week just to be sure.", "Reva: Well, I'll find out whether or not they're interested first. Thank you so much for coming by. I feel like you're giving me a second chance. And I can't wait to find out where we'll take it this time.", "Christopher: Me, too.", "Reva: 'Night.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Forgive me if I'm just a little bit slow on the uptake, but it just sounded like you were...", "Beth: Coming on to you?", "Jeffrey: Yeah. As a matter of fact, it was very close to that. So what's going on?", "Beth: Just trying out my wings, testing the waters.", "Jeffrey: Uh.", "Beth: They're both fine. Simply put, what happened between us, as annoying and painful as it was...", "Jeffrey: Beth, come on, the ground rules were always clear, were they not?", "Beth: Yes, yes, they were. But talking about having an open relationship and actually having an open relationship are two different things. My pride was on the line and my heart. I needed you to need me.", "Jeffrey: Well, you know, those feelings aren't.. aren't so bad, you know, to want someone so much, to need to be fulfilled inside.", "Beth: Whoa. (Laughs) Aren't I talking to Mr. No Commitment, Mr. Everything- Doesn't-Have-To-Be-Fraught-With-Meaning?", "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, I might have been wrong about some of that.", "Beth: I see. Well, let's talk about me first, and then we'll pry your heart open.", "Jeffrey: Well, haven't you heard? My heart is closed for business, so onto you, okay?", "Beth: You wanted a casual affair. I wasn't ready to throw myself out there like that. I've spent my life investing in one man, loving one man.", "Jeffrey: Well, like I said, that's not so bad, right? Well, unless it really is that bad.", "Beth: We're not talking about you, yet.", "Jeffrey: Who said anything about me?", "Beth: I'm smarter than that, you know it. The short story is that at this point in my life, I should be having something with someone different every month if I feel like it. Do you know how many men I've been tied to?", "Jeffrey: Are you free now?", "Beth: You were right. Giving into the moment, giving into whomever you find happiness with at the moment is very liberating. And for me right now, it would be very healthy.", "Jeffrey: So is this the part where I get to sleep with the New Beth?", "Beth: Now how would Marah feel about that? ( Laughs) It's funny, isn't it? I'm finally at a place in my life where I can enjoy the possibility of seeing more than one man, while you -- irony of ironies -- are heavily invested in one woman. Do you remember when you told me that romance is about the freedom to love, the freedom to leave?", "Jeffrey: I still believe that.", "Beth: But it's getting harder all the time, isn't it? I'm going to pry into your heart now. Are you ready? (Laughs)", "Jeffrey: Oh, I can't wait.", "Beth: You don't know how it happened, but something about Marah does something to you. Maybe it's not love, I don't know. But whatever it is, whether it's her youth, her innocence, her talent, whatever it is, it defies your sense of logic. But yet you can't tear yourself away.", "Jeffrey: And you know all this because?", "Beth: Because Bill was my Marah. He was older than she is, but...", "Jeffrey: You were older than he was.", "Beth: And it's uncomfortable.", "Jeffrey: God, you have no idea. (Laughs)", "Beth: Yes, I do. I mean, who else in this town could you talk to about this? You'll thank me when you figure out what to do with Marah.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Hey, you guys going out?", "Shayne: Yeah. This girl gave me enough physical therapy to last for weeks.", "Marina: Oh, you can handle it.", "Shayne: Yeah? You know what, I should almost make you serve me dinner in bed.", "Marina: You know, they say that bed is only for two things: Sleeping and... (Laughs) ...not eating.", "Marah: Oh, my gosh.", "Marina: Did you solve your doll problem?", "Shayne: Doll problem?", "Marah: Uh, yeah, I put it away, out of sight, out of mind. You guys go, have a good time.", "Marina: We'll leave the diva to her designs.", "Marah: All right.", "Shayne: See you later.", "Marina: Bye.", "Marah: (Gasps) That is not where I put you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Did he go down all right?", "Gus: Yeah, it took half a story. Look at me. We don't do that again, okay?", "Harley: You were amazing with him. You were. I mean, it didn't matter how mad you were, how much you thought you were right, you dropped everything, and you gave him all of your love and attention.", "Gus: It's my job, right?", "Harley: You're not even his father. And I'm an idiot, because that's exactly why I fell in love with you in the first place. Because that's who you are. Even though I'm the only one who really gets to see that side of you most of the time. But I mean, that love that you showed him is the same love that you show me, and that you show Alan and that you're showing Phillip by being so good to him.", "Gus: Well, I don't know about all that.", "Harley: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what I do. I filter all of the Spaulding stuff through my own lens. I do. I admit that. But I... honey, I'm just so afraid, you know. You're hitching your wagon at these people. You have no idea, they are in it up to their...", "Gus: Listen, I know. Okay?", "Harley: You do?", "Gus: Yeah. Spaulding's a big company. It's overwhelming.", "Harley: But you can handle yourself.", "Gus: Yes, yes, I can handle myself.", "Harley: Then I'm just going to have to trust you. I mean, because we have to trust each other.", "Gus: ...Each other. Are we done? Please?", "Harley: I don't know. Did I say I'm sorry?", "Gus: Yes, I think you did.", "Harley: Because usually when I feel like we're done, I get this feeling...", "Gus: Yeah, the feeling.", "Harley: Mm-hmm.", "Gus: I know the feeling.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Well, forgive me, but there's still one obvious question here, Beth: Why do you care so much about Marah and me?", "Beth: Because I know what you're thinking. I know what I was thinking when I heard about you two.", "Jeffrey: Oh, what, that my feelings that I might or might not have border on illegality or perversion?", "Beth: Whoo, hold on. You're dating a younger woman. That's hardly new in the history of the world. Unorthodox, possibly deadly if her uncle or father find out. But Marah is a grown woman. I'm sure she can take care of herself.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: (Gasps)", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: (Sighs) Sorry. All right, let's see what kind of drug you really are.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Next on Guiding Light...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Olivia...", "Lizzie: Don't...", "Cassie: ...Happens...", "Lizzie: Just don't say her name in front of me, all right? She took advantage of my grandfather. She's ruined the chances of my parents ever getting back together, and she tried putting me away. And now this?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Marah, where are you? What's going on?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: You know what? Never mind. It's... it's no big deal. I just freaked out. It's my problem.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Beth: Well, what are you waiting for? Go to her."], "Transcript Author": ["By Boo Proofread By Hijrah"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAxkaWNYYDQ"}
