        "Since the agency that Jeffrey worked for won't help them, Josh calls in some computer programmers to hack into the system after Cassie worries that since Jeffrey posed as Richard on important events, he may have posed the day of their wedding. Tammy talks to Jeffrey and offers to talk to Cassie on his behalf. She also remembers a memory of her father that seemed unlike him and hints to Jeffrey that she thinks it was him. Later she tells Jonathan that she has gotten back into school and thanks him for what he did, not knowing it was Sandy who actually got her back in. Marina and Buzz return to Springfield and tell Ava and Sandy the news about Gus. Sandy offers his condolences and help. Jonathan seeing this warns Marina that Sandy is only out to get Tammy back. Sandy tells Jonathan about his new job helping sophomores like Tammy at school. Dinah tells Alan-Michael about Gus and then later comforts Mallet when he feels as if there is nothing he can do. Buzz asks Alan-Michael to continue helping Harley out at Spaulding and Harley later comes to talk to A-M. Realizing that although they were brothers they barely knew each other, she starts to talk to A-M about Gus. Marina sees them and later thanks A-M with a kiss and suggests he throws a Valentines day party to cheer Harley up, unknowing that that is the day he plans on overthrowing her from Spaulding."

    "Transcript": [
        "Cassie: April 18, 1999. 9:00 P.M. Reception for local business leaders. 7:30 dinner on the beach with Richard and the kids. April... you know it could've been none of these days, some of them, all of them.",
        "Josh: I'm sure not all, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Well, if Jeffrey was good, he could've impersonated Richard for long periods of time and I wouldn't even have known. July 14, 2000. Our wedding day. He said he only impersonated Richard at big public events. What was bigger and more public than the royal wedding?",
        "Josh: You know what? Don't do this to yourself, okay? Please.",
        "Cassie: Your agent friend gave us nothing, pretty much, except the feeling this may be a cover-up.",
        "Josh: Maybe.",
        "Cassie: But we have to keep going, Josh. I can't let this go, Josh. I'd like to, but I can't. It's my life. And it would be easier if... I really love him, Josh.",
        "Josh: I have another idea.",
        "Cassie: Okay, what's that?",
        "Josh: Well, where do you go when the government can't or won't give you the information that you want?",
        "Cassie: I have you right where I want you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Jeffrey? Jeffrey. Jeffrey. I wanted to talk to you about my mom. I guess she's probably already on your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Valentine's Day I'll be installed as permanent CEO at Spaulding. And Harley can go back to being a mom and a footnote in company history. A Valentine's Day massacre. Time to lay some ground work, got to run.",
        "Dinah: You're here, finally. Good.",
        "Alan-Michael: Nice to see you, too.",
        "Dinah: Were you at the Coopers?",
        "Alan-Michael: No, should I be?",
        "Dinah: You haven't heard?",
        "Alan-Michael: Heard what?",
        "Dinah: The F.B.I. found some personal effects they think belong to Gus.",
        "Alan-Michael: That's a good thing, right?",
        "Dinah: They were wedged in the ice on the lake. They think he's dead. He must have fallen through while looking for help, the same with your father.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh.",
        "Dinah: I know you weren't very close with your brother, and I know that you've been estranged from your father and I'm so sorry.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah. Poor Harley.",
        "Dinah: Well, at least she has her family with her. That's the main thing.",
        "Alan-Michael: Marina.",
        "Dinah: You know, I'm in crisis mode here as well. I...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Hi. Oh, weren't you supposed to be in Hawaii?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, uh... something happened.",
        "Marina: Gus...",
        "Sandy: Something happened with the search?",
        "Marina: There is no more search.",
        "Buzz: It's Gus. They found some of his things frozen in the lake, so they think he is dead.",
        "Ava: Are you sure?",
        "Buzz: It doesn't look good.",
        "Sandy: Marina, I'm sorry. If there is anything at all that I can do...",
        "Ava: Me, too.",
        "Marina: Thanks. I'm just glad to have people around right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Coop?",
        "Coop: Look, I'm fine, all right? I'm just freakin' fine. Look, leave it. Leave it. Please, Lizzie, just leave it alone. Please. Stop. I'm sorry. I'm just a little bit worried about Harley and I'm worried about you right now.",
        "Lizzie: You're worried about me?",
        "Coop: Yes, I'm worried about you. All right, you may have hated your grandfather for a lot of things he did, but I also know that you loved him-- Gus, too.",
        "Lizzie: You know, when we get off this plane, everything changes. Everything. But if we stay on here, and we stay on this side of the door... I just don't want to face everything out there.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, we can't. We can't stay here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: We don't even know if this is Gus' coat. You know, this coat could belong to anybody. It is not an unusual coat.",
        "Mallet: We can run a DNA test. What about the ring? Can you look at the ring and see if there is an inscription? Harley:( Sobbing ) I don't care, it's not true. It's not true. Listen to me. We don't know anything. There could be a million explanations for this. We don't know that he fell through the ice. We don't know anything.",
        "Mallet: This is not good, okay? It just doesn't look good. Denial is not going to change. I'm just saying, Harley, it's cold, okay? And I know he's trained in survival, but it's just.. it's cold. Its been cold for a long time, so maybe we should just start--",
        "Harley: Shut up! He's not dead. I don't care what you say. I don't care what the police say. I don't care what the F.B.I. Say. Gus is the only person who has always come through for me in my whole life. And he will come through for me again. I'm going to hold onto this, okay? Because he's going to want this back when he comes home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: I can't fathom how hard this is for your family.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, we just have to stick together right now. And that's how we get through this kind of stuff.",
        "Sandy: You're lucky to have each other.",
        "Marina: I know. I'll be back.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Marina: Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: So Sandy's back, huh?",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Jonathan: I mean sure, he's made some mistakes, but, hey, Sandy. Good old reliable Sandy, friend to all mankind.",
        "Marina: Are you saying this is just an act, like he's trying to win us over?",
        "Jonathan: It's working, isn't it?",
        "Marina: Jonathan, this is a guy who stood up for you in court, right, who kept you out of jail.",
        "Jonathan: He wants Tammy back. He'd do anything to get her back, including use her friends.",
        "Sandy: Is there a problem here, Marina?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I loved Richard, too, you know. I called him Dad.",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy, I would never disrespect your memories of Richard.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: And I would never disrespect your mother's memories of him, either.",
        "Tammy: She loves you, Jeffrey. But she has lost so much in her life. And that time with Richard was special, almost sacred.",
        "Jeffrey: It still is. It still is; nothing's changed. I know. She's dealing with a lot right now, Tammy, and she's doing it without you. And she's been the one constant in your life for the longest.",
        "Tammy: Is this the part where you ask me to work it out with her?",
        "Jeffrey: She loves you. I just know she would just love to spend sometime with you.",
        "Tammy: I could probably come by the farmhouse.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, let's do it.",
        "Tammy: Right now?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, right now, before you change your mind.",
        "Tammy: She hasn't called?",
        "Jeffrey: No, but you know what? I'm sure she's going to be home by the time we get there. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: \"We will be waiting.\" Excellent.",
        "Cassie: Okay, what's going on?",
        "Josh: All right, here's the deal. I read this piece a while back about two computer hackers who basically tried to shut down the Internet for a day.",
        "Cassie: Shut down the Internet?",
        "Josh: Yeah, the Internet, the whole thing. The world wide web, the hole deal.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Josh: Well, I assume because they wanted to prove that they could do it. And they came pretty close, actually, but the good thing is, they didn't get caught. See, these are just a couple of loose cannons, you know, like geeky hackers, that kind of thing.",
        "Cassie: So how did you find them?",
        "Josh: Bill caught them trying to break into Lewis. So, of course, we hired them to keep an eye on our security, you know, the network and all.",
        "Cassie: Makes sense.",
        "Josh: And now I'm going to ask them to basically hack into a government program that will give us the information we're looking for, hopefully, about Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Cassie: Okay, isn't that a crime?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Cassie: Josh Lewis, outlaw. I think I'm corrupting you.",
        "Josh: So are you in?",
        "Cassie: Absolutely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Can I tell you something without you running away?",
        "Lizzie: I don't think I have a choice because you're squeezing me pretty tight?",
        "Coop: Look, like I said you have just changed my life.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Coop.",
        "Coop: Look, I'm just saying more importantly, you've changed yours, you really have. All right, look, I know it's not easy, I mean, ignoring that whole Spaulding thing. You could've wasted your life spending loads of money jet- setting around with losers like that Finn guy. You didn't, you tried to run a company, and you got a job.",
        "Lizzie: My mom cut me off.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Yes, she certainly did. But you know what, you didn't fold. All right, you became this independent person. You're your own person now, and you don't have to answer to anybody, and you certainly don't owe anybody anything. All right? I'll admit, you know, I had my doubts...",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Coop. I'm not really independent. I'm not strong. I couldn't really do it. I don't really have a job. I lied. I always lie. The only thing I proved is what a fraud I am and how much I hate work.",
        "Coop: I'm just really proud of you.",
        "Lizzie: Well, if you say I'm amazing, then I guess I'm amazing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: You know, I can probably say something here to smooth everything over, but I'm too tired. Sandy, Jonathan says that I shouldn't trust you with your offer to help my family.",
        "Sandy: I guess I shouldn't be surprised. He still thinks I'm after his girlfriend.",
        "Tammy: Well, are you?",
        "Jonathan: What do you think, Officer? You recognize a delusional psychopath when you see one?",
        "Sandy: Marina, all I care about is what you think. And if you want me to go, I'm gone. But if I can help in any way, from flipping burgers to being someone to talk to, I'm there.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, come on! Bring on the tears, Sandbag! You can do it!",
        "Marina: Jonathan! Look, I've known Sandy for a long time and he's made his mistakes; everyone has. But he has always been a really good friend to me. And right now, I can use all of the friends I can get. Now you'll excuse me, I'm going to go help Ava.",
        "Jonathan: They'll catch on to you sooner or later.",
        "Sandy: Keep telling yourself if that makes you feel better. The more paranoid you are, the better I look. Oh, by the way, did I mention that I'm working for the Dean at the \"U\"? I didn't, did I? They need a new sophomore class advisor. Wouldn't it be great if Tammy was an incoming sophomore?",
        "Jonathan: Stay away from her.",
        "Sandy: That's out of my hands. But if you have a problem with it, why don't you talk to the Dean, your good buddy, the Dean. You did such a good job of it last time, didn't you?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Keep pushing me. You'll see what happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Cassie? Cassie? Hmm. Well, I know that R.J is with Mrs. Chitwood, so...",
        "Tammy: She's probably not here, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Well that's okay, we can hang out. I miss being here.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, great. Tammy, you seem pretty cool with everything. You don't seem angry or upset that I impersonated Richard.",
        "Tammy: Well, the way I see it, you put your life on the line to protect my father. Richard was the only dad I ever really knew. And he never failed me. He was my father and a prince.",
        "Jeffrey: That he was.",
        "Tammy: You know, I was thinking about this time when we were living in San Cristobel. I came home from school crying because these kids were picking on me. They were jealous. I expected my dad to tell me to be proud and not lower myself to their level.",
        "Jeffrey: I guess some fights you've got to walk away from, you know.",
        "Tammy: He didn't tell me to do that, though. He gave me the best advice. He said, \"Go up to the biggest bully on that playground, the one you're most afraid of, and get right up in her face and stare her down, and make the rest of the kids on that playground respect you. And then if that doesn't work, always throw the first punch.\" He even showed me how to throw one.",
        "Jeffrey: Wow, he showed you how to throw a punch; he's quite a guy.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, it was so not like him, though. He was very old-fashioned, and he liked to call me Lady Tammy. I remember thinking, \"is this really my dad?\" I still wonder about that sometimes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Here we go. Hi there. My name is...",
        "Woman: Joshua Lewis, president of Lewis Construction, Lewis Oil, brother-in- law to...",
        "Man: Princess Cassie Winslow, formally San Cristobel, now part owner of Beacon hotel.",
        "Cassie: And your names would be?",
        "Woman: Boho 5.",
        "Cassie: That's cute.",
        "Man: Skywalker.",
        "Cassie: Should have guessed that one.",
        "Boho 5: Josh, you have a lot of money and resources, so why do you need us?",
        "Josh: First of all, you're the best at what you do, right? And, you get away with a lot. And that's a good thing.",
        "Sky walker: What do you want us to get away with?",
        "Josh: Well, your mission, actually is quite simple. Hide yourselves from that great government security system in the sky, right? Crack the C.I.A. computer system and extract information. Excuse me.",
        "Boho 5: Oh, is that all?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Scared, huh?",
        "Sky walker: We'd be stupid not to be scared, so this better be on the level.",
        "Boho 5: Because if it's not...",
        "Skywalker: Then the only thing we're going to hack is the two of you. Bye-bye, credit rating.",
        "Boho 5: What's next?",
        "Cassie: What the hell have you gotten us into?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hey, come on in. Have you seen Harley? How is she?",
        "Mallet: Ah, it's bad, it's bad.",
        "Dinah: At least she has her family near her and you.",
        "Mallet: I'm trying to do whatever I can. Sometimes I'm not the best shoulder to cry on, you know. I'm not the best say the right thing kind of guy.",
        "Dinah: Sweetie, you don't have to do all of that.",
        "Mallet: I just want to fix things, you know. I'm always trying to fix things. Of course, I blow it all to hell and say the wrong thing and Harley runs off. I just wanted to come by and I wanted to-- I don't know. I've got to go to the station. I've got caseloads to do.",
        "Dinah: You know what, sweetie, it can wait?",
        "Mallet: No, it can't.",
        "Dinah: It can wait.",
        "Mallet: No, it can't. I've got to pick up the slack for Gus, okay? I've got to do something. Dinah, what are you doing?",
        "Dinah: Take this off. Take this off. I'm trying to get you relaxed and out of these cold clothes so you don't go hypothermic on me, okay. And we're going to do it my way. I'm going to get you into a nice warm robe. I'm going to get you something to eat.",
        "Mallet: Dinah, have you heard anything I've said? I don't need anything, okay? Harley is the one who is suffering.",
        "Dinah: She's not the only one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: There's news about Gus.",
        "Alan-Michael: I heard. I'm sorry.",
        "Buzz: He was your brother.",
        "Alan-Michael: I wish I had known him a little better. He seemed like a good guy.",
        "Buzz: Alan is still-- I mean there's no word.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah.",
        "Buzz: About Harley, she's going to need all of the help she can get. We can handle it on the home front, but you know, as far as Spaulding goes, can you take any pressure off of her...",
        "Harley: Alan-Michael, great, I've been looking for you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley, I was just telling your father how sorry I am about Gus.",
        "Harley: Thank you. I've been looking over the quarterlies for the engineering department, and we've got to get those earnings up. So if you have no opinion...",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley, do you really want to talk business?",
        "Harley: What else is there to talk about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky Paul Golden, inside \"The Light\". The thing that helps me get through the day at \"Guiding Light\" is my crew. All of the boys. On the longest days of work, I have a little tiki bar set up on the roof of CBS. Don't tell anybody at CBS. My message to the viewers is that I wouldn't really have any of this without them, so from become of my heart, thank you. See Gus February 1st inside \"The Light\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So Richard didn't seem like himself that day?",
        "Tammy: The day he showed me the right spot on the chin to knock somebody down, not so much. Does it sound like princely advice to you?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I didn't really know him well enough to say whether that sounded like him.",
        "Tammy: It was good advice, though.",
        "Jeffrey: So did you have to punch someone?",
        "Tammy: No. The stare-down worked like a charm. She backed right off, just like you-- Richard said you would. It's getting kind of late. I should probably get going. I'll call later. I'll probably catch Mom then.",
        "Jeffrey: We would really-- I mean she would love that. Tammy...",
        "Tammy: I'm not wasting my time trying to work things out with my mom, am I? Is there even a chance?",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy, one thing I know there's always a chance.",
        "Tammy: Even though she's not budging at all when it comes to Jonathan?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, for your mom, Jonathan-- well, Jonathan's that bully on the playground, and this is her version of the stare-down.",
        "Tammy: He loves me. I know he's not perfect.",
        "Jeffrey: I know. Who is? Who is?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. For what it's worth, I hope you guys work this out.",
        "Jeffrey: Right back at you. And I think Richard would probably tell you to not give up. So I think I'm going to tell you the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Okay. Guys, look. Don't tell me you're going to pass up an unlimited budget and the chance at a hack of the lifetime here.",
        "Skywalker: Why do you want to hack into the agency anyway?",
        "Josh: Look, you already know that Cassie was the princess of San Cristobel, right?",
        "Boho 5: You led a revolution.",
        "Cassie: And there is information jacket on me at the C.I.A., but some tapes regarding my late husband are missing.",
        "Skywalker: Assuming they've all been archived, I'll find them for you.",
        "Josh: Yeah. You just have to get inside their server, right?",
        "Boho 5: And once you're in there, you're breaking like a billion felonies.",
        "Josh: Not if you don't get caught.",
        "Sky walker and boho 5: Indeed.",
        "Cassie: So do we have a deal?",
        "Boho 5: You just bought your way into the matrix.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Are you all right?",
        "Harley: It's hard.",
        "Buzz: We have to talk about what we saw at the crash sight.",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley, I spoke with Dinah. She said that Gus was going to be presumed...",
        "Harley: Yeah, I know what they're saying.",
        "Buzz: Honey, no one wants to face the fact that maybe he's gone.",
        "Harley: Well, let's not talk about it.",
        "Buzz: I'm the last person to tell you give up hope.",
        "Harley: Then don't tell me to do it.",
        "Buzz: Honey, with the news we got, we have to make plans.",
        "Harley: I just think we're going to feel incredibly stupid burying the guy and then he shows up a week later.",
        "Buzz: Then I'd be happy feeling stupid. For the kids' sake... ( phone ringing ) Would someone answer the damn phone? Wait here.",
        "Harley: You know what occurred to me? That you're his brother, and you didn't even know him.",
        "Alan-Michael: I like what I've seen so far.",
        "Harley: The thing to remember is he was always the funniest guy in the room. He had these sides, these comments that he would always make under his breath-- it was so funny, unless he wanted you to hear it, and he then he'd blow the doors off. But he was kind. I think people missed that part. You know he was... he was always very kind to me. I do this now, you know. I talk about him sometimes like he is already dead.",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley it's okay.",
        "Harley: And then I reduce him further by saying, \"Oh, he was this. No, but he wasn't this, he was this.\" He was all of this. He was everything.",
        "Alan-Michael: We're going to get through this, Harley, together, as a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hey, there he is. Are you feeling better?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Warmer.",
        "Dinah: Sit.",
        "Mallet: Dinah, Dinah, it is okay. I don't need anything. I'm fine.",
        "Dinah: Sweetie, you lost your partner today. You're whole world has been turned upside down.",
        "Mallet: No, Harley's was. I'm fine. I don't matter.",
        "Dinah: Don't pretend that her pain is not affecting you. I know it is, and don't try to pretend it is not there, especially for my sake.",
        "Mallet: You should have seen her face.",
        "Dinah: I know.",
        "Mallet: I just didn't see this coming. I just figured he'd show up, you know. He's a scrappy pain in the butt.",
        "Dinah: I know.",
        "Mallet: He ended up being a pretty good partner. I kind of got to the point where I could count on him. Like I count on you. I do. I count on you.",
        "Dinah: No one's ever said that to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: So you guys will contact us when you have got something.",
        "Skywalker: Make sure you don't try to call us, they can trace any cell call, any call or an e-mail.",
        "Boho 5: Unless we're in a secure room.",
        "Josh: Okay, but you guys don't get all excited and start telling your friends about what you're doing here, okay?",
        "Skywalker: Do we look that stupid?",
        "Josh: Well...",
        "Cassie: Those guys are freaks.",
        "Josh: This is sort of a last-ditch effort.",
        "Cassie: Are you sure we can trust them?",
        "Josh: I think so. They may hack into our cable bills just for fun, but I think they're okay.",
        "Cassie: They're trying to feel sneaky and desperate.",
        "Josh: If you want to call it off, it is not too late.",
        "Cassie: No. I want to know the truth. But the way we're going about it now, I'm starting to feel like... like him.",

        "Buzz: Stay here tonight, okay? I'll set up your room.",
        "Sandy: And then this thing happens. Basically right after they finish running for their lives.",
        "Ava: I had no idea this town was so full of drama.",
        "Coop: Ava, how is it going?",
        "Ava: Everything's fine here. How are you?",
        "Coop: I could be better, but, you know, what can you do about that?",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry for you and your family, Coop.",

        "Ava: I guess.",
        "Lizzie: Does that mean you're getting back together? I'm sorry, I don't mean to be nosey. Are you going to take another plunge at it. You're really lucky that he is still single.",
        "Ava: You don't have to be so obvious.",
        "Lizzie: Obvious about what?",
        "Ava: I'm not after Coop.",
        "Lizzie: I never said you were.",
        "Ava: What I find funny is you like Coop and he likes you, and everybody knows you're together, so why are you so nervous about holding onto him?",

        "Tammy: Ask me if I care? Okay? Okay, I care a little bit.",
        "Jonathan: I don't want it always to be like this, Tammy. People won't always be trying to break us apart.",

        "Jonathan: We'll work on it.",
        "Tammy: I tried this morning. Jeffrey and I went to the farmhouse, but my mom wasn't there. Well, maybe when she finds out you talked to the Dean and got me sent back to the university.",

        "Tammy: We'll never know because I didn't have to get myself back in.",
        "Jonathan: What?",

        "Ava: Don't play me like that, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Why would I play you?",
        "Ava: Anybody can see that. I wouldn't want you walking around feeling all paranoid and nervous and guilty, now, would I?",
        "Coop: Hey, what is all that?",
        "Ava: Oh, nothing. How are you doing?",
        "Coop: Well, things are never going to be the same again, but you just got to keep going, I guess. Look, I just wanted to say it is really great to have you here.",
