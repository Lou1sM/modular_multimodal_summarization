        "Lizzie: Hey, Quinn, it's Lizzie. Listen, I was wondering if maybe we could get together, hangout, you know. And maybe you could bring a little extra cash-- just some pocket money. Roxy and I really need to go to the spa.",
        "Ava: \"Bella Boutique\", ah. Do you work there?",
        "Woman: Better than that, I own it.",
        "Coop: Really? Hey, Lizzie, look who's here. I have to tell you, Lizzie loves working for you.",
        "Woman: Lizzie who?",
        "Ava: Lizzie. I thought you said you own the shop.",
        "Woman: I do.",
        "Ava: Then why don't you know the name of your own employee?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: The money that I wired to the Caymen account, did it arrive? Okay, excellent. Now when can I expect to get some information on Jeffrey? ( Knock on the door ) Just a second. Hi, come on in. Okay, I'm back. Yes. Okay, fine, I will get you that information as quickly as possible. Yeah. Oh, thank you. You live long and prosper, too. Yeah, bye. Sorry about that.",
        "Olivia: That's all right.",
        "Josh: Just sort of a business thing. You know, a potential client, preliminary conversation. What's in the bag?",
        "Olivia: So what did they say about Jeffrey and/or Richard?",
        "Josh: Drink?",
        "Olivia: Oh, the divert her with a drink trick. Works on me every time.",
        "Josh: We've got little bottles of vodka over here. I've got some scotch. What do you want?",
        "Olivia: Uh... a finger of scotch, neat.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Olivia: So, you take care of everyone you love, don't you?",
        "Josh: I try to, yep.",
        "Olivia: And you take care of all of their wants and needs, but what about what you need?",
        "Josh: What I need?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. I mean do you even know? Because I do. I know exactly what you need, Josh Lewis.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Josh: So what do I need? Ice skates.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Oh. It just doesn't look good. Denial's not going to change that.",
        "Frank: Oh, good, Mallet. You saved me a phone call, man. I need you to come by the station tomorrow.",
        "Mallet: Frank, I'm on leave, don't you remember? I took myself off the roster to help Harley find Gus.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well I'm a little short-staffed right, so I need you to come in so I can pair you up with a new partner.",
        "Mallet: What is in that box, Frank? Huh?",
        "Frank: It's Gus' personal stuff. I came to give it to Harley, but I don't think she is ready for it yet. Hey, listen, about that new partner...",
        "Mallet: Frank, I have a partner. His name is Gus Aitoro.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I'll have one more--no, make that two. Time to make a toast.",
        "Gus: Sounds good to me.",
        "Harley: Here you are. How about that?",
        "Gus: What are we drinking to?",
        "Harley: Um... I don't know. No, I do know. Let's drink to you.",
        "Gus: Me, I'm flattered. I'll tell you what, we'll drink to me...",
        "Man: And then when we're done, we'll drink to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry. Frank, hey, I'm sorry.",
        "Frank: It's all right, Mallet. I'm in a bad place, too, man. If I let the police station fall apart, then I'm a bad Chief. If I admit to Harley that Gus is dead, then I'm a bad big brother. Harley is in total denial. She will not accept the fact that Gus is dead, man. Now, her behavior is understandable; yours, however, I'm not so sure...",
        "Mallet: Listen, if there's a slight chance Gus is still out there, I'm going to keep looking for him, man. I owe it to your sister. And I'm going to do that, Frank, okay?",
        "Frank: Mallet, the feds have determined there is no way Gus could still be alive in subfreezing temperatures for all that time, man. Especially if he went in the water. Now that's a fact.",
        "Mallet: The logical part of my brain says, \"Yeah, you're probably right, Frank.\" But you know what? Harley is just so sure that Gus made it. Listen, man, she's got good instincts, right? I mean, if she's that convinced, then I'm that convinced.",
        "Frank: Mallet, do you really think Gus is still alive? Then answer me this: We know how much Gus loves Harley, right? Then how could he possibly stay away from Harley for all this time? What could keep him away?",
        "Mallet: Nothing. Nothing would keep him away from Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You don't look too bad, you know that?",
        "Gus: No, you look pretty good yourself. In fact, you look pretty damn good.",
        "Harley: I meant considering everything you've been through these last few weeks. It's beyond freezing out there, you know.",
        "Gus: Yeah that's... true, it's cold. At least it's warm in here.",
        "Harley: I love this song. Oh. Don't you?",
        "Man: Yeah, sure.",
        "Harley: Dance we me, come on.",
        "Gus: I'm too tired there are days just too tired...",
        "Harley: That better?",
        "Gus: Much.",
        "Harley: I've missed you so much. Promise me you won't leave me again, okay, Gus, promise?",
        "Man: Sure, promise. You can call me whatever you want. I like the way you move.",
        "Harley: Well, listen to you.",
        "Man: Listen to me. ( Laughter )",
        "Harley: I think you're just trying to get me into bed.",
        "Man: Hey, listen, I was just...",
        "Harley: No, no, no. It just might work.",
        "Man: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: These are lovely and they're sharp, but I'm not sure that I see--",
        "Olivia: Did you forget that Lewis built the Beacon a lovely ice rink out back? And it opens tomorrow to the public. I thought that maybe we could christen it tonight, the two of us.",
        "Josh: I see. You skate?",
        "Olivia: I am very good. My figure 8s are perfectly curved.",
        "Josh: Yes they are.",
        "Olivia: And what about you? Can you keep up with me?",
        "Josh: I think so. I actually used to play hockey in high school, so... I still don't understand exactly why you feel the need to do this.",
        "Olivia: No, I don't. I don't need anything from you, okay? I just thought maybe we could hit the ice, maybe come in and have a little drink by the fire, you know, just enjoy each other. Fun, you know, fun?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I vaguely remember fun.",
        "Olivia: See, that's the problem. That's why I'm suggesting this. Here.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Olivia: I mean you are so great taking care of everyone else, but when was the last time you did something purely because it made you happy, huh? Something just for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: How can you not know Lizzie? Elizabeth Spaulding. She works for you.",
        "Woman: Well, of course I know Elizabeth. She's my best employee. I had no idea that everybody called you Lizzie, honey.",
        "Lizzie: Uh... yeah.",
        "Woman: Next time you ask me about one of my employees, get her name straight. You're friends are so adorable. Why don't you bring them into the shop sometime?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, sure, okay, boss. I take it you guys already met?",
        "Coop: No, not really.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well this is my boyfriend, Coop. And this is Ava. This is my boss, um... Hannah Salon",
        "Hannah: So nice to meet you, Coop. Elizabeth's told me so much about you when she's not running around the store like a demon. She's my top sales associate. But you knew that, right?",
        "Coop: No, I didn't.",
        "Hannah: She didn't tell you that she was employee of the month for January?",
        "Coop: You were?",
        "Hannah: I am so lucky to have her.",
        "Lizzie: Well, you know, you're such a great boss, Hannah. And I love working there. I mean, the shop's great.",
        "Coop: Oh, please, come on. She loves the employee discount is what she loves. She's always buying stuff from there, spending all of the money that she should be saving on things there.",
        "Hannah: Well, girl's got to indulge herself once in a while.",
        "Ava: Lizzie bought me the most gorgeous handbag. And I'm sure she spent much too much money on it-- even with her discount.",
        "Lizzie: I told you not to worry about that, Ava.",
        "Ava: No, I do. I mean it was extremely generous. And to be honest with you, I don't feel comfortable accepting it. Would it be possible for me to return it for something and you can credit Lizzie's account.",
        "Hannah: Sure, if that's what the two of you really want.",
        "Lizzie: It's not.",
        "Ava: I do. Liz, thanks.",
        "Hannah: Well it has been so lovely meeting you. Coop, Ava. I've got to get back to the shop to close up. And what do I owe you for this?",
        "Coop: This-- no, please. It's on the house; don't even worry about it. Just get home safe. And I have to say that it was very nice meeting you.",
        "Hannah: You, too. And Elizabeth, remember you're opening in the morning.",
        "Lizzie: Right. I'll see you then.",
        "Hannah: Bye, sweetie.",
        "Coop: You never told me that your boss was so nice. ( Lizzie laughs nervously ) Ava, tell you what, can you manage the espresso bar for just a minute? I have to run back to Company and get some extra sugar.",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: Good. I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Ava: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: ( Laughing ) Oh, geez, you can thank me later for this one, Elizabeth. Quinn to the rescue again. How many times does that make it? Well, you owe me big, young lady. And how, how, how am I going to collect?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Ice skates, a lovely gesture really...",
        "Olivia: No gesture, it's an invitation.",
        "Josh: And I appreciate that, I do, but...",
        "Olivia: But you'd rather give Cassie a call, maybe see how's she's doing. Go over to her house, help her screw in a light bulb, or oil something that's squeaky.",
        "Josh: Ouch.",
        "Olivia: She has Jeffrey for that, okay? I know you don't trust him completely, but it's not your problem. It's hers. You want to know what your problem is? I mean, your one and only flaw? You are two damn nice.",
        "Josh: Nice is bad?",
        "Olivia: Nice is great to a certain point. Then it's just a turnoff, Josh.",
        "Josh: I see. You know, you should really just say what's on your mind. Don't hold back here at all.",
        "Olivia: You want me to tell what I see happening here?",
        "Josh: I'm not sure.",
        "Olivia: Okay, listen to me. You're one of the most standup guys I know. When someone has a problem, you're right there to help them. You have taken care of Reva and Shayne and Marah for so many years so well and now, you and Reva are separated. Your kids are living abroad, and who do you have to take care of? I know, your sister-in-law.",
        "Josh: It's not really that simple, okay.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Okay. Okay. What about this: What if-- go crazy here-- you didn't call Cassie tonight. What if you let her handle this Jeffrey situation all by herself?",
        "Josh: I know this one. I would have more time to ice skate with you?",
        "Olivia: And would that be so awful?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Olivia: You have to keep a part of yourself separate to have fun, to flirt, to take pleasure in life. That's you taking care of you. That's you putting yourself first, and it's healthy. And it is essential, because without that, who are you really? I mean, you're just sort of a shadow of yourself?",
        "Josh: You're very well-shrunk.",
        "Olivia: I listen to a lot of talk radio in the car.",
        "Josh: And this is really what you think?",
        "Olivia: Yes, but I do have an ulterior motive. I just want to spend the night with you. I want you all to myself.",
        "Josh: Okay, all right. I have to go and do something and then I'll be back. Is there any chance at all that you'll still be here later?",
        "Olivia: Sure.",
        "Josh: Because when I get back, I intend to skate circles around you.",
        "Olivia: I'd like that! ( Laughs )",
        "Billy: You uh.... you setting the mood here?",
        "Olivia: How long have you been standing there, Billy?",
        "Billy: I think you're disoriented; this is my brother's room.",
        "Harley: I now, Josh ran out. I'm waiting for him to come back.",
        "Billy: Oh, well you're here to spread some rose pedals and run a bubble bath?",
        "Olivia: Props really aren't my thing.",
        "Billy: You know, I've got a question for you. I'm just wondering. Were you always after Josh or was that kind of an after- thought after Bill dumped you?",
        "Olivia: This is none of your business.",
        "Billy: It is my business, see, because I'm the guy you pushed off the wagon to get here. Olivia, if you knew what you wanted all along, I wish you have just gone for it because you could have saved me and my boy a whole lot of heartache.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: I'm not in denial about Gus, okay, Frank? I'm not. I just like to cross my I's and cross my T's. I'm very thorough. Until I do that, it's just not official for me.",
        "Frank: Do you think you can do that while you're back on the job?",
        "Mallet: Frank, that is like saying you think...",
        "Frank: Gus is dead. He is, okay? And he left my sister a widow, and that's a fact.",
        "Mallet: That's a fact, Frank?",
        "Frank: Will you snap out of it, Mallet? It's not like you guys were best friends or anything. Come on. You didn't even like each other?",
        "Mallet: Who said I didn't like him? I mean, I just got used to hearing his stupid jokes and hearing about his stupid ulcer and how he is a much better cop than me. You know I always used to think to myself all of the time, \"Aitoro, you're such an idiot.\" Then I started thinking, I kind of see what Harley likes about him. I started to get that, you know. It's too soon to give up, Frank. It's too soon for a new partner.",
        "Frank: All right, then how about this for a compromise, okay? You put your badge back on, you fly solo for a while, and then when you're ready for a new partner you just let me know. Is that fair enough?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, that's fair. Thanks.",
        "Frank: All right, but don't wait too long, because the sooner we help Harley deal with reality, the better off she'll be. Now if you want to do Gus a favor, then help Harley. Help Harley move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hmmm, this is nice.",
        "Gus: I'm not complaining or anything, but the music stopped a half hour ago.",
        "Harley: I hadn't noticed. ( Laughter ) what does that say about us?",
        "Gus: It says we don't need any music. We make our own music. We're that good together.",
        "Jimmy: How about we continue this party someplace more private? Just the two of us.",
        "Harley: Ah. I thought you'd never ask.",
        "Jimmy: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ricky Paul Golden, inside \"The Light\". I'm a perfectionist, maybe too much, where it really drives everybody crazy. Well let me start over. Ask me again, I'm sorry. Wait, I want to tell you another one of my favorite moments. Let me say that again. Say the same thing. But anyway, can you ask me again? No, let me start over. See Gus, Wednesday, February 1st, inside \"The Light\".",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Oh, I left my car keys.",
        "Jimmy: We'll come back and get them later.",
        "Harley: No, because I need them now.",
        "Gus: No you don't, it's not like you'll be driving or anything.",
        "Harley: Well I'm not going to let you drive in your condition. Come on, it will just take a second.",
        "Jimmy: Later.",
        "Harley: Do you really think you can tell me to do something I don't want you to do?",
        "Gus: Look at me. I don't even want to let you out of my sight.",
        "Harley: The sooner you do, the sooner we can leave.",
        "Jimmy: Let's talk about that in the car.",
        "Harley: No. Because I don't want to go. I'm serious; I don't want to go.",
        "Jimmy: Let's talk about it in the car.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Jimmy: It's fine.",
        "Mallet: Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here.",
        "Harley: No way. It's Hammer. It's the Hammer! Hey, would you tell this guy that I need my keys, please?",
        "Mallet: She needs her keys.",
        "Harley: Thank you. Oh, I have them. ( Laughing ) Sorry. Let's go. Let's leave.",
        "Mallet: No, I don't... I don't think so. You need to find another date, okay? She's taken.",
        "Jimmy: Yeah, that's my thought exactly.",
        "Mallet: My thought is you need to find yourself another date. If I have to tell you a third time, it won't be pretty. Huh? Huh? A little of this and a little of that. What do you think?",
        "Jimmy: She's probably just going to pass out on you anyway?",
        "Harley: No way. Oh, no. Don't leave. No, don't go. Let go of me.",
        "Mallet: Stop, stop, stop.",
        "Harley: We were going home.",
        "Mallet: I'm sure you were. Have you been-- a little drinky drinky?",
        "Harley: I was going home, okay?",
        "Mallet: Sure you were.",
        "Harley: Mallet, I want to go home.",
        "Mallet: Okay. All right, come on, let's go home. I'll take care of you. I got you, easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Cassie, boy, it's really weird to say this on your voicemail. In fact, I'm at Company, and I thought I might find you there. But here goes. This project that we've been working on, you don't really need me to help you anymore, right? I mean I put you in contact with those people, and whatever answers you get from here on in, you should probably get those in private. So, um... so, um... I'm going to back off now and leave you to move forward on your own. Okay? Okay. So good night, Cassie. Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: We're back to that night, are we? I thought that was in the past?",
        "Billy: No, it may be past you, but I live with what you did every day.",
        "Olivia: You know, I thought in AA, they teach you to take responsibility for your own actions. I have tried to do that, Billy, okay? I said to you so many times how sorry I am for what I did to you. Beyond that, I don't know what else to do.",
        "Billy: It's a pretty interesting point of view.",
        "Olivia: What's on your mind, Billy?",
        "Billy: Oh, I was just thinking about how much you want to get your claws back into my little brother, and how little he would have to do with you if he knew that you were the one who switched those drinks on me.",
        "Olivia: Is that a threat?",
        "Billy: Is that a threat? Well, that's kind of interesting, too, because you see, in AA they not only teach you that you have to take responsibility for your actions, but they also say you have to forgive those who done you wrong, even a low-life like you. So, sober Billy has been going to all of the meetings like a good boy, and I guess he just would have to let this one slide.",
        "Olivia: Well, if you don't mind...",
        "Billy: I said a sober Billy. Now if I fall off the wagon, then my evil twin shows up and there's no telling what comes out of my mind. So, if I were you, from here on in, I think I'd just be a good girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What did you do?",
        "Quinn: It's simple, I just saved your beautiful, little...",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. What did you do to get that woman to lie about me?",
        "Quinn: Oh, Hannah. She's your new boss. Hannah Salon. You really got to keep these things straight.",
        "Lizzie: Answer the question.",
        "Quinn: Hannah's a friend of the family. I had a little chat with her and I told her to tell anybody that asks that you work for her and that she adores you. And all you have to do is buy some clothes from her. I thought it was a pretty fair exchange, to be honest with you.",
        "Lizzie: It's weird, though.",
        "Quinn: What, that she would cover for you?",
        "Lizzie: No, I mean, that she would come on a day that I'm here and Coop and Ava are on shift.",
        "Quinn: Well, what's so weird about that?",
        "Lizzie: I mean, it's not like she's been here before, I don't think. So is this just a coincidence, or do you think somebody lured her over here so they could trip me up.",
        "Quinn: Who would do such a thing, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Somebody who wants my boyfriend.",
        "Quinn: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Take it easy. There we go.",
        "Harley: Ooh, this room is spinning. You were supposed to bring me home.",
        "Mallet: Well, that was the plan, but I didn't know if you wanted your kids to see you like this, so, it's a backup plan.",
        "Harley: All right. I'm perfectly like this.",
        "Mallet: You are... you are just fine. Since you were unable to put one foot in front of the other-- sometimes that happens when a person drinks large quantities of... of... Cooper? All right. Boy, come on. I'll get you tucked in here.",
        "Harley: Ah. You're tucking me in?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Harley: That's neat. You're sweet.",
        "Mallet: Thank you.",
        "Harley: And I missed you. And I love you. I love you, Gus.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: I don't think that Ava knows that you've been lying about working at Bella.",
        "Lizzie: Well I'm sure she's suspicious. Maybe that's why she wants to figure out some way to out me in front of Coop.",
        "Quinn: That's quite a theory.",
        "Lizzie: Well she likes him. She would love to have him to herself.",
        "Quinn: What is it about this guy that everyone falls for him?",
        "Lizzie: You've got a few hours? Actually, you know what? You don't; you've got to go.",
        "Quinn: No I don't.",
        "Lizzie: Yes you do. Because Ava's right there and she's already suspicious, so bye-bye. You've got to go.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Lizzie: Hey.",
        "Coop: You miss me?",
        "Lizzie: You know it. Are you almost done?",
        "Coop: Yeah, I'm almost done. I've got to run to the ATM, make a quick deposit and then I'm done.",
        "Lizzie: Great. Okay, I'll take this for you and then we can go home. I want to go home where we can be alone.",
        "Coop: Hmmm, some motivation. I'm on it. I'll be right back.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Ava: So that's your boss. She seems nice.",
        "Lizzie: Yep, she is.",
        "Ava: I hope I didn't embarrass you about the handbag thing. I just, you know...",
        "Lizzie: No, you didn't.",
        "Ava: I really like it. I do.",
        "Lizzie: You know, we've talked about this handbag so many times. If you just want to return it, return it.",
        "Ava: So Hannah must be pretty wild at the boutique?",
        "Lizzie: I guess.",
        "Ava: Well, yeah, I mean the gift you gave me was gorgeous.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I had a discount.",
        "Ava: Yeah, I know, but I mean even after the discount...",
        "Lizzie: Are we talking about the bag again?",
        "Ava: Yeah, right, I'm sorry. What kind of hours are you working at the boutique?",
        "Lizzie: What do you care?",
        "Ava: I'm just curious, that's all.",
        "Lizzie: But why?",
        "Ava: Because maybe someday-- when I don't want to be a waitress anymore-- I might want to get a job at a hot boutique e like Bella. And I'm just curious how much I might get paid to work in a place like that. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.",
        "Lizzie: No, I'm sorry for snapping at you. I was just...",
        "Ava: Just what?",
        "Lizzie: I don't know. I felt like you were like grilling me, trying to trip me up or something.",
        "Ava: To trip you up about what?",
        "Lizzie: I didn't mean that. I don't know what I was saying, I'm sorry.",
        "Ava: Well, I mean, how could I trip you up on something unless you had something to hide?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I'm not hiding anything.",
        "Ava: No?",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Ava: Huh. And you're sure about that? Maybe that would explain why you were acting the way you were earlier this evening, why you're so worried about losing Coop. I mean if you're keeping something important from him and he finds out, well that wouldn't be a very good thing and that would certainly drive him away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I hope you do stay sober, Billy.",
        "Billy: I'm sure you do.",
        "Olivia: No, not because I'm afraid you're going to tell people what I-- you know what, yeah, that's a part of it. That's a part of it. But you know what? I hope you stay sober for you. Because I feel terrible about what I did to you, okay? I didn't know what the fallout was going to be!",
        "Billy: Yes, you did. You just didn't give a hoot. At that moment, you only wanted what you wanted. I know that feeling because that's what I feel every time I look at a bottle.",
        "Olivia: You want to punish me? You do and I can't stop you. But don't punish Josh.",
        "Billy: Oh, how would wising Josh up to your antics be punishing him? Oh, I get it. I'd be depriving him of your company, is that it?",
        "Olivia: He knows who I am.",
        "Billy: Uh-huh.",
        "Olivia: He's a grown man. Why don't you let him make his own choices?",
        "Billy: I see, just... see him walk towards the cliff and just let him walk right over it.",
        "Olivia: Like I said, you want to punish me, do it, Billy! But you might want to be careful, okay. Because to Josh helping him might be like you mettling in his life. And that's something that would really tick Josh off.",
        "Josh: What would really tick Josh off?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I'm not hiding anything from Coop.",
        "Ava: Then, why are you so upset?",
        "Lizzie: You wouldn't understand.",
        "Ava: Try me.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Well, first off, they think my uncle Gus is dead, who I happen to love very much. That means there's a chance that my grandfather could be dead, too. And Coop is worried about Harley because she is freaked out, and I'm worried about him, and here you are accusing me of-- I don't even know what.",
        "Ava: I'm not accusing you of anything. If it seemed that way, I'm sorry.",
        "Lizzie: You know what, I'm sorry, too. I was being mean to you, telling you that you liked Coop, when it's obvious that, that is not true.",
        "Coop: Lizzie. Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. We were just talking about Gus and my granddad, and Harley.",
        "Coop: Well, are you okay?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I'm fine. Are you? I think you need to go check on Harley.",
        "Coop: I will-- we will. First off, Ava and I need to close up.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sure Ava won't mind doing that, being the circumstances?",
        "Ava: Oh, yeah, sure.",
        "Coop: Ava, I can't ask you to do that?",
        "Lizzie: You're not. I'm asking her. I think we should take Ava up on her generous offer. Come on, let's go.",
        "Coop: Are you sure?",
        "Ava: Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Coop: Okay. Look, I'll see you tomorrow, and thank you, really.",
        "Ava: Wow, Lizzie, you certainly are an actress.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Wow. You ever have this thing happen when you walk into a room and it gets suddenly quiet and you know for a fact that people were talking about you before you came in.",
        "Billy: We were.",
        "Josh: Probably saying something I won't like.",
        "Billy: You definitely would not like to know that I... almost took a drink earlier this evening.",
        "Josh: Almost, but didn't.",
        "Billy: Uh-huh.",
        "Josh: You're leveling with me right now, right?",
        "Billy: Josh, if there is anything to tell you, I certainly would. Olivia and I were just talking about the fact I need to be honest with you and myself from here on in.",
        "Josh: That sounds like it might be a good conversation to have with your sponsor?",
        "Billy: Yeah. You two have something going on obviously, so I'm going to head on out.",
        "Josh: Why did you come here in the first place?",
        "Billy: I had something here I think you'd find very interesting.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Billy: Sure.",
        "Josh: Billy?",
        "Billy: Yeah?",
        "Josh: I'm proud of you, I really am. Fighting temptation, you know?",
        "Billy: Me, too. Let's just hope I can keep it up.",
        "Olivia: So, did you take care of what you needed to take care of?",
        "Josh: Yes, I did. Actually, I called Cassie, left a message on her voicemail saying that I felt she could handle things on her own now, and that I would be backing off.",
        "Olivia: That's big stuff for you.",
        "Josh: Yeah, it felt like it, which says to me that you were right, and it was something that I needed to do. You know, I... I think I've been getting too involved in Cassie's life lately, trying to fill a void in my own, I guess.",
        "Olivia: Well, we all have that. Maybe we can help each other out.",
        "Josh: Maybe so. How about a little skating, hotshot?",
        "Olivia: Skating sounds good.",
        "Josh: Okay. We'll have a lovely, carefree evening, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Today was a very, very long day. But, definitely good for business. What are your receipts like on a daily basis?",
        "Lizzie: Huh?",
        "Coop: At the boutique. I mean, do you know what Hannah grosses on a daily basis? Look, you know what? I'm sure that's probably privileged information and I'm sorry for asking.",
        "Lizzie: No, I really don't pay attention to stuff like that, the whole financial end.",
        "Coop: I just was asking because Hannah seems like a nice lady and maybe you could learn some things from her.",
        "Lizzie: Could we please just not talk about work for two seconds? I'm sorry, I don't mean to snap at you. It's just we're both off work and the last thing I want to think about is work.",
        "Coop: Okay, all right. Come here. Okay, what do you want to think about?",
        "Lizzie: Maybe something a bit more fun.",
        "Coop: Fun?",
        "Lizzie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Frank: Hey. Has anybody seen Harley tonight?",
        "Coop: No.",
        "Frank: Well, Coop, have you talked to her?",
        "Coop: No. Why? What's up?",
        "Frank: She's not answering any of my calls. Lynn said that earlier this evening she was throwing back two shots.",
        "Coop: Shots? Harley doing shots? No, please. Lynn must be mistaken.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well I hope so. I certainly hope so. I'm worried about her. She's not returning any of my calls.",
        "Coop: Okay, Frank, whoa, whoa. Hey, look. Talk to me, here.",
        "Frank: What is there to talk about? She is in total denial. She cannot accept the fact that Gus is gone.",
        "Lizzie: That's how I was when my dad died. What, did I say something wrong?",
        "Coop: No.",
        "Frank: No.",
        "Lizzie: I mean that happens when you lose somebody you love. You're like no, it didn't really happen, it's not true. He is coming back. Until this day, it seems like my dad is going to walk in the room.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I know how hard it is. You know when my mom died, I kept thinking if I was a good boy, if I'm really, really good, she would come back. You know it's kind of like Santa Claus at Christmas, if you act really, really good, you get awesome Christmas presents. So I kept thinking for years, hopefully she'll come back, she'll come back, she'll come back, but you know what, she didn't come back. So I think that is what Harley's thinking right now.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, Harley's not a kid anymore, she's an adult. And when an adult thinks like that, they do some really crazy things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Come on, Harley, close your eyes. Get some sleep.",
        "Harley: You scared me, Gus.",
        "Mallet: Harley, I'm not Gus.",
        "Harley: I should be angry with you, but I'm not, because I'm just grateful that you're here and because I love you.",
        "Mallet: Harley...",
        "Harley: You know what? I can't walk around pretending that I'm okay, because I'm not okay. But you're here now. You're here now, and I love you. I do, I love you.",
        "Mallet: Um... um, no, no."
