        "While Juice Newton's \"Queen of Hearts\" plays in the background Gus wakes up in his \"prison\". He remembers the car crash, starting with when he picked Alan up. He told him that he was going to force him, by gunpoint, to sign a confession and then drive him back to Springfield where he would be put in jail. Alan refuses and when he grabbed for the gun, wound up crashing the car. Gus is left upside down and pinned in the car while Alan was unconscious in the back. A homeless man came and stole Gus's wallet, but Gus in his state imagines the guy to be Mallet stealing everything from him. Alan woke up and left to get some water and came back for Gus. A stranger cloaked from head to toe came up to the men and then that was the last thing Gus remembered till waking up. In the present, Gus breaks through a door to find Alan in an adjoining room. He spots medicine and realizes that someone is holding them prisoner. They try to escape but Gus's leg wound and Alan's inability to move his left arm hinders them. They hear a noise and try to talk with whoever is holding them hostage but they get no answer. The mystery person locks the door and leaves, dropping her hood to reveal it is Beth. Back in Springfield Mallet sobers up a drunk Harley and fills her in on her actions. Harley says she knows that Gus is gone and Mallet asks her to let him help her through this. He comforts her, which leads to a kiss, and she pushes him down on the bed."

        "Radio announcer: Celebrate the New Year. Mogul Alan Spaulding has just won his release. Midnight and I'm a-waitin' on the 12:05 hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line moonlight... playing with the queen of hearts knowing it ain't really smart the joker--",
        "Gus: Hi, baby. I'm not going to let my father get anywhere near you, don't worry.",
        "Alan: What a way to start the New Year. Driver, get me out of here!",
        "Gus: Anything you say. ( Tires screech )",
        "Alan: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Gus: I will be your driver tonight. How am I doing so far?",
        "Alan: No. Do you realize this is kidnapping, Gus?",
        "Gus: I know what I'm doing. You want to tell me what your plan was?",
        "Alan: You tell me.",
        "Gus: I know for starters, you want to kill Harley.",
        "Alan: Why don't you just stop the car so we can discuss this?",
        "Gus: I'm not stopping the car. You know I would do anything to protect her and I would think that you'd know that by now.",
        "Alan: Just stop the car and we'll talk about it.",
        "Gus: We're not talking about it-- ( tires screeching )",
        "Gus: Wait a second. Wait a sec...",
        "Harley: ( Screaming ) Stop! God! Are you crazy? Are you nuts? What are you, trying to drown me?",
        "Mallet: Here, dry yourself off.",
        "Harley: No thank you! Are you nuts? You can't put my face under water like that. I couldn't breath.",
        "Mallet: I didn't have much choice; you were a little drunk, wouldn't you say?",
        "Harley: I'm not that drunk.",
        "Mallet: I just didn't want you to hurt yourself or do something that you'll feel sorry for in the morning, okay? I mean, I understand you tied one on, I get that. I understand that. I guess you're entitled to that.",
        "Harley: I'm entitled, am I? You're very understanding, you know that? Really. Remind me again why I'm entitled. No, I'm serious, say it. I'm sober. You can say it; I can hear it.",
        "Mallet: You're really not that sober.",
        "Harley: No, I am. Look. I'm serious. Look, I can do this. I remember everything, okay? I remember the crash site; I remember the F.B.I. agents. I remember the look on your face when you handed me Gus' coat. I remember it. I know that the F.B.I. \"Don't think it looks so good.\" My brother certainly doesn't think it looks so good. You don't even think it looks so good, do you?",
        "Mallet: Why don't you lay down? Why don't you get some sleep? Sleep it off.",
        "Harley: I know that what's his name uh... the agent-- Fox, he's saying it is no longer a search-and-rescue, it's now a recovery. That they're looking for his body. They're looking for Gus' body.",
        "Mallet: Harley, listen to me. Don't talk about this.",
        "Harley: You think his body's in the bottom of that lake, don't you? Don't you?",
        "Mallet: Gus was my partner. We didn't always see eye to eye, but he had my back. So maybe in another world, maybe in a world without you in it, we would've been friends. I would like to have Gus' back, yes.",
        "Harley: But you don't think he's coming back?",
        "Mallet: What does it matter what I think?",
        "Harley: Because it does. Because it matters to me what you think.",
        "Mallet: Anything's possible. And if you need hope to hang onto because you can't get your mind around any other idea right now, then that's... that's... what, what are you thinking?",
        "Harley: I believe it.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Harley: I believe that he's gone. That's why I got so drunk. I just wanted to shut my brain off for a little while, you know. Have this stop hurting so much every day. I know he's not coming back, okay. I know he's not going to fix up that house with me. We're not going on any family vacations real soon. He's not coming back. I know that. I believe that now. He's gone, right? Gus is gone? No, don't-- don't do that, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Ah! Oh! ( Car horn blaring )",
        "Alan: Gus, slow down. Where are you taking me?",
        "Gus: I'm taking you to a place where we can discuss a little business, and then I'm taking you to prison.",
        "Alan: Prison?",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. You'll can spend the rest of your natural life there.",
        "Alan: You must be losing your mind; I was just released, Gus.",
        "Gus: Yes, that's right, you're a sane man now, aren't you? You're a sane man that is able to sign a confession that he killed his son in cold blood. Then I'll take you back to Springfield, you can pay your debt to society. How's that?",
        "Alan: I've got news for you: I'm not signing anything. So you might as well turn around--",
        "Gus: Oh, I think you'll sign whatever I want you to sign. I don't care how long it takes, believe me, by the time I done with you.",
        "Alan: Yeah. By the time you're done with me? What did Harley think when you told her you were taking the law into your own hands? I'll bet she was disgusted.",
        "Gus: Don't worry about her. Don't you worry about her. She's got a good support group. She's got her brother, she's got her father. Don't worry about her.",
        "Alan: She doesn't have her husband, though. I wonder who she's going to lean on while you're gone. Oh, but of course, Detective Mallet and she can take off right where they left, right?",
        "Gus: Let me tell you something, Dad, don't underestimate me, okay?",
        "Alan: Don't underestimate me. ( Screeching tires )",
        "Gus: Oh. Alan! Alan! ( Tapping on the wall ) This used to be a door. This is my way out. ( Tapping on the wall ) Yeah, this was a door. It's must have been plastered over. All right, I'm going to come home, baby. I'm going to come home to you and the kids. I'll figure this out. I'll figure this out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Come on, get out of those wet clothes.",
        "Harley: It doesn't seem real, does it?",
        "Mallet: No, no. But it's starting to. Put that on.",
        "Harley: I don't feel so dizzy anymore.",
        "Mallet: That's good. The alcohol's probably wearing off.",
        "Harley: Thanks, Mallet.",
        "Mallet: For what?",
        "Harley: You know, for bringing me back here to sober up. You didn't happen to pick up my bar bill, did you?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughing ) No, I think your friend picked that one up.",
        "Harley: My friend, ha-ha.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, the guy you were leaving with when I came in.",
        "Harley: I was not. I was not. I was? Oh, God I was, wasn't I? I think I remember dancing with him. I don't remember a lot. Be gentle.",
        "Mallet: I missed the dancing, but you were drunk, and I think you thought he was Gus. I think you thought I was Gus when you kissed me.",
        "Harley: I kissed you? I did not.",
        "Mallet: How quickly they forget.",
        "Harley: It wasn't like a kiss, kiss, right?",
        "Mallet: That's why... that's why I threw you in the shower.",
        "Harley: Sorry. I didn't happen to kiss anybody else, did I?",
        "Mallet: No, I think it's pretty safe to say it's just the two of us. The poor guy, I think he had big, big plans for tonight.",
        "Harley: Okay. Here comes the humiliation. I can feel it. Because I'm starting to remember everything now.",
        "Mallet: Hey, you know what, it is okay. There is no need to explain. You thought he was Gus. That's...",
        "Harley: No, I just pretended. I knew he wasn't Gus. See, you don't know what it's been like, this not knowing. I just had to shut my brain off for just a little while. Close my eyes and stop my heart from hurting. This is the part where you say it's understandable, right? Well, it's not.",
        "Mallet: I think it's completely understandable. Listen, you know what? I'm not asking for much here, but you come up here, use my shower, wear my robe, sack out on my couch, but at some point, you're just going to have to allow yourself to let me help you through this. It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Gus: Ah. All right, I got to get out of here and take care of Alan. I may not be home in time for dinner. This is not good. Alan. Alan? Alan!",
        "Man: Sorry, guys but I don't think you're going to be needing any of this.",
        "Gus: What are you talking about?",
        "Man: I'm taking what is yours. Actually, I'm taking everything that's yours.",
        "Gus: Ah. Ah. Alan! Ah! ( Grunting ) Alan! Alan? ( Banging noises ) ah! ( Grunting ) Alan. Alan. Alan, wake up. We're prisoners.",
        "Alan: What are you going to do now, son?",
        "Gus: First we're going to find some shelter and then you're going to get to writing that confession of yours for killing my brother. Yeah. You can think of it as a New Year's resolution.",
        "Alan: You can forget about that, Gus. You're hurt, so am I. We both need help.",
        "Gus: I'm going to tell you something. If you think for one second, that I'm not going to get what I brought you out here for... ( grunts )",
        "Alan: You've got to let me go and get us help.",
        "Gus: I don't think so.",
        "Alan: I'm not going to leave you out here to die, Gus.",
        "Gus: You really don't have a problem with that. I thought that's what you did to my brother.",
        "Alan: I will never do anything like that again. I am your father, Gus, give me a chance to save you. We're both going to stay out here and freeze to death.",
        "Gus: Maybe that's better. This way you can't hurt anybody in the family and you can't get near my wife.",
        "Alan: So that's what this is about, huh?",
        "Gus: You don't do anything. You don't move. All right. All right, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead, go ahead! What have I done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: So how am I going to do this? You tell me, how am I supposed to uh... even conjure up the desire to go day after day without him around?",
        "Mallet: You don't have to think about all of this stuff now.",
        "Harley: Can I get drunk again?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughing ) No.",
        "Harley: I'm going to have to face reality eventually, right? He's gone and he's not coming back. And I have to face that reality. And I've got to figure out what I'm going to do, and I have to figure out what I'm going to tell my kids.",
        "Mallet: You'll find a way. You're tough.",
        "Harley: I don't know who I am without him. I mean I am who I am because of him. He had made me this person. I'm a better person because of him.",
        "Mallet: I think you were pretty much okay before you met him. I've always thought you were an amazing person.",
        "Harley: I am with Gus. I was. I have to start saying \"was,\" right?",
        "Mallet: Hey, if you want to keep wearing this, then wear it. If you need a reminder of who you want to be, who you can be, then look at it. Look at it when you're feeling low. Look at it when you want to draw from his strength. Look at it when the kids ask about him.",
        "Harley: I'm not going to be thinking about those things when I look at this ring. When I look at this ring I think about broken promises. I think about vows that he threw away. What about to love and cherish? To be there, you know, to protect somebody! Me and the boys!",
        "Mallet: I think he was protecting you. That's what he was trying to do. Alan was out to get you--",
        "Harley: This was not about him helping me. If he was going to help me, then he would've been here, now, where he is needed. What he did was irresponsible. It was reckless...",
        "Mallet: Maybe... just maybe he was trying to do the best he could.",
        "Harley: Okay, but since when does meaning doing the best you can mean hurting somebody as much they could ever possibly be hurt? Since when?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Alan. Alan. Look at me, look at me.",
        "Alan: ( Whispers ) Who are you?",
        "Gus: It's me, Gus. Do you have the keys?",
        "Alan: Keys?",
        "Gus: To the door.",
        "Alan: Gus?",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Alan: Where am I?",
        "Gus: We're in trouble. We're in a hell of a lot of trouble. We've got to break out of here somehow.",
        "Alan: Break out? I thought this was the place you brought me to get a confession out of me.",
        "Gus: Do I look like I'm in charge here?",
        "Alan: If you're not, Gus, who is?",
        "Gus: I don't know. Did you see anyone when we were brought in here. Do you remember anything?",
        "Alan: The only thing I remember is: You kidnapped me, we had an accident, it was snowing, and you were very hurt, so I went to get some water. And someone hit me on the head.",
        "Gus: Hmmm. What about these pills right here?",
        "Alan: What about them?",
        "Gus: Well, somebody must have come in the room and given you the pills. You don't remember?",
        "Alan: No. What do you remember?",
        "Gus: I know somebody must have dropped this.",
        "Alan: Did anyone help you take me hostage?",
        "Gus: Hey, help me up to this vent, all right? Come on.",
        "Alan: Wait, you can't get through that.",
        "Gus: Just help me. We don't know until we try. Come on, let's go.",
        "Alan: Gus, I've got a bad injury here.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Alan: I only have one arm.",
        "Gus: So use the other arm, come on.",
        "Alan: I can't lift you up with just one arm.",
        "Gus: Try. Take it easy. Just lean up against the door. Put your hands like so, all right?",
        "Alan: No, no, no. Just put your legs...",
        "Gus: Over here?",
        "Alan: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Gus: All right, come on.",
        "Alan: Yeah. Okay? Nope.",
        "Gus: Oh, this leg. I can't do it with this leg. You're just a pillar of strength, you know that?",
        "Alan: Well, you're the one that couldn't scale the ladder.",
        "Gus: We've got one good arm and one good leg. What else have we got left?",
        "Alan: It looks like the only thing we've got left is each other.",
        "Gus: Fabulous.",
        "Alan: The fact is, Gus, we wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. And we're going to have to help each other to get out of here.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well hold that thought while I put a bullet in my head.",
        "Alan: You need me. We need each other to survive.",
        "Gus: ( Grunting ) I can't! ( Grunting )",
        "Alan: Gus, I told you I would come back.",
        "Gus: Did you find anyone?",
        "Alan: Not a soul, but I found this. Here, take a drink, you'll feel better. Come on. Okay?",
        "Gus: It's unbelievable, isn't it?",
        "Alan: That's one word for it. Now, look, Gus. You're going to have to get up or we'll never get out of here. Come on, let me help you. Yep. Come on. That's it. That's it.",
        "Gus: ( Grunting ) Okay. I don't think I can-- I don't think I can do better than this.",
        "Alan: I admire the lengths you will go for that woman, but you're crazy if you think I'm going to go back to jail.",
        "Gus: So you came back here to shoot me.",
        "Alan: No, I won't shoot you unless I have to. Now the road's not far up there, so come. ( Grunting ) Three sons, and not one of them give a damn about me.",
        "Gus: Because none of your sons are good enough for you, Dad. It'd be nice to have a father that we can trust. (Grunts ) ( yelling in pain )",
        "Alan: Hey! Over here, help!",
        "Gus: You hit me; knocked me out. Remember what happened after that? Hmmm?",
        "Alan: I thought I saw someone. I went to flag them down, and I was hit in the head. I don't know, maybe I was dreaming it or something.",
        "Gus: That figures.",
        "Alan: I can't remember.",
        "Gus: You realize we would not be in this mess if it were not for you and your crazy desire to ruin my wife's life and my marriage. But I promise you one thing, when we get out of here, you will be giving me that confession.",
        "Alan: Well, at least I have something to look forward to, Gus.",
        "Gus: All right, let's do this thing again, come on. You help me out here.",
        "Alan: No, I'm not going to do it, not until I get a thank you.",
        "Gus: A thank you for what?",
        "Alan: For coming back and helping you. You know I could have left you here to die, but I didn't. You know why?",
        "Gus: I really don't care to hear it.",
        "Alan: Because you're my son. You're a Spaulding and I love you, that's why.",
        "Gus: Could we just cut the emotional crap, okay? Just concentrate on getting ourselves out of here, okay, please. I'm a-waitin' on the 12:05 hoping it'll take me...",
        "Alan: I would do the same thing for Phillip, Alan-Michael, Lizzie, any of the Spaulding's because when the chips are down...",
        "Gus: Oh, my-- do you hear the cliches? The endless cliche-- could you just... someone's coming. Playing with the queen of hearts...",
        "Gus: Do you hear that? Knowing it ain't really smart..",
        "Alan: I don't hear anything.",
        "Gus: It's music. The joker ain't the only fool...",
        "Alan: What is it?",
        "Gus: Shh... Who'll do anything for you...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: He has cheated me.",
        "Mallet: No.",
        "Harley: He has cheated me out of the life we were supposed to have together, yes!",
        "Mallet: No, he didn't mean to cheat you. You know sometimes people just love somebody so much it kind of washes away their reasoning.",
        "Harley: Don't you dare defend him. You don't know what we have been through together. I went through hell and back for this guy so that we could be together, so we could be a team. And what does he do? He goes off-- kamikaze, solo.",
        "Mallet: I know you think he let you down. I know it seems like that--",
        "Harley: No, he betrayed me. No! He abandoned me. I did everything to track him down. I willed him to be alive. And he is gone. And I didn't even have a chance to save us.",
        "Mallet: It's going to be all right. I promise. You're going to be all right.",
        "Harley: I love him.",
        "Mallet: I know. I know you do.",
        "Harley: I really love him.",
        "Harley: I thought I would see Gus every day for the rest of my life, and now I won't.",
        "Mallet: Maybe you will. Maybe you will some day.",
        "Harley: Maybe I will.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. ( Laughter ) No. Harley, what are we doing?",
        "Harley: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I know that song. That's what I'll have to do...",
        "Gus: ( Whispers ) They're coming. They're coming.",
        "Alan: What do you want to do?",
        "Gus: Come over here. Come over here. Stay right here, okay? He comes in, we jump him.",
        "Alan: Okay.",
        "Gus: We have to.",
        "Alan: Wait, they're leaving. They're leaving. Wait, wait, wait. Who are you?",
        "Gus: Come on, Dad. Don't call his name. It's going to get us in trouble. Just give us a chance...",
        "Alan: We've got nothing to lose. Listen, let us out of here. I will pay you any amount of money.",
        "Gus: Oh, that's good. You're going to bribe the guy.",
        "Alan: Money talks. Have you got a better idea?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I got a better idea, but you just blew it.",
        "Alan: Please, please. Open the door. Name your price.",
        "Gus: You're never going to change.",
        "Alan: Gus, come over here. Say something. Come on.",
        "Gus: Hey, sir? Hello? Look, if you could just let me make a phone call. My wife is probably really worried. I...",
        "Alan: They're not responding. They're not responding.",
        "Gus: This is not good. That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you playing with the queen of hearts playing with the queen of hearts",

        "Reva: When did this happen, Billy? When did I start playing defense.",
        "Billy: I don't know, Reva, but maybe it is time for Ms. Shayne to go back on the defense.",
        "Beth: I had high hopes for that marriage, but it didn't work out.",
