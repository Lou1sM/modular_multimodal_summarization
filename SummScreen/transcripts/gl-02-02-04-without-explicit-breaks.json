        "Marah's been cut, by the doll placed in her desk drawer, but further examination reveals it was a razor blade she stored there with other sewing equipment. Still, she's spooked, suspecting Carrie, and she calls Jeffrey in a panic. She regrets it almost immediately and tells him not to come over. Jeffrey arrives, Marah is backtracking like crazy but Jeffrey sees that she's scared. She talks around the subject of Carrie, knowing she can't be completely truthful \u0096 but Jeffrey, who's already met with Carrie, thinks he knows what's going on. Jeffrey calls Carrie and puts her on notice to leave Marah and the other girls alone. Olivia has papers that she wants Phillip to sign. Olivia gets a call from Cassie, warning her to watch out for Lizzie. On the heels of the call, Olivia gets a visit from Alex and Beth who want to see Phillip. Olivia lies, telling them Phillip doesn't want to see them. Ed gets a shock when Mel complains she's not feeling well and asks him to treat her. Ed, trying to draw blood, finds himself too shaky to handle the syringe when it's his grandchild's health on the line. He quits the hospital on the spot. Meanwhile, Rick and Mel are relieved that their plan worked. Tammy is determined to change her look to attract more \"mysterious and romantic\" men \u0096 like Edmund. Cassie believes she's talked her out of it but when she returns home, Tammy has been transformed and not for the better."

        "Olivia: He wakes. How was your nap?",
        "Phillip: What...",
        "Olivia: Can't a wife watch her husband sleep? Actually, I was kind of waiting for you to wake up because I need your help.",
        "Phillip: Now?",
        "Olivia: No. You know what? It's just a quick signature. I promise it won't hurt a bit.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, Kenny said that you were freaking out looking for me. What's going on? Where's the fire?",
        "Tammy: This is it. It's an emergency.",
        "Cassie: A fashion emergency?",
        "Tammy: A \"me\" emergency. Clothes make the woman, right? It's time for a whole new me.",
        "Cassie: Honey, I think you're great just the way you are.",
        "Tammy: You're my mom. And no offense, but you don't count.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, who does count? Joey?",
        "Tammy: I guess. I mean, Joey's great, but...",
        "Cassie: What do you mean \"Joey's great, but...?\" You were all over him earlier. But what now?",
        "Tammy: But I want more than he has to offer. Mom, Joey's puppy love. I want magic and mystery and romance. I want butterflies in my stomach and walking on air. I want that stuff that you see in the movies and dream about forever. I want Shakespeare.",
        "Cassie: Honey, you're going to have that one day. You will.",
        "Tammy: Not unless I make some major changes, Mom. I need an extreme makeover. If I'm ever going to have what I want, I need to become a hottie, like you.",
        "Marah: Who would do this to me?",
        "Beth: When you think about it, it was bound to happen eventually.",
        "Jeffrey: What's that?",
        "Beth: After a lifetime of purely disposable relationships, your streak couldn't last forever.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sorry, I'm not following.",
        "Beth: Well, you've spent your lifetime perfecting the art of the no-string affair. You're a master. I should know, I was a willing student. But it's not an exact science. There are real people, real emotions involved. Eventually something had to give.",
        "Jeffrey: So are you accusing me of being human?",
        "Beth: I won't tell a soul.",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Jeffrey: Sorry. Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Marah: It's Marah.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah?",
        "Beth: Oh, isn't that the way love goes though.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you done? Can you be done now? Thank you.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, are you there?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah, I'm here.",
        "Marah: Don't think I'm crazy, but I think that I'm being stalked.",
        "Jeffrey: Could you repeat that?",
        "Marah: You know what? Never mind. It's no big deal. I just freaked out. It's my problem. Forget about it.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, where are you? What's going on?",
        "Marah: I'm at home. But you know what? It's fine. It's nothing. Look, I'm sorry that I bothered you. Oh, God.",
        "Beth: Well, what are you waiting for? Go to her. I'm fine.",
        "Jeffrey: It's an emergency.",
        "Beth: I'm sure you'll take very good care of her. At the moment, I'm more worried about whether you can take care of yourself.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Frank: Hey, buddy.",
        "Rick: Hey, Frankie.",
        "Frank: What's up? You look a little beat.",
        "Rick: Oh, that's just because I am. I'm just taking a little breather. That's all.",
        "Frank: Oh, boy, this is serious. Hey, the other night I drove by your house. I was up for an old-fashioned Bauer refrigerator raid and you didn't have your lights on, so I didn't stop.",
        "Rick: Well, I hate to break this to you, but the old Bauer fridge ain't what it used to be since Michelle moved out.",
        "Frank: What's going on with you, huh? I mean, Mel's a good cook, right? I mean, she's living up to her reputation, isn't she? Or is she not? This isn't about Mel is it? Oh, my God, the baby. Is it the baby?",
        "Rick: No, Mel's fine. She's fine. She looks great. She feels great. I think the only thing that she's worried about these days is why she married into my family.",
        "Frank: What's going on with you? Hold on. First of all, you tell me it's not Mel, it's not Michelle, it's not the baby. I mean what it could... I know what this is about. Danny Santos running for mayor, right? I mean there's got to be underlying tension in the family. You know, I haven't talked to you about this, but, well, I guess now is a good time. What is the guy thinking?",
        "Rick: I guess that means you're pulling for Ross, right, Frank? No, for once this has nothing top do with Danny. This time the award for Most Difficult Bauer has to go to my dad.",
        "Nurse: Oh, you don't have to do that, Dr. Bauer.",
        "Ed: What?",
        "Nurse: I can get that filled for your patient.",
        "Edmund: Oh. No, that's okay. It's not important.",
        "Nurse: Okay, you have a patient waiting in Exam Three. That's if you're still on duty.",
        "Ed: Sure, I'm here. I'll just take a look. Hi, I'm Dr. Bauer.",
        "Mel: Hi, Ed.",
        "Ed: Mel, what...",
        "Mel: Dr. Sedwick is in the OR, and I couldn't wait.",
        "Ed: Why? Is something wrong?",
        "Mel: I feel a little queasy, off-balance. I just thought I should get checked out. And who better to take care of my baby than the grandfather?",
        "Tammy: Hey, Mom, I want to try that one.",
        "Cassie: Okay, can you tell me what's really going on here? Because... why are you acting so frantic?",
        "Tammy: It's simple. You can't catch the right fish if you don't have the right bait.",
        "Cassie: Have you been reading Cosmo again?",
        "Tammy: I'm serious. I'm letting life pass me by. It has to stop.",
        "Cassie: Okay, all right. We have to think here for a minute, because you have... I'm your mother. And, to be honest, I don't really want to see you as \"hot.\" And the truth is you don't have to change a thing about yourself for a guy to be attracted to you.",
        "Tammy: Then where are they, Mom?",
        "Cassie: Tammy, you have a really great guy.",
        "Tammy: But he's not the right kind of guy, and that is because I am boring. Look at me.",
        "Cassie: Honey, you get more and more beautiful every day, do you know that? And you're smart, and you're talented. I mean, I want to be you when I grow up.",
        "Tammy: Next, you'll be telling me I have a great personality.",
        "Cassie: No, I just think a guy would be absolutely crazy to not love you for who you are. Now, what's really going on here? I mean, did you and Joey have some kind of a fight? Are you going to kick him to the curb? What?",
        "Tammy: This has nothing to do with Joey. It has everything to do with me. Okay, it has a little to do with Joey. Joey's great, but he's like a great old sweatshirt. Comfy and warm. But he's no cashmere sweater. And he never will be.",
        "Cassie: What's wrong with a comfy sweatshirt?",
        "Tammy: That's easy for you to say. You have Edmund.",
        "Cassie: Ah, the cashmere sweater. Yes, he is. That's not why I'm with him. To be honest, that fancy stuff is a little weird.",
        "Tammy: It can't be. Not after Dad and living in San Cristobel.",
        "Cassie: Honey... Tammy, I loved your father more than anything because he was a wonderful kind man. And he was absolutely gorgeous. But that was just icing on the cake.",
        "Tammy: Well, think about it, Mom. Who wants cake without icing? I mean, I've seen what you have with Edmund. I want that.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, we're a lot older than you. And we have been through so much to end up where we are.",
        "Tammy: I want a prince, too.",
        "Cassie: Oh. I know you do. I know you do. And you're going to get one. But you shouldn't have to compromise anything about yourself to have one. You stay true to yourself and you are going to find the perfect guy for you.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I'm not interrupting one of those greeting card, mother/daughter moments, am I?",
        "Cassie: Well, actually...",
        "Tammy: Well, we were talking about revamping my wardrobe. And Mom is opposed.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, to have your problems, Tammy.",
        "Cassie: Well, what's your problem, Lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you mean you haven't heard? Yeah, Dad and Olivia got married. She knew she'd better trap him while he was still half out of his mind. Oh, and if you wanted to know, the groom wore white -- a straight jacket, actually. For all I know, he was saying I do to another flavor of pudding.",
        "Cassie: I'm sure the doctor wouldn't have allowed it if they didn't think that that...",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on. Olivia has Dr. Langham around her little finger. I don't know what he sees in her.",
        "Cassie: Olivia happens...",
        "Lizzie: Don't! Just don't say her name in front of me, all right? She took advantage of my grandfather, she's ruined the chances of my parents ever getting back together, and she's tried putting me away. And now this? Why did she even come back? What is she going to do with our family now? Why couldn't she have just stayed the hell away?",
        "Cassie: Wow. I thought you were working on your problem with Olivia.",
        "Lizzie: I am. I am. I just... I don't really think that she and my dad work well together. And you don't have to worry or anything, I'm not going to go crazy. I'll be fine. Really.",
        "Cassie: Well, you don't seem fine. I mean, just the mention of her name sure set you off.",
        "Lizzie: What? I mean, Olivia, Olivia, Olivia. See? I can say it myself.",
        "Cassie: Lizzie, come on.",
        "Lizzie: It's just a shock that's all. It makes no sense. They weren't together and the only connection they had was the baby, and now the baby's gone, so... I just don't get it, all right?",
        "Cassie: Well, you don't have to understand it, but you do have to accept it. And you shouldn't be out there looking for villains. You should be out there trying to find a way to help your father. And maybe this is helping your father, like it or not.",
        "Lizzie: I don't like it, all right? But that does not mean that I'm going to do anything about it, okay? I'm working on keeping my emotions in check. It's just hard. It's really, really hard.",
        "Cassie: I understand. I do. Well, I'm going to leave you two fashionistas. I have an appointment. Behave yourself.",
        "Olivia: It's all pretty standard stuff, you know. So, if you just sign by the X, then you can go back to sleep. Phillip?",
        "Phillip: Ross...",
        "Olivia: What about Ross?",
        "Phillip: Here to look at the papers.",
        "Olivia: Well, you know, like I said, it's all pretty standard stuff and I don't really want to waste his time. Beside, I hear he's a little busy these days.",
        "Phillip: Gus.",
        "Olivia: Gus wouldn't understand any of this. And I don't think we really want him intruding on our honeymoon.",
        "Phillip: Gus?",
        "Olivia: We really don't need Gus, sweetheart.",
        "Phillip: But I have to protect...",
        "Olivia: I know. I know. And there are so many people to protect. That's actually one of the things I've always loved about you. But don't worry, I'm taking care of everything. We all have to make sure that we're protected... including you.",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Olivia: You know what? I have to get this. That's great. Okay. Get some rest now, okay?",
        "Cassie: Hi, it's me.",
        "Olivia: Hi. I'm with Phillip. What's up?",
        "Cassie: I know that I've been fighting you about keeping Emma a secret, but I think you're right. At least for now.",
        "Olivia: What changed your mind?",
        "Cassie: Lizzie Spaulding.",
        "Beth: Ah, thank you. Just what I was waiting for.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, good. Darling, I need your help. I think it's time we welcome the newest member of the Spaulding family.",
        "Beth: What do you have in mind? A reception or a firing squad?",
        "Alexandra: Well, it's not a very difficult choice.",
        "Beth: Count me out. Phillip married Olivia and I'm going to try to respect that.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes, of course, the way she respected your marriage to Phillip.",
        "Beth: We weren't married at the time.",
        "Alexandra: A technicality. But you were on your way. Always right with the world until she sunk her teeth into Phillip.",
        "Beth: Everything happens for a reason.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, have you been drinking a lot, dear? You know, if anyone should be helping Phillip back to recovery, it should be you.",
        "Beth: It's not my place anymore.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Oh, really? Well, you are still a member of his family. You are the mother of his children and she isn't.",
        "Beth: She lost her child!",
        "Alexandra: Well, so what? I mean, so what... what do you think she's looking for? To fill some sort of void in her own life?",
        "Beth: Maybe. Yes.",
        "Alexandra: Well, think about it, my darling. Without the baby, what would she possibly want with a man who can barely carry on a simple conversation?",
        "Beth: Phillip is getting better.",
        "Alexandra: He was. No, she's not going to stop there.",
        "Beth: Oh, Alex, come on.",
        "Alexandra: No, no, no. She's going to blast and grab at this family. The whole family. And you know whatever Olivia gets, it always seem to come with the expense of someone else. Do you want it to be at Lizzie's?",
        "Ed: Where's Rick?",
        "Mel: I already had him paged.",
        "Ed: And you've ruled out Braxton-Hicks?",
        "Mel: Yes. There's no cramping. I just feel nauseous... kind of like morning sickness, but I'm way past that. What do you think?",
        "Ed: Well, I think that I'll fill your doctor in when she gets here. You know the rule about family treating family.",
        "Mel: No, Ed, I want to waive that rule, okay? I don't have a problem with it. And if you don't...",
        "Ed: Well, actually, I kind of... I kind of do. You want to talk about choosing names, I'm your guy, you know, but the rule is there for a reason. And I think we should just wait for Dr. Sedwick.",
        "Mel: Ed, please. I can't wait.",
        "Ed: I can't do this.",
        "Mel: All I need is my blood checked and maybe be re-hydrated...",
        "Ed: Right. So any intern can do that. It's very simple.",
        "Mel: I don't want any intern. I want the best. I want you, okay? Just humor a pregnant woman, please. It's all about trust for me right now. And there's no one I trust more with my baby.",
        "Ed: Okay. Okay, okay.",
        "Mel: Thank you. Would you mind if Dr. Bauer did the honors?",
        "Nurse: Not at all.",
        "Mel: Thank you. So, speaking of baby names, what do you think? We were thinking Hugh for a boy and Sarah for a girl. Of course, our favorites change daily.",
        "Ed: So you're not going to change your mind? I mean, you're still going go ahead and wait to find out the sex of the baby?",
        "Mel: Yeah, healthy. That's all I care about. I'm not afraid of needles, Ed. I trust you completely. Ed? Ed?",
        "Ed: I can't. I can't do this.",
        "Frank: Wow. Man, I got to admit I hate hearing about the tension between Ed and Michelle. I mean, there's always an underlying tension between father and son, but his daughter. I mean, that's... that's his little girl. I mean, Marina and I... Oh, man, that really...",
        "Rick: No, Frank, you're a much different father. Really. I just... I guess I'm just surprised. I just thought things would be different, having him home. And it just hasn't been that way. I mean... you know what I mean, right?",
        "Frank: Yeah, I do.",
        "Rick: I just... I used to just pray for the day that I had my dad back home and he would be the father for me and Michelle. But... Frank, please don't share this with anybody, but it just I have forgotten how difficult and ornery he could really be. And believe me, he hasn't mellowed with age. It's gotten worse.",
        "Frank: Listen, if this is any consolation, my dad, well, I had to... I actually went crazy trying to accept the fact that this image that I had built of him, you know, being a dead war hero as compared to the living, breathing guy that he was when he abandoned us for how many years? And he didn't even look back. Well, look, it's just been real tough, you know, living with the real Buzz Cooper, you know, trying to make that work.",
        "Rick: Oh, come on, Frank, you guys seem to have worked it work. I mean, y'all get along great. I mean, even your sister accepts him.",
        "Frank: It's just taking a long time, okay? And then I finally saw how really hard he was working to coming back into the family, and then I let my guard down a little bit, and then we both just really concentrated and worked hard on trying to figure out who we were. And we just made it work. Things are going to be fine with you and your dad. Come on, it'll work out.",
        "Rick: Frank, I hope so. Listen, I really got to go. But listen, I don't know who I can come to with my problems these days. You're the only one, and you're always a good buddy to me and I really appreciate it.",
        "Frank: Any time. Any time.",
        "Rick: All right. Thanks.",
        "Frank: You know that.",
        "Rick: I'll talk to you later.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah?",
        "Marah: It's unlocked!",
        "Jeffrey: You all right?",
        "Marah: Uh...",
        "Jeffrey: You know, word of advice, if you're worried about stalkers, it's a good idea to lock the door, huh?",
        "Marah: I told you, you didn't have to come.",
        "Jeffrey: What's going on? What's that? Let's see. What..? Come here. All right, so you want to tell me what happened? Where were you when you first thought someone was stalking you? Was it around here? Around the house?",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Jeffrey: \"No?\" You're going to have to give more than that, darling. Come on.",
        "Marah: I was here. I was at home.",
        "Jeffrey: The guy was here? He was in the house?",
        "Marah: No. You know what? It's nothing. Just forget about it.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, it's not nothing. I know you. Now, who is scaring you like this?",
        "Marah: It's not who, it's what. Polly Dolly.",
        "Jeffrey: Polly Dolly?",
        "Marah: Be careful. Um... be careful. The doll cut me. There was a razor blade stuck in it.",
        "Jeffrey: And you think someone put it in there?",
        "Marah: I don't know. I had this doll since I was three years old, and I thought that I lost her in a fire years and years and years ago. But she just... she keeps showing up. And that's fine. Okay, but every time I move her and I try and put her in a different place, she ends up somewhere else. And she was in there in the sewing box, and that's when I got this. And I did not put her in there.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Marah: I swear.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, okay, okay. You couldn't have forgotten?",
        "Marah: No, I didn't.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, all right, all right. Let, see... I don't think you're going to need stitches.",
        "Marah: I didn't call you here to kiss it and make it better. I can take care of it myself.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not going to kiss it and make it feel better, okay? Can I just help you out here? Maybe put a bandage on it, okay? I mean, I'm not a doctor, but I think you're going to live.",
        "Beth: The last thing Lizzie needs is to see me fight with Olivia. I'm going to try to set a good example.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, what are you going to do? Just turn and look the other way while you allow this woman to hurt her father?",
        "Beth: We don't know that she'll hurt him. Look how upset he was when she left town.",
        "Alexandra: That was because of the baby.",
        "Beth: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Alexandra: Well, all right then. Don't you think it's time we found out for sure by talking to Phillip? Please come with me to see Phillip. Please.",
        "Beth: Okay, fine. I will go with you to visit Phillip. But if he's happy and he understands what's going on, I'm out of there and you're on your own for another round with Olivia.",
        "Alexandra: My darling, that's all I can ask.",
        "Olivia: You saw Lizzie. What exactly did she say?",
        "Cassie: Well, she could barely contain her anger when I mentioned your name. And that's not it.",
        "Olivia: What else?",
        "Cassie: She's a smart girl. Her wheels are spinning. She can't figure out what you and Phillip are doing together with the baby out of the equation.",
        "Olivia: No one can know about this baby, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I know. I know. I get that.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Your secret is safe with me.",
        "Olivia: No, really, thank you. I know that this isn't easy for you.",
        "Cassie: I want you to watch your back, okay?",
        "Olivia: Oh, I am. And not just for Lizzie, but the rest of the family, too.",
        "Cassie: Hey, your part of that family now. Congratulations, honey.",
        "Lizzie: If she thinks that a piece of paper automatically makes her family, she has got another thing coming to her. I do not trust that wicked witch and I never will, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: But you just told my mom that you were going to be a good girl and accept this.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on. You bought that? You are so Rory Gilmore, the only person I know who thinks you should tell your parents the truth. See, the secret is that parents can't handle the truth.",
        "Tammy: Oh, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: What? I have to act normal or they're going to throw me in a loony bin with my dad. What was that look for? Do you honestly think that what Olivia did was okay?",
        "Tammy: I guess not.",
        "Lizzie: I can't just stand around and let my dad be held captive by the Queen of Evil.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, well, you can't afford to make any trouble, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: I won't. My grandpa will.",
        "Tammy: Hmm. Hair up or down? Maybe I should cut it. My mom looks great with short hair.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy?",
        "Tammy: What do you think of this?",
        "Lizzie: You don't exactly have the right equipment to fill that.",
        "Tammy: You're right. And that is what I need right now, your brutal honesty.",
        "Lizzie: Hello? Crisis! My life is on the line and you're worried about what you're going to wear?",
        "Tammy: Hello? I've heard it all before.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy!",
        "Tammy: Look, I'm sorry. Your life sucks. I get it. Did you ever stop to think that I have problems, too?",
        "Lizzie: What? Like whether the mini is in or not? Come on. Nothing real ever happens to you.",
        "Tammy: Exactly.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Tammy: You're right. You're absolutely right. Maybe I do need a pushup bra to make this work.",
        "Mel: Ed, is there something I can do?",
        "Ed: Something you can do? I'm supposed to be taking care of you.",
        "Mel: You are the best doctor I know.",
        "Ed: No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm going to get the nurse now and she's going to get a hold of Dr. Sedwick.",
        "Mel: Ed, your hands were shaking.",
        "Ed: I know, honey. It's just been a long day. Okay, you need to get a hold of Dr. Sedwick ASAP, and then I want you to page my son. Get him down here. She needs him. Just get that done.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Bauer, your shift isn't over until...",
        "Ed: Well, I'm off duty till further notice.",
        "Mel: Hey, honey, he just left. We did the right thing, okay? We needed to know. Honey, he's going to get better.",
        "Rick: We still have no idea what's wrong with him.",
        "Mel: Well, we know he can't get better here.",
        "Rick: I just never thought it would come to this.",
        "Mel: Well, confronting him didn't work, okay? We had no choice. At least this way he thinks he came to it on his own. He can leave here with a little bit of his dignity intact.",
        "Rick: Sweetheart, if you think that, then you don't know my father.",
        "Jeffrey: Fine. I think that should do it. That hurt?",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Jeffrey: There. Okay. Now it's time to talk.",
        "Marah: Maybe I just wanted you to come over here and play doctor.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah...",
        "Marah: It's a joke. Joke. I... I don't know. I got cut, you know. I overreacted. And it's... it's not... who would be stalking me?",
        "Jeffrey: You tell me.",
        "Marah: How should I know?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, you don't just make the leap from accident to stalker.",
        "Marah: Well, okay, one accident is just that, it's an accident. But more than one...",
        "Jeffrey: More than... what? Something else happened to you?",
        "Marah: No, not to me. To Michelle.",
        "Jeffrey: Michelle... Michelle Santos?",
        "Marah: Yes. She's one of my best friends and she had an accident recently, too. Only hers was a lot worse. There was a gas leak in her house and she could have died.",
        "Jeffrey: And you think the two are connected?",
        "Marah: It's crazy. I know.",
        "Jeffrey: No, it's not crazy. It's not crazy, Marah. You're following your instincts and you've got good instincts.",
        "Marah: Yeah, I can't exactly waltz into the police station with my rag doll.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, your roommate is the Chief of Police's daughter, so I'm sure Frank would take you seriously. But, yeah, you're right. You might need more than, you know, just the doll.",
        "Marah: Yeah, you know... it's just... forget about it.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, there are some unofficial options.",
        "Marah: Like what? Hire a private investigator? Or I could have my own personal bodyguard.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you're right. No, a bodyguard's not a good idea, no. But a private investigator, you know, maybe Harley's Angels or someone, you know, could find out something.",
        "Marah: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. That's a good idea. That's what I should do. I'm sorry that I wasted your time. I just reacted without thinking.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah. I'm glad you did.",
        "Beth: Hello, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Hi, Beth. Oh, don't tell me. You've come to wish us every happiness. Are there gifts?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I'm just so sorry I missed the ceremony.",
        "Olivia: Oh, because you wanted to stand up for us?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, exactly. I would have stood right up the minute that minister said, \"Does anyone here object to this...?\"",
        "Beth: Alex. Alex. We're just here to say hello Phillip.",
        "Olivia: Of course. The thing is that he's a little busy. He's on the phone right now.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Last time I was here Phillip could hardly string a sentence together. He's that much better, is he? Who's he talking to?",
        "Olivia: Why don't I just see if he's up for a visit? How's that?",
        "Beth: Sorry about the wait.",
        "Alexandra: I'm going in.",
        "Olivia: No, I'm afraid you can't. He's really not up for visitors.",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Olivia: He has asked me to screen all of his visitors from here on out.",
        "Alexandra: Well, we're not exactly visitors. We happen to be family.",
        "Olivia: I hate to be the one to break this to you, but he specifically asked not to see either one of you right now.",
        "Alexandra: Well, Olivia, you know, you have no right to keep Phillip from seeing his family.",
        "Olivia: Well, no... wait. I'm his wife. That makes me... I have every right.",
        "Alexandra: I knew it. I knew it.",
        "Beth: Alex, let's go.",
        "Olivia: Thank you very much. I have to go back to my husband. Now, if you'll excuse me.",
        "Alexandra: Well? Well?",
        "Beth: Yes, yes, you're right, Alex. She's dangerous.",
        "Cassie: Lizzie, hey. What's up? You all right?",
        "Lizzie: I thought that if I couldn't at least count on my family, I would at least be able to count on my friends. But you know what? I'm the only person I can count on. Oh, well.",
        "Cassie: Okay, did you guys have a fight?",
        "Lizzie: No. You can't have a fight with someone who doesn't give a damn about anyone else but themselves.",
        "Cassie: Excuse me, but that doesn't sound like my daughter.",
        "Lizzie: Well, she doesn't look very much like your daughter either. Go see for yourself.",
        "Marah: Well, thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: What, for that? I could get sued by the AMA for doing that.",
        "Marah: No, for making me feel understood and sane.",
        "Jeffrey: You're sane. You keep trusting your instincts. So is someone going to, you know, be here to keep you company?",
        "Marah: Yeah, everyone should be back later tonight. I'm perfectly safe.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not going to let anything happen to you. Nothing's going to happen to you, Marah, so try to get some sleep, okay?",
        "Marah: I don't think that's going to happen. You want to stay for a cup of coffee or something?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't think so.",
        "Marah: Just... you know... one cup. It'll be a \"thank you\" or payment for your emergency medical care. I make really good coffee.",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe one cup.",
        "Marah: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, pursuant to our conversation and our agreement, I have a reminder. The three girls are to remain untouched throughout this process. If I find this is not the case, the deal's off, and there will be hell to pay. I hope we're clear on this.",
        "Cassie: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Cassie: I know what you're doing, and I want you to stop.",
        "Danny: So prove to me I'm wrong about you. Prove to me that you're not the common piece of street trash that I think you are.",
        "Eden: You know, we did it all for you!"
