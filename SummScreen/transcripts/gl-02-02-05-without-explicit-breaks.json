        "Gus: Don't waste my time, alan. I, too, am a busy man.",
        "Alan: Yes, and you also look like a mess. You look like you're on your way to dinner at a soup kitchen. When was the last time you slept?",
        "Gus: I'll sleep when harley's name is cleared for the murder she didn't commit. ( Sighs ) what's this meeting about?",
        "Alan: It's about saving you from yourself. No, I understand that harley needs you, gus, but so do I.",
        "Buzz: Good timing.",
        "Harley: Oh, yeah. My favorite thing to do is to help you with the salt.",
        "Buzz: Not you. Him.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Buzz: You want to earn a chocolate sundae? Okay, toss some of this around.",
        "Harley: Be careful. See? Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad that I didn't take those plane tickets for me and the kids? You would have missed this.",
        "Buzz: Oh, yeah. Child labor. You're going to stay and fight this? I hope you don't regret it.",
        "Lizzie: I think coop actually bought the whole act. I told him gus tried to hurt me. He looked so concerned. The bruises on my arm were a nice touch.",
        "Coop: Hey, you. Ah. Pardon me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt happy time.",
        "Buzz: Get upstairs.",
        "Harley: Dad.",
        "Reporter: There she is. Harley cooper. I'll get a close-up of the kid.",
        "Buzz: Get out of here!",
        "Reporter: What have you told your son about his father's murder?",
        "Dinah: Hey. Who's my favorite obgyn?",
        "Corey: There's a malpractice suit in the right answer to that question.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) don't look surprised to see me. I told you I'd catch up with you. I am so fascinated by what you do. Look, maybe you can give me your advice. Remember that friend I mentioned to you earlier?",
        "Corey: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: She's having a real difficult time getting pregnant. So far, just no luck.",
        "Edmund: Cassie? There you are. Blake said you were some... cassie? Whatever the doctor said, I...",
        "Cassie: Don't say you don't care, because you'd be lying, edmund. This is everything to you, to both of us.",
        "Edmund: All right. Are you pregnant?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you can tell me. Are you pregnant?",
        "Cassie: No. I'm sorry, edmund. I'm not pregnant.",
        "Edmund: Don't be. Don't be sorry, cassie. Come here.",
        "Cassie: You're only hugging me to hide your disappointment.",
        "Edmund: No. No, I'm not. I'm not. And you never have to apologize to me for anything.",
        "Cassie: I hope I never have to. Do you know how much I love you? How much I want to have your baby?",
        "Edmund: I think I have a pretty good idea.",
        "Cassie: I would never do anything to jeopardize us. Never.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, there's nothing you could ever do to jeopardize what we have.",
        "Cassie: You say that now.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, what we have is perfect. It's perfect. We will not lose faith and we will have a child.",
        "Cassie: God, edmund, if you ever lost faith in me...",
        "Edmund: Don't worry. I won'T. I can'T.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs )",
        "Edmund: Come on. Let's go home.",
        "Cassie: Okay. I have to run one quick errand and then I'll meet you back at the house, okay?",
        "Edmund: No. No errands. I want you with me. I want you by my side.",
        "Cassie: I'm going to be by your side all night long, and if you're nice to me, I may... ( whispers )",
        "Edmund: Okay, that worked.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Edmund: Um, yeah. So, you take your time. Look, cassie, our baby is going to come when our baby is good and ready.",
        "Cassie: Wow. \"Our baby.\" I really like the sound of that.",
        "Dinah: Hey. So, what would my friend have to do to get pregnant if she was having trouble?",
        "Corey: Well, it depends on the kind of trouble. But in a normal course of action, we'd start with fertility meds, and then in a lot of cases, artificial insemination.",
        "Dinah: And if that didn't work?",
        "Corey: Well, we always could go for in vitro fertilization. If she's a good candidate.",
        "Dinah: And what are the odds of that working?",
        "Corey: Well, it depends on a lot of factors: Age, egg quality. And these days, in a healthy woman, the odds are very high.",
        "Dinah: My goodness. Modern medicine is incredible.",
        "Corey: Ivf really is science. The timing, the dosage of shots. It's very precise.",
        "Dinah: So a lot could go wrong?",
        "Corey: Well, I don't want to say wrong.",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what? She is just going to have to make sure that everything goes exactly right.",
        "Buzz: Gentlemen, this is private property.",
        "Camera person: Move in closer so I can get...",
        "Reporter: Isn't this now lizzie spaulding's property?",
        "Camera person: Come on, it's a free country.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, and I served this country when you were a gleam in your mother's eye.",
        "Harley: Hey. Get that microphone out of my son'S... ( arguing loudly )",
        "Buzz: Get out of here. Out! If I catch one of you within 100 paces of this place, I promise you I'm going to break every single...",
        "Lizzie: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! It's bad press for the restaurant.",
        "Coop: Are you guys okay?",
        "Zach: Are you okay, mommy?",
        "Harley: I'm fine, sweetie. They just surprised me, that's all.",
        "Coop: Hey, zach. Look, I promise you from now on you're going to have personal protection.",
        "Harley: Thank you, thank you.",
        "Buzz: Let's get you that chocolate sundae. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: Well, speaking of business, I've got a meeting over at spaulding, so I'm sure you and coop can hold down the restaurant for me?",
        "Buzz: Oh, we'll muddle through somehow.",
        "Lizzie: Good.",
        "Buzz: Come on, let's get some sweet stuff.",
        "Harley: Thanks, dad. And wash his hands from that stuff.",
        "Coop: Look, I know that this has got to be tough for you right now, but I promise you everything is going to be okay, all right?",
        "Harley: We're fine. Really, we are. We're fine.",
        "Coop: I just... I'm surprised lizzie didn't throw you to those wolvew, considering how badly gus came down on her the other day.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Coop: Uh, nothing. Nothing.",
        "Harley: Spill it.",
        "Coop: All right, but harley, you're really not going to like hearing this, okay? Come on. Come on.",
        "Alan: I've already lost one son, gus, and I don't want to lose another.",
        "Gus: ( Sighs ) this is not about family, alan. This is about the family business, isn't it? Well, let me tell you something. I will take care of my spaulding responsibilities as soon as i clear harley's name. Okay? So, up until then, you can run the business. You're quite capable of doing it.",
        "Alan: Of course I can run the business, but the question is, do I want to? And I don't without my son. Even phillip understood that.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, I'm sure he didn't quite agree with the concept, did he?",
        "Alexandra: No, we didn't always agree, but we made it work. That's the truth of it.",
        "Gus: And how's that been going for the family?",
        "Alan: Gus, in a few minutes that door will open and we will be discussing the future of spaulding-- my future, your future and quite possibly harley's future.",
        "Gus: Oh, alan, please. Don't try to sell me or stop me or stall me from what I know i have to do right now.",
        "Alan: Everyone, please, please come in.",
        "Gus: Please, alan, I don't have time for this now.",
        "Olivia: Excuse me, we don't even know why we're here.",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, I'm so sorry that...",
        "Alan: It's all right, elizabeth. Why don't you just go over there and stand next to your uncle gus, huh?",
        "Lizzie: I'm not going near that psycho.",
        "Beth: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Please don't let him near me. Please.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, why are you so upset?",
        "Lizzie: He threatened me. He said he'd throw me under a bus if it came to harley. ( Gasps )",
        "Beth: Okay. I know that this has been a trying time for all of us, but let's not turn against one another.",
        "Lizzie: No! No, no, no. Look what he did to my arm.",
        "Olivia: Fall off your bike, did you?",
        "Alan: Gus, did you do this?",
        "Gus: Does it really matter what I say? Do you care about the truth?",
        "Alan: Answer my question.",
        "Gus: Look at me, alan! You know me so well? Would I ever do anything to deliberately hurt your granddaughter? Would I?",
        "Alan: Sweetheart, perhaps that was just a misunderstanding or something.",
        "Lizzie: No. I don't think so. He grabbed my arm!",
        "Alan: Your mother is right. Now, we've all been through some trying times lately, but your uncle gus is where he belongs, at this table as ceo of spaulding. And like it or not, we're all where we belong, in this family.",
        "Lizzie: He doesn't care about the family. The only thing he cares about is harley.",
        "Gus: That's right! That's all I care about. You got a problem with that, huh?",
        "Alan: Gus, please, please, please.",
        "Gus: Fine! Fine.",
        "Alan: Enough with the agenda and the accusations toward each other. Gus is in charge of this meeting, and in that spirit, i am going to turn this meeting over to him.",
        "Gus: Oh, good. Fantastic. Okay. Well, for my first official pronouncement over this thing, let me say, \"I quit.\"",
        "Harley: So, lizzie says that gus physically manhandled her? He was pushing around a little girl? No, I don't think so.",
        "Coop: Harley, I saw the marks on her arm.",
        "Harley: I don't care. So there are marks on her arm. That doesn't prove anything. Let me teach you something. You need a lot more back-story on miss lizzie spaulding before you can claim that anything she says is remotely true.",
        "Coop: I'm not saying that what gus did wasn't intentional. If it was, that makes things a hell of a lot worse. I'm just saying that when it comes to you right now, he's a little out of control.",
        "Harley: Gus is the only person who actually believes I'm innocent.",
        "Coop: No one in this family thinks you're guilty, harley.",
        "Harley: Dad does. Frank arrested me. And you don't know what to think. You're all just hoping for the best, okay? But gus is actually out there fighting for me.",
        "Buzz: I gave you a shot at running. Fighting is not the only alternative. O'neill offered you a plea deal.",
        "Coop: No. No pleas.",
        "Buzz: He's just trying to help. It's a good deal. You plead to a lesser charge, you get out in two years, spend the rest of your life with the kids. I mean, I talked to gus. He's tilting at windmills out there. Come on. I mean, think of all the years you can save.",
        "Harley: You're telling me to take the da's offer?",
        "Buzz: Well, it's better than giving away the rest of your life.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Ah, dr. Sheehan.",
        "Dr. Sheehan: Mr. Winslow. I'm sorry you didn't get the news you were hoping for.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Thank you. I suppose we'll just keep on trying.",
        "Dr. Sheehan: Well, we'll sit down and discuss the option of in vitro.",
        "Edmund: When would you like to start?",
        "Dr. Sheehan: Well, it all depends on mrs. Winslow's cycle, but the sooner the better.",
        "Edmund: All right, good. Good. We'll call you either way.",
        "Dr. Sheehan: Great.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Dinah? Were you listening in? No, please, please don'T... don't answer that. I don't want to hear your lies. But while you've got me here, are there any other medical secrets-- any other private medical secrets-- you'd like to know about me and my wife?",
        "Cassie: Oh. Oh, god, edmund, I wish I could say I was disappointed, but... ( sighs ) I want a baby with you, but if it would have been jonathan'S... ( sighs ) ( knock at door )",
        "Jeffrey: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Can I come in? Thanks. Listen, I'm sorry, but cassie, we need to talk. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Alan: Oh, you're fighting the good fight, aren't you?",
        "Gus: You're damn straight i am.",
        "Alan: Yeah, well, I wonder if harley will admire those qualities of yours when she's rotting in jail, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: He wants to know everything. It's driving him nuts. All you've got to do is just tell him. Tell him the truth and be done with it.",
        "Dinah: You know, I have better things to do with my time than speculate about your life, eddie.",
        "Edmund: Really? Then why aren't you doing them?",
        "Dinah: Because I'm here to see my doctor? Dr. Corey butler. And whether you believe it or not, the world does not revolve around you or even cassie. Everybody knows you're seeing a fertility specialist. It's a small town. And you know what? I wish you all the luck in the world.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm glad to see your doctor is prescribing you nice and happy pills.",
        "Dinah: Oh, no. No. And when I said I was \"seeing\" the doctor, I meant I was seeing my man, who happens to be a doctor.",
        "Edmund: Oh, dinah. You landed a doctor. Your mother must be very proud.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. He's what all the girls dream of.",
        "Edmund: What? Warm hands and a big wallet?",
        "Dinah: You're funny. You're funny, edmund. No, I think that this is actually a new beginning for me.",
        "Edmund: Hm. You know, I never thought of you with a healer, but given all the wreckage that's usually left in your wake, I can see how a doctor would come in handy.",
        "Dinah: Look who's talking, shovel boy. Actually, I think that this newfound attitude of mine is all thanks to you.",
        "Edmund: Me? Why?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Because I think a lesser man would have dumped cassie when she nearly walked away from your wedding. But you, you hung in there. You showed her that you can completely trust somebody, no matter if inside of you, you're totally screaming that you're a damn fool.",
        "Cassie: Sorry.",
        "Jeffrey: What's the problem?",
        "Cassie: No problem. ( Laughs ) I mean, everything's amazing. I just came back from the doctor.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, so you're...",
        "Cassie: Pregnant. No. No.",
        "Jeffrey: You're not? Okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: No. The doctor said it's a little setback, but just keep trying and trying again, so...",
        "Jeffrey: There you go. Good for you. Are you sure there's nothing else?",
        "Cassie: No. I just got my life back, that's all.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm glad to hear that. That's great.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. I'm just, like, a mess, you know? I'm all over the place these days, so...",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I can see that.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so what's your story. What are you doing here? You were so adamant about keeping your distance and staying out of my life. Yet you just dropped by, so...",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm trying. I've been trying, anyway, to stay out of your life. As a matter of fact, since the wedding, I've washed my hands of it completely, mrs. Winslow.",
        "Cassie: But here you are.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, here I am. Because your husband keeps dragging me back in.",
        "Harley: Don't you think i have thought about pleading guilty and taking the deal?",
        "Coop: Quitting? That's really good.",
        "Buzz: It's not quitting. It's not quitting.",
        "Harley: A million times i have thought about just ending this thing. For the kids. For me. For gus. But how do I do that, dad? How do I admit that I pulled the trigger on phillip when I don't even know for sure I did that. How do I do it to zach?",
        "Buzz: You have to do what is the best for you.",
        "Harley: I know what you think. I know what everybody thinks. Because I think it, too, okay? But until I know for sure, until I can look at myself in the mirror and say, \"yeah, you did it, yeah, you did it, you did it, you are that kind of person,\" until I can say that and until I have to tell zach something, I will die before i tell him this. No way.",
        "Buzz: Honey, I'm working with the tools I've got here. I've got to make sense of this on the fly.",
        "Coop: We all are.",
        "Buzz: But one thing I do know is that you have to deal with the gus issue.",
        "Harley: I don't want to talk about gus. Okay? Gus is doing what gus has to do.",
        "Buzz: I admire passion and commitment, but somebody has to control that man.",
        "Harley: Control him? Why?",
        "Coop: Well, right now he's hurting more than he's helping, harley.",
        "Harley: He cares about me.",
        "Buzz: Maybe a little too much. He's not the only person in town that loves you.",
        "Coop: Yeah. And the way that he came down on lizzie the other day, I mean, that's only going to make things worse with alan.",
        "Buzz: Alan has this town ready to burn you at the stake. I mean, you think the tv crew just happened to show up today? That was just a taste of what you're going to get?",
        "Harley: Okay. Okay. I can handle the media.",
        "Buzz: Can you handle reporters shoving cameras in zach's face?",
        "Reporter: Hey. That looks like a good ice cream.",
        "Harley: Okay. You're right about that. I have to protect my son. There's only one way to do that.",
        "Gus: This is yours. These are all yours. The brown ones, and these blue ones are mine, okay?",
        "Alan: You can't quit this company, gus.",
        "Gus: I did just quit. See, if you don't understand why I'm doing what I've got to do, well, then I should have really left here a long time ago.",
        "Alan: Do you realize what will happen if you walk away from this family and pursue this obsession to clear harley?",
        "Gus: I don't know. What's going to happen? I get cut out of the will? It's okay. I'll live. See, because the job that phillip left me, I never really wanted it in the first place. All of this is yours. You take it.",
        "Alan: If you walk, you will not only lose your job, you will lose this family and you will not be welcome in this house.",
        "Gus: I don't care, alan, because I'm not after your money, like olivia here.",
        "Olivia: Hey.",
        "Bill: Leave her out of this.",
        "Gus: This is my pen. This is my pen. And I don't feel sorry for you like beth, or lost without you like alexandra here, or really searching for your love and attention and approval all the time like poor phillip used to do, because that's not me. Okay?",
        "Alan: You had better think very seriously about what you're giving up.",
        "Gus: I don't have to think about anything, alan, because i get it. You see, this is one of those moments, one of those \"oh my it\" moments. That's what this is.",
        "Olivia: You know what? This seems like one of those epic father-son struggles that we really don't need to be here for, so...",
        "Bill: Yeah, maybe we should go.",
        "Beth: Alan, maybe we should leave.",
        "Alan: No, beth, I don't want anyone to leave this room. As a matter of fact, I want you all to bear witness...",
        "Gus: Oh, god, I hate this part the most. Can't you just be yourself for once? Do you even know who that is? Just for once in your life, be alan spaulding.",
        "Alan: You will be without a job, without an inheritance, without credit and the only cash you will have is the cash in your wallet right now.",
        "Alexandra: Alan... alan, are you sure you want to say this?",
        "Gus: You want the money from my wallet? Here, take it. Take all the money, all the power, take all the paperwork, because I can'T... you take the water pitcher, okay?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on.",
        "Gus: Have this, because i hate paperwork. Man, you used to love watching your son just run around and around after his tail. You loved that. I'm not going to do that for you!",
        "Alan: Yes. Harley will be in prison and you won't even have enough money to ah, but you don't need money, do you? No, you've got love. You're the only man in the world who's ever experienced that emotion, huh? That passion, that valor. Oh, you're fighting the good fight, aren't you?",
        "Gus: You're damn straight i am.",
        "Alan: Yeah, well, I wonder if harley will admire those qualities of yours when she's rotting in jail, huh?",
        "Beth: Lizzie.",
        "Alan: There are serious consequences to the choice you're about to make, and you'd better think about what's at stake here, gus.",
        "Gus: I know exactly what's at stake, okay? Harley's freedom is at stake. In fact, my freedom is at stake.",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Alan: Not your freedom.",
        "Gus: If I stay here, dad, and take this chair, I'm going to just end up a picture on the wall like granddad or beth and lizzie, even you. Okay?",
        "Alan: And what's wrong with that?",
        "Olivia: Ooh. Oh, oh, I can field that one.",
        "Alan: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Okay, look, gus, when you say you're quitting, do you mean that you're just... you're gone?",
        "Gus: Olivia, you can have whatever you want. All right? You and your boyfriend there, you can pick up all the scraps, anything you can stomach.",
        "Alan: Get the hell out of here.",
        "Gus: The buffet is open!",
        "Alan: You're not fit to sit in phillip's ghair because you're not half the man that phillip was. In fact, you're a loser, gus. You always have been. I hope harley's worth it, because she's all you've got left. And when she's rotting in prison, you will have nothing! Nothing! Do you hear me?",
        "Harley: Listen, mommy has to spend some time away.",
        "Zach: Where?",
        "Harley: Well, while you stay here with grandpa and uncle frank and everybody, I am going to trick those loud, shouty people so they follow me. That way they won't bother you. So, mommy's going to have to be a dragon-slayer for a while. But I need you to be my trusty sidekick, you know? My buddy. And that means I need you to stay here and, you know, keep an eye on grandpa and coop and everybody. I mean, I know it's a big job, but you're the only one who can help me. Can I count on you?",
        "Zach: Yes, mommy. I'm not afraid of anything.",
        "Harley: You know what? Neither was your dad.",
        "Cassie: Edmund keeps dragging you back into what things?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, he wants to know some things, cassie. He wants to know what I know about you. He wants to know what we were talking about together in the park that day, the day of your wedding. Why you ran, why you came back. He wants to know everything. It's driving him nuts. So I tell him, \"well, why don't you just ask her, edmund. Why don't you just ask your wife.\" Of course, I know that his wife isn't talking, is she? Because, well, that's just not the way she is. That's not what she does. Maybe full disclosure doesn't, you know, come easily for...",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Jeffrey: ...Her. He's not going to give up, you know. Not until he knows. Not until he knows what's on your mind or at least what was on your mind before you married him. You didn't play this scenario out all the way through, did you? No. You thought that it was all going to just stop and go away once you said, \"I do\"?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't you know the man that you married, cassie?",
        "Cassie: Yes, I know the man i married.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then you know that he's not going to stop until he finds out, right?",
        "Cassie: What do you want me to do, jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: Tell him. Just... why don't you just tell him the truth?",
        "Cassie: Everything will be fine in time. Okay? Things will be fine.",
        "Jeffrey: You've got to pick yourself up off the floor. You can do this. Your friend harley can do it. Look at her. She's facing a murder rap, but she's standing up, right? She's standing up and facing the music even though she may have killed somebody.",
        "Cassie: She didn't kill someone, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, the point is this, cassie. She's standing up. She's facing the music. She can do it. Now it's your turn. All you've got to do is just tell him. Tell him the truth and be done with it. Okay. Goodbye.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, as much as i would like to stick around and prove you wrong about everything... goodbye.",
        "Dinah: Aren't you going to wish me luck on my new man?",
        "Edmund: Right. Right. And if it doesn't work out, here's hoping this one doesn't leave your life feet first.",
        "Dinah: I don't know. Maybe I haven't found the right guy yet. But maybe this one... this one might work.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'll keep my fingers crossed.",
        "Dinah: Believe it or not, i hope you have a baby in your future. Just as long as it's not cassie'S. Ooh. This could come in handy.",
        "Corey: Dinah? What are you doing with my prescription pad?",
        "Dinah: I was going to write you a note.",
        "Corey: On my scrip pad?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Is that a bad idea?",
        "Corey: Well, it's kind of, sort of against the law.",
        "Dinah: Oh. It is? ( Laughs ) oh, okay. Well, then, in that case, is it against the law to be totally and utterly into a guy?",
        "Corey: Excuse me?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Corey: \"You are the prescription for what ails my life, dinah.\"",
        "Dinah: Corny, I know. Turn it over.",
        "Corey: A cell and a home number. I'm sorry. I just don't get this kind of thing happening to me that much. You are so beautiful.",
        "Dinah: Thank you, doc. Thank you. You know, the truth is, I really don't care about prescriptions or the law. I just... I wanted you to have my number. And with your work and schedule, I was just afraid you might forget about me.",
        "Corey: Dinah, I could never forget about you. Ever.",
        "Dinah: Well, I just... i didn't want to take my chances with you.",
        "Corey: Dinah? My prescription pad?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) oh. See? You make me so screwy. ( Laughs ) bye. Ooh.",
        "Cassie: You've got to tell him. All of it. All of it. Jeffrey's right. We love each other too much to be crushed by... ( car pulls into driveway ) okay, here we go. Hi.",
        "Edmund: Hi. Hi.",
        "Cassie: I'm so glad you're home.",
        "Edmund: I'm glad you missed me.",
        "Cassie: I did. I missed you so much.",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, cassie. Come here.",
        "Cassie: Oh, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie. Cassie. I spoke with dr. Sheehan and he wants us to meet with him about ivf, and he can give us an appointment as early as tomorrow.",
        "Cassie: Tomorrow?",
        "Edmund: I know, I know. It's soon. It's soon. And in vitro fertilization is not the most romantic thing on the face of the planet, but it can be if you think about what can come from it.",
        "Cassie: You're right. Yeah, you're right.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, nothing-- nothing-- is going to prevent us from having a child. Nothing and no one.",
        "Cassie: Why would you think that someone...",
        "Edmund: Cassie, if anyone even looked at you the wrong way, I would snap their neck. I would unleash hell for you. I'm just... I'm just stating it clearly to the heavens. We will not be denied.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, we want to make a baby, we don't want to go to war.",
        "Edmund: All right, maybe i got a little carried away.",
        "Cassie: But you wouldn't kill someone for looking at me wrong?",
        "Edmund: Well, maybe not for looking.",
        "Cassie: You would kill someone for me?",
        "Edmund: ( Laughs ) of course. So, what did you want to tell me?",
        "Cassie: Um, that... I just wanted to tell you that finding out today that we weren't pregnant, it was hard. It was a blow. But I love you. And tonight, I just want to make love with my husband, and if a baby comes out of that, fine, great. I just want to make love with my husband.",
        "Edmund: My god. What would I do without you?",
        "Olivia: Well, that was biblical. I mean, alan is this powerful king who loses one son and then the other, and now his kingdom. I mean, I almost feel sorry for the guy.",
        "Bill: I know. I know. A lot of tough breaks. First phillip, and now gus, hm? Better him than me, right? ( Laughs )",
        "Olivia: Yes. ( Laughs ) I mean, come on, this is all yours for the taking! What's our next move, bill?",
        "Bill: Next move? What do you mean? You won. You wanted to take spaulding down. Well, we did it.",
        "Olivia: Oh, that's just the beginning. Now we have to move in for the kill. So, what do you say? You want to do it on the boardroom table?",
        "Bill: You are insatiable, woman.",
        "Olivia: Yeah. I am.",
        "Beth: Lizzie, I don't like this. You're trying to pick up the gauntlet for your father and fight his battles.",
        "Lizzie: So what if I am?",
        "Beth: Not all of his battles were worth fighting.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, there's a difference, okay? Dad was crazy. I mean, no matter what anyone says in this town, I am not crazy. And I can fight, and fighting's a lot better than hurting. And hurting is a lot better when you know you're hurting the other guy.",
        "Alexandra: I used to look so forward to coming here, seeing buzz, everyone. Now when I take a look, I just see another place we've touched and turned to ashes.",
        "Alan: Like my sons.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, god. I didn't say that, alan. I would never... well, soon, when I work off my time in the mail room, I'll be right back upstairs working with you.",
        "Alan: I'm not sure I will need you, alexandra. I don't need gus, phillip, amanda, alan-michael, elizabeth. I can run this company by myself and I will.",
        "Alexandra: Will you just stop roaring? Alan, just stand there, will you, and let it hurt.",
        "Alan: Why do I keep losing them, alexandra? Why? Standing in the spotlight like an angel with a halo when I thought I'd never see your face again, I swore this was the end doesn't matter what you did or didn't do baby, I still burn for you you're all I ever need you bring me to my knees and god only knows what you see in me I pray I can be all you want me to be and the lights shine brighter the air gets sweeter when you walk into the room I fall deeper time stands still and I feel like flying when you walk into the room and you're not even trying love came out of nowhere you were like a shooting star I was mesmerized by the way you moved in your eyes I saw the truth it seems we got a second chance we've got to hold the future in our hands it's a miracle, that's what it is when you find a love like this god only knows where we go from here when I look in your eyes well it's perfectly clear the lights shine brighter the air gets sweeter when you walk into the room I fall deeper time stands still and I feel like flying when you walk into the room you're not even trying... ( cell phone rings )",
        "Gus: This is gus. Call me back. You changed everything for me, yeah... ( cell phone ringing )",
        "Harley: I'm not available right now, but leave a message. And don't forget your phone number. Gus, where are you? The lights shine brighter the air gets sweeter when you walk into the room...",
        "Gus: Good night, harley.",
        "Harley: Good night, gus. ...I fall deeper time stands still... Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Olivia: In the meantime, you have to find somebody to take gus' place, to run spaulding at your side.",
        "Alan: If you will excuse me, I need to find that replacement for phillip and gus.",
        "Olivia: She's standing right in front of you.",
        "Jonathan: Reva, your minivan days are over.",
        "Reva: Uh-oh. What have you done?"
