        "Alan: It's morning. We're still here and so is he.",
        "Gus: He? Who? Oh, the person outside?",
        "Alan: Yeah, yeah. Someone's cooking and it smells really good.",
        "Gus: This is a really lousy bed and breakfast.",
        "Beth: See? All those years living on the house on the hill hasn't turned me into a completely helpless society woman. My mother taught me how to keep house. Those are the tools that will always come in handy. I should call and thank her right now. Maybe not. I wonder if Alan will like what I've prepared. I've never cooked for him before. Phillip always liked it when I cooked. Um, it's funny, you know, all those good, basic, working-class skills, those are the reasons Alan thought I wasn't good enough for Phillip. Well, I wonder if he'll appreciate what I have to offer now. ( Banging ) Coming. Oh, I'm coming.",

        "Harley: Oh, what did I do?",
        "Buzz: I hate to run you ragged, but I'm going to have to anyway. Will you drop this off at table five? Excuse me. Go over to Co2 and ask Ava if the refrigerator guy ever showed up. And I need the receipts from last night.",
        "Waitress: No problem. Be back in a few. Hi, Ms. Lewis.",
        "Olivia: Hi, Amanda.",
        "Amanda: Your usual?",
        "Buzz: I got it, I got it. Cappuccino. Extra cream, and extra sugar.",
        "Amanda: He's got it.",
        "Buzz: I got it.",
        "Amanda: Thanks.",
        "Olivia: Am I predictable?",
        "Buzz: Oh, never.",
        "Olivia: I also need a large, black coffee.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Buzz: Josh!",
        "Josh: Hey. Olivia. Buzz, how are you?",
        "Buzz: The usual, two coffees to go to the office?",
        "Josh: Please. Thank you.",
        "Olivia: So how do you think Reva's first day at the office will go?",
        "Josh: Actually I haven't the faintest idea. I just know I have to get over there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wanda: We'll be expecting your call at 2:00 for a conference call.",
        "Reva: Boo! ( Laughter )",
        "Wanda: Reva? You're so precious. It's so great to see you back here, girl.",
        "Reva: It's not the same without me, huh?",
        "Wanda: Nothing is. Look what came here for you.",
        "Reva: Oh. Joshua. So sweet.",
        "Billy: Josh is not sweet enough to send you flowers, but...",
        "Reva: You?",
        "Billy: I may be on a definite leave, but I am not going to miss your triumphant return.",
        "Wanda: You never sent me flowers, Billy Lewis.",
        "Billy: Well, darling, tell you what, you can share. You can put them in water. See you later.",
        "Reva: What am I doing here?",
        "Billy: I don't know.",
        "Reva: I just didn't like the idea of Olivia being here walking all over sacred Lewis ground.",
        "Billy: With sacred Lewis men.",
        "Reva: When did this happen, Billy? When did I start playing defense?",
        "Billy: I don't know, but maybe it's time for Ms. Shane to go back on the offensive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: These are really sweet. Thank you. Thanks for thinking of me and making copies like that.",
        "Blake: Yep, just trying to keep busy.",
        "Dinah: So are you okay?",
        "Blake: Me? Sure, I'm good. You?",
        "Dinah: Good.",
        "Blake: Good? Dinah, you're not good; you're happy. Actually, you're more than that. You look glowing.",
        "Dinah: Well, this is the first caffeine of the day.",
        "Blake: No, no, no. Trust me, Dinah, I've never seen you look this glowy.",
        "Dinah: Well that would be impossible. You know I'm doing 26 hours at Spaulding Enterprises, you know, covering for Harley.",
        "Blake: How is Mallet?",
        "Dinah: Just as annoying as the last time we spoke about him.",
        "Blake: So that's girl talk for \"I still really like him and things are going good between the two of us\"?",
        "Dinah: Oh, whatever.",
        "Blake: Well, whatever. Fine, I'll ask him out myself when I see him.",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Blake: Tell me, what's going on?",
        "Dinah: Why? So you can go report back to Daddy?",
        "Blake: Yeah. But... okay. Actually, I'm really curious.",
        "Dinah: Okay, fine. We saw each other last night, and then he had to take off. That's it.",
        "Blake: That's not good.",
        "Dinah: You know what, it's not anything. It's not anything, and it's especially a no-strings thing.",
        "Blake: What, so that gives him permission to just disappear?",
        "Dinah: Look, Blake, he's a cop. We know what that means. He has to head up the informants that he gets and the leads he gets, and I don't know where he ends up, but the point is he will be back.",
        "Blake: For your sake, I hope you're right.",
        "Dinah: Look, he drives me crazy, that old Mallet, but the one thing I know for sure is that he's loyal. I do know that for sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I've got to get out of here.",
        "Mallet: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down; it's all right, don't panic. Everything's going to be all right.",
        "Harley: It is not all right. Are you crazy?",
        "Mallet: Harley...",
        "Harley: We should not have done this. What kind of wife am I? Don't answer that.",
        "Mallet: Listen to me.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. I find out that my husband is dead, and the first thing I do is crawl into... I don't even want to think about it.",
        "Mallet: Just stop. Stop, stop. It just happened. It happened in a moment of grief.",
        "Harley: It doesn't matter. Mallet, he's my husband.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, Harley he is, and he's gone.",
        "Reva: \"Olivia Lewis.\" She still uses the name.",
        "Billy: Believe me, I hate that more than you do.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, Josh doesn't seem to mind.",
        "Billy: Hey, look. Reva, if you want to get rid of Olivia, all you have to do is tell Josh how she set me up to take a drink. That'll do it.",
        "Reva: No. As much as I want to take her sorry butt, I'm better than that and I'm better than her.",
        "Billy: You're definitely better than her. So you want out?",
        "Reva: I thought so at first, but now that I've been here for a while and walking around, I kind of like being here again.",
        "Billy: Yeah, I know that feeling.",
        "Reva: Hey, you're going to be back. You're already on your way.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Yep.",
        "Reva: Yes, every day sober is another day closer. I'm personally going to see to it that you're back in all of your glory.",
        "Billy: My glory days are long gone.",
        "Reva: Not really. Billy? Come on! I remember when Billy Lewis was the king!",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah, yeah.",
        "Reva: Nobody did it better than you, or with more style.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, I think my kingdom's falling on some hard times.",
        "Reva: Maybe, but I know for a fact that it's just a matter of time before the king returns.",
        "Billy: When I hear you say it, I almost believe it. ( Laughter )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Yeah, she has that effect on a lot of people.",
        "Buzz: Sorry for the delay. The espresso machine is on the fritz. Everything is on the fritz these days.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry about Gus. I don't know what to say.",
        "Buzz: No one does.",
        "Olivia: How is Harley holding up?",
        "Buzz: When she's here, she's not here. She's not even here most of the time.",
        "Olivia: If there is anything I can do, I will.",
        "Buzz: Thank you.",
        "Olivia: I can't imagine what it must be like to watch your daughter suffer like that.",
        "Buzz: I don't think age makes any difference when it comes to things like that.",
        "Olivia: Still, it makes you wonder...",
        "Buzz: About?",
        "Olivia: Nothing. I don't want to be insensitive.",
        "Buzz: I can take it.",
        "Olivia: It just makes you wonder if it's even worth falling in love. You put so much into somebody who may not even stick around. You invest everything only to have your heart ripped out of your chest.",
        "Buzz: I lost Nadine, and I lost Jenna, and I actually thought that I might die from the pain myself. Every moment's a new hell. Every breath you take is poison in your lungs. I wouldn't give it up for the world. Harley loved and was loved. It's worth it.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I think so, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You know, this could be poison.",
        "Alan: Yeah, true.",
        "Gus: I'm so hungry, though. Maybe I should take this little bugger right here. It would stop the screaming in my leg.",
        "Alan: Well, if you go down, we go down together. Eat up.",
        "Gus: I can't stay here. I have to get home to my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: How could this have happened?",
        "Mallet: It happened. It just happened.",
        "Harley: Please stop saying that.",
        "Mallet: Look, it's... you turned to me last night, okay? You turned to someone that understands you, that you're familiar with, and that... I don't know, that you feel safe with. That's nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "Harley: It was wrong, Mallet. It was wrong, okay? Where is my other shoe? This is the shoe I wore on my wedding day.",
        "Mallet: It's not about being unfaithful to Gus or his memory.",
        "Harley: Well, what is it then?",
        "Mallet: Well, maybe you just wanted to stop hurting, okay? Maybe just kill the pain for a little bit, just for a little while. All right? It's comfort. It's comfort, all right, for one night. It doesn't have to happen again.",
        "Harley: It can't. Okay? It can't. I'm serious because we have lives that we have to get back to, you know. I, for one, have to... I have to face the future without Gus. And let's face it, Mallet, you have Dinah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: So, could Mallet have gone off to see Harley last night?",
        "Dinah: Well, that's entirely possible. This whole situation is a mess.",
        "Blake: So what is the Mallet- Harley situation?",
        "Dinah: You know what? I've got to go. Thank you, though, for the pictures. I appreciate it.",
        "Blake: Dinah, I get it. You're happy.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I'm happy. You tell Daddy that, okay?",
        "Blake: I really see that you are. Dinah, you remind me of me when I fell in love with your dad. Maybe your instincts are right. Maybe Mallet is a loyal guy. Go for it, Dinah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: All right, it probably wasn't smart, okay? But I don't believe in beating ourselves up because you just wanted your pain to go away for just a little while.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I did. No, I did. I did.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, so... I just want you to stop hurting, all right? I just want you to be okay. Are you okay?",
        "Harley: I'm not crazy, you know that, right?",
        "Mallet: You're not crazy.",
        "Harley: You were right, I can't.... I couldn't be alone on my first night without him, and I needed somebody, and you were there. And we're friends, and we like each other and we have a history together...",
        "Mallet: And that's all it was. Okay, that's all it is. That's it, end of story.",
        "Harley: Great, great. So we can forget it ever happened, right?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, we can do that.",
        "Harley: Where is my other shoe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Would you watch what you're doing?",
        "Beth: Maybe you should watch out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't leave. Don't leave.",
        "Harley: I kind of think we're done here.",
        "Mallet: Harley...",
        "Harley: Look, I know it happened. I do. I accept what happened, but there's stuff I have to do, so please, could you get your hand off the door?",
        "Mallet: Why don't you eat something, especially now. Why don't you keep your strength up, all right?",
        "Harley: You know what I need to do right now? I need to go home. And I need to tell my kids. I need to tell my kids that Gus isn't coming back.",
        "Mallet: Are you ready for that?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Mallet: You've got to be clear and calm. You've got to be on top of your game so they can lean on somebody. Only the thing is, maybe you need to lean on somebody yourself.",
        "Harley: I'm fine.",
        "Mallet: You are not fine. Let me take you to breakfast, and then I'll drop you off.",
        "Harley: ( Laughing )",
        "Mallet: Harley, I'm just trying to help you.",
        "Harley: I don't need that kind of help anymore. I'm sorry.",
        "Mallet: It's all right. No, it's fine.",
        "Harley: What I'm saying to you is, can we please not talk about this right now, please?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. All right, you got everything? You got your purse? Good. Got your shoe?",
        "Harley: If we're going to go, can we just go?",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: A little feisty, aren't we today, Beth?",
        "Beth: I just don't have time for people who get in my way anymore.",
        "Dinah: You talking about my position at Spaulding?",
        "Beth: Your position at Spaulding. Everybody has a position at Spaulding.",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh. Except you.",
        "Beth: Right.",
        "Dinah: You know what? I am not looking to start anything. I understand you probably are going through quite a bit with Alan...",
        "Beth: What about Alan?",
        "Dinah: He's your husband. I imagine with Gus being missing, you're probably concerned.",
        "Beth: Yes, well, thank you for your concern.",
        "Dinah: Let me help you with...",
        "Beth: No, no. That's fine. Bye, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You'd better be getting to the office; your coffee's getting cold.",
        "Olivia: I like it here. It's safe.",
        "Buzz: Safe?",
        "Olivia: This is Reva's first day at the office, and it's going to be a battle. I don't want to do it.",
        "Buzz: You were never the kind of girl to shy away from that?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, that was before I developed cracks in my armor.",
        "Buzz: There's nothing wrong with a crack or two. It lets people in.",
        "Olivia: It lets people get to your flaws and vulnerabilities.",
        "Buzz: There's nothing wrong with those, either. I'll warm up your coffee, and you can be on your way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Well, I should have Wanda take a picture of the three of us. We haven't been in this office together for quite a while.",
        "Billy: I'm not staying here long.",
        "Josh: No, no, actually, I'd appreciate it if you would stay because I'd like your input on a few things, so...",
        "Billy: I'll wait until I'm back fully, okay?",
        "Reva: Soon, Billy.",
        "Billy: Soon.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Josh: Hi. How does it feel to be back in the saddle?",
        "Reva: Joshua, I want to be honest with you.",
        "Josh: You do?",
        "Reva: I didn't come back here to work because I have this burning desire to get my hands dirty in business again.",
        "Josh: You didn't?",
        "Reva: No, I came back because I was feeling territorial.",
        "Josh: About Lewis Construction?",
        "Reva: And other things.",
        "Josh: Oh, Olivia?",
        "Reva: Good guess. But then I got here and I walked in and I saw Wanda and I saw the name Lewis on the wall, and then of course I saw your daddy's picture and I suddenly realized I didn't want this to be about her.",
        "Josh: Yeah, Reva...",
        "Reva: You're probably going to tell me you don't want me here because you don't want it to get ugly, and you don't have room in the company for someone who is here only to fight with Olivia.",
        "Josh: No, actually, I was going to say I'm glad you're here, because no matter what's going on between the two of us, there's always a place for you here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You know, I felt sorry for Harley. I can't imagine what she's going through right now. Considering everything she has gone through.",
        "Alan: You should have thought about that before you abducted me.",
        "Gus: Are we going to go over this again? I went after you because you were going after her. Now I'm stuck in here with you and this leg. You know, I can take a lot of pain, but this is too much. This is just...",
        "Alan: Why don't you just stop wallowing in your self-pity, Gus?",
        "Gus: I just feel sorry for her and the kids. They probably think I'm never coming back.",
        "Alan: Maybe you're not.",
        "Gus: Will you shut up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Hey, kiddo.",
        "Harley: Hey, Daddy.",
        "Buzz: I was worried about you.",
        "Harley: I'm sorry.",
        "Mallet: Hey, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Sit down, and get something to eat.",
        "Mallet: Thanks, Buzz. It always makes me a little nervous when you don't get to choose.",
        "Harley: I'm not really hungry.",
        "Mallet: But you have to eat.",
        "Harley: Don't do that. You're not my husband anymore.",
        "Dinah: Hey. Oh, sweetie. I'm so sorry about Gus. It must have been awful for the both of you last night.",

        "Tom Pelphrey, inside \"The Light.\" Jonathan wants Tammy and redemption. I think my favorite part of playing the role of Jonathan is making out with Stephanie. It's hard, but I do it, because I'm an artist. A great honor to be part of the longest running show in broadcast history. Just to be a part of anything that big and that has lasted that long with such a history, I think that is really kind of neat. I'm honored. See Jonathan, Wednesday, February 8, inside \"The Light.\"",

        "Dinah: Sweetie, I owe you an apology. I was a jerk on the phone, and I feel awful.",
        "Harley: You don't owe me an apology.",
        "Dinah: Yes, I do. I... I thought that you knew when I spoke to you, and I wouldn't have said anything otherwise. I just... I was wrong.",
        "Harley: No, you weren't. You don't owe me an apology, okay? Last night was really hard, and everything happened so fast. But at least the waiting is over for me, because now we know that... I mean, we feel certain that he's, um... we know that he's gone.",
        "Dinah: Well, it must have been, um.... I don't know. I... I... I don't know what to say. But I am so glad that the two of you had one another at a time like that.",
        "Harley: Yes. Thank you. Thank you both for all of your help through this, but I've got to go.",
        "Dinah: Hey, hey, hey, don't go.",
        "Harley: You know what? Dinah, I... I've got to talk to my kids, and I've got to make, I don't know some sort of arrangements, I'm sure. I don't know.",
        "Dinah: I'll help you. I will help you. I mean, unless that's what you guys want to do together. I mean, if that's why you met last night, to talk about that. But I would love to help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I got the feeling that you were less than thrilled with the idea of my coming aboard.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, call me crazy, but I wasn't exactly looking forward to the idea of you and Olivia having a cat fight in the boardroom.",
        "Reva: It might be fun. 'Cause if I was looking for a fight, I could decimate Olivia! But I'm not going to, I'm not really. I mean, I just want to help. I'm not even talking to my sister, and my son and my niece are tearing this town apart just by being in love. I want to help.",
        "Josh: Well, that's the best thing I've heard you say in quite a while.",
        "Reva: You see, I haven't completely lost my mind. So do you think you have room around here for someone like me?",
        "Josh: Someone like you or you?",
        "Reva: Is there a difference?",
        "Josh: There's a huge difference, Reva, and there are a couple of things we have to get straight between us.",
        "Reva: Not necessarily because this is totally professional. We're both adults enough that we can pull this off without any complications.",
        "Josh: We are.",
        "Reva: You are.",
        "Josh: Okay. Come around. Let me get you up to speed.",
        "Billy: They make a good team, don't they? Even now.",
        "Olivia: If this is the part where you lecture me on Josh and Reva, the greatest love story ever told, don't bother, because I've heard it before. In fact, I've lived it.",
        "Billy: In fact, you've lost it.",
        "Olivia: You know, Billy, you attack me because I've hurt Josh in the past, I've hurt you and Bill, and I understand that. But what about the two of them?",
        "Billy: What about them?",
        "Olivia: Over the years, Reva has caused Josh more pain than I could in five life times, and vice versa. Can you deny that?",

        "Alan: Hey, hey, settle down. You're only making things worse.",
        "Gus: Settle down? I've got to get to my family. They need me, my family. I've come too far... hey! I can't let her down now. ( Groans )",
        "Harley: I, Harley cooper, promise you, Gus Aitoro, that I will love you more and more with every passing day, through the joy and adversity that life throws our way.",
        "Gus: I'm coming home, even if I have to crawl all the way there on my hands and knees.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Hey, hold on!",
        "Harley: I can't... I need air. I can't breathe.",
        "Buzz: I'll walk with you.",
        "Harley: Not this time.",
        "Buzz: Honey, come on. Okay, look, all of us are here, okay, for you every step of the way.",
        "Harley: I know you are.",
        "Buzz: I just... I don't... if there was just something I could say, something, anything, something to make you feel just a tiny bit better. I can't think of a damn thing.",
        "Harley: Just... just... just tell me you miss him as much as I do. Dinah, I'm sorry.",
        "Dinah: Honey, it's okay.",
        "Harley: No, I don't want you to think that I don't... that I don't appreciate everything you have done for me-- the both of you, what you've done for me. I do.",
        "Dinah: Harley...",
        "Harley: But I don't need any more help. I can make the arrangements for Gus by myself, okay? You guys, you need to get back to your life. Really, I don't need any more help.",
        "Mallet: We just care about you, Harley. That's all.",
        "Harley: I know. I know you do. Thank you.",
        "Dinah: If there is anything we can do, just let us know.",
        "Harley: I will, I will. Just be good to each other. Because you never know, do you? I'm going home to my kids, all right?",
        "Mallet: Are you sure you're... you're sure you're okay?",
        "Harley: I will be.",
        "Dinah: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I told you to conserve your energy, Gus. That's the problem with you, you know.",
        "Gus: Why? Because I have a life that I love.",
        "Alan: No, because you risk too much to protect that life.",
        "Gus: I don't think you understand. ( Groans ) I don't think you understand what I've gone through to make it work with my wife.",
        "Alan: Yes, I understand, Gus, but I just don't understand why.",
        "Gus: I think you're just jealous.",
        "Alan: Jealous? Ha! Well, you finally found me out. You know, I've always had a secret crush on Harley.",
        "Gus: No, not jealous of her, jealous of real love. I think that's what you're jealous of, something that you are not capable of giving or receiving. I was completely alone until I met my wife. She filled up my heart.",
        "Alan: Oh!",
        "Gus: ( Groaning )",
        "Alan: Gus, Gus, Gus, take this pain pill. Come on, take it.",
        "Gus: No. I need to stay sharp.",
        "Alan: You need to stay alive. And that pain is zapping every bit of energy. You'll never get back to Harley if you don't take this pill. Take it.",

        "Buzz: Hey!",
        "Beth: Oh!",
        "Buzz: Hey, you're not allowed to bring outside food in. It's a joke! It's like the movies-- you know, you're not allowed to bring...",
        "Beth: Right, right.",
        "Buzz: Sorry, I just... you saw me with Harley.",
        "Beth: Yeah, yeah, I did.",
        "Buzz: I guess that makes you a widow, too?",
        "Beth: I guess it does.",
        "Buzz: Was it love with Alan?",
        "Beth: I had high hopes for our marriage, but it didn't work out the way I wanted it to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: You know, you took great pleasure in threatening to blow me up with Josh.",
        "Billy: Well, I got to admit, I did like seeing you squirm.",
        "Olivia: I don't want to squirm anymore. So if you need to tell Josh that I set you up with alcohol, that I pushed you off the wagon, you do it. Get it over with. I want my life back. Sorry. Sorry I took so long. There was a problem at Company.",
        "Josh: That's okay, don't worry about it.",
        "Olivia: Reva, I should have gotten one for you, too. I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: That's okay. Don't worry about it.",
        "Olivia: So what did I miss?",
        "Reva: Josh was just filling me in on the Keensburg and Millwood projects. You two have been doing some really good work.",
        "Josh: Yeah, you know what? That reminds me, I need to talk to Wanda about this conference call I have later. Excuse me...",
        "Olivia: Sure.",
        "Josh: Wanda...",
        "Olivia: So do me a favor. If you're going to pull my hair, could you do it from the back because I'm trying to grow my bangs out.",
        "Reva: No need to pull your hair. I'm here to work. I have no interest and no need to fight with you.",
        "Olivia: Well, I wouldn't go that far.",
        "Wanda: It's 2:00.",
        "Josh: No, the conference call was at 3:00. I told you...",
        "Wanda: I've got it written down.",
        "Josh: I thought you left.",
        "Billy: Well, I want to have a little chat with you.",
        "Josh: About what?",
        "Billy: I've got something I want to say to you about Olivia.",
        "Olivia: If you took this job because you feel threatened about Josh and me, you should be. We're doing great.",
        "Reva: Is that right?",
        "Olivia: Better than I could have hoped. And I know you and Billy want to send me to a watery grave, but I won't sink that easily.",
        "Reva: Olivia, if I had wanted you gone, you would have been gone months ago. I'm not interested, and I'm not worried because I have my own life.",
        "Olivia: Really? What life is that?",
        "Reva: The one where I am okay with who I am; the one where I have a family I love and a family who loves me; the one where I don't have to throw myself at a man to have self- worth. Can you say the same thing?",
        "Josh: You know what? I really don't want to hear another lecture on Reva or Olivia or anybody else.",
        "Billy: Just close your mouth and listen.",
        "Wanda: Ooh!",
        "Josh: Wanda...",
        "Billy: Wanda, get some water.",
        "Josh: Okay, go.",

        "Mallet: Really? Right back at you.",

        "Beth: Hello, Harley.",
        "Harley: Hi, Beth.",
        "Beth: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you.",
        "Harley: Are you gone? Are you really gone? How am I going to do this? How... how am I going to get through the rest of my life, every day of my life, knowing this? I'm just supposed to say goodbye to you without ever seeing you again? I can't do that. I just can't do that.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Harley: Oh, the poor grieving widow. Stab her in the back while she's down, huh?",
        "Billy: What do you really care? You got the girl.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, but he'd do anything to get her back. He's dangerous. I'm going to put a stop to it.",
        "Billy: No!",
