    "Transcript": [
        "Cassie: When I lived at the beacon, it didn't snow. I had someone there to shovel the walk. Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Dinner is served. Almost.",
        "Cassie: Wow. You've been busy. What is this?",
        "Edmund: Doctor's orders.",
        "Cassie: I don't remember the doctor saying anything about dinner and candlelight.",
        "Edmund: Well, he didn'T. But who says you can't help out modern science with a little old-fashioned romance?",
        "Dinah: Shoot. Somebody would have to do their job. Oh, man. So close, yet so far. All right. Okay. Okay, I can do this.",
        "Corey: Dinah? What are you doing in here?",
        "Olivia: What are you looking at?",
        "Alan: You have three minutes.",
        "Olivia: What is it with you and time limits? You know what? Never mind. You'll change your mind after you hear what I have to say.",
        "Alan: I doubt it.",
        "Olivia: Well, you took the meeting. You might be a tad bit curious.",
        "Alan: Look, I don't have time for games, so would you please?",
        "Olivia: Poor, poor alan. Doing your job and gus'. I feel for you, I really do.",
        "Alan: Well, save it. So, you've come here to gloat about my son walking out on me, is that it?",
        "Olivia: Maybe a little. But I've also come to help.",
        "Bill: What's up, uncle josh.",
        "Josh: Uh, uh, uh. There you go.",
        "Bill: A sugar cube tower.",
        "Josh: I got a little bored waiting for you.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late. Work's been crazy. I was caught up on a conference call.",
        "Josh: No problem. You want to join me for a bite to eat?",
        "Bill: I was supposed to meet olivia later, but I can always eat.",
        "Josh: Okay. This here is part of my presentation, see?",
        "Bill: Presentation?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Imagine this sugar cube tower is a family unit, let's say the spaulding family, hm?",
        "Bill: It's a little sweet for them. Maybe you should go on back, get some of those onion soup bouillon cubes or something.",
        "Josh: Excellent point. Okay, let's say instead, then, that this is your new family with olivia.",
        "Bill: Where are you going with this?",
        "Josh: It doesn't take much. One little thing can happen, and pretty much the whole deal falls apart.",
        "Bill: Are you talking about my family? Or yours?",
        "Reva: Okay, really, what are we doing out here?",
        "Jonathan: You'll see.",
        "Reva: Can I open my eyes now?",
        "Jonathan: Not yet.",
        "Reva: At least give me a hint.",
        "Jonathan: Well, we're in the driveway.",
        "Reva: Yeah, I know that, but it's too cold that you would have washed my van.",
        "Jonathan: Wah-wah. Reva, your mini-van days are over.",
        "Reva: Uh-oh. What have you done?",
        "Jonathan: Open your eyes.",
        "Reva: ( Gasps ) oh. My.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) well? Are you just going to stand there or are you going to take her for a spin? This baby plus reva shayne equals trouble. ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: Did you steal it?",
        "Jonathan: Reva, I'm wounded. How could you think that?",
        "Reva: Well, after what happened last night, I couldn't possibly know. You used your trust fund money, didn't you?",
        "Jonathan: It's there to be spent.",
        "Reva: Not on some flashy car.",
        "Jonathan: You don't like it?",
        "Reva: No, I love it. I love it. It's so sexy and I just... i love that you bought it for me, but that money is yours, for you, for your future, for school.",
        "Jonathan: Do I look like the scholastic type to you?",
        "Reva: Well, you could be.",
        "Jonathan: Just get in the car. I want to see you in that driver's seat.",
        "Reva: Well, it probably wouldn't hurt just to sit in it.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) so, what do you think?",
        "Reva: Okay. I'm officially in love. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Okay, you're right. Things are not exactly a love fest at my house, but that's exactly why I'm looking at the bigger picture, see? The lewis family as a whole.",
        "Bill: So you want me back to run the company?",
        "Josh: Yes, I do. So does your father.",
        "Bill: Well, the lewis brothers stick together, huh?",
        "Josh: Bill, look, I know you were angry at both of us when you left the company.",
        "Bill: When you forced me to leave, right?",
        "Josh: But you cannot let pride stand in the way of doing the right thing.",
        "Bill: The right thing for who?",
        "Josh: For you.",
        "Bill: Oh.",
        "Josh: For all of us, bill. Look, we want you back. We need you.",
        "Bill: ( Laughs ) you don't need me. You and my dad are quite capable. Besides, I've got my own company to run.",
        "Josh: I understand that, but look, you left because you wanted to prove that you could do things on your own, right? You've done that. Your company is successful.",
        "Bill: Well, thank you for acknowledging that. But why would you want me to leave it now?",
        "Josh: I thought I just explained that with that sugar cube tower.",
        "Bill: Well, it's what you didn't say that's what I'd like to hear. I mean, you're shoring up the ranks, getting all your ducks in a row. Why?",
        "Josh: We're under attack, bill.",
        "Bill: ( Laughs ) should I be concerned, uncle josh? Because you're sounding a little paranoid. You want me back at lewis to run the company because you're worried about jonathan?",
        "Josh: I'm worried about what he might cost this family.",
        "Reva: No, I can'T. I really... I can'T. I didn't do anything to deserve this.",
        "Jonathan: Deserve?",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jonathan: Let's hope for both of our sakes neither of us ever get what we deserve. Now, would you stop trying to analyze every little thing?",
        "Reva: This isn't a little thing.",
        "Jonathan: You look good in the car!",
        "Reva: ( Groans )",
        "Jonathan: Stop thinking about it. Let go. Have fun.",
        "Reva: Fun.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) yeah, there you go. Your mini-van days are over. Reva looks good in this car! This is you, baby.",
        "Reva: Thanks. I don't know what this gesture is about, but thanks.",
        "Jonathan: Start her up.",
        "Reva: With pleasure. Is about, but thanks.",
        "Jonathan: Start her up. ( Growls playfully ) sounds good.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) let's roll.",
        "Josh: Reva has a blind spot where her baby boy is concerned.",
        "Bill: Now, come on. Reva's a smart woman. Sooner or later, she's going to kick him to the curb.",
        "Josh: I need people around me I can trust, bill. For reva's sake.",
        "Bill: Hey. Your nephew's going to be around, uncle josh. You can count on me.",
        "Josh: But you're not going to take the job.",
        "Bill: Look, I have my own company and I can't do that to olivia.",
        "Josh: Okay. Is there anything at all that i could say to change your mind, then?",
        "Bill: I think one quality we lewis men share is we stand by our women.",
        "Josh: I respect your loyalty, bill. See you.",
        "Olivia: You and I have always been very honest with one another. All right, not exactly honest.",
        "Alan: We understand each other.",
        "Olivia: We do. So I don't have a problem with telling you that gus did you a favor. He was nowhere fit to run this company.",
        "Alan: Gus could do anything he set his mind to do.",
        "Olivia: Of course he could, but at heart he's a cop, alan.",
        "Alan: At heart, he's a traitor.",
        "Olivia: Oh, he's in love. You do crazy things when you're in love.",
        "Alan: You should know about that.",
        "Olivia: It happens to the worst of us, doesn't it?",
        "Alan: Are you trying to tell me that marriage number four has softened you? Or is it motherhood, perhaps?",
        "Olivia: No, alan, I haven't softened. I'm a realist, okay? Look, I know that gus's appointment was your chance to groom the next spaulding prince.",
        "Alan: Well, I think it's the natural progression of things, yes?",
        "Olivia: Well, in some places, the natural order of things is for a parent to eat their young. My point is, gus's coronation, it's not going to happen.",
        "Alan: I had it all: Phillip and gus working for me here at spaulding. And I lost them.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry about that.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm a realist, too, and I know that they're gone and nothing is going to bring them back.",
        "Olivia: No, no. And I'm sure it's going to take some time for you to accept that, but in the meantime, you have to find somebody to take gus's place, to run spaulding at your side.",
        "Alan: Exactly. Now, if you will excuse me, i need to find that replacement for phillip and gus.",
        "Olivia: Alan? She's standing right in front of you.",
        "Cassie: I could do this all night.",
        "Edmund: Sounds tempting, but I personally was thinking about a change of venue.",
        "Cassie: Oh, wow. What did you have in mind?",
        "Edmund: I don't know. A room with a view. And a very big bed.",
        "Cassie: Wow. ( Laughs ) well? Do you want to eat first? It smells really good and you went to all this trouble.",
        "Edmund: Thank you, but I have to admit, cassie, the food is just laced with ulterior motive. And it'll keep warm and... unless, of course, you're not ready.",
        "Cassie: Why would you say that?",
        "Edmund: Well, because I know how much you were hoping to be pregnant and it didn't turn out that way, so I don't want to...",
        "Cassie: I'm okay with it.",
        "Edmund: You are?",
        "Cassie: Well, yes. I am, you know? If it doesn't happen one way, it's going to happen another. It's going to be a long process and it's going to bring us closer.",
        "Edmund: You think so?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Look at us now. Everything happens for a reason.",
        "Edmund: Hm. I think I'm beginning to see your point.",
        "Cassie: Good.",
        "Edmund: So, does that mean you...",
        "Cassie: That means you're cooking now.",
        "Edmund: Ooh. Mm.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs )",
        "Edmund: Well, in that case, please allow me to present you with the specialty of the house.",
        "Dinah: Corey, you know why I'm here.",
        "Corey: I do?",
        "Dinah: Yes.",
        "Corey: You came to see me again?",
        "Dinah: You know it.",
        "Corey: Why are you in here?",
        "Dinah: Because I am selfish. I did not want to share you with the entire hospital.",
        "Corey: This is about your friend, isn't it?",
        "Dinah: You are a mind-reader. Unbelievable. Yes. She's very nervous.",
        "Corey: About the in vitro?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. I tried to reassure her, and you know, even tell her what you told me. You know, about regulating the medication schedule and all...",
        "Corey: Why don't you just level with me, dinah?",
        "Dinah: Excuse me?",
        "Corey: You're your friend. It's okay. You can admit it. A lot of single women these days want to have a child.",
        "Dinah: How do you know me so well?",
        "Corey: I work with women every day. I'm dedicated to helping them.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You are extremely handsome and compassionate and really attractive.",
        "Corey: And now you're just trying to flatter me.",
        "Dinah: No, I'm not. I'm trying actually to do a little bit more than that, so why don't you decide to dedicate yourself to helping me?",
        "Corey: In here?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Corey: Now?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Corey: God, I haven't done this since med school. Okay, I've never done this. Um... uh... are you always... always so... so adventurous?",
        "Dinah: No, no. You are... I don't know what it is about you, but you make me crazy.",
        "Corey: Really?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Corey: Me?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You really are sexy. Hasn't anybody told you that before?",
        "Corey: Oh, uh, no.",
        "Operator: Dr. Butler, please call the switchboard. Dr. Butler, call the switchboard.",
        "Corey: I have to get that.",
        "Dinah: No, no, no. Forget about that. Forget about that.",
        "Corey: No, I can'T. Man, I want to, but I'm still on duty.",
        "Dinah: Come here. Let someone else take the phone call.",
        "Corey: Dinah, I would love to if I could. This is one of the great nights of my life. But I absolutely have to go.",
        "Dinah: No. No. Just a few more minutes? And I'll be so quick you won't even know what hit you.",
        "Corey: Yeah, I know. But one of my patients needs me.",
        "Dinah: I need you. What about me?",
        "Operator: Dr. Butler, please call the switchboard. Dr. Butler.",
        "Corey: I will call you. I will definitely call you. Thanks.",
        "Dinah: I have to do this again?",
        "Cassie: I don't like needles.",
        "Edmund: All right. Okay, let's forget about the needle. And let's concentrate... come here, sit down. Let's concentrate on something else.",
        "Cassie: Like what?",
        "Edmund: Well, close your eyes and think about holding our little baby for the first time.",
        "Cassie: That's nice.",
        "Edmund: Good. A little baby girl.",
        "Cassie: Oh, a girl.",
        "Edmund: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: It's been a long time since I've held a girl.",
        "Edmund: She'll look just like her mom.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughs ) a girl.",
        "Edmund: A girl.",
        "Cassie: It would be great if we had a girl. I could dress her up in dresses and put little bows in her hair. I could do that this time, you know? I didn't get to do that with tammy.",
        "Edmund: I know.",
        "Cassie: You know what? She will be daddy's little girl.",
        "Edmund: You think so?",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do. I think she's going to have you wrapped around her little finger. ( Laughter ) we're going to see big prince edmund crumble at the sight of a baby.",
        "Edmund: I'd try very hard to be the very best father I could be, cassie. Every day.",
        "Cassie: Well, you've already proven to me what a wonderful father you are.",
        "Edmund: Oh, well, I don't know about that, but I know what I didn't have and I know what i needed.",
        "Cassie: Baby girl winslow is very lucky.",
        "Edmund: Yes, she is. ( Knocking at door ) you think if we pretend we won't hear, they'll just go away? ( Knocking at door ) I'll get it. Yes?",
        "Messenger: Hi, there. Flowers for mr. And mrs. Winslow.",
        "Edmund: Oh.",
        "Cassie: No. No. We don't want them.",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs )",
        "Reva: Whoo! Fun?",
        "Jonathan: Where did you learn to drive like that?",
        "Reva: The back roads at cross creek. Josh's daddy, hb, taught me.",
        "Jonathan: That old coot must have been a wild man.",
        "Reva: Yeah, he was. But when I was in the car with him, I was very well- behaved. It was when I stole the keys to mama's car that I got a little wild. ( Laughter )",
        "Jonathan: What's it feel like, to stop having fun?",
        "Reva: I haven't stopped.",
        "Jonathan: No. You're just more sensible?",
        "Josh: Ooh-wee. Look at this.",
        "Reva: Hey.",
        "Josh: Jonathan, did you buy yourself a new car?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, kind of.",
        "Josh: Wow. Kind of?",
        "Reva: No, it's mine. He bought it for me.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Just for the heck of it, huh?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, why not?",
        "Josh: Nice.",
        "Reva: I mean, I know what you're thinking, that it's probably a little extravagant.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. Jonathan's got plenty of money, right? I mean, he's not paying room and board.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: Hey, you know what? I was just thinking, I've been thinking about getting one of these for myself. Would you mind if I take this for a little spin? Come on, darling. Get out. Just the two of us? I mean, it'll be fun. We'll do some donuts, some 360s, huh? What do you think?",
        "Reva: Oh, I love that!",
        "Josh: Wow. Look at this. Hey, you know what, jonathan? Don't wait up for us.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, don't worry. I need my beauty rest.",
        "Reva: Thanks, honey.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs ) thanks, honey.",
        "Jonathan: Sure.",
        "Reva: Oh, stop that.",
        "Josh: Nice.",
        "Reva: Yes. It's pretty, isn't it?",
        "Jonathan: \"Thanks, honey.\" \"Oh, come on, darling. It'll be just like the old days, when you were married to my daddy.\" ( Cell phone rings ) what?",
        "Dinah: Hi, sexy.",
        "Jonathan: What do you want?",
        "Dinah: A drink. And you're buying.",
        "Jonathan: Sure. Why the hell not?",
        "Alan: I wouldn't let you run my company if you were the last ceo on the planet.",
        "Olivia: Excuse me. You can say what you want about me but I did a damn good job the two times that I stepped in here. I mean, your company was on an upswing with me at the helm. Go check your balance sheets.",
        "Alan: Well, I will admit you were somewhat effective.",
        "Olivia: Oh, yeah.",
        "Alan: But I'm not letting you in the hen house again.",
        "Olivia: Oh, alan, are you calling me a fox?",
        "Alan: Why do I need you? I mean, I could run this company single-handedly.",
        "Olivia: You could. You could. But you don't want to. Because family means everything to you.",
        "Alan: Am I supposed to consider you family now?",
        "Olivia: Alan, I am the mother of your granddaughter and nothing means more to either one of us than emma's future. I'm not going to screw you over and risk hurting her.",
        "Alan: I'm not so sure of that.",
        "Olivia: Oh, alan. Understand this: Emma is the best part of me. And phillip for that matter. I will groom her to take over spaulding. She can be the future of this company.",
        "Alan: The answer is no.",
        "Olivia: You haven't heard the best part of my offer. You let me run spaulding and you will have more access to emma.",
        "Alan: You know, olivia, you've stooped to an all-time low. Using your child for your own personal gain, hm?",
        "Olivia: I learned it from you. So do we have a deal, alan, or not? Coming up, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Jonathan: Are you in love with my aunt cassie or something? She's all you ever talk about.",
        "Dinah: I am in love with edmund, and he would be mine right now if you knew how to finish what you started.",
        "Olivia: Because why settle for lewis when you can have the big enchilada?",
        "Bill: Spaulding.",
        "Olivia: Yes. What else? Come on.",
        "Bill: I don't want spaulding. We wanted to take them down. We did it. Mission accomplished.",
        "Olivia: Let's get one thing straight, I am not using my child to get ahead in business.",
        "Alan: Of course you are, but you're doing the right thing, because you're thinking of her future. I would do the same thing.",
        "Olivia: We get along pretty well, alan. We want the same thing: A strong spaulding for generations to come. So what's it going to be?",
        "Alan: You can be very persuasive. I love that killer instinct of yours. It's a deal. But you will work directly under me as the president.",
        "Olivia: You won't regret this.",
        "Alan: If I do, so will you. Welcome back. ( Glasses clink )",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Alan: Have your attorney contact the legal department and we'll hash out the details.",
        "Olivia: Of course. ( Cell phone ringing ) excuse me just a moment, okay? Hello?",
        "Bill: You on your way?",
        "Olivia: Almost.",
        "Bill: Good, because I've got big news.",
        "Olivia: I have some news of my own. I'll see you soon.",
        "Alan: Little bill?",
        "Olivia: It's my husband, alan. I'm meeting him for dinner.",
        "Alan: Does he know where you are right now?",
        "Olivia: No, he doesn'T.",
        "Alan: I wonder how he'll react when he finds out that you've abandoned your little company to come work for me.",
        "Olivia: I'm just going to tell him that I'm doing what i have to do for my daughter.",
        "Alan: Remember one thing, olivia: Bill is a lewis, and i don't want any lewis involved in anything spaulding.",
        "Olivia: I'm a professional, alan. Business is business.",
        "Josh: This is nice. Are you sure you don't want the top up, now?",
        "Reva: Not on your life.",

        "Jonathan: Yeah, I got some good stuff on cassie, but i think it's all about the timing. I don't want to blow it. Plus, I think you know something that you're telling me. So why don't you tell me what you know and I'll tell you what I know.",

        "Bill: So you really want this, don't you?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. Just as much as I want you and emma by my side.",
