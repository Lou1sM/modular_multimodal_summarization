Fearing someone has targeted Marah, he rounds up Billy, Buzz and Alan and they head over to Ed's house. The men make plans to head back into the tunnels to find the person who has been pulling the girls' strings behind the scenes. Alan wants Buzz to be his representative, to do what's necessary in those tunnels and to keep a close watch on the Lewis brothers. Frank pays Reva a visit and voices concerns about Josh. Due to meeting cancellation in Frank's experience, that means Josh has a problem he's decided to handle on his own. Michelle visits Ed and tries to pull him out of his funk.

        "Cassie: Don't look at me like that, because I know what you've been up to.",
        "Edmund: You do?",
        "Cassie: Yes. And I know that you're not even going to think about lying to me, so we should probably just hash this out.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Cassie: I want you to stop. Now.",
        "Edmund: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: How could you have been asking questions about this? I thought we were going to put this behind us, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I needed to be sure.",
        "Cassie: Be sure of what?",
        "Edmund: The baby. I wanted to be sure...",
        "Cassie: I am sure, okay? And as horrible as it is, my baby died. Look, I will always be in love with what could have been, but what could have been didn't happen, okay?",
        "Edmund: It didn't happen, Cassie, because...",
        "Cassie: Because... if you say it's your fault, I'm going to smack you.",
        "Edmund: Would that be the first time?",
        "Cassie: Edmund. I have grieved enough, okay? I have grieved for Richard, and I have grieved for my child that I lost, and I have grieved for myself, and then I discovered you. And then I found myself again, or a whole new me. I mean, my whole life is different now. I cut all my hair off -- what does that tell you?",
        "Edmund: That you look terrific with short hair?",
        "Cassie: That I have moved on. Now, I know that you want to find out everything that you can about the child I lost, and I know that you want to do that for me, but you know what? I don't want you to. I want you to move forward and I want you to move forward with me. Can't you do that?",
        "(Phone ringing)",
        "Michelle: Bauer residence. Why aren't you answering the phone?",
        "Ed: I'm not on-call at Cedars anymore. I don't have to answer the phone every time it rings.",
        "Michelle: Well, I've been trying to reach you.",
        "Ed: Well, sweetie, you've found me.",
        "Michelle: I spoke to Rick. He said you stepped down at the hospital?",
        "Ed: Certain events led me to understand that it would be better if I volunteered to leave. My head wasn't in the work.",
        "Michelle: I would ask you since when, but I already know. What are you doing, Dad?",
        "Ed: I'm just dropping out of sight for a while. I mean, you and Rick must have talked about my...",
        "Michelle: What's the matter?",
        "Ed: Nothing. I've been having these headaches.",
        "Michelle: Migraines? Do you want me to get you something?",
        "Ed: No. I'm not taking anything for it. I just need a little rest.",
        "Michelle: Well, at least let me get you a glass of water, okay?",
        "Reva: Those are my favorites.",
        "Josh: Well, it's sort of my idea of how to start a perfect date. Of course, it's also what guys do when they're hoping to get lucky.",
        "Reva: Oh. Well, you never needed much luck when it came to me. You may enter, Sir.",
        "Josh: Oh, well, thank you, Ma'am. And if you don't mind.",
        "Reva: Mm.",
        "Josh: Something smells wonderful -- besides you, of course.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, it's takeout from Attillo's. Cooking was just not on my agenda for today.",
        "Josh: This is lovely. I can't believe what you did here. This is beautiful. Thank you.",
        "Reva: Well, I like that.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: You coming in, hanging your coat up in the closet, sitting down in your favorite spot on the couch. It's like... it's like climbing into bed with you at the end of a long day, feeling your feet under the covers, the way you held my hand when we'd walk down the street, you tickling my palm with your finger.",
        "Josh: You got all that from me sitting on the couch?",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm. It gives me hope that our lives are becoming normal again.",
        "Billy: Look right here. This is all circa 1900. But these are just the main arteries. Now, Josh was down there and he said there's a lot of offshoots and a lot of dead ends, a lot of little interconnecting alleyways.",
        "Buzz: Tunnels. Why does it have to be tunnels?",
        "Billy: Don't tell me this is a Vietnam thing.",
        "Buzz: Well, being smallish, I was perfect for tunnel duty. I hate tunnels. Yeah, well, this is a classic circulatory system, here. Every tunnel has a use. Even if it has a dead end. It's just perfect -- perfect -- for someone to be trapped in or lost.",
        "Billy: I'm telling you, if somebody knows their way around down there, they can hide. I think we're doing the right thing by taking this fight right down to where this scum lives who's trying to hurt the girls.",
        "Buzz: Has Josh been down there?",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Buzz: What condition is it in?",
        "Billy: Well, broken timbers. There's some crumbling walls, a few cave-ins, but...",
        "Buzz: (Sighs) Well, the main arteries are still usable, I'm sure. This is a death trap. Michelle, Marina, Marah down there? With that person? What are they thinking?",
        "Billy: I'll tell you what's really scary is the idea that this guy has already gained their trust.",
        "Buzz: They don't know he's out for blood.",
        "Marah: You wanted a fight, Carrie? Well, now you're going to get one.",
        "Carrie: Marah, what are you talking about?",
        "Marah: Admit it! Admit it. You're trying to drive my crazy by moving this doll all over my house.",
        "Carrie: Marah, have you gone mad?",
        "Marah: Yeah, you know what? I am mad, Carrie. And I know exactly what you're doing. Tell me that it isn't your MO to wrap something nasty up in a pretty pink bow, like sticking a razor blade in the back of my doll.",
        "Carrie: Do you think I would really do something like that?",
        "Marah: I think that I can finally see you for who you really are, Carrie. And I got your message: \"Do as we're told.\" Well, you know what? I'm not afraid of you, so I'm going to tell you once: Get out of my house and don't ever come back.",
        "Carrie: Marah, not only are you being incredibly rude to me, but I don't even know what on earth you're talking about.",
        "Marah: Save it, Carrie. All right? I want real answers. We all know that you can get in and out of tunnels and into people's houses, so where did you get that doll? Did you steal it from my mother's attic or something?",
        "Carrie: What on earth are you actually accusing me of?",
        "Marah: You... you... you took the doll, you put it in my sewing box, but not until you stuck a razor blade in the back of it.",
        "Carrie: Oh, I see. That's how you hurt yourself, reaching for that doll.",
        "Marah: You didn't like me questioning you about Michelle's \"accident.\" You don't like being questioned or challenged at all. So you left me a little surprise to get your point across: \"Don't get in my way or else.\" Tell me that I'm wrong.",
        "Josh: We should eat in here more often.",
        "Reva: It's cozy, isn't it?",
        "Josh: You know, when I come here and I'm with you, it's like a dream or something. I walk in that door and it's... it's like I never left.",
        "Reva: Well, this is what's real, Joshua. Not what's going on outside of these walls. This is it. This is what counts, not business, not whatever problems you're dealing with right now. This is it. Us, together. You, me, the kids.",
        "Josh: It's what's keeping me from flying off the face of the earth right now.",
        "Reva: I want us to be whole again.",
        "Josh: We will be.",
        "Reva: You know, I... I know that there is something working deep inside you, a darkness creeping around your heart. And I don't know what it is and I don't really need to know what it is, but what I need you to know is that we can fight this together, whatever it is. The kids came by to see me today -- Marah, Shayne and Sandy. And it was so powerful being in the presence of my children. It made me feel so hopeful.",
        "Josh: How's Marah doing?",
        "Reva: She seems fine. She did have a freak accident. She cut herself and she can't figure out how it could have happened.",
        "Ed: Thanks.",
        "Michelle: I never wanted this, Dad. For you to drop out on life and hide from the world.",
        "Ed: Come on. Sometimes it can be good for the soul, you know? A little quiet solitude gives you a chance to think.",
        "Michelle: Can I help you? Look, I know that whatever happened with Maryanne Caruthers...",
        "Ed: Michelle. Look, don't... don't you realize that if I wanted your help, that I would ask for it?",
        "Michelle: Oh, well, no, not really. (Sighs) What's happening to you, Dad. You love your work at the hospital. Don't you want to work toward getting back to that, work toward something loving, something normal, something where you don't have to smack me in the face because you're so freaked out?",
        "Ed: I couldn't be sorrier for hitting you.",
        "Michelle: Well, when was the last time you even called Holly?",
        "Ed: All right, now, look. In the first place, you just leave Holly out of this. Don't even think of calling Holly. And secondly, this... this is my normal. I'm just going through a rough patch and if you really want to help me, just... please, stay out of it.",
        "Michelle: Dad, you are surrounded by people who love you and we refuse to give up on you.",
        "Ed: And I really appreciate that, but if you could just...",
        "Michelle: Dad. Look, I know that you are scared that something might happen if you admit the truth about Maryanne's accident, but...",
        "Ed: Please. Please, will you just stop talking.",
        "Michelle: But, Dad... Dad, you were scared one other time in your life, weren't you? When you had to quit drinking, weren't you scared then? I mean, you didn't know what being sober would mean, how you were going to live your day minute to minute. Breaking that addiction must have just seemed impossible for you, right?",
        "Ed: What do you want from me? Is this why you came over here? To harass me about why I'm not answering the phone? About \"why can't you try to go back to being normal,\" \"why can't you get out of the house now except don't go to the hospital?\" Don't you understand that what it is that you want from me, I... I can't give it.",
        "Michelle: You can't hole up here in this house and in this kitchen and ignore the world. You can't. You're trying to achieve some sort of peace with something that happened nearly thirty years ago, and you don't have to carry that burden alone anymore.",
        "Ed: I am trying to deal with the world the only way I know how, which is the way I see it. Now, if you want me to have some kind of beautiful transformation, if you want me to have some kind of therapy, then here's something you could do: You could let me have some time with Robbie. Spending time with my grandson now would do me such a world of good. He's the only person left in my family that I don't have to answer to. Oh, come on, let me just... let me spend the night with him. I mean, we could go out and play in the park, and tomorrow, I mean, I could drive up to the city and see a Bulls game.",
        "Michelle: Oh, Dad. Considering what you're going through and how you're acting, I can't allow that.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, when you described to me the day your baby died, things just didn't fit. I had questions.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I asked every question a grieving mother would ask. There were explanations for everything.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, it's...",
        "Cassie: Is this about the doctor?",
        "Edmund: Well, in part, but it's...",
        "Cassie: The doctor did not want me to see the baby out of some misguided sense of humanity. Caring and respect for my loss. It wasn't a conspiracy, Edmund. The doctor did what he thought was right, and the fact that you're trying to find some kind of a loophole in his charity, I mean, it's wishful thinking. It's a little paranoid.",
        "Edmund: I just want definitive proof.",
        "Cassie: Have you thought about me?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, of course I've thought about you.",
        "Cassie: No, no, no. About me, Edmund -- not what you hope for me and not what you want for me, but for me.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, if we knew about the baby, if there was no doubt...",
        "Cassie: There is no doubt in my mind.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Cassie: Did you find anything?",
        "Edmund: Then you do want to know?",
        "Cassie: It's against my better judgment, it's against all the healing I've had to do, it's against anything remotely smart, but...",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I don't have to tell you anything if you don't...",
        "Cassie: Please, Edmund, will you just... will you please tell me?",
        "Edmund: Nothing. I learned nothing.",
        "Cassie: I don't know what's worse: Hearing something horrible or hearing that there's nothing to hear.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: No, no, no. I don't want to hear that word anymore, okay? No more \"I'm sorry\"s and no more regrets. I love you. I love you and I don't blame you. I mean, don't you know that by now?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you gave me life when I was dead and it's your love now that sustains me. If there's... if there's even the remotest possibility that your child has survived, then there is no greater gift in the world that I can give you.",
        "Cassie: I have you and I don't need anything else. The gift you can give me is to believe in that, okay, and to believe in us. Are we done here?",
        "Edmund: Uh, I don't know. I'm kind of hoping at the moment that we're not.",
        "Cassie: You know what? I can't. I can't, and please don't read anything into that, okay? You have to spare me for a little while because I have to run to Harley's Angels to help Michelle with the hot-line.",
        "Edmund: Oh, the hot-line. I forgot about the hot-line.",
        "Cassie: You don't have to do this anymore, okay? Not for me, not for us and not for you. Can we move forward?",
        "Edmund: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Bye.",
        "Rick: Well, it looks like we're making this a habit, buddy.",
        "Frank: Now, look, I'm just filling in until Phillip feels better. Rick, I'm sorry you're having all this trouble with your dad. This should be a good time for you, you know? You've got a beautiful wife, you've got a baby on the way.",
        "Rick: All I want right now is a little normalcy in my life.",
        "Frank: \"Normalcy?\" What the hell is that?",
        "Rick: Oh, come on. You seem to be having it right now with Darci.",
        "Frank: Well, yes and no. I mean, I've got to admit, my dad's been a little off lately, too.",
        "Rick: Is there something in the water, Frank?",
        "Frank: There must be. I see my dad every single day and it just seems like he's going through the motions but... Rick, he's got this look in his eye and it really scares the hell out of me. Harley and I were really worried about him and he seemed to taper off, he seemed to be fine. But, now, after talking to you about your dad, I'm beginning to think there may be something going on.",
        "Rick: So, I guess what you're saying is you're tired of parenting your dad.",
        "Frank: Look, we're just dealing with two complicated guys, that's all.",
        "Rick: I really think, Frank, it's time for us to stop wishing that our dads would be the Guy Next Door, the Dad Next Door, like Josh and Ross. It's not going to happen. And I think it's time for us to stop dishing our parents, so what do you say? Why don't we get the girls together and go out for some dessert? My treat.",
        "Frank: You know what? Let me get a rain check, okay? You've just reminded me of something I needed to do.",
        "Ed: You're afraid to leave Robbie alone with me?",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry, Dad, but I am.",
        "Ed: I would never put my grandson in danger.",
        "Michelle: Well, you might have said the same thing about your daughter, but ask me how safe I feel around you right now.",
        "Ed: This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. I could never hurt you.",
        "Michelle: We both know that you have. Dad, you're short-tempered, you're avoiding me, you refuse to acknowledge any legitimate concerns that I have.",
        "Ed: I see.",
        "Michelle: Oh, Dad, this isn't going to go away. And no matter how long you hide...",
        "Ed: The other day you asked me to leave your house. I'm going to ask you to do the same thing for me now.",
        "Carrie: Marah. Marah, this is paranoia. You've got to keep your wits about you.",
        "Marah: Like everyone involved in this nightmare is the perfect picture of calm, cool, and collected?",
        "Carrie: Well, your father and his friends have a lot to be nervous about. After all, they're guilty. But you know, you know, that I would never hurt you or Michelle or Marina.",
        "Marah: Right. Right. Because you've bared your soul to us and told us all your little secrets?",
        "Carrie: Well, not quite all.",
        "Marah: Well, if you have secrets then I have a reason to be nervous.",
        "Carrie: Oh, my dear. My dear, you have let your imagination run away with you. There's no need for me to try and frighten you. You've done a very good job of that all by yourself.",
        "Marah: (Screams in frustration)",
        "Josh: So, was Marah seriously hurt?",
        "Reva: Just a nasty cut. Do you remember Polly Dolly?",
        "Josh: Yeah, sure. That was her rag doll when she was a child.",
        "Reva: Yeah. She thought that she'd lost it, but it somehow mysteriously appeared at the Museum. She happened to see it in her sewing box, and when she reached in to pick it up, there was a razor blade stuck in it and she sliced her hand. Could have been a lot worse.",
        "Josh: She has no idea where the doll came from?",
        "Reva: None whatsoever. But things do turn up sometimes, like love, a terrific marriage.",
        "Josh: I'm counting on it. Um, I'm really sorry, but I have to go. I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: Where are you going?",
        "Josh: I just... I forgot that I have a late-night conference call.",
        "Reva: Well, so begins the unorthodox schedule. I don't want to appear too forward, but I kind of thought maybe you'd spend the night.",
        "Josh: I'd like to take a rain check if I could.",
        "Reva: You want to take your cake?",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Josh: Bye.",
        "Billy: Take a look at that square right there. What do you see?",
        "Buzz: Oh, I know that. One of the finest homes in Springfield used to be there. Now it's a restaurant called Company.",
        "Billy: That's right. And if you'll notice, there is a tunnel that goes right underneath it. You ever see that before?",
        "Buzz: Well, there's a little door downstairs that goes to the plumbing, but other than that, I didn't notice anything.",
        "Billy: That's because you never looked before.",
        "(Phone vibrates)",
        "Billy: Ooh.",
        "Buzz: Call?",
        "Billy: Yeah, call. Yeah, Billy.",
        "Josh: It's Josh, Billy. Whoever messed with the gas at Michelle's house has gone after Marah.",
        "Billy: Is she okay?",
        "Josh: Yeah, I think she was shaken up a little bit but she'll be all right. Now, we have to get the guys together.",
        "Billy: Well, I'm here with Buzz and we can get Alan, but Ed's not been answering his phone at all today.",
        "Josh: Well, we'll just have to track him down then. I'll tell you what. I'll meet you at the Bauer's house.",
        "Billy: Good. Well, we've got to get together with everybody. Things just keep getting messier and messier.",
        "(Knocking on door)",
        "Billy: He's on leave from Cedars and he hasn't been seen anywhere around town.",
        "Buzz: He's in there. He's sitting down moping at the table.",
        "Josh: Why are we standing outside?",
        "Billy: Because Ed's pretending he's the Invisible Man in there.",
        "(Knocking on door)",
        "Josh: Ed, open up. It's Josh.",
        "Billy: Come on, Ed! We see you in there!",
        "Josh: Come on, Ed!",
        "Billy: And we are going to come in whether we have to break down the door. I hope the alarm's not on because we don't want to create a scene.",
        "Buzz: We're going to break in there?",
        "Billy: Why not?",
        "Josh: Just stop, okay? Ed, listen to me. They've gone after Marah. Do you understand what I'm saying? This guy, whoever he is, he put a razor blade in one of Marah's dolls and she got cut, very badly. Now, you have to open this door. We have to work together and try and figure out how we're going to protect our daughters.",
        "Buzz: Ed, my granddaughter's not going to be next.",
        "Billy: Ed, you look terrible!",
        "Ed: Is Marah all right?",
        "Josh: She's going to be all right, but this thing is not going to go away.",
        "Billy: Hey, Ed, you've got to pull yourself together. Look, we're only as good as our weakest link right now, and right now, buddy, that's you.",
        "Ed: I don't give a damn about being the weakest link! Michelle won't let me see my grandson.",
        "Buzz: Michelle and the girls are being controlled by the person who's ever behind this thing, you know? You want to get your family back? Get up and do something.",
        "Billy: We've got to stay united. The circle's got to stay unbroken.",
        "Alan: The circle has remained strong for thirty years, Ed. Now, just hang in there. Look, all of this is going to be over real soon.",
        "Billy: We're all going back in the tunnel. That's everybody. You too, Ed.",
        "Cassie: I haven't worked the phones in a while. What kind of calls are you getting?",
        "Michelle: You know, the usual. The volume really shot up once people figured out we were here.",
        "Cassie: \"The usual?\"",
        "Michelle: Depression. \"My parents don't understand me.\" Alcohol, drugs, sex. Apparently there's some new designer drug that's going around.",
        "Cassie: Oh. What's it called?",
        "Michelle: I haven't quite figured that one out, yet.",
        "Cassie: All right, well, I'll ask Tammy, see if her friends are talking about it. Thank God she talks to me.",
        "Michelle: At least about what she feels is safe for you to hear, right?",
        "Cassie: Yes, that's true. But we are close. We are. You know? I don't know, I just think parents should discuss these things with their kids whether they want to talk about them or not.",
        "Michelle: You know, I'm not saying anything about Tammy. It's just that problems seem to be everywhere, especially where you least expect them to be.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, in our house, honesty is a two-way street. You shut someone out and people get hurt. Especially children.",
        "Marah: Where the hell is it? (Screams)",
        "Shayne: \"I missed you so much, Marah. Why'd you leave me in that box? You locked me up alone...\"",
        "Marah: What is your problem, Shayne?",
        "Shayne: Oh, chill out.",
        "Marah: No, you chill!",
        "Shayne: It's just a doll.",
        "Marah: A doll that almost tried to kill me.",
        "Shayne: (Scoffs)",
        "Marah: This is not funny, okay?",
        "Shayne: Are you having some sort of reality confusion? I'm the one who likes horror movies.",
        "Marah: This is not me screaming about some stupid movie, Shayne.",
        "Shayne: Well, by definition, any time a doll or a toy is trying to kill you, it's the plot of some bad movie.",
        "Marah: Where did you find this?",
        "Shayne: I pulled it out of the trash just like I first pulled it out of the attic.",
        "Marah: You took it out of the attic.",
        "Shayne: Yeah. I was looking around for some old scrapbooks so I could show them to Sandy.",
        "Marah: You're the one who's been moving this doll all around the house for me to find?",
        "Shayne: Yeah. But I didn't think it was going to work out so well. It was pretty funny, huh?",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Shayne: Come on. Marah. Marah. Don't you remember when we were little? You used to always be playing with Polly the Dolly and I could... poor, little Shayne would always get left out in the cold.",
        "Marah: You would steal her and hide her from me.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, but you always managed to find her. And then one time you paid me back. You put this maple syrup into my baseball glove, and, so, I thought it was about time for a little pay-back.",
        "Marah: Like, ten years later? You're such a punk. I was so paranoid, too, about who would have put this in my sewing box.",
        "Shayne: I didn't put it in any box.",
        "Marah: You didn't?",
        "Shayne: No. That box is full of needles and scissors and sharp stuff that could hurt you. I wouldn't do that.",
        "Marah: If you didn't put it in my sewing kit, who did?",
        "Alan: Gentlemen, I've decided not to go with you down into the tunnels.",
        "Billy: Oh, and why is that, Alan?",
        "Josh: Claustrophobia, is that it?",
        "Billy: Look, just suck it up, Alan, because if you go crazy down there and start scratching on the walls, you won't be any use to us at all.",
        "Alan: And that's why I'm not going, Billy. Ed, you're not looking too well. You look a little pale.",
        "Ed: Would you mind your own business?",
        "Alan: This is my business -- our business -- Ed. Now, are you with us on this expedition or not?",
        "Ed: I am tired. Go alone.",
        "Billy: Oh, come on. You're not going to go now?",
        "Buzz: He doesn't need to. We'll be tripping over each other as it is.",
        "Billy: There's miles of tunnels down there.",
        "Buzz: The three of us can handle it.",
        "Josh: Buzz is right. We've got it covered, just the three of us. Now, when are we going?",
        "Billy: We're going into the tunnels from Company tomorrow.",
        "Buzz: Well, then I'd better get back there and set up.",
        "Alan: Buzz, I've got to talk with you.",
        "(Knocking at door)",
        "Reva: Frank!",
        "Frank: Hi, Reva. Is Josh around?",
        "Reva: You just missed him. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Frank: Well, he called me. I think he wanted to talk about police business. It sounded important.",
        "Shayne: What are you saying? Is that how you hurt your hand? Marah!",
        "Marah: You're not messing with me now, are you, Shayne?",
        "Shayne: Absolutely not.",
        "Marah: You swear you did not put it in that box.",
        "Shayne: No, I swear. I didn't. I mean, yes, I moved it all over the house, but I wouldn't put it in that box.",
        "Marah: Where was the last place that you put it?",
        "Shayne: It was on the couch where you found it. Is that how you hurt your hand?",
        "Marah: You know what? Forget about it. Don't worry about it.",
        "Shayne: Marah...",
        "Marah: I told you, I'll handle it! Okay?",
        "Frank: Josh called and left a message, saying he wanted to talk to me. It sounded important.",
        "Reva: Important how?",
        "Frank: That's just the thing. It just sounded like something was troubling him.",
        "Reva: And he never came by to meet you?",
        "Frank: No. That was the strange thing, too, is he called and left another message saying he wanted me to drop the whole thing.",
        "Reva: Drop what?",
        "Frank: That's exactly my point: What's there to drop if there's not a problem to begin with. He said he cleared up the whole situation, but that's not the impression that I got.",
        "Reva: And you don't think you may be reading more into this?",
        "Frank: (Sighs) I don't know, Reva. Maybe. But it's my experience with people that when they call the police, especially somebody like Josh, and then they cancel, it's a little strange. It usually means that they take matters into their own hands, and that can be a problem.",
        "Billy: Look, Ed, this is no time to fall apart here. You've got to pull it together.",
        "Josh: Billy...",
        "Billy: Just tell him he's got to keep it together here.",
        "Ed: I'll be fine. I just need to lie down. I need a little time.",
        "Billy: Oh, sure. Take all your time. Come on, this is crunch time. You've got to get on board, Ed.",
        "Ed: I know, I know, I know.",
        "Billy: Look, just between you and me, one day at a time, okay?",
        "Ed: Does it look to you like I'm drinking?",
        "Billy: No, but it looks like you want one as bad as I do.",
        "Ed: I'm not you.",
        "Billy: Do you think we can trust him?",
        "Josh: I don't think we have a choice, Billy. He's just scared, like the rest of us, you know? He doesn't want the big secret to come out.",
        "Billy: And how about you?",
        "Josh: What about me?",
        "Billy: Well, you're not going to suddenly get one of those cases of conscience?",
        "Josh: Will you just shut up? You know, I'm really tired of this paranoia of yours about how everybody else is handling this situation. You think that you're the only one that's keeping this thing together?",
        "Billy: No. But Buzz and Alan and I have always been a little harder of character than...",
        "Josh: Oh, than Bleeding Heart Josh or Terrified, Hair-trigger Ed? Billy, each and every one of us, at one point or another, has kept this thing together and we're going to keep on doing that until the threat is gone. My daughter -- my daughter -- has been hurt. I guarantee I'm going to be the first one to go back down into that tunnel.",
        "Buzz: You're serious about not going down there. I mean, whoever it is, is using those tunnels.",
        "Alan: I cannot go down into the tunnels.",
        "Buzz: It's sort of a small, dark place kind of thing?",
        "Alan: Yeah, something like that.",
        "Buzz: Alan, you never cease to astound me.",
        "Alan: I'm not worried. You'll represent my interest on this mission, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: First of all, don't ever talk to me like that. You're not in charge any more than anybody else. I'm not your personal mercenary. Second of all, you don't trust me any more than I trust you. Thirdly, you have exactly the same vested in this that I do.",
        "Alan: Yes, but have you noticed that our mutual interests are in doubt right now. Look at that group. Ed is a frazzled mess. Billy's one weak moment away from the bottle. And Josh, I mean, he wouldn't do anything to tarnish his lofty image, but you and I...",
        "Buzz: ...Are willing to get down in the muck, I know.",
        "Alan: Yes, we are. Because we have learned through the years. Chalk it up to your army experience, Buzz. I think the army gave you your character and resolve, the strength that you have used to live your life.",
        "Buzz: I don't know what we're going to find down there.",
        "Alan: No. That 's why it's very important that all of you come back alive and well. If you run into that cretin down there, the person who's trying to destroy our families, who knows what he is going to try next.",
        "Buzz: So I get the short end of the stick here, huh?",
        "Alan: Just do what you have to do. You're the only one with the experience to do what needs to be done.",
        "Buzz: What are you trying to tell me?",
        "Alan: Look, we as a group, we tolerate each other. We may distrust each other. But we made a pact thirty years ago to protect ourselves and our families.",
        "Buzz: We may not deserve another thirty years.",
        "Alan: Well, perhaps. But I'll be damned if I'm not going to give it a fight.",
        "Buzz: Next, on Guiding Light",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, this isn't about me or my feelings. This is about you. I'm worried about you, Dad.",
        "Tony: The point is, if you need a message sent to someone, you ask me, man. If I'm down with it, I will do it. But what you will not do, ever again, is put Eden August in a situation that's got nothing to do with her, or I will make sure that you clearly pay for your mistake. Are we clear?"
