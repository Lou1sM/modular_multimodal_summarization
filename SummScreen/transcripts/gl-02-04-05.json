        "Harley: Okay, zach. Zach, sweetie, listen to mommy. Don't be scared, honey. Uncle frank and grandpa are right there with you. Oh, I miss you, too. I'm sending you and jude lots of hugs. I don't really know when I'm going to be home, sweetie. I have to stay here, and I have to make sure the bad reporters don't bother you. But I promise you this, listen. I'm going to visit. I'll sneak in and I'll visit you as soon as possible, okay. I can't wait to be with my family.",
        "Gus: No, no, no. I can not wait that long. I need her to be home with her family as soon as possible. I'm not talking five to seven years. So there will plea deal not now, not ever. Do you understand?",
        "Harley: No, no, no. I'm all right, sweetie. Mommy's going to sleep now, and I think you should go to sleep you. I'll be thinking about you all night.",
        "Gus: No, I'm not all right. Thank you very much for asking. I'm going to be up all night working on my case. There's just no time for sleep.",
        "Harley: See you in my dreams.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, I'll see you in court.",
        "Harley: Great. A honeymoon couple.",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Michelle: Remember me?",
        "Rick: Yeah. It's good to see you.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, you, too. I'm sorry I missed you last week.",
        "Rick: Really?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Look at you. You don't look any worse for the wear with your jungle adventure.",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah, adventure. I guess that's a good word for it.",
        "Rick: Michelle, that must just have been terrifying for you.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, yeah. It was a little worse for holy than it was for me. Oh, I... I'm really sorry about phillip.",
        "Rick: Thanks.",
        "Michelle: I wish I could remember more about him, you know? I mean, I know you guys were close.",
        "Rick: Well, he loved you. I mean, you were like a little sister to him. So... so what brings you buy today?",
        "Michelle: Oh, just looking for a little help from my big bro.",
        "Rick: Well, here I am. What can I do for you?",
        "Michelle: Well, danny, wants custody of robbie and I was kind of hoping you'd talk to him, you know, and make him see that that's not right.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. I can'T.",
        "Michelle: What? You think he won't listen to you?",
        "Rick: No, because I think danny's right.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Danny: How are you doing? Are you off soon? You feel like maybe catching a late movie tonight?",
        "Marina: What about robbie?",
        "Danny: I gave him the keys to my car. He's fine.",
        "Marina: You're so funny.",
        "Danny: So what do you think? You up for it? I promised you a raincheck.",
        "Marina: I don't know. Is there popcorn involved?",
        "Danny: Yeah, maybe even butter.",
        "Marina: Throw in some milk duds and you've got yourself a deal.",
        "Danny: Okay, I think I can swing for a box of each.",
        "Marina: Okay, you're on.",
        "Danny: All right.",
        "Marina: Are you sure you're up to this? I mean, I know your life's been pretty complicated lately.",
        "Danny: Yeah, well... yeah, but actually it's getting simpler everyday. I'm taking myself off the lighthouse project. Hey, you can celebrate my unemployment with me.",
        "Marina: Maybe in that case i should be paying tonight.",
        "Danny: No, no, I'm kidding. It's not that bad. Actually, all these other contracting jobs have come through for me. So I'm doing pretty good.",
        "Marina: That's good.",
        "Danny: So you ready now?",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Good.",
        "Marina: So much for simple.",
        "Tony: We need to talk.",
        "Danny: No, we don'T.",
        "Tony: Yes, we do. Right now. It's important.",
        "Danny: Give me a couple of minutes.",
        "Marina: I'm right here.",
        "Danny: Okay. Something bothering you, tony.",
        "Tony: Yes. Danny, look, I know what you're trying to pull with michelle. It's going to end right now.",
        "Amy: Hey, tammy. I haven't seen you in ages. Where have you been?",
        "Tammy: Around, you know. I'm starting classes at su.",
        "Amy: Oh, come sit.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Thanks. Hey, you're taking dr. Mcmahon's acting class, right? Maybe you could tell me what I...",
        "Amy: Whatever you want to know, and maybe you could tell us something...",
        "Tammy: Sure.",
        "Zoe: Is it true you were dating your cousin? ( Laughter )",
        "Jonathan: That's my mother.",
        "Reva: Sorry. Easy. Easy. Stop.",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh. How many times can they do it?",
        "Gus: Just tell me she didn't do it. God, just tell me she didn't do it, please.",
        "Harley: Okay, that's enough. I am an accused murderer. You guys don't want to mess with me. ( Phone rings ) what now? Oh. Hello?",
        "Gus: Hey. I'm glad I caught up with you. Um... you have to meet me.",
        "Harley: If this is about doing more detective work so that we could point the finger at somebody other than me, I'm not interested.",
        "Gus: No, it's not about any detective work. This is about your future, okay. So meet me at the old house.",
        "Harley: Not much there, remember?",
        "Gus: Just do what I'm telling you to do.",
        "Harley: Okay. I'll be there. So now they're quiet. Now they're sleeping.",
        "Gus: I've got to figure out a way to wake harley up.",
        "Rick: You've been away a lot. Can you honestly say, michelle, that you will be there for robbie? Same place, same time day after day. Are you ready to finally settle down?",
        "Michelle: I'm here, okay. I'm not going anywhere. And I have a lot to offer my son.",
        "Rick: Of course you do. I know that.",
        "Michelle: I'm going to teach him how to take risks, how to dream, how to follow his heart.",
        "Rick: Right, and I'm sure that danny could do the same thing.",
        "Michelle: See, I don't even think this is about robbie. I think this is danny's way at trying to get back at me for not being able to love him.",
        "Rick: No. Danny wouldn't use robbie that way. You know that.",
        "Michelle: Oh and I would? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Rick: No. What I'm saying, michelle, as I've said before, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into. Now it may be over with danny, but I have this terrible feeling, michelle, it's just the beginning for you. Well, michelle, it may be over for danny, but I have a terrible feeling it's just beginning for you. What is it? You all right?",
        "Michelle: I just remembered something?",
        "Rick: What? Sit down. Take it easy.",
        "Michelle: No, I remembered you. You were warning about my safety if I stayed with danny. Did that happen?",
        "Rick: Well, I gave you a lot of those warnings. And this has been happening a lot lately?",
        "Michelle: Yes. I mean, well, I had a couple memories of my mother.",
        "Rick: Maureen.",
        "Michelle: Of maureen. And then... and then on the island when I thought danny was dead, I had... I had... i remembered him.",
        "Rick: Michelle, this is great. This is good.",
        "Michelle: Does this mean that's it's all going to be coming back to me?",
        "Rick: I don'T... if it's happening more and more. Yes, that's a good sign, michelle. That's a real good sign.",
        "Michelle: I hope so.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Well, look, if you're starting to remember things like about danny, the way things used to be, maybe it's best to hold off on this divorce for awhile.",
        "Michelle: I love tony now, rick. Okay, that's not going to change.",
        "Rick: But it might change. You just got to give it some more time.",
        "Michelle: No, no. You know what? That's one thing that I'm sure about, okay. I realized that you can't support me on that one. But you know, it's not the first time. Look, it was really good to see you, anyway.",
        "Rick: Michelle?",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Rick: I just want to tell, it's just good to have you home. And if you really, truly start remembering, I just want to tell you in advance that I'm really sorry for that butch haircut i gave you when you were six years old. I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Rick: Hi.",
        "Mel: Hey.",
        "Rick: So how long have you",
        "Mel: Long enough to know that you're wrong. Dead wrong.",
        "Tony: Danny, taking robbie away from michelle, it's not right.",
        "Danny: Tony, I'm not going to discuss this with you.",
        "Tony: Of course not. Of course you aren't, danny, because you know you're wrong. I mean, what are trying to do? You trying to punish her for leaving you? What is it?",
        "Danny: Are you through? Because I got plans.",
        "Tony: I'm not going to let you hurt her, danny. In fact, you're fired, all right. I don't want you no where near the lighthouse. I don't want you any where near michelle... at all.",
        "Tammy: My personal life is none of your business.",
        "Zoe: Tammy. I'm sorry. Guys are dogs. We're not judging you.",
        "Tammy: Is everyone talking about me?",
        "Zoe: So then it is true? You did it with your cousin.",
        "Amy: Ew. How gross is that? ( Laughter )",
        "Tammy: Go to hell. Both of you. ( Laughter )",
        "Reva: Stay back. Stay back. I mean it. Jonathan, no more. No more. Stop. Okay, stop. Stop this right now. I mean it. Stop it. Ow! Ooh.",
        "Reva: I am so sorry.",
        "Josh: Why is there glass all over the floor?",
        "Reva: Oh, you got cut.",
        "Josh: Did something happen while I was gone, honey?",
        "Reva: I am so sorry.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, sandman. You came just in time. Now you don't have to get your hands dirty.",
        "Reva: Come over here.",
        "Josh: Ow!",
        "Reva: Let me see. Let me see.",
        "Sandy: Are you okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Will you help jonathan? Come here. Oh, this way, honey.",
        "Josh: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that.",
        "Reva: Sit down. Here you go. Oh, that's good. Okay. Close your eyes.",
        "Josh: Your hands are all shaking.",
        "Reva: I know. I had one last good punch left in me. ( Laughter ) did we win?",
        "Josh: I think so. Yes.",
        "Reva: You know what? I haven't been in a good bar fight like that in years. ( Laughter )",
        "Josh: Ow!",
        "Reva: Oh, sorry.",
        "Josh: Oh.",
        "Reva: Sorry.",
        "Sandy: So what happened?",
        "Jonathan: Don't give me that look. I'm just a boy defending his mommy.",
        "Sandy: Wow. It's happening. She's getting to you.",
        "Jonathan: No, you're reading too much into it. Those guys were giving her trouble, so I took care of them. If anybody's going to trash my mom, it's going to be me.",
        "Josh: Okay. I'm sort of afraid to even ask this question, but...",
        "Reva: They weve attacking jonathan.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Josh: What a surprise.",
        "Reva: He was defending me, joshua, and I got caught up in the middle of the fighting. And it was not his fault.",
        "Josh: Sort of like the break- in at the music store. That wasn't his fault either, right?",
        "Reva: You found out about that, huh?",
        "Josh: Yeah, from the police who found your purse and your keys.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, it really wasn't any big deal. We weren't arrested or anything.",
        "Josh: Right, because you were doing, what? An investigative piece for your television show?",
        "Reva: Well, there is some truth to that.",
        "Josh: Which part?",
        "Reva: The part about I work for a tv station.",
        "Josh: Shoplifting, reva.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) jonathan. He was just trying to have some fun with me.",
        "Josh: You're breaking and entering. That's fun. I understand.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, no one was hurt, okay. No one was hurt. And if I'm going to win jonathan's trust, I can't go crazy every time he acts out.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but where's the line, reva, you know? Is it somewhere between a misdemeanor and a felony?",
        "Reva: Have a drink. Come on.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Reva: Yeah. It's good, huh?",
        "Josh: ( Sighs )",
        "Mel: How about just accepting her for who she is? How about helping her to become a mother to her son?",
        "Rick: Mel, you have been with that little boy more than she has. She has amnesia, she's not ready to be a full-time parent. Maybe down the road she will be, but not now.",
        "Mel: So you know what's best now for her? Is that it? You sound a lot like phillip.",
        "Rick: You just had to throw that in my face, didn't you? These conversations never go well, do they?",
        "Mel: You know, you talk about michelle's sense of responsibility, how she just took off on robbie. Well, just a few weeks ago, you wanted to take off, too. Quit your job, sail around the world. I guess that makes you an unfit parent.",
        "Rick: I had no intentions of leaving you or the children behind.",
        "Mel: Are you sure about that?",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'm sure about that. I never said that.",
        "Mel: Right, because I'm not so sure. I feel you letting go a little bit everyday.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I can't stand here and just pretend our marriage hasn't been affected by my best friend's murder. But I can'T.",
        "Mel: So what are you saying? Are you trying to find a way to walk away from me?",
        "Danny: Well, you can't fire me, cousin, because I've quit. I've already put calls out to other contractors.",
        "Tony: That's good. That's fine. Hey, we'll find somebody else anyway. It doesn't matter.",
        "Danny: Fine. Just trying to help. Hey, michelle.",
        "Michelle: What's going on?",
        "Danny: Well, tony and I both agree that it would be better if I stopped working at the lighthouse.",
        "Tony: Yeah, listen, hey, it's okay. We could find somebody else.",
        "Michelle: I don't want anyone else.",
        "Tony: What are you... what?",
        "Michelle: Danny, please, you can't leave. Can you just stay and finish what you started?",
        "Gus: Going to ask me in?",
        "Harley: What are we doing here?",
        "Gus: Take my hand. Please just take it. All right. Let me be the first one to welcome you to your new old home.",
        "Harley: I'm not in the mood for this game.",
        "Gus: It's not a game. It's not a game. Please, just for a second. Use your imagination, okay. This is going to be the living room here. Build a nice big fireplace where the kids could roast their marshmallows or where people could tell their stories around there. And over here we got... it's like... um... you know, it's really popular right now. The big open kind of kitchen where you could cook and heat up meatloaf, whatever and you could keep your eye on the boys, because it's open, like the whole thing is very spacious.",
        "Harley: Don't do this.",
        "Gus: Well, don't give up. Look, I know things are difficult right now, okay, but in actuality you have a lot to look forward to.",
        "Harley: How could you say something like that to me?",
        "Gus: Because I'm going to catch my brother's killer. And I'm going to nail him, and I'm going to get your life back and the boys and your house and it's going to be as if this nightmare never even happened.",
        "Harley: Gus, you need to wake up, okay. All the evidence, it points to me.",
        "Gus: No, no. That's not true. That is not true. There's a lot of unanswered questions, okay. Like lizzie for example. She is a liar. That little girl is... and she is hiding something. Everybody knows it.",
        "Harley: Lizzie did not kill her father. That's a dead end. Just like chasing beth was a dead end. We were so convinced that beth shot phillip. And we were wrong, okay. And I can't do this anymore. My children's future depends on this, okay? I have to face reality here.",
        "Gus: What reality?",
        "Harley: I want you to call jeffrey o'neill. I want you to call him and i want you to tell him that I'm ready to plead guilty and take the deal. Coming up on \"guiding light\"",
        "Harley: Would the defendant care to rise? We, the jury, find you guilty of murder in the first degree.",
        "Reva: But why can't people take chances every so often, you know, and let loose sometimes? I may be going about it the wrong way, but I miss causing a little trouble and raising a little hell. Don't you? Oprah: This \"desperate housewives\" star's wildest",
        "Tony: Look, you know what? Danny doesn't want the job, anyway. So let him go.",
        "Michelle: That would mean we'd have to delay on construction, you know, and it would take weeks to get another contractor up to speed.",
        "Tony: Michelle, it's fine. We'll find somebody that could do the job.",
        "Michelle: Tony. Tony, please. This is what I want, okay. Danny?",
        "Danny: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: I need you to stay.",
        "Danny: You know, it's just a little too much drama for me.",
        "Michelle: Well, it doesn't have to be. Look, I admit that I had some expectations about the way things should be with you and with robbie and it's not happening. But I'm an adult and I can handle that. Can you?",
        "Danny: Whoa. Michelle, this has got nothing to do with that.",
        "Michelle: Look, we could make it work. We could make it work. Do you realize... do you even realize what an incredible showcase light is going to be for you? This is going to jumpstart your career. People are going to be dying to hire you. I don't think you could afford to say \"no.\" Just please, danny. Please, can you just stay and see it through?",
        "Danny: Well, if you want me to. All right, I'll give A... I'll stick it out. But if, you know, if I've got to deal with this every time I walk through the door, I'm gone.",
        "Tony: ( Laughs )",
        "Michelle: It's understood. It's understood. Right, tony?",
        "Tony: Yeah, it's understood.",
        "Danny: Okay. Then I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Michelle: Thank you. I thought we were supposed to be partners here?",
        "Tony: Well, you know what? I was going to ask you the same thing.",
        "Reva: So are we done discussing my encounters with the cops and local drunks?",
        "Josh: You tell me.",
        "Reva: I am if you are.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Reva: Mm-hmm.",
        "Josh: I'm worried about you.",
        "Reva: So we're not done yet.",
        "Josh: It's just things are getting a little dangerous, reva, you know.",
        "Reva: Is that so bad?",
        "Josh: Well, it depends. What's next in store for you and jonathan? Are you going to blow up some mailboxes or maybe deal some drugs or something like that?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: All in good fun, of course.",
        "Reva: Anything illegal is definitely out. But why can't people take chances every so often, you know, and let loose sometimes? I may be going about it the wrong way, but I miss causing a little trouble and raising a little hell. Don't you?",
        "Sandy: Nice people, huh? The kind of people you want to get to know. The kind of people you want to care about you, to embrace little johnny.",
        "Jonathan: Speak for yourself.",
        "Sandy: They are a hard family to resist. I don't blame you at all for wanting to be part of that. I say go for it. Reva's trying really hard right now, but she'll get fed up. And then you'll be out of her life for good. There's something to look forward to, huh? See you. Hey, you guys. Take care of each other. I'll see you later.",
        "Reva: See you, sandy.",
        "Josh: So long, sandy.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, cous. You looking for me?",
        "Tammy: Not even close.",
        "Jonathan: If you're looking for lover boy, he just took off. Probably saw you coming.",
        "Tammy: Doesn't that ever get old, trying to make life miserable for everyone around you?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I didn't make life miserable for you that night at edmund'S.",
        "Tammy: You've already the pig of the year award. All because you're mad at your mom. Why don't march over there, tell her that you need her and be done with it?",
        "Gus: You're not taking any deal.",
        "Harley: Do it. Or I'll get myself another lawyer.",
        "Gus: You're crazy.",
        "Harley: No, no, listen to me. Listen to me. Jeffrey's offer's a good one. I'll be out in a few years. I can watch my boys grow up.",
        "Gus: Do you hear yourself? Is this what you want? They're going to visit mommy on visiting day? Are you serious? Is this what you want for your kids?",
        "Harley: Well, you know what? It's better than getting 20 to life which is what I have to look forward to if a jury convicts.",
        "Gus: There's not going to be a trial.",
        "Harley: And what if there is, gus? You've been so sure you were going to get the real murderer, you haven't even prepared anything.",
        "Gus: No, that's not true. I'M... I'm on it.",
        "Harley: And what happens when jeffrey o'neill lays into me on the stand? What are you going to do then? \"Miss cooper, did you got company wearing a disguise the night that phillip spaulding was murdered?\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"Why? \" \"He kidnapped my children. I wanted them back.\"",
        "Gus: Oh, stop. Please.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. We both know that jeffrey o'neil plays to win no matter whose life is at stake. \"Describe your emotional state when you confronted your husband.\" \"I was out of my mind with fear.\" \"You fought?\" \"Yes, physically. He pushed me then I went after him.\" \"Then what happened?\" \"I don't know.\" \"You don't know?\" \"I don't remember.\" \"You don't remember?\" \"I blacked out.\" \"How convenient. Let's suppose for the moment that you did 'black out.' Perhaps you blacked out the memory of what happened that night because it was too traumatic?\" \"I guess.\" \"Would you then guess that the reason it was too traumatic is because you shot and killed phillip spaulding that night?\"",
        "Gus: Are you done? Are you done yet?",
        "Harley: Oh, no, no. Because we are up to the best part. Hey. ( Bangs rock like a gavel ) \"would the defendant care to rise? We, the jury, find you guilty of murder in the first degree and we sentence you to life in prison.\" Life, gus. With no hope for parole.",
        "Gus: You know what? Take it. Take it, take it. Take your little deal, all right? Throw yourself behind bars. That's fine, because you know what? When you get out, your kids won't even recognize you.",
        "Harley: Why are you doing this?",
        "Gus: In fact, you won't recognize them.",
        "Harley: Why are you doing this?",
        "Gus: Why am I doing this? You've got us in a fake courtroom, right? I'm going to present the other side.",
        "Harley: Gus, I've made up my mind!",
        "Gus: Take your deal! Do you know what you're doing? Great. But let me tell you this: You do this, you take the deal, it's like telling your son, \"hey, yes, I did kill your father.\"",
        "Harley: Stop it.",
        "Gus: Okay, you know what that does to a kid? That scars them for life!",
        "Harley: Stop it.",
        "Gus: Life. No, you stop.",
        "Harley: Stop it.",
        "Gus: You stop it. It's easy for you to be a quitter. Is that easier for you? Go ahead. Easier than standing up for yourself? To hell with the people who love you or care for you or believe in you? Break your son's heart, and rip mine out while you're at it.",
        "Harley: How dare you use my sons against me?",
        "Gus: How dare you quit? You want reality? I'll give you reality. Put yourself behind bars, you're going to lose a lot more than five to seven years.",
        "Harley: Well, what choice do I have? We don't have a defense.",
        "Gus: We do. It's called the truth. Look into it. That's what I'm going to do. We have a week, okay, before this trial, and maybe even more if the judge accepts my motion to postpone. I'm saying it's a week. That is a week that you don't even think about taking a deal with the da. Okay?",
        "Harley: Gus, it is not possible...",
        "Gus: Don't say that it's not possible to me. Was it possible to find the kids when phillip was dead? Everybody thought it was, right? Well, I found them. I brought them home, didn't I? I did, right? Just let me bring you home. Just let me bring you home. Please.",
        "Harley: We both know I'm never going to live in this house.",
        "Gus: Yes, you are. You're going to be in this house, they're going to lay out the foundation for you, there's going to be a contractor here. You're going to be arguing with the contractor, because you love to do that, and you're going to be here with the boys in the spring making this...",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: Making this a home.",
        "Harley: Okay. A week. A week.",
        "Gus: That's what I need, and I will find the truth.",
        "Harley: Because I can'T... i can't take a deal when I don't know what the truth is.",
        "Gus: See, that'S... that's good.",
        "Harley: But I can't do what you want me to do, either, okay? I can't live in this fantasy world of yours. This is not a house, gus. It's an empty lot. It's not a house. How could you try and make me believe that?",
        "Rick: Do you honestly believe that I'm looking for a way to get out of our marriage?",
        "Mel: The thought has crossed my mind, yes.",
        "Rick: Okay. Is this because I'm still mourning the death of my friend?",
        "Mel: No.",
        "Rick: Then what is it?",
        "Mel: No. I... I think phillip's death might have been a trigger for you, but you've changed, rick. The man I know would never choose danny's side over his own sister's, let alone make out with beth.",
        "Rick: Okay, that... it was a kiss. It was a mistake and i apologized...",
        "Mel: And you haven't stopped seeing her.",
        "Rick: She's a friend. What am I supposed to do? Throw away our history as friends together over one mistake?",
        "Mel: History? History? You want to know history? This is history. This is our first date. Do you remember that? It wasn't prom with phillip or beth or mindy, but it was sweet and it was romantic. And here's leah, two days after she was born. This is us. This is who we are. Okay? And we have so much to live for and I am going to fight for us with everything I have. Please don't make me fight alone.",
        "Danny: I think we missed the movies.",
        "Marina: Yeah, no big deal. Hey, is everything okay? I saw michelle come. Things looked kind of tense.",
        "Danny: Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine. But listen, if you still want to go to a movie, I'm sure we can catch a later showing of something.",
        "Marina: Yeah, you know, I'd better not. I open tomorrow.",
        "Danny: What is this, your polite way of telling me to kiss off?",
        "Marina: No. No. Let's just hang out here. I'll make us some popcorn.",
        "Danny: Did I ruin the night?",
        "Marina: It's not over yet.",
        "Tony: Hey, michelle, I'm confused. I thought you wanted danny... i thought you wanted him out of light.",
        "Michelle: I realized that shutting danny out would be a big mistake.",
        "Tony: And why is that?",
        "Michelle: I'm not going to let danny keep me away from my son, okay? If he's working at light, that means robbie is going to be around. I'll be able to spend some time with him, get close to him, show what a good mother I can be. I mean, this might be my only way, tony.",
        "Tony: And that's it? That's it, huh?",
        "Michelle: Well, what other reason would there be?",
        "Tony: I don't know, michelle. You tell me.",
        "Sandy: Tammy. Hi.",
        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Reva: You okay?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Looks like josh got the worst of this one.",
        "Reva: Well, actually, that's a pretty nasty cut on your lip.",
        "Jonathan: I heal fast.",
        "Reva: It could use a stitch or two.",
        "Jonathan: This is the best medicine there is. So, you can't at least win the karaoke contest so we could have a free month of pool and beer? ( Laughter )",
        "Reva: Next time. Thank you for defending my honor.",
        "Jonathan: I need a refill.",
        "Reva: You know what? We've got a bottle. I'll go get it.",
        "Josh: Just for the record, i do not appreciate these situations you've been getting reva into, but if I had been here and heard what those guys were saying, I would have done the same thing. I would have gone after them.",
        "Jonathan: Joshua, is$that a thank you?",
        "Josh: I was getting into bar fights with reva before you were even born. Yeah, it's a thank you. Whatever. I'm really glad the two of you are getting along so well.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever.",
        "Josh: I tried.",
        "Reva: What did you say to him?",
        "Josh: I said... I said thank you.",
        "Reva: That was an awfully long thank you.",
        "Josh: You know what? You hit me with a pool cue. You don't get to be annoyed at me for at least two days.",
        "Reva: How about a kiss? For medicinal purposes.",
        "Josh: That might make me feel better.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs )",
        "Michelle: I am not going to let danny cut me out of robbie's life, and keeping him at light, that might be my only hope. So, please don't read into it any more than that.",
        "Tony: Danny's always been your security, so...",
        "Michelle: Okay, I don't need anybody to make me secure.",
        "Tony: Okay, that I know. You're pretty good on your own. You're doing well. You're doing all right.",
        "Michelle: I didn't mean that I don't need you.",
        "Tony: No? That's good. That's good.",
        "Michelle: You are the only man that I want. You. I love you.",
        "Tony: I love you.",
        "Michelle: What do you say that...",
        "Tony: What?",
        "Michelle: ...We go home and make some of our own memories?",
        "Marina: Hey, I know this is none of my business, but I have to ask anyway.",
        "Danny: Uh-oh.",
        "Marina: What was going on out there with tony and michelle?",
        "Danny: You know, negotiations, re-negotiations.",
        "Marina: Because you're pulling out of light?",
        "Danny: Well, actually, that's what we were talking about. I've decided to stick it out and finish that job. It'll be fine.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Danny: Where are you going?",
        "Marina: I'm going to get some more pie.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Harley: I need your help.",
        "Danny: You okay?",
        "Harley: Things don't look good for me. I don't think the trial will go in my favor. Odds are stacked against me.",
        "Danny: What can I do?",
        "Harley: You know people. People who could fix the outcome of the trial. I'll pay for it. I'll pay whatever it takes.",
        "Manager: Mr. Aitoro?",
        "Gus: Yeah? Oh, mr. Zebrowski. What can I do for you?",
        "Manager: I'm sorry. There's been a problem with your credit card.",
        "Gus: What's the problem?",
        "Manager: It's been declined. Is there another you'd care to use?",
        "Gus: My father must have shut them all off. Can you give me a couple of days and then I'll straighten the whole thing out?",
        "Manager: I'm afraid you'll have to leave first thing tomorrow. Hotel policy.",
        "Gus: Right. Good thing I'm traveling light.",
        "Sandy: So, I was looking for you earlier.",
        "Tammy: I was looking for you.",
        "Sandy: Well, here we are.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Uh...",
        "Sandy: What?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. I'm hungry. What about you?",
        "Sandy: Always, especially if you're going to cook.",
        "Tammy: Oh, I don't know. I've got to go out and get more food, I guess.",
        "Sandy: You know what? That's okay, don't bother. We can just order pizza. How did the study group go?",
        "Tammy: Don't ask.",
        "Sandy: You okay?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Aren't you... cold?",
        "Sandy: Cold?",
        "Tammy: I mean, don't you want to...",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm. I've wanted this for so long.",
        "Tammy: I can'T. I'm sorry.",
        "Sandy: It's okay.",
        "Tammy: No, it's not. I hate that he's ruining this for us.",
        "Sandy: He's not. Hey. Jonathan can't ruin anything for us. We're here together. That's what matters. I'm not going anywhere. I hope you're not.",
        "Josh: I can see the wheels turning inside your head.",
        "Reva: No. I was just thinking about jonathan and how he stood up for me tonight. I may finally be getting through to him.",
        "Jonathan: You're not getting to me, reva. You're not getting to me! Reva! Come on, mommy! Mommy! Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Lizzie: I think you're pathetic. I think you're absolutely desperate. Harley killed my dad. Are you just too stubborn or too stupid to believe it?",
        "Reva: Jonathan? Oh, my god."
