    "Transcript": [
        "Lizzie: You let Olivia coerce my dad into getting married right underneath your nose. What kind of shrink are you?",
        "Christopher: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: And you think she's not a witch, but you know what? I know she is. Do you know what she did? She told my mom and Aunt Alex that they couldn't go visit my dad with her permission. Her permission. Did you agree to that to? Well, did you, Dr. Langham?",
        "Christopher: Lizzie, I think we're dealing with a couple of different issues here.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, \"a couple of issues.\" Okay, great.",
        "Christopher: First, you're hurt over your father's marriage to Olivia and your feelings of anger toward her -- we'll get to that in a minute. But, as to your father's competency, I have examined him thoroughly and I believe he fully understood what he was doing.",
        "Lizzie: How can you say that? My dad stares at the walls for hours at a time. He can't even complete a full sentence.",
        "Christopher: Sometimes. And sometimes he's quite lucid. Lizzie, your father wanted to marry Olivia. Maybe it was a bad decision, and you certainly don't have to agree with it. But it was his decision and he was fully capable of making it.",
        "Lizzie: Well, there is only one way I will ever believe that and that's if I hear those exact same words come out of my father's mouth without Olivia present.",
        "Christopher: Well, your father's alone right now. Would you like to go and talk to him about it?",
        "Lizzie: Would I ever.",
        "Alexandra: Well, Alan, my dear, out with it, huh? Let's see what you've got up your sleeve. Well, you said you were going to come up with some way to mislead the board about Phillip's condition, make certain this meeting goes our way.",
        "Alan: Actually, Alexandra, I won't have to do a thing. A memo from Phillip to the board.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) Phillip was actually able to put pen to paper?",
        "Alan: Why, yes, haven't you heard? Phillip is feeling much better. In fact, he's feeling so good that he went off and got married and has planned to spend a little time off getting his affairs in order, and then, of course, he'll be returning, ready and rearing to go.",
        "Alexandra: Well, that certainly does sound like that will be so.",
        "Alan: Yes, he sounds fit, doesn't he? And sure of himself, too.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes, and the signature. ( Laughs)",
        "Alan: Phillip's, of course.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Well, masterfully, you've outdone yourself, dear. I just hope no one else realizes it's a fake.",
        "Alan: How would they? No one knows the truth about Phillip's illness except the family. No one will say anything. Beth, certainly not. She's as protective of Phillip and the bottom line of the family is the family is.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, but there are still some board members who quite troubled by Phillip's long absence.",
        "Alan: You mean, board members like Brad Green. Well, if you hadn't given him a seat on the board, Alexandra, things might be different.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Well, what else was I supposed to do, Alan? You and I both know what difficulties he can cause for us. And besides that, if you want to bring up unfortunate choices, what about your unfortunate choice? Bringing someone on this board. Should we talk about that?",
        "Alan: Wait a minute. Are you referring to my son, Gus?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, who we are all painfully aware is your son, Alan. But he doesn't happen to be a member of this board and he shouldn't be in on this meeting.",
        "Alan: He is family. Family takes precedence.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I certainly hope you can control him, then, my dear. Because if he says one wrong...",
        "Alan: Wait, wait. Alexandra, of course I can control Gus. Otherwise I'd be a fool to invite him here, wouldn't I?",
        "Alexandra: Well, you said it, not I.",
        "Jeffrey: I want to know everything that happens in that meeting, okay? Down to the least detail, especially anything about Antimonious.",
        "Gus: I'm on it. I'm on it.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, what about the books for Spaulding Pharmaceuticals? You got anything on that?",
        "Gus: I got a few files so far, but the mother lode is coming when I figure out a way how to finesse my Auntie Alex. But I'm working on an angle, you know. I just... I was up to 3:00 in the morning, that's why I'm so tired, just trying to figure out all the structure of the subsidiaries. It's... a lot.",
        "Jeffrey: Daunting.",
        "Gus: Well, not if you're Einstein, I guess.",
        "Jeffrey: You got to go.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'm going to have to go play Trojan Horse with my own father.",
        "Jeffrey: Keep in touch. (Sighs)",
        "Beth: Hey, there, stranger.",
        "Danny: You know, I could strangle you. Why didn't you come to me?",
        "Tony: Well, hello to you, too, Danny. Come to you about what? What are you...?",
        "Danny: Don't. Don't, don't play dumb. Don't insult me by playing dumb. You know what I'm talking about. What you did for me, what Eden did for Bill. I squeezed it all out of her, Tony. The connected crew guys that Bill accidentally put on Lewis Construction payroll; these meetings that you've been having with this Shadow person; Bruzi trying to recruit you in his war with...",
        "Tony: Okay, so I should have come to you, huh?",
        "Danny: Yeah, you should have come to me and tell me what's going down.",
        "Tony: So you could do what?",
        "Danny: What do you think? I would have dealt with Bruzi.",
        "Tony: Really? You would have? Because I had to do it and you know I had to do it. And I will keep... I will keep doing things, Danny.",
        "Danny: Not anymore. I'm involved in this now, got it? So tell me about this Shadow person. Do you know who it is?",
        "Tony: As far as I can tell...",
        "Danny: Do you know if he's got an angle or...?",
        "Tony: As far as I can tell, he was just passing on information, all right?",
        "Danny: No, Tony. Nobody does something like that for nothing. Now, did you get a good look at him? You didn't?",
        "Tony: No, that's why we called him \"The Shadow.\"",
        "Danny: What about the way he spoke?",
        "Tony: Well, he disguised his voice.",
        "Danny: I know that. I'm talking about his pattern of speech, the words he used. Did he sound well-educated or blue collar, what?",
        "Tony: Educated, yes, definitely. Vocabulary, he was... very articulate and he was very persuasive.",
        "Danny: So, what, a lawyer maybe, or a politician?",
        "Tony: I'm not sure. What about... what about... what about a professor? Hmm?",
        "Danny: Ross is all three, but that wouldn't make any sense. I mean, there's no way he'd help me. He'd love for me to not find out and lose the election. What about somebody in law enforcement? Frank Cooper.",
        "Tony: No, no, no. Again, what would be the motive for him to warn you?",
        "Danny: Yeah, but somebody in law enforcement make sense. This guy obviously has information on Salerno and Bruzi. There's Aitoro, right? He's a cop, an ex-Fed, law degree.",
        "Tony: Yeah, but being Eden's brother, she would have known. I mean, I will say he sounds like a pretty good fit, though.",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Tony: This guy, the Shadow, he was cocky like Aitoro is.",
        "Danny: So, okay. So this guy is cocky, he's not afraid to do something like this. So he's got to have a decent amount of power.",
        "Tony: Right.",
        "Danny: He's well-educated, articulate. He's got to be connected to law enforcement because he knows about Salerno and Bruzi. Who did I just describe?",
        "Tony: You think so?",
        "Danny: Well, there's one way to find out.",
        "Tony: Let's do it.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, Daddy. Do you have a minute?",
        "Phillip: Sure, honey.",
        "Lizzie: And how are you today?",
        "Phillip: I'm pretty good. How are you?",
        "Lizzie: I'm okay. Well, actually, I'm a little upset. But are you up to talking for a few minutes?",
        "Phillip: Sure.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, I'm kind of surprised that you actually married Olivia. But everyone else is, too. And I just don't know why. I mean, after everything she's done, I... How? I don't know how you could.",
        "Phillip: I love her?",
        "Lizzie: Are you asking me? Because I really don't think you do. I mean, how could you? I mean, the way she's been so mean to you. If she really loved you, why was she sneaking around and not telling any of us about the marriage?",
        "Phillip: She said you'd be upset.",
        "Lizzie: Well, can you blame us? Daddy, you're sick. You're sick and Olivia just took advantage of you. Yes, she did, Dad.",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Lizzie: She's brainwashed you, Dad.",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Lizzie: You think you really need her, but you don't!",
        "Phillip: Yes, I do.",
        "Lizzie: Why?",
        "Phillip: Well, because...",
        "Lizzie: Daddy, that's not a reason. That's not a reason.",
        "Christopher: Lizzie. Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: I don't think you know what you want! Daddy, please just say the word. Just tell Grandpa that you've changed your mind and then he can get the lawyers to annul the marriage tomorrow.",
        "Phillip: Don't want that.",
        "Lizzie: Then are we supposed to do nothing? Oh, nothing. You want us to do nothing. Daddy, this isn't about me or my feelings. This is about you. I'm worried about you, Dad. I feel like I'm losing you.",
        "Phillip: Never. Never.",
        "Lizzie: Marrying Olivia means you don't even care about your own life. How could you care about me?",
        "Jeffrey: So, now, I'm a total stranger just because, what? I wouldn't go to bed with you?",
        "Beth: Well, actually, I think that's debatable.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Beth: You might have if I'd given you the right encouragement. After all, I am irresistible.",
        "Jeffrey: And I'm a certifiable cad, right?",
        "Beth: Only I didn't encourage you much because it's obvious to me you're in love with someone else.",
        "Jeffrey: That phrase... you know, those two words...",
        "Beth: \"In love.\"",
        "Jeffrey: It's just, you know, I wouldn't use those words to, you know, describe...",
        "Beth: So how are things going with Marah? ( Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: Don't you have to be somewhere?",
        "Beth: I do, as a matter of fact. I have a briefcase full of proxies to vote at the Spaulding Board meeting.",
        "Jeffrey: And you left them there unattended?",
        "Beth: Mm-hmm. (Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: Well, go, woman. Go get them, and then go to your meeting, please.",
        "Beth: Jeffrey, I just want to say, in all sincerity, if you need someone to talk to, you have my number. I certainly have yours.",
        "Danny: Mr. DA! Mind if we join you? How's it going?",
        "Jeffrey: To what do I owe the honor?",
        "Danny: Well, it turns out that we have something in common, or someone, actually.",
        "Jeffrey: Who?",
        "Danny: Tony actually met the guy, not me. Right here in the parking garage.",
        "Tony: He never gave me his name.",
        "Danny: But from what he said and how he said it, we're pretty sure he was you.",
        "Alexandra: Look, Alan, you and I both know that Gus is not known for his subtlety. Now, this meeting is going require discretion. I mean, it's going to be essential.",
        "Alan: Alexandra, Gus will be fine.",
        "Alexandra: Fine. But one slipup, one wrong word, and I'll kill him.",
        "Alan: You want to talk about slipups? How about you going to bed and having an affair with Brad Green in Paris?",
        "Alexandra: All right...",
        "Alan: That was a slipup.",
        "Alexandra: And, Alan, that was ages and ages ago.",
        "Alan: Not the consequences.",
        "Brad: Hail, hail, the gang's all here. Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Ah, Brad.",
        "Alan: Brad, you're early.",
        "Brad: I guess I just couldn't wait to get started.",
        "Gus: Hey, hey, hey. Hi, everybody. Did I hear that the gang was all here? Glenn, how are you? Jason.",
        "Alan: Gus.",
        "Gus: Is this it?",
        "Alan: Well, Beth will be arriving shortly, and the rest are voting by proxy.",
        "Gus: Oh-oh. That's... well, that means I'm going to be left with a whole lot of these. Donuts. Can you freeze a donut? Does anybody know?",
        "Alexandra: Donuts? (Laughs)",
        "Gus: Yeah, because you know there's nothing like a delicious powdered jelly to fire up the thinking cap, you know. Of course, you could go with the chocolate and the glaze with the sprinkles on it. I also got a sticky bun in here. I don't want anybody to fight over it.",
        "Alexandra: Gus?",
        "Gus: Who wants a nice sticky bun, anybody?",
        "Alexandra: Gus, I've realized that it may de riguer down at the precinct, but... however, we have our meetings catered here with fine French pastries and such.",
        "Gus: No donuts then? No? Anybody? Glenn, Glenn, come on. I heard that your kid and his hockey team went all the way to the championship, huh? And he, Glenn Jr., was the top scorer. Is that right?",
        "Glenn: Five goals in one game.",
        "Gus: Five goals. Well, then I say a jelly donut for the Proud Papa. Come on.",
        "Glenn: Fine.",
        "Gus: You only live once. There you go. And, Jason, I've got a Bavarian cream filled right here with your name on it, because I heard you came back from a killer vacation, Swiss Alps.",
        "Jason: Uh, yeah.",
        "Gus: Pretty cool.",
        "Jason: Yeah. Would have like to stayed there longer, but, you know, duty called.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm sure it was a very important duty if you came back and left that powder behind, because I couldn't have done that, my friend. And I have a sticky bun in here. Bradley, my man, sticky bun?",
        "Brad: I'll pass.",
        "Gus: Oh. How about a donut hole?",
        "Brad: No, watching the carbs.",
        "Gus: I got it. More for me then. Excuse me.",
        "Alexandra: Gus hasn't been on a ski in his entire life. Now, the donuts? What the devil is he going to do?",
        "Alan: Alexandra, I'm sure there is a method to his madness.",
        "Alexandra: Really, really, really. Well, he'd better not mess up this meeting.",
        "Alan: Gentlemen, why don't we all get a cup of coffee and donut and look over the agenda until Beth arrives?",
        "Danny: See, it turns out that this mystery man... What are we calling him now?",
        "Tony: The Shadow.",
        "Danny: \"The Shadow.\"",
        "Jeffrey: \"The Shadow?\"",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Danny: It turns out that he gave me a very timely heads up. Really saved my neck, actually, the Lewis brothers, too. And the longer we sit here, the more convinced I am it was you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well... oh, Danny, come on. First of all, I'm confused. Are you accusing me of doing something nice for you? Wouldn't that be out of character for me?",
        "Tony: Very.",
        "Danny: It depends on what you thought you had to gain.",
        "Jeffrey: You've lost me.",
        "Danny: Okay. Then hear me out. I never thought of us as... How do I put this? As being on the same side. Maybe we still aren't. But I now know why you never opposed my campaign, why you even encouraged me to run, because it turns out that you and I maybe have some of the same interests. Am I right?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know. Are you?",
        "Tony: You told me not to tell him. He dragged it out of me.",
        "Jeffrey: \"Dragged it out of you?\" What are you talking...? (Laughs) Someone spiked my seltzer, I think.",
        "Danny: Why would you warn me that Bruzi's guys are on Lewis Construction payroll? What would be in it for you? Why wouldn't you just let me self- destruct so that Ross Marler could get elected? Because you know what would happen to this town if Salerno or Bruzi were to gain a foothold here. And you also know that as mayor, I would keep them out because I understand these guys much better than Ross Marler ever will.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny...",
        "Danny: Jeffrey. Now, I understand why you wouldn't warn me in person for obvious reasons.",
        "Tony: So you used me to do it for you. Operative word being \"used.\"",
        "Danny: Tony...",
        "Tony: No, you said your piece; now I'll say mine. O'Neill, I have no problem with what you did, but how you did it sucks.",
        "Jeffrey: I did it?",
        "Tony: Well, whatever. The point is... the point is if you need a message sent to someone, you ask me, man. If I'm down with it, I will do it. But what you will not do ever again is put Eden August in a situation that's got nothing to do with her or I will make sure that you clearly pay for your mistake. Are we clear?",
        "Beth: Am I late?",
        "Alan: You're right on time. Did you bring the proxies?",
        "Beth: Yes. India's, Mindy's, Blake's, and Harley's, to vote as I see fit.",
        "Alan: And that is with the family and the family's best interest and the best interest of your children.",
        "Beth: Of course, Alan. That goes without saying.",
        "Alan: Remember, Beth, blood matters, and in a crunch it's all that matters. Gentlemen, I think we can begin. You all know Beth. Um... As acting CEO of Spaulding Enterprises, I hereby call this meeting to order. Now, do I have a motion to wave the reading of the minutes of the last board meeting?",
        "Beth: Moved.",
        "Alan: Second. All in favor?",
        "Brad: Gus, you can't vote. You're not a board member.",
        "Gus: Oh, well. You saved my arm a lot of work out.",
        "Alan: Opposed? Well, do I have a motion to approve the agenda for the day?",
        "Beth: Moved.",
        "Alexandra: Second.",
        "Alan: All in favor?",
        "Gus: I learn quick. Don't worry.",
        "Alan: Well, I think we can begin then. The first item of agenda is the presentation of the Pharmaceuticals Division of Spaulding Enterprises. You all have a full report in your jacket, but Alexandra Spaulding and Brad will give a highlighted version of that and answer any questions that any of you may have. Alexandra, we'll start with you.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, well, initially all I want to say is that we've had an extraordinary quarter. And I think you'll find that the numbers speak for themselves. Other then that, I'm going to let Brad fill you in on the details, and I may want to add my two cents worth later.",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Brad: Well, since our last meeting, I'm happy to report that the most important news is that our Pharmaceuticals Division is now firmly and happily ensconced in our state-of-the-art facility on Fifth Street. Our lab is fully operational and so efficient that we are increasing production on two of our top sellers.",
        "Gus: Like Antimonious, right? That's one of your biggest money makers.",
        "Brad: Antimonious is one of our profitable offerings. That's correct. You'll find the numbers for that on page...",
        "Gus: Page seven. I got it. I got it right here. And it also says that Antimonious is doing very, very well in the United States. What about overseas?",
        "Brad: Overseas numbers are on page eight.",
        "Gus: Page...",
        "Brad: Now if you'll note on pages ten through twelve, we're currently awaiting FDA approval on two drugs which we feel will be extraordinary profit centers.",
        "Alexandra: All right, actually, Brad, excuse me for interrupting. But, you know, the biggest news we have really in our division isn't the pharmaceuticals; it happens to be the cosmetic division. Isn't that right, Brad?",
        "Brad: Well...",
        "Alexandra: And you know what? Primarily it's because we have reached our demographic target. Actually, that's the pre-teens and the teen consumers. When we launched Bad Girl, this new product, last summer, it blew the market apart. It's been phenomenal. As a matter of fact, you will find those numbers on page fifteen, actually, fifteen. It has been one phenomenal success, I guarantee you.",
        "Jason: Sure has.",
        "Glenn: With a minimal investment on our part, too.",
        "Brad: Well, that's relative, isn't it?",
        "Alexandra: Well, let me say that it was relative. But with the success of this new line, Bad Girl, it's... there's no longer any doubt. What we have to do is we have to capitalize on this immediately -- which means that the board has to vote for an increased budget, you know, fast. We have to move on this. We have to promote this product while it's hot, and we have to do it properly.",
        "Brad: Respectfully, that would be Alexandra's opinion. Mine is that the market for Bad Girl is limited and that we've saturated it. Therefore, any increased expenditure on this product is foolish.",
        "Gus: Why exactly do you feel the market is limited and saturated?",
        "Brad: Gus, don't take offense, but I believe you're here to listen and to learn as a courtesy. Any questions that you may ask are completely inappropriate.",
        "Glenn: Then I'll ask the question, because I'm wondering the same thing Gus is.",
        "Jason: Why do you think you can't grow this market, Brad?",
        "Alexandra: Actually I'll be interested in hearing your answer to that, too, Brad.",
        "Alan: As well as I, Brad.",
        "Brad: Well, then, I'll be happy to tell you. The consumers that Alexandra so covets, the teens and the pre-teens, who indeed may set the trends and think they know what they want to buy. Actually, their mothers do the buying.",
        "Gus: Wait a second. Teenagers, girls, don't they have something that's called an \"allowance,\" where they buy things that they want to buy like clothing and perfume?",
        "Brad: Well, nonetheless, our research shows that these...",
        "Gus: Bradley, I'm just saying, go to any mall in America and you will see that these kids, they're buying everything and anything they want to, hand over fist. And if they're not buying it, they're having their mother do it for them. I mean, am I right?",
        "Beth: As the mother of a teenage daughter, I have to agree with Gus.",
        "Brad: Well, Gus, I had no idea that you were so eager to see Bad Girl's budget increase. Perhaps it's because that your girlfriend, Harley, wears the perfume.",
        "Gus: I don't have a girlfriend. I have a fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Brad: Fianc\u00e9e. And I must say, it smells lovely on her. Or perhaps you're so keen on increasing this budget because your sister, Eden, Bad Girl's spokeswoman, stands to gain from the profit of the perfume.",
        "Gus: Well, now, you see, I find that strange, because I thought we all have something to gain from Bad Girl's success, considering it is a Spaulding product and we are all employees of Spaulding. And some of us are actually more Spaulding than others. But, then again, what would I know, right? Because you're the executive and I'm... I'm just a dumb cop, right?",
        "Alan: Gus, I think, after today, there's not a person in this board meeting who will think you're dumb.",
        "Gus: All right. Well, that's the case, why don't we inject a little bit more research on the whole teen demographic thing. You know, and we'll find out if our research the first time and if it was wrong, well, then we will inject more money into the Bad Girl campaign, then we'll see how we do. So, you know, how does sound? Great? So moved. All in favor?",
        "Brad: Excuse me. You can't make a motion.",
        "Gus: I keep doing that. I'm sorry. Somebody else make the motion. Alexandra, you want to make it? Wait, wait. Just... let me just back up for a second. I don't want ruin my whole brainstorming momentum here. I just want to go back to the Antimonious thing for a second. Is that okay? Now I...",
        "Alexandra: Gus.",
        "Gus: Oh, this will take a second. Just a second, okay? I have a... I have a report here. I noticed a problem with an oversea shipment, particularly in Russia, based on this fax... this fax. Of course, it was in Russian, but then it was translated and believe me the translation is lame.",
        "Brad: Where did you get that document?",
        "Gus: This? I got it from your office. But anyway, the whole thing, there's a loss and breakage report here of those shipments, and it's through the roof. I mean, is this normal?",
        "Alan: Let me see this. Yes, they do seem a bit high.",
        "Brad: Gus, since you're so new to Spaulding, you wouldn't know this, but sometimes our overseas subsidiaries try to cover their sloppy accounting by shifting the blame back to us claiming that they didn't get product. Unfortunately it's a common occurrence.",
        "Alan: Yes, Gus. I'm sure this is probably what happened here. So we will look into this, though, and thank you for bringing it to our attention.",
        "Secretary: Mr. Spaulding. We finally have that call from Singapore. Shall I put them on hold?",
        "Alan: Oh, no, no. Excuse me, I need to take this phone call. So, if we all take a five minute break, I'll be right back.",
        "Brad: Now I have a question for you, Gus.",
        "Gus: Shoot, Bradley.",
        "Brad: What were you doing snooping around my office?",
        "Tony: I asked you a question, O'Neill. Are we clear about Eden?",
        "Jeffrey: So nice to know that chivalry isn't dead.",
        "Tony: Well, in this line of work, we leave women out of our business dealings.",
        "Jeffrey: And why is that, Tony?",
        "Tony: Well, among other things, they could get hurt.",
        "Danny: Okay, well, however it went down, whoever was involved, I would just like you to know that we're honored now. Tony and I have dealt with our fair share turf wars in our day.",
        "Jeffrey: No, Danny, not like this, you haven't. It's just some big elements here that you guys are not grasping.",
        "Tony: Please enlighten us.",
        "Jeffrey: Why?",
        "Tony: Well, why not?",
        "Jeffrey: Why?",
        "Tony: Enlighten us.",
        "Jeffrey: Why have two crime families chosen this moment and time to come here and wage war in Springfield? Little old Springfield? Must be something lucrative. Lucrative enough to shed blood over. Something with a lot of profits. And whoever is willing to go after those profits is going to win the day. Any ideas?",
        "Tony: Yeah, I know what you're talking about. There's only one operation that could fit that description.",
        "Danny: Drugs.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, I'll have a vodka tonic with a twist, please.",
        "Bartender: Minus the vodka.",
        "Lizzie: No, actually, I have ID.",
        "Bartender: Fake ID.",
        "Lizzie: You obviously don't know who I am. I'm Elizabeth Spaulding, okay? Olivia Spencer Spaulding is my stepmother, co-owner of this hotel and your boss. So I'd like my drink the way I ordered. Thank you.",
        "Sandy: Without the booze.",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing, Sandy?",
        "Sandy: You first.",
        "Lizzie: Well, let's see, I could be moving on with my life, or having fun, or doing what might therapist calls \"making a bad decision.\"",
        "Sandy: I vote for the last one.",
        "Lizzie: So what? Everyone makes bad decisions, including everyone in my family. So I'm in good company.",
        "Sandy: Actually, as of now, you're in my company.",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing?",
        "Sandy: Have a seat.",
        "Lizzie: What is your problem?",
        "Sandy: Right now, you are. You're underage and you're about to have a drink.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, like you have never had an illegal drink?",
        "Sandy: That's beside the point.",
        "Lizzie: Not to me, it's not.",
        "Sandy: Well, this isn't about you. This is about me. And if you think you're going to mess me up, you can think again.",
        "Lizzie: Mess you up how? Huh?",
        "Sandy: Romeo and Juliet. The play I'm directing. You have a substantial role in it.",
        "Lizzie: So what?",
        "Sandy: So Springfield High has zero-tolerance alcohol policy. One strike you're out, which means if you get caught drinking in here, you'll be expelled. Which means you wouldn't be able to do the play, which means I'd have to scramble to find a replacement and the show would suffer. Which means a whole lot of people would be really ticked off at you, especially me.",
        "Lizzie: Well, maybe I'm so miserable right now, I don't care who I hurt because of it, okay?",
        "Sandy: Wouldn't be the first time. What? No bratty come back? Now, that is a first.",
        "Lizzie: Just leave me alone, okay? You don't know anything.",
        "Sandy: Are we about to cry?",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Sandy: Oh, I'm impressed. Too bad you can't do that on stage, you might have a real career ahead of you. You sure you want to do that? Because I got news for you, Princess: I hit back.",
        "Gus: Snooping? No. No, you see when my father... sorry, when Alan, the CEO of Spaulding Enterprises, asked me to familiarize myself with the company, he said, \"Go ahead and read everything and anything you could get your hands on that's not tied down and marked confidential.\" So I made a copy of this fax from your office. If it was marked \"CONFIDENTIAL,\" well, then, I'm sorry if I missed it. (Laughs)",
        "Brad: You're a quick study, Gus.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm here to listen and learn.",
        "Alan: I apologize for that. Ladies and gentlemen, please let's get this meeting started again. I think the next item on the agenda is Phillip's absence. Now I think everyone here knows that Phillip has not been well for the past few months.",
        "Lizzie: Go ahead. You wouldn't dare.",
        "Sandy: Why wouldn't I? Because you're a girl? Because you're a Spaulding? You think any of that matters to me, Lizzie? You barely know me. You don't know what I'm capable of.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I am so scared. I'm shaking.",
        "Sandy: My dad... well, the guy I thought was my dad, had big fists and a short temper. Ergo, I have a lot of rage in me, and I couldn't take it out on him.",
        "Lizzie: So you're going to take it out on me. Yeah, I really believe that.",
        "Sandy: You know what? Just listen for a second. All I know is that I grew up in a world of hurt, but I didn't go out and take it out on other people. I simply got myself out of there and took care of me, because no one else would. And maybe it's time you did the same thing. Or you can keep being the brat everyone thinks you are. Be reckless, get busted in some warped attempt to stick it to your stepmother, but do it after the play's over. Don't take the rest of us down with you.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. I won't do that to you or anyone else. This play is, like, the best thing going on in my life right now, and you...",
        "Sandy: Me, what?",
        "Lizzie: You've paid more attention to me in the past five minutes than my entire family has in this past five weeks. How pathetic is that?",
        "Sandy: It is pathetic... for them. It's their loss.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, you're right. It is their loss. (Laughs) Thanks for talking with me. We should do this again sometime. Maybe... I don't know, go get coffee or something. You can help me out with my dysfunctional family some more.",
        "Sandy: Maybe, but right now we should get you back home before everyone finds out your AWOL. Okay? Come on.",
        "Danny: You were saying?",
        "Jeffrey: There's a new drug on the streets. It's a pharmaceutical cut with meth. It's very cheap to produce, and therefore very profitable.",
        "Tony: I know what you're talking about. D.",
        "Jeffrey: Give the man a cigar.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I've heard of it.",
        "Jeffrey: The trafficking seems limited right now, and the volume on the street seems minimal. That's only because there aren't established pipelines to move the stuff yet, but once this stuff catches on, whoever has established an infrastructure, whoever gets the business...",
        "Danny: Will make a serious killing.",
        "Jeffrey: Exactly. Something worth fighting over, don't you think?",
        "Danny: Do you have any idea how soon this expansion will occur?",
        "Jeffrey: It's already happening, Danny. Kids are dropping D on the street as we speak.",
        "Tony: All right, well, where are they getting it? Where is coming from?",
        "Jeffrey: We don't know. We have no idea. For all we know someone could be making it right here in our own backyard.",
        "Alan: Phillip has gone through some very hard times in the past few months, and that's why I have temporarily stepped in as CEO. But I am happy to tell you that he has made a full recovery. In fact, he's feeling so well, he ran off and got married.",
        "Brad: Married?",
        "Alan: Yes, to Olivia Spencer. The immediate family was there. As a matter of fact, he's feeling so well he wants to take a little time off for the honeymoon and enjoy his new bride. But he did want me to let you know that he will be back very soon, and he wanted me to hand out this memo that he's written to all of you.",
        "Alexandra: As matter of fact, we're all very grateful that he's recovering quite so beautifully.",
        "Alan: Now, I think we all know that our stockholders are happiest when a complementive Spauldings are running the ship. So I would like to propose that Gus take Phillip's seat until he returns here on the board.",
        "Olivia: That won't be necessary, Alan. Hi, everybody. Well, now that I'm a Spaulding and Phillip's wife, I'm sure that you'll agree that the best person to represent his interest is me.",
        "Alexandra: Next on Guiding Light",
        "Olivia: Gus, you're the new Spaulding. You want so badly to be on the board. What's your agenda?",
        "Billy: Wait a second. Wait a second. Did you feel that?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Billy: Whoa!"
