        "Trying to find something on Sandy, Jonathan goes to the house where he finds a \"shrine\" of Tammy's things. Sandy admits to Tammy that he isn't taking her back to the farm and tells her to call Jonathan. He instead takes her to meet Nicole who says she is his girlfriend. When Jonathan meets up with them he tells Sandy he found Tammy's stuff and Sandy just laughs that Nicole is a fill in until he gets Tammy back. Jonathan takes Tammy to see what Sandy still has of hers, but Sandy is too quick and boxes it all up and pretends he was bringing it back to her. Cassie insists that Jeffrey tell her all of the times he posed as Richard. He tells her that he fell in love with her while pretending to be the prince. This doesn't phase Cassie until he brings Dinah by who tells her that Jeffrey used to pretend that she was Cassie while having sex with her. The kids ask Frank about Gus and Beth saves him, he thanks her for helping out and she says that it is a shame the kids are always the ones who get put in the middle. Frank is impressed later when he runs into Dinah who says she isn't jealous at all of Harley and Mallet's friendship. Mallet tells Harley that he can't let what happened between them go, and wants to know if there is any possibility of a future with them. She says that she can't replace Gus and tells him to go and be happy with Dinah. She then tells the kids that Gus isn't coming back. Mallet finds Dinah outside of a store where the clerk has accused her of shoplifting. He claims that as a cop he will take care of it and picks her up and carries her away, again."

        "Jonathan: I know that Sandy called in that anonymous tip to the cops, Billy. Well, then I'll get proof. You don't know the freak like I do. He still wants Tammy, and he thinks if he gets me out of the way, he can worm his way back into her life, and be the golden boy again. But, uh... you know what I say to that? He's dead wrong.",

        "Sandy: Music?",
        "Tammy: Sure.",
        "Sandy: Take your pick.",
        "Tammy: This isn't the way to the farmhouse. Where are we going? Sandy?",
        "Sandy: You're right, this isn't the way to your mom's house. I'm taking you some place else, first.",
        "Tammy: Where?",
        "Sandy: It's a surprise.",
        "Tammy: Um, okay. A surprise.",

        "Tammy: Calling Jonathan. I told him I'd meet him later, so now I'm going to be late.",
        "Sandy: That's a good idea. You call Jonathan and you tell him you'll meet up with him later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I can make this easy for us. Either we find a way to resolve this and you find a way to believe me, or... I can walk right back out that door right now and not come back. You choose.",
        "Cassie: Do you think I want to doubt you, Jeffrey? All I want to do is love you.",
        "Jeffrey: But you went to the C.I.A.? You went to this guy Malone. How did you get a hold of him, anyway?",
        "Cassie: I used a connection. And he told me that all of the records from the time you were undercover had been shredded.",
        "Jeffrey: So all of the doubts started coming back to you?",
        "Cassie: You know what, I can't live like this.",
        "Jeffrey: Neither can I.",
        "Cassie: Have you really told me everything there is to know now, Jeffrey, or are you still holding something back?",
        "Jeffrey: Why?",
        "Cassie: I want to put this aside and move on, but I can't because I'm pretty sure you're still keeping something from me.",

        "Frank: Tell me, you guys, what was the most exciting thing you did at school today?",
        "Jude: We made a snowman.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Mallet... if you want to pay your respects to my husband, you can do that by forgetting what we did. Because as far as I'm concerned, it never happened.",
        "Mallet: Can you live with that?",
        "Harley: Absolutely.",

        "Beth: Guys, you know what? There's some hot chocolate over there and it's got your names on it. Come on, go get it. Hmm? Yum!",
        "Frank: Oh, Beth, thanks for that. When Zach, you know, said he wanted to talk to Gus, I had no idea what to tell him?",
        "Beth: So they are asking for Gus a lot?",
        "Frank: They're asking all of the time, and they know something's up. Harley has got to tell them, I mean like today.",
        "Beth: If there's anything I can do for you guys you know just...",
        "Frank: Thank you, I appreciate that. Here you've lost your own husband, and now you're looking out for us. That's amazing.",
        "Beth: I do hate to see kids get hurt. They all seem to get stuck in the middle when adults do terrible things to each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Why are you doing this? Hey, where is this coming from? The other morning after we woke up, you said to me it didn't count. Those were your words.",
        "Mallet: I know, I was trying to make you feel better. And I was trying to convince myself that was true.",
        "Harley: You know what, it was a moment of weakness, that's it.",
        "Mallet: I think it was a little more than that.",
        "Harley: It was a terrible thing to do, to other people. It was an unforgivable, awful, awful thing. Don't forget that.",
        "Mallet: I'm not forgetting that. I completely agree. What are we going to do? We love each other? We've loved each other for years?",
        "Harley: Okay. But I married Gus, okay. And I love Gus.",
        "Mallet: I know that.",
        "Harley: And he is gone now. You know, I barely get the news and we're... you know, that is just... so, please, if you really do love me, if you do, then just forget about what happened. Please, just forget about it.",
        "Mallet: I would like to do that, believe me, I would, for your sake because I don't want to cause you anymore pain. But what happened, happened for a reason. And you wanting that to go away, and wishing that would go away, is only going to make it worse. Tell me I'm wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: What are you doing?",
        "Jeffrey: I tried. I tried to make this all go away. In our lives, in my records, in my head.",
        "Cassie: I need to know, Jeffrey. I need to know how many times did I think Richard was tying R.J.'s shoe, or squeezing my hand, or helping me with my coat when it was you.",
        "Jeffrey: Does it really matter?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it matters. I need to know how many of my memories of my dead husband were lies and how many were real.",
        "Jeffrey: You want to know, no matter what it does to us?",
        "Cassie: No matter what.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, Cassie, fine, there is something. There is something that I have been keeping from you.",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't tell you I was impersonating Richard because during that time, something happened, I did something that I'm ashamed of. But I never thought that you would find out. But you have a right to know.",
        "Cassie: All right, what is it? What did you do?",
        "Jeffrey: Just, please, try to understand. I knew that it was wrong at the time, but I couldn't stop myself.",
        "Cassie: Am I going to want to hear this?",
        "Jeffrey: Probably not.",
        "Cassie: But I need to, so... tell me what you did.",
        "Jeffrey: When I was down there, I did something unforgivable, Cassie. I fell in love with you.",

        "Tammy: So how long have you two been seeing each other.",
        "Sandy: Not long, a few weeks.",
        "Nicole: Three and a half weeks, but who's counting. It feels longer though, doesn't it?",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry, is this weird? Me introducing you two?",
        "Tammy: No. I think it's great.",
        "Nicole: Me, too. Sandy told me what happened between you guys and I just think it is so great that you could come out of it as friends. And he told me that you're seeing someone else, too, and that you're really happy with him.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I am.",
        "Sandy: Jonathan. This is Tammy's boyfriend. Why don't you join us. There's somebody I want to you meet.",

        "Frank: Oh, Dinah, hi. How are you?",
        "Dinah: Good. Hello.",
        "Frank: What are you doing out here? I thought you roped Mallet into going shopping with you.",
        "Dinah: Well, yes, we did go shopping, but we shopped until he dropped. ( Laughter ) Then we ran into Harley and he's with her now, but I'll see them later on.",
        "Frank: Really?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Frank: How is that with you?",
        "Dinah: How's what?",
        "Frank: Harley spending so much time with Mallet.",
        "Dinah: Frank, I mean, come on. They're both grieving Gus, and Gus is gone.",
        "Frank: Wow, that's very mature of you.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I am sounding a bit sane and wise these days. I don't know, maybe your sister is rubbing off on me.",
        "Frank: Or maybe Mallet is.",
        "Dinah: Him? No. Let's hope not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Can we talk about us?",
        "Harley: There is no \"us.\"",
        "Mallet: There has always been an us. It's why I took the warden's job.",
        "Harley: I didn't ask you to.",
        "Mallet: It's why I followed you and Gus to New York.",
        "Harley: I didn't ask you to.",
        "Mallet: It's why I work for the Springfield P.D. It's why I am here.",
        "Harley: I didn't ask you to do any of those things.",
        "Mallet: You accepted all of it. I mean, you protested a little bit, but you never told me to leave. I think you needed me as much as I needed you. Listen, I've never pressed you on this before. I know you love Gus, I know you married Gus and I know you were happy, but I'm moving on. Okay. I like Dinah, I really do. I like this girl, but the other day when we were sitting in the booth, all three of us, you talk about uncomfortable. I'm not doing that again, okay. I mean, not to you, or me or especially to her.",
        "Harley: Uh-uh, me neither.",
        "Mallet: But the other night when we were together, oh, man, it was... it was beautiful. It was tender. It was easy, and it was comfortable. The situation was a little awkward, and you know, odd and weird, and the circumstances, and I was holding back a little bit, but it wasn't because of you. It wasn't because of you. I desired-- I always desired you. I love you; I always have. I'm at home in your arms. You've become a beautiful, beautiful woman. And that's why I have to ask you this.",
        "Harley: Oh, God. Mallet.",
        "Mallet: I'm sorry. I know the timing is awful. I'm sorry for this, and I truly am, but waiting for an answer is not going to change anything. Let's do this for our sake, for Dinah's sake. I think it's our last chance. I think we have to decide. Okay, so maybe not now or a week from now or a year from now, but you have to tell me, do you think that you and I will ever be together again? I mean, do you think that there'll be an us again? You've got to tell me that. You've got to tell me that now.",

Jonathan and Tammy, it's a hot couple because it's forbidden. See Jonathan, Wednesday, February 8, inside \"The Light\".",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You fell in love with me before I even knew you? When?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know the exact time or place. All I know is that I was always in your orbit, always around you and when I was, I watched you and I listened to you and I saw how you were, and how you were with children, how much you loved them. I saw how fierce you were when you fought for something that you believed in. When I looked into your eyes, you have beautiful eyes, I saw your tenderness and your kindness. And before I knew it, you were all I was thinking about all of the time.",
        "Cassie: While you were pretending to be Richard?",
        "Jeffrey: When I realized what was happening, I told the agency that I wanted out, that I had to get out of there, to please give me a transfer, and they said no. No way. It's non-negotiable, you've got to stay. There is no one else who can do this job, no one else who is qualified. No one else looked exactly like Richard Winslow and that's what this was about. It was about Richard, protecting Richard.",
        "Cassie: And me and the children, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie... When I realized how much I cared for you, I knew I had to leave. But that's also why I couldn't. I wasn't down there all of the time, it wasn't always me, but I was there, and when I was, I felt like such a trader because Richard would come up to me and he would smile at me and shake my hand, and say what a wonderful job I was doing, and I could only think to myself, man if you only knew. If you only knew how much I wanted your wife. How I wanted her more than anything and anyone ever. In my whole life.",
        "Cassie: ( Laughing ) Wow, this is-- I guess I should be mad at you. And I am, I'm mad at you for keeping this from me and deceiving me, but there is a part of me that is also-- isn't this every woman's dream?",
        "Jeffrey: You were another man's wife, Cassie. You belonged to someone else.",
        "Cassie: But you didn't act on these feelings. Is this the big, terrible secret you were keeping because this isn't so awful. It is actually kind of sweet.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't say that, because--",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Jeffrey: Because that's not all, it is worse than what you think.",
        "Dinah: No!",
        "Jeffrey: Just tell her.",
        "Dinah: I just said no. I don't know what your point is here.",
        "Jeffrey: She has a right to know.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, I already had a long talk with Dinah how she went to Europe pretending to me, and you would join her there and pretending to be Richard.",
        "Jeffrey: Join her, that is a news euphemism.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, join her? You were together.",
        "Jeffrey: We were together, right.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey.",
        "Cassie: Oh, so before you both came to Springfield, you...",
        "Jeffrey: Please.",
        "Dinah: Yes. Yes, we were together before we were together before we got here. Why don't you let this go.",
        "Jeffrey: What is your problem? This is your big shot, Dinah. This is your big shot to get back at Cassie and at me all in one swell swoop, so go for it.",
        "Dinah: Because I don't need to do that anymore. I've gone beyond that. And if you tell her everything, it's only going to hurt her. Why don't you tell me the point of what you're doing.",
        "Cassie: There's more to tell. What else can you say?",
        "Jeffrey: Just tell her, Dinah. Tell her how much I loved her. Tell her how in love I was with her. How obsessed with her I was. Just tell her that.",
        "Dinah: Okay, fine, yes. He was obsessed with you. He was madly, crazy in love with you. He loved it just as much as I did, dressing up and pretending. He would call me by your name sometimes when we were together.",
        "Jeffrey: Keep going.",
        "Dinah: He would whisper your name in my ear. When we were alone at the hotel, when we were together, when we were in bed making love, he would pretend I was you.",

        "Nicole: It's nice to meet you.",
        "Jonathan: So you're dating again?",
        "Sandy: Dating and taking classes at the university. In fact, Tammy and I are in the same business class. We may be in the same study group.",
        "Jonathan: Imagine that. You know, something really funny happened today. Some underaged kids came into Outskirts with fake I.D.'s and we served them. Somehow the cops found out about that and they're threatening to take away my liquor license.",
        "Sandy: Ouch, that sucks.",
        "Tammy: Okay, you guys have fun tonight. It was nice to meet you. Come on.",
        "Jonathan: I know you set me up, freak. By the way, I was just in your room and saw you're little shrine for Tammy.",
        "Sandy: Shrine, shrine. I prefer to think of it as a guest space waiting for Tammy to come back into my life. To me.",

        "Mallet: Believe me, I hate that I have to do this now. I just... I'm trying to avoid a disaster down the line. What's your answer?",

        "Zach: At school.",
        "Harley: Oh, at school. That's cool.",
        "Frank: Yes, it's very, very cool. And we'd love to tell you about it, but we'll do that inside because it's freezing out here. Come on, guys, let's go.",
        "Harley: Yeah, go inside with Uncle Frank. I'll see you guys in a minute.",
        "Zach: Mommy, when's Gus coming home?",
        "Harley: I am going to talk to you about that-- inside, okay?",
        "Frank: Come on, Zach, let's go inside. Come on, guys. All right.",
        "Harley: They have no idea it's just the three of us again. You know, you have children and you have this whole lifetime with them. These soccer games and trick-or- treating and Easter egg hunts. High school and college, and then they get married, and they have their own kids. This whole lifetime. It's a lifetime now without Gus. I have to figure out how I'm going to do this. How am I going to do this?",
        "Mallet: That's what I'm telling you. You don't have to do this alone. If you tell me... if you tell me that there's hope between us, I will wait. I've waited ten years; I'll wait ten more years. I'll wait for you as long as it takes, okay. But if you tell me there's no hope, then I will walk out the door. I'll close that door and I'll move on. Because if I'm going to be with Dinah, I'm going to be with Dinah 100%. And I'll never look back. She deserves that. You understand?",
        "Harley: I understand that you have become a wonderful man. And I still love you. I was reminded of how much the other night, just like you... I guess our hearts never moved on, huh?",
        "Mallet: No.",
        "Harley: But, Mallet, my life did. If I had never met Gus, would I be with you? Yes. But I can't pretend that Gus never happened. I can't pretend that I didn't love him, that I don't still love him. No one can ever replace him. No one should. He deserves that much, don't you think?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Harley: So... so you... you go, and you be with Dinah. Because you deserve someone who only wants you. You deserve that, okay?",
        "Mallet: Okay. Go inside. It's cold.",

        "Dinah: I know that all of this sounds so weird, but it's only because Jeffrey really did love you. He was crazy in love with you. Before you even knew he existed, when he had no hope you'd ever even know him, much less love him, he protected you for years, looked out for you like he was really your husband. You didn't just have one prince, Cassie, you had two. I think that's why I hated you so much. Because first you took Hart from me, and then you took Jeffrey. Before you even knew it, you took him. Are you all right?",
        "Cassie: I don't know.",
        "Dinah: Well, you know what? I think I'm going to go. Just create a mess and leave, right? That's what the two of you expect of me. But I don't want to do that anymore.",

        "Dinah: What did you accomplish here, really? I'm sorry.",

        "Jeffrey: I could tell you there is nothing more, but I don't know if you would believe me.",

        "Jonathan: Listen. He has a shrine of you. He's got pictures of you, he's got candles, he's got other stuff of yours you left behind. He's got your engagement ring. He's got a hair brush. The kid has problems.",
        "Tammy: With the truth, but not...",
        "Jonathan: No, no, no. He still loves you, and he hates my guts and he wants me out of the picture. I know he's the one that set up that Outskirts bust.",
        "Tammy: How could Sandy possibly know you were serving to minors? You didn't even know yourself.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I asked around. And apparently a guy in the college sold those kids those fake I.D.'s. His description: It's Sandy.",

        "Sandy: Actually, I've got something to do.",
        "Nicole: You'll call me later?",

        "Woman: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Dinah: I think this will be perfect for my boyfriend, but I can't tell if it is purple or blue or indigo. What? Oh, my gosh, you think I'm stealing or shoplifting. No, no, no. I brought this out here so I can see it under the street lights.",
        "Woman: When have I heard that before?",
        "Dinah: Probably several times because it's true. I cannot believe that you thought I was trying to steal this. And you still do. Look, lady, I don't have to steal anything from your snotty little store; I have plenty of cash. If I had wanted to steal this scarf, trust me you wouldn't have seen me do it. I'm that good!",

        "Jude: And that's Zach.",
        "Harley: And that's Gus, right?",
        "Jude: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Listen, guys. I want you to put your crayons down and listen to me. I have to tell you something. I have to tell you something important. About Gus. Gus is not... he's not coming home. Okay? And it is a long story, and I'm going to try to explain it to you the best way I can.",

        "Tammy: I've had enough, can we just go, please?",
        "Jonathan: I want you to see what a freak he is. Your mom owns the place.",
        "Tammy: Not good breaking into rooms, not good policy.",
        "Sandy: You guys. What a coincidence. I was just on my way to see you.",
        "Tammy: You were?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I wanted to give you this, the stuff you left here when we split up. It has been sitting here in the cabin waiting. Your brush, photos, other stuff. Sorry, is this awkward? Am I interrupting something?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Sandy: Bad timing?",
        "Tammy: It's fine.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it's almost like you read our minds.",
        "Sandy: Well I'm sorry it took so long to get this stuff to you, but I've got to go. I'll see you on campus?",

        "Jeffrey: That's okay. You're mad at him and you're mad at me.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you're right, I'm mad at him. I'm mad at Richard for not being as perfect as I thought he was, and I'm mad at you for tainting my memories of him, and I'm mad at me for being fooled by both of you and for loving you when I don't even know who you are anymore.",
        "Jeffrey: Does anyone know who anyone really is?",
        "Cassie: Oh, that is such a copout.",
        "Jeffrey: No. Really, no. Look at me, look at me. What do you see? Who do you see? Who do you want me to be? Do you see Jeffrey or Richard?",
        "Cassie: I don't know!",
        "Jeffrey: Well that's just it, exactly! You don't know. And I don't. What I do know is I have this face and that is not going to change! And I'm not an idiot. I also know that that face is why-- it is part of why you love me, and it is also why you will never love me like you loved him. I guess the real question is: Can I deal with that? Can you deal with that? I don't know, who knows? I've got to get out of here.",

        "Frank: Hey. I'll tell you what, why don't we draw another picture? What do you think, huh, Zach? How about a little doggie? Can you draw a little doggie. Oh, so cold evening breaks, consumed in dark no more day to hold me the sounds won't stay to play their part only what strangers told me why is the ghost coolest sounds so cold and alone all of the known hearts a word for gone...",
