        "Buzz: Gesundheit.",
        "Coop: Thank you. Look, I know your shorthanded today. I'm just saying I can come in if you need me to make there.",
        "Buzz: It's just that my customers have a thing about wait people sneezing in their food.",
        "Coop: Yeah, go figure.",
        "Buzz: Just try to get some rest and try to get better. I'll be with you in a minute, okay? Anything you need?",
        "Coop: ( Sneezes ) I'm cool.",
        "Buzz: Just try to stay warm, okay, and I'll check in with you later. Okay? Feel better.",
        "Announcer: The role of Lizzie Spaulding is being played by Marcy Rylan.",
        "Coop: ( Sneezes )",
        "Lizzie: Bathroom's all yours. ( Coop coughing )",
        "Lizzie: Coop? Oh, no. Tell me you're not getting sick. You told me you never get sick. I'm going to go get you some vitamin \"C.\"",
        "Coop: I think I'm a little past the whole vitamin stage here.",
        "Lizzie: I'll get whatever they have for a cold.",
        "Coop: I don't think have anything for a cold here.",
        "Lizzie: Don't say that.",
        "Coop: Is it hot in here? I mean, do I feel hot to you?",
        "Lizzie: Um... oh, yeah and not in a good way. Stay under the covers and I'll come back with stuff. You just can't be sick, okay?",
        "Buzz: Ava, look, honey, can you run to the bank and make the morning deposit? Coop called in sick.",
        "Ava: Is he okay?",
        "Buzz: It's just a cold, but he sounds miserable. It's just you and me now.",
        "Ava: Yeah, yikes. I'll be right back.",
        "Buzz: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Sit down.",
        "Reva: Okay, but I can only stay for a minute because I have to get to the office.",
        "Billy: How's your first week going?",
        "Reva: Oh, not too bad, but I do spend most of the day pounding the stapler as hard as I can just so I can keep smiling at Olivia.",
        "Billy: Well, you're both still alive; now that's progress.",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Billy: Hey, have you given any thought to telling Josh she pushed me off the wagon?",
        "Reva: I can't do it. You know, I made so many mistakes with him as it is. And every time I poke at Olivia, I always end up looking like the bad guy, and then it makes me feel like doing something worse.",
        "Billy: Good for you. Yeah I say if Josh wants to go down that path again, let him. It's time for us to just look ahead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Josh?",
        "Josh: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: I'm going to get some coffee, what can I get for you?",
        "Josh: Nothing, thank you, I'll go later.",
        "Olivia: Will you let somebody do something for you, please.",
        "Josh: Okay, um, grande soy no whipped, mocha.",
        "Olivia: Was that difficult?",
        "Josh: No, that was easy.",
        "Olivia: Yep. There you go. I'll be back.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Olivia: Hey. You're welcome. Good to see you.",
        "Cassie: It is so good to see you. We keep missing each other at the Beacon.",
        "Olivia: Well he keeps me busy. I'm sorry--",
        "Cassie: Wait, wait.",
        "Olivia: I have to run.",
        "Cassie: All right, Lewis, out with it. Come on. I can handle the truth.",
        "Josh: What truth is that?",
        "Cassie: You're avoiding me. Not that I blame you. I practically begged you to help me find out about Jeffrey and Richard.",
        "Josh: Okay. Um, I'm sorry. I left that message on your voicemail. I was... I just needed a break from fixing things, that's all.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's fine, but I still miss having my friend and favorite brother-in- law to talk to.",
        "Josh: Have a seat.",
        "Cassie: So, I had a little visit from your old school friend, the intelligence agent.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Jeffrey wasn't too pleased about me talking to him. And he also wasn't too pleased when I started asking him questions about why his files had been shredded.",
        "Josh: Shredded?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. And there's more. Jeffrey admitted to me he fell in love with me before I even knew him while he was playing Richard.",
        "Josh: Wow.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know. It's pretty crazy, right? I don't even know how I feel about any of it.",
        "Josh: You want my advice?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Choose love.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry?",
        "Josh: After all this is done, after you learned everything there is to learn about Jeffrey, if you still love him, choose love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hello. Anyone here?",
        "Jonathan: I'll just wait here.",
        "Tammy: You didn't have to come. I mean, I know it's weird for you to be here at my mom's house.",
        "Jonathan: I can work on it if it will make you happy.",
        "Tammy: You make me happy. And I don't want you being anybody other than who you are.",
        "Jonathan: Okay.",
        "Tammy: I just wish that everyone else could see what I see. See why I love you so much. And we could all start over, you know.",
        "Jonathan: Your mom is never going to accept this, but it's a great dream, so count me in. And I'll try my best.",
        "RJ: Tammy? What you're doing is wrong!",
        "Lizzie: Buzz. Thank God. You have to help me. Coop is really--",
        "Gus: Home in bed sick. But don't worry, he'll survive. I'm not sure I will, though. It's so busy.",
        "Lizzie: I got him cough syrup, lozenges, stuff to watch-- I don't know, tell me what I forgot. Everything that Coop likes. Whatever there is that I can buy him to make him feel better. I hate to see him like this.",
        "Buzz: Oh, Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: I got him nasal spray, throat spray, special drops, special tea...",
        "Buzz: Lizzie! ( Sighs ) Take it easy. Save your time. Save your money, all right? He needs what everybody else needs when they're sick. He needs somebody to be with there him, to hold his hand, to keep him company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Hey!",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Ava: Surprise.",
        "Coop: Ava, hi.",
        "Ava: Hi, yourself. You look--",
        "Coop: Yeah, I know, I look awful. I feel awful.",
        "Ava: Right, awful. That's what I was going to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, what's up, R.J.?",
        "Tammy: Where's Mom?",
        "RJ: Out.",
        "Tammy: You're not here alone, are you? Where is Mrs. Chitwood?",
        "RJ: Downstairs doing the laundry.",
        "Jonathan: It's good to see you again, big man. Hey, your brother hates me.",
        "Tammy: He's a kid. He's confused.",
        "RJ: Hey, those are mine.",
        "Jonathan: Well these are some pretty cool blades, man.",
        "RJ: You know how?",
        "Jonathan: Me? Yeah. What? I'm like a grade \"A\" basher, man.",
        "RJ: No way.",
        "Jonathan: I got a good idea? How about we go out side and see what these bad boys can do?",
        "RJ: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Here we go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Choose love, huh? I wish it were that easy.",
        "Josh: Maybe it is this time.",
        "Cassie: I don't know. We'll see. But you, tell me about you. How are you?",
        "Josh: Oh, I'm just doing great. I'm really enjoying my new position as referee, now that Reva and Olivia are both working here at the same time.",
        "Cassie: How the hell did you let that happen?",
        "Josh: I haven't the faintest idea. It has been interesting.",
        "Cassie: Do you think Olivia should stay away until you and Reva decide one way or the other?",
        "Josh: Well, I actually thought that Reva and I had decided things one way or the other, so...",
        "Cassie: When have you had much time to think? You've been so busy taking care of me and my messed up life. I'm so sorry.",
        "Josh: No, don't be sorry, okay? Because I needed that. I needed to get away from my own life for a little while and get out of my own head because I was thinking far too much, which by the way, is what I think you're doing right now.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, that sounds familiar. My brain just keeps going. If I make this choice, if I make that choice, then what may or may not happen. Leave me with 1,001 possibilities. But I think I may have actually started to learn something.",
        "Josh: Really? Well please share.",
        "Cassie: Well, the other night my head was just full of 1,001 one questions about Jeffrey and Richard. And then Jeffrey put his arms around me and suddenly those questions didn't seem very important. All that mattered was just feeling him close to me. And then my brain started and it didn't last.",
        "Josh: But you did have that moment, right?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: Cassie, maybe that's the important thing, though. I mean maybe we need to live more in those moments. I think our instinct is to pull away, you know, out of fear or pride-- something like that. But does that really make our lives any better? I don't think it does. Like for instance right now, I know you have issues with Tammy and you have issues with Reva, but are you happier now? Are you better off without having them in your life? I don't think so. Am I better off being alone now because pretty much every relationship in my life has failed miserably. In fact, I can pretty much guess the odds are that my next relationship will also blow up in my face. But what does that really mean? Maybe life is about making choices and taking risks and going for it.",
        "Cassie: Choose love?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Um, I'll tell you what. I'm going to call off those hackers that I hired, tell them to move on to the next pressing conspiracy see.",
        "Cassie: It works for me.",
        "Josh: Great. Consider it done. No more questions. Case closed.",
        "Cassie: I feel better already.",
        "Josh: I'm glad.",
        "Cassie: All right, Lewis, you're not going to be a stranger, I'm going to see you soon?",
        "Josh: Yes, you will.",
        "Cassie: Okay. And, Josh, thank you for everything. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So you're really okay with Josh and Olivia?",
        "Billy: I wouldn't say okay, but, hey, look, you know, I believe you deserve something better than a weird triangle.",
        "Reva: If I wanted to, I could smash Olivia?",
        "Billy: I know you could smash Olivia. Reva Shayne doesn't plot and scheme and then pine away.",
        "Reva: You got that right.",
        "Billy: Yeah. If Reva Shayne wants something, she goes and gets it, doesn't? But you haven't.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Billy: No. You haven't walked right up to Josh and told him you want him back. Which leads me to believe that maybe you don't want to go there.",
        "Reva: Billy! You've been trying to push Josh and me together since the day he walked out the door. So what has changed now?",
        "Billy: I think falling off the wagon has given me a little perspective. I mean staying in the present isn't bad. And a day at a time is about as far into the future as I want to go.",
        "Reva: So just let it go, and let Joshua not find out exactly what Olivia did to you?",
        "Billy: Well, you've got to admit, blowing her out of the water right now would be lots of fun. And God knows she deserves it.",
        "Reva: Yeah, you bet she deserves it. There is a part of me that would love nothing more than to see her burn. But I don't know, I think I'm ready to look forward to the future, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Olivia, whoa. Hang on. I have to warn you about something. I don't want to see you hurt. And Billy and Reva are in there. They're cooking up something. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is, but it has to do with you and Billy's drinking.",
        "Olivia: They're going to bust me with Josh?",
        "Buzz: I don't know. Whatever it is, I don't want to see it happen.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, you've been friends with them a lot longer than I have, longer than you have with me. Why are you telling me this?",
        "Buzz: I think it's about time someone gave you a break.",
        "Olivia: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: So, what are your plans for the day?",
        "Billy: I was thinking about go over to the bar.",
        "Reva: Do you think it is such a good thing spending that much time there?",
        "Billy: What do you mean, the fox guarding the hen house, that kind of thing?",
        "Reva: Yeah, it kind of crossed my mind.",
        "Billy: Where else am I going to go?",
        "Reva: You can come to the office with me.",
        "Bill: I'm not wanted there.",
        "Reva: I want you.",
        "Billy: Don't talk like that unless you mean it, girl. ( Laughter ) Okay.",
        "Reva: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Josh...",
        "Josh: Yeah. Glad your back, I'm ready for that coffee now.",
        "Olivia: You know what? I completely forgot. I got the distracted, I'm sorry.",
        "Josh: That's okay, no problem. I got a lot of work done. In fact, I'm just finishing up on the counter-presentation right now.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I know. Listen...",
        "Josh: I thought maybe I'd run a couple of things by you.",
        "Olivia: No. Listen.",
        "Josh: Okay. What is it? What's wrong?",
        "Olivia: I can't work for you anymore. I'm resigning. And I think when I tell you why, you'll understand and you'll probably never want to see me again. The fact is this has been eating at me for a while, and it certainly has gotten in our way.",
        "Josh: In our way?",
        "Olivia: Since we've gotten closer, yeah. You remember our date, when I couldn't go back to your room with you?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Olivia: Well, it was because it's too soon, but I also knew I couldn't put what happened out of my mind. And I knew you wouldn't want me if...",
        "Josh: If what?",
        "Olivia: I could have stopped him. I could have stopped Billy from taking that drink, but I didn't. I let it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Okay, one soup, two burgers.",
        "Lizzie: Two?",
        "Buzz: Bacon cheddar for Coop and special for you. It was your grandfather's favorite. Grandfather, I'm sorry. I'm not putting all the dots together today. How you holding up?",
        "Lizzie: I'm... you know. Tell Harley that I'm sorry about Gus.",
        "Buzz: I will, hon. And listen, about Alan, we weren't exactly friends, but I know how much you loved him.",
        "Lizzie: Are there pickles in here and ketchup, too?",
        "Buzz: Hey, hey, hey. You know it's okay to be upset.",
        "Lizzie: Upset? I'm not so much. All of the men in my life leave me sooner or later. My father, my uncle, my grandfather. It's nothing new. Coop is the only guy who hasn't left me. And that is exactly why I will never leave him. He's everything to me now, everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: So what did you bring me?",
        "Ava: Nothing. It's food, actually. There's enough for you and Lizzie.",
        "Coop: Oh.",
        "Ava: Go on. Hey. Go take a shower; go on. I'll set this all up, and when you get out, you can cough and sneeze wipe your way through a delicious brunch. How does that sound?",
        "Coop: It sounds like I'll be on the road to recovery in no time, so. Oh um... Ava, thank you.",
        "Ava: What are friends for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You better not be stealing my afghan.",
        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Hi. I can't think of a nicer surprise to come home to.",
        "Tammy: I hope it's okay if I take some stuff out of my room.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you can take everything you need. You can take the afghan if you want it.",
        "Tammy: Really?",
        "Cassie: Or better yet, you could just move back home.",
        "Tammy: Mom, thanks, but I don't think we're really ready for that, do you?",
        "Cassie: Maybe not. But someone very wise just told me you've got to stop holding onto the things that don't make your life better. You've got to let go of things that weigh you down so you've got--",
        "RJ: Ow. Mommy. Ow.",
        "Cassie: Jonathan, my God, what did you do now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom Phelphrey inside \"The Light.\"",
        "Jonathan: Jonathan is the right guy for her. I think that Jonathan's kind of opening up her spectrum, showing her new things, and new ways to experience things. I think she's grounded enough, though, to be able to appreciate what he is showing her, but not lose herself. See Jonathan, Wednesday, February 8, inside \"The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Answer me, what happened?",
        "Jonathan: Well, that was some stunt, trying to do your first backwards crossover on a hill.",
        "RJ: I'm sorry.",
        "Jonathan: No, that's cool, dude.",
        "Cassie: The hell it is cool, dude. What if he broke something?",
        "Jonathan: RJ, do me a favor. Wiggle your fingers at the end of the arm. Perfect. Now do the other hand like that. Nice one. See nothing's broken except the flower pots at the end of your driveway. It's probably just a sprain.",
        "Cassie: What, you're a doctor now. Get out of my way.",
        "Tammy: Mom, calm down.",
        "Cassie: How could you take him out like this?",
        "Tammy: Don't blame Jonathan, I told him he could go, okay? It's my fault.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "RJ: I begged her to let me, Mom.",
        "Cassie: You're going to stay right here; you're going to take off these skates. I'm going to get bandages and some antibiotic cream. Do not move. Do you hear me. Nice work.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, we heard her.",
        "RJ: Oh, yeah. ( Laughter )",
        "Tammy: You don't get to do this, not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Hey in there! Sniffles, the food's ready! ( Water running ) Coop!",
        "Coop: Yeah, great. Look, we-- we have a problem here.",
        "Ava: What's wrong?",
        "Coop: My clothes are out there, so...",
        "Ava: Oh, well, I'll leave you alone and you can have some privacy.",
        "Coop: No, you don't have to leave me alone. You know just um... just don't look when I'm changing. Or if you want to step out, you can do that.",
        "Ava: Are you all right?",
        "Coop: Yeah, I'm a little dizzy.",
        "Ava: I think maybe-- you know what? You probably have the flu. I don't think that you really have a cold. Maybe we can put you over here?",
        "Coop: No, please I'm fine.",
        "Ava: On the--",
        "Coop: On the bed? ( Ava screams ) ( laughter )",
        "Coop: Are you okay?",
        "Lizzie: Hey, guess what? ( Ava gasps ) Hey, everyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I stood by and watched Billy take his first drink after-- in how many years?",
        "Josh: So you knew what was happening, but...",
        "Olivia: I didn't say anything. The whole truth? I wanted Bill to have that job in Venezuela, not Billy.",
        "Josh: And you figured if Billy got drunk, then Bill would have to take the job and that's exactly what happened.",
        "Olivia: But Bill found out that I let Billy take that drink and--",
        "Josh: And he left you. So you just stood there and watched.",
        "Olivia: I don't have any excuses. I don't understand why Billy gets to me. He just hated me for so long. He tried to have me deported.",
        "Josh: So he basically deserved what he got?",
        "Olivia: No! No. I am not proud of what I did. It was his life, his call, at least that's what I felt in the moment.",
        "Josh: What about now?",
        "Olivia: It doesn't matter what I feel. Forget it. You know, Billy knows we're involved, and he would rather see you with Reva. And you know something, he's probably right, Josh? You're better off if we're not involved.",
        "Josh: Why are you telling me this now.",
        "Olivia: Because we are involved, and the closer we've gotten, the more I realize I would have had to come clean with you and it would have just scared the hell out of me. At least no matter what happens, I know I did the right thing. I don't expect you to forgive me, okay. I just need to be able to live with myself. Say something, please, anything.",
        "Josh: 13 years, that's how long it had been since Billy had this last drink.",
        "Olivia: I am so sorry.",
        "Josh: Yeah, you both are. I know. You both made a terrible mistake.",
        "Olivia: I'm going to leave, and uh... but, look, if you want to talk to me or yell at me or throw something at me, I'll be down at Buzz's new place on Main Street, okay. I'm sorry. God!",
        "Josh: I heard you.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Olivia.",
        "Olivia: What is it, \"D\" day?",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Olivia: Sorry, but I think I stole your thunder.",
        "Billy: See, this would be fun if we knew what you were talking about. ( Laughter )",
        "Olivia: I am so tired of both of you. You have no power over me anymore.",
        "Reva: That was interesting.",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Hi.",
        "Billy: Hi.",
        "Josh: Great, just the two people I needed to see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Just being around Jonathan, you stop thinking clearly. You are not being you.",
        "Tammy: You're wrong. I am being me. More than I ever have in my life. Mom, he's good to me.",
        "Cassie: Oh, please. Ever since Jonathan has come to this town, all he has done is tear our lives apart. If you don't have the sense to steer clear, the least you can do is keep your brother away from him. My God, what is the matter with you?",
        "Tammy: With me? You married Edmund. If anyone here brought home a psychopath, it's you. He almost killed RJ and Jeffrey in that fire, okay. So if anyone put RJ in danger and all of us in danger, it's not Jonathan. It's you, Mom. ( Gasps )",
        "Cassie: Tammy, I'm sorry.",
        "Tammy: Don't touch me.",
        "Cassie: Honey...",
        "Tammy: Don't! Just don't say anything I'll get my things and get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Hey. Uh... Lizzie, gee, this is not what it looks like. I know it looks bad.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, relax. It's okay. It's all perfectly innocent, I know that. You just stopped by to check on him, right? You're a good friend, Ava, but since I'm here now and poor Buzz is all alone...",
        "Ava: Buzz.",
        "Lizzie: .... Working.",
        "Ava: Buzz. Oh, my gosh, I've got to go. I completely forgot.",
        "Lizzie: I will walk you out. You back under the covers and I will be right back.",
        "Ava: Feel better. Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: You are pathetic, you know that? The way you keep throwing yourself.",
        "Ava: I was just trying to help him.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, I saw you just trying-- trying to help yourself to my boyfriend, you slut.",
        "Ava: Slut? I'm the one who found you sticking your tongue down some other guy's throat and you're calling me a slut?",
        "Lizzie: I already explained that stupid kiss with Quinn. That doesn't excuse the way you hang on Coop. Why don't you say it, Ava, you want my boyfriend?",
        "Ava: All right, you know what? I do. And is there anything wrong with that? He's a great guy. He's everything I could ever hope for. And I'm really good for him, too.",
        "Lizzie: You can't compete. I'm in his heart and his bed. And as long as I am, you don't stand a chance.",
        "Ava: I have been around over- privileged people like you my entire life. You've been handed everything since day one. You're not built for the long haul.",
        "Lizzie: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Ava: That means I don't have to try to steal Coop away from you. I'm just going to sit back and watch you do it all yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You managed to side-step that massacre at Lewis.",
        "Olivia: Well we'll see. I was able to give it a shot, thanks to you.",
        "Buzz: I'm glad I could help.",
        "Olivia: I'm glad I was able to explain myself. Who knows what's going to happen. Josh listened, but didn't exactly block the door when I was leaving.",
        "Buzz: And here you are?",
        "Olivia: And I think this is where I'm going to stay, alone and stuck out in the cold.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So you two are coming here to what, nail Olivia, is that it?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: I'm not sure I believe that.",
        "Reva: Well, what did she tell you?",
        "Josh: Well, why don't we start with what you know. Billy, what happened?",
        "Billy: I wasn't going to tell you anything.",
        "Josh: You weren't going to tell me about the night you fell off the wagon?",
        "Billy: You really want to do this?",
        "Josh: Yes, I do.",
        "Reva: He was pushed, Joshua, by Olivia.",
        "Josh: Oh.",
        "Reva: It's the truth.",
        "Josh: No, the truth is Billy is responsible for his own actions.",
        "Reva: She switched those glasses and she did it deliberately.",
        "Billy: This doesn't make any difference. It's all a lie.",
        "Reva: No, it's not, Billy. She's here in this company. She's in this family. She's using the name Lewis.",
        "Josh: Did Olivia pore that drink down your throat, Billy? And after that drink, did she buy the next one and the next one and the next one? Did she lock you up some place so you couldn't go to your AA meetings or call your sponsor?",
        "Billy: Josh, I know absolutely everything that I did and I take full responsibility for it. But I will tell you one thing: I would still be drinking if it weren't for Reva.",
        "Reva: This isn't about you, Billy.",
        "Josh: Yes it is actually. It's about Billy and the choices he made. It's not about Olivia, it's not about you, it's not about me, Reva.",
        "Reva: Joshua.",
        "Josh: It's about our lives. You make your choices; I make mine. And that's the way it is supposed to be.",
        "Reva: No, now look...",
        "Josh: One more thing: I am through explaining my choices to you, Reva. That part of my life is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Believe it or not, I don't think you're a bad person, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Thanks.",
        "Cassie: But I do think you are troubled. And whether you mean for it to happen or not, people get hurt in all kinds of ways when you're around. And I know you've been hurt, too, but I cannot change that.",
        "Jonathan: Look, I have stuff, like everybody does. I would do anything-- everything to make your daughter happy.",
        "Cassie: If you truly love her, you will back away. You will give her the opportunity to have a safe, happy life--",
        "Tammy: Ready. Is everything okay? No, probably not. What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Whoa there bruiser. You break it, you buy it.",
        "Ava: Do me a favor, okay?",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Ava: Only put me on the schedule when Coop isn't working.",
        "Buzz: I thought you two made a good team.",
        "Ava: Apparently we do. Too good of a team. That's what Lizzie thinks. I went over there to check on Coop and Lizzie walked in, and it wasn't good.",
        "Buzz: Okay, I'll do what I can to reschedule.",
        "Ava: You no what? Don't. I swore to myself that I would never let anyone mess with my head again. Leave everything the same. I can handle Lizzie.",
        "Buzz: A little warning: She can play pretty dirty. She was trained by the worst. She is a Spaulding.",
        "Ava: And I'm me. Let her try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Lay back. Leave it all to me. I'm going to make sure you are so comfortable you don't remember how lousy you feel.",
        "Coop: Who are you calling?",
        "Lizzie: Netty, the maid at the house. She used to take care of me. I'll get her to come over.",
        "Coop: No. Give me the phone.",
        "Lizzie: Well, hey! Lay back down!",
        "Coop: Give me the phone. Bye, Netty. I don't want Netty, Lizzie. I want you, okay?",
        "Lizzie: But I can't--",
        "Coop: You can't what? Lizzie, look, you make me feel better. You can, you do, and I know that you will.",
        "Lizzie: What if I can't, Coop? You know me, I screw everything up.",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: I think about losing you and I can't stand it.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you're not going to lose me, okay? It's just the flu.",
        "Lizzie: Please promise me.",
        "Coop: ( Coughing ) Lizzie, I-- yes, I promise. I promise you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Are you okay?",
        "Reva: I'm not sure. What just happened?",
        "Billy: I think about the best thing that could have happened. You know where you stand.",
        "Reva: Which is where?",
        "Billy: Right here with me. Here.",
        "Reva: You always know the right thing to say.",
        "Billy: I wish I really did.",
        "Reva: Oh, look at me. Look at me. I tried so hard to do the right thing, I tried not to be petty or vindictive, and it just doesn't matter. What have I accomplished in this past year?",
        "Billy: Well you've accomplished a lot.",
        "Reva: No! No, no, no. I destroyed my marriage, I lost a job that I was really good at and I alienated my sister.",
        "Billy: And you saved my butt?",
        "Reva: Yeah, well you're not saved yet.",
        "Billy: That's why you're still here.",
        "Reva: Exactly. Because I want to be here, Billy-- with you. Because I'm going to pull you back up on your feet; you're going to come back to this company. You're going to come back to this world and together we're going to show them all how it's done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Josh: Hi.",
        "Olivia: Does your being here mean what I think and you-- um, forgive me.",
        "Josh: Olivia, what you did was inexcusable, and you're going to have to figure out a way to live with that. But I've come to a decision. As of today, I am no longer in the business of judging others. We're all flawed because we're all human. Now, Billy, when he first took a sip of that drink, he knew exactly what was in it. And he could have made a decision and he could have stopped it right then and there, but he didn't do that. So it makes it a little hard for me to point fingers at somebody else if that's what I wanted to do, which I don't. We all live our own lives and we all make our own choices, and mine is to move on.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "Josh: Don't thank me. It's the way it's supposed to be. I think you owe me a cup of coffee.",
        "Olivia: I can do better.",
        "Josh: Really?",
        "Olivia: I can buy you breakfast, too.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I'll take this stuff out to the car for you and just wait outside.",
        "Tammy: I'll be there in a minute.",
        "Jonathan: Cassie, I'm sorry about RJ.",
        "Cassie: And I'm sorry, too, honey. I don't know how that happened. It just happened before I even knew it.",
        "Tammy: Mom, stop. It's okay. I'm not angry. Actually, I think you slapped some sense into me.",
        "Cassie: I'm not sure I know what you mean.",
        "RJ: Mommy?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Honey, I'm right here. How are you?",
        "RJ: Is Jonathan gone? Will he be coming back?",
        "Cassie: Not today, RJ.",
        "Tammy: Actually, I'm going to go, too?",
        "RJ: But you'll be back soon?",
        "Tammy: You'll see us soon, okay? That's a promise. Get better.",
        "RJ: I will. Bye.",
        "Tammy: Bye Mom.",
        "Cassie: Good-bye, honey, I love you. And I'm-- ( door shuts )",
        "Jonathan: Come here. I'm sorry.",
        "Tammy: Why? It's not your fault; it's mine. I was wrong.",
        "Jonathan: About what?",
        "Tammy: About thinking that the only way we could move on is if I put things back together with my mom, first. I'm through putting my life on hold, our life.",
        "Jonathan: You sure about that?",
        "Tammy: I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life. I'm yours. All yours.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Sandy: Now you plan on buying Tammy's happiness?",
        "Jonathan: Tonight's my night and Tammy's night-- not going anywhere with you.",
        "Sandy: What are you worried about? I'm just a figment of your warped imagination.",
        "Tammy: You know, I wish loving him didn't hurt so much. That's what true love is, Mom. This kind of pain.",
        "Jonathan: I don't know who you think you are--",
        "Man: Me? I'm the man Tammy's going to marry."
