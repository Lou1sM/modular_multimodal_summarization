        "Marina's been trapped by a cave-in and her calls for help which goes unheard by the men who are traveling in another part of the tunnel. They decide to leave the tunnels because of the impending danger. Marina's fate seems bleak as she struggles to breathe under the weight of the beam that pins her chest, but just as she blacks out, Michelle and Marah save her. Marina insists there's been one too many accidents and asks Carrie to come forward and show herself at last. Meanwhile the men emerge from the tunnels and argue about what to do next. Josh proposes that instead of looking for this mystery person, the men should lure the person to them. Cassie finishes a call when a strung out young man visits her. Cassie quickly deduces that he is looking for drugs as the man goes crazy and attacks her. She holds her own until Edmund arrives in time to provide some much needed backup. Harley's on her way to meet Brad but winds up face to face with Brad's wife (Marie) instead who demands to know why Harley's been calling her husband. While Harley quickly explains that she's trying to smooth the waters between Brad and Gus, Gus arrives. Gus backs up Harley's story in front of Marie but once alone, argues with her over her interference. She's unable to tell him what she was really doing and because of that her own anger and frustration boils over. Finally they realize that they don't have the energy to fight all the time and Gus proposes a solution: they should dance instead."

        "Cassie: Yes, I know. But I'm sure if it was your dad setting up the rules and not your step-dad, then it would be okay, right? Yeah. Well, you know what? Just think about it. Just think about it and call me back. Okay. All right. Mm-hmm. Bye. Hi. Can I help you?",
        "Kid: This is it? This is the place where you can help me?",
        "Cassie: I hope so. Why don't you come on in? I'm cassie. You don't have to tell me your name if you don't want to.",
        "Kid: It's just you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, just me. Very small operation. And I hope that I can help. And if I can't, I'm sure I can find someone who can. So why don't you... why don't you put that down and we'll talk?",
        "Kid: Talk? I don't think so.",
        "Gus: What's all that?",
        "Alan: Your transcript from the board meeting.",
        "Gus: Oh, right. Right. That olivia's a piece of work, huh?",
        "Alan: Yeah.",
        "Gus: Showing up with phillip's proxy like that?",
        "Alan: Yes, I'm afraid she's thrown down the gauntlet, so it's going to be war from here on out, and it's not going to be fun. So anyone who doesn't have to be there shouldn'T.",
        "Gus: You mean like me?",
        "Alan: Gus, you know, you have done a bang-up job at spaulding in the past few months. You know how much it's meant to me to have you there. I just don't want you to get caught in the crossfire; that's all.",
        "Gus: I can't believe it. You're trying to get rid of me.",
        "Harley: Oh, god. Great. So much for being fashionably late.",
        "Marie: Back alleys are hell on high heels, aren't they?",
        "Harley: Mrs. Green.",
        "Marie: Oh, call me marie. After all we've been sharing lately, I believe we should be on a first-name basis by now.",
        "Harley: Okay, marie.",
        "Marie: Bradley sends his regrets... or he would have, if he had gotten the message that i erased.",
        "Harley: What are you doing listening to your husband's messages?",
        "Marie: Well, you see, fidelity is a brand-new concept for bradley. And there are some women in his life who desperately need to get that message.",
        "Harley: You are completely off base about your husband and me.",
        "Marie: Really? Then why are you calling his private line, inviting him to a hotel, wearing a dress that looks like you charge by the hour?",
        "Harley: There's a perfectly good explanation. Why don't we go inside and I'll tell you about it?",
        "Marie: No. I'm not going anywhere. And neither are you.",
        "Billy: Whoa! What was that?",
        "Josh: One of the offshoot tunnels must have collapsed.",
        "Buzz: Let's get out of here!",
        "Marina: ( Coughing) (groans) (coughing) help! Help! Somebody? Somebody help! Help!",
        "Buzz: Did you hear something?",
        "Billy: No, that was just an echo. Come on, let's get out of here before the whole thing collapses.",
        "Marina: Help me! Please! Help! Help me! Help!",
        "Marina: Help! Help, somebody! Somebody, please! (Coughing) way to go, marina. Only you can't get from point a to point b without the sky trying to falling in on you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just got to get a grip. You got to get a grip and you got to focus here. You got to focus here. You can get out of here. You have to get out of here. This isn't as bad as it looks. It's worse.",
        "Michelle: Where is marina? Are you sure that you called her?",
        "Carrie: Yes, I called all three of you. Don't worry. She should be here any moment. Oh, marah, did you ever solve the mystery of your little doll, or she still stalking you?",
        "Marah: No, it seems that shayne was playing games with my head.",
        "Carrie: Well, I accept your apology.",
        "Marah: But the weird thing is that shayne swears that he never put the doll in my sewing box with the razor blade.",
        "Carrie: Well, that's the trouble with those little childhood games: They often get quite out of hand, don't they?",
        "Michelle: Okay, I've tried marina's cell, and she's not answering. Did you call her before or after you called me?",
        "Carrie: Well, you know, I... I really just don't remember.",
        "Marie: I've seen every trick in the book: Women who try to be your friend, they're nice to your children, join the same clubs, buy opera tickets... or maybe you're just the curious type. I mean, after all, with my husband's reputation, maybe you're just hot to see what all the fuss was about.",
        "Harley: My interest in your husband has nothing to do with romance.",
        "Marie: But you admit there's an interest?",
        "Harley: Yes, I do. There is. Now, why don't we go inside? I'll buy you a drink and I will tell you about it.",
        "Marie: What's the matter, harley? You're afraid to be alone with me?",
        "Harley: I'm not afraid of much, marie, and certainly not you. I just think there are better places for two grown women to discuss their business than an alley.",
        "Marie: The only thing we have to discuss is what business you want with my husband.",
        "Harley: Yes, and I will make that crystal clear with a drink in my hand.",
        "Marie: Maybe you could also clarify what you meant when you said when he met you, you would make it worth his while.",
        "Alan: What do you mean, \"get rid\" of you? I'm just trying to protect you. That's all.",
        "Gus: Protect me? What are you trying to protect me from? I'm not scared of olivia.",
        "Alan: Look, I have a feeling that olivia is going to be stirring up a lot of ugly things, and I...",
        "Gus: Fine, which is why I'm going to stay by your side while you take her down, okay? I'm doing this for you. I'm doing this for my brother. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Alan: Of course you're not going anywhere. You're my son; you're part of this family. You will always be a part of the company.",
        "Gus: But not an active part?",
        "Alan: Gus, I remember just a short time ago, you telling me that your greatest passion and love was your detective work, your police work. Now, I don't want to take you away from the thing you love and put you right in the middle of a war.",
        "Gus: Well, maybe the problem isn't me in the middle of a war. Maybe the problem would be me being taken out of the loop.",
        "Gus: Are you kidding me? Ever since you came onboard, i have welcomed you, given you full access to everything.",
        "Gus: Sure, I know... until today, right? Till the board meeting. Why? Because I mentioned pharmaceuticals or because i mentioned the drug antimonious, or the russian fax, or the lawsom bakage report, which is through the roof, by the way? I mean, what? Now all of a sudden the wall goes up and I get my walking papers-- nice.",
        "Alan: Every question you've asked, which were quite a few, were answered. There were no walls. But I will give you a little advice: In the future, the boardroom is a not a place for 20 questions.",
        "Gus: Really? Then how about right now? Right here? There is something that you are not telling me. I am your son. You can tell me anything. I am on your side. You can trust me.",
        "Alan: Always the cop first, aren't you?",
        "Gus: If you are in trouble, i can help you.",
        "Alan: What, are you still worried about that damn drug; is that it? I told you it wasn't important. Thank you for bringing it to our attention. We'll look into it. Now, why can't you let it go?",
        "Gus: Because something... there is something that's eating at you. It's bugging you. Just tell me what it is. Is it the brad green thing?",
        "Alan: Forget about brad green. I don't like brad green. But brad green is very good at what he does. Let me tell you something. Everything in life, son, is not a mystery for you to solve. So drop it. Do you understand me? Drop it now.",
        "Cassie: Is this about money? Because I have money.",
        "Kid: Where is it?",
        "Cassie: If you want money, i have it.",
        "Kid: Where is it?",
        "Cassie: In my wallet, in my purse, and it's right there.",
        "Kid: You think I want your money? There. What do you keep in there? What do you keep in there?",
        "Cassie: Supplies.",
        "Kid: Open it.",
        "Cassie: I don't know why you want...",
        "Kid: Open it.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Kid: That's it? That's all you got? What kind of place is this?",
        "Cassie: You're on drugs. This is a help line. It's not the clinic. You have the wrong place.",
        "Kid: You are lying. I know you got a stash. Give it to me!",
        "Kid: How did you...",
        "Cassie: I don't want to hurt you, okay? And I know that you don't want to hurt me. So why don't we just start this over? I have a daughter your age. I know your parents must be worried sick about you, so why don't you tell me their names so I can call them? Oh!",
        "Kid: Sorry. Can't let you do that.",
        "Alan: Well, I think you know I've been going through a lot lately-- elizabeth, phillip's problems, and now olivia. So I guess I reached the end of my rope. And you kept hitting me hard with the pharmaceutical thing, and I guess I just snapped.",
        "Gus: Maybe I hit a little too close to home?",
        "Alan: No, you hit a non- issue. You know, in business, you have to choose your battles carefully, gus.",
        "Gus: I think you have to do that in life as well, right? Why don't you just talk to me, here? Why don't you just tell me... just tell me what's really going on?",
        "Alan: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Gus: Are you sure?",
        "Alan: Absolutely sure.",
        "Buzz: Missed you. Hey, gus.",
        "Alan: Well, you've got a bit of reading to do at home tonight. So you'd better take this home and get started.",
        "Gus: Okay. That's a pretty good plan.",
        "Alan: Yeah, yeah. I'll see you at the office a little later on.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Alan: Well?",
        "Buzz: It's a bust.",
        "Billy: Kind of missed you down there. I'd liked to have seen you been down there and getting yourself a little down and dirty.",
        "Alan: No sign of anyone?",
        "Billy: No. And the place almost caved in on us.",
        "Josh: That's it. We're not going to waste any more time crawling around in tunnels.",
        "Billy: Okay. Well, you got a plan b, josh?",
        "Josh: This psycho has been pulling our strings, right? He's been going after us through our girls. We've been reacting to what he's been doing. We've been playing defensively.",
        "Buzz: We are on the defensive.",
        "Josh: Well, that's got to stop. It's got to stop right now. We have got to take control of the situation before anything else happens. We've got to draw this guy out. Now, we know what he's after, right?",
        "Buzz: Yeah, yeah, he's after us.",
        "Josh: No. If he were after just us, he would have come after just us, but he didn'T. He went after our girls, too. And now we've got to go for him.",
        "Harley: You are absolutely right, marie. I did promise to make our meeting worth your husband's while. And it was not the first time.",
        "Marie: Oh, you are a piece of work.",
        "Harley: No, the first time i made it worth his while was when I had the charges against you dropped. Remember those charges? Extortion, conspiracy to frame your husband for murder. So why don't you drop the injured wife act and show some gratitude that you're not doing five to ten right now?",
        "Marie: My gratitude does not include letting you hit on my husband.",
        "Harley: My interest in your husband is strictly business.",
        "Marie: What business?",
        "Harley: Okay, fine. You want to talk about this? It concerns my fiance. I don't like discussing gus behind his back, but so be it. You know, they are working together at spaulding and they are butting heads. And I thought I could talk to brad and get him to go a little easier on gus.",
        "Marie: How would that make it worth his while?",
        "Harley: Well, gus's V.P. Position? That's nepotism, pure nepotism. I know it, gus knows it, and brad knows it. I thought I could talk to them, I could get them to play nice. That way gus has a easier time of it, brad can score some points with alan, and everybody wins.",
        "Marie: So you expect me to believe that you're meeting my husband dressed like that to get him to go easier on your fiance?",
        "Harley: No. I am meeting my fiance. I'm going to be playing nice with him. Your husband was just my first stop.",
        "Marie: You're so good, harley. I'm almost convinced. But, you see, I've been worked over before.",
        "Harley: Yes, I know you have, marie. I know you have. And I know that the wounds from brad's infidelities are still fresh, but you can't live like this. You cannot think that every woman who's phoning your husband is trying to mix business with pleasure.",
        "Marie: You weren't in europe.",
        "Harley: Why? What happened in europe?",
        "Marie: That's in the past. I'm worried about the present.",
        "Harley: I already told you...",
        "Marie: I know what you told me. Oh, there's your fiance. Let's see if he backs up your story.",
        "Marina: ( Coughs) okay. Okay, you're sitting up. Sitting up is better than lying down. (Groans) okay. Okay. There's no need to panic. I don't need to panic, but there's no need to give in... ( coughing) ...to the panic. You've been in worse situations than this before. You're not afraid of the dark. You're not afraid of anything. (Crying) I've got to get out of here. Buried alive... Oprah's",
        "Marina: I can't sleep. You have to stay awake. You have to stay awake. Help! Help! Help, somebody! Someone will find me. Someone will find me. Someone will miss me. Wait a minute. Nobody knows I'm here. How can someone miss me if nobody knows that I'm here? Except carrie. (Grunts) she probably wanted it to be this way. No. No! You messed with the wrong girl, carrie! And I am getting out of here, and I am coming to get you. No. No. No, come on, don't die. Don't die. Don't die.",
        "Cassie: All right, I called the paramedics.",
        "Edmund: What about the police?",
        "Cassie: I'm not calling the police. This guy is barely tammy's age. He needs help or he wouldn't have come in here.",
        "Edmund: Down. Get down. Down, down. Party's over. Take a nap.",
        "Cassie: He keeps doing that. You know, he's like spaced out. All of a sudden he pops up again. He's up and he's down. He's up and he's down. Look, help is on the way. But you've got to tell us what you're on. Is it x? Is it pcp?",
        "Kid: D, baby, the big D.",
        "Edmund: D? What's d?",
        "Cassie: It's delirium. Michelle was telling me about it. It's something new on the streets.",
        "Edmund: D. What is it? What does it do to you?",
        "Kid: I'm flying. Watch me. I'm going up. Up...",
        "Cassie: Look, man, as high as you go up, that's as far as you're going to go down.",
        "Gus: Do you want to run this by me one more time, ladies? What? What's the deal here? You were trying to call her husband, but she got you instead? Is that... you're trying to call brad green?",
        "Harley: It's not that big a deal.",
        "Marie: Harley said that you're having trouble with brad at the office and she believes that, because of her previous association with him, that she can help you there. Look, I don't really care whether you're getting along with brad or not at the office. I just want to know that she's playing peacemaker with him and nothing else.",
        "Gus: Well, mrs. Green, it's not a secret that brad and i don't really... there's no love lost there, if you know what I mean. We proved that today in the boardroom. But harley being harley, you know, she wants to fix... no, I take that back. She needs... she needs to fix things like that, on behalf of... I don't need you to fight my battles for me, okay? Please. We talked about this. It'S... you know, it's a guy thing, okay?",
        "Harley: See?",
        "Gus: So, is that what you needed to hear, marie? Now maybe you'll rethink it? Maybe you owe her an apology before you leave.",
        "Marie: Don't hold your breath.",
        "Harley: Thanks for the save. And she called me a piece of work. Honey, I can explain everything.",
        "Gus: What are you doing?",
        "Harley: Everything...",
        "Gus: What are you doing? I can handle brad green, okay? I don't need your help. I don't need your help with this situation... with my situation.",
        "Harley: What? I'm not supposed to protect the man I love? I'm not supposed to watch your back?",
        "Gus: You're not supposed to go behind it.",
        "Michelle/marah: Marina! Marina! Marina! Marina!",
        "Marina: Help!",
        "Michelle: Hang on. We're going to come... marina, just hang on.",
        "Marah: Hold on.",
        "Michelle: We'll get you.",
        "Marah: We're coming.",
        "Michelle: We'll get you out. Careful. Marina, just hold still. We're going to get you out, okay? Don't move. Marah, quick.",
        "Marah: I'M...",
        "Michelle: We've got to pull this off.",
        "Marah: Here.",
        "Marina: Help!",
        "Marah: Pull yourself out.",
        "Michelle: Get ready. Drop it. Drop it.",
        "Michelle: Are you okay?",
        "Marina: Thank you guys so much. I've never been so happy to see you before.",
        "Michelle: First thing first. You've got a cut on your forehead. How about your head? Is your head all right?",
        "Marina: No, the first thing is getting that bitch.",
        "Michelle: Who?",
        "Marina: Carrie.",
        "Michelle: Who are you talking about?",
        "Michelle: No, marina. No, she didn'T.",
        "Marina: No, no. She did. She did.",
        "Michelle: Hold still. Calm down. Relax.",
        "Marina: She sent me into the tunnel. First, it was you with the gas, and then it was marah with the razor blade, and then me.",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Michelle: No, this was an accident, marina.",
        "Marina: No! There have been too many accidents.",
        "Marah: We were with her the whole time.",
        "Michelle: We were with carrie.",
        "Marina: No, you guys can go on believing whatever you want, but I am going to her place and I'm going to get that bitch for everything that she's done to us.",
        "Michelle: Marina, you have to be careful. We've got to get you to the hospital. Come on.",
        "Harley: Hey, it's not like you haven't come to my rescue a million times without me asking...",
        "Gus: Because you are in danger if I do that. What kind of danger do you think I'm in? Huh? This is a corporation. What am I going to get, a paper cut?",
        "Harley: Sweetie, if you think that, then you're in bigger trouble than I thought.",
        "Gus: Is there something that you're not telling me? Please!",
        "Harley: No. Of course not. But this is not... honey, this is not the corner grocery store. This is a cutthroat corporation. This is spaulding, okay?",
        "Gus: I understand. I am a detective. Don't you think I have dealt with worse things than this?",
        "Harley: See, this is when you get into the most trouble: When you think you've got everything covered. Spaulding makes their own rules, okay? You can't walk in flashing your badge, thinking that you know everything like you do down at the station, okay?",
        "Gus: I'll keep that in mind next time I'm going into the boardroom, okay?",
        "Harley: Good. Maybe you should. Because sometimes things take just a little bit of a softer touch.",
        "Gus: All right. Well, exactly how soft were you willing to go, honey?",
        "Harley: I am going to pretend that you did not just say that to me.",
        "Gus: I don't need you talking to brad green. If there's a bully in the playground, okay, you don't call out the headmaster to help you reason with the guy. No, you stand up to him on his turf. That's what you do. You did not help me today. In fact, you undermined my work.",
        "Harley: That wasn't my intention.",
        "Gus: Well...",
        "Harley: I love you. I love you, and I will do whatever I have to do to protect you, okay? And I will not apologize for that.",
        "Gus: All right, marie. You sound like marie green. That's what you sound like to me.",
        "Harley: Well, we both saw what happened to brad green when he pissed her off. Maybe you should watch out.",
        "Gus: This is really nice, you know? Now we're fighting in a public place. This is good. We're turning into the greens. Is that what you want?",
        "Harley: I can't keep doing this. I can'T.",
        "Gus: Excuse me? What did you say?",
        "Harley: We're not the greens, okay? Tell me that we're not the greens.",
        "Gus: We're not the greens.",
        "Harley: What are you doing? Honey?",
        "Gus: Yes?",
        "Harley: What are you doing?",
        "Gus: We're not the greens. The greens wouldn't just start dancing in public.",
        "Harley: I don't hear any music.",
        "Gus: We make the music, okay?",
        "Harley: Dance floor?",
        "Gus: Wherever we are.",
        "Harley: People are still staring.",
        "Gus: I don't care because i only see you.",
        "Josh: The longer this guy's out there, the closer he's getting to our girls.",
        "Billy: Yeah, but the girls trust him. And the one person that they shouldn't trust, and they trust him.",
        "Alan: We've got to make a move and force him out.",
        "Buzz: Oh, really? What do you have in mind, a billboard? Perhaps a personal ad? \"Five men seeking witness. You saw us; we didn't see you almost 30 years ago at cutter's bridge. We'd love to meet for a conversation, maybe more.\"",
        "Billy: No, come on. Now wait a minute. We don't where he lives, but we know where he's been. So we leave notes. We leave them at the bridge, we leave them in the tunnels, and we leave them at the graveyard.",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on, he's waited this long. He's just going to wait us out.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but the reason's he's been able to wait us out is because he's had access to the girl. If we cut off that access, he's going to have to come after us directly, right?",
        "Alan: He's counting us to be passive. Look, the girls are following his plan to the letter. But once he can't get to them, it's a different ball game. And that's when I think he's going to slip up.",
        "Buzz: (Laughs) oh, that's a terrific idea. Provoke him.",
        "Billy: How are going to keep the girls from him? He's got a kind of a svengali grip on them right now.",
        "Alan: He's already doing something, billy! You want us not to act and then him do something worse?",
        "Josh: Look, look, we have two agendas here, right? We've got to get the girl... we've got to draw the girls away from this guy, and we have to contact him. Now the thing with the girls may take a while, but we've got to contact this guy immediately. We have to do it now. We have to figure out what we're going to do, what we're going to say. What's up with ed?",
        "Billy: That ship has sailed.",
        "Josh: Well, we can't just leave him out there on his own. That's not going to be good for him; it's not going to be good for us. We have got to stick together and watch each other's back.",
        "Billy: Wait, wait, wait. Ed is incapable of watching anybody's back. I'm telling you.",
        "Josh: Well, then we're going to have to watch his. This thing is only going to get harder from here on in, guys. We don't know what's coming, but we know we're stronger together. So no more arguments, no more playing cowboys. Every move we make from here on in counts. Our girls' lives are at stake, and we are running out of time.",
        "Michelle: Be careful.",
        "Carrie: Marina! Oh, my god! Quick, put her down. Put her down quickly. Put your feet up. Hurry, hurry. Oh, marina. Well, I think you're going to need a stitch. Tell us. Tell us what happened.",
        "Marina: I was on the wrong side of a cave-in.",
        "Carrie: Oh, my god. How terrible. You must have been so frightened. Oh, we've been worried sick about you. Let me get you some brandy. What happened?",
        "Marina: Cut the act, carrie. You know exactly how it happened.",
        "Carrie: Well, I don't understand. I've been through all of those tunnels since I was a child, and nothing ever happened to me. Was there something... something odd? Something unusual?",
        "Marina: Yeah, yeah, I was going through a tunnel I'd never seen before because you sent me there. That was pretty unusual.",
        "Carrie: Well, there was... was there some movement? Well, did you hear anything?",
        "Marina: Voices.",
        "Carrie: Voices? Voices? Well, did you recognize any of them?",
        "Marina: I think maybe it was my grandfather and josh and billy.",
        "Carrie: Do you suppose that they followed you here?",
        "Marina: I don't know, but you sure could have.",
        "Carrie: Well, no. No, I've been here the whole time.",
        "Marina: Well, you could have set the whole thing up before. It's four for the price of one. It's pretty convenient, if you ask me.",
        "Carrie: I think you must be suffering from shock, my dear.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not being clear. I'm saying that you caused the cave-in. I'm saying that you wanted all of us dead.",
        "Paramedic: He's all strapped in and ready to roll.",
        "Cassie: Oh, okay. Is he going to be okay?",
        "Paramedic: After detox, he'll feel like hell, but he'll survive.",
        "Cassie: Good. Maybe he won't do it again.",
        "Paramedic: Don't count on it.",
        "Cassie: Really? Does this happen a lot? Kids this young?",
        "Paramedic: It was quiet for a while after street cleanup. But now that the d's on the scene, I think we're going to see more.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: I'm okay. I'm okay.",
        "Edmund: You shouldn't have been down here on your own.",
        "Cassie: I don't even think he knew what he was doing, edmund.",
        "Edmund: I don't think he cared. He was high.",
        "Cassie: Something has to be done. You know, something has to be done. The kids in this town... what about tammy?",
        "Edmund: Tammy's not going to get involved in anything like this.",
        "Cassie: I know, but... do I? Do I know? How many mothers think they know? And you know what? That's not the point, because someone's kid is already in danger. The parents have to find out about this. The people in this town have to know that this is on the street.",
        "Edmund: You've got that norma rae gleam in your eye. This is going to become a cause, isn't it?",
        "Cassie: You're damn right it is. (Sirens)",
        "Harley: What are you humming?",
        "Gus: Just dancing. No talking, okay?",
        "Harley: You're afraid that if we talk, we'll fight?",
        "Gus: There's always that possibility.",
        "Harley: I remember what you're humming.",
        "Gus: That's my girl.",
        "Harley: Let's go home. (Cell phones ring)",
        "Harley: Cooper. I can't do that right now.",
        "Gus: What's up? No, because I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Harley: It's not going to happen.",
        "Gus: That's not... when?",
        "Harley: Okay, fine. Bye.",
        "Gus: All right, I'm on my way.",
        "Harley: I'm at olivia's bar.",
        "Gus: Appreciate it.",
        "Harley: I'll wait.",
        "Harley: Business.",
        "Gus: Business. We'll pick this up... we'll pick this up later.",
        "Harley: I'll save my last dance for you. Gus, thank you. My shoe. Tammy, it's harley. Would you do me a favor? Would you bring me down a pair of your mother's shoes?",
        "Carrie: And you mean to say that you think I caused this cave-in? With a little pick and shovel? If I had wanted to do harm to your fathers, I could have done it all those years ago when they left maryanne to die in the river.",
        "Marina: Well, maybe you just wanted to torture them. You used us to make them suffer. And now you've had your fun and it's sayonara to the rest of us.",
        "Carrie: I think you really do need to go to a hospital.",
        "Marina: I have never been clearer since the day that you came into our lives. Hey, we've all had accidents in like the last week. Do you really expect us to believe that that's just a coincidence? And I was the one... I tried to explain it away. I tried to push it aside because I didn't think that someone that you trusted with your secret wishes would betray you. But you did.",
        "Carrie: I can't believe that...",
        "Marina: You gained our trust, you drove a wedge between us and our fathers, and the whole time you were just waiting. You were waiting for the perfect moment to hurt us. You've been playing us all along.",
        "Carrie: I can't believe you would think anything like that.",
        "Marina: That's it, carrie. It's over. This ends right here, right now. We're out. Stay away from our fathers and stay the hell away from us.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Billy: Hey...",
        "Josh: What's the matter? Are you sick or something?",
        "Billy: No, he's not sick. He is stoned out of his gourd.",
        "Marina: So what's it going to be carrie? Your revenge or ours?",
        "Alexandra: Whatever you're up to, I think it would do you a lot of good to just back off, because you really have no idea what you're dealing with."
