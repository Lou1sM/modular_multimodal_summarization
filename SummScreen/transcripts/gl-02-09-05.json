( Laughs )", "Gus: Hey.", "Harley: Moving day, huh?", "Gus: Yeah.", "Harley: You don't have to go, you know.", "Gus: Well, I can't stay here.", "Harley: Yeah, frozen assets and all. No, I mean, you don't have to go because I will pay for your room. You are my lawyer, and as you're always reminding me, I should be paying you anyway.", "Gus: You can't afford me.", "Harley: No arguments.", "Gus: I'm not... I would never take your money.", "Harley: Then stay with me.", "Gus: I would never be able to concentrate with you around running around in hair curlers and pajamas. I can'T.", "Harley: Curlers? What is it, the '50s?", "Gus: I'll find some other place. I'm fine.", "Harley: Where are you going to go? You don't have any money.", "Gus: I'm fine, don't worry about it.", "Harley: How can I not worry? Okay, here's my best offer: Harley's angels office. You can stay there.", "Gus: Yeah, all right.", "Harley: Okay.", "Gus: Thanks.", "Harley: Sure. I hate it that you've given up everything for me.", "Gus: It wasn't really that much.", "Harley: It was everything.", "Gus: No, it wasn't everything, believe me. Thank you. I've got to... I've got to go find me a killer.", "Harley: Oh, yeah.", "Gus: Thanks again for everything.", "Harley: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Alan, you have done some pretty radical things in your time, but trying to get your own son disbarred? You can't be serious.", "Alan: I'm very serious, ross. He's not fit to practice law, and I want him stopped.", "Ross: From doing what, representing harley?", "Alan: He assaulted elizabeth. Now he is so desperate to clear harley from phillip's murder, he will do just about anything.", "Ross: Obviously he's still in love with her.", "Alan: Well, that's his mistake.", "Ross: And of course, you know that your timing is impeccable. Harley's trial is about to begin.", "Alan: Is it?", "Ross: Alan, over the years i watched you slowly but surely destroy phillip. I'm not going to help you do the same thing to gus.", "Alan: Ross, gus will pay. And I will not rest until this is taken care of!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: So you did receive the glass shard with the dna sample on it? All right. Well, look, how much time before we find out if the blood on the glass matches? All right. Look, please just give me a call back as soon as we get those results, all right? All right, thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Hey, there.", "Dinah: So this is an interesting for a spaulding stockholder gathering.", "Olivia: All right, you know what? Alan insisted. Something about family unity. His granddaughter owns the place.", "Dinah: And this is where phillip was murdered. Right there, in fact.", "Bill: Uh, yeah. Sis, we know that, but olivia's got to schmooze some people so let's not bring that thing up, okay?", "Dinah: All right, don't worry about me. Olivia, good luck.", "Olivia: Thank you.", "Messenger: Are you dinah marler?", "Dinah: Yeah.", "Messenger: These are for you.", "Dinah: Oh. Wow! I wonder who they're from. Oh.", "Olivia: Whoever gave those to you has expensive taste. They're beautiful.", "Dinah: Yes, they sure are.", "Bill: Okay, sis, who's your secret admirer, huh?", "Dinah: Oh, from who else but the good doctor.", "Olivia: Corey?", "Dinah: Yes.", "Olivia: Oh.", "Dinah: He likes me. He really, really likes.", "Bill: Well, that's great.", "Olivia: I have to tell you, i didn't see that coming. I didn't think they would hit it off.", "Bill: I bet a lot of people said that about us, huh?", "Olivia: No. Really?", "Dinah: What are you up to now, cassie?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: All right, dinah, you want to mess with me? Come and get it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: All right, I'm going to get out of here before people start showing up.", "Olivia: \"People\" as in alan?", "Bill: Alan's a person? I didn't realize that.", "Olivia: You don't have to go. You're a spaulding stockholder.", "Bill: Yeah. But I think I should keep a low profile, don't you?", "Olivia: I just like having you here to support me.", "Bill: Well, that's what husbands do, baby?", "Olivia: Oh. ( Clears throat ) hello. Hello, margaret. Hello, glenn. It's good to see both of you again. You do remember my husband, bill lewis?", "Bill: Good to see you. I really got to run, though.", "Glenn: Hey, you snagged yourself quite a woman, lewis.", "Bill: Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm known for my snagging.", "Glenn: It's good to see you again, olivia.", "Olivia: It's good to see you, too.", "Margaret: You better have a miracle in you, dear. Spaulding certainly needs one.", "Olivia: Well, there's a lot i want to accomplish.", "Margaret: Well, priority one should be no more meetings in diners. It's so tacky.", "Glenn: Don't listen to that old battleaxe. I happen to like diner food.", "Olivia: Well, you know, elizabeth & company is actually owned by alan's granddaughter, lizzie.", "Glenn: Yeah, I read that in the newspaper.", "Olivia: Yeah, and alan and i thought that having the meeting here would show a little company unity.", "Bill: Olivia and alan always on the same page.", "Olivia: You're not going to believe this. Six months, spaulding's going to be stronger than ever. I think you and the others are going to be very pleased.", "Glenn: I'm sure we will.", "Bill: Glenn's a big fan. Anything I should know about?", "Olivia: In one hour with margaret connell, one hour with all of them and I'm going to have them eating out of my hands. It's all in how you sell it.", "Bill: And you love selling it.", "Olivia: Yeah, along with a few other things. ( Knock at the door )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Hi... oh, it's you.", "Coop: Hi. Yeah, I've been getting that a lately.", "Harley: No, I mean I was expecting, um... nobody.", "Coop: Nobody? Well, would nobody bring you breakfast?", "Harley: Ah, that's so sweet. Actually, I was expecting gus. He just left. Come on in.", "Coop: Okay.", "Harley: So who sent you, dad or frank?", "Coop: Neither, actually.", "Harley: Okay, you're not here to try to talk me into taking that plea deal, are you?", "Coop: Why would I be doing that?", "Harley: Because besides, gus, everybody else thinks I'm guilty.", "Coop: Harley, look, I just don't want to see you give up when...", "Harley: When what?", "Coop: When there's still hope.", "Harley: I like your optimism. But if it's not me, it could be somebody that I know, somebody that I'm close to.", "Coop: Ah, you see, you don't know that, all right? I mean, phillip had a lot of enemies, and there were a lot of reasons why people hated him. And who knows? Maybe the killer, maybe they had a reason that we don't even know, we didn't even think of yet.", "Harley: I like that. Like what?", "Coop: Uh...", "Harley: Do you have an idea about something that you're not telling me?", "Coop: No. No, I don't have any ideas. I don't have anybody in mind. I'm just saying that we shouldn't give up looking just yet.", "Harley: Well, that's what gus is doing right now.", "Coop: That's good. You know, I have to say that I'm actually glad gus is on your side. I'm just glad that he chose to be on your side and stick with you instead of staying with that crackpot family of his.", "Harley: Some choice, huh?", "Coop: It certainly was the right choice. Gus believes in you. I believe in you. The whole family believes in you, harley. We just don't want to see you give up, that's all.", "Harley: I am not going to give up, okay? I promise. And I should tell you something. Earlier when I said that I was expecting nobody and then I said I was expecting gus, that was a lie. Actually, I've invited someone over here. And hopefully she'll help me remember if I killed phillip.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Hello, lizzie.", "Lizzie: How did you get in here?", "Gus: Well, hilda let me in.", "Lizzie: Well, I'm going to talk to granddad about her.", "Gus: You're not talking to anybody about anything. It's me. Don't blame it on hilda. I can be very charming when i want to be.", "Lizzie: You can be very threatening, too.", "Gus: Decaf grande skimmed mocha latte?", "Lizzie: Are you trying to bribe me now, gus?", "Gus: Oh, please. With a coffee? Maybe a diamond necklace, yes, but come on.", "Lizzie: Look, I'm not going to talk to you, okay? I'm not going to talk to you, I'm not going to talk to harley, I'm not going to talk to coop...", "Gus: Listen. No, no, no, no. Listen. Look, you've got it all wrong, okay? I feel very badly about the way things ended, and you are my niece and we should really try to get along. After all, we're family.", "Lizzie: Family doesn't do what you did to me. Family doesn't come after me. They don't make everybody think I'm crazy.", "Gus: You think about it, lizzie, okay? Because harley is up for a murder that she did not commit.", "Lizzie: Yeah, says you.", "Gus: No. Your father's killer is out there and I know that you know something.", "Lizzie: You need to stop it right now, gus. Just stop it. Do not pin my father's murder on me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Alan, I know that you are angry at gus for representing harley and for turning his back on you. But that's not grounds to get anybody disbarred.", "Alan: Look, I realize this is personal and I may not be able to forgive him, but this time he has hurt elizabeth.", "Ross: Lizzie is my niece and I care a great deal about her. But with recent history, alan, i don't know.", "Alan: What do you mean by that?", "Ross: I mean her word along with yours is simply not good enough.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: I'm not trying to pin anything on you, lizzie. I just want to know what you're hiding. Tell me what you're hiding!", "Alan: She's right in here.", "Gus: Tell me what you're hiding!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Leave me alone. What are you... ow! What are you trying to do? Granddad. Are you trying to scald a confession out of me now, gus?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: You know, you could have picked up the phone. The flowers were pretty, but a big waste of cash.", "Cassie: Got your attention, didn't it?", "Dinah: Yes, it did. But your note didn't make much sense.", "Cassie: Well, we all can't be manipulative geniuses, dinah.", "Dinah: You do okay.", "Cassie: Aren't you wondering why I asked you here?", "Dinah: I wonder about a lot of things. I wonder why the sky is blue. I wonder why birds suddenly appear when you're near. And I wonder why we're in the barn.", "Cassie: Because I don't want you in my house.", "Dinah: Oh. I see, we animals have been relegated to the barn.", "Cassie: Something like that.", "Dinah: You have a way of making your guests feel welcome. I hope you were more hospitable in that hotel room the night before your wedding.", "Cassie: I was wondering when we were going to get to that.", "Dinah: Yeah. And now the real reason why I'm here.", "Cassie: So, are you in on this with jonathan or did you come up with the whole plan?", "Dinah: Excuse me? I did not lure little johnny into my hotel room that night. No, I just had the great pleasure of seeing him slip into your night of passion.", "Cassie: There wasn't a night of anything, dinah.", "Dinah: Hey, there is no reason to be ashamed, cassie. Look, you were having pre- wedding jitters. You know, you threw a few back, you invited a hot guy up to your room. You wanted one last fling, some privacy. Maybe that's the reason the \"do not disturb\" sign ended up on your door.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Coop: Okay, so who is this person that's going to be helping you?", "Harley: Well, technically, she's what you might call a hypnotist.", "Coop: You're kidding me, right?", "Harley: Do I look like I'm kidding?", "Coop: No, you don'T. Harley, come on. A hypnotist? You don't need that.", "Harley: Do you have a better idea.", "Coop: Well... ( sighs ) no, I don't have a better idea.", "Harley: Okay, well there you go. Hey, I'm not saying it will definitely help, but it's certainly worth a shot.", "Coop: Oh, come... harley, this seems just a bit desperate, though, don't you think?", "Harley: Desperate? I would say that I am desperate. I've got a trial at the end of the week. Look, this may be my only shot at knowing what actually happened to me that night, okay?", "Coop: Okay. All right, fine. You know, give it a shot. But if it doesn't work out, just realize that you have other options. Like you said, gus is out there looking.", "Harley: Looking is not finding.", "Coop: True. But you never know. There are other clues, perhaps other suspects that could pop up. ( Sighs ) all right, look, just do what you have to do, okay?", "Harley: Gee, thanks frank.", "Coop: Hey, that's not funny, okay? Look, I can look out for you, too, can't I?", "Harley: Yes, you can. But you know what? You're going to have to do it someplace else because zocor the great is on her way.", "Coop: No. Please tell me that that's a joke. Zocor the great? What kind of a name is that?", "Harley: ( Laughs ) now I am actually kidding.", "Coop: That's good. Thank you. All right.", "Harley: Come on. You've got to go. Get out.", "Coop: All right, all right.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hypnotist: Hi. Ms. Cooper? I'm tara.", "Harley: Hi. Please come in.", "Hypnotist: Thank you.", "Harley: We've actually met a few times at the police station. I used to be a cop.", "Hypnotist: Oh.", "Harley: And this is my brother, henry. Henry was actually on his way out, weren't 'ya?", "Coop: Uh, yeah. Call me.", "Harley: I will. Come in.", "Hypnotist: Thanks.", "Harley: Thank you for coming by on such short notice.", "Hypnotist: Yeah, it's no problem. I just hope I can help.", "Harley: Not as much as I do.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Are you all right, sweetheart?", "Lizzie: I'm fine.", "Alan: What the hell is going on, gus?", "Gus: I did not pour coffee on her, okay? She heard you guys walking in and she dumped it all over herself.", "Lizzie: Why would I do that?", "Gus: For the same exact reason that you tried to make it look like I attacked you the other day.", "Lizzie: You did attack me!", "Gus: No, I didn't attack you!", "Alan: Now do you see, ross?", "Gus: Ross, can you believe this?", "Ross: At this point, I don't know what to believe, gus. Lizzie, why did gus spill that coffee?", "Gus: Oh, ross. Come on, please.", "Lizzie: Gus is hell-bent to make me out to be my father's killer. But you know what? After everything I've been through? When is this going to stop?", "Gus: It's going to stop when you stop hiding whatever it is you're hiding.", "Lizzie: I'm not hiding anything. Quit bullying me around!", "Gus: I am not bullying you. I'm working on a case, here! Don't you get it?", "Alan: You are bullying her. Who in her right mind would spill hot coffee all over herself?", "Gus: Exactly. You just answered your own question.", "Lizzie: Granddad, I can'T...", "Alan: All right. That's enough, gus. Ross, are you convinced now?", "Ross: No, I'm not, alan.", "Gus: Convinced of what?", "Ross: Alan wants the bar association to investigate your conduct in this case.", "Gus: You're trying to get me disbarred?", "Lizzie: I think it's great. You should be disbarred. Then you can't hurt me or anyone else.", "Gus: Ross, honestly. You're not falling for any of this, are you?", "Ross: Gus, I know that alan has an agenda, but on the other hand, so do you.", "Gus: No, no, no. Why would I ever be so stupid or do something stupid to jeopardize my case. I'd never do that.", "Ross: I would hope that you wouldn't, but... ( cell phone rings ) sorry. Hello? Blake, I'm right in the middle of something. She is? All right, I'll be there as soon as I can. You're going to have to forgive me; I have to go.", "Alan: I expect to hear from you, ross.", "Ross: Oh, you will, alan. Lizzie, good-bye.", "Gus: You know, you've taken away my money and my credit cards, and you've kicked me out of the house. I feel like I got nothing left to lose, and that makes me a very dangerous man.", "Alan: He will pay for what he's done, and so will harley.", "Lizzie: But uncle ross will take care of everything, won't he?", "Alan: How could he not, sweetheart, after what he just witnessed, huh?", "Lizzie: A witness.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: So you were following me?", "Dinah: No, not at all. Sometimes things just have a way of falling together. ( Gasps ) watch your temper. No, if I wanted to stake out and ruin your life, I would have used your mistake so that i could blow your wedding with edmund sky-high. But I didn't do that.", "Cassie: Okay. So what are you waiting for?", "Dinah: I have better things to do with my life than to plot against you.", "Cassie: Then why were you here the night of my wedding?", "Dinah: I don't know. Chalk it up to morbid curiosity, I suppose. I wanted to see if you could pull it off again.", "Cassie: Pull off what, dinah?", "Dinah: This scam that you've been running for years now. You know, where you do what you want but you end up on top. Did you earn this farm? No. See, what you did is you convinced hart into thinking that you deserved it. That's exactly what you did with richard so that he went and he would go and make you a princess. And that's what you're doing with edmund right now. Do you deserve his love and devotion? Absolutely not. Not after what you did with jonathan. But look at you. You're standing here in all of your glory, with everything at your feet once again.", "Cassie: Is that why you came here and you ripped down all the decorations? Yeah, I know about that, too.", "Dinah: Good for you. I'm happy for you. Why don't you tell me why you really invited me into this barn?", "Cassie: I know you, dinah.", "Dinah: You know how this place hurts me. And you know that hart and i were supposed to be married in here, and ironically, you decided to get married here.", "Cassie: Man, this isn't about this barn, and it isn't about being a princess. Hell, this isn't even about me, dinah. This is about you, and the fact that no man could even stand to be around you, let alone love you.", "Dinah: You know something? I deserve the husband. I deserve the family. I deserve the house. You hear me? I deserve it. Not you! Not you!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", ">Gus: Coming up on \"guiding light.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: He's coming after me again. I want to get away.", "Hypnotist: Do you get away?", "Harley: I want to hurt him back.", "Hypnotist: What do you do next?", "Harley: I see the gun.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: So get your stuff. I'm not letting you do this.", "Olivia: I'm sorry. You're not letting me do this?", "Bill: That's exactly what i said.", "Olivia: I don't believe this.", "Bill: Now go get your stuff.", "Alan: Well, well, well, well. Is there trouble in paradise?", "Bill: Yes.", "Olivia: No. Oprah: The cast of \"everybody loves raymond\" says goodbye.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Come on, pick up. You know you want to. I really need you to. ( Cell phone ringing )", "Coop: ( Sighs ) hello, lizzie.", "Lizzie: Hey. Where are you?", "Coop: I'm at company. I just got here.", "Lizzie: Great. Come over here.", "Coop: Well, it's a little impossible right now. You actually scheduled me to work.", "Lizzie: Okay, so I'm un- scheduling you. Come on over. I'm at my house.", "Coop: Lynn's here by herself. I can't, you know, leave her in the lurch.", "Lizzie: Okay, so what? You've got 15 minutes, all right?", "Coop: Great.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Okay, I've got to go.", "Olivia: No, we still have a few minutes.", "Bill: Do you want glenn and margaret to catch us making out in the corner?", "Olivia: Are you kidding? It's going to give them a much- needed thrill.", "Bill: You are a pervert.", "Olivia: Be one with me.", "Bill: Okay, as much as I love this, I really, really, really got to go.", "Olivia: All right.", "Bill: Come on. Walk me outside. I want you to promise me one thing.", "Olivia: Sure, what?", "Bill: When you gain enough power, I want you to drive a stake through the collective spaulding heart once and for all so we can get on with our lives, okay? Do something a little less revenge-driven?", "Olivia: Oh, yeah. No, I promise. But it's going to take time.", "Bill: Time.", "Olivia: Yeah. We talked about this.", "Bill: Right, if anyone can do it...", "Olivia: It's me.", "Bill: Yeah.", "Olivia: Look, everything that I'm doing, I'm doing for us.", "Bill: I know.", "Olivia: I am. Nothing means more to me than our family.", "Bill: Same here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: Get off, dinah. You're pathetic. All you want is my life.", "Dinah: You would say that. You don't even know what it's like to struggle, you know that?", "Cassie: Whatever.", "Dinah: Get away from me.", "Cassie: I have struggled for everything my entire life.", "Dinah: Yes, and then you decided to take my one chance at happiness and make me pay! And I've been feeling that pain ever since.", "Cassie: Get off.", "Dinah: No, you get off. You started it.", "Cassie: No, you started it.", "Dinah: You called me here. What did you expect me to do?", "Cassie: Fine. I'll end it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: What the...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: I lie awake at night trying to remember, but nothing comes. That whole night is just a blank to me, at least the important part.", "Hypnotist: Well, maybe I can help you fill in that blank.", "Harley: I hope so. Let me ask you something. Will I be aware of what I'm saying?", "Hypnotist: Oh, yes. You're fully conscious. You're just in a very deep state of relaxation.", "Harley: Good.", "Hypnotist: Shall we get started?", "Harley: Sure. Do you want me to sit or lie down?", "Hypnotist: Whichever you prefer. You should be comfortable.", "Harley: Okay, then I'll lie down.", "Hypnotist: Are you comfortable?", "Harley: I think so.", "Hypnotist: All right, I want you to start by counting backwards from 20, very slowly.", "Harley: ( Takes breath ) okay. 20. 19. 18...", "Hypnotist: Now a feeling of relaxation is traveling up your body.", "Harley: ...17...", "Hypnotist: Starting in your toes, moving into your legs, spreading rapidly.", "Harley: ...15, 14...", "Hypnotist: Now your legs are completely relaxed.", "Harley: ...13, 12, 11.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Gus: Hey. Look at this. You got a nicer room than me. What are you doing?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: I came by to pick up", "Ross: I came by to pick up clarissa from her play date with rj and will, and mrs. Chitwood told me that you were out here.", "Cassie: Well, we love having you, sweetie. Well, she can come over any time she wants.", "Ross: What?", "Clarissa: She looks weird.", "Ross: Yes, I agree with you, clarissa. Your big sister looks a little weird.", "Dinah: Hey, clariss. Look... daddy, look, I can explain this.", "Cassie: Why don't you let me do it? I'm sure he wants to know the truth, dinah.", "Dinah: You know what? Why don't you go ahead and do that and turn my own father against me?", "Ross: Dinah, why don't you take clarissa to the car?", "Dinah: And leave her here to lie to you, daddy?", "Ross: Take your sister to the car. I'll be out there in a few minutes.", "Dinah: I'm going to tell you something. She invited me here first.", "Ross: Did you?", "Cassie: Yeah, but I had a good reason.", "Ross: Cassie. It is one thing for dinah to go looking for trouble. It is quite another for you to invite her over for it.", "Dinah: See how this works, sweet pea? I make the messes and daddy cleans them up. I want you to remember that.", "Clarissa: Okay?", "Dinah: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bill: Ow. I didn't see that coming.", "Olivia: Would you just go home. You don't belong here. ( Whispers ): Sorry about that. Alan is back there. ( Normal voice ): Do you listen to anything I say?", "Bill: Well, you know what? You should not be here. You should never have taken this job!", "Olivia: Why not? It's a wonderful opportunity.", "Bill: Really? For who?", "Olivia: Yeah. For me. For emma and for you.", "Bill: Oh, my... you are living in a dream world.", "Olivia: Oh, come on. You are a spaulding stockholder. With me at the company, I can look out for your interests.", "Bill: Gee, what a comfort.", "Olivia: ( Quietly ):You are so cute when you're mad. ( Normal voice ): I can't discuss this right now, okay?", "Bill: Really? When would you like to discuss it? ( Whispers ): I wish I could take you home right now and discuss it naked.", "Olivia: Don't do this, bill.", "Bill: What are you doing here? Okay? You had no right to take this job without running it by me first.", "Olivia: What would you have said, \"go ahead and take it, show them what you've got, olivia?\" I don't think so.", "Bill: What about slingshot?", "Olivia: What about it? You can run the company.", "Bill: Run it? We're going after the same clients. No, get your stuff. I'm not letting you do this.", "Olivia: I'm sorry? You're not letting me do this?", "Bill: That's exactly what i said. Now go get your stuff.", "Olivia: I don't believe this.", "Alan: Well, well, well, well. Is there trouble in paradise?", "Bill: Yes.", "Olivia: No. ( Knocking on door )", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Come in.", "Coop: Hello, lizzie. So what's up?", "Lizzie: Nothing. I just didn't want to be alone, that's all.", "Coop: Why? What's wrong?", "Lizzie: Well, if you take a look at me. Thank god I didn't get burned.", "Coop: Wow. Um... all right, I don't get this. You obviously spilled coffee on yourself, and now...", "Lizzie: Why would I spill coffee on myself? Gus did this to me.", "Coop: You're telling me gus threw coffee on you? What did you do to him?", "Lizzie: Nothing. He's just convinced that I know something that's going to save harley. He's lost his mind.", "Coop: All right, why don't you just tell me exactly what happened here, okay?", "Lizzie: Okay. I didn't know anything and... i don't know, he just snapped. I told him to calm down.", "Coop: He snapped? Why did he snap? What were you guys talking about? What were you saying?", "Lizzie: I don't know. Does it matter?", "Coop: Yeah, it matters. I'm trying to just figure out, here. I want to recreate this. I want you to be specific. I want you to give me details.", "Lizzie: ( Scoffs ) word for word? Um, you know, I don't remember. I was so upset.", "Coop: Lizzie, I'm trying to figure out here why gus would throw hot coffee all over you, okay?", "Lizzie: You think your sister is innocent, right?", "Coop: She is innocent.", "Lizzie: Yeah, okay, whatever. But gus isn't helping at all by coming after me. He's wasting his time.", "Coop: Look, love can make you do some really strange things, okay?", "Lizzie: It's not even like that, coop. If my granddad or uncle ross hadn't came through the door, who knows what gus would have done?", "Coop: Wait. Alan and ross saw what happened?", "Lizzie: He has lost his mind, clearly. What? Why are you looking at me like that?", "Coop: No reason. Um. ( Cell phone ringing ) I need to take this. Can you excuse me? This is kind of important. Tm", "Lizzie: ( Scoffs ) it's no more important than me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Have you ever heard of knocking?", "Gus: You're getting hypnotized?", "Harley: I was trying to, until you sailed in here. I thought you had stuff you had to do.", "Gus: Why are you doing this?", "Harley: Because I need to know.", "Gus: This doesn't always work. You know that, right? I mean, manufactured memories, they pop up.", "Harley: I know. She's worked with the police department.", "Gus: And it's not admissible in court, either. You know that, too, right?", "Harley: I don't care. I'm doing this for me. Can't you just support me on this?", "Gus: Yeah. Sure. But I'm staying.", "Harley: No.", "Gus: Yes, I am. I just compromised. It's your turn, okay? I'm staying.", "Harley: Okay, but I don't want to hear a word out of you, okay? I'm sorry. Can we just start again? Phillip taunted me, asked me if I loved the boys more than he did. Wanted me to prove it.", "Hypnotist: How?", "Harley: By stopping him. He loaded the gun and he gave it to me. He put it in my hands. It was almost as if he wanted me to kill him.", "Hypnotist: What did you do after phillip put the gun in your hands?", "Harley: We struggled. I didn't want it. He forced me to hold onto it. He kept screaming at me to pull the trigger.", "Hypnotist: And then what?", "Harley: I... I got away. I started to leave. No. No.", "Hypnotist: What is it? What are you seeing?", "Harley: Phillip. He's coming after me again. I want to get away.", "Hypnotist: Do you get away?", "Harley: No. I fall. Against the wall. ( Whimpering ) my head is bleeding. I want to hurt him back.", "Hypnotist: What do you do next?", "Harley: I see the gun. I want to grab the gun.", "Gus: All right, stop! Stop, please. Stop. Thank you very much.", "Hypnotist: You can't just do that.", "Gus: You're finished. Thank you. Sorry. Here you go. Thank you.", "Harley: ( Gasping ) gus, what happened?", "Gus: It's just not worth it, okay? It's too hard, it's too painful. It's not worth it. It is not worth it.", "Harley: Like hell it's not!", "Gus: Harley. Harley!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Olivia: Everything is fine, alan.", "Alan: Are you sure about that? Because bill doesn't seem to be very happy with your new position at spaulding.", "Bill: Oh, go figure.", "Olivia: I was just telling bill that now is not the time to discuss this.", "Bill: There's nothing to discuss. You're not taking the job.", "Olivia: Oh, yes, I am.", "Bill: Olivia, we have a partnership agreement. You can't just walk away from that.", "Olivia: The only place I am walking right now is inside to meet my stockholders.", "Alan: Correction: My stockholders. Would you care to join me?", "Olivia: I'll be late. Don't hold dinner.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: So I guess that stupid phone call was a lot more important than me.", "Coop: Lizzie, could you please for once stop pouting, here? Okay?", "Lizzie: No. No, I'm not pouting at all. Just letting you know that you're rude.", "Coop: Fine. You know, I don't want to argue about this. I was rude. I owe you one, okay?", "Lizzie: Where are you going?", "Coop: I'm going back to work.", "Lizzie: No, you're not. I'm calling in my favor.", "Coop: What?", "Lizzie: Well, you said you owed me one. I need your help.", "Coop: I thought me coming over here was all about gus?", "Lizzie: Well, yeah, it includes gus. I might as well tell you. I mean, you're going to find out anyway.", "Coop: What am I finding out, lizzie?", "Lizzie: My grandfather is trying to have gus disbarred for what he did the other day to me. And after this whole episode today, I mean...", "Coop: Wait. Lizzie, you know what? I don't know where you're going with this, but what I do know is that gus is harley's lawyer, and frankly, whatever you've got cooked up, I don't want to be involved, okay?", "Lizzie: See, that's the part... you kind of already are involved. I mean, you saw him yelling at me at J. Farley'S. You know he bruised my arm.", "Coop: Wait a minute, lizzie. Wait. Wait a minute.", "Lizzie: You're just going to have to be my witness. I'm sorry, coop. You've got to be my witness.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ross: Dinah is trying to turn over a new leaf.", "Cassie: Oh, says dinah.", "Ross: I have seen the changes in her.", "Cassie: Oh, come on. There's no change. She is still the same-old dinah. She is still psycho, ross.", "Ross: Well, if that's the case, why invite her over? Why not stay as far away from her as possible?", "Cassie: Because I had to get a few things straight with her, that's why.", "Ross: Such as?", "Cassie: Edmund and I are trying to have a baby. Who do I see at the doctor's office? Dinah.", "Ross: Yes, I'm aware. I know that dinah wants to get pregnant.", "Cassie: Yes, of course dinah wants to get pregnant. And then there's my wedding.", "Ross: She stayed away from your wedding, cassie.", "Cassie: No, she didn'T. She just admitted to coming here and trashing this place.", "Ross: Oh, god. She admitted that?", "Cassie: Among other things. I am so close to pressing charges against her.", "Ross: Don't do that. Don'T. I'll take care of it.", "Cassie: You better, ross, or I will.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Dinah: What happened out there?", "Ross: It's all taken care of.", "Dinah: What did I tell you? We've got the greatest daddy in the world. We're the luckiest girls in the world, huh?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Harley: Come back! Stop!", "Gus: Stop it. Stop it.", "Harley: No, I won't stop it. I was remembering. I was this close. How could you snatch that away from me?", "Gus: Because I was scared for you. You should have seen the look on your face. I had to stop it.", "Harley: No. That's not why you stopped it. You stopped it because you were afraid of what I was going to say.", "Gus: No.", "Harley: You think I did it.", "Gus: No.", "Harley: No, you don't think i did it. You know I did it. All along, you've been saying that I couldn't have killed phillip but you... you really think I did it, and you don't care.", "Gus: I never cared. I'm just never going to let you go to jail. Ever. Next, on \"guiding light...\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: Well, if you want it so bad, why don't you do it yourself? Go on. You go kick him down the stairs. You go beat the living daylights out of him. But you do it in front of me this time.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Danny: After everything that I have been through, being with you could never be hard on me."], "Transcript Author": ["By Boo"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF1hrltjT8E"}
