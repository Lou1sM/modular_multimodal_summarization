        "Voice over radio: Your partner may swear it was only one time, but once a cheater, always a cheater. And Dinah Marler is smart; she'll know you slept with Harley. For those of you just tuning in, today's topic is defining the relationship. Is it just sex or is it more?",
        "Dinah: No, I want to hear this.",
        "Mallet: No, no, not so great. Great.",
        "Voice over radio: There comes a point when every new couple asks, \"Are we exclusive or are we rabbits?\"",
        "Mallet: Rabbits?",
        "Dinah: Oh-- come here.",
        "Mallet: No, what are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Dinah: I'm trying to find solidarity with my sisterhood.",
        "Mallet: No we don't need Dr. Jill to help figure this out.",
        "Dinah: Oh, that's right because we're rabbits.",
        "Mallet: I'm just saying we need to... learn to embrace our inner rabbit. Dinah:( Laughs ) Okay, then, what exactly are we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You are going to be the star of this play. Hey, what's wrong?",
        "R.J.: Three girls are going to kiss me. It's not even stupid Valentine's Day yet.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well first of all, there's nothing stupid about Valentine's Day. It's just a holiday about love. It's a chance to show our friends and family how much they mean to us.",
        "R.J.: Will Jeffrey be there?",
        "Cassie: He's um... he's busy.",
        "R.J.: Tammy will be there, though, right?",
        "Cassie: I don't know.",
        "R.J.: With Aunt Reva?",
        "Cassie: We'll see. Okay, honey, why don't you go find your bow and arrow? I don't want you to be late.",
        "R.J.: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Here, for you.",
        "Tammy: Thanks. Did you get any sleep last night?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Yeah. Usually I don't sleep much at all. I have nightmares about my dad and stuff, but last night I didn't dream.",
        "Tammy: Well that is a sign you're putting all of the bad stuff behind you.",
        "Jonathan: That's because of you. I'm going to clean this mess up and make things right because of you. It's all because of you.",
        "Tammy: Okay. We can't. Not yet, but soon.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Let's get on it. Let's get our own place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hello, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, Josh.",
        "Josh: Listen, just for the record, I want you to know that I'm finished. I mean you're probably aware that I was looking into your past a bit. In fact, I contacted a friend of mine at the agency--",
        "Jeffrey: Scott Malone.",
        "Josh: Yes, Scott. And asked him to look into the time you were going undercover as Richard. I was doing that for Cassie. I just hope you understand that.",
        "Jeffrey: And?",
        "Josh: And I've come to realize that your past is actually none of my business. I never intended to cause problems between you and Cassie. I told her that I'm finished with that, and now I'm telling you. I apologize. I just wanted to say that.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. About Cassie, you two spent a lot of time together during this search of yours and you talked a lot, right?",
        "Josh: Yes, we did.",
        "Jeffrey: So tell me, Josh, do you think there is any chance in hell that she's going to get over this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Come with me.",
        "Reva: What? Hey, hey!",
        "Cassie: Sit down.",
        "Reva: What's going on?",
        "Cassie: Sit! We need to talk.",
        "Jeffrey: You should have come to me first, Josh.",
        "Josh: For a denial.",
        "Jeffrey: The work I was doing with the agency was classified. I didn't tell anyone about it because that is the nature of the work.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I understand that, and maybe Cassie will understand some day, too. Maybe. Look, Jeffrey, I really am done over-thinking this, okay? Cassie loves you; you love Cassie. That's all that matters. As for me, I'm done chasing your ghosts.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's very big of you.",
        "Josh: It is a day to day struggle for me-- it really is-- because instincts are instincts, you understand that I'm sure. I'm just trying here, okay?-- Which is really, I think, what you need to do with Cassie. You need to try to help her work through this, to understand her feelings of betrayal and to be honest with her and to prove yourself. You do have the ability to be honest, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Excuse me, I have some work to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Valentine cards.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Cassie: Valentine cards. Who can I send them to? I can't send them to Jeffrey. I can't send them to Tammy. I can't even send them to you.",
        "Reva: And this is my fault?",
        "Cassie: No, it's my fault. I realize I pushed everybody away, but I miss my family. I love them, I love you and I will learn to live with whatever.",
        "Reva: I didn't hear an apology.",
        "Cassie: I am saying that I accept your choices, even though they're not mine, and I will respect them.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, there's a problem with that. Because I don't respect yours. You turned Jonathan and Tammy in for a crime they didn't commit, and Jonathan did time for something he was innocent of.",
        "Cassie: Reva, I'm asking for your help to put this family back together.",
        "Reva: And not facing the part where you help tear us apart?",
        "Cassie: You are the one who let Tammy and Jonathan move into your house.",
        "Reva: I did that so that Tammy would be safe.",
        "Cassie: Safe? She is never going to be safe as long as she is with Jonathan. Reva, how would you feel if Jonathan had hit on Marah?",
        "Reva: It's not even the same thing and you know it.",
        "Cassie: Well it's all the same to me, Reva, because they are family and they do not belong together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I have to go to R.J.'s play.",
        "Jonathan: Play?",
        "Tammy: It's a school thing. He's playing Cupid.",
        "Jonathan: It's a shame to let this room go to waste. Unless...",
        "Tammy: Unless what?",
        "Jonathan: We go down and tell the desk clerk that we want the room for another night. Unless...",
        "Tammy: I think that is a great idea. I'll be here as soon as R.J. takes his bow, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Hurry.",
        "Tammy: Okay, I'll be back. ( Knock on the door )",
        "Jonathan: What, did you forget something?",
        "Man: Delivery for Ms. Tammy Winslow.",
        "Jonathan: That's weird since nobody knows she's here.",
        "Man: I'm supposed to give it to her myself.",
        "Jonathan: Pretend you did. Thank you. \"Tammy. Be my Valentine. Hey, study buddy, I scored the notes from Professor Beck's class. I'll be at Company for the next hour, meet me or fail. Sandy.\" Okay. Want somebody to meet you? I'll be your Valentine.",

        "Dinah: Are you kidding me? I could host that show. I'm always sleeping with the wrong guy.",
        "Mallet: Thank you. Feels all right to me.",
        "Dinah: Well you know, compared to the other callers that are phoning in, I think that we would be-- what would be called-- relationship rock stars. I hate the sound of relationship; it' so...",
        "Mallet: It is loaded.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Okay, well we don't really need to talk about it because I think that's a little overrated.",
        "Mallet: Well, I have some questions.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Mallet: I've been wondering if um... do you want to be exclusive? Do you think it's something we should do? Do you... what do you think?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughing ) I think that, um, it's probably a little early, right, to be like naming it anything, but I can tell you I don't really want to be with anybody else. And, um, I have no desire for that. Except for fleet week, of course.",
        "Mallet: Sailors.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, so cute with the uniforms, tight--",
        "Mallet: Have you seen me in my police blues?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. Well, considering our situation, our thing, thingy going on here, I suppose I'll cut back on my dating.",
        "Dinah: Cut back?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm juggling so many women, but if it will make you feel better, I'll only hang on to the ugly ones.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) Okay. So I go cold turkey and you just like only talk to the trolls.",
        "Mallet: Trolls add spice.",
        "Dinah: Really? Okay, do I know any of those trolls?",
        "Mallet: Do I know any of the sailors.",
        "Dinah: No. No. I'm giving up sailors. Man, if you want to sleep your way through town, you go right ahead.",
        "Mallet: Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Mallet: Do you care?",
        "Dinah: Only if you do.",
        "Mallet: Well, I uh... I do care. I'd like to know you're not irritating any other man except me. So, um, do you want to do this thing? Do you want to be exclusive?",
        "Dinah: Big words. Big words.",
        "Mallet: I'm trying to be a big man here.",
        "Dinah: Okay, it might suck.",
        "Mallet: What if it doesn't?",
        "Dinah: I'm saying it might.",
        "Mallet: That's the spirit.",
        "Dinah: Okay. So you're agreeing too...",
        "Mallet: I'm agreeing to tell my groupies to go moon over another devastatingly handsome, witty and charming detective. In exchange, you've got to give up the 82nd fleet.",
        "Dinah: Okay, so you really want this?",
        "Mallet: Don't you?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, yeah. I-- just as long as we don't call it a relationship.",
        "Mallet: I don't want to call it a relationship.",
        "Dinah: Bad luck.",
        "Mallet: Bad word.",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: We'll call it \"bond.\" \"Link.\" We'll call it \"connection.\" We'll call it...",
        "Mallet and Dinah: Bed buddies.",
        "Dinah: Jinx! You owe me coke. ( Laughter ) Okay, okay.",
        "Mallet: Bed buddies?",

        "Dinah: Uh-huh. I think that Dr. Jill would be very proud of us right now.",

        "Dinah: I think she's brought us this far, I do.",
        "Mallet: You know what I think?",
        "Dinah: Hmm? Whoa!",
        "Mallet: No more radio for you. Because the next thing you know, if I keep listening to it, I'll be married.",
        "Dinah: Oh! What did you say? Married.",
        "Mallet: What are you talking about, I didn't say that.",
        "Dinah: Yes, you did.",
        "Mallet: I was talking too much.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. ( Cell phone ringing ) Ooh, look, probably one of your trolls.",
        "Mallet: I'll get it! Leave the trolls to me. ( Cell phone ringing ) AC Mallet, does that have to be now? Okay. I'll be right there.",

        "Sandy: I was saving that for a friend.",
        "Jonathan: I'm sorry, study buddy. I told you to stay away from Tammy.",
        "Sandy: Lighten up. She just needs my notes. Inter-market analysis.",
        "Jonathan: If she needs anything, I'll give it to her. She's with me.",
        "Sandy: Wow, I didn't realize you were so insecure you wouldn't let me study with Tammy.",
        "Jonathan: It's not about that. Stay away from her.",
        "Sandy: Is that a threat? Because if it is, you'll lose. You are the towns favorite degenerate. I'm the golden boy.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Your golden boy days are over. I think that bigamy thing screwed you up a little bit.",
        "Sandy: Even so, people are starting to forgive me. They'll never forgive you.",
        "Jonathan: I know you, the real you. People think your sane and normal; you're not. The only reason you took that job at the college is because Tammy's there. That girlfriend, it's just a prop to throw people off. You don't want a new life. You don't want to start over. You want Tammy.",
        "Sandy: Yes! But only you and I know that. And you'll never convince Tammy of that because deep down you know if you hadn't intercepted that Valentine, should would be right where you are. With me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: R.J. was so cute.",
        "Cassie: He was. Did you see the look on his face when they kissed him?",
        "Reva: Of course, he was shy. The same thing happened to Shayne, and then all of a sudden everything changed. I miss you, Cassie. Not just my sister, but my best friend.",
        "Cassie: I miss you, too. I picked up the phone to call you a thousand times, especially with everything with Jeffrey going on.",
        "Reva: I would've taken that call.",
        "Cassie: You know who I talked to a lot lately? Josh.",
        "Reva: About Jeffrey?",
        "Cassie: Uh-huh. He told me to live in the moment. He told me that holding back because of fear or pride doesn't help anything.",
        "Reva: Josh said that?",
        "Cassie: Mm-hmm. ( Cell phone rings ) Oh, just a second. Hello.",
        "Tammy: Don't tell me I missed it. Is the play over?",
        "Reva: Yes, you missed it. You missed your little baby brother shooting cupid's arrow. It was perfect. ( Laughing)",
        "Tammy: Where is Mom?",
        "Reva: She's right over there.",
        "Cassie: I'm on my way. Can one of you take R.J.? I've got to go.",

        "Frank: No, actually, it can't. I think we all know Gus isn't coming back. And besides, you and I have a deal. I brought in some good men. So are you ready to meet them?",

        "Crocker: Well, patrol's fine, but I don't do chases.",

        "Frank: Charlie, thank you. Thank you, my friend.",
        "Hubbs: Thanks a lot.",
        "Frank: All right. See you. Okay, my good buddy here, done deal? What do you think?",
        "Mallet: Do you see what he does with his eyebrow? Did you see that thing?",
        "Frank: No.",
        "Mallet: I can't patrol that eyebrow all day, Frank. It's just, I don't know, he's not...",
        "Dinah: He's not Gus.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, maybe, I don't know.",
        "Dinah: You know what? He's different. Other people, they offer different things, so if it's too soon to move on, then...",
        "Mallet: I'm moving on, okay? I'm happier now than I've been in a long time.",
        "Dinah: Really?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, there's just something about the guy that is just not right. When you find the right partner, you just kind of know, you know?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I was thinking the exact same thing myself.",

        "Josh: How was it?",
        "Reva: It was much less painful than last year.",
        "Josh: Well, that's a good thing. Did you see Cassie?",
        "Reva: I did. We sat together. I can't say it went smooth, but at least we did make some progress.",
        "Josh: That's good. You guys need each other.",
        "Reva: Did you tell her that too?",
        "Josh: Too?",
        "Reva: She told me you've been filling in for me, giving her sisterly advice.",
        "Josh: Well, I wouldn't call it \"sisterly\" advice.",
        "Reva: She also told me what you said about living in the moment, how you shouldn't over- think things.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I was just making the point that sometimes the moment is all we have. You know, she really loves Jeffrey and...",
        "Reva: And when you love somebody, that's all that counts. I mean, we could spend years analyzing the past and trying to figure out the future, when all we really should be doing is just living. I mean, I know I've made that mistake. I was so obsessed with everything that wasn't working instead of everything that was. I wrecked my life looking everywhere except right in front of me. Even now, I can think of 100 reasons why I shouldn't be standing here right now and about 1,000 reasons why I shouldn't do what I'm about to do.",
        "Josh: What are you about to do?",

        "Mel: Well, when I was giving him his pain medication, he was...",
        "Rick: He got a little handsy with you, right? Men are such pigs! But, you know what, he was on medication, right? It happens. It happened to me yesterday. This old lady patient, heavily medicated, reached over and she grabbed my butt. I mean, talking death grip. But I can't blame her for that. I don't blame her at all. You know why? You know why? My eyesight might be going, sweetheart, but I know my butt still has game. And the reason why it has game is 'cause I work on it...",
        "Mel: Honey. Rick, Rick. Jeffrey-- we were talking about Jeffrey.",
        "Rick: Oh, Jeffrey, right.",
        "Mel: Right. He didn't do anything, okay? It's something that he said.",
        "Rick: People who are on drugs say stuff all the time, honey. I mean, you're a lawyer. You know they can't be accountable for what they say. Right?",
        "Mel: It's not the law that would hold him accountable. It's someone else.",

        "Cassie: So is this for your neck?",
        "Jeffrey: No, it's not for my neck. ( Groans ) Well, I guess I might as well tell you since you're going to find out anyway.",
        "Cassie: Uh-huh.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, Valentine's Day is coming up, and I wanted to give you a surprise, kind of make up for everything that has been going on lately, you know. So I wanted to do something that would just sweep you off your feet, kind of like when you first met Richard, you know. I mean, he swept you off your feet. You told me that he rode up on a white horse. So I had a horse sent over to the barn. ( Laughs ) A white horse. Yeah, I figured I'd get in touch with my inner Richard and my outer Richard or something. But it turns out the stable didn't have a nice, calm white horse. The only one that they had left was this wild pinto named Demon.",

        "Jeffrey: By the time we left the barn, he was riding me. ( Laughter )",

        "Dinah: Yeah. Maybe I should call it a day.",
        "Mallet: Why?",
        "Dinah: Well, you know, we're spending time with one another. We've defined this thing that we're in. You know, I don't want us to grow tired of something like this. I would hate to grow tired of you.",
        "Mallet: Then maybe I could ignore you in the hall between dates.",
        "Dinah: Yes. You know, I was thinking of ordering a pizza, so, you know, if you would like to come over, I don't think I can finish the entire pie.",
        "Mallet: Right, and if we ate it fast, then we wouldn't be spending too much time together.",
        "Dinah: Right, right, and then if we went back to our own rooms, you know, and you felt like you wanted to have more pizza, you would know who to call.",
        "Mallet: Yes, I would. Dr. Jill.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: I know that this may sound like it's coming out of nowhere, and it probably too late to be asking you out for Valentine's Day, but, um...",

        "Reva: What? I'm sorry?",
        "Josh: I'm going to have to pass. I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: Oh! Oh, you've already asked Olivia out, I guess, huh?",
        "Josh: No, I'm not doing anything. I just feel that Valentine's Day is a day that's filled with a lot of meaning, and I don't know that I can handle that right now. See, you spent most of the last year telling me that you need to figure out what it is you need, and that's where I am right now. I need to figure out what it is that I need. And so if I were to spend Valentine's Day with you or anybody else, I just don't think I can be there right now.",

        "Jeffrey: I told him not to tell you. I didn't want to bother you or upset you. I... I knew you were at the play with R.J., and I knew that all of this stuff going on with Tammy.",

        "Cassie: Good, 'cause this was a huge wakeup call for me. I just realized what I have and how much I do not want to lose him. Just holding his hand feels... I'm sorry, I'm just hugely relieved. Thank you so much for taking care of him. So what is it you want to tell me?",
        "Mel: I'm not even sure I should be doing this.",
        "Cassie: Doing what?",
        "Mel: Letting you take over. I was going to say that you can give him another dose of pain medication in an hour, but if you want me to stay...",
        "Cassie: No, we'll be fine. That's fine. You can go. I can follow instructions.",
        "Mel: Okay.",
