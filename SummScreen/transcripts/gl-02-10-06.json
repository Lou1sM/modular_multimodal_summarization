        "Gus: We're still here.",
        "Alan: Thanks to you.",
        "Gus: Thanks to me? Thanks to you. You had to go after Harley.",
        "Alan: We're here because you kidnapped me from the courthouse.",
        "Gus: We're here because I protected my wife. I can't believe I'm trapped in this place with you. I have a life. I have to get back to my wife and to my life.",
        "Alan: Do you honestly think that Harley is waiting for you to come back? We've been here almost a month. She's given up on you. They all have.",
        "Gus: Speak for yourself. Unlike you, I got people that love me, care about me. Who's going to mourn you? Your beloved wife, who married you for your money? Please. Your family? They all wish you were still locked up in the nuthouse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Lizzie: Hey.",
        "Coop: You all ready?",
        "Lizzie: Almost.",
        "Coop: What are you looking at?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing.",
        "Coop: Nothing, can I see?",
        "Lizzie: It's nothing.",
        "Coop: Look, Lizzie, if you want to go to this, I understand, he was your grandfather.",
        "Lizzie: No. We should be with your family. We need to be there for Harley.",
        "Coop: Look, Harley's a big girl. She'll understand if you want to go to this.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not going to go to the memorial service.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you know how much I'm going to miss Alan. Look, I just think that it would be a good idea for you to go.",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Coop: That's all. You need to go say goodbye...",
        "Lizzie: It's going to be a joke, Coop. Granddad didn't have any friends; nobody liked him. The only people who are going to go are going to be there to suck up to my family. The same people who would backstab him in two seconds if he were still alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Alan-Michael, wait up, please! I've been following you for almost a block. You can walk me to the church now.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm not going to the church.",
        "Alexandra: What do you mean? You have to go.",
        "Alan-Michael: No, I don't, and I'm not.",
        "Alexandra: I realize you want to keep up this pretense that you hated the man. You have a family obligation here. There will be a number of shareholders there, dear.",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't need them, Aunt Alex.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Fine. Did you happen to think that this may be one of the last times you have a chance... I can't go in there alone.",
        "Alan-Michael: If I could be there for you, I would, but I can't. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hey, Pop, is Harley here yet?",
        "Buzz: Not yet. This is not to be a memorial service. Are we all on the same page about this?",
        "Frank: Pop, I know what she said, but I'm just not sure about it.",
        "Buzz: She doesn't want this to be a cry fest about Gus, so we're not going to force it, right, Frank?",
        "Olivia: Hey, are you closed?",
        "Marina: Hey. Yeah. We're having this thing for Harley to remember Gus.",
        "Olivia: Oh, gosh. Will you tell her I'm thinking about her?",
        "Marina: Yeah, I will.",
        "Buzz: Marina, could you... I need a hand in the kitchen.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Buzz: Hi. You look like you could use one of my famously frothy lattes.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I was kind of hoping it could get me through Alan's stuffy memorial.",
        "Buzz: You're going to Alan's memorial?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, pay my respects.",
        "Buzz: You still have a soft spot for old Alan, do you?",
        "Olivia: Listen, maybe I should just go somewhere else.",
        "Buzz: No, no. Come on, come inside.",
        "Olivia: I don't want to impose...",
        "Buzz: Harley's not even here yet. No, come on... for me.",
        "Olivia: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Harley: Hi.",
        "Dinah: Mallet, get me a soda, okay?",
        "Mallet: Company? That family dinner? Yeah, Frank told me about that.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Seems like a good idea.",
        "Harley: Yeah. I think they wanted it to be bigger, but I just... I said I couldn't.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, right, that makes sense. Um...",
        "Harley: Well, good night.",
        "Mallet: Good night. Hey.",
        "Dinah: How long is it going to take you?",
        "Mallet: To do what?",
        "Dinah: To get ready. We're going to go to Company.",
        "Mallet: No. No.",
        "Dinah: Why do you immediately say no?",
        "Mallet: Because it's for family, and we're not family.",
        "Dinah: I'm going to extend that definition to people who really care about Harley. And I think you fall into that category, don't you? Hey. I know you. You're the kind of guy that does everything right. Hurry up. We don't have a whole lot of time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I can't believe you're worried about the memorial service. If it weren't for Granddad, Gus would still be home safe and sound with your sister.",
        "Coop: Look, Gus had his part in that, too.",
        "Lizzie: Look, maybe I should just stay.",
        "Coop: Why?",
        "Lizzie: It's better.",
        "Coop: Better for who?",
        "Lizzie: I feel funny about going tonight. My family keeps hurting yours. It never ends.",
        "Coop: Stop. Stop. All right, look, you are not responsible for anybody else's actions. It doesn't matter what their last name is, you got that?",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Coop: You've proven yourself to be a really good person to all of us, especially me.",
        "Lizzie: I don't always feel like that.",
        "Coop: Come here. Who does, you know?",
        "Lizzie: Can I meet you later? I need a little more time.",
        "Coop: You are going to come, it's a sure thing. Look, are you sure about Alan's memorial service?",
        "Lizzie: I'm sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: When you need a cup of joe, I'm your man.",
        "Olivia: Okay, it may seem like a small thing to you, but not to you.",
        "Buzz: I also make a mean burger.",
        "Olivia: Listen to you. You are the nicest, most standup guy I know. So don't downplay it by trying to be funny.",
        "Buzz: Trying?",
        "Olivia: I'm just saying that we can be real with each other.",
        "Frank: Pop!",
        "Buzz: Frank!",
        "Frank: Olivia.",
        "Buzz: Keep her company, and I'll get your latte.",
        "Frank: Hi.",
        "Olivia: Hi, how are you? Your dad is just the greatest. I guess it runs in the family.",
        "Frank: That's what I've been told. I left you a message yesterday.",
        "Olivia: You did?",
        "Frank: Yeah. Well, obviously you didn't get it; that's all right.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you know, my voicemail's been acting up, but I look forward to hearing it.",
        "Zach: Ava!",
        "Ava: It's the boys! Hi, guys. How are you?",
        "Buzz: How you doing, kiddo?",
        "Harley: I'm fine. The place looks nice, Dad.",
        "Buzz: Well, I want it to look special for you.",
        "Harley: Just as long as it's not a memorial service. I just want normal.",
        "Buzz: I can do normal. I think we can do normal.",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Harley: Guys, let's get set up. Come on, I have your markers and your coloring books.",
        "Ava: I am all finished, so, um... have a good night. I'll see you later. Harley, I'll see you later. I'm going to go to a movie.",
        "Harley: Oh, Ava, don't feel like you have to go. Stay, eat with us.",
        "Ava: I don't want to impose. I didn't know your husband...",
        "Harley: Ava, just eat with us.",
        "Buzz: Where's Olivia?",
        "Frank: She had to go, Pop.",
        "Buzz: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Wait, I think they're here.",
        "Alan: Please, whoever you are, my son and I are hurt. We need help. I will pay you any amount of money that you think is fair. But, please, help us. Do you hear me? Ow! Ooh, God.",
        "Gus: You see what I'm trapped in here with. Do you see this? Do you see this? I've got to get out of here. I've got to get back to my life.",
        "Alan: Oh, man. The whole world thinks we're dead, Gus. I'm sure that they've found the car by now. What else could they think?",
        "Gus: Harley's not going to give up that easily.",
        "Alan: Harley's a practical woman. She has children. She's not going to fill them with false hope. I just hope they didn't give us a double funeral. What am I listening to?",
        "Alan: I'll bet Alexandra gave me a funeral, the kind of funeral I deserve. I just wish I could have been there, seen the celebrities, diplomats, CEO's of so many industries, perhaps even a president. Each of them making speeches, marking the loss of this great man.",
        "Gus: What great man? Who, you? You're not a great man. Ok you're a man who killed his son in cold blood. The most you're getting is a pine box buried in a pet cemetery.",
        "Alan: I think you should probably look around, because this is going to be our final resting spot, I'm afraid. Gus?",
        "Gus: Huh?",
        "Alan: After Harley's obligatory mourning period, who do you think she's going to turn to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What's your problem?",
        "Mallet: What? Harley doesn't want me to go.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about? We're not the general public; we're her friends. Come on, get ready.",
        "Mallet: You just don't get it.",
        "Dinah: No, you don't get it. It's obvious that you don't want to go to Company, and there's a reason. I know what it is.",
        "Mallet: It's not that I don't want to go...",
        "Dinah: Mallet, it's okay. It's cool.",
        "Mallet: It is? I mean, it is?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, look, you don't want to go as much as Harley doesn't want to call it a memorial. But you have to say goodbye; you have to grieve. And whether Harley wants to or not, both of you have to move on. That goes for both of you.",
        "Mallet: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Alexandra, isn't Alan's memorial about to start?",
        "Alexandra: Olivia, do yourself a favor and just keep walking.",
        "Olivia: Fine. Aren't you going?",
        "Alexandra: Why should you care?",
        "Olivia: Well, I just thought that if we were walking in the same direction, we could walk together.",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs ) You're going to Alan's memorial?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Alexandra: You think so?",
        "Olivia: Yes, I'm going. I'm going.",
        "Alexandra: What for? There's nothing in it for you there.",
        "Olivia: Why aren't you at the church?",
        "Alexandra: Because I just don't want to go in there alone.",
        "Olivia: What are you talking about? You have family.",
        "Alexandra: Alan was it. He was my worst enemy, my best friend, and I'm just not ready to say goodbye yet.",
        "Olivia: I actually feel the same way sometimes.",
        "Alexandra: Come on, don't humor me, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: I'm not. You probably don't believe this, but I do care about Alan. He picked me up when I was at my lowest, and I will always be grateful to him for that. I need to say goodbye to him, you know. I think you do, too. You know, listen. Um... we could go together. Nobody has to know. Ok.",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Mom, this is like the 50th message that I've left you. Where are you? Look, I need to talk to you about Granddad and his... Quinn, what are you doing here?",
        "Quinn: I hate to say this, but get dressed. I'm taking you to your Grandfather's shindig.",
        "Lizzie: If you had called first, I'd have told you I'm not going.",
        "Quinn: Why? It's going to be a scene. Plus, you look great in black.",
        "Lizzie: I don't think I remember hearing you knock.",
        "Quinn: We've been over this. I own the apartment.",
        "Lizzie: What if Coop was here?",
        "Quinn: Give me some credit, Lizzie. I was downstairs when the waiter left.",
        "Lizzie: You just happened to be downstairs chatting up the doorman?",
        "Quinn: Well, I was concerned about you.",
        "Lizzie: Save it for someone else's girlfriend.",
        "Quinn: I'll chalk that up to your grief.",
        "Lizzie: You do that. Look, you've got to go. I've wasted enough time as it is.",
        "Quinn: You are in a bad state. Come here, sweetheart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Where's Lizzie?",
        "Coop: She's on her way over. Actually, she's really excited about being here tonight.",
        "Harley: Look, there's nothing for her to be here for. It's just a dinner. That's it, that's it.",
        "Coop: Okay, gotcha.",
        "Harley: Okay, I'm going to help Marina in the kitchen.",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Ava: Hey.",
        "Coop: What have we got?",
        "Ava: I wasn't going to stay. Harley wouldn't take no for an answer.",
        "Coop: As well they shouldn't have. You're practically part of the family by now.",
        "Frank: Thanks, Pop. We're closed.",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm not here to eat. I'm here to pick up Marina.",
        "Frank: Well, I'm sure she forgot to call and cancel.",
        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hi. Did you forget about tonight?",
        "Marina: The Spaulding Valentine's Day party. I'm so sorry. I totally forgot.",
        "Alan-Michael: Don't worry. Just go get dressed; there's still plenty of time.",
        "Marina: Actually, I can't. We're kind of doing this thing for Harley.",
        "Harley: There's no thing for Harley. There is no such thing. This family's so forgetful.",
        "Alan-Michael: Did you forget, too?",
        "Harley: Oh, that. No, I was just about to call you and ask you if you would go in my place. Do you mind?",
        "Alan-Michael: Not at all.",
        "Harley: Go have fun. You can be the family representative.",
        "Alan-Michael: If you want to beg off, I'll understand.",
        "Marina: No, I should just stick around here for a little bit.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, call me if you want me to send a car.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Harley: Hey, what's up?",
        "Zach: Look, Mommy, it's Gus in heaven. See?",
        "Harley: Yes, I see.",
        "Zach: Do you think he's happy?",
        "Harley: I'm sure he's happy. Uh-huh. That is such a good picture. I mean, look at these clouds here. They look so real. They look like cotton. I'm so proud of you. You are such a good artist. Would you do me a favor?",
        "Zach: Uh-huh.",
        "Harley: I remember that I left my lights on outside. Would you run to the kitchen and keep an eye on Jude for me? Thanks, baby. Damn it, damn it. (Breathing heavily )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: What are you doing?",
        "Gus: I'm doing the same thing I was doing before. I'm looking for a way out of this place.",
        "Alan: There's no way out of here. The doors are locked; there are no windows. We're at the mercy of the person who brought us here. Ok what's so fascinating about...",
        "Gus: This thing's been staring us in the face the whole time. Look at it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I'm sorry. We're not open. So, uh...",
        "Beth: Harley, I am so sorry.",

        "Crystal Chappell, inside \"The Light.\" Olivia is this lovely mess of a person. She's not so different than most people. She has a void in her, and she's searching for something to fill it. It just happens to be all of the wrong things. See Olivia Wednesday, February 15, inside \"The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Isn't Alan's memorial service tonight?",
        "Beth: Yes, yes, I'm going over there after this, but I... I just had to see you.",
        "Harley: Me? Why?",
        "Beth: Harley, I, um...",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Beth: I feel like we share something.",
        "Harley: Oh, Beth, I don't know about that.",
        "Beth: No, don't get me wrong, Harley. I would never compare your relationship to Gus with mine to Alan. But he was my husband.",
        "Harley: Was he, Beth? I mean, was he really?",
        "Beth: Yes. Okay, I know that everybody thinks it was just a business transaction, but it wasn't completely devoid of feeling, and I can't help thinking that if things had just gone another way, who knows?",
        "Harley: Yes. Well, then I'm sorry for you too.",
        "Beth: Thank you.",
        "Harley: And you know what, Beth? Whatever happened between us, I don't even care anymore. You know, Alan was using you...",
        "Beth: No, I didn't say that.",
        "Harley: And he's gone. He's gone, so he has no control over you anymore.",
        "Beth: He wasn't controlling me. I have the power.",
        "Harley: Oh. Anyway, um... I feel bad about that whole, you know, ousting you from Spaulding thing. It got really ugly. So I was thinking I want to give you another chance.",
        "Beth: Really?",
        "Harley: Yeah. Yeah. There's an opening in PR. I mean, it's not a CEO position or anything, but, hey, it will get you back in.",
        "Beth: Harley, I don't know what to say. I... I really appreciate this.",
        "Harley: Sure. And, you know, Beth, I guess... I guess we really do share something. And it's not... it's not just the loss. It's the not knowing, you know? It's... it's the doubts and the questions. That's what... that's what we share. That's what we share. Beth, you're the only other person who can understand that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: What... what do you think it is?",
        "Gus: A long time ago this used to be a window. I think.",
        "Alan: Well, it looks like it's been covered with...",
        "Gus: Yeah, or just painted. See what I'm saying?",
        "Alan: Wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no. If you manage to get out, how do I know that you'll come back for me?",
        "Gus: You don't. ( Laughs ) I'm just kidding. Will you lighten up?",
        "Alan: You kidnapped me to lock me away, and I'm definitely locked away.",
        "Gus: Listen, I said I would do it. If I say I'm going to do something, I do it, unlike you. So if I get out of here, I'll take you with me, okay?",
        "Alan: I'll hold you to your word.",
        "Gus: Right. Get up. Let's move this bed.",

        "Lizzie: Quinn, the best way you can help me is to leave.",
        "Quinn: You know, every time you push me away, it stings, Lizzie. In fact, it stings so much it makes me want to take back my apartment.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not pushing you away. I'm just... I'm late.",
        "Quinn: Let me guess... Coop?",
        "Lizzie: They're having a thing down at Company.",
        "Quinn: For you?",
        "Lizzie: No, for Harley. My Uncle Gus...",
        "Quinn: Her husband. Yeah, yeah, I know. Coop takes you for granted, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: No, no...",
        "Quinn: Yes. Coop just doesn't get you, not like I get you. I mean, I understand you, your history, what you want out of life. I'm the one who gave you all of this because you wanted it. And I kept quiet about it, too, because that's what you wanted.",
        "Lizzie: And I appreciate that, so much. You know that I do.",
        "Quinn: Do I?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. We're all getting what we want here, right? Oh. Oops. Hey, I really wish I had more time.",
        "Quinn: Lizzie!",
        "Lizzie: It's just that Coop's waiting.",
        "Quinn: Coop. I'm getting very, very tired of Coop.",

        "Coop: Lizzie should have been here by now.",
        "Ava: I'm sure she's fine.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I don't know about that. She was pretty upset about her grandfather earlier. You know, I think I'm going to run by the apartment just to check and see if she's still there. Could you do me a favor and just cover for me?",
        "Ava: Sure.",

        "Harley: Oh, yeah, I was going to show that to you. It's good, isn't it? Oh, Daddy, what the hell is wrong with me? You know, my son is sitting here trying to figure out what happened to Gus. He's trying to figure out why yet another person has left him. And I tell him that he draws really cool clouds. You know, he's trying to figure this out, and I'm not doing anything to help him.",
        "Buzz: You're doing what you can do. You're being strong.",
        "Harley: I don't want to be strong anymore, okay? Help me. I don't know!",

        "Harley: I'm a fast runner.",
        "Buzz: You're the tough one in this family; you are. But you can relinquish that title for a while, okay? Look, the man you love is gone. It's okay to act like it. It's okay.",
        "Harley: Well, how do I start? What does that mean?",
        "Buzz: Just start.",
        "Frank: Okay. Oh, good, good, good. Hey, shall we eat?",
        "Harley: Let's eat.",
        "Frank: Good. Good, good, good.",
        "Harley: To Gus. Yeah, for some bizarre reason, he always enjoyed these intimate family dinners, and I think he would be happy to know that we were thinking of him in this way.",

        "Alexandra: Good. Shall we?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'll catch up in a minute.",
        "Harley: Of course he breaks the chair. ( Laughter ) And then he tries to blame me for breaking the chair. And I wasn't anywhere near that chair, I swear. And he does what we all hate, because he can't stand the humiliation. He goes, and Gus gets the toolbox. ( Laughter ) You can't tell him he doesn't know what he's doing.",
        "Mallet: Hi, folks. I know this is a private night, but, well, this is important.",
