        "Holly: Well, I'll just leave it.",
        "Voice: I'm still here, Reva. Yes, it's me. I know you hear me. I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere. Someone has to remind you of what you did. Do you hear me, Reva? Oh, no, no, no, no. It's not going to be that easy. You did it, and you'll pay. Oh, keep trying, Reva. (laughs) Give up, Reva. You can't make me go away. I'm here. I'm everywhere. And I'll be here till you pay for what you did. And you'll pay. And you'll pay. And you'll pay! (laughs).",

        "Ed: Michelle? Michelle?",
        "Michelle: Oh. Hey, Dad, what are you doing here?",
        "Ed: We talked about this, remember? Holly's coming over.",
        "Michelle: Right, right, right. Well, where is she?",
        "Ed: She'll be here any second.",
        "Michelle: Okay. What do you think I should say to her?",
        "Ed: Well, I was hoping that you'd, you know, basically tell her what you told me; that you came down the stairs, and you saw her baby-sitting for Robbie, and it just surprised you, and you went over the edge.",
        "Michelle: Right, right, right. Well, because of Carmen, because of the whole Santos nightmare that just... won't go away. (laughter)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Thanks, dear.",
        "Beth: What's wrong with this picture?",
        "Rick: Well, I think you forgot to give me a muffin to go with my cup of coffee. Mm. Hey, how about that letter your daughter sent me from school?",
        "Beth: I can't believe she actually wrote you a letter. All I get are emails and phone calls.",
        "Rick: That's because she knows that I appreciate the rude, obnoxious pictures that she draws of her professors. (laughter)",
        "Beth: You two do have that special teenage bond, don't you?",
        "Rick: Yes, we do. (knock at the door)",
        "Frank: Hey, buddy.",
        "Rick: Hey. Just in time for some coffee, Frank.",

        "Beth: Frank.",
        "Frank: Well, well, well, isn't this just interesting?",
        "Beth: It's not what you think, believe me.",
        "Frank: Mm.",
        "Rick: What does he think?",
        "Frank: Beth, honestly, just, you know, straight from the hip. No.",
        "Frank: Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. I can see the writing on the wall here. First, it was Phillip Spaulding, and then Prince Edmund, and now Dr. Rick Bauer. I could totally understand why you wouldn't want to go out with a poor tired, old cop like me.",
        "Beth: Oh, you found me out. (laughter)",
        "Frank: There is one thing, however. He is married.",
        "Rick: Yep.",
        "Beth: You are?",
        "Rick: Mm-hm.",
        "Beth: You cad.",
        "Rick: I waited my whole life to be called that. So what's going on here?",
        "Frank: Anyway, you know what? If you guys have something going on here, please don't let me get in the middle of it, because... hey, I'll tell you what. I'll just turn my cheek the other way and go after Mel. Speaking of which, is she around here? I haven't seen her. Mel?",
        "Rick: You're so sick. (laughter) You're sick, man. She's at work. And I'm sure she'll be very happy that you said that. So what's going on here?",
        "Beth: I'll let Frank fill you in. I have to get going. See you, Detective.",
        "Frank: I love it when you say that.",
        "Beth: (laughs) Bye-bye.",

        "Phillip: Harley, Zach will be fine until I get there. Yeah, just go ahead and do what you need to do. Okay. Bye.",
        "Alan: Phillip, we need to talk.",
        "Phillip: Not today, we don't.",
        "Alan: Oh, yes, today.",
        "Phillip: Nope. I'm going to the hospital to see my son.",
        "Alan: There is a very important board meeting coming up, and it will be our chance to get back what Alexandra stole from us.",
        "Phillip: Well, you know what? As far as I'm concerned, Dad, I don't care. She can keep it all.",
        "Alan: You will never learn, will you?",
        "Phillip: No. Actually, Dad, you know, I learned a long time ago.",
        "Alan: Don't you realize that our future is on the line? Your children's future, their children's future.",
        "Phillip: You go ahead and take care of it. Just do whatever you want to do. At the moment, I don't give a damn.",
        "Alan: Do whatever I want to do?",
        "Phillip: You heard me. I have to go. Bye. I'm sorry. Are you...",
        "Alan: She's here to see me. Give Zach a hug for me, will you? You can go, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Well, I don't want to be rude. Don't you want to introduce me to your friend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Dr. Sedwick, I was told I could find you in here.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Yes, just today. They're painting my office. Come on in. Sit down.",
        "Olivia: What's this about? Should I be concerned?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry if I alarmed you. It's just that there's certain kind of news that I like to deliver in person.",
        "Olivia: What kind of news?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Well, congratulations, Olivia. You're pregnant.",
        "Olivia: Pregnant? No, that's impossible. I... I take the pill.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: No, I ran the test twice just to make sure. It's not the end of the world, you know. A lot of couples have babies, but...",
        "Olivia: No, I can't. I can't have a baby. I can't.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Look, I know how you feel. It's unexpected. But once you talk it over with your husband...",
        "Olivia: No, no. Listen. Maybe if you take another sample and do the test again, you'll get a different result, because it's just the wrong time for all of us.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: All of us?",
        "Olivia: I have to leave here and meet my husband and his attorney about a divorce.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh, I see.",
        "Olivia: No. No, you don't. There is a very good chance that this baby might not even be his.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh.",
        "Olivia: Are you sure?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Yes, according to our tests, you are pregnant. But, Olivia, there are options. I mean, if you decide you don't want to go through with this, I know this is your first pregnancy, so there...",
        "Olivia: I never thought there would be a pregnancy. I practically set my alarm by these things. I mean, I took a pill at the same time every day. I was so careful!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I will be happy to introduce you to my friend. She is an attorney who's here to help us plan our board meeting. Now, if you would like to sit down with us, you're more than welcome, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: No, no, no. That's okay. That's all right. Have a pleasant afternoon, both of you. Oh, no, Alan's in there. Turn around, go back the way you came.",
        "Beth: Oh, well, actually I was just here to pick up some more of James' winter clothes and to see how Zach was doing.",
        "Phillip: Well, I'm actually on my way over to the hospital now to see him. You want to ride with me?",
        "Beth: I... I hadn't really planned...",
        "Phillip: I'll be charming the whole way. I promise.",
        "Beth: This I've got to see.",
        "Phillip: I can still be charming.",
        "Beth: (laughs)",
        "Phillip: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: How dare you come here unannounced.",
        "Monica: You never returned my messages, so...",
        "Alan: You might as well enter with a sign announcing \"Monica Parker, Private Investigator.\"",
        "Monica: I just wanted to make sure I was clear with what you wanted me to do with this doctor.",
        "Alan: It's very simple. All I want you to do is make an appointment with my wife's doctor and see whatever you can come up with.",
        "Monica: What am I looking for? I...",
        "Alan: Olivia had a checkup yesterday, and I have a hunch there's something in her file that I should know about.",
        "Monica: A hunch? Birth control pills-- the ones I had replaced with placebos.",
        "Alan: Yes, those happy little pills. Now, get on over there and do whatever you have to do to get your hands on that file. Stuart, it's Alan. I just want to make sure that we have an appointment later on today. Good. Yes, Olivia will be here. And I want to make sure that that divorce settlement is very generous. Promise her the moon, because I'm betting there's no way she will sign it. No, Phillip will not be at the board meeting. I will be in complete control. Yes, everything is going exactly the way I planned it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Well, Frank, I'm proud of you, buddy. I'm proud of you. You put yourself out in the world again. That's great.",
        "Frank: Oh, Rick, I took a chance, you know. I asked a beautiful woman out for a date, and she turned me down flat.",
        "Rick: Frank, it is the story of my life. Except for me, it's just a little different twist. Usually they look past me to Phillip and say, \"Excuse me, but who's your sexy friend?\" (laughter)",
        "Frank: Well, Mel's crazy about you.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Frank, I keep telling you what the secret is here. You have to marry them when your life is a full-blown crisis. It works every single time.",
        "Frank: How are things between the two of you? I mean, is everything all right?",
        "Rick: Oh, Frank...",
        "Frank: Still in that honeymoon phase?",
        "Rick: Man, it is so perfect that it scares me sometimes.",
        "Frank: Well, don't let it scare you. You should be happy. God, man, help me find a woman like that, will you?",
        "Rick: I'm trying. I'm trying, Frankie.",
        "Frank: Anyway, I've got to get out of here. I got to go check in on the Lewis'.",
        "Rick: Oh, well, listen, if you want to get rejected again, you can ask Reva out. (laughs)",
        "Frank: She's got a lot on her plate right now.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Sorry, I didn't mean it.",
        "Frank: Thanks for the coffee.",
        "Rick: You're welcome.",
        "Frank: And Rick, if you know of any single hot nurses, call me, will you?",
        "Rick: I'll try, Frankie. Yeah, yeah. (knock at the door)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Who is it? Who's there? I asked who was there? (sighs) Talk about the heebie-jeebies.",
        "Blake: Hey.",
        "Reva: (gasp) Oh, my.",
        "Blake: Oh, sorry.",
        "Reva: You scared me to death.",
        "Blake: I'm sorry. I knocked and you didn't answer, so I went around the backyard to see if you were there.",
        "Reva: Oh, that was you?",
        "Blake: Yeah. Why?",
        "Reva: Well, I thought maybe it might be the guy who was delivering these.",
        "Blake: Oh. No, actually these were hanging here when I got here.",
        "Reva: Did you see a delivery van?",
        "Blake: No, but I wasn't looking.",
        "Reva: Well, I didn't hear anybody knock before.",
        "Blake: Well, maybe you were busy. You just didn't hear it.",
        "Reva: Usually Mr. Lee rings again if I don't answer right away, or he comes back later.",
        "Blake: So he has a lazy delivery boy.",
        "Reva: Yeah, probably so.",
        "Blake: Okay.",
        "Reva: Come on in. What?",
        "Blake: Oh, my God. Who would smear blood all over your clothes, Reva?",
        "Reva: Blake, keep your voice down.",
        "Blake: Why? What do you think, somebody else is out here?",
        "Reva: I don't know. Come on inside.",
        "Blake: What?",
        "Reva: Come on. Watch it.",
        "Blake: You know, Reva, why don't you check it and make sure maybe some delivery boy spilled something else on it. (knock at the door)",
        "Blake: Don't answer that.",
        "Reva: No, but Frank put a policeman on the house, so if the guy's out there, somewhere then maybe they've caught him.",
        "Frank: Reva, it's Frank. Are you in there?",
        "Reva: Oh, it's Frank. Frank, Frank. Frank, I was just calling you.",
        "Frank: Reva, did you see anyone?",
        "Reva: No, I didn't. No.",
        "Blake: Frank, that was hanging here when I got here.",
        "Frank: How long have you been home?",
        "Reva: Long enough to know there isn't anyone inside.",
        "Frank: Okay. You ladies, stay put.",
        "Blake: Wait a minute. Where are you going?",
        "Frank: Don't touch anything. Well, I've got a man placed in front there watching Reva's house all morning long. He called and told me that the dry cleaning, somebody dropped it off.",
        "Blake: Why?",
        "Frank: Would you please relax?",
        "Reva: Yes, I will. Come on.",
        "Blake: All right. What... what the hell is going on here, Reva?",
        "Reva: Someone has been making threatening phone calls. They actually broke into the house and stole one of the family photographs.",
        "Blake: Someone broke into your house?",
        "Reva: Yeah. And the sad thing is, is that we thought that they got the guy. They traced a call, and they arrested someone, and as far as we were concerned, it was over. And then I saw lipstick on the wall.",
        "Blake: What?",
        "Reva: Lipstick on the wall in the study. There was a message: \"I'm still here.\" So frank put the house under surveillance again. But a lot of good it's doing, as you can see.",
        "Blake: Well, maybe this guy had a partner.",
        "Reva: I don't think so, because the guy they arrested has severe emotional problems, and has been known to do this kind of thing before. In fact, he as much as confessed to most of the calls.",
        "Blake: Well, then... then so this means it has to be somebody who's just jumped on the bandwagon.",
        "Reva: You mean, a copycat? I don't know. If it is, then it's someone we know, because it hasn't been in the newspapers. No one even barely knows that this is going on.",
        "Blake: Now I'm freaked.",
        "Reva: Tell me about it.",
        "Blake: Do you know who would do this, Reva?",
        "Reva: If I knew the answer to that, Blake, then... Frank?",
        "Frank: Reva, this is Officer Tucker. He's been watching your house all morning. He said everything was pretty quiet until about an hour ago when someone dropped off the dry cleaning.",
        "Officer Tucker: I didn't know what it was at first\u0097just a bag.",
        "Reva: Well, did you see an Asian man in a delivery van?",
        "Frank: No, actually it was a woman. Holly Reade.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: Okay. Now, the doc said you got to keep your energy up, so do your old dad a favor and eat some of this, pal. Oh, come on, just try it. You don't want to try it? Okay. Hey, I don't care. Because you know what? I love this stuff. It just means there's more for me. Mm. Boy, that's delicious. Mm. Boy, that's good. Mm. Are you sure? Are you sure you don't want try some of this? I'm going to eat it all if you don't eat it.",
        "Beth: Okay, Phillip. I've witnessed enough of this pathetic display. Let a pro do the work. (sighs) Look at that. You got chocolate pudding here. I didn't realize that. Wow!",
        "Phillip: That's good.",
        "Beth: I love... watch and learn. How about a little... oh, that's a lot. How about a little bit of this? You want some, hon? Good guy. And you know something, how about we try a little bit of this with a little bit of chocolate pudding? You want to try that?",
        "Phillip: Oh, I see where we're going.",
        "Beth: Huh? See, see? Mm.",
        "Phillip: Lady, you're good.",
        "Beth: You like this? Yeah, I should be after two picky eaters.",
        "Phillip: I remember Lizzie being picky. Was James?",
        "Beth: Oh, James. James was worse. But don't worry, you haven't lost your memory. You just weren't around too much during that picky eater stage.",
        "Phillip: I guess I wasn't around too much when either of my sons were babies. Funny, I was sure I was going to be so much better than...",
        "Beth: Than your dad.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Did I tell you I'm moving out of the house?",
        "Beth: Again.",
        "Phillip: Well, no, last time I stayed because Lizzie wanted to stay. She sort of talked me into it. But now that she's at boarding school, I figure I can miss her from anywhere.",
        "Beth: Yeah. I miss her, too.",
        "Phillip: It's not fair. Why did she have to grow up? Next, there's going to be college, and then she's going to be gone for good. Seems like... seems like yesterday that we were in Arizona.",
        "Beth: We're getting old, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. At least you don't look like it.",
        "Beth: I was kidding.",
        "Phillip: I'm not. I feel old. I must be. It takes time to get this stupid. I've been worrying about all the wrong things. I've been letting what's important just pass me by. I don't want to do that. I don't want to make the same mistakes with Zach and James. I want to spend all the time that I can with them.",
        "Beth: Well, good for you, and for them.",
        "Phillip: I guess. You know, almost losing him and Lizzie, if that... if that doesn't make you think and make you want to change things, then nothing will. And I'll tell you, Alan has one thing right.",
        "Beth: Oh. Oh, I better get a piece of paper and write this down.",
        "Phillip: No, he's always saying how nothing is more important than family, especially your kids. And he's right. He just doesn't know how to carry through on that.",
        "Beth: But you do.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I do. My kids come first. End of story, period.",

        "Olivia: Well, so much for birth control.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Well, no method is 100% effective.",
        "Olivia: Could the... could the pills have hurt the baby?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh, no. No, I'll run some tests. But I'm sure both of you are fine.",
        "Olivia: Oh. Well, I guess I'll have to change some habits. You know, I'll have to start taking vitamins instead of these.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Do you mind if I hang on to these?",

        "Michelle: Oh, Holly, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I just haven't been myself since Carmen tried to kidnap Robbie. And I saw you baby-sitting, and it's like I saw her, and I just lost it. And I really wish it never happened.",
        "Holly: So do I.",
        "Ed: Well, look it's good that you two didn't let this turn into something bigger than it really is, you know?",
        "Holly: I want you to know I understand exactly why you reacted the way you did. You weren't here when I was drinking, and I... I'm lucky anybody in this town speaks to me.",
        "Ed: Oh, come on. You made some mistakes. Who hasn't?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, and Fletcher took Meg. I mean, you had a sort of a breakdown. I understand.",
        "Ed: It was a horrible time for you. But it's over. I mean, you're recovering. You're never going to do anything like that again. Don't...",
        "Michelle: Holly, it was really about my experiences with Carmen. I'm just still so freaked about everything that happened to me when I was a Santos. It's going to take me a while to calm down.",

        "Cassie: You know, we can go somewhere else.",
        "Danny: No, you stay right where you are. No, I want her to see me everywhere-- in the restaurants she's eating in, in the stores she shops. Hell, even in her dreams. I don't want her forgetting me or what we had.",

        "Ed: How about you and Bill? Can you make it?",
        "Michelle: Oh. I'll be right back. Hang on. Hi.",
        "Danny: Hi.",
        "Michelle: You and Cassie look pretty busy over there.",
        "Danny: Well, yeah, we're working on a big project together.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, Bill told me.",
        "Danny: Oh, right, so you know. Can you tell Bill to get in touch with me and call me as soon as possible?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, sure. So...",
        "Danny: I need his answer.",
        "Michelle: You and Cassie are partners?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I guess you can call it that. I'm late. I've got to go. I'll see you.",
        "Michelle: There's something I have to take care of. Can we get together another time? Is that okay?",
        "Holly: Sure.",
        "Ed: Yeah, sure. Okay, honey.",
        "Michelle: Thanks. Bye.",
        "Holly: I'm so glad we're okay.",
        "Michelle: Of course we are. Bye-bye.",
        "Ed: Bye. I guess that went well, right?",
        "Holly: Thanks to you.",
        "Ed: That's right. You owe me, don't you? You owe me big-time.",
        "Cop: Holly Reade?",
        "Holly: Yes?",
        "Cop: Could you come with me?",
        "Ed: Is there a problem?",
        "Cop: We just need to ask Miss Reade some questions.",
        "Holly: Oh, what about?",
        "Cop: Sorry, I was just asked to bring you in.",
        "Ed: To bring her in?",
        "Holly: (laughs)",
        "Cop: She's not under arrest.",
        "Holly: Oh, I double-parked. I'll be right back.",
        "Ed: Can I have the check, please?",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Ed: Hey.",
        "Cassie: Is Holly in trouble?",
        "Ed: I don't think so. I hope not.",
        "Cassie: Are you going to go with her?",
        "Ed: I'm going to pay the check first.",
        "Cassie: Right. (laughs)",
        "Ed: Okay. How are you?",
        "Cassie: I'm good. Why?",
        "Ed: Well, just... you and Danny sitting over there.",
        "Cassie: Oh, you mean my new business partner. Yes. We are joining together and buying the Towers club. Hopefully it'll be the hottest spot in town. So we'll see.",
        "Ed: Well, that's great.",
        "Cassie: Well, you're a friend, so you'll never have to wait for a seat.",
        "Ed: Oh, thank goodness. I was really worried about that.",
        "Cassie: (laughs)",
        "Ed: No, that's good for you and Danny. I hope it works out. He needs something to keep himself occupied.",
        "Cassie: And away from Michelle.",
        "Ed: (laughs) Yeah.",
        "Cassie: I thought you liked Danny, Ed?",
        "Ed: I do. I just hope next time Michelle gets involved with someone safer.",
        "Cassie: He's a great guy. I mean, Danny is really a great guy.",
        "Ed: Don't tell me. What?",
        "Cassie: Don't tell you what?",
        "Ed: Thanks. Nothing. I just... you and Danny, it's... I'll see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Hey, you left so fast I didn't get a chance to talk to you about Robbie about his schedule, you know, because you missed your day this week because Bill picked him. So I thought maybe you'd want to spend Thursday with him?",
        "Danny: Well, yeah, I thought that's what we said, that we'd switch days this week.",
        "Michelle: Okay. So are these your plans for Towers?",
        "Danny: Uh-huh. Well, they're more like sketches. Cassie has got so many ideas. We haven't finalized yet which ones work the best.",
        "Michelle: But you made it legit, your partnership with Cassie? You guys are officially a team?",
        "Danny: I guess you can call it that. What? Is there a problem?",
        "Michelle: No. I didn't say that. No.",
        "Danny: Michelle, Cassie and I are just business partners. That's pretty much it.",
        "Michelle: I am not asking for an explanation, whatever it is.",
        "Danny: Really? Seems to me like that's exactly what you're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: This looks all very good, Stuart.",
        "Olivia: I'm very sorry that I'm late. I got caught up, and I couldn't really help...",
        "Alan: No explanation needed, Olivia. You know Stuart Randall.",
        "Olivia: Yes, I do. Hello.",
        "Stuart: Mrs. Spaulding.",
        "Alan: Well, let's sit down. Stuart, why don't you show her the papers that we've drawn up?",
        "Olivia: Papers? But we only just started this yesterday, Alan.",
        "Stuart: This is only a preliminary draft.",
        "Olivia: I know. I just thought that maybe we could talk about something and...",
        "Alan: Just look it over.",
        "Olivia: Alan, this is much too generous.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm sure you'll have some counterproposals.",
        "Olivia: I did. I just didn't expect anything so complete. You know, I thought that I... why are you being so reasonable?",
        "Alan: I don't want a long, drawn-out fight where we hurt each other, Olivia. You know, I'm not happy about this. But you are my wife, and I want to make sure that you are treated fairly.",
        "Olivia: Alan, this is more than fair.",
        "Alan: The prenup is null and void. This is very simple. There are no children, no custody battles. This is not what I want. You know my feelings. If you change your mind, I'll be happy to tear this up.",
        "Olivia: Alan, I...",
        "Alan: Yes?",
        "Olivia: I have a meeting that I forgot about, and I really need to get to it. So could we go over this some other time?",
        "Alan: Oh, sure, sure. Take as much time as you need.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Thank you. Thanks.",
        "Alan: What did I tell you? She's on her way back. And soon we will be together forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: I think you got the wrong idea. I didn't come over here to give you the third degree or to pry into whatever it is you're doing with Cassie.",
        "Danny: Whatever it is I'm doing?",
        "Michelle: \"Doing,\" as in the project that you're working on. I mean, I'm naturally a little curious.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, I'm still trying to figure out if I can afford it. But if I can, this would be a really great opportunity for me. It would mean that I'm no longer tied to Infierno or the past. Towers would be 100% legitimate.",
        "Michelle: Along with Cassie.",
        "Danny: Well, Michelle, Cassie has a solid reputation. She's co-owner of the Beacon, which is very successful. That's why I decided to throw in with her.",
        "Michelle: Right. And your reputation is anything but solid. So why did she decide to throw in with you?",
        "Danny: Well, I don't know, Michelle. I guess you'll have to ask her.",
        "Michelle: Maybe I will. I just think it's odd, that's all.",
        "Danny: Odd? What?",
        "Michelle: Cassie has a business of her own. She's got three children without a father to raise. I would think her plate would be a little bit full.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: Just wondering if maybe you chose the right partner.",
        "Danny: Hmm.",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Danny: You're jealous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Blood all over the clothes? How is this possible?",
        "Reva: Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.",
        "Frank: Holly, one of my officers saw you dropping off the dry cleaning at Reva's front door.",
        "Holly: I was there. I was at the dry cleaners. I saw your name on a bag, so I thought I'd drop it off, do you a favor.",
        "Blake: Well, that makes sense.",
        "Holly: I hung it by the door.",
        "Reva: Did you knock?",
        "Holly: Yeah, a couple of times. There was no answer, so I hung it there and I left. I was on my way to Company.",
        "Frank: Any chance that the clothes were smeared before you picked them up?",
        "Holly: I think I would have noticed. No, a clerk at the dry cleaner checked the bag to make sure everything was there.",
        "Frank: Okay.",
        "Holly: The clothes were fine.",
        "Frank: So hold on. Then in your opinion, something must have happened to the clothes between the time that you picked them up and then dropped them off at Reva's door, correct?",
        "Holly: Yeah, that must be it.",
        "Frank: Tucker, did you see anything else this morning?",
        "Officer Tucker: The mailman just doing his job, it looked like to me.",
        "Holly: So you were watching the front of the house all day long?",
        "Officer Tucker: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Blake: And you didn't... you never took a break? I mean, because that's all it would take, just to look away for just a minute.",
        "Frank: Blake, no one's saying anything here.",
        "Blake: Well, they have to, Frank, because I know where you're going with this line of questioning.",
        "Frank: I'm just trying to establish some facts, that's all.",
        "Blake: No. You're asking these questions, because you can't forget about what happened with Holly and those kids.",
        "Holly: Blake!",
        "Blake: That was a long time ago, Frank.",
        "Holly: Please...",
        "Blake: She was a completely different person. My God, she was drinking then.",
        "Holly: That's enough.",
        "Blake: She had just lost Meg and Fletcher. Frank, she's been sober for years.",
        "Frank: Holly, I'm sorry. But you know I have to ask these questions, right? Now, how have things been going with you? Everything okay at work? Your life's okay?",
        "Holly: Everything is fine. I'm fine. This is really ridiculous. All I did was drop off the dry cleaning.",
        "Blake: Oh, for God's sake, could you just do something and make this all go away, please?",
        "Reva: All I want is what Frank wants. I want the person who did this to admit it, so that my family can live in peace again. I won't prosecute.",
        "Holly: My, God, Reva, you think it, too. You think I could have done that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Jealous, huh? You think that I'm jealous? Mm.",
        "Danny: Well, I don't know, Michelle. Why else did you come here and launch into that rather judgmental speech about my new business? I mean, you're not focused on Towers, or the fact that I'm selling Millennium and Infierno. You're focused on who I choose to go into business with.",
        "Michelle: Boy, you've got a big head, I'll give you that.",
        "Danny: I'm...",
        "Michelle: Just because I have questions, legitimate questions, doesn't mean that I'm jealous.",
        "Danny: All right. Michelle, you can have all the questions you want. I'm just saying that questions imply interests-- interests that you're not necessarily entitled to. I mean, you've been so quick to point out to me that we're divorced now, and that our day-to-day affairs really aren't each other's concern. Right? Am I wrong?",
        "Michelle: You drive me crazy!",
        "Danny: I do?",
        "Michelle: Yes.",
        "Danny: Really. What am I doing?",
        "Michelle: Just stop it, okay?",
        "Danny: What? Stop what?",
        "Michelle: I don't even know why I brought any of it up to begin with. Good luck with your new venture and your new partner. Good luck, period.",
        "Danny: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: No, I don't think you did this. You're a friend. I mean, why would you? It's just...",
        "Holly: Just what?",
        "Reva: They have clues and evidence. Holly, when you had your problem before, did you have lapses of memory or blackouts, or anything like that?",
        "Holly: No.",
        "Frank: Hold on one second. Reva's got something here. Holly, have you ever done anything that you've had no recollection of?",
        "Blake: Don't answer that? Are you charging my mother, Frank?",
        "Frank: Blake, what are you doing here? No, of course I'm not doing that right now.",
        "Blake: Okay, fine. Then we have nothing more to say to you, or to you-- especially to you. Not until we've talked to Ross.",
        "Holly: You were really upset when I had to put your show on hiatus after Richard died. You know, I just did that to protect you.",
        "Reva: I know you did.",
        "Holly: Then how could you believe this of me? How?",
        "Reva: I don't believe it, Holly. Holly, wait.",
        "Frank: Reva, I'm sorry. This did not go the way I planned.",
        "Reva: You're sorry.",
        "Frank: Are you all right?",
        "Reva: Don't ask me that until you catch this creep.",
        "Frank: Okay. And what happens if it ends up being a friend of yours?",

        "Monica: For the daddy-to-be.",

        "Monica: Dr. Sedwick practically handed me your wife's file.",
        "Alan: Really? Well, remind me to send her some flowers. You know, I played this just right. Olivia will never sign that divorce settlement, no matter how lucrative it is.",
        "Monica: You went ahead before you even knew?",
        "Alan: I knew. And you just confirmed what I always knew. So now all you have to do is send me a bill, because you're fired.",
        "Monica: Fired? But why?",
        "Alan: Phillip saw you. I can't risk using you anymore.",
        "Monica: But...",

        "Dr. Sedwick: Sure. Sure. But don't take too long, okay, because we're all set up for you.",
        "Olivia: Okay. No, I'm not going to lose control. I'm not going to lose control. (Gasps) Oh!"
