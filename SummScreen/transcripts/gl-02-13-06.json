        "Gus tries to call Company, and Zach answers the phone. He says Gus out loud and Beth grabs the phone. Beth tells Harley, Frank, and Buzz that there is just a dial tone. Billy tells Reva that he thinks that there is more to her than just \"Reva and Josh\" when she says that Josh told her that he wants to spend Valentines Day by himself. Buzz comes by and tells them to leave Olivia alone and Reva correctly guesses that he is interested in her. Billy and Buzz discuss being interested in women who are interested in other men. After finding Olivia telling Emma about finding a guy eventually, Josh and Olivia share a kiss. Josh tells her that he isn't ready for anything serious and doesn't want to let either her or Emma down. Olivia says she understands and calls Frank to invite him and his family out for Valentines Day. Harley decides to go to the Spaulding Valentines Day party after all, where Alan- Michael has admitted to Alexandra that he is all set to take over as CEO. Alex starts to announce Alan-Michael's takeover, but he interrupts and offers a toast to Harley instead, telling Alex that it will look bad to take the company away from the grieving widow while she is there. He tells Marina that he had to cover for a million-dollar mistake that Harley made. At the party, Mallet tells Dinah that she can introduce him as her boyfriend if she wants. Later, Dinah tells Mallet to go dance with Harley to \"save\" her and she thanks him for always coming to her rescue. He tells her it's just the type of things that you do for people you love. Harley gets upset and runs off to say goodbye to Gus one last time."

        "Harley: Is anybody planning to get that?",
        "Gus: ( Whispers ) Hello? Hello, is anybody there? Harley?",
        "Harley: Wow, look at you.",
        "Marina: Thank you. You know you have to dress up for that Spaulding crowd, even if it is just a company party.",
        "Frank: I'm going to be waiting up for you.",
        "Marina: Dad, I know how you feel about Alan-Michael....",
        "Frank: I don't think you do.",
        "Marina: But you have to admit he has been a big help, especially the last couple of weeks with Harley.",
        "Harley: Yes, he has been. He has helped me with everything.",
        "Marina: You sure I can't convince you to go with me.",
        "Harley: Nope, no Spaulding's for me tonight. No.",

        "Beth: Lizzie, what is it, what's wrong?",
        "Lizzie: Where's Coop? He's not here.",
        "Buzz: Oh, I heard Ava tell me he was going up to look for you.",
        "Lizzie: Where?",
        "Buzz: Back at your apartment, I guess.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my gosh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Where's Lizzie?",
        "Quinn: She's gone.",
        "Coop: All right, then what the hell are you doing here?",
        "Quinn: I'm here because it's my apartment, idiot. And it always has been.",
        "Coop: Yeah, right.",
        "Quinn: Oh, you don't believe me. Henry, Henry. Don't you know Henry, Henry. Don't you know your girlfriend at all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: What's up, girl? You're not yourself.",
        "Reva: No, the problem is I am myself and it's tripping me. You know I asked Joshua out for Valentine's Day. He turned me down flat.",
        "Billy: Does he have something going on with Olivia?",
        "Reva: Well, I thought that at first, but he claims he is going to be valentine-free.",
        "Billy: Well I can buy that.",
        "Reva: Well I can, too, but I don't know whether I believe him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Hi, you busy?",
        "Josh: Well, I'm reading, does that count?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it can, but if it doesn't then I'd love to come up and just say hello.",
        "Josh: Sure, come on up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Wow, I wonder what the almighty Alan Spaulding would think of this, a memorial service followed by a great big party.",
        "Dinah: I don't know.",
        "Mallet: I don't think Harley is coming; I wouldn't bother looking for her. She has enough to deal with mourning Gus, without a bunch of suits.",
        "Dinah: It's her job, though. It may make her feel better knowing there are a lot of people around here that want to see her success.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: By the end of the night, I'll officially be acting CEO at Spaulding.",
        "Mcmullen: I didn't know you're making your move so soon.",
        "Alexandra: Well the timing's right. All of the ground work has been done.",
        "Alan-Michael: I've already warned Harley that certain people at Spaulding have been circulating the referendum trying to kick her out as CEO and putting me in her place.",
        "Alexandra: Well, the announcement has to be made. It was made quickly and very decisively.",
        "Alan-Michael: And that really is the best thing for everyone. Don't forget that part.",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Well Alan would certainly love it, seeing his own son become head of Spaulding. I just wish Alan could be here to see it.",
        "Alan-Michael: If he were here, Alan would say just make sure you have left nothing to chance. I haven't. You'll make your speech delivering the news, and I will graciously except the board's decision. And now that Harley is a no- show, it should go out without a hitch. A bloodless and hopefully painless coupe. To future. To the future.",
        "Alexandra: To the future king.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Harley, you don't have to do this.",
        "Frank: Yeah, he's right. We've got it all under control here.",
        "Harley: Well, then I'm thinking maybe I should head over to that Spaulding party. It would be good to focus on work.",
        "( Telephone ringing )",
        "Gus: Whoever this is, don't hang up the phone, it's me. It's Gus.",
        "Zach: Gus? Gus:( Whispers ) Zach, Zach, is that you? Listen to me. Put Mommy on the phone. Put Mommy on the phone.",
        "Beth: I'm sorry, it was just a dial tone. Nobody was there.",
        "Zach: It was Gus!",
        "Buzz: No, it wasn't Gus. It wasn't Gus.",
        "Frank: Sis, it's going to be okay.",
        "Harley: Yes, just don't wait up for me, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Hello. Hello.",
        "Alan: Gus? Can you hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Yeah, of course I know Lizzie. We're...",
        "Quinn: Intimate? Or would you go lovers.",
        "Coop: Hey, you're way out of line now, pal.",
        "Quinn: Well at least I'm not in the dark. But it's cool, man. If you want to keep on believing that Lizzie's grandfather owns this place and that she's some sweet little babe, go ahead. Whatever delusion gets you through the day, it's fine with me. But between you and me, pal, \"sweet\" is the last word I would use to describe Lizzie Spaulding. Sweet to fool around with, say fresh out of the shower...",
        "Coop: Watch your mouth now.",
        "Quinn: Relax. She's certainly very fond of you, but I can give her things you can't. Like a lifestyle that she's accustomed to, as perfectly illustrated by my little pied-a-terre here. But it's cool, man. She's very appreciative of it, and you know what? I don't mind sharing. Oh! Ah.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: So he's fixin' to go out with Olivia even though he said he wasn't.",
        "Reva: For no other reason but to prove a point to me.",
        "Billy: Well, you both like proving points.",
        "Reva: Maybe.",
        "Billy: Reva, aren't you tired of this game? I mean, aren't you tired of this whole thing?",
        "Reva: Tired of what?",
        "Billy: You and Josh. I mean, the dance, the heartbreak, the hurt.",
        "Reva: What do you think?",
        "Billy: I think it gets a little old. But I'll tell you one thing, if you want to get him back Reva-style, you put on that red dress that I can't resist; he can't resist either.",
        "Reva: What are you trying to tell me, Billy, you think I should give up on Josh forever?",
        "Billy: No. I'm just saying there's a lot more to you than just Reva and Josh. There always has been a lot more. I just think you need to be reminded of it, that's all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Come on, you're going upstairs; you're going to bed. Go get Ava, she'll take you up, okay?",
        "Frank: This is complete total torture.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Frank: What, knowing how much Harley's hurting and not being able to do a damn thing about it.",
        "Buzz: We are doing something. Frank, we're moving on with our lives. You think she would like it better if we were moping around pitying her? No, she would kill us, and so would Gus.",
        "Frank: I'm trying to go on with my life. I asked Olivia out for Valentine's Day. You can call me hopeful or you can call me just plain crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Come here. You go to sleep. You remember the stories I told you about the prince who would rescue the princess. Well, we're not like that, okay? We don't need a prince, we're strong enough to rescue ourselves. I don't need to be taken care of. And one day I'll know what it is like to have a man by your side, a man who is just as strong as you are, and just by being there he's going to make you stronger. It's amazing how it changes everything, you know. You spend most of your life alone, and you just hope that there's somebody out there that you fit with. Until then, you know, you just keep working hard and taking care of yourself, right? Because that's what strong and independent people do. When that special person shows up, all of a sudden, Em, you just don't feel so alone anymore, and he makes you feel like you're really worth something, you know, in a way that you couldn't on your own.",
        "Josh: You are worth something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Pretty good turnout.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, it is. Alan-Michael, this is going to be a very big night for you. I want to make certain you keep your eye on the prize.",
        "Alan-Michael: Where else would they be?",
        "Alexandra: It seems to me they're going towards a certain Cooper girl.",
        "Alan-Michael: You've got nothing to worry about.",
        "Alexandra: How many times have I heard that?",
        "Alan-Michael: You mean from Alan or Phillip. I already had my family disaster. The first time I ran Spaulding, I blew it. That will not happen again.",
        "Alexandra: All right, so it is out with Harley Cooper, in with Alan-Michael.",
        "McMullen: It can't happen soon enough. That woman doesn't care about this company. If she did, she would be here.",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley has done a fine job for Spaulding. I'll just do a better one. This is a good thing for Harley. In the end, she'll realize it is a kind of gift.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I wonder how the rest of the Coopers are going to take it, or are they going to look at you like another back-stabbing Spaulding?",
        "Alan-Michael: It's not my concern.",
        "Marina: What's not your concern?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: You've got to behave tonight.",
        "Mallet: At least you have a date tonight who is kind of frisky.",
        "Dinah: How should I introduce you to my esteemed colleagues? Date sounds like I found you on the internet.",
        "Mallet: How about meet my love god?",
        "Dinah: Ooh. Beau? Lover? No.",
        "Mallet: It would be okay if you just called me your boyfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: You look incredible.",
        "Marina: Well, thank you, but it doesn't answer my question.",
        "Alan-Michael: Let me prepare you an answer.",
        "Marina: Okay. Time is up. What are you not concerned about?",
        "Alan-Michael: How jealous every guy here has got to be that I snagged the hottest woman in the room. I'm not sure how I did it, but here I am.",
        "Marina: You no, that doesn't answer my question. But ask me if I care?",
        "Alan-Michael: You okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah, and don't get a big head or anything, the way that you stepped in for Harley through all of this has just been amazing. You're one of the good Spaulding's, Alan-Michael. ( Applause )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I am so sorry.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, Lizzie, what are you apologizing for. I'm the one who decked the guy.",
        "Quinn: I literally put a roof over your head, to say nothing about subsidizing your designer shoe habit, and I bank rolled...",
        "Lizzie: Save it. What he means to say is...",
        "Quinn: Tell me, Lizzie, darling, what you mean to say?",
        "Lizzie: That you're jealous of Coop. Ages ago, he asked me out, and you were dying for us to be a couple, and I said I wasn't interested, and now you're trying to get me back.",
        "Quinn: By showering you with gifts and favors. Ooh, how?",
        "Lizzie: He's making all of this up.",
        "Coop: Is that true?",
        "Lizzie: Of course it is. Coop, I feel horrible that you've been dragged into this.",
        "Quinn: I don't know about that, Lizzie-kin, it seems like you're doing fine, working both of us perfectly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: You asked Olivia out on a date? She hasn't called you back?",
        "Frank: I take that as hopeful.",
        "Buzz: Check on the kids.",
        "Frank: Thanks, Pop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: What's the advice you'd give me, Billy, hit the dating circuit, ask random guys out on the street?",
        "Billy: I don't know, whatever works, do it.",
        "Reva: I can't believe you've jumped off the Reva and Josh bandwagon.",
        "Billy: I'm just tired of people hurting each other and calling it love.",
        "Reva: And that's what you think Josh and I have been doing, hurting each other and calling it love.",
        "Billy: No, it's real, it always will be real, but you and Josh, all of the drama, all of the scenes, all of the, you know, getting him jealous, getting him hurt, and hurting yourself. I mean, you deserve better than that.",
        "Reva: Boy, you've become quite the philosopher.",
        "Billy: I'm sorry. I'm just a drunk trying to hang out. But I want to tell you something, I'm so happy that you have tried to help me and stood by me. That's as much a part of Reva as the vamp and trouble-maker. ( Laughter )",
        "Reva: But I still like to make trouble.",
        "Billy: I do, too, but not the type that involves Josh and Olivia.",
        "Reva: Oh, Buzz, I'm sorry about Gus. is there anything I can do?",
        "Buzz: You can leave Olivia alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: I'm just wondering how to explain to a three-year-old who lost her father, and the man she's grown to love as a father, that her grandfather and uncle are gone, too.",
        "Josh: I don't know what to say.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. You walked in and I sound so pathetic. God.",
        "Josh: Sorry. Nobody likes to feel alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Thank you, I'm fine. Just make sure everything is okay in I.T.",
        "Dinah: Naturally. You look great, absolutely beautiful.",
        "Harley: You do, too. I'm a little shaky, a half hour ago I was handed Gus's flag.",
        "Dinah: Honey, you don't have to be here. We can go right now.",
        "Harley: I feel like I need to move forward. I think Gus would want me to do that.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Well, you know what, you make it happen. You do and it will make Gus proud. You know you have that in you.",
        "Marina: Harley, I'm so glad you're here. You look beautiful.",
        "Harley: You look beautiful.",
        "Alexandra: May I have your attention, everyone, I have an announcement to make, and as difficult as it is for me to do it at this particular time, it does have to be done and done tonight, because it does involve the entire future of Spaulding Enterprises.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Gus, if you're there, for God's sake, answer me.",
        "Gus: Sh, sh, I hear you.",
        "Alan: Do you see a door, a window, anything?",
        "Gus: There's a door.",
        "Alan: Then get to it. This nightmare will be over. You can do it. Concentrate and move.",

        "Michelle Ray Smith, \"Inside The Light.\" I'm learning about who I am every day, to be honest with you. My background is a mystery. Ava is a little more easygoing and passive than I am in real life. I'm proud to be part of the longest-running show in history. See Ava, Wednesday, February 15, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I uh... I feel like I need to be honest with you right now.",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Josh: I like kissing you. I really do. But that kiss didn't feel like one of those, you know, lost-in-the-moment kind of kisses after a few drinks and a good date. I keep thinking about what you were saying when I came in, about being alone and finding someone new.",
        "Olivia: I'm not trying to pressure you, I'm not.",
        "Josh: I understand that, but I'm also thinking about Emma, here. She has already had so many people let her down in her young life-- men who were close to her and vanished. And I just don't think it would be right for me to give her that impression if I didn't intend to stay close. I'm working out a lot of things in my life right now, Olivia. To give Emma or you that idea, it just wouldn't be fair.",
        "Olivia: Listen, I, um, I get it. I'm not ready for any big commitments. I just... dates, drinks, this is all very nice, but anything beyond it, it's just not a good time.",
        "Josh: I'm glad to know we're on the same page, then. I'll call you.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Whenever.",

        "Lizzie: You have to believe that.",
        "Coop: I do.",
        "Quinn: I hope he is worth it, Lizzie. I hope he is worth all of those meals you'll have to choke down at that depressing little diner. I hope he is worth that, I really do, for your sake. And most of all, I hope he's worth all of things that you had to do to hang on to him. Leading me on so I would bank roll this.",
        "Lizzie: He's worth it. He is worth every stupid thing I had to do with you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: This has been a particularly difficult time for everybody at Spaulding. And that has been no secret. This year we lost... we lost Phillip, which was quite a serious blow to the company, and to the family. But we recovered, we did, only to lose my beloved father and brother Alan and Gus. And no one has been more hurt by this than Harley Cooper. As a matter of fact, I wasn't even certain she would be able to show up tonight. And I know all of you board members are deeply concerned about this company. We want a leader who can lead in the good times and the bad times.",
        "Alan-Michael: May I?",
        "Alexandra: Yes.",
        "Alan-Michael: Thank you. A leader does lead. And we have been concerned about our CEO's ability to run this company, given the burden. Take a good look at her, she is here, grieving, yes, but stronger than ever. So I would like to propose a toast to Harley Cooper. An inspiration to us all.",
        "All: Here, here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I've got to get out.",
        "Alan: Gus, get to the door. I know you can do that because you've been trained in this sort of thing. You've never let yourself fail. Because if you did, you wouldn't just disappoint me, you would disappoint Harley. The longer you're out here, the more time she has to take solace with Detective Mallet.",

        "Coop: Lizzie, you need to tell me exactly what happened with Quinn right now.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, I love you.",
        "Coop: I got that. Is this Quinn's place? No-- you look at me and tell me the truth.",
        "Quinn: So there you have it. If you two will excuse me, I have to go fix my nose.",
        "Coop: He's not making any of this stuff up. You told me this is your grandfather's apartment?",
        "Lizzie: I didn't mean to lie to you. I just wanted us to have some place.",
        "Coop: What did you do to get the keys?",
        "Lizzie: I thought it would make things easier.",

        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: It's ours when we were here. Only ours, Coop. You have to believe me.",
        "Coop: No. What else did you lie about, Lizzie, you've got to tell me this.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, you have to understand, I'm not like you. I don't know how to be poor. I don't know how to do it. You save money-- you have a real job.",
        "Coop: You have a job, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: No, I made that up.",
        "Coop: No, I met your boss.",
        "Lizzie: Quinn knows her. He asked her to say that I worked for her. In exchange, I bought some clothes from her. I know it was wrong for me to fake it, but I could never keep a real job.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you bought stuff, you had money. That was Quinn, too?",
        "Lizzie: Some. But I also took out a loan from this loan shark guy.",
        "Coop: Oh!",
        "Lizzie: I had to pay rent.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, what were you thinking? This is crazy.",
        "Lizzie: I was thinking if I couldn't make it on my own, I would disappoint you and you wouldn't love me anymore.",
        "Coop: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Whatever I had to do with Quinn, you have to believe me, it didn't mean anything.",

        "Reva: But where would you like it to go?",
        "Buzz: Huh. Actually, Frank has had a few dates with her.",
        "Billy: When Josh isn't around.",
        "Buzz: My son has been alone for a long time. This might be good for him, and me and Olivia-- no. You've got the wrong Cooper.",
        "Reva: I don't know about that. Right here. Joshua?",
        "Josh: Yeah, what is it?",
        "Reva: I just wanted to say hi. Billy and I were at an AA meeting tonight.",
        "Josh: Well, that's good. How's he doing?",
        "Reva: Well, as well as can be expected. You know, day to day, like the rest of us.",
        "Josh: Well, on our good days, at least. Excuse me.",
        "Billy: Well, it was a nice try, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Billy: The poker face. It's obvious you like Olivia. Olivia, she deserves to be happy,",
        "Buzz: She deserves more than I have to offer, if you know what I mean?",
        "Billy: Yeah, I guess I know what you mean.",
        "Buzz: Still, you know, I see her smiling at some guy, and I think, well, he can give her what I can't. He can give her what she wants, and I kind of wish that smile were for me.",
        "Billy: You know what it is? It is that she does smile at you. And it is not the smile that you want, because the smile says she thinks of you as a really good friend.",

        "Alexandra: Alan-Michael, a toast instead of a pink slip for Harley, would you mind telling me if you've had a change of heart.",
        "Alan-Michael: No, but how would it look to overthrow a brand new widow, at a party, nonetheless. It would look bad.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, but then what now?",
        "Alan-Michael: We go to plan \"B.\"",

        "Dinah: Somebody is happier than me to see her having a great time. But look at her, she's barely keeping it together. Ask her to go dance.",
        "Mallet: What?",
        "Dinah: I said ask her to go dance, please. Distract her.",
        "Mallet: No, forget it.",
        "Dinah: Come on, be a good boyfriend. Please. It's your first assignment.",
        "Mallet: Okay. You owe me.",
        "Dinah: I owe you, huge.",

        "Alan-Michael: Excuse us. I need your help.",
        "Marina: Oh, let me guess, you drank your champagne too fast and you got a speeding ticket.",
        "Alan-Michael: I want your advice.",
        "Marina: Tell me.",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley made a major, major mistake at work. It is understandable, but it is going to cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
        "Marina: Are you serious?",
        "Alan-Michael: Yes, it is bad. I did what I could to stop the bleeding, but...",
        "Marina: Does she know?",
        "Alan-Michael: I kept it to myself to protect Harley, but now I'm wondering if the best thing is to just tell her. What do you think.",

        "Mallet: Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, but feel free to say no, but would you like to dance?",

        "Harley: Use a crutch.",
        "Mallet: A crutch.",
        "Harley: My legs feel like spaghetti. Everybody is being very, very nice, but I feel like I might faint in front of them. But I don't want to embarrass myself in front of the employees.",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "Harley: Gus would want me to tough it out, too. I'm doing this for him. It's all for Gus.",

        "Billy: Yeah, I'm really excited. I hear they have live music there.",
        "Reva: Hey, listen to me, you're going to make it through this. I'm going to see to it. Or you'll end up a broken old drunk trying.",
        "Billy: I love you, Reva. I'm so lucky. People can still make me laugh, and I'm so grateful to have you as a friend.",
        "Reva: Oh!",
        "Billy: I've got a great idea. Since Josh doesn't want to play Valentine's Day, how about you and I hang out together and go to a meeting, and we can take a walk or kick back and watch some good old movies.",
        "Reva: I say why the heck not.",

        "Olivia: What message?",
        "Frank: Never mind. You have something in mind?",
        "Olivia: In fact I do. There is this little Inn outside of town I'm thinking of buying, and I wanted to go out there and give it a test run, just for the night.",
        "Frank: With me?",
        "Olivia: You and the rest of your family.",
        "Frank: You want to spend Valentine's Day with all of the Coopers.",
        "Olivia: Why not? Let's call it an act of solidarity, me, you and your family banding against all of the greeting card companies.",
        "Frank: That sounds like a good time. I'll be there.",
        "Olivia: Terrific. Be sure to tell the rest of your family, Buzz, Harley, everyone.",
        "Frank: We'll all be there. You can count on it. We'll see you tomorrow. You know what, I don't know what all that means, but I'm taking it as a good sign, Pop.",

        "Coop: Thought what, hmm? You thought I wouldn't find out.",
        "Lizzie: I thought that it would be better for us.",
        "Coop: Better for us? Lizzie, how could you think that would make things better for us. Have I ever asked you to do anything you didn't want to do. Have I ever asked you to give up your life, money, your family, no.",
        "Lizzie: It wasn't what you said. It was a feeling I got.",
        "Coop: A feeling? That feeling was in your mind, not mine. Lizzie, our first time together, our intimate moments were right here.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, and they were incredible.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, this was his place. Mr. Once or twice. I've got to get out of here, I can't be here.",

        "Coop: Some stuff? Lizzie, you lied about everything.",
        "Lizzie: Not about loving you and not about Quinn.",
        "Coop: You know what kills me the most about all of this? You didn't need to do any of it. I've got to go.",
        "Quinn: You want to give me a ride to the hospital. I think your waiter may have broken my nose.",

        "Harley: You're a really good sport.",
        "Mallet: With two left feet.",
        "Harley: In spite of your two left feet. You're always rescuing me from these sticky situations, and you don't complain.",
        "Mallet: Well, that's what we do for the people we love-- I mean-- you know what I mean. It kind of came out wrong.",
        "Harley: Its okay. It's okay. I'm going to just, you know-- it is not you. It is not you. Okay.",
        "Marina: What's wrong? Where is Harley going?",
        "Mallet: What's wrong is she just lost Gus. Harley is not herself, and that is not good.",
