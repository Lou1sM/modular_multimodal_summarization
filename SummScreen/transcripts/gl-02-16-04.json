{"Episode Summary": [], "Recap": ["The Valentine's Day party continues and an unseen guest hovers over the crowd. She first sets her sights on Billy and taunts him by sending an anonymous drink his way. She then makes eye contact with a nervous Ed. She then taps Alex on the shoulder and asks if she can have a dance with Buzz. As they dance, Carrie freezes Buzz when she mentions a secret she's kept for thirty years. Buzz rushes off to consult with the other men when Carrie moves in on Josh. When she cuts in on Reva and Josh's dance, Reva notices her ring and is struck when the scarab seems to swirl around. As Josh and Carrie dance, he slowly begins to realize that she is the witness, the one who has been manipulating Marah, Marina and Michelle. Marah and Jeffrey can't fight their mutual attraction. Marah suggests that Valentine's Day could be like New Year's Eve, another night out of time. Just then, Marah gets an urgent message from Marina. The moment between Jeffrey and Marah passes and Jeffrey is left alone. Michelle and Ed draw closer as she promises never to lose faith in him again. Marah and Michele try to reach her but to no avail. They rush off to the museum. Shayne answers and they rush in to make sure Marina is safe. Marina tells them that she did not send them any message. The girls deduce that Carrie set them up. Just as it appears that she's going to down a drink laced with \"D\", Nico shows up and swallows the drink himself. He becomes the life of the party and pulls Lizzie into a sexy dance. But soon the high turns ugly and Nico begins to panic. Lizzie considers saving herself and abandoning him. But in the end, she does the right thing by calling for her limo to take Nico to the hospital."], "Recap Author": "Megan", "Show Title": "Guiding Light", "Transcript": ["Nico: Thanks. You saved me a trip to the bar.", "Lizzie: Excuse me, that's mine.", "Nico: What's up, Blade? Haven't seen you in a while.", "Blade: Well, that's because you haven't been around. Looks like you healed pretty well there, huh?", "Nico: Yeah, well, I bounce back real fast.", "Lizzie: Well, then, how about you giving me my drink back, fast, and go get your own at the bar?", "Nico: Sure. I'll get you a soda.", "Lizzie: What are you, my mom?", "Nico: Oh, it's funny you mentioned her. Does she know you're here? Because the last time I checked, you were under house arrest.", "Lizzie: You know, I don't think that's any of your business.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Blade: That's right. Drink up, Nico.", "Luis: Yo, didn't you put something in that drink for only, uh, little blondie over there is supposed to drink it?", "Blade: Yeah, but you know what?

Shh.", "Marah: So, it is real?", "Jeffrey: Marah, what are we doing? How did this happen?", "Marah: How did this not happen sooner?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: It was ridiculous, actually, you know. I mean, I wanted to talk to Mr. O'Neill. You know how difficult he can be. But the only way he would talk to me is if I danced with him.", "Edmund: Did you ask him about that new designer drug, the stuff the kid was high on the other night?", "Cassie: \"D,\" Delirium. Yeah, I did. I thought he was going to tell me to blow off or something, but he didn't. He says that he already knows all about it, and he really took me seriously.", "Edmund: Well, I should hope so. The man's the district attorney.", "Cassie: Yeah, but he's kind of weird. I just never know what to expect from him, you know.", "Edmund: Yeah, well, Mr. O'Neill is full of surprises.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Waiter: Here you go, sir.", "Billy: What's that?", "Waiter: Bourbon on the rocks, splash of cola.", "Billy: I didn't order that.", "Waiter: The lady said you'd want it.", "Billy: What lady?", "Waiter: She was right over there. She said, \"Bourbon and cola's his drink, always was.\"", "Billy: Could you please get that out of here?", "Waiter: Yes, sir.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marina: It was incredible. You are incredible.", "Shayne: No, you are incredible.", "Marina: No, you are incredible.", "Shayne: You.", "Marina: No, you. Okay, we're both incredible. (Laughs)", "Shayne: You're more than incredible. I never would have recovered. I wouldn't be up and walking right now if it weren't for you. You are the reason.", "Marina: You're the reason I'm so happy, so we're even.", "Shayne: I'm glad you're happy. Somehow I feel like this was our first time. Like the other time didn't count.", "Marina: Oh, no, the other time counted. Believe me.", "Shayne: You know what I mean. I mean... I wasn't... I wasn't better yet. I didn't feel like I could...", "Marina: Shayne, last time was amazing. And this time was amazing, and the best part is, there's so much more to come.", "Shayne: I like the sound of that.", "Marina: I have an amazing idea.", "Shayne: You have another one?", "Marina: I am going to go and find that great shower stuff Marah got me for Christmas...", "Shayne: Uh-huh...", "Marina: ...And when you hear the water running, that's your cue to join me.", "Shayne: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: You sure can cut a rug, woman.", "Alexandra: Yeah, to what exactly is the etymology of that expression?", "Buzz: That would be grass-roots American. I'll get you a phrase book. Ah, to the mysteries of life. Cheers.", "Alexandra: Cheers. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz, my darling.", "Buzz: Yes, ma'am.", "Alexandra: It's so nice to see you laugh. You know, for a while there I was wondering, and I know you've been going through something, but...", "Buzz: It was lovely of you not to press it.", "Alexandra: Yes, it was. Are we almost through it? Are we almost through it now?", "Buzz: Almost. Almost.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: So have I told you yet? How happy I am that you showed up?", "Ed: A hundred times. The feeling is mutual.", "Michelle: I'm so sorry, Dad.", "Ed: It's over, sweetie. It is over, right?", "Michelle: Yes, you're my father and you always come first.", "Waiter: Excuse me, Mrs. Santos? We just received a message for you at reception.", "Michelle: Oh, thank you. I'll be right there. There's some new volunteers working the hotline. I hope nothing's wrong.", "Ed: Yeah, you go to do what you have to do. I'm not going any place.", "Michelle: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Jeffrey, if you're scared to get closer to me because you think that I'll make assumptions about us, I won't.", "Jeffrey: Marah, I'm a man. I kind of get scared about emotional stuff; I freak out.", "Marah: Okay, well, to prevent you from freaking out, New Year's Eve was a night out of time for us, right? A break from reality? Technically, couldn't Valentine's Day be the same thing? Just you and me alone together, no strings attached?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cassie: It would so great if we could stop this Delirium problem before it even gets started.", "Edmund: I thought it already had started; that's why it was a problem.", "Cassie: Well, you know what I mean. So are you annoyed because I was dancing with Mr. O'Neill?", "Edmund: Annoyed? Why would I be annoyed?", "Cassie: Because he's annoying?", "Edmund: No kidding. I'm amazed you could even dance with the man without kicking him or dousing him with water. But the fact that you could, Cassie, tells me something.", "Cassie: It does?", "Edmund: It tells me this whole designer Delirium drug thing must mean a great deal to you to be able to put up with the man.", "Cassie: It does. It really does.", "Edmund: Well, then please, Cassie, by all means, spend as much time with the man as you need to... to rid Springfield of this drug problem. But not a minute longer, because I'll miss you.", "Cassie: Thank you.", "Edmund: No, Cassie, thank you. Thank you for having a good heart and being a caring person. That's what makes you you and makes me love you so very much.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: Holidays are supposed to be time out of time? What, any holiday or just the holidays that you choose?", "Marah: I really enjoy spending time with you, and I don't really want it to end. Do you want it to end? Do you want to go home alone?", "Jeffrey: No. I want to be with you. God help me, I want to be with you. Do you have a coat?", "Marah: Mm-hmm.", "Jeffrey: Where is it?", "Marah: In the coat check.", "Jeffrey: Go get it. Let's get out of here.", "Marah: Okay.", "Waiter: Ms. Lewis?", "Marah: Yes?", "Waiter: There's a message for you at the front. I was told it's important.", "Marah: Thank you. I wonder what that's about.", "Jeffrey: You want me to come with you?", "Marah: Ah, no, that's okay. I'll go, I'll check and I'll be right back.", "Jeffrey: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: You know, I realize I've been a little out of it lately, and I'm almost afraid to ask this question, but is there something going on between Jeffrey O'Neill and Marah?", "Reva: Define \"something.\"", "Josh: I don't think I want to.", "Reva: Me, neither.", "Josh: Okay, well aside from the fact that he is way, way, way too old to be dating our daughter, what do you think of the guy?", "Reva: He's not a bad person.", "Josh: Is he a good person?", "Reva: You know what I think? I think that this is a passing fancy, hopefully, for both of them. And as long as Marah's not talking about a wedding date, then what I really want is to not think about it.", "Josh: Okay, I guess I can accept that.", "Reva: And on the upside, he's not a mobster like Tony was. He's the DA.", "Josh: He can keep Marah safe.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Michelle? What's going on?", "Michelle: I don't know. There's a message for us, but they wouldn't give it to me until you got here. Thanks.", "Marah: What? What is it?", "Michelle: It's from Marina. \"There's trouble. Come to the museum. I need your help.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nico: What are you trying to prove, coming here by yourself, hanging out with a loser like Blade?", "Lizzie: I'm trying to have fun, okay? Why don't you go bother someone else?", "Nico: Don't tell me you think that guy's cool.", "Lizzie: Yeah. In a grungy way, I really do.", "Nico: Oh, so you like the fact that Blade and his pal Luis busted up Marah's fashion show? Yeah, they trashed the place. Oh, and then while you and your girlfriends were strutting down the catwalk, minor detail: They knifed me in the alley.", "Lizzie: Wait. Blade was the guy who stabbed you?", "Nico: How do you think he got his name, Lizzie? Figure skating? (Laughs) That was good, huh? \"Figure skating.\"", "Lizzie: Were you serious or not?", "Nico: About what?", "Lizzie: About Blade, what he did. Are you serious or no?", "Nico: I'm always serious. Seriously. Why don't you just pack it up and call it a night, huh? And go back to...", "Lizzie: Go back where? Where I belong? Because I don't belong anywhere, okay? See, this is why my life is such a mess, and why I have to act out in really stupid things to cause my family grief. Hello? Nico?", "Nico: Ooh. I love this song.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Luis: What the hell is he doing?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Blade: Relax, relax. Enjoy the show.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Come on, Marina, Shayne. Come on, pick up! Marina's cell had no answer, so I'm trying Shayne's now.", "Marah: Michelle, what if Carrie was just pretending to be cool with us so that we would let our guard down and now she's gone after Marina and my brother?", "Michelle: We should go over there. Just let me tell my dad and Danny, okay?", "Marah: Okay, I have to tell someone, too.", "Michelle: Okay.", "Marah: I'll meet you back here.", "Michelle: Um, Dad?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: Hey, is everything all right?", "Michelle: Yeah, you know, it was just the hospital. They're short-staffed, so they need me to go in.", "Ed: Oh, honey, this is your night. Come on. Why don't you let me go in for you?", "Michelle: No, no, no. I already agreed. I mean, and besides there's a patient there that I need to check on. And, you know, it's just until the shift's over. Have you seen Danny?", "Ed: Last time I saw him, he was glad-handing people over there.", "Michelle: Could you just tell him that I'll be back soon?", "Ed: Yeah, sure.", "Michelle: Thanks.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Remy lost his keys, and so I have to go let him in, but I should be done really soon, and then I will come back here and we can pick up where we left off.", "Jeffrey: Well, um, you know what? Maybe this is a sign.", "Marah: No, no.", "Jeffrey: Yes, yes, Marah. You know, this is... this is not another night out of time. I think we should go our separate ways.", "Marah: Now, don't say that.", "Jeffrey: Happy Valentine's Day.", "Marah: Jeffrey.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: Great minds, huh?", "Billy: Yeah. No, I came out to get some air. You know, Ed, inside there, something happened. It totally weirded me out.", "Ed: Yeah, me, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Reva: So, um, what exactly did you mean when you said that Jeffrey could \"keep Marah safe?\"", "Josh: Oh, um, I'm sorry. Well, when she was with Tony, you know, it was kind of scary from time to time. It's just nice to know that she's with someone now who's connected, but in a good way. If he were a little closer to her age, that would be nice.", "Reva: Well, I know where I always feel safe.", "Josh: Where is that?", "Reva: Right here. In your arms. Always have, always will.", "Josh: Me, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: You're kidding me. You really want to go to a motorcycle convention with me?", "Alexandra: I do, I do. In fact, it would be a lot of fun, and I could wear loads of leather, right? (Laughs)", "Carrie: I don't mean to intrude, Baroness, but may I cut in?", "Alexandra: I'm sorry. Have we met?", "Carrie: Oh, yes, years ago. In Paris. I was at the ball for the annual Spaulding shareholders. Oh, you wouldn't remember me, there were so many people there, but, of course, I remember you.", "Alexandra: Oh, my goodness, I'm almost afraid to ask why.", "Carrie: Oh, it was because you looked so wonderfully elegant. As you do tonight, as I'm sure your gentleman friend would agree. Could I beg a favor, and just ask one dance, please?", "Alexandra: Oh, when you put it that way, how can I refuse, Miss... Miss...?", "Carrie: Oh, lovely. Thank you so much. Oh, you don't mind, do you?", "Buzz: Uh, uh, no, but...", "Carrie: I promise I'll bring him right...", "Buzz: You know, I haven't danced much. I don't want to step on your feet.", "Carrie: Oh, don't worry. You're perfect. It's going to be just fine.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Techno music playing)", "Nico: You are so beautiful.", "Lizzie: Oh, really?", "Nico: Yeah, really. How come I never noticed how beautiful you were before? You want to... you want to go out sometime? Maybe a movie or dinner or dancing or a walk on the beach? We could check out the stars.", "Lizzie: And this is all in one night? ( Laughs)", "Nico: Yeah, it'll be perfect. Do you like me?", "Lizzie: Yeah, I do.", "Nico: Perfect. Whoa. Oh, it's getting hot. Is it hot in here?", "Lizzie: Maybe a little.", "Nico: No, it's getting very hot. I'm, like, burning up.", "Lizzie: Are you okay?", "Nico: Yeah. Maybe it's you... that's got me so fired up. Maybe it's you and the music and it's like everything is just so perfect. And this room right now is so alive. Even the walls. Even the walls seem alive. Are they?", "Lizzie: What?", "Nico: The walls.", "Lizzie: Are the walls what?", "Nico: Alive.", "Lizzie: No, what are you talking about?", "Nico: Oh, man. I need, um... I need to...", "Lizzie: What do you need? What do you need? What? Nico!", "Nico: I feel like the music's coming out of my chest.", "Lizzie: The music's not coming out of your chest!", "Nico: Yes, it is.", "Lizzie: No, it's not!", "Nico: Get it out! Get it out!", "Lizzie: \"Get it out?\" What are you talking about?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Blade: Hey, hey, hey. Want to dance, princess?", "Lizzie: No, I don't! There's something wrong with him.", "Blade: No, he's fine, he's cool.", "Lizzie: No, he's not! There's something wrong.", "Blade: Look, baby, don't worry about Nico. He's having his own party going on right now. Come on, let's go dance. Come on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Elizabeth hasn't checked in with you, has she?", "Beth: No, she hasn't, and I was just wondering if I should go to the teen party and see what she's up to.", "Alan: Oh, I think we can give her a little more time. After all, she's just in the next room.", "Beth: You're a pushover for her, you know that? I'll give her a little more time. You happy?", "Alan: Oh, I'm very happy, but I'm not sure my sister is. Seems like Buzz has a new dance partner.", "Alexandra: She cut in, and I couldn't say no.", "Beth: Sure you could.", "Alexandra: No, I couldn't. She's a stockholder, Spaulding stockholder, and, you know, we have to keep our investors happy, don't we, Alan?", "Alan: Not by giving them Buzz Cooper. I think a toaster oven would be more appropriate.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alexandra: Watch it, love, or I'll lead her right to you.", "Carrie: Buzz, you dance wonderfully.", "Buzz: I... How do you know my name?", "Carrie: I can still get around, you know. Well, you're quite the pillar of the community these days. I've been waiting to meet you for such a long time. Nearly thirty years.", "Buzz: Thirty years?", "Carrie: Well, I'm sure we'll meet again. Later.", "Alexandra: Well, I hope that wasn't too, too terrible for you.", "Buzz: I, uh... Excuse me.", "Alexandra: Wha...?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: Excuse us. Where are the others?", "Alan: What others?", "Buzz: The others. Where are they?", "Alan: I don't know where Josh is.", "Buzz: Bill, Ed?", "Alan: I think they stepped outside. Why?", "Buzz: We've got a problem, a big one. Come on.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Come on, come on.", "Michelle: Why won't it open? Why won't it open?", "Marah: I don't know. It must be bolted from the inside.", "Michelle: Marina! Marina, are you all right? Marina, open up!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Nico!", "Nico: Keep... keep your hands off of her!", "Blade: Hey, you got the whole sentence out. Get out! Hey, Nico, got a tip for you, man: If you go with the flow, it's a great ride. But if you start fighting it...", "Lizzie: Are you okay?", "Blade: ...It gets real ugly, real fast. So, peace, all right?", "Nico: There's something in the drink.", "Blade: Hey, enjoy your ride on the \"D\" train, brother.", "Lizzie: What did you do to him? Nico, are you okay?", "Blade: Take care, sweetheart.", "Lizzie: Are you okay?", "Nico: My heart. Is this the floor or the ceiling?", "Lizzie: No, no, no, it's all right. Everything's going to be okay, okay?", "Nico: Just go. Go before your parents find you. Go!", "Lizzie: No! Jeremy, it's Lizzie. I need the car here now. Stay still. It's okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Marina!", "Michelle: Marina!", "Marah: Either she can't hear us or she can't get to the door. Okay, there's got to be another way to get in here. Can we climb through a window or something?", "Marah: No. My dad installed a security system. You know what? If we go around the side and break... Shayne, are you okay?", "Shayne: Yeah, yeah. Thanks to you. The dinner and the...", "Marah: Where's Marina?", "Shayne: Why? What's going on?", "Marah: Just answer me, Shayne. Where is she?", "Shayne: She's here.", "Marah: Is she? Where? Where?", "Michelle: Look, we just need to talk to her, okay?", "Marah: Are you sure that she's in the shower?", "Shayne: Yes. Until you were pounding on the door, I was...", "Marah: Well, I don't hear the shower going. Do you?", "Michelle: No.", "Marah: We're just going to go check, okay?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Guys, we may have a problem.", "Buzz: Gentlemen, there is a woman inside, came out of nowhere, cut in on me while I was dancing with Alexandra.", "Billy: Older woman? Skinny?", "Ed: Long blonde hair? Wearing a black dress.", "Buzz: Yes.", "Ed: And I've had the feeling that she's been looking at me all night. She sent Billy a drink.", "Billy: Yeah. Bourbon on the rocks with a splash. That was my drink back then.", "Buzz: \"Thirty years\" was what she said to me. She's been waiting to meet me for almost thirty years, and she can keep a secret.", "Billy: Oh...", "Buzz: Before I could open my mouth, she was gone.", "Ed: Oh, boy.", "Alan: All right, guys. Guys, I just think we need to be calm here. This may have just been an unpleasant coincidence. It might have nothing to do with what you all think it does.", "Ed: Why? What makes you say that?", "Alan: Because, Ed, I was the one driving. She's never approached me tonight, has she?", "Billy: Well, maybe she's saving the best for last. Look, we've got to find out who this woman is. Where's Josh?", "Buzz: Inside, dancing with Reva.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "(Laughter)", "Reva: It's okay.", "Carrie: Mrs. Lewis?", "Reva: Yes?", "Carrie: Forgive me for interrupting, but could I borrow your handsome husband for one dance?", "Reva: I'm terribly sorry. Do I know you?", "Carrie: No, but I watch your television program. I think I'm probably one of your biggest fans.", "Reva: Oh.", "Carrie: It's such a pleasure to meet you in person.", "Reva: That's very nice of you to say. I really appreciate it. Wow. What an unusual ring.", "Carrie: Just one dance. May I? Shall we?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: Um... sure.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Beth: Okay, that's it. Lizzie still hasn't checked in with me. I'm going to go find her.", "Alexandra: Oh, Beth. Wait, wait, wait. Come on. She's having a good time. She loses track of time.", "Beth: Alex, I can't extend privileges to her if she's going to abuse them.", "Alexandra: Well, she has her cell phone with her. Call her.", "Beth: No. This is something that's best done in person.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lizzie: Nico, it's okay. Just breathe.", "Nico: Where are you taking me? Are you kidnapping me?", "Lizzie: No, Nico, I'm not. The car's on the way and I'm taking you to the hospital. Listen, they're going to be able to help you. Everything's going to be fine. Just calm down.", "Nico: (Hyperventilating)", "Lizzie: Where is he? Oh, Jeremy.", "Jeremy: Miss Lizzie.", "Lizzie: We've got to get him to the hospital.", "Jeremy: All right. Easy now.", "Lizzie: You don't think my parents are going to be able to not know about this, right? Let's just go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: Found her!", "Shayne: All right, you want to tell me what's going on now?", "Marah: Just a little misunderstanding.", "Michelle: A miscommunication.", "Shayne: Yeah, yeah, no kidding. You guys walked out of here acting crazy.", "Marina: Honey, I really wouldn't say that when you're half-naked waving a crutch around. Why don't you go put some clothes on?", "Shayne: All right. I'm going to get you.", "Marina: Mm-hmm. Okay, now will you guys tell me what is going on?", "Michelle: What do you mean? You're the one who wanted to see us, remember?", "Marina: What?", "Marah: You sent us a message at the Georgian Room saying to get over here because there was a problem.", "Marina: When?", "Michelle: You didn't send us a message?", "Marah: (Gasps) It must have been Carrie.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Billy: This whole time, it never even occurred to me that the person who was controlling the girls, this witness from the past, was a woman.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ed: It never occurred to any of us. It doesn't make her any less dangerous, though, does it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Alan: Assuming she is who you think she is. You know, Buzz, maybe you just misunderstood the conversation.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Buzz: No. No, she is who we think she is. She decided to find us before we found her. The question is now, gentlemen, what happens next?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jeffrey: So, who's the broad who swiped your husband?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Josh: So, are you from Springfield?", "Carrie: Why else would I come here?", "Josh: (Laughs) I really don't know. A lot of people are here from out of town to support the crisis center. I thought perhaps...", "Carrie: No, I'm not from the crisis center or the hotline. I came to see you. I have been waiting to see you.", "Josh: Really? You must have heard that I'm such a great dancer.", "Carrie: No. You and I have someone in common.", "Josh: Who is that?", "Carrie: Oh, your daughter, Marah.", "Josh: You know Marah?", "Carrie: Mm.", "Josh: Through her design work?", "Carrie: No, it's more my design work. Your daughter is a wonderfully interesting and creative young woman. We've had so many wonderful conversations. But the most illuminating one was about something that's very, very close to my heart: Cutter's Bridge.", "Josh: It's you.", "Carrie: Yes.", "Josh: You're...", "Carrie: Yes. I am the person you have been looking for. I am the person that you and your friends have been looking for. And here I am. In the flesh.", "Josh: Next on Guiding Light", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Marah: We still don't know why she sent us here.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Michelle: Oh, no.", "Marina: What?", "Michelle: Carrie, she wanted us out. She wanted us away from the Country Club.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Carrie: I think that would be a perfect place for a private conversation.", "Reva: Hey. Thank you so much for taking such good care of my husband.", "Carrie: Oh, I assure you it was my pleasure."], "Transcript Author": ["By Boo Proofread By Hijrah"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mmHwwMfxGk"}
