        "Holly: Sebastian is alive. I knew it.",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Holly: He sent me the dress that he gave me on the island. It could only be him.",
        "Ross: Someone sent you a dress?",

        "Danny: What now?",
        "Marina: Oh, she was just out there telling those vultures that my aunt harley is a murderer. I'm sure you can catch it at 5:00 and 11:00, if you want.",
        "Danny: Marina, she's just upset about her father. That's understandable. Don't worry about it. Nobody takes what she says seriously.",
        "Marina: Oh, right. Because nobody watches tv or reads any of the tabloids. Nobody except everybody.",
        "Danny: Well...",
        "Marina: I swear, I could just kill her. I could kill her. Harley's already been convicted in the papers, and now... it's just too much. It's too much.",
        "Danny: Do you want me to go get rid of the reporters?",
        "Marina: No. Don't bother. The damage has already been done.",
        "Danny: You sure? I could lean on them. Give them my \"cement shoes\" speech.",
        "Marina: Your cement shoes speech?",
        "Danny: It's rusty, but it's still guaranteed to strike fear in the hearts of men.",
        "Marina: Are you serious?",
        "Danny: No, I'm not serious.",
        "Marina: Oh. I just thought...",
        "Danny: See? That's why it still works.",
        "Marina: You are a scary man.",
        "Danny: So how was yesterday?",
        "Marina: It's just this ridiculous scam created by greeting card companies to make lonely people feel lonelier and couple get each other stupid gifts. If it were me, I would just cancel the whole lame day.",
        "Danny: Okay, but actually i meant, how was harley's trial? How did it go?",
        "Marina: Oh, that. Um... it kind of sucked, too.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, put me down! Where are you taking me?",
        "Coop: Oh, knock it off, lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: ( Screeching )",

        "Lizzie: Why are we here?",

        "Lizzie: Okay, I know where we're at. Why are we here?",
        "Coop: Did you ever ask yourself why your dad knocked down my sister's house?",
        "Lizzie: Well, he had reason enough to do it.",
        "Coop: Your little brother's house.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, would you knock it off? That house was ugly. You're acting like it's some work of art.",
        "Coop: Listen to yourself here, lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: What? It wasn't pretty. It was ugly. It's not missed. What? Knock it off.",
        "Coop: You and harley used to know each other when you were a little girl. You guys were close. You even told me that you used to be close.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, \"used to.\" Exactly.",
        "Coop: So what changed?",
        "Lizzie: Let's just say I got to see what she could really do, okay? You know what? The whole town has seen it.",
        "Coop: Oh, you know what? Get off that bandwagon, all right? Use your own brain for once, all right?",
        "Lizzie: My family is grieving.",
        "Coop: Sure they are. You know what? Your grandfather wants revenge now, too, and wants the coopers to be the ones who pay, regardless of who really killed your dad.",
        "Lizzie: You should. After everything your family's done to mine.",
        "Coop: News flash, lizzie. Everything started right here in this spot with the wrecking ball and...",
        "Lizzie: Shut up with the house. The house can be replaced.",
        "Coop: Right. My family can'T.",
        "Lizzie: My father can't!",
        "Coop: Are you so screwed up that you feel by hurting my family will make you feel better?",
        "Lizzie: You people asked for everybody bit of this.",
        "Coop: Now you are starting to sound exactly like your dad.",
        "Lizzie: Shut up!",
        "Coop: It's true. You don't care who you hurt or who's suffering.",
        "Lizzie: Shut up, would you please?",
        "Coop: You're acting just as crazy as your father.",
        "Lizzie: Knock it off! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Knock it off!",
        "Dinah: It's not like we're malicious people by nature.",
        "Jonathan: No. I usually go with the nurture side of the argument.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. You're nothing like reva. ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: What is your big problem with these people, anyway? What did cassie do to you?",
        "Dinah: She took everything from me. But that's okay. I just want edmund.",
        "Jonathan: Why?",
        "Dinah: Because I do. And you... you want your mama's family to just suffer because they ditched you as a baby, which... you know what? I actually understand. And I don't blame you.",
        "Jonathan: Hm. Okay. But what does one have to do with the other?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) well, in the spirit of efficiency, I think it's a good idea if we pool our resources together.",
        "Jonathan: Wait a second. Is that what last night was about? I'm offended. I feel used. ( Laughter )",
        "Dinah: Well, good. Good.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, so let's say I do want a partner. What do you bring to the table? ( Laughter )",
        "Dinah: Oh, my gosh. After last night, you even have to ask?",
        "Jonathan: Besides that. I was doing fine by myself. ( Laughter )",
        "Dinah: I have experience that you could benefit from, especially after last night. If that was an indicator, oh, my gosh.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, really? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you complaining. But then again, it was kind of loud in here. There was somebody yelling, \"yes, yes, yes.\"",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: Was that you?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) that was probably you. I am an expert.",
        "Jonathan: At what?",
        "Dinah: You name it. Payback, getting what I want.",
        "Jonathan: Poor aunt cassie.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) oh. So? You don't care about her any more than I do.",
        "Jonathan: You're right.",
        "Dinah: Then do we have a deal?",
        "Jonathan: Depends.",
        "Dinah: On what? ( Laughter )",
        "Jonathan: I want the whole story.",
        "Dinah: Okay. And what do I get out of the deal?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I give you a souvenir.",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh.",
        "Jonathan: A souvenir. And I'll give you some more of last night and this morning.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) how am I going to tell you my story if you keep doing this?",
        "Jonathan: I can multitask.",
        "Dinah: Okay. ( Laughs ) it was dark and stormy...",
        "Danny: Look, I realize that you already sent the guy out, but I need to cancel the order. Why? Because the person that I bought it for isn't going to like it.",
        "Marina: Marina, when are you going to learn to stop saying everything that pops into your stupid head? Zach didn't have a problem with(5a his valentine's day cards.",
        "Danny: Fine. That's fine, if you want to charge me, really. I just want to cancel the order. Okay, good. So you'll call the guy and tell him not to come? Great. Thank you. Hey.",
        "Marina: Hey.",
        "Danny: What are you doing? It's freezing out here.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry. I came out here to tell you that I'm sorry.",
        "Danny: What? For what?",

        "Ross: Holly, it doesn't matter if the waiter comes back or even if there is a dress. Just because there's a dress delivered to you, that doesn't mean sebastian is alive.",
        "Holly: You're looking at me like you think I'm crazy.",

        "Josh: No.",
        "Reva: Tell us the real reason.",
        "Jonathan: ( Sighs ) okay. I guess I got busted. I had a girl in here last night! It looks like we all got lucky, huh? ( Laughs )",
        "Danny: And you're not buying me breakfast, by the way.",
        "Marina: Yes, I am. Come on. It's the least that I can do.",
        "Danny: No. No. No, no, no, no. I told you to forget about it. You got a lot going on with harley's trial and everything. I get it.",
        "Marina: After that whole valentine's day tirade? Please. Sometimes I just say too much.",
        "Danny: Stop. Stop bugging out.",
        "Marina: So you don't think I'm a big freak?",
        "Danny: No, I do. But I like that about you.",
        "Marina: Thank you.",
        "Danny: You're welcome.",
        "Marina: I agree with the whole sentiment of it. I do. I mean, it's really important. People should tell each other how they feel on more than just one day a year.",
        "Danny: Right. Got to live in the moment.",
        "Marina: Exactly. It's just that sometimes people go a little overboard.",
        "Danny: What do you mean, \"overboard\"?",
        "Marina: Oh, you know. Like all the silly, cutesy gifts.",
        "Danny: Hm. Yeah.",
        "Marina: You just have to know when enough is enough. I mean, low-key works best for me.",
        "Danny: Low key. Yeah.",
        "Marina: Danny?",
        "Danny: Huh?",
        "Marina: Are you okay?",
        "Danny: What? Yeah. I'm fine.",
        "Marina: You just had this weird look on your face.",
        "Danny: I did? I don't know.",
        "Marina: Well, you know what i mean, though, right?",
        "Danny: Um, no, I'm not really sure.",
        "Marina: Oh, yes, you do. Those big greeting cards and the gigantic stuffed animals, and oh, my goodness, you know what is the worst? ( Laughs ) those dudes who sing. Talk about tragic.",
        "Danny: ( Laughs weakly ) tragic.",
        "Marina: Who really does that, anyway?",
        "Danny: Beats me.",
        "Marina: Simple and sweet.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Marina: Speaking...",
        "Danny: I'll be right back.",
        "Lizzie: You're so stupid. I cannot believe you didn't see this.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, a little F.Y.I. Most people use their hands or feet to make imprints but this...",
        "Lizzie: Shut up. It's not funny at all.",
        "Lizzie: Get me out.",
        "Coop: I will.",
        "Lizzie: Now.",
        "Coop: But as long as you say, \"please, coop.\" How about that?",
        "Lizzie: Please, coop, get me out of here now. Get me out of here!",
        "Coop: And I will, as soon as you tell me that you've learned your lesson. Do you understand why this happened?",
        "Lizzie: No, but I'm sure you're going to tell me.",
        "Coop: Badmouth people like you just did, and perhaps bad things might then happen to you. It's called karma.",
        "Lizzie: Karma? That's the best you can do? Help me up!",
        "Coop: Hey, sorry.",
        "Lizzie: Well... well, fine. Fine. I'll just sit here until you come back and help me.",
        "Coop: Well, it looks like it's going to be a while, because I'm not helping you until you learn your lesson.",
        "Lizzie: Well... wait, coop. Coop? Wait. What do you want me to say?",
        "Coop: I want you to admit that harley might not be guilty.",
        "Lizzie: No. I'm never going to do that. I'm sorry.",
        "Coop: All righty, then. Talk to you later. I'm sure you're going to get yourself out of that just fine.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, coop, wait. Just please...",
        "Coop: Yes?",
        "Lizzie: I think I'm stuck.",
        "Coop: You're telling me that your whole staging of a sitting- in event, you got yourself...",
        "Lizzie: I think the concrete dried.",
        "Coop: Ah. ( Laughs ) what can I tell you? It is karma.",
        "Holly: Let go of me, ross.",
        "Ross: I don't want you leaving like this.",
        "Holly: What would you prefer? Me in a straitjacket, heading for ravenwood?",
        "Ross: Of course not.",
        "Holly: You think I'm losing it. Maybe you're right. I don't know what I think.",
        "Ross: I think that you've been under a great deal of pressure, and I know what extreme pressure can do to a person.",
        "Holly: A person? Or me?",
        "Ross: You. It could happen to anybody. I could just as well be talking about dinah.",
        "Holly: Why? What's going on? Is she harassing cassie again?",
        "Ross: Yes. I've seen what she's been doing with my own eyes, and it's not pretty.",
        "Holly: Sorry.",
        "Ross: Me, too. You know, you want the best for your kids, but you know, when they get in trouble, it'S...",
        "Holly: Yeah. It's not easy to watch. I remember.",
        "Ross: Blake was a handful, but nothing like dinah. Nothing.",
        "Holly: You haven't told blake about this?",
        "Ross: No, no. The mere mention of my daughter sends blake into a tailspin, and probably always will, because dinah killed her brother.",
        "Holly: And I killed her other brother. Maybe that shrink isn't such a bad idea after all.",
        "Ross: It's a great idea, holly.",
        "Holly: Why go off the deep end if you don't have to, right?",
        "Ross: I wish dinah had that kind of an attitude.",
        "Dinah: Dinah? ( Laughs ) did I hear my name?",
        "Jonathan: You know, I thought we had an open, honest relationship.",
        "Reva: I can't believe you did this.",
        "Jonathan: What's the big deal?",
        "Reva: The big deal? This is our bed.",
        "Josh: And those are my boxers.",
        "Jonathan: They're nice.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Jonathan: I'll tell you what I'll do: You tell me where the clean sheets are, I'll remake the bed. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: Linen closet, down the hall.",
        "Jonathan: That makes sense.",
        "Josh: Don't ever use this bedroom again.",
        "Jonathan: Josh, you set me up with this twin bed. Now, how am I supposed to properly entertain a young lady with those accommodations? Hm?",
        "Reva: You should take a shower. Go.",
        "Jonathan: Okay.",
        "Reva: How did you hurt your leg again?",
        "Jonathan: Edmund. Edmund did it.",
        "Reva: Edmund? What happened?",
        "Jonathan: Well, he came and paid me a visit yesterday at the clayton arms. He knows about me and cassie.",
        "Reva: Oh, my god. Did cassie tell him?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know, but we had a scuffle.",
        "Reva: Well, how did he even know you were there?",
        "Josh: You've got to be kidding.",
        "Reva: Is that true? Was cross creek just a diversion so that edmund could attack my son?",
        "Danny: Here, just take this for your trouble.",
        "Singer: Gee, thanks.",
        "Danny: That's $20.",
        "Singer: Do you know the price of gas these days?",
        "Marina: What's going on?",
        "Singer: Your boyfriend can't make up his mind.",
        "Marina: He's not my...",
        "Singer: Whatever. Happy valentine's day.",
        "Marina: You did all of this for me?",
        "Danny: I'm an idiot. Sorry.",
        "Lizzie: Welcome back.",
        "Coop: Yeah, well, I had a change of heart and thought i would come back for another look at you.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, thanks.",
        "Coop: All right.",
        "Lizzie: Wait. Coop, what are you doing?",
        "Coop: I'm trying to get you free.",
        "Lizzie: What are you touching my shoe for? Those are $500 pairs of shoes. They are not coming off my feet.",
        "Coop: Fine. That's fine with me.",
        "Lizzie: Don't wipe that on me.",
        "Coop: All right, well, look. I'm going to go and see if I can find something to chisel you out of this with, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Fine. Just leave me here to freeze to death. I understand. It's okay. I'll be fine.",
        "Coop: This should suit you just perfectly. Keep this on. Just try not to get anything else on it, that's all.",
        "Lizzie: ( Scoffs )",
        "Coop: I'll be right back. Just stay put. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Lizzie: Ugh. So gross. Hello? Um, no. He's not available. He's busy right now. Can I take a message? This is his niece, marina.",
        "Dinah: Should my ears be burning?",
        "Holly: I'll talk to you later, ross.",
        "Ross: Holly...",
        "Holly: I'm all right. As all right as I can be.",
        "Dinah: So, what's up?",
        "Ross: Nothing. Your name came up in conversation, that's all.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Ross: You have some dirt or something on you. I hope you weren't in another barn brawl.",
        "Dinah: Actually, I had to scale down a trellis and fell the last couple of feet into a flower garden.",
        "Ross: I shouldn't have asked.",
        "Dinah: Can I get a mimosa? I look good, though, right?",
        "Ross: You look beautiful.",
        "Dinah: I have a breakfast date.",
        "Ross: Oh?",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. With that doctor that olivia introduced me to. He's a very nice man.",
        "Ross: Uh-huh. And you like him?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, I do. I think I'm making some better choices.",
        "Ross: Is that so?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Dad, listen, about the fight with cassie. You know, that never would have happened if she didn't call me out there and just provoke the entire thing.",
        "Ross: Dinah, you did not have to go. Did that ever occur to you?",
        "Dinah: Yes. Yes. It does now. But I want to make a fresh start. I have to.",
        "Ross: I only want the best for you.",
        "Dinah: Yes. Well, that is exactly what iI! Want, too.",
        "Josh: Here we go again. Reva, do you honestly believe cross creek had anything whatsoever to do with jonathan?",
        "Reva: No, I don'T.",
        "Josh: Thank you. I think he's making this whole thing up.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not. Edmund really came after me.",
        "Josh: Just think about it for a minute, all right? Yesterday, edmund supposedly hurt his leg, but he still had the energy to go out and findxd some girl, bring her back here, and sleep with her in our bed?",
        "Jonathan: All right, look, I'm injured, but I can still have sex, you know what I mean? You know? Come on.",
        "Reva: Yeah. You better hobble your way on out of here.",
        "Reva: ( Sighs )",
        "Marina: Chocolate's always good for valentine's day. Any day.",
        "Danny: Come on. Come on. That was too cheesy, wasn't it?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Yeah, it was. But I liked it.",
        "Danny: I really meant for it to be funny. I ordered package \"b,\" the boy band medley.",
        "Marina: Are you serious?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry I missed it.",
        "Danny: Well, please, I'm not. Who knew you wanted subtle?",
        "Marina: Speaking of subtle, i had a hard time finding a card that wasn't too... I don't know.",
        "Danny: Cheesy?",
        "Marina: I was going to say mushy.",
        "Danny: I kind of had the same problem. ( Laughter )",
        "Marina: You got this from robbie.",
        "Danny: Hello? You got yours from zach.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Well, it's the thought that counts, anyway, right?",
        "Danny: Right.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know all about the dna test he sent for. On the shard of glass. The results are in? Yeah, thank you very much. I'll give him the message. ( Sniffles )",
        "Ross: Is this your idea of starting fresh?",
        "Dinah: I don't even remember doing that.",
        "Ross: Is that so?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yes. And I have not used this purse in months, and even so, daddy, this photo is a joke.",
        "Ross: Dinah, given the circumstances, it's not very funny.",
        "Dinah: No, it's not. It's not funny. It's not funny at all. But you're right. You're right, dad, look. I swear to you, I am through obsessing over cassie.",
        "Ross: Okay. But in the future, I want...",
        "Dinah: I will stay away from cassie winslow, okay? I have my own life, and in fact, I have a date.",
        "Ross: Okay. You have fun.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I love you.",
        "Ross: I love you. I love you and I wish I could believe you.",
        "Rufus: Yes, sir?",
        "Ross: I have an assignment for you.",
        "Holly: Hold it together, holly. There are a million reasons these things could be happening. It doesn't mean...",
        "Sebastian: Going down?",
        "Josh: I know that must have been hard for you.",
        "Reva: I want so much to believe him, but it seems every time we turn the corner, he's claiming someone else has wronged him. Of course...",
        "Josh: Uh-oh.",
        "Reva: Edmund is a different story.",
        "Josh: Reva, even if edmund did go after him, don't you think somehow jonathan deserved that?",
        "Reva: No. But that doesn't mean I'm going to start slinging accusations at him.",
        "Josh: Good. I think we have to change the sheets. In fact, I think we have to burn the sheets.",
        "Reva: Why don't you do that and I'll go make us some breakfast?",
        "Josh: All right. Just don't take too long, okay?",
        "Reva: Mm.",
        "Josh: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: Hey. I know you're mad, but I wasn't lying about the edmund thing.",
        "Reva: We'll just see about that, now, won't we?",
        "Jonathan: Go get him, mom. Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Cassie: What are you looking for edmund for?",
        "Reva: So I can tell him to stay the hell away from my son or he's going to be sorry.",
        "Olivia: Excuse me to interrupt your little pre- meeting, but I just want to make sure that I heard correctly. You are going to lie on the witness stand? You are going to perjure yourself for her?"
