        "Reva finds out that Josh spent Valentines Day with Olivia after all after she catches him writing a note to accompany the roses he was sending her to apologize for what happened at the cabin. He asks her who he should be sending flowers too, and then when Olivia shows up, blows up at both of them and tells that that although he wants both of them in his life, at the same time wants neither of them. Reva goes to Outskirts and tells Billy about the conversation and then later is taken back when an old co-worker asks Reva if she would mind if she asked Josh on a date. Marina decides that she should be the one to tell Harley that she messed up and that Alan-Michael should take over for her for a while. Harley considers selling the house, she was building with Gus, but Dinah changes her mind. When Alan-Michael and Marina show up with the news, Harley agrees to turn over control for a while, to Dinah. Although Frank asks Olivia out and won't take no for an answer, Buzz tells Olivia that he can't stop thinking about what happened at the cabin between them. Olivia tells him that she really enjoyed herself but she doesn't want to ruin the friendship that they have. Buzz agrees to help Frank with Olivia, and while talking to himself, says that although he really wants to be with her, he loves Frank more. Beth reveals herself to Gus and Alan, but tells them that she is stuck up in the cabin with them and that they are just all going to have to make the best of the situation. Alan tries to convince Beth to leave Gus there and the two of them can try and get back home, and after Alan tells her that she is making a mistake when she refuses, Beth cracks and starts to break things."

        "Josh: It's open, come in.",
        "Reva: Happy belated Valentine's Day. I know you worked the day away, and it was half price, so I couldn't resist.",
        "Josh: Thank you. You shouldn't have.",
        "Reva: Well... oh, you shouldn't have either. Red roses. They're my favorite. Hmmm. So what were you writing on the card?",
        "Josh: Actually...",
        "Reva: Oh, just let me see. Oh. \"Dear Olivia...\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hey, Pops.",
        "Buzz: Ah! Jeez. I jus...",
        "Frank: What was that?",
        "Buzz: Thanks for jumpstarting me, Frank.",
        "Frank: Are you okay?",
        "Buzz: I'm just a little tired these days.",
        "Frank: Well then you're working too many shifts here.",
        "Buzz: I...( stammering ) You sleep at the police station for God's sakes.",
        "Frank: No, I've actually been taking a couple of days off here and there. Let me tell you something, after that Valentine's date with Olivia, I'm taking a few more off. Pop, she set off more than that fire alarm, let me tell you.",
        "Buzz: Did she?",
        "Frank: Yeah. It was really interesting, you know. I was just honest with her. I kind of laid it all out on the line, and she went for it, Pop. Hey, Dad... oh, my God. When we kissed-- oh, man-- let me tell you something, her lips are so soft.",
        "Buzz: Oh...",
        "Frank: No, she's amazing.",
        "Buzz: Yeah...",
        "Frank: What's the matter?",
        "Buzz: ( Stammering ) I wonder if you're making more out of this than it really is, you know. Sure, it was great, but I... you know, I'd hate to see you get your hopes up.",
        "Frank: Don't worry about my hopes. They're right where they belong, trust me. Listen, is there any more apple pie in the back?",
        "Buzz: Kitchen.",
        "Frank: Okay, thanks.",
        "Buzz: Oh, way to go. Your son finally finds the woman of his dreams, and what do you do? What do you do?",
        "Olivia: He didn't do it alone. If I remember correctly, there were two of us there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Finish the memo and get it to me within the hour. Just make it look like Harley has been making mistakes, expensive ones. When do I want it? Yesterday.",
        "Marina: You tell 'em, big guy.",
        "Alan-Michael: I know, I know. Every now and then I channel the old man.",
        "Marina: Hey. What's wrong?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm having second thoughts.",
        "Marina: About us?",
        "Alan-Michael: No, no, no. Harley. Gus is gone; she's been through so much. I'm not sure we should tell her about the mistake I caught. After all, it could just be an accounting error.",
        "Marina: I know what you're trying to do, Alan-Michael, and you're not going to get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Look at this place. Oh, my God. You still have to imagine everything. Where are my bookcases again?",
        "Contractor: Right over here.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Contractor: We ordered more wood when you halted construction, but don't worry, we'll get it going again.",
        "Harley: You know what? That's not why I asked you to come here. You said at one time you would love to buy this property. Are you still interested?",
        "Contractor: Yes, of course. You know that.",
        "Dinah: Hey. This place isn't for sale.",
        "Harley: Excuse me?",
        "Dinah: This is your house, Harley. It's also your dream.",
        "Harley: Maybe once, but dreams die. They die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Ooh.",
        "Gus: Harley.",
        "Beth: Well, good morning, sleepyhead.",
        "Gus: Beth?",
        "Beth: Sh..., don't you say a word. I'm going to make you a nice cup of tea.",
        "Gus: I don't want any tea.",
        "Beth: Hey, hey, hey. You were practically a popsicle when I brought you in here last night. That was a very foolish thing to do, trying to go out there by yourself. You do that another time and you may never see Harley again.",
        "Reva: Let me guess, Olivia was voted employee of the month, which includes a dozen long-stemmed roses, dinner at Barney's Steakhouse and a night of gratuity with whatever Lewis man she chooses.",
        "Josh: Not that I am obligated to share this with you, but I will anyway. I owe Olivia an apology.",
        "Reva: Really?",
        "Josh: Yeah. We had a bit of a misunderstanding. I said some things to her the other night that...",
        "Reva: Last night? Valentine's Day? Here, I thought...",
        "Josh: You know, I actually don't have to clear my calendar with you, Reva.",
        "Reva: Fine.",
        "Josh: Olivia invited me to look at a piece of property that she's thinking about purchasing. It's a country inn that she wants to renovate. She invited pretty much every Cooper on the planet, a bunch of other people. It was kind of like \"deliverance\" over there, actually.",
        "Reva: Wow. I'm sure she found a nice quiet place for you, though. Perhaps a room right next to hers.",
        "Josh: Reva, please...",
        "Reva: I know, I know, we're not together anymore. And if you want to send Olivia an entire flower shop, that's fine; send her two.",
        "Josh: Aren't you on your way to the office right about now, Reva?",
        "Reva: Oh, darn, I forgot. Yep, I've been here, what, 15 minutes? Dock me!",
        "Josh: All right! Okay, fine! If I'm not supposed to send the roses to Olivia, then who? Who am I supposed to send these flowers to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Frank's in the kitchen.",
        "Olivia: Okay. All right. That will give us a chance to talk about what happened.",
        "Buzz: I... ( stammering ) I thought about little else. I've been thinking about...",
        "Olivia: Me, too, and Valentine's Day was incredible. You were incredible. And I was... I didn't expect it. And you were the last... no. What I'm trying to say...",
        "Buzz: We had a great time.",
        "Olivia: We did.",
        "Buzz: Yes. Some of the best times of your life are just not planned.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, you second that. The thing...",
        "Buzz: The thing is...",
        "Olivia: ... Is I'm a girl who needs a plan, Buzz. And when I set a goal, I have to go for it.",
        "Buzz: And let me guess, I'm not in the plans.",
        "Olivia: You were wonderful.",
        "Buzz: I was incredible.",
        "Olivia: You were...",
        "Buzz: But...",
        "Olivia: ...But I don't want to risk losing you as a friend. The men in my life have all left me, and I don't want that to happen with us because I value you too much. Please, our friendship is so sweet; it's uncomplicated, no hidden agenda.",
        "Buzz: What, last night, it was, you know, one night. You were upset about Josh, and I was there to warm your toes.",
        "Olivia: Oh, no, no. It was more than that. It was like when you held me in your arms... it was just what I needed.",
        "Buzz: God, me, too. It was Valentine's Day, you know, so...",
        "Olivia: So... so you feel the way that I do?",
        "Buzz: Absolutely. It's just... why ruin a beautiful friendship?",
        "Olivia: And I would. Because I do that; I ruin things.",
        "Buzz: Well, you'll get it right one of these days.",
        "Olivia: You're the best.",
        "Buzz: Are you referring to the other night or in general?",
        "Olivia: Just... both. Thank you.",
        "Frank: Olivia, good. Just the person I was hoping to see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Busted. Whatever you think I'm doing, I probably am.",
        "Marina: Well, it will never work. Harley's too smart to fall for it. But I like you for trying.",
        "Alan-Michael: Trying?",
        "Marina: To cover up Harley's mistake. It will all come out eventually, and when it does and she finds out that you didn't tell her, she'll be so mad at you. And in case you've forgotten, you don't want Harley mad at you.",
        "Alan-Michael: God forbid.",
        "Marina: Look, she's grieving, right? I mean, everyone will understand if it does comes out. You know what? I'll tell her. It should come from me. That way she can decide what she wants to do. You know, if she wants to stay or if she wants to take a break and let someone else run Spaulding for a bit. Would you consider doing it?",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't know, Marina.",
        "Marina: Come on. It would be great for the company. You would be so much better than Alan or Phillip ever were.",
        "Alan Michael: Thank you.",
        "Marina: All right. So you'll do it?",
        "Alan-Michael: Only if you help me keep my priorities straight.",
        "Marina: Well, I'll need the paperwork.",
        "Alan-Michael: You do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: So you're just going to sell it and walk away?",
        "Harley: What else can I do?",
        "Dinah: You can finish it.",
        "Harley: No. We designed the house together. I'd see him every day in every room, in every nook and cranny. This house is Gus. And he is gone.",
        "Dinah: You know, the love that the two of you had, that's the real kind. They call it the real deal, right? It's still here. In fact, it's right in there. You feel it?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: ( Coughs ) What are you doing, Beth? Are you threatening me?",
        "Beth: Threatening you? Gus, I'm the reason you're still alive. I pulled you in from the snow and not for the first time either.",
        "Gus: You keeping us here?",
        "Beth: I'm taking care of you.",
        "Gus: You locked us up?",
        "Beth: Yes. Yes, I did lock you in. But, Gus, that was because I knew you would try to do exactly what you did, which was go out there by yourself to get back to Harley, and I knew that would be suicide. You may have noticed, the snow really piled up up here in the mountains.",
        "Gus: It doesn't make sense.",
        "Beth: Of course it doesn't make any sense to you. Gus, you've been out of it since I brought you here. I think that between your injuries from the accident and the exposure, it was just too much for you. I also think you have a fever. So, of course, you're confused.",
        "Gus: So you're not keeping us a prisoner?",
        "Beth: Gus, the front door is unlocked. If you want to make a run for it, be my guest, but I'm not going after you again. There's only so much search-and- rescue a girl can take. Especially when there's no gratitude on the other end of it.",
        "Gus: Where were you? Where'd you go?",
        "Beth: Well, if you must know, I went on one of my treks to see if the roads are any better. And fyi: They're worse. We're trapped.",
        "Gus: Why don't I trust you?",
        "Beth: Well, I don't know, Gus. I really don't know. What was I thinking, huh? I should have just left you out there to freeze to death! Why didn't I do that?",
        "Gus: I'm sorry. I'm cloudy, you know. You're right. I wouldn't have made it out of that snow. So thank you, I guess.",
        "Beth: Well, it's okay, Gus. I really am just glad that I could help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: I can't stop thinking about Valentine's Day. You were so amazing.",
        "Olivia: It was something, wasn't it? Excuse me.",
        "Frank: Hey, listen, um... there's a new little jazz club opening up on Saturday night. It's off of Tioga and Main, and if you want, I can get us a really romantic table right up front.",
        "Olivia: This is such a busy time with my work and everything. Maybe we could do it some other time.",
        "Frank: Hey, Olivia, I know you have a thing for someone else, okay?",
        "Olivia: I'm trying to leave my options open.",
        "Frank: So is that a \"yes\"?",
        "Olivia: Boy, you're focused.",
        "Frank: Yes, I am. ( Cell phones )",
        "Olivia: Yes, it's a yes then.",
        "Frank: Sounds good. Excuse me one second here. You know what? I'm so sorry. Please hold that thought. I'll be right back. Cooper.",
        "Olivia: Um... oh, God. Listen, Buzz, your son just asked me to go...",
        "Buzz: I heard.",
        "Olivia: This is strange.",
        "Buzz: It doesn't have to be. We agreed upon it; we're friends.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, we're friends.",
        "Buzz: Let me ask you a question, okay?",
        "Olivia: Sure.",
        "Buzz: Straight question, straight answer.",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Buzz: You like Frank?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, of course I like Frank.",
        "Buzz: Then go for it.",
        "Olivia: But what about what happened?",
        "Buzz: Well, what about what happened? What happened didn't happen. Just forget it.",
        "Olivia: Will you?",
        "Buzz: Are you kidding? I'm never going to forget it. I'm going to play it over and over again in my head. But it didn't happen, okay? Never talk about it again.",
        "Olivia: You're the most wonderful man in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Harley lost the company millions, or almost did, because?",
        "Alan-Michael: She missed the deadline, a memo.",
        "Marina: For what?",
        "Alan-Michael: You have the most beautiful eyes. They change color in the light.",
        "Marina: You do have the documentation?",
        "Alan-Michael: No, I made the whole thing up so you wouldn't kiss me and make me want you.",
        "Marina: Where is it?",
        "Messenger: Mr. Spaulding, the documents you requested.",
        "Alan-Michael: Thank you.",
        "Marina: That isn't...",
        "Alan-Michael: I think we should bury it. Harley has been through enough.",
        "Marina: No, no. We agreed that we would do this and I would tell her. So give me the envelope.",
        "Alan-Michael: No. I can't do that to Harley.",
        "Marina: Yes, we can. Okay, let's say that you were the one that messed up, okay? Wouldn't you want to know before you screwed up again?",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't know. Okay, yes. But you're not doing this alone. I'm coming with you.",
        "Marina: Alan-Michael...",
        "Alan-Michael: March. We're in this together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Come on, Reva, you've never been shy before. Don't start now. If not Olivia, who am I supposed to send the flowers to?",
        "Reva: All I'm saying is that you haven't given yourself the chance to play the field.",
        "Josh: You want me to play the field?",
        "Reva: I want you to be happy. I'm sure there are a thousand women out there who would love to be with a man like you. Beautiful, intelligent, maybe even younger women.",
        "Josh: Did you even see me dating, Reva, when this whole thing started, when you began this quest or mid-life crisis or whatever it is? What did you see me doing exactly? What, sitting on a couch somewhere in front of a wide-screen tv with a bunch of guys eating chips and getting a beer belly and waiting for you to come home, was that it?",
        "Reva: Well, that'd be cute.",
        "Josh: Honestly, Reva, when you left, where was I?",
        "Reva: All I know is that you weren't with...",
        "Olivia: Josh, about the night, we need to get something straight...",
        "Reva: Don't let me stop you. Go ahead, Olivia, what about the other night?",
        "Olivia: Oh, wouldn't you like to know? Josh and I were up at this cute little inn...",
        "Josh: All right, enough already! Enough of all of this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I'll do it. You know, I'll do it. I'll fix this place up.",
        "Dinah: Good.",
        "Harley: I'll even make a few changes, you know, so the kids won't outgrow it.",
        "Dinah: I want in and I want to help you. I want to help you; I want to go shopping. I want to do these things. And besides, I think Mallet needs to know what it feels like to not have me at his beck and call. And I want to help you. I owe you.",
        "Marina: Harley.",
        "Harley: Hey, wait. I have news. I've been talking to Dinah here, and I decided I'm going to finish the house. And I think it can be finished by St. Patty's Day.",
        "Dinah: Or at least by April Fools.",
        "Harley: Or April Fools.",
        "Maria: That's great, but we have some news, too.",
        "Alan-Michael: Something happened at the office, but it's not a huge deal.",
        "Marina: Alan-Michael made a big save. It could've cost Spaulding millions of dollars.",
        "Alan-Michael: It's okay now.",
        "Harley: I don't understand. Who caused this mistake? Who screwed up?",
        "Marina: You did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Right. The beginning? New Year's Eve. After Alan was released, I saw him get into the town car and I saw that you were behind the wheel. I knew that that couldn't be good, so I decided to follow you. But, unfortunately, the roads were quite treacherous, you were driving very fast, and I lost you. And then I didn't know what to do because I... you know, I just had a bad feeling about it. But I didn't want to get the cops involved, so I just kept looking, and finally I did find where your car had gone off the road.",
        "Gus: So you're the one who found us?",
        "Beth: Not yet. You weren't there. So I started trudging around in the snow. And I have to tell you, Gus, I did not expect to find you or Alan alive. And truth be told, you practically were dead when I found you. But this is the truly amazing part. I can only explain this by saying, you know, when they say that a mother gets superhuman strength when her child is in danger? Well, that's what happened to me because I saw this cabin in the distance and I put you and Alan, one at a time, on my back and I dragged you here.",
        "Gus: We've been here for like a month.",
        "Beth: Yes, yes. Because by the time we got here, the blizzard had intensified, the snow was piling up and there was no way to get out!",
        "Gus: So you're trapped here, too?",
        "Beth: And here I stand. As much a prisoner as you and Alan. And if you think I'm happy about it, you can think again. The only good part about this is that whoever was here before us left this place stocked. There's enough food and water to last an entire winter.",
        "Gus: There has to be some way out of this place. I'm not just going to stay here, so...",
        "Beth: Gus, Gus, Gus. Come on now. You're hurt; you can't do this. You've got to take care of yourself. Here.",
        "Gus: I don't want them.",
        "Beth: No, I have these from an old tennis injury and they've helped you when you've been in pain. You have to have some memory of taking these and they helped you. Now, come on. Come on, Gus. Come on, come on. These are helping, helping. Good, good, good, good. You'll feel better in no time.",
        "Gus: Where's Alan?",
        "Beth: Oh, oh, jeez, speaking of Alan.",
        "Alan: Beth, it's so good to see you.",
        "Gus: My God, this is a setup.",

        "Reva: Wait a minute. I can't even figure out who you're mad at.",
        "Josh: Both of you! But mostly I'm mad at myself because every time you come here, I miss being with you. I miss us being together. And every time I'm with you, I like being with you. I have a good time. But the fact is both of you are a complete disaster in my life right now.",
        "Reva: So what do you want?",
        "Josh: I want stability, and I want honesty. I want to know where I stand and where I am and where I'm going. But most of all right now I just, I want to be alone so I can continue to get ready for work.",

        "Frank: What? You think Josh Lewis is stiff competition for me. Well, guess what? I'm not afraid of Josh Lewis, and you know why?",
        "Buzz: Why?",
        "Frank: Because I have a secret weapon.",
        "Buzz: What's that, Frank?",
        "Frank: I got you, Pop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: I'm so embarrassed. I made this huge mistake. I can't believe it.",
        "Dinah: Honey, look, you've been under a lot of pressure.",
        "Harley: No, don't... don't make excuses for me when it's something like this. This is bad. If he hadn't caught this... I don't know how to show you appreciation.",
        "Alan-Michael: You can let me help you get your life back on track.",
        "Harley: I don't even know what I want, really. I mean, maybe I should take some time off.",
        "Dinah: What are you talking about, leaving Spaulding?",
        "Harley: I mean, Dinah, look, obviously I'm useless right now. Look at this.",
        "Alan-Michael: Are you sure that's what you want to do?",
        "Harley: Yeah. Yeah, but don't worry, okay, because I have the perfect person in mind to keep an eye on things while I'm away.",
        "Alan-Michael: Don't look at me. I've got places to go; I've got trouble to get into.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, don't worry. I think I've imposed on you enough. Actually, I was thinking of my associate, Dinah Marler.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I knew I could count on you, Beth.",
        "Gus: You two are working together. You lied to me, Alan. You knew it was Beth all along, didn't you?",
        "Alan: I wish. This is the first I've learned of it. You saved our lives.",
        "Beth: I did. But I certainly wish I could have gotten you someplace where we weren't stranded.",
        "Alan: Well, you did the best you could, and we will make the most of this situation.",
        "Gus: What does that mean?",
        "Alan: It means that this little hijacking of me that you planned, Gus, is not going to pay off.",
        "Beth: I'm not sure I'm following you, Alan.",
        "Alan: New Year's Eve he kidnapped me with a plan to lock me away or murder me. Isn't that right, Gus?",
        "Gus: You were after my wife. You were the one who warned me, Beth, remember?",
        "Alan: Beth, Gus is not on your side. He never has been. I am your husband. We are a team, and together we can accomplish great things.",
        "Beth: Can we?",
        "Alan: Yes, but first we have to teach him a lesson. We need to lock him up, and you and I find a way to get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: ( Sighs )",
        "Reva: Now, you see, that's just not fair. They never ask Dracula to run the blood bank.",
        "Billy: And I'll tell you, vampires have it easy. They don't have to worry about their addiction at nighttime. Us alcoholics, it's 24/7.",
        "Reva: Same as ex-wives.",
        "Billy: You may be my ex-wife, but you're certainly not my brother's.",
        "Reva: Billy, would you alarmed if I told you that Josh has officially lost his mind?",
        "Billy: When did this happen?",
        "Reva: I'm not really sure, but he finally snapped.",
        "Billy: Did you go see him?",
        "Reva: You remember I told you about his plans for Valentine's Day?",
        "Billy: Yeah, he didn't have any plans.",
        "Reva: Yeah, but Olivia did. But the good news is that he is just as fed up with her.",
        "Billy: ( Laughing )",
        "Tess: Hey, Reva.",
        "Reva: Tess, hi! Billy... this is Billy Lewis. He's my brother-in-law. Well, I guess. Tess and I worked on a piece together for my show.",
        "Tess: Reva, I wanted to ask you something. It might be a little awkward.",
        "Reva: Well, I've had nothing but awkward today, so go for it.",
        "Tess: I know you and Josh are separated. How would you feel about me asking him out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Pop, will you coach me? Could you coach me, seriously? Help me get my edge back? Olivia is so hard to pin down, and you know her better than anybody.",
        "Buzz: Why me, Frank?",
        "Frank: Because you guys are friends. She trusts you, she opens up to you, Dad. I've seen the two of you together. Come on! Pop?",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Frank: Will you help me? I've got this feeling. I haven't had this feeling in a long, long time. Olivia could be the one. Can I count on you, Dad?",
        "Buzz: You can count on me, Frank.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I will do everything I can to help.",
        "Harley: You help me every day, more than you know?",
        "Marina: Well, what about Alan-Michael? I mean, he's the one who found the mistake.",
        "Harley: Well, part of Dinah's responsibilities will be to keep an eye on Alan- Michael, make sure he's not working too hard. Come on. I have leaned on you enough already.",
        "Alan-Michael: Look, I'm all for Dinah taking on more responsibility.",
        "Harley: Good. I'm glad we're done here.",
        "Alan-Michael: But I think the board might have a problem with that.",
        "Harley: Well, why would they? I mean, they already know that she's my right arm. And she won't be making any really big responsibilities... decision- making on her own. You'll have a raise, obviously, and a title change.",
        "Marina: This will be good. I mean, if you had all of the responsibilities, it'd be no fun. You'd be living and breathing that company.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're right.",
        "Harley: You're still with me, right?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, babe, I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm not going to let you down, promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: You two have a fight on your hands if you think you're going to take me down. I don't care how weak I am.",
        "Beth: Relax. Nobody is locking anybody up.",
        "Alan: You're making a mistake, Beth.",
        "Beth: No, you are. I saved you both for a reason, and it's not so you can go on trying to kill each other.",
        "Gus: You're not on his side?",
        "Beth: Side? Gus, we're all in this together. We are stuck here until the snow melts, and, trust me, that could be a while.",
        "Alan: Trust you?",
        "Beth: Yes. Trust me, Alan. I saved your life. Now, I have looked for a way out of here. If there was one, I would have found it by now.",
        "Gus: There's a phone. I used it. I called Company. I got Zach on the phone. We can call somebody.",
        "Beth: Gus, Gus... was it this cell phone? I'm sorry, Gus, I don't mean to burst your bubble, but this has been dead for weeks. I wasted the battery when we first got up here trying to call out.",
        "Alan: So you're saying that we are stranded here?",
        "Beth: Now you're catching on. This isn't fun for any of us. You two need medical attention, and we all want to get back to our families, and we will get back. But we need to stay calm, and we need to stick together. Can we do that?",
        "Gus: Sure.",
        "Beth: Good. Then we should all be just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: So I was going to set up a meeting with him to discuss the eco-friendly super center on Blue Ridge, and I thought while we were talking business...",
        "Reva: Hey, no, really, it's fine. It's... like you said, Josh and I are separated, and I have no claims on the man. So go, do it.",
        "Tess: Cool.",
        "Reva: Yeah, cool.",
        "Tess: I'll see you later then.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Billy: Well, that was big of you.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, Josh was very clear. And who am I to argue, right?",
        "Billy: If you say so.",
        "Reva: She's pretty, huh?",
        "Billy: I didn't even notice because you blow her right out of the water, girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: I was never around you when you were a kid. I left you alone to fend for yourselves. It was always what I wanted, what I needed. God, I want this woman so much. But you come first, Frank. I love you more, but I want this woman. But I love you more, Frank.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I'm a little wigged out.",
        "Harley: It's not too much work, is it?",
        "Dinah: No, no, I'm not afraid of work.",
        "Harley: Well, you won't have to make any really big decisions on your own. I'll be constantly in touch with you. You'll have Alan-Michael to lean on.",
        "Dinah: Right. Yeah, I just hope I don't blow it, you know? Are you sure you're okay with making peanut butter sandwiches? Is that going to be enough for you, sticking in this house?",
        "Harley: All I know is I want to finish what we started. This house was our dream. We stayed here while we were on the run. Did I ever tell you that?",
        "Dinah: No.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. We held each other right here. You know, Gus may be gone, but you're right, what you said, the dream can live on. And that's what I want for now. I just want the dream.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Well, my wife probably thinks I'm dead.",
        "Beth: Gus, I've got news for you. We're all dead up here. But we don't have to look at this as a completely negative thing.",
        "Gus: Why? You think it's a good thing if the people who love you think your dead? That's a positive, right?",
        "Beth: No, but we could use this time to reevaluate our lives, think of things that we wish we could change, make amends for.",
        "Alan: Like what?",
        "Beth: Mistakes, ways that you may have hurt other people.",
        "Gus: Me, I'm sorry that I got involved with anything with you. Protecting my wife; now I got to end up in this crudhole.",
        "Beth: And what about you, Alan?",
        "Alan: What about me, Beth?",
        "Beth: There must be something that you're sorry for.",
        "Alan: I can't think of anything at the moment, but I'll get back to you.",
        "Beth: Ooh! Wow! That just slipped right out of my hands. I guess I'm going to have to find another bowl to make you guys lunch in. You must be starving, huh?",
        "Alan: Beth...",
        "Beth: No, I'm fine. You don't have to thank me, really. I just want to take care of you.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Blake: You're in love with Mallet, aren't you? Dinah. Yeah.",
        "Harley: And I don't want to grieve anymore. I have to get on to my new life.",
        "Gus: What about that phone?",
        "Beth: Gus, the phone is dead! Do you understand English? Why do you insist on questioning everything I say?"
