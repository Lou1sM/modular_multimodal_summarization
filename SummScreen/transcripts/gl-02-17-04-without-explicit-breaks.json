    "Transcript": [
        "Marina: Okay, you guys, I really don't think that Carrie was here. Shayne and I would have heard her.",
        "Michelle: You didn't hear us banging on the door.",
        "Marah: Yeah, I don't get it. When Carrie wants us to meet her, she lets us know it. Why would she send us a phony message from you?",
        "Marina: I don't know. Because she's a drama queen?",
        "Marah: Yeah, but this is not her style, and we still don't know why she sent us here.",
        "Michelle: Oh, no.",
        "Marina: What? What?",
        "Michelle: Carrie, she wanted us out. She wanted us away from the Country Club.",
        "Josh: It's you. You're the one who's been going after my daughter.",
        "Carrie: I don't think this is the place for us to have this conversation.",
        "Josh: But who are you? What's your name?",
        "Carrie: I think we should go someplace a little more private. I think you should speak to your brother and the rest of your friends and ask them to join us.",
        "Jeffrey: Friend of yours?",
        "Reva: Her? No.",
        "Jeffrey: Reva, letting some strange woman dance with your husband?",
        "Reva: You know something, Jeffrey? She is strange, and I got the weirdest vibe from her when I shook her hand.",
        "Jeffrey: Really?",
        "Reva: Okay, time's up, lady.",
        "Alexandra: Excuse me, Beth?",
        "Beth: She's gone. She was supposed to stay at that teen party in the next room.",
        "Alexandra: All right, don't panic, Beth. She's probably in the ladies' room or something.",
        "Beth: No, she's not. I checked there. She's not there.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on. She's got to be around here somewhere. Let's go take another look.",
        "Beth: (Sighs)",
        "Alexandra: Come on.",
        "Lizzie: We need help. Please.",
        "Lillian: Lizzie?",
        "Buzz: What now?",
        "Billy: I'm going to go round up Josh.",
        "Alan: No, no, no, no, Billy. We don't need him here to tell us what to do.",
        "Billy: That's right, Alan. We've got you to tell us what to do.",
        "Alan: Look, it's not rocket science here, guys. All we have to do is go back in there, find this woman -- whoever she is -- and bring her somewhere private.",
        "Ed: Then what?",
        "Alan: Find out what she wants with us... and what we can do for her.",
        "Carrie: Are you familiar with an old tree right off the third green? I think that would be a perfect place for a private conversation.",
        "Reva: Hey, thank you so much for taking such good care of my husband.",
        "Carrie: Oh, I assure you it was my pleasure.",
        "Reva: Joshua, I would love a refill on my drink, if you don't mind. Joshua?",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Drink? Refill?",
        "Josh: Yes. And you'll stay here.",
        "Reva: Yes. She mentioned she was a fan. Is that what you said? You are a fan, right?",
        "Carrie: I am a fan.",
        "Reva: Yes. (Laughs)",
        "Josh: Excuse me, I'll be right back.",
        "Reva: Uh, sweetie, you forgot my...",
        "Carrie: Men. How quickly they forget. ( Laughs)",
        "Rick: Let's go. All right, a drug screen for toxins before we do anything else. Easy. Let's get him on the...",
        "Lillian: Careful, careful.",
        "Rick: It's all right, we're going to do everything we can to help you.",
        "Lillian: It'll be okay.",
        "Rick: Let's get him covered up. Come on.",
        "Lillian: What happened?",
        "Lizzie: Well, Jeremy was bringing us home from the Country Club, and we dropped off one of my friends, and then we just saw Nico wandering around. He was out of it, Nana. We couldn't just leave him like that.",
        "Lillian: I have to call Michelle and Danny. Oh, good, Beth, it's me. I think you better come down here right now. ER.",
        "Rick: What did he take?",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Rick: What did he take? His pupils are dilating, and he's hallucinating. What did he take? What is he on, Lizzie? We don't have time for games. I need to know what the man took so I can help him.",
        "Lizzie: We went to a party, and I had a drink and a guy put something in it. He drank it.",
        "Rick: What was it, Lizzie? Just tell me.",
        "Lizzie: I don't know! He said something like, \"the D train,\" or...",
        "Rick: It's Delirium.",
        "Lizzie: Please help him.",
        "Lillian: Danny, it's Lillian Raines. Um... I'm calling about Nico. He was just brought into the Emergency Room.",
        "Danny: Excuse me. What happened? Is he okay?",
        "Lillian: Rick is getting him stabilized right now, but it looks like drugs might be involved.",
        "Danny: No, no, that's impossible. Is Michelle with him?",
        "Lillian: No, she's not on the schedule tonight.",
        "Danny: She got a call to go in.",
        "Lillian: Oh, really? I didn't know about that, but I haven't seen her yet.",
        "Danny: All right, I'll be right there.",
        "Michelle: My dad, your dad, Buzz, Billy, even Alan, they're all at the Country Club. Carrie wanted us out so she could get to them.",
        "Marina: Yeah, but Carrie doesn't go out in public.",
        "Michelle: That's because we've been doing her dirty work for her.",
        "Marah: But then we said, \"game over.\"",
        "Marina: Okay, guys, we better get over there.",
        "Shayne: Wait. You better get over where?",
        "Marina: Um, to... to the Country Club! Where the dance is.",
        "Shayne: Right. The dance is almost over right now.",
        "Marina: Yeah, exactly. So, you know what? You don't have to go.",
        "Shayne: No, no, I'll go.",
        "Marina: No, but you're not even dressed for it.",
        "Shayne: Well, neither are you.",
        "Marina: The thing is, I've got to go over with Marah and Michelle to...",
        "Michelle: To clean up!",
        "Marah: Collect an award!",
        "Marina: I really cleaned up in the crisis center.",
        "Michelle: Marina's, like, our best volunteer.",
        "Shayne: I didn't even know you were volunteering.",
        "Marah: Shayne, we don't have time for this!",
        "Shayne: What is going on?",
        "Josh: The witness is here.",
        "Billy: Yeah, we think she is.",
        "Josh: No, I'm not saying I think she's here; I know she's here. She made it a point of dancing with me.",
        "Buzz: Me, too.",
        "Alan: You both danced with this person, and we don't know who she is?",
        "Buzz: There wasn't time, Alan.",
        "Ed: Then how can we be sure who we're dealing with?",
        "Josh: She told me she knows Marah, that she met her at Cutter's Bridge.",
        "Buzz: Did she happen to say what she wanted from us?",
        "Josh: No, no, Reva came back before I had a chance to get that far, but she wants to meet with us. She said something about the old tree by the third green.",
        "Alan: Wow. Well, then let's go talk.",
        "Josh: (Sighs)",
        "Alan: What's the matter, gentlemen? There are five of us, one of her. What's she going to do?",
        "Carrie: Well, you're staring, Mrs. Lewis, and I know that you would never be intentionally rude.",
        "Reva: I am sorry, but you really can't blame me. Your ring is exquisite. May I?",
        "Carrie: Exactly the same as it was before.",
        "Reva: I know. Humor me.",
        "Carrie: There now. Well, I'm afraid I really must be going.",
        "Reva: Is it an antique?",
        "Carrie: Yes. Now, if you'll excuse me.",
        "Reva: And its origin is... It looks Egyptian.",
        "Carrie: Well, you know, I really don't know. It's been in my family for generations. Well, it was a great pleasure to meet you.",
        "Reva: You know, I loaned you my husband. Asking a few questions about your jewelry shouldn't be so out of line.",
        "Carrie: Oh, well, you're absolutely right. I believe it belonged to my great- grandmother, and I was told that she picked it up in Venice. Well, when we meet again, Mrs. Lewis, you may take all of the time you want with it, but now I'm afraid I have some rather tedious business to attend to.",
        "Reva: Business? At a party? My, my. All work and no play.",
        "Carrie: Yes, I know. Good-bye.",
        "Alexandra: Well, if ever a woman needed a stylist, eh? (Laughs) Well, I'm not talking about you, for heaven's sakes, Reva. I'm talking about that wisp of a woman whose... you were just chatting with, the one who stole your husband away earlier.",
        "Reva: What, have you had her under surveillance all night, Alex?",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) Actually, only... only after she cut in on Buzz and me. Shameless, isn't it?",
        "Reva: You didn't happen to catch what her name was, did you?",
        "Alexandra: No, actually I did not. She says she's a Spaulding stockholder and that I met her in Paris, but I don't recall. However, I do know the kind of woman she is.",
        "Reva: What kind of woman is that?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, she's lonely, eccentric, woman of a certain age.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Well, well. You don't say.",
        "Alexandra: Reva, at least I came here with someone, didn't I?",
        "Reva: Uh-huh.",
        "Alexandra: And that kind of woman has nothing better to do than to attend charity events and sample men, just like at a wine tasting.",
        "Reva: Where is Buzz, anyway? Running away?",
        "Alexandra: No, he was right... Well, where's Josh?",
        "Reva: He went to get me another drink.",
        "Alexandra: Uh-huh. My goodness. Could we possibly have something in common?",
        "Billy: Where you going?",
        "Josh: I left Reva with that woman. I have to get back inside.",
        "Billy: Look, Reva can take care of herself. Besides, what's that woman going to do in a public place?",
        "Josh: I've seen what this woman is capable of with... with our girls, Billy. I don't want to take any chances.",
        "Alan: Josh, it might be worth the risk.",
        "Josh: Oh, really, Alan? How is that?",
        "Alan: Think about it. Reva has a psychic gift. Now, if she spent a little time with this woman, maybe she would see something that would be useful for us.",
        "Ed: Or maybe she'd see what we've been hiding for thirty years.",
        "Josh: She's already had visions of me in the water.",
        "Alexandra: Ooh! It is freezing out here! What are you all doing out here?",
        "Reva: And what are you all doing together?",
        "Alan: Well, we could ask you two the same question.",
        "Alexandra: We happen to be looking for our dates.",
        "Reva: Right.",
        "Buzz: Uh, and now you've found us.",
        "Billy: Yeah, and we're all indulging in a little guy talk.",
        "Reva: \"Guy talk?\"",
        "Billy: Yeah, you know, football, power tools, and how much we hate dressing up for these things.",
        "Reva: Well, then loosen your ties, boys, and come back inside. You, too, Billy.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, come on. You, too. Oh.",
        "Marina: Okay, you guys, we have, like, two minutes before Shayne comes back with our coats. I say we split up, we find the guys.",
        "Michelle: Look, look, look, look.",
        "Marah: They're fine. They're all fine.",
        "Marina: You guys, we are so paranoid.",
        "Michelle: Thanks to Carrie.",
        "Marah: She's probably at home polishing her stupid rings.",
        "Michelle: Good. Well, we'll let her stay there. What do you think about that note, though?",
        "Marah: Do you know what? Carrie's just bitter because we're not doing what she wants us to do anymore.",
        "Marina: I know. I know, she probably gave us those fake notes just to ruin our Valentine's Day.",
        "Michelle: Well, we're not going to let her, right?",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Marina: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Marah: What?",
        "Marina: Do you guys realize we just dumped our coats on top of a guy with crutches so we could rush in here?",
        "Marah: (Gasps) Shayne! Oh, no.",
        "Billy: Alan, what time is it? All right, you guys take your lead from me, okay?",
        "(Leaves rustling, wind blowing)",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Marah: Look at you two crazy kids.",
        "Reva: Hey! You know, where have you been?",
        "Marah: I've been around.",
        "Reva: \"Around.\"",
        "Marah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Reva: Would you give us a moment so that we can have some girl talk?",
        "Josh: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Reva: Okay. Oh, and don't go too far. I've already lost you once tonight.",
        "Josh: Right.",
        "Marah: What did I do?",
        "Reva: You didn't do anything.",
        "Marah: So why the sudden urge for girl talk?",
        "Reva: Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Marah: (Groans)",
        "Reva: You said you were around tonight, and I just happened to see you \"around\" with Jeffrey before.",
        "Marah: There is nothing going on with Jeffrey and I, and I even cringe to use the phrase \"Jeffrey and I,\" because there is nothing between us. So, you feel better now?",
        "Reva: Well...",
        "Marah: So, what's the deal with you and Dad?",
        "Reva: Wow. That was a subject change. Subtle.",
        "Marah: No, really. I want to know. How have things been tonight?",
        "Reva: Everything's been fine.",
        "Marina: Oh, hey.",
        "Shayne: All right, so you guys rushed in here because what? You were trying to...",
        "Marina: We were just so excited to get inside. Anyway, I'm so sorry that we left you with all the coats.",
        "Shayne: Thank you. I love a challenge.",
        "Marina: Hey, so -- I don't know -- what do you say we go out on the dance floor and win the award for Worst Dressed Couple? Let's go.",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Marina: Make room for us younguns?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Shayne, it so wonderful to see you up and around.",
        "Shayne: Thank you. Thanks.",
        "Marina: So, how are you? How are you, Grandpa? You having fun?",
        "Buzz: Oh, you bet, yeah.",
        "Marina: Good. You deserve it.",
        "Buzz: Right back at you, kiddo.",
        "Shayne: What is up with you and Buzz?",
        "Marina: Oh, nothing. Well, okay, I mean, we're... we're kind of having issues. You know, I've been a less-than-perfect granddaughter lately.",
        "Shayne: I don't buy that.",
        "Marina: No, no, I have. It's true. You know, I didn't trust him when I should have had faith in him, so I'm trying to find a way to make it up to him.",
        "Shayne: Guess what?",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Shayne: We're dancing.",
        "Ed: What's that for?",
        "Michelle: Oh, just because.",
        "Jeremy: I'm going to get some coffee. You want anything?",
        "Lillian: Lizzie? I love you, honey.",
        "Lizzie: You don't have to be nice to me, Nana. I know you're mad.",
        "Lillian: Oh, honey. Nothing in the world makes a parent or a grandparent more angry than having to worry.",
        "Lizzie: Let's see; now, I've heard that from you and Mom and Dad and Grandpa, and even Cook gave me that whole, \"don't worry us\" talking.",
        "Lillian: I just wonder about some of your choices. I mean, your mom let you go to the Country Club party on your own. That was a big deal.",
        "Lizzie: How do you know that I didn't go?",
        "Lillian: (Laughs) I'm not stupid, but I also heard from Rick that you went to an outside party where they were doing drugs, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, thanks, Uncle Rick. Nana, I could not have stayed at that Country Club. It was so...",
        "Lillian: Boring?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. I just made the wrong choices, again.",
        "Lillian: Honey, everybody makes the wrong choices sometimes.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but...",
        "Lillian: Do you think I haven't made the wrong choices?",
        "Lizzie: No, not the same as me.",
        "Lillian: (Laughs bitterly) Not very different. I'm going to tell you something. When I was your age, there was this really wonderful boy who was about a year older, and he was... he was just absolutely, madly in love with me. And he was the kind of boy, you know, that your parents would love when you bring him home, but I wasn't the least bit interested, because I was far more attracted to the dark, complicated, troubled men.",
        "Lizzie: You?",
        "Lillian: Yes, me. And it caused me a lot of heartache. I mean, your mother's real father was one of those boys. I made a lot of mistakes because of this pattern, and I just don't want to see you going down the same roads that I went down.",
        "Nurse: Lillian? Phone.",
        "Lillian: To be continued. So far.",
        "Danny: Lillian?",
        "Lillian: Oh, he's going to be fine. He's going to be fine. Rick gave him something to counteract the drug in his system.",
        "Danny: Is he... is he in there? Can I... can I see him?",
        "Lillian: Only when Rick gives you the okay.",
        "Danny: (Sighs) Drugs?",
        "Lillian: When he came in here, it was really scary. I mean, he was hallucinating. He was so frightened. It could have been much worse.",
        "Danny: That doesn't make any sense. Nico's not into drugs. I would know if he were.",
        "Beth: Well, take it from the mother of a teenager, you can never be sure what they're into.",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Michelle: Danny. Hey, where are you?",
        "Danny: Where am I? Where are you? I'm at Cedars, and you're not.",
        "Michelle: Why are you at the hospital?",
        "Danny: It's Nico. He... It's something to do with drugs. But what's going on? Where are you?",
        "Michelle: I'll explain later. I'm on my way, okay? Bye.",
        "Ed: Is everything all right?",
        "Michelle: Um, yeah, I've got to go. Thank you so much for coming, Dad.",
        "Ed: Oh, sure.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I can explain.",
        "Beth: I don't want to hear it, Lizzie. You lied to me.",
        "Lizzie: No, it's not what you think.",
        "Beth: Well, it sure isn't what you told your grandmother, is it? That you just happened to be passing by and you saw Nico stumbling down the street? Please.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't say he was stumbling!",
        "Beth: Okay, then let's go back a little bit, shall we? Let's go back to the part before you lied to your grandmother, the part where you left the Country Club without telling anyone.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Mom, can we please not do this now? Not while Nico is still in here, okay?",
        "Alan: Well, nice of you to join us, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: It was your sister, Alan. She's keeping close tabs on me.",
        "Billy: Well, I want to know who's been keeping tabs on this mystery woman. Has anybody seen her since Josh did? Josh, are you sure this is the place she said?",
        "Josh: Yes, this is the place.",
        "Alan: All right, well, then where the hell is she?!",
        "Carrie: Still impatient after all these years, Mr. Spaulding? I thought perhaps you'd learn by now that patience is a virtue.",
        "Alan: Who the hell are you, and what do you want with us?",
        "Carrie: Well, that is really no way to treat a lady. But then, none of you have ever known how to treat a lady, have you? Perhaps if you had, a certain young woman might be alive today. Well, gentlemen... gentlemen, you look very stunned. I haven't seen you look like this in all of the years that I've been watching you. Yes, I've been watching you. I've been watching you since the night that you left Maryanne Caruthers to drown in that river.",
        "Danny: Rick?",
        "Rick: Yeah?",
        "Danny: Is he okay? Did you figure out what...?",
        "Rick: It's a drug called Delirium. It's known as \"D\" on the streets. I've seen a couple cases in ER recently.",
        "Danny: Okay. Can I go in now?",
        "Rick: Yeah, go ahead. Oh, and by the way, I don't think Nico took this drug on purpose. Lizzie told me that she believes that his drink was spiked, so I just want to let you know.",
        "Danny: Okay. All right, thanks Rick.",
        "Nico: Oh, man.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Hey, there.",
        "Nico: I know what you're going to say, so just say it. I'm a loser. I shouldn't be taking drugs. What was I thinking?",
        "Danny: Actually, I was going to ask you how you're feeling?",
        "Nico: Oh.",
        "Danny: Hey. I know that you didn't intentionally take that drug, so why don't you tell me who did this to you and I'll take care of it?",
        "Nico: No one did.",
        "Danny: You're a part of this family now, and I'm responsible for you.",
        "Nico: No one did.",
        "Danny: Do you know who did this? You don't have to protect anyone.",
        "Nico: I did it to myself, okay, Danny? Look, thanks for having all the faith in me, but you shouldn't.",
        "Danny: So you're telling me you intentionally went out and got high tonight?",
        "Nico: I heard that \"D\" expands your mind on music, so I wanted to try it. And at first it was real good. Then everything started turning bad, and I felt like... like I was jumping out of my skin. Look, I swear I'm never going to do it again, okay? It was stupid.",
        "Beth: Let's tally this up, Lizzie. First you lied to me about going to the party. Then you lied to your grandmother about what you did after you left. And you even tried to get Jeremy to lie for you.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I'm sorry, okay?",
        "Beth: No. No, no, no, no, no. That is not going to cut it this time. You ever want me to trust you again? You need to come clean right now.",
        "Lizzie: Mom, what happened to Nico could happen to me. That drink was meant for me, and I saw how that drug reacted on him. And could you imagine if somebody like me got that? He's not crazy like me. Mom, if I had gotten a hold of that, anything could have happened. (Crying)",
        "Reva: You know, you're so worried about your dad and me. What's up with you? Are you okay?",
        "Marah: Ooh, I feel another subject change coming on.",
        "Reva: No, no. Ooh, lovely. Thank you. I just want you to find someone that makes you happy, someone that you can have fun with.",
        "Marah: And...?",
        "Reva: And if that person happens to be Jeffrey, then...",
        "Marah: You're going to hunt him down like a dog?",
        "Reva: I won't stand in your way.",
        "Marah: Really? Wow. But you... you don't have to worry.",
        "Reva: So there really isn't anything going on with you two?",
        "Marah: Nothing other than a giant emotional wall. Every time I feel like I'm getting closer to him, he pulls away and closes off again.",
        "Reva: I know the feeling.",
        "Marah: Well, I thought you and Dad were doing great tonight.",
        "Reva: Well, yeah. I mean, we've had some fun. And the only time I felt like he was pushing me away was when someone forced the issue. This woman snagged your dad for a dance with her.",
        "Marah: What woman?",
        "Reva: Well, I don't know. I didn't catch her name, but she had the most incredible scarab ring.",
        "Carrie: My name is Caroline Caruthers. Maryanne Caruthers was my niece. I am the only living member of her family. I am the only witness to her death -- except, of course, for you. Your children have said that you all have been looking for me.",
        "Ed: You had no right to involve our daughters. Your business is with us.",
        "Carrie: All I did was tell them the truth about you. What harm is that?",
        "Billy: \"What harm?\"",
        "Josh: Are you suggesting you didn't try to hurt them?",
        "Carrie: Well, I know how really helpless you all must feel. I can sympathize. I felt helpless the night that I had to stand and watch my beautiful little niece drown in that river. She would have been almost the same age as your daughter Michelle, Dr. Bauer.",
        "Buzz: If you were there, why didn't you go to the cops? Why did you wait for thirty years? Why did you do that?",
        "Carrie: Because it's really very simple. I only recognized one of you. Mr. Spaulding, of the rich and powerful Spaulding family, who pulls all of the strings in this town. Your family has destroyed mine. There was every reason to believe that you might destroy me, too. I was afraid.",
        "Josh: But you're not anymore.",
        "Carrie: I'm not afraid of anything anymore.",
        "Billy: Why don't you just let the past be in the past?",
        "Carrie: I'm not as good at burying the past as the rest of you. Did any of you ever once look back at that river after you walked away?",
        "Alan: Why don't you just tell us what it's going to take to make you disappear? How much?",
        "Carrie: You've bought your way out of trouble all of your life, Mr. Spaulding. Well, this is one reckoning that money won't buy.",
        "Ed: She wants us to make our peace with our families.",
        "Carrie: Oh, guess again.",
        "Josh: You want us to turn ourselves in? We can do that, as long as you guarantee you'll stay away from our girls.",
        "Carrie: Would anyone like to hazard another guess?",
        "Buzz: What is it you want?",
        "Carrie: I want my niece back. But, of course, you can't do that for me, can you? So I think I'm going to have to ask for something... for something that is a little... a little dearer to your hearts.",
        "(Rustling sounds)",
        "Billy: I think you're taking a big risk showing up here, spouting demands.",
        "Carrie: What risk? I've told you all of my demands. What risk?",
        "Billy: Five of us, one of you. Believe me lady, we could end this right here and now.",
        "Carrie: Oh, but you won't.",
        "Alan: And why not?",
        "Carrie: Because you don't have to. Beside, I'm not here to threaten you. I'm only here to, shall we say, extend an invitation?",
        "Ed: What invitation?",
        "Carrie: You will meet me the night after tomorrow at the old fairgrounds. Remember the old fairgrounds? I think you know the way. After all, that's where this tragedy began. It's only right that that's where it should finish.",
        "Josh: No. I don't know about these other guys, but I, for one, do not accept your invitation.",
        "Ed: Josh, wait a minute. Wait a minute, man. Look, if this is what it takes to end it.",
        "Josh: No, no.",
        "Ed: Come on.",
        "Josh: No, she has been leading our daughters along for months. I am not going to fall into line this easily. I want assurances.",
        "Billy: Yeah, I want assurances, too.",
        "Buzz: We all do.",
        "Ed: How can we be sure that you will leave our children alone?",
        "Carrie: Well, you can't. The only assurance you will have is if you come to the fairgrounds. Oh, do, gentlemen, do come to the fair. I can promise you that's where it will all end. Good evening.",
        "(Leaves rustling under their feet)",
        "Marah: What did the lady with the ring look like?",
        "Reva: Uh, she was older, blonde...",
        "Marah: And she was dancing with dad?",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I guess he wasn't the only one. She was making the rounds.",
        "Marah: Well, who else?",
        "Reva: I didn't check her dance card, Marah.",
        "Marah: Who, Mom, who?",
        "Reva: Alexandra mentioned something about her dancing with Buzz, too. Why are you so interested?",
        "Marah: Because, it's just, it's rude.",
        "Marina: Um, you know what Marah? I, I've got to go to the ladies' room.",
        "Marah: Yeah, I'll come with you.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Marah: Marina, Carrie is here.",
        "Marina: Yeah, I know, I heard.",
        "Marah: Do you see her now?",
        "Marina: No. You know who else I don't see? My grandfather.",
        "Marah: My dad's gone, too.",
        "Marina: (Sigh)",
        "Marah: Let's go.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, Nico. Look, um, I just wanted to tell you thank you for looking out for me tonight, and uh, I don't know, thank you.",
        "Nico: You're welcome.",
        "Lizzie: (Gasps) Oh, my gosh, you're awake!",
        "Nico: Yeah, I was just keeping my eyes closed to keep Danny off my case.",
        "Lizzie: You gave me a heart attack. I didn't expect that.",
        "Nico: Well, I guess we're in the perfect place.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, stop!",
        "Nico: (Grunt)",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my gosh, you're in the hospital, and I'm hitting you. I'm sorry!",
        "Nico: Well, I got you. I'm tough. You can do it again if you want.",
        "Lizzie: Why are you being so nice to me? I don't get it, you told me that Blade was bad, and...",
        "Nico: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: And did I listen?",
        "Nico: No.",
        "Lizzie: Of course, not. I screwed everything up.",
        "Nico: But you got me here. That's what counts.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, big deal.",
        "Nico: It is a big deal. You could've bailed on me, but... but you didn't. You saved me. Thanks. Thanks for having my back.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you.",
        "Michelle: Hey, how's Nico?",
        "Danny: Where have you... He's fine, he's... Rick's taking care of him. Where the hell have you been?",
        "Michelle: Oh, I got my pages mixed up. It was the clinic, not the hospital. But, uh, you said, tell me about Nico. I mean, was it drugs or...",
        "Danny: I don't know. He claims that he wanted to experiment with this drug, Delirium.",
        "Michelle: What? Nico did \"D\"?",
        "Danny: No, I think someone spiked his drink. He won't tell me who. He's protecting someone.",
        "Michelle: But why? That person should be locked up.",
        "Danny: He's not protecting them from the cops, honey, he's protecting them from me.",
        "Michelle: But you're not going to do anything. Danny?",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: You're not going to do anything, you're going to let the police handle this, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know, Michelle, I know.",
        "Josh: All I'm saying is we can choose to go to the cops now.",
        "Alan: No, Josh, no cops.",
        "Ed: Alan, she's setting us up.",
        "Billy: What is she going to do? Five of us, one of her.",
        "Buzz: I just want this damn thing over with.",
        "Alan: Oh, it'll be over soon, one way or the other.",
        "Marah: Did you see her? Were you with her just now?",
        "Josh: Yeah, we had a little talk with your \"friend,\" Carrie.",
        "Marina: Okay and?",
        "Buzz: And there's nothing to worry about. We've got it all taken care of.",
        "Marina: What does that mean?",
        "Josh: It means we apologized, and she accepted. And that's it, that's all she wanted. She wanted to hear the words, she wanted us to take responsibility, and now she's promised us that she will leave town. She got what she wanted, now she's going to go away.",
        "Marah: That's it? Just like that? I don't believe her.",
        "Josh: Well, we do believe her. We talked to her. It's over sweetheart, that's it.",
        "(Car engine turns over)",
        "Carrie: Take me to the old fairgrounds. I have work to do."
