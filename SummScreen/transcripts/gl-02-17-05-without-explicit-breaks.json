        "Olivia: Alan, I hate the thought of you in jail for another hour, let alone another day. It's just, I'm on the other line with your attorney right now. Sit tight. I will get you out very soon. Bye. That was more fun than i thought.",
        "Bill: Don't you have to get back to the lawyer on the other line?",
        "Olivia: What lawyer?",
        "Bill: You are very, very naughty.",
        "Olivia: I am very, very, very naughty. Alan is in jail, I get to run spaulding. Have I told you what a turn-on that is?",
        "Bill: If I say no, will you tell me again?",
        "Olivia: Better yet, I'll show you. It's a turn-on.",
        "Bill: How long are you going to keep this up, hmm?",
        "Olivia: How long have you got?",
        "Bill: I'm talking about alan sitting in jail.",
        "Olivia: Oh, god. As long as humanly possible. He deserves it after what he did to me at ravenwood. Besides, I like having this office all to myself.",
        "Bill: Um, funny you should mention that, because I have someone coming by here. I need a little privacy. It's not going to take long, but I just wanted to avoid the press.",
        "Olivia: Avoid the press?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: Who are you bringing over here? ( Knock on door )",
        "Holly: You're not sebastian. You don't exist. So just go. Go.",
        "Sebastian: It's really me.",

Yes and a hope they haven't plofd it... moved it because the plaza is there too and a made reservations for this weekend.",
        "Blake: Why this? Why now?",
        "Ross: Why not? Can't a husband be romantic without having his motives questioned?",
        "Blake: You tell me.",
        "Ross: This gesture is more than hearts and flowers and lust. It's also an apology.",
        "Blake: Ah. For being my mother's confidante and telling me not to press her about sebastian's death.",
        "Ross: So then, we're square?",
        "Blake: Not so fast, bucko. I can't be bought that easily.",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry, dinah- mite, you look beautiful just the way you are.",
        "Dinah: Scram, jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: That's not how you were talking to me last night when I had you in bed. Or this morning.",
        "Dinah: Well, we're not in bed any longer, and I'm meeting someone.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. I guess you don't have time to hear news that could leave you happily ever after with prince charming, but that's fine by me. You could have saved me a lot of pain if you finished what you started years ago!",
        "Cassie: Edmund. Edmund, edmund! Are you okay?",
        "Edmund: Yes, fine. Fine.",
        "Cassie: Are you sure? I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you what happened with jonathan the night before our wedding. I caused you a lot of unnecessary worrying.",
        "Edmund: No. You didn't, cassie. You didn't, and it's over, please. I have to get to towers for a meeting. Excuse me.",
        "Cassie: Excuse me. I love you.",
        "Edmund: Same.",
        "Cassie: Same. Okay. ( Knock on door )",
        "Reva: Cassie, where's edmund?",
        "Cassie: Uh, he's not here. I'm surprised that you didn't see him.",
        "Reva: Did he go out the back way?",
        "Cassie: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you looking for edmund for?",
        "Reva: So I can tell him to stay the hell away from my son or he's going to be sorry.",
        "Olivia: Hello, harley.",
        "Harley: Hello, olivia. Bad time?",
        "Olivia: Actually...",
        "Bill: No. Come on in.",
        "Olivia: Actually, I was just telling bill that this is really a bad time. I'm a little crazy busy with alan gone, so maybe the two of you could find another office.",
        "Bill: Olivia, it's an emergency. Please. So, I got a subpoena from o'neill to testify.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I know. We shouldn't be talking about this.",
        "Bill: Yeah, and you know he's going to ask me all sorts of questions about ruth and why you wanted to go undercover.",
        "Harley: Yeah, I know. We really, really should not be talking about this.",
        "Bill: We both know how i answer those questions could either make your case better or worse, and I just want you to know one thing before you go into the courtroom. I'm going to do whatever it takes to make things better.",
        "Olivia: Excuse me to interrupt your little pre- meeting, but I just want to make sure that I heard correctly. You are going to lie on the witness stand? You are going to perjure yourself for her?",
        "Sebastian: Hey, hey, holly. Earth to holly. Holly, come back to me, sweetheart. Hello? Hey, easy. Easy. Holly, chill. Chill.",
        "Holly: I told ross, I told him you were alive tormenting me.",
        "Sebastian: Not anymore.",
        "Holly: I saw you. You fell out of the airplane. You fell into the ocean. How did you survive?",
        "Sebastian: I... I know, and i lived to tell about it. It's a miracle, holly, a blessing. There's no other explanation, so I just figure, I don't know, you just got to go with it, you know? I mean, I survived the disease that killed dad, and then I took a fall and bounced back.",
        "Holly: And what are you doing here? You're back for revenge? So get it over with. Actually think I might try and buy you off? You might. I would if i was convince it had would work. Will it? Jury is still out.",
        "Ross: Oh. Well, I am sorry, blake.",
        "Blake: I know. I know. And I know that sebastian's death brought up a lot of unresolved feelings my mother has for my father. And in order for you to be a better friend to her, you might have to be a little less sensitive to me. And I don't really hold that against you.",
        "Ross: You don't?",
        "Blake: I said not really. And yes, I have a lot of questions about sebastian's death, and I plan on pursuing them with or without your help. So I guess I don't really hold that against you, either.",
        "Ross: All righty. Then what's the problem?",
        "Blake: Where are we eating?",
        "Ross: Gramercy tavern.",
        "Blake: Good. Of course we're going to be there two nights, and I heard that per se in the time/warner building is the new in spot.",
        "Ross: ( Laughs ) I tried to get reservations there. Impossible.",
        "Blake: Try harder.",
        "Ross: Madame first lady, you drive a hard bargain.",
        "Blake: Mr. Mayor, I am so worth it. But you know that.",
        "Ross: Oh, I do. I do, my darling. My little dumpling. Kissing is better than fighting, isn't it?",
        "Blake: Oh, much. You see, guilt can be a positive force.",
        "Ross: Well, if that's the case, I think I should be guilty for a little while longer.",
        "Blake: Why? Ross.",
        "Ross: It's dinah. You know, just recently I've seen and heard some things that makes me believe that she's back to her old obsessive tricks, while all the while playing her dear-old dad for a fool.",
        "Blake: Well, now that you see it, what are you going to do about it?",
        "Ross: Oh, I have something in the works.",
        "Blake: Good. Oh, listen, I have to run. I have to get to the towers. So, we're going to talk about this tonight. Later, all right? And I love you.",
        "Ross: I love you, too.",
        "Blake: Oh, and ross? The flight to new york? First class. Pay for me please.",
        "Jonathan: Mom and josh weren't very happy to find out i had a girl in their bed last night.",
        "Dinah: Now, imagine what they would say if they knew that girl was little-old me.",
        "Jonathan: Let's hold off on that for now. Anyway, mom saw me limping and i had to explain to her how uncle eddie stopped by my hotel room yesterday and roughed me up about the night before cassie's wedding thing.",
        "Dinah: And?",
        "Jonathan: You know how protective my mom is. Last time I saw her, she was storming out, going to rip uncle eddie a new one. And I bet cassie's going to be there.",
        "Dinah: Fabulous.",
        "Jonathan: This family, always fighting. You owe me one now, dinah. And I know just how I want to collect.",
        "Dinah: Not now. I'm meeting someone.",
        "Jonathan: Who? That guy? Are you kidding me? Where's his pocket protector?",
        "Dinah: He's a doctor. He's a fertility specialist. I thought that might come in handy since edmund and cassie are trying to get pregnant. Although I have to say, I don't think it's very worth it. He's so into me, I want to puke. He calls at least ten times a day.",
        "Jonathan: Wow. A stalker with her own stalker. How about that? Go get him.",
        "Dinah: Hi.",
        "Corey: Hi.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) hi, sweetie. I thought you were going to stand me up.",
        "Corey: Never. Wow. You look great. But then you always look great.",
        "Dinah: You are so sweet. Shall we sit?",
        "Corey: Oh, yeah, sure. I already got us a table.",
        "Dinah: Great.",
        "Corey: Listen, I hope you don't mind I invited someone to join us, someone I really want you to meet.",
        "Dinah: Who?",
        "Corey: Um, well, because i really like you, dinah. You know that, right? I really like you.",
        "Dinah: Corey, who is it?",
        "Corey: My mom.",
        "Reva: Where is he, cassie? Where did he go?",
        "Cassie: I'm not going to tell you when you're acting like this. Why don't you calm down and tell me why you're so crazy?",
        "Reva: Edmund attacked jonathan while josh and I were at cross creek.",
        "Cassie: Okay, look, he really didn't do anything.",
        "Reva: How do you know? You weren't there.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I was. Oh, so jonathan left that part out? I'm so surprised, when he told you everything else.",
        "Reva: He didn't want to tell me anything, but I saw him limping and so I pulled the truth out of him.",
        "Cassie: The truth according to jonathan.",
        "Reva: I don't know what the truth is, cassie. That's why I'm here. Okay? I want to hear edmund's side of the story, and I'd like to hear yours, too, if you'll tell me.",
        "Cassie: Oh, right. That's why you're here. Oh, come on.",
        "Reva: That's why I'm here now.",
        "Cassie: Okay, fine. Fine. I'll tell you what happened. Yes, edmund went over to see jonathan, and yes he was angry, and yes, he might have done something to hurt him if i didn't show up.",
        "Reva: Might have? ( Scoffs ) oh, yeah.",
        "Cassie: Well, yeah, and so what if he did? I mean, come on, reva. Doesn't jonathan deserve it? He walks around with a sign on his neck that says \"smack me\" half the time.",
        "Reva: That still doesn't give edmund or anyone else the right to go after him...",
        "Cassie: Don't make this about edmund and don't blame edmund. If you want to blame someone, blame me, okay? Because I'm the one who set up jonathan and I'm the one who kept it from my husband. So it's my fault. Blame me, because I do.",
        "Reva: Because that would be so much easier for you, wouldn't it?",
        "Cassie: Easier than what?",
        "Reva: Easier than admitting, cassie, why you didn't tell edmund what happened that night. Because you knew what his reaction would be. You knew he'd attack my son, and that's exactly what happened, so admit it! Big, bad edmund is back.",
        "Olivia: Did you just say that you're going to perjure yourself on the witness stand for her? You can't do that. What if you get caught? You will go to jail.",
        "Bill: Olivia? Olivia, you're making too big a deal of this. Let's not...",
        "Olivia: I don't think i am. Thanks for thinking of me. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Harley: Bill? Olivia is right. You can't lie for me on the stand.",
        "Bill: I got news for you, okay? I don't care what you want. What I want to do is help you, and I am going to do whatever it takes. Look, I was there from the beginning with this whole ruth thing, remember? Chinese food on the beach?",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Harley: See, that msg adache? That was an omen.",
        "Bill: Look... look, alan wants to do anything he can to get me. Olivia is letting him sit in jail. I've got a lot of risk in my life already, so it's not A...",
        "Harley: Okay, then don't take anymore. I'm serious. Look, tell the truth-- nothing but the truth-- when you get up there, okay? Please, bill.",
        "Bill: Okay. If that's what you want.",
        "Harley: Oh, please. No, that was way too easy. You're going to get up there and do whatever you want, anyway, aren't you?",
        "Sebastian: Just relax, holly. Look, I'm not going to hurt you, okay? Especially not in a room full of people. Just kidding. I'm not going to hurt you, period.",
        "Holly: Is that supposed to be funny?",
        "Sebastian: ( Sighs ) I'm sorry, holly. I'm just... I'm just happy to be here, you know? I'm happy to be alive in 2005. Aren't you happy that I'm alive? It kind of lets you off the hook.",
        "Holly: For what?",
        "Sebastian: Uh, that little maybe accidental push off the plane. Or were you intending for me to take the big plunge?",
        "Holly: No, I did not. That really was hard for me. Until you started gaslighting me.",
        "Sebastian: Gaslighting you?",
        "Holly: The gold coins? The dress? The wine? You've been following me for weeks.",
        "Sebastian: I don't know. I just... you know, I guess i just wanted to see how you would react if I showed up.",
        "Holly: By gaslighting me?",
        "Sebastian: I'm sorry, holly, I... ( sighs ) the last time you saw me, I was different, you know? Come on, don't I look healthier?",
        "Holly: Maybe.",
        "Sebastian: Maybe? Holly, I was sick. I was sick, not just in body, but I was sick in my mind-- physically, emotionally sick. And, um, I don't know, I wasn't thinking right. I wasn'T... I wasn't myself.",
        "Holly: Now you're a better person?",
        "Sebastian: I pushed you in that plane. I don't blame you for pushing me back.",
        "Holly: You don't?",
        "Sebastian: Nope.",
        "Holly: All right, then. You tell me what you're doing here, what you're really doing here.",
        "Sebastian: I have cheated death twice, holly. I want to revel in life, the gift of life. You know why? Because it's precious, it's fragile, and I want to experience that and celebrate it. And I want to do that here. In springfield.",
        "Corey: Mom can't wait to meet you.",
        "Dinah: Well, I can't wait to meet her, either.",
        "Corey: You're going to love her, dinah. I promise. Oh, there she is now. Excuse me. Mom! Mom. Over here. Oh, no. What's wrong with your foot?",
        "Mrs. Butler: It's not my foot. It's my shoe. Stand up straight, will you? I busted it on the terrazzo downstairs. You know, these people think they're so smart putting in these fancy floors. But what they do to heels is criminal. Criminal. And you must be dinah.",
        "Dinah: Yes. It's a pleasure to meet you.",
        "Mrs. Butler: Corey said you were pretty.",
        "Corey: I said \"beautiful.\"",
        "Mrs. Butler: Let's keep it at pretty. So, you're the mayor's daughter?",
        "Dinah: Yes, I am.",
        "Mrs. Butler: I didn't vote for him. Well, I don't vote, period. Politicians are crooks.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way. But I bet if you met my father, you'd change your mind.",
        "Mrs. Butler: I never change my mind. About anything. Well, did my corey tell you about the girl he let get away in college?",
        "Corey: Oh, no, mom. Let's not...",
        "Mrs. Butler: Oh, now there was a catch. A kindergarten teacher, cared for her invalid mother. Smart as a whip.",
        "Dinah: Well, she couldn't have been that smart if she let this one go. Huh?",
        "Corey: Thanks.",
        "Mrs. Butler: She would have made a perfect doctor's wife. So, corey, dear, whatever happened to that little doll?",
        "Corey: She and her life partner, alison, live in massachusetts now.",
        "Mrs. Butler: So, whose butt do you have to kiss to get a waiter around here? Get me a club soda, will you, sweetheart?",
        "Dinah: Corey, it's all right. I'll go get it.",
        "Mrs. Butler: Corey will go. So.",
        "Dinah: So. Did corey tell you how we met? My sister-in-law, olivia, introduced us.",
        "Mrs. Butler: Drop the act, honey. We're alone now and I've done my homework, toots, so I know all about how you shot your ex- fianc\u00e9 and went on the lam. And if you think I'm going to let you get your hooks into my baby, you've got another thing coming.",
        "Jonathan: You giving me the cold shoulder, uncle eddie?",
        "Edmund: Ginger ale with bitters, please.",
        "Jonathan: You happen to see my mom this morning? What, are you meeting cassie here?",
        "Edmund: You should leave now.",
        "Jonathan: So, what happened last night between you and cassie...?",
        "Edmund: No, really. You should leave.",
        "Jonathan: Whatever.",
        "Cassie: You're wrong. Jonathan tried to hurt us and edmund was just trying to protect his family, that's all.",
        "Reva: So, when you showed up at jonathan's room, edmund was calm and rational, right?",
        "Cassie: He wasn't out of control.",
        "Reva: Then how did jonathan hurt his leg again?",
        "Cassie: I don't know and i don't care.",
        "Reva: Oh, cassie, why can't you see? Whenever edmund feels threatened, he reverts back to type and he hurts anything that gets in his way. Or do I have to remind you about a time in a tower just a few years back?",
        "Cassie: Edmund's not like that anymore. He's changed.",
        "Reva: Maybe he hasn'T.",
        "Cassie: Oh. So, jonathan can change but edmund can'T. Man. Do you hear yourself? Jonathan has done nothing but cause pain to everyone since he's come into this town, reva.",
        "Reva: That's because he was hurt himself. Jonathan became what he is today because he was given a bum deal when he was growing up. But edmund was born that way. And maybe he'll always be that way.",
        "Cassie: Get out of my house.",
        "Reva: Oh, cassie.",
        "Cassie: Get out, reva. , Fine. Then I'll go.",
        "Reva: You know I'm right, cassie. That's why you're angry. Because I'm right. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Jonathan: Cassie, is it ever weird for you to live in the same house as him and sleep in the same bed after everything he's done in the past to you, reva and me? I don't know, I think that would freak me out a little bit.",
        "Harley: Your husband is a very, very good guy.",
        "Olivia: If you like him as much as you claim that you do, you will think about him and keep your distance. I'll die before a see him with you. Month. Ill have turz like you have no interest in decent boys like my corey uthess there is something if n it for you what's your angle? Angle? Don't be so shokd. We both know people like you don't change. Never. That's enough. Looking for uncle eddie, he's over at towers. Have you guys ever considered signing him up for an anger management class? Stay away where me. Whatever. No, wait. When you war lone with edmund if i hadn't showed up do you think he really would have hurt you? Um, yeah, really hurt me, killed me, then really hurt me some more. Edmund and i are a lot of like, from the same gene pool, if i was him i would probably really hurt me too and probably not stop there. You and ud mend are not alike. You're two different people. Owe kau:... Okay. Cassie is it ever weird for you to live in the same house with him sleep in the same bed after everything he's done in the past to you yef and me? I don't know, i think that would freak me out a little bit. You're moving to springfield, why? To do what?",
        "Sebastian: Why? It's simple. I like this place. And I have family here.",
        "Holly: I am not your family.",
        "Sebastian: I know. But chrissie is. And as far as what I want to do, I don't know. I haven't figured that out yet. But I want to, I don't know, find something that makes me feel happy and useful.",
        "Holly: No, no, no, no. This is about roger. You want to live here because roger lived here.",
        "Sebastian: Holly, people generally move someplace because of a reason, right? I mean, family, friends, a job, great skiing, whatever. Stop overanalyzing this. What? Ask me. Anything.",
        "Holly: All right, how do I...",
        "Blake: Sebastian?",
        "Sebastian: Chrissie. Now, look, I just got finished reviving your mom, so don't faint on me, okay?",
        "Blake: God.",
        "Sebastian: Hey, sis.",
        "Bill: I want to help you, harley.",
        "Harley: Thanks. But by getting yourself into trouble...",
        "Bill: Hey, I'm not going to give up on you.",
        "Harley: You sound like gus. Gus, he can't admit defeat, either. ( Laughs )",
        "Bill: He's a good man. I'm with him.",
        "Harley: You know, he's so convinced that he'll have me acquitted that he's rebuilding my house. And he doesn't have any money. He lost his job and his family. Did I forget to mention this to you?",
        "Bill: It's because he cares about you, okay? A lot of people do.",
        "Harley: I know, but here's my advice for those people. Be realistic. Worry about your family, worry about yourselves. Don't waste your time worrying about somebody like me.",
        "Bill: Okay, okay. Whatever you say.",
        "Sebastian: Hey.",
        "Blake: Mom, you told me that he died in the island, that he had that disease.",
        "Sebastian: You did? Actually, the truth is, chrissy, I fell. Into a coma. So deep that everyone really assumed I was dead. Then, what, you just came to?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. A couple of days after holly left. Just like that. I woke up, rubbed my eyes and greeted a brand-new day. I suppose she also told you i was a little out mif mind down there and did some crazy things to her and michelle. Yes, she did, she mentioned that. Do you hate me? Greet your transformed brother.",
        "Sebastian: I know... I know it must be difficult after everything I've done, but I want to make it up to you. Both of you. Now. And you know what? We're going to have a lot of time to make up, because I'm moving here.",
        "Blake: You are?",
        "Sebastian: Yes, I am. And I'll fill you in on that, too, but it's got to wait because I have an appointment and I'll pick that up on another time. I'll call you soon. You look great. I love you. Bye. Bye. I am just so happy to see both of you again.",
        "Holly: He says he's changed. More than his hair color.",
        "Blake: You don't believe him?",
        "Holly: I have to get back to the office.",
        "Blake: Mom.",
        "Holly: I'm late for an appointment. Sebastian.",
        "Sebastian: Hey, you.",
        "Holly: I want to thank you for not telling blake the truth about what happened on the plane.",
        "Sebastian: Holly, I told you I didn't come here to make things harder for you. I came for a new start.",
        "Holly: Really?",
        "Sebastian: Really, honestly and truly. You satisfied?",
        "Holly: I don't know. Where I do I fit into this picture? ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Bill: Hey.",
        "Harley: Yeah?",
        "Bill: I'm not going to stop worrying about you, okay?",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Olivia: I'll check. Hang on. Anybody here order chinese food?",
        "Bill: Uh, yeah. That's me. It's the good stuff this time. No msg.",
        "Harley: Good man.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Olivia: He'll be right out.",
        "Harley: But I can't stay.",
        "Bill: Yes, you can.",
        "Harley: No, no.",
        "Bill: Yes, you can.",
        "Harley: I really...",
        "Bill: Yes, you can.",
        "Harley: ...Can't stay. Your husband is a very, very good guy.",
        "Olivia: Sometimes he's too good for his own good. You know why he asked you to meet him here, right? To avoid the press? But he really didn't think beyond that.",
        "Harley: How do you mean?",
        "Olivia: Well, the name on this building is spaulding, and if one of alan's people sees you around here...",
        "Harley: He would think that you are fraternizing with the enemy.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, big-time.",
        "Harley: And we don't want to do anything to antagonize big al.",
        "Olivia: Bingo.",
        "Harley: So, then why are you letting him stew in jail? I mean, that's a surefire way to tick him off. Or, I'm sorry, maybe i misunderstood what bill just told me.",
        "Olivia: Bill just told you that? It's different. It's different.",
        "Harley: How so?",
        "Olivia: It's business.",
        "Harley: Or maybe it's just that you get to play with fire and bill doesn'T.",
        "Olivia: All I'm saying is if you like him as much as you claim that you do, you will think about him and keep your distance.",
        "Harley: Well, that's actually what I was planning to do anyway olivia. But thanks for underestimating me.",
        "Bill: All righty, we've got spare ribs and sesame noodles.",
        "Harley: You can have my share because I have to go anyway.",
        "Bill: I've got plenty here.",
        "Harley: You know what? I've got to go, bill. Thanks.",
        "Bill: Did I miss something?",
        "Olivia: I just think harley knows it's best to keep her distance, even if you don'T.",
        "Bill: Olivia, she's my friend.",
        "Olivia: We can't do anything for her. But what is within our power is to make sure the spauldings don't hurt anybody else.",
        "Bill: Oh, so wait a minute. That's why you're running this company and letting alan sit in jail? It's for the good of mankind? Is that what you're telling me?",
        "Olivia: Well, I'm sure as hell not about to lose everything over someone who's already a lost cause.",
        "Cassie: Who the hell are you, and why are you following me?",
        "Rufus: Following you?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Rufus: I'm not following you.",
        "Cassie: Let me tell you something. I am a black belt...",
        "Ross: Cassie. Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Ross. The mayor. Great. This guy has been following me and I'm trying to figure out why.",
        "Ross: It's all right. He works for the city. He's part of my security detail.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Ross: I asked him to follow you. Now I'm asking him not to. Rufus, that's enough for today. Thanks.",
        "Cassie: Would you like to tell me what's going on here, ross?",
        "Ross: The day that I found you and dinah fighting in the barn, I realized that I'm in denial. Dinah hasn't changed.",
        "Cassie: So you put a tail on me.",
        "Ross: To protect you, yes.",
        "Cassie: Well, why don't you put a tail on your own daughter? Why don't you open your eyes? You want to protect me, ross? Keep your daughter away from me and make her stay away from me, okay? I just got married and I'm trying to have a baby, and I've got enough to worry about.",
        "Edmund: I think you owe my friend an apology. People not only can change, they do.",
        "Mrs. Butler: Are you threatening me? That's just one more reason why my son wants nothing to do with you, dinah. Come on, corey, let's go.",
        "Corey: But...",
        "Mrs. Butler: Now. Out.",
        "Corey: My keys. I'm so sorry. I don't care what she thinks of you. I still want to see you. I'll call you.",
        "Edmund: The question is, do you still want to see him?",
        "Dinah: Well, maybe. Until something better comes along. You didn't have to defend me like that. Thank you, edmund.",
        "Edmund: You're welcome, dinah. But yes, I did. Honestly, do you think he's your type?",
        "Dinah: Well, people didn't think cassie should be with you, but look how wrong they were.",
        "Edmund: Yes, well, I wonder.",
        "Dinah: About what?",
        "Edmund: I wonder where my appointment is. If you'll excuse me, dinah, i have to make a telephone call.",
        "Reva: Hey, jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, ma.",
        "Reva: Why did you jump away like that? You thought I was edmund, didn't you? You thought I was going to hurt you.",
        "Olivia: Hi, jeffrey. It's olivia spencer. Look, I haven't received a phone call from your office yet and i was just curious. Do you need me to testify against harley cooper?",
        "Billy: Hey, what's that?",
        "Bill: You got my message.",
        "Billy: I like the square footage but I hate what they did with the grating out there.",
        "Bill: Seen the drawings. The architect came up with a good design. The problem now is gus has a cash flow problem and he's up to his eyeballs with the harley trial. So I thought maybe we could help him out, finish getting this place framed up and roofed.",
        "Billy: We?",
        "Bill: Lewis. I mean lewis.",
        "Billy: Wait, wait, wait. You said \"we.\"",
        "Bill: I'm a lewis, right? Come on, I'm not coming back to the company, all right?",
        "Billy: If you did, I'd take you back in a heartbeat.",
        "Bill: Well, thank you very much, but I've got my own gig now with olivia.",
        "Billy: Ah.",
        "Bill: Okay? I don't think it's right. I don't like the way they graded that, either.",
        "Billy: Hey, boy. Construction is in your blood and you're good at it.",
        "Bill: So, are you going to help harley get this place up or what?",
        "Billy: No problem.",
        "Blake: Harley.",
        "Harley: Hi.",
        "Blake: I am so glad you're here. How are you? I mean, besides the obvious. I mean, are you all right?",
        "Harley: Yeah, I just... i just got off the phone with gus. O'neil changed his witness order for the afternoon. He's putting frank on the stand next.",
        "Blake: To testify against you?",
        "Harley: Yes. This will tear frank apart. I'm not kidding. This will do him in. And I don't know how much more of this I can take.",
        "Sebastian: Relax, holly. You don't fit be into the picture of my life in springfield at all. I know that you want nothing more to do with me. You made that abundantly clear on the plane and you know what? I don't blame you. After how I treated you... i would like to maintain a relationship with chrissie and i hope that's okay with you. As for you and me, I figure, i don't know, we can be civil with each other and try to steer clear of each other as much as possible.",
        "Holly: Suits me.",
        "Sebastian: You took care of me so well on that island, holly. I wanted to fall into the abyss and you wouldn't let me. So, you know what? I owe you, big- time. I figure the way I can repay you is to honor you by keeping my distance. Right?",
        "Holly: Right.",
        "Sebastian: Take care, beautiful holly. Good-bye.",
        "Holly: Marcia, it's me. I want you to book me a flight. As far away as I can get.",
        "Reva: What are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: I got worried that things might get bad if you started shooting questions at edmund, so I came over. I wanted to make sure you were okay.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, things got pretty ugly, but it was between me and cassie.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, sorry.",
        "Reva: So, the reason you jumped when I walked out, was i right? You thought I was edmund?",
        "Jonathan: Maybe. Yeah, I've just felt like somebody's been following me since the second I left your house.",
        "Reva: Edmund?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I don't know. I'm kind of scared to see what happens if he finds me.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Waitress: You're welcome.",
        "Cassie: Thought I'd come in for a cup of coffee and I get to have lunch with you. This is great. I saw jonathan earlier and he said he saw you at towers.",
        "Edmund: Did he say anything? Did he threaten you or anything?",
        "Cassie: No. Of course not. We can't let him get to us, edmund, okay? I don't want this to escalate.",
        "Edmund: It's not going to escalate, cassie. I'm not the same man I used to be. It's not going to escalate.",
        "Cassie: Good. I love you. That's why I married you and that's why I want to have a baby with you. You can't doubt that, okay? I'm going to go find our waitress.",
        "Edmund: Good. I won't lose you, cassie. And I'll destroy anyone who tries to turn you against me. Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Reva: We have to stop him. We have to stop edmund. He's going to kill jonathan.",
        "Edmund: Hello, jonathan. Got a minute for your uncle?"
