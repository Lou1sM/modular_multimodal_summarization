        "Josh: So, basically, the new mall that I'm imagining would be twice the square footage--",
        "Tess: Let's not-- let's talk --let's not talk shop.",
        "Josh: Okay, all right. I just...",
        "Tess: Doing business makes for a boring date, don't you think?",
        "Josh: I'm sorry; date?",
        "Tess: Don't look so surprised. I called, asked you out for a drink. I'm wearing perfume.",
        "Josh: Yes, very nice perfume.",
        "Tess: I'm glad you like it. And I covered my bases; I checked with Reva before I called. I didn't want to overstep. Now, where were we?",
        "Josh: Right here, on our date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Hey. Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Dinah: Well, I missed you, and I thought a sure way to spend some time with you is to wait for you in your room. You've got lipstick on your collar. You smell like perfume.",
        "Mallet: Well, I didn't-- I didn't really expect to see you, you know. We didn't make any promises. I mean, I don't remember making any promises, right?",
        "Mallet: Hey, hey. What are you doing here?",
        "Dinah: I missed you, so here I am.",
        "Mallet: Hmm. I ought to work late more often.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Don't choke on that popcorn. Hey, where are those french fries? Dad. Daddy, where are the fries?!",
        "Frank: Are you sure you want to be working here now with everything that's going on with you?",
        "Harley: What? I'm spending time with my kids and helping out the family with the family biz; that's a good combo. Speaking of which, Daddy, where's the number four?",
        "Frank: Jeez...",
        "Harley: Hey, did I tell you, I'm going to finish building my house?",
        "Frank: Yes, you did.",
        "Harley: So it's full-speed ahead, you know, all systems go. I... said my good- byes to Gus and I'm on to what is next.",
        "Frank: Sis, look...",
        "Harley: And I don't want to grieve anymore. Because you know what? Gus would say that I was dragging my feet. He'd say that was a total waste of time. I have to get on to a new life, right?",
        "Zach: Mommy, want to see my picture?",
        "Harley: Yep. Sure. Oh, that looks great. Is that another picture of Gus?",
        "Zach: Yeah, up in the clouds.",
        "Frank: Up in the clouds? What is he holding in his hand?",
        "Zach: A phone. So he can call us from heaven like he did last time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Harley probably thinks I'm dead by now.",
        "Beth: Well, look, we're all dead up here, but you know we don't have to look at it as completely negative.",
        "Gus: Really? Can we find something positive in one of your loved ones thinking you're dead?",
        "Beth: No, no, of course not. But it does give us a chance to reevaluate things, you know, think about things we wish we could change, things we need to make amends for.",
        "Alan: Like what?",
        "Beth: You know, mistakes we've made, ways we've hurt other people.",
        "Gus: Well I, for one, have something to be sorry for. I'm sorry I went after you, got myself involved in this whole mess. I should have gone back to my wife on New Year's Eve and I wouldn't be in this rat hole with you two.",
        "Beth: What about you, Alan?",
        "Alan: What about me?",
        "Beth: There must be something you're sorry for.",
        "Alan: Well, I can't think of anything at the moment, but if I do, I'll let you know. ( Bowl crashing to the floor )",
        "Beth: Whoo, that bowl slipped right out of my hands. I guess I'll have to find something else to make you guys lunch, and you must be starving.",
        "Alan: Beth...",
        "Beth: No, you don't have to thank me. I really do just want to take care of you.",
        "Gus: You know what I need?",
        "Beth: Food?",
        "Gus: No. I'm feeling A... little claustrophobic. Maybe if I just look out a window, and I-- I don't care-- watch the snow melt.",
        "Alan: That's a good idea, Gus. Why don't we do that, yeah?",
        "Beth: Well, you better be careful, you know, you don't want to overdue it. It will take us that much longer to get out of here.",
        "Gus: I'll just do it later.",
        "Beth: Yeah, after lunch.",
        "Gus: Can I ask you a favor? Can I see that... that phone? Wait a minute, do we have enough food?",
        "Beth: Yeah, Gus. I told you, the cabin is stocked.",
        "Gus: Oh, right. Well, about that phone...",
        "Beth: Gus, the phone is dead! Do you understand english? Why do you insist on questioning everything I say?!",
        "Mallet: I like finding you in my bed when I come back to my room.",
        "Dinah: You're chivalrous for a guy who has been taking on some extra hours and shifts. Have you been at the police station this whole time?",
        "Mallet: Yes, yes, yes. I'm doing Gus' paperwork, you know?",
        "Dinah: I've had to step it up lately, with Harley taking the time off. It has just been a lot more responsibility.",
        "Mallet: Did you get a promotion, more responsibility?",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh.",
        "Mallet: Like more money?",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh.",
        "Mallet: This all happened?",
        "Dinah: Yes.",
        "Mallet: Today?",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Mallet: Come here. That's incredible. Congratulations.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Mallet: I'm so proud of you, though. Wow. Wow. You got a promotion today and came back here and still waited for me.",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh. It sounded like a good idea at the time.",
        "Mallet: At the time?",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh. I keep telling you you're not as irresistible as you think you are.",
        "Mallet: Maybe a little. Just a little. Please, just a little.",
        "Dinah: Uh-uh. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Mallet: Aye-aye. Yeah, Mallet. Hey, man, what's going on? Come on, man, are you kidding me? Now? Okay. No, that's cool. Thanks. Oh, that was dispatch. Another case came up. You know what? I'm just going to call them back and put somebody else on it because I'm not the only detective.",
        "Dinah: No, no, no. You can't do that. No, they obviously need you.",
        "Mallet: Well, so do you.",
        "Dinah: Hey, you know, if you got another partner, they would help you pick up some of the slack at work now.",
        "Mallet: No, I don't want another partner.",
        "Dinah: Hey, you know, you are worrying me a little bit. You are so strong and able, but doesn't this operation need some brains, too?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughing ) Uh-huh.",
        "Dinah: Uh-huh.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "Dinah: Be nice! ( Laughter )",

        "Josh: So, Costa Rica, I've never been there. I hear it is beautiful.",
        "Tess: An eco-paradise. You must go.",
        "Josh: Then I will.",
        "Tess: It's so great to find someone who cares about the environment, proper land use, air and water quality.",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah. I agree.",
        "Tess: I went out with this guy who seemed very reasonable, until he walked into our third date wearing leather cowboy boots.",
        "Josh: Right, that's a little out of style these days, isn't it?",
        "Tess: Not unless your style is the exploitation of animals. It's not, is it?",
        "Josh: No. No, no. I don't think so anyway.",
        "Tess: See, I knew we would hit it off. I just get this feeling sometimes, and I can tell you care about all creatures big and small and their environments.",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah. So have you decided what you want yet? It looks like we're not going to be having any chicken wings tonight, I guess, huh?",
        "Tess: I get it. You're lampooning our consumptive culture.",
        "Josh: Yes, indeed, I was lampooning.",
        "Tess: You know what we should do? Go for a hike; it'll give us so much time to talk.",
        "Josh: Really, how much time do you think?",
        "Tess: I feel like when you meet someone really interesting, you should just grab on, not let go, and see where it takes you.",
        "Cassie: H! How could you do this to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Sweetie, I think we need to have another conversation about Gus, okay? And isn't there some police business that you need to take care of?",
        "Frank: Okay. I shouldn't be long. A big five, brother.",
        "Zach: It was Gus. I heard him.",
        "Harley: Look, Gus would love to talk to us. He would, but he can't. Because, you know, heaven's full of all these great things, but one of the things it doesn't have is a phone line.",
        "Zach: Then how did he call?",
        "Harley: Baby, I know that you thought you heard him.",
        "Zach: I did! I did!",
        "Jeffrey: Hey, you guys. Hey, Zach. You know, that's the funny thing about phones, you know, I always think people are calling me all the time. I can never tell who it is because you know, sometimes-- ( in a high pitched voice )-- people talk with a really high voice--( in a low voice )-- and sometimes they talk with a really low voice-- ( with a southern accent )-- and sometimes they talk with a funny accent. I can never tell. You know you can only tell when someone is eyeball to eyeball with you.",
        "Zach: I guess.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, you guess.",
        "Zach: He sounded a little weird.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Well, you know what? I think you can still talk to Gus, but he's just going to have to answer you in a different way.",
        "Harley: You want to draw some more?",
        "Zach: Yes.",
        "Harley: Why don't you try drawing some trucks?",
        "Jeffrey: This is a nice drawing there.",
        "Harley: Thanks.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Harley: That was pretty good.",
        "Jeffrey: Well I guess I've been whipped into shape by a certain R.J. and Cassie. ( Laughter ) So kids and their imagination, huh?",
        "Harley: Yeah, it's just, um... Zach's always been the one who has been so grounded, you know? It's funny that he's so sure that Gus was on the phone.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe that's just a sign that he really misses him.",
        "Harley: Yeah, maybe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I'm sorry. I'm being impatient. I guess this place just has me on edge.",
        "Alan: Oh, Beth, it's understandable. I mean, after everything you've been through, I think you've handled the situation very well.",
        "Beth: Do you?",
        "Alan: Yes. I mean, you haven't only taken great care of us, you've taken very good care of yourself. I'm beginning to think that this wilderness life is starting to agree with you. Springfield and start our life together.",
        "Beth: Together?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Beth: You and me.",
        "Alan: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: I hate to be a pest, but maybe I could see that phone? Because, see, when I was an agent, they taught us a lot of things. And one of the classes we had was how to fix phones, class 101, maybe get a little battery juice out of the phone, kind of like a Macgyver, you know what I'm saying...",
        "Beth: Gus, I really hate to see you get your hopes up.",
        "Alan: What happened to our other phones, the ones we had when we crashed?",
        "Beth: I have no idea. They weren't on you when I found you.",
        "Gus: Maybe I can see that phone anyway because I probably could do a little something with it.",
        "Alan: Yeah. Beth, why don't you just let him try to fix your phone or something, huh?",
        "Gus: Thanks. Sometimes when you... yeah, we might be in luck.",

        "Dinah: Hey, you've got work to go do, remember? Listen, I'm going back to my room like a good little CEO.",
        "Mallet: No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Come here. I've got something for you. Sit right here.",
        "Dinah: Okay. A toothbrush.",
        "Mallet: Yes.",
        "Dinah: It's pink. I love it.",
        "Mallet: Well, I got it for you for when you come here and stay longer sometimes.",
        "Dinah: Nice.",
        "Mallet: I got one for myself for your room, but it's not pink.",
        "Dinah: Oh, is there a little animal head on it?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, how did you know? It's got a little tiger.",
        "Dinah: You're working all the angles, aren't you?",
        "Mallet: Did you really think I took the room next to you because I didn't like the curtains in the room across the hall?",
        "Dinah: No, I just kind of thought my furnishing skills were really good, and it's rubbing off on you somehow.",
        "Mallet: Hmm. Well, this room is bigger, and I thought since you've already got a toothbrush here that maybe you would like to, you know, bring some more stuff over.",
        "Dinah: Like what? Floss?",
        "Mallet: I don't know. I'll let you think about that, maybe come up with a few things. I don't know.",
        "Dinah: Listen, you don't have to call me. You don't have to check in. Just do your thing. If you have to stay late, don't even worry about it, all right? I'm serious. Blake",
        "Blake: Hey, there.",
        "Dinah: Stop.",
        "Blake: Stop what?",
        "Dinah: Come here. You're churning. I can see the wheels. I can practically see what you're thinking.",
        "Blake: And I'm thinking...?",
        "Dinah: You're thinking that Mallet and I are a little shaky. But we're not. Look, he's a cop, Blake, and sometimes he has to be at work for hours. Sometimes he doesn't even come home. He bought me a toothbrush that I'm going to be able to keep here. So I know that you have this suspicious mind...",
        "Blake: But I don't. At least I didn't until now. Why? Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: See, there's a little contact here, and sometimes when you heat it up, you get like an extra minute of phone time. I shouldn't be doing this.",
        "Beth: No, no, you shouldn't. It's a waste of energy.",
        "Gus: No, no, I mean I should be home. I should be putting together Christmas presents for Jude and Zach. You know, we were supposed to take a family trip. Now they all probably think I'm dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Waiting for a call?",
        "Harley: It's not like I think Gus is still alive.",
        "Jeffrey: No?",
        "Harley: No, I've made peace with that-- well, as much as one can, anyway.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Harley: And, you know, I'm trying to move forward with my life in a way that Gus would be proud of.",
        "Jeffrey: But you're not sure?",
        "Harley: I didn't say that.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, Harley, look, the body was never found. So why don't you just call the F.B.I. and get an update? I know you want to.",
        "Harley: It's unhealthy.",
        "Jeffrey: Come on, I'm not buying this. I didn't give you the code name Terrier for nothing.",
        "Harley: So you don't think I'd be crazy to not move forward and let this go?",
        "Jeffrey: I think that you've always relied on your instincts, and I think your instincts are damn good-- most of the time. And I think you love your husband even when it's against all the odds. That isn't crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: I'm just sitting here having...",
        "Cassie: Having a drink with a lady, I can see that. A lady who is not me. You can take off because this drink is over.",
        "Tess: Josh, who is this?",
        "Josh: She's a friend of mine.",
        "Cassie: A friend?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Well, maybe not for long, you pig!",
        "Josh: Excuse us for just a second, all right? Look, I hate it when you get jealous, Angelina. And you said you were going to be out of town.",
        "Cassie: Well, I changed my plans, and obviously you made some of your own. Oh and by the way, your leather jacket is still at my place.",
        "Tess: You wear leather and you're already in a relationship? Anything else I should know?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, when to shut your mouth, like right about now for instance.",
        "Josh: Hey, come on. Excuse me. Where do you get off talking to her like that?",
        "Cassie: You're lucky I'm just talking! Remember the last time I caught you with a little cookie? I crumbled her. So you've got exactly ten seconds to get gone. This man is mine.",
        "Tess: You can have him. You probably gave him that disgusting jacket, didn't you?",
        "Josh: Did you really say something about crumbling a cookies because that was...",
        "Cassie: Oh, come on, Angelina?",
        "Josh: Well, I just thought it'd be cool to have a girlfriend named Angelina and you played that part; I appreciate that. Thank you. It was getting a little rough there.",
        "Cassie: You're welcome. I could see that, you know. Good old Angie, she doesn't miss nothing. ( Laughs )",

        "Jeffrey: Mel, is everything all right?",
        "Mel: ( Sighs ) You know what? Something has been bothering me. When I was tending to you after your fall, you were pretty woozy from the meds and you started to talk.",
        "Jeffrey: I did?",
        "Mel: Yeah, you were going on about pretending to be Richard-- Richard Winslow, I'm assuming.",
        "Jeffrey: Wow, those must have been grade \"A\" drugs you gave me. That sounds like I was flying.",
        "Mel: You don't remember any of this?",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Mel: Well, there was more.",
        "Jeffrey: More? Wow.",

        "Harley: Why shouldn't I call? I mean the feds couldn't have closed the case on Gus-- not without a body. I'm just following up. It makes sense. No, it doesn't make sense. Okay, stop talking about it, just make the call.",

        "Dinah: I was waiting for Mallet to come home, and we were very happy to see one another. Why do you think that things are not great between the two of us? They are; they're perfect. The guy got me a toothbrush, a pink one. Here.",
        "Blake: That's very nice.",
        "Dinah: Yep. The problem isn't with Mallet, it's with me.",
        "Blake: Why? You sleeping with somebody behind his back?",
        "Dinah: No. I'm just edgy, that's all.",
        "Blake: ( Laughs ) You edgy? Never, never.",
        "Dinah: Blake, I had a nightmare that he was cheating on me and it seemed awfully real.",
        "Blake: You're going to blame Mallet for your nightmare?",
        "Dinah: No, I trust Mallet. I need to. I do.",
        "Blake: But?",
        "Dinah: But it's hard not to let the demons in, you know. I mean, they just-- they get me. Sometimes it's like a telephone wire with a bunch of birds on it, just pecking at me and poking and whispering in my ear. But I am not going to let this ruin my life again. I will not let them take over.",
        "Blake: You're in love with Mallet, aren't you?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah. And this is a very dangerous area for me. And, um, I know that, and I am different. I'm a different girl. And I'm not going to let this happen again. I'm not going to let myself hold onto him too tightly and suffocate him or smother him. I'm not going to let that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You are such a liar. You do not want sweetness and stability.",
        "Josh: Yes, I do.",
        "Cassie: Then how come practically every woman you have ever been with is the exact opposite of that?",
        "Josh: Yeah, and look at how those have worked out.",
        "Cassie: That's not the point. The point is you want the mystery. You crave the drama. Who are you kidding? You love to have a woman to keep you on your toes.",
        "Josh: My toes are tired, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Well, good luck finding your unpredictable, yet stable, passionate, yet sweet- natured, drama-free honey. She'll be one lucky schizophrenic; that much I know.",
        "Josh: What did you say before about being a hermit? Because that sounds pretty good right about now.",
        "Cassie: All right, all right, all right. Do what you've got to do to make yourself happy.",
        "Josh: And what about you? Are you happy? Huh?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Josh: I mean, do you have any second thoughts about closing down the investigation into Jeffrey's past?",
        "Cassie: Nope. If Jeffrey's worst offense was protecting me and Richard, even when I didn't know it, then that's not so bad.",
        "Josh: \"If.\" That's a big \"if.\"",
        "Cassie: Well, it doesn't feel like that to me now, not when I think about how much he means to me and how much he has given up for my sake. Josh, he sacrificed his career to protect my daughter. And the funny thing is, that's the kind of thing Richard would have done. That unselfish, that noble. You've got to love a man like that. I sure do.",
        "Josh: Well, that's all that matters, I guess, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So, tell me again please, everything that I said while I was under the influence of those drugs-- everything. I need to know.",
        "Mel: Okay. You said that you needed to be honest, that when you were pretending to be Richard, you made love to Cassie. And that you were... you should have told her then and that you were sorry.",
        "Jeffrey: I said all that, huh?",
        "Mel: It's true, isn't it?",
        "Jeffrey: What if I told you no? Would you believe me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Harley?",
        "Harley: I called the F.B.I. to ask if they found Gus' body yet.",
        "Frank: Oh, sis.",
        "Harley: The agent was very nice-- nice because he didn't say I was nuts, which is what he was thinking, which is what I'm sure you're thinking.",
        "Frank: I am not thinking that.",
        "Harley: Well, you should be because this is nuts. My six-year-old, his imagination tells him that Gus is on the phone and then-- boom!-- I am right back in stuck mode. \"Where is he? Where could he be? What is he doing? Is he still alive?\" Blah, blah, blah. All these crazy thoughts in my head and full speed to nowhere.",
        "Frank: Sis, it's going to be okay, honey.",
        "Harley: It's not going to be okay. It's not. The F.B.I. is not going to find Gus' body. And he never called, Frank. And if he's up there right now looking down on me, he is ready to kick my butt, because I promised him I would get on with my life. But what is my life without him? I don't even know who I am anymore without him in my life.",
        "Frank: Yes, you do. Listen to me, nobody-- I mean nobody-- knows who they are better than you do.",
        "Harley: Oh, Frank, you are right. You are right. Could you watch Zach for me for a minute? I know exactly what I have to do.",

        "Dinah: ( Screams )",
        "Mallet: What is this all about?",
        "Dinah: Would you believe it if I told you I'm not Dinah? Are you okay?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm kind of momentarily stunned.",
        "Dinah: Sorry.",
        "Mallet: It's all right.",
        "Dinah: Look, I have to be honest with you, you know. Sometimes I'm jealous and suspicious by myself and sometimes when we're together and I see your phone ring and I don't know who it's from, I go to a really stupid, dark place. I'm thinking you probably don't need somebody with this much baggage in their life.",
        "Mallet: No. No, I do. And I want all of you.",
        "Dinah: So you don't think I'm a nut job?",
        "Mallet: Oh, I know you're a nut job, but you're a nut job in need of closet space.",
        "Dinah: You mean that?",
        "Mallet: A little. So, here's the closet; here's the space.",
        "Dinah: You sure you know what you're getting yourself into here?",
        "Mallet: Oh, boy. Yeah, before you know it we'll be moving on to the armoire. ( Cell phone rings ) Do you want to see who it is?",
        "Dinah: No. No, I trust you. You better answer it.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Hey, what's up? Uh, no, I can't right now. Well, no, I can't. I mean, not unless it's some kind of an emergency or something. Oh, uh... okay. Um... yeah? Okay. Yeah, okay, all right. Why, where are you? You still there?",

        "Alan: Beth? Beth! Open the door! Something's not right here, Gus.",

        "Dinah: Okay. You said you wanted all of me, Mallet, you got it. You did say that, didn't you? That you wanted all of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Hey.",
        "Harley: Wow, you got here fast.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you said it was an emergency.",
        "Harley: Yeah, let's sit down over here and talk.",
        "Mallet: No, I don't want to sit down. I'm here, you said you needed me, so what's up? What's going on? What?",
        "Harley: What if I told you that I wanted to go back on the Springfield P.D.?",
        "Mallet: What? Are you saying you want to be a cop again?",
        "Harley: It's who I am.",
        "Mallet: Well, I would say that's definitely a surprise, but I don't know if that qualifies as urgent.",
        "Harley: Okay. What if I told you I wanted to come back as your partner?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Gus, there is a receipt dated February the 13th with medical supplies and food. Beth has been going out, and we're her prisoners.",
        "Beth: That's right, Alan. I'm in charge now. I decide when you eat, when you leave, if you leave. It's all up to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie cannot find out about this.",
        "Mel: Why not? I mean, she knows about everything else, doesn't she? I mean, she knows you were Richard's stand-in; she knows that you were in love with her then.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's a pretty big jump, don't you think? From knowing that I was in love with her there to knowing that we slept together.",
        "Mel: Too big, is that what you're saying?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, too big. Look, I cannot tell her, you cannot tell her. All it's going to do is hurt her more, Mel, you know that.",
        "Mel: Look, if you love here --her like you say you do...",
        "Jeffrey: That's not the point.",
        "Mel: Well, look, I can't tell her, anyway, even if I wanted to because what you told me that day is protected under patient-doctor privilege.",
        "Jeffrey: That's right. That's right, perfect.",
        "Mel: But, as a woman and as Cassie's friend, you have to tell her, okay? Because what you did was...",

        "Josh: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Look, Mel. I hate this, but you've just got to let me do it. It's going to work out, I promise.",
        "Mel: Listen, I have to go pick up Jude, but please, I need to tell you again, do the right thing. Tell Cassie that you slept with her while you were impersonating Richard. If it hadn't slipped out while you were my patient, I would tell her myself.",
        "Jeffrey: You've got to trust me on this, okay? Mel, trust me as someone who loves Cassie.",
        "Mel: Sometimes love is not enough. Good night.",
        "Josh: Mel might not be able to tell Cassie, but I can.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Josh: How do you justify sleeping with Cassie while you were impersonating Richard?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that is between me and Cassie.",
        "Josh: We're in luck then, because she's here.",
        "Reva: I will stay here all night if that's what you need.",
