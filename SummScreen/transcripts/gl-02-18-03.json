        "Phillip apologises to Olivia and she tells him she is pregnant with his baby-- in her daydream while Phillip is standing in front of her calling her name. They talk and he goes to meet a client after telling Olivia that his life had been one mistake after another. She asks, was being with me a mistake even if something good could come from it? He leaves only to daydream about their lovemaking session. He goes to her and says that it wasn't a mistake, he's not proud of what they did, but even if nothing good ever comes out of it, he doesn't regret anything they said or did. Olivia tries to tell him her news but he gets a call from Lizzie asking him to come see her. Meanwhile Olivia gets a phone call from Monica Parker, the PI that Alan fired. She tells Olivia that Alan did bad things to her but not nearly as bad as what he did to Olivia. She tells Olivia that Alan replaced her birthcontrol pills. Gus has Alex and Edmund brought in for questioning. Alex freaks out under the pressure of interrogation. She tells Gus that Regina was under the protection of Miguel Santos when she died. Gus is shocked to think that Miguel could possibly be his daddy. Alex tells Edmund that she didn't tell the whole story to Gus and that he won't like what he hears if he finds out what she is hiding."

        "Olivia: You're sorry?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I have been acting like such an idiot. I have been lashing out at you and accusing you of staying with Alan for financial gain.",
        "Olivia: It wasn't about the money. It was never just about the money. Your father is my husband, and he has certain claims on things that...",
        "Phillip: Oh, no, he doesn't have a claim on you. Nobody has any claim on you, and he was a fool to try. To hell with him. To tell with the whole damn world. To hell with all of it. I love you.",
        "Olivia: I have waited so long to hear you say that. And I've been trying to tell you something.",
        "Phillip: What? Tell me what?",
        "Olivia: We're going to have a baby.",
        "Phillip: You're...",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: Oh. (laughs) You have made me so happy. You have made me so very, very happy. Olivia? Are you all right?",
        "Olivia: Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I just sort of disappeared there for a minute. What are you doing here?",
        "Phillip: Are you sure you're okay? You fainted at the hospital and I've got to tell you, you still seem like you're a little off.",
        "Olivia: \"Off\"? That's a good word for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Yes, the name is Regina T. Just that she worked as a nanny in the '60s for the Spaulding's. Now, look, I know that's not a lot to go on, but whatever you can... Anything. Anything, are you kidding? And if you do, I will, I'll take you to dinner. At Trotters. Two dinners. All right, thank you very much. Right. How's Zach?",
        "Harley: Sound asleep.",
        "Gus: Good, good.",
        "Harley: I cannot tell you how great it is to see my little boy upstairs asleep in his own bedroom.",
        "Gus: Yeah, and I'm sorry that it was my problems that stopped it from happening sooner, having him home.",
        "Harley: Hey, your problems are about to be solved, right? Was that Sonny Gennaro on the phone?",
        "Gus: Yes, yes. And he's in Chicago, and he's going to dig a little deeper into the Jane Doe, into my mother's file now that we have a name.",
        "Harley: Well, part of a name, anyway.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: What is it that Alexandra Spaulding knows about your birth mother that she doesn't want other people to know?",
        "Gus: I don't know, but I'm pretty damn sure that whatever it was, it was in that safe deposit box.",
        "Harley: Well, that box was cleared out long ago. We can't go back there.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, this time I'm going straight to the source.",
        "Harley: What, you're going to... you think you can get Alexandra to talk?",
        "Gus: I don't think it, I know it.",
        "Harley: How? When?",
        "Gus: When? Oh, when? Right about now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Wow. Hello, your highness.",
        "Edmund: Good evening, Miss Cooper.",
        "Marina: Haven't seen much of you since you've taken up with Alexandra Spaulding.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I know, but she's working late tonight.",
        "Marina: Yes, I know. She's holding my boyfriend captive.",
        "Edmund: Then it looks as if we'll just have to keep one another company.",
        "Marina: Oh, maybe we will.",
        "Buzz: Why don't you keep me company? She's busy tonight.",
        "Marina: Oh, come on. He's harmless.",
        "Edmund: Well, I'm not that harmless, but I am more sinned against than sinning.",
        "Buzz: Really? Then why has that cop been watching you ever since you walked in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Oh, good, Ben, you're still here, because I may need you to make some travel arrangements for Phillip.",
        "Ben: You know, when you offered me a job here, I was hoping for something with a little more growth potential.",
        "Alexandra: (laughs)",
        "Ben: Instead, I'm sitting here with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth from licking...",
        "Alexandra: Frank Cooper! How nice, how nice. Please, sit down. Ben, fix Frank a drink.",
        "Frank: No, thank you. Alex, the reason I stopped by was I needed...",
        "Alexandra: Oh, no, no, no. I know exactly. No need to explain. And you've made a very unnecessary trip here. I want to tell you that I'm as happy about Zach and Harley as you. No need to thank me.",
        "Frank: I'm not here to thank you, Alex. I'm here to take you downtown for questioning.",
        "Alexandra: No, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't just stand there. Will you do something...",
        "Ben: Should I go get Alan? I don't...",
        "Alexandra: No, not a word to Alan or to Phillip. But I want you to call my lawyer. Get him on the telephone. You tell him to meet me downtown, and you tell him I intend to sue anyone who's responsible for this inconvenience.",
        "Frank: Come on, Alex.",
        "Alexandra: Frank, that includes, you, too-- the entire police department and the blessed mayor of Springfield.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: How do you know that man's a police officer?",
        "Buzz: Oh, gee, let me see. My son Frank's a cop, my daughter Harley's a cop, and besides that, this boy drives a government-issued brown sedan, and drinks his coffee black with three sugars.",
        "Marina: Well, what do you think he wants?",
        "Buzz: I'm not a mind-reader.",
        "Edmund: If he truly had his eye on me, he'd be coming over here.",
        "Marina: He is coming over here. Remember, if you need me, I'm good for a candy bar and a pair of socks. You only get one phone call.",
        "Cop: Are you Edmund Winslow?",
        "Edmund: Yes.",
        "Cop: The Edmund Winslow? Former Prince of San Cristobel?",
        "Edmund: Well, so much for your prescience. No, sir, as a matter of fact, I'm the once and future Prince of San Cristobel.",
        "Cop: Well, you're just the man I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You're bringing them in? Alex and Edmund?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Well, I can't take all the credit here. Your brother's helping me do some of the dirty work.",
        "Harley: Frank?",
        "Gus: Mm. Yeah, and he should be picking them up right about now.",
        "Harley: Are you...? My brother is helping you? You roped Frank into helping you?",
        "Gus: You should never underestimate the love of your brother, okay?",
        "Harley: And you should never underestimate Alexandra Spaulding. You ever seen her angry? I mean, really, really angry? What did you tell Frank, anyway?",
        "Gus: I convinced him that we had enough on Alexandra and her buddy for breaking into the safe deposit box.",
        "Harley: So if she doesn't talk...",
        "Gus: If she doesn't talk, we'll squeeze Edmund. I think we can get it out of him. I mean, I don't think it should take that... you think I crossed the line?",
        "Harley: I think you're brilliant.",
        "Gus: Are you worried about something? You worried about Phillip?",
        "Harley: No. No, no, no, no. No, I know that talking to Alex is the only way to do this. I just... you don't know who you're dealing with.",
        "Gus: She doesn't scare me.",
        "Harley: Gus, I'm serious. Don't underestimate her.",
        "Gus: No, no, she should not underestimate me. Okay? You don't play cut and paste with my life. She's trying to stop me from finding out who my mother is, and while I'm at it, I'm going to find out why she's so interested in it. (cell phone rings) Aitoro.",
        "Frank: Yeah, Gus, it's Frank.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: I am not speaking. I am not talking to anyone until my attorney gets here. In fact, don't even ask for the time of day.",
        "Frank: As you probably can hear, the eagle has landed.",
        "Gus: Wow. I owe you big-time, Frank.",
        "Frank: Yeah, you do.",
        "Alexandra: I will not sit down!",
        "Frank: Please tell me you're on your way.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Ten minutes tops.",
        "Frank: Well, you know what? Hurry up and get here before she takes a bite out of one of my deputies.",
        "Gus: Yeah. Frank? Frank? Sounds like she's ripping the police department apart.",
        "Harley: And I'm stuck here? Could you have timed this any worse?",
        "Gus: Well, I'm sorry, honey. I'll make it up to you, you know?",
        "Harley: Okay, I want a full report.",
        "Gus: I'll give you every... every little detail, I promise you.",
        "Harley: Okay. Well, I might have something for you, too, okay?",
        "Gus: Well, you always have something for me.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no, no. About your father. Establishing a connection between your father and Regina. I'm working on that.",
        "Gus: If you tie my father together with Regina, I will clean this house-- for a year.",
        "Harley: Go ahead, get out of here.",
        "Gus: I love you. You know that, right?",
        "Harley: Gus, whatever you find out, whatever your real name turns out to be, you're not alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Look, I'm not going to faint again, if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Phillip: Oh, I'm not worried. I know how strong you are.",
        "Olivia: Hm, \"strong.\" That's my middle name. You know, I always prided myself on being able to handle anything. Almost anything.",
        "Phillip: Well...",
        "Olivia: Look, I need to talk to you about something.",
        "Phillip: Go ahead.",
        "Olivia: No, you. Why don't you just tell me why you came to see me?",
        "Phillip: Well, I didn't, actually. I'm meeting a client for a drink.",
        "Olivia: Oh, of course. No, I... sure. I don't want to keep you.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Are you sure you're all right?",
        "Olivia: Fine.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Olivia: I was... I was expecting Alan, because I left a message for him at the house, and I just have something very important I need to tell him.",
        "Phillip: Oh, okay, well, whatever you have to tell my father is obviously none of my business.",
        "Olivia: Actually, it might be.",
        "Phillip: What does that mean?",
        "Olivia: You know, maybe the person I need to be talking to is you, because you're here. Look, something's been weighing on me. It's something that you need to know, because...",
        "Phillip: Okay, you know what? All right, all right, okay, okay, let's get this over with. I know, and I'm sorry. I probably should have apologized to you sooner. I know I was out of line the other day. I have no right to accuse you of trying to stay with my father for prestige or for security. Listen, I know that you love him in your way. I do.",
        "Olivia: I do, in my way, but that's not...",
        "Phillip: And you know what? Who the hell am I to be giving advice to anybody about anything? Look at my life. I used to have a house full of kids. They're all gone. Lizzie's at boarding school, James is with Beth, Zach's back with Harley. I'm divorced, unattached, going to have drinks with a client on Valentine's Day. Yeah, you're looking for advice? This is the guy to come to for advice. No, no, no, no, no, my life... my life, lately, has been one mistake after another.",
        "Olivia: Me, too?",
        "Phillip: You, too, what?",
        "Olivia: Was I a mistake, Phillip? Are you sorry that we were together? The truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Alex, cut me some slack, will you? I'm just doing my job, here.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I hope you're thinking about making a career change, Frank, because when I finish with you, you're going to need one. Good, good. Thank goodness you're here. Now, my attorney.",
        "Ben: He's on a golf course in Barbados.",
        "Alexandra: Barbad...",
        "Ben: He suggested an associate whom I called, but unfortunately, he's busy interviewing prospects at the University of Michigan law school.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Well, maybe I can just manage for both of them to go back to law school.",
        "Frank: That's all right, Alex. You know, the court can appoint you a public defender.",
        "Alexandra: No, thank you. I think I will invoke my rights to remain silent for the time being.",
        "Frank: Okay. Oh, man. I've never been happier in my life to see you.",
        "Gus: You're scaring me, Frank.",
        "Frank: All right, she's all yours. Let's go, Ben.",
        "Gus: Right. We're not going to use the light bulb technique because, well, we're friends. So we're just going to have ourselves a nice little chit- chat.",
        "Alexandra: Sorry. No attorney, no chit-chat.",
        "Gus: Hm. I'll make sure you get your lawyer. But we've got to start this thing off, okay, because it's rather important.",
        "Alexandra: Well, we have nothing to say to each other. Zach is back with his mother.",
        "Gus: This has got nothing to do with Zach.",
        "Edmund: This is ridiculous! I want my attorney present before I say a word!",
        "Gus: Look at that. Just in time, your partner in crime.",
        "Edmund: What the hell is going on here?",
        "Gus: Nick, put him in the other room. And give him some tea and scones. Now, Alexandra, I think you should start talking, because the way I see it, you've got about five seconds before Edmund Winslow rolls over on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phillip: You're asking me if I'm sorry that we made love? Is that what you're asking me?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, that's what I'm asking you. Are you?",
        "Phillip: Well, I think it's safe to say it's been one misunderstanding after another since we did.",
        "Olivia: Well, okay, but if you could go back and change a few things, would you? Or would you have done the same thing?",
        "Phillip: We can't do that. We can't go back. We can't change anything. What happened, happened, and let's be honest, we just, you know, we got caught up in our emotions.",
        "Olivia: What difference does that make? That means something. Emotions matter. Otherwise, what else is there?",
        "Phillip: You know what? I don't know that it really does either of us any good to discuss this, you know. I'll be honest with you, I'm just happy that we didn't end up hurting more people, because when I had my one indiscretion with Beth, it cost me my marriage to Harley, and it almost cost Beth her marriage to Jim.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, well, it also gave you James.",
        "Phillip: Well, yes, that's true. So, there it is. Something great can come from a mistake, even a big one.",
        "Olivia: You really believe that?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, of course, I do. Don't you?",
        "Olivia: I do. And I'm glad to hear you say that because...",
        "Phillip: Because what?",
        "Olivia: Just because. I don't want to keep you from your client.",
        "Phillip: Okay, yeah, I should go, he's waiting.",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: I'll see you.",
        "Olivia: Phillip, wait.",
        "Phillip: Olivia, come on. Now what is there left to say? Don't you think that we have hurt each other enough?",
        "Olivia: I don't want to hurt anybody, especially you. But you said that something good can come out of something bad, right?",
        "Phillip: Yes, yes. If you're very lucky, sometimes it can, but let's be honest about the situation here. You're married to my father, and I tried my damnedest to come between the two of you, okay? You know? I mean, I've never been a big believer in the wages of sin, but I'm changing my mind, because I think I'm paying them now.",
        "Olivia: But what if I could tell you it was all worth it? I mean, what if for all our sins and all our mistakes, one good thing could have come from all of this? Would that change anything?",
        "Phillip: What are you trying to tell me?",
        "Bellhop: Ms. Spencer, call for you on line six.",
        "Olivia: Take a message, please.",
        "Bellhop: She says it's important.",
        "Olivia: Who?",
        "Bellhop: Wouldn't give her name.",
        "Phillip: It's all right. Go ahead, please. My client is waiting for me, and I need to go. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Bellhop: The phone?",
        "Olivia: The phone. Olivia Spencer. How can I help you?",
        "Monica: It's how I can help you.",
        "Olivia: Who is this?",
        "Monica: It's someone who used to work for your husband before he decided he could get along without me. Big mistake, especially since I had problems with what he did.",
        "Olivia: Who are you, and why should I listen to you?",
        "Monica: Because as bad as he was to me, it's nothing compared to what he's done to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: So this job with Spaulding is not exactly what you thought it would be.",
        "Ben: To say the least. I just... I thought it would be an easy gig, you know. An old friend of my father's, plenty of Spaulding money to throw around. But I'm starting to think it's not going to be as lucrative or fulfilling as I'd hoped.",
        "Ross: Yeah. Well, you're a bright, young man, and when Alexandra comes to appreciate that, things will change. And I think things will fall into place.",
        "Ben: \"Things will fall into place.\" That'd be nice.",
        "Ross: This is more than just about work, isn't it?",
        "Ben: Ah, you know, to tell you the truth, Ross, everything's just kind of tough right now. My job and my situation with Marina.",
        "Ross: Oh, yes, dating a girl against her family's wishes, a subject that's dear to my heart.",
        "Ben: Yes, but you and Blake, that was a while back. Things have...",
        "Ross: Yeah, still to this day, Blake's father, Roger Thorpe, still addresses our mail to \"Christina Blake Thorpe and family.\"",
        "Ben: What? So that means Frank Cooper will treat me the same way if me and Marina get married or have three kids?",
        "Ross: No, no, no. Frank is a reasonable man, and if you truly care about Marina, he will come around eventually. Most father's do.",
        "Ben: You know something, Ross? I really do care about Marina.",
        "Ross: Good.",
        "Ben: She's very special. I mean, at first she was just kind of just hanging around, and it was flattering, you know, but also a little annoying, but as I got to know her, I realized she's really wonderful. Am I'm making sense here? I'm sorry, I don't mean to throw this on you.",
        "Ross: Don't apologize. I know exactly what you're talking about.",
        "Ben: I just... I really need something to be easy right now, you know? My job is a pain, my relationship is tricky, I feel like I'm walking on this tightrope. And I don't know. I'm just looking for a break. For awhile there, everything was coming so easy, and now nothing is easy.",
        "Ross: Oh, Ben, welcome to the real world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Hey.",
        "Harley: Thanks for coming.",
        "Frank: Not a problem. You know, if you weren't my sister, I'd like to have stayed at the station, watch all the fireworks, but more importantly, how's Zach? Big reunion with Jude, did it go well?",
        "Harley: Yeah, it was great. It was great. They're upstairs passed out now. It's like he never left.",
        "Frank: Well that's cool. So it's a good time for this, huh.",
        "Harley: You brought it. Thank you.",
        "Frank: You know, this better be important, sis, because I owe a huge favor to a certain little secretary in Springfield PD, so...",
        "Harley: Then take her to dinner and movie. You might actually get lucky.",
        "Frank: Right. What's the big deal about Joe August's employment record anyway?",
        "Harley: I need to figure out where he was when...",
        "Frank: What?",
        "Harley: He was a foot patrolman.",
        "Frank: Yeah. Yeah, he was. And let's see where his beat was. His beat was right here on Michigan Boulevard, running all the way down to 73rd street.",
        "Harley: Bingo.",
        "Frank: What?",
        "Harley: That's where the Spaulding's lived before they moved to Springfield. So that's where Joe August was assigned before he was called to duty and before Regina T. died.",
        "Frank: Who's Regina T.?",
        "Harley: Joe August was a beat cop.",
        "Frank: Yeah, it's a good job. You know, you got a regular route.",
        "Harley: Get to know people, right?",
        "Frank: Yeah, and pretty soon they feel like family.",
        "Harley: Right. So maybe... maybe... maybe Joe August, you know, he came back on leave, he decided to visit the old neighborhood, stop by the beat, say hello to some people, he runs into a pretty, young Italian nanny pushing master Phillip Spaulding in his pram, and they get to know each other. That wouldn't be a stretch, would it?",
        "Frank: Look, anything's possible, sis. But what does this have to do with Gus finding out who is mother is?",
        "Harley: Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. Of course, the person who knows wasn't talking. I have a feeling, though, that that's about to change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Look, Gus, I haven't committed any crime. You really can't keep me here.",
        "Gus: What would you call breaking into Roy Baker's safe deposit box?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I wouldn't call it anything because I didn't do it.",
        "Gus: Oh. So you had Edmund Winslow do it for you. That just makes you an accessory.",
        "Alexandra: That's preposterous.",
        "Gus: Is it? You know what? Let me go next door, talk to Edmund, see what he has to say.",
        "Alexandra: All right, Gus, wait, wait, wait. Look...",
        "Gus: That's fine.",
        "Alexandra: I've already admitted to you. I was only trying to help Phillip in the custody case with Zach. And then Roy Baker came to me with some information.",
        "Gus: All right. Now we're talking.",
        "Alexandra: He said he had a key to a safety deposit box. It was something important inside that I needed to see.",
        "Gus: For a price?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, I paid him some money. You know, only because you and Harley were so interested in what was in that box. And I just assumed it was something scandalous in your past. Something scandalous that frankly could effect my grand-nephew.",
        "Gus: You know, I have heard this before. You've tried to sell this to me before. I'm not buying it.",
        "Alexandra: Well, it's the truth. And I sent Edmund to look into Harley's ring to find the number of the box. And then I got a court order so that the bank manager in Chicago could open the box.",
        "Gus: Oh, really, a court order? And they did that for you?",
        "Alexandra: For Edmund. And it was all very legal, Gus.",
        "Gus: Was it? Smitty? Thank you. Is it possible that you might know this guy?",
        "Alexandra: No.",
        "Gus: No? That's funny. Because he knows of you. He's the manager of the bank in Chicago, where the box is located. Now, sir, what was it exactly that compelled you to open that box?",
        "Bank manager: Well, I'm a businessman, and Ms. Spaulding opened a rather large account at my bank.",
        "Gus: Did she give you a rather large finder's fee at the same time?",
        "Bank manager: Well, a certain percentage is always given... yes.",
        "Gus: Oh, yes, I see. Yes. So she basically paid you off.",
        "Alexandra: That is a lie.",
        "Gus: Well, I've got the... I've got the sworn statement from this guy, and I've got the bank documents, and I think that's pretty much all the D.A.'s going to need, so I think you should start cooperating.",
        "Alexandra: What do you want from me? I've told you everything I know. I was only trying to help Phillip.",
        "Gus: Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin. We'll call you. And don't leave Chicago; we might want to prosecute.",
        "Alexandra: Gus, this is ridiculous. There was nothing in that box except some faded newspaper clippings.",
        "Gus: And where are they? I'd like to see them.",
        "Alexandra: I took them home.",
        "Gus: Well, I would like to see them now.",
        "Alexandra: (chuckles) Well, I'm afraid that's impossible.",
        "Gus: Let me tell you something, Alexandra. I really hope to God it's not impossible, okay, because I have been very nice, and I have been very civilized, and I would really, really hate to see this thing get ugly.",
        "Alexandra: Look, I don't know how to tell you this, Gus, but the downstairs maid inadvertently threw them out.",
        "Gus: \"The downstairs maid\"? Well, let's get the downstairs maid in here.",
        "Alexandra: Well, fine if you can find her. But the stupid girl broke a very valuable porcelain vase, so I had to let her go.",
        "Gus: Well, you've got all the answers, don't you, Alexandra? (sighs) What if I was to ask you about the papers in the box? What would you tell me? They're all faded, couldn't read a word?",
        "Alexandra: Well, they were faded, and I did, yes, I read them. And there was absolutely nothing of importance in them to anyone.",
        "Gus: Alexandra, you are a liar. You know damn well that those papers were related to somebody in Chicago that you knew a long time ago. Phillip's nanny? A young, pretty woman by the name of Regina? Oh, yes. Oh, now it rings a bell, doesn't it? And she wasn't just Phillip's nanny. Regina was my mother. You knew that. And you've known it all along. And you kept that information from me.",

        "Marina: Hm.",
        "Ben: It's been kind of a crazy day. And I have a feeling I'm still on call.",
        "Buzz: Welcome to the real world.",
        "Ben: You're not the first person to say that to me, Buzz. You're not even the first person today. And I don't mind the workload. That's what I signed on for. But Alexandra keeps me like a gopher. You know, if I'm not making travel arrangements or licking stamps, you know, I'm trying to track down her lawyer to get her out of jail.",
        "Buzz: Alex is in jail?",
        "Ben: Yeah. They brought her in for questioning, and do not say anything to anybody, please. She's very sensitive about it.",
        "Buzz: I can imagine. I don't suppose you saw Edmund Winslow anywhere around the police station.",
        "Ben: They brought him in as I was leaving.",
        "Marina: Well, what did he do?",
        "Ben: Hey, look, no one would tell me. All right, but things looked very serious. It could be a while before I get my next assignment from Alexandra. (sighs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Your mother. Are you saying that one of the nannies that attended Phillip was... was your mother?",
        "Gus: Very good. Very, very good. A lot of subtle shades. But, Alexandra, that's still... it's not an award-winning performance. Now you do remember the nanny. You do remember her name. And you know damn well that she was my mother, don't you?",
        "Alexandra: Well, all right, Gus, this explains why you're acting like this, because you think...",
        "Gus: I don't think, I know!",
        "Alexandra: Oh, Gus, this is an incredible coincidence, because I had no idea. I was looking for something in the box that maybe you had done. I had no idea it had any involvement with the former...",
        "Gus: (slams furniture)",
        "Alexandra: No, no.",
        "Gus: Don't give me that. First of all, Roy Baker told you about the box, didn't he? He told you who it belonged to. It belonged to Regina, didn't it? Didn't it?",
        "Alexandra: Well, ask Roy Baker.",
        "Gus: No, I'm asking you! You know what? I'm just going to file this with the D.A., I'm going to let him grill you for a couple hours, because I can't handle this.",
        "Alexandra: All right, Gus, you persist on making threats like this, you're going to force me to tell you something that you don't want to hear. For God sakes, the girl is dead.",
        "Gus: Don't call her \"the girl.\" Don't call her \"the girl.\" She's got a name. She's a got a first name and a last name. (slams desk) What was her name?!",
        "Alexandra: I don't recall.",
        "Gus: (Slams desk) What was her name? You do know it!",
        "Alexandra: It started with a T, I think, but I'm not.. will you stop badgering me?",
        "Gus: Why did you have Edmund Winslow break the law just so he could his hands on a couple of useful clippings?",
        "Alexandra: I'm asking you please don't go...",
        "Gus: Why? Why did you pay Roy Baker off and send him out of the country? What did Roy Baker know? What did he know? Why did you risk a criminal record? Why would you do that? Do you have some sort of big family secret you're trying to hide? Huh, why would you send a guy out of the country? Why?",
        "Alexandra: It wasn't my family secret, it was yours. Gus, I told you, I was only trying to help Phillip. I would do anything to help him get Zach. But I'm also very fond of Harley, and what I know could be very damaging.",
        "Gus: Damaging for who. I don't understand. You said it was about my family. If it's about my... I have a right to know. I have a right to know!",
        "Alexandra: All right. Regina, well, didn't exactly have the best taste in men. She was consorting with some very unsavory characters, characters we didn't want around. And when we asked her to change her ways, she refused, so I... I let her go.",
        "Gus: You let her go. You abandoned her with no money, no doctors, and she ended up in a slum down in the south side of Chicago, where she died giving birth to me, right?",
        "Alexandra: Gus, I'm so sorry about that. We didn't know she was pregnant.",
        "Gus: Well, that's funny that you say that, because you knew she was my mother.",
        "Alexandra: Not until I met Roy Baker.",
        "Gus: So then you found that out and you did what?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I suppressed the information.",
        "Gus: Why?!",
        "Alexandra: Anyone would.",
        "Gus: Why would you do that?!",
        "Alexandra: I told you, because Regina, she-she-she...",
        "Gus: She went with unsavory guys. Yeah, what was his name? (bangs desk) I want a name!",
        "Alexandra: Regina was under the protection of Miguel Santos at the end. Gus, I didn't want to tell you. I wish there was some way...",
