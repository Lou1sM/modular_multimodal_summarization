Jonathan rushes over and tells Tammy what is going on, telling her to go to the bar and wait for him. Tammy instead goes to Sandy's where he reveals the tape of Jonathan threatening his life. Tammy tells him that the best thing would be for Sandy to leave town. He agrees and gives Tammy the tape, but after she leaves, says that things are not over between them. Lizzie taunts Ava that she missed her chance with Coop and tells her to move out since she is moving back in. Coop interrupts and says that Ava isn't going anywhere and Lizzie tells him that she doesn't have any place to go since Quinn kicked her out. Coop agrees to help but after he leaves Beth shows up and tells Lizzie that she has reactivated all of her accounts and she wants the two of them to be close again. Lizzie hugs her mom and runs off to buy Quinn's apartment. Lizzie goes to Outskirts and tells Jonathan that if he rehires Ava she will pay her salary, Jonathan who is already in a bad mood since Tammy isn't back yet, kicks her out. Inside Company, Coop tells Ava he doesn't want things to be awkward between them anymore and admits that he does have feelings for her. Ava tells him what happened with Alan-Michael and the shower and Coop says he wouldn't have had as much restraint. Jeffrey tells Cassie that they slept together while he was posing as Richard. Cassie is shocked and tells Jeffrey she doesn't think she can forgive him. When he goes to pack his stuff though, Cassie tells him to stop since they always said that they wouldn't run away from their problems. She asks for some time to work things out."

        "Lizzie: Perfect. Every single thing I own my entire life is out on the street. If this doesn't make Coop step up and save me, I don't know what will.",

        "Coop: Ava, could you hold on a sec?",
        "Ava: Nope, sorry, morning receipts. I've got to go, help out the new guy, but I'll see you later. Lizzie, what is all this? Are you all right?",
        "Lizzie: Do I look all right?",
        "Ava: What happened?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing. I'm just homeless, that's all.",
        "Ava: Quinn kicked you out, huh?",
        "Lizzie: He had to sell the penthouse, all right. I had to go.",
        "Ava: Oh, that's such a shame, you lost your sugar daddy.",
        "Lizzie: Did I torture you when you were living in a car?",
        "Ava: Only because you didn't know. So now what? You going to slum it up at the family mansion?",
        "Lizzie: Actually, I'm moving back to the boarding house. I'm taking my room back, just as soon as your sorry butt is gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You actually think we can fix this place up?",
        "Tammy: I learned from my mom. She can turn a place worst then this into something warm and cozy.",
        "Jonathan: Mm.",
        "Tammy: Just like home.",
        "Jonathan: ( Sighs ) Nice trick, but my favorite trick of hers is the Edmund trick. Everybody hates the guy, then they get together and the whole town accepts it. I would really like to know how they did that.",
        "Tammy: Not everybody in town hates you.",
        "Jonathan: Right, just the important people like your mom. And do you honestly think she's ever going to be okay with us living together?",
        "Tammy: I'll turn her around. Okay? It won't happen right away, but it will happen.",
        "Jonathan: You sure about that?",
        "Tammy: I'll wear her down. I'm going to meet her at Company right now. She might see you like Edmund today, but before long, you'll be like Jeffrey.",
        "Jonathan: Is that a good thing?",
        "Tammy: To my mom it is. See you back here later.",
        "Jonathan: Don't get lost!",
        "Tammy: Never. ( Tires screeching )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, what's wrong?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: For what now?",
        "Jeffrey: For making things worse, for causing you even more pain. That's something I never wanted to do, Cassie, you have to believe that.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey, when I was talking about Jonathan about lying about who he was, I didn't mean you, you know.",
        "Jeffrey: I know.",
        "Cassie: Because it's completely different.",
        "Jeffrey: I know it. It's not--",
        "Cassie: He seduced her.",
        "Jeffrey: It's not that different, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: I don't follow.",
        "Jeffrey: When we were in San Cristobel, when I was impersonating Richard, Cassie I uh... we... we made love. I slept with you. Listen, it was torture for me impersonating Richard, impersonating your husband, having you look at me and not being able to tell you, having you look at me and see him.",
        "Cassie: My God.",
        "Jeffrey: I told you, I fell in love with you. Every minute that I spent was--",
        "Cassie: A lie.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, but it was very real to me. Cassie, it was the most real thing I had ever experienced.",
        "Cassie: God. I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Jeffrey: I... I tried to resist. I wouldn't look at you sometimes. I wouldn't allow myself to. I wouldn't touch you. Until...",
        "Cassie: Until?",
        "Jeffrey: Until that night. We both had a couple of glasses of champagne.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. The reception for the British Ambassador.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: That was the night, right? The night of that reception.",
        "Jeffrey: How could you--",
        "Cassie: I just know. That was the night that you climbed into my bed and you took something from me. You took something from me and from my husband.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: We both know how this is going to end.",
        "Ava: Hmmm, how is it going to end?",
        "Lizzie: You had your chance with Coop at the inn. He was vulnerable, I hurt him. But nothing happened, did it?",
        "Ava: What did Coop say?",
        "Lizzie: That despite all of my mistakes, he still loves me.",
        "Ava: You don't really know how lucky you are, do you?",
        "Lizzie: Uh-huh.",
        "Ava: No, I don't think you do.",
        "Lizzie: Is this really a fight you want to have? Because it was so sad what Sandy did to you. We all had to watch you pine for him when he was in love with Tammy. You don't really want to do that to yourself again, do you?",
        "Ava: He is too good for you and I think you know it. That's why you did what you did with Quinn, because were you desperate. And because you know Coop is too good, too kind and too decent for you, and you're waiting for him to figure that out.",
        "Lizzie: When are you going to move yourself out? I'd love to move in asap.",
        "Coop: You're not going anywhere, Ava.",
        "Ava: Coop?",
        "Coop: That room upstairs is yours. No arguments about that. Truth of the matter is we actually need the rent.",
        "Lizzie: But I can pay now.",
        "Coop: Mm-hm, with whose money?",
        "Ava: Listen, you know, I'm just going to excuse myself.",
        "Lizzie: That's a good idea.",
        "Coop: Ava, can you please take care of my tables and I'll be in as soon as I can.",
        "Ava: Take your time.",
        "Coop: Thanks. Okay, Lizzie, well, um...",

        "Jonathan: Good-bye.",
        "Sandy: Wait, wait, don't hang up. I wanted to tell you how especially good Tammy looks today. Wow, pink is her color.",
        "Jonathan: You stay the hell away from her.",
        "Sandy: Too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Listen, maybe this isn't about just me needing a place. I need you. I want you.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie. Look, it's not that I don't want you, too. It's just that--",
        "Lizzie: It's just what?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I don't know if we can get back to where we once were, all right. I mean, yes, sometimes I think about it and we will and maybe--",
        "Lizzie: Just sometimes?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you lied to me. For months you lied, and then this whole Quinn storyline--",
        "Lizzie: Yes, I lied. I know I lied, but not just to you. I wasn't honest with me about me. I lied to myself. Don't you see, I get it now. As long as I am honest about who I am, then I don't have any reason to lie anymore.",
        "Coop: About what?",
        "Lizzie: About... how weak I am. I told you back at the inn it is something that I hate about myself, but I tried. I tried to give up everything that I was used to, the comforts, the attitudes.",
        "Coop: Yeah, only you can't.",
        "Lizzie: No, I can't. And I can't give you up, either. I love you, Coop.",
        "Coop: Look, Lizzie, I'll look around. I'll ask some friends; I'll see what I can do to help you out, but I just got to get back to work right now, okay?",
        "Lizzie: I don't understand.",

        "Coop: About why you've been avoiding me.",

        "Lizzie: We cannot just sit around here waiting for a miracle to happen. Money and places to sleep do not just fall out of the sky. Mom, what are you-- what's that?",
        "Beth: Open it.",
        "Lizzie: Cash. A lot of cash and a really big check. What is this?",
        "Beth: It's yours, Lizzie. It's your money.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my God.",
        "Beth: Your credit card has been activated. Your checking account and savings account books are in there, and no, you're not dreaming.",
        "Lizzie: But why?",
        "Beth: Because I'm taking charge of my life, Lizzie. I'm putting myself back where I need to be, and I want you there with me.",

        "Cassie: I had a dream that day. I remember it was so hot. I wore that mint green dress. And I had had too much to drink, and I remember I went upstairs looking for you-- I mean Richard. I went upstairs looking for Richard. And then we... you and I...",
        "Jeffrey: Are you saying that you actually knew?",
        "Cassie: No. Yes, I... no, of course not. Of course I didn't know. Yes, I could tell something was different, but how would I know it was that?",
        "Jeffrey: You couldn't. It was my job to make sure you didn't know.",
        "Cassie: Your job. It was your job? Don't you think I would know how it feels to be in my own husband's arms? Don't you think I would know how it feels to be held by him, and what he smelled like and how he kissed me? He was the love of my life, and I was always true to him, always.",
        "Jeffrey: You couldn't have known.",
        "Cassie: No, well, I know one thing for sure, Jeffrey, I know there's nothing more intimate and sacred in marriage than giving yourself to the man you love. And I gave myself... I gave myself to a complete stranger. I gave myself to a liar.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, please.",
        "Cassie: And this makes me a liar.",

As much as there have been times I wanted to slap Josh because he is so honorable and always has to do the right thing and just doesn't understand Reva.

        "Jeffrey: I'm so sorry.",

        "Lizzie: What kind of things? Oh, Granddad's death?",
        "Beth: Actually, Alan does have a lot to do with it.",

        "Beth: Honey, I've turned a corner. I've turned a corner and there is no going back. I guess what I want to say to you is that... you always scared me because you always went after what you wanted, and I wanted to pull you in. I wanted to rein you back. But they'll be no more pulling back for either one of us. I want you to take this money and I hope that you'll use wisdom with the power and freedom that that money will give you. I hope one day that you can forgive me for being afraid of you and that you and I can find our way back to where we were once.",
        "Lizzie: I want that, too. And you have really good timing.",
        "Beth: Thank you.",

        "Coop: Awkward. It's like you and I hardly talk.",
        "Ava: You know what? I'm sorry I've been acting like a freak. Maybe Lizzie's right, I should find a new place. I can't live in a boarding house forever.",
        "Coop: You don't want to live here? Wait a minute, I thought you liked it here.",
        "Ava: I do, but--",
        "Coop: Ava, I thought we were friends, you know. More than friends, maybe.",
        "Ava: Look, I drank a little too much at the inn and I said some things that--",
        "Coop: Things that needed to be said, things I really wanted to hear.",
        "Ava: What?",
        "Coop: Ava, you kind of got up and ran off before I could say anything. Look, I was trying to say to you I understand, and I knew what you were feeling is hard when you have these thoughts and these feelings about someone, but you're afraid that you can't let them know them. Just like the way you felt that your feelings towards me, you had to keep them buried. Ava, that's what I was doing towards you. I've been doing the exact same thing. What I'm trying to say is that, Ava, I have the same feelings for you, too.",

        "Ava: A confession, exactly. I would have never done what I did by telling you my feelings, okay, except that night you seemed like you were so over Lizzie. And I went and got in the shower and when the door opened, and someone came in--",

        "Ava: Alan-Michael Spaulding.",
        "Coop: Alan-Michael-- what?",
        "Ava: It's not that big of a deal. He came in and looked and you know, and then he left. That was it.",
        "Coop: He came in, looked, saw and left?",
        "Ava: Yes.",
        "Coop: Wow, the guy's got more self-power than I do.",
        "Ava: So...",
        "Coop: Gosh. So uh... look, I'm glad we could finally talk.",
        "Ava: Yeah, me, too. Have a talk, that's good.",
        "Coop: Yeah, I mean get things back to normal, you know and make things better between us.",
        "Ava: Normal and comfortable.",
        "Coop: Oh, geez. Table five. I um... I've got to take care of them. I, um...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: I was in love with you, Cassie. I know what I did was wrong. I knew it when I was doing it. And I've known it every single day since.",
        "Cassie: And you just didn't care?",
        "Jeffrey: Didn't care? Cassie, I didn't know how to stop caring! That's what the problem was. I couldn't stop caring! And then there we were, just the two of us together, all of the time, alone. And after feeling the way I'd been feeling about you, not being able to tell you and not being able to show you, there we were, on our own. Cassie, it was like a dream for me. And I couldn't stop. I didn't want to stop to think about it. I didn't want it to fall apart. It was a dream. And for the first time since I arrived in San Cristobel, I dropped my guard and I thought about myself first. I thought about what I wanted, and I took it. I knew the job would end, that I would never see you again. And I would have to get over you. I would have to. But that didn't happen. I couldn't give you up. I couldn't let you go. I didn't want to live my life without you. I still don't want to live my life without you! But now I guess I'm going to have to.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. You just might have to.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, at least now you know. Now you know everything. You know how I felt, you know how I feel. You know how I will always feel. And just so you know, yes, there were other times, Cassie. There were other possibilities; there were chances, but nothing happened. We didn't-- I didn't. Okay? You have to know that. After that night, I wasn't the same. And I couldn't do that, never again.",
        "Cassie: What, one night with me changed you, changed you completely. One night like that was so powerful?",
        "Jeffrey: I hope you can forgive me. I can't change what I did, Cassie, but I can't help but hope we can still have a life together. And if you can't-- if you won't, then well then that's it. I'll have lost everything. Please, give me a chance to make it right. Okay, I can be gone by tonight, if that's what you want. Is that what you want? Cassie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Ava, you okay?",
        "Ava: Yeah, I'm good, cool, normal, comfortable.",
        "Coop: Oh, geez, table five again.",
        "Ava: I got it.",
        "Coop: Why don't we take care of that. But before we get back to the normalcy that we've been talking about. I think there's something we have left to do, don't you?",
        "Ava: Sure.",
        "Coop: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Wherever you are, I'm going.",
        "Tammy: Where are you going?",
        "Jonathan: Where were you?",
        "Tammy: Who cares, I'm here now.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Look, I didn't want to tell you because I knew you would try to stop me, but I went to see Sandy.",
        "Jonathan: Unbelievable.",
        "Tammy: It was okay. Believe me, he's not planning anything.",
        "Jonathan: You think so, huh?",
        "Tammy: He had this stupid tape of you threatening him. I had no idea what he was going to do with it, but I have it now. It's over.",
        "Jonathan: A tape?",
        "Tammy: Of you saying that you'd kill him. To tell you the truth, it freaked me out when I heard it. I don't know what Sandy did to get to you.",
        "Jonathan: He used you to get to me. What do you think he did? He deliberately did that because he knows how to set me off.",
        "Tammy: I figured that. Everything is fine now. Okay, whatever he had going on in his head, it's over.",
        "Jonathan: You sure about that.",
        "Tammy: I told him to stay away, Jonathan. I told him I can't see him or talk to him ever again because I don't know what you'll do.",
        "Jonathan: And you're sure that will take care of it?",
        "Tammy: I'm not-- I don't think, I know it. It's time to relax and enjoy our new place.",
        "Jonathan: Relax?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Damn you Jonathan, why didn't you just die when you fell off the cliff?! You need to just go away!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: All right, um, I'll pack my bags. I'll try not to take too long.",
        "Cassie: Wait.",
        "Cassie: We made an arrangement, remember? When we first started seeing each other, we said that if we fought, no matter how angry we got--",
        "Jeffrey: We'd never just walk away.",
        "Cassie: Right. That we'd either find some kind of ending, some kind of resolution. We'd either figure things out and move forward or we would walk away without questions, without wondering. If we weren't sure, we would stay together until we knew.",
        "Jeffrey: So you're not sure, you mean...",
        "Cassie: I don't know what I mean. But I know I can't forgive you, at least not right now. I can't even imagine forgiving you. But... don't go. Not just yet.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: But, please, don't say another word.",

        "Reva: It is beautiful.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Just a little something to keep you company while I'm gone."
