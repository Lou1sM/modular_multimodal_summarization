        "Dinah: Oh, my god. That is so perfect. Cassie is never going to forgive edmund for setting the fire.",
        "Jonathan: Or for trying to murder jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Dinah: When... when, when is reva going to tell cassie?",
        "Jonathan: Well, it could be happening right now. I guess you're not mad at me anymore?",
        "Dinah: I'm coming around.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, the way I see it...( kissing heavily ) ...we're even. You used me to fire a fire under edmund, I set reva ablaze.",
        "Dinah: Oh, my gosh, all this talk about fire is making me hot, you know that? ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: Is it working?",
        "Dinah: Hmm-mm.",
        "Jonathan: Hmm-mm. You want to go upstairs and celebrate? I'm growing fond of josh and reva's bed.",
        "Dinah: Me, too. Maybe... maybe we should wait on the whole celebration thing, until reva tells cassie. ( Laughs ) whoa.",
        "Jonathan: Would you let your sister marry a lying, pyromaniac murderer?",
        "Dinah: Who am I to judge? I'm not reva.",
        "Jonathan: Exactly. How about upstairs right now-- me, you and those 300 thread count sheets.",
        "Dinah: Okay. ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: Edmund smacks jeffrey with the shovel, jeffrey goes down, drops his lantern, fire starts.",
        "Reva: Jeffrey would have done something, he would have pressed charges.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, if he know. He caught from behind.",
        "Reva: I can't believe this.",
        "Jonathan: I think you're scared that edmund is still very much a threat to me, you and cassie.",
        "Edmund: Bourbon on the rocks. Make it a double. Reva? Perhaps you'd like to be alone right now. Excuse me.",
        "Reva: Did you ever have a really difficult decision that you had to make, and the answer just happened to fall right into your lap?",
        "Edmund: I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.",
        "Reva: Well, sit down. I'll tell 'ya.",
        "Sandy: Okay, okay. Oh, that's it. Enough it enough.",
        "Tammy: Well, I'm going to the gym. You'll have the place to yourself in a few more minutes.",
        "Sandy: And you'll be back.",
        "Tammy: Is that a problem?",
        "Sandy: Yes, yes, it's a big problem. And there's only one solution. Tammy, you've got to move out. The sooner the better.",
        "Gus: I know that this is very painful for you, okay. But sometimes the best way to ease that hurt is just to say it out loud, just to tell the truth. This way you can put it behind you. And you can start healing like you need to, and like you want to. So, tell us what happened.",
        "Lizzie: ( Sobbing )",
        "Gus: Go on. Go on.",
        "Lizzie: I did it.",
        "Gus: You picked up the gun.",
        "Lizzie: I did it. I killed him. I picked up the gun and I killed him. Isn't that what you want you want to hear? I killed him.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, not another word. Not another word. Your honor, this is a travesty. My granddaughter has no idea what she is saying now.",
        "Beth: For god's sakes, do something. Object.",
        "Judge: Order.",
        "Beth: What's wrong with you?",
        "Judge: Please, ladies and gentlemen, this is a court of law, not A...",
        "Alan: This is not a court of law, it's a circus. And I want it to stop now!",
        "Beth: Your honor, my daughter is confused and upset...",
        "Lizzie: Stop it! All of you, please. You all just pushed and pushed and pushed for the truth, and i am standing here telling you that, yeah, okay, I did it. Aren't you happy? I'm guilty. God help me, but I'm guilty. This portion of \"guiding light\" is sponsored by: Ortho women's health. Be heard, live well.",
        "Sandy: You drive me crazy in a good way, a great way. And I can't take one more day of this girl being my plutonic roommate kind of way.",
        "Tammy: Oh, that kind of a way.",
        "Sandy: And if you stay, I'm going to push too hard and screw everything up. So, you gotta go.",
        "Tammy: I guess I'm out of here.",
        "Sandy: I guess so. So, where do you live?",
        "Tammy: Obviously not here.",
        "Sandy: Great. Awesome. Now we can do things right.",
        "Tammy: What things?",
        "Sandy: Dinner, movies, flowers. See, we're not living together anymore. So now we can start dating. And I can treat you like the gorgeous, amazing woman you are.",
        "Tammy: Dating, huh? As in you asking me out and i think about it, play hard to get.",
        "Sandy: Exactly. You play hard to get, I'll work hard to get you. I've got to go. Double check the bathroom on your way out to make sure you get all of your hair stuff, and that lotion that drives me crazy.",
        "Tammy: It drives you crazy in a good way, right?",
        "Sandy: Oh, very good way. And one last thing: Leave the key under the door. ( Laughter )",
        "Dinah: I feel like I'm a kid again, making out on the couch.",
        "Jonathan: With the bad boy from across town? ( Laughter )",
        "Dinah: Do you feel bad setting up reva?",
        "Jonathan: Do you feel bad betraying edmund's secret?",
        "Dinah: No, because it's for a good cause. Ow.",
        "Jonathan: ( Speaking like a monster ) destroying cassie's marriage.",
        "Dinah: Oh, wait, that turns me on.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah? Ruining her life?",
        "Dinah: Hmm-mm.",
        "Jonathan: I'll bet she'll never trust again.",
        "Dinah: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: I'll bet she'll never marry again.",
        "Dinah: Oh, yeah.",
        "Jonathan: I'll bet she'll wither into an old fossil and be A...",
        "Dinah: Yes, yes... ( laughing together ) wait, come here.",
        "Jonathan: Someone's coming. You gotta go out the back way.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Jonathan: You've got to go out.",
        "Dinah: Why?",
        "Jonathan: Because someone's coming.",
        "Dinah: Okay, listen. I want you to call me when you know something.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, I'll call and give you every dirty little detail.",
        "Dinah: Okay, all right. All right. I hope they don't ground you.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, funny. I hope you don't break a hip on the way out. Hello, joshua.",
        "Josh: Where's reva?",
        "Jonathan: She left a while ago. She didn't say where she was going. I don't know.",
        "Josh: You don't know where she went?",
        "Jonathan: I'm not sure.",
        "Josh: Was she upset?",
        "Jonathan: Uh, no. She seemed okay to me.",
        "Josh: Jonathan. When I left reva, she was fixated on this dream she'd had. You were in it.",
        "Jonathan: Oh. Did I hack her up and put her in the meat freezer? You can check the meat tray, it's empty.",
        "Josh: Strangely enough, you were the victim in this dream.",
        "Jonathan: Of what?",
        "Josh: Edmund.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, no. That's not dream, dude. That's the real deal.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. This is not a very good time to talk to me, reva. Besides, I think I know what you're going to say.",
        "Reva: Right. Why did you hang up the phone when cassie called me?",
        "Edmund: Because you were making things very difficult for her.",
        "Reva: For her or for you?",
        "Edmund: Reva, did jonathan tell you about our latest encounter?",
        "Reva: Violence and intimidation come easy to you.",
        "Edmund: What are you talking about?",
        "Reva: You threatened my son.",
        "Edmund: Reva, I went to your son, hat in hand, and apologized for everything I had done to him. I offered to help him settle into this family, if that's what he wanted. And I gave him a family heirloom, something that belonged to my mother, his grandmother. Something very precious to me. And he threw it back in my face. Believe it reva, don't believe it, it really doesn't much matter.",
        "Reva: You expect me to take your word against my son's?",
        "Edmund: Think about it, reva, what I have done.",
        "Reva: That's exactly what i am doing right now, thinking about everything you've done.",
        "Cassie: Hey. My gosh, I'm so late. I wanted to come here and... are you okay?",
        "Ross: Yeah. You know a while ago you and a couple of other people told me to open my eyes where dinah's concerned. And what I saw was troubling.",
        "Cassie: Good.",
        "Ross: Dinah was never what I would have called happy. However, I think that she has many wonderful qualities. She always felt slighted somehow. She felt that her life wasn't enough.",
        "Cassie: That's not my problem, ross.",
        "Ross: Cassie, I know that. And I'm not using this as an excuse. But as a father I worry that one day it's all going to go too far and I'm going to lose her.",
        "Cassie: I don't want you to lose your daughter, but something has to be done.",
        "Ross: Oh, I agree with that. I do. And maybe now I can be the one to do it. And believe me, I'm going to try and keep her away from you and edmund, especially with what you're going through right now.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. I can't let anything stand in the way of our dreams.",
        "Lizzie: Why are you so surprised? I mean, didn't you expect it? I picked up the gun and I pulled the trigger. He was laying there and he fell down and died right in front of me.",
        "Alan: Hey, elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: It wasn't like in the movies or anything, it was just simple.",
        "Beth: Lizzie, stop.",
        "Lizzie: He was... he was just so surprised. He didn't think I'd do it. I didn't think I'd do it. He wasn't even bleeding. Why... why are you looking at me like that? You wanted me to confess to a murder, and I am. I am.",
        "Beth: Oh, my god.",
        "Lizzie: ( Sobbing )",
        "Alan: Don't worry. They will pay for this.",
        "Judge: Mr. Aitoro, do you have any more questions for this witness?",
        "Gus: Actually, I do, your honor.",
        "Judge: Ms. Spaulding, would you like to take a short recess?",
        "Gus: It'S... it's one more question.",
        "Judge: Go ahead.",
        "Gus: Lizzie, why did you pull the trigger? What did your father do to you?",
        "Lizzie: My father?",
        "Gus: Everybody knows that you loved him.",
        "Lizzie: I didn't love him. He wanted me to love him like a father. I couldn't do that. Not after everything. He thought I didn't know, but i saw everything. I saw it.",
        "Gus: You saw what? What did you see?",
        "Lizzie: He... he hit my mom...",
        "Beth: What?",
        "Lizzie: ...Hard. He hurt her all the time. He tried to act like he was just a nice person, but I hated him.",
        "Gus: You hated him?",
        "Lizzie: He was an awful man. That's why I shot him. I had to. I had to take care of my mom. I had to protect her. I would do it again. I would do it again if carl was to walk through those doors.",
        "Gus: Carl?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, carl. The guy that I killed, the guy who hurt my mom. Carl. Who do you think I'm talking about?",
        "Alan: Your honor, you cannot badger my granddaughter this way.",
        "Judge: Quiet, please! It seems that ms. Spaulding is talking about another case entirely.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know. If I could just... one moment.",
        "Judge: All right.",
        "Gus: Lizzie, you must be confused. We're not talking about carl stevens here.",
        "Judge: Ms. Spaulding, everything you've told us about the man who abused your mother, were you talking about your father, phillip spaulding?",
        "Lizzie: No, it's just... everyone was pushing me to confess for murder, and I did. I did kill carl stevens, and i just can't get over it.",
        "Judge: I'd like to excuse the witness, mr. Aitoro.",
        "Gus: Your honor, if I can. I just believe that the witness is confusing her past with her actions the night of her father's murder. And I am prepared to introduce evidence that will directly link her, directly link her to the crime. If I could just...",
        "Judge: Proceed, proceed.",
        "Gus: Thank you. Lizzie, isn't it true that you kept a piece of broken glass in your room with dried blood on it? Is that true or not?",
        "Jeffrey: Your honor, if i may. I have a report here from syntac laboratories in chicago. And it confirms that the dna on the shard of glass in question does not belong to phillip spaulding at all.",
        "Judge: Who does it belong to, mr. O'neil?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it belong to elizabeth spaulding's victim, carl stevens.",
        "Judge: Ms. Spaulding, would you care to explain?",
        "Lizzie: The piece of glass came from the spaulding potting shed the night that carl died. It's just a reminder that he's gone. I kept having these nightmares that he was coming back to get me. And I can look at that glass and know that he can't come back.",
        "Jeffrey: Your honor, elizabeth spaulding had obviously nothing to do with the death of her father. So may I suggest to the court that we get back to trying the real suspect here, harley cooper. Please.",
        "Jonathan: Am I the only one that remembers the things this guy has done?",
        "Josh: You know, jonathan, i don't really need you to remind me of edmund's crimes.",
        "Jonathan: Okay, people change, right? Everybody except me?",
        "Josh: Come in.",
        "Sandy: Need a signature, boss. Cadley's won't deliver that lumber unless the check is cleared.",
        "Jonathan: Well, speaking of the devil. Here's a fellow brother who is a reformed sinner. Can I get a hallelujah! Amen brother. Amen!",
        "Josh: Thank you, sandy.",
        "Sandy: Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, hey, where are you off to? You have plans at your place with tammy? Let me guess, a bowl of popcorn, a little reality tv. I get goose bumps just thinking about it.",
        "Sandy: Actually, tammy is moving into her own place. I guess she's not afraid of you anymore.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, well, maybe she just needs something you can't give her. Like a pulse.",
        "Josh: Sandy, did reva leave any message at the office at all?",
        "Sandy: Um, not that I know of.",
        "Josh: Okay, and you don't know where she went.",
        "Jonathan: No, I don't know. She did say one thing, though.",
        "Josh: What was that?",
        "Jonathan: She said that she has some important decision to make tonight. Later, dudes.",
        "Edmund: I'm telling you the truth about your son, reva.",
        "Reva: Which means jonathan is the liar.",
        "Edmund: Hard to believe. Yes, I know. But perhaps you should for cassie's sake.",
        "Reva: It's cassie I'm thinking about.",
        "Edmund: Reva, haven't i proven my devotion to your sister; my devotion to your children.",
        "Reva: You see it as devotion. I see it as desperation.",
        "Edmund: Desperation?",
        "Reva: You're hell bent on proving to cassie, proving to the entire world that you're not the same man you used to be. The man who would prey on innocent children, who would lash out on anyone that he found to be a rival. But I see you as the man who would rather see his entire world burn to the ground than let someone else have it.",
        "Edmund: Careful, reva. You don't know what you're dealing with. It is my job to protect cassie from any and all stress. And that is exactly what I'm going to do.",
        "Reva: Let go of me.",
        "Edmund: You're lighting a match. That's not a good thing to do, reva. Because if you start a fire, i can promise you cassie is not the one who is going to end up being burned. Coming up on \"guiding light...\"",
        "Harley: You're losing it, okay? You've lost your home, you've lost your money, your credit cards, your family. For what? For me? No, enough is enough.",
        "Edmund: But if you have something to say to me, say it.",
        "Reva: Okay, I will. But if you so much as touch my arm again, you'll be finishing that drink in jail. Or in an ambulance. oprah: Gwen stefani, enrique iglesias, and hilary duff.",
        "Judge: Court is dismissed.",
        "Beth: Oh. Oh, my poor baby. I'm so sorry.",
        "Lizzie: You actually think i would kill daddy?",
        "Beth: No, no. I would never think that. I know that you loved him with all your heart, just like I love you.",
        "Coop: Gus, you have to believe me. I never considered any other possibilities. I was sure that that piece of glass was...",
        "Harley: Don't be so hard on yourself.",
        "Gus: Listen, I'm going to prove to everybody in this courtroom, everybody in this town that you're innocent. Get out of my way.",
        "Alan: Well, did you enjoy sacrificing your own niece and torturing her. All you did, gus, was make things worse for yourself.",
        "Jeffrey: Leave him alone.",
        "Alan: Now, whose side are you on, mr. O'neil? And where were you when he was railroading little elizabeth up there, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: Just doing my job. Excuse me.",
        "Alan: Well, ross, you saw it with your own eyes. So when do we start the disbarment hearing, huh?",
        "Ross: Alan, phillip was my nephew, and I loved him. I want justice done more than anybody. But at what cost?",
        "Alan: At any cost.",
        "Ross: When you come to your senses we'll talk again.",
        "Alan: You want justice? Start with gus. This is the last time I want to see him in this courtroom, unless he's defending himself.",
        "Cassie: Harley, harley.",
        "Harley: Have you seen gus? No, I haven'T. I haven'T. I have to go and find him, but thank you so much for coming. I really appreciate this.",
        "Dinah: Are you okay?",
        "Cassie: No, I'm not okay. You saw what just went down in there.",
        "Dinah: Yes, I did. And things didn't go very well for harley. And I'm sorry for that. But it's something more than that, isn't it? You look really pale. Did something happen with edmund?",
        "Cassie: No, dinah. In fact, it's exactly the opposite. We couldn't be more hopeful. ( Knocking on door )",
        "Tammy: I'm not gone yet. But I promise I'll leave the key under the mat just like you wanted. What are you going to do without me to...",
        "Jonathan: Good to know.",
        "Tammy: What are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I heard that you were going to hit the road. So I wanted to know if you needed help moving your stuff.",
        "Tammy: Well, thanks for the offer. Good-bye. ( Door slams ) ( cell phone rings )",
        "Jonathan: Yeah?",
        "Dinah: Just ran into cassie. And she still thinks everything is wonderful. So why don't you tell me what explosives we have to buy to blow up this marriage.",
        "Jonathan: Well, we knew reva might not take the bait. You know what, give me a second. Let me try to cast my line again.",
        "Dinah: Cast your line again? What are you talking about? Jona... don't hang up. Jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, tammy, there's a fire in the hallway.",
        "Tammy: Oh, put it out and go away.",
        "Jonathan: Come on, tammy. It's important. Not just to me, but to you.",
        "Tammy: ( Sighs ) what do you want?",
        "Jonathan: I want our moms to make up and be sisters again.",
        "Tammy: ( Laughs ) and for your next lie...",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, it's the truth. And I need your help.",
        "Reva: Are you threatening me?",
        "Edmund: No, I think you're the one who's threatening me, all the talk about my world burning to the ground.",
        "Reva: What do you think that meant, edmund?",
        "Edmund: Reva, if you have something to say to me, say it.",
        "Reva: Okay, I will. But if you so much as touch my arm again you'll be finishing that drink in jail, or in an ambulance.",
        "Josh: Reva?",
        "Reva: Hey, hi.",
        "Josh: Everything okay here?",
        "Edmund: Of course it is. Reva and I were just having a toast.",
        "Reva: What were we toasting?",
        "Edmund: The future. A niece, nephew. Josh, why don't you buy your wife a drink.",
        "Josh: It's okay, you don't have to leave.",
        "Edmund: I have to leave. I have to get back to cassie, you see. Good to see you, reva. Good to see you, josh.",
        "Josh: Okay, what was that about?",
        "Reva: You remember when i told you about that dream I had?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Reva: The one about seeing edmund smothering baby jonathan.",
        "Josh: Yeah, in fact i mentioned it to jonathan.",
        "Reva: You told him?",
        "Josh: Yeah, he has a very strange reaction. He said it was real.",
        "Reva: Well, he's right. Edmund is dangerous and he's going after jonathan. And if I don't stop him soon, he will destroy cassie's life, too.",
        "Reva: Jonathan!",
        "Josh: It's true.",
        "Reva: You know what? What if he finds jonathan again. Edmund is so desperate to cup up his crime, that he's capable of doing anything.",
        "Josh: We don't know that a crime has been committed, reva.",
        "Reva: Cassie and rj were nearly killed in that fire.",
        "Josh: It might have been an accident. We don't know.",
        "Reva: No, because I saw edmund's reaction-- his desperation, his fear.",
        "Josh: Yeah, and jonathan saw yours, and he used it.",
        "Reva: I didn't want to believe it, either.",
        "Josh: Yes, you did.",
        "Reva: ( Sighs )",
        "Tammy: You've got two minutes.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Your mom's not talking to my mom, vise versa. My fault. But what am I going to do, hop on a plane to buenos aires. I mean, what good is that going to do? You think reva would forget about me? Come on, she'd follow me down to ( speaking in spanish accent ) tiera del fuego and fight the penguins to get my back. No? I'm the baby she gave up, and she doesn't want to lose me again.",
        "Tammy: So?",
        "Jonathan: So, it's my job to bring our moms back together.",
        "Tammy: Why do you care?",
        "Jonathan: I don'T. Not really. I'm tired of getting all the abuse from joshua and edmund. So I want to do something to get them off my back.",
        "Tammy: See now, that makes sense. When you're selfish I believe you.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, I like having three meals a day and a mom who thinks I hung the moon. If she's happy, then I'm happy, you know?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, right.",
        "Jonathan: All right, forget it.",
        "Tammy: Wait. What do you want me to do?",
        "Jonathan: Well, how about you meet me at olivia's bar in about half an hour. And this way you and I can talk, and you don't have to worry about being alone with me. Deal?",
        "Tammy: Jb? It's a nice thing you're doing, even if it is for selfish reasons.",
        "Jonathan: ( Whispers ) let's keep that between us, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Looking for that?",
        "Cassie: I know I left it here.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, sometimes, cassie, certain things come before friendship.",
        "Cassie: Well, I guess that's the difference between you and me. I put people first. You put the law first. Easy to hide behind.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, and what are you hiding behind, all that love you say you feel.",
        "Cassie: What do you mean what am I hiding...",
        "Edmund: There you are.",
        "Cassie: Hi, edmund. Hi.",
        "Edmund: I though you were going to take it easy today.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I just wanted to come by and give some support to harley, let her know that she had some friends left.",
        "Edmund: Good, good. The doctor said you need to slow down...",
        "Cassie: I know, avoid stress. I'm totally ready for tomorrow.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, so tomorrow is...",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, that's good. Good.",
        "Cassie: Edmund is just being overprotective.",
        "Jeffrey: Is he?",
        "Coop: I'm sorry, lizzie. I didn't know. I just saw that piece of glass and I thought that...",
        "Alan: Mr. Bradshaw, why don't you run along home while you still have a home. I hope you and your family have enjoyed squatting on spaulding property. Because when harley goes down-- and she will-- your family is going to go along with her. And you will all be out on the street, along with gus aitoro. Ladies. ( Sighs )",
        "Gus: We're closed.",
        "Harley: I know the owner.",
        "Gus: What are you doing here?",
        "Harley: What are you doing? You started smoking again?",
        "Gus: You should be sleeping and resting and getting your strength ready for the big court case...",
        "Harley: Have you eaten anything today at all?",
        "Gus: No, I'm fine.",
        "Harley: Put that out.",
        "Gus: I'm absolutely fine. See, here's the thing. I know that I made a big mistake, but I'm on to something now. I'm on to something and I can't really go right now...",
        "Harley: You look terrible. Gus:...And I'm not hungry...",
        "Harley: You're not shaving.",
        "Gus: ...I've been... I don't even need much sleep, either, because I've been, I'M...",
        "Harley: Stop, stop. Sit down for a second. Listen to me.",
        "Gus: I know what I'm doing.",
        "Harley: What, what, what? Look at what this is doing to you?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I'm just...",
        "Harley: Listen to me.",
        "Gus: ...If I have enough...",
        "Harley: You're losing it, okay? You've lost your home, you've lost your money, your credit cards, your family. For what? For me? No, enough is enough.",
        "Reva: I had my doubts about jonathan's story, especially when I found out it came from dinah. But then I ran into edmund, and he answered all my questions.",
        "Josh: So you confronted edmund about the fire in the barn.",
        "Reva: Indirectly.",
        "Josh: Indirectly how?",
        "Reva: I didn't have to say the words. I saw it in his eyes, the violence he kept under wraps.",
        "Josh: So what exactly did you see?",
        "Reva: I hinted. ( Laughs ) and, oh, he lost it. Edmund, the new man, the great father, the great husband. He's still the same horrible excuse for a human being that he always was. And he threatened me.",
        "Josh: How?",
        "Reva: He grabbed my wrists.",
        "Josh: How hard?",
        "Reva: Hard enough! It was a threat, joshua...",
        "Josh: You sure about that, reva?",
        "Reva: Oh, what, you're calling me a liar?",
        "Josh: No, I'm just saying that you're being manipulated, and you're too emotionally attached to be able to see that.",
        "Reva: So I'm such an emotional basket case and i don't have a mind of my own.",
        "Josh: Don't do that. Don't shut down on me, reva. I don'T... I don't care about jonathan's motives. I care about you and cassie, and what's going to happen if you keep letting jonathan do this to you.",
        "Reva: Do what? Need me? Did the thought ever cross your mind that I need him, too?",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's what scares me, reva. Because I think that maybe you need him more than you need me.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) oh, now who is being melodramatic?",
        "Josh: Reva... okay, wait... I think you did the right thing by not telling edmund.",
        "Reva: That doesn't mean i won't tell cassie.",

        "Edmund: Thank you. Cassie?",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry I was so hard on you earlier.",
        "Dinah: Councilor, if being noble is such a good thing, why do you feel like road kill?",
        "Edmund: Did o'neil say something to upset you?",
        "Cassie: No, why?",
        "Edmund: Well, you just seem a little off. Must be the procedure. You scared?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I'm scared, I'm excited, I'm hopeful. I'm everything. Look, I'm going to get my car and I'll meet you back at home.",

        "Edmund: Right. Riversville fertility clinic. Yes, my wife recently began a cycle of ivf, but I'm with the impression she needs a place.. someplace a little more private. Yes, exactly. Privacy and security are the things I'm most concerned about.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, how am I ever going to ask you out if you don't leave? Tammy? ( Sighs ) yeah, hi, it's your ex-roommate. And you left some stuff here. I would appreciate it if you would come and pick it up. Also, my roommate's gone and I'm throwing a party and you're invited, as long as you wear some of that lotion I mentioned earlier.",
        "Tammy: Anybody here? Jonathan? What is going on? ( Screams )",
        "Gus: Don't judge me. This is not... look, the bottom line is somebody killed phillip, and it wasn't you, and we both know that. And they're out there. He or she is out there. And he or she will eventually make a mistake. That's just the way it is. Now, all I have to do is reexamine all of the evidence and found possible motive with one of these people. And I will. Believe me, I will. It's just a matter of time, that's all...",

        "Gus: ...I couldn't find the lid.",
