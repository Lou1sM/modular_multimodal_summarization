        "Alan: Olivia, I would like for you to meet sebastian hulce.",
        "Olivia: You.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah, we met at a press conference. Olivia's a fantastic public speaker.",
        "Olivia: I had to say something, alan. You know, the investors were getting a little nervous.",
        "Sebastian: This girl spins likes a pro, alan. You should have heard all the things she said about you.",
        "Coop: Dad, where is the salad for table eight?",
        "Buzz: You just placed the order 30 seconds ago.",
        "Coop: Well, whose drinks are these?",
        "Buzz: Slow down, will you?",
        "Coop: Look, lizzie can't make it to work tonight, which means that we are going to be understaffed.",
        "Buzz: We're a restaurant. We're understaffed sometimes. Don't pull a hamstring trying to keep up.",
        "Coop: But people come to the restaurant to have dinner. What gives us the right to tell them to hurry up and then wait? How can we screw people's lives over like that?",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Coop: Forget it.",
        "Buzz: Hey, hold up. Wait. ( Laughs ) I don't know how people's lives can get messed up by a late order of french-fries, but I'm guessing this has to do with lizzie.",
        "Coop: It's my fault that she was torn apart on the stand in court today.",
        "Buzz: Don't do this to yourself.",
        "Coop: I can't help it, dad. I cannot help it. Lizzie is a spaulding, all right? But I've got a conscience, and she is suffering right now because of me.",
        "Lizzie: We've got too much stuff, baby. We've got too much stuff. We have to move on. We have to move on. The past is the past. You know what? We don't need all this stuff. I don't need it. I don't need it. ( Crying ) ( crying ) baby, you're the only friend i have. It's okay though, right? It's going to be okay.",
        "Tammy: ( Screams )",
        "Jonathan: You're early.",
        "Tammy: What are you... where is everyone? What is going on?",
        "Jonathan: Private party, ma'am. My aunt olivia let me buy the place out for a few hours.",
        "Tammy: So you could trap me? There are a ton of people out there in that hotel lobby. I will scream so loud...",
        "Jonathan: Relax. It's so we could get our mothers back together, like we talked about.",
        "Tammy: What do you want me to do?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I need you to get them here. They're not going to believe me, but they trust you.",
        "Tammy: Remind me why you're doing this.",
        "Jonathan: Because I'm tired of all the fighting, and I'm really tired of being blamed for it. Reva and cassie need each other, and you know, they know that. And I think we should give them a little shove towards happiness. What do you think?",
        "Tammy: It's worth a try. But even if we do get them here, there could be more trouble once they're face to face.",
        "Jonathan: We can only hope. ( Phone rings )",
        "Cassie: Hi, edmund. I'm fine. Stress-free. Yes, I am. And I will be home soon, and we'll have dinner in front of the fire, okay? Yes. I know. Everything is going to be perfect for the procedure tomorrow. You make me happy too. Yeah. Nothing's going to stand in the way of that.",
        "Reva: Cassie, it's me again. Where are you? I was at the farmhouse. I really need to see you.",
        "Cassie: I really need to see you too. What are we doing, reva? You had to tell me about the fire. And thank god you did. I was sitting around thinking, believing that edmund had changed. You saved me, reva. Thank you.",
        "Reva: I've got to find you. Now.",
        "Cassie: You couldn't help yourself, could you? Did it matter to you that I was happy-- happier than I've ever been in my entire life? Did you think for one second about anyone else beside yourself? Or did you really think I was going to cut edmund out of my life? What did you think you were going to accomplish by telling me about the fire, reva? Edmund's not the one I'm getting rid of. You are.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, why haven't you called? Voice mail again. Wow, I'm going to start thinking you don't like me so much. You're late for the party, tammy. I hope you have a great excuse.",
        "Tammy: Hey, mom, it's me. Are you busy right now?",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm picking up dinner for edmund and me. Why? You okay?",
        "Tammy: I'm fine. I just... I want you to save your appetite for dinner with me at olivia'S.",
        "Cassie: Oh, honey, that would be wonderful. But, well, you know, edmund and I are kind of...",
        "Tammy: It's short notice, i know, but I... I feel like I haven't been around enough. And you're going in for that egg thing tomorrow, right?",
        "Cassie: Yes, the egg thing is tomorrow.",
        "Tammy: And you have to fast after midnight, don't you? So I thought we could do dinner together. My treat.",
        "Cassie: That's sweet.",
        "Tammy: So you can come? You'll cancel with edmund?",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what? It's early, and I can do both, so I'll see you in a minute, okay?",
        "Tammy: See you soon.",
        "Jonathan: Nice work.",
        "Tammy: I'm only doing this because I know that my mom and aunt reva miss each other.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Now you've got to call reva. ( Phone rings )",
        "Tammy: Hello?",
        "Reva: Tammy, it's aunt reva.",
        "Tammy: Aunt reva? I was just about to call you.",
        "Reva: Is everything all right?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, with me. But you don't sound too happy.",
        "Reva: Honey, I really need to find your mother. And I was hoping that maybe...",
        "Tammy: You need a middleman. I am way ahead of you. Just come over to olivia's bar right now. Mom and I were going to have dinner, and you could just drop by.",
        "Reva: Perfect. I'll be right there.",
        "Tammy: Aunt reva was already looking for mom.",
        "Jonathan: Wow, I guess the stars are aligned. Maybe that little pep talk i gave reva before worked.",
        "Tammy: What did you say?",
        "Jonathan: A little bit of this and a little bit of that. But reva should be ready to let it all hang out.",
        "Buzz: So, you and lizzie.",
        "Coop: No. There is no me and lizzie.",
        "Buzz: It's obvious you care about the girl.",
        "Coop: Dad.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Coop: It's my fault, all right? I forced her to relive one of the worst memories in her life. All the time, she's sitting on the stand testifying at her father's own murder trial. I've got to do what I can to fix this.",
        "Buzz: Of course, you do.",
        "Jonathan: Mission accomplished. Now all we have to do is chill and wait for the big event. Sorry. I didn't mean to freak you out.",
        "Tammy: You didn'T.",
        "Jonathan: Sure. I just thought, with you moving out to your new place and the whole independent woman thing, i wouldn't matter so much to you.",
        "Tammy: You don'T. Sandy and I are serious.",
        "Jonathan: Of course you are. Serious is good. ( Phone rings ) yeah, it's me.",
        "Dinah: Hello, me. This is me.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, you missing me, me?",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) weak. You said you had something in the works.",
        "Jonathan: Take it easy. You're about to see me. Where are you?",
        "Dinah: Company.",
        "Jonathan: Well, order me something sweet. I'll be right there. I've moved on, too. A woman. Hot... with two ts. You know, I'm not even getting any sleep at night anymore. But tell sandy that I said hello. And you kids have a good time.",
        "Sebastian: Let me tell you, alan, this one spins like a pro. She left no doubt about who was running spaulding.",
        "Alan: Oh, I can only imagine.",
        "Sebastian: Yes, sir, alan. Olivia sang your praises at every turn.",
        "Olivia: I had no idea the two of you were connected.",
        "Alan: Oh, yes. Mr. Hulce is the gentleman who bailed me out of jail.",
        "Olivia: Is that right?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's lovely. It's nice to see you again. I can't thank you enough for restoring our noble king back to his throne.",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Olivia: What is it you do again?",
        "Sebastian: I'm not sure i said.",
        "Alan: Mr. Hulce is interested in becoming a major investor in spaulding, if we can convince him it's a good bet. Why don't you show him around?",
        "Sebastian: That is, if you have the time, mrs. Lewis. I mean, I know you're busy. But you would be the perfect, impeccable tour guide.",
        "Alan: Then I leave you alone.",
        "Olivia: All right, slick, cut the act.",
        "Sebastian: \"Slick\"?",
        "Olivia: You haven't been exactly honest with me.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, yes, and we know how much you value honesty, mrs. Lewis.",
        "Olivia: Well, now let's talk about honesty, mr. Hulce. Who knew that you and alan were so friendly?",
        "Sebastian: I hardly know the man. Besides, I'm not a name dropper.",
        "Olivia: What exactly are you?",
        "Sebastian: I'm a gemini, a nonsmoker, and I like to have fun.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, at my expense.",
        "Sebastian: I think you'd be thankful for the way I just covered your fine- looking behind...",
        "Olivia: There was nothing to cover.",
        "Sebastian: ...With alan.",
        "Olivia: I'm a loyal employee. Why don't you tell alan that when you run back to him?",
        "Sebastian: Chill, olivia, darling. I'm not a rat. I'm a friend. And who knows? Maybe you and I can help each other out.",
        "Olivia: I'm listening.",
        "Alan: Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Alan.",
        "Alan: I came to check on elizabeth-- you know, the innocent young girl that your family strung up in court.",
        "Buzz: She hasn't come in. She had a rough day, I hear.",
        "Alan: Yeah. This is just what you people wanted, wasn't it?",
        "Buzz: \"You people\"?",
        "Alan: You coopers have been trying to run her in the ground ever since she took over this dump.",
        "Buzz: Now wait a minute.",
        "Alan: Let me tell you something, buzz. I am going to make certain that you never have an opportunity of getting company back. It wasn't enough, what you did to phillip; now you're going after my granddaughter. I'm putting your clan on notice. This will not stand.",
        "Buzz: Nice talking to you, too. ( Dog barking )",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing? What?",
        "Coop: Well, right now, I'm freezing. But the big picture is, i just...",
        "Lizzie: Here.",
        "Coop: Whoa, lizzie! Ow! Lizzie, come on. They wouldn't even let me in the front door.",
        "Lizzie: Take a hint, coop.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I just want to talk to you.",
        "Lizzie: I'm done talking to you.",
        "Jonathan: I think that you'll be happy to know that I've worked it out so that reva and cassie are about to have some quality time together.",
        "Dinah: Now how did you get those two in the same orbit?",
        "Jonathan: Well, the more important question is, what's going to happen when my mother decides to tell cassie about what kind of man she just married? How good am I?",
        "Dinah: You're very good, but I want you to remember this is my life, and it's not a game.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. It's my life, too.",
        "Cassie: Wow. You planned all this? Such a nice surprise.",
        "Tammy: Well, it's more of a surprise than you think.",
        "Cassie: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I'm sorry. I lied to you to get you here with aunt reva, but you have to work things out. I know that things have been crazy, but you need each other.",
        "Cassie: This isn't a good time for me. I've got to go home.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry, cassie. But I can't let you go. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Lizzie: What if I am guilty?",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: I mean, yeah, that glass was not from where my father was murdered, but does that mean I'm automatically not the killer?",
        "Cassie: Edmund will do whatever is necessary to keep us all safe, reva. That's all.",
        "Reva: Edmund's really good at protection. Did you ever think that maybe it was edmund you needed protecting from? Oprah: The world's largest tumor, a medical mirac",
        "Sandy: Do you know the secret password?",
        "Tammy: I might not know the secret password, but I do have, like, 17 zillion messages on my voice mail, so somebody in there wants to see me.",
        "Sandy: Oh, really? Who?",
        "Tammy: I think I have the right apartment. There's supposed to be some wild party going on inside. So, let's see what all the hype is about.",
        "Sandy: I don't know, with that kind of attitude...",
        "Tammy: Let me in, crazy man.",
        "Sandy: All right, get in here.",
        "Tammy: Well. Looks like a pretty crappy party.",
        "Sandy: It was, until you got here.",
        "Cassie: Reva, let me go.",
        "Reva: I've been trying to reach you, cassie. I went out to the farm. I tried calling, but edmund hung up on me.",
        "Cassie: Edmund doesn't think I should be talking to you.",
        "Reva: Oh, what, so edmund runs your life now?",
        "Cassie: No. No, he doesn'T.",
        "Reva: I left messages on your cell phone.",
        "Cassie: I got them. I know.",
        "Reva: Well, then why didn't you call me...",
        "Cassie: Because this isn't a good time for me, okay? I have a lot going on right now.",
        "Reva: You're still trying to get pregnant.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I am, and the doctor says I need to avoid stress, and edmund thinks that you cause stress, so he's just being protective. That's all.",
        "Reva: Protective. Hm. Is that what he called it when he went after jonathan?",
        "Cassie: And you wonder why edmund thinks you bring stress.",
        "Reva: No. You know, I'm sorry, I wish i could let this go, but I can'T. You know, edmund's protecting you from jonathan; he's protecting you from me. Who else is he shutting out of your life, and how far is he going to go?",
        "Cassie: Edmund will do whatever is necessary to keep us all safe, reva. That's all.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Edmund's really good at protection. Did you ever think that maybe it was edmund you needed protecting from?",
        "Ross: Dinah. Hello. I'm glad... a little surprised to see you here.",
        "Dinah: Dad. Hi. I'm surprised to see you here, too. You look great. Do you know jonathan?",
        "Ross: Yeah, reva's son. Hello, jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Greetings, mr. Mayor.",
        "Ross: I didn't know that you were acquainted with my daughter.",
        "Dinah: He's not. He's not. Only in his deluded mind.",
        "Jonathan: I've got to hear this.",
        "Ross: Dinah, what's the problem?",
        "Dinah: Jonathan, I'm sorry. I wanted to deal with this just between us, but you won't listen.",
        "Ross: What is the problem?",
        "Dinah: Daddy, he's stalking me.",
        "Buzz: You look like you could use this.",
        "Alan: I didn't think you were allowed to serve alcohol out here.",
        "Buzz: I do a lot of things i shouldn't do.",
        "Alan: Me, too.",
        "Buzz: Alan...",
        "Alan: You know something, buzz? It wasn't that long ago that you and I went to hell and back.",
        "Buzz: They were memorable times.",
        "Alan: Yeah. We held up pretty good together, too, didn't we? No thanks to ed, josh, and billy. They were worthless. But we knew what was going on. I have to admit to you, I felt at that time a certain kinship with you.",
        "Buzz: I did, too.",
        "Alan: I was hoping because of that kinship that your family and my family could maybe have a second chance.",
        "Buzz: It hasn't worked out that way, has it?",
        "Alan: Oh, no, it hasn'T. I don't just blame you for what happened to phillip. I blame everyone in that courtroom. You all chipped away at him and pushed him right over the edge. He became bitter, filled with regrets and anger.",
        "Buzz: And none of those feelings have anything to do with you or your family? He did terrible things, alan. Terrible things.",
        "Alan: Yes, he did terrible things, because he was ill, buzz. But he is still my son.",
        "Buzz: If my daughter was the one that killed him, she'll still be my daughter.",
        "Alan: Well, then I guess we understand each other.",
        "Lizzie: Coop, are you still there?",
        "Coop: Yeah, lizzie, I am. Look, please, it's cold out here.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. All right, fine.",
        "Coop: Well, you're welcome. Where's all your stuff?",
        "Lizzie: I don't have anything for anyone to take.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, look, I came over here to apologize for what happened in court. I never, ever meant for you to get trashed that bad. I was just trying to protect my sister, harley.",
        "Lizzie: I understand.",
        "Coop: No, no, please. Look...",
        "Lizzie: You know what? If you hadn't taken that glass, everything would have been fine. You screwed up everything for everyone, coop.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, there was broken glass all over the place where your father was murdered. I come here and I find a hidden piece of broken glass here. What am I supposed to think? All right? You just came across as being so guilty.",
        "Lizzie: Well, what if I am guilty?",
        "Coop: What?",
        "Lizzie: I mean, yeah, that glass was not from where my father was murdered, but does that mean I'm automatically not the killer?",
        "Lizzie: You said it yourself, coop. I'm not that different from my dad. Look what he did. Maybe what happened in court, maybe it went just the way i wanted.",
        "Coop: No, you were not faking that.",
        "Lizzie: And how do you know that? Maybe I just forced tears. Maybe I made myself seem upset. Maybe I brought back memories from carl's murder. You know what? Everybody felt bad for me. Isn't that why you're here?",
        "Coop: No.",
        "Lizzie: Then why are you here?",
        "Coop: I don't feel bad for you, lizzie. I'm here because I believe in you.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, you really believe in me? You're just like everyone else. You think I'm a pain and I'm some baby. Now I may even be a killer. Who knows?",
        "Coop: Lizzie, you did not kill your father, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Coop, you stole that glass out of my room because you wanted me to be guilty. God, you had to be so disappointed when you found out you were wrong.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I have never wanted to be so wrong in my entire life. That's the truth. ( Laughter ) ( laughter )",
        "Olivia: So, did you enjoy it? Did you enjoy the tour?",
        "Sebastian: I like the way people part like the red sea when you walk by.",
        "Olivia: Oh. I worked hard on that.",
        "Sebastian: Hm. ( Laughter )",
        "Olivia: Really, what did you think?",
        "Sebastian: Well, I think if I'm going to dump a bucket of money into spaulding, I'm going to need someone to watch over my interests.",
        "Olivia: And is that what you meant when you said that we could help each other out?",
        "Sebastian: Why not? I'll do the giving, and you do the taking.",
        "Olivia: I'm an excellent taker.",
        "Sebastian: I have noticed.",
        "Olivia: I can take care of you and all your money.",
        "Sebastian: Great. Now, how about I take care of you? Have dinner with me tonight.",
        "Olivia: Oh.",
        "Sebastian: Unless, of course, you know, you have other commitments. I don't want to make your life complicated.",
        "Olivia: Well...",
        "Sebastian: And besides, i don't know, maybe there's someone else in the company i could dine with.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, that's wonderful, that reverse psychology. It's very nice.",
        "Sebastian: Is it working?",
        "Olivia: Oh, I'm all yours.",
        "Sebastian: Good. I'll meet you outside, olivia.",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Tammy: It's a nice place you got here.",
        "Sandy: I like it. It's much quieter now that my roommate's gone.",
        "Tammy: What was he like?",
        "Sandy: She.",
        "Tammy: She?",
        "Sandy: She had some very serious snoring issues.",
        "Tammy: And you never told her?",
        "Sandy: She wouldn't have heard me anyway. Besides, I had to choose my battles wisely.",
        "Tammy: Why? Was there more?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. She was the kind of girl who would actually use the shower curtain rod to dry stuff off on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And, she... she never made her bed or picked up the sweats or even washed her cereal bowls in the morning.",
        "Tammy: Just left it in the sink?",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Disgusting, huh? Oh, oh, and she never rolled the toothpaste up from the bottom.",
        "Tammy: Sounds like a horror.",
        "Sandy: Hm. Yeah. I miss her already.",
        "Tammy: Well, you should have her back for dinner some time. Yeah. I miss her already.",
        "Tammy: Well, you should have her back for dinner some time.",
        "Sandy: Nah. Did I mention she was always late for stuff like that?",
        "Jonathan: You're not being serious, are you?",
        "Ross: Are you calling my daughter a liar?",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) okay, sir-- and I say this with all due respect-- but are you out of your freaking mind? Or more importantly, I guess i should ask you that question. But then again, we all know the answer to that, don't we?",
        "Dinah: Very funny.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Does it look like I'm stalking her? So I've called a few dozen times a day. I mean, maybe that's a little excessive, but... so, maybe that time I drove by your house and I shouted \"I love you and I can't be held responsible for the repercussions,\" that might have been a little intense, but would you call that stalking?",
        "Dinah: Daddy, see? He's the freak everybody says he is. Your mother would be proud.",
        "Jonathan: Yes, yes. She loves me. Everybody loves me. And you will, too, dinah. You will, too.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs )",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs )",
        "Ross: Oh, for heaven's sake, I don't have time for this. Let's go. I don't want you hanging around your \"stalker\" any more than necessary.",
        "Dinah: ( Laughs ) okay, wait. I've got to take care of the bill.",
        "Ross: All right, do that. I'll meet you outside.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I'm sorry. That was bad. That was bad and I apologize.",
        "Ross: It's okay.",
        "Dinah: It is?",
        "Ross: It's okay if you tell me the truth about what are you doing with jonathan randall?",
        "Dinah: Daddy, look, we are spending time together. That's all.",
        "Ross: Thank you. You see? Is honesty all that hard?",
        "Dinah: Look, I want you to know that he came to me, all right? He's not fitting into reva's family very well, and he needed someone to talk to, one black sheep to another. And I'm being a reluctant mentor, but I couldn't turn him away.",
        "Ross: I understand. Be careful.",
        "Dinah: Okay. I will. Thank you. I'll be out in a minute.",
        "Buzz: I don't like the look of that.",
        "Ross: Tell me about it.",
        "Buzz: What's going on?",
        "Ross: Buzz, I'm trying to save my daughter, but it's a losing battle.",
        "Buzz: Tell me about it.",
        "Jonathan: That's nice.",
        "Dinah: Well, you could have more of that at the beacon hotel in a king-size bed. But I want you to come through with this fired news business, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, that's already happening right now, babe. Reva's about to tell cassie all the news she never wanted to hear.",
        "Cassie: Jonathan has your brain so warped, you don't know which way is up.",
        "Reva: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: No. You know what? Edmund is a great father. He is a great husband. You can't forgive him for the man he used to be, and you're hanging on to a child that only exists in your imagination, reva.",
        "Reva: That's not fair.",
        "Cassie: No? You want to believe in jonathan so badly. You so want to be forgiven for abandoning him as a child that you're willing to believe anything, reva. You want to see that monster as the adorable little blonde boy that you left in san cristobel.",
        "Reva: A little boy that I had to give up because of edmund. Because of edmund. You think he's going to get a pass on that, ever?",
        "Cassie: Well, clearly he's not. I just thought you loved me enough, but...",
        "Reva: I do love you.",
        "Cassie: Never mind.",
        "Reva: I do love you, and that's why I'm here. I'm here because you don't see the danger living under your own roof, and I have to make you see it. I have to.",
        "Cassie: I'm sick of what you want, okay? Live your life; love your son; i don't care. Leave us alone. Please.",
        "Reva: Cassie. I'm sorry, but there's something I have to tell you.",
        "Tammy: You know, I couldn't help noticing that your party isn't so much a party as it's a date.",
        "Sandy: \"Date\" is such a loaded word. I prefer to think that the other guests are jerks who never showed up. The good news is, no rave types to kick out. I ditched my pesky roommate. I can invite you to stay over.",
        "Tammy: A sleep-over?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tammy: Sorry. I'm not that kind of a girl.",
        "Sandy: I remember when you used to beat yourself up for weeks because you thought you were exactly that type of girl.",
        "Tammy: Well, a really good friend kept talking me down off that ledge. I don't know what I would have done without him.",
        "Sandy: Accept an invitation to stay over, and I'll take the sofa.",
        "Tammy: You know, you throw a crappy party, but I'm still crazy about you. Good night.",
        "Sandy: Good night.",
        "Lizzie: You believed in me?",
        "Coop: Yeah, I did. I still do. Lizzie, part of me just... i always have.",
        "Lizzie: It's too bad I don't believe in you anymore. I'm sorry. It's better if you leave.",
        "Coop: Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Lizzie, wait a second. I'm confused, here. I thought we just had...",
        "Lizzie: It's not that easy, coop! You don't just bring me flowers and a shoulder to cry on and expect I'm going to forget everything you did. It's not going to happen!",
        "Coop: Lizzie, wait a second. All right, now you're clearing out your room. Now, someone who would see this would think that you're losing it right now. I don't want to leave you, not like this.",
        "Lizzie: Well, don't worry. I have people coming over. I'll be fine. I have my friends over.",
        "Coop: No, okay, fine, that's great. Maybe I can stay. Maybe I can...",
        "Lizzie: Go! Leave! ( Sobbing )",
        "Olivia: You get me everything you can on the guy. Last known residence, financial statements, birth marks, I don't care. Everything. Do it. Sebastian hulce, you have no idea who you're dealing with.",
        "Alan: You know, after all this time, olivia still doesn't understand who she's dealing with. She's under the illusion that this job is permanent. I'm simply waiting for the right person, that's all.",
        "Sebastian: How's the hunt going?",
        "Alan: Very well. I'm very close to getting the perfect person. Listen, why don't you get to know olivia better?",
        "Sebastian: Already on it, alan old boy.",
        "Alan: Why am I not surprised?",
        "Jonathan: Your old man just gave me the evil eye.",
        "Dinah: That's because you're corrupting his daughter. What did you expect?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Well, now at least I see where you get it from.",
        "Dinah: I want to tell you something. I want you to listen to me. The only reason my father gave you that look was because he sensed you were morally bankrupt. He's right. I don't want to ever hear you say that again. He is a decent man, and he's the only person on earth who gives a damn about me. You mess with him in any single way, they'll never find your body. Okay?",
        "Ross: Yeah, it's me. It's about dinah. I wish it hadn't come to this, but it has, so I'm going to go through with it. But I need your help.",
        "Jonathan: My place or yours?",
        "Dinah: I think that you have a situation to monitor.",
        "Jonathan: Reva's going to crash and burn and take cassie with her. The only thing we have to do is celebrate getting exactly what we want.",
        "Cassie: Reva, please let me be happily married and let me try to have another baby.",
        "Reva: I want to, but my concerns are real.",
        "Cassie: You know what's real to me right now? Tomorrow, I go to a fertility clinic at cedars. I'm going to try and have a baby with edmund any way I can. That's what's real to me. I have a wonderful life. I have love. I have happiness. I have joy. I have laughter. I have work. I have everything... except for my sister. That's killing me. Please, will you please come with me tomorrow, and will you be with me, by my side, for the procedure? Do you think you could do that?",
        "Reva: You want me to be there?",
        "Cassie: Reva, I need you. Don't you know that? I've always needed you.",
        "Reva: I'll come. I'd be honored to be at your side. Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Olivia: Why? Why did you have to drag me into this? Alan was already circling for blood.",
        "Bill: Will you stop on alan? We're talking about harley's freedom. That's a lot more important than your place over at spaulding.",
        "Harley: Please, can we just pretend for one minute that you are not trying to save my life and throwing away yours?"
