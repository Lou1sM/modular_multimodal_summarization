        "Dinah: Beautiful flowers.",
        "Alan-Michael: I know, aren't they gorgeous?",
        "Dinah: Wow, they are. I didn't think Mallet had it in him.",
        "Alan-Michael: He didn't. Those are my way of saying we're in it together, baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Doughnuts, coffee, late night surveillance. I mean, I'm almost feeling like my old self again, here.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) Uh-huh.",
        "Harley: What, do I have something on my face?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, you've got frosting all over your mouth. No, you don't. So let me get this straight: You could be sitting in a big plush chair right now, moving and shaking with hot-shots of the world, but you'd rather be rousting drug dealers?",
        "Harley: Even hot-shots put on their pants one leg at a time. They just have somebody else hold them up for them, and I don't need that.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh, you don't need any help; you can put on your own pants.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. I love police work. It's exciting, it's in my blood. It makes me feel alive and it's what Gus would want me to do. He'd want me to follow my true calling.",
        "Mallet: Your true calling.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh.",
        "Mallet: Right, yeah. I think we both know the real reason that you're standing here right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: I need another pill.",
        "Alan: No, no, you just had one. Gus. Gus? Beth... Beth, Gus is out. Open the door, we've got to talk.",
        "Beth: I'm sorry, did that lock? I forgot that it does that when I close the door. Weird, huh? I wonder who used to live here.",
        "Alan: It's a good question, Beth.",
        "Beth: So, alone at last.",
        "Alan: Yes, alone at last. Isn't it romantic?",
        "Bet: Almost like the honeymoon we never had.",
        "Alan: Well, we couldn't have because I was in--",
        "Beth: You were... locked up and muzzled like a pitbull. How's the arm?",
        "Alan: Much better. But Gus is not recovering as quickly as I would like. It's a good thing that you chose a house that had so much food and medical supplies.",
        "Beth: Fortune favors the brave, right?",
        "Alan: Yes, Beth, and you are brave as well-- smart, too. You know that story about you rescuing us in the snow, well, that's absolutely--",
        "Beth: Heroic?",
        "Alan: Yes, heroic. Except for one thing? I found this receipt with supplies, food and medicine, dated yesterday. So this means that you can come and go as you please, but Gus and I can't. Does that make us your prisoners?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You think you know me so well.",
        "Mallet: Well, I think there's a reason you asked Frank for your badge back and I think it's the same reason you asked to be partnered up with me.",
        "Harley: I asked to be partnered up with you because it's easy and familiar.",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh, right. Don't touch the chocolate one, it's mine.",
        "Harley: Wait a second. We talked about this. I told you, I was okay with this-- I mean, you don't think... you don't think I'm doing this because I want you?",
        "Mallet: No. I think it's because you want to pick up where the FBI left off and find your husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) Who knew? I actually pulled it off.",
        "Billy: I told you, you could. I had faith.",
        "Reva: You weren't the one under the spotlight.",
        "Billy: Actually, I felt like I was.",
        "Reva: Oh, God, Billy, you know what? I have been lost for so long, but getting up there and talking about destiny, I just realized that I've believed in it all along. Thanks to you. You showed me the way, and now I know I'm destined to be with Joshua. I love him, Billy. I do, and I am going to get him back.",
        "Billy: Well, Reva, as long as we're being honest here, there's something I've got to tell you. The other day, the kiss, it meant a little more to me than I said. As a matter of fact, all of this has meant more to me than I said. Talk about a destiny, I think you should look at what's right in front of you-- right in front of us.",
        "Reva: Oh, my god, Billy. Are you drinking again?",
        "Billy: ( Yells out )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: These are absolutely beautiful. I love tulips. Can I get you a cup of coffee? Two creams, one sugar.",
        "Alan-Michael: No sugar.",
        "Dinah: Okay, coming up.",
        "Alan-Michael: Wait, you sit; that's my job. ( Laughing ) I love it.",
        "Dinah: What do you love?",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, that we're so much alike. I was just remembering my first day at Spaulding; I couldn't even find the executive men's room. I should have known then that I wasn't cut out for the, uh... ( with Caribbean accent ) ...Corporate rat race.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well I'm glad I won't be looking for the executive men's room. I never said I wasn't cut out for it. Sign this please. Perfect.",
        "Alan-Michael: Neither did I. I'm glad you're going to be here until Harley gets back. Teaming us up was the best decision she ever made. I mean, I've got the name and the knowledge and you...",
        "Dinah: I have the killer instinct, so to speak.",
        "Alan-Michael: Is there something wrong? You look uncomfortable.",
        "Dinah: No, not uncomfortable at all. I can't help but think that um... you know, you had this job all by yourself. You must have been a little disappointed when Harley put me in the mix.",
        "Alan-Michael: Are you kidding? It was a blessing. It was a huge relief. I went out, I celebrated. No. It's lonely at the top. I guess misery loves company.",
        "Dinah: Well, good. I just hope you mean it.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, thank you.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're welcome. Here' the coffee. Here's the memo you asked for, Ms. Marler.",
        "Dinah: Thank you, Alan-Michael.",
        "Alan-Michael: I do mean it. We're in this together. Let's make Harley proud.",
        "Dinah: I like her.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah. It's nice, huh? It's corporate magic, or what's known in the inner circle as power. It suits you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: What is this, group therapy? We're supposed to be working a case, not discussing my ulterior motives.",
        "Mallet: Your ulterior motives is exactly what's going to keep you from focusing in on this case because you're focused on finding Gus.",
        "Harley: That was the only point I'm trying to make-- my focus is here. It's right here and right now. Let's go get some bad guys. Are you coming? Come on, let's go.",
        "Mallet: Oh, boy, this is what I'm talking about. This is what I'm talking about. This is what I mean. You haven't even asked about the plan. Why? Because your focus is split. On who or what? On Gus. You didn't ask any pertinent questions about the case. You want to run off like Batman without Robin, something like that, I don't know.",
        "Harley: Are you Robin in this scenario?",
        "Mallet: I'm never Robin; I'm always Batman. My point is, I want a partner who's 100% committed, okay? A partner like Gus, but I don't have Gus anymore. So I have to move on. And I sometimes get the feeling maybe you haven't completely moved on.",
        "Harley: I've moved on.",
        "Mallet: Not really, I don't think so. I don't really feel that. I just think maybe you haven't let go.",
        "Harley: Mallet...",
        "Mallet: Hmm?",
        "Harley: Why didn't they find a body?",
        "Mallet: They will find something.",
        "Harley: I realize that it is completely irrational to believe that Gus and Alan survived, but I believe that when someone you love dies, you feel it. Right here. And I don't. And, my son swears that Gus called him, that he talked to him on the telephone, that Gus called him from heaven, he swears.",
        "Mallet: Would that be unlimited roaming? I'm sorry. What do you... what do you want me to say, that Gus phoned home?",
        "Harley: I don't care what you believe. It doesn't matter to me. You're not my psychiatrist, you're not my priest; you're my partner. Okay, so let's talk shop. As a matter of fact, let's not talk at all. Okay? We can learn sign language-- that way we can communicate without talking. Don't you think that'll work?",
        "Mallet: ( Laughing )",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: You know who you remind me of right now?",
        "Harley: No, Mallet, who do I remind you of right now?",
        "Mallet: Gus.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: ( Laughing ) You think I'm holding you captive? Now, that is funny.",
        "Alan: Why did you lock the door?",
        "Beth: I told you. It wasn't on purpose this time.",
        "Alan: What about the other times, Beth?",
        "Beth: Alan, I did it so Gus wouldn't go walking out in the cold and freeze to death. You've both been delirious since I brought you here. I did it for your own protection. I saved your life, I nursed you back to health, and still you don't trust me?",
        "Alan: Why did you lie to me about being snowed in?",
        "Beth: I didn't. The sun came out yesterday. I went to town for supplies.",
        "Alan: Why didn't you tell Gus and me? I mean, did you run into anyone when you were in town?",
        "Beth: Oh, questions, questions. Alan, am I holding a gun in my hand? Am I holding it to your head?",
        "Alan: Do you have a gun, Beth?",
        "Beth: You're just being silly.",
        "Alan: We have been here for quite a while. Now, does anyone know that we're here?",
        "Beth: I do.",
        "Alan: What about the rest of the people in Springfield. That's where you went, isn't it? Or do they all think that we're dead?",
        "Beth: Alan, since when did you care what anyone thought?",
        "Alan: The truth, Beth! Why did you bring Gus and me here, and what do you hope to accomplish?",
        "Beth: Oh, for pete's sakes, Alan, wake up! I'm doing this to help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Ooh. Hey. Ah, that truck came from out of nowhere, huh? Oh, my... Reva. You're not going to let me drive your car-- oh, wow, are you okay? Hey. Reva. Hey. I'm stuck. Wait a second, I'll get-- oh. Hey, Reva. Reva? Reva. Hey. Jeez, come on! ( Grunts ) I'm a little stuck right now. Reva, you okay? I'm sorry about this. ( Grunts )",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: These people have to be kidding. We have to cancel this contract. This is face cream; it's not cancer research.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, they're asking us to fund them for another six months until they can get...",
        "Dinah: Fund them for another six months? Are you kidding? No way. We've already extended them. Besides, let me tell you something. Any jar of anything is not going to make a woman look 20 years younger. You know what that's got to be filled with? Solid gold and a winning lottery ticket, possibly.",
        "Alan-Michael: You're good with this. Harley would have been going back and forth between burning bridges and hurting feelings.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, well, you know what? It is my job to protect the bottom line, correct?",
        "Nell: Ms. Marler and Mr. Spaulding, the 7:30 budget meeting's about to start.",
        "Alan-Michael: You take it. Just be tough on Howard. Just remember, Harley was adamant about cutting fat, not muscles. Muscle.",
        "Dinah: Remind me, are testicles muscles?",
        "Alan-Michael: In certain cases, yes, but it takes a healthy diet, plenty of exercise.",
        "Dinah: Good, thank you for that clarification.",
        "Alan-Michael: Knock them dead, sweetheart. I know you can do it.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I know I can do it, too. But do me a favor: Lose the \"sweetheart.\"",
        "Alan-Michael: Have fun, Dinah. Hi, Aunt Alex.",
        "Alexandra: Hello, dear. What's going on with Dinah? She dashed out of here, grabbed a huge pair of scissors like she was going to snip off somebody's... what, budget?",
        "Alan-Michael: She's just fooling around. I let her take the cost-cutting meeting with our digitally challenged, oh, so boring CFO.",
        "Alexandra: Do you think that was a good idea?",
        "Alan-Michael: Relax. Dinah has really taken to the job. And you know what they say? Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.",
        "Alexandra: And you're fine with that?",
        "Alan-Michael: Absolutely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Here you go.",
        "Harley: So tell me something. Did you like being partnered with Gus?",
        "Mallet: Sure. He's pigheaded, impulsive, reckless, a lot like you.",
        "Harley: You're doing it, too.",
        "Mallet: What am I doing?",
        "Harley: Talking about him in the present tense. I guess I'm not the only one who's holding out hope. Is that a tear?",
        "Mallet: I don't hold out hope for things that can't happen. See, I'm a realist, a pragmatist. I get up in the morning, I go to work and I try to deal with the hand I've been given. Even sometimes when you don't like the hand that you've been given.",
        "Harley: Because you're Batman?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I'm always Batman. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Harley: Hey, we've had all cases where it looked like the evidence was pointing in one direction-- don't answer that-- and it turned out to be something completely different. Don't answer that yet. Isn't it possible that this is one of those cases? Yeah, you can answer it.",
        "Mallet: Mallet, thanks for holding. How can I help you?",
        "Harley: ( Laughing )",
        "Mallet: Yeah, sure. Okay, we're on our way. That was surveillance; they spotted our dealers entering Outskirts.",
        "Harley: Let's rock and roll.",
        "Mallet: Now, listen. I need to know you can handle this. I need to know you're not going to walk into the bar and look over your shoulder and see some guy that may or may not remind you of Gus.",
        "Harley: Mallet, I'm all yours.",
        "Mallet: Great. Unbutton your blouse.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) What? Why?",
        "Mallet: So I can take photos and post them on the internet. So I can attach a wire.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Okay. Wait. What's wrong with your chest? Why am I getting wired?",
        "Mallet: Because you've got... you got camouflage, you know, natural camouflage.",
        "Harley: I don't have that much natural camouflage. I think your chest will be fine.",
        "Mallet: No, but they're good-- I mean, they're nice. They're fine for a wire, okay, so open your blouse.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Mallet: Harley.",
        "Harley: Okay, wire me up. But next time, you wear the bra.",
        "Mallet: Okay. Um... it needs to go lower.",
        "Harley: You never asked for permission in the past.",
        "Mallet: I'm trying to be a gentleman here.",
        "Harley: Is that what you're doing?",
        "Mallet: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Oh, my gosh, this is not a date, just do what you need to do.",
        "Mallet: Okay. You don't have to wince. You didn't used to wince. You used to be gleeful.",
        "Harley: Okay. Just do it.",
        "Mallet: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Am I still your wife? Am I still your wife and partner?",
        "Alan: Of course you are, Beth.",
        "Beth: We're a team. We're committed, right?",
        "Alan: Yes, we're committed. You're my other half.",
        "Beth: Yes, and as your other half, I saw this coming. I knew that Gus was after you. So I took steps.",
        "Alan: You took steps?",
        "Beth: I planted a tracking device on you in the courthouse. And that's what led me to the car, and that's how I found you.",
        "Alan: Why didn't you tell me this before?",
        "Beth: What, Alan, was I supposed to say something in front of Gus? He's the enemy! Okay, okay. I did also... I wanted to be sure we were committed to the same ideals, the reason we got married in the first place. I did this for you, Alan, for you.",
        "Alan: Yes. This is what I've always wanted, Beth.",
        "Gus: Beth, we were never trapped here?",
        "Beth: That doesn't matter, Gus. What does matter is you need to get back in bed.",
        "Gus: Does my wife know where I am?",
        "Beth: Oh, forget about your wife. Your wife is fine.",
        "Gus: Does my wife know where I am or not!?",
        "Beth: Calm down! Alan, is your arm strong enough to help Gus get back into bed?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Beth: Then do that.",
        "Gus: Okay, okay. I just want to know if my wife knows where I am or not.",
        "Beth: Your wife thinks you're dead, Gus. Alan, we can't have Gus wandering around all by himself. Gus, honey, you need to get your rest. Tie him up!",
        "Alan: What?",
        "Beth: Tie him up!",
        "Gus: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: I don't care about me, but you've got to help Reva, okay? Please. Hey, hey, hey! Over here. ( Coughing ) hey, help, help, help!",
        "Josh: Billy. Are you okay?",
        "Billy: Come on over here. Reva's been passed out since we crashed.",
        "Josh: Reva! The door won't open. Reva! Reva!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael Dempsey, \"Inside The Light.\" My father was always supportive of whatever I did. Alan-Michael didn't get to experience that, so... is Alan-Michael the guy for Marina? That is yet to be seen. My wife and I have known each other since we were six years old and we've been together for nine years. See Alan-Michael Wednesday, March 1, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: How do I look?",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs ) You look like your father.",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, it won't be long before I'm smoking his cigars. In fact, you got a light?",
        "Alexandra: Aren't you getting a little bit overconfident these days, dear?",
        "Alan-Michael: I'm being realistic, Aunt Alex. Harley's never coming back, not as CEO. And Dinah, while I think she'll enjoy the power more than Harley did, I'm pretty damn sure that she'll blow herself up in no time. And then...",
        "Alexandra: Then what? You will rush in, you'll pick up the pieces, clean up the mess and take your rightful position in the big chair.",
        "Alan-Michael: I do deserve it. I can do this job.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I know you can do it. And I know how frustrated you've been all these years.",
        "Alan-Michael: Then you'll support me?",
        "Alexandra: What do you think, dear? ( Laughs ) You're a Spaulding. I just don't think it's going to be quite as easy as you imagine because Dinah is not going to, you know, run away from Harley. She's not going to betray her. I mean, they've become better than friends, you know, more than that. Harley gave Dinah back her life, redeemed her.",
        "Alan-Michael: Redemption's a great thing, but temptation trumps it every time. Not to mention how complicated and incestuous this whole Mallet thing is. When push comes to shove, Dinah will sell out Harley. I'll bet my trust fund on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: I feel like I'm forgetting something.",
        "Alan-Michael: Um... lover boy.",
        "Dinah: I beg your pardon.",
        "Alan-Michael: Sorry. That's my shorthand. You said remind you to call your...",
        "Dinah: Mallet. Call Mallet.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. That's good, though. I like your name. It's funnier, it's cuter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Hello. Am I wired yet?",
        "Mallet: Almost. Now, listen, you've got to be careful with these people, okay? They're not your typical drug dealer. They're Mr. And Mrs. Joe Suburban.",
        "Harley: So PTA by day, PCP by night. ( Laughs ) That was a little funny.",
        "Mallet: It was kind of good, yeah. Now, listen, they would be at home at any kind of family soccer game. They deal at restaurants, they deal at health spas. Nobody asks them any questions. They blend right in-- which means they're smart, which means that they're also unpredictable.",
        "Harley: Uh-huh. \"Unpredictable,\" that's a big word.",
        "Mallet: I want you to concentrate on that word, okay?",
        "Harley: So I think what you're telling me is that if we do this right, they'll roll over on their suppliers.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Yeah. I want you to be on your toes, okay? It's Kara and Dan Ludlow. They may act like the Coopers, they may talk like the Coopers...",
        "Harley: See, I don't get it. Why would seemingly normal people do something that gets... I don't know, cheap thrills.",
        "Mallet: Because, um... um... sometimes people are never satisfied.",
        "Harley: Hmm. ( Cell phone rings ) Don't stop what you're doing. I'll get that. Mallet and Cooper.",
        "Dinah: You sound like a law firm.",
        "Harley: Oh, hi, Dinah. Good to hear your voice.",
        "Dinah: Yours, too. Is Mallet around?",
        "Harley: He's around, but he's... definitely around, but he's kind of busy right now. How's your first day as a big executive?",
        "Dinah: I'm just filling in until you get back.",
        "Harley: Alan-Michael behaving?",
        "Dinah: He is doing okay. Surprisingly things are all right around here. How's your first day going?",
        "Harley: Not so bad either.",
        "Dinah: Is Mallet behaving himself?",
        "Harley: Well, I'll let you know in an hour.",

        "Gus: Untie me. Are you crazy? Untie me!",

        "Alan: Break the law? Oh, wow, that sounds funny coming from you, who kidnapped me and got us into all this mess.",
        "Beth: Is he secure, Alan?",
        "Gus: You want Harley to think I'm dead. That's why you're doing this, right? That's sick. You're sick...",
        "Alan: Don't talk to my wife that way. She's not only beautiful; she's very smart.",
        "Beth: Thank you, Alan.",
        "Alan: Now, we have to think about our next move, Beth, my triumphant return to Springfield. I can just see it now: \"Billionaire rises from the grave.\" You can't buy publicity like that, and we're going to milk it for everything it's worth. We have to make sure that our stories track, so we need to sit down and talk...",

My wife has been seriously hurt. She's not responding. She might even... just send the paramedics as soon as you can, please. Thank you. Billy, I called the highway patrol, okay? They're on their way.",
        "Billy: Good. She hasn't moved since once we were hit.",
        "Josh: Does she have a pulse?",
        "Billy: I got her arm here. I'm trying to find it, and I'm not feeling nothing.",
        "Josh: Just concentrate. Just try to concentrate!",
        "Billy: I got it, I got it, I got it. Oh, yeah, I can barely feel it. It's there. You've got to do something to get us out of here. ( Yells out in pain )",

        "Mallet: I'm trying to keep your boss alive, Dinah.",
        "Harley: He just thinks he's a better cop than I am. He always has. I'm sure Alan-Michael is giving you similar grief.",

        "Alexandra: You are beginning to sound like your father, and you know what happened to him. ( Laughs ) Just a thought, darling, but a very non-Spaulding thought. But why not be direct, why not go straight to the board, you know, defuse them with some of the facts about...",
        "Alan-Michael: Harley's got the ex-wives club in the palm of her hand. But soon I'll have Dinah in mine. Her appetite for power will grow and grow, and then she'll wonder, \"Why am I second banana to Harley?\"",
        "Alexandra: Listen, darling. I think you're playing with fire here. And playing fire with Dinah Marler is even more unpredictable than playing with real fire.",

        "Gus: Well it's obvious that she's all whacked up on pet balls.",
        "Beth: Shut up. In your miserable lives, would you think about someone besides yourselves? Do you have any idea what it took for me to get you here? I had to track you in a blizzard, I had to find you after you had stumbled away from the car, and I had to drag your sorry carcasses all the way back to this cabin. But do I get any thanks, any show of appreciation? No. All I get is criticism and questions, and you plotting how you can take over, planning your triumphant return back to Springfield. Well, in case you haven't noticed, I'm the one in charge here, me.",

        "Gus: And you want everybody to think we're dead-- my wife, our kids, his grandchildren. You know how much Lizzie loves her grandfather, but you don't mind hurting your own family with this much pain and grief, huh?",
        "Beth: It'll all work out, don't you worry.",
        "Gus: Really? I think you're sick.",

        "Alan-Michael: How secure of you. But Marina said there was... never mind, forget it.",
        "Dinah: No. What did Marina say?",
        "Alan-Michael: It's probably just gossip from down at the cop shop. She heard that Mallet had been turning down partners left and right.",
        "Dinah: Like you said, people gossip.",
        "Alan-Michael: Yeah, that's probably all it is. Anyway, keep up the good work, little Miss CEO, and if you need anything, you know where to find me.",

        "Harley: Lighten up? Can we talk seriously?",
